LVMH Buys Rodeo Drive Retail Space for $110M - Los Angeles Business Journal,"Thu, 29 Mar 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vbGFidXNpbmVzc2pvdXJuYWwuY29tL3JlYWwtZXN0YXRlL2x2bWgtYnV5cy1yb2Rlby1kcml2ZS1yZXRhaWwtc3BhY2UtMTEwbS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Talk about doubling your money.

LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton Inc. purchased a two-story, 6,200-square-foot retail property at 456 N. Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills for $110 million – or nearly $17,750 per square foot – from Palm Beach, Fla.-based private equity group Sterling Organization, which had acquired the property for $55 million one day earlier.

Sterling Organization bought the building from The Karl B. Schurz Trust on Monday, only to make a $55 million profit the next day for itself and its institutional investor partners in its Sterling Value Add Partners II fund, the group said in a statement.

The property is located in the Golden Triangle area, between Santa Monica Boulevard and Brighton Way.

The Sterling Organization – no connection to former Los Angeles Clippers owner Donald Sterling – obtained control of the property via a highly structured, off-market deal first made public through the recording of a long-term ground lease with rights to purchase in October 2017.

The lease was the result of three months of negotiations between Jonathan Mendis, Sterling’s senior vice president of investments for the western United States, Brian D. Kosoy, Sterling’s president and chief executive officer, and the trustee for Schurz Trust.

An intermediary approached LVMH to lease space at the property, but the Paris-based company chose to buy it on an off-market basis, according to Sterling Organization.

“Credit for this transaction goes to Jon Mendis,” Kosoy said in a statement. “His deep network of relationships and reputation in the industry helped us execute and achieve the results on this deal for our investor partners.”

Jay Luchs of Newmark Knight Frank was the broker who introduced the parties.

Though the price – and whiplash-inducing sales timing – is noteworthy, there have been bigger sales on this street. In 2016, Bijan’s yellow store on Rodeo Drive sold to LVMH for $122 million or $19,405 per square foot.

How LVMH Prize boosts young designers in tough fashion world - South China Morning Post,"Tue, 13 Mar 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjbXAuY29tL2xpZmVzdHlsZS9mYXNoaW9uLWJlYXV0eS9hcnRpY2xlLzIxMzY5NTEvbHZtaC1wcml6ZS1jcmVhdG9yLWFuZC1wYXN0LXdpbm5lci1hd2FyZHMtdmFsdWUteW91bmcjIdIBc2h0dHBzOi8vYW1wLnNjbXAuY29tL2xpZmVzdHlsZS9mYXNoaW9uLWJlYXV0eS9hcnRpY2xlLzIxMzY5NTEvbHZtaC1wcml6ZS1jcmVhdG9yLWFuZC1wYXN0LXdpbm5lci1hd2FyZHMtdmFsdWUteW91bmc?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The prize is the brainchild of Delphine Arnault, director and vice-president of Louis Vuitton. Arnault is known for her eye for talent and has been instrumental in the hiring of key figures at the group, such as Nicolas Ghesquière at Louis Vuitton and Jonathan Anderson at Loewe (she is also the daughter of LVMH owner Bernard Arnault, the richest person in France).

The group behind brands such as Louis Vuitton, Fendi, Dior and Bulgari, LVMH is a powerhouse in the luxury industry and as such, the company came to the realisation that it had a role to play in supporting young talent.

It has been five years since the first LVMH Prize for Young Fashion Designers took place in Paris during the city’s fashion week and ever since the event has been one of the hottest tickets at the annual March shows.

“I always wanted to start the prize but I’ve never had the time – although I still don’t,” laughs Arnault when I meet her at the two-day presentation of the 20 brands shortlisted for the 2018 edition of the prize. “But I think it’s really important to support young people. This prize is really just to help them. They don’t have to do anything for us.”

One of the key features of the prize is its accessibility. Unlike fashion awards which involve lengthy application processes by designers who have been selected by panels of experts, Arnault explains that you just have to apply online.

“We don’t approach them [designers] ourselves so anyone who has access to a computer can apply. You have to be between 18 and 30 and have done at least two collections. We had over 1,300 applicants this year and we selected 20, so to see them today is very exciting.”

The first thing you notice when walking around the preview to meet the creators and see their work is the global reach of the competition. From Snow Xue Gao, a Chinese designer based in New York, to Rokh, a Céline alumnus from South Korea in London, to Polish brand Magda Butrym and designers from fashion capitals such as Paris and Tokyo, the prize provides a bird’s-eye view of what the new generation of young creatives is doing right now.

As Arnault points out, however, no effort is actually made to make the prize international. “It’s not about the nationalities, but the talent,” she says.

The 20 candidates get to meet a range of top fashion buyers and editors at the Paris event, not to mention judges including Karl Lagerfeld, Haider Ackermann and Marc Jacobs. Afterwards, the judges select nine finalists, with the final winner being announced in June.

Besides a cash prize of €300,000 (US$370,000), the winner receives mentoring for one year from a key LVMH executive, who helps with practical matters such as production, accounting and finance.

“It’s difficult to be a young designer and entrepreneur today because you have to be very creative, but also your team is very small as you’re just starting your business so you have to know about finance, accounting, production, design,” Arnault says.

“The advice I would give any young designer is to have someone on the business side that they really trust and who also has a unique point of view and a clear vision of what they’re going to do. There are so many designers, so many brands and some have more resources than others so it’s really about having a point of view.”

Given the competitive nature of the industry, it is easy to wonder why so many graduates want to attach their names to a label at such a young age, instead of working for a bigger brand and learning the ropes for a few years. But as Arnault says, there is no one path.

“Some designers who are very talented prefer to work in-house, so it depends on what they want to do. Having a brand is a lot of work, so it depends on how much time they want to dedicate. Some designers are very entrepreneurial and want to have something under their name, while others are not interested in that and prefer to work for a house that already has a lot of history and develop that house according to the codes of the house.

“Look at someone like Karl [Lagerfeld], who’s been working for several houses and also has his own brand; or Jonathan Anderson, who works for Loewe and [has] his own brand; or Nicolas Ghesquière, who only does Vuitton. Everyone is different in the way they do things.”

Looking at some of the prize’s recent winners, you can clearly see that LVMH is doing something right. From 2015 winner Marques’Almeida and runner-up Jacquemus to Grace Wales Bonner (2016) and Marine Serre (2017), all have gone on to grow their businesses and become some of the most respected emerging brands out there.

Serre’s journey was typical of a struggling young designer trying to make ends meet before all the changes that came with winning the prize.

“I never planned to apply or to win because I was so young but then I received an email from a scout, who said that I should apply. At the time I was working for Balenciaga to pay my rent, but then I decided to do it,” explains Serre during a visit to her studio in Paris.

“The first moments after winning the LVMH Prize were great, but I was a bit lost meeting all these people and also I’m not from Paris. I’m French, but I lived in Belgium and wasn’t really in the fashion world then. So it was quite crazy but also very good and I got [to meet] the first retailers. They all came: Dover Street Market, Ssense, Opening Ceremony, Hug from Chengdu in China.”

Before Serre won the prize her operation consisted of three people – one of which was her boyfriend – and she used to make her designs in her living room. So the first thing she did after winning was find a studio. “Now I have people working for me because I need to produce for the orders and I have to think how I want to continue and grow this,” she says.

At Paris Fashion Week in September last year she showed a small presentation rather than a full collection, but after expanding her team to 10 people she was able to put on her first runway show in Paris in February.

I do think about [the winners] and whether they could work for one of our brands but you never know Delphine Arnault

She says the mentoring she received from LVMH has helped a lot. “The advice I got doesn’t interfere with the design at all – it’s mainly business advice and it’s nice to have someone that you can talk to. It’s about finding solutions, asking about building a team, which is not easy. There are laws and things that you need to know.”

While prizewinners obviously receive many tangible benefits, the exposure from being nominated is also a great advantage for young designers.

“I met lots of people here and I’m surrounded by amazing people and amazing talent,” says Rok Hwang of Rokh. “There’s a great vibe and energy and it’s an honour to be here and to get the feedback from these people. We’ve received great comments and people were interested in our clothes and how they’re constructed, and I was able to show the way I cut and build my fabrics to them.”

While the prize has no strings attached, you can’t help but wonder whether LVMH is also using it as a way to find talent that could one day take over some of its most storied labels.

“We always keep in touch [with the winners] and even after the year of mentorship we continue to have meetings,” Arnault says. “I do think about them and whether they could work for one of our brands but you never know. Most of them have only done one or two collections so you have to see how their talent and style evolve.”

It is not an easy time to be a young designer and initiatives like the LVMH Prize are invaluable resources for those trying to make it in the business. But Arnault explains that the challenges facing designers today are not so different than those from decades ago.

“It’s the same for every designer. Even Christian Dior started with a very small team and then after the ‘New Look’ and the revolution he created his team and it grew very fast, like 1,000 people in just two years,” she says.

“Now we’re at a moment when it’s all about what’s happening now, so when you have new designers, there’s a lot of attention on them. But fashion is not a sprint, it’s a marathon. Some of the designers come back to apply year after year, like Jacquemus, who came back and then won the special prize the second time he applied. You have to persevere. You have to create buzz and attention, but it has to last through a lot of seasons.”"
LVMH's Vuitton taps Off-White's Virgil Abloh to design menswear - Yahoo News,"Mon, 26 Mar 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vbmV3cy55YWhvby5jb20vbHZtaHMtdnVpdHRvbi10YXBzLW9mZi13aGl0ZXMtdmlyZ2lsLWFibG9oLWRlc2lnbi0wNjU1MTkzMTYtLWZpbmFuY2UuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"FILE PHOTO: A Louis Vuitton logo, part of LVMH luxury group, is pictured on a building in Geneva, Switzerland, November 23, 2017. REUTERS/Denis Balibouse

PARIS (Reuters) - LVMH's <LVMH.PA> Louis Vuitton brand, the biggest revenue driver at the French luxury goods group, said on Monday it had hired Virgil Abloh, the founder of streetwear label Off-White, to design its menswear collections.

The appointment follows internal reshuffles at LVMH that included switching menswear designers at sister brand Christian Dior.

Abloh, a 37-year-old American who has worked as hip-hop singer Kanye West's creative director, launched his first men's and womenswear collections through his Off-White label four years ago.

The brand is known for its luxury urban style, featuring hoodies that start at 400 pounds ($570), at a time when high-end brands are adopting some streetwear looks to attract younger shoppers.

Abloh, who interned with the rapper at LVMH's Fendi label, takes over from Briton Kim Jones - also known for introducing a streetwear look at Vuitton and who was last week named as the new designer of menswear at Dior.

Vuitton chief executive Michael Burke said in a statement that Abloh's ""innate creativity and disruptive approach have made him so relevant, not just in the world of fashion but in popular culture today.""

Menswear is typically a much smaller contributor to sales than women's fashion for big brands, but LVMH is shaking up men's collections across a number of its firms, as well as revamping the management of several labels.

Its French label Celine aims to at least double revenues under incoming designer Hedi Slimane as it branches into menswear and perfumes as well as growing online.

Text Dominic Cadogan

The ever-increasing speed of fashion is a growing concern among a lot of designers, particularly those who are just starting out. For Kwaidan Editions – founded last year by husband and wife duo Hung La and Léa Dickely – rather than trying to compete with it, they are working at their own pace. “We have a long-term vision,” the pair told us. “It's not about getting famous. It's about building something solid.” After meeting during their first year at the Royal Academy Antwerp, both designers completed stints at houses within the industry, with La working at Céline and Balenciaga under Nicolas Ghesquière and Dickely freelancing for Rick Owens. Deciding to start their own label, they launched Kwaidan Editions in 2017. Taking its name from a 1975 Japanese horror film, the label has a strong film-noir vibe, but is not about gore or horror. “There's always a tinge of darkness in what we do,” the duo explain. “It's not about celebrating that, it's just about finding beauty in unusual things.” “It's not about getting famous. It's about building something solid” – Kwaidan Editions For the SS18 collection that manifested itself in a chic reimagining of the 90s. Think tie-dye print tees, figure-hugging satin shirts paired with baggy leather trousers, and some great trash bag-esque coats. The more recent AW18 collection went darker, featuring monochrome tailoring, giant fur coats, acid green satin, and an eerie woodland print. Always pushing the unusual, or unexpected element though, the fur is faux, the leather is in fact pleather, and the python is leather specially treated to look that way. “It’s always about the play of opposites,” the duo say. The same can be said for the contrast between La and Dickely’s approach to design. “It's kind of the tension between two opposites: different sexes, different personalities, different cultural backgrounds,” they explain. “It's us meeting in the middle, finding the right tension and pushing that forward.” Though the brand is London-based, this is something they aren’t keen on labelling themselves with, just as, for now, they are content with presenting each collection via a lookbook. “It's an evolution,” they say on their approach to growing Kwaidan. “We see it as a chapter in a book. One chapter should always lead into the next.” As a long-term strategy, taking things at their own pace is already paying off, with the label recently announced as one of the nine 2018 LVMH Prize finalists. Ahead of the winner being announced in June, we caught up with the duo on how they collaborate, and what the future holds for Kwaidan Editions.

Growing up did you both have an interest in fashion? Hung La: I grew up in Washington DC. I started off as an engineer: I have a degree in computer engineering. The attraction to fashion came in my teenage years. It was just this communication of dress. The way that you could change who you were walking down the hallway in your favourite jeans and kicks and t-shirt; that always spoke to me. I tried engineering, but I knew it didn't fit for me. So I went to a lot of schools: I went to Parsons for a bit, I went to a school in Italy called Marangoni, and then I went to Antwerp, where we met 14 years ago. Léa Dickely: I always wanted to do fashion, so that’s different. I started being interested at the age of twelve, and from that point on I aimed at certain schools. I really wanted to study design right away, so I went to a high school focused on fashion and design. After that, I studied fine art. And then, I went to Antwerp to really focus on fashion. How do you collaborate together on the design process? Hung La: The design process starts with Léa. There's a language in Kwaidan Editions of women designing for women. There’s a flow between us throughout the season. Léa starts with the initial impulse, and then it's going back and forth. Léa Dickely: The season always starts with me bringing the first input. I go in a bubble for a couple of days. It's about recreating memories or feelings, it's very cinematic. It always starts with a space, or an image of a place where something is happening. Then, the rest of the season is just both of us equally working on it. My part is a bit more the visual aspect, the spirit and the world around it. Hung is more about making it, he's technically very strong. He makes everything happen. It's all about this balance between us.

How do you approach each collection? Hung La: The collections are not about one individual piece. It's about a collective whole. And that's always the way we design. We think about how it's going to be presented, how it's going to be on the rails. What are the colours? How is each piece collectively telling a story? The colours are very important. The print is very important. The textures are important. It's about how collectively they work together. Léa Dickely: Another thing we always have is the sense of interiors. The inspiration always comes from a place, an interior. I grew up in the east part of France. Interiors were very charged, very decorative. And that's something that always comes through. The prints and certain choices of fabrics that always come back in the collections. Can you tell us more about the SS18 collection? Hung La: It is our second collection. We have these strong, luxurious, well-made Italian wools, and beautiful coating. But then inside the collection, you also have what we call the ‘rubbish’ fabric. It looks like a trash bag. We also have rubber. There's a real kinkiness in the play between something very elevated and very trivial. It's always 'uncanny' – a word we throw around a lot. There's always a subtle twist that makes you look like 'Why is that shirt so tight?', or 'Why is that sleeve so long?', or 'What was going on with the proportions?'."
What Does it Really Mean to Be an Emerging Fashion Brand? - Observer,"Fri, 16 Mar 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vb2JzZXJ2ZXIuY29tLzIwMTgvMDMvZW1lcmdpbmctZmFzaGlvbi1icmFuZHMtYWNjb3JkaW5nLXRvLWx2bWgtYW5kLWNmZGEv0gFUaHR0cHM6Ly9vYnNlcnZlci5jb20vMjAxOC8wMy9lbWVyZ2luZy1mYXNoaW9uLWJyYW5kcy1hY2NvcmRpbmctdG8tbHZtaC1hbmQtY2ZkYS9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"What exactly does the term “emerging fashion designer” mean?

Such was the case this week, when both the Council of Fashion Designers of America (CFDA) and LVMH (LVMHF) released information on their upcoming prizes and awards.

First came details on the finalists for the LVMH 2018 Prize for Young Fashion Designers, announced on Thursday afternoon. Of the nine brands who made the cut, only two were based in the U.S.: Eckhaus Latta and Matthew Adams Dolan. The rest hailed from London (Charles Jeffrey Loverboy and Kwaidan Editions), Paris (Ludovic de Saint Sernin), Antwerp (Botter) and Tokyo (Doublet). Surprisingly absent from this representation of fashion capitals is Italy—but that’s a story for another time.

The designers will be pitted against each other this coming June at the Fondation Louis Vuitton, when a jury including designers Nicolas Ghesquière, Marc Jacobs, Jonathan Anderson, Clare Waight Keller as well as LVMH execs Delphine Arnault and Sidney Toledano will pick one youthful victor.

Zoe Latta and Mike Eckhaus have been fashion darlings for quite some time, despite requiring editors and influencers to trek to Bushwick to see their fashion show for the past two seasons. The bi-coastal design team (Eckhaus resides in NYC, while Latta is based in L.A.) produces genderless garb that appeals to club kids and has already received recognition by the Hammer Museum in L.A. and MoMA PS1 in New York.

Matthew Adams Dolan, meanwhile, is a favorite of Rihanna, having produced a number of head-to-toe denim getups for the pop star. His true sartorial claim to fame, however, is toying with the proportions of the classics, like blowing up the cuffs on a button-down shirt or curving the shoulders on a basic blazer. It’s that keen eye for attention that has garnered him some major buzz, including profiles in the pages of Vogue and T Magazine.

Needless to say, these two brands aren’t exactly unknown.

The budding talents nominated for a CFDA Award this year aren’t really a group of underground designers right out of school, either. That might not come as much of a surprise, as there’s a corporate push behind the Swarovski Award for Emerging Talent, because, yes, it’s sponsored by the crystal giant. The winner will “receive generous financial support from Swarovski as well as exposure to the company’s vast and innovative Swarovski crystal resources,” according to the CFDA, which announced the news of the awards late on Thursday evening.

This year, that group includes Mike Amiri of Amiri, Laura Vassar Brock and Christopher Brock of Brock Collection, Aurora James of Brother Vellies, Kerby Jean-Raymond of Pyer Moss and Sander Lak of Sies Marjan.

In fact, most of those names are incredibly familiar to the fashion flock, especially those who follow the CFDA’s array of various competitions and incubators. In 2015, for example, James was awarded the CFDA/Vogue Fashion Fund Award for her made-in-Africa shoe collection; the duo behind the romantic floral frocks of Brock Collection took home that same award the following year.

Sies Marjan was lauded by many (including this website) as the brand to watch in February 2016, and Lak has lived up to that intimidating title. His mastery of colors, particularly those candy-hued silk dresses and fuzzy sweaters, has turned the brand into a celeb favorite.

Jean-Raymond has also made headlines, for his unflinching desire to use his runway as a stage for contentious topics, including his father’s immigration from Haiti to New York in the ’80s, the stigma around mental health and even pitting Bernie Madoff against Bernie Sanders. He’s known not just for pushing out pretty clothes, but for apparel that makes shoppers actually think about the significance behind their purchases.

However, there’s a good chance you’re not yet acquainted with Amiri, which was recently called “the most popular men’s luxury brand you’ve never heard of” by The New York Times. The L.A.-based range started off with shredded denim and sweaters with intentional holes, but has since grown to include equally distressed California cool items for women, including skirts, skimpy slip dresses and silken bomber jackets.

To these major governing bodies of fashion, it seems that an emerging creative is no longer considered to be a recent design school graduate or supremely talented teenager who simply stumbled onto the scene; you now need an A-list following, a few major profiles and perhaps even your own boutique to be among that designation. Young designers, you’ve been warned. It is, indeed, harder to make it in fashion now than ever before."

Kering and Richemont: Why a Mega-Merger Makes Sense - The Business of Fashion,"Mon, 19 Mar 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzb2ZmYXNoaW9uLmNvbS9vcGluaW9ucy9sdXh1cnkva2VyaW5nLWFuZC1yaWNoZW1vbnQtd2h5LWEtbWVnYS1tZXJnZXItbWFrZXMtc2Vuc2Uv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"GENEVA, Switzerland — Sustaining growth and maintaining a competitive edge in today's increasingly complex luxury goods industry requires more than simply hitting the right fashion notes. There comes a time when even big-thinking companies need to think bigger in order to secure and optimise their achievements. Three crucial factors come to mind: scale, category leadership and a conglomerate structure. Size helps optimise fixed costs, leadership in multiple categories brings stability and a strong portfolio of brands makes it easier to attract and nurture talent. LVMH has all of this in spades.

Certainly, rival conglomerates Kering and Richemont have scale, but nowhere near that of LVMH, the world's largest luxury group. Sure, they also each hold strong positions in certain categories, but they both lack a meaningful presence in others. Both have also tried to build a broad base. For either group, taking the solo route to realising their potential would be a massive risk. It would also take time. Can anyone really see either Kering or Richemont trying to build what took LVMH — with the advantage of an open playing field — four decades?

So, let’s indulge in some “blue sky” thinking: a merger between Kering and Richemont would make both strategic and operational sense.

It's fair to say Kering has come of age: Gucci's turnaround has been brilliant, going far beyond the rosiest initial expectations; the imminent distribution of Puma shares will finally deliver on Kering's long-stated goal of becoming a luxury pure player; and Saint Laurent and Balenciaga are true growth champions. But despite these achievements, Kering remains significantly smaller than LVMH, frustrated in its hard luxury ambitions and more exposed to brand trivialisation risk than its peer.

The two companies complement each other: Kering with clear strengths in soft luxury, Richemont as a champion of hard luxury.

Richemont has risen on strong demand for jewellery and Cartier and Van Cleef & Arpels lead the sector in branded jewellery. But like Kering, Richemont has unfulfilled ambitions. In soft luxury, Chloé's success is offset by the failures of Dunhill and Lancel. In watches, Piaget, Vacheron Constantin and Jaeger Le Coultre must reinvent themselves if they are to avoid being considered too expensive for new luxury consumers and too bland for collectors.

Furthermore, the two companies complement each other: Kering with clear strengths in soft luxury, Richemont as a champion of hard luxury. The combination would create significant scale advantage and reduce the gap with LVMH. It would also generate synergies worth hundreds of millions.

The big question is whether the respective controlling families would be willing to sacrifice control for the sake of building a stronger, better and more valuable company. This is particularly relevant at Richemont, where the Rupert family holds the majority of the voting rights but only 9 percent of the capital.

Seen from this perspective, a number of recent moves by Kering and Richemont suddenly appear more rational. Why separate Puma just now? Why the hurry? Couldn’t Kering wait for a buyer? Why push Gucci so hard, and not take the opportunity to significantly reduce wholesale, grey market and factory outlet activities? Why secure control of Yoox Net-a-Porter?

It’s also worth noting how Kering and Richemont have recently expanded the areas in which they work together. Cartier has joined Kering Eyewear, the Kering hard luxury brands have moved their presentations from Baselworld to the Salon International de la Haute Horlogerie in Geneva, where Richemont is based, and Kering has found itself more deeply involved with Richemont at Yoox Net-a-Porter.

Blue-sky maybe — but is a merger so farfetched?

It used to be you could lust after Céline on the runway, but if you ever wanted to nab a piece of that sharp, minimalist gorgeousness, you had to venture into a brick and mortar store. And for those of us who pretty much only shop online, bolstered by liquid courage and a memorized credit card security code, that was a major barrier to entry. But that changes today, with the launch of the French label on 24 Sèvres, LVMH's multi-brand e-commerce site.



""Since our launch last June, demand for Céline on the site has been high and consistent,"" Eric Goguey, the CEO of 24 Sèvres said in a statement. To commemorate the launch, there's an exclusive five piece capsule collection—a skirt, a sweater, shoes, earrings and a bag—inspired by the brand's spring 2018 runway show. In addition, every ready-to-wear piece from the spring collection plus leather goods, shoes, accessories, eyewear and a selection of iconic pieces are also available.

Courtesy The Céline v-neck sweater ( ), asymmetrical pleated skirt ( ), and soft dancer loafers ( ) are all part of the Céline x 24 Sèvres exclusive collection.

"Kris Van Assche leaves Dior Homme, but not LVMH - Vogue France","Mon, 19 Mar 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZvZ3VlLmZyL3ZvZ3VlLWhvbW1lcy9mYXNoaW9uL2FydGljbGVzL2tyaXMtdmFuLWFzc2NoZS1sZWF2ZXMtZGlvci1ob21tZS1idXQtbm90LWx2bWgvNjE1NjLSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"New Dior CEO Pietro Beccari has been in the job just six weeks since taking over from Sidney Toledano, he has already made his first big announcement. Dior Homme Creative Director Kris Van Assche, who evolved the house towards a hybrid sportwear-tailoring silhouette, is stepping down. In a statement, Pietro Beccari paid tribute to the designer for his “contribution to the incredible expansion at Dior Homme and the creation of an elegant and contemporary silhouette. He has written an important chapter in the history of the house and played a key role in its development.”

Kris Van Assche arrived in 2007, after working with Hedi Slimane at Saint Laurent Rive Gauche, then Dior Homme, and began borrowing design elements from youth culture, as he explains: “people sometimes want to put Dior Homme in a box. Is it just meant to be pure luxury and impeccable tailoring? Or should it be the young, underground label followed only followed by the fashion crowd that I inherited ten years ago? I have always refused to make that choice and I think that we should play on both of these heritages.”. Under his creative direction, the house held a series of shows in Asia to boost sales in the region and also began working with celebrities ranging from A$ap Rocky to Boy George and Dave Gahan of Depeche Mode, harnessing social media and high-profile campaigns to take the label right around the globe.

The LVMH group announced that Kris Van Assche will not be leaving the group and will take on a new role shortly, with speculation surrounding his next move including a re-launch of his own brand that was shuttered in 2005 after ten years. Dior has announced that Kim Jones, who headed up menswear design at Louis Vuitton for seven years before leaving the house in January, will be taking over and will show his first collection for Dior in June, during Menswear Week.

Has Fashion Given Business Women a Fighting Chance? - The Fashion Law,"Thu, 08 Mar 2018 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWZhc2hpb25sYXcuY29tL2hhcy1mYXNoaW9uLWdpdmVuLXdvbWVuLWEtZmlnaHRpbmctY2hhbmNlL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Utterly Instagrammable t-shirts appeared on the Christian Dior runway for Spring/Summer 2017. They declared, “We Should All be Feminists.” More recently, the show space was plastered with protest and feminist-inspired imagery and models wore t-shirts that read, “Why Have There Been No Great Women Artists?,” a play on American art historian Linda Nochlin’s a 1971 essay with the same title.

As the first-ever female creative director at Christian Dior, Maria Grazia Chiuri routinely uses the runway to make a statement. In light of the state of the gender power structure in the fashion industry, it is difficult not to wonder if she is not only talking to her Dior customers but also nudging fashion’s reigning powers that be: The men behind fashion’s biggest brands. There is, after all, a stark lack of women at the helm of the industry’s most well-known brands, and also behind the scenes.

This is a particularly interesting phenomenon if we consider the breakdown of the market for luxury goods. In the 250-billion-euro space, 85 percent of personal luxury goods consumers are women, according to a 2015 Bain report. Euromonitor confirmed that luxury womenswear and accessories continued to outperform menswear in 2016. And as recently as October 2017, online marketing consultancy PMX Agency found that of Gen X consumers – those born between 1965 to 1984, who make up the biggest buyers of luxury goods – women were still significantly outspending men.

These figures are wildly disproportionate to the statistics that detail the supply side of the equation, where the industry’s most highly-ranking positions are by and large dominated by men.

The relatively recent appointments of Clare Waight Keller at Givenchy, Natacha Ramsey-Levi at Chloe, and Maria Grazia Chiuri at Christian Dior – the latter being Dior’s first-ever female creative director in the Paris-based design house’s 71-year history – signal a degree of advancement. Such appointments serve – at least in theory – to challenge the status quo of male designers’ power at the helms of the crown jewel brands of luxury conglomerates’ portfolios.

(This is something we examined at length last spring, in asking: Have luxury conglomerates given a fair chance to female creatives in the upper-most echelon of the fashion industry?).

But what is going on behind-the-scenes? On the business side of the equation, the imbalance persists. Industry-wide, women only make up 25 percent of board-level positions in publicly traded fashion and luxury goods companies, as of 2015, per BoF. Initiatives aimed at increasing gender diversity are being imposed in some countries, including France, where a 2011 law requires that all companies listed on the CAC 40 – a benchmark French stock market index – must show that women account for at least 40 percent of their board membership.

In 2015, more than 74 percent of the LVMH workforce and 73 percent of graduate in-take was made up of women. Of those numbers, only 4 out of 17 accounted for executive or board level management positions. LVMH has made strides to address this disparity by way of EllesVMH, a diversity-centric initiative it launched in 2007 “at the initiative of Chantal Gaemperle, Group Executive Vice President of Human Resources and Synergies.”

Now, over 10 years later, LVMH’s 10-member Executive Committee includes one woman, Ms. Gaemperle, herself. Its 15-member Board of Directors boasts a total of 6 women.

In terms of non-creative roles at LVMH’s 16 individual fashion & leather goods brands, 4 women serve as CEOs: Séverine Merle, CEO of Celine; Sylvie Colin, CEO of Kenzo; Pascale Lepoivre CEO of Loewe; and Sophie Brocart, CEO of Nicolas Kirkwood. It is worth noting that Laudomia Pucci – a Pucci family member – is the chairwoman of Emilio Pucci, and at Louis Vuitton, Delphine Arnault – daughter of LVMH chairman, Bernard Arnault – serves as Director and Executive Vice President.

What about rival, Kering? The Paris-based conglomerate’s 14-member Executive Committee includes a total of 4 women: Saint Laurent CEO Francesa Bellettini, Chief Sustainability Officer Marie-Claire Daveau, SVP of Communications Valerie Duport, and SVP of Human Resources Beatrice Lazat.

On its 11-member Board of Directors there are 7 women: Laurence Boone, Sophie L’Hélias, Sapna Sood, Sophie Bouchillou, Patricia Barbizet, Daniela Riccardi, and Yseulys Costes.

Meanwhile, Richemont, which owns Chloe, Alaia, and Cartier, among other brands, has a 19-member Board of Directors with just 3 women: Keyu Jin, Vesna Nevistic, and Maria Ramos.

In terms of other luxury groups, the Prada Group, for instance, maintains two spots held by women on its Board of Directors: Miuccia Prada, who holds the title of CEO and Executive Director (titles she shares with husband Patrizio Bertelli), and Alessandra Cozzani, who serves as the group’s Chief Financial Officer and Executive Director.

Chanel, which is owned by billionaire brothers Alain and Gérard Wertheimer, was under the control of a female CEO, Maureen Chiquet, for nearly a decade, until she left the company in 2016.

As for Mayhoola for Investments – the group backed by Sheikh Tamim, al-Missned, the monarch and head of state of Qatar, which owns Valentino, Balmain, the global license for Missoni’s M Missoni line, and Pal Zileri, the Italian menswear brand – it is not entirely clear how many women (if any) are members of the board.

When it comes to the market’s biggest e-commerce sites. Yoox Net-a-Porter – the e-commerce giant created by the merger of the female-founded Net-a-Porter and the Federico Marchetti-formed Yoox – has 3 women on its board, including Laura Zoni, Catherine Gérardin Vautrin, and Eva Chen. That is one more than rival FarFetch, which has 2 women at the table: Dana Evan and Natalie Massenet.

With the gender statistics in terms of top roles at the fashion industry’s most esteemed brands in mind, the future for even the most highly educated women is arguably not particularly promising if the reigning governance and power structures remain static. However, change may be under way.

For instance, there is the positive trend of women creative directors being appointed to helm the industry’s multi-billion dollar houses, such as Dior and Hermes; heritage brands like Chloé; and more recently established names, including Alexander McQueen. Similar efforts will ideally permeate the C-suite, especially given the institution of legally-enforceable policies by a number of European countries that acknowledge the importance and the urgency of this matter.

Finally (and most importantly), the messages that appear to be so popular on the runway will hopefully be put into practice because what good is a t-shirt without greater change happening alongside it?"
The Behind-the-Scenes Battle to Build One of the World’s Most Magnificent Museums - The Fashion Law,"Tue, 13 Mar 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWZhc2hpb25sYXcuY29tL3RoZS1tYWtpbmctb2Ytb25lLW9mLXRoZS13b3JsZHMtbW9zdC1tYWduaWZpY2VudC1tdXNldW1zL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Five years after Bernard Arnault met Frank Gehry, he had a proposal for him. Help me build one of the world’s most noteworthy contemporary-art museums-cum-cultural centers. It would take eight years, 3,000 laborers, a reported $143 million-plus, a partnership between one of the world’s most famous architects and one of its richest men, and the passage of a special national French law for that cultural epicenter to come into fruition.

“Money from the fashion industry started to enter the cultural sphere in Paris in the 1970s with projects like the Espace Pierre Cardin,” wrote Bloomberg’s Robert Williams last year. Bernard Arnault, the chairman of LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, was apparently looking to up the ante.

A glass behemoth, the Fondation Louis Vuitton stands tall in the Bois de Boulogne, the city-owned park situated along the western edge of the 16th arrondissement of Paris. Resembling “a magnificent vessel to symbolize the cultural calling of France,” as Canadian-American architect Frank Gehry put it, the sprawling masterpiece is the home of a permanent collection of the works of Gerhard Richter, Thomas Schütte, Pierre Huyghe, Bertrand Lavier, Christian Boltanski and Frank Stella, among others.

But the making of the extraordinary structure was not only a time-consuming and costly process. It was a legally arduous one.

The Making of a Masterpiece

In October 2006, Bernard Arnault – standing alongside Donnedieu de Vabres, Minister for Culture and Communication; Bertrand Delanoë, Mayor of Paris at the time; Frank Gehry, the project’s architect; and Yves Carcelle, former Chairman of Louis Vuitton – announced that something big was in the works: The Fondation Louis Vuitton.

Two months later, things began to take shape. Ahead of the Christmas holiday, LVMH came to an agreement with the City of Paris. In exchange for the right to erect its Fondation on a one-hectare plot in the Bois de Boulogne, LVMH signed an occupancy agreement for the museum. The term: 55 year lease, so to speak, after which ownership of the museum, itself, would be transferred to the city as “a gift.”

A few more months later, things were proceeding smoothly. A building permit for the museum was issued to LVMH by Bertrand Delanoë, the city’s mayor at the time, but not before the City of Paris amended the city’s regulatory code.

According to a “Comment” from the Constitutional Council of the French Republic, the highest constitutional authority in France, in order for the city to legally grant LVMH’s building permit, it would have to modify the city’s local urban plan (“PLU”). Because the privately-held Fondation Louis Vuitton was to sit in the Bois de Boulogne city-owned park, the land where construction would take place was located within “Zone N” of the City of Paris’ PLU governed “natural area and forest” zones. This meant that the land and any developers were subject to strict limits on construction for the “sake of safeguarding.”

In June 2006, the Paris council voted in favor of modifications to authorize new construction in the area that corresponds to Boulogne park.

Building commenced in the spring of 2008, and just as the concrete foundation of the Fondation was nearly completion, things came to a screeching halt.

The Coordination for the Protection of the Bois de Boulogne and its Surroundings (“Coordination”), a coalition of Parisian residents, moved to formally challenge the legality of the city’s PLU adjustments and the validity of the Foundation Louis Vuitton’s building permit, due, in part to the fact that the structure stood to block a public road (one of the points governed by the PLU) and at a whopping 150-feet-high, violated a legal restriction limiting the height of buildings in the area.

François Douady, who was leading the Coordination for the safeguarding of the Bois de Boulogne, told Le Journal du Dimanche: “They want to impose on us a 12,000 square metre building 46 metres high – 20 metres above the trees. We lack greenery in Paris, not museums. I hope this project is razed to the ground.”

And it seemed as though Douady just might get his way. On June 18, 2010, the Conseil d’etta (Council of State) canceled part of the modified PLU, overriding the 2006 vote to allow building upon the exact green space where the Fondation was being built, and reverting to the original land plan. The Administrative Tribunal of Paris, ruling seven months later on January 20, 2011, held that LVMH’s building permit was, in fact, invalid, because it was inconsistent with the old-but-reinstated PLU provisions.

The Coordination had managed to put a stop to the Fondation Louis Vuitton.

Gehry, who was 81 at the time, was “distressed, shocked and furious” at the threat to his “magical” creation.

Renowned French architect Jean Nouvel took his brethren’s side. In an interview with Le Journal du Dimanche, Nouvel had some choice words for the Fondation’s opponents, calling them “individualistic, uncouth philistines.”

“With their little tight-fitting suits,” he said, “they want to put Paris into formalin. It’s quite pathetic.”

The Coordination’s win was merely temporary, of course. Facing the reality that the structure of the museum would be torn down before it even opened, LVMH was forced to face off in a heated legal battle for the right to continue building what the New York Times called “Mr. Arnault’s major vanity project.” So, the group – together with the City of Paris – filed to appeal the Administrative Court’s decision.

Aware of how long it could take for an appeal to the Administrative Tribunal of Paris’ decision to be considered and decided, Arnault – with the backing of Mayor Delanoë, who first approved the building permit – looked to Parliament for a favor: Pass a law that would trump the court’s decision and provide an exemption for the Fondation Louis Vuitton.

A Sudden Amendment

Delanoë and Arnault prevailed. In April 2011, the Assemblée Nationale enacted “a sudden amendment” to allow for the completion of the Foundation Louis Vuitton, a move that the Coordination’s chief, Mr. Douady, called “totally scandalous.” In the eyes of the French Parliament, however, the Fondation was in the national interest and “a major work of art for the whole world.”

That did not, however, stop the courts from considering the issues at hand, and in June 2012, LVMH was granted an additional win. This time it came from the Administrative Court of Appeal of Paris, which had set aside the lower court’s decision that the Fondation Louis Vuitton’s building permit was invalid, and declared that due to the “public interest” considerations “attached to the construction of the new museum,” the museum could – and would – be built.

The museum opened to the public in October 2014, at a widely-reported cost of $143 million – although at least one French publication has stated that the figure actually much closer to $900 million. While it is run as a legally separate, non-profit entity of LVMH, the first official use of the magnificent museum, which boasts a sparkling set of Louis Vuitton’s initials above its entrance: Serving as the venue for Louis Vuitton’s Spring/Summer 2015 womenswear show that October.

Almost ten years after the commencement of formal planning for the Fondation, Bernard Arnault – who personally faced no shortage of backlash over the project, Louis Vuitton’s CEO Michael Burke said at the time – had his masterpiece. At an opening celebration for the foundation, Arnault told CNN, seemingly unscathed by the legal battles and claims of impropriety, that this was simply par for the course: “France is a country where, as you know, we have a lot of manifestations, of protests. Each time you do something, people are against. Even for this fantastic building we had to go through a lot of protests before being able to finish it.”

In terms of the museum, which Vanity Fair has likened to “a 21st-century take on the Grand Palais, the wildly extravagant Beaux-Arts exhibition hall off the Champs-Élysées,” Arnault said that it is a “showing that we are very good (citizens) and that we are working not only for profit, but also for something that is transcendent.”

This move of personal and corporate benevolence bodes well for the rehabilitation of the LVMH chairman’s longstanding reputation as “the wolf in the cashmere coat,” and the view (of at least some) that his conglomerate is more in the business of aggressively monetizing creative talent, operating as a “barbarian at the gilded gates,” as the New York Times put it, than truly fostering it.

As for Arnault, himself, Jean-Paul Claverie, who had, at the time, been spearheading LVMH’s philanthropic initiatives for more than two decades, told the Times: “It will show everyone who he really is.”"
"Meet Marine Serre, The Radical Face of Fashion's Future - ELLE UK","Thu, 22 Mar 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVsbGUuY29tL3VrL2Zhc2hpb24vYXJ0aWNsZXMvYTQyNDcxL21lZXQtbWFyaW5lLXNlcnJlLXRoZS1sdm1oLXByaXplLXdpbm5lci_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"There were a lot of small crescent moons in street style shots from the AW18 shows - red, black, as full sleeve prints or a discreetly placed logo. Fittingly cult-like when you consider the following that Marine Serre, the designer behind the motif, has quickly amassed.

You'll no doubt know of Nicolas Ghesquière, the creative director of Louis Vuitton, Phoebe Philo of Céline, and Karl Lagerfeld. Well, know that they're watching Marine Serre, having awarded her last year's €300,000 LVMH Prize fund.

A year later and Serre is making a mark, putting her investment to good use with her first runway show in Paris, and boundary-pushing techniques as she seeks to challenge our staid view of sustainability. She's also making her brand values clear with a number of international pop-ups, taking over retail spaces in China, London and Paris.

Dover Street Market is the latest store to feature an installation designed by Serre and close collaborator, Tanguy Poujol. And they were among the first to support Serre, picking up her first collection in AW17. 'I chose to champion Marine so early on simply because she has incredible talent,' said Adrian Joffe, President of the internationally renowned store. 'She has an incredibly strong vision.'

You can see the broad appeal of Serre's work. Her aesthetic is deeply rooted in the past, with baroque printed silks sourced from Moroccan markets. But her work is fundamentally modern, with a radicalism that sees crescent moon ski masks and sportswear layered beneath classic drapery and easy-to-wear separates.

Serre's avant garde take on the antique, and strident futurism is evident in the Dover Street Market installation - industrial vitrines upon which her more traditionally feminine silks hang.

FutureWear was printed on pieces shown in Paris earlier this month, and what that means is providing solutions to problems for both the fashion industry and wearer. So denim and safari jackets come with concealed pockets and removable sleeves (technically a three-for-one deal, those pockets seeing no need for a handbag). And sustainability is important, but it's implicit in how she works, rather than a grand statement (along with the vintage scarves, her handbags are repurposed gym balls).

It also looks great. You can see telltale signs of her experience at Dior with the cinched waist of a bar jacket, and the laissez faire luxe of Demna Gvsalia's Balenciaga. It's cool - made to look effortless.

In simplest terms, Marine is a designer of her time - a 26 year old woman doing away with labels and just… doing, seeing running a brand as a pragmatic response to fashion's unsustainable habits, and design as an opportunity to innovate.

We spoke to Marine ahead of setting up her SS18 installation at Dover Street Market, to discuss FutureWear and her brand of utilitarian luxury.

How's everything been since Paris Fashion Week?

Really good, and so much has happened, it's crazy. We've been setting up the showroom, selling, and doing interviews, and I'm going to China in three days, and setting up an exhibition in Dover Street Market. I've not had so much time to sleep! But it's been really nice.

What's happening in China?

We're touring Dover Street Market over there. We're going to China first, but then going to Dover Street Market I.T in Singapore, where we've got a new space displaying our SS18 collection.

So you're physically travelling to every space to set up the installations?

Not everywhere, because it's super busy. I can't be in London, unfortunately. But yeah, it is always important for me to be hands on. We're a really young brand, so I think I'm so used to doing everything myself - from hanging to installing.

This is a bit different, as I'm working with my friend Tanguy Poujol, and other friends, and it's super nice that we can brainstorm together and work together. I'm getting used to working as a bigger team since we've grown, and after the LVMH Prize and everything.

How have you worked together on these installations?

Tanguy is who I worked closest with on the idea. I love the freedom that Dover Street Market have given us. It's amazing, because anyone who doesn't about our world, and what we do, they can really get a sense of that by having this experience in the store.

You don't see the kind of installations that Dover Street Market have in many other places. I feel lucky to have the opportunity to really give their clients the Marine Serre experience.

What do you people to take from their experience of the installations?

I don't know if there's one particular thing I want to say, like 'this season, the collection is about this or that.' It's broader. And about the way we think. The iron bars are really simple and cheap, and it's a great frame for what's inside - the garments. Like seeing that the foundation of something can be simple or old, but you can build something great from that.

It's also the first degree of building something - those bars. It's quite literal. So a nice metaphor for us building the brand!

When you talk about your brand, you often reference this idea of being radical. What does that mean to you?

Getty Images

Going to the end - the full extent. Whether it's pushing yourself with an installation or a dress. If you really want to do your job, you should always take it to the furthest extent.

Is that difficult when you know that you've taken it as far as you can, but are committed to pushing it further each season?

Yeah, it's quite a challenge. Especially now as more people are looking at us, and able to see us. It's challenging - for everyone, not just for me. I also think that to be radical, you need to stay calm, and it's difficult when everything moves so fast.

We thought maybe the first runway collection would be the hardest, but maybe not!

Especially when all eyes are on you after winning the LVMH Prize. Do you feel under pressure to prove yourself, and show signs of that investment as soon as possible?

It's difficult. But I'm focused on building a team - we have 10 people now - and working as a team makes things more manageable for everyone. I can't build a brand if the core of isn't right, and if I don't have right team. It was important for the team to feel right, and then focus on production, making sure that everything was made as we wanted.

Do you feel like you have that foundation in place now?

Yeah, definitely. It takes time, and it's more important for me to have that foundation in place. Each season, we only have 6 months, and this is the beginning for us, but we've made huge jumps with our last collection.

I'm really happy though. We found the right factories, we work well together, and more than 30% of our AW18 collection is totally recycled.

30%? Did you find that challenging?

It's worth it. The scarves that we use for the dresses, the shirts, the handbags - those are old gym balls - it's worth it to show that 'sustainable' doesn't have to look a certain way.

Hemp shoppers, green and beige...

Yes, and the possibilities are infinite. For the next collection, we want to think about new ways to recycle garments, because using vintage garments or objects that aren't in use anymore isn't the only way to recycle fabric.

Building a brand isn't just about designing a look or a shape. We're trying to make radical small steps with production too. It's difficult as a small brand with a smaller budget. But it's great because we have to be creative to get around that. We're forced to think about things.

It's difficult to find the time to think about those things.

It is. But I want to respect my own flow, and the flow of the team, so we're not going to make pre-collections. To stay sharp, you really need to take time to think. And no one has time to think today - not just in fashion. Time is a luxury. And something we need to try harder to make more of.

So that's why your AW18 collection was called Manic Soul Machine... What did you mean by that?

The titles come from how we feel at the time, or the stage that we're at. For example, SS18 is called Cornerstone, because we were thinking about building the brand, and building this framework. And now we're at the stage of Manic Soul Machine, haha. We're all a little frantic these days.

And you need different outfits you those three things. We thought about that. Manic - functional clothing for being busy; Soul - clothing for your daily life, free flowing dresses, you and me going to yoga, haha; Machine - this idea of everyday life and working, and where we're at trying to build the brand.

What kinds of things are driving your creativity - who or what are you looking at when you design each collection?

I'm really inspired by people in the street everyday. There's a lot of romanticism and radicalism and practicality out there in the street. In Paris, there are so many types of people and garments, and seeing that makes me think about fashion more than any movies or those kinds of references.

I think about feeling, and everyday life; what feels right right now? I'm also a woman, so I think 'what do I need today when I take the Metro?'

That's why I made the FutureWear jacket with so many pockets. I never go out without a bottle of water, and I thought we needed something for that - to not have to carry a bag. And pockets are made for a reason. It's like we're so used to pockets that we forget they're there for a reason!

More dresses with pockets, world, please.

Yes! All of our dresses have pockets. Even the most couture dress - the red and white from our collection made of up-cycled shirts - that has pockets. Even if you're on the red carpet, you can have pockets.

You're also thinking of shorter women. It's surprisingly difficult to find clothes that fit short women well.

Yes, clothes for people who aren't super tall - like me. I don't have a muse, and I don't really care about the idea of one woman, so more characters, more feeling good in garments that work on the model, on me.

You can try and get around the issue of designing for different body types if you focus on feeling. It can work if the feeling is there, and you make sure people can wear the clothes and feel good with the fit, or the way the fabric moves. So I think it also works on those smaller people - like me - because of that.

Getty Images

I saw a lot of the moon print during PFW. What does it mean?

Yes, people seem to have really bought into that! The moon has been attached to my collection for three years - since my first collection. The amazing thing about the moon is that it means something different to everyone. Everyone's familiar with it.

It's one of the most ancient symbols in the world. And I don't want to use my name, I think the logo works better.

It's a symbol that really says 'woman' too - in mythology. I really like that people can interpret it in their own way, and that we can also try and interpret it differently with different prints in the next collections. I've heard so many different interpretations.

Have any surprised you?

Yes. Sailor Moon! The Japanese manga character. That surprised me. I really enjoy hearing all of those different interpretations.

What does that symbol really mean to you though?

For me, it's also a symbol of love, which is why I really chose it with the first collection. That collection was called Radical Call for Love. The moon is quite timeless too. It's not going anywhere...

So we've had Radical Call for Love, Cornerstones, and Manic Soul Machine as the names for collections. This might be a spoiler alert, but what are you feeling now?

Oh, I don't know yet. I know, but I can't say what will filter into the collection!

What's exciting you right now - personally and professionally?

But right now, I'm excited - about travelling to China and Japan. I've never been there, and that's really nice. It will be nice to just hang out and wander around. I think that will be amazing. I'll think about the rest when I come back."
Suitcase brand Rimowa cancels all dealer contracts - Retail Detail Europe,"Mon, 19 Mar 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldGFpbGRldGFpbC5ldS9uZXdzL2Zhc2hpb24vc3VpdGNhc2UtYnJhbmQtcmltb3dhLWNhbmNlbHMtYWxsLWRlYWxlci1jb250cmFjdHMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Suitcase brand Rimowa, part of luxury group LVMH since 2016, has stopped all of its dealer contracts. It wants to initiate a new procedure soon and only a fraction of the current dealers will get a new contract.

New contracts

The luxury suitcase brand made the decision after LVMH decided to restructure Rimowa’s sales: dealers will have to meet higher standards and in order to start with a clean slate, it decided to halt every contract. The goal is to end up with fewer dealers, but maintain closer ties to them. LVMH may want to give Rimowa a more exclusive image this way.

The German trade organization for leatherwear entrepreneurs has already investigated whether the termination of these contracts is in fact legal, but experts say it will be hard to fight, considering everyone is being treated equally: LVMH has found a loophole to only work with dealers it has chosen itself.

Several dealers in Belgium and the Netherlands will also lose their Rimowa deal. Van Beek Lederwaren feels lost after working with the brand for 45 years: “We hope we can come to a deal regarding a new contract”, Maarten van Beek told Dutch Couturekrant. “We will have to wait and see however.” 27 Dutch and 16 Belgian entrepreneurs have been hit by Rimowa’s actions. The brand also has its own stores in Antwerp and Amsterdam."
