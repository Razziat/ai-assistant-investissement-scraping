LVMH Inaugurates Hélios Beauty Research Center - WWD,"Mon, 18 Nov 2013 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3dkLmNvbS9iZWF1dHktaW5kdXN0cnktbmV3cy9iZWF1dHktZmVhdHVyZXMvbHZtaC1pbmF1Z3VyYXRlcy1uZXctYmVhdXR5LXJlc2VhcmNoLWNlbnRlci03MjgxNDgzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS — Bernard Arnault is a very hands-on luxury titan — occasionally even having a hand in architecture.

That’s the case with LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton’s new research facility for its fragrance and cosmetics activities, based just outside of Orléans, France. It is named after the Greek sun god, Hélios.

Officially inaugurated Monday when LVMH’s managing director Antonio Belloni snipped a ribbon, the triangular center comprises six, three-story buildings with a communal area at the center.

Arnault, LVMH’s chairman and chief executive officer, was involved in the project’s design, said Claude Martinez, president and ceo of Parfums Christian Dior.

From the outset, Arnault liked the shape, “which is quite unique because it favors and enhances the connection between the three key dimensions of what we are doing here, which is research, formulation and — [an element] getting more and more important — regulation,” said Martinez.

“He was really involved in the way we designed the roof,” said Martinez, of the transparent, skinlike structure. “[Arnault] was clearly involved in the facade, from the outside, and had the idea of having a second level of architecture.”

The 200,000-square-foot center in Saint Jean de Braye houses 250 research scientists from more than 20 disciplines, such as ethnobotany, which create some 1,200 products each year. It is focused primarily on the brands Parfums Christian Dior, Guerlain, Parfums Givenchy and Fresh — although other LVMH beauty labels are also involved.

LVMH invested between 30 million euros and 40 million euros, or $40.6 million and $54.1 million at current exchange, in its construction, according to the company.

Modern and streamlined in black, white and gray tones, the Arte Charpentier-designed building sits on a 55-hectare, or 135-acre, park and complies with France’s High Environmental Quality standard, which involves limiting the environmental impact a building has while ensuring its optimum interior living conditions. To build the structure, 200 trees were cut down but 450 were replanted, for instance.

From the central area, with its undulating roof, staircases lead up to the labs and there are steps downstairs, to a garden level where there is a library, forum and training or meeting rooms. Natural light floods into the entire building.

Raw materials are stored in its lowest level.

Hélios is located in the region know as “Cosmetic Valley,” which is also the name of a business cluster comprised of numerous beauty companies. With the organization, LVMH research will be working on a program that involves helping nurture some small and medium-size companies in the sector, and also includes Orléans University.

Hélios, which has been running since September, can accommodate up to 300 researchers.

New products generate between 20 percent and 25 percent of LVMH’s perfume and cosmetics revenues that in 2012 amounted to 3.61 billion euros, or $4.64 billion at average exchange. The division has about 200 patents and invests between 2.5 percent and 3 percent of its sales in research and development."
LVMH-Owned DFS Group Unveils T Galleria Hong Kong - Jing Daily,"Tue, 05 Nov 2013 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vamluZ2RhaWx5LmNvbS9wb3N0cy9sdm1oLW93bmVkLWRmcy1ncm91cC11bnZlaWxzLXQtZ2FsbGVyaWEtaG9uZy1rb25n0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"DFS' T Galleria location in Hong Kong.

Last week, the world's leading luxury travel retailer DFS Group installed the new T Galleria—a rebranding first unveiled in September at its Waikiki location—to its three downtown stores in Hong Kong. In a celebration taking place in both its founding city and global headquarters, the LVMH-owned retail group hosted a preview day along with a ""T in Art"" showcase in conjunction with the Hong Kong Tourism Board and celebrity guest Daniel Wu.

With 420 boutiques in 10 countries, DFS is the largest single retailer to Chinese consumers outside China, and of the $102 billion spent by travelers from China on international tourism in 2012, approximately 65 percent was shopping-related. This is no different in Hong Kong, where DFS stores in Tsim Sha Tsui East, Tsim Sha Tsui Canton Road, and Causeway Bay Hysan Place serve as retail havens for more than 18 million visitors a year, a majority of which are mainland Chinese. Together with the 48 retail spaces DFS operates at Hong Kong International Airport, the Group offers a comprehensive selection of categories, including beauty & fragrances, fashion & accessories, watches & jewelry, and wine & spirits.

At the Canton Road location in particular, DFS has recently enhanced its luxury brand selection with new renovations and offerings. In addition to opening several new boutiques, including DFS' first Tory Burch boutique in Hong Kong, the group has remodeled its beauty floor, adding personalized service options like its signature Beauty Concierge.

Philippe Schaus, CEO of DFS Group, notes that these changes did not come overnight, but have rather been an evolution over time. ""The launch of T Galleria follows several years of significant upgrades to our global store network and the introduction of highly personalized services that today have made our Gallerias luxury retail destinations unto themselves.""

DFS's marketing campaign featured other aspects to draw the attention of mainland Chinese travelers. By partnering with the Hong Kong Tourism Board, which recognizes the importance of attracting Chinese tourists, DFS has unveiled a new art platform for tourism in the city called ""T in Art"", which features giant sculptures of ""T's"" placed within the popular tourist attraction Avenue of the Stars. Various iconic Hong Kong artists and entrepreneurs were invited to design their own ""T"", including film director Patrick Kong, hotelier Yenn Wong, and actor Daniel Wu, who was first to unveil his ""T"" when he joined DFS on the preview day.

At the press conference on October 28th, Jing Daily talked to Benjamin Vuchot, regional president of Asia North for DFS, to learn more about the company's strategies to cater to the needs of the affluent Chinese traveler abroad. ""In the last 10 years, the sophistication of the Chinese affluent consumer and traveler has really risen substantially. Whereas we previously only had customers from Tier 1 cities like Beijing and Shanghai, now we are seeing newly rich customers from Tier 2, 3, 4, and even 5. As they are in different stages of their experience and education in luxury shopping, we have the unique opportunity to help educate them, some of whom are first-time travelers.""

Mr. Vuchot adds that for the affluent Chinese customer, ""exclusivity and first access are important, as is the authenticity of provenance, which DFS is able to guarantee."" Other services include VIP member's lounges, where guests can relax and enjoy warm egg tarts, find out what's new, and receive a curated experience from private shoppers. ""Customer experience is key for us and we're in the unique position to offer a consistent high quality of service for our VIP customers abroad, whether it’s in Macau, Hong Kong, Waikiki.""

In Hong Kong, personal shoppers are up to date on events and restaurant openings around town to be able to curate an all-around travel experience for customers, and in LA, a partnership with AEG allows exclusive access to sports and entertainment events for VIP customers. ""Our biggest challenge is to always understand who our customer is, and our Chinese customer is constantly evolving and extremely savvy. By being attentive to their needs, we are able to work closely with our brand partners to offer the right mix of products and deliver a superior experience every time."""

LVMH is putting all its big beauty labs under one silver roof at Hélios, its super science research centre in the Cosmetic Valley

BY Katy Young | 19 November 2013

LVMH, Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, have proven its ""commitment to the luxury perfumes and cosmetics industry in France,"" with a brand new state of the art research facility for its beauty division. Think the cosmetics equivalent of CERN's Hadron Collider.

Named after Greek God Hélios - ""in reference to the sun, an integral part of research in cosmetology"" says the brand - the R&D centre will be home to 250 researchers from Parfums Christian Dior, Guerlain, Givenchy Parfums and Fresh all dedicated to ""research, development and expertise"" in beauty.

Located in Saint-Jean-de-Braye, known as the Cosmetic Valley, Hélios has been 13 years in the making, stands at six three- storey buildings strong and spans 55 hectares, making it one of the largest production sites in beauty France has. ""It is an unparalleled facility for developing products that will meet the highest standards of quality. This state of the art facility is representative of the strategy of the Group and our ambition to consistently reinforce and expand the savoir-faire behind our businesses in France,"" says Bernard Arnault, chairman and CEO of the LVMH Group.

Proving just how competitive, and fast moving, the beauty industry is today, LVMH says Hélios will be concentrating on processes to secure new patents in science. The centre will work in more than 20 fields of research in beauty, including molecular and cell biology, physical chemistry, ethnobotany, formulation and toxicology. Even the architecture, all created by Arte Charpentier, which takes on the form of a triangle around a central atrium, has been designed to foster innovation and creativity - so the pressure is on.

According to WWD , LVMH put between $40.6 million and $54.1 million into Hélios - as well as 450 trees to replace the 200 it had to remove to create space.

But when you consider that new products generate up to 25 per cent of LVMH's perfume and cosmetics revenue, the maths is simple. ""The inauguration of our new Hélios research centre is a very positive development for our Perfumes and Cosmetics businesses,"" says Arnault. Indeed."
Fashion firm Loro Piana eyes future after takeover - Yahoo Finance,"Tue, 05 Nov 2013 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSWh0dHA6Ly9maW5hbmNlLnlhaG9vLmNvbS9uZXdzL2Zhc2hpb24tZmlybS1sb3JvLXBpYW5hLWV5ZXMtMTUyNzQ0MzUyLmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"In this photo taken on Monday, Sept. 10, 2013 Pierluigi Loro Piana gestures during an interview in Milan, Italy.

MILAN (AP) -- Loro Piana, an Italian luxury textiles maker and fashion house, is so particular about its materials that it bought its own natural reserve in the mountains of Peru to protect the vicuna, an endangered species that yields a precious wool.

Such master of the supply chain, which brings it to Myanmar to extract minuscule fibers from the lotus flower and Mongolia for baby cashmere, has earned it customers willing to pay $20,000 for a vicuna coat. It also caught the attention of the French luxury conglomerate LVMH, which this summer agreed to pay 2 billion euros ($2.7 billion) for an 80 percent stake in the six-generation family-run company.

From Loro Piana's side, the deal was a bid for continuity by a family-run company facing a generational shift while reaching for scale for future growth.

""What we were concerned about is that the company would be able to develop, and we believe that through the collaboration with the LVMH group this goal can be easily achieved,"" Pier Luigi Loro Piana, the chairman and co-CEO of his company, said in a recent interview. He and his brother Sergio have remained at the helm for an unspecified transition period.

The company, based in the northern Italian region of Piedmont, is already one of the world's largest producers of luxury textiles, with 4.5 million meters in 2012. And it has had double-digit growth — from 478 million euros in revenues in 2010 to 627 million euros last year.

But the deal will guarantee a solid level of captive business, as Loro Piana's 250 clients include brands already owned by LVMH, Pier Luigi said.

Italy's fashion industry is comprised primarily of small family-run companies, and the recession has hurt those who don't make most of their sales abroad. The Italian fashion world has likewise been reluctant to aggregate into conglomerates that can better weather shifting global crises — leaving fashion houses trying to secure their future to look primarily abroad for solutions.

Story continues

Loro Piana's new owner, whose full name is LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SA, already has a portfolio of Italian firms acquired over the years, including the Fendi fashion house and Bulgari jewelers. Its rival conglomerate, Kering, is also French and has such brands as Gucci and Bottega Veneta. The two have been among the most successful buyers of Italian fashion houses thanks to an approach that favors aggregating businesses that complement each other.

Not all fashion transitions have been smooth. Valentino and Gianfranco Ferre, for example, have experienced some turbulence, with multiple owners accompanying changes in the creative direction in the void left by the eponymous owners.

Pier Luigi Loro Piana said he was pleasantly surprised by LVMH CEO Bernard Arnault's interest in the company's supply chain control and, in particular, their efforts to preserve the vicuna. The company established a reserve in Peru for vicuna, camelids that were almost poached to extinction in the 1960s, doubling their numbers to 2,000 over five years. This year, Loro Piana bought a majority stake in a company in Argentina that has 6,000 free-range vicunas.

""I was pleasantly surprised by how much interest Mr. Arnault and his collaborators took in our capacity to control the entire chain,"" Loro Piana said. ""I was a little worried about this but instead I have seen a strong interest.""

A commitment to those projects, he said, will help guarantee Loro Piana's future — both as a source of jobs in Italy and profits for its French owners.

It's a formula that is finding acceptance in the Italian fashion world.

""We are a little unhappy when Italian companies are bought by outsiders,"" Milan fashion chamber president Mario Boselli said. ""But it must be said if we look at the history of Italian companies that have been bought by the two French groups, they are stories of cohesion and success that we can only acknowledge positively.

""Chapeau,"" he said, using the French expression for ""Hats off."""

Hermès' Patrick Thomas: A high-fashion balancing act - The Globe and Mail,"Fri, 22 Nov 2013 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikQFodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGVnbG9iZWFuZG1haWwuY29tL3JlcG9ydC1vbi1idXNpbmVzcy9jYXJlZXJzL2NhcmVlcnMtbGVhZGVyc2hpcC9oZXJtZXMtcGF0cmljay10aG9tYXMtYS1oaWdoLWZhc2hpb24tYmFsYW5jaW5nLWFjdC9hcnRpY2xlMTU1NzQzMTQv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Patrick Thomas, CEO of Hermès SA.Anthony Jenkins/The Globe and Mail Share

When it comes to business, Patrick Thomas is a family man.

The chief executive of luxury purveyor Hermès SA has held top positions at a series of family dynasties. In each case, he's been the outsider brought in by the clan to help transform their business, run it better and give talented design officials room to breathe.

He sees himself as an entrepreneur who has a hand in shaping their vision. He leaves the critical design work – such as developing the trademark Hermès silk scarves priced at up to $1,370 a pop – to others.

""If you ask me to design the Hermès scarves, Hermès will go bankrupt,"" he says with a smile.

Far from being bankrupt, Hermès of Paris, known for its $8,000 to $50,000 Birkin and Kelly handbags, has enjoyed healthy financial gains despite the uncertainty surrounding the global economy and China, which is still a bastion of big spenders.

As the first non-family member to head Hermès, Mr. Thomas's success has depended on ultra-wealthy customers who still are ready to drop $170,000 for a diamond-studded leather bag.

By next year, the 66-year-old Mr. Thomas will hand the reins back to a family member – Axel Dumas, 43, part of the sixth generation – leaving at least one key file open. Hermès has been locked in a legal spat with rival luxury powerhouse LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton SA over its having bought a minority stake in Hermès in late 2010.

LVMH's tactic of amassing a large interest in Hermès through complex cash-settled equity swaps, a strategy used by hedge funds to launch hostile takeovers of publicly traded companies without disclosure, angered the usually mild-mannered Mr. Thomas, who led the battle to keep LVMH at bay.

The wrangling seems out of character for Mr. Thomas, who speaks English with a French accent. He displays impeccable politeness and evenness during our almost two-hour late lunch at the appropriately posh Canoe restaurant, on the 54th floor of a downtown Toronto office tower with an unfettered view of Lake Ontario. For someone who deals with the most opulent of merchandise, he comes across as down to earth, calling some of the bejewelled six-figure handbag prices ""crazy.""

""I'm not a man of luxury,"" he says simply, even as he's dressed head-to-toe in understated Hermès garb, including the loafers. ""I like quality.""

He doesn't like a fight, but he can fight with the best of them, he says as he dips his spoon in the squash soup, garnished with a dab of sheep's milk yogurt.

""I'm not a man of conflict,"" he asserts. ""I'm ready to have a conflict if necessary – I showed it against LVMH, but I'm not creating conflict. On the contrary, I'm trying to create consensus as much as I can. But I can fight from time to time, if necessary.""

That includes ruffling family feathers at Hermès. At one point, he let go two of its members – there are five left in the company now – although he won't provide details and doesn't want the matter to be reported. ""I said to them, 'You are not performing, you have to go'… I had to make some difficult family decisions.""

As the outsider, Mr. Thomas aimed to give Hermès more structure and put it on a more daring path. He's a big believer in family companies that have spawned iconic names such as Saab, Mercedes, Vuitton and Hermès. He feels like a member of the Hermès family, admires it for thinking long term rather than just quarter to quarter, and for taking care of its employees, he says. He hand-picked his successor and, while the family gave him leeway to choose another outsider, he opted for Mr. Dumas, who is ""brilliant,"" Mr. Thomas says. ""He was born in the suit – we say that in French.""

His entrepreneurial and family-business bent is in his blood. He was born in the Burgundy region of France to a family of winemakers; his father went on to develop a fruit juice company. That firm, Pampryl, was acquired by Pernod Ricard, the French spirits concern and one of the companies that Mr. Thomas worked for after he graduated from the prestigious École Supérieure de Commerce de Paris.

His first job was with U.S.-based International Telephone & Telegraph in Paris in 1971, where he spent two years and learned a life lesson. ""I got so bored that I said, 'I can't,' because it was working in administration – a boring administration – and I didn't want to work in a boring admin. I wanted to be an entrepreneur in a company where I could develop some talents.""

That's when he joined family-owned Pernod Ricard, where he stayed for about 16 years before moving on to Hermès in 1989, becoming group managing director while its chairman, the charismatic Jean-Louis Dumas – the uncle of Axel – was in control of product development and artistic style. Design has never been part of Mr. Thomas's responsibilities.

""I don't have the talent,"" he explains. ""You don't say to [fashion designer] Mr. [Yves] St. Laurent, 'Please take this skirt from your collection and put in something else.' It doesn't work like that. Now, if you think the guy is no good, then you change him.""

He worked closely with Mr. Dumas, but in 1997 got the opportunity to head the high-end division of French-based cosmetics company Lancaster, controlled by the Benckiser family. At Hermès, Mr. Dumas ""was only 50-something and I knew I wouldn't succeed him before a long time,"" Mr. Thomas says. Mr. Dumas died in May, 2010.

Lancaster subsequently offered him a promotion in New York, but he declined. He and his wife, who has a farm in France, were rooted in the country. He loves nature – walking in the wild, climbing mountains and bird watching – a lifestyle he saw as clashing with the one in the Big Apple.

""I didn't want to go to New York – that's why I said no. But I never left any company on bad terms.""

He moved on to William Grant & Sons Ltd., the first non-family member to take the helm of the liquor group, where he stayed for a few years before returning to Hermès in 2003.

He visited Toronto recently to open the Festival des Métiers, a five-day exhibition that Hermès puts on in various cities around the world to show how its craftsmen make its signature colourful scarves, Birkin bags and other handmade delicacies. It's the kind of marketing initiative that Mr. Thomas encourages as he shifts spending to these kinds of efforts rather than traditional advertising to reach the 1-per-cent target market more efficiently.

This year, Canada is Hermès's fastest growing market, he says. Its president, Jennifer Carter, a three-decade-plus company veteran, is Hermès's longest serving country leader. A wealthy Asian population and tourists helped spur sales at the four Canadian stores, two of them in Holt Renfrew & Co., and an e-commerce site, he says.

Founded in 1837 by French harness maker Thierry Hermès, who produced for royal houses in Europe, Hermès added more product categories to its portfolio over the decades. Grandson Émile-Maurice recruited his friends Louis Renault and Ettore Bugatti to make trunks for cars, furniture and then belts and fashions.

Through marriage, new branches of the family developed with the names Guerrand, Puech and Dumas. But it wasn't until 1978, when Jean-Louis Dumas was named CEO and creative director that, with the help of two cousins, Hermès got a shot of adrenalin. It relaunched the Kelly handbag and designed another one to British actress Jane Birkin's specifications. It ran stylish ads, and refurbished stores.

Even during the downturn, when other luxury houses suffered, Hermès continued to post financial gains. Over the seven years to 2012, Hermès's profit soared almost 200 per cent to more than $1-billion, while revenues jumped 144 per cent to almost $5-billion.

As Mr. Thomas sees it, the world of upscale purveyors is divided into the ostentatious – ""bling bling"" – and the others, including Hermès, which represent refined quality and the ""search for perfection."" Hermès has resisted the temptation to boost profits by having its goods made in China, as other high-end houses do.

""If the family tells me, 'We want to double the profit,' I can do it, I don't need LVMH,"" Mr. Thomas says. ""Introduce bags with a big H, at $1,500 each, and we will triple the sales and it will be an industrial bag and the sales will go through the roof and the profit will be doubled or tripled and in five years you don't have Hermès, you have another company. It will be the same name, but the future and quality will have disappeared.""

But for all its catering to the well-off consumer, Mr. Thomas has tried to bring a measure of democracy to Hermès. About five years ago, he dropped the practice of putting customers on waiting lists for products.

""If you want a Mercedes, they will tell you nine months. At Hermès, you say five years – it's ridiculous … People think we organize the scarcity, but we don't.""

Rather, the company is limited by the number of artisans it can train to make its wares – there are 3,000 today in 12 workshops in France, he says. Still, a customer who orders an exotic yellow crocodile skin bag will probably have to wait a while. ""You cannot grow a crocodile faster than nature.""

His biggest challenge has been having to moderate the company's growth ""in order to accept zero compromise in the product quality,"" he says. ""It's very tempting to accelerate the growth with this company because it's like a very powerful engine.""

But he also has pushed unlikely new projects, including backing Shang Xia, a Chinese brand which aims to challenge the view that Chinese-made goods are poor quality. He will remain as chairman of Shang Xia when he retires from Hermès.

He even oversaw the development of a vast, $130-million (U.S.) ecologically sustainable yacht – something of a floating mansion – in partnership with shipbuilder Wally, which Hermès has now abandoned after selling none. ""We have significant profitability, so we can afford some audacious moves,"" he says. ""It was very good for the image of the company. Image is always a balance between modernity and tradition. Life is always a balance – the yin and the yang.""

=====================================

CURRICULUM VITAE

Personal:

Age: 66. Born June 16, 1947.

Education:

Graduate of École Supérieure de Commerce de Paris.

Career:

In 1973, joined Pernod Ricard Group, where he held the positions of secretary general of the subsidiary JFA Pampryl, director of finance and administration of Pernod Ricard and managing director of Pernod Ricard Great Britain.

In 1989, joined Hermès International as managing director. From 1997 to 2000, he was chief executive officer of the beauty company Lancaster Group. From 2000 to 2003 chief executive officer of William Grant & Sons Ltd.

In 2003, he rejoined the Hermès Group as managing director and was named chief executive officer in 2004.

In his own words:

""The customer of Hermès is not coming to a Hermès store to find an average product. They come to find something exceptional: A, because it's expensive so people are not going to pay crazy prices for things which are average. B, because they trust Hermès for making unique things, in terms of quality.""

""From time to time when I see, for instance, in our warehouse, the selection of the hides and I say that we are crazy – we are so demanding, in terms of quality, that from time to time it's a little bit too much. But I think that's basically the ethics of the company. I don't want to change it.""

""You have different ways of being an entrepreneur, you can create your own company or manage the company of others. You know this job of Hermès is quite exciting, it's one of the most beautiful jobs I could dream of and, believe me, it's not only administration, it's quite entrepreneurial.""

""Being an entrepreneur is not to have the idea yourself, it's to encourage people to have ideas... Entrepreneurship is a spirit in a company, it's not a man. It's like innovation – you don't innovate because you have a creative guy in the company, innovating is a spirit which has to be shared by a company.""

""I think the rule of families is quite essential in business development. I see myself as an entrepreneur to develop the company and today Hermès is much better equipped after my 10 years of leadership to cope with growth in the years to come than it was before.

The 25sq m airside space (right and bottom), which will remain in place until 27th February, sits in a prime corner position, next to World Duty Free Group’s duty free and travel retail store, and across from a string of luxury boutiques past which most passengers go to get to their gates.

The Hennessy boutique – the first to be created outside France’s Cognac region – is a partnership between WDFG, landlord Heathrow Airport and the 250-year-old Cognac house, part of France’s LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton.

It showcases a series of special products, many of them limited editions including Hennessy XO Collector’s Edition (£195/$311) and Hennessy Private Collection 4 (£50/$79.70). The latter, after one week’s trading, is the current bestseller although the super-premium lines are expected to sell well in the run-up to Christmas. A travel exclusive product, Hennessy Privé will also be available priced at £285 ($455).

RUSSIANS & NIGERIANS ARE BIGGEST SPENDERS

The passenger profile of T5 appealed to the LVMH brand while Heathrow says it was “delighted to make the necessary space available to Hennessy” in its main shopping mall. The Cognac house tells TRBusiness that based on value sales in T5, about 52% goes to passengers on Russian flights, 38% to Nigerians, followed by the Chinese and Americans.

The boutique’s arresting design by France’s Mathieu Lehanneur – renowned for creating objects and architecture that blend design, science, art and technology – is open plan to show off a spectacular crystal ‘orgue’ centrepiece (left). This displays various precious eaux de vie with vintages ranging from the 1920s to the 1970s. The importance of the Russians and Chinese is amply demonstrated by the fact that scripts on the orgue are in these nationals’ respective languages (right).

Hennessy has relied on the skills of seven generations of cellar masters from the Fillioux family to build up what it claims are “the most remarkable reserves of rare eaux-de-vie in the world”.

Guillaume Reslou (left), Moët Hennessy Senior Travel Retail Key Accounts Manager, says: “This boutique is the first of its kind and offers a truly premium spirit experience for Heathrow travellers, particularly the rare opportunity to taste vintage eaux de vie in this unique environment. The detail that has gone into every element of the customer experience in the pop-up store is first class and demonstrates the lengths Hennessy goes to for perfection.”

The store incorporates all the latest technology, including LED and 3D screens and iPads to make the experience interactive and informative. Nine specially-trained staff, from both WDFG and agencies, several of whom speak Russian, Nigerian and Mandarin, man the boutique to offer passengers a range of VIP services and tastings that cannot be found anywhere outside of the Hennessy Maison in Cognac.

LANGUAGE SKILLS

Nigel Sandals (right), UK Category Manager for Liquor at WDFG, says: “The aim of this unique pop-up store is to enable customers to explore the full range of Hennessy Cognacs at their leisure, while being guided by specialist staff that we have hand-selected for their Cognac knowledge and language skills.

“The digital aspects of the installation enable us to adapt and tailor the offer to different passenger groups and purchasing occasions – Christmas gifting, Chinese New Year and Valentine’s Day. We are excited to see how this installation – the first of its kind – performs over the coming months.”

Passengers who experience the full tasting – which can be booked in advance to guarantee availability – will receive a personalised Hennessy certificate of authenticity, as a keepsake. Hennessy, which sells 50m bottles of Cognac a year worldwide, is even making its top-end Paradis Imperial, which sells for over £1,500, available for tasting. Last January, WDFG sold 12 of the bottles ahead of Chinese New Year."
Nicolas Ghesquiere is the new Creative Director at Louis Vuitton - iDiva.com,"Tue, 05 Nov 2013 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmlkaXZhLmNvbS9mYXNoaW9uL2hvdy10by9uaWNvbGFzLWdoZXNxdWllcmUtaXMtdGhlLW5ldy1jcmVhdGl2ZS1kaXJlY3Rvci1hdC1sb3Vpcy12dWl0dG9uLzI1NDU00gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Nicolas Ghesquiere takes over from Marc Jacobs as creative director of LV ready-to-wear for women

Nicolas Ghesquiere was seen as the front-runner to replace Marc Jacobs who announced his departure from Louis Vuitton last month to focus on developing and floating his eponymous fashion business.

Ghesquiere will design Louis Vuitton's ready-to-wear and some of its fashion accessories, but will not be involved with permanent bag collections such as the Neverfull, the Speedy or the new higher-end series like the Capucines, which cost €3,500 a piece.

""Ghesquiere, one of the favourite designers of the most sophisticated fashion insiders, could positively contribute to the repositioning of the brand towards more exclusivity,"" said Mario Ortelli, luxury goods analyst at brokerage Bernstein.

The appointment follows a series of leadership changes at Louis Vuitton, LVMH's biggest source of revenue and profit, aimed at helping the brand regain some of its lost prestige as sales growth more than halved over the past year.

Last month, Louis Vuitton hired Darren Spaziani, former Proenza Schouler accessories designer, to beef up its high-end offering of leather bags.

Earlier this year, Delphine Arnault, daughter of LVMH founder and chief executive Bernard Arnault, became deputy head of Louis Vuitton while last year, LVMH veteran Michael Burke replaced the brand's longstanding chief Yves Carcelle.

Expectations from the Ghesquiere Era

Louis Vuitton, the biggest luxury brand with more than €7.3 billion in annual sales, has seen sales growth steadily drop, hit by cooling demand in Asia and consumers' growing preference for no-logo products.

It has pruned its collection of logo bags, widened its offering of expensive leather bags and slowed down its store network expansion to tackle the perception that it is too ubiquitous. But the transition took its toll on growth.

Last month, Louis Vuitton posted an estimated 2 percent rise in third-quarter sales year-on-year, much lower than expected, rekindling worries about how long it would take for it to fight back and return to higher growth rates which have stood above 10 percent in the past two decades.

Louis Vuitton said Ghesquiere ""will bring a modern creative vision to the House's women's collections."" He will present his first collection in March 2014.

During his 15-year tenure at Balenciaga, Ghesquiere, 42, is widely credited with having helped turn the fashion label into one of the fastest-growing and most profitable brands of parent Kering. Kering, formerly known as PPR, also owns Gucci, Yves Saint Laurent and Bottega Veneta.

""This is good news, as he is well known to be both creative and respect the brand DNA, which is just what is needed,"" said Luca Solca, luxury goods analyst at Exane BNP Paribas.

Concerns about Louis Vuitton's future growth have weighed on the valuation of parent LVMH, which has been one of the worst performers of the luxury goods industry.

LVMH shares have risen just under 2 percent since January 1, while the European luxury goods sector gained more than 25 percent.
