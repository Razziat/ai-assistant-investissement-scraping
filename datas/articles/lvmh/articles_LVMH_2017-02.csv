LVMH-Supreme Acquisition Rumours Unfounded | BoF - The Business of Fashion,"Thu, 09 Feb 2017 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzb2ZmYXNoaW9uLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy9sdXh1cnkvbHZtaC1zdXByZW1lLWFxdWlzaXRpb24tcnVtb3Vycy11bmZvdW5kZWQv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LONDON, United Kingdom — On Thursday, a report that LVMH was rumoured have bought Supreme for $500 million surfaced, adding to further speculation that interest in the streetwear brand is heating up.

Sources close to LVMH said that the report was an unfounded rumour and denied a possible deal between the French luxury conglomerate and the cult streetwear label, despite a collaboration between Louis Vuitton and Supreme, unveiled at Paris Menswear Week in January.

A spokesperson for LVMH said the company had no comment. A spokesperson for Supreme confirmed that the news was a ""rumour that was started online.""

The rumours were also cast in doubt by an Instagram post from Kim Hastreiter, co-founder of Paper magazine and a close friend of Supreme founder James Jebbia, that said: ""Rumour racing around. Likely not true (yet).""

Though the reports were denied, this is not the first acquisition rumour to circulate around Supreme. Certainly, the addition of Supreme to a global conglomerate’s stable could provide a number of interesting synergies. For instance, Supreme’s mastery in creating hype around its products is something LVMH could learn from.

""In the fashion landscape today, to be a truly successful company, you need to have a very strong cultural consumer base, something Supreme excels at,"" Geoff Cook, partner at branding studio Base Design told BoF.

""In terms of the quality of product [from Supreme] and tightly controlling the distribution, that is actually very similar to the way luxury brands operate and I think that the LVMHs of the world could learn a lot from that.""

The rumours come as LVMH announced last Friday it had set up a new venture aimed at investing in small fashion, cosmetics and accessories companies with high growth potential. LVMH Luxury Ventures will buy stakes in luxury firms with sales between €2 million and €5 million and comes as the luxury giant is slowly expanding its portfolio in order to tap the growing consumer base seeking experiences rather than products.

In October 2016, for instance, LVMH announced it had purchased an 80 percent stake in suitcase maker Rimowa for $640 million. And in December, the company's investment arm, L Catterton Europe, signed a deal to acquire a majority stake in Italian bicycle maker Pinarello.

""It is becoming more and more interesting for conglomerates to look at companies at an earlier stage, mainly because of the [relevance of] the internet and because smaller companies are able to scale very quickly,"" said Cook. ""Acquiring Supreme would be an exceptional deal for LVMH or any number of other companies.""

While Supreme creates seasonal collections, its weekly drops generate so much interest that entire forums are dedicated to celebrating purchases and guessing which particular pieces will sell out first. Traffic to the brand's website can spike by as much as 16,800 percent on the first ""drop day"" of a new season, Samuel Spitzer, who leads Supreme's e-commerce operation, told BoF in a previous interview.

""In terms of brand equity, and what they have built, it's extraordinary,"" said Cary Leitzes, founder of creative agency Leitzes & Co. ""They have an unbelievable product and brand.

""From an audience play, their demographic is so engaged, so not only does Supreme have a following, but it's a loyal following and it's with such a high engagement. And tapping into that millennial audience and that streetwear audience is a whole new demographic for a company like LVMH.""

""It would give them the opportunity to grow them up to their other brands and help them diversify their portfolio,"" she added.

Editors' Note: An earlier version of this article stated that the Louis Vuitton and Supreme collaboration was unveiled at Paris Couture Week. This is incorrect. It was unveiled during Paris Menswear Week.

Disclosure: LVMH is part of a group of investors who, together, hold a minority interest in The Business of Fashion. All investors have signed shareholders’ documentation guaranteeing BoF’s complete editorial independence.

Bernard Arnault, head of French luxury goods giant LVMH , says he expects victory for either Emmanuel Macron or Francois Fillon in the French presidential elections over far-right rival Marine Le Pen. ""My take is one of the two will win!"" responded LVMH's joint chairman and chief executive officer when asked whether he was concerned that there are only two so-called 'market-friendly' candidates still in the race to secure the French presidency this May. Arnault, the country's richest man and a prominent figure among French society, was speaking to CNBC at the VIVA TECH conference in Paris about the importance of the digital revolution to long-established and traditional companies such as LVMH.

""In our group, the start-up spirit is key for the success of management…Even in a large brand, we should keep the proprietary spirit of the founder,"" he began, describing the key to success as the securing of a link ""between the heritage and the future."" Arnault referred to initiatives such as the connected watch, which it launched in 2015 with Tag Heuer, and gave a preview of other high-tech wearable projects, adding ""we have a new version coming on the market very soon and it's a real watch with a lot of modern equipment."" The renowned investor and art collector said he found it appropriate that the tech conference was taking place within the Elysee Palace, the official residence of the French President since 1848.

Marcolin Says It Plans Joint Venture With LVMH - Vision Monday,"Wed, 01 Feb 2017 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZpc2lvbm1vbmRheS5jb20vbGF0ZXN0LW5ld3MvYXJ0aWNsZS9tYXJjb2xpbi1zYXlzLWl0LXBsYW5zLWpvaW50LXZlbnR1cmUtd2l0aC1sdm1oLTEv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"





MILAN—In a statement on its website posted late yesterday, Marcolin S.p.A. said that LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton (LVMH:PA) the France-based global luxury goods group, will set up a design and manufacturing joint venture with the group.Marcolin's statement said it would begin to make eyewear for LVMH's Celine and Louis Vuitton brands starting in 2018, aiming to become the French group's ""preferred partner in the eyeglass business.""LVMH will own 51 percent and Marcolin the rest of the proposed joint venture. As part of the deal, LVMH will subscribe to a reserved €22 million ($24 million) capital increase at Marcolin, taking a stake of around 10 percent.Marcolin's statement read, ""The Company has today entered into a joint venture agreement with LVMH pursuant to which, subject to certain conditions and approvals, the proposed JV will, starting in 2018, design and manufacture eyewear for the Celine and Louis Vuitton brands, with aim of becoming, in the future, the preferred partner of LVMH in the eyewear business. LVMH and the Company will control, respectively, 51 percent and 49 percent of the share capital of the proposed JV. In total, we estimate our equity contributions to the start-up costs, capital expenditures and working capital requirements of the JV will be between €20 million and €25 million over the course of the next four to five years, of which we expect to fund approximately €7 million in 2017.“Pursuant to the JVA, the capital requirements of the JV will be funded as and when required by (i) direct or indirect pro rata equity contributions by Marcolin and LVMH and/or (ii) debt financing incurred by the JV for a maximum amount of €45 million (or 50 percent of the JV’s financing needs), which is expected to be non-recourse with respect to Marcolin and its subsidiaries. Marcolin will also provide distribution and transitional and other support services required in connection with setting up the JV,” according to Marcolin’s statement.Marcolin said that its board approved the refinancing of the existing notes through the issuance of new senior secured non-convertible notes up to a total amount of €250 million, expected to mature in 2023. Additional funds for the refinancing will be available through drawings under a new super senior revolving credit facility, which will be available for borrowings up to an aggregate principal amount of €40 million and amounts expected to be received through a capital increase of €21.9 million in connection with the formation of the proposed joint venture.“The capital increase is contingent on the approval of the proposed JV by European Union anti-trust authorities and other standard closing conditions, which may not occur. Additionally, the partial repayment of certain of the Company’s short and medium term financings will not occur immediately upon the issuance of the notes, and we expect such repayments will be made, in part, using amounts received from the capital increase,” the Marcolin statement said.There was no further comment from Marcolin or LVMH this morning, although there had been previously published reports citing sources in the financial markets about a pending agreement between the two companies. VMail will provide further details as they become available."
LVMH Supreme Purchase Rumors False - HYPEBEAST,"Thu, 09 Feb 2017 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiPmh0dHBzOi8vaHlwZWJlYXN0LmNvbS8yMDE3LzIvbHZtaC1zdXByZW1lLXB1cmNoYXNlLXJ1bW9yLWZhbHNl0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Rumors of LVMH, the congomerate company owning Louis Vuitton, purchasing New York streetwear imprint Supreme spread like wildfire when it was announced. As fast as it reached fashion industry eyes and ears, the quicker the response came from those in-the-know that the rumors, were just that — rumors and had no factual basis. The original source claimed their “connections in the industry have come through with something far, far juicier: LVMH, the luxury conglomerate that owns Louis Vuitton, just bought Supreme for $500 million USD.”

According to Business of Fashion, “sources close to LVMH said that the report was an unfounded rumour and denied a possible deal between the French luxury conglomerate and the cult streetwear label.” BoF reached for a comment directly from an LVMH spokesperson, but had no response. As for Supreme, its spokesperson went on to say that the purchase announcement was a “rumor that was started online.”

Other respected industry figures were also quick to chime in. Vanessa Friedman of The New York Times and INYT simply put, “this is not true” on Twitter. Matthew Schneier, style reporter of The New York Times also tweeted that he “spoke to Jebbia, Supreme founder/owner,” and that the rumors were “not true.” In addition, also according to BoF, Kim Hastreiter, co-founder of Paper magazine and friend of James Jebbia captioned an image of the source’s headline with “Rumour racing around. Likely not true (yet).” So interpret Hastreiter’s caption however you want.

Conclusively, LVMH purchasing Supreme isn’t so farfetched. The Supreme x Louis Vuitton collaboration that was revealed during Paris Men’s Fashion Week is prime evidence of both brands placing themselves in an advantageous position. Both LVMH and Supreme would undoubtedly draw consumers from the worlds of streetwear, skate and high fashion. Plus, Supreme has already made products with Italian luxury house Loro Piana (an LVMH brand) and opened its last store in Paris, the central hub of luxury shopping and the base of operations for LVMH.

In the end, we’ll all just have to now wait and see if LVMH will even react to the rumors. Maybe the loud rumblings around the internet caused by the unfounded announcement will persuade them to actually purchase the iconic New York skate brand.

Voltaire Foundation secures a luxurious partnership - University of Oxford,"Mon, 06 Feb 2017 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm94LmFjLnVrL25ld3MvYXJ0cy1ibG9nL3ZvbHRhaXJlLWZvdW5kYXRpb24tc2VjdXJlcy1sdXh1cmlvdXMtcGFydG5lcnNoaXDSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Oxford University's Voltaire Foundation has formed a new and surprising partnership.

Their ambitious project to publish the Complete Works of Voltaire is now being supported by LVMH Moët Hennessy, Louis Vuitton and Bernard Arnault, its Chairman and CEO.

The global luxury goods brand will donate a substantial amount over the next three years to support the Voltaire Foundation as it researches and publishes the final volumes in the Complete Works of Voltaire.

The 18th-century French writer Voltaire is an iconic figure in European culture, and his thinking about freedom of expression and religious tolerance lies at the heart of Western liberal democracy.

The Complete Works is the most ambitious project in French literature currently being undertaken outside France. It aims to publish all of Voltaire’s writings with expert commentary alongside the texts. When the project is completed in 2019, it will amount to more than 200 volumes.

The next edition to be published includes key Voltaire texts such as Micromegas, a science-fiction tale about a planet-hopping giant’s visit to our world which Voltaire uses as a commentary on the society in which he lived, and man’s place in the universe.

Professor Nicholas Cronk, Director of the Voltaire Foundation at Oxford University, said: 'We are very appreciative of this supportive endorsement from such a well-known French company whose high-profile, iconic brands match the world-class cultural aspirations of our ambitious project.

'When the Complete Works of Voltaire is published in its entirety, it will change fundamentally the way we think about the Enlightenment and the importance of the Enlightenment in the modern world.'

Bernard Arnault, Chairman & CEO of the LVMH Group, said: 'The driving force for the LVMH Group’s success is based on extracting value from a unique heritage and stimulating modern day creativity and excellence.

'The unprecedented project carried out by the Voltaire Foundation to publish the complete works of Voltaire follows a similar path as it aims to make available and to promote one of the most outstanding thinkers of the 18th century, to enlighten our times. It is with pride and gratitude to the Oxford University that we embark on this adventure.'"

T. Barnum and is regarded as a visionary after guiding rejuvenations of Blancpain, Hublot and Tag Heuer. To the extent that the Swiss watch industry has a Steve Jobs, Jean-Claude Biver is it.

But even if Mr. Biver, 68 the president of the LVMH watch division, is considered the industry’s leading turnaround artist, he has his work cut out for him. After profits stalled at Zenith, the voluble executive shook up management and installed himself as the acting chief executive of this venerable but sleepy watch brand.

Mr. Biver spoke recently about his plans to give Zenith the same sizzle as its sister brands, Tag Heuer and Hublot, and about a modern line that will debut at Baselworld next month.

Q. Why is Zenith highly regarded by watch buffs?

A. The brand was created in 1865, so it’s quite an old brand. And they have won 2,233 chronometry prizes for their precision. It’s one of their specialties, precision. In 1969, they introduced the first movement that could measure a 10th of a second. It was called “El Primero,” which means “the first.” It became famous because it was used in the Rolex Daytona watch."

She replaces Marco Gobbetti, who left the house last year to take up the same position at Burberry.

Merle joins the house from another of LVMH's labels, menswear brand Berluti, where she is currently executive vice president, reports WWD. When she takes up her new position on April 1, she will report to Pierre-Yves Roussel, chairman and CEO of LVMH Fashion Group, who has been filling the breach at Céline since Gobbetti's departure. Merle has plenty of experience with the inner workings of LVMH brands, having previously worked at Kenzo and Louis Vuitton.

“We see this as a smooth transition building on the project and continuing the momentum of the brand,” Roussel said of Merle's appointment. “Séverine represents a good fit with the culture of the brand.”

Also new for the brand is its decision to launch e-commerce under Merle's watchful eye. Having held out until now, the brand is said to be introducing the retail platform later this year.

“We believe it's important that we show the breadth and depth of the collection,” Roussel continued. “We want to be very product focused. It's always been the motto of creative director Phoebe Philo since the very beginning.”
