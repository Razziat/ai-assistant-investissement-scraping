LVMH Revenue Down 38% in the Second Quarter - The Business of Fashion,"Mon, 27 Jul 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzb2ZmYXNoaW9uLmNvbS9uZXdzL2x1eHVyeS9sdm1oLXNlY29uZC1xdWFydGVyLXJlc3VsdHMtcmV2ZW51ZS1sdXh1cnktbG91aXMtdnVpdHRvbi_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS, France — LVMH's customers are curbing purchases of high-end fashion faster than the company can cut costs, and that's hitting the Louis Vuitton owner's profit.

The French luxury conglomerate’s profit from recurring operations totalled €1.67 billion ($1.96 billion) in the first half, less than the €2.32 billion analysts expected. The shares fell as much as 4 percent early Tuesday in Paris.

With boutiques shut down worldwide and international tourism largely halted, revenue fell 38 percent on an organic basis in the three months through June, the company said in a statement on Monday. Chief Financial Officer Jean-Jacques Guiony said LVMH slashed operating costs by 29 percent.

“LVMH showed relative resilience at the revenue level in the first half of the year,” said Luca Solca, an analyst at Bernstein. “On the profit side, it’s obvious that it’s not been able to slash costs with the same pace as the revenue decline due to the fixed-cost base.”

LVMH follows Richemont and Burberry in reporting what analysts expect will be the industry's worst quarter ever because of the pandemic. The company cited signs of recovery across several businesses in June and a particularly strong rebound in China, and said it expects further improvement in July.

The company reacted “swiftly to the adverse situation,” Guiony said on a call with analysts. “We expect to keep the cost base under control.”

Tiffany Contract

Guiony said in an interview with Le Figaro that LVMH still expects to respect the contract signed for its planned purchase of jeweller Tiffany & Co.

“Tiffany’s results are clearly affected by the crisis,” the chief financial officer told Le Figaro. “That said, we have signed a contract and we will respect it.”

Guiony told analysts on the call that LVMH is still waiting for about half a dozen antitrust approvals for the Tiffany deal, adding that “things are moving forward.”

Sales at LVMH’s fashion and leather goods unit, which includes top brand Louis Vuitton, fell 37 percent in the quarter. Analysts expected a 38 percent decline. Louis Vuitton management increased prices globally by 5 percent in late June and early this month, Guiony said.

While shoppers are increasingly turning to online purchases, the luxury industry has notoriously been slow to generate more revenue that way. LVMH noted a “significant acceleration” in online sales in the first half, which only partially offset the store closures.

PARIS – LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton said net profit plummeted 84 percent in the first six months of the year, although it forecasts a gradual recovery in the second half, supported by a strong recovery in China during the second quarter.

Bernard Arnault, chairman and chief executive officer of LVMH, said the group had shown “exceptional resilience” during the health crisis. “While we have observed strong signs of an upturn in activity since June, we remain very vigilant for the rest of the year,” he said in a statement.

“Thanks to the strength of our brands and the responsiveness of our organization, we are confident that LVMH is in an excellent position to take advantage of the recovery, which we hope will be confirmed in the second half of the year, and to strengthen our lead in the global luxury market in 2020,” he added.

The French luxury conglomerate reported that sales fell 38 percent in organic terms in the three months to June 30 after the COVID-19 pandemic forced the closure of many of its stores and factories worldwide and grounded travelers, who account for 40 percent of luxury goods purchases in value terms, according to analysts.

This was better than the Bloomberg consensus estimate for a 42 percent fall, and comes on the heels of a 17 percent drop in the first quarter. LVMH’s revenues totaled 7.8 billion euros in the second quarter, with a net profit of 522 million euros. Louis Vuitton, Christian Dior and Moët Hennessy remained highly profitable.

“Although there were encouraging signs of recovery in June across several of the group’s activities, revenue was notably down in the United States and Europe during the quarter. Asia, however, has seen a marked improvement in trends, with a strong rebound in China in particular,” the group said.

The key fashion and leather goods segment posted sales of 3.35 billion euros, down 37 percent in like-for-like terms, broadly in line with a consensus forecast of a 38 percent decline. The sector benefited from a very strong performance in China, while sales in Europe and the United States have shown a progressive recovery since May.

Story continues

Sales of perfume and cosmetics were down 40 percent in organic terms, while selective retailing — which includes Sephora and DFS, LVMH’s travel-retail business — fell 38 percent. The watches and jewelry division recorded a 52 percent drop in organic revenue. Meanwhile, organic sales of wines and spirits were down 33 percent.

Analysts expect the group to outperform the rest of the luxury sector, despite an unfavorable geographic mix.

“LVMH is more exposed to the U.S. market which will be particularly hit by the delayed lifting of lockdown,” Morgan Stanley noted in a recent research report. The U.S. accounted for 24 percent of the luxury group’s revenues in 2019.

However, LVMH was likely to benefit from a “flight to quality” as consumers seek the reassurance of mighty brands like Louis Vuitton, Dior and Fendi, and gravitate toward classic and bourgeois brands over edgy labels.

“Consumers tend to want to buy products which are less likely to depreciate in value over time, but also generally want a less ostentatious look,” Morgan Stanley analysts Edouard Aubin and Elena Mariani said.

The LVMH results come on the heels of figures from Compagnie Financière Richemont showing sales fell 47 percent in the three months to June 30 due to store and workshop closures, anemic tourism and a lack of appetite for hard and soft luxury worldwide during the pandemic.

Meanwhile, Burberry reported retail sales fell 48.4 percent in the first quarter ended June 27, despite a powerful rebound in the key markets of Mainland China and South Korea. Kering is scheduled to publish its second-quarter results on Tuesday, with Hermès International to follow on Thursday."
Bernard Arnault created the world's most influential luxury conglomerate LVMH - The CEO Magazine,"Mon, 20 Jul 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWNlb21hZ2F6aW5lLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy9jb3ZlcnN0b3J5L2Jlcm5hcmQtYXJuYXVsdC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, all eyes have been on Bernard Arnault, Europe’s wealthiest man. For brief moments over the preceding months, the luxury-goods magnate topped Jeff Bezos as the richest man in the world with an estimated net worth of more than US$100 billion.

However, by May, that figure plummeted by US$30 billion after shares in his company, LVMH Moët Hennessy – Louis Vuitton SE, plunged by 19%, largely because people are no longer shopping for Fendi handbags or Bulgari watches amid a global economic downturn. Business publications quipped that Arnault has lost as much money as Bezos has gained since the start of the crisis.

Strikingly, however, no analysis of the straits Arnault finds himself in contains any trace of pity or schadenfreude. Why? Because it is well understood that nothing, not even a global pandemic or an economic recession, can stop him from expanding, influencing and creating. Arnault, 71, oversees a luxury empire of 70-plus brands divided into six sectors, offering the world’s most coveted wines, perfumes and leather goods.

He is often referred to as ‘the wolf in cashmere’ because of his ruthless drive for growth and seemingly wanton embrace of big risks. When LVMH’s competitors exercise caution, Arnault pushes his organisation into the future with massive, audacious investments.

“I’m not that interested in the numbers of the next six months – what I am interested in is that the desire for the brand will be the same in 10 years as it is today.” – Bernard Arnault

For example, even today, he is orchestrating an aggressive expansion plan that will see the reopening of the Samaritaine department store in Paris as a duty-free shopping hub and luxury hotel, as well as the construction of a Cheval Blanc luxury hotel on Los Angeles’ Rodeo Drive.

He has also committed to completing LVMH’s US$16 billion takeover of Tiffany & Co. this year. Givenchy, one of the dozens of prestige brands under the LVMH umbrella, has gone ahead with recruiting a new designer and is planning an aesthetic overhaul to be ready for a potential September fashion show, even if social distancing policies preclude the attendance of a live audience.

On top of these expansions, LVMH has also reconfigured its French factories to crank out 60 tonnes of protective masks and hand sanitiser per week since mid-March to help meet local demand for protective equipment.

So what gives Arnault the confidence to push ahead during a time when other executives have their tails between their legs? The explanation lies in the story of his first foray into the luxury arena more than 30 years ago.

Fascination with Dior

After graduating in 1971 from the École Polytechnique, France’s leading engineering school, a young Arnault began work for his father’s construction company, Ferret-Savinel (now Férinel).

“My father was really exceptional because he always gave me a sense of business, and when I arrived in the business with him, after three years, he told me, ‘I think you are able to run the business, so let’s do it,’” Arnault recalls, smiling.

“He gave me the key. I was 25, and I was running a small business – only 1,000 people. It was risky for him because it was a business he built over his entire life.” That risk was promptly followed by another.

In his 20s, Arnault shifted the family company from construction to real estate, and he began investing in the US – a curious decision for a French businessman in the 1970s.

He focused on holiday accommodation properties that were undervalued, and when that proved successful, he began to seek other undervalued gems, starting with Christian Dior.

All his life, Arnault’s mother had a fascination with Dior. But in 1984, the company was known less as a creator of fashion than as a safe option for French ladies to wear to lunch, as Vogue Editor-in-Chief Anna Wintour put it.

More importantly, Dior’s parent company, Willot Group, went bankrupt, and the French government was looking for someone to save it. “Immediately, I thought this brand has a lot of potential. It is under-evaluated. It is small compared to what I thought the world was going to become, and so I moved to buy it,” Arnault says. “It was a risky move at the time because it was much bigger than the company of my father, but starting from that, we built the LVMH of today.”

An elite line-up

With one distinguished luxury brand in his portfolio, Arnault developed the criteria that would guide its expansion over the following decades. “We try to build a large business with our partners with one criterion – the best quality and the most elite products in every line that we are selling throughout the world,” he said in 1987.

By that time, Louis Vuitton and Moët Hennessy had merged to form LVMH. Over the next two years, Arnault invested steadily in the company, ultimately becoming its largest shareholder. It was his ruthless ousting of LVMH’s former chairman, Henry Racamier, that earned him the ‘wolf in cashmere’ moniker.

“Family business, especially in the luxury area, is key for success.” – Bernard Arnault

Predicting a period of wealth and a popular willingness to spend on high-quality items, Arnault proceeded to bring the world’s top labels into the LVMH fold. One trait that unites many of the LVMH brands is that they began as family businesses, just like Arnault’s own business. This is no accident.

“Family business, especially in the luxury area, is key for success,” Arnault says. “When you are in a family, you have two major advantages. One is you can think long-term. It implies I’m not that interested in the numbers of the next six months – what I am interested in is that the desire for the brand will be the same in 10 years as it is today.

The second advantage of being a family business is in hiring people. When people come to LVMH, they do not join a group with anonymity. They come into the family. You are not just a little person in a big thing – you are a member of the family, and you will be taken care of as such.”

Fostering creativity

Thirty years and billions of euros since he took over the leadership of LVMH, Arnault is renowned as a visionary financier and empire-builder.

However, those who know him understand that his real talent lies in his ability to facilitate the creativity and artistry of the world’s most influential designers.

“I think his big strength is actually to speak to creative people and to make them thrive under his management,” says Antoine, Arnault’s son and CEO of the LVMH leather goods brand Berluti.

“It’s not to create profit or create more revenue or double the size of the business. I know that’s the consequence, and that’s usually what happens, but his real talent is with creative minds.”

When the Italian luxury brand Fendi was being courted by a slew of potential buyers in 2001, the legendary German creative director Karl Lagerfeld, who served as the label’s fur and women’s ready-to-wear collection designer in the 1970s, advocated for the company to go to Arnault and LVMH.

Beyond capturing the respect of the world’s mostesteemed designers, Arnault also sees LVMH as a training ground for the creators of the future.

“The success of the group is made of the quality of the product, and the quality of the product is a consequence of the extraordinary craftsmen and craftswomen that are working with us,” he says.

“We have a large campaign of hiring young people that sometimes are not really thinking of becoming craftsmen or craftswomen, but once we have given them the idea and once we train them, we have a rate of success that is near 90%, and it’s very rewarding for us to see these young people being so proud.”

Arnault is fiercely competitive

Arnault’s patronage of human creativity has bled into his personal life. Starting with his first auction purchase, a painting by Claude Monet, the LVMH CEO has added pieces by Jean-Michel Basquiat, Damien Hirst, Maurizio Cattelan, Andy Warhol and Pablo Picasso to his collection.

In 2014, he placed much of his collection into the Louis Vuitton Foundation, a contemporary art museum in Paris designed by the pre-eminent architect Frank Gehry. The swooping, sail-like structure attracts more than a million visitors every year and is considered one of the most important galleries in Europe.

“I am very competitive. I always want to win.” – Bernard Arnault

Today, although boutiques around the world have been closed for months, Arnault is able to continue steering LVMH into the future because of his sound predictions over the course of his career about what wealthy people want to spend their money on.

Although revenue might be coming in slowly now, Arnault is using what he has earned from Louis Vuitton’s 45% profit margins to prepare his next moves, spending big to win big when the industry recovers. Recalling a match he once played with Roger Federer, in which he scored a single point against the tennis icon, Arnault says, “I am very competitive. I always want to win.”

Culture of luxury

From Hollywood partnerships to marine conservation campaigns, LVMH brands have a tenacious habit of appearing in popular media and culture.

Belvedere Vodka was acquired by LVMH in 2005. It has partnered with celebrity artists including Chelsea Handler, Usher, Janelle Monáe and John Legend. In 2015, the brand was chosen as the official vodka of the 24th James Bond film Spectre.

Dom Pérignon Champagne is named after a Benedictine monk who was an important pioneer in the quality of Champagne but who, contrary to popular myths, did not discover the Champagne method for making sparkling wines.

In 1971, the Shah of Iran ordered several bottles of the first vintage of Dom Pérignon Rosé (the 1959) for the 2,500-year celebration of the Persian Empire. Two bottles of that champagne, from that order, were sold at auction for a total of £43,000 in 2008. Menswear and leather brand Berluti was founded in 1895 and acquired by LVMH in 1993.

Its CEO is Arnault’s son Antoine. In 2017, The Business of Fashion named Berluti among the 16 best companies to work for in the fashion industry. Its patrons include Frank Sinatra, Robert De Niro and Timothée Chalamet. Rihanna developed her cosmetic line Fenty Beauty within LVMH’s Kendo division, which served as an incubator.

Fenty Beauty aims to provide for the inclusion of all skin tones in cosmetics offerings, including extensive shade offerings for people with deeper skin tones. The launch of Rihanna’s fashion label Fenty in 2019 made her the first woman to lead a brand under the LVMH umbrella.

Kenzo was founded in 1970 by Japanese designer Kenzo Takada and was acquired by LVMH in 1993. The brand pioneered the use of Asian and Japanese style within the construction of European fashion. Patrons include Beyoncé, Zooey Deschanel and Lorde. Britney Spears was the face of its 2018 La Collection Memento No. 2 campaign.

Make Up For Ever is a French cosmetics brand created in 1984 by make-up artist Dany Sanz and acquired by LVMH in 1999 to complement its high-end make-up offering. The brand caters to professional make-up artists in the fashion and movie industries. French perfume house Guerlain, founded in 1828, is among the oldest in the world.

It was run by the Guerlain family until 1994, when it was bought by LVMH. Its fragrances such as Jicky, Shalimar and Vétiver have long influenced perfumery traditions. Jicky, known for its main notes of lavender and vanilla over animalic civet, is widely heralded as the first ‘modern’ fragrance and the first to be referred to as a perfume.

Bulgari was founded in Epirus, Greece, in 1884 as a single jewellery shop and expanded over the decades to become an international accessories brand.

In 2011, the Bulgari family sold the brand to LVMH for US$6 billion, more than LVMH had paid for any other company, plus a 3% stake in LVMH, making the Bulgaris the second-biggest family shareholder behind the Arnaults.

As of 2018, Bulgari has given US$80 million (A$117 million) to Save the Children. In 1999, LVMH bought nearly 100% of the Swiss luxury watchmaker TAG Heuer. Leonardo DiCaprio, Brad Pitt and Uma Thurman are among the dozens of celebrities who have endorsed its products.

London-based Christoph Behling has been the lead designer for TAG Heuer since 2004. The collaboration has resulted in some of the brand’s most celebrated pieces including the world’s fastest chronograph, the Mikrogirder 1/2000th, launched in 2012.

Tiffany & Co. was founded in 1837 and is known for its diamond and sterling-silver jewellery and for being an arbiter of American taste and style. The brand launched its first men’s jewellery collection in October 2019.

In November 2019, LVMH announced its purchase of Tiffany & Co. for US$16.2 billion, US$135 per share. The deal was expected to close by June 2020. Sephora is a French multinational chain of personal care and beauty stores featuring nearly 3,000 brands. It was founded in 1970 and bought by LVMH in 1997.

In 2016, Sephora launched a smartphone application that uses augmented reality to provide contouring tutorials and give users a virtual makeover. Its makeup is synonymous with quality and is extremely popular with young women.

Princess Yachts is a British luxury motor yacht manufacturer that was bought by LVMH in 2008 for €200 million. In 2016, it became the first luxury yacht manufacturer to officially collaborate with the Marine Conservation Society.

The partnership centred around the publication of an illustrated children’s book, Enid & Her Magic Yacht, which highlights the importance of marine conservation for future generations."
LVMH Confident in Recovery as China Confirms Rebound - WWD,"Mon, 27 Jul 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vd3dkLmNvbS9mZWF0dXJlL2x2bWgtY29uZmlkZW50LXJlY292ZXJ5LWNoaW5hLWNvbmZpcm1zLXJlYm91bmQtMTIwMzY4ODQxMy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS — LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton saw a strong rebound in China in the second quarter and expects a gradual return to normal elsewhere in the second half, supported by the solid performance of its top brands, Louis Vuitton and Dior, and a jump in online sales.

The French luxury conglomerate said net profit plummeted 84 percent in the first six months of the year, after the COVID-19 pandemic forced the closure of many of its stores and factories worldwide and grounded travelers, who account for 40 percent of luxury goods purchases in value terms, according to analysts.

“I do not think we have ever seen such a perfectly negative alignment of planets against us,” LVMH chief financial officer Jean-Jacques Guiony said on a conference call on Monday. But the outlook is brightening for the group, which has seen continuous improvements since the lifting of lockdown measures in many countries.

“The month of June was significantly better, and July will certainly see some improvement compared to June,” Guiony said. “We see, month after month, the situation coming back to a more normalized state and we expect this to continue.”

Bernard Arnault, chairman and chief executive officer of LVMH, noted the group had shown “exceptional resilience” during the health crisis. “While we have observed strong signs of an upturn in activity since June, we remain very vigilant for the rest of the year,” he said in a statement.

“Thanks to the strength of our brands and the responsiveness of our organization, we are confident that LVMH is in an excellent position to take advantage of the recovery, which we hope will be confirmed in the second half of the year, and to strengthen our lead in the global luxury market in 2020,” he added.

LVMH, which owns 75 brands ranging from Dom Pérignon Champagne to Bulgari jewelry, reported that sales fell 38 percent in the three months to June 30, following a 15 percent drop in the first quarter. In organic terms, sales were also down 38 percent, beating the Bloomberg consensus forecast for a 42 percent fall.

Organic sales in the second quarter were down 54 percent in Europe and Japan, while the U.S. saw a 39 percent drop. Asia, excluding Japan, performed comparatively better, with a 13 percent decline.

LVMH’s net profit totaled 522 million euros in the first half, with Louis Vuitton, Dior and Moët Hennessy remaining highly profitable. But the group’s gross margin took a hit, due to the depreciation of unsold products and its inability to absorb all the fixed costs of its manufacturing activities.

Most segments recorded losses during the period, with the exception of the key fashion and leather goods division, as well as wines and spirits. Selective retailing — which includes Sephora and DFS, LVMH’s travel-retail business — was hardest-hit, with a loss from recurring operations of 308 million euros in the first half.

Fashion and leather goods posted sales of 3.35 billion euros in the second quarter, down 37 percent in like-for-like terms, broadly in line with expectations. The division posted growth of more than 65 percent in China, while sales in Europe and the U.S. saw a progressive recovery from May.

In the U.S. and Japan, Dior sales rose in June while Vuitton was broadly flat. “I think this is very encouraging for the future,” Guiony said.

Dior has staged a series of high-profile events, including a physical fashion show in Italy for its cruise collection — albeit without the usual guests — and the opening of its traveling exhibition, “Christian Dior: Designer of Dreams,” in Shanghai on Tuesday.

Vuitton, meanwhile, is gearing up to present its spring 2021 men’s collection with fashion shows, open to the public, in Shanghai and Tokyo.

Sales of perfume and cosmetics were down 40 percent against a backdrop of significant destocking by retailers, with LVMH refraining from selling through parallel distribution channels. In the second half, Fresh will open concept stores in China with new services, and Loewe will launch a line of home fragrances.

Guiony said it was too early to extrapolate any forecasts from the global spike in online sales during the lockdown, although he indicated a shift in LVMH’s attitude to e-commerce, which it has traditionally been reluctant to engage in.

”We are very pleased with the business we’ve done on the digital front, particularly in Sephora and in fashion and leather goods, and to a lesser extent in perfumes and cosmetics. It has enabled us to offset part of the lost business in regular distribution channels, so it is encouraging for the future,” he said.

“When I see the amount of business that we’ve been able to generate in the last six months on our e-commerce platform, I think there is a future for these platforms to generate a significant amount of the global sales and to be a real and genuine distribution channel, alongside the brick-and-mortar,” Guiony added.

The watches and jewelry division recorded a 52 percent drop in organic revenue, even though Bulgari saw a strong recovery in China in the second quarter. Meanwhile, organic sales of wines and spirits were down 33 percent, with cognac benefiting from a rebound in sales in China and resilient U.S. demand.

In the selective retailing division, revenues fell 38 percent even as Sephora gained market share and saw strong increases in online sales. DFS was focused on cutting costs and gradually reopening its downtown stores in Venice, Macau and Hong Kong.

“Our top brands have not disappointed — all profitable; less revenue drops than peers; outstanding margins; market share gains; well positioned to become stronger in the crisis, which is exactly what leaders should do,” Guiony said.

“We are optimistic and confident, although there are two things we should not forget in order to be able to react quickly to any change in the environment. First, the resolution of the sanitary crisis lacks visibility and we cannot rule out further difficulties here and there. And two, the travel retail business is and will be suffering for a number of months and quarters before it comes back to normal,” he added.

While LVMH plans to slash its capital expenditures budget by 40 percent this year, it expects to keep its workforce largely intact. “There is no such thing as massive reduction in headcount. There could be some adjustments here and there, but nothing particularly significant,” said Guiony.

“It would be stupid on our side to adjust too much — be it the capital base, the human base, or even to streamline too much some brands — because when things recover, we want to be in good shape to benefit from that,” he explained.

The executive gave a brief update on LVMH’s $16.2 billion acquisition of U.S. jeweler Tiffany & Co., saying half-a-dozen antitrust filings were still pending, though he did not specify in which countries. “Things are moving forward,” Guiony said. “But I don’t really know when all the go-aheads will be given.”

He also declined to estimate the potential impact of U.S. tariffs on French fashion goods, including handbags. “Some are pending, some are threatened. It’s very difficult to make any assessment,” he noted. “It’s a likelihood, that’s right, but it’s not the first time that something like this doesn’t happen at the end of the day.”

Analysts expect the group to outperform the rest of the luxury sector, despite an unfavorable geographic mix.

“LVMH is more exposed to the U.S. market, which will be particularly hit by the delayed lifting of lockdown,” Morgan Stanley noted in a recent research report. The U.S. accounted for 24 percent of the luxury group’s revenues in the first half.

But LVMH was likely to benefit from a “flight to quality” as consumers seek the reassurance of mighty brands like Vuitton, Dior, Fendi and Celine, and gravitate toward classic and bourgeois brands over edgy labels.

“Consumers tend to want to buy products, which are less likely to depreciate in value over time, but also generally want a less ostentatious look,” said Morgan Stanley analysts Edouard Aubin and Elena Mariani.

The LVMH results come on the heels of figures from Compagnie Financière Richemont showing sales fell 47 percent in the three months to June 30 due to store and workshop closures, anemic tourism and a lack of appetite for hard and soft luxury worldwide during the pandemic.

Meanwhile, Burberry reported retail sales fell 48.4 percent in the first quarter ended June 27, despite a powerful rebound in the key markets of mainland China and South Korea. Kering is scheduled to publish its second-quarter results on Tuesday, with Hermès International to follow on Thursday."
LVMH’s Profits Plunged 84% the First Half of the Year Due to Covid-19 - Robb Report,"Tue, 28 Jul 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vcm9iYnJlcG9ydC5jb20vc3R5bGUvZmFzaGlvbi9sdm1oLXByb2ZpdHMtcGx1bmdlLWZpcnN0LWhhbGYtMjAyMC1wYW5kZW1pYy0yOTM4ODY1L9IBXmh0dHBzOi8vcm9iYnJlcG9ydC5jb20vc3R5bGUvZmFzaGlvbi9sdm1oLXByb2ZpdHMtcGx1bmdlLWZpcnN0LWhhbGYtMjAyMC1wYW5kZW1pYy0yOTM4ODY1L2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LVMH, the world’s largest luxury conglomerate, may be hopeful for the future, but its latest financial report reveals just how hard the behemoth has been hit by the Covid-19 pandemic.

On Monday, the French company said that while its revenue stream proved resilient during the first half of the year––falling 27 percent––given the climate, it’s profit was a different story. The first two quarters of 2020 saw LVMH’s net profit nosedive a staggering 84 percent to $612.29 million, something the operation attributes mostly to extended boutique closures during lockdown. And that figure is far below analyst estimates who expected a more robust recovery.

“I do not think we have ever seen such a perfectly negative alignment of planets against us,” said LVMH chief financial officer Jean-Jacques Guiony on a conference call. “The month of June was significantly better, and July will certainly see some improvement compared to June.” This uptick in sales is largely due to China’s reopening and was buoyed by the more recent reopening of shops in Europe, though the lack of tourist dollars remains a significant concern for the company.

LVMH, the world's biggest luxury goods group, said sales momentum picked up in June, but store closures tore a hole into second-quarter sales. More here: https://t.co/rgD5dlrta2 pic.twitter.com/rArOhd70op — Reuters Business (@ReutersBiz) July 28, 2020

The severity of LVMH’s losses may be due, in part, to its organization. The company is vertically integrated—it owns the majority of its suppliers, manufacturers and even individual stores. This model is one favored by CEO Bernard Arnault for the level of control it affords over every aspect of the business. Normally an advantage, that organization proved to be a drawback during the outset of the pandemic because LVMH couldn’t reduce costs by slashing orders to third-party businesses. “We do manufacture inside, and so we suffered some lack of absorption of fixed costs,” Guiony told the Wall Street Journal. “It’s particularly true at Vuitton, wines and spirits and some other businesses.”

Though Vuitton sales may have experienced trouble in select categories, the heritage house known for its leather goods remained one of LVMH’s top performers, along with the other jewel in its crown, Dior.

While the half-year profits report was unequivocally dire, Guiony cited another reason for optimism. The extreme circumstances brought on by Covid-19 have encouraged LVMH’s stable of luxury houses to take a fresh approach to e-commerce, one the CFO believes will inform the brands’ future. “When I see the amount of business that we’ve been able to generate in the last six months on our e-commerce platform, I think there is a future for these platforms to generate a significant amount of the global sales and to be a real and genuine distribution channel, alongside the brick-and-mortar,” he told WWD."

LVMH's Ian Rogers Flags Upcoming Artificial Intelligence Push - WWD,"Mon, 06 Jul 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3dkLmNvbS9mZWF0dXJlL2x2bWhzLWlhbi1yb2dlcnMtZmxhZ3MtdXBjb21pbmctYXJ0aWZpY2lhbC1pbnRlbGxpZ2VuY2UtcHVzaC0xMjAzNjY2MTU4L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS — The coronavirus crisis has everyone going digital full-throttle — including specialists in the realm. This year, following widespread store closures, it’s been all about bulking up e-commerce services — on the double. But next up, the focus will be on artificial intelligence, according to Ian Rogers, chief digital officer at LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, who spoke to WWD through Zoom.

“We talk a lot about data and artificial intelligence, I think you’ll see us talk more about that — if we were at VivaTech this year, our theme would be artificial intelligence,” he said, referring to the French technology fair that was canceled this year.

The executive normally reveals winners of the annual LVMH Innovation Prize at the VivaTech fair, which is France’s equivalent to the Las Vegas Consumer Electronics Show, drawing industry heavyweights such as Alibaba chairman and cofounder Jack Ma and Microsoft chief executive officer Satya Nadella.

But this year, the prize was moved online, with bulked up content that included discussions on the French technology scene. Rogers was after a podcast-like format that would draw interest.

“Doing it virtually with an audience online, you don’t have a captive audience — it’s not like you’re trapped in the room and can’t leave unless you’re rude — you can pretty easily click away,” he noted.

The subject of artificial intelligence — less of a focus as everyone scrambled to improve e-commerce systems — will return to the spotlight in the coming months, Rogers predicted.

“With what’s going on in the world, it’s not the moment, but we will probably talk more about that in the back half of the year because it’s a huge focus for us,” the executive said.

“We were super busy trying to do lots of things that had been, maybe planned for later in a roadmap, sooner,” he said, referring to the past months when stores were shut amid coronavirus lockdowns.

“Whether it was just making the inventory that was in the stores available online or making your products available in countries that they weren’t previously available — we’re still a bit behind on the e-commerce geographic rollout and so everyone’s trying to open e-commerce stores and add new countries, and also just add services. Say Apple Pay and PayPal were on your roadmap for later this year — you tried to get it done in March,” he continued.

“It’s supply-side basics, in a way, but I would also say it’s a supply of not just products but also services, a service might be a payment service like buy-now-pay-later, or Apple Pay, but it could also be just the ability for a sales associate to sell really effectively from their phone,” he added, ticking off services like notifications at each stage of an online purchase.

The focus on artificial intelligence is twofold, he explained.

“When we talk about data and artificial intelligence, what we’re really talking about is personalization and operational efficiency, that’s the kind of value that you’re getting from artificial intelligence — you’re building personalized experiences for customers, and then your adding efficiency to your back office,” he said.

This year’s innovation prize went to Crobox, a start-up that introduces personalization on merchandise displayed on an e-commerce page — flagging certain attributes that might nudge a consumer to make a purchase, like ‘most viewed’ items or ecologically friendly attributes.

“We’re at this moment in time when retailers are going from no personalization to some personalization — that’s s a big jump,” he said.

The group’s innovation prize serves as a scouting process for it — rather than leaving start-up entrepreneurs to reach out to various brands on their own, the prize system serves as an introduction to LVMH labels.

“We want it to be a real scouting process where it’s not just the loudest or the best salespeople, or the ones who have a friend on the Comex, you want it to be more of a meritocracy in terms of finding these start-ups,” he added.

When setting up the prize, he and his team had consulted with LVMH fashion prize organizers, and sought to promote a similar system wherein all finalists benefit from building a relationship with the group. This year, for example, a list of more than 1,000 applicants was whittled down to 30 finalists, a “batch that gets introduced” to the LVMH group, he noted.

The group has other programs in the start-up realm, including its accelerator program at the French tech hub Station F.

“There’s no impetus from me to say ‘oh you must work with these guys because they were our finalist or part of the Station F program’ — not at all, all we do is say, ‘hey, wait you’re trying to do that? We know a company that’s trying to solve that problem, would you like to meet them?’” he said.

“That’s really kind of it — but that is very, very valuable,” he continued."
"Dior, Louis Vuitton “resilient” but LVMH profits disappoint - Vogue Business","Mon, 27 Jul 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZvZ3VlYnVzaW5lc3MuY29tL2NvbXBhbmllcy9kaW9yLWxvdWlzLXZ1aXR0b24tcmVzaWxpZW50LWJ1dC1sdm1oLXByb2ZpdC1kaXNhcHBvaW50c9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LVMH says profits were severely hit by Covid-19’s impact on Europe and the US despite a late uptick in China and signalled confidence it can weather the storm with its biggest luxury brands, Louis Vuitton and Dior.



Same-store sales fell 38 per cent in the second quarter, while operating profits sank 68 per cent to €1.67 billion in the first half of 2020, well below market expectations after markets closed in Paris.

“Thanks to the strength of our brands and the responsiveness of our organisation, we are confident that LVMH is in an excellent position to take advantage of the recovery, which we hope will be confirmed in the second half of the year, and to strengthen our lead in the global luxury market in 2020,” LVMH chairman and chief executive Bernard Arnault stated.

While LVMH cut costs in the first half (operating expenses were down 16 per cent in organic terms), the conglomerate mostly maintained its marketing spend and headcount while others made drastic cuts, amid confidence it can gain market share in times of crisis. But the hit was severe nonetheless: the fashion and leather goods division, which represents more than 60 per cent of the conglomerate’s profits, was down 37 per cent to €3.3 billion. LVMH called out profitability at Louis Vuitton and Dior for remaining “at a high level”.

“LVMH produced a relatively resilient first-half top-line organic growth at -28 per cent, with key fashion and leather goods and wine and spirits divisions ahead of the group average,” Bernstein analyst Luca Solca wrote in a note titled “Profits expectations meet reality”. Continuing its cost basis may hit later on, he noted.

LVMH is ahead of the luxury industry overall, which is expected to sink 45 to 50 per cent in the second quarter, according to analysts’ estimates. (Ferragamo, Prada, Kering and Hermès are among companies set to publish their first-half figures this week. Burberry sales were down 49 per cent in its first quarter ended 27 June at constant exchange, while Richemont also fell 47 per cent in the first quarter ended 30 June and Moncler, which also published on 27 July, dove 52 per cent in the second quarter ending 30 June.)

After the market closed on the 27th of July, LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton revealed its financial results for the first half of 2020. The persisting coronavirus pandemic affected LVMH, causing losses in the year’s first half results. The French multinational corporation reported revenue of 18.4 billion euros, a 27% decline over the first half of 2019.

LVMH First Half Earnings Results

At the beginning of the coronavirus lockdown, LVMH released its first-quarter results which showed a decline in sales. According to the report, LVMH lost a total of 15% in revenue. In organic revenue, Perfumes and Cosmetics reduced 19% while Fashion and Leather Goods declined 10%. Also, Wines and Spirits fell 14%. Topping the list of declines are Watches and Jewelry, along with Selective Retailing, as each plunged 26%.

According to the first half report by the company, revenue in the second quarter, per organic basis, was down 38%. In organic growth, Wines and Spirits reduced by 33%, while Watches and Jewelry dropped by 52%. Furthermore, the report shows a decline in the organic growth of Fashion and Leather Goods by 37% and Perfumes and Cosmetics by 40%. Selective Distribution also fell by 38%. However, despite a revenue fall in the US, and Europe, Asia seems to be recovering with China’s resilience.

More on LVMH’S 2020 First Half Earnings

For the 2020 first half, Christian Dior, Moët Hennessy and Louis Vuitton still stand high in profitability. Profits from recurring operations totaled 1671 million euros, a 68% loss over 2019’s first half gains. In addition, the net cash from operating activities is also down by 80%. The report shows that total sales were down 15% against the first quarter of the previous year. As the global lockdown eases, LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton is rebounding from an increase in online sales.

Chairman and CEO of LVMH, Bernard Arnault, commented on the company’s performance in the first half of 2020:

“LVMH showed exceptional resilience to the serious health crisis the world experienced in the first half of 2020. Our Maisons have shown remarkable agility in implementing measures to adapt their costs and accelerate the growth of online sales.”

LVMH Stock

This year, MarketWatch shows that LVMH lost almost 3%, a 2.35% decline in the last five days. However, in the last three months, the company’s stock jumped 16%, and 3.395% in the past month. Overall, LVMH has increased by 5.92% in the last year. Currently, LVMH’s stock is closed at 402.85 Euros, a 1.23% gain over its last close of 397.95 Euros.

Considering the company’s losses for the first half of the year, the report shows that LVMH hopes to recover gradually in the second half of the year. The company is confident it will “reinforce LVMH’s global leadership position in luxury goods once again in 2020.”"
LVMH turns to digital as revenue drops 27% - DFNIonline.com,"Tue, 28 Jul 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRmbmlvbmxpbmUuY29tL2xhdGVzdC1uZXdzL2x2bWgtdHVybnMtZGlnaXRhbC1yZXZlbnVlLWRyb3BzLTI3LTI4LTA3LTIwMjAv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton (LVMH) saw revenue fall 27% to €18.4bn in the first half of the year, as the ongoing global pandemic took its toll.

The suspension of international travel hit the group’s Selective Retailing division, which includes retailer DFS, as revenue dropped 32%. The issues across the group were compounded by the destocking of watches and Perfumes & Cosmetics by some retailers.

Digital was the shining light for the group amongst the downturn. The Selective Retailing division saw an improived relationship with Chinese consumers thanks to the use of digital outlets and both LVMH’s Watches & Jewellery and Perfume & Cosmetics markets have seen good growth in online sales.

LVMH Chairman and CEO Bernard Arnault said: “LVMH showed exceptional resilience to the serious health crisis the world experienced in the first half of 2020. Our Maisons have shown remarkable agility in implementing measures to adapt their costs and accelerate the growth of online sales.”

DFS ‘particularly affected’

The pandemic “slowed revenue sharply” for LVMH’s Selective Retailing division, according to a report published with the results.

The sector, which includes DFS and Starboard Cruises, saw a 32% drop in revenue, with France and the United States among the hardest hit markets.

Staff safety was the priority for DFS and the retailer also deployed a number of programmes to support local communities affected by the pandemic.

The report said: “DFS’s two main markets were affected to varying degrees during this trying period: Hong Kong, which was already hampered by the drop in tourism in 2019, was much more heavily hit by the pandemic, whereas in Macao, the closure of DFS’s seven stores only lasted two weeks.”

It continued: “The Maison resolutely undertook a series of cost-cutting measures and, in order to continue to serve its customers, concentrated on ramping up its digital marketing.”

Starboard Cruise Services saw a strong start to the year, particularly in the Caribbean, but operations in Asia and the rest of the world were suspended as the pandemic took hold.

As the cruise line looks to return to business, it has “accelerated the digital development of its service” to meet consumers’ new demands.

The future

DFS will continue its ongoing cost-cutting measures, according to LVMH, as well as building on its “omni-channel transformation”. Stores will be opening slowly and in line with local authority guidance, but the brand is planning to continue building in the key Asia market.

“Remaining firmly committed to supporting its local communities, the Maison has maintained its plans to expand in the Asia-Pacific region,” the LVMH report said, “as well as the grand opening of La Samaritaine in Paris planned for 2021.”

Reflecting on the group’s outlook for the year ahead, Arnault said: “While we have observed strong signs of an upturn in activity since June, we remain very vigilant for the rest of the year.”

He concluded: “Thanks to the strength of our brands and the responsiveness of our organization, we are confident that LVMH is in an excellent position to take advantage of the recovery, which we hope will be confirmed in the second half of the year, and to strengthen our lead in the global luxury market in 2020.”"

At the annual shareholders’ meeting yesterday, the dividend of €4.80 per share was agreed.

An initial payment of €2.20 was made on 10 December last year, and the balance of €2.60 will be paid on 9 July.

The final day of trading with dividend rights is 6 July.

First Quarter Results

In April, LVMH announced a 26% year-on-year decrease in organic revenue for its Selective Retailing arm, which comprises the luxury retailer DFS and Starboard Cruises.

A report from the luxury house said that the suspension of international travel has led to a “significant decline” in activity for DFS.

Across all its business, LVMH recorded revenue of €10.6bn for the first quarter of 2020, which is down 15% on Q1 2019. The Fashion & Leather Goods sector was the least affected, with revenue down 9% year-on-year to €5.1bn, while Selective Retailing and Watches & Jewellery were hardest hit, with falls of 25% and 24% in reported revenue respectively.

Speaking at the time, LVMH Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Bernard Arnault said: “In this unprecedented context, I would first like to thank our teams around the world, who have mobilized to help caregivers and participate in the collective effort by making hydroalcoholic gel for hand sanitizers, by facilitating the movement or by producing medical masks or even by sourcing critical equipment for hospitals."
"Paris stock exchange : Hermès, luxury superstar ahead of its competitors LVMH and Kering Luxus Plus - - Luxus Plus","Mon, 27 Jul 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vbHV4dXMtcGx1cy5jb20vZW4vZmluYW5jZS1oZXJtZXMtbHV4dXJ5LXN1cGVyc3Rhci1haGVhZC1vZi1pdHMtY29tcGV0aXRvcnMtbHZtaC1hbmQta2VyaW5nLTIv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"[vc_row njt-role-user-roles=”administrator,armember”][vc_column][vc_column_text]

The power of its brand and the resilience of its unique business model have made the Hermès share the second best performer in the flagship index since the beginning of the year, far ahead of the other French giants in the luxury sector, LVMH and Kering.

In the midst of a health and (soon) economic crisis, the French luxury giant is proving to be extremely resilient, both operationally and on the stock market.

Indeed, the luxury house Hermès is withstanding the coronavirus crisis better than its competitors and is seeing its business rebound strongly in China after the reopening of stores.

While its competitors reported double-digit revenue declines in the first quarter (-17% for LVMH, -16.4% for Kering), Hermès recorded only a limited 7.7% decline in sales. Clearly below the consensus forecast of a 13% decline.

Hermès even allowed itself the luxury of achieving record sales of nearly $3 million in a single day when it reopened its flagship store in Guangzhou.

At the end of 2019, the Covid-19 crisis first hit China, a crucial market for the luxury sector, before spreading to the rest of the world.

On March 16, Europe, including France and Italy, and then the United States, had to deal with containment measures and thus the closure of non-essential stores.

The second best performance of the CAC 40

That said, the power of the luxury brand and the resilience of its unique business model have enabled it to be the second best performer on the CAC 40 since the beginning of the year, with a 10.8% gain, well ahead of the other French giants in the luxury sector, LVMH and Kering.

To date, the group led by Bernard Arnaud (LVMH) has lost 6.3% and that of François-Henri Pinault (Kering), 18.5%.

While the share even reached an all-time high on 5 June at 786.2 euros, bringing the group’s valuation to some 82 billion euros.

The group headed by Axel Dumas is thus one of the top five largest capitalisations on the CAC.

“At the height of the crisis, investors did not look at valuation levels at all – Hermès shares were valued at up to 50 times their expected earnings in 2021 – but took refuge in growth stocks with healthy balance sheets. The Group has a cash position of more than €3 billion,” observes John Plassard, Deputy Chief Investment Officer at Mirabaud Securities.

Asia, the Group’s huge growth driver

Indeed, we can see the importance of Asia in sales growth. Although France is on a par with Japan (13% of revenues in 2019).

Asia-Pacific remains the number one in terms of sales with a rate of 51% of revenues in 2019 against 45% in 2010. Japan’s share having dropped from 19% to 13% over the same period.

Asian customers, especially Chinese, have therefore driven Hermès’ sales growth over the past decade.

The consulting firm Bain & Company noted that these clients are increasingly making purchases in their own countries.

As a result, sales in China have grown twice as fast as spending by Chinese clients abroad in recent years.

Now they alone account for 33% of global spending on luxury goods. According to Bain & Company, this share could increase to 46% by 2025.

There are 126 Hermès stores in Asia, compared to 113 in Europe. This also enabled the brand to limit breakage during the first quarter of the year.

The group was able to reopen almost all of its stores in the Middle Kingdom as of 27 February, after closing almost half of its network of 26 stores at the height of the pandemic.

Hermès also relies on an incomparable, even timeless, brand image to withstand the crisis better than its competitors.

Remember that between 2006 and 2008, a period during which the brand posted sales growth of +26%, well ahead of LVMH and Kering (+21% and +8% respectively).

The most iconic products

“In times of recession, Hermès is typically the most resilient business and action, thanks to its high desirability, especially of its most iconic products,” says Luca Solca, sector analyst at Bernstein.

Note that between 1980 and 2017, Birkin bags, the most expensive in the world at 7,000 euros per bag, proved to be a better investment than gold and the S&P 5000. The average annual return for the bag was +5.3% for the S&P and +2.1% for an ounce of gold.

Moreover, the famous bag has never declined since its creation, which is explained by the very low number of units on the market.

Each one is handmade from start to finish by a single craftsman who signs his signature on it.

In the ranking of the world’s most powerful and best-valued brands compiled by the research firm Interbrand based on the brand’s influence on purchasing decisions, financial performance, brand strength in its market and an assessment of future revenues, Hermès ranked 28th worldwide in 2019, four places higher than in 2018.

Since the last financial crisis, the value of the Hermès brand alone would have risen from $4.6 billion in 2009 to $17.9 billion in 2019. And within the sector, Hermès is now second only to Louis Vuitton (22nd place, $32.2 billion) and Chanel (28th place, $22.1 billion).

As you will have understood, nothing can stop Hermès even in the midst of a health crisis, the French luxury giant is proving its resilience.

After years of feeling overwhelmed by all the skincare choices and a bad experience with a product that discolored her skin as a teen, Rihanna dreamed of creating a line that was easy and effective. Now, she's created an approachable skincare brand built on years of unparalleled experience, access and education, representing everything she wished she had known when she was younger. With Fenty Skin, Rihanna shares her real-life routine for achieving a bright, healthy-looking complexion. Known together as the ""Fenty Skin Start'rs"", her regimen includes three 2-in-1 products:

Fenty Skin features clean, vegan, gluten-free and oil-free formulas, and combines globally sourced ingredients, like vitamin C-rich Barbados cherry, with gold standard skincare ingredients, like hyaluronic acid and niacinamide. Rihanna wanted Fenty Skin to be a complete sensorial experience, so the products feature warm, tropical scents inspired by their ingredients like Barbados cherry, coconut, and fresh desert melon. Making sure everyone could use it and see visible results was essential to Rihanna, so every Fenty Skin product was tested on all skin tones, textures, and types.

Fenty Skin's packaging is sleek, modern and earth conscious. The brand has eliminated boxes where possible, incorporated post-consumer recycled materials, and created refill systems where feasible.

Rihanna also welcomes skincare expert and licensed esthetician, Sean Garrette, as Fenty Skin Ambassador.

Fenty Skin launches exclusively on FentySkin.com starting July 31st, with international shipping.

LVMH revenues fall by -27% in first half as suspension of travel hits DFS - The Moodie Davitt Report,"Mon, 27 Jul 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vbW9vZGllZGF2aXR0cmVwb3J0LmNvbS9sdm1oLXJldmVudWVzLWZhbGwtYnktMjctaW4tZmlyc3QtaGFsZi1hcy1zdXNwZW5zaW9uLW9mLXRyYXZlbC1oaXRzLWRmcy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"INTERNATIONAL. Luxury goods group LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton recorded revenue of €18.4 billion in the first half of 2020, down by -27% year-on-year (-28% on an organic basis).

In the Selective Retailing division, which includes DFS Group, revenue declined by -32% (-33% on an organic basis) in the half and losses hit €308 million from recurring operations.

LVMH said: “DFS saw a significant decline in its activity in most destinations due to the suspension of international travel. A series of cost reduction measures have been undertaken. Its digital strategy has strengthened the relationship with its customers, particularly in China.”

Profit from recurring operations amounted to €1,671 million for the half (-68%) and operating margin stood at 9%. The profitability of Louis Vuitton, Christian Dior and Moët Hennessy remained at “a high level”, while group share of net profit amounted to €522 million (-84%).

In the second quarter, revenue fell by -38% on an organic basis compared to the same period in 2019. Although there were signs of recovery in June across some group activities, revenue was notably down in the US and Europe during the quarter. Asia, it said, has seen a “marked improvement in trends, with a strong rebound in China in particular”.

LVMH Chairman and CEO Bernard Arnault said: “LVMH showed exceptional resilience to the serious health crisis the world experienced in the first half of 2020. Our Maisons have shown remarkable agility in implementing measures to adapt their costs and accelerate the growth of online sales. While we have observed strong signs of an upturn in activity since June, we remain very vigilant for the rest of the year.

“We continue to be driven by a long-term vision, a deep sense of responsibility and a strong commitment to environmental protection, inclusion and solidarity. In the current context, we remain even more firmly dedicated to showing continuous progress in these areas. Thanks to the strength of our brands and the responsiveness of our organisation, we are confident that LVMH is in an excellent position to take advantage of the recovery, which we hope will be confirmed in the second half of the year, and to strengthen our lead in the global luxury market in 2020.”

LVMH singled out several key influences on trading in the first half including the resilience of the major brands; Q2 recovery in China; an acceleration of online sales; destocking by retailers in Perfumes & Cosmetics and Watches; and the suspension of international travel, “severely penalising travel retail and hotel activities”.

Performance by business group

The Wines & Spirits business group saw its organic revenue decline by -23% in the half. Profit from recurring operations was down -29%. Despite recent improvement, the decline in volumes was noticeable in the second quarter, particularly for the Champagne business. After a start to the year supported by advance orders from distributors, the US showed good resilience in the second quarter thanks to Hennessy Cognac, which saw a strong rebound in June in this market as well as in China. The Château d’Esclans and Château du Galoupet acquisitions, made in 2019, were integrated in the first half of the year, strengthening Moët Hennessy’s position in the growing market for high-end rosé wines, noted LVMH.

The Fashion & Leather Goods business group recorded a -24% decline in organic revenue in the first half of 2020 in an environment, marked by the closure of stores in many regions across the world. China recorded a “very strong recovery” in revenue in the second quarter and there has been a gradual improvement since May in Europe and the US.

The brands’ cost management made it possible to limit the decline in profit from recurring operations to -46%, said LVMH. The company noted: “Louis Vuitton strengthened its ties with its customers through several digital initiatives and maintained its profitability at an exceptional level. Christian Dior, which showed remarkable resistance, has just inaugurated a new boutique on rue Saint-Honoré in Paris. The other fashion brands, which have been more impacted, continue to strengthen their creativity in order to take advantage of the gradual return to normal.”

The Perfumes & Cosmetics business group recorded a -29% decline in organic revenue in the half. There was a loss from recurring operations of €30 million. LVMH said: “The big brands showed good resistance and high reactivity in a sector marked by the decline in makeup, the reduction in retailer stock levels and by a strong increase in parallel distribution channels in which our brands did not wish to participate. Online sales are growing steadily.”

The Watches & Jewelry business group saw its organic revenue decline by -39% in the first half of 2020. Losses from recurring operations came to €17 million. On the positive side, “Bvlgari quickly took advantage of the recovery in China in the second quarter”.

It added: “After a year of renovation, Chaumet inaugurated its historic address on Place Vendôme in Paris and strengthened its presence in China. After a good start to the year, TAG Heuer and Hublot were impacted by the decline in orders from retailers. The new TAG Heuer smartwatch, which was one of the major innovations of the first half, has been a great success.”"

China ‘Revenge Spending’ Offsets Plunge in Luxury Goods Revenue - Caixin Global,"Wed, 29 Jul 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNhaXhpbmdsb2JhbC5jb20vMjAyMC0wNy0yOS9jaGluYS1yZXZlbmdlLXNwZW5kaW5nLW9mZnNldHMtcGx1bmdlLWluLWx1eHVyeS1nb29kcy1yZXZlbnVlLTEwMTU4NjEwOS5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Luxury goods companies saw profits dive across the board in the first half of 2020 as people avoided extravagances and stayed inside during the coronavirus pandemic — but it wasn’t bad news everywhere, with the China market providing a glimmer of hope.

French luxury multinational LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE saw its profits plunge 28% in the first half, and Gucci owner Kering SA’s revenues fell 44% on an organic basis in the second quarter.

The companies’ performance fell roughly in line with analyst predictions of a 25% to 30% contraction in sales of luxury goods globally over the first quarter, as retail and travel businesses worldwide ground to a halt.

But LVMH highlighted a strong rebound in the China market and Asia more broadly, in a reversal of the trend seen elsewhere. Chinese consumers on both online and offline luxury shopping sprees were a bright spot, with leading luxury brands seeing an uptick in what analysts call “revenge shopping” as shoppers started stepping into malls again and splurging as they emerged from quarantine.

As the first place to implement lockdowns to combat the Covid-19 outbreak, China’s luxury sector suffered one of the steepest declines in the first quarter as stores closed and people stopped going out in late January. But with the country’s domestic outbreak mostly contained, many traditional shopping malls have reopened.

However, it remains unclear how long the boost will last, and luxury brands are still struggling to manage as Covid-19 outbreaks continue around the world. Jean Jacques Guiony, CFO of LVMH, said on an earnings call that the company had never “seen such a perfectly negative alignment of planets” and still faces “closure of most of our physical stores.”

Despite efforts to cut costs in response, the luxury goods giant’s reported that net profit fell 84% to 522 million euros ($613 million) and revenue dropped to 18.4 billion euros on an organic basis in the first half year. As infections rose and more stores outside China closed in the second quarter, revenues fell 38%, down more than twice as much as the first quarter.

LVMH and Kering have both attempted to reorient toward selling online to make up for the lack of in-person shopping, traditionally the mainstay of luxury brands. Kering e-commerce sales soared 72% over the past three months, rising to make up 13% of the total. Yet while e-commerce performance was encouraging, online sales have only partially offset losses in the brick-and-mortar business, LVMH said in its financial statement.

LVMH reiterates commitment to Tiffany & Co. takeover as revenues decline

French luxury conglomerate Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE (LVMH) has indicated it intends to proceed with its takeover of Tiffany & Co., despite declining sales due to COVID-19 and widespread unrest in the US.

Media reports that the $US16.2 billion deal could be altered or abandoned surfaced in early June, as Tiffany & Co.’s international sales declined by 45 per cent in the first quarter of 2020. Fuelling rumours, LVMH held an executive meeting to discuss the terms of the acquisition – which is the largest in its history – on 3 June.





""We believe that Tiffany is one of the most iconic jewellery brands. As such, it fully has its place in the LVMH portfolio"" Antonio Belloni, Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE (LVMH)

However, speaking at the LVMH annual general meeting – conducted as an online presentation – on 30 June, Antonio Belloni, group managing director LVMH, said, “We believe that Tiffany is one of the most iconic jewellery brands. As such, it fully has its place in the LVMH portfolio.”

The jewellery company’s most recent financial report confirmed it recorded a loss of $US65 million ($AU94.7 million) for the three-month period to 30 April. Declines were concentrated in the US and Asia-Pacific regions, with Mainland China recording an 85 per cent fall in sales in February.

The result was attributed to the COVID-19 pandemic, with approximately 70 per cent of its 324 international stores closed as at 30 April. By 29 May, 80 per cent of international stores had reopened; however, as at 8 June, only 55 per cent of its US stores – Tiffany & Co.’s largest market – had fully or partially reopened.

Yet Alessandro Bogliolo, CEO Tiffany & Co., said recent sales figures in China indicated that a “robust recovery is underway”.

He added that international e-commerce sales had increased 23 per cent for the quarter and represented 15 per cent of Tiffany & Co.’s total sales in 2020, compared with 6 per cent in 2019, 2018 and 2017.

While Bogliolo remained optimistic, the company confirmed it had amended its debt agreements in light of the financial pressure caused by the pandemic, drawing down $US500 million from its revolving credit facility. Tiffany & Co.’s total debt is now $US1.5 billion, a 16 per cent increase from 2019.

The debt restructuring further fuelled speculation LVMH could be preparing to alter the terms of its acquisition. However, Mark Erceg, chief financial officer Tiffany & Co., offered reassurance to shareholders, noting that the debt amendments were permitted under Tiffany & Co.’s Merger Agreement with LVMH.

“Tiffany has an investment-grade balance sheet, has ample cash on hand and was in compliance with all debt covenants as of April 30, 2020. Nonetheless, we still took the decision (as have many other companies) to amend certain of our debt agreements in order to create additional financial covenant headroom given these unprecedented times,” he explained.

Upon the release of its financial results, Tiffany shares fell more than 10 per cent. They were trading at $US121.94 at the time of publication.

LVMH has indicated it will not buy Tiffany & Co. shares on the open market and will maintain its offer of $US135 per share, which was accepted by Tiffany & Co. shareholders in February this year.





""I am confident that Tiffany’s best days remain ahead of us and I am excited we will be taking that journey with LVMH by our side"" Alessandro Bogliolo, Tiffany & Co.

In the report, Bogliolo stated that the LVMH deal – which was initially expected to close in July 2020 – will proceed, saying, “I am confident that Tiffany’s best days remain ahead of us and I am excited we will be taking that journey with LVMH by our side.”

He also addressed delays in international regulatory clearance, confirming that authorities in both Russia and Mexico had approved the acquisition of Tiffany’s subsidiaries in those territories. South Korea’s Korea Fair Trade Commission cleared the takeover to proceed on 12 June.

As previously reported by Jeweller, Australia’s Foreign Investment Review Board (FIRB) was initially expected to approve the takeover in April, however due to changes in the regulatory framework, its review deadline was extended.

On 6 July, Tiffany & Co. informed the US Securities & Exchange Commission that FIRB had cleared the acquisition to proceed; however, the company's filing noted that ""additional regulatory clearances"" and ""other customary closing conditions"" were yet to be finalised.

In results announced by the luxury conglomerate yesterday (27 July), profit from recurring operations for the division that includes Sephora and Starboard Cruise Services counted losses of €308m/$346m.

On DFS specifically, LVMH stated: “A series of cost reduction measures have been undertaken. Its digital strategy has strengthened the relationship with its customers, particularly in China.”

IMPROVEMENT IN CHINA

The Group notes its resilience in an economic environment severely impaired by the coronavirus (Covid-19) crisis that has led to the shutdown of international travel and closure of stores and manufacturing sites in most countries over several months. This has ‘severely penalised’ travel retail and hotel activities, it said.

Group revenue fell by 27% (-28% organic) in the first half of 2020 year-on-year to total €18,393m.

Online sales displayed a ‘significant acceleration’ in H1, although this only partially offset the decline in revenue due to store closures.

Profit from recurring operations fell by 68% to €1,671m and operating margin stood at 9%.

Group share of net profit declined by 84% to €522m, with net financial debt down by 5% to €8,230.

In Q2, revenue dropped by 38% on an organic basis compared to the same period year-on-year, with the US and Europe hit in particular. Although Asia, notably China, has shown a strong improvement.

EXERCISING VIGILANCE

The Group states that the safety of its employees and customers remains the number one priority and teams have demonstrated strong commitment in adjusting to current operating conditions at a time of rigid cost and investment controls.

Bernard Arnault, Chairman and CEO, LVMH Group stated: “Our Maisons have shown remarkable agility in implementing measures to adapt their costs and accelerate the growth of online sales. While we have observed strong signs of an upturn in activity since June, we remain very vigilant for the rest of the year.

“We continue to be driven by a long-term vision, a deep sense of responsibility and a strong commitment to environmental protection, inclusion and solidarity. In the current context, we remain even more firmly dedicated to showing continuous progress in these areas.

“Thanks to the strength of our brands and the responsiveness of our organisation, we are confident that LVMH is in an excellent position to take advantage of the recovery, which we hope will be confirmed in the second half of the year, and to strengthen our lead in the global luxury market in 2020.”

Looking forward, the Group says it will ‘maintain a strategy focused on preserving the value of its brands, based on the exceptional quality of its products and the responsiveness of its teams’.

LVMH could not provide a forecast on its revenue and annual results ‘without knowing the timetable for the return to normal business in the different areas where the Group operates’.

The Group adds that the closing date for the planned Tiffany & Co acquisition rests on the receipt of final regulatory approvals.

A decision to pay an interim dividend would be discussed by the Board of Directors in October and announced thereafter."
Is Dior Catching Up With Chanel? | BoF - The Business of Fashion,"Wed, 22 Jul 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzb2ZmYXNoaW9uLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy9sdXh1cnkvZGlvci1jYXRjaGluZy11cC1jaGFuZWwtY3J1aXNlLWxlY2NlL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS, France — Christian Dior is set to stage a live-streamed runway show Wednesday afternoon in the southern Italian city Lecce despite the fact that no physical audience can attend. It’s the brand’s latest effort to continue to gain market share during a pandemic that has left the luxury industry reeling.

Dior’s revenues and profitability have surged in recent years amid rising demand for its canvas book totes, saddle bags and high-top sneakers, and the brand is determined to stay in the spotlight, Chief Executive Pietro Beccari told BoF in a recent interview . In addition to splashing out on the destination show, it’s planning pop-up stores across the Riviera and sponsoring a sprawling museum exhibit in Shanghai this month.

But does the strong momentum at the LVMH-owned brand mean it could actually catch up with its oldest rival, fellow couture-and-beauty giant Chanel ? A new report shows that Dior is closing the gap — though the brand still has a long way to go.

Dior’s combined sales of fashion and beauty products are estimated to have jumped 24 percent last year, climbing to €6.6 billion ($7.54 billion), according to Morgan Stanley analysts. (LVMH doesn’t report sales for individual brands.)

OQLTT6V6FZCU5K5ZQTFYQKMYIM

Its profitability has also inched up steadily in recent years — a sign that after decades of high levels of investment, LVMH Chairman and Chief Executive Bernard Arnault is finally cashing in at his second-biggest luxury house, which he famously acquired in 1984 for one symbolic franc. (Louis Vuitton remains the largest label in the stable, with estimated sales of €12.7 billion.)

""The brand has now gained the status of a ‘mega brand’ in luxury, allowing it to benefit from a virtuous circle of outsized investments... and higher than average industry growth,” Morgan Stanley analysts Edouard Aubin and Elena Mariani wrote. ""We see no structural reason for Dior's profit not to get close to that of Chanel today.”

For its part, Chanel’s revenues grew 13 percent on a comparable basis to $12.3 billion in 2019. That's faster than the industry average, but not enough to keep its financial lead on Dior from narrowing for a third consecutive year.

As the coronavirus pandemic pushes the fashion industry into its deepest crisis in a generation, Dior could keep gaining on Chanel because of its greater willingness to sell online. While Dior has ramped up e-commerce in recent years, selling its $4,500 Lady Dior purses and $860 t-shirts through its website and even on social platforms like China's WeChat, Chanel is still holding out from selling its handbags or fashion online, even as the company said it expects difficulties from the coronavirus to continue into next year.

The rivalry between the two Parisian houses goes back to Dior's founding in the late 1940s, when Gabrielle ""Coco"" Chanel derided Dior’s fairytale aesthetic, replete with layers of pleated tulle, as regressive.

While Dior's ""New Look"" may have pushed her brand out of the spotlight back then, Chanel has dominated since the 1980s. The late Karl Lagerfeld reinvigorated the house’s tweed suits and quilted handbags, filling the void for a charismatic creative force while its owners, the secretive Wertheimer family, grew the brand into a global empire.

Dior has also enjoyed a high degree of investment under Arnault, who has long maintained that there’s no reason the house couldn’t eventually catch up with its rival. But while Dior’s top-line and visibility have steadily climbed, frequent designer changes, segmented branding, and a higher reliance on seasonal fashion (versus classic luxuries) have held it back from keeping up with Chanel's trajectory.

XLQ7BSI4FBCYZEKWCEFP5KPQRY

Dior's combined EBIT margin for fashion and beauty climbed from 12.3 percent in 2017 to 18.4 percent in 2019, the report estimates, but remains far below Chanel's 28.5 percent margin.

While both houses spend heavily on developing and communicating about new products, Chanel is able to recoup more of that investment in creativity with top-end prices that surged well above sector norms. The €7,600 price tags on Chanel’s quilted leather handbags exclude many clients, to be sure, but the frequent hikes have reinforced the items' power as status symbols, in addition to giving clients the sense that they’re making a good investment by buying now, rather than later.

“Chanel’s brand positioning is unique in that it can be similar to Rolex for watches. When you’re making a purchase it’s not just about fashion and making yourself stand out, it’s also about preservation of value,” said Elspeth Cheung, global brand valuation director at Kantar's BrandZ unit.

While Dior’s prices have also climbed, its policy has been less aggressive. One reason Dior has less room to maneuver on pricing could be that many of its products are seen more as fashion pieces than as timeless luxuries.

Evidence of that perception can be seen in the resale market , where Chanel pieces command on average 70 percent of their original retail prices, according to Charles Gorra, chief executive of the handbag reseller Rebag . Dior pieces go for 45 percent of what customers originally paid, he said.

While surging resale prices for some Dior pieces like vintage saddle bags reflect the brand's current momentum, the catch-up has been isolated to a few hip items. Dior may be on the up, but it's not seen as an investment brand in the league of Chanel. ""Chanel has consistently been seen as a rare and iconic product,"" Gorra said.

A key factor that has powered Chanel's success has been the consistency of its message across price points and product categories, throughout the years. The way Chanel markets a $40 lipstick or $400 sunglasses isn’t that different from how it presents a $4,000 velvet clutch, and the brand has also maintained many strict aesthetic codes from the time of Coco Chanel’s founding through today.

Dior, by contrast, tends to house a multiplicity of voices at any given time—with separate creative directors for womenswear, menswear, and jewellery—as well as tentpole perfumes that pursue their own client in their own way. This approach broadens their appeal, but holds the brand back from projecting a unified image.

That Dior should eventually harmonise its message across product categories is an idea that has been bouncing around the LVMH ecosystem for years — the strategy is referred to internally as ""One Dior."" Dior Couture's Beccari recently confirmed that the fashion and beauty divisions have been working to craft a more coordinated message, particularly online.

But the group knows that a more segmented approach is still what works for them, as they’ve yet to identify a single voice that could speak to the clients of J’adore Dior, Eau Sauvage, and Kim Jones ’ sneaker drops at the same time.

The brand has also had to invest in rebooting its image when it changed creative directors, moving on from figures as prominent as John Galliano, Hedi Slimane, and Raf Simons, who imposed their vision for the brand and then left.

Even if Dior lags behind Chanel in terms of revenue, price positioning and the clarity of its brand image, the current creative directors Maria Grazia Chiuri and Kim Jones do have some of the hottest items of the moment. A lineup of easy-to-sell, hero products — for which clients come to the store knowing exactly what to expect — as well as having a robust e-commerce business could help them to keep gaining share during the coronavirus pandemic. Morgan Stanley estimates Dior’s sales will fall by 14 percent this year, compared with a sector that’s expected to drop 20 percent to 35 percent.

For Dior to catch up, however, it would have to keep growing faster (or shrinking more slowly) than Chanel for several years. The brand may be narrowing the gap, but that's still a tall order against such a juggernaut.

Others have tried: Alessandro Michele 's reboot of Gucci has pushed sales into mega-brand territory, but the brand's beauty partnership with licensee Coty has yet to make a meaningful financial contribution. Hand-stitched leather goods specialist Hermès has the clout to price its goods higher than Chanel's (and is the only one to beat Chanel's performance in the resale market), but their beauty division also lags behind. For perfume giants like Puig's Paco Rabanne , the fashion business usually remains a niche proposition.

This spring, Chanel was able to raise its handbag prices by 5 percent to 17 percent, depending on the region. The move came one year after its charismatic leader, Karl Lagerfeld, passed away and replaced by a more low-profile successor, Virginie Viard , and even as the world economy tumbled due to the coronavirus pandemic. That kind of prestige is built up in the long haul, and is a luxury granted to very few.

Disclosure: LVMH is part of a group of investors who, together, hold a minority interest in The Business of Fashion. All investors have signed shareholder’s documentation guaranteeing BoF’s complete editorial independence.

Bulgari CEO Expects to Recover Lost Sales Within Two Years - The Business of Fashion,"Tue, 07 Jul 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzb2ZmYXNoaW9uLmNvbS9uZXdzL2x1eHVyeS9idWxnYXJpLXJlY292ZXItc2FsZXMtY292aWQtMTktamVhbi1jaHJpc3RvcGhlLWJhYmluL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"ROME, Italy — Bulgari Chief Executive Jean-Christophe Babin said he expects the LVMH-owned jeweller to recover most of the sales it lost due to the Covid-19 pandemic over two years.

“I’m confident that over a period of 24 months, we will have recovered most of what was lost during Covid,” he said in a Bloomberg TV interview. “In our business, it’s never lost, it’s more postponed.”

The chief executive also said he’s sticking to a plan to expand a line of luxury hotels despite the coronavirus outbreak. Within the next two to three months, the brand will announce plans for further openings, including the first in the US, he said.

The pandemic “doesn’t change our strategy an inch,” he said.

The Roman brand — synonymous with some of the extravagant pieces Elizabeth Taylor wore on the set of Cleopatra — was bought in 2011 by LVMH, in what was then its biggest acquisition. Billionaire owner Bernard Arnault is now following that up with LVMH's $16 billion bid for Tiffany & Co., set to close this year.

Jewellery Slump

LVMH’s revenue from watches and jewellery suffered a 26 percent drop in the first quarter, the steepest slump for any of its product categories. The decline reflects the segment’s reliance on physical boutiques that sell products like $2,300 Colosseum-inspired B.Zero1 rings and $18,200 snake-like Serpenti Tubogas watches.

Babin said Bulgari saw triple-digit growth rates in e-commerce, but online represents less than 10 percent of total revenue.

“It does help, but certainly doesn’t offset the closure of our stores,” he said.

The consumer demand recovery has been “beyond belief” in countries like China and South Korea after 10 weeks of shutdowns, according to the chief executive.

Babin expects a ""boom in China,"" following a strategy by the local authorities to encourage more and more domestic spending. The mainland is promoting luxury consumption as Hong Kong loses popularity with Chinese tourists in recent years because of protests against Beijing's attempt to control the independent territory.

Bulgari is also noticing positive signs of recovery in Germany. “They are compensating since April what they couldn’t buy in the first quarter,” Babin said, adding that jewellery is less exposed to seasonality than fashion.

Shares in LVMH fell as much as 1.8 percent in Paris. They have dropped 3.6 percent this year.

After reopening a property in Rome, Bulgari has four locations under construction, which will bring its roster up to 10. By 2026 or 2027, the brand aims for 20.

The jeweller is expanding in hotels despite dire forecasts for luxury travel this year. McKinsey recently predicted demand for hotel stays in the US may only return to pre-pandemic levels in 2023, while the luxury segment will have the slowest recovery.

Bulgari plans to add a second Italian hotel in Rome in 2022, having secured a property near its flagship store on via Condotti. The brand is set to open a hotel in Paris next year, a stone’s throw from the headquarter of its parent company. Bulgari also plans openings in Moscow and Tokyo in 2022 and 2023, respectively.

The first US hotel will be in Miami, Los Angeles or New York, Babin said.

Loewe's Brand Within a Brand: Is This the New Way to Do Diffusion? - The Business of Fashion,"Thu, 16 Jul 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzb2ZmYXNoaW9uLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy9sdXh1cnkvbG9ld2Utam9uYXRoYW4tYW5kZXJzb24tcGF1bGFzLWliaXphLWx2bWgtYWNxdWlyZWQv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS, France — Anyone who has poked their head in a European luxury boutique in recent years knows that €500 won't usually get you far. But as Europe's coronavirus lockdowns lift and its affluent residents race to the sea, visitors to Loewe's pop-up stores in Saint Tropez and Ibiza might be surprised to see that the former saddle-maker, long positioned as a Spanish answer to Hermès, is selling several handbags below that threshold, with some models as low as €340 ($387).

To be sure, these small totes from Loewe's ""Paula's Ibiza"" collection are made of woven palm leaves rather than the house's famous leathers, but they've got calfskin details and a logo to boot. It may be a luxury-level price tag for a grass basket, but it's a far cry from the €2,350 sticker-price on Loewe's flagship Puzzle bags, which have been a staple of Artistic Director Jonathan Anderson's reinvention of the LVMH-owned house.

Now in its fourth season, the laid-back vacation-wear collaboration between Loewe and the legendary 1970s Ibiza label Paula’s has grown from a tiny capsule collection into a diversified offer complete with sunglasses, ready-to-wear and even its own perfume.

Anderson said he’s been “rethinking the way you build a brand.” In his eighth year at the creative helm of Loewe, the summery line has become a way to balance budget and aesthetics, without undermining the house’s high-end positioning and focus on craft.

At first glance, the Paula’s Ibiza line-up of tie-dye sweatshirts may appear to be a de-facto “second line” alongside €9,500 gowns from Loewe’s runway offer, but Anderson said a more accessible positioning was the organic result of wanting to capture a laid-back summer spirit with more casual products and natural materials.

“I don’t see Paula’s Ibiza as being a secondary product to Loewe at all. I think it complements the brand,” the 35-year-old Irish designer said in a phone call last week. “It’s about addressing an aesthetic niche that was missing, dressing for that summer vibe.”

You won't hear LVMH calling the line diffusion--but by ramping up the house's offer at entry-level prices each summer, Paula's is serving a somewhat similar purpose by broadening the appeal of what could have been considered, until recently, a very niche house.

Loewe Acquires Paula's

As the project struck a chord with consumers and retailers like MatchesFashion, Loewe acquired Paula’s Ibiza’s trademark and archives from its founders for an undisclosed sum last year, so that Anderson can keep building out the line as a brand within a brand.

Even as coronavirus travel restrictions shuttered stores (and rendered vacation-wear an improbable proposition), the line “exceeded expectations” via e-commerce, Loewe said. MatchesFashion also said the line was performing well, with a handful of items awaiting a restock. It seems that even when customers can’t live out their escapist, hedonistic island fantasies, they may still want to act them out through their wardrobes.

While Loewe's owner LVMH doesn't report sales for individual labels, the group's Chairman Bernard Arnault called out Anderson's turnaround of the house during his annual results presentation earlier this year, saying the brand had a ""remarkable growth rate."" While the house is dwarfed by multi-billion-euro stablemates like Louis Vuitton and Dior, Loewe's success has been a welcome bright spot among LVMH's long tail of smaller labels. Analyst estimates of Loewe's revenues varied, ranging from €250 million to €500 million in 2019.

As Loewe expands from selling in handbag corners at third-party retailers to growing its own network of boutiques (the label opened a new location in Munich this week), more accessible lines like Paula’s are helping the house to broaden its reach beyond luxury leather goods. “The goal has not been to make the brand exclusive, per se,” Toledano said. “If you just need the right dress to go to the beach, we can provide that.”

“They seem to be working to broaden their appeal, and recruit new consumers,” Bernstein analyst Luca Solca said. “With new middle-class shoppers coming into the market, particularly from China, accessible luxuries have been growing.”

Anderson first reached out to the founders of Paula’s to collaborate on a capsule collection in 2017. He remembered the brand from trips to the island as a child and wanted to tap into this inspiration as a recurring theme at Loewe.

Avoiding A 'Blurry' Narrative

Sub-brands like D&G, DKNY, Marc by Marc Jacobs and Burberry Brit have all been phased out in recent years as most luxury labels decided that a unified voice was essential to communicating online. These lines helped brands cash in on catwalk creativity with a broader segment of shoppers, but comparisons between main lines and their cheaper, less-focused offspring were often unflattering to both. As the second lines grew their own parallel cost structures, complete with separate supply chains and distribution networks, brand managers found it harder and harder to steer the ship.

""I don't see Paula's Ibiza as being a secondary product""

“I think with diffusion a lot of brands diluted their message too much,” added Anderson. “There can be a big risk that the narratives become blurry.”

Anderson is doing things differently. Rather than expanding directly down-market — offering simpler, cheaper versions of the main line — Paula’s Ibiza is demarcated by its fiercely cheerful aesthetic, with neon tie-dyes, giant smileys and bold vintage prints. High-end items are peppered into the line, like a 1,200 oversized cashmere pullover, helping to elevate the concept. He’s also limited Paula’s to selling for the summer months, true to its Balearic vacation inspiration. Don’t expect to see a Paula’s Ibiza winter parka anytime soon.

Luxury brands like Loewe or its larger Kering-owned Italian rival Bottega Veneta, which trade in discreet appeal, still have to reach a certain scale to remain profitable. It requires a delicate balance to reach new consumers without losing appeal amongst connoisseurs.

Pushing volumes at entry-level price points can be particularly treacherous and the ubiquitous baseball caps and graphic T-shirts of yesteryear can often haunt luxury labels, holding them back from retooling their aesthetic when sales cool.

“When brands start trying to be everything to everyone, that’s when it becomes uncool,” said Damien Paul, head menswear buyer at MatchesFashion. “[With Paula’s Ibiza] I think there’s a good balance between taking a new direction to bring in a new customer, and still maintaining the same brand DNA.”

Ultralight Structure

Another advantage to Loewe’s “brand within a brand” is its ultralight footprint. With no separate cost structure of its own, and distribution controlled as strictly as the main line’s, Paula’s Ibiza doesn’t weigh heavily on the company and could be pared back or retooled easily if it did end up denting the Loewe’s luxe image or cannibalising main line sales.

In that way, Paula's Ibiza is less reminiscent of the second lines of yesteryear and shares some similarities to the ephemeral sub-brands at Moncler, which shifted to collaborating with a rotating cast of as many as 8 designers in 2018 as part of its ""Genius"" strategy aimed at offering shoppers newness at the speed of Instagram.

“Things are changing at breakneck speed, we have to be challenging how brands are built up, if not they’ll become very stale,” Anderson said.

Fenty Skin aims to elevate the inclusivity conversation - Glossy,"Tue, 28 Jul 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmdsb3NzeS5jby9iZWF1dHkvZmVudHktc2tpbi1pbmNsdXNpdmUtYmVhdXR5LWxhdW5jaC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Fenty shocked the beauty scene in Sept. 2017 with its disruptive approach to inclusive makeup. Now the brand wants to take that strategy to skin care.

Fenty Skin is positioning itself as the “the new culture of skincare,” according to a splash page on FentyBeauty.com. The brand officially launches exclusively on FentySkin.com on July 31, although those who sign up to receive its emails can gain early access on July 29. (Its makeup counterpart debuted first with Sephora.) Fenty Beauty has remained mum about the new launch, save for strategic teasers in marketing channels: Its first post through a new Fenty Skin Instagram account, appeared on July 14, while a new campaign video sent via email reached fans on July 18. According to the brand’s video content, the initial products will be a cleanser, a toner and a face moisturizer. Fenty did not respond to requests for comment.

Though traversing into skin care from cosmetics can be a difficult transition to make, Fenty Skin’s arrival is not unchartered, especially since makeup sales continue to suffer. Kylie Cosmetics released Kylie Skin in March 2019, Victoria Beckham Beauty collaborated with Augustinus Bader for its first skin-care product in Nov. 2019, Huda Beauty launched Wishful skin care in February, and Becca Cosmetics launched its first skin care-makeup hybrid in July.

Fenty Beauty’s disruption of the cosmetics category, with its 40 and then 50 shades of foundation, has been the brand’s biggest testament to date. Although some brands already offered 40 shades of foundation or more, none acted as a catalyst for increased diversity and inclusivity like Fenty. With skin-care inclusivity poised as the next big movement in beauty, Fenty Skin’s timing is right.

“When it comes to inclusivity and diversity, there’s something really raw about the brand,” said Danielle Chocron, managing director for Blonde + Co. creative agency, which works with beauty companies like Innisfree and Kérastase. “It’s very clean and fresh, but also feels pure and has some edge. It feels a bit daring.”

Notably, Fenty has been a huge moneymaker for both Sephora, where it is exclusively sold in the U.S., and Kendo Brands, the LVMH-owned beauty incubator. LVMH reportedly launched the brand with a $10 million investment, and Forbes “conservatively” estimated the brand was worth $3 billion as of June 2019. Sephora, Kendo and LVMH did not respond to requests for comment."

WORLD'S FASTEST GROWING CONGLOMERATE BELLAGRAPH NOVA LEADS THE WAY FOR GLOBAL SUCCESS ... - ACROFAN USA,"Wed, 29 Jul 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiNGh0dHA6Ly91cy5hY3JvZmFuLmNvbS9kZXRhaWwucGhwP251bWJlcj0zMTY4NDYmVUE9UEPSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS, July 29, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- The Bellagraph Nova (BN) Group is ready to share its vision and strategic plans to achieve further expansion and global success. This recently formed visionary conglomerate has already instituted its own revolutionary blueprint to ensure a future legacy that has never been achieved before.

Most successful multinational conglomerate such as LVMH has prided itself on adopting a decentralized format where each of its companies or ""houses"" operate autonomously and independent of one another. While this has led to great success for LVMH, the BN Group has adapted similar business practice but with the strategic flair of implementing a centralized marketing division headquartered in Paris, France, to maintain accountability and ensure homogenous global development for all of its global entities and partners.

The current fiscal year has presented a historic set of challenges for all businesses. ""Growth"" has been a seldomly used term in current business conversations. While most companies believed that ""people make the difference,"" most companies have inevitably been forced to retrench and downsize due to the global economic downturn. On the other hand, the executive team at the BN Group have staunchly rejected any contractionary proposals to reduce and tighten up its global workface. In fact, the BN Group has gone the opposite direction of most and actually invested in upgrading resources to further develop and enhance its workforce's performance and productivity through educational projects, coaching seminars, internal career development programs, and advanced degree courses. While the BN Group also understands that ""people make the difference,"" it believes the key to the company's success is further empowering them. In addition, the BN Group has also aggressively sought to recruit global talents to further strengthen its strategic team.



Mr. Kirk Wagar

Most recently, the Bellagraph Nova Group welcomed former United States Ambassador Mr. Kirk Wagar as strategic advisor to its board of directors. Founding partner Mr. Nelson Loh said, ""Ambassador Wagar has been a trusted adviser and personal friend of mine and during this challenging pandemic period, we have spoken frequently on how we could potentially work more closely in realizing a shared common vision for creating a better future. With Bellagraph Nova on the verge of taking flight, I am extremely excited to have Ambassador Wagar join us with his years of experience as a former US Ambassador as well as his rich expertise on board numerous global strategic advisory boards."" Ambassador Kirk Wagar has served on global advisory and strategic boards such as LVMH's L Catterton Private Equity Fund, the Ontario Government pension fund - OMERS, as well as the US$30billion Tech focused Private Equity Fund Insight Partners etc.



Mr. Nereides Antonio Giamundo de Bourbon

In addition to Mr. Wagar's appointment, the BN Group is ecstatic with the designation of LVMH's former Global Head of Marketing and Business Strategy, Mr. Nereides A.G. De Bourbon. As the newly appointed Global Head of Marketing and Investment Strategy, Nereides brings his unparalleled track record, knowledge, and expertise to a young multinational conglomerate on the fast track to achieving prominence and global recognition. On comparisons between these two companies, Nereides shared some of the finer facets. ""Both LVMH and the BN Group have been able to achieve a heightened state of synergy and that has been pivotal in their continued success. While LVMH is open to sharing resources amongst its developing houses despite their relative autonomy, the BN Group believes a more cohesive synergy is realized amongst all of its 31 entities through co-branding and sharing common objectives. The BN Group also welcomes collaborations with governments and other prominent business entities.""



Mr. Terence Loh, Ms. Evangeline Shen, Mr. Nelson Loh

One of the most pronounced differences between LVMH and the BN Group is simply the DNA to their success. Founding partner Mr. Terence Loh elaborated more on this insightful comparison. ""The Bellagraph Nova Group is categorically in its early stages as we all here are committed and focused on building this dream into a reality as a singular definitive conglomerate that innovates and delivers the very best in luxury, healthcare, and technology. On the other hand, LVMH is steeped in history and heritage. While this 'savoir-faire' core culture has led to the continued success of selling its luxury brands with a rich story to share, it also inevitably restricts its entities from deviating and even disrupting too much of its established branding and identity. The BN Group is essentially the antithesis of this ideology so it is capable of limitless creative freedom in developing new products and innovations while utilizing the latest technology.""

To elaborate, the LVMH Group is entrenched in the past with its renowned identity in luxury and history. Because of its reliance in addressing its heritage when proposing new marketing strategy, its strongest asset also poses somewhat as an encumbrance when contending with past traditions and creative ideas. Unlike this culture, the BN Group is essentially not anchored to its past and possesses the unhindered potential to develop at an accelerated pace into all potential sectors. Furthermore, the BN Group is open to consider investing in both developed and emerging markets whether they have a proven track record for success or not. One underlying business objective for the BN Group is to provide support to economically-challenged countries and provide the necessary resources to contribute to their economic growth and development.

When it comes to comparisons on durability, Chairman and Founding partner Ms. Evangeline Shen shared this explanation on the similarities and differences between these two multinational conglomerates. ""I am truly impressed with how LVMH CEO Mr. Bernard Arnault has been able to retain the iconic heritage of its renowned Houses while still constantly reinventing them to optimize its durability against the fickle tastes and demands of modern times. He truly understands that the consumer is the heart and soul of LVMH's continued success and ecosystem. While LVMH focuses solely in the luxury sector, the BN Group has achieved unmatched success with guaranteeing its durability through tremendous engagement in all fields. We aspire to influence each person and the global economy as a whole. On top of that, the BN Group is unwavering in its commitment to respecting the environment and all resources similar to LVMH. However, we endeavor to develop and integrate new technologies to protecting the environment and always innovating with sustainability as a core priority.""
