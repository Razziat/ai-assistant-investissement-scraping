LVMH's Donna Karan quits as designer of own name brand - Business Insider,"Wed, 01 Jul 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vci1sdm1ocy1kb25uYS1rYXJhbi1xdWl0cy1hcy1kZXNpZ25lci1vZi1vd24tbmFtZS1icmFuZC0yMDE1LTfSAWJodHRwczovL3d3dy5idXNpbmVzc2luc2lkZXIuY29tL3ItbHZtaHMtZG9ubmEta2FyYW4tcXVpdHMtYXMtZGVzaWduZXItb2Ytb3duLW5hbWUtYnJhbmQtMjAxNS03P2FtcA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS (Reuters) - Donna Karan has resigned as chief designer of the fashion brand she founded and sold to French luxury goods owner LVMH as the group opts to concentrate on its more accessible DKNY line.

Parent company Donna Karan International (DKI) said it planned to suspend fashion shows and designer collections ""for a period of time"" but would continue to support its significant license business for products such as watches and eyewear.

""DKI will also reorganize its teams and restructure in order to substantially increase its focus on the DKNY brand,"" it said in a statement on Wednesday.

New-York born Karan, 66, said that after ""much soul-searching"" she had decided to spend more time on her separate Urban Zen brand.

Fashion experts had long been saying that her mainline Donna Karan New York label lost appeal among consumers after becoming too zany with designs featuring tribal prints.

The move is part of a wider clean-up at LVMH's fashion and leather brands under the stewardship of division chief Pierre-Yves Roussel.

In April, the company hired Dao-Yi Chow and Maxwell Osborne, founders of the New York-based and award-winning brand Public School, as designers for DKNY, a more street-smart and less expensive label than the high-end Donna Karan brand.

Analysts estimate DKI made just over 400 million euros ($444 million) in 2014 with more than 90 percent of revenue coming from the DKNY brand.

The two brands together have over 275 retail stores and more than 80 in-store outlets across 41 countries.

When Donna Karan sold her brand to LVMH in 2001, the group was looking to gain a stronger presence in the US market.

At the time, she had obtained from LVMH the right to exploit the Urban Zen brand she had also created, a move that surprised many industry observers since it was a rival brand to her own.

DKI said Donna Karan would remain an adviser to the company.

Earlier this year, LVMH decided to restructure the underperforming Marc by Marc Jacobs line and fold it into the main Marc Jacobs collection which is also being streamlined.

Marc Jacobs also been closing shops including a flagship one on the plush Place du Palais Royal in Paris.

In 2013, Marc Jacobs left the creative helm of Louis Vuitton, LVMH's biggest luxury brand, to focus on his eponymous brand and its planned initial public offering expected to take place in the next few years.

"Sephora owner, LVMH snaps up Singapore based start-up Luxola - CosmeticsDesign.com USA","Mon, 13 Jul 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNvc21ldGljc2Rlc2lnbi5jb20vQXJ0aWNsZS8yMDE1LzA3LzE0L1NlcGhvcmEtb3duZXItTFZNSC1zbmFwcy11cC1TaW5nYXBvcmUtYmFzZWQtc3RhcnQtdXAtTHV4b2xh0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Luxola.com, which has rapidly become a serious contender in online cosmetics retailers in Southeast Asia, was bought for an undisclosed amount which the company CEO, Horowitz-Burdick says will enable the brand to take its 'vision forward'​ with 'greater market reach'.​

The e-commerce retailer launched just over four years ago and specializes in masstige and luxury international brands.

""Investing in Luxola is a unique opportunity to penetrate the online beauty market and accelerate Sephora’s growth in Southeast Asia​,” Anne-Véronique Bruel, president of Sephora Asia told regional publication Tech in Asia.​

E-commerce in Asia is a valuable investment for international players - if done in the right way. Recognising the challenges in this arena, beauty retailer Sephora also turned to e-mall, 'Jingding' recently, to extend its reach.

According to Bruel, the partnership is a global first for the retailer and will offer Jingding shoppers exclusive and new cosmetics.

Online investment​

On hearing the news of the deal, analysts like 'MarketWatch' reckon things haven't been easy for Sephora since setting up its website in 2013, as its struggling to compete with other cosmetic retailers like Jumei.

According to Sephora Asia president Bruel, another benefit of that partnership will be cracking down on counterfeiting, which accounts for up to 20 per cent of China's cosmetics market.

JD.com claims that it has focused on creating a business model that helps to 'ensure authenticity' and that the combination of direct sales where it controls the sourcing process, to a limited number of sellers allows it to have greater quality oversight.

This didn't go unnoticed with the beauty retailer; ""We’ve seen the effort by JD.com that they value authenticity,"" ​Sephora China e-commerce VP, Helen Zhou said in a recent interview with Fortune magazine."
Grand unveiling: LVMH's La Samaritane to reopen in 2018 - Cosmetics Business,"Wed, 22 Jul 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vY29zbWV0aWNzYnVzaW5lc3MuY29tL2dyYW5kLXVudmVpbGluZy1sdm1oLXMtbGEtc2FtYXJpdGFuZS10by1yZW9wZW4taW4tMjAxOC0xMTA1MzLSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The public are being given a glimpse into what the refurbished La Samaritane building will look like when it is unveiled in 2018, thanks to a new exhibition.

The La Maison du Projet 2.0 exhibition, at 83 Rue de Rivoli, features three Occulus Rift stations that are designed to place visitors into the heart of the store, while HD screens project images of Paris. Since opening it has seen nearly 50,000 visitors come through its doors.

The historic LVMH-owned La Samaritane department store, located between the Louvre and Notre-Dame, was closed in 2005 for safety reasons and has been at the centre of numerous legal discussions over what should be done with the striking building.

However, last month, LVMH released a statement saying it could confirm that La Samaritane had been given permission by the Conseil d’Etat to renovate the building located on rue de Rivoli.

The building permit for the Seine facing side of La Samaritane had already been issued in December 2012 and approved in April 2014. But La Samaritane was held back by the rue de Rivoli side. The latest permission means the building has now resumed its renovation project of the entire site which, once completed, will directly create more than 2,200 jobs.

The €500m renovation project will see the LVMH-owned space reborn as a luxury department store and five-star Cheval Blanc hotel, with 72 rooms, 96 social housing units, offices and a creche.

La Samaritane dates back to 1870 and traditionally featured a mix of Art Nouveau and Art Deco architecture. The new renovation is being overseen by Japanese architectural company SANAA, which has created a design that places emphasis on openness and clarity, according to LVMH."
"Anti-corruption Affects LV Sales in China, Making it Sell Steamed Bun - People's Daily","Tue, 07 Jul 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiM2h0dHA6Ly9lbi5wZW9wbGUuY24vbi8yMDE1LzA3MDcvYzkwODgyLTg5MTYzODcuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The world’s largest luxury goods company LVMH has reported disappointing sales. Due to China's anti-corruption campaign and decreased interests among its Chinese customers, the company has expanded its business to the Chinese restaurant business.

It was reported that starting in 2014, LV sales began declining after a five profitable years in the past. The decline is forcing the French luxury goods giant to switch to other businesses to diversify its investment.

Experts here say the reason behind the switch could be China’s ongoing anti-corruption campaign, which targets corrupted high-ranking officials. These officials used to receive” luxury gifts,” and wear brand names to flaunt their status. Another reason may be that the newly rich have begun developing a more unique taste, instead of following others in wearing the same brand name.

Facing this dilemma, last year LVMH’s private equity arm L Capital Asia, spent more than $100 million on purchasing a 90% stake in the Chinese restaurant chain Crystal Jade.

Crystal Jade, founded in 1991, specializes in Cantonese cuisine, including dim sum, handmade noodles and baked goods. The firm is based in Singapore and has over a hundred outlets across Asia, including China, Hong Kong and a number of Southeast Asian countries."
LVMH to take on the Apple Watch - 9Honey Style,"Mon, 20 Jul 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vc3R5bGUubmluZS5jb20uYXUvbGF0ZXN0L2x2bWgtdG8tdGFrZS1vbi10aGUtYXBwbGUtd2F0Y2gvMmU4OTZmMWQtNWQwYi00NGZhLWE4OWItOWU0MzhhYmViNDIx0gFEaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAubmluZS5jb20uYXUvYXJ0aWNsZS8yZTg5NmYxZC01ZDBiLTQ0ZmEtYTg5Yi05ZTQzOGFiZWI0MjE?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"When Apple launched a $10,000 watch in April, it was only a matter of time before the luxury timepiece companies fought back.

The president of LVMH’s watch division, Jean-Claude Biver, has revealed that the multinational plans to do just that by launching its own smart watch to rival Apple’s.

Biver, who oversees brands such as Zenith, Hublot and Tag Hueur, told German papers that he ""welcomed the arrival of the Apple Watch, because the marketing power of the Apple brand will help create a new class of clients enthusiastic about luxury watches”.

Prices for the LVMH device will reportedly start at around $2,115 and the company hopes to make its biggest splash in the Chinese market.

Despite a pre-order list of more than four million people and a reputation as one of the newest status symbols, Apple Watch sales have reportedly been sluggish.

Given wearable technology is proving a tricky trend to master, we’re looking forward to seeing what LVMH has planned."
Bernard Arnault: 'I don't like women who try to dress too young' - The Telegraph,"Sun, 26 Jul 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRlbGVncmFwaC5jby51ay9saWZlc3R5bGUvMTE3NTY0MDgvQmVybmFyZC1Bcm5hdWx0LUktZG9udC1saWtlLXdvbWVuLXdoby10cnktdG8tZHJlc3MtdG9vLXlvdW5nLmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Two decades after buying the ailing House of Dior in 1984, Arnault had turned the company into one of the “star brands” of his luxury empire, one he continued to expand upon throughout the 1990s. Is he still as ambitious now as he was then? “I’m not sure ambitious is the right word,” he frowns. “What I love is to win. What I love is being number one. But yes, today I still feel passionate about taking on brands like Dior, and mixing those world famous roots with modernity,” he explains, opening a tiny mother-of-pearl pill box and dropping two sweeteners into his espresso. “Business is very exciting. That moment where you’re about to do a huge deal and you’re not quite sure if it’s going to happen or not… And then there’s the moment where a deal you’ve done keeps developing beyond what anyone expected. When I took over Louis Vuitton, everyone said: ‘It’s already so big – what more can you do?’ And since then we’ve multiplied that success ten fold.” Not that money has ever been Arnault’s primary motivation. “Not at all,” he insists. “It’s just a consequence of what I do.” But not an unpleasant one? He gives a Gallic shrug. “The reality is that most of the money is in the company. It’s certainly not the kind of money that means that I could tomorrow go buy whatever I want or go to the casino and go mad….” Power, then? Surely having his amount of power feels good? “No,” he dead-pans. “What feels good is choice. Having the freedom of choice. The only thing that is imposed on me professionally speaking is my own long-term vision of things. People think of politicians having true power, but that’s less and less true. After all they are often constrained or being edged into a corner by a whole series of contingencies. Even Obama is in an extraordinary position where the power he holds over the finances of his country is very limited, which must be extremely frustrating. I’m lucky in that I can say: ‘I want my group to be in such and such a situation in ten or twenty years’ time’ and then formulate a plan to make that happen.”"
MACAU DAILY TIMES 澳門每日時報LVMH rises after biggest profit boost since 2012 on fashion gain - Macau Daily Times,"Thu, 30 Jul 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vbWFjYXVkYWlseXRpbWVzLmNvbS5tby9sdm1oLXJpc2VzLWFmdGVyLWJpZ2dlc3QtcHJvZml0LWJvb3N0LXNpbmNlLTIwMTItb24tZmFzaGlvbi1nYWluLmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE rose in Paris trading after the world’s largest luxury-goods maker reported its strongest earnings increase in three years.

First-half profit from recurring operations rose 15 percent to 2.96 billion euros (USD3.3 billion) as sales of fashion and leather goods accelerated and the drinks unit returned to growth, the Paris-based company said late Tuesday. Analysts predicted 2.93 billion euros, according to the average of estimates compiled by Bloomberg. The shares rose as much as 3.7 percent.

LVMH recorded strong sales in Europe and the U.S., while the unit that includes handbag maker Louis Vuitton overcame declines from the brand in China, Macau and Hong Kong to post 10 percent growth in the second quarter, Chief Financial Officer Jean-Jacques Guiony said on a conference call. The earnings increase was the most since a 20 percent gain in the first half of 2012.

Improving trends at Vuitton confirm “the success of the brand’s repositioning strategy and prospects of a return to double-digit earnings growth in 2015,” said Thomas Chauvet, an analyst at Citigroup in London. He reiterated his buy rating.

The shares rose 2.9 percent to 170.60 euros as of 9:02 a.m. yesterday in the French capital.

Fashion and leather-goods sales increased at twice the pace analysts had predicted and accelerated from a 1 percent gain in the first three months. Vuitton’s sales in Japan and Europe are benefiting from a shift of business from China, Macau and Hong Kong, where they fell about 10 percent, Guiony said.

The CFO also said it’s too early to confirm that rents will fall in Hong Kong even as LVMH holds talks with landlords there. Gucci owner Kering SA and other luxury companies are demanding lower store charges there to reflect the island city’s waning appeal with wealthy Chinese shoppers.

Guiony’s comments on China and the growing calls for lower rents in Hong Kong weighed on shares of rival Prada SpA, which fell as much as 7.2 percent in Hong Kong to the lowest since January 2012. A block trade of about 0.8 percent of Prada’s shares exchanged hands.
