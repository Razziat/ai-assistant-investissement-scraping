The Story of How Givenchy Ended up Under the Umbrella of LVMH - The Fashion Law,"Fri, 10 Apr 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWZhc2hpb25sYXcuY29tL3RoZS1zdG9yeS1vZi1ob3ctZ2l2ZW5jaHktZW5kZWQtdXAtdW5kZXItdGhlLXVtYnJlbGxhLW9mLWx2bWgv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"In the fall of 2004, “in the conference room of an exquisite townhouse off Hanover Square in London, two dozen executives of luxury powerhouse LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton were contemplating a critical question: Who should be the new women’s wear designer of Givenchy? Around the table are managers of LVMH brands from four continents, including some from leather-goods maker Louis Vuitton,” Fortune’s Janet Guyon set the stage. Taking a prominent seat at the lengthy table on that day in September was, of course, LVMH chairman Bernard Arnault.

“Our strategy is to bring the star status [of Louis Vuitton] to other brands,” says then-55-year old Arnault, the French businessman who had garnered himself a reputation as an elegant-yet-utterly ruthless brand-acquirer, a “wolf in cashmere” clothing if you will. “We have to build for the future.” The pending appointment at Givenchy would heavily depend on that.

Arnault and his stable of trusted colleagues had come together by virtue of the fact that Arnault’s Paris-based conglomerate had acquired Givenchy 16 years prior, with Henry Racier, the group’s then-vice chairman and president, spearheading the deal. The acquisition – one that would see Paris-based Givenchy and its “designs and ateliers, which were positioned at the top of and played a key role in international fashion,” as LVMH would describe it years later – brought into the fray of what would become the world’s largest luxury goods conglomerate. But the deal would not close before LVMH had brought the affiliated-but-independently owned Parfums Givenchy under its ownership umbrella two years earlier (technically prior to the formation of the LVMH entity).

In fact, Louis Vuitton had already come into possession of Parfums Givenchy two years prior in 1986 when the then-132 year old leather goods house bought a champagne and perfume group called Veuve Clicquot. In absorbing that group, Louis Vuitton was also taking control of Parfums Givenchy, which Veuve Clicquot had purchased from the house’s eponymous founder Count Hubert James Marcel Taffin de Givenchy in 1981.

Shortly after Louis Vuitton acquired Veuve Clicquot – and thus, Parfums Givenchy – in 1986, Racamier oversaw another deal in furtherance of his quest to build a family-owned leather goods company (Louis Vuitton) into the biggest, mightiest name in luxury in the world, which included “modernizing the way Vuitton made and marketed its leather goods, and tapping the immense Asian market,” per the New York Times. (It also saw Yves Carcelle, who was brought in to run Louis Vuitton in the 1990s, “work to create crucial buzz via a combination of PR stunts, celebrity endorsements, and, most effectively, artificial scarcity.”).

That deal was the merger between Louis Vuitton and spirits group Moët-Hennessy, the one that would create LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton in the summer of 1987. It was only after that, in 1988, that the acquisition of the Givenchy couture house – on that author Dana Thomas later called “one of the last of the old school of haute couture, where gorgeous clothes were made for a woman to live in, not to decorate her, and design, however elaborate, always bowed to function” – came into fruition.

Privately held for nearly 40 years, Givenchy’s founder Mr. de Givenchy “had never set out to sell to Arnault,” the Independent’s Marion Hume wrote in July 1995. However, in 1988, 36 years after he launched his eponymous couture house, “Mr. de Givenchy was keen to concentrate solely on his creative oeuvre.” Couture was evolving in the 1980s, with traditional couture houses branching out into more accessible products to boost their bottom lines, and in the process the business was becoming one with a truly global reach. Brands were setting the stage for time tested model that sees “the media buzz generated from haute couture shows” – and now, even over-the-top ready-to-wear ones – used to “boost sales of high-margin items such as perfumes, handbags and sunglasses,” as the Wall Street Journal has put it.

Mr. Givenchy had no interest in building out or managing the business side of the equation. “He wanted to off-load what had become financial burdens, and was delighted to sell out to an old- school businessman.” That man was, of course, Henry Racamier.

Mr. de Givenchy – who stood at a towering 6’6″ and was nearly 60 years old at the time – “was particularly delighted,” per Hume, that the roughly $45 million deal that LVMH offered him included a seven-year “contract that promised him a reported salary of one million French francs a month.” Money would not be an issue. The deal also reportedly came with an agreement that Mr. de Givenchy could remain as creative director of his namesake label for as long as he wished.

“As long as he wished” would ultimately last for seven years, as Mr. de Givenchy retired in 1995, and his departure was said to be less than a friendly one. While Hume reported in the summer of 1995 that de Givenchy was “retiring voluntarily,” and not “bowing out because he been failed by his creative powers,” Thomas wrote of the contrary at the time, stating that despite “the official guise of retirement,” de Givenchy was actually “being sacked,”

Reflecting on the matter five years later, Thomas stated, “Hubert de Givenchy was pushed into retirement after Arnault assumed control of his couture house through his takeover of LVMH.” It was well known in French fashion circles,” after all, “that he and Arnault have a strained rapport at best.” As such, de Givenchy had to go, and Arnault’s “decidedly un-French” way of “manhandling company founders,” as Thomas put it, continued to gain steam.

Mr. de Givenchy was abreast of his pending departure ahead of the haute couture collection he showed in Paris on July 12, 1995. However, what he did not know is who would be succeeding him at the house that be built. He would come to find out an hour after he put his swansong on the runway. It was then that LVMH and Givenchy’s CEO, Richard Simonin, announced that John Galliano would take his place. Mr. Galliano, then just 35 years old, was a notorious wild-child but also a fashion industry darling. Vogue editor-in-chief Anna Wintour was said to used her powerful say to solidify his appointment.

“I don’t know the gentleman except through the newspapers and magazines,” de Givenchy said of Galliano. After all, he “was not involved in choosing his successor,” the New York Times noted in its announcement of the news. Writing for the Washington Post, Thomas stated that “Givenchy, after decades of success, was nearly completely excluded from the process of finding his replacement. In fact, Mr. de Givenchy – the man, who was credited with defining simple elegance for an entire generation of women, with some of the most famous being Audrey Hepburn, Jacqueline Kennedy and the Duchess of Windsor – learned who was to become the successor to his world-famous fashion house at the same time” as everyone else … via a release from his own press office.

Galliano’s tenure at Givenchy would prove to be limited; the first British designer to head a French haute couture, he showed his debut collection on January 21, 1996, and by that October, he had been moved to the helm of Christian Dior, another LVMH-affiliated house, where the top spot was left vacant when Gianfranco Ferré, the Italian couturier, who had been designing at Christian Dior since the late 1980s left.

As for Givenchy, it would see 27-year old Alexander McQueen (“who had been adamant that the only couture house he had his eye on was Yves St Laurent,” according to the Independent. “The offer was seemingly too much to turn down.”) and Julien Macdonald respectively take the helm before LVMH’s heads ended up at that table that day in London in 2004, pondering the next move for the house.

They would ultimately – after much consideration – select Riccardo Tisci, the Italian designer known for his gritty romanticism, for the job. Tisci was appointed in 2005.

Will LVMH's Resilience Last for the Rest of 2020? - Jing Daily,"Thu, 16 Apr 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vamluZ2RhaWx5LmNvbS9wb3N0cy9sdm1ocy1yZXNpbGllbmNlLWxhc3QtZm9yLXRoZS1yZXN0LW9mLTIwMjDSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"What happened

The luxury sector’s bellwether, LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, reported revenue of 10.6 billion euros for the first quarter of 2020 today, down 15 percent compared to the same period in 2019.

Among its five main business sectors, the Fashion & Leather Goods category has proven the most resilient, reporting only a decline of 9 percent in Q1 2020 compared to the same period last year. Major brands like Dior and Louis Vuitton performed well, while others in the sector missed expectations, Bernard Arnault, the Chairman and CEO of LVMH, said in the earnings call. Watches & Jewelry and Selective Retailing, including cosmetics chain Sephora and travel retail leader DFS Group, reporting a 24 percent and a 25 percent decline, respectively, were hit the hardest as a result of store closures and travel restrictions due to the ongoing COVID-19 crisis.

As Asia-Pacific, excluding Japan, remains 29 percent of the group’s revenue and with China showing early signs of recovery, many analysts inquired about mainland China’s outlook during the call. “There is repatriation of part of the business in mainland China,” Arnault answered. “The growth rate in mainland China was higher than our business with mainlanders outside of China. It will amplify in the months to come.” The group also reported improving in-store traffic and sales in China as stores began to reopen in March.

As the devastating effects of the COVID-19 pandemic shifts from China to the rest of the world, the luxury industry has been anticipating various luxury players’ financial results to gauge the overall impact. LVMH, for the moment, seems to be doing better than most, at least compared with an overall estimation by RBC Europe, which recently predicted that luxury revenue might drop 20 to 30 percent this year. But how does the rest of 2020 look?

The impact ultimately depends on how long COVID-19 lasts, as Arnault said himself this January when the virus started to impact China: “If it dies out in two months and a half, it’s not terrible. If it takes two years, it will be a totally different matter.” Although the recovery of luxury buying is still uncertain, LVMH has given their guess. “We can only hope that the recovery happens gradually from May or June after a second quarter, in particular in Europe and the US.” Let’s wait and see.

This year's LVMH Prize will be split between the finalists - Harper's Bazaar UK,"Tue, 14 Apr 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhhcnBlcnNiYXphYXIuY29tL3VrL2Zhc2hpb24vZmFzaGlvbi1uZXdzL2EzMjE0MjYxMC9sdm1oLXByaXplLTIwMjAtY2FuY2VsbGVkL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The final of the annual LVMH Prize was set to take place on 5 June but, as with most upcoming events, has been cancelled due to the Covid-19 pandemic. In response to this, the conglomerate announced today that the prize will be split between all of the finalists, and a fund will be set up to help financially support young design talent.

The LVMH Prize For Young Fashion Designers is in its seventh cycle, and this year saw eight designers competing for the €300,000 prize, which will now instead be split equally between them, meaning that they will each receive €40,000.

The winners include American designer Peter Do (who was also featured in Net-a-Porter's The Vanguard series) and Japanese designer Tomo Koizumi, whose autumn/winter 2019 show in New York caused a splash with a star-studded catwalk that saw supermodel Bella Hadid and actress Gwendoline Christie walk.

The other winners include; Priya Ahluwalia of Ahluwalia, Charaf Tajer of Casablanca, Emma Chopova and Laura Lowena of Chopova Lowena, Nicholas Daley, Sindiso Khumalo and Supriya Lele.

"LVMH Cancels 2020 Prize Final, Launches Fund for Previous Winners - The Business of Fashion","Tue, 14 Apr 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzb2ZmYXNoaW9uLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy9sdXh1cnkvbHZtaC1jYW5jZWxzLTIwMjAtcHJpemUtZmluYWwtbGF1bmNoZXMtZnVuZC1mb3ItcHJldmlvdXMtd2lubmVycy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LONDON, United Kingdom — This year's LVMH Prize will have no winner. The final leg of the young designer competition, slated to take place at the Fondation Louis Vuitton in Paris on June 5, has been cancelled due to the coronavirus pandemic. Instead, finalists Ahluwalia, Casablanca, Chopova Lowena, Nicholas Daley, Peter Do, Sindiso Khumalo, Supriya Lele and Tomo Koizumi will share the €300,000 (approximately $328,000) prize money equally.

LVMH has also pledged to support previous winners of the prize with a new fund. Eligible brands, including Thebe Magugu, Doublet, Marine Serre, Wales Bonner, Marques Almeida, Thomas Tait and Miuniku will be able to apply for grants. The size of the fund was undisclosed.

The six previous winners of the LVMH Karl Lagerfeld Prize — a cohort including Hood by Air, Jacquemus and Kozaburo — will also be eligible for support.

The initiatives may prove a vital lifeline as store closures, crashing consumer demand and supply chain disruptions leave a growing number of independent fashion labels facing existential challenges.

""In this challenging context, this Fund in aid of young fashion designers highlights the main mission of the LVMH Prize by supporting our former winners.""

Finalist Peter Do told BoF that the money will allow him to retain his team. ""I think the decision to share the final award money is the right thing to do — it’s good for everyone and sends the right message and support to independent designers,"" Do wrote in an email. ""The prize means ...we can make sure that every member who has helped build the brand with blood, sweat and tears is supported at this time.""

Italy's Camera Nazionale della Moda Italiana, the British Fashion Council and the Council of Fashion Designers of America have also launched programs to bolster emerging labels, which often operate season-to-season with limited cash runways and now face an avalanche of cancelled orders.

The LVMH Prize final is just the latest in a slew of global fashion events to be affected as lockdown measures keep executives, creatives and workers in countries like the US, UK, Italy and France at home.

Fashion Week events in Japan, South Korea, Turkey, South Africa, Brazil and Russia have been cancelled or digitised. The upcoming men's runways in London, Milan and Paris, and July's haute couture shows have also been cut. It seems likely that fashion shows may be cancelled for the rest of the year.

Disclosure: LVMH is part of a group of investors who, together, hold a minority interest in The Business of Fashion. All investors have signed shareholders’ documentation guaranteeing BoF’s complete editorial independence.

LVMH Sees Sharp Rebound in China After 15% Q1 Sales Drop - WWD,"Thu, 16 Apr 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vd3dkLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy1uZXdzL2ZpbmFuY2lhbC9sdm1oLXNhbGVzLWRyb3AtMTUtcGVyY2VudC1pbi1maXJzdC1xdWFydGVyLWR1ZS10by1jb3JvbmF2aXJ1cy1pbXBhY3QtMTIwMzU2MjM4Ny_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS — LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton said it has seen a sharp acceleration in sales in Mainland China in April as consumers flock back to stores after the coronavirus lockdown, and it hopes the rest of the world will begin to recover from May or June.

Jean-Jacques Guiony, chief financial officer of LVMH, said its biggest brands — Louis Vuitton, Dior and Sephora — began to see a “significant” improvement with the progressive reopening of stores in Mainland China from mid-March.

“The numbers became positive in the second half of March and have been gathering speed in April,” he said on a conference call after the group reported that revenues fell 15 percent in the first quarter after the COVID-19 pandemic forced the closure of many of its stores and factories worldwide.

“We’ve seen very substantial growth rates, sometimes in excess of 50 percent, so it really shows the appetite of Chinese people after two months of lockdown to come back to stores and come back to their previous patterns of consumption,” Guiony said.

Among the brands enjoying growth of more than 50 percent since its stores in Mainland China reopened is Louis Vuitton, which is estimated to account for a quarter of the group’s sales, a source at LVMH confirmed.

Nonetheless, the improvement in domestic spending has not been sufficient to offset the sharp drop in Chinese luxury spending overseas due to ongoing travel restrictions. The evolution of overall spending by Chinese nationals at home and abroad is “improving, but still negative,” Guiony said.

Group sales were down 17 percent in organic terms in the first three months of the year, broadly in line with a Bloomberg consensus estimate for a 17.8 percent drop. LVMH added that it was too early to evaluate the impact of store and factory closures on its annual sales and results.

“We can only hope that the recovery happens gradually from May or June after a second quarter which will still be very affected by the crisis, in particular in Europe and the U.S.,” the world’s biggest luxury group said in a statement.

Organic sales in the first quarter were down 32 percent in Asia, excluding Japan. They fell 10 percent in Japan and Europe, and 8 percent in the U.S., reflecting the spread of the COVID-19 epidemic across the globe during the period.

Guiony said he was confident in the strength of underlying demand. “There are a lot of people saying that things will never be the same again. I heard that a few times already. I don’t believe, frankly, in that,” he said.

“The most likely scenario is that the crisis will be over from an epidemic viewpoint in some months, if not weeks, so we are not talking about something that’s supposed to have a lasting impact on the business,” he added.

Nonetheless, LVMH will be making some major adjustments. It will trim its planned dividend by 20 percent to 4.80 euros a share.

Bernard Arnault, chairman and chief executive officer of LVMH, and each of the other executive board members have decided to forgo their salaries for the months of April and May, in addition to their variable compensation for 2020. As ceo of Christian Dior Group, Sidney Toledano will do likewise.

Guiony said LVMH will slash its capital expenditures budget by 40 percent this year, with most of the spending postponed until 2021. “We are doing whatever we can do and we have to do in order to offset the current situation,” he said.

The group has also been cutting operating costs such as rents. While landlords in Mainland China have agreed to bear a portion of the cost of compulsory store closures, in Europe and the U.S., the situation is more mixed, with a minority of landlords being “quite inflexible,” Guiony said.

“This is a bit disappointing and obviously will have long-lasting consequences in the way we deploy our capital in the future,” he remarked.

LVMH’s revenues totaled 10.6 billion euros in the three months ended March 31. The key fashion and leather goods segment posted sales of 4.64 billion euros, down 10 percent in like-for-like terms, versus a consensus forecast of a 15.8 percent decline.

While Vuitton’s performance was in line with the division as a whole, Dior performed better, while the other brands did worse, Guiony said. He noted the impact on sales was “reasonably homogenous” across product categories, and online sales saw rapid growth.

“When we were strong already, as it is the case with Vuitton or with Sephora, the strength in online plays and we are getting very substantial increases in the online business across the board, not only in China. It’s true in Europe, it’s true in the U.S., it’s true in Japan,” he said.

“It offsets a sizable portion — I will not quantify it — of the drop that we are witnessing recently in the brick-and-mortar business due to the closures,” Guiony added.

He expects spring-summer collections to remain on shelves a little longer, with the aim of drawing down inventories. “We’ll make available the fall collection a little bit later, and progressively we will get back to the normal rhythm of collections, which is a bit of a paradox, because we sell spring products in the winter and fall products in the summer,” he said.

LVMH is confident that production of pre-fall and fall collections will resume fairly quickly. Louis Vuitton has reopened the majority of its 16 production sites in France to make face masks, and hopes to get leather goods production up and running again as soon as stores reopen.

“As far as Italian manufacturers are concerned, they have proven in the past a very high degree of flexibility, so we have no particular worry there,” Guiony said. “When the conditions are favorable, they will resume production and they should be able to produce whatever we need for the second part of the year.”

Sales of perfume and cosmetics were down 19 percent in organic terms, while selective retailing — which includes Sephora and DFS, LVMH’s travel-retail business — tumbled 26 percent. Guiony reckoned it was too early to say if DFS will be loss-making for the full year, but said the retailer expects to cut costs by more than 25 percent.

The watches and jewelry division recorded a 26 percent drop in organic revenue, with Bulgari sharply hit by the closure of its stores in Asia. Meanwhile, organic sales of wines and spirits were down 14 percent.

Guiony said the luxury properties in LVMH’s Belmond division, which include the Hotel Cipriani in Venice and the Copacabana Palace in Rio de Janeiro, were unlikely to reopen in early April as planned and were looking to trim overheads, with some renovations postponed until next year.

But LVMH’s $16.2 billion acquisition of Tiffany & Co. — the largest deal in the history of the luxury sector — is still on track. “We will stick to the contract, full stop,” Guiony said.

Arnault praised the group’s employees for helping to produce masks and hand sanitizer, and procuring medical equipment. “Thanks to everyone’s commitment and the strength of its brands, the LVMH group maintains good resilience in the face of this worldwide challenge,” he said in a statement.

“For several weeks, our teams have once again demonstrated that excellence, creativity and responsiveness will allow us not only to overcome this crisis but, above all, to emerge even stronger when it fades,” he added.

LVMH unusually issued guidance last month, saying it expected overall first-quarter revenues to fall between 10 and 20 percent as a result of the widespread lockdowns to contain the spread of COVID-19.

The luxury giant had posted organic growth of 11 percent in the same period a year ago, and recorded an 8 percent rise in like-for-like sales in the fourth quarter of 2019.

The industry bellwether’s quarterly sales figures come before other luxury rivals Kering, due to publish figures on April 21, and Hermès on April 23. Compagnie Financière Richemont reports annual results on May 15.

The luxury market is expected to contract by 25 to 30 percent in the first quarter, according to Bain & Co., which also modeled three scenarios for the whole of 2020 — with the worst forecasting a drop of up to 35 percent in sales this year.

But with marquee brands like Louis Vuitton, a diversified portfolio and deep cash reserves, LVMH is expected to weather the storm better than most.

Exane BNP Paribas said in light of the International Monetary Fund’s forecast of a 3 percent contraction in the global economy, it now expects the luxury market to shrink by 20 percent in 2020, versus a forecast of 4 percent growth at the beginning of the year.

“LVMH has a significant scale advantage in an industry where fixed costs prevail, and it is the most diversified of all luxury companies,” analysts Melania Grippo and Guido Lucarelli said in a report this week.

“LVMH is strong in accessible product categories — Champagne, fragrances and cosmetics — where barriers to entry are high, making it one of the best positioned to tap into global middle class development,” they added.

Amid heightened uncertainty, recession-hit consumers are expected to seek refuge in heritage brands.

“Stronger brands that enjoy ‘must-have’ status in consumers’ minds will stand tall,” Luca Solca, analyst at Bernstein, said in a report titled “Global Luxury Goods — COVID-19: What comes next?” published on Thursday.

“The good news is that investors agree that the long-term prospects for the luxury sector remain strong, and that the current predicament — as serious as it is — will be temporary,” he added.

While the event usually takes place before a noteworthy judging panel who cherry-pick a winner and a semi-finalist, this year there will be no single winner and the €300,000 prize will be split equally between the eight finalists.

As announced in February, this year’s finalists are: Priya Ahluwalia of Ahluwalia, Tomotaka Koizumi of Tomo Koizumi, Supriya Lele, Nicholas Daley, Peter Do, Emma Chopova and Laura Lowena of Chopova Lowena, Sindiso Khumalo and Charaf Tajer of Casablanca. Each designer was set to be judged by an expert panel that included Rihanna, Virgil Abloh, Jonathan Anderson and Marc Jacobs.

Since 2014, the Prize has supported emerging design talents from across the globe – including the likes of Grace Wales Bonner, Marine Serre, Marques’Almeida and Jacquemus – for a 12-month period. This new initiative aims to support the next gen of design talent during these uncertain times in which they will inevitably be feeling the financial burden of the coronavirus pandemic.

In addition to this, the LVMH group is setting up a new Fund supplemented by the Karl Lagerfeld Prize (€150,000) to provide financial support to its previous winners and runners-up. This comes a week after the Business of Fashion published a particularly bleak report that estimated that the luxury goods industry could take a global revenue hit ​“of 30 to 39 percent in 2020 year-on-year”.

Delphine Arnault, director and executive vice president of LVMH, addressed the effect of Covid-19 on young designers and LVMH’s role in supporting them: ​“Since its launch, the LVMH Prize has promoted and nurtured young talent […] In this challenging context, this Fund in aid of young fashion designers highlights the main mission of the LVMH Prize by supporting our former winners.”

While this area is replete with high-end hotels, including the iconic Beverly Hills Hotel and the Beverly Wilshire, the Cheval Blanc is vying to be even more exclusive.

The hotel will feature oversized suites, two swimming pools—one of which is a private penthouse pool—plus a private club. Rather than focusing on banquets or conference facilities, LVMH will capitalize on its nearby network of high-end restaurants, spas and retailers to sate guests. Indeed the Louis Vuitton and Dior boutiques just a stone’s throw away on—where else—Rodeo Drive.

“LVMH has a long and successful presence on Rodeo Drive and we look forward to expanding our role in the city with this exceptional new destination,” chairman and CEO of LVMH, Bernard Arnault, said in a press release.

The hotel will be designed by star architect Peter Marino, who has previously collaborated with LVMH on projects like the new Louis Vuitton Maisons in London and Seoul. The New York-based designer says the building will have a breathtaking façade of imported French limestone, multi-level landscaping. It will also boast a warm color palette that’s unequivocally SoCal.

“Our approach started with the location and context of Beverly Hills, resulting in an innovative, modern, Southern California design,” Marino said. “Working with artists is an essential aspect of my work, and site-specific artworks are being commissioned for the new hotel, both inside and out.”

WATCH

Of course, a stay at the Cheval Blanc will not come cheap. LVMH is catering specifically to a high-end clientele who will no doubt want a plush place to rest their heads after spending up big on Rodeo Drive.

“Peter Marino has designed a magnificent hotel that will offer unrivaled hospitality, as well as dining and retail locations, and enhance Rodeo Drive’s reputation as an unparalleled luxury destination,” Arnault added.

Unfortunately, jetsetters have a little while to wait before they can make a reservation at the new property. LVMH considers the Cheval Blanc a long-term venture and the hotel isn’t expected to open until 2025. Cheval Blanc hotels in Paris and London are also on the horizon.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999476671218872}",neutral,0.9999476671218872,0
LVMH Group Luxury Watch Brands Leave Baselworld: Century Old Trade Show Now Loses All Anchor Exhibitors - aBlogtoWatch,"Fri, 17 Apr 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFibG9ndG93YXRjaC5jb20vbHZtaC1ncm91cC1sdXh1cnktd2F0Y2gtYnJhbmRzLWxlYXZlLWJhc2Vsd29ybGQv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Earlier today Paris-based LVMH Group announced that the several watch brands in its watches division (Hublot, TAG Heuer, and Zenith), and Bulgari (which also produces a number of luxury watches) are following the lead of a number of other major timepiece makers and severing ties with Baselworld. This news comes just days after — and is directly related to — the announcement that Rolex, Tudor, Patek Philippe, Chopard, and Chanel were leaving Baselworld.

While not all of LVMH’s watch making brands have displayed at Baselworld for a while, its most important global luxury timepiece makers were key attractions for guests at the long-standing wrist watch trade show event held in the city of Basel which is about 1.25 hours by train away from Zürich. Problems between watch brand exhibitors and the Baselworld organization have been brewing for a while, and in 2020 the show itself was forced to close due to the COVID-19 pandemic crisis.

Advertising Message

Facing huge economic losses, and without much precedent as to how to handle the situation, MCH (the company which operates Baselworld) apparently chose not to fully refund exhibitor fees but rather explained to its many exhibitors that Baselworld 2020 would be rescheduled….. to January 2021. This would ostensibly let Baselworld hold on to fees already collected, and simply apply them to a replacement show. Unfortunately for Baselworld, few exhibitors agreed that a January 2021 show was the same thing as an April 2020 show — with many feeling that Baselworld was operating with poor sportsmanship.

The precise nature of the disagreements between Baselworld and the watch brands which collectively make up its exhibitors and thus clients are somewhat unclear — but appear to be mostly related to money. The consensus seems to be that for the cost and inconvenience of attending Baselworld, the return on investment for being there does not add up for many people who in modern times have plenty of alternative ways to meet and do business. Baselworld has been asked for years to reduce their prices and add appeal for distinguished guests and exhibitors to travel to Basel. While efforts were indeed made, it was all apparently too little, too late.

The first major blow to Baselworld in modern times was two years ago when the entire Swatch Group portfolio of watch brands pulled support from Baselworld and decided to meet retailers at their offices in Zürich. From there brand after brand seemed to follow with the once invincible Baselworld becoming increasingly like Swiss cheese. With that said, watch brands and Baselworld experienced their first major fissure when the Richemont Group, and some colleague brands split off to form the alternative luxury watch trade show known as SIHH in Geneva. In recent months, SIHH has been renamed Watches & Wonders Geneva, and in general had been slowly pulling brands away from Baselworld for years.

Advertising Message

Rolex, Tudor, Patek Philippe, Chopard, and Chanel, are now joining the Geneva crew and will participate in a brand new watch trade show event (that does not have a name yet) held adjacent to Watches & Wonders Geneva and that will be organized by the same partner organization — the FHH. LVMH makes it clear they will also display in Geneva, yet where and how is not clear yet. Its brands aren’t for want of options or locales either. In January 2020 aBlogtoWatch joined LVMH watch brands in Dubai at the Group’s own show where they debuted watches, and make it a point to remark on how their event was far less expensive than the cost of attending Baselworld. LVMH was openly taunting Baselworld that it had better options out there, and that its business was going to require some work to preserve.

Rolex and Patek Philippe were the two colleague watch brands whose booths were in the vicinity as those of the LVMH brands, and whose retailers LVMH brands wanted to meet. In essence, the people who came to Baselworld to purchase Rolex and Patek Philippe timepieces for their stores, were the types of buyers Hublot, TAG Heuer, Bulgari, and Zenith wanted to meet — and so they did. LVMH likely fears that even though Baselworld has plenty of other potential brands for buyers to meet, the cream of the crop will not attend the now out-of-the-way watch event in the city of Basel.

LVMH actually makes a very luxury house argument — the logic of which is hard for shareholders to complain against. LVMH in essence says to Baselworld, “we are Louis Vuitton and many of the world’s most well-known names in luxury.” We have to respect our image, because image is our product. Attending Baselworld isn’t a good look for us right now. It’s been fun Baselworld, but right now working with you isn’t helping our image. LVMH says, “[our brands] must also withdraw [from Baselworld] in order to preserve their image and their relations with their clients as well as with the media.” It is hard not to feel bad for Baselworld. As the dominoes of departing brands has kept on falling since last year, the mummers of its demise became a self fulfilling prophecy that convinced enough important people the show should experience demise.

One of the major questions on everyone’s mind is what will happen with the dozens of smaller watch brands that also relied upon Baselworld to reach customers and media. If Baselworld has now lost of all of its anchor brands then it is highly likely operating the show as is will not be economically viable given the overhead of the show at its recent size. It isn’t clear if Baselworld will accept doing a much smaller show just for the smaller brands who still wish to participate. Even with just those brands, Baselworld could be quite sizeable. Having said that, Baselworld will likely never be able to recover the historic earnings it made through exhibitor fees. These days the value of being at the show is simply less for brands, despite how much it costs Baselworld to put on the show. One option might be for Baselworld to be rolled into Art Basel, closer to the summer each year. The famed art show could carve out space for luxury watches since both events attract a high-end clientèle. Though it isn’t clear if the maligned and under-sized hotel industry in Basel could accommodate additional visitors during the busy art event.

Another option is for Baselworld to move to Zürich. There it could counter Swatch Group’s move and do a show at the same time that the Swatch Group invites retailers into town to view its latest products. That way Baselworld can ensure its exhibitors that not only is Zürich a more travel-friendly city than Basel, but that there will be more of the types of buyers already in town they want to meet.

LVMH and luxury watch brands in general have all come to a similar conclusion, and that is they cannot both attend a major trade show event like Baselworld and also have to travel around the world doing a bunch of smaller local events. Stopping them from participating in both Baselworld and travel are practical considerations such as human resources of man power, and available budgets.

Not being able to attend a watch trade show event like Baselworld will have mixed implications for the watch industry — but in all likelihood, most of the former Baselworld exhibitors will find new shows to display at within a few years from now. It might also be a boom for watch media and marketing, the budgets of which might easily get larger due to serious need, as well as budget availability from unused Baselworld francs. It will nevertheless be a few years from now until some new level of normalcy takes shape when it comes to established places where watch brands can show their new products off to buyers, clients, media, and most importantly… each other.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.7872997522354126}",neutral,0.7872997522354126,0

It has launched a limited-edition mixed case of wine featuring bottles from the group’s most esteemed wine estates which it plans to sell for £2,000 (€2,300 / US$ 2,500) to raise money to support the restaurant trade which has been badly hit by the Coronavirus pandemic and resulting lockdowns.

300 numbered six-bottle cases will be produced – each bearing the message ‘Together with the hospitality industry’ – to raise £600,000 for three charities set up to support the hospitality trade. They are Hospitality Action (UK), La Fondation de France and Restaurant Employee Relief Fund (USA).

Each case will include the following wines, representing some of the most acclaimed vintages from each property over the last decade:

Château Cheval Blanc 2009

Château Cheval Blanc 2015

Clos des Lambrays 2016

Y d’Yquem 2017

Château d’Yquem 2015

Château d’Yquem 2009

The cases will be available from leading merchants across the globe with all proceeds going the three charities mentioned above.

This is the latest in a series of activities from LVMH in reaction of the Coronavirus pandemic. Last month its perfume factories began producing sanitising gel for French hospitals, and 12 Louis Vuitton workshops have switched production to sew protective masks.

Bordeaux wines say ‘Thank You’

A charitable auction has been set up by wine growers, producers, merchants and brokers in Bordeaux to express their gratitude to health workers at the front like of the Coronavirus response.

An online auction, coordinated by the C.I.V.B., will be held on the dates initially planned for the ‘Bordeaux fête le vin’, 18th-21st June and will feature lots donated by wine professionals from across the region.

‘The women and men of the Bordeaux wine trade, châteaux and merchants along with wine tourism professionals, are rallying together to offer lots (bottles or cases of wine, nights at the château, activities or visits to the property, courses at the Bordeaux Wine School). All these donations will form a catalogue of lots put up for auction,’ says the auction website.

At the beginning of July all of the money raised from the auction will be given to the Bordeaux University Hospital to buy equipment and improve the working conditions of healthcare staff at Gironde hospitals affected by Covid-19.

All donations and the auctions will take place on the website www.lesvinsdebordeauxleurdisentmerci.com.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999977350234985}",neutral,0.9999977350234985,0

The French multinational corporation Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton (LVMH) which specialises in luxury goods, has also announced its decision to pull all of its watch brands out of Baselworld 2020, putting the watch show’s success in jeopardy.

Numerous watch brands withdrawing from Baselworld threatens the watch show’s success

This is not the first time that a large group of participants has withdrawn from Baselworld. In 2018, Swatch Group announced that all of its brands would leave Baselworld, including Swatch, Bruget, Blancpain and Omega.

Last year, Breitling, as well as two major Japanese watch brands Seiko and Casio, also quit due to issues with the exhibition dates. Recently, Rolex and Patek Philippe, along with other giants in the watch industry, also decided to leave the show. After losing LVMH's labels Bvlgari, Hublot, TAG Heuer and Zenith, Baselworld is left with only a few exhibitors.

(Editor’s note: The luxury corporation Richemont holds the watch exhibition ‘Watches & Wonders’ with Fondation de la Haute Horlogerie [FHH] in Geneva. Watches & Wonders takes place concurrently with Baselworld. Therefore, Richemont’s brands A. Lange & Söhne, Panerai, IWC and Vacheron Constantin usually appear at the show in Geneva.)

LVMH held their Watch Week in Dubai in January 2020

LVMH’s decision to bid farewell to Baselworld comes as less of a shock when compared to brands like Rolex and Patek Philippe. In fact, there were signs which suggest LVMH’s change of plans. In January this year, the corporation held its Watch Week in Dubai to facilitate the launch of new watches by its labels and the event was well-received.

The coronavirus pandemic has put the watch exhibitions to a halt. However, it is said that LVMH’s brand Bvlgari has already received a large number of orders for their Serpenti Seduttori Tourbillon which launched at the show. The waiting time is expected to be at least two years.

Chief executive officer of the LVMH watchmaking division, Stéphane Bianchi, comments on their decision to leave Baselworld. ‘We are sorry to have to leave this over 100-year-old Baselworld event to which our Maisons have been consistently loyal,’ says Bianchi. ‘We will do our utmost to be present alongside the other prestigious Maisons that will gather in Geneva in April 2021.’

Bvlgari’s CEO Jean-Christoph Babin states in a press release that ‘grouping the entire Swiss watch industry in a single location, Geneva — the historical capital of watchmaking — and around a single date, is a major opportunity to at last revive a sector that all too many divisions and divergent interests have weakened, compared to the rest of the luxury sector in which Bulgari is active and that is making much faster progress.’

Bvlgari’s CEO Jean-Christoph Babin

The five watch industry giants, including Rolex, will cooperate with FHH in holding a new watch show in Geneva next April, in parallel with Watches & Wonders. It is also believed that the watch labels have come to an agreement on putting their new watch launches on hold until next April.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.8959171175956726}",neutral,0.8959171175956726,0

In a move of solidarity against the backdrop of coronavirus, the initiative hopes to relieve some of the financial burdens that many young designers are facing in the current climate. “The health crisis poses an economic threat to young talent,” the organisation said in an Instagram post.

With the competition originally slated to take place in June, a star-studded line up of judges, including Rihanna, were set to pick this year’s winner. With the finalists announced in February, Priya Ahluwalia of Ahluwalia, Supriya Lele, Tomotaka Koizumi of Tomo Koizumi, Charaf Tajer of Casablanca, Emma Chopova and Laura Lowena of Chopova Lowena, Nicholas Daley, Peter Do, and Sindiso Khumalo, will now instead receive a sum of €40,000 each.

Alongside this, LVMH is also set to establish a Fund to support other designers during this time. Repurposing its Karl Lagerfeld Prize, which typically comes in a cash endowment of €150,000, this time money will go towards helping previous winners of both the main award and its runners-up, giving the likes of Serre and Wales Bonner the ability to request aid.

“Since its launch, the LVMH Prize has promoted and nurtured young talent,” Delphine Arnault, the Executive Vice President of Louis Vuitton and founder of the Prize, said in a statement. “Each year, it places the spotlight on young designers from all over the world and supports the development of their companies. In this challenging context, this Fund in aid of young fashion designers highlights the main mission of the LVMH Prize by supporting our former winners.”

The novel coronavirus is a global pandemic that has altered the way we live. Federal and local authorities have urged—and in some cases, mandated—their citizens to self-quarantine, leading to closures of schools, businesses, and public facilities. More pressing, hospitals are filling to capacity and draining the essential equipment they need to treat patients—particularly, surgical gloves and N95 face masks.

In the United States alone, the BBC reports more than 35,175 cases of coronavirus, a statistic expected to swell in the coming weeks. The outlet marks China at 81,496; Italy, Europe’s worst-hit country, is listed with 59,138, Spain with 33,089, and Germany with 26,220. As of today, there are more than 340,000 confirmed cases worldwide, prompting many government officials to call for aid. They are asking organizations not only to be vigilant, but to help out as best they can.

Many fashion and beauty companies, the majority of which have ceased production altogether, have heeded the call, stepping up to taper down the adverse effects caused by COVID-19. Some are global firms with a breadth of resources, while others are small, independent companies. But all, in their own ways, are committed to stopping the spread of the disease, providing assistance to those who need it during this trying time, or a combination of both. See below the brands that are playing their parts.

Gucci

The Italian label is providing 1,100,000 surgical masks and 55,000 medical overalls. It also plans on donating to crowdfunding campaigns that are supporting relief efforts, including the Italian Civil Protection Department and the World Health Organizations's COVID-19 Solidarity Response Fund. In addition, through #GucciCommunity, it is asking fans to make a donation to the WHO's initiative, along with giving the agency complete access to its social media channels in the hopes of amplifying official public service information.

Ralph Lauren

The American lifestyle brand has pledged $10 million to coronavirus relief efforts, the biggest donation by a luxury company thus far. The grant will go to the WHO's COVID-19 Solidarity Response Fund, the Emergency Assistance Foundation, and its Pink Pony Fund, which supports a network of international cancer institutions. It is also starting production on 250,000 face masks and 25,000 isolation gowns for health care workers. Additionally, the firm gifted an undisclosed amount to the CFDA/Vogue Fashion Fund to help fashion designers hit by the economic downturn. ""We believe that no matter who you are or where you are from, we are all connected,"" said Ralph Lauren . ""That is why we are taking significant action to help our teams and communities through this crisis.""

MAC Cosmetics

Through its enduring Viva Glam campaign, of which Miley Cyrus was an ambassador, the beauty behemoth will distribute $10 million to 250 local organizations across the globe supporting COVID-19 relief efforts. ""The Viva Glam efforts are only made possible by the continuous support of the MAC community and those who purchase a Viva Glam lipstick, of which 100 percent of the proceeds goes towards these local organizations,"" Cyrus said in a statement provided by the company. ""To get involved, you can purchase any current shade of the current lipstick or send a virtual kiss to those on the front line via Twitter or Instagram with [the] hashtag #vivaglam.""

Tory Burch

The American fashion brand has partnered with 1199SEIU United Healthcare Workers East to provide $5 million worth of products—which includes scrubs, belts, and sneakers—to health care professionals.

Kering

Many of the brands under the luxury company have pledged aid. The workshops of Gucci (see above), Saint Laurent, and Balenciaga will be producing face masks as soon as they get approval from health authorities. The corporation has also donated $1 million to CDC Foundation and its efforts to provide vital supplies and equipment to healthcare workers in the United States.

LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton recorded revenue of €10.6 billion for the first quarter of 2020, down -15% compared to the same period in 2019 and down 17% on an organic basis.

In the Selective Retailing division, organic revenue was down -26% in Q1. LVMH said: “DFS experienced a significant decline in activity in most destinations as a result of the suspension of international travel.”

In addition, all Sephora stores were closed in China for most of the quarter, while those located in Europe and the US have been closed since mid-March. Online revenue significantly increased over this period though, said the group.

In Wines & Spirits, a positive currency effect and a price increase policy partially offset the decline in volumes. Revenue was down -14% on an organic basis in Q1. The US market demonstrated resilience over the period, supported by advance orders from distributors. Hennessy Cognac slowed down in China given lower demand linked to the epidemic and to the timing of 2020 Chinese New Year.

The Fashion & Leather Goods business group recorded a decline in organic revenue of -10% in the quarter, with store closures around the world. Online sales saw rapid growth, noted the group.

In Perfumes & Cosmetics, organic revenue decreased -19% in the first quarter of 2020. LVMH said: “The major brands demonstrated their resilience as retailers reduced their inventory levels given the current crisis. Online sales grew rapidly.”

The Watches & Jewelry business group recorded a -26% drop in organic revenue in the quarter. Bvlgari experienced a decline in its activity due to the closure of its stores, in Asia in particular. TAG Heuer and Hublot were affected by the reduction of orders by retailers.

LVMH Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Bernard Arnault said: “In this unprecedented context, I would first like to thank our teams around the world, who have mobilised to help caregivers and participate in the collective effort by making hydroalcoholic gel for hand sanitisers, by facilitating the movement or by producing medical masks or even by sourcing critical equipment for hospitals. The health and safety of our employees and customers must remain our top priority. On a global scale, the group works closely with the teams of each of our Maisons to provide them with all the resources they need.”

The company acknowledged the closures of manufacturing sites and stores in most countries in the first half will have an impact on annual revenue and results.

“This impact cannot be precisely evaluated at this stage without knowing the timetable for a return to normal business in the different areas where the group operates. We can only hope that the recovery happens gradually from May or June after a second quarter which will still be very affected by the crisis, in particular in Europe and the US.”

The LVMH Board decided this week to propose a -30% reduction in the 2019 dividend, to €4.80. Bernard Arnault, along with other Executive Board members will give up their remuneration for the months of April and May as well as all other variable remuneration relating to 2020.","{'label': 'Negative', 'score': 0.9983373880386353}",negative,0.9983373880386353,-1
"As Chanel, Hermès Vow to Keep Up Employees' Salaries on Their Own, LVMH, Kering Reconsider Plans to Seek ... - The Fashion Law","Tue, 07 Apr 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikgFodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGVmYXNoaW9ubGF3LmNvbS9hcy1jaGFuZWwtaGVybWVzLXZvdy10by1rZWVwLXVwLWVtcGxveWVlcy1zYWxhcmllcy1vbi10aGVpci1vd24tbHZtaC1rZXJpbmctcmVjb25zaWRlci1wbGFucy10by1zZWVrLWdvdmVybm1lbnQtYWlkL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"France, which is home to some of the most esteemed and valuable names in fashion, has rolled out a number of initiatives aimed at safeguarding the health of native companies and protecting its citizens from sweeping unemployment in light of the rising impact of the COVID-19 virus. One such effort? A $50.16 billion “expanded partial-unemployment package in which the [French government will] pay the salaries of employees who are needed during the crisis” in order to avoid layoffs, according to the Wall Street Journal.

In other words, the $50 billion plan enables companies to reduce employees’ hours or to furlough them (i.e., temporarily cut their hours (in part or entirely) while technically still keeping them in their positions as employees), while leaning on the government to pay at least a portion of their salaries. According to a report from the Financial Times on Monday, it appeared – at least initially – that some of the country’s biggest fashion groups wanted in.

“Internal emails and documents reviewed by the Financial Times show that soon after France entered lockdown on March 15, LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton” – a publicly-traded luxury goods giants with a $173.32 market cap and annual revenues of $59.1 billion in 2019 – “had started to put some workers on the government’s so-called ‘partial activity’ scheme across its various businesses,” the publication reported. “Workers at Louis Vuitton, and beauty retailer Sephora were among those told in March they would be put on the government program — only to have the decision reversed last week” by the Bernard Arnault-chaired LVMH.

“Similar events took place at Kering,” the Paris-based parent company of Gucci, Yves Saint Laurent, Balenciaga, and Bottega Veneta, among other brands, according to the FT.

Why the change of heart by the luxury leaders? It seems to have something to do with the fact that the two giants “smaller rivals Hermès and Chanel” subsequently announced that they would “cope without state support in a spirit of ‘national solidarity.’” Both Chanel and Hermès recently revealed that they would not rely on France’s government assistance plan to keep their employees’ salaries in check. Chanel announced last week that it would not be putting any of its 8,500 employees in France into temporary unemployment.

“Our aim is not to weigh on the public accounts so the French state can prioritize help to the most vulnerable companies, and focus its resources on the health system and its doctors and nurses,” Chanel said in a statement.

Around the same time, Hermès vowed to maintain the basic salary for its 15,500 employees worldwide without the aid of government funding. The 183-year old brand also stated that it would keep dividends at the same level as last year, while its executive chairmen “wished to waive increases in their fixed remuneration paid in 2020 and in their variable remuneration allocated in 2020 … and will therefore, receive in 2020 a total amount of remuneration identical to that received in 2019. ”

More than merely wanting to avoid the harsh criticism that would likely come with industry giants tapping into “programs [that] are supposed to help fragile companies and workers who really need it,” the FT asserts that the question of whether or not to accept financial aid from the government “has turned into a fraught question for some of France’s biggest companies because asking for help risks turning once internal matters, such as executive pay or dividends, into matters of public debate.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999333620071411}",neutral,0.9999333620071411,0

Why the Clare Waight Keller-Givenchy Partnership Was Short-Lived - The Business of Fashion,"Fri, 10 Apr 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzb2ZmYXNoaW9uLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy9sdXh1cnkvY2xhcmUtd2FpZ2h0LWtlbGxlci1leGl0cy1naXZlbmNoeS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS, France — Givenchy Artistic Director Clare Waight Keller is leaving the LVMH-owned label after three years in the role. She acknowledged the exit in an Instagram post on April 10. The Autumn/Winter 2020 womenswear collection presented in March in Paris will be her last for the house.

A statement from Givenchy said a successor would be announced at a later date. The appointment may take longer than expected due to the coronavirus pandemic, which has closed down stores and luxury operations across Europe and the United States.

Waight Keller joined Givenchy from Chloé, where she helped grow the business to around €400 million in annual sales on the back of a strong accessories and fragrance programme.

At Givenchy, where she succeeded Riccardo Tisci in 2017, she surprised the fashion community with strong haute couture collections unexpected from a more commercially-minded designer.

ADVERTISEMENT

LVMH had big expectations for Givenchy under Waight Keller and Chief Executive Philippe Fortunato, an LVMH veteran. In 2018, the executive told BoF he planned to grow the brand to reach the scale of Dior's fashion business, with revenue exceeding €2 billion. Opening new stores and expanding e-commerce were key priorities At that point, the house was estimated to generate just over €400 million per year. (LVMH does not break out the revenue for its smaller houses, including Givenchy.)

Waight Keller responded by breaking strongly with the aesthetic of her predecessor, Tisci, and, diving into the house’s archives, looked more closely at the history of Givenchy under Hubert de Givenchy himself. Such creative resets, when they work, can be game-changing for luxury brands.

In the case of Waight Keller, strong couture collections, while powerful image-drivers, were simply not enough to propel sales growth. Under Tisci, Givenchy's men's business was crucial to its success, and this part of the brand remained robust under Waight Keller’s watch, according to retail market sources. The women's ready-to-wear and accessories, however, never took off.

For months, the industry has speculated about Waight Keller's departure, which seemed all the more likely after Fortunato exited the business in February. He was replaced by Renaud de Lesquen, whom LVMH brought over from Dior Americas where he was chief executive and president.

As for who will replace Waight Keller, LVMH may look to its other houses for a blueprint, perhaps even splitting up the men's and women's creative director roles. Matthew Williams, the founder of 1017 ALYX 9SM and a comrade of LVMH menswear designer Virgil Abloh and Kanye West, is a name that keeps surfacing.

""As the first woman to be the Artistic Director of this legendary Maison, I feel honoured to have been given the opportunity to cherish its legacy and bring it new life,"" wrote Waight Keller on Instagram. ""I am now looking forward to embarking on the next episode.""

Disclosure: LVMH is part of a group of investors who, together, hold a minority interest in The Business of Fashion. All investors have signed shareholders’ documentation guaranteeing BoF’s complete editorial independence.

The Selective Retailing division – which includes luxury travel retailer, DFS Group and world-renowned chain of personal care and beauty stores, Sephora – posted a dramatic 26% decline in organic revenue during the same period.

Unsurprisingly, “DFS experienced a significant decline in activity in most destinations as a result of the suspension of international travel,” said the group.

While all the Sephora stores were closed in China for a prolonged period in Q1, those located in Europe and the United States have been closed only since mid-March.

However, LVMH says that online revenue – in the selective retailing division – significantly increased over this period and that shopping in Chinese stores has gradually picked up since early April. LVMH also said that “online sales saw rapid growth,” in its fashion & leathergoods division.

‘PROVEN RESILIENCE’

LVMH said it has ‘proven its ability to be resilient in an economic environment disrupted by a serious health crisis’ that has led to the closure of stores and manufacturing sites in most countries in recent weeks, as well as the suspension of international travel.

The Group said its priority is to ensure the safety of its employees and customers and that the LVMH divisions have demonstrated ‘their strong commitment and agility’ in facing this unprecedented situation.

“Efforts to adapt to the current environment are actively underway in order to control costs and ensure a more selective investment policy,” said the company.

LVMH has also organised the business to support the collective efforts being undertaken to combat Covid-19. Numerous solidarity initiatives have been rolled out by the Group’s Maisons around the world to support health authorities and medical staff.

Bernard Arnault, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of LVMH, said: “In this unprecedented context, I would first like to thank our teams around the world, who have mobilised to help caregivers and participate in the collective effort by making hydroalcoholic gel for hand sanitisers, by facilitating the movement or by producing medical masks or even by sourcing critical equipment for hospitals.

HEALTH AND SAFTEY REMAINS ‘TOP PRIORITY’

“The health and safety of our employees and customers must remain our top priority. On a global scale, the Group works closely with the teams of each of our Maisons to provide them with all the resources they need.

“Thanks to everyone’s commitment and the strength of its brands, the LVMH group maintains good resilience in the face of this worldwide challenge.”

In Wines & Spirits, the positive currency effect and the firm price increase policy partially offset the decline in volumes, said the Group. However, revenue was still down 14% on an organic basis in the first quarter.

The US market demonstrated ‘good resilience’ over the period, supported by advance orders from distributors. Hennessy Cognac slowed down in China given lower demand linked to the epidemic and to the timing of 2020 Chinese New Year.

‘CREATIVE MOMENTUM’ FOR LOUIS VUITTON AND CHRISTIAN DIOR

The Fashion & Leather Goods business group recorded a decline in organic revenue of 10% in the first quarter of 2020 in a market environment ‘defined by store closures in several regions around the world’, LVMH highlighted.

Louis Vuitton and Christian Dior, in particular, continued to show creative momentum, as illustrated by the latest runway shows and continuous enhancements to their iconic products.

The other brands continued the efforts to strengthen their resilience. Manufacturing sites of the Group’s Maisons are preparing to reopen with maximum safety conditions for employees following the suspension of activity in mid-March.

In Perfumes & Cosmetics, organic revenue decreased 19% in the first quarter of 2020. The major brands demonstrated their resilience as retailers reduced their inventory levels given the current crisis. Online sales grew rapidly.

The Watches & Jewellery business group recorded a 26% drop in organic revenue in the first quarter of 2020. Bvlgari experienced a decline in its activity due to the closure of its stores, in Asia in particular.

HOPES OF A RECOVERY FROM MAY/JUNE

After a good start to the year, TAG Heuer and Hublot were affected by the reduction of orders by retailers. One of the major innovations of the quarter was the very successful launch of TAG Heuer’s new smart watch.

“In a very turbulent context, the Group will maintain a strategy focused on preserving the value of its brands, based on the exceptional quality of its products and the responsiveness of its teams,” it said in a statement.

“In the current situation, the Group will further strengthen its policy of controlling costs and being selective in its investments. The closures of the Group’s manufacturing sites and stores in most of the world’s countries in the first half will have an impact on the annual revenue and results.”

LVMH said that this impact cannot be precisely evaluated at this stage without knowing the timetable for a return to normal business in the different areas where the Group operates.

“We can only hope that the recovery happens gradually from May or June after a second quarter which will still be very affected by the crisis, in particular in Europe and the US,” it continued.

At a meeting on 15 April, 2020, the LVMH Board of Directors assessed the economic situation resulting from the Covid-19 pandemic and, in light of current events and governmental recommendations, decided to propose a 30% reduction in the dividend announced on 28 January for Shareholders’ approval at the AGM on June 30, 2020.

In addition, the Board was informed of the decision taken by Bernard Arnault, as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and by each of the other Executive Board members to give up their remuneration for the months of April and May 2020 as well as all the variable remuneration relating to 2020.

Finally, the Board members of the Company took the decision to reduce their attendance fees by 30% for 2020.","{'label': 'Negative', 'score': 0.9994933605194092}",negative,0.9994933605194092,-1
And now LVMH brands are going to simplify production to not stock - LaConceria | Il portale dell'area pelle - laconceria.it,"Thu, 30 Apr 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxhY29uY2VyaWEuaXQvZW4vbHV4dXJ5L2FuZC1ub3ctbHZtaC1icmFuZHMtYXJlLWdvaW5nLXRvLXNpbXBsaWZ5LXByb2R1Y3Rpb24tdG8tbm90LXN0b2NrL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Luxury Phase 2 is at a slow pace. LVMH brands are simplifying production, and it could not be any different. After a lockdown quarter, when shops were closed condemning a collection to remain practically unsold, the French conglomerate cannot afford to further accumulate goods in their warehouses. Toni Belloni, general manager of the group, explains this to L’Economia, supplement of Il Corriere della Sera.

LVMH brands simplify production

“We have decided to simplify the rhythm of the seasons in order to manage production effectively – are Belloni’s words – and to avoid the accumulation of inventories along the entire supply chain. Of course, all this without giving up on having fresh and desirable products for customers”. For LVMH, which boasts brands such as Louis Vuitton, Fendi and Dior in its wallet, the Coronavirus emergency has marked a season of difficulty: “Closings of the stores in various markets, for almost a quarter, have reduced the exposure of products launched at the beginning of the year”. The same goes for the supply chain: “While being careful to safety, it is necessary to reactivate the supply chain, to be ready for the progressive reopening of the markets”.

The supply chain, Italy

“In addition to the eight maisons, of which we are very proud, and legendary hotels – Belloni boasts -, we have almost 11,000 employees in Italy. A workforce that has doubled in the past five to six years, accompanied by hundreds of millions in investments”. For LVMH, roots in Italy are fundamental: “The luxury chains are a real competitive advantage for Italy. It is no coincidence that we have 30 production sites, from accessories to leather goods, from footwear to jewellery. Each is rooted within those unique ecosystems that are the Italian districts”. Precisely for this reason Belloni knows how important it is that brands share with their suppliers: “We have a privileged angle of observation, and we understand very well the problems of both suppliers and retailers – he concludes -. Attention is particularly important in Italy, where many players in our supply chains are small and medium-sized companies, often family-run”.

The only question remaining is what will happen to Basel's myriad smaller exhibitors who are unable to make the jump to a new city?

Confirming the decision, CEO of Bulgari Group, Jean-Christophe Babin, said, ""Grouping the entire Swiss watch industry in a single location, Geneva – the historical capital of watchmaking – and around a single date, is a major opportunity to at last revive a sector that all too many divisions and divergent interests have weakened compared to the rest of the luxury sector.""

Stéphane Bianchi, CEO of the LVMH Watchmaking Division, added, ""We are facing an opportunity to reinvent the format and content of one of the key moments of our watchmaking year... and thereby meet the requirements of our partners and clients while offering them an unrivalled experience.”

Known as Baselworld since 2003, the world’s biggest and most significant watch and jewellery fair has its roots in a trade exhibition that started in the city in 1917. But recent years have seen the mighty Baselworld – once home to over 600 exhibitors – struggling with dissatisfaction from participants and visitors alike due to high costs of stand space, poor facilities and the hiked-up prices of hotels and restaurants.

Gradually, big names have dropped out with Dior, Seiko and Breitling all leaving recently. In 2019, the Swatch Group removed all of its 18 brands in what was at the time deemed a protest against the poor management of the show.

Last month, the coronavirus crisis forced the postponement of the 2020 edition of Baselworld, with many participating brands unhappy with organiser MCH Group’s response to, and handling of, the situation.","{'label': 'Negative', 'score': 0.9920353293418884}",negative,0.9920353293418884,-1
Louis Vuitton owner LVMH blames sales decline on Covid-19 chaos - Retail Gazette,"Fri, 17 Apr 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldGFpbGdhemV0dGUuY28udWsvYmxvZy8yMDIwLzA0L2xvdWlzLXZ1aXR0b24tb3duZXItbHZtaC1ibGFtZXMtZGVjbGluaW5nLXNhbGVzLW9uLWNvdmlkLTE5LWNoYW9zL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"// LVMH posts 17% drop in first quarter sales due to the coronavirus pandemic

// The group had to shut stores in major parts of the world as part of a lockdown

Louis Vuitton owner LVMH has recorded a 17 per cent drop in comparable sales in the first quarter due to the coronavirus pandemic.

LVMH, which also owns the likes of Dior, Fendi and Givenchy, had to temporarily shut stores in major cities due to the ongoing pandemic.

The luxury retail group also halted production at major sites including in France, where it makes the bulk of its goods, though it has retooled some factories to produce face masks and hand gels.

LVMH had warned last month that first-quarter sales would drop by around 10 per cent and 20 per cent.

On Thursday, revenue stood at €10.6 billion (£9.08 billion) in the January to March period, down 15 per cent on a reported basis, marking a 17 per cent drop on a like-for-like basis.

Meanwhile, its first-quarter sales fell 10 per cent on a like-for-like basis compared with a year earlier.

The group said online sales had surged thanks to “rapid sales” and it hoped a broad recovery would start in May or June.

LVMH’s manufacturing sites are preparing to reopen with new safety conditions for employees, after they closed in mid-March.

The group has also proposed a 30 per cent reduction in the dividend to €4.80 (£4.11) per share.

“Thanks to everyone’s commitment and the strength of its brands, the LVMH group maintains good resilience in the face of this worldwide challenge,” chief executive Bernard Arnault said.

LVMH chief financial officer Jean Jacques Guiony said he did not expect the pandemic to have a lasting impact, adding that LVMH was keeping a lid on costs including by negotiating rent reductions.

Mark Denham: 'Don’t forget Europe has amazing businesses like LVMH’ - Portfolio Adviser,"Wed, 29 Apr 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vcG9ydGZvbGlvLWFkdmlzZXIuY29tL21hcmstZGVuaGFtLWV1cm9wZS1pcy1vdmVybG9va2VkLWRlc3BpdGUtYW1hemluZy1idXNpbmVzc2VzLWxpa2UtbHZtaC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Even before the effects of the coronavirus outbreak tore through global markets, the European economy was on shaky ground. But for Carmignac’s Mark Denham, being a bottom-up stockpicker means he can still source resilient companies across the continent.

Denham joined Carmignac three years ago after 12 years with Aviva Investors, and in that time he has been running the €269m (£235m) Carmignac Grande Europe Fund, a pan-European Sicav. For the past nine months he has also led the FP Carmignac European Leaders Fund, launched as an Oeic for the UK market in May last year.

The two funds follow more or less the same strategy except that European Leaders is ex UK and an Oeic structure. “FP Carmignac European Leaders has only been going for nine months, so we have to use the experience, track record and what we’ve done on Grande Europe as our reference point,” says Denham.

Keeping screen time to a minimum as markets reel from Covid-19

As a stockpicker, Denham is not fond of addressing macro issues in interviews but he accepts Covid-19 has been so invasive in financial markets that he must make an exception. It comes as no surprise to him that markets have reacted so negatively to the outbreak, given they hate uncertainty. “It’s hard to know exactly what the short-term damage to profits and sales is going to be because things are changing on a daily basis,” he says.

“And it’s even harder to predict what the longer-term implications might be for companies.

“The authorities, whether they’re monetary or governments, are responding to varying degrees around the world. It’s all very supportive but I think until one of the western markets plateaus in the number of new cases of coronavirus, it’s hard to see stock markets reacting in a sustainably positive way.”

With such dynamic movement of markets, Denham is reminding himself not to screen watch but to get on with the fundamentals of the job: analysing companies. However, he is confident in the resilience of the companies the fund invests in, saying the process means the team homes in on businesses with high sustainable profitability that reinvest for growth: businesses that can “grow to some extent under their own steam”. “I don’t want to be too cavalier about it but one hopes the long-term damage to their franchises won’t be that much.”

Year to date the Euro Stoxx 50 is down by 28.8%, while the broader Stoxx Europe 600 is down 24.6% in sterling terms, but Denham argues that while there is no one particular area of opportunity, the drop has created entry points for a range of the portfolio’s holdings. “At the margin we’ve been using cash to add to some of our holdings, just as the prices have come down.”

Denham says with reporting season ending a couple of months ago, there has not been a lot of bottom-up specific corporate news as everything is about the effect of coronavirus.

“But day to day, we just carry on, me and my analysts. We have a shortlist at any given moment of about six names we are working on.”

Luxury powerhouses versus tech titans

The team looks for businesses that have two key characteristics: high sustainable profitability and the reinvestment of profits internally to grow the business for the future. The combination of those two factors results in a compounding effect in the value of the company over time, according to Denham.

The team screens 1,600 companies from across Europe based on different factors around profitability and reinvestment.

But that’s just a starting point, says Denham. “Ninety per cent of the work we do is traditional fundamental analysis of meeting management to understand the business drivers and do our valuation.”

In terms of sectors, Denham says despite the obvious lack of technology leaders, Europe has a lot to offer and is an overlooked region. “Clearly, Europe hasn’t benefited from the internet business model explosion over the past 20 years in the same way that other regions have. We don’t have a Facebook or Google that dominate the world; we don’t have an Alibaba, Tencent or Mercado Libre that you would find in emerging markets.

“But let’s not overlook the fact that in Europe we do have amazing businesses. For instance, luxury goods companies LVMH, Hermes, Adidas and Puma.”

Puma is the fourth-largest position in the Grande Europe fund, accounting for 4.3% of the portfolio.

Europe may not have tech titans but Denham draws attention to niche players in the tech space such as semiconductor company ASML and German software provider SAP, which is the second-largest position in the portfolio at 5.25%.

Denham also believes European companies lead the world in renewable energy and the theme accounts for about 10% of the portfolio. “That’s the next mega-trend for the next few decades,” he says. The portfolio contains Danish wind turbine company Vesta but he also highlights Siemens Gamesa and Orsted as key players in the space.

“In addition there are solar plays,” he adds. “We have a solar farm developer called Solaria in our portfolios, so in Europe we can really tap into this mega-trend for the future.”

The European market by market capitalisation is dominated by or has large exposure to sectors Denham just does not find interesting. These are banks, insurance, utilities, telecoms, oil and which, in aggregate, account for nearly 40% of the European market by capitalisation.

“You have to be fully active in Europe to avoid those sectors. Our active share is above 90% so we don’t follow the benchmark at all.”

An area the team particularly likes at the moment is biotech because of its diversified pipeline, which Denham thinks is underappreciated by the market. About 8% of the fund is exposed to this sector. “Businesses here such as Morphosys, Galapagos, Argenx have multi-billion euro market caps. We’re not talking about a Neil Woodford-type strategy of investing in illiquid names. We could sell our holdings in a couple of days.”

SRI criteria applied once universe has been whittled down

All funds at Carmignac integrate ESG but Denham’s strategies are also classed as socially responsible.

They have low exposure to carbon reserves and carbon emissions and exclude sectors such as weapons, tobacco and gambling.

Once the financial screen has whittled the universe down to about 500 names, the SRI criteria are applied, which further reduces the pool to about 400 stocks. From this group the team picks about 35 to 40 holdings after conducting fundamental analysis. Denham likes the portfolio to be concentrated and it has just 36 holdings currently.

He only ever looks to change about six or seven holdings in each year if deemed appropriate.

“If you have 100 stocks, first of all you’re not going deliver performance better than the benchmark and, second, you can’t follow them all. Above 40 becomes counterproductive; below 35 and you start to get a little bit too concentrated, almost like a focus fund.

“There’s more going on in Europe than meets the eye but, for whatever reason, we have ended up with a quite high concentration in Denmark.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9968498349189758}",neutral,0.9968498349189758,0
Jamaican-Scottish Nicholas Daley nominated for 2020 LVMH Prize | Loop Jamaica - Loop News Jamaica,"Thu, 09 Apr 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXmh0dHA6Ly9qYW1haWNhLmxvb3BuZXdzLmNvbS9jb250ZW50L2phbWFpY2FuLXNjb3R0aXNoLW5pY2hvbGFzLWRhbGV5LW5vbWluYXRlZC0yMDIwLWx2bWgtcHJpemXSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"In 2019, 1700 applicants, 100 nationalities registered, 20 semi-finalists, and 500 applications for the graduates section, registered to compete for fashion's top honour - particularly to young and up-and-coming designers.

Thousands narrowed to one when South African Thebe Magugu took the coveted prize.

In a press release, Delphine Arnault, executive vice president of Louis Vuitton and the founder of the LVMH Prize, said, “This year, once more, the semi-finalists impressed us with their creativity and their commitment to creating clothes that are respectful of the environment.

The eight finalists all have in common to be very talented in their respective fields and to aspire to enhance know-how.”

Fast forward to 2020 and in walks, coolly, Jamaican-Scottish designer Nicholas Daley.

In a 2018 GQ Style issue, Daley's designs were lauded as “cool as Mile Davis’s music”, but that was only the tip of the iceberg for the half-Jamaican designer.

Since then, Daley has built a steady momentum in the underground fashion arena, and today, he is ready to take his eponymous label mainstream.

The London-bred bespoke menswear designer is among industry peers shortlisted for the 2020 LVMH Prize. See some of his designs from the official LVMH Instagram page.

Daley is a graduate of Central Saint Martins, class of 2013, who launched his eponymous label in 2015.

Daley’s mom Maureen is Scottish, and his dad Jeffrey is Jamaican.

The designer cites many references of his aesthetic from seeing his family from the West Indies regularly at his parent’s home in Leicester, UK.

In an interview with British news media The Courier, Daley tapped on the many derivatives from which he drew inspiration.

“My whole life has been such an interesting mix, so many Scottish and Caribbean connections. You can see the Scottish influence in the names of towns and cities in Jamaica and even Bob Marley could trace his surname back to Celtic origins. Jamaica has a hint of that Celtic ancestry, and rum gets drunk fast, just like whisky in Scotland.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.94300377368927}",neutral,0.94300377368927,0
