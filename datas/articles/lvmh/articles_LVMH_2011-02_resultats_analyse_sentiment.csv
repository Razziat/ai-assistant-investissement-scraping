LVMH boss toasts 'vintage year' as champagne and handbag sales soar - The Guardian,"Fri, 04 Feb 2011 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy8yMDExL2ZlYi8wNC9sdm1oLWx1eHVyeS1zcGVuZGluZy1kb20tcGVyaWdub27SAVJodHRwczovL2FtcC50aGVndWFyZGlhbi5jb20vYnVzaW5lc3MvMjAxMS9mZWIvMDQvbHZtaC1sdXh1cnktc3BlbmRpbmctZG9tLXBlcmlnbm9u?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"While the supermarket classes are reining back their spending, the superyacht set are still splashing out on luxury leather goods and the finest champagnes.

LVMH, the world's largest luxury goods group, unveiled record revenues for the last year today as customers snapped up its brands, which range from Hennessy cognac to Christian Dior perfume, BeneFit cosmetics and fashion labels such as Donna Karan, Céline and Marc Jacobs.

The luxury goods market is booming again, despite widespread austerity measures in Europe and the US. Louis Vuitton had another record year, with double-digit revenue growth, and demand returned for luxury champagnes such as Dom Pérignon and Krug.

LVMH, whose brand portfolio also spans Fendi, Pucci and TAG Heuer, said sales had soared 19% to a record high of €20.3bn (£12.5bn) in 2010, up from €17.1bn the previous year. In the final three months of the year, revenues rose 20%. Profits from continued operations exceeded €4bn for the first time, with profits at the group's watches and jewellery division doubling.

LVMH's chairman and chief executive, Bernard Arnault, described 2010 as a ""great vintage"" for the company.

Luxury fashion brands Mulberry and Burberry are also enjoying bumper sales.

Sales of prestige cars have also risen rapidly this year, powered by a surge in demand from China. Last month Porsche said sales in 2010 were up 25% last year to 95,000. Some 63% more Porsches – or a total of 14,785 vehicles – were driven away from Chinese showrooms. The best-selling model, which accounts for more than half of Chinese sales, is the Cayenne SUV.

The rival German manufacturer BMW recently reported similarly buoyant business, with worldwide sales of its Rolls-Royce marque up 171% to 2,711.

A report from Barclays Capital says China now accounts for 12% of global luxury goods sales. This is set to rise further as the country's market is forecast to grow a further 20-30% a year.

LVMH wines and spirits bounced back from a decline in 2009 to record a 19% rise in revenues to €3.3bn. All champagne brands saw a strong recovery with particularly strong growth for the prestige cuvées – especially Dom Pérignon and Krug. Hennessy cognac, which did well throughout the crisis, is still selling strongly.

The group's biggest division, fashion and leather goods, saw turnover leap 20% to €7.6bn, while sales of perfumes and cosmetics gained 12% to €3.1bn. LVMH highlighted strong sales of Christian Dior perfumes including J'adore, Poison and Eau Sauvage, alongside the new Rouge Dior lipstick range and the Capture skincare line.

Late last year LVMH snapped up 20% of Hermès, the rival French luxury group. The family-controlled Hermès regards Arnault's interest as unwelcome and last week Hermès' chief executive, Patrick Thomas, said the stake was ""too much"".

Today LVMH's Arnault said he hoped to co-operate with the business, which is regarded as the ultimate luxury label. ""We can bring them [Hermès] a number of advantages, both strategically and operationally, without anything in return other than our presence as a shareholder,"" said the LVMH boss.

However, he also warned: ""We are a pacifist shareholder, which does not mean that we will be a passive shareholder.""","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 1.0}",positive,1.0,1

LVMH acquires skincare brand Ole Henriksen - Premium beauty,"Wed, 09 Feb 2011 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnByZW1pdW1iZWF1dHluZXdzLmNvbS9sdm1oLWFjcXVpcmVzLXNraW5jYXJlLWJyYW5kLW9sZSwyNzMw0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LVMH, Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, the world’s leading luxury products group and owner of Parfums Christian Dior, Guerlain and Parfums Givenchy, has completed the acquisition of Ole Henriksen, a U.S. botanical skincare company.

Ole Henriksen founded its namesake cosmetics brand in 1985, following the success of the spa he opened 10 years before and where he has been treating Hollywood’s most famous complexions. Ole Henriksen cosmetics consist of botanical-based skincare products and are currently sold in a total of 22 countries, in particular at Sephora, a subsidiary of LVMH, and in spas.

LVMH said Ole Henriksen is perfectly in line with its strategy to identify brands with strong, long-term potential and helping them to capitalize on it. The group said it will focus on Ole Henriksen’s future product development breakthroughs as well as on expanding international distribution. Mr. Henriksen will remain the brand’s creative director, however, the company, which will continue to be based in Los Angeles, expects to appoint a new CEO in early 2011, who will report to David Suliteanu, CEO and President of Sephora Americas. Terms of the transaction were not disclosed.

Last week, LVMH announced a 19% increase in revenue in 2010, exceeding the 20 billion Euro mark for the first time. The group’s Perfumes & Cosmetics business recorded revenue growth of 12% and an increase in profit from recurring operations of 14%.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9999691247940063}",positive,0.9999691247940063,1
"China loves Louis Vuitton, and your portfolio will too - Feb. 21, 2011 - CNN","Mon, 21 Feb 2011 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vbW9uZXkuY25uLmNvbS8yMDExLzAyLzIxL21hcmtldHMvY2hpbmFfbHV4dXJ5X2xvdWlzX3Z1aXR0b24vaW5kZXguaHRt0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"China loves Louis Vuitton, and so will investors

LVMH, which includes Louis Vuitton, Fendi and Dom P�rignon, has seen sales nearly double in China during the last five years.





NEW YORK (CNNMoney) -- China's red-hot economy has led to an explosion of millionaires who are ready and willing to spend on high-end brands like Louis Vuitton and Audi.

And that's good news for investors who are looking to jump on the luxury bandwagon.

Print Shoppers wait their turn to enter a Louis Vuitton shop in Shanghai.

""If you look at the footprints of high-end European brands within Asia, they tend to be relatively small, but growing very quickly,"" said Jason White, a portfolio specialist for the T. Rowe Price Overseas Stock Fund (TROSX), which holds shares of Cartier jewelry-maker Compagnie Financière Richemont (CFR, Switzerland and Audi-maker Volkswagen (VOW, Frankfurt).

White added that sales of BMW (BMW, Frankfurt) and Mercedes-maker Daimler (DAI, Frankfurt) are also surging in China.

Over the past decade, there's been a 50% increase in the number of Chinese millionaires, with most of them under 40 years old, according to CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets.

And they love the glitz and glam: donning Louis Vuitton handbags and Richemont watches, sipping Dom Pérignon champagne, and cruising around in Audis.

""Chinese consumers have buoyed and kept the luxury markets around the world solvent,"" said Shaun Rein, Shanghai-based managing director of the China Market Research Group.

In addition to clamoring for designer goods at stores in Shanghai, Beijing and Hong Kong, Chinese tourists have dominated sales at flagship locations on New York's Fifth Avenue and throughout Europe, where the goods are about 30% cheaper than they are on mainland China.

A Louis Vuitton boutique in London was recently forced to limit shoppers to three purchases to make sure they would have enough left, said Kirk Cheyfitz, CEO of global marketing agency Story Worldwide, at the Bloomberg China Investment Strategies conference earlier this month.

Playing the trend

CLSA forecasts that China will become the world's largest market for luxury goods over the course of the next decade, accounting for 44% of global sales by 2020, from 15% today.

Though they do take a hit during economic downturns, Magoon Capital Chief Executive Christian Magoon said the luxury brand companies are still sound investments.

""Luxury brand companies are solid investments over the long term because it's very difficult for new players to enter the space,"" Magoon said. ""These brands have tradition and status that makes them unique and gives them the ability to price things as high as they want.""

Chinese buyers are Louis Vuitton's biggest customers already, according to CLSA, and sales will likely keep growing alongside an increase in the number of Chinese millionaires.

And demand for luxury goods is likely to pick up even more steam if the Chinese government allows the yuan to appreciate, which would make imports like Louis Vuitton bags less expensive.

""A rising yuan would give the Chinese much more buying power,"" said Jonathan Masse, senior portfolio manager of AlphaShares, the fund management company co-founded by Princeton University economist Burton Malkiel, who also authored From Wall Street to the Great Wall: How Investors Can Profit from China's Booming Economy.

LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton (LVMH, Paris), the world's largest luxury goods groups with its 60 brands including its namesakes, Tag Heur and Fendi, is one of the biggest holdings in AlphaShares' global China-linked portfolio.

Prada may be the next hot buy. Last month, the Italian fashion house announced plans to list its shares on the Hong Kong stock exchange as it looks to expand its international business.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9162500500679016}",neutral,0.9162500500679016,0
Second-Tier Strategy: Louis Vuitton Launches In Zhengzhou - Jing Daily,"Tue, 08 Feb 2011 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vamluZ2RhaWx5LmNvbS9wb3N0cy9zZWNvbmQtdGllci1zdHJhdGVneS1sb3Vpcy12dWl0dG9uLWxhdW5jaGVzLWluLXpoZW5nemhvddIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Louis Vuitton Zhengzhou (Image: LVMH)

Louis Vuitton's massive expansion in China continues unabated in 2011, as the French luxury powerhouse moves further beyond saturated markets like Beijing and into even more second- and third-tier cities. Now operating locations in 29 cities, from Shanghai to Shenyang, Hangzhou to Harbin, Louis Vuitton, like rapidly expanding competitors Gucci and Prada, has turned its focus to the lucrative inland market in recent years.

Recently, following the lead of Gucci, Louis Vuitton made its debut in Zhengzhou, capital of Henan Province, a city known more for its proximity to the famous Shaolin Temple (少林寺) than high-end shopping. However, at the launch of its Zhengzhou boutique last April, Gucci recorded ""easily over"" 1 million yuan (US$152,000) worth of sales in the first day alone. It may be a young market, but Zhengzhou has potential.

Located at the city's Yudafufu Mall (裕达福福商场), the opening of Zhengzhou's Louis Vuitton store didn't come cheap. In preparation for the brand's arrival, Yudafufu claims to have spent millions on remodeling, adding a VIP elevator and lounge, a floor-tile mosaic of the Champs-Élysées, and Sino-French design touches throughout the store. According to the store manager, Huang Jianxiong, the new Louis Vuitton boutique is unique not only in its design, but also its focus on service. As Huang told iFeng , ""We ask our staff to help customers from the time they enter the store until they leave. If the customer knows exactly what he or she is looking for, we'll help them find it. If not, we'll help the customer find the right item for him or her. We don't just wait behind the counter waiting for customers to ask us for help, but rather we actively take the initiative to understand their needs and give them advice.""

While this sounds like pretty standard practice, complaints about poor service at luxury boutiques are common in China, with netizens often recounting tales of brusque service that sent them shopping online or in Hong Kong instead of locally. Now, with major brands pulling out all the stops to convince Chinese consumers to buy closer to home, improving customer service is becoming a key priority.

Galliano Web Video Raises More Questions - The New York Times,"Mon, 28 Feb 2011 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMTEvMDMvMDEvYnVzaW5lc3MvZ2xvYmFsLzAxZ2FsbGlhbm8uaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS  John Galliano, the chief designer for Christian Dior, faced fresh accusations on Monday of anti-Semitism after a video surfaced of Mr. Galliano appearing to deliver a tirade in a Paris bar.

Mr. Galliano, 50, arrived Monday at a police station in Paris to answer accusations by a French couple that he had verbally abused them last week at the bar, La Perle, in the Marais district of the city. He was suspended Friday from Dior after the episode was reported.

The video, posted on the Web site of the British tabloid The Sun, appears to show a separate incident at the same bar. In it, Mr. Galliano appears to taunt other patrons, declaring in a slurred voice that “people like you would be dead,” and that “your mothers, your forefathers” would all be “gassed.” He added, “I love Hitler.” It was unclear when the video was recorded.

As the video circulated Monday, executives from Dior and its parent company, LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, held emergency meetings about how to respond, but they issued no statements.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9932820796966553}",neutral,0.9932820796966553,0
Beauty more than skin deep as giant buys into Ali's firm - Irish Independent,"Wed, 23 Feb 2011 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmluZGVwZW5kZW50LmllL2lyaXNoLW5ld3MvYmVhdXR5LW1vcmUtdGhhbi1za2luLWRlZXAtYXMtZ2lhbnQtYnV5cy1pbnRvLWFsaXMtZmlybS8yNjcwNzc1Ni5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LVMH, the world's largest luxury good conglomerate has bought a 70pc controlling stake in Ali Hewson's Nude Skincare, the chemical-free beauty business the Dublin mother of four started five years ago.

First Edun, now Nude, Ali's organic fashion and skincare lifestyle vision is too attractive a proposition for the luxury brand group to ignore.

The French company, home to 60 of the world's most luxurious brands like Louis Vuitton, Moet, Hennessy and Givenchy has paid an undisclosed sum for a 70pc stake in the pioneering biocompatible skincare. The remaining 30pc stake will be retained by Ali, Bryan Meehan, with whom she developed the range, and Irish businessman Paddy McKillen, who recently went to the Supreme Court over NAMA.

Fans of the skincare range, which uses bioavailable ingredients like hyaluronic acids and an advanced cellular renewal serum, include the French president's wife, Carla Bruni and models Christy Turlington and Helena Christensen.

Nude Skincare controversially hit the headlines in 2009 after Ali sued designer Stella McCartney over copyright. Two of the green fashion world's biggest names went to court as the Irish woman tried to stop the designer from releasing a perfume called ""Stella Nude"", claiming that the title of the fragrance was too close to that of the Nude Skincare line.

Heavy-hitters

This is the second time that Ali's eco/ethical/organic vision has brought her to the attention of heavy-hitter LVMH. It bought a minority stake in Edun in 2009. Ali started the organic clothing line with her husband in 2005 and they worked together with New York designer Rogan Gregory.

It was during a discussion the following year about ethical clothing that Ali expressed interest to Meehan in developing a natural skincare range.

He was already in the business, a co-founder of British organic store Fresh&Wild, which Wholefoods bought for $38m (€27.6m) in 2004. Their successful brand of skincare has been sold in Harvey Nichols in the UK and Barneys in the US. The Nude Skincare range is already sold through LMVH's retail arm Sephora in the US, which is expected to be developed as one of the brand's primary distribution outlets.

Edun clothing has been an ethical success story for Ali and Bono. The company was founded on the premise of trade versus aid as a means of building sustainable communities. Two years ago, LVMH's investment was regarded by some as a bit of a shift for the luxury group but commentators said it showed that luxury's growing move toward the sustainable was more than just a flash in the pan.

Announcing the 70pc stake, Antonio Belloni, group managing director of LVMH, said it believed Nude would be a global luxury skin care brand.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9992807507514954}",neutral,0.9992807507514954,0
