LVMH will not be allowed to buy out ... - British Vogue,"Wed, 21 Dec 2011 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZvZ3VlLmNvLnVrL2FydGljbGUvbHZtaC13aWxsLW5vdC1iZS1hbGxvd2VkLXRvLWJ1eS1vdXQtaGVybWVzLWFtZi1maW5kc9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Updated Wednesday December 21, 7.11am: LVMH has again increased its stake in Hermès, despite the controlling family having been allowed to create a nonlisted holding company to protect a majority share. The family received permission from the French monetary authority - the AMF - to group more than 50 per cent of its shares together in a bid to prevent an LVMH takeover. Bernard Armault's conglomerate's shares have now crept from 21.4 per cent to 22.3 per cent.

Updated Thursday September 15, 11.27am: An appeal against the January decision to allow Hermès to protect itself from takeover by LVMH has been rejected by the court of appeal in France today. Hermès International will now create a nonlisted holding company, WWD reports, in a bid to reinforce its defences against a potential takeover by LVMH. Trading in Hermès shares was suspended today in expectation of the ruling.

***Updated Thuesday August 9, 2.34pm: *** LVMH has upped its stake in Hermès from 20.2 per cent to 21.4 per cent despite assuring shareholders and board members - since it first acquired shares in family-owned label last October - that it had no intention of attempting to gain control of the brand.

Updated Monday March 20, 10.32am: Hermès has confirmed that it has initiated discussions to sell its 45 per cent stake in Jean Paul Gaultier, WWD reports, but has not revealed the details of any potential buyers. Hermès bought 35 per cent of Gaultier in 1999, before the designer became creative director of the iconic house in 2004, and raised its stake to 45 per cent in 2008. Gaultier showed his last collection for Hermès for spring/summer 2011 and was replaced by former Lacoste creative director Christophe Lemaire.

Updated Monday March 20, 10.32am: Hermès ceo Patrick Thomas has explained why the family-owned company is reluctant to become a part of LVMH.

""There is a part of our world that is playing on abundance, on glitz and glamour, he told the New York Times. ""And there is another part that is concentrated on refinement, and basically making beautiful objects. We don't want to be a part of this financial world which is ruining companies and dealing with people like they are goods or raw materials. It's not a financial fight, because we would lose that. It's a cultural fight."""

The French luxury mills LVMH is reported to be eyeing the much-coveted L-shaped Drake site at 56th and 57th streets and Park Avenue. The luxe company wants to expand its presence in the city, presently confined along the north side of East 57th Street from its Christian de Portzamparc-designed headquarters at Fifth Avenue to Park Avenue. A rumor-bird from the industry has suggested that the company is presently looking at developing a high-stakes hotel, apartments, and retail for their brands, and this single best piece of land proves perfect for them.
