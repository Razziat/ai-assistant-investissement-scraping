Why Rihanna's New Fenty Brand With LVMH Is Such a Big Deal | TIME - TIME,"Fri, 10 May 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiOmh0dHBzOi8vdGltZS5jb20vNTU4NzI1OS9yaWhhbm5hLWZlbnR5LWx2bWgtZmFzaGlvbi1ob3VzZS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Rihanna confirmed on Friday the launch of her much-rumored new luxury fashion brand in partnership with LVMH Moët Hennessy (LVMH), the largest luxury goods conglomerate in the world. The new deal makes Rihanna the first woman of color to lead an LVMH label, and cements her position amongst the fashion industry’s biggest names.

The fashion house, which LVMH has reportedly already invested $30 million into, will live under the Fenty umbrella Rihanna has already built out in the beauty business, with Fenty Beauty, and with her lingerie brand Savage X Fenty. She shared the news in a post on Instagram revealing the monogram-ready logo for the brand.

In the year and a half since she launched Fenty Beauty, her first venture with LVMH, Rihanna has demonstrated the formidable popularity of her brand — and its game-changing potential. In 2018, Fenty Beauty — one of TIME’s Most Genius Companies of 2018 — grossed more than $500 million dollars in sales and quickly cultivated a more diverse consumer base than its rivals due in large part to its products and campaigns celebrating inclusivity, and offering a wider range of skin tones.

Rihanna is also not a rookie to the apparel market either. In 2014, she was named a creative director of the sportswear brand Puma under the brand FENTY X PUMA; she has also previously collaborated on collections with the British high street chain River Island, and on a socks line with hosiery and apparel brand Stance.

So while the announcement of a Fenty expansion into an full-fledged fashion house may not come as a surprise, it still marks a significant moment, and milestone for an industry grappling with influencer culture, new revenue streams and diversified customer bases. Here’s what you need to know:

‘Big day for the culture’: Rihanna’s deal marks a shift for the fashion industry

Fenty Maison will be based in France, and will be the first label in the prestigious LVMH stable — which includes Dior, Fendi, Givenchy, Marc Jacobs, and Céline among many others — to be created and run by a woman of color. It has also been over 30 years since LVMH launched a new luxury-apparel brand, the last being Christian Lacroix in 1987.

More than a considerable landmark for the luxury fashion business, the creation of a Fenty fashion house is emblematic of cultural change, especially for a company like LVMH, whose reputation asserts an aspirational aesthetic rooted in European hegemony. “Big day for the culture…,” Rihanna wrote in an Instagram caption celebrating the news. “This is proof that nothing is impossible.”

“LVMH consists of many brands associated with what the French call patrimoine culturel — cultural heritage — or francité,” Rhonda Garelick, a professor and fashion historian at Parsons School of Design, told TIME in an email. “Rihanna enters into this line-up, taking her place alongside venerable, historic, and iconic figures. It is symbolic of a seismic shift in how we view, sustain, and rewrite the canons of European prestige and history. And it signals the growing understanding of the need to embrace new, global definitions of what constitutes prestige, history, and luxury.”

“Given France’s own colonial history, we must not overlook the potent symbolism of a woman of color, from a former European colony in the Caribbean, rising to helm a new luxury brand from this iconic French company,” Garelick said.

European luxury labels have been the slow in diversifying their creative leadership and related branding, from campaign imagery to runway representation. When Virgil Abloh was named was named artistic director of LVMH namesake brand Louis Vuitton’s menswear line in 2018, he became (and still is) one of the only black designers to have ever headed a heritage fashion house.

Rihanna’s LVMH collaboration is also a savvy business move

“Through our partnership at Fenty Beauty, I discovered a true entrepreneur, a real CEO and a terrific leader,” LVMH CEO Bernard Arnault said in a press release announcing the new venture Friday morning. “She naturally finds her full place within LVMH.” Arnault, who at a net worth of more than $94 billion is currently the fourth-wealthiest person in the world, has been a scion in the luxury fashion industry for more than four decades.

“Mr. Arnault has given me a unique opportunity to develop a fashion house in the luxury sector, with no artistic limits,” Rihanna teased in the same statement. “I’m ready for the world to see what we have built together.”

The new venture stands as a reflection of LVMH’s booming business — the company reported more than $14 billion in revenue in Q1 of 2019, a 16% increase in growth in comparison to last year. Furthermore, it illustrates the potential still to be tapped by famous figures and the loyal followings they’ve cultivated.

While celebrity fashion labels are far from revolutionary, Rihanna is likely to be set apart due to the demonstrated reach of her brand (which can only be expanded upon in this new partnership), and the credentials she has already established.

“Rihanna’s value to LVMH lies also in her vast social media following,” Garelick explained. “She has tens of millions of followers… not just for her talent, fame, or beauty, but because she projects a very real, authentic self on these platforms, and takes seriously what her followers say and think.”

Beyond reach alone, the combined industry expertise of LVMH makes this collaboration unlike other celebrity fashion projects. Editor of Womenswear Daily Miles Socha told the Associated Press: “what’s different about this Rihanna project is her partner, which is the world’s largest luxury group, which has expertise across a range of leather goods, perfumes, fashion, beauty — so it really raises the bar for celebrity-led fashion brands.”

While little about the brand has yet to be revealed beyond the logo and a teaser digital presence, eager devotees won’t have to wait long. The first Fenty collection is set to debut in Paris later this summer.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9989456534385681}",neutral,0.9989456534385681,0
"Rihanna, Breaking New Ground, Joins With LVMH for Fashion Brand (Published 2019) - The New York Times","Fri, 10 May 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMTkvMDUvMTAvZmFzaGlvbi9yaWhhbm5hLWx2bWgtZmVudHkuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Get ready for the second coming of Fenty.

On Friday, LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, the world’s largest luxury group, officially confirmed not only that the fashion line created by Rihanna was becoming part of its gilded stable, but also that the first products from the new company would be unveiled — in a few weeks. Thus the disruption of the status quo begins.

Rihanna will become the first woman to create an original brand at LVMH, the first woman of color at the top of an LVMH maison, and her line will be the first new house created by the group since Christian Lacroix in 1987. It joins such storied heritage brands as Dior, Givenchy, Celine and Fendi and positions Rihanna as a breakthrough designer on a number of levels.

[An update: In 2021, LVMH and Rihanna hit pause on the Fenty lines.]

The move is a formal acknowledgment from the establishment that a multi-hyphenate pop star/actress/image-maker now has as much global currency, name-recognition and (yes) influence as designers like Hedi Slimane and Nicolas Ghesquière. That there is no need to limit them to the street or sportswear world. And that growth in the luxury industry may no longer come just from reinventing old heritage names, but by embracing a new diverse, digital, direct communication-enabled reality.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9979780316352844}",neutral,0.9979780316352844,0
LVMH Launches a Blockchain Service as Authenticity - Particularly in Resale - Comes Under the Microscope - The Fashion Law,"Fri, 17 May 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilwFodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGVmYXNoaW9ubGF3LmNvbS9sdm1oLWp1c3QtbGF1bmNoZWQtYS1ibG9ja2NoYWluLXNlcnZpY2UtdG8tZmlnaHQtZmFrZXMtYXMtYXV0aGVudGljaXR5LXBhcnRpY3VsYXJseS1pbi1yZXNhbGUtY29tZXMtdW5kZXItdGhlLW1pY3Jvc2NvcGUv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The value of the counterfeit market reached $1.2 trillion in 2017, nearly $100 billion of which was directly linked the fake luxury goods. Since the brands that fall under the umbrella of LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, including Louis Vuitton, Dior, Celine, Loewe, and Givenchy, among others, are routinely some of the hardest hit by the black market, the Paris-based conglomerate has taken matters into its own hands in an attempt to assist consumers in determining the authenticity of products – or the lack thereof.

By way of a partnership with blockchain company ConsenSys and Microsoft, LVMH has launched AURA, a platform that it says “aims to serve the entire luxury industry with powerful product tracking and tracing services, based on Ethereum blockchain technology and utilizing Microsoft’s [cloud computing service] Azure.” In short: the blockchain-based service will make it possible for consumers to access the product history and proof of authenticity of luxury goods — from raw materials to the point of sale, all the way to second-hand markets.

While such measures will not serve to eradicate the fake trade by consumers intentionally in search of fakes (neither LVMH nor any other luxury group or brand can eliminate consumer desire to buy counterfeits), what such a service stands to do is to ensure that consumers in search of authentic goods are not duped by fakes, and thus, enables brands to protect both consumers and their brand reputations from potentially low-quality counterfeits. That is significant, as the likelihood that consumers can be tricked into buying fakes is – by nearly all accounts – greater than ever before.

In addition to the increased sophistication of many counterfeit products, the methods for accessing these goods have similarly improved. As Levi’s noted in a lawsuit in 2017, counterfeit-selling defendants routinely make use of “content and images that make it very difficult for consumers to distinguish [between] such stores and authorized retailers,” as well as “unauthorized search engine optimization tactics and social media spamming so that [their website] listings show up at or near the top of relevant search results and misdirect consumers searching for [authentic] Levi’s brand products.”

More than that, though, if a couple of recent Chanel lawsuits are any indication, counterfeit goods of varying quality-levels have seeped into the burgeoning $25 billion luxury resale market, concerns about which are almost certainly one of the drivers behind the recent launch of LVMH’s authentication service.

As for how the AURA system words: newly-made products will be “recorded on the shared ledger, irreproducible and containing unique information.” Then, “at the time of purchase, a consumer can use the brand’s application to receive the AURA certificate containing all product information.” This information will carry over to seasons – or years – later when a product, such as a bag, is off-loaded with a resale site and purchased thereafter.

To date, LVMH says that “several brands from the Group, such as Louis Vuitton and Christian Dior, are currently involved, and advanced discussions are underway to onboard additional brands from the LVMH Group, and other luxury groups globally.”

The issue of luxury authentication has been one of increased discussion and scrutiny particularly as resale companies have grown in size and influence. As recently as this past February, Chanel argued that despite boasting about its “team of luxury ‘experts,’” who ensure that “every item [that The RealReal sells] is 100% authentic,” none of The RealReal’s staff “is, in fact, properly qualified or trained in authentication of Chanel products to support [TRR’s] claims as to the genuineness of the products it resells.”

This he said-she said over the authentication of luxury goods for resale is far from an issue that is exclusive to the Chanel lawsuits. In reality, the ability of resellers to properly authenticate products (every single time) and thus, build consumer trust is at the core of pre-owned luxury market, meaning that such a service will be of enormous benefit to them. Still yet, since luxury brands have – to a large extent – conceded the ability to completely control the market for their (pre-owned) products and the distributions chains associated therewith, as a result of the sweeping rise of the resale market.

With that in mind, LVMH’s recently-launched authenticity effort (and others like it) give its brands the ability to ensure that consumers are protected from fakes and that their reputations are protected, as well. In a business where handbags cost upwards of $1,500 and t-shirts are going for hundreds, the reputation (or goodwill) associated with a brand and its name is an highly valuable asset, and one in need to careful protection.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9989393353462219}",neutral,0.9989393353462219,0

The singer turned fashion and beauty mogul just landed a major deal with LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, the French luxury goods conglomerate. According to a statement from the high-end fashion group released this morning, the 31-year-old’s successful Fenty line is the latest to join their powerhouse lineup of brands which include Céline, Dior, Givenchy and Fendi among many more. This breakthrough moment solidifies Rihanna’s spot in fashion history as she’s now the “first woman to create an original brand at LVMH and the first woman of color at the top of an LVMH maison,” according to The New York Times.

Fenty Maison — which marks the first new house created under LVMH since Christian Lacroix in 1987 — is set to be a Paris-based collection of ready-to-wear, shoes and accessories. According to LVMH, the first launch from the brand, (whose logo features a “graphic representation of Fenty that resembles a Greek key design,” according to The New York Times) is coming soon.

Rihanna reflected on this major career achievement in a touching Tweet posted this morning, writing, “big day for the culture. thank you Mr. Arnault for believing in this little girl from the left side of an island, and for giving me the opportunity to grow with you at @LVMH.”

After the success of their first collaborative project Fenty Beauty (which sent shock waves through the makeup world by releasing 40 inclusive shades of foundation in 2017), LVMH Chairman Bernard Arnault said in a statement, “Everybody knows Rihanna as a wonderful singer, but through our partnership at Fenty Beauty, I discovered a true entrepreneur, a real C.E.O. and a terrific leader.”

He added, “She naturally finds her full place within LVMH. To support Rihanna to start up the Fenty Maison, we have built a talented and multicultural team supported by the Group resources.”

According to WWD sources, this team of experts have been at work since January. The outlet also hinted that the Fenty Maison launch might coincide with her ninth (and long-awaited) studio album. Whether or not the rumors are true, our girl RihRih is staying busy and making history.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9917798638343811}",positive,0.9917798638343811,1

Rihanna and luxury conglomerate LVMH are partnering to launch Fenty Maison, a ready-to-wear, shoes, and accessories label that is set to be released this spring.

""Designing a line like this with LVMH is an incredibly special moment for us. Mr. [Bernard] Arnault has given me a unique opportunity to develop a fashion house in the luxury sector, with no artistic limits,"" Rihanna said in a statement.

The groundbreaking partnership is of major significance, as Fenty Maison is the first new fashion house LVMH has created from the ground up since Christian Lacroix in 1987, BoF reports. The New York Times adds that Rih is also the first woman to launch an original brand within the parent company and is also the first woman of color at the top of an LVMH house.

""Everybody knows Rihanna as a wonderful singer, but through our partnership at Fenty Beauty, I discovered a true entrepreneur, a real C.E.O. and a terrific leader,"" said LVMH chairman Bernard Arnault in a statement, per the New York Times and BoF.

BoF adds that LVMH invested 30 million Euros (over $33.7 million) into the partnership while the Bajan pop princess is adding roughly the same of ""in-kind contributions"" aka lending her name, personal brand power, and time to the venture.

Given Rihanna's proven ability to create well-thought-out looks that mix edgy streetwear staples with high fashion confections, it's safe to anticipate her forthcoming line will embody a similar ethos. Along with promoting a roster of racially diverse and size-inclusive talent as part of the campaign, similar to her Fenty Beauty and Savage X Fenty launches.

Fans started speculating on Instagram this week when the style icon was spotted wearing sunglasses emblazoned with ""Fenty"" on the temples—suggesting it may have been a prototype from a new collection.

Will Robyn Fenty be one of the next great artistic directors? In 2016, the Rihanna launched her first foray into fashion with a contemporary clothing line backed by sportswear brand Puma, called Fenty x Puma. She debuted collection at New York Fashion Week and Paris Fashion Week, with major celebrities and industry insiders filling the seats.

"Two years in, LVMH's 24 Sèvres has a new name and a new focus on international shoppers - Glossy","Fri, 31 May 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmdsb3NzeS5jby9mYXNoaW9uL3R3by15ZWFycy1hZnRlci1sYXVuY2gtbHZtaHMtMjQtc2V2cmVzLXJlYnJhbmRzLWFuZC1yZWZvY3VzZXMtb24tYW4taW50ZXJuYXRpb25hbC1hdWRpZW5jZS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"In the two years since LVMH launched its multi-brand e-commerce platform 24 Sèvres, the luxury group has learned a lot from its big foray into online shopping and is rebranding the platform to fit. The most important takeaway: International audiences are LVMH’s biggest online consumers.

Starting last week, 24 Sèvres is now known as 24S, a new name that the company said was meant to cater to its large international audience.

When the company first launched, LVMH played up its French identity. 24 Sèvres is the address of LVMH-owned Parisian department store Le Bon Marche, which the online platform was meant to be an online counterpart to. But it was not the French who took to the concept. The company does not disclose specific revenue figures, but in its first two years of life, the majority of 24S’s sales came from international shoppers in the more than 100 countries it sells to outside of its home of France.

“We have seen tremendous organic growth in markets where 24S’s Parisian point of view resonates particularly strongly, and we are committed to going where our customers are shopping from, regardless of where in the world that is,” said Eric Goguey, CEO of 24S. “Since launch, we have delivered orders to over 100 countries, and this year will see dedicated attention to those highly engaged regions, as well as further development of our top markets, among which the U.S. is a key driver.”

To better cater to an international audience, 24S is adding new languages to the site — German and Korean, in addition to the existing English and French — and is hiring employees in New York, Miami and Hong Kong.

The shift to internationalism is reflected across its marketing — like the campaign from last year that targeted a global audience — and market research the company has done on different demographics. Based on that research, it concluded that U.S. customers tend to prefer leather goods and big-name brands more so than other countries.

“From day one, the ambition has been to provide unique and exciting pieces to our customers,” said Maud Barrionuevo, buying and merchandising director for 24S. “In the past year, we have collaborated with luxury and contemporary designers from Céline and AMI to Erdem and Louis Vuitton. The choice of brands we work with always stems from our customer herself: She’s a global consumer who loves to mix-and-match luxury and contemporary pieces, and these capsules are meant to reflect that.”

24S’s competitors, mainly Net-a-Porter and Farfetch, are also looking toward global expansion. The two are the most highly trafficked luxury e-commerce platforms, with Farfetch surpassing Net-a-Porter in 2015. 24S, while smaller and with less distribution than those two, has LVMH’s full confidence, particularly thanks to its strategy of focusing on exclusives and catering to an international customer.

“24S exceeded performance expectations in 2018 and has demonstrated particularly powerful growth in markets where shoppers have a strong appetite for our unique Parisian point of view,” said Ian Rogers, chief digital officer of LVMH. “Bringing this vision of fashion to the world was central to our mission from the very start, and this year sees us taking a step toward breaking down geographic barriers between us and our customers.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9963449835777283}",neutral,0.9963449835777283,0
Rihanna to launch new fashion label with LVMH - Spectrum News 1,"Fri, 10 May 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vc3BlY3RydW1uZXdzMS5jb20vYXAtdG9wLW5ld3MvMjAxOS8wNS8xMC9yaWhhbm5hLXRvLWxhdW5jaC1uZXctZmFzaGlvbi1sYWJlbC13aXRoLWx2bWjSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"NEW YORK (AP) — Rihanna certified her status as a cultural fashion icon with her groundbreaking new deal with LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, the world's largest luxury group.

The pop star, born Robyn Rihanna Fenty, announced Friday that she will debut a line called Fenty this spring through LVMH. Her luxury house will be based in Paris.

The 31-year-old singer becomes the first person since 1987 to launch a new house with LVMH (the last person was Christian LaCroix). Rihanna is also reportedly the first woman to create an original brand at LVMH and the first woman of color at the top of an LVMH maison.

""Designing a line like this with LVMH is an incredibly special moment for us,"" Rihanna said in a statement. She added that Bernard Arnault, the chairman and CEO of LVMH, ""has given me a unique opportunity to develop a fashion house in the luxury sector, with no artistic limits. I couldn't imagine a better partner both creatively and business-wise, and I'm ready for the world to see what we have built together.""

LVMH's leather and goods division includes Louis Vuitton, Christian Dior Couture, Celine, Kenzo, Givenchy, Fendi, Marc Jacobs and more, while its wine and spirts includes Moët & Chandon and Dom Pérignon. The company has also backed Rihanna's ultra-successful cosmetics brand, Fenty Beauty.

Arnault said ""everybody knows Rihanna as a wonderful singer, but through our partnership at Fenty Beauty, I discovered a true entrepreneur, a real CEO and a terrific leader.""

""She naturally finds her full place within LVMH,"" he continued. ""I am proud that LVMH is leading this venture and wish it will be a great success.""

Fashion has been synonymous with Rihanna's name since the Grammy-winning superstar launched her music career in 2005. She has collaborated with brands like Armani, Puma, Dior and more to launch products and lines, and she debuted her lingerie line, Savage X Fenty, last year. Her Fenty Beauty collection disrupted the beauty industry when it launched in 2017, offering 40 foundation shades and bringing in more than $500 million by the end of last year. The success of it forced other cosmetic brands to be more inclusive and launch more foundation color shades, while Fenty even extended to 50 shades.

A release date for Rihanna's new Fenty line with LVMH was not announced, but a website where consumers can eventually purchase the line launched Friday. The new line ""is centered on Rihanna, developed by her, and takes shape with her vision in terms of ready to wear, shoes and accessories, including commerciality and communication of the brand,"" according to a press release.

""Celebrity fashion brands have been around a long time and led by singers, but in the past they've tended to be done via licensing, wholesale distribution and often more with mass retailers or department stores. What's different about this Rihanna project is her partner, which is the world's largest luxury group, which has expertise across a range of leather goods, perfumes, fashion, beauty — so it really raises the bar for celebrity-led fashion brands,"" Miles Socha, editor-in-chief of WWD, said in an interview with The Associated Press.

Rihanna, a native of Barbados, expressed her excitement about the epic new deal in an Instagram post Friday.

""Big day for the culture,"" she wrote. ""Thank you Mr. Arnault for believing in this little girl from the left side of an island, and for giving me the opportunity to grow with you at @LVMH. This is proof that nothing is impossible. Glory be to God.""

"LVMH Confirms Fenty Maison, a New Luxury Collection with Rihanna - The Fashion Law","Fri, 10 May 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWZhc2hpb25sYXcuY29tL2x2bWgtY29uZmlybXMtZmVudHktbWFpc29uLWx1eHVyeS1jb2xsZWN0aW9uLXdpdGgtcmloYW5uYS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"It is official. LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton announced on Friday that it is following months of speculation, it is, in fact, launching a new luxury label this spring with Rihanna. According to the Paris-based luxury goods conglomerate, Fenty Maison will include ready-to-wear apparel, shoes and accessories. The parent to Louis Vuitton, Dior, Celine, Givenchy, and Marc Jacobs, amongst some 70 other luxury brands, has not revealed any further information in terms of the debut release.

Rumors have been swirling that LVMH and Rihanna were set to expand their partnership beyond her hot-selling Fenty Beauty, which is a joint venture with LVMH, to include a full-fledged fashion line, with the luxury goods group and the multi-hyphenate Grammy winner having engaged in “secret discussions to launch a luxury house under her name” since early this year.

“Rihanna will become the first woman to create an original brand at LVMH, the first woman of color at the top of an LVMH maison, and her line will be the first new house created by the group since Christian Lacroix in 1987,” according to the New York Times’ Vanessa Friedman.

The new venture comes after 31-year old Rihanna Fenty launched her eponymous beauty line with Kendo, LVMH’s incubator for cool new makeup brands, in September 2017, to smashing success. Known for its industry-distrusting selection of a whopping 40 shades of foundation (the industry norm is a much smaller number that tends to favor lighten skin tones), the collection spawned waiting lists at some cosmetics counters, and is said to have brought in a whopping $100 million in its first 40 days of operation, helping to put Fenty Beauty “on track to beat out blockbuster revenues of Kylie Jenner’s Kylie Beauty [which as of August 2017 had sold a total of $420 million products] and Kim Kardashian’s KKW.”

The songstress and budding lifestyle mogul has also put her well-established stamp on a since-completed collaboration with Puma for a collection of garments and footwear, and most recently, an undergarments line, called Savage, in connection with which Fenty debuted underwear in nude hues for a huge array of skin tones, and boasts one of the more inclusive size selections on the market.

Commenting on the unique partnership early this year, Quartz’s Marc Bain stated, “The celebrity clothing line is a well-worn concept, but a partnership between Rihanna and LVMH would be something else … The reported tie up emphasizes the extraordinary potential LVMH sees in Rihanna, with good reason. Beyond the obvious advantages of her high marketability and her recognized status as one of the most adventurously fashionable stars of her time, Rihanna has repeatedly proved herself as a brand founder able to connect with young shoppers, both through her eye for sellable fashion and her inclusivity.”

As for Rihanna, she said in a statement on Friday, “Designing a line like this with LVMH is an incredibly special moment for us. [LVMH Chairman Bernard] Arnault has given me a unique opportunity to develop a fashion house in the luxury sector, with no artistic limits. I couldn’t imagine a better partner both creatively and business-wise, and I’m ready for the world to see what we have built together.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999905824661255}",neutral,0.9999905824661255,0

May 10 (UPI) -- Rihanna is partnering with LVMH, the world's largest luxury group, on a new fashion label. The French company, Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, announced in a press release Friday the 31-year-old singer and designer will relaunch her fashion line Fenty as a new luxury maison. Advertisement

Fenty will be based in Paris and developed by Rihanna. The brand will feature ready to wear clothing, shoes and accessories, and will debut this spring.

""Designing a line like this with LVMH is an incredibly special moment for us. Mr. Arnault has given me a unique opportunity to develop a fashion house in the luxury sector, with no artistic limits,"" Rihanna said in a statement, referencing LVMH CEO Bernard Arnault.

""I couldn't imagine a better partner both creatively and business-wise, and I'm ready for the world to see what we have built together,"" she added.

Arnault had nothing but praise for Rihanna, who launched her Fenty X Puma clothing line in 2016. Rihanna partnered with LVMH's Kendo division on her Fenty Beauty line the same year.

""Everybody knows Rihanna as a wonderful singer, but through our partnership at Fenty Beauty, I discovered a true entrepreneur, a real CEO and a terrific leader. She naturally finds her full place within LVMH,"" Arnault said.

The New York Times said Rihanna will be the first woman to create an original brand at LVMH and the first woman of color to head an LVMH maison. Rihanna celebrated the news in an Instagram post Friday.

It's Official: Rihanna's New Luxury Fashion Brand Is Coming Soon - WWD,"Fri, 10 May 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3dkLmNvbS9mYXNoaW9uLW5ld3MvZGVzaWduZXItbHV4dXJ5L3JpaGFubmEtbHZtaC1uZXctZmFzaGlvbi1sYWJlbC1sYXVuY2gtZGV0YWlscy1jb25maXJtZWQtMTIwMzEyNTk3MS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Rihanna and LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton have officially confirmed they are going into the fashion business together under the Fenty banner.

The pop star and the French luxury giant issued a brief statement saying the new luxury maison would be based in Paris.

It will be “centered on Rihanna, developed by her, and takes shape with her vision in terms of ready-to-wear, shoes and accessories, including commerciality and communication of the brand.”

The release mentioned the collection would debut for spring 2019, but did not detail the distribution strategy or precise timing.

It is understood the products will be released in the coming weeks, mainly via digital channels. The statement spelled out a web domain — fenty.com — and revealed the logo.

Rihanna pointed to a new Instagram account for the house on her @badgirlriri feed and it amassed more than 65,000 followers by 10 a.m. EST. It has no posts yet.

“Everybody knows Rihanna as a wonderful singer, but through our partnership at Fenty Beauty, I discovered a true entrepreneur, a real ceo and a terrific leader. She naturally finds her full place within LVMH. To support Rihanna to start up the Fenty Maison, we have built a talented and multicultural team supported by the group resources. I am proud that LVMH is leading this venture and wish it will be a great success,” said Bernard Arnault, chairman and chief executive officer of LVMH.

For her part, Rihanna said, “Designing a line like this with LVMH is an incredibly special moment for us. Mr. Arnault has given me a unique opportunity to develop a fashion house in the luxury sector, with no artistic limits. I couldn’t imagine a better partner both creatively and business-wise, and I’m ready for the world to see what we have built together.”

WWD broke the news on Jan. 17 that the high-profile project was in the works, as LVMH had already handpicked a clutch of employees from within, including some from Louis Vuitton and Celine, to work in tandem with Rihanna and some of her key associates. Among them are Veronique Gebel, previously rtw director at Louis Vuitton, according to market sources.

This marks the first time LVMH — whose forte is modernizing legacy brands like Dior, Louis Vuitton, Givenchy, Bulgari and Dom Pérignon — has launched a fashion brand from scratch since it set up a couture house for Christian Lacroix in 1987.

Rihanna boasts more than 70 million followers on Instagram, and is expected to release new music some time this year.

Rihanna’s proximity to LVMH stretches back to at least 2015. After attending shows for Christian Dior, one of Arnault’s most treasured fashion properties, she appeared in “Secret Garden IV,” a campaign and short film shot by Steven Klein inside Versailles. It featured her in Dior sunglasses, carrying the brand’s bags and wearing looks from the Esprit Dior collection.

A year later, she created a range of futuristic sunglasses in collaboration with Dior as part of her brand ambassadorship. Earlier this year, she test drove a pair with her Fenty brand splashed across the temples, dropping a colossal hint about the upcoming project with LVMH.

Rihanna has demonstrated a serious interest in, and influence on, fashion — along with formidable design chops and acute instincts — with her tenure as the creative director of Puma, energizing the German activewear brand with her Fenty by Puma project, and following it up with successful forays into beauty and lingerie — the former with LVMH-controlled Kendo; the latter with California-based TechStyle Fashion Group.

Kendo, which functions as an incubator making products that end up being retailed by LVMH’s Sephora perfumery chain and other outposts, signed on Rihanna in 2016. Her Fenty Beauty products racked up sales north of $100 million in a matter of weeks, and was hailed as a transformative brand.

The brand generated revenues of about 500 million euros last year, LVMH said during a recent conference call.

For LVMH, the Rihanna line signals a further move outside its comfort zone as it continues to diversify its holdings, having recently invested $2.6 billion in luxury travel operator Belmond Ltd., owner of the Venice Simplon-Orient-Express train and hotels including the Copacabana Palace in Rio de Janeiro.

Rihanna’s talent, charisma and beauty have made her a favorite of fashion designers worldwide. The Barbados native has previously modeled for Gucci, Emporio Armani and Balmain.

She made her debut in design in 2013 with British high-street brand River Island, creating a collection of clothing and accessories.

The luxury conglomerate promoted multiple applications of the technology, along with other buzzy innovations like augmented reality and blockchain, at VivaTechnology. The annual technology fair, now in its fourth edition, is Paris' answer to Las Vegas' Consumer Electronics Show, providing a European platform for companies including Richemont, Google, L'Oreal and Facebook to showcase their latest innovations.

On Friday, LVMH gave its Innovation Award to 3DLook, a mobile body-scanning app that uses AI and AR to take body measurements from photos. The idea is to ensure that shoppers buy the right-sized garments, reducing the number of returns for retailers. Founded in 2016, 3DLook already works with big fashion companies including Nike, but has yet to partner with an LVMH brand. The start-up receives a one-year membership to LVMH’s incubator at Station F, a Paris startup campus backed by French billionaire Xavier Niel.

This year’s contenders for the prize were heavy on applications for AI, including Digital Genius, another startup using AI, this time for customer service. Digital Genius was among the five finalists of the prize, whittled down from 900 applications. The venture developed a chatbot to help customer service agents.

""AI is going to affect everything we do,"" LVMH Chief Digital Officer Ian Rogers told BoF.

LVMH also showed off a tool that will use blockchain technology to track goods in its supply chain in order to prove their authenticity. All Louis Vuitton goods will be certified ""in the near future"", and that the technology will also be used for Parfums Christian Dior, said the group. The tool, called ""Aura,"" was developed in partnership with New York-based blockchain software firm ConsenSys using Microsoft technology. Paris-based non-profit Arianee, which boasts executives from LVMH rivals Richemont and Kering in its board, is also taking steps to launch a similar database, with pilots due to roll out this year.

""We will then see how we can develop this technology in other aspects,"" said LVMH Chairman and Chief Executive Bernard Arnault at a press briefing in LVMH's packed booth. ""We are at the beginning of all this; in the testing phase.""

This isn’t the first time LVMH has taken an interest in blockchain. Last year at VivaTech, VeChain, a start-up that develops blockchain information to verify the authenticity of a product, received a special mention during the Innovation Award ceremony.

Arnault noted that e-commerce generated €3.5-to-€4 billion in annual sales in 2018, or about 7.5-to-8.5 percent of the group’s overall revenue. This month marks two years since the launch of 24 Sèvres (recently rebranded as 24S), the group’s long-awaited return to multi-brand fashion e-commerce eight years after the closure of Eluxury.com, which launched in 2000 but suffered from strategic miscalculations.

Though LVMH products sell well on third-party websites, 24 Sèvres has struggled to gain traction. It ranked at No. 1,610 among fashion and lifestyle websites in April, according to Similarweb, compared with No. 38 for Farfetch and No. 154 for Net-a-Porter.

Through its alignment with VivaTech, the luxury conglomerate is attempting to position itself as a technology leader. The conference, organised by LVMH-owned media group Les Echos and advertising group Publicis, is slated to draw over 100,000 visitors and 2,500-to-3,000 startup companies this year.

On Thursday, the opening day, global leaders including French President Emmanuel Macron, Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Alibaba Chairman and Co-Founder Jack Ma made appearances on stage.

France is home to leading luxury giants but has failed to birth many major tech or fashion-tech companies in recent years, with a few exceptions like luxury resale player Vestiaire Collective. French start-ups have raised a record €1.4 billion since the beginning of 2019, up 72 percent from the same period last year.

LVMH was battling for the spotlight with rival Kering, which played a prominent role at the Copenhagen Fashion Summit, announcing stricter animal welfare standards, a pledge to only hire models who are over 18 and the creation of a climate-change coalition backed by Macron.

For now, LVMH said it will not be participating in the climate coalition. Also this week, LVMH partnered with UNESCO to ensure the provenance of its raw materials.

“From what I understand it is an operation regarding fashion. The LVMH group is a bit of a fashion group, but it's a lot more,” Arnault said. “We have more global concern on protection of the environment and sustainability for all our activities. We were the first to create an environment division over 25 years ago, dealing with all these issues in manufacturing and distribution, for example of our Champagnes, perfumes and cosmetics…. We have a more global approach to all of these issues, and we have had for a long time.""

Disclosure: LVMH is part of a group of investors who, together, hold a minority interest in The Business of Fashion. All investors have signed shareholders’ documentation guaranteeing BoF’s complete editorial independence.

It might be time to open a savings account dedicated to Rihanna: on Friday, she announced the launch of a luxury fashion line with LVMH, the conglomerate that’s also home to Dior, Louis Vuitton and Fendi, among many others.

Fenty, set to debut this spring, is the latest of Rihanna’s business ventures, joining her industry-changing cosmetics brand Fenty Beauty and lingerie brand Savage X Fenty, which launched in 2017 and 2018, respectively.

According to a press release, the new luxury house “is centered on Rihanna, developed by her, and takes shape with her vision in terms of ready to wear, shoes and accessories, including commerciality and communication of the brand.”

Rihanna, the New York Times reported, “will become the first woman to create an original brand at LVMH, the first woman of color at the top of an LVMH maison, and her line will be the first new house created by the group since Christian Lacroix in 1987.”

“I couldn’t imagine a better partner both creatively and business-wise, and I’m ready for the world to see what we have built together,” she continued.

Rihanna also shared the new brand’s logo on Instagram, writing: “Big day for the culture. thank you Mr.Arnault for believing in this little girl from the left side of an island, and for giving me the opportunity to grow with you at @LVMH .

“To support Rihanna to start up the Fenty Maison, we have built a talented and multicultural team supported by the Group resources. I am proud that LVMH is leading this venture and wish it will be a great success,” Arnault said.

Rihanna’s Fenty Beauty cosmetics line challenged an industry that often excludes women of color by debuting with 40 foundation shades, later expanded to 50. She wrote on her website: “Fenty Beauty was created for everyone: for women of all shades, personalities, attitudes, cultures, and races. I wanted everyone to feel included.”

Her lingerie line, Savage X Fenty, has also been applauded for offering underwear that matches a range of skin tones and caters to plus-size body types, while the brand’s runway show and ad campaigns have similarly prioritized inclusivity.

The Fenty maison won’t be Rihanna’s first full clothing venture, either. In 2014, she became creative director of Puma, releasing a series of acclaimed Fenty x Puma clothing and footwear collections. Before that, she created three collections for British store River Island.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9994945526123047}",neutral,0.9994945526123047,0
Rihanna to launch a luxury fashion house with LVMH - The CEO Magazine,"Tue, 21 May 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWNlb21hZ2F6aW5lLmNvbS9saWZlc3R5bGUvZmFzaGlvbi9yaWhhbm5hLWx1eHVyeS1mYXNoaW9uLWhvdXNlLWZlbnR5LWx2bWgv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"A force within the music, beauty and fashion industries, bestselling artist Rihanna is launching a high-end fashion brand with the world’s leading luxury group, LVMH.

In turn, Rihanna will become the first black female designer to head a label with LVMH. It will be the first time the French conglomerate has launched a brand from inception since Christian Lacroix in 1987.

Titled Project Loud France, the venture is named in honour of the Barbadian singer’s highly anticipated fifth studio album, Loud.

Spanning men’s and women’s ready-to-wear, athleisure, leather goods, footwear, eyewear and childrenswear, the Fenty Maison is also rumoured to include high-tech products, office supplies, home décor and gardening wares.

The music superstar has already seen massive success with her Fenty Beauty range, which debuted in late 2017 backed by LVMH’s beauty incubator Kendo, and her lingerie line, Savage x Fenty, which celebrated its one year anniversary this month.

Rihanna’s beauty line pioneered diversity by having, at first, 40 shades of foundation to cater to different skin tones, which was later increased to 50. Meanwhile, her fashion label was highly praised for its body-positive casting at New York Fashion Week last year.

According to French filings from December 2018, Project Loud France has already accumulated about €60 million worth of investment split between Rihanna and the luxury conglomerate.

Staff from Louis Vuitton and Celine have reportedly already been hired to work with Rihanna, with LVMH’s Chief Strategy Officer Jean-Baptiste Voisin appointed as President of Project Loud France.

Now with 70.9 million Instagram followers, Rihanna was crowned ‘Most marketable celebrity’ by NDP Group in 2016. The market research company discovered that the singer’s followers would be 3.7 times more likely to buy something seen on her account than that of other celebrities.

A launch date for Project Loud France has not yet been revealed, but you can bet the new venture will be as big a hit as Rihanna’s two businesses to date.

As the world’s largest luxury group, LVMH is home to more than 70 distinguished fashion houses including Louis Vuitton, Christian Dior, Fendi, Givenchy and Marc Jacobs.

Over the years, the family-run conglomerate has developed one of the best platforms in the world in terms of design, marketing, distribution and supply chain – all while upholding its identity, heritage and expertise.

In an announcement leaked back in January, but officially released on Friday, the singer revealed that her brand Fenty has partnered with luxury conglomerate LVMH, which owns Givenchy and Dior, among others. She’ll show her first collection later this month in Paris.

“Designing a line like this with LVMH is an incredibly special moment for us,” Rihanna said in the statement. “Mr. Arnault has given me a unique opportunity to develop a fashion house in the luxury sector, with no artistic limits,” she said, referencing Bernard Arnault, LVMH chairman. “I couldn’t imagine a better partner both creatively and business-wise, and I’m ready for the world to see what we have built together.”

Rihanna will have a maison. She will make jewelry and ready-to-wear and shoes and sunglasses. “Everybody knows Rihanna as a wonderful singer, but through our partnership at Fenty Beauty, I discovered a true entrepreneur, a real C.E.O., and a terrific leader,” Arnault added in the statement. (LVMH has been the Fenty Beauty brand’s partner since 2017.)

“She naturally finds her full place within LVMH,” he added. “To support Rihanna to start up the Fenty Maison, we have built a talented and multicultural team supported by the group resources. I am proud that LVMH is leading this venture and wish it will be a great success.”

Though she’s a proven seller—what with the success of Fenty Beauty, her lingerie line Savage x Fenty, and her sportswear Fenty line, a Puma collaboration (which was owned by LVMH‘s major competitor Kering)—the stakes are still high. She is the first black woman to head a luxury label at the company, and also only the second brand created in house at LVMH. And as Vanessa Friedman at The New York Times pointed out, “LVMH’s first foray into original couture, Lacroix, did not end too well; it sold the brand in 2005, and the name is now largely associated with an unrelated sparkling water.”

Now, she has a major deal with LVMH for a ""Fenty"" fashion line.

On Friday, the multi-hyphenate star and businesswoman posted a series of photos on Instagram of the fashion line's logo along with a caption that expressed her gratitude for the huge opportunity.

""Thank you Mr. Arnault for believing in this little girl from the left side of an island, and for giving me the opportunity to grow with you at @LVMH,"" she said. ""This is proof nothing is impossible. Glory be to God.""

Bernard Arnault, president and CEO of LVMH, said in a statement: ""Everyone knows Rihanna as a wonderful singer, but through our partnership at Fenty Beauty, I have discovered a true entrepreneur, a true CEO, and a great leader.""

This new partnership also makes Rihanna the first woman of color at the top of an LVMH maison, the first new house created by the group since Christian Lacroix in 1987 and the first woman to create an original brand with the company.

The new Fenty fashion label will join the ranks of well-known design houses such as Fendi, Dior and Givenchy.

There haven't been any images released of the new label yet, but the logo includes the word ""Fenty"" in all caps with a backward N. The line will also be based in Paris and include ready-to-wear clothing, shoes and accessories.

""Designing a line like this with LVMH is an incredibly special moment for us,"" Rihanna said in a press release, according to Vogue.

NEW YORK (AP) — Rihanna certified her status as a cultural fashion icon with her groundbreaking new deal with LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, the world's largest luxury group.

The pop star, born Robyn Rihanna Fenty, announced Friday that she will debut a line called Fenty this spring through LVMH. Her luxury house will be based in Paris.

The 31-year-old singer becomes the first person since 1987 to launch a new house with LVMH (the last person was Christian LaCroix). Rihanna is also reportedly the first woman to create an original brand at LVMH and the first woman of color at the top of an LVMH maison.

""Designing a line like this with LVMH is an incredibly special moment for us,"" Rihanna said in a statement. She added that Bernard Arnault, the chairman and CEO of LVMH, ""has given me a unique opportunity to develop a fashion house in the luxury sector, with no artistic limits. I couldn't imagine a better partner both creatively and business-wise, and I'm ready for the world to see what we have built together.""

LVMH's leather and goods division includes Louis Vuitton, Christian Dior Couture, Celine, Kenzo, Givenchy, Fendi, Marc Jacobs and more, while its wine and spirits includes Moët & Chandon and Dom Pérignon. The company has also backed Rihanna's ultra-successful cosmetics brand, Fenty Beauty.

Arnault said ""everybody knows Rihanna as a wonderful singer, but through our partnership at Fenty Beauty, I discovered a true entrepreneur, a real CEO and a terrific leader.""

""She naturally finds her full place within LVMH,"" he continued. ""I am proud that LVMH is leading this venture and wish it will be a great success.""

Fashion has been synonymous with Rihanna's name since the Grammy-winning superstar launched her music career in 2005. She has collaborated with brands like Armani, Puma, Dior and more to launch products and lines, and she debuted her lingerie line, Savage X Fenty, last year. Her Fenty Beauty collection disrupted the beauty industry when it launched in 2017, offering 40 foundation shades and bringing in more than $500 million by the end of last year. The success of it forced other cosmetic brands to be more inclusive and launch more foundation color shades, while Fenty even extended to 50 shades.

A release date for Rihanna's new Fenty line with LVMH was not announced, but a website where consumers can eventually purchase the line launched Friday. The new line ""is centered on Rihanna, developed by her, and takes shape with her vision in terms of ready to wear, shoes and accessories, including commerciality and communication of the brand,"" according to a press release.

""Celebrity fashion brands have been around a long time and led by singers, but in the past they've tended to be done via licensing, wholesale distribution and often more with mass retailers or department stores. What's different about this Rihanna project is her partner, which is the world's largest luxury group, which has expertise across a range of leather goods, perfumes, fashion, beauty — so it really raises the bar for celebrity-led fashion brands,"" Miles Socha, editor-in-chief of WDD, said in an interview with The Associated Press.

Rihanna, a native of Barbados, expressed her excitement about the epic new deal in an Instagram post Friday.

""Big day for the culture,"" she wrote. ""Thank you Mr. Arnault for believing in this little girl from the left side of an island, and for giving me the opportunity to grow with you at @LVMH. This is proof that nothing is impossible. Glory be to God.""

Cheat Sheet: How LVMH and Kering are going after Gen Z - Glossy,"Mon, 13 May 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmdsb3NzeS5jby9mYXNoaW9uL2NoZWF0LXNoZWV0LWhvdy1sdm1oLWFuZC1rZXJpbmctYXJlLWdvaW5nLWFmdGVyLWdlbi16L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"On Friday, LVMH confirmed the longstanding rumor that it will be launching within weeks a bona fide luxury fashion brand headed by Rihanna, called Fenty. The new brand builds on Rihanna’s previous work on Fenty Beauty and Savage x Fenty, her lingerie line. It will be sold mainly through digital channels and priced more affordably than LVMH’s other brands.

Given Fenty Beauty’s popularity among young millennials and Gen Z, it seems LVMH is going after the same lucrative young audience with this launch. Here’s how LVMH’s attempts to woo the younger generation stack up to major competitor Kering.

Gen Z performance

-LVMH’s big bet on Rihanna’s Fenty brand has already paid dividends with younger consumers. After Fenty Beauty first launched in 2017 through LVMH’s Kendo brand incubator,Fenty Beauty did a reported $100 million in sales in the first 40 days. After it launched in Sephora, the retailer saw a spike in sales among shoppers ages 18 to 44.

-The group also saw a 16% increase in sales after Virgil Abloh was appointed to creative director of Louis Vuitton. At the time, Abloh said his goal was “to articulate [Louis Vuitton’s] heritage in a new, refreshing way to a younger consumer.”

-Gucci, Kering’s prize brand, saw 55% of its sales in 2017 come from consumers under 35, something that creative director Alessandro Michele has prioritized, even going so far as to consult with a board of people under 30 to make sure the brand is nailing what young consumers want.

The big numbers

-Kering’s total revenue in 2018 was around $15.5 billion, the majority of which came from Gucci. Of Gucci’s nearly $9 billion in revenue, more than 60% came from consumers under 35.

-In 2018, LVMH’s total revenue was close to $53 billion.

Diversity

-According to McKinsey, Gen Z and millennials combined make up around $350 billion worth of spending power. In the same report, 9 out of 10 Gen Z consumers said they would drop a brand that did not live up to their ethical standards.

-Both of Rihanna’s previous Fenty ventures in beauty and lingerie have made diversity, whether that’s skin tone or sizing, a major focus. While it’s hard to quantify how much the push toward diversity has translated into the brand’s popularity, after the launch of Fenty, competitors like Covergirl and Ulta’s Flesh both rolled out their own expanded-skin-tone-range lines.

-While Kering is one of the leaders in making luxury fashion more sustainable, the group has had more trouble with diversity and race. After some notable gaffes, like a balaclava that evoked imagery of blackface, the company announced four major internal diversity efforts to improve in that area.

E-commerce

-Kering signaled that e-commerce would be a major strategy going forward, after it took online sales in-house at the end of last year, ending its ongoing partnership with Yoox Net-a-Porter. Gucci plans, without a specific timeline, to triple online sales to make up 10% of its overall revenue.

-LVMH has been far more reluctant when it comes to selling online. While the company has made some investments, like launching online store 24 Sèvres in late 2017, CEO Bernard Arnault expressed strong reservations about the potential of diluting its brands by going too heavy on online sales.

Final word

Tiffany Hogan, senior analyst at Kantar Consulting: “Rihanna’s new brand is a different play than what LVMH usually goes into. It’s clear they’re going for a younger audience. It will be most interesting to see how the price point plays out, with LVMH going for something a little more affordable.”

Kayla Marci, market analyst at Edited: “Due to the success of Fenty Beauty and Savage x Fenty, we can expect Rihanna to also disrupt the luxury market. Rihanna’s delivered on the necessity for inclusive sizing through lingerie, and there’s no doubt she’ll do the same within the luxury market — especially when plus size only makes up 0.6% of luxury products in the U.K. and the U.S.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9994919300079346}",neutral,0.9994919300079346,0

The label - which joins a roster of 70 brands at the world's biggest luxury player, including Louis Vuitton and Moet & Chandon champagne - will be called Fenty, after the singer's full name, Robyn Rihanna Fenty.



LVMH said on Friday the launch was ""fast approaching"" and due in spring 2019.

It marks a rare move by the acquisitive Paris-based group to set up a new brand from scratch, and follows the creation of Fenty Beauty with Rihanna in September 2017, which rapidly became a sales hit.



The singer, 31, has become known for her often bold fashion statements at red carpet events and is followed almost as much for her style as her music.



Rihanna has already collaborated with other labels such as shoemaker Manolo Blahnik and has a lingerie range called Savage X Fenty.



Building a high-end brand with LVMH, which also owns storied couture houses Christian Dior and Givenchy, propels the singer's fashion ventures onto another level, however, with the might of a cash-rich industry leader behind her.



LVMH's billionaire boss Bernard Arnault said in a statement the group would support her with a team and resources, though it did not give any financial details.



Rihanna said she had been given ""a unique opportunity to develop a fashion house in the luxury sector, with no artistic limits.""



The collaboration with Rihanna introduces an edgier note in LVMH's portfolio, at a time when luxury groups are vying to attract younger shoppers and moving into less familiar areas such as streetwear.



They are also increasingly promoting themselves on social media, a medium which Rihanna has used to great effect, amassing 70.5 million followers under her Instagram handle ""badgalriri"".



Fenty Beauty had reached nearly 500 million euros ($562 million) in sales by the end of 2018, LVMH said in January. ($1 = 0.8896 euros)

Encompassing ready-to-wear, accessories and shoes, Fenty is expected to see Rihanna continue the luxury sportswear she showed under previous label Fenty x Puma, albeit with the savoir faire of the artisans available to her as part of LVMH. “Designing a line like this with LVMH is an incredibly special moment for us,” she said this morning in a statement. “Mr. Arnault has given me a unique opportunity to develop a fashion house in the luxury sector, with no artistic limits.

LVMH’s wine and spirits portfolio includes Champagnes like Dom Perignon and Ruinart, as well as Hennessy Cognac. Other acquisitions have included top-shelf makers of Bordeaux and Burgundy like the Clos des Lambrays estate whose grand cru bottles can retail north of US$260. Now rising demand for rosé – which has lately become emblematic of South-of-France savoir vivre and a staple for daytime summer parties – has seen the French luxury conglomerate buy an estate whose bottles still retail for less than US$15.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999971389770508}",neutral,0.9999971389770508,0

The deal makes the singer, whose full name is Robyn Rihanna Fenty, the first black female to head up a fashion house at the company, which owns a sprawling portfolio of top brands, ranging from fashion labels Givenchy, Dior and Celine to the Dom Pérignon and Moët & Chandon champagnes and Hublot and TAG Heuer watches.

The new venture will take Rihanna’s surname Fenty, mirroring her already established Fenty Beauty line, which is also controlled by LVMH.

The new fashion label will debut within weeks, selling ready-to-wear clothes, shoes and accessories and will be based in Paris, prompting speculation that it will become a feature of the official Paris fashion week schedule.

“Everybody knows Rihanna as a wonderful singer, but through our partnership at Fenty Beauty, I discovered a true entrepreneur, a real CEO and a terrific leader,” said Bernard Arnault, the billionaire chairman and chief executive of LVMH.

“To support Rihanna to start up the Fenty Maison, we have built a talented and multicultural team supported by the group resources,” he said.

Rihanna said: “Designing a line like this with LVMH is an incredibly special moment for us. Mr Arnault has given me a unique opportunity to develop a fashion house in the luxury sector, with no artistic limits. I couldn’t imagine a better partner both creatively and business-wise, and I’m ready for the world to see what we have built together.

The French group has increasingly exploited collaborations with celebrities as well as streetwear designers to attract young customers of luxury goods. Rihanna is a powerful influencer on social media, having amassed 70.5 million followers under her Instagram handle “badgalriri”.

“Thank you Mr Arnault for believing in this little girl from the left side of an island,” Rihanna said on Twitter.

Most celebrity collaborations have been restricted to limited editions, and LVMH is hoping to steal a march on peers by taking its pairing with the 31-year-old Barbadian to another level as a full-blown fashion label.

It is the first label LVMH has created since Christian Lacroix’s eponymous brand launched in 1987. That brand, which always struggled to make a profit, was sold in 2005.

The launch of Rihanna’s brand could go some way to answering calls for more diversity among fashion’s leaders. Last year, she became the first black woman to be on the key September cover of British Vogue, traditionally the largest and most important edition of the magazine.

Editor-in-chief, Edward Enninful, described her then as a “fearless music-industry icon and businesswoman”.

”When it comes to that potent mix of fashion and celebrity, nobody does it quite like her,” he said.

Known for her bold fashion statements at red carpet events, Rihanna is followed almost as much for her style as her music, and had already worked with other labels including sportswear brand Puma on collections under the Fenty name.

The Fenty Beauty range, which already has a massive following among young female shoppers, went on sale in Boots in the UK on Friday. Celebrity beauty brands have the potential to be extremely lucrative. A range launched by Kylie Jenner in 2015 has become so successful that the youngest member of the Kardashian-Jenner TV family has become the world’s youngest billionaire at the age of just 21.

Rihanna has also collaborated with shoemaker Manolo Blahnik and has a lingerie range called Savage X Fenty.

Fenty Beauty, launched under LVMH’s umbrella in September 2017, had reached nearly €500m (£430m) in sales by the end of 2018. Analysts attribute its success to an offering that included a wide range of skin tones, catering to a more diverse audience than many makeup brands historically had.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9997417330741882}",neutral,0.9997417330741882,0
Rihanna's Fenty/LVMH Deal Will Impact Hollywood Branding Future - WWD,"Mon, 13 May 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vd3dkLmNvbS9mZWF0dXJlL3JpaGFubmEtbHZtaC1kZWFsLWNlbGVicml0eS1icmFuZGluZy1pbXBhY3QtMTIwMzEyODY0My_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"RiRi is poised to be the next LV of lust-worthy monograms.

Friday’s announcement that LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton will launch a new Paris-based Fenty maison “centered on Rihanna, developed by her, and taking shape with her vision in terms of ready-to-wear, shoes and accessories, including commerciality and communication of the brand” marks the first time the luxury conglomerate has launched a fashion brand from scratch since it set a couture house for Christian Lacroix in 1987. Only this time, it’s with a celebrity — who will also be the first black woman to head an LVMH brand — and the development could change the future of Hollywood dealmaking in the fashion space.

“Instead of having celebrity faces like Natalie Portman at Dior or Nicole Kidman at Chanel, it’s now about how a celebrity can own a brand,” said Stacy Jones, chief executive officer of entertainment marketing firm Hollywood Branded Inc., who credits the groundbreaking LVMH deal on Rihanna’s demonstrated success as a singer, actress and marketer who is able to move Fenty beauty products with an Instagram post. She also touted the legacy of the Kardashians and celebrity-businessmen including George Clooney, whose tequila company Casamigos sold for $1 billion last year (which in turn sparked a slew of other actors, including Ryan Reynolds, jumping into the alcohol sector).

“In the past, celebs have become brand ambassadors, and they have had partnerships that involved this many days of PR, event attendances, this many photo shoots, video shoots and usage rights. The celeb didn’t really participate in the creative process,” said Jones. “But with the advent of social media, people started seeing they could take more control, because they could start seeing the impact they were having on the brand.

“The Kardashians have created a global monopoly of beauty lines, and have realized how much they can make if they have ownership. Rihanna is the same model,” she added. “She wants to own something and partnering with a leading luxury brand offers a massive opportunity to work across categories.”

Proving the power of the pop star’s following, only hours after LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton officially confirmed the establishment of her new Paris-based fashion house, more than 150,000 joined the brand’s Instagram account, which has no posts yet. As of Sunday afternoon, the following swelled to 240,000.

To be sure, the project significantly raises the bar for celebrity-led fashion brands, given LVMH’s mighty finances, access to prime retail space, expertise across an array of luxury goods, and penchant for directly controlling production and distribution.

And Rihanna gives LVMH access to a new demographic, said Jones. “Luxury conglomerates are having major issues reaching Millennials…This new luxury brand will allow them to open the floodgates to Millennial customers.”

But it’s not every talent who can command such a deal, which some insiders are comparing to Beyoncé’s recently revealed partnership with Adidas, which allows her to retain full ownership and control of her Ivy Park brand, which will be relaunched by the athletic wear giant.

“This paves the way for other people, sure,” said Victoria Brynner, founder of L.A.-based consultancy Stardust Brands, which connects fashion and luxury brands with talent. “But people who warrant a big investment from a brand like LVMH, there are not hundreds of them. It has to be someone who has shown their sustainability. Someone like Selena Gomez, she did a capsule with Coach and investors see that she has 100 million Instagram followers. But is it in her wheelhouse to have a music career and focus on a full brand? Rihanna has shown her capability to do it all with beauty and her capsule [fashion] collections and she has music, and acts. It’s the house with the remodeled kitchen and bathrooms, it has everything in it and it’s less risky.”

Lady Gaga is another multi-talent whose influence is big enough to translate into a brand in the the fashion space, insiders suggest, though future deals will depend on the success of the Rihanna one.

“These are deals for the most influential women in the world, and the market is just opening up to realize the value of partnering with women who have more influence than the brands themselves do,” said Christian Carino, a talent agent at Creative Artists Agency, which represents Beyoncé, Johnny Depp and Margot Robbie, among others. “This level of partnership requires brands to give up control they normally wouldn’t give up to anyone. You’re not telling these women what to do, which is amazing.”

According to the LVMH announcement, the new Fenty collection will debut for spring 2019. It is understood the products will become available for sale later this month, mainly via digital channels. The statement included a web domain — www.fenty.com — and revealed a two-part logo with Fenty spelled out in a maze-like block or with with a backwards N.

On her @Badgirlriri Instagram account Friday, the singer ran a photo of herself next to the logo, declaring it “a big day for the culture. Thank you Mr. Arnault for believing in this little girl from the left side of an island, and for giving me this opportunity to grow with you at @LVMH. This is proof that nothing is impossible. Glory be to God.”

She also pointed out that she is the first woman of color at the helm of an LVMH maison.

Rihanna boasts more than 70 million followers on Instagram, and is expected to release new music some time this year. A Hollywood multihyphenate, she is also an actress, who appeared in last year’s “Ocean’s Eight.”

“Everybody knows Rihanna as a wonderful singer, but through our partnership at Fenty Beauty, I discovered a true entrepreneur, a real ceo and a terrific leader. She naturally finds her full place within LVMH. To support Rihanna to start up the Fenty Maison, we have built a talented and multicultural team supported by the group resources. I am proud that LVMH is leading this venture and wish it will be a great success,” said Bernard Arnault, chairman and chief executive officer of LVMH.

For her part, Rihanna said, “Designing a line like this with LVMH is an incredibly special moment for us. Mr. Arnault has given me a unique opportunity to develop a fashion house in the luxury sector, with no artistic limits. I couldn’t imagine a better partner both creatively and business-wise, and I’m ready for the world to see what we have built together.”

Sources told WWD Rihanna has been extremely hands-on with the new Fenty project, working closely with teams in London and in Paris.

WWD broke the news on Jan. 17 that the high-profile project was in the works, as LVMH had already hand-picked a clutch of employees from within, including some from Louis Vuitton and Celine, to work in tandem with Rihanna and some of her key associates. Among them are Veronique Gebel, previously ready-to-wear director at Louis Vuitton, according to market sources.

Already, the high-profile project is a quantum leap from celebrity fashion forays of yore, typically done via licensing, dependent on wholesale and positioned in mass channels.

Filings with the commercial court in Paris suggest substantial initial investments in the Fenty Maison, registered under the company name Loud. It details equity of 60 million euros. For comparison’s sake, that compares to equity of 10 million for Patou, the heritage fashion house LVMH acquired and is relaunching with former Nina Ricci designer Guillaume Henry.

Court documents dated at the end of 2018 list LVMH’s chief strategy officer and executive board member Jean-Baptiste Voisin as president of Loud, a position that is valid for three years. According to sources, the final management configuration has yet to be decided.

Company statutes suggest a broad range of possible merchandise for the new label, with a detailed list including clothing and accessories for men, women and children, as well as tableware, objects for the house and garden, as well as sports and high-tech goods, jewelry and watches made of precious metals.

Rihanna’s relationship with LVMH stretches back to at least 2015. After attending shows for Christian Dior, one of Arnault’s most treasured fashion properties, she appeared in “Secret Garden IV,” a campaign and short film shot by Steven Klein inside Versailles. It featured her in Dior sunglasses, carrying the brand’s bags and wearing looks from the Esprit Dior collection.

A year later, she created a range of futuristic sunglasses in collaboration with Dior as part of her brand ambassadorship. Earlier this year, she test-drove a pair with her Fenty brand splashed across the temples, dropping a colossal hint about the upcoming project with LVMH.

Rihanna has demonstrated a serious interest in, and influence on, fashion — along with formidable design chops and acute instincts — with her tenure as the creative director of Puma, energizing the German activewear brand with her Fenty by Puma project, and following it up with successful forays into beauty and lingerie — the former with LVMH-controlled Kendo; the latter with California-based TechStyle Fashion Group.

Kendo, which functions as an incubator making products that end up being retailed by LVMH’s Sephora beauty chain and other outposts, signed Rihanna in 2016. Racking up sales north of $100 million in a matter of weeks, Fenty Beauty was hailed as a transformative brand. It generated revenues of about 500 million euros last year, LVMH said during a recent conference call.

Rihanna’s talent, charisma and beauty have made her a favorite of fashion designers worldwide. The Barbados native has previously modeled for Gucci, Emporio Armani and Balmain, and has made Internet-breaking red carpet appearances in Adam Selman’s nearly nude crystal dress at the 2014 CFDA awards, in an egg-yolk colored Guo Pei cape at the 2015 Met Gala, and a daring Comme des Garçons look at the 2017 Met Gala, always with the guidance of longtime stylist Mel Ottenberg.

Through collaborations, she has already worked across several fashion categories. In 2011, Rihanna teamed with Emporio Armani Underwear and Armani Jeans to create a capsule collection of T-shirts, biker jackets, denim and lingerie. In 2013, she presented her first women’s collection for British high-street retailer River Island, collaborating with American designer Selman. “Launching at London Fashion Week is a dream come true for me,” she told WWD at the time. In 2017, she collaborated with Chopard on a luxury jewelry collection she flaunted on red carpets around the world.

For LVMH — whose forte is modernizing legacy brands like Dior, Louis Vuitton, Givenchy, Bulgari and Dom Pérignon — the Rihanna line signals a further move outside its comfort zone as it continues to diversify its holdings. It recently invested $2.6 billion in luxury travel operator Belmond Ltd., owner of the Venice Simplon-Orient-Express train and hotels including the Copacabana Palace in Rio de Janeiro.

Fenty marks the first new fashion house created under the LVMH umbrella since Christian Lacroix launched in 1987. Its arrival also means Rihanna will be the first woman to create an original brand at LVMH and the first woman of color to run a fashion house at LVMH.

“Designing a line like this with LVMH is an incredibly special moment for us,” Rihanna said in a statement. “[LVMH Chairman] Mr. [Bernard] Arnault has given me a unique opportunity to develop a fashion house in the luxury sector, with no artistic limits.

Fenty will be based in Paris and is set to launch its first line of ready-to-wear clothes, shoes and accessories this spring, though an exact date has yet to be announced. In 2017, Rihanna partnered with LVMH to launch her cosmetics line, Fenty Beauty.

Rihanna’s foray into fashion began when she founded Fenty in 2016 as part of an agreement with Puma. The line debuted at New York Fashion Week before moving to Paris and earning positive reviews. Originally, Fenty focused on athleisure and chic streetwear (Riahnna described the clothes as what “Marie Antoinette would wear if she was going to the gym”), while in 2018 Rihanna launched a new lingerie line with Savage x Fenty.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9998466968536377}",neutral,0.9998466968536377,0
LVMH Takes Majority Stake in Repossi | BoF - The Business of Fashion,"Wed, 22 May 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzb2ZmYXNoaW9uLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy9uZXdzLWFuYWx5c2lzL2x2bWgtdGFrZXMtbWFqb3JpdHktc3Rha2UtaW4tcmVwb3NzaS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS, France — LVMH is now the majority owner of yet another fine jewellery maison.

The French luxury conglomerate quietly upped its stake in 99-year-old Italian brand Repossi to 69 percent in April 2018, BoF has learned. The group first took a 42 percent interest in the brand in November 2015, according to a filing.

Since the transaction, LVMH has helped develop Repossi’s retail network, opening shop-in-shops in department stores in Dubai, London and Doha, with New York and Tokyo on deck this year. The brand also opened a shop at the Peninsula Hotel in Hong Kong.

“The goal is to finance the brand’s international expansion,"" Repossi Chief Executive Benjamin Comar said in an exclusive interview with BoF.

Founded in Turin, Italy, in 1920 by Constantino Repossi, the brand has flagship stores in Paris and Monte Carlo. Gaia Repossi, the fourth-generation heir, took the reins as artistic and creative director in 2007 at the age of 21. Under her leadership, Repossi has emerged as an important player in the market for fashion-led fine jewellery, with bestselling pieces including ear cuffs and their serti sur vide ring.

Hard luxury remains a relatively small piece of LVMH's portfolio, with watches and jewellery contributing $4.1 billion in sales last year, about 9 percent of the group's total revenue. The giant in the space is Richemont, which owns Cartier, Van Cleef & Arpels and other brands.

However, the market for hard luxury is growing fast, particularly in Asia and among younger customers. Both LVMH and rival Kering have invested in jewellery and watch brands in recent years. Along with Repossi, it also owns Bulgari, which the group acquired for $5.2 billion in 2011, as well as Chaumet and Fred. Gucci is launching a high-jewellery line in July, with Kering Chief Executive François-Henri Pinault describing the market as ""buoyant"" earlier this year.

Jewellery is “one of the most promising categories within luxury goods, given its projected growth and still relatively low penetration of branded products,” said Luca Solca, managing director of luxury goods at Sanford C. Bernstein Schweiz.

Disclosure: LVMH is part of a group of investors who, together, hold a minority interest in The Business of Fashion. All investors have signed shareholders’ documentation guaranteeing BoF’s complete editorial independence.

4 Reasons LVMH Is a Great Defensive Stock for a Trade War - The Motley Fool,"Thu, 16 May 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDE5LzA1LzE2L3JlYXNvbnMtbHZtaC1ncmVhdC1kZWZlbnNpdmUtc3RvY2stZm9yLXRyYWRlLXdhci5hc3B40gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Affluent consumers will keep buying Louis Vuitton bags and drinking Hennessy -- regardless of how the U.S.-China trade war plays out.

The trade war between the United States and China escalated last week after President Trump hiked tariffs from 10% to 25% on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods. The announcement caught many companies and investors by surprise since earlier reports indicated that a trade deal had nearly been reached.

China retaliated by raising tariffs up to 25% on $60 billion in U.S. goods. That double whammy of bad news sparked a marketwide sell-off as investors scrambled toward defensive stocks that aren't dependent on trade between the U.S. and China.

As the trade war rages, one stock to consider is LVMH Moet Hennessy L.V. (LVMUY -1.91%), the biggest luxury-goods company in the world. Here are four key reasons LVMH is a great defensive stock to own as the U.S. and China work to settle their differences.

1. It won't be caught in the crossfire

LVMH produces some of its products in China, but the company is based in Paris and Europe isn't engaged in a trade war with China. The U.S. is threatening to hike tariffs on a wide variety of European goods, but none of LVMH's core products are included on that list.

Therefore, LVMH can sell its products in the U.S. and China without worrying too much about the escalating trade war. In 2018, LVMH generated 24% of its sales in the U.S. (excluding Hawaii) and 29% from Asia (excluding Japan). Its organic sales in the U.S. rose 8% for the full year, as its organic sales in Asia (excluding Japan) climbed 15%.

2. High-end luxury is recession-proof

The bears might argue that the aftershocks of the trade war could cause recessions and throttle consumer spending in the U.S., China, and other markets.

That's certainly true, but high-end luxury companies like LVMH generally thrive during recessions, since more affluent customers struggle less during economic downturns. Here's how it fared during 2008-2010, the worst years of the financial crisis:

Year 2008 2009 2010 Organic sales growth 7% (4%) 13%

The Great Recession barely dented LVMH's growth, and the company recovered much faster than other businesses. LVMH also never marks down its merchandise -- it famously destroys its unsold inventories to prevent the products from being sold at discounts that might cheapen its brands.

3. A well-diversified portfolio across multiple markets

LVMH owns a portfolio of 70 high-end brands across five business segments -- fashion and leather goods, selective retailing, perfumes and cosmetics, wines and spirits, and watches and jewelry. Here's how those core businesses fared last year.

Segment Percentage of Revenue (2018) Year-Over-Year Growth* Fashion and leather 39% 15% Selective retailing and other 28% 6% Perfumes and cosmetics 13% 14% Wines and spirits 11% 5% Watches and jewelry 9% 12%

The growth of LVMH's fashion and leather unit is impressive relative to ""affordable"" luxury rivals like Tapestry and Capri Holdings, which are expected to generate 3% and 11% sales growth this year, respectively.

Furthermore, LVMH's operating margins expanded across all five business segments in 2018, which indicates that its brands still have tremendous pricing power.

4. Buybacks and dividends

LVMH might not seem cheap at 27 times earnings, especially when Tapestry, Capri, and other luxury stocks trade at lower valuations. However, it pays a decent forward dividend yield of 2.3% and regularly raises that payout and repurchases its stock.

LVMH's free cash flow rose 16%, to 5.5 billion euros ($6.2 billion) last year. Within that total, it spent about 3 billion euros on dividends and 800 million euros on buybacks. It also hiked its annual dividend 20%, to six euros ($6.73) per share, and it's raised that dividend annually at an average rate of 14% over the past five years.

The key takeaway

LVMH's stock probably won't take off anytime soon, but it's well insulated from trade tensions, has a recession-proof business model, and spends most of its free cash flow on boosting shareholder value. That makes it a solid long-term play in my book, regardless of what happens between the U.S. and China.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.6049310564994812}",neutral,0.6049310564994812,0

Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton LVMH, the parent company of Dior, Givenchy and Fendi, may think so. Today it announced that it has closed a deal to back her new Paris-based Fenty fashion brand, making her the first female designer of color at the largest luxury conglomerate in the world and marking the first brand launch by LVMH since Christian Lacroix in 1987.

Rumors of a forthcoming Fenty fashion line were first reported from anonymous sources by WWD in January after Rihanna was photographed on the street in Manhattan wearing a pair of visor-like Fenty-branded sunglasses, hinting at what was to come.

The new Fenty label will present its first collection of ready-to-wear, shoes, jewelry, sunglasses and other accessories in Paris on May 24.

“Designing a line like this with LVMH is an incredibly special moment for us,” Robyn Rihanna Fenty said in an LVMH press statement. “Mr. [Bernard] Arnault has given me a unique opportunity to develop a fashion house in the luxury sector, with no artistic limits. I couldn’t imagine a better partner both creatively and business-wise, and I’m ready for the world to see what we have built together.”

Arnault, chairman and CEO of LVMH, said, “Everybody knows Rihanna as a wonderful singer, but through our partnership at Fenty Beauty, I discovered a true entrepreneur, a real CEO and a terrific leader. She naturally finds her full place within LVMH. To support Rihanna to start up the Fenty Maison, we have built a talented and multicultural team supported by the Group resources.”

The move is particularly significant since the pop star has no fashion design training per se. But she does have plenty of hands-on experience. Rihanna has created capsule collections for British fashion retailer River Island, served as the creative director of Puma from 2014 through 2018 and, last May, she debuted a Savage x Fenty size-inclusive line of lingerie with El Segundo-based TechStyle Fashion Group. Of course, in 2017 she also launched the game-changing LVMH-backed Fenty Beauty line, which set a precedent with 40 shades of foundation (since expanded to 50) to match a variety of diverse skin tones.

The combination of Fenty and LVMH may be the clearest expression yet of how celebrity and social media have redefined the power balance between culture and consumption, changing the way brands of all kinds relate to their audience. Rihanna’s immense global influence and large social media following (including 70.5 million followers on Instagram and 90.8 million on Twitter) were clearly a huge draw for the luxury conglomerate, which has largely made a name for reinventing well-known heritage fashion brands.

The store will stay open through June 2, with the digital shop going live on Wednesday, May 29. There’s speculation that the singer will return to greet fans at the tomorrow’s official opening. LVMH announced the partnership earlier this month and the first campaign video was unveiled on Monday.

But these lucky shoppers weren’t the first to get their hands on Rihanna’s new line. The newly-formed LVMH brand, in a series of firsts, hosted an intimate pre-shopping and cocktail event the day before. (Such firsts for both the French luxury goods conglomerate and Rihanna include being the first newly formed house since Christian Lacroix in 1987 and the first female and woman of color to create a new LVMH brand.)

LVMH and Rihanna’s friends, family and a slew of new colleagues such as LVMH chairman and chief executive Bernard Arnault along with his children (and fellow LVMH execs) Delphine and Antoine Arnault, Dior creative director Maria Grazia Chiuri, Balmain creative director Olivier Rousteing, fashion designer Simon Porte Jacquemus and British Vogue editor in chief Edward Enninful toured the shop on May 22, when the singer-turned-designer was on hand to greet her fans, old and new. Enninful was among the first to make a purchase, posting a black leather and khaki anorak from the technically women’s collection whose size offering adds a genderless aspect to the line.

The newly anointed Fenty CEO and artistic director was beaming with pride over the partnership. “It’s nothing that I could dream up,” said Rihanna in an official video released by LVMH. “To be respected as a designer of a luxury brand and Bernard Arnault telling me he knows I am a leader and can do this, I took it on because he believed in me.” She noted that she is still reveling in the design process, a collaboration with Fenty style director Jahleel Weaver. “It’s a meticulous process. You don’t get bored when deciding what a new collection can be…LVMH is a monster of a machine, you can only expect the best.”

Explaining a bit about the Fenty Maison woman, Rihanna said it was someone multifaceted. “I think women are moody in general and dress according to that mood. I’m like that and the clothes reflect that,” she said. But she clarified that it’s not just for those biologically female: “I don’t want people to conform to one area to shop in. Whoever comes in and likes it should buy — it’s for any gender.”

Rousteing, a friend of Rihanna’s, proudly acknowledged the historical moment on another LVMH video. “She is a revolutionary and she will revolutionize Paris fashion with this incredible collection and approach,” he said. “It’s what is happening today; we need women like her who speak about diversity and freedom.”

The offerings, now on display in the Marais show space at Rue de Turenne, which was transformed into a Fenty Maison concept store, were meant to be the foundation of a RiRi-inspired wardrobe. The initial collection, titled “5-19” (though other outlets reported it is also being called “Weapon”), was a “greatest hits” reflection of the singer’s personal style. In a subdued color palette — white, salmon pink and khaki, mixed with plenty of dark Japanese denim — the point of view began with sharply tailored masculine silhouettes such as suit jackets, button-up dress shirts and tailored slacks and gave them a feminine and sometimes subversive club-wear twist adding up to plenty of options for the office and beyond.

To wit, a double-breasted jacket with strong shoulders, corseted waist and fitted rear became a minidress; a white cotton men’s shirt was reimagined into a sleeveless fitted minidress, while another version showed the same but with big puffy sleeves; and pants were given added volume with a large fold-over pleat starting at the waist and hitting the floor. Every look was presented with an execution befitting one of the world’s largest luxury groups.

Denim shirt jackets were either oversized and nipped at the waist and the 15-people strong sales force — all plucked for their luxury retail sales reputations — donned the stiff dark blue jean tops and pants.

If the ready-to-wear was in some ways subdued, the accessories aimed to shake things up with extreme, pointed strappy sandals anchored by a low vamp; bold gold-coated brass costume jewelry with Swarovski crystals that snaked around the ears or wrist; oversize resin hoops and square earrings; canvas fanny packs; baseball caps; and the infamous sunglasses line that gave the world a hint of what was to come when Rihanna donned them back in January.

With names such as “Guarded, “Blocked” and “Anti-social” the shield-styled specs have a futuristic look, elevating the collection into more dramatic territory.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999963045120239}",neutral,0.9999963045120239,0

The 31-year-old singer becomes the first person since 1987 to launch a new house with LVMH, with the last person being Christian LaCroix. Rihanna is also reportedly the first woman to create an original brand at LVMH and the first woman of colour at the top of an LVMH maison.

Rihanna, a native of Barbados, expressed her excitement about the new deal in an Instagram post Friday.

In a statement, Rihanna also said, ""Designing a line like this with LVMH is an incredibly special moment for us.""

She added that Bernard Arnault, the chairman and CEO of LVMH, ""has given me a unique opportunity to develop a fashion house in the luxury sector, with no artistic limits. I couldn't imagine a better partner both creatively and business-wise, and I'm ready for the world to see what we have built together.""

LVMH's leather and goods division includes Louis Vuitton, Christian Dior Couture, Celine, Kenzo, Givenchy, Fendi, Marc Jacobs and more, while its wine and spirts include Moet & Chandon and Dom Perignon. The company has also backed Rihanna's ultra-successful cosmetics brand, Fenty Beauty.

""Everybody knows Rihanna as a wonderful singer, but through our partnership at Fenty Beauty, I discovered a true entrepreneur, a real CEO and a terrific leader,"" said Arnault.

""She naturally finds her full place within LVMH,"" he said. ""I am proud that LVMH is leading this venture and wish it will be a great success.""

Fashion has been synonymous with Rihanna's name since the Grammy-winning superstar launched her music career in 2005. She has collaborated with brands such as Armani, Puma, Dior to launch products and lines, and she debuted her lingerie line, Savage X Fenty, last year.

Her Fenty Beauty collection disrupted the beauty industry when it launched in 2017, offering 40 foundation shades and bringing in more than $500 million US by the end of last year. The success of it forced other cosmetic brands to be more inclusive and launch more foundation shades, while Fenty extended to 50 shades.

A release date for Rihanna's new Fenty line with LVMH was not announced, but a website where consumers can eventually purchase the line launched Friday.

The new line ""is centred on Rihanna, developed by her, and takes shape with her vision in terms of ready to wear, shoes and accessories, including commerciality and communication of the brand,"" according to a news release.

""Celebrity fashion brands have been around a long time and led by singers, but in the past, they've tended to be done via licensing, wholesale distribution, and often more with mass retailers or department stores,"" said Miles Socha, editor-in-chief of Women's Wear Daily, in an interview with The Associated Press.

""What's different about this Rihanna project is her partner, which is the world's largest luxury group, which has expertise across a range of leather goods, perfumes, fashion, beauty — so it really raises the bar for celebrity-led fashion brands.""","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.5372201204299927}",neutral,0.5372201204299927,0

LVMH announced Friday that it will partner with Robyn Rihanna Fenty to create a new luxury fashion house under the label ""Fenty.""

This would put Fenty under the same umbrella as LVMH's other luxury fashion houses including Louis Vuitton, Christian Dior, Fendi and Givenchy.

LVMH said the Paris-based brand will launch its first line this spring. That line will feature ready to wear items developed by Rihanna, who becomes the first woman to launch an original brand at LVMH. She is also the first woman of color to head one of the group's houses.

Rihanna said in a statement that the opportunity to design a line with LVMH is ""an incredibly special moment.""

LVMH has recently made efforts to be more inclusive on issues of gender and race, appointing the first female designers of Givenchy and Dior in 2017 and 2016, respectively.

Since her debut as a pop star, Rihanna has turned heads at red carpet events and is seen as a fashion icon. She has since leveraged that influence into successful partnerships with brands like Mac Cosmetics and Puma.

""Everybody knows Rihanna as a wonderful singer, but through our partnership at Fenty Beauty, I discovered a true entrepreneur, a real CEO and a terrific leader,"" Arnault said in a statement.

Rihanna previously partnered with LVMH in 2017 to create her beauty brand ""Fenty Beauty,"" which operates out of San Francisco. She also has her own lingerie brand, Savage x Fenty. These brands were lauded for their inclusivity in both promotional materials and product offerings.

With her own house in LVMH, Rihanna is now part of a luxury products group with a market valuation of more than $190 billion.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9893510937690735}",neutral,0.9893510937690735,0

LVMH says legal exec's sexual harassment claims are 'meritless and frivolous' - Page Six,"Mon, 20 May 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vcGFnZXNpeC5jb20vMjAxOS8wNS8yMC9sdm1oLXNheXMtbGVnYWwtZXhlY3Mtc2V4dWFsLWhhcmFzc21lbnQtY2xhaW1zLWFyZS1tZXJpdGxlc3MtYW5kLWZyaXZvbG91cy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Luxury goods conglomerate LVMH has reacted with disdain after a senior legal exec in its NYC office sued for sexual harassment.

Andowah Newton, who works in LVMH’s New York office as vice president of legal affairs and litigation counsel, said in an April Manhattan Supreme Court filing that she was harassed by an unnamed “senior level management employee” who ogled her and “lunged” across her desk, “thrusting his pelvis and genitals into her face.”

Newton says she is taking legal action in “hopes to promote change to the culture,” after the firm tried to convince her that “the harassment was just a byproduct of being an attractive woman who works at a company with a French culture.”

But — even as Newton remains as head of litigation, managing the company’s most complex litigation — Paris-based Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton insists that her lawsuit is “meritless and frivolous,” stating in new court papers that an “impartial and unbiased” investigation conducted by a New York state judge found that Newton “was not sexually harassed” by the employee whom LVMH says was a “subordinate.”

Meanwhile, Newton contends in her court filing the company conducted a “sham” investigation and seemed more concerned with protecting its own glossy image.

Plus, she adds, the company further retaliated by suddenly promoting the man in the wake of her sexual harassment claim.

The company, run by billionaire Bernard Arnault, controls luxury brands including Dior, Fendi, Givenchy, Celine, Marc Jacobs, Dom Pérignon, Veuve Cliquot, Moët & Chandon, Krug, Belvedere, Bulgari, Hublot, TAG Heuer and newspaper Le Parisien. It argues that Newton cannot complain because she has “received a significant raise in salary . . . and a bonus that is larger than any bonus she has received in the last two years.”

LVMH also insists that Newton “brazenly violated” an agreement signed at hiring that mandates employee disputes should be heard at arbitration.

Note to LVMH: New York law now bans employers from enforcing arbitration agreements in employee sexual harassment claims in the wake of #MeToo.

These are the 10 most powerful luxury companies on Earth - The CEO Magazine,"Fri, 24 May 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWNlb21hZ2F6aW5lLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy9maW5hbmNlL3RoZS10b3AtMTAtbW9zdC1wb3dlcmZ1bC1sdXh1cnktYnJhbmRzLW9uLWVhcnRoL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"As smaller companies struggle to break into the market, global luxury goods companies continue to soar to incredible heights.

Louis Vuitton, Ralph Lauren and Estée Lauder are among the top brands generating an aggregated revenue of US$247 billion in FY2017, according to a recent study by Deloitte.

The rich taste for life’s finest luxuries is stronger than ever with the increase up US$30 billion on the previous year’s revenue.

As clothing and footwear dominated the charts, the top 10 companies in the multiple luxury goods sector alone collectively accounted for 30.8% of the total top 100 luxury goods sales.

“76% of the companies reported growth in their luxury sales, with nearly half of these recording double-digit year-on-year growth,” – Patrizia Arienti

“Despite the recent slowdown of economic growth in major markets including China, the Eurozone and the US, the luxury goods market looks positive,” Deloitte Global EMEA Fashion and Luxury Leader Patrizia Arienti says. “The top 100 players showed strong performance in FY2017 – 76% of the companies reported growth in their luxury sales, with nearly half of these recording double-digit year-on-year growth.”

While Asia’s economy slows, France shone as the best-performing country for sales growth.

To make the list, luxury goods revenue had to exceed US$218 million where many recorded an average company size of US$2.47 billion.

And the multibillion-dollar boom is being attributed to the HENRY, or the High-Earners-Not-Rich-Yet, generation, sweeping through, thought to earn between US$100,000 and US$250,000 per year.

Big businesses are increasingly keeping an eye on the new, younger consumer class made up mainly of millennials and gen Z – the customers of the future who are swimming in the finer things in life.

Rihanna's Fenty Is Now LVMH's Newest Growth Engine - Yahoo Finance,"Wed, 15 May 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9yaWhhbm5hLWFwb3MtZmVudHktbm93LWx2bWgtMTA1MTAwNDM1Lmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LVMH (NASDAQOTH: LVMUY), the world's largest luxury goods company, plans to launch a new fashion brand with Rihanna. Fenty, based on the singer's surname, will join LVMH's lineup of 70 fashion brands and sell a wide range of clothing, accessories, and shoes for its core fashion and leather business.

This builds upon LVMH's previous partnership with Rihanna, who launched Fenty Beauty for its perfumes and cosmetics division in September 2017. Fenty Beauty reportedly generated 500 million euros ($562 million) in sales from its launch through the end of 2018. That represented a significant slice of LVMH's perfumes and cosmetics unit, which generated 6.09 billion euros ($6.85 billion) in sales for the full year.

LVMH didn't disclose the financial terms of the new deal, but reports indicate that Fenty will mainly be an e-commerce brand supported by a network of pop-up shops and events. Let's see why this new brand could become a major growth engine for LVMH.

Why is Rihanna's Fenty brand so popular?

Rihanna trademarked her surname in 2014. That same year, Puma (ETR: PUM) appointed her as its creative director, which led to the launches of her Creeper shoes in 2015 and the Fenty x Puma apparel collection in 2016.

The Fenty line was a major hit for Puma, reviving the brand's appeal with young female shoppers and helping its footwear business generate double-digit sales growth again.

Fenty's success at Puma can be attributed to the popularity of the Creeper, which was voted ""best shoe of the year"" of 2016 by Footwear News. Rihanna's massive following on Instagram, where she currently has 70.6 million followers, also played a major role in its promotion -- which was arguably more effective than traditional marketing campaigns. Rihanna also launched Fenty products for apparel makers River Island and Stance.

Rihanna's Fenty Beauty collaboration with LVMH was widely praised because its cosmetics products were designed for a broader palette of skin tones and its inclusive ad campaign featured a wide array of models.

Story continues

Fenty Beauty now reaches 7.5 million followers on Instagram. That makes it the second most followed brand in LVMH's 12 perfume and cosmetics houses after Benefit, which reaches 9.3 million followers. LVMH didn't disclose Fenty Beauty's exact sales for 2018, but it cited Fenty's growth as a catalyst for the perfume and cosmetics unit's 14% organic sales growth in 2018.

Enhancing a powerful core business

LVMH's perfumes and cosmetics business generated just 13% of its sales last year. However, LVMH's new partnership with Rihanna will bring the Fenty brand to the fashion and leather unit, which generated 39% of its sales.

That core unit consists of 15 houses, including Louis Vuitton, Loewe, Christian Dior, Fendi, Givenchy, and Marc Jacobs. It posted 15% organic sales growth in 2018 on the strength of LV, Dior, and Fendi -- and the addition of Fenty to that portfolio could boost its momentum.

Both business units continued growing in the first quarter. Its perfumes and cosmetics revenue rose 9% annually on an organic basis, and its fashion and leather revenue climbed 15%. Simply put, LVMH's situation is very different from Puma's -- it isn't bringing in Rihanna to turn around an ailing business, it's bringing in Fenty to enhance two healthy businesses.

The addition of Fenty to LVMH's portfolio is already generating a lot of buzz on social media. Rihanna's Instagram post announcing the deal has attracted nearly a million likes as of this writing, while the announcement on Twitter has been retweeted thousands of times.

The bottom line

LVMH's decision to launch Rihanna's Fenty brand as a new fashion house speaks volumes about the power of celebrities with massive followings. The deal should attract younger shoppers to LVMH, strengthen its core businesses, and widen its moat against other high-end fashion players like Kering.

The French fashion conglomerate released a statement confirming the partnership on 10 May, announcing that it would be based in Paris.

""Everybody knows Rihanna as a wonderful singer, but through our partnership at Fenty Beauty, I discovered a true entrepreneur, a real CEO and a terrific leader,"" said Bernard Arnault, chairman and CEO of LVMH. ""To support Rihanna to start up the Fenty Maison, we have built a talented and multicultural team supported by the group resources.""

Rihanna added: ""Designing a line like this with LVMH is an incredibly special moment for us. Mr. Arnault has given me a unique opportunity to develop a fashion house in the luxury sector, with no artistic limits. I couldn’t imagine a better partner both creatively and business-wise, and I’m ready for the world to see what we have built together.""

Here's what we know about the label so far...

What will the line include?

The line is ""centred on Rihanna, developed by her, and takes shape with her vision in terms of ready-to-wear, shoes and accessories, including commerciality and communication of the brand,"" detailed LVMH in a statement, reports WWD. A statement from the brand said it reflected ""both the spirit of Rihanna and a new approach to modern luxury: agile and dynamic; elevated yet egalitarian; bold, free, fearless"".

The business is said to span both men's and women's fashion, plus childrenswear. Perhaps more surprising are unconfirmed reports that the label will also include tech products, office supplies, home decor and garden ware. Some say Rihanna debuted one of the pieces from her first collection in January, wearing a pair of oversized sunglasses which bore the Fenty brand name across her temples.

The collections won't follow the typical bi-annual fashion seasons, but rather will operate on a 'See Now Buy Now' basis. Each range will express a different part of a woman's personality.

What will it be called?

The label will launch under the name 'Fenty Maison', in reference to the singer's surname. Rihanna has previously used the Fenty labelling for her successful beauty and lingerie lines, as well as part of her previous fashion collaboration with Puma.

Before the launch was confirmed the venture was reportedly given the working title of Project Loud France, in reference to Rihanna's long-awaited and much anticipated fifth studio album, Loud.

When will it launch?

Fenty will launch online at Fenty.com on 29 May and at a Paris pop-up boutique on 24 May.

Who's involved?

In January, WWD reported that staff from Louis Vuitton and Celine had already been hired to work with Rihanna. LVMH’s chief strategy officer's Jean-Baptiste Voisin has been appointed as Project Loud president. Bernard Arnault stated that a ""talented and multicultural team"" had been appointed to work on the venture.

According to French filings from December 2018, Rihanna has poured €29,988,000 (about £25.8m) worth of in-kind contributions to the venture, while LVMH has injected €30 million in cash - which would make the conglomerate the majority owner.

What's Rihanna said about it so far?

In mid-May, the musician announced that the line would promote the many sides of women, both vulnerable and empowered.

“Women are forces of this earth,"" said the star in a statement. ""We are multi-faceted, complex, vulnerable yet bulletproof, and Fenty speaks to all of our intricacies. Some days I want to be submissive, many days I’m completely in charge and most days I feel like being both... so it was imperative that we created a line versatile enough to embrace and celebrate us in that way. The collections are easily worn together and meant to be staples in our wardrobe. I’m just hyped to see people in my clothes, man.""

How successful is it likely to be?

Rihanna has had proven success with her Fenty Beauty make-up brand and also with her lingerie line, Savage x Fenty, both of which have been praised for their inclusivity and diversity. “LVMH certainly knows what they're doing,” luxury analyst Mario Ortelli told the Business of Fashion. “They have one of the best platforms in the world in terms of design, marketing, distribution, supply chain. That’s why they’ll make the bet. But whether it succeeds will depend on execution.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9998595714569092}",neutral,0.9998595714569092,0

Rihanna’s LVMH Fenty Fashion Brand Will Launch at a Paris Pop-Up on Friday - Hollywood Reporter,"Mon, 20 May 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5ob2xseXdvb2RyZXBvcnRlci5jb20vbmV3cy9nZW5lcmFsLW5ld3MvcmloYW5uYXMtbHZtaC1mZW50eS1mYXNoaW9uLWJyYW5kLXdpbGwtbGF1bmNoLWF0LXBhcmlzLXBvcC11cC1mcmlkYXktMTIxMjI3MS_SAYUBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuaG9sbHl3b29kcmVwb3J0ZXIuY29tL25ld3MvZ2VuZXJhbC1uZXdzL3JpaGFubmFzLWx2bWgtZmVudHktZmFzaGlvbi1icmFuZC13aWxsLWxhdW5jaC1hdC1wYXJpcy1wb3AtdXAtZnJpZGF5LTEyMTIyNzEvYW1wLw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"More details are emerging about Rihanna‘s new fashion label.

Just 10 days ago, the parent company of Dior and Givenchy, Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton LVMH, announced Rihanna’s Fenty fashion house would launch under their massive umbrella. The deal made her the first female designer of color at the largest luxury brand worldwide.

On Monday, LVMH revealed the ready-to-wear clothes, shoes, jewelry, sunglasses and more will debut online on May 29 and at a Paris pop-up on Friday, May 24. The “Diamonds” singer also released a campaign video on Monday, featuring footage of a blue ball in the maze of her Fenty logo spliced with a sped-up video of models prepping for a photoshoot in front of backdrops of global cities.

“Women are forces of this earth. We are multifaceted, complex, vulnerable yet bulletproof, and Fenty speaks to all of our intricacies,” Rihanna said in a statement. “Some days I want to be submissive, many days I’m completely in charge and most days I feel like being both … so it was imperative that we created a line versatile enough to embrace and celebrate us in that way. The collections are easily worn together and meant to be staples in our wardrobe. I’m just hyped to see people in my clothes, man.”

In an interview with T Magazine, out Sunday, Rihanna confirmed there will be no runway show for her “disruptive” and “not traditional” brand.

She said partnering with LVMH was a “no brainer” and spoke about her business strategy. “I never just wanted to put my name on something and sell my license. I’m very hands-on, so I wanted to take it slowly and gain respect as a designer,” she said. “I didn’t have these dreams when I was little. I had a dream of making music; that’s it.”

In fact, seeing 2000s stars like Hilary Duff and Miley Cyrus dabble in makeup discouraged her. “I used to be afraid to step into the whole celebrity makeup world. … It diluted their personal brands. It made me think, ‘I’m not going to do this, because you lose your respect and credibility.'” So she decided that for every collaboration she did outside of music, she would use her surname Fenty — “So Rihanna stayed the music, the person. But these other brands are called Fenty.”

When asked if she’s felt like an outsider in the fashion industry as a black woman, Rihanna replied, “I will not back down from being a woman, from being black, from having an opinion. I’m running a company and that’s exactly what I came here to do. I don’t know if it makes people uncomfortable or not, but that’s not even my business, you know? I do know that the reason I’m here is not because I’m black. It’s because of what I have to offer.”

Rihanna went on to give details of the collection, noting that there are several classic pieces, the suits are made of cotton canvas, and that she uses her own masculine-meets-feminine style as her muse, pairing pearls with sweatpants. As for her design team, she’s not afraid of working with young designers just out of college. “I’m welcoming everyone’s vision here,” she said.

Although Rihanna didn’t attend the Met Ball this month, she’s continuing to establish her influence in fashion through the expansion of her brand. Last week, she brought on The Hate U Give star Amandla Stenberg as the first Hollywood ambassador for Fenty Beauty, launched in September 2017. “I wanted to become a part of the Fenty family because it’s one of the few beauty brands that make me feel like myself! Fenty Beauty’s whole ethos makes me feel empowered and excited to let different facets of myself shine,” Stenberg said in a statement.

According to the New York Times, Rihanna is the first woman to create an original brand at LVMH and the first woman of color at the top of an LVMH maison. This is also CEO Bernard Arnault’s first time launching a fashion house from scratch since Christian Lacroix in 1987. An Instagram account for the new line has been created at @fenty, with a brand-new logo.

The brand, which will be based in Paris, will feature ready-to-wear, shoes, and accessories. (Possibly those sunglasses we spotted back in January?)

The New York Times reports that the first products from the new brand will be unveiled in just a few weeks, so we won’t have to wait too long to see what our queen has in store for us. Between music, makeup, fashion, and accessories, 2019 is truly an incredible year for Rihanna—and a brutal year for our bank accounts.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9987391829490662}",neutral,0.9987391829490662,0

One small step for Rihanna, one giant step for womankind.

The singer turned fashion and beauty mogul just landed a major deal with LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, the French luxury goods conglomerate. According to a statement from the high-end fashion group released this morning, the 31-year-old’s successful Fenty line is the latest to join their powerhouse lineup of brands which include Céline, Dior, Givenchy and Fendi among many more. This breakthrough moment solidifies Rihanna’s spot in fashion history as she’s now the “first woman to create an original brand at LVMH and the first woman of color at the top of an LVMH maison,” according to The New York Times.

“Designing a line like this with LVMH is an incredibly special moment for us,” Rihanna said in the statement. “Mr. Arnault has given me a unique opportunity to develop a fashion house in the luxury sector, with no artistic limits.

Fenty Maison — which marks the first new house created under LVMH since Christian Lacroix in 1987 — is set to be a Paris-based collection of ready-to-wear, shoes and accessories. According to LVMH, the first launch from the brand, (whose logo features a “graphic representation of Fenty that resembles a Greek key design,” according to The New York Times) is coming soon.

Rihanna reflected on this major career achievement in a touching Tweet posted this morning, writing, “big day for the culture. thank you Mr. Arnault for believing in this little girl from the left side of an island, and for giving me the opportunity to grow with you at @LVMH.”

After the success of their first collaborative project Fenty Beauty (which sent shock waves through the makeup world by releasing 40 inclusive shades of foundation in 2017), LVMH Chairman Bernard Arnault said in a statement, “Everybody knows Rihanna as a wonderful singer, but through our partnership at Fenty Beauty, I discovered a true entrepreneur, a real C.E.O. and a terrific leader.”

Rihanna’s Fenty luxury fashion line comes to LVMH - Vox.com,"Fri, 10 May 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZveC5jb20vdGhlLWdvb2RzLzIwMTkvNS8xMC8xODU2NDM0OS9yaWhhbm5hLWZlbnR5LWx1eHVyeS1icmFuZC1sdm1oLWFubm91bmNlZNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"As rumored since January, Rihanna is launching her own fashion house.

The new brand is called Fenty — produced under the umbrella of the famed luxury goods conglomerate LVMH — and its first collection of ready-to-wear, shoes, accessories, and jewelry will be shown in Paris later this month, Business of Fashion reports. In a statement, Rihanna said that LVMH chief executive Bernard Arnault has placed “no artistic limits” on the line.

When rumors of the partnership kicked up earlier this year, Vox’s Nadra Nittle explained the significance of the possibility, writing, “Rihanna stands to become the first black woman designer at LVMH. From Kanye West to Jessica Simpson — fashion is rife with rappers, singers, actors, and reality stars with their own lines at department stores and the like. But having a luxury fashion house in one’s honor has been off limits to most celebrities.” This is also the first new fashion brand LVMH has launched since 1987, when Christian Lacroix founded his haute couture house.

According to the Business of Fashion, Rihanna will be a 49.99 percent shareholder in the new label. LVMH has put up over $30 million in cash to fund the venture, while her contribution will be her time, her name, and the value of her personal brand. In other words: The basic idea and general presence of Rihanna is worth more than $30 million.

That might sound extreme, but it’s backed up by her track record. Rihanna has 70 million Instagram followers, a reputation as the reigning champ of Vogue’s annual Met Gala (even in absentia), and she’s already launched plenty of successful products. Her Fenty Beauty line was backed by LVMH’s beauty incubator Kendo, debuted with 40 foundation shades, and reportedly brought in more than $550 million in its first year of business and strong-armed the entire industry into taking diversity seriously.

Her Fenty X Puma sneaker and slide collections — discontinued in spring 2018, presumably because Puma is owned by LVMH rival Kering — was credited with a 23 percent growth in footwear sales for the company. She also spent four years as creative director at Puma, kicking off a still-going trend of making streetwear and athletic apparel more accessible to women. Most recently, her Savage X Fenty lingerie line has been lauded as nothing less than the future of inclusivity in fashion.

Her Instagram post confirming Fenty was “Liked” 300,000 times within an hour of posting, and the official Instagram account for the new luxury house went from zero to 81,000 followers in the same time — without posting anything at all.

"Rihanna Opens Up About Her New Clothing Line, the Future of Fashion and Her Next Album (Published 2019) - The New York Times","Mon, 20 May 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tL2ludGVyYWN0aXZlLzIwMTkvMDUvMjAvdC1tYWdhemluZS9yaWhhbm5hLWZlbnR5LWxvdWlzLXZ1aXR0b24uaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"For her next act, the pop star will become the first black woman in charge of a major luxury fashion house in Paris. Here, she gives T magazine an exclusive first look.

FOR THREE YEARS, I have been a diligent student of Rihanna’s 2016 song “Work.” The first lesson it taught me was in the fine art of ubiquity: The omnipresent earworm hovered over casual intimacies, significant encounters, mundane journeys and made sense of itself wherever, in whatever crevices it chose. Then “Work” found its way into my own work. In my script for “Slave Play,” which debuted at New York Theater Workshop in 2018, the protagonist Kaneisha suffers from obsessive-compulsive disorder and Rihanna’s “Work” plays in her head on repeat, taking on a frighteningly oppressive quality and revealing the historic bedrock I was attempting to excavate: namely, that black people, specifically women, must live with the knowledge that their emotional and physical labor is the backbone of every relationship that they endeavor to have with their partners, with America. The song, which weaves through the dialogue, brought more attention to the play than any other device could have.

This sense of casual immensity is what drew me to Robyn Rihanna Fenty, 31, as not only a performer but as an artist and a businessperson: a model for my own maturation. When listening to her repetitive, patois-filled song — work, work, work, work, work, work — one hears a Barbados-born1 musician who recognizes that the histories that are carried in her movement and her tongue are foreign to the listener. But instead of shying from that otherness, she dines upon it, a lesson for any of us who have held onto the shame of difference. As she prepares to launch Fenty, the fashion line she has created in partnership with LVMH2 — the first luxury fashion house the conglomerate has created from scratch (which will begin sales at a pop-up in Paris on May 24, then be fully available at fenty.com on May 29) — I wanted to discover what lessons she had to offer as she carried that confident otherness deeper into the nonmusical work she has been concentrating on this decade.

In April, we agreed to meet among barrels of chocolate at Dark Sugars Cocoa House,3 in the Shoreditch neighborhood of London. I thought about the unenviable position that Rihanna has come to occupy throughout her 14-year career, since she first moved to Stamford, Conn., and released her first tracks in 2005. To be black, a woman and an immigrant in the United States is to be a collection of negations of the American dream — yet she stepped past those negations and into a fantasy of abundance few could imagine. In the last five years, we have witnessed her release her most critically acclaimed album,4 become creative director of women’s collections for the German sportswear brand Puma,5 develop a line of size- and gender-inclusive lingerie under the Savage x Fenty label and debut her Fenty Beauty line,6 which literally changed the face of the cosmetics world by introducing a foundation palette with 40 shades, from the palest to the darkest skin tones. Now, Rihanna has become the first black woman to run a major luxury fashion house. Featuring structured silhouettes in subdued neutrals (at least to start) that emphasize strong shoulders, cinched waists and exposed legs, the Fenty brand is hoping to disrupt the market not only by channeling the imagination of a black woman but by revolutionizing the luxury distribution model by focusing on direct-to-consumer online sales. This allows Rihanna and her team of collaborators the freedom to drop new additions to the collection — which includes sunglasses, shoes and other accessories — every few weeks, like singles from an album. LVMH and the artist decided last year to expand their current relationship beyond cosmetics into a full-fledged fashion company, and Rihanna has already imbued the collection with her high-low aesthetic, incorporating intricate leatherwork and meticulous techniques like boning, then queering the looks by playing with gender tropes.

Rihanna is uniquely positioned to forge a path for black owners in luxury fashion: Not only is she a muse of that realm herself but she has studied the maps she’s inherited from her forebears. From a red-carpet style indebted to the silhouettes of Zelda Wynn Valdes7 as well as the lush fabrics of Sean Combs’s Sean John line8 and the steely assurance of Jay-Z’s Rocawear9 collection, we have seen black fashion’s past adorning Rihanna as she steps into black fashion’s future. Indeed, the mission of the Fenty clothing line, according to Jahleel Weaver, a stylist for Rihanna who is now the label’s style director, “is to really speak to how multifaceted today’s woman is. We’re thinking about each release as a different facet to a woman’s wardrobe and how she approaches dressing. Luxury has been defined in the past as one woman, one brand: You know who the Saint Laurent woman is, you understood who the Céline woman was when it was Phoebe.10 Which is fine, but you think about how that relates to the modern woman. I don’t think she is just one thing, Rih being the perfect example of that.”

AS THE DOORBELL chimed, a brilliantly heeled foot — wearing one of the aggressively pointed leather Fenty sandals I’d previewed the day before — stepped through a hidden side door. I was instantly hit with the emotional heft that a student feels in the presence of a favorite teacher — if only all teachers wore pinstriped Balenciaga suits. She smelled like cinnamon, bubble gum and the sea, her scent dominating the overpowering chocolate around us. For the next two and a half hours, I studied her every glance and gesture for a hint of the weight her work must put upon her. The weight of expectation, the weight of anticipation, the weight of youth, the weight of doubt — though only in a single moment, when we spoke of fear, did this weight announce itself. Yet the lesson I took back home to New Haven with me is that there can be pleasure in the privilege of working despite society’s negations. The pleasure and ubiquity of Rihanna’s work endures because the only thing that will stop her from doing it — is her.

‘I can’t just think I know everything. I’m very smart with my control freak. I welcome other people’s expertise.’

JH: What are some of the things you’ve come to appreciate since you’ve moved to London?11

RF: Walking around the block.

JH: Wait, you can walk around the block? Because here, they had to shut everything down.

RF: No! This is not a regular day in London. It’s a bank holiday. Everyone’s out. It’s insane.

JH: Do people recognize you?

RF: When I go walking, I try to keep it a little incognito.

JH: Well, you are Rihanna. Which brings me to my first question: What draws you to collaborate with a company like LVMH? I feel like you’re as big as LVMH, if not bigger.

RF: Whoa. That’s kind of crazy to say.

JH: It’s true, though. Numbers don’t lie.12

RF: I’ve been slowly evolving throughout the fashion world. First wearing it, buying it, being recognized for my style and then collaborating with brands. I never just wanted to put my name on something and sell my license. I’m very hands-on, so I wanted to take it slowly and gain respect as a designer. I already had a relationship with them after the Versailles campaign13 and the makeup line, so they extended the offer to me and it was a no-brainer because LVMH is a machine. Bernard Arnault14 was so enthusiastic; he trusted me and my vision.

JH: When they came to you with this, was part of your calculus, like, “I’m gonna be the first black woman to do this?”

RF: No, and I didn’t even know that until months into our relationship, when Jahleel15 brought it to my attention. And I’m like, “Are you sure about that? Did you do your research? ’Cause I don’t wanna state a claim that’s [expletive].” Because I still couldn’t believe it. It made me feel proud.

JH: It’s unmapped territory. What models did you have — or were you purely going from one task to the next?

RF: I didn’t have these dreams when I was little. I had a dream of making music; that’s it. I didn’t even think about the fame part, and then that happened, and it’s like, “Do I really like this? How much do I really love music that I’m dealing with this?” Then the one-hit-wonder comment16 came straight out of the gate and that put a fire under my ass, and I just never stopped working. Every time it was about challenging myself: I have to do better, I have to do better. And what’s next, what’s next? I won a Grammy17 and that was seconds into my past as soon as it got into my hands. I have to think about the next thing, which is terrible because people should live in the moment. I just started branching out into different creative outlets. That’s what makes me happy.

JH: Something that one of my mentors, the playwright Branden Jacobs-Jenkins,18 said to me is, “Never let anyone rob you of your right to fail.”

RF: You know what’s crazy, I have a tattoo that’s written backward so I can read it in the mirror: “Never a failure. Always a lesson.” So what you just said is, like, boom! How you gonna learn without making mistakes? Did you believe your mom when she said, “Don’t touch the iron”?

JH: No! None of us did.

RF: You had to touch it, right? You had to get burned.

JH: What lessons do you think you could learn from failing with this Fenty project?

RF: So many, because it’s the beginning of a new world. Everything was a collaboration, so I’ve plugged my DNA into theirs, but there was already a blueprint. I’m learning so much: about the tailoring, the fabric — I’m seeing fabrics that I’ve never seen in my life.

JH: What are some of those fabrics?

RF: One of them is called Weapon.19 That’s what we ended up making our suits in. Even making clothes in luxury is different. All the techniques are, like, ridiculous.

JH: I mean, all of the boning on your dresses is —

RF: I love a corset. We put a corset in a suit, a dress, a shirt, a denim jacket and a T-shirt dress.

JH: It’s so femme. But you’re using traditionally masculine shapes (the suit, the chore coat) to tell a complex narrative about the Fenty person. What is the Fenty person’s relationship to masculinity and femininity?

RF: I use myself as the muse. It’s sweatpants with pearls, or a masculine denim jacket with a corset. I feel like we live in a world where people are embracing every bit of who they are. Look at Jaden Smith,20 Childish Gambino.21 They dare you to tell them not to.

JH: To me, part of being Rihanna is twerking on a yacht and walking out of a bar with a wine glass. You’re like a modern Dionysus, a goddess of the party, the turn-up. Does that feel true to you now as Fenty’s muse?

RF: There has been quite an evolution in that party. In the beginning, it was just my culture, my life. And now, the party, believe it or not, is at work. I do not go out. I will go to a dinner. I try to have as much fun as I can during work. And even after work, when I’m literally in my kitchen having a drink, I invite all my staff. And we work, still.

JH: Do you think that that ability to party with your staff comes from the fact your associates and staff, known as #TheCorp,22 are like family?

RF: I see them more than my family and spend most of my life with them. It becomes friendship first, and then it leads into family because we lean on each other. I’m sure it’s really different from any other boss-employee relationship.

JH: Using your family name as the anchor of this company and Fenty Beauty seems to recall the idea of a family business. What was behind that choice?

RF: I used to be afraid to step into the whole celebrity makeup world. I saw brands like Hilary Duff and Hannah Montana23 have so much success [in the aughts], but it got to a place where they were so oversaturated in the market that it diluted their personal brands. It made me think, “I’m not going to do this, because you lose your respect and credibility,” and so every collaboration I did outside of music, I used Fenty so that you didn’t have to hear the word “Rihanna” every time you saw something that I did. So Rihanna stayed the music, the person. But these other brands are called Fenty.

‘You’re going to be black wherever you go. And I don’t know if it’s unfortunate or fortunate, because I love being black.’

JH: Do you know where your last name comes from? I looked it up.

RF: Really? You’re about to teach me something about myself. Is it Irish?

JH: No, it’s Spanish and Portuguese. It derives from the word “infante,” a title for the children of royals.

RF: Get out of here!

JH: It’s a medieval name.

RF: That is tripping me out.

JH: Does it trip you out that Fenty gets to open so many doors? How are you looking to make room at that table of luxury design for other black, brown and female designers?

RF: I like to think of my establishment at the Fenty house as a hub. So I am always looking at grad collections, who’s about to leave college, who wants a year here. And we’ve done that with a couple young designers and a couple new ones that are coming in. Even if you’ve never designed something in your life, you might have impeccable taste: I’m welcoming everyone’s vision here, because that’s what it’s gonna take. I can’t just think I know everything. I’m very smart with my control freak — a smart control freak. I welcome other people’s expertise. I love new, young talent.

JH: Who was really generous with their knowledge with you?

RF: Jay Brown, my manager who started off as my A&R.24 He’s been a father figure in my life.25

JH: Jahleel said that when you hired him you gave him “his freedom papers.” He’s free to walk through the LVMH headquarters in Paris and be who he wants to be. Where does that freedom come from? From being affiliated with you?

RF: No, because even within being Rihanna, that freedom didn’t exist for a while. “Good Girl Gone Bad”26 is where I started to take the reins: “I’m going to do whatever I want to do, I’m taking control of my vision, my sound, my clothes.” I also embraced change along the way — things that make me a better woman, a better human being. Like, even the way I communicate: I’m really proud of my growth on that. I’m proud to walk into any building as this person. Nothing about me makes me embarrassed about me.

JH: You did an interview in 2012 where you said you used to change your voice in business meetings. Was that one of the pressures you felt in that era, to be a certain type of Bajan woman in American society?

RF: No, that was the pressure I felt from the jump, with “Music of the Sun.”27 I’m walking into a new world, new industry, with people who have been doing this forever. I’m literally from a rock in the ocean.

JH: You were 15!28

RF: Right. You know nothing then. So you just take these people’s advice, and you realize, This is not who I am. It was the pressure of feeling safe in a box. I never liked that feeling, and so I grew out of that box when I couldn’t take it anymore, and I just went for it.

JH: Is “Good Girl Gone Bad” your favorite album?

RF: No, because that was a transition. I don’t know what my favorite album is — I’m sure if I put all my favorite songs together, it would be a really sick album. Maybe I should do that one day.

JH: You should troll your fans by doing that. Be like, “New album, y’all!”

RF: They would hate me. They would take me down.

JH: I’m not in the Navy,29 but I am Navy adjacent. So I have to ask some questions I saw floating around the message boards.

RF: O.K. [Laughs.]

JH: Is it true you are doing a reggae album?

RF: Yeah.

JH: You are? O.K., are you collaborating with Lady Gaga?

RF: No.

JH: Oh, they think you’re doing a collaboration with Lady Gaga.

RF: Maybe because she followed me on Instagram. It’s not in the books right now, but I’m not against it.

JH: Are you going to collaborate with Drake again?30

RF: Not anytime soon, I don’t see it happening. Not on this album, that’s for sure.

JH: What is the album called?

RF: Uh, I don’t know yet.

JH: If you don’t know yet, then you probably don’t know when it’s coming out?

RF: I don’t.

JH: Do you have any names under consideration?

RF: No, so far it’s just been R9,31 thanks to the Navy. I’m about to call it that probably, ’cause they have haunted me with this “R9, R9, when is R9 coming out?” How will I accept another name after that’s been burned into my skull?

JH: It’s this gift to the fans who have been most hungry for it.

RF: That would be cute.

Rihanna models her new Fenty line on T’s digital cover.

JH: You are one of our only immigrant pop stars in America, 21 Savage32 being another. Did coming from an island that’s 90 percent black make it feel natural to have 40 distinct shades in the first run of Fenty Beauty?

RF: In my own household, my father is half black, half white. My mom is black from South America. I was seeing diversity. That’s all I knew. Growing up, I wanted to be darker, always. So, making makeup, it wasn’t even a thing I had to think about. I didn’t even really know how bad it was, the void in the market for dark foundation, because all I’d seen was black women put makeup on. I don’t even think 40 shades is enough! And so I added 10 more recently, and we’re not gonna stop there.

JH: A few years ago, you started going on a “thicc” journey.33 How did that change how you looked at inclusivity with regard to your fashion line?

RF: It just changed how I dress in terms of my proportions. You wear what looks good on you and that’s it. I’m thick and curvy right now, and so if I can’t wear my own stuff then, I mean, that’s not gonna work, right? And my size is not the biggest size. It’s actually closer to the smallest size we have: We go up to a [French size] 46.34 We’re saying we can meet you at any one drop that we put out.

JH: Let’s talk about those monthly drops, which is one of the innovative aspects of this: Fenty will be releasing several new items — from basics to special pieces — exclusively on its website. How did you come up with the distribution model?

RF: Because I’m a millennial, you know? People are always looking for the thing that hasn’t made it online yet. And as a consumer, I hate seeing something on the runway and then having to wait six months for it. I had to wait all that time to get it, do I even…

JH: Love it anymore?

RF: Yeah! So with this, you see it, you love it, you can have it. I want to be as disruptive as possible. The brand is not traditional. There is no runway show. It’s a new way of doing things because I believe that this is where fashion is going to go eventually.

JH: Was there any white knuckling in the LVMH offices when you presented this distribution model? Tradition is a major pillar of that company.

RF: Believe it or not, it’s the thing that actually excited Mr. Arnault. He hasn’t started a brand from scratch for a while. It’s his baby as well. He is so hands-on, which validates how I handle things.

JH: Jahleel said Fenty is being released like a bunch of singles that add up to an album.

RF: That’s a cute analogy.

JH: What do you think is the vibe of the first single?

RF: The first single is really strong and edgy, compared to the drop right after, which is a little more feminine. But the first one, there are a lot of classic pieces as well.

JH: I think you have your Fenty little black dress in there, with the vents and high shoulder.

RF: I see a lot of these pieces as classic pieces. They’re not gonna go out of style.

JH: What are you inspired by as you prepare for the next few drops?

RF: Free postcards or booklets at hotels in Barbados from years ago: You’ll see some of those on our T-shirts. There are also these prints that look like really ancient paintings that we’re making dresses and skirt suits out of.

JH: With all of these pieces, who else do you think is in conversation with them? What should shoppers pair with Fenty?

RF: I don’t care what you pair it with. Whatever you want. You know, when I was younger, I couldn’t afford everything, but a pair of Timberlands: That was my Dior. And I had to save my money for a whole school year to get those Timberlands that I wanted, and I did it. Shoot, if your closet is full of Dior, go for it, put Fenty on with that. But you might have some Balenciaga sneakers and a Fashion Nova fit that my jacket is super lit with.

JH: So that little girl that’s saving up pennies for Timberlands, what do you say to her right now?

RF: It’s the thing that keeps me asking: So how much is this gonna cost at retail?35 How can we bring the price down without compromising on quality?

JH: I can’t get over the fact that, you know, the fashion industry is historically so explicitly white, it’s so racist, it’s so classist and it’s so sexist. Have there been moments where, as a black woman, you’ve felt like an outsider in this space? Or does being Rihanna alleviate that?

RF: It’s never alleviated, you know? You’re going to be black wherever you go. And I don’t know if it’s unfortunate or fortunate, because I love being black. So, sorry for those who don’t like it — that’s the first thing you see before you even hear my voice. There are also other factors: I’m young. I’m new to the family. I’m a woman. Those factors do come into play, but I will not apologize for them, and I will not back down from being a woman, from being black, from having an opinion. I’m running a company and that’s exactly what I came here to do. I don’t know if it makes people uncomfortable or not, but that’s not even my business, you know? I do know that the reason I’m here is not because I’m black. It’s because of what I have to offer. That’s what they’re invested in. And the fact that I’m black is just that: a fact.

JH: I feel like your ability to take on that fight seems so indebted to your mother, Ms. Monica,36 because you often discuss how she is most proud of you when you stand up for yourself. I wonder, does anything surprise her now?

RF: When I told her about LVMH, she just couldn’t believe it. She said, “Oh God, glory, glory to God.” She’s so proud, so happy, and she’s still pinching herself. She carries my makeup in her store37 in Barbados. It’s full circle, because she was the one who brought me into the department store after school — all that makeup, it was fun.

JH: I was at my mom’s feet in a hair salon. I know she’d want to know: Do you have Fenty hair coming?

RF: As soon as I’m ready to give up the two hours of sleep that I get now, that’s for hair. You know we’re not stopping.

JH: As a playwright, I have to ask: Would you act again? Pull “A Star Is Born?”

RF: I’ll probably try a little more,38 but not until I know I can handle a lead and carry a movie on my own, because I’ve been offered —

JH: I’m sure.

RF: I’m always like, “Guys, thank you for trusting me, but Angelina Jolie is over there.”

JH: What else are you afraid of? Do you hold fear at all?

RF: I am afraid of being afraid, because I know that means it’s wrong. If I feel fear, that means it’s not right.

JH: Did you feel fear when it came to working with LVMH and Arnault?

RF: No, I got this pressure to not let Arnault down. I felt like this is a moment in history that I have to live up to. This is my one shot and I only get one time to do it and it can’t be wrong. But I did get fear one time in my life, I can’t remember exactly about what: I remember my mom saying, like, “I see something in your eyes I’ve never seen before.” And I was like, “What?” And she was like, “Fear.” And I started crying. So any time I get that anxiety feeling, I literally try to shove it right back down to nothing.

JH: You visualize it. Before I go, one last question: When are you going to take a vacation from all of this? Is it going to be when you’ve made enough money — is there a number in your mind?

RF: I never thought I’d make this much money, so a number is not going to stop me from working. I’m not being driven by money right now. Money is happening along the way, but I’m working out of what I love to do, what I’m passionate about. Work will change when my life changes in the future but an amount of money is not going to stop that.

JH: If money’s not driving the work, what does the money mean, then?

RF: The money means that I can take care of my family. The money means that I can facilitate the businesses that I want to. I can create jobs for other people. My money is not for me; it’s always the thought that I can help someone else or, in the future, for if I have kids. The world can really make you believe that the wrong things are priority, and it makes you really miss the core of life, what it means to be alive. It could literally be walking outside in the sun. That makes me happy. Like going to the grocery store — you know, there’s a cute little Jamaican market near where I live right now.

Rihanna: 5 Things To Know About Her New High Fashion Maison Fenty Collection With LVMH - HollywoodLife,"Fri, 10 May 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vaG9sbHl3b29kbGlmZS5jb20vMjAxOS8wNS8xMC9yaWhhbm5hLWx2bWgtZmVudHktZmFzaGlvbi1icmFuZC_SAUpodHRwczovL2hvbGx5d29vZGxpZmUuY29tLzIwMTkvMDUvMTAvcmloYW5uYS1sdm1oLWZlbnR5LWZhc2hpb24tYnJhbmQvYW1wLw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Rihanna, 31, officially confirmed her partnership with LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, the largest luxury group in the world, on Friday, May 10. The partnership means that Rihanna will have her very own high fashion maison in Paris, named Fenty. This is huge news for the singer, who has managed to create her own empire thus fur, with her multiple Fenty x Puma collections, creating her own lingerie brand, Savage X Fenty, and her very own cosmetics company, Fenty Beauty. However, the news that she will have her own LVMH brand, is by far her biggest accomplishment, and the news of the partnership with the stylish songstress checks off a lot of firsts for both Rihanna and LVMH. Rihanna couldn’t contain her excitement, posting the news to her Instagram, writing: “big day for the culture. thank you Mr. Arnault for believing in this little girl from the left side of an island, and for giving me the opportunity to grow with you at @LVMH. This is proof that nothing is impossible. Glory be to God.”

1. Rihanna is the first woman to create an original brand at LVMH.

With high fashion brands including Dior, Givenchy, Celine and Fendi, there has never been a brand at LVMH created by a woman. Rihanna has officially made history with her new Fenty brand, which is named after herself, as her real full name is Robyn Rihanna Fenty.

2. Rihanna is the first woman of color to head her own maison with LVMH.

Aside from being the first woman to have her own original brand at the company, she is also the first woman of color to be at the top of an LVMH maison. A maison is a luxury fashion house, and Rihanna’s Fenty maison will be in Paris.

3. Fenty is the first new house created by LVMH since Christian Lacroix in 1987.

Bernard Arnault, chairman and CEO of LVMH, shared a statement about the partnership, “Everybody knows Rihanna as a wonderful singer, but through our partnership at Fenty Beauty, I discovered a true entrepreneur, a real CEO and a terrific leader. She naturally finds her full place within LVMH. To support Rihanna to start up the Fenty maison, we have built a talented and multicultural team supported by the group resources. I am proud that LVMH is leading this venture and wish it will be a great success.”

4. Fenty will include ready-to-wear, shoes and accessories.

The fashion company will debut the first collection this spring. Rihanna shared in a statement what it was like to make the new brand, “Designing a line like this with LVMH is an incredibly special moment for us. Mr. Arnault has given me a unique opportunity to develop a fashion house in the luxury sector, with no artistic limits. I couldn’t imagine a better partner both creatively and business-wise, and I’m ready for the world to see what we have built together.”

5. This partnership marks LVMH’s first foray into the pop culture era.

This marks the first time that LVMH has ever had a brand from a pop culture icon, singer, and actress, officially ranking Rihanna in the same playing field as legendary designers, Hedi Slimane, of Celine, and Nicolas Ghesquière, of Louis Vuitton.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9998369216918945}",neutral,0.9998369216918945,0

FBI subpoenas Louis Vuitton owner LVMH in US media buying probe - CampaignLive,"Thu, 23 May 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNhbXBhaWdubGl2ZS5jby51ay9hcnRpY2xlL2ZiaS1zdWJwb2VuYXMtbG91aXMtdnVpdHRvbi1vd25lci1sdm1oLXVzLW1lZGlhLWJ1eWluZy1wcm9iZS8xNTg1NTk40gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The US Federal Bureau of Investigation has issued a subpoena to French luxury group LVMH as part of its probe into media buying transparency in the US, Campaign has learned.

There is no suggestion of wrongdoing by LVMH, which owns brands including Louis Vuitton, Moët & Chandon, Veuve Clicquot, Hennessy and Christian Dior.

When the FBI, the law enforcement arm of the US Department of Justice, wants to make a legal demand for information, it typically goes to court to request a subpoena.

The request must be approved by a grand jury, a group of several dozen members of the public, which meets privately to weigh the evidence.

It is thought that the FBI may be seeking information about LVMH’s estimated $400m-a-year US media buying account.

A spokesman for the FBI gave no comment, citing its long-standing policy that it does not confirm or deny the existence of any investigation. LVMH said it had no comment.

LVMH appointed Dentsu Aegis Network as its media buying agency network in the US last year. Havas previously held the account.

There has been no allegation of wrongdoing against either of the agency groups.

Campaign first revealed in June 2018 that the FBI was beginning an investigation into media trading and transparency and was gathering information.

The LVMH subpoena suggests the FBI’s probe has advanced and Campaign understands that there have been other developments:

The FBI has approached and interviewed former or current executives from multiple agencies as part of its broader investigation.

Part of the focus of the FBI’s inquiries has been the out-of-home advertising sector.

There is also speculation that the FBI has issued a subpoena to demand information from an unidentified media owner.

The FBI reiterated that it was unable to confirm or deny information in relation to any investigation.

Asking advertisers for help

The FBI has asked advertisers for help. The Association of National Advertisers, the trade body for US advertisers, sent a white paper to its members in November 2018, explaining that the FBI was asking for co-operation.

""The FBI does not have the resources to investigate dozens or hundreds of potential financial fraud victims, each of which may present different facts and evidence,"" the ANA’s white paper said.

""As such, the FBI is asking that advertisers first conduct their own investigations. If indicia of fraud is uncovered, the FBI would then like to hear from the advertiser as to what it has found.""

The white paper added: ""One should not, however, speculate on what companies or individuals may be persons of interest or targets in the investigation as thus far, no one has been charged with any criminal behaviour.

""The FBI’s resources are stretched and it therefore asks for assistance from the potential victim advertiser community.""

The media transparency debate first exploded in 2016 when the ANA used private investigators from K2 Intelligence to carry out a report that found ""non-transparent"" practices were ""pervasive"" across the US media agency sector.

The report suggested some agency groups were receiving secret rebates from media owners and marking up the cost of ads at a profit – without telling their clients.

The ANA and K2 Intelligence did not identify any agency group and all names were redacted and treated anonymously.

The report only examined media agency practices in the US.

Industry observers say media trading has become complex and can sometimes involve payments in multiple countries or offshore.

All of the big agency groups denied they had done anything wrong when the ANA report was published.

The FBI is the lead US government agency that investigates corporate fraud and it has significant powers to look into white-collar crime, including ""illicit transactions to evade regulatory oversight"" and ""kickbacks"".","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999147653579712}",neutral,0.9999147653579712,0
Rihanna Working on Fashion Line With LVMH: Details - Us Weekly,"Fri, 10 May 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnVzbWFnYXppbmUuY29tL3N0eWxpc2gvbmV3cy9yaWhhbm5hLXdvcmtpbmctb24tZmFzaGlvbi1saW5lLXdpdGgtbHZtaC1kZXRhaWxzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"UPDATE: Months after Us Weekly exclusively reported that Rihanna was working with LVMH on a clothing line, the luxury conglomerate confirmed on Friday, May 8, that a Fenty ready-to-wear collection is set to launch for spring 2019 (i.e. soon!).

“Designing a line like this with LVMH is an incredibly special moment for us,” RiRi said in a statement. “[LVMH chairman Bernard Arnault] has given me a unique opportunity to develop a fashion house in the luxury sector, with no artistic limits. I couldn’t imagine a better partner both creatively and business-wise, and I’m ready for the world to see what we have built together.”

Based in Paris, Maison Fenty will offer clothing, shoes and accessories that we hear will be “elevated” and “upscale” — but with the songstress’ signature “cool girl” flair.

“Everybody knows Rihanna as a wonderful singer, but through our partnership at Fenty Beauty, I discovered a true entrepreneur, a real CEO and a terrific leader,” Arnault said in a press release. “She naturally finds her full place within LVMH. To support Rihanna to start up the Fenty Maison, we have built a talented and multicultural team supported by the Group resources. I am proud that LVMH is leading this venture and wish it will be a great success.”

No word yet on an exact launch date, but a landing page for Fenty.com is already up and running. Stay tuned!

Original Story Below:

Rihanna has already conquered the music and beauty industries, so why wouldn’t the fashion world be next? A source tells Us that the beauty mogul has partnered with LVMH (the luxury conglomerate behind Louis Vuitton, Givenchy, Marc Jacobs, Celine and more) to build her own ready-to-wear brand.

Last month, RiRi piqued our interest when she rocked shield-like sunglasses for a night-out in NYC that featured a Fenty logo on the side. The conspicuous shades led many to speculate there is a line of — at the very least — accessories coming. But now it looks like there could be something larger in the works.

Related: Rihanna Proves Big Sunglasses Are in While Possibly Giving Us a Sneak Peak at Her Fenty Accessories Line Tiny sunglasses may be hot amongst the supermodel elite but Rihanna’s proving that large shades are back big time for 2019. When leaving a 718 Spank’s concert in New York City on Tuesday, January 15, the Umbrella singer was seen wearing a pair of large almost-square sunglasses with her neon-green shirt and bulky blazer combo. This […]

The source says Rihanna’s fashion project is already funded and being built from the ground up with staffers from LVMH brands like Celine joining the team. “A lot of people in the fashion industry are trying to move from their companies to work on Rihanna’s line because her sales are always very high,” the source tells Us, adding that the line will be “elevated” and “upscale” — but with “cool girl” spin.

While the nine-time Grammy winner initially made a name for herself in the recording studio, the Barbados native has quietly built quite the business empire. As WWD reported, Rihanna first got into the design game in 2013, collaborating with British high-street brand River Island on clothing and accessories. She subsequently modeled for fashion houses like Gucci, Emporio Armani and Balmain and worked on a collection of sunglasses with Dior in 2016.

That same year, RiRi’s highly successful Fenty x Puma activewear collaboration burst onto the scene during New York Fashion Week. She next teamed with LVMH’s Kendo incubator to create Fenty Beauty, which revolutionized the complexion game when it came to market in September 2017 with 40 (!) shades of foundation.

In 2018, the “Umbrella” singer continued to diversify with Savage x Fenty lingerie. Working with California-based TechStyle Fashion Group, the inclusive collection debuted with 90 pieces of undergarments, sleepwear and accessories in sizes XS to 3XL. Bras are available from 32A to 44DD and come in “nude” shades representative of wide variety of skin tones.

LVMH declined to comment on the rumored Rihanna line, but some believe a Fenty fashion launch could correspond with the debut of the singer’s new album later this year. In the meantime, we’ll be keeping an eye on her outfits for clues.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.5603839159011841}",neutral,0.5603839159011841,0
Rihanna Confirms Launch of Luxury Fenty Fashion Brand For Spring 2019 - ELLE,"Fri, 10 May 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVsbGUuY29tL2Zhc2hpb24vYTI3NDMxNjI5L3JpaGFubmEtbHZtaC1tb2V0LWhlbm5lc3NleS1mZW50eS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"On Monday, Rihanna made the unusual decision to skip the Met Ball, an event that she regularly dominates. On Friday, it was confirmed that she would be creating an original fashion line for LVMH under the Fenty name. The first collection is set to be released for spring 2019–in other words, any day now.

Though fans may lament the fact that the mogul hasn't released an album in years, we have to understand that these money moves take time and when Rihanna completes her quest for world domination, all national anthems will be Rihanna songs and we'll have all the new music our hearts desire.

According to the New York Times, Rihanna is the first woman to create a brand at LVMH and ""the first woman of color at the top of an LVMH maison,"" thus making official her already massive influence on the fashion world. After a successful partnership with Puma, creating four Fenty x Puma activewear collections, and a later foray into lingerie with Savage x Valentine's, this is a natural next step for Rihanna and for a world that marvels it was able to clothe itself at all before she came along.

The Fenty Maison, per a press release, will be ""centered on Rihanna, developed by her, and takes shape with her vision."" This is a good practice for pretty much everything. ""Welcome to my restaurant: it is centered on Rihanna, developed by her, and takes shape with her vision.""

""This is my oldest child, they are centered on Rihanna, developed by her, and takes shape with her vision.""

""What are my qualifications for this job? I'm centered on Rihanna, developed by her, and take shape with her vision. When do I start?""

Bernard Arnault, chairman and CEO of LVMH praised the multi-hyphenate talent in the joint announcement of the project. ""Everybody knows Rihanna as a wonderful singer,"" he said, echoing the opinion of the entire world and all of its inhabitants. ""But through our partnership at Fenty Beauty, I discovered a true entrepreneur, a real CEO and a terrific leader. She naturally finds her full place within LVMH. To support Rihanna to start up the Fenty Maison, we have built a talented and multicultural team supported by the Group resources. I am proud that LVMH is leading this venture and wish it will be a great success.""

The fact that the first collection from Fenty will be unveiled in just a few weeks is a dramatic move signaling the designer's intention and ability to shake up the marketplace. It is also your first and only warning that you should probably go empty your savings account right now to get ready. After all, this is Rihanna's world and everything in it is hers.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9996618032455444}",neutral,0.9996618032455444,0
Rihanna's Luxury Fashion Label Is Officially Happening—and Debuting a Lot Sooner Than You Think - W Magazine,"Fri, 10 May 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndtYWdhemluZS5jb20vc3RvcnkvcmloYW5uYS1mZW50eS1sdXh1cnktYnJhbmQtbHZtaNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Beloved as she is, Rihanna has been causing her fanbase quite a bit of frustration of late, from the notable absence of new music by her to her notable absence on the red carpet at this year’s Met Gala on Monday. By the end of the week, though, she’d more than made up for it: Friday finally brought official confirmation that Rihanna is indeed teaming up with LVMH on a new luxury fashion label, confirming the rumors that have been circulating since January.

In more welcome news, this time around, there’s pretty much no wait time: Rihanna is presenting her first Fenty collection less than two weeks from now, on May 22. And rest assured, Rihanna means business; this is no short-lived collab or line of glorified merch. Bernard Arnault, the CEO of LVMH, has already taken to calling it “Fenty Maison”—no small endorsement, coming from the head of the largest luxury group in the world, which is home to Dior, Louis Vuitton, Givenchy, Celine, and plenty of other industry heavyweights.

Of course, this being Rihanna, she’s already managed to take a step further than the rest: Hers is the first major brand that LVMH has launched from scratch since 1987, when it founded the namesake label of the legendary couturier Christian Lacroix. What’s more, as the New York Times notes, Rihanna is the first woman create an original LVMH brand—and the first woman of color to helm an LVMH maison.

Relatively speaking, Rihanna might be a newcomer to the industry, but she’s found success in it from the start nonetheless. That began when Fenty was first introduced in 2016, when it was known as Fenty x Puma and owned by Kering, LVMH’s longtime rival. Almost immediately, she was warmly welcomed into the roster of designers who show during both New York and Paris Fashion Weeks, making her presence known via her inspirations—spring 2017 imagined what “Marie Antoinette would wear if she was going to the gym“—and presentations, like her last ready-to-wear runway show, which came complete with motocross racers doing backflips over giant pink piles of sand. There’s no denying that Rihanna’s been keeping busy ever since; since then, she launched a successful, size-inclusive lingerie line, Savage x Fenty, as well as carried over her dedication to inclusivity through the empire that is Fenty Beauty, which is also under LVMH.

Naturally, Arnault couldn’t be more thrilled. “Everybody knows Rihanna as a wonderful singer, but through our partnership at Fenty Beauty, I discovered a true entrepreneur, a real CEO, and a terrific leader. She naturally finds her full place within LVMH,” he said in a statement. Rihanna confirmed just how much faith he’s placed in her in a statement of her own: “Mr. Arnault has given me a unique opportunity to develop a fashion house in the luxury sector, with no artistic limits.” In that case, the Fenty ready-to-wear, accessories, jewelry, and sunglasses that she’s about to roll out couldn’t sound more promising.

Rihanna's New Fenty Fashion Label Launch With LVMH: What You Need To Know & Pictures | British Vogue - British Vogue,"Thu, 23 May 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiOWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZvZ3VlLmNvLnVrL2dhbGxlcnkvZmVudHktbHZtaC1sYXVuY2gtcmloYW5uYdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Deputy Editor & Fashion Features Director Sarah Harris delivers the Vogue verdict on Rihanna's first foray into luxury fashion. It’s no secret that Rihanna marches to the beat of her own drum. At the pop-up store in Paris for a walk-through of Fenty, her debut ready-to-wear collection created in partnership with luxury conglomerate LVMH, she postponed the meeting by one hour, which then turned into a further two-hour delay before she eventually arrived more than three hours late. If this were any other designer, editors would be fuming, loudly staging a mass walk-out. Instead, they were happily shopping. When the fashion world’s harshest critics begin purchasing straight from the rails, it’s a sure sign that Rihanna has another hit on her hands. The collection – two years in the making and priced from 200 Euros for a white, waist-cinched T-shirt up to around 1,100 Euros for a reversible parka – is a round-up of the kind of clothes Rihanna wanted to have in her own wardrobe but couldn’t find. “I often walk into stores and I’m like, ‘I love this, but I wish it was more like that, or in a different colour or in a different fabric’ – and now I get to do it,” she said, dressed in Fenty’s tailored white blazer-minidress hybrid. Highlights included strong-shouldered corseted trouser suits sold with matching bum-bags, mannish cotton shirting, and multi-pocketed oversized jackets in Japanese raw denim. “I love strong silhouettes, and for women to look confident, that’s what I want to achieve with this collection,” she said. The debut extends, too, to accessories, from point-toe strappy sandals in zingy and neutral hues, to statement shield sunglasses, and bold architectural jewellery in polished gold with crystal pave. “I always had a love of fashion and style,” she explained, adding, “I loved everything my mum wore, from her make-up to her clothing...” I ask what her mum’s style was like. “Oh, she was bad ass. She wore a lot of oversized stuff but still very feminine, I just wanted to be her.” Of course, this isn’t her first foray into fashion. The 31-year-old was creative director of women’s collections for Puma, and she has designed lingerie under the Savage x Fenty moniker. But this is her first experience of working in the luxury sector. “We’re using the best fabrics I’ve ever encountered; everything is so well made. We want the best quality and we want to make something that someone can have forever. I know what’s gone into the making of every single piece.” She’s tried and tested everything herself and says there is a big emphasis on fit. “I’m a curvy girl, if I can’t wear my stuff then it just won’t work. I need to see how it looks on my hips, on my thighs, on my stomach – does it look good on me or only on a fit model? It’s important.” She’s also re-writing the way things are done at LVMH. Fenty represents the first major fashion brand that the conglomerate has founded from scratch – not to mention the first luxury fashion brand helmed by a black woman. And, by offering this collection as a direct-to-consumer retail model with new pieces arriving on a 6-8 week basis, she’s also changing up the fashion production schedule. The first instalment goes on sale on Fenty.com on May 29; the next instalment launches at the end of June. “There is no six-month wait, you get it when you see it,” she said. “There’s no tease. You see it, love it, and want it and that’s because I’m like that, I want things right away – I see designers’ new season [products] and I’m like, ‘Look 11, I need that!’” She laughed. “It’s frustrating when you can’t buy straight away.” The retail strategy is a first for the luxury conglomerate. “I really appreciate that LVMH is flexible enough to allow me to have a different perspective on how I want to release things,” she said adding, “Mr. Arnault [Bernard Arnault, chairman and CEO, LVMH] is not an idiot, he’s a very smart man and he’s open.” She hopes the customers will be open, too. “There is huge diversity in the collection, which you will see as the new pieces come out, because that’s my style,” she said. “I’m all over the place, in sweats one day and a dress the next.” She promises streetwear elements but executed in a luxurious way. Likewise, Rihanna hopes that men will shop from the collection, too. (British Vogue’s Editor-in-Chief, Edward Enninful, purchased the reversible tan and black parka for himself.) “I like to wear men’s clothes, I don’t like to say, ‘It’s a man’s thing or a woman’s thing.’ I hope men and women just wear it because they love it.” With everything she’s achieved – eight critically acclaimed albums, 14 US No.1 singles, sell-out tours, nine Grammys, and the not so small matter of her ground-breaking, million-dollar Fenty Beauty line (and its 40 shades of foundation which literally turned the cosmetics world on its head) – does she still feel pressure to out-perform, to do better? “I feel pressure in everything, of course. I care to make it the best and present it in the best way, there is pressure every single second, I feel it… not like crumbling pressure,” she laughed, “but fearlessness is a façade.” It’s clear Rihanna isn’t one to take stock of her successes and she doesn’t seem the reflective type. But you get the sense that she acknowledges the gravitas of this partnership with LVMH. “Personally, for me as an immigrant moving to America; that’s a big journey for me to even get here to Paris. And that’s something I celebrate and embrace,” she said. “I just want to make my boss proud,” she said, referring to Arnault. If the number of editors leaving here with Fenty purchases are any kind of signifier, that’s already a done deal.
