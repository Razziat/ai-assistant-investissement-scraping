"Luxury Web Battle Looms as LVMH, Hugo Boss Develop E-Commerce - The Business of Fashion","Mon, 05 Oct 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzb2ZmYXNoaW9uLmNvbS9uZXdzL2x1eHVyeS9sdXh1cnktd2ViLWJhdHRsZS1sb29tcy1hcy1sdm1oLWh1Z28tYm9zcy1kZXZlbG9wLWUtY29tbWVyY2Uv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS, France — As department stores and publishers join the ranks of those offering luxury goods online, they're running into a new breed of competitor: makers of the designer clothing, handbags and accessories they sell.

The shift is making the Internet look more like the real world. Department stores, after all, compete with shops owned by the likes of Gucci and Fendi and have seen their share of luxury sales erode in recent years as brands opened outlets from Beijing to Bogota.

The same dynamic is starting to play out online. LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE and German fashion label Hugo Boss AG are shifting more resources to e-commerce as growth in China slows. That's setting luxury-goods makers on a collision course with Web distributors and could result in more deals like Yoox's merger with Net-a-Porter. The new company starts trading Monday.

It’s shaping up to be an “online luxury turf war,” said John Guy, an analyst at Mainfirst AG. “The level of competition is increasing.”

In the past year, a half-dozen or so companies have raised funds or reorganized to sell luxury goods online. Galeries Lafayette, the French department-store chain, plans to double profit by 2020 by becoming an “omnichannel” retailer. Conde Nast Inc., the publisher of Vogue magazine, is rebooting fashion-review site style.com to sell luxury products.

The online push has already spurred consolidation. Department-store chain Neiman Marcus Group Inc. last year bought fashion retailer Mytheresa.com. Yoox's union with Net-a-Porter will create the world's largest luxury Web retailer. More deals will likely follow because distributors need scale to survive, said Luca Solca, an analyst at Exane BNP Paribas.

They’re all seeking to capture more Web sales of luxury goods, which brokerage Sanford C. Bernstein predicts will grow at more than twice the pace of the overall luxury market, to 27 billion euros ($30 billion) through 2019.

Until recently, luxury companies like Giorgio Armani and Valentino tended to outsource e-commerce because of the cost and complexity of selling online. Burberry Group Plc bucked the trend, keeping its online operations in-house. E-commerce accounts for about 10 percent of the company's retail sales.

Now LVMH and Hugo Boss are going it alone online as well. In September, LVMH Chairman Bernard Arnault hired a senior executive from Apple Inc. to spearhead his company's digital push, and earlier this year acquired a minority stake in Lyst, an aggregator of luxury e-commerce sites. Hugo Boss, meanwhile, is investing in technology to let clients order online and pick up their suits, ties and shoes from its outlets.

“The industry is finally moving from dipping their toes in online to jumping into the pool,’’ said Bernstein analyst Mario Ortelli.

While Ortelli estimates as much as 9 percent of luxury sales will take place online by the end of the decade, almost double last year’s share, the Internet isn’t just a battleground for revenue. As more shoppers turn to mobile devices to browse and buy, the Web is key for capturing customer data.

That helps explain why Fendi, one of LVMH's 15 fashion and leather-goods brands, built its own e-commerce site this year. To give customers the flexibility to order how and where they want, ""there was only one answer, which was doing it alone,"" said Fendi Chief Executive Officer Pietro Beccari.

Luxury brands will likely continue to sell via third-party websites, just as they work with department stores because they help reach customers who wouldn’t necessarily come to their outlets. Some will still rely on outsiders to manage their Web business.

As the battle lines get drawn between suppliers and distributors, a far bigger combatant lurks in the background -- Amazon.com Inc., which has bulked up its fashion offer as it seeks more affluent customers.

""The big gorillas are entering into our space,"" Johann Rupert, chairman of Cie. Financiere Richemont SA, which will own 50 percent of Yoox Net-a-Porter, said last month. ""If you want to play in that field, you have to have size.""

Luxury goods group LVMH says slowdown in China has affected sales - The Guardian,"Tue, 13 Oct 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9mYXNoaW9uLzIwMTUvb2N0LzEzL2x2bWgtdGhpcmQtcXVhcnRlci1yZXN1bHRzLWNoaW5hLXNsb3dkb3duLWFmZmVjdGVkLXNhbGVzLWdyb3d0aC1sb3Vpcy12dWl0dG9u0gF9aHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAudGhlZ3VhcmRpYW4uY29tL2Zhc2hpb24vMjAxNS9vY3QvMTMvbHZtaC10aGlyZC1xdWFydGVyLXJlc3VsdHMtY2hpbmEtc2xvd2Rvd24tYWZmZWN0ZWQtc2FsZXMtZ3Jvd3RoLWxvdWlzLXZ1aXR0b24?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LVMH has became the first major luxury goods provider to say the stock market collapse in China over the summer has affected sales, particularly at its flagship Louis Vuitton brand.

The world’s biggest luxury group, which owns more than 70 brands including the jeweller Bulgari and the fashion labels Fendi and Celine, said on Tuesday that it had seen spending growth rates by Chinese buyers slow down more abroad than at home.

Jean-Jacques Guiony, the chief financial officer, told an investor conference call on third-quarter sales: “The Chinese stock market collapse has taken its toll and we expect this to have an impact only for a few months.

“We are seeing more Chinese tourists but they are spending a little bit less, that is … the growth rate is not as high as it was in the first half.”

LVMH shares fell more than 3% on Tuesday after the Paris-based group said comparable sales growth at its key fashion and leather goods division had slowed more than analysts expected to 3% in the third quarter, down from 10% in the previous three months.

Louis Vuitton accounts for the bulk of the division’s sales and profits, and Guiony said the brand’s growth was “not very far away” from that of the division as a whole during the period.

Chinese consumers, the world’s biggest luxury buyers, have been increasingly shopping abroad to save money. But retailers surveyed by Reuters last month said the stock market collapse had not yet affected revenue.

Guiony said jewellery sales, which represented about a third of the group’s watch and jewellery unit, benefited from strong demand at Bulgari in all regions, and from local consumers as well as tourists.

He forecast that it would take a few seasons to turn around the fashion brands Marc Jacobs and DKNY, which are in the middle of a thorough reorganisation.

More positively, Guiony said cognac and spirits sales to Chinese consumers had rebounded in the third quarter and remained strong in the US, generating a 23% rise in like-for-like sales during the period.

“We are reasonably optimistic that the rest of the year will be better than what we have seen in the first half,” Guiony told investors about cognac sales, adding that the business showed no sign of slowing down in the US.

LVMH reported a 16% increase in total revenues to €8.58bn (£6.4bn) for the third quarter on Monday, as the weak euro and strong sales in its wines and spirits division – home to brands including Moët and Hennessy – more than made up for slower growth in the fashion business."

Why Isn't There an Italian LVMH? - The Business of Fashion,"Tue, 20 Oct 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzb2ZmYXNoaW9uLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy9maW5hbmNlL3doeS1pc250LXRoZXJlLWFuLWl0YWxpYW4tbHZtaC0yL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LONDON, United Kingdom — Gucci, Pucci, Armani, Versace — list a few of the world-famous brands that Italy has produced and, while sounding like a Kanye West song, you are reminded just how much the country contributes to global fashion and luxury. The southern European state has nine brands that report over €1 billion in revenue. That figure is set to jump to 12 when Valentino, Versace and Salvatore Ferragamo cross that revenue threshold, as expected.

Despite this high density of billion-euro brands, Italy is yet to produce a conglomerate of the scale of LVMH, which reported revenues of €30.6 billion (about $34.7 billion) — €10.8 billion of which derives from fashion and leather goods — while Richemont and Kering reported €10.4 billion and €10 billion respectively in 2014.

While all four of the Italian analysts and executives interviewed for this article raised the national psyche as a factor, the primary reason Italy lacks a conglomerate of scale is far more prosaic. “The French are over-weighted on accessories; Italian brands are more focused on ready-to-wear. Accessories was the part of the market that increased the most in the last years, and the product with the higher gross margin, which gives a significant competitive advantage to the French companies,” says Mario Ortelli, a senior analyst at Bernstein.

“When you look at conglomerates in the luxury goods industry, they were built either in hard luxury like Cartier, or in soft luxury like Vuitton, but in accessories. [To build a group] I think you really need one core business and one core brand that is very profitable, very healthy and very robust. At the heart of any of those groups, you find one mega brand: Gucci at the heart of Kering, Vuitton at LVMH and Cartier at Richemont,” says Luca Solca, head of luxury goods at Exane BNP Paribas. The two French conglomerates now own four of Italy’s nine billion-euro brands arguably big enough to act as a “core” brand. LVMH owns Bulgari and Fendi; Kering: Gucci and Bottega Veneta.

Businesses of the necessary scale to constitute a ""core brand"" are few and far between, a fact illustrated by Prada in 1999. With revenues just below €700 million, Prada began a brief but ambitious acquisition strategy, which saw it buy Jil Sander, Church's and Helmut Lang, while taking interests in Gucci and Fendi.

“Building a conglomerate with smaller brands, or weak-ish brands, is not really a successful proposition. If your core business is not very robust, you risk taking your eye off the ball, without adding value through your acquisitions. The attempt of Prada to diversify was carried out at time when Prada was not strong enough as a brand — it would be possibly a different kettle of fish today,” says Solca. “If it’s a $20 million business or if its $200 million — it takes the same amount of time, on the creative, on the commercial.’

For a conglomerate in a fixed cost industry such as fashion, advantages of scale are significant in making efficiencies. “The most important synergies come from the location and rental costs negotiations, as well as [negotiations] with publishers and organisations on advertising. Another [advantage] is having all of the brands [synced] to your digital presence — and a deeper bench when it comes to talent along with better access to the financial markets. Today you probably start to make a difference when you get closer to the €5 to €10 billion in revenue,” says Solca.

The advantages are also compound. Bolt-on acquisitions available to €5 to €10 billion businesses distort the playing field considerably. “If you look at LVMH, it was almost an afterthought for it to acquire a company like Loro Piana, because it doesn’t take much when you look at their cash flow. A company can use scale as a spring board to consolidate the industry and buy up smaller players of value and promise,” continues Solca.

Since many Italian companies are still comparatively young — the majority were created after WWII, most after 1975 — they are still led by their founders, or their founder’s relatives. Founding designers tend to be more rigid in their practices and far less prone to group integration. “On the other hand, if you manage a leather goods brand, or a jewellery brand, you are typically more of a business-mind, and as a consequence, I think you have more of the preparation and adaptability to build a business rather than a single brand,” says Solca.

“Companies like Prada, Max Mara or Diesel could potentially aspire to be aggregators in their own right,” Solca continues. “It is going to be an uphill struggle though, because the delay that has accumulated against European players is very significant and it is very difficult to catch up at this point,” says Solca.

Having chosen organic growth strategies, Armani, Salvatore Ferragamo, Dolce & Gabbana and Ermenegildo Zegna seemingly do not have the ambition to drive the expansion of an Italian group. Even Prada is now focused on its remaining portfolio: “sister-brand” Miu Miu and shoemaker Church's. The Tods Group, consisting of Hogan, Fay and Roger Vivier, “can make probably just a limited acquisition in footwear,” believes Ortelli.

""The only attempt we are seeing right now, of a company that has an appeal for acquisition, which is still on a scale that is by far smaller than French competitors, is OTB, the group of Mr Renzo Rosso, who owns Diesel, and has, for example, recently bought Marni along with other brands,"" says Ortelli. OTB also owns Maison Margiela, Viktor & Rolf and Staff International, a manufacturer of garments for Marc Jacobs, DSquared2 and Just Cavalli.

“We don't want to become another LVMH or Kering — our goal is not to be the biggest, but to become the coolest. The size of Marni was around €120 million [when we bought it] so it was not a small company, but had the scale and opportunity to grow up to [become] one of the big players in the luxury industry. That is where it’s easy for us to play. It is a size that is achievable for our strengths and finances,” says Stefano Rosso, chief executive of OTB, the private group, founded by his father Renzo, which generated revenues of €1.6 billion in 2013.

“At the stage where we are, we are not thinking of IPOs. If there were other opportunities for acquisitions, we would probably go after them. However, we do not have an urge to buy; it has to make sense with the development strategy of the group. We think we can double our size without crazy investments that will make us go to the market for financial resources. For us, it’s not as easy as for the big French groups. The financial strength they have is much bigger, but not needing to have a nice number every quarter for the public and your investors is a big relief and allows us to do what we believe in,” says Rosso.

The financial might of LVMH is a massive advantage. In 2011, in a move that enabled it to move into the jewellery market, the French luxury conglomerate bought Bulgari for €3.7 billion —paying a 60 percent premium on its closing share price of the previous day.

According to analysts, the opportunity to create an Italian conglomerate of scale is dwindling. In the next few years, instead of being consolidators within the market, Italian brands will be targets from the big global groups outside of it. ""We expect an M&A wave. The luxury conglomerates will be the first agents of consolidation, and mainly focused on the big brands, because they can extract the synergies and the financial investment,"" says Ortelli. These synergies in HR, legal, accounts, digital and logistics are significant. Pierre Godé, LVMH Chairman Bernard Arnault's ""right hand man,"" gave up his role as vice-chairman of LVMH to take up an operational role overseeing these synergies in the group's Italian businesses: Bulgari, Acqua di Parma, Fendi and Pucci.

What's more, any aspiring Italian aggregator group must compete with private equity funds, which have been increasingly active in the Italian market. The Carlyle Group recouped six times their initial investment when Moncler went public in 2013. Mayhoola's buyout of Valentino ushered in a period of dramatic growth for the Roman house, with revenues rising from $230 million in 2009 to $700 million in 2014. Versace has hit its stride since Blackrock bought 20 percent of the company in 2014. ""And earlier this year, Clessidra acquired Cavalli, in a deal valuing the business just below €1 billion."" The absence of an Italian group of consequentially enough scale to offer some form of protection from the French and private equity is being felt.

Solca believes the formation of such a group has never been harder: “The delay in building scale is now significant — the disparity [in scale with conglomerates] staggering,” However, Rosso, arguably Italy’s only realistic hope of a champion is more positive: “I truly believe is there is space for an Italian group to emerge, and Italian buying Italian companies culturally makes sense — for sure.”"
LVMH And HEC Paris Tie-Up Illustrates Demand For Luxury Brand Managers - BusinessBecause,"Thu, 01 Oct 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzYmVjYXVzZS5jb20vbmV3cy9tYmEtam9icy8zNDk3L2x2bWgtYW5kLWhlYy1wYXJpcy1pbi1sdXh1cnktdGllLXVw0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Luxury goods conglomerate on lookout for future business leaders

Luxury group LVMH and French business school HEC Paris have announced plans to create a teaching and research program dedicated to luxury brand management.

The tie-up highlights the growing need for trained talent in luxury, a sector where there is a historical tension between creatives and executives.

For LVMH, owner of brands Louis Vuitton, Berluti and Christian Dior, the deal is an opportunity to engage directly with an international pool of potential recruits.

Chantal Gaemperle, group executive VP for human resources, said LVMH “offers career opportunities that students are not always aware of”.

She added: “Our customer advisors, buyers, visual merchandisers, trainers and managers are the front-line ambassadors of our houses.”

LVMH already has long-term partnerships with leading global schools, including ESSEC Business School in Paris, Bocconi in Milan, Central Saint Martins in London, and Parsons in New York.

This HEC Paris agreement deepens the presence of LVMH in the education sector in a bid to prepare students for the careers available in luxury.

The Chair for General Management and Retail Excellence will train future luxury business leaders in every aspect of the industry, from sales and merchandising to logistics.

It will give students in the program access to “unique career opportunities”. Other business schools say there are job opportunities emerging in luxury.

Luana Carcano, director of the luxury business management MBA track at SDA Bocconi School of Management, said: “There is always space for well-trained and passionate professionals.”

Angelo Manaresi, director of the MBA in Design, Fashion and Luxury Goods at Bologna Business School, said that the big luxury groups are “still hiring the most from the good business schools”.

He added: “But in the last few years medium and sometimes smaller firms have hired people with stronger managerial education, as they realize that they need to look out of the domestic market to address growing transnational luxury segments.”

LVMH joins the increasing number of luxury brands to develop partnerships with top business schools.

London Business School recently developed a second program in luxury management with Walpole, an organization comprising more than 170 British luxury brands.

LBS will also work with executives at Diageo, the world's biggest distiller which produces Smirnoff vodka, and fashion house Alexander McQueen.

ESCP Europe Business School last year established a Fashion and Luxury Chair to drive digital innovation in the industry.

And SDA Bocconi runs a course developed with Bulgari, the luxury jewellery brand."

The brand's parent company, LVMH (LVMHF), said it was seeing slower spending growth from Chinese buyers.

""This is obviously connected with what happened in China in July and August in the stock market,"" CFO Jean-Jacques Guiony told investors. ""We know perfectly well that when asset depreciation of such a magnitude takes place, this has an impact on our business, and China was no exception...the drop in the stock market has taken its toll.""

The company also reported overall sluggish sales growth in its key fashion division, but fared better in its wine and spirits business.

China's broader economic slowdown and a government anti-corruption campaign has hit luxury spending in recent years. While LVMH held strong for some time, it turns out that even the world's largest luxury company isn't immune to troubles in China.
