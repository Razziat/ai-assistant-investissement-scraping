Jonathan William Anderson, 29, who graduated from the London College of Fashion just eight years ago, will also become creative director of LVMH's Spanish leather brand Loewe as part of the deal, the terms of which were undisclosed.

Anderson, who was born in Northern Ireland and works out of a small studio in Dalston, east London, said: ""LVMH has the resources and expertise in sharp, modern luxury and I believe we can work together to create something new. I am equally thrilled to join the house of Loewe, one of the oldest leather-goods houses in the world, where I have found an exceptional craftsmanship.""

Pierre-Yves Roussel, chairman and chief executive of LVMH Fashion Group, said: ""When Delphine Arnault [LVMH executive and daughter of Bernard Arnault, LVMH's multi-billionaire boss] and I first met Jonathan, we immediately felt that we could help him express the full potential of his innovative, fast-emerging and already influential brand.""

Anderson is the second British designer bought up by LVMH in the past few days, following its purchase of a majority stake in shoe designer Nicholas Kirkwood last weekend. Kirkwood's shoes, which start at about £500 a pair, have celebrity admirers including Alexa Chung and Sarah Jessica Parker."
Succession Planning at LVMH | BoF - The Business of Fashion,"Mon, 30 Sep 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzb2ZmYXNoaW9uLmNvbS9uZXdzL25ld3MtYW5hbHlzaXMvYXJuYXVsdC1waXRzLXNvbi12ZXJzdXMtZGF1Z2h0ZXItaW4tbHZtaC1zdWNjZXNzaW9uLXRlc3QtcmV0YWlsL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS, France — Two years ago, Bernard Arnault asked his son Antoine to run shoemaker Berluti, then this month he installed his daughter, Delphine, as executive vice president of Louis Vuitton. While her brief is to revive the handbag maker and Antoine's task is to transform Berluti into a menswear titan, Arnault is auditioning both for another job: his own.

At 64, the chief executive officer of LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SA, already qualifies for his state pension. He hasn’t signaled he’s tiring of running the world’s largest luxury-goods company, but “at some point there is an element of succession that needs to take place,” said Berenberg analyst John Guy. Giving his children greater responsibility allows Arnault to test them, Guy said.

Arnault knows a thing or two about fomenting rivalries. He was invited into LVMH in the 1980s by Henry Racamier, an heir to Vuitton, who was feuding with another faction in the company. Arnault helped Racamier see off his chief rival, then ousted Racamier and took over the bag maker.

This time, France’s wealthiest man — who has built LVMH into a luxury behemoth offering more than 60 brands from Krug champagne to Tag Heuer watches — is pitting members of his own family against one another. Arnault, who controls 46.5 percent of the voting rights in LVMH, has said he expects a relative to replace him.

Huge Endorsement

The billionaire turned down an interview request via a spokesman. LVMH shares have climbed 5.2 percent this year, trailing the Bloomberg European Fashion Index’s 14 percent gain.

Delphine, 38, is shaping up as the more likely successor of the two, according to Luca Solca, an analyst at Exane BNP Paribas. While Berluti is important, it’s less so than Vuitton, which accounts for more than half of LVMH’s 5.9 billion euros of profit, Solca said.

Her appointment at the handbag maker, which stages its women’s fashion show this week, is “a huge endorsement” for the top job, the analyst said.

Others are betting on Antoine. Delphine’s job at Vuitton has more to do with signaling to investors Arnault’s commitment to reviving the fading brand, according to Mario Ortelli, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein. Antoine, 36, is more likely to replace his father because he has better people management skills, the analyst said.

Extrovert, Introvert

“Antoine is more extrovert. Delphine is more introvert,” Ortelli said. “Delphine can have a very important role but more in the way of a shareholder or chairman, not a manager. Antoine can be the face of the group.”

Delphine and Antoine differ as much as the tasks their father has asked them to do, according to people who have worked with them. The siblings declined to be interviewed for this story.

Delphine Arnault, who studied at EDHEC Business School in France and at the London School of Economics, is reserved, shrewd and fashion-savvy, according to three people who asked not be identified out of concern for their working relationship with her. She joined her father's company in 2000 after a stint at McKinsey & Co. and was named to LVMH's board in 2003.

Until June, Delphine worked as deputy managing director of Christian Dior Couture. In her five years in the post, the label’s sales climbed 67 percent to 1.28 billion euros, more than double the total industry growth rate, according to consultant Bain & Co.

Exclusive Dior

At Vuitton she's overseeing all product-related activities as sales slow from Barcelona to Beijing. Delphine's experience at the more-exclusive Dior brand will help move Vuitton upscale, Vuitton CEO Michael Burke said in a statement when she was appointed.

LVMH, which doesn’t break out revenue by brand, in April posted its weakest fashion and leather-goods sales growth since 2009. Vuitton revenue reached about 7.3 billion euros in 2012, accounting for more than 70 percent of sales at the fashion and leather goods division, HSBC estimates.

Antoine Arnault is more gregarious. An accomplished poker player — his winnings exceed $600,000, according to Pokerpages.com — he appears regularly in the media, from Paris Match to The New York Times's style magazine. And he dates model Natalia Vodianova, the face of Guerlain perfume and Etam lingerie.

Mikhail Gorbachev

Antoine, who joined LVMH in 2002 after studying at Insead and HEC Montreal, knows how to connect and empathize with people, according to Concetta Lanciaux, a former director of human resources at LVMH who mentored him while she worked as an aide to his father. She now runs her own advisory firm.

“He has a real talent for image and communication,” Lanciaux said of Antoine, who became Vuitton’s director of communications in 2006, the same year he was named to LVMH’s board. His print ad campaign for Vuitton featuring Mikhail Gorbachev, Catherine Deneuve, Steffi Graff and Andre Agassi, won a Cannes Lion advertising award in 2008.

Since becoming chairman of Berluti, Antoine has hired a high-profile designer and acquired a Parisian tailor in a bid to make the shoemaker a menswear rival to Ermenegildo Zegna SpA and Brioni. He’s also spent heavily on marketing and opened stores from Miami to Shanghai.

Arnault in January said he expects his eldest son to lift Berluti revenue to “several hundred million euros,” though he set no deadline. The brand, which is unprofitable, had sales of about 90 million euros in 2012, Berenberg estimates.

Five Children

Antoine played an important role in LVMH’s 2 billion-euro acquisition of cashmere clothier Loro Piana SpA in July, according to a person familiar with the situation. He may soon start helping to manage the Italian company, the person said.

With three younger children, a nephew and a niece, Bernard Arnault has other potential successors, as well as non-family executives inside and outside LVMH.

“At least one of them will show themselves capable of taking over,” Arnault said of his kin in a documentary aired in February on France 5 television.

Antoine, at least, hasn’t excluded succeeding his father. “Perhaps. Who knows?” he told Bloomberg Pursuits magazine in 2012. “But not in the near future.”

The French luxury giant LVMH has swooped on another London Fashion Week star – the latest in a spate of British deals.

LVMH, which owns brands including Louis Vuitton, Moët & Chandon and Marc Jacobs, has bought a minority stake in fashion designer JW Anderson.

The deal will also see northern Irish born designer Jonathan W Anderson take on the role of creative director at LVMH’s Spanish leather brand Loewe. Mr Anderson succeeds Stuart Vevers, who left to join US brand Coach this year.

Mr Anderson, 29, studied at the London College of Fashion and started his career in 2008 in menswear before moving in to womenswear.

He said: “LVMH has the resources and expertise in sharp, modern luxury and I believe we can work together to create something new. I am equally thrilled to join the house of Loewe, one of the oldest leather-goods houses in the world, where I have found an exceptional craftsmanship.”

The investment by LVMH is the latest deal by a Paris based luxury group in London. It bought a majority stake in British shoe designer Nicholas Kirkwood this month while Gucci owner Kering bought a 51% stake in London based Christopher Kane at the start of the year. Large luxury groups are keen to snap up emerging talent to turn into the next “mega brand” as growth at their established names mature. London is seen as a key area for new designers."

Exact figures of the sale have not yet been released.

The deal will help the brand to expand on an international scale, while allowing the eponymous designer to focus on the creative aspect of the business. Speculation about the acquisition first emerged in March this year.

""It's with great excitement and pride that I enter this partnership,"" said Kirkwood. ""LVMH is home to the most celebrated and revered brands and talents in our industry, and has an implicit understanding of luxury. From my first meeting with Delphine Arnault and Pierre-Yves Roussel of LVMH, it was clear that LVMH would be the best partner for our brand, as we have the same values of design, creativity and craftsmanship.""

The luxury conglomerate - that counts Christian Dior, Louis Vuitton, Givenchy and Celine in its design stable - plans to concentrate on developing the retail strand of Kirkwood, as well as launching a handbag line. The transaction was said to have been spearheaded by Delphine Arnault, Vuitton's deputy general manager and also the daughter of LVMH boss Bernard Arnault.

""We are delighted to welcome Nicholas Kirkwood in the LVMH group,"" said Arnault. Nicholas's talent for shoe design is truly exceptional and I am especially impressed with his commitment to innovation and craftsmanship. Throughout our meetings, I was particularly struck by his entrepreneurship and discovered rapidly that we both discovered the same vision and beliefs.""

Kirkwood, a Central Saint Martins graduate, launched his label in 2005. His architectural, sculpted shoes have become a red-carpet favourite and have been worn by stars including Sarah Jessica Parker, Alexa Chung and Miranda Kerr. He has collaborated with labels such as Peter Pilotto, Erdem and Victoria's Secret, designing their respective catwalk shoes, and in 2010 was named the creative director of Italian brand Pollini - a position that he will continue to honour. In January this year, he won the BFC/Vogue Designer Fashion Fund and was awarded a £200,000 prize, in addition to business mentoring.

The news comes following a series of acquisitions of emerging labels by major luxury companies. Kering bought a majority stake in Christopher Kane in January, before investing a minority holding in Altuzarra earlier this month. The last brand to have sparked LVMH's interest was French designer Maxime Simoens, to which the firm offered financial backing in February.

LVMH has announced a new deal with 33-year-old British footwear designer Nicholas Kirkwood, which sees the French company take a majority stake in the business.

Sep 24, 2013 | By AFPRelaxnews

LVMH has announced a new deal with 33-year-old British footwear designer Nicholas Kirkwood, which sees the French company take a majority stake in the business.

Kirkwood’s distinctive designs are currently available in around 150 luxury stores around the world, including his recently opened Las Vegas flagship, and the young designer described himself as excited and proud to be entering into the venture: “LVMH is home to the most celebrated and revered brands and talents in our industry, and has an implicit understanding of luxury,” he explained.

“We discovered rapidly that we shared the same vision and beliefs,” said LVMH heiress Delphine Arnault, “we want to allow him to further explore the boundaries of his creativity while the brand will benefit from LVMH’s expertise”. So what’s the next step for Kirkwood? All signs point to a handbags and accessories collection.

Earlier this year LVMH also invested in young French ready-to-wear designer Maxime Simoens, part of a bigger trend for talent-spotting in the fashion industry.

In January this year Christopher Kane gained a giant boost when French luxury group Kering purchased 51% of the Scottish designer’s label. The French company then swooped again this month, taking a minority stake in Franco-American womenswear designer Joseph Altuzarra’s namesake label."
LVMH Strikes Deal with J.W.

Anderson and hired Jonathan Anderson, the label's fast-rising London-based designer, to take the creative helm at Loewe, an LVMH-owned brand based in Madrid and best known for its leather goods.

The exact size of the stake and financial terms were not disclosed.

""When Delphine Arnault and I first met Jonathan, we immediately felt that we could help him express the full potential of his innovative, fast emerging and already influential brand. While discussing our partnership and as we got to know him better, it became clear that his understanding of all creative facets of a brand and his capacity to transform tradition into an exciting vision for the present would make him also the perfect creative director for Loewe,"" said Pierre-Yves Roussel, chairman and CEO of LVMH's fashion division, in a statement.

“For me, the process that led to this exciting partnership has been a natural one,"" added Anderson. ""LVMH has the resources and expertise in sharp, modern luxury and I believe we can work together to create something new. I am equally thrilled to join the house of Loewe, one of the oldest leather-goods houses in the world, where I have found an exceptional craftsmanship combined with purity and lightness.”

Anderson, who was born in Northern Ireland and attended the London College of Fashion, has attracted considerable attention in recent seasons for his precise, ultra-modern approach to clothing, which often tests (and breaks) the traditional boundaries of gender.

“I am delighted to welcome Jonathan Anderson to Loewe to leverage the unique heritage of the house. His talent and his enthusiasm for the brand will definitely move Loewe forward to the next chapter of its history,” said Lisa Montague, chief executive of Loewe.

At Loewe, Anderson will succeed Stuart Vevers, who is exiting the Spanish brand after five years to join American accessories powerhouse Coach as the company's new executive creative director, replacing Reed Krakoff.

The current news comes only days after LVMH announced its decision to take a majority stake in London-based luxury footwear brand Nicholas Kirkwood.

And now come reports that David Bowie – fashion's favourite recluse – will appear in the brand's L'Invitation au Voyage campaign due to be released later this year.

Ground control to Major Tom jokes to be inserted here.

While representative for Bowie offered no comment on the story, and LVMH could not be reached, this is clearly a big deal – arguably on a par with the Anderson one. Since the David Bowie Is exhibition at the V&A this summer, the zeitgeist's gaze has been firmly focused on Bowie and his shape-shifting, visionary looks have been discovered by yet another generation.

Inside Sephora's Branded Beauty Strategy | BoF - The Business of Fashion,"Tue, 24 Sep 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzb2ZmYXNoaW9uLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy9uZXdzLWFuYWx5c2lzL21hcmMtamFjb2JzLXNlcGhvcmEtbHZtaC1icmFuZGVkLWJlYXV0eS1zdHJhdGVneS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"NEW YORK, United States — In the year leading up to the August 9th launch of Marc Jacobs Beauty, developed in collaboration with beauty retailer Sephora, the lauded American designer was generous with the press. Lengthy profiles appeared in outlets from New York magazine to Women's Wear Daily, in which Jacobs praised the line, declaring that he was ""surprised by how delighted I am with the results."" The collection of shiny lip vinyls, gel eyeliners and high-gloss nail polishes — comprising 122 skus (stock-keeping units) in total — was an instant hit with beauty magazine editors, offering the just right mix of compelling back story and appealing product to fill the pages of their September issues.

In contrast, Sephora was only briefly mentioned in these write-ups and the beauty retailer has declined to comment on the collaboration. That may be because Sephora Originals — the moniker under which Marc Jacobs Beauty sits — is part of a wider strategy for the company, which now operates stores in more than 30 countries and is seen as one of the LVMH group’s biggest drivers of growth.

Founded in 1969 by Dominique Mandonnaud and acquired by LVMH in 1997, Sephora’s rise is well-documented. Measured in terms of retail sales, it now commands a staggering 12 percent of the beauty market in the United States, 15 percent of the market in China and 27 percent of the market in its native France, according to Sanford C. Bernstein, a sell-side equity research firm. Bernstein says Sephora will push LVMH’s Selective Retailing division — which also includes the DFS Group — to sales of 14.7 billion euros (about $19.8 billion) by 2017, surpassing the conglomerate’s Fashion and Leather Goods division by 2018. (In 2012, Selective Retailing brought in 28 percent of LVMH sales, or 7.9 billion euros, while the Fashion and Leather Goods division brought in 35 percent of sales, or 9.9 billion euros).

Sephora’s ascent has a great deal to do with its unique approach to merchandising. Formatted like an apothecary but furnished like a nightclub, the chain has become known as a low-pressure, consumer-empowering alternative to traditional department store counters. At Sephora, customers can get their hands on high-end products without going through the rigid interactions that characterise beauty counters. The store’s fluid layout allows shoppers to hop from brand to brand, product to product, and test them out at their leisure. Makeup tutorials are available, but it’s on a opt-in basis. And critically, employees are not instructed to push one single brand.

Over the years, Sephora has also developed a reputation for championing niche lines, a segment of the market that has grown exponentially over the past decade, according to Karen Grant, global beauty industry analyst at Port Washington, NY-based market research firm NPD. “They’ve been able to take brands without a name, without a presence, and bring them to life,” Grant says, citing both Bare Essentials and Benefit (also owned by LVMH) as companies that were catapulted forward thanks to Sephora’s support. Vegan-makeup line Obsessive Compulsive Cosmetics and the argan oil-based skincare collection from model Josie Maran are two niche brands that have recently benefited from Sephora’s support.

But winning merchandising strategies and product development are two different things.

Sephora’s first foray into product development was its own private label, which currently includes over 700 skus. In 2010, the company launched Sephora Originals, a project akin to Target’s designer collaborations, except that these lines are devoid of Sephora branding. The first Originals line was created for Hello Kitty. Tarina Tarantino and Charlotte Ronson soon followed. (Tarantino’s line was discontinued at Sephora in 2012, but the accessories designer relaunched her namesake collection of lip glosses and shimmering face powders via her own e-commerce channels earlier this year.)

The Marc Jacobs collection is certainly the most high profile of the Originals projects yet and is projected to generate more than $20 million in North American sales in 2014. Crucially, it also marks the first time Sephora has tapped into parent company LVMH’s own stable of fashion brands to develop an entirely new offering.

“It’s the only way to really come into the [branded beauty] category strong,” says Mario Ortelli, senior luxury goods analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein. “I expect they will launch more lines with LVMH brands.”

For LVMH, at which synergies across brands have traditionally been limited to things like using reputation and collective buying power to negotiate better rates for media buys and retail rents, this would be an interesting move.

Marc Jacobs is already set to take the brand beyond Sephora stores, opening its own standalone beauty outpost on Bleecker Street in Manhattan’s West Village and offering select Marc Jacobs Beauty product at its existing clothing, books and accessories stores. (While the Bleecker Street boutique will be run entirely by Marc Jacobs, the product and marketing materials were produced in collaboration with Sephora — and the sales staff will receive the same training.)

Launching a standalone brand like Marc Jacobs Beauty means that slowly, but surely, Sephora is now competing directly with beauty behemoths like Estée Lauder and L'Oréal, which supply Sephora with some of its bestselling product lines, including Yves Saint Laurent and Lancôme. (""People are more willing to venture into niche brands today, but the big brands are still the big brands,"" says Grant.) But as the power of department store beauty counters wanes, the big beauty conglomerates have been more and more willing to play with Sephora.

""Right now, it is not very wise not to work with [Sephora],"" says Ortelli. While Estée Lauder-owned MAC Cosmetics has focused its strategy on standalone stores, the company's Clinique and Bobbi Brown brands are major Sephora staples. And Estée Lauder's designer lines created with Michael Kors and Tory Burch will almost certainly land on Sephora's shelves in the near future.

But unlike at department stores, neutral territory for cosmetics brands — the more brands pay, the better space they get — Sephora’s own lines are sure to receive top placement in its stores.

For now, the new Marc Jacobs collection represents just one small part of Sephora’s future prospects: the company’s long-standing mission is to bring relentless innovation to the way consumers shop for beauty, from new product lines to easier in-store checkout systems. “Sephora is never complacent,” says Grant.

“But the business will always be focused on the retail,” concludes Ortelli.

LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton has netted London fashion star J.W. Anderson, taking a minority stake in his fledgling business and tapping the designer to take the creative helm of Loewe.

Jonathan Anderson, head of the J.W.Anderson fashion label, has been named creative director at Loewe, replacing fellow Brit Stuart Vevers who left the Spanish label after nearly six years.

The deal will also see Loewe’s owner LVMH take a minority stake in the J.W.Anderson brand. This week the Paris-based luxury conglomerate, which owns Louis Vuitton, Givenchy and Fendi among others, announced that it had also invested in shoe designer Nicholas Kirkwood.

Luxury conglomerate LVMH has bought a minority stake in British label J.W. Anderson and named its eponymous designer creative director of luxury leather goods brand Loewe.

BY Bibby Sowray | 25 September 2013

It's a momentous day for young British designer Jonathan William Anderson; not only has he sold a minority stake in his eponymous label, J.W. Anderson, to LVMH, but he has been announced as the creative director of Loewe, one of the luxury conglomerate's flagship brands, too.

Rumours first circulated that Anderson was in talks with LVMH - which boasts the likes of Celine, Givenchy and Marc Jacobs in its fashion stable - in early September, just before he presented his spring/summer 2014 collection at London Fashion Week.

His appointment at Loewe comes as something as of a surprise. When outgoing creative director Stuart Vevers announced he would be leaving the storied Spanish fashion house to helm US mega-brand Coach in June, more experienced names, such as Mulberry's Emma Hill, were considered contenders for the high-profile job.

Speaking to WWD , Anderson called LVMH the ""Oxford University of luxury goods"" and outlined his wishes to grow his eponymous brand while injecting a ""new personality"" into Loewe, which is currently best known for its luxury leather goods.

The Northern Irish-born designer, 29, studied at the London College of Fashion before founding his own brand in 2008. He quickly became a favourite of fashion editors and won a legion of fans for his conceptual designs, such as his frilled 'skort' for men. Last year he released a much-lauded collaboration with Topshop, and was also signed up to design a capsule collection for Versace sister line Versus with Donatella Versace praising him as a great future talent."
Will Ghesquière replace Marc Jacobs at Louis Vuitton? - VOGUE India,"Mon, 30 Sep 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZvZ3VlLmluL2NvbnRlbnQvd2lsbC1uaWNvbGFzLWdoZXNxdWlyZS1yZXBsYWNlLW1hcmMtamFjb2JzLWxvdWlzLXZ1aXR0b27SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Well, we know what happened with the last designer shake-up rumour.

The latest gossip doing the rounds is that Marc Jacobs is set to depart from Louis Vuitton, with whom his contract comes to an end in 2014.

French publication Challenges claims that internally, LVMH has already approved Jacobs' move, while Reuters has an anonymous source purporting that Nicolas Ghesquière will be his replacement.

Speculation that Ghesquière would take up the top job at Louis Vuitton first arose in June this year. The fashion industry has been keenly waiting to hear on Ghesquière's next moves, and with his talent, critical acclaim and commercial success at Balenciaga, the coveted creative directorship at Louis Vuitton may be the right fit. Ghesquière has already been sighted having meals with LVMH executives, and after his well-placed words about Kering (which owns Balenciaga), a move to LVMH will be a very pointed slight to his former employer. Ghesquière is also good friends with Delphine Arnault, who is the daughter of Bernard Arnault, who owns LVMH. Delphine Arnault has been said to have a major part in securing Raf Simons at Dior as well as encouraging investment in young designers like JW Anderson and Nicholas Kirkwood.

Should Jacobs really be leaving Louis Vuitton, it will allow him more time to focus on his eponymous label and its diffusion line, Marc by Marc Jacobs. Marc by Marc Jacobs has also recently hired Katie Hillier and Luella Bartley for senior positions; [president of Marc Jacobs International Robert] Duffy explained it was because the line was ""getting a little stale"" and that they had rested on their laurels for too long. Time will tell.

5 Reasons We Shouldn't Take Our Eyes Off JW Anderson For One Second - Marie Claire UK,"Mon, 30 Sep 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5tYXJpZWNsYWlyZS5jby51ay9mYXNoaW9uL2x2bWgtc3dvb3BzLWluLWFuZC1zd2VlcHMtdXAtdGhlLWhvdHRlc3QtYnJpdC1kZXNpZ25lci1vZi10aGUtbW9tZW50LWp3LWFuZGVyc29uLXRvLWhlYWQtdXAtbG93ZS0xMDM5MjjSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"With the news that Loewe has snapped up London’s designer-of-the-moment as its Creative Director, we explain why JW Anderson is smokin' hot fashion property right now.

1. Despite the rumours, JW Anderson's appointment is a surprising one. Loewe’s old-school credentials had many critics guessing that the brand would plump for a more established designer to take the reigns. The Spanish leather house Loewe is owned by LVMH, who have followed fellow fashion super-conglomerate Kering, who earlier this year bought a stake in Christopher Kane. LVMH's shopping basket also includes shoe–king Nicholas Kirkwood as well as a minority stake in JW's own line.

JW Anderson

2. Actually called Jonathan William, the Northern-Irish designer studied at the London College of Fashion before forming his eponymous menswear label in 2008, and branching out to womenswear in 2010. This transition spurned JW’s signature style of wardrobe-sharing that sees him design pieces that are created for both women and men. JW’s highly conceptual designs and to-die-for stacked loafers always get the fashion pack in a flurry.

3. JW Anderson's first collaboration (spring/summer 2013) with high street giant Topshop was the most successful collab of all time. It had fashion editors chomping at the bit, and every style-savvy girl clad head-to-toe in his looks. There are rumours of a third line, so watch this space!

JW Anderson

4. During London Fashion Week, the city's hottest and coolest queued in the rain, and round the block, to get entry to JW Anderson's SS14 show.It was a barely-there collection that had a Japanese sensibility in the origami style dresses but also a sensuality, in the revealing cuts and ghost-like translucent fabrics.

JW Anderson

5. Earlier this year, JW created a capsule resort collection for Versus. The pieces were raw with 90s punk-grunge attitude. We saw slashed mini-dresses, cropped tops and details that gave a cheeky wink to Versace’s golden age - think Medusa heads and safety pins.

It's been an incredible year for JW Anderson and it promises to just get better. We say ‘bonne chance!’ to our Brit boy à la mode.

Paris Fashion Week: Carven spring/summer 2014 - Telegraph - fashion.telegraph.co.uk,"Thu, 26 Sep 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicmh0dHA6Ly9mYXNoaW9uLnRlbGVncmFwaC5jby51ay9jb2x1bW5zL2xpc2EtYXJtc3Ryb25nL1RNRzEwMzM2NDk5L1BhcmlzLUZhc2hpb24tV2Vlay1DYXJ2ZW4tc3ByaW5nc3VtbWVyLTIwMTQuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Paris Fashion Week: Carven spring/summer 2014

In a Paris fashion scene where big labels are dominated by foreign designers, Carven designer Guillaume Henry is looking increasingly like a powerhouse.

The French have a reputation for discerning shopping. They favour classics over ephemeral trends. This ought to stand as true for industry titans as it does for the chic French fashion customer.

So when those industry titans invest in British names, it stands to reason that they seek longevity. Earlier this year Kering, the French luxury conglomerate, bought 51 per cent of Scottish-born, London-based Christopher Kane. Last week LVMH, the even bigger French luxury conglomerate purchased 51 per cent of the Stowe-educated shoe designer Nicholas Kirkwood. And on Wednesday evening LVMH announced it has also taken a minority stake in Belfast born J.W. Anderson, whose sweeping, structured skirts and innovative knitwear have become highlights of the past few London Fashion Weeks.

READ THE PARIS FASHION WEEK BLOG

Perhaps 29-year-old Anderson had read Tom Ford's comments in last week's Daily Telegraph when he said he would not advise any young designer selling the majority slice of the business to anyone. Either way, this is how catwalk condiments become business meat and drink. What looks slight and insubstantial in a fashion show can, in skilled hands, be converted into commercial gold.

Carven is a case in point. Once best known for a blockbuster scent called Ma Griffe which it launched in 1948, it is now being re-tooled as one of the hottest fashion brands around. The man responsible is 35-year-old Guillaume Henry and prepare yourselves: he's French.

This is a fairly unusual state of affairs in Paris: a German heads up Chanel; a Belgian Dior; an American Louis Vuitton; Brits are in charge at Chloé and Céline… but Henry is looking increasingly like a powerhouse. His knack for turning dowager couture details - Granny pleasing cropped jackets in thick wools or shantung silk for instance - into waiting list hits seems to grow with each season. Carven's winter pastel coats are selling out as soon as they reach the stores.

For spring he's working the same trick, but with no sense of repetition. The two piece suit gets a fresh spin in heavy duty floral cottons, which Henry used for oversized bomber jackets and shorts, while raw silks were chopped into loose, collarless, Sixties-style coats and cocktail suits.

SEE THE CARVEN S/S 2014 SHOW

This is a designer unafraid to show clothes that will have broad appeal - and sell at prices that are this side of plausible. For every pair of shorts, there's a knee length pencil skirt in the same fabric, for every on-trend cocoon shape, a waist-accentuating dress.

""I like to dress every woman,"" he said backstage, adding that for spring he'd referenced ""the easy, uncontrived dressing of the Nineties"". Yes that's right. Some designers are so young, the Nineties seem historic.

Milan Fashion Week: Emporio Armani spring/summer 2014 - Telegraph - fashion.telegraph.co.uk,"Fri, 20 Sep 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicWh0dHA6Ly9mYXNoaW9uLnRlbGVncmFwaC5jby51ay9uZXdzLWZlYXR1cmVzL1RNRzEwMzIzNDAzL01pbGFuLUZhc2hpb24tV2Vlay1FbXBvcmlvLUFybWFuaS1zcHJpbmdzdW1tZXItMjAxNC5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Milan Fashion Week: Emporio Armani spring/summer 2014

79-year-old designer Giorgio Armani delivered plenty of wearble hits in his pastel-themed Emporio Armani show.

As befits his spot at the pinnacle of Milan's fashion Olympus, Giorgio Armani is never rushed into starting a show. Hence this morning his 600 strong audience had ample time to chew over hot news from London that the young shoe designer Nicholas Kirkwood has signed a deal Louis Vuitton Moet Hennessy. First Christopher Kane (who was part-bought by LVMH's 'rival' Kering), now Kirkwood - and with plenty of speculation still aswirl around J.W. Anderson and Erdem: London's youngsters, concurred that crowd, are stepping up.

Then with flick of the lights and a slow note of slide guitar the Emporio Armani show began. Giorgio Armani is to those young thrusters what The Rolling Stones are to this generation's bands; he started decades ago, has been on tour for years, and has an outrageous back-catalogue of hits.

READ: Giorgio Armani: I must do better

This was an Emporio show in which Armani delivered plenty of his trustily unimpeachable hits. There were soft-shouldered jackets, sometimes sharply notched, that fluted delicately at the skirt. In gentle greens, powdered pinks and baby blues these hovered north of double-pleated wide trousers (one slim pair elasticated at the ankle apart) that had a soft metallic sheen to them.

Sometimes single breasted and sharply notched, sometimes double breasted and Nehru-collared, they provided a structural counterpoint to the rustle below. Two braces (Armani's models often come out in pairs) of looks - one of jumpsuits another of skirts over trousers - featured leaf embroidered top-halves that were like looking up at the sky through a forest canopy. Instead of the usual Armani manes, all the girls wore tightly-wound, hair-pinned twists.

Another dip of the lights and the second act was underway. A brief hint at man-made geometry in two double layered white jackets peppered with black rectangles fast gave way to an extended floral tribute. Here more jackets, sometimes in seersucker and sometimes in summer light technical fabrics, were worn over floatily washed out flower-print fabric occasionally asymmetrically cut. A catwalk twosome wore mid-thigh tunic tops over loosely moving trousers, each with a handbag of fly-screen-fine green gauze.

The final movement of this entertaining tour through next summer Emporio shifted to evening wear with two one-shouldered, spaghetti strap dresses in silver. Two suits, one green, one blue, came in vertical stripes and a series of many-tiered, chiffon-light, and knee-length party dresses had six inch cuffs with Armani's season-signature floral at the neckline. A group of three dresses appeared to have been spliced together from white lace fans. The finale dress was a sparkler of blushingly-pink beading with a turquoise slash at the waistline.

A the end, Mr Armani mixed up his routine a bit - instead of taking a half-bow 25 of his 2014 Emporio girls lined up alongside him."
Charles & Keith: From Pasir Ris to Paris - Mothership.sg,"Wed, 04 Sep 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiLGh0dHBzOi8vbW90aGVyc2hpcC5zZy8yMDEzLzA5L2NoYXJsZXMta2VpdGgv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Did you know that homegrown ladies footwear and accessories brand Charles & Keith is 20% owned by luxury goods group LVMH (Louis Vuitton Moet Hennessy)? LVMH acquired the stake in Charles & Keith for more than $30 million in 2010.

Kudos to Singaporean labels!

Charles & Keith has begun to make waves internationally. A first for the local label, Charles & Keith staged a fashion show to launch their Fall 2013 Collection at Ngee Ann City Civic Plaza. Shows that have been staged there include Audi Fashion Festival and Singapore JewelFest.

I remember a time when Charles & Keith catered to heartland housewives and like. Can't believe how far they have come! Today, Charles & Keith has 390 stores in Asia, the Middle East, Europe and Africa. A vast improvement from its humble beginnings of one store at Amara Shopping Centre in 1996.

The secret to their success? Borrowing styles straight off the runway. There was this exact moment a few years back when I walked past one of their stores and noticed Brian Atwood and Christian Louboutin designs in the display window. That was when I realised Charles & Keith was ready to take on the international fashion stage.

More importantly, Charles & Keith is doing its part to support local talent. It is one of the local firms to award scholarships to candidates under IE Singapore's Young Talent Programme, to help groom local talents for global roles.

Charles Wong, the Managing Director of Charles & Keith, won the ASEAN Youth Award 2005 for his contributions in promoting youth employability in 2006. Charles & Keith provided support to students, young designers and young graduates through internships, product sponsorships and career opportunities.

Eager, roaring, and ready to spend, Charles & Keith spared no expense on their latest fashion show. The star-studded event was graced by local celebrities such as Fann Wong and Zoe Tay, and international celebrities. The list includes our first Asian Victoria's Secret Model Liu Wen, and K-Pop sensations Korean-American actor Daniel Henney and the girls from SNSD Girls' Generation. Charles & Keith even flew in famous fashion bloggers Bryan Boy and Han Huo Huo business class with Singapore Airlines just for this event.
