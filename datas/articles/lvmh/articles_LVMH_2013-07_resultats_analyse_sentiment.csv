LVMH Takes Majority Stake in Loro Piana - WWD,"Mon, 08 Jul 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3dkLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy1uZXdzL21lcmdlcnMtYWNxdWlzaXRpb25zL2x2bWgtdGFrZXMtbWFqb3JpdHktc3Rha2UtaW4tbG9yby1waWFuYS03MDQ0NDYyL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"MILAN — Loro Piana, a prized Italian firm that combines exclusive craftsmanship and technology, is entering the LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton luxury sphere. The French giant is buying an 80 percent stake in Loro Piana for 2 billion euros, or $2.56 billion at current exchange. The enterprise value totals 2.7 billion euros, or $3.4 billion. Brothers Sergio and Pier Luigi Loro Piana will continue to helm the firm and maintain a 20 percent stake. Antitrust clearance is expected in the fourth quarter, followed by the official closing.

Chairman Pier Luigi Loro Piana said, “The Loro Piana family is proud that our name is now associated with the LVMH group. Under Bernard Arnault’s leadership, LVMH has proved that it respects and nurtures family businesses and is most likely to respect the values and traditions of our maison, as well as our desire to provide our clientele with unparalleled quality.”

Sergio Loro Piana, chief executive officer, added, “By joining LVMH, a group built around a unique set of other historic maisons, Loro Piana will benefit from exceptional synergies while preserving its traditional heritage.” Until now, the two brothers rotated their posts on a three-year basis.

LVMH chairman Bernard Arnault said, “Loro Piana is an exceptionally rare maison, rare in the unique quality and craftsmanship in its products, not least in cashmere and fine textiles, but also in the unbroken heritage and careful family husbandry over six generations.” Arnault said he was “very pleased” that the Loro Pianas believed the LVMH group “is best able to ensure the future” of their firm. “Indeed, we share the same values — family and craftsmanship allied to the tireless pursuit of quality — and I am convinced that our group will prove a good home in realizing the significant future potential of Loro Piana.”

In a document released upon the announcement of the sale, Loro Piana was described as “the largest cashmere manufacturer and the biggest single purchaser of the world’s finest wools.” It also highlighted its unique brand equity, vertically integrated from access to the finest raw materials to distribution and an entirely made-in-Italy policy.

Based in Quarona, Italy, the company closed 2012 with sales of 630 million euros, or $806.4 million at average exchange, up 13.1 percent compared with the previous year. The firm is expected to close 2013 with sales of 700 million euros, or $898 million, with earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization representing more than 20 percent of sales.

During a conference call, LVMH identified leather goods as a chief avenue for future expansion, along with further retail inroads in Asia, particularly Mainland China and the Middle East.

Chief financial officer Jean-Jacques Guiony characterized Loro Piana as “a bit different from the other brands we have,” calling it a “well-kept secret” with more “understated marketing.”

The top-of-mind brands in LVMH’s fashion and leather goods division, which include Louis Vuitton, Fendi, Givenchy and Céline, are known for their star designers, big-budget runway shows and trendsetting fashions.

Guiony called Loro Piana a “well-managed” company in possession of a “good recipe for success.”

That said, he noted LVMH plans to leverage its expertise with leather goods to bring that product category above the single-digit percentage it represents today.

Questioned about LVMH’s acquisitions policy, Guiony described it in a word: opportunistic.

“We move when we find an exceptional brand and with which we feel we can do something,” he said. “This is an exceptional asset.”

Guiony said the group would likely divert some of the firm’s exceptional textiles and yarns to its own brands, while continuing to do business with third parties. He noted that the “bulk” of Loro Piana’s textiles and yarns business “counts as Italian sales.”

The transaction is the latest signal that Europe’s big luxury groups are keen to secure suppliers of the rare raw materials and technical know-how needed to make their high-margin products.

The quality attributes of luxury products — and not just design and prestige — is becoming a primary talking point for consumers and investors alike.

In March, Kering, the French parent of brands including Bottega Veneta, Gucci and Brioni, acquired a majority stake in Normandy-based crocodile tannery France Croco. And last October, Chanel acquired Scottish cashmere specialist Barrie Knitwear.

Other key deals in the past year include Hermès Cuirs Précieux, the tannery division of Hermès International, acquiring French calf leather specialist Tannerie d’Annonay; Compagnie Financière Richemont taking a 100 percent stake in Varin-Etampage and Varinor, a manufacturer of high-end, stamped exterior components for watches, a gold refiner and a producer of semifinished precious metal products for the watch and jewelry industry, and LVMH’s purchase of Les Tanneries Roux, a French producer of supple calf leathers.

According to sources, Antoine Arnault, son of Bernard Arnault and the ceo of Berluti, was instrumental in the Loro Piana deal, reflecting his rising stature within the world’s largest luxury group. It also suggests the young Arnault might leverage Loro Piana’s arsenal of plush and rare fabrics in his makeover of Berluti, an elite cobbler he is transforming into a lifestyle label with a complete ready-to-wear offer hinged on exceptional fabric research.

The Loro Piana family began trading wool and fine textiles at the beginning of the 19th century in Trivero, in northern Italy. Pietro Loro Piana founded the company as a wool mill in 1924 in the country’s Quarona. In the mid-Forties, Franco Loro Piana started exporting precious textiles outside of Italy, an activity further developed by his sons Sergio and Pier Luigi in the Seventies, when they started helming the firm and expanding into luxury retail operations.

The company offers exclusive men’s and women’s wear lines. It manufactures for its own use and supplies high-end garment manufacturers.

Loro Piana has for more than a decade awarded the World Wool Record Challenge Cup determining the world’s finest wool. Though the company has equally strong reputations in cashmere, vicuna and the lotus flower fabric, the Loro Piana contest spurs breeders to produce finer, higher-quality fiber each year.

This spring, Loro Piana acquired 60 percent of vicuna firm Sanin SA as part of the Italian group’s efforts to invest in the research and development of the finest yarns and fabrics. Sanin is an Argentinean company that owns the right to shear wild vicunas living on a territory of 210,000 acres in the province of Catamarca, Argentina.

The company established the Franco Loro Piana Reserve in the Lucana area in Peru in 2008 and has significantly contributed to saving vicunas from extinction.

Operating profit has grown from 24.7 million euros in 2009 to 97.9 million euros last year.

In 2012, exports accounted for 81 percent of sales. Excluding Italy, Europe accounted for 27 percent of total revenues and Asia for 30 percent of sales. China showed a 34 percent gain. North America accounted for 22 percent of sales, posting a 24 percent increase. “The U.S. market is very positive for us. In terms of the number of customers, Americans top the list, followed by the Chinese,” said Loro Piana in May, touting a balanced distribution of sales around the world. The group’s retail channel, which comprises over 130 stores, showed a 20 percent increase in 2012. There are 24 units in Japan, 31 in the rest of Asia and 21 venues in the U.S.

In terms of business divisions, textiles accounted for 32 percent of sales, and luxury goods for the rest.

LVMH said the 2 billion euro amount will be paid in 2013, financed by available cash and new debt. It also noted a limited impact on its debt profile and debt related ratios.

Citigroup analyst Thomas Chauvet wrote in a note that the sale “should be viewed as a positive, opportunistic deal for LVMH to acquire at a ‘reasonable price’ a niche, ultrahigh-end apparel brand with a lot of heritage, a sound management team and some strategic sourcing competencies. With midteens EBIT margins, we think Loro Piana has a potential to grow sales and EBIT significantly in the niche, fast-growing luxury daywear segment as well as creating some industrial synergies with the rest of LVMH’s Fashion & Leather brands (sourcing of textiles for Vuitton, Berluti).”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9487193822860718}",neutral,0.9487193822860718,0

The AMF began an investigation into LVMH’s purchase of stake in Hermes in 2010, and in April, announced that it found that LVMH had secretly bought shares in rival Hermès to build a stake in the iconic Paris-based design house, and not merely to make a financial investment as LVMH has claimed. LVMH denies that any insider trading and share price manipulation has taken place.

The sanctions committee’s decision is separate from the luxury rivals’ court proceedings. The two are currently embroiled in a bitter legal battle. Hermès filed a criminal complaint against LVMH in a Paris court in July 2012, accusing the luxury conglomerate of insider trading, collusion and manipulating stock prices. In September 2012, LVMH filed a counter complaint against Hermès for “blackmail, slander and unfair competition.” These cases are currently pending.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9766825437545776}",neutral,0.9766825437545776,0

Loro Piana Brothers Become Billionaires Selling Cashmere to LVMH - The Business of Fashion,"Wed, 10 Jul 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzb2ZmYXNoaW9uLmNvbS9uZXdzL25ld3MtYW5hbHlzaXMvbG9yby1waWFuYS1icm90aGVycy1iZWNvbWUtYmlsbGlvbmFpcmVzLXNlbGxpbmctY2FzaG1lcmUtdG8tbHZtaC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"CORONA, Italy — Sergio and Pier Luigi Loro Piana, the brothers who head Italian cashmere clothier Loro Piana SpA, have emerged as billionaires after agreeing to sell 80 percent of the family-owned company to LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SA.

LVMH’s 2 billion euro ($2.57 billion) purchase is subject to approval by competition authorities, the Paris-based company said yesterday in a statement. The deal gives Quarona, Italy- based Loro Piana an enterprise value of 2.7 billion euros. Enterprise value is defined as market capitalization plus cash minus debt. The Loro Piana brothers will retain 20 percent of the business, LVMH said.

“LVMH has proved that it respects and nurtures family businesses and is most likely to respect the values and traditions of our maison,” the brothers said in the statement.

Each brother has a net worth of at least $1 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, based on their respective 10 percent stakes in Loro Piana and after-tax proceeds from the sale.

A spokeswoman for Loro Piana confirmed the company was entirely family-owned before the LVMH purchase, and declined to comment on individual holdings. Each of the brothers owned 38 percent of the company, according to a 2007 article published in Milan newspaper Corriere della Serra. The balance was held by their sister, Lucia, and mother, Ellen Nathan.

Orbis, a database of company information published by Bureau van Dijk, showed Pier Luigi, Sergio and Lucia, as shareholders.

Fine Fabrics

The Loro Piana family has been trading wool and fabrics since the early 1800s, according to the company’s website. The current company was founded in 1924 by Pietro Loro Piana in Italy’s Piedmont region. Pietro’s nephew Franco -- Pier Luigi and Sergio’s father -- began exporting fine fabrics to international markets in the 1940s. Pier Luigi, 61, and Sergio, 65, took over in the 1970s, and developed the brand and expanded into luxury retail.

The brothers alternate the roles of president and vice president at Loro Piana, and will continue to run the company, said LVMH.

The company is the biggest western producer of cashmere and the largest single purchaser of the extra-fine merino wools in Australia and New Zealand, according to LVMH. In 1994, Loro Piana was awarded the exclusive rights to reintroduce vicuna fiber, made from the silky wool of an animal found only in the Andes.

Loro Piana, which sells deerskin jackets for $5,680 and cashmere sweaters for $1,594, is expected to have revenues of 700 million euros this year from 631 million euros in 2012, according to LVMH.

The brothers join another Italian knitwear billionaire, Brunello Cucinelli, founder of Solomeo-based Brunello Cucinelli SpA, whose shares have jumped almost 80 percent in the past year on demand for its luxurious garments, such as cashmere cardigans and $4,530 suede jackets.

LVMH Bets Big On Chinese Beauty Brand's Global Ambition - Jing Daily,"Wed, 17 Jul 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vamluZ2RhaWx5LmNvbS9wb3N0cy9sdm1oLWJldHMtYmlnLW9uLWNoaW5lc2UtYmVhdXR5LWJyYW5kcy1nbG9iYWwtYW1iaXRpb27SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"An ad for Chinese beauty brand Marubi.

After nearly three years of negotiations, LVMH-backed private equity fund L Capital Asia recently held a press conference at the Shanghai World Financial Center to announce its plan to invest in Chinese domestic cosmetics brand Marubi, which LVMH hopes to propel into the global spotlight with a possible Dior partnership and Sephora distribution. Not only would this produce major profits for the companies involved, but it may spark both the domestic and global rise of Chinese beauty brands as major competitors to U.S. and European market leaders.

According to the deal, the Singapore-based fund will officially become Marubi's second largest owner. The fund will initiate strategic cooperation with Marubi in product development, design, advertising, public relations, marketing, retail management, team building, global marketing, and M&A. Although the stake and the amount of the investment have not been disclosed, many industry insiders have speculated that the fund will hold 49 percent equity share of the cosmetics brand, with an investment of $100 million.

“L Capital Asia has been fully aware of Marubi's high-end positioning and steady growth, and we are very optimistic about the brand's development and growth in the near future,” said Ravi Thakran, managing partner of L Capita Asia and LVMH’s Southeast Asia and Middle East Group President. Sun Huaiqing, CEO of Marubi, said at the press conference, “We are very confident of Marubi's future, and our dream is to make it become a competitive world-class brand.” Sun also pointed out that the agreement will become an important milestone for Marubi's internationalization.

The ceremony announcing LVMH-backed L Capital Asia's investment in Marubi.

This dream may very likely become reality with Marubi's possible upcoming partnership with Dior and future place on the shelves of global beauty retail giant Sephora. According to the Chinese online financial news portal Yicai , Marubi will soon organize a tour for its marketing and R&D executives to visit French luxury house Dior, and the brand's new product designs will possibly be taken over by Dior's designers. In terms of sales channels, L Capital Asia will bring in Southeast Asian agents to market Marubi globally. According to Sun, Marubi's eye care product line has a good chance to enter the current mid-range sales channel vacancy of LVHM-owned Sephora, as there is no brand of its kind there already. The company seeks the acquisition of a leading cosmetic brand in Europe to make up its top-end vacancy in its brand portfolio, said Sun. Marubi's eye care line currently accounts for 30 percent of the brand's total sales, so being stocked at Sephora could spell out major profits for the brand.

According to the Chinese media, the fund conducted a fair amount of research of China's cosmetic sector before finally targeting Marubi. A Guangdong-based biotechnology company, Marubi's sales in 2012 reached 3 billion yuan (around $489 million). The company last year invested 100 million yuan in Guangzhou's Zhujiang New Town, aiming to build a new industrial park for developing technologies. As Thakran told the Chinese newspaper Moneyweek , the reasons for choosing Marubi over other Chinese cosmetics brands such as Jahwa included the company's high product quality, solid brand equity, and strong management team. The deal was brokered by HSBC executives, who introduced the two sides.

As the latest private equity fund sponsored by the LVMH Group, L Capital Asia recently raised $1 billion for its fifth fund , its second dedicated to investments in the Asia-Pacific region. The fund specializes in consumer product brands, lifestyle retail, lifestyle food and beverages, beauty and wellness, boutique hospitality, and media and entertainment. Since its inception three years ago, the fund had already forged a strategic investment partnership with four companies in Hong Kong and mainland China, including Emperor Watch & Jewellery, Ming Fung Jewellery, Jorya, and Ochirly.

In a recent Wall Street Journal interview , Thakran said the company will aim to spend between 45 percent to 60 percent of the new fund in China. He pointed out,

“Chinese entrepreneurs know their market and consumer better than anyone but they lack the knowledge of how to build brands. To them, our involvement resonates well as the capital injection is secondary while our ability to value-add is primary. We have the knowledge of how to improve products, design, merchandising, packaging, logistics, supply chain and, more crucially, the intangible piece of branding through marketing, advertising, customer-relationship management and public relations. They have a basic idea, and often have a local celebrity ambassador, but they realize our execution and finesse can make a significant difference. I believe the day Chinese entrepreneurs understand the complete brand-building process, they’ll be world conquerors.”

The Chinese cosmetics sector has been growing at a fast pace in recent years, but the market is currently dominated by foreign brands, such as L’Oreal and Estée Lauder. According to data compiled by the Hong Kong Trade Development Council (HKTDC) , more than 4,000 enterprises in China are qualified to produce cosmetics, but domestic players only accounted for less than 20 percent of the market. Though a number of domestic cosmetics brands have started to quickly catch up with their international counterparts, either by revamping products or by rebranding, they still tend to target the mass domestic market more than the high-end. They typically have not even mentioned the global market, making LVMH's international aims with Marubi particularly significant.

These Chinese cosmetics brands have been seen as a big investment opportunity for global luxury giants like LVMH, who are eager to gain access to the Chinese mass market. Meanwhile, Chinese cosmetics brands have also caught the eye of China's first lady Peng Liyuan, who has given them a chance to revive themselves . During her foreign tour with President Xi Jinping to three African countries in March, Peng presented an assortment of products from the previously out-of-fashion beauty brand Pehchaolin as diplomatic gifts to African leaders' wives.

Thanks to both “The Peng Effect” and the endorsement of foreign luxury brands, the sales figures and influence of well-known Chinese cosmetics brands are likely to receive a boost both domestically and globally in the near future, and Marubi may only be the first of many Chinese cosmetics brands to grace Sephora's shelves.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.999573290348053}",neutral,0.999573290348053,0

France's richest man, Bernard Arnault, has appointed his eldest daughter in a prominent role within his company LVMH Moët Hennessy - Louis Vuitton, leading to speculation that he could be preparing to hand over his £70bn empire to her.

Delphine Arnauilt, 38, formerly deputy managing director of Christian Dior - one of the 60-plus brands within LVMH, the world's leading luxury products group - has left Dior and is now executive vice-president of Louis Vuitton. It is considered one of LVMH's most high-powered positions.

The mother-of-one will be one of the highest-ranking woman within the €70bn Paris-based empire. Currently, the only woman who sits on the board of 15 below her father is Chantal Gaemperle, head of human resources.

Delphine will move jobs in September, and Michael Burke, chairman and chief executive officer at Louis Vuitton, said in a statement that her experience and knowledge of the luxury market are 'key assets to contribute to the successful development of Louis Vuitton'.



Vuitton accounted for about half of LVMH's 5.9 billion euros (£5 billion) in earnings before interest and taxes in 2012.

Already one of the world's richest women thanks to the work she has done for her father's company, Delphine's net worth stood at a reported €2.8 billion ($3.9 billion) in 2012.

A highly-respected, serious, and extremely hard-working businesswoman, Delphine has degrees from graduated from EDHEC Business School in Lille and the London School of Economics, where she was head of student organisations.

She was credited with keeping Dior's head above water when the brand's creativ John Galliano had his infamous anti-Semitic outburst in Paris in 2011, and then with encouraging Raf Simons into the role.



Arnault married Alessandro Vallarino Gancia, 37, heir to Gancia, an Italian dynasty of wines, in 2005. Her wedding was the event of the year for the French elite, and her wedding dress was designed by George Galliano. The couple divorced in 2010.

Delphine, a very private person who dislikes media intrusion, gave birth to her first child in August 2012.

Masters of Modern Luxury: Bernard Arnault - Robb Report,"Mon, 01 Jul 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vcm9iYnJlcG9ydC5jb20vc3R5bGUvZmFzaGlvbi9tYXN0ZXJzLW1vZGVybi1sdXh1cnktYmVybmFyZC1hcm5hdWx0LTIzMzYzNy_SAVZodHRwczovL3JvYmJyZXBvcnQuY29tL3N0eWxlL2Zhc2hpb24vbWFzdGVycy1tb2Rlcm4tbHV4dXJ5LWJlcm5hcmQtYXJuYXVsdC0yMzM2MzcvYW1wLw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"As this issue of Robb Report went to press, LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton—the luxury behemoth that owns such brands as Bulgari, Thomas Pink, and Dom Pérignon—was preparing to host Les Journées Particulières in June. During the two-day affair, which was last held in 2011, LVMH would open the doors to more than 40 of its facilities throughout Europe and invite the public to visit the jewelers, watchmakers, cobblers, tailors, cellar masters, and other artisans behind its roughly 60 brands.

The purpose of the Journées Particulières, according to the company, is to offer a glimpse of the “savoir faire” that goes into an LVMH product. The program demonstrates the emphasis that LVMH and its chairman and CEO, Bernard Arnault, place on craft as a distinguishing feature of a pair of Berluti shoes, a Louis Vuitton trunk, a Zenith timepiece, and other luxury goods.

Arnault, whose estimated personal fortune of $29 billion is the largest in France and among the largest in the world, was born in the northern town of Roubaix in 1949. He earned a degree in engineering before joining his family’s construction business, which he converted into a real estate development firm. In 1984 Arnault acquired the then-troubled textile firm Boussac, which owned Christian Dior and the Le Bon Marché department store. Five years later he gained a controlling interest in LVMH, which had formed in 1987 when the fashion house Louis Vuitton merged with the Champagne and spirits company Moët Hennessy. Since becoming the chairman and CEO of LVMH in 1989, Arnault has added such brands as Givenchy, Donna Karan, Fendi, Guerlain, and Bulgari to the fold. Two of his five children are now involved in the business. His son Antoine is a director at LVMH and the chief executive officer of Berluti, and his daughter Delphine is the deputy managing director of Christian Dior.

Arnault’s constant—and usually successful—quest to transform dusty jewels into valuable businesses has taken him to the top of the luxury-goods world. Now, an LVMH acquisition—or even the rumor of one—becomes major news. To rejuvenate brands, Arnault cleans up the distribution and infuses the company with fresh talent at the management level. This formula worked well with Dior. Arnault first installed Gianfranco Ferré at the creative helm. Then in 1996 he selected John Galliano, who catapulted the brand into the fashion stratosphere. Arnault’s 1997 hire of Marc Jacobs as the creative director of Louis Vuitton resulted in similar magic and helped reestablish the brand as the preeminent leather-goods house. More recently, LVMH turned its focus on Céline, tapping the designer Phoebe Philo, who turned the storied but staid French label into a red-hot commodity with its booming handbag business.

WATCH

Arnault also has considerable influence in the art world. Next year, LVMH will open the $143 million, Frank Gehry–designed Louis Vuitton Foundation for Creation art museum in Paris’s Bois de Boulogne.

Not all of the news from Arnault’s sphere of power has been positive, however. A recent investment in Hermès triggered a vitriolic backlash from the Hermès heirs, who plan to put up a fight to keep the firm in family hands.

Still, Arnault remains on course, looking to purchase brands with great potential for growth. “What is essential is the long-term position of the group and its brands,” he told shareholders at a meeting in April. “What I am interested in and what is of interest to the managers that are here is how the Dior brand, the Bulgari, the Louis Vuitton brand will look in 15 years’ time, and not so much what they will look like in six months’ time.

“These companies are for the most part companies that were founded by families,” he added. “These companies must preserve the same essence and the same mind-set, and that’s one of the key success drivers.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999978542327881}",neutral,0.9999978542327881,0
LVMH sales growth accelerates as luxury-goods makers rebound | Mint - Mint,"Fri, 26 Jul 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxpdmVtaW50LmNvbS9Db21wYW5pZXMvUFRHSk40bXlTOVJJVXg5UmQxOW0yTC9MVk1ILXNhbGVzLWdyb3d0aC1hY2NlbGVyYXRlcy1hcy1sdXh1cnlnb29kcy1tYWtlcnMtcmVib3VuZC5odG1s0gGEAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxpdmVtaW50LmNvbS9Db21wYW5pZXMvUFRHSk40bXlTOVJJVXg5UmQxOW0yTC9MVk1ILXNhbGVzLWdyb3d0aC1hY2NlbGVyYXRlcy1hcy1sdXh1cnlnb29kcy1tYWtlcnMtcmVib3VuZC5odG1sP2ZhY2V0PWFtcA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Paris: LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SA , the world’s largest luxury-goods maker, and Gucci owner Kering SA reported accelerating sales growth as the industry rebounded from a weak start to the year.

LVMH, the owner of Louis Vuitton and Christian Dior, said second-quarter organic revenue advanced 9%, more than the first-quarter’s 7% gain. Luxury sales at Kering rose 9.4% on a comparable basis, exceeding the previous quarter’s 6.4% increase, the Paris-based company said on Thursday.

The stronger sales performances provided some relief for luxury investors after a stuttering start to the year at both companies. First-quarter revenue growth at Gucci and LVMH’s fashion and leather-goods unit was the weakest in more than three years, hurt partly by weaker Chinese consumption. Both companies expressed confidence in the second-half outlook.

“I expect trading updates to continue to improve in the second half"" as the basis of comparison gets easier and confidence among rich Chinese consumers strengthens, Luca Solca, an analyst at Exane BNP Paribas, said by e-mail.

LVMH rose as much as 5.7% in Paris trading, the steepest intraday gain since 10 January 2012, and was up 4.5% at €136.30 as of 11:40 am. Kering climbed 4.2% to €178.10.

Loro Piana

LVMH, which this month agreed to pay €2 billion ($2.7 billion) for 80% of Italian clothier Loro Piana SpA, said first-half sales at its fashion and leather-goods unit rose 5%, excluding acquisitions, disposals and currency shifts. That was an improvement on the first-quarter’s 3% growth.

Second-quarter sales at Kering, formerly known as PPR, were driven by Bottega Veneta. The brand had growth of 17% on a comparable basis, about double the pace of the previous three months. That topped Gucci’s 4.1% advance, which was little changed from the first-quarter’s 4% increase and below the 4.9% median estimate of 16 analysts.

Gucci’s growth was “a touch below expectations,"" while the company’s other luxury brands exceeded estimates, Solca said. Their performance is “yet another reminder of the smaller brands’ importance to the big picture,"" said Eva Quiroga, an analyst at UBS AG, in a note to clients.

Hermes International SCA, in which LVMH has a stake, this month reported a 16% increase in quarterly revenue, excluding currency swings, as sales of its Kelly handbags and other goods surged in Asia and the Americas.

Sporting Goods

First-half profit at Kering beat estimates as the luxury unit’s growth compensated for lower sales at Puma SE, the sporting-goods company in which it owns a majority stake.

So-called recurring operating income advanced 2.3% to €843 million in the six months ended 30 June, the company said. Analysts predicted €824 million, the median of 16 estimates surveyed by Bloomberg.

“Trends recorded in the first six months of 2013 should continue in the second half,"" Kering said in the statement. “In this context, the group maintains its goal of improving its operating and financial performances in the full year.""

LVMH’s first-half profit from recurring operations climbed 2% to €2.71 billion, the Paris-based company said on Thursday. Analysts predicted €2.76 billion, according to the average estimate compiled by Bloomberg.

First-half sales advanced 5.6% to €13.7 billion, or 8% excluding currency shifts and acquisitions.

“It is with confidence that we approach the second half of the year,"" chairman and chief executive officer Bernard Arnault said in the statement.

Increased investment in smaller brands is helping support growth at LVMH’s fashion and leather-goods unit, said Solca. The “EBIT impact shows this transition is neither immediate nor painless, though, as LVMH scrambles to support growth."" Bloomberg

Luxury: Object of desire - Financial Times,"Mon, 08 Jul 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZ0LmNvbS9jb250ZW50L2JjMjc1Y2VhLWU3YWUtMTFlMi05YWFkLTAwMTQ0ZmVhYmRjMNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Print this page

Bernard Arnault, the billionaire head of French luxury goods group LVMH , once dismissed a question about a rival group, saying: “As far as competitors, there are two I admire: Chanel and Hermès .”

That was soon after Mr Arnault’s tenacious “handbag war” for control of Gucci, the Italian leather goods maker, ended in rare defeat at the hands of arch-rival François Pinault’s PPR group (now known as Kering ) more than a decade ago.

Now Mr Arnault is involved in a second handbag war – this time for Hermès – regarded as the crème de la crème of luxury goods companies for the quality and craftsmanship of its bags and silk scarves and ties.

The hand-stitched leather gloves have come off in a hostile duel between the 176-year old Hermès and 26-year old LVMH, involving not only one of the world’s richest, most controversial and private men but also the biggest shake-up in a decade in France’s luxury goods industry – the world’s largest.

The story began one Saturday morning in October 2010 when Patrick Thomas, Hermès chief executive, was riding his bike in the Auvergne countryside. His mobile phone rang. It was Mr Arnault, telling him that LVMH had acquired 17 per cent of Hermès in a “friendly” stock market operation. The news stupefied its controlling family, which holds 72 per cent.

The Hermès family called LVMH’s audacious swoop on almost two-thirds of its free float through the stealthy use of derivatives an “attack”. They also regarded it as an unacceptable way of doing business.

Mr Arnault has been no stranger to controversy over the three decades in which he has shaken up French business practice and forged a $29bn fortune, the second-largest in the country and 10th-biggest in the world.

But last week France’s stock market regulator slapped an €8m fine on LVMH for the “seriousness of the successive breaches of public disclosure requirements, which consisted in concealing each stage of LVMH’s stakebuilding in Hermès”. It lambasted LVMH’s “circumvention of the rules intended to ensure transparency”.

The decision was an important victory for Hermès from a regulator hitherto mocked in the French business community as “weak with the strong and strong with the weak”.

LVMH will appeal, arguing that it has not had a fair hearing and that the decision is “flawed”.

For the 64-year-old Mr Arnault, a tall, aloof and taciturn man with sharp blue eyes, last week’s legal ruling was just a minor setback to his ambitions. As Pierre Godé, Mr Arnault’s right-hand man, says, LVMH will wait “a century, maybe two” for Hermès.

There is no doubt that it has been a great investment: LVMH is sitting on paper profits of €2bn from its canny bet during the 2008 market meltdown. Next, Mr Arnault sees synergies through co-operation.

Then there is Mr Arnault’s magpie attraction to glister. “He cannot see a beautiful brand without wanting it,” says a person who knows both sides and did not wish to be named. “Like Casanova, he must possess them all – it’s a compulsion with him.”

The real reason for our objection to LVMH is cultural. We are not luxury. We are high-quality, based on exceptional artisanal work

Mr Arnault’s business nest is stuffed with treasure – more than 60 brands – including Christian Dior, Louis Vuitton, Céline, Loewe, Givenchy and Berluti in fashion and leather goods; Guerlain perfumes; Bulgari and Chaumet in jewellery, while in spirits and champagne LVMH owns Dom Pérignon, Krug, Château d’Yquem, Cheval Blanc and Hennessy.

Acquiring Hermès would not only give Mr Arnault the world’s most desirable handbag manufacturer – prices start at about €4,000 – but it would also complement Louis Vuitton, where prices are similar to Gucci’s at an average of about €1,400 and where sales have slowed sharply.

From Hermès’ perspective, a takeover by LVMH would mean the slow death of the company founded by Thierry Hermès, a German-born harness-maker to European noblemen who set up shop in Paris in 1837.

The company, which still hand-stitches most of its bags, regards itself as one of the last bastions against the industry’s descent into what it calls “ masstige ” – the mass production of prestige goods.

LVMH’s brash, flashy approach to luxury is anathema to Hermès: new recruits at Louis Vuitton play a board game in which one of the questions is to name as many celebrities as possible in its advertisement campaigns.

The style of leadership is also different. At Hermès’ Paris Faubourg Saint-Honoré flagship store, the charismatic shadow of family patriarch Jean-Louis Dumas still looms large, despite his death just months before Mr Arnault made his move.

Mr Dumas combined creativity with business nous and a playful approach to luxury, characterised by his whimsical sketches and his mantra that Hermès should “grow but not get fat”. He groomed the dapper Mr Thomas, a family outsider. “The real reason for our objection to LVMH is cultural. We are not luxury. We are high-quality, based on exceptional artisanal work,” Mr Thomas says.

An anonymous modern building serves as Hermes’ headquarters. “The only influence that LVMH could have would be to jeopardise the vision that has made Hermès successful for the past six generations,” he says.

He can’t see a beautiful brand without wanting it. Like Casanova, he must possess them all – it’s a compulsion

The competitive and sometimes prickly Mr Arnault does not appreciate a brush-off that treats him like a parvenu. The rejection, those close to him say, has made him even more determined to prevent Hermès from escaping his bearhug. He has increased his stake to 22.6 per cent, despite Hermès’ request that he desist.

“It was humiliating for him to be told he is not quality,” says another person who knows both sides and does not wish to be named. “Because the one thing Bernard can’t buy is other people’s opinion.”

In wooing Hermès, Mr Arnault has praised it as a “magnificent company” for which he has “good intentions” and no plan to take control. To which Mr Thomas riposted: “If you want to seduce a beautiful woman, you don’t start by raping her from behind.”

…

Hermès is already well protected from takeover through a limited partnership structure, likened by US activist investor Guy Wyser-Pratte to a medieval castle – “all that is lacking is the moat around the headquarters with a few crocodiles”.

But Mr Arnault is adept – some would say ruthless – in using family divisions to his advantage, although the Hermès family has so far remained united.

Liberation, the leftwing French daily, called him the Machiavelli of finance because of the way he wrested control of Louis Vuitton Moët Hennessy, the handbags and spirits group, from its family shareholders in 1990.

That operation prompted Mr Dumas to put in place the société en commandite par actions structure before floating 9 per cent of the company in 1993. Hermès shares trade at multiples almost as breathtaking as the cost of its bags – the company’s stock market value is bigger than Société Générale’s, despite revenues one-eighth of those of France’s second-biggest bank.

The takeover also led to a change in France’s stock market regulations – not the first time that tougher rules have followed Mr Arnault’s manoeuvres. The regulator last year tightened the loophole on disclosure of equity swaps, which had enabled LVMH to acquire its 17 per cent Hermès stake legally, without first having to declare thresholds of 5, 10 and 15 per cent.

Although his hardball tactics and sharp nose for profit ruffle feathers in France, they would not be out of place in the US, where Mr Arnault spent a few youthful years in Florida as a property developer. An accomplished pianist and avid art collector, Mr Arnault sees himself as a visionary with a passion for creation.

“What I like is the idea of transforming creativity into profitability. It’s what I like the most,” Mr Arnault told Women’s Wear Daily.

Mr Arnault’s big idea in an industry traditionally dominated by small, often family-owned artisanal enterprises was to acquire and consolidate such businesses into an enormously successful luxury conglomerate.

LVMH’s sales of €28bn last year – eight times Hermès’ – were bigger than those of Michelin, the tyremaker, or Alstom, France’s nuclear power and transport group.

“He has a relentless passion for excellence and execution,” says Henri de Castries, a friend who heads Axa, the French insurer.

Jean-Marie Laborde, chief executive of Rémy Cointreau and former head of LVMH’s Moët & Chandon, says: “He is very decisive. If you are discussing something with him, he will discern the one important point and ask your opinion. Then he’ll say: ‘OK, go away and do it.’ That aspect of working with him was very stimulating.”

Mr Arnault’s family controls 64 per cent of the votes in LVMH for an outlay of 48 per cent of the capital. This is thanks to a multi-layered series of holding companies as elaborate as a Dior haute couture ball gown. The luxury conglomerate model has been followed by others, including Switzerland’s Richemont, owner of Cartier, and Kering, respectively the world’s second and third-largest luxury groups. Hermès is different – it has expanded essentially through its single label.

Mr Arnault’s success, wealth and litigious bent earn him respect and fear. He is received abroad like a statesman because of LVMH’s importance as an investor – it is the employer most desired by French graduates – and he has powerful friends, including Nicolas Sarkozy, France’s former president.

“What we create is emblematic. It’s linked to Versailles, to Marie Antoinette,” Mr Arnault has said. Some senior executives refer to him simply as God. He drives managers hard but pays them well.

A former employee at Louis Vuitton says: “When he arrives, the doorman warns the receptionist, who buzzes up to the secretary, who tells her boss that he is on his way. And everyone stands up when he enters the room.”

…

The big question now is whether he will get his way with Hermès. Secret talks aimed at a rapprochement broke down last summer. Hermès has since launched a legal battle in the long-shot hope of having the swaps declared invalid, forcing LVMH to sell its stake.

Antoine Arnault, Mr Arnault’s oldest son and head of Berluti, the shoe maker, has launched a public-relations campaign aimed at countering what he calls the group’s “rather cold image based on its results or stock market performance”.

What is almost certain is that the fight will continue into the next generation – the sixth at Hermès – and possibly at LVMH, too.

Axel Dumas , the 43-year-old nephew of Mr Dumas, who is set to replace Mr Thomas by the end of the year, said last month it would be “the battle of our generation”.

Mr Arnault has no plans to retire. But this may be his last big fight, given tighter regulation and a move towards international norms.

Vincent de la Vaissière, author of an annual study of French captains of industry, says Mr Arnault is one of a handful of “predators of genius” in the nation’s business world. But he adds: “The race is probably facing extinction.”

…

Two views of craftsmanship in Paris suburbs

In Hermès’ largest factory, in the seedy Paris suburb of Pantin, more than 300 artisans work in natural light around a soaring glass atrium.

The leather goods made here include the group’s famed Kelly bags – which were a favourite of Princess Grace of Monaco – and the more sporty Birkin bag, designed for Jane Birkin, the singer who met former Hermès chief executive Jean-Louis Dumas on an aeroplane and told him what she wanted in a dream bag.

The distinctive feature of Hermès’ production is that one artisan makes a single bag from start to finish, only using a machine to sew the inside pocket and zips.

The seams are sewn with a double stitch that involves using needles in both hands in a simultaneous flourishing gesture. The artisans have at least two years’ training. It takes about 18 hours to make a Kelly, which retails for more than €6,000 in a small version.

Because of the time needed to train artisans, supply lags demand and customers typically have to wait months for the bag of their choice.

Louis Vuitton’s 1859 atelier at Asnières, also in northern Paris, is where Patrick-Louis Vuitton, a fifth generation of the family of trunkmakers, supervises special orders and the making of the brand’s distinctive luggage. Most of the sewing is done by seamstresses using electric sewing machines. Some parts are hand-dyed and sewn.

Vuitton’s production is famed for its efficiency, with teams handling the assembly: one person is responsible for cutting the leather, another for the stitching, another for the fastenings.

LVMH has cranked up references to its artisans since taking its Hermès stake in 2010, inviting the public to “meet the artisans” through the launch of its journées particulières, first held in 2011, and again last month.

According to Benoît Boussemart, author of a book on French family fortunes, there is no comparison between the two when it comes to craftsmanship, citing figures showing that 43 per cent of Hermès’ workforce is employed in production activities, compared with 15 per cent at LVMH.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999645948410034}",neutral,0.9999645948410034,0
LVMH's L'Avenue Mall opens up with one of the best designed interiors in China - Luxurylaunches,"Wed, 24 Jul 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vbHV4dXJ5bGF1bmNoZXMuY29tL290aGVyX3N0dWZmL2x2bWhzLWxhdmVudWUtbWFsbC1vcGVucy11cC13aXRoLXRoZS1vbmUtb2YtdGhlLWJlc3QtZGVzaWduZWQtaW50ZXJpb3JzLWluLWNoaW5hLnBocNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"

Luxury goods conglomerate LVMH continues to spread its Parisian chic, this time by opening the grand and very upscale L’Avenue mall in West Shanghai. A joint venture between LVMH’s real estate arm L Real Estate and Hong Kong real estate developer Stanley Ho, L’Avenue houses the biggest names in the LVMH posse, such as Louis Vuitton, Dior, Fendi, Bulgari, Celine, Loewe, and Tag Heuer, among others. Luxury brands outside of the group haven’t resisted the ‘Haute charms either, and the mall expects to welcome Ermenegildo Zegna, Ferragamo, Burberry, and Prada very soon. And after announcing plans of reconquering the Chinese market, Ralph Lauren has made an eyeball-grabbing re-entry with its L’Avenue store, touted to be its best in China. No deja vu here as LVMH arch-rivals Chanel and Hermes continue to keep a safe distance.





Clearly, a mecca for designer-label loyalists, L’Avenue possesses an exterior that is an assortment of astute archways and facades, with sunlight washing over the jaw-dropping mammoth structure by day. By night, however, this interplay of nature with the man-made aesthetic is replaced with a dance of gleaming neon lights, which, going by the latest luxury trend reports, falls right in line with all things Skyscraper and Shanghai.



The L’Avenue interiors are said to be one of the best designed in China and are inarguably curiosity generating for reasons other than their extravagant plushness. The cavernous ground floor not only poses a warm welcome to guests but in a change of tack from many other luxury mall developments, the top brands, including Louis Vuitton, Zegna, and Ralph Lauren, have developed a duplex concept, consisting of ground plus basement level (instead of the more common ground plus second level multi-story stores).



It is a well-known fact that brands worldwide have experienced lower productivity on upper floors of stores due to a lesser footfall owing to distance, perhaps (or laziness even though the “elevator” concept is a better-known facet of the mall- facts). So it doesn’t come without some wonder if people (or perhaps just Chinese) are psychologically more willing to go downstairs than up, thus making these L’Avenue duplex stores more productive in their below-ground selling areas. As for the previously established plight of the upper stories, the terracing between floors in L’Avenue gives the internal facades of brands on upper floors plenty of exposure to circulating customers.



Exterior and interior marvels aside, the L’Avenue is privy to a fantastic neighbor, too, in the form of Hongqiao Park that sits directly adjacent to the mall. The park offers lively aftermath to any shopping spree, with residents transforming the park into the neighborhood disco/exercise ground with thumping Chinese techno music to end the night too.



With options galore, the L’Avenue experience seems to be nothing short of a modern-day fashion fairyland where the wealthy Chinese (and hopefully the rest of us) can go and, with a swish of our credit cards, watch the fairy tale come alive.

LVMH fined 8 mn euros over Hermes stake - SKNVibes.com,"Mon, 01 Jul 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiMWh0dHBzOi8vbS5za252aWJlcy5jb20vbmV3cy9uZXdzZGV0YWlscy5jZm0vNzU2ODfSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"(Paris, FRA) - France's financial market regulator said Monday it had fined luxury conglomerate LVMH a record 8 million euros ($10.4 million) for failing to inform markets it was raising its stake in elite handbag and scarf maker Hermes.

""Taking into consideration the 'seriousness of the successive breaches of public disclosure requirements, which consisted in concealing each stage of LVMH's stakebuilding in Hermes', the Committee imposed an 8-million euro fine on LVMH,"" said a statement from the AMF regulator citing the decision.

LVMH immediately said it planned to appeal, calling the decision and size of the fine levied ""totally unjustified"".

The two companies have been locked in a bitter feud ever since LVMH, which owns Louis Vuitton and dozens of other luxury brands, revealed in late 2010 that it had secretly built up a 17-percent stake in the family-dominated Hermes.

LVMH, led by tycoon Bernard Arnault, later built this holding up to 22.6 percent prompting Hermes to cry foul and accuse Arnault of surreptitiously trying to add Hermes to his large stable of brands.

The AMF took issue with the way LVMH used swap agreements with three banks for amounts just below mandatory disclosure rules.

While it acknowledged that in isolation, none of the deals infringed disclosure rules, the AMF found there was no commercial justification for how they were structured and, taken together, constituted a breach.

It said LVMH should have informed markets in 2008 and 2009 about the deals in its consolidated accounts as it had a responsibility to report preparations for transactions that would have an impact on share prices.

Moreover, LVMH should have disclosed the deals when it agreed in June 2010 to settle the swaps and acquire the shares in Hermes.

The decision by the AMF's enforcement committee said the ""circumvention of the rules intended to ensure transparency, which is so vital to orderly markets, must be punished to the same extent as the disruption it causes.""

The fine is a record for AMF, but less than the 10 million euros sought by its investigators.

""This decision is in line with Hermes' position,"" said a member of the Hermes entourage.

Last month, Hermes began a legal battle to get the swap deals reversed, accusing LVMH and the three banks -- Societe Generale, Natixis and Credit Agricole -- saying the transactions amounted to fraud.

If the fine is upheld it will have little impact on LVMH's finances, as the company posted a net profit of 3.4 billion euros last year on sales of 28.1 billion.

""Nevertheless it will stain the group's image a little bit,"" said Serge Carreira, a luxury sector specialist at Sciences Po university in Paris, although it is primarily a French story and not an ""international event"".","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9928053021430969}",neutral,0.9928053021430969,0
