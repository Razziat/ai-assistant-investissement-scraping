Kering versus LVMH: It bags and influencers VS heritage and size - MDS,"Thu, 13 Feb 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZW1kcy5jb20vY29tcGFuaWVzL2tlcmluZy12ZXJzdXMtbHZtaC1pdC1iYWdzLWFuZC1pbmZsdWVuY2Vycy12cy1oZXJpdGFnZS1hbmQtc2l6ZS5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"In one corner of the arena, is an increasingly large titan with an insatiable appetite. On the other side, the eternal number two who has bet the least but desires to continue in the game. LVMH and Kering are now almost 40 billion euros away (43.7 billion dollars), more than double from ten years ago. In addition, their strategies could not be further apart.

The two French groups were pioneers in the introduction of capital in the luxury sector and, since its inception, they opted for diversified conglomerates: Kering with distribution (Printemps) and sport (Puma), and LVMH with drinks (Moët & Chandon, Hennessy) and distribution specialized (Sephora, DFS). Each one also has a crown jewel: Louis Vuitton for LVMH and Gucci for Kering.

But since those conforming beginnings in diverse viewpoints, each group has taken its own path. LVMH has pressed on the accelerator with a blow of purchases until strengthening itself as the largest luxury group and one of the largest in fashion in the world, a position that it shares with only a handful of companies such as Nike, L'Oréal or Inditex.

LVMH ended 2018 with a revenue of 53.7 million euros (43.7 billion dollars), 14.6% more than the previous year, and increased its profit by 12.9%, up to 7.2 million euros 7.2 (billion dollars). The company has opted, with few exceptions, for brands with a solid history that today are large ships sailing at cruising speed, such as Dior or Louis Vuitton, which continue to cover the bulk of their revenue.

The latest card played by LVMH was with another company in the image and likeness of its crown jewels. At the end of last year, the French holding announced that it had reached an agreement to buy Tiffany for 16.2 billion dollars.

Additionally, the group invested in Stella McCartney, who until 2018 held a 50 joint venture with rival Kering. It also launched Fenty, the first brand that has been created from scratch for the first time since 1987.

LVMH is almost 40 billion euros (43.6 billion dollars) away from Kering

While LVMH buys, Kering sells. First, the group broke away from the businesses that gave it its name (Printemps and La Redoute) and changed its name from PPR to Kering. In recent decades, the company has gone a step further, leaving behind its entire sports fashion division.

The company broke free from Puma in 2018, from which it had been disinvesting for several years, and last year it sold Volcom to Authentic Brands Group. In addition, the company also got rid of its participation in Stella McCartney last year.

In parallel, the group has resorted to influencers, It bags, and star designers to revitalize its main brands, which has also made them more volatile than those of LVMH. The process began with Gucci, who after years of the doldrums managed to return to the path of growth after the signing in 2015 of Alessandro Michele as its new creative director and Marco Bizzarri as CEO.

LVMH has continued acquiring while Kering disinvested

The brand covers 62% of the group’s sales, with a revenue of 9.6 billion euros (10.5 billion dollars), and represents 40% of its operating result. Yves Saint Laurent also went through the same process, with the signings of Hedi Slimane first and Anthony Vacarello later.

With Slimane at the helm, the company tripled its sales and became the fastest growing group. Today it continues to keep up: in 2019, Yves Saint Laurent had a revenue of 2 billion euros (2.23 billion dollars), up 16.2%.

Now, Bottega Veneta has begun to follow the same path. The company signed Daniel Lee in 2018 as the new creative director, who reinterpreted the brand’s DNA in current code and has made the brand one of the influencers’ favorites. In just one year, Bottega Veneta has returned to the path of growth, with an increase of 5.3% in 2019, although it was based on its profitability, which fell by 14.3%.

After years of sales, Kering could now be returning to a buying position. At the end of last year, the company began negotiating the purchase of Moncler, one of the fastest growing luxury firms in recent years, although nothing has been finalized so far.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999639987945557}",neutral,0.9999639987945557,0
What's next for LVMH's 24S? - Glossy,"Fri, 28 Feb 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiN2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmdsb3NzeS5jby9mYXNoaW9uL3doYXRzLW5leHQtZm9yLWx2bWhzLTI0cy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"In LVMH’s most recent earnings call, CEO Bernard Arnault said that e-commerce site 24S, which was used to compete with platforms like Farfetch and Net-a-Porter, has been losing money since its inception in June 2017.

“A lot of online sites are losing money. We created a relatively small site called 24S, which unfortunately is no exception to the rule. Because it’s small it doesn’t lose that much money, but hopefully we can figure out a way to make it profitable at some point,” Arnault said.

After two-and-a-half years of 24S treading water, it’s unclear what LVMH’s long-term plan is for the site or if it’s time to cut the cord.

Online sales have never been a huge part of LVMH’s business, only making up about 5% of revenue in 2017, though Arnault said online sales have increased by 30% since then. Though 24S’s losses are not detrimental yet based on Arnault’s comments, should they be?

LVMH’s competitors Richemont and Kering have made significant strides in their digital strategies. Richemont’s Net-a-Porter, while a drain on the company’s profitability when it was first acquired, brought in more than $2 billion in 2017. Kering, meanwhile, is winding down its partnership with Net-a-Porter to spur more online sales in-house. And non-brand-affiliated platforms like Farfetch and Matchesfashion have been doing exceptionally well, with the former seeing a 90% increase in revenue in the third quarter of last year. LVMH doesn’t disclose 24S’s revenue explicitly, but it’s clear the company has a ways to go to catch up with competitors.

24S was launched as 24 Sèvres (named for the address of Le Bon Marché, the Parisian LVMH-owned department store) and was meant to serve as the online equivalent of that location. It originally focused on a French customer, but two years in LVMH renamed it and said it would center on an international shopper. At the time, LVMH chief digital officer Ian Rogers said it was because they had seen much more interest in 24S from international shoppers.

“Net-a-Porter and Farfetch have existed for 20 and 13 years, respectively. Both platforms were around to capitalize on the online shopping boom and hold strong brand recognition among luxury consumers,” said Edited retail analyst Krista Corrigan of 24S’s competitive set.

Still, LVMH CFO Jean-Jacques Guiony said selling the company’s products through existing e-commerce platforms like Farfetch or Matches Fashion is out of the question in their current iterations.

“There’s no such thing as a platform today that would suit our needs. Most platforms don’t provide access to the various data regarding the clients that we would like,” he said during an earnings call in 2018.

But LVMH has not invested in keeping 24S on the same technological level as some of its competitors. While virtually all luxury e-commerce platforms like Net-a-Porter and Farfetch have embraced mobile, 24S hasn’t — a critical oversight said Brian Long, CEO of mobile messaging company Attentive.

“Luxury brands have not been as quick to embrace mobile shopping like other retailers have,” Long said. “Their shopper is browsing and buying on mobile. They thought their customer was older and wouldn’t do it, but there’s a lot of luxury companies [like SSENSE and Browns] moving on mobile because it’s where all demographics, including the next generation of shoppers, are.”

Arnault has said he is skeptical of e-commerce due to the potential of brand dilution, even the desirable brands within LVMH’s portfolio may not be sufficient.

“Though 24S has the exclusive distribution of Dior and Celine, it may not be enough to drive significant growth for the platform,” Corrigan said.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9703845977783203}",neutral,0.9703845977783203,0
Next LVMH Prize Winner Is Probably Famous Already on Instagram - WWD,"Fri, 14 Feb 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3dkLmNvbS9mZWF0dXJlL25leHQtbHZtaC1wcml6ZS13aW5uZXItcHJvYmFibHktZmFtb3VzLW9uLWluc3RhZ3JhbS0xMjAzNDg1NTczL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS — When the semifinalists for the LVMH Prize for Young Designers gather at the luxury conglomerate’s headquarters later this month to show their collections to a panel of industry experts, many of them will have Instagram to thank for the career-making opportunity.

The list of 20 semifinalists unveiled today includes many brands that owe their burgeoning notoriety to social media and influencers, always on the search for hot new labels. Among them, Tomo Koizumi, Rave Review, Helmstedt, Chopova Lowena and Peter Do have all leveraged the Internet in different ways.

Koizumi is perhaps the most famous example: after Vogue talent scout Sara Maino posted one of his colorful, oversize ruffled designs on Instagram in October 2018, things quickly snowballed. Giles Deacon and Gwendoline Christie flagged it to stylist Katie Grand, who brought him to New York to make his debut.

“She DMed me less than a month before my first show,” Koizumi said of the display, held at the Marc Jacobs store on Madison Avenue last February with models including Karen Elson, Bella Hadid, Emily Ratajkowski, Rowan Blanchard and Christie. The images promptly went viral.

Koizumi, who makes only custom dresses, has since seen his designs worn by the likes of Miley Cyrus and Sophie Turner, and two outfits featured in the “Camp: Notes on Fashion” exhibition at The Metropolitan Museum of Art’s Costume Institute. If he takes home the LVMH Prize, he plans to launch a commercial collection.

“It’s my most dreamed prize in my career. If I won the prize, I can prove that strong and unique creativity is the best key to success without any big background. And that will encourage young designers and fashion students to be unique and different,” he said in an e-mail exchange.

Among those competing for a grand prize of 300,000 euros, plus a year of coaching from experts at LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, the parent of brands including Louis Vuitton, Dior and Fendi, are 14 women’s wear designers, four men’s wear designers and two unisex labels — a reversal from recent years, when genderless fashion ruled.

Many of them will already be familiar to influencers like Susie Lau, one of the panel of 68 experts charged with selecting the eight brands that will go through to the final of the LVMH Prize on June 5.

Lau is a fan of Chopova Lowena’s signature kilts, made from recycled folkloric fabrics from Bulgaria including vintage aprons, pillowcases, wall hangings and tablecloths. Now in its third season, the brand is carried in 30 points of sale including Matchesfashion.com, Dover Street Market and Browns.

Emma Chopova and Laura Lowena, who graduated from Central Saint Martins as a duo, have eschewed fashion shows in favor of books made with photographer Charlotte Wales. “We want to do something different. We’re interested in a new approach rather than the old boring method of doing things,” said Chopova.

The brand’s relationship with influencers grew organically out of that. “It was way less of a social media thing than just kind of a natural growth, meeting people and giving them stuff. It was important to like people and connect with them, and then to want them to have something,” she said.

Josephine Bergqvist and Livia Schück, the designers behind the Swedish label Rave Review, popped up on the radar of influencers like Janka Polliani, Elsa Hosk and Veronika Heilbrunner with their sophomore collection for fall 2018, featuring their signature blanket coat spliced together from vintage wool plaids.

“That was actually the starting point for us, where we started to reach internationally,” said Schück. “Social media, and especially Instagram, has played a huge part in our growth and I think it’s been in a very organic way.”

She noted that most buyers approach the brand, which showed at Copenhagen Fashion Week for the first time this season, through the social media platform. Rave Review is stocked at Matchesfashion.com, Browns, LN-CC, Totokaelo and Opening Ceremony.

Do, who won a graduate award at the inaugural LVMH Prize in 2014, doesn’t work with influencers, but said the Internet has been crucial to building his U.S.-based label. “We are a Millennial brand. I met all of my members through Tumblr, Facebook, Instagram,” he said of his staff of 12. “The brand feels like it was built on the Internet.”

Having worked at Celine under Phoebe Philo, he wants to “bring back craft and garment making” to New York City with his tailoring-based collection, available in 40 points of sale next fall, including Net-a-porter, Bergdorf Goodman and Joyce. Do uses his Instagram account, which has 185,000 followers, to document the process.

“Instagram is obviously something that all of us really enjoy, so when we started the brand, we really wanted to pull back the curtain and show everybody it’s not always glamorous. We go to Ikea to build furniture, we go to Costco to get lunch,” he explained.

“People really respond to that and that’s how the Instagram grew — because we were showing everyday things, we weren’t showing fancy parties or glamorous things. We’ve shown people we’re carrying fabric around, it’s a lot of heavy work. There’s a lot going on that other people don’t show,” Do added.

Emilie Helmstedt, conversely, uses the platform to spin an aesthetic universe around her whimsical designs, built on brightly colored, hand-painted prints. Her Copenhagen-based brand is carried by 20 retailers including Danish concept store Holly Golightly, Printemps, Rinascente, Moda Operandi and Browns.

“I’m 27 years old. I grew up with a computer and I got introduced to the iPhone from an early age, so it’s very natural for us to communicate on this platform and I’m very happy that I’m a brand that was established after the Internet, because I think it’s also difficult for brands started maybe 20 years ago to get to know all of this now,” she said.

“As a creative director of a brand, it’s not my passion to do Instagram, but I know that it’s something I have to be aware of,” Helmstedt said. “We spend a lot of time to try to create the DNA and the universe of the collections through this platform.”

In fact, she has a hard time imagining fashion without social media. “I really feel like the whole industry is all over Instagram. It’s a bit weird — also a bit terrifying, because what if Instagram closes? What do you do with your brand?” she mused.

Delphine Arnault, the force behind the LMVH Prize and a key talent scout at the family-controlled group, noted another byproduct of the Millennial mind-set. “This year, it is worthy of note that more and more designers are working in collectives, with six duos and one trio represented among the semifinalists,” she said.

In line with previous years, many brands have an environmentally conscious approach. “All share an innovative vision, resolutely focused on the future, in terms of their research into new materials, use of bio-textiles or recycled fibers, concern for new artisanal techniques, and desire for local, reasoned production,” Arnault noted.

“Last but not least, our selection stands out in terms of parity, with 14 women and 14 men, each illustrating in their own way the ongoing conversation between the male and female wardrobes, the breaking down of gender barriers and the emergence of a more inclusive mode of dressing,” she concluded.

Rounding out the list of semifinalists are Ahluwalia, a London-based men’s wear brand designed by Priya Ahluwalia; unisex label Alled-Martinez from Paris, by Archie M. Alled-Martinez; Area, the New York-based women’s wear label by Beckett Fogg and Piotrek Panszczyk; Casablanca, a men’s wear brand by Charaf Tajer that is about to launch women’s wear, and New York-based women’s label Commission, designed by Jin Kay, Dylan Cao and Huy Luong.

Also shortlisted are Ester Manas, a Brussels-based women’s brand by Ester Manas and Balthazar Delepierre; Kaushik Velendra and Nicholas Daley, both eponymous men’s labels from London; Argentine designer Romina Cardillo’s vegan brand Nous Etudions; women’s wear designer Piero D’Angelo, based in London, and Samuel Guì Yang, the women’s label designed by Samuel Yang and Erik Litzén.

Finishing the list are South African designer Sindiso Khumalo’s eponymous women’s brand; designer Supriya Lele’s women’s label of the same name; Vaqar, the Iranian brand designed by Shirin and Shiva Vaqar, who are back after making the shortlist in 2016, and Chinese designer Yuhan Wang, who shows her women’s ready-to-wear in London.

The semifinalists are to travel to Paris with their collections and display them at LVMH headquarters on Feb. 27 and 28 during Paris Fashion Week. Unique in its online-only application process, the LVMH Prize is open for anyone under age 40 who has produced and sold at least two women’s or men’s rtw collections.

In addition to the main award, LVMH will hand out the Karl Lagerfeld Prize, worth 150,000 euros, which comes with a one-year mentorship program provided by a dedicated LVMH team offering expertise in areas such as intellectual property, sourcing, production, distribution, image, communication and marketing.

This year’s edition of the LVMH Prize, now in its seventh year, attracted 1,700 applicants from 110 countries.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999592304229736}",neutral,0.9999592304229736,0
"Don't Sell LVMH Moët Hennessy - Louis Vuitton, Société Européenne (EPA:MC) Before You Read This - Yahoo Finance","Thu, 20 Feb 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQWh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9kb250LXNlbGwtbHZtaC1tby10LTA5NTkxNDA5MS5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Today, we'll introduce the concept of the P/E ratio for those who are learning about investing. We'll show how you can use LVMH Moët Hennessy - Louis Vuitton, Société Européenne's (EPA:MC) P/E ratio to inform your assessment of the investment opportunity. LVMH Moët Hennessy - Louis Vuitton Société Européenne has a price to earnings ratio of 29.41, based on the last twelve months. That is equivalent to an earnings yield of about 3.4%.

View our latest analysis for LVMH Moët Hennessy - Louis Vuitton Société Européenne

How Do You Calculate LVMH Moët Hennessy - Louis Vuitton Société Européenne's P/E Ratio?

The formula for price to earnings is:

Price to Earnings Ratio = Share Price ÷ Earnings per Share (EPS)

Or for LVMH Moët Hennessy - Louis Vuitton Société Européenne:

P/E of 29.41 = EUR419.05 ÷ EUR14.25 (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2019.)

Is A High Price-to-Earnings Ratio Good?

A higher P/E ratio means that investors are paying a higher price for each EUR1 of company earnings. That is not a good or a bad thing per se, but a high P/E does imply buyers are optimistic about the future.

How Does LVMH Moët Hennessy - Louis Vuitton Société Européenne's P/E Ratio Compare To Its Peers?

The P/E ratio indicates whether the market has higher or lower expectations of a company. You can see in the image below that the average P/E (28.4) for companies in the luxury industry is roughly the same as LVMH Moët Hennessy - Louis Vuitton Société Européenne's P/E.

ENXTPA:MC Price Estimation Relative to Market, February 20th 2020

LVMH Moët Hennessy - Louis Vuitton Société Européenne's P/E tells us that market participants think its prospects are roughly in line with its industry. The company could surprise by performing better than average, in the future. Further research into factors such as insider buying and selling, could help you form your own view on whether that is likely.

How Growth Rates Impact P/E Ratios

Probably the most important factor in determining what P/E a company trades on is the earnings growth. If earnings are growing quickly, then the 'E' in the equation will increase faster than it would otherwise. That means unless the share price increases, the P/E will reduce in a few years. A lower P/E should indicate the stock is cheap relative to others -- and that may attract buyers.

Story continues

Most would be impressed by LVMH Moët Hennessy - Louis Vuitton Société Européenne earnings growth of 13% in the last year. And earnings per share have improved by 4.8% annually, over the last five years. This could arguably justify a relatively high P/E ratio.

Don't Forget: The P/E Does Not Account For Debt or Bank Deposits

Don't forget that the P/E ratio considers market capitalization. That means it doesn't take debt or cash into account. Theoretically, a business can improve its earnings (and produce a lower P/E in the future) by investing in growth. That means taking on debt (or spending its cash).

Such expenditure might be good or bad, in the long term, but the point here is that the balance sheet is not reflected by this ratio.

Is Debt Impacting LVMH Moët Hennessy - Louis Vuitton Société Européenne's P/E?

LVMH Moët Hennessy - Louis Vuitton Société Européenne's net debt is 3.1% of its market cap. The market might award it a higher P/E ratio if it had net cash, but its unlikely this low level of net borrowing is having a big impact on the P/E multiple.

The Verdict On LVMH Moët Hennessy - Louis Vuitton Société Européenne's P/E Ratio

LVMH Moët Hennessy - Louis Vuitton Société Européenne's P/E is 29.4 which is above average (18.7) in its market. The company is not overly constrained by its modest debt levels, and its recent EPS growth very solid. So on this analysis it seems reasonable that its P/E ratio is above average.

Investors should be looking to buy stocks that the market is wrong about. People often underestimate remarkable growth -- so investors can make money when fast growth is not fully appreciated. So this free visualization of the analyst consensus on future earnings could help you make the right decision about whether to buy, sell, or hold.

Why LVMH Can Outlast the Coronavirus - The Motley Fool,"Fri, 21 Feb 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIwLzAyLzIxL3doeS1sdm1oLWludmVzdG9ycy1zaG91bGQtaWdub3JlLXRoZS1jb3JvbmF2aXJ1cy5hc3B40gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LVMH has seen its stock price fall due to fears over the coronavirus, but should long-term investors care?

The biggest stock market story of early 2020 is easily the coronavirus, now officially known as COVID-19, and its implications for the global economy -- particularly in China.

The market's response has been to sell down many companies with sensitivity to the Chinese economy. Luxury retailer LVMH (LVMUY -1.91%) is certainly one of them, having fallen about 9% from its recent high as of midday Thursday. However, long-term investors would be wise to use the pullback as a buying opportunity.

A big hit to a major market

It's easy to see why investors are concerned about LVMH's exposure to the coronavirus. Asia (excluding Japan) is the company's largest geographic market, and China is a major contributor.

LVMH Geographic Segment Percentage of Total Revenue Asia (ex-Japan) 30% United States 24% Europe (ex-France) 19% France 9% Japan 7% Other countries 11%

The COVID-19 has shut down large parts of China's economy. Schools and offices are closed, factories are not running at capacity, and many people are choosing to stay home rather than go out to shop or meet with friends out of an abundance of caution. To make matters worse, the pandemic has coincided with the Chinese Lunar New Year celebrations, which is a time of elevated spending on gifts -- likely hitting LVMH's Chinese sales especially hard.

When LVMH reported earnings on Jan. 28, CEO Bernard Arnault addressed the issue by noting that the COVID-19 outbreak didn't appear to be as bad as the SARS outbreak that occurred in the early 2000s, and he said he doesn't see much of a disruption occurring if the pandemic is resolved within two to three months. Interestingly, the company hinted that the Hong Kong political protests may end up having a greater impact on financial results. Hong Kong is a large market for luxury items, and LVMH saw its sales in the city drop 40% in the fourth quarter of 2019.

It's possible that Arnault underestimated the impact; more recent information shows that COVID-19 may be more contagious than SARS (albeit less deadly). Truth be told, nobody knows how long the coronavirus will be a factor and what its impact will ultimately be. But the pandemic will (hopefully) be contained at some point, and it appears unlikely to cause damage to LVMH's long-term financial health or earnings power.

High-end financial performance

Fear of a large impact from the coronavirus has overshadowed LVMH's long-term outlook for earnings growth. The best evidence of LVMH's financial strength is its 2019 financial performance, where its sales and earnings both grew 15%. This was driven by continued strength in the global luxury market.

Metrics 2018 2019 Change Revenue 46.8 billion euros 53.7 billion euros 15% Profit from recurring operations 10 billion euros 11.5 billion euros 15%

Commenting on the outlook, Arnault stated: ""So for 2020, as with previous years, the climate is buoyant. It will remain so, as I've said on several occasions today, in the coming years.""

For LVMH's earnings growth to remain intact, you simply need to believe that LVMH will maintain relevant brands -- it has many, including namesakes Louis Vuitton, Moet & Chandon, and Hennessy -- and that the global middle class will continue to grow its desire for luxury goods. These feel like pretty safe bets to make over the next 10-plus years.

Tiffany should start paying off soon

Another reason to be bullish on LVMH stock is its recently announced acquisition of Tiffany, which it's buying for $16.2 billion in an all-cash deal.

Tiffany is an iconic global brand that will fit nicely within LVMH's stable of global brands that include other jewelry and watch companies such as Hublot and Bulgari. LVMH is an excellent operator and will likely find some synergies between its existing jewelry assets. There's also an opportunity to ramp up Tiffany's global presence by opening more stores in Europe, Asia, and Latin America. These are markets that LVMH knows well, where it already has a strong retail footprint.

The deal is being financed with cheap debt and is expected to be immediately accretive to earnings when it closes this year.

Focus on the long term

At this writing, there's still a great deal of uncertainty regarding COVID-19, so patience will be required to see the ultimate length and impact of the health crisis. But unless it results in an unprecedented global slowdown in consumer spending that lasts through the spring and summer, it's unlikely to damage LVMH's financial health.

Businesses derive their value from their ability to generate future cash flows. While 2020 may disappoint prior earnings expectations as a result of the coronavirus, LVMH's long-term earnings power is unlikely to be impaired. Therefore, to the extent the COVID-19 proves to be a temporary issue, long-term investors should consider using the lower stock price as a buying opportunity.","{'label': 'Negative', 'score': 0.8897078633308411}",negative,0.8897078633308411,-1

"As Tiffany & Co. Shareholders Approve LVMH Deal, One is Suing the Co. Over ""False & Misleading"" SEC Filing - The Fashion Law","Wed, 05 Feb 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigAFodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGVmYXNoaW9ubGF3LmNvbS9hcy10aWZmYW55LWNvLXNoYXJlaG9sZGVycy1hcHByb3ZlLWx2bWgtZGVhbC1vbmUtaXMtc3VpbmctdGhlLWNvLW92ZXItZmFsc2UtbWlzbGVhZGluZy1zZWMtZmlsaW5nL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Over the weekend of October 26, 2019, rumors began to swirl with intensity that a multi-billion deal was quietly coming into fruition between LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton and Tiffany & Co. Within days, it would become clear that there was merit to the chatter, with Tiffany & Co. revealing that it had, in fact, “received an unsolicited, non-binding proposal from LVMH to acquire Tiffany for $120 per share in cash.” However, the New York-headquartered jewelry company was said to have swiftly “rebuffed” the $14.5 billion offer.

Within weeks, more of the closely-guarded story had unfolded. Despite the board for the 182-year old Tiffany & Co. reportedly rejecting LVMH’s initial offer as “too low to become the basis for negotiations,” the parties – which used codenames in connection with their behind-the-scenes dealings to prevent leaks (Tiffany used “Tea” and LVMH went by “Latte,” according to Reuters, in a nod to famed film “Breakfast at Tiffany’s”) – did not part ways. In fact, despite the pushback, LVMH “remained engaged,” Reuters reported in November, and began “considering a new offer” for Tiffany in furtherance of its quest to bolster the smallest division under its sweeping ownership umbrella: jewelry.

By late November, the two giants had sealed their deal. In a statement released on November 25, LVMH declared that it, “the world’s leading luxury group,” and Tiffany & Co., “the global luxury jeweler … have entered into a definitive agreement whereby LVMH will acquire Tiffany for $135 per share in cash, in a transaction with an equity value of approximately $16.2 billion.”

It would be the largest deal in the fashion/luxury space; topping the $13 billion bid that LVMH paid to bring the long-affiliated Christian Dior brand under its ownership umbrella in 2017.

The two luxury players had come to terms, but the deal, itself, was not quite done (and still is not). That would require the approval of Tiffany’s shareholders, for one thing, something that was accomplished by way of a “special meeting of Tiffany & Co. stockholders” on Tuesday. In a statement, LVMH asserted that the publicly-traded jewelry company’s shareholders have “voted overwhelmingly to approve the previously announced merger agreement.”

The vote in favor of the parties’ “merger agreement” (and the terms associated with it) – which Tiffany & Co. said in a release in December was “recommended to stockholders” by the jewelry stalwart’s board of directors – was “largely expected,” according to investing insight publication Motley Fool. But the seemingly smooth merger-in the-making is not without at least some pushback. Underway in the background of the nearly-culminated acquisition is a pending challenge.

According to a complaint that was rather quietly filed with a federal court in Delaware last month, Tiffany & Co. stockholder John Thompson has accused the jewelry company and its board of directors of submitting a proxy statement to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) on December 18 that is “false and misleading” as a result of its failure to include “material information with respect to the proposed transaction.”

In the lawsuit that Thompson filed on behalf of himself and other “similarly situated” individuals (i.e., the “hundreds, if not thousands” of other public holders of the outstanding 119,943,050 shares of Tiffany common stock”), he accuses Tiffany and its board members of violating sections of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, a federal law that governs the trading of securities in the U.S., by “disseminated [a] false and misleading Proxy Statement.”

“By virtue of their positions within the company, the individual defendants were aware of [the] information [required to be included in the Proxy Statement] and their duty to disclose this information,” and yet, failed to meet those requirements, Thompson argues by “omitting material information regarding [Tiffany’s] financial projections,” and “the analyses performed by the Company’s financial advisors in connection with the Proposed Transaction, Centerview Partners and Goldman Sachs,” among other things.

More than that, Thompson claims that Tiffany and its board did not set out “the circumstances under which the ‘additional discretionary fee of up to approximately $16 million’ is payable to Goldman, and whether the individual defendants intend to pay Goldman this fee.” This is crucial, he argues, as“full disclosure of investment banker compensation and all potential conflicts is required due to the central role played by investment banks in the evaluation, exploration, selection, and implementation of strategic alternatives.”

As a result of the foregoing, Thompson – who does not specify how many shares he holds in the company in his complaint – claims that he and the potential class of fellow plaintiffs “are threatened with irreparable harm” unless the court “preliminarily and permanently enjoins the defendants and all persons acting in concert with them from proceeding with, consummating, or closing” the LVMH merger. He has also asked the court to require Tiffany to “disseminate a Proxy Statement that does not contain any untrue statements of material fact and that states all material facts required in it or necessary to make the statements contained therein not misleading.”

In a release late last month, Wilmington, Delaware-based law firm Rigrodsky & Long, P.A., which is representing Thompson, stated that at the heart of the lawsuit is “an attempt to secure shareholder support for the proposed transaction,” which Tiffany allegedly facilitated by issuing “materially incomplete disclosures in its proxy statement.”

Despite the pending litigation, Motley Fool’s James Brumley states that the acquisition “is still expected to close in the middle of 2020, subject to the receipt of regulatory approvals and satisfaction or waiver of other customary closing conditions.”

A rep for Tiffany & Co. did not respond to a request for comment.

UPDATED (February 13, 2020): Counsel for Thompson filed a notice of voluntary dismissal on February 12 (potentially as a result of a settlement between the parties), and on February 13, the court formally closed the case.

LVMH to 'buy' Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II: Dior will pay 5 million a year to relieve Versace - MDS,"Tue, 18 Feb 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiggFodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGVtZHMuY29tL2JhY2stc3RhZ2UvbHZtaC10by1idXktZ2FsbGVyaWEtdml0dG9yaW8tZW1hbnVlbGUtaWktZGlvci13aWxsLXBheS01LW1pbGxpb24tYS15ZWFyLXRvLXJlbGlldmUtdmVyc2FjZS5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LVMH conquers Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II to expand Fendi and Dior bigger. The luxury group, led by the French entrepreneur Bernard Arnault, has just signed record rental transactions to get its Fendi and Dior brands in the coveted Milanese space. LVMH is already present in Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II with Louis Vuitton.

As published by the Italian press, Fendi and Dior will occupy the premises where until now the Italian firms Armani and Versace operated. Dior has reached an agreement whereby it will pay more than five million euros annually over the next eighteen years. Fendi, for its part, will disburse more than 2.4 million euros (2.8 million dollars) per year for the same period.

Dior’s entry into Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II sets a real estate record for the high price paid. The contract is the result of an auction, which was attended by six other brands: Hermès, Damiani, Max Mara, Prada, Yves Saint Laurent, and Versace. The starting price at the auction for the rental space was 950,000 euros.

The space that Dior is to occupy has been filled by Versace (whose contract expires next December) since 2013. The store has an area of ​​324 square meters and is situated in the central octagon of the gallery.

Meanwhile, Fendi will take over from Armani. The result of the latter changes equally came about during the auction process, with a starting bid of 872,000 euros. Fendi and Prada were finalists in the bid, in which companies like Bottega Veneta also participated.

Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II is one of the principal destinations for tourists in Milan. The building, built between 1865 and 1877, is formed by two perpendicular arcades covered by a glass and iron vault. The world’s leading luxury firms have a presence in space.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999985694885254}",neutral,0.9999985694885254,0

The French luxury company, which is part of the LVMH group, has made changes in its management committee in the Middle East, Marc Sjostedt, has taken over the managerial role, he succeeds Francois Ganes, who left the role in January and had priorly held the position for four years and four months.

Marc Sjostedt is no stranger to the Louis Vuitton family, the veteran has been part of the French luxury Maison for more than 15 years, however, prior to his uninterrupted 15 years with the company, he first entered the French house in 1996, as quality development manager, then proceeded to become leathergoods project Coordinator of LVMH.

Sjostedt started his unbroken 15-year-marathon with Louis Vuitton in 2005 as Shoe Industrial Director, a few years later, he packed up his belongings and headed to South America to become Louis Vuitton’s general manager in Brazil.

Marc Sjostedt has more than 15 years of experience with the Louis Vuitton company

After occupying the role for four years and seven months as the general manager of Louis Vuitton Brazil, he was promoted as the general manager of Brazil, Chile, and Uruguay in 2013, a role he occupied for a year and six months.

The current general manager of Louis Vuitton Middle East has done his fair share of travel throughout his career with the company. After devoting his time to the South American market for over seven years, Sjostedt who graduated at the Institut National Polytechnique de Toulouse in Automotive Engineering made his comeback to the European continent following his promotion as general manager of Louis Vuitton Mediterranean.

In his role as General manager of Louis Vuitton Mediterranean, he directed the Spanish, Turkish, Portuguese, Greek, Moroccan and Israeli markets, a role he occupied for almost five years before being promoted to his current role in the middle east.

LVMH Debuts Retail Training Program - WWD,"Wed, 05 Feb 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3dkLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy1uZXdzL2h1bWFuLXJlc291cmNlcy9sdm1oLXJldGFpbC10cmFpbmluZy1wcm9ncmFtLWxlLWJvbi1tYXJjaGUtMTIwMzQ2MTMyMy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS — Surrounded by high-school students, Tammy Foucan talked about his experience as a member of the sales team of Parisian department store Le Bon Marché.

“They asked me about the steps I took to get where I am and if the job required specific qualifications,” said the 20-year-old, speaking at the fifth edition of the Village IME, a vocational fair sponsored by LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton’s Institut des Métiers d’Excellence held on Feb. 4. “For this particular apprenticeship, none is actually needed.”

Foucan is a student of the Excellence Retail training program at Parisian business school CPRO Stephenson, one of the latest to join the roster of 21 schools who have partnered with the IME.

“I initially trained as a pastry chef, but have always been interested in retail because I love human contact,” said the student, whose culinary background earned him points at Le Bon Marché, where he is employed as an apprentice in the home section of the department store.

“What is great with this apprenticeship is that you spend most of your time working and actually putting in practice what you’ve learnt: The more clients I get to deal with, the more I learn about my profession.”

Founded in 2014, the IME aims to open up opportunities for kids to discover the group’s métiers across a range of domains and learn about work-study apprenticeships done in partnership with top French schools in jewelry, dressmaking, watchmaking, leather goods, client advisory, retail design, winemaking, gastronomy and beauty. They include the École de la Bijouterie-Joaillerie de Paris for jewelry, the Chambre Syndicale de la Couture Parisienne for fashion and Les Compagnons du Devoir for leather goods.

The basis of the IME is to create a bridge between the luxury business, in constant need of trained artisans, and students planning for the future. Via its partner schools, it offers training from vocational to MBA level, and is open to both students and adult learners.

Partnering with training programs that are accessible without any prior qualifications — not even the French baccalauréat is required to join the Excellence Retail program — is a way to spark the interest of younger generations.

“There is always some form of self-censorship: Most young people from the area think that luxury houses such as Louis Vuitton, Chaumet or Berluti aren’t accessible to them,” said Françoise Schoenberger, director of social development at LVMH, in reference to Clichy-sous-Bois, the Paris suburb where the fair is held.

To prove them wrong once and for all, the IME introduced a new format for the fifth edition of its fair: Visitors were able to sit down with current apprentices at eight LVMH houses — Christian Dior Couture, Berluti, Celine, Chaumet, Givenchy, Louis Vuitton, Le Bon Marché and LVMH Recherche — accompanied by human resources managers to simulate job interviews.

“Our greatest advantage is that these training courses, which were designed with the needs of the LVMH houses in mind, all lead to actual jobs,” Schoenberger continued. “Three quarters of our students find employment straight after graduating. Our role is to show them that their passion can be transformed into a course that will actually interest them, leading them to gain experience and eventually find the right job.”

Since the inception of the project, the IME has trained 800 artisans in four countries. The program has bases in France, Italy, Switzerland and now Spain, which was opened in 2019 with an Introduction to Leather Goods program initiated between Les Compagnons du Devoir and luxury brand Loewe. Also debuting at the fair was the IME’s new makeup formulation course with the Orléans IUT technical school in collaboration with LVMH Research Center and cosmetics school ISIPCA.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999969005584717}",neutral,0.9999969005584717,0

Tiffany shareholders have agreed to the acquisition of the company by French luxury giant LVMH. The acquisition is LVMH's most expensive acquisition ever, and helps the company position itself in the luxury gem industry at a time when demand is soaring.

LVMH will buy Tiffany for $16.2 billion (14.7 billion euros).

""A globally recognised symbol of love, Tiffany will be an outstanding addition to our unique portfolio of luxury brands,” said Bernard Arnault, the CEO of LVMH, in a statement about the acquisition.

The world’s top luxury company, LVMH owns brands like Louis Vuitton and Dior. Its jewellery holdings, include Bulgari, Chaumet, Tag Heuer and Hublot.

The company has been publically angling to acquire Tiffany since October 2019, with an initial offer of $120 per share. It went up to about $130 a month later, which convinced Tiffany to open its books, and LVMH then offered $135 to close the deal.

Tiffany & Co, founded in 1837, with headquarters on Fifth Avenue in New York, is one of the most famous jewellery brands in the world, with its jewellery presented in its trademark blue boxes.

But despite its fame, it has struggled to attract younger customers and has been lagging behind the competition in terms of sales. The brand is expected to benefit from LVMH's global network and promotional power.

Alexandre Arnault: A Scion of Luxury Who Rejects the Label - Yahoo Finance,"Wed, 26 Feb 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9hbGV4YW5kcmUtYXJuYXVsdC1zY2lvbi1sdXh1cnktcmVqZWN0cy0yMzA1Mzg5NjcuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Luxury isn’t about the money.

That’s the counterintuitive message of Alexandre Arnault, the 27-year-old son of LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton chairman and France’s wealthiest man Bernard Arnault. The younger Arnault is anchoring his place in the family business as chief executive officer of German luggage company Rimowa, a role he’s held since LVMH acquired the brand in 2016.

The Arnault family wealth — recently estimated at $100.4 billion by Forbes’ Real-time Billionaires List — is rivaled only by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos’ $121.3 billion stockpile and Microsoft co-founder Bill Gate’s $109.8 billion kitty. But the younger Arnault told the lunch crowd at Goldman Sachs recently that “luxury” evokes connotations of extravagance and spending that detract from its real appeal — quality, at arguably any price.

Josh Murray, managing director of Goldman Sachs’ structured equity group, interviewed Arnault recently at a ‘Talks at GS’ lunchtime event in New York and pressed him on his reluctance to use the term “luxury.”

“In our financial communication we call ourselves the world leader in luxury goods,” Arnault said. “I don’t like to use it because I think it’s too linked to price. And I don’t think our industry has anything to do with price.

“When you think luxury, you think, stores where you’re going to have things you can’t afford, and you’re going to be scared to go inside and everything, and, to me, when you buy a Vuitton bag for $4,000, it’s a lot of money, it’s a luxury product. When you buy a bottle of Moet champagne for $40, it’s a luxury product — a lot of people can afford this, or Dior mascara for $25,” he said, referring to some of the more affordable offerings of LVMH brands Moët & Chandon and Christian Dior.

“Why? Because, those products, whether it’s a $40 bottle of champagne, the $1,000 Rimowa suitcase, or the million-dollar Tiffany necklace or whatever, are made with the same level of craftsmanship, of quality, of all the things that make those products desirable. And I don’t think price should really come into the equation,” he said.

Story continues

That was a reference to jeweler Tiffany & Co., which LVMH agreed to purchase in November for $16.2 billion. That counts as the largest luxury deal in the elder Arnault’s long career and one that Goldman played a role in, representing Tiffany after LVMH came calling.

During the talk, Arnault made his case for Rimowa as an emblem of that vision.

In the past three years, Rimowa has distanced itself from wholesale accounts, and embraced collaborations with on-trend names including streetwear brand Supreme and Off-White’s Virgil Abloh, who imprinted the ridged surfaces of Rimowa cases with such arch commentary as “Personal” and “Belongings” in large bold type.

The company has also sought to branch out from suitcases as it tries to become a larger presence in its customer’s travel ensemble. To that end, Rimowa has introduced travel products including iPhone covers as well as personal belongings cases in collaboration with LVMH-brand Dior and retailing at $2,440 on the Dior and Rimowa web sites.

The calculus seems to be working. At the time LVMH bought the 120-year-old family owned German brand, it was pulling in some 440 million euros in sales. Sales exceeded that level last year, Arnault said.

“Little by little, you’ll see us kind of come out with new products in the travel sphere that are both, true to our brand, and true to our promise of functional desirability,” said Arnault.

LVMH's Hennessy Cognac Just Became the Official Spirits Partner of the NBA - Yahoo Finance,"Mon, 10 Feb 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9sdm1oLWhlbm5lc3N5LWNvZ25hYy1qdXN0LWJlY2FtZS0yMTE1MDExMDMuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Click here to read the full article.

The NBA just scored the slam dunk of spirits partners.

On Monday, the National Basketball Association announced a multi-year partnership with none other than Hennessy, making the world’s best-selling cognac the official spirit of the NBA, Women’s National Basketball Association (WNBA) and USA Basketball.

More from Robb Report

Hennessy, the crown jewel of the LVMH group (and, of course, the H in its corporate initialism) is headquartered in the Charente region of western France and is considered one of the most premier spirits on the planet. Taking the reigns from Jack Daniel’s—which became the league’s spirits partner in 2017—Hennessy will kick off the partnership during the upcoming NBA All-Star Game.

The deal comes on the heels of the NBA’s first-ever regular-season game in France which took place on January 24. According to Dan Rosso, the NBA’s senior vice president of media and business development, it’s geared toward reaching and engaging with a broader segment of basketball fans around the NBA’s marquee moments.

“As the iconic brand continues to expand its business in sports marketing, we look forward to creating elevated experiences and unique initiatives that celebrate the game of basketball,” Rosso said in a press release.

And the partnership seems like a natural fit. For more than 250 years, Hennessy has adhered to its “Never stop. Never settle.” slogan and has continuously pushed the limits in the spirits sector. Similarly, the NBA continues to be a driving force in the sports industry.

“There’s an energy pulsing through the NBA that compels it to evolve, to push the limits of its own potential,” said Hennessy executive Giles Woodyer in a statement. “Our new collaborative journey is rooted in this joint passion and will explore the realms of legacy, culture and innovation.”

Story continues

So, when can fans expect to see the cognac courtside? The NBA and Hennessy will officially start the partnership this month during NBA All-Star Weekend 2020 in Chicago on February 16. Here, Hennessy will serve as an associate partner of the NBA Celebrity Game presented by Ruffles and as a presenting partner of the pre-game red carpet. You’ll find more information on the Hennessy website, Facebook page or Instagram. You can find a bottle of Hennesy here.

Three designers with an India connect have been shortlisted for the LVMH Prize this year - VOGUE India,"Tue, 25 Feb 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigAFodHRwczovL3d3dy52b2d1ZS5pbi9mYXNoaW9uL2NvbnRlbnQvbHZtaC1wcml6ZS10aHJlZS1pbmRpYW4tZGVzaWduZXJzLXNob3J0bGlzdGVkLXByaXlhLWFobHV3YWxpYS1rYXVzaGlrLXZlbGVuZHJhLXN1cHJpeWEtbGVsZdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Started in 2013 by the French luxury conglomerate, the LVMH Prize For Young Fashion Designers is an annual platform that helps launch upcoming talent on a global scale. Joining the league of Jacquemus, Vejas and Marine Serre, among others—previous winners of the title—this year’s winner will be finalised from a shortlist of 20 semi-finalists announced earlier this month. The competition invites designers under 40 from all over the world, who have produced at least two womenswear, menswear or unisex collections.

Among cult-favourite names like Peter Do, American label Area and Commission and Piero D’Angelo, three designers of Indian heritage have made it to the 2020 list for the first time. Here’s everything you need to know about the young labels, and what the prize will bring for them.

Priya Ahluwalia

A recent graduate of the University of Westminster, Ahluwalia has already made her presence felt strongly in the industry since completing her MA in Menswear. She showcased her spring/summer 2019 graduation collection—made from deadstock and second hand garments—at London Fashion Week in 2018, went on to win the 2019 H&M Design Award, and also received the NewGen award from the British Fashion Council. For autumn/winter 2020, the Indian-Nigerian menswear designer uses archival fabrics from Adidas for the ready-to-wear pieces. “It is such an honour to be shortlisted for such a prestigious competition. LVMH represents the epitome of luxury, design and heritage, and it is amazing to be recognised by such an institution. When I look at past participants to the competition, their careers have flourished afterwards, whether they won or not. I hope that I can follow in their footsteps,” she tells us.

Kaushik Velendra

The 29-year-old menswear designer debuted at London Fashion Week in 2019, among the CSM Masters line-up. For 2020, the Chennai-born designer continues his vision of breaking the rigid moulds of men’s tailoring with his exaggerated silhouettes, which explore anatomy. Spotted on Ranveer Singh and at the red carpets for the 2020 Grammys and BAFTAs, Velendra's star-studded journey has already begun. “It has been an absolute honour and privilege to have been shortlisted for the LVMH prize. Being nominated for the prize has been the best thing to happen to my brand, considering it has been just over a month since we launched. I’m ecstatic to meet the renowned leading mentors in the fashion industry, and be alongside some of the future faces of fashion,” says Kaushik Velendra.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9995301961898804}",neutral,0.9995301961898804,0
"World's richest man: Bernard Arnault was given the title briefly, until coronavirus hit - Fortune","Wed, 12 Feb 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vZm9ydHVuZS5jb20vMjAyMC8wMi8xMi93b3JsZHMtcmljaGVzdC1tYW4tY29yb25hdmlydXMtaW1wYWN0LWJlcm5hcmQtYXJuYXVsdC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Bernhard Arnault, the billionaire chief executive of the world’s biggest luxury goods company, LVMH, has had a memorable few months.

In November, the French dealmaker realized a long-held dream by clinching a $16 billion takeover of storied U.S. jeweler Tiffany’s. Then, in January, a surge in the value of his family’s stake (amounting to 47%) in LVMH briefly made him the world’s richest person. Oh, and the company he runs bought a tennis-ball-sized diamond, the second-biggest gem of its kind ever unearthed.

Feast your eyes on the Sewelo diamond.

But things have suddenly become more complicated for the urbane Monsieur Arnault. Just as the LVMH shares were hitting all-time records highs, news emerged of the coronavirus outbreak in China, the company’s fastest growing market.

Arnault, LVMH’s chief executive, was unruffled by the viral threat when questioned by analysts at the company’s annual results presentation on Jan. 28. “Let’s not panic,” he said. “Let’s analyze the situation calmly.”

The severity of the business impact, he said, would depend on however long the outbreak lasted. “If it’s resolved over the next two, two-and-a-half months, then it won’t be all that bad. If it were to last two years, it would be a totally different matter.” (Rival luxury brand Kering, owners of Gucci, made similarly vague reassurances).

“Wolf in cashmere”

The sangfroid is to be expected from a businessman who has been nicknamed “the wolf in cashmere” and “the emperor of luxury” during a lifetime of hard-nosed dealmaking that has seen him grow a struggling French textiles company, bought for a symbolic one franc in 1984, into the dominant luxury goods player with a market value of $230 billion.

Arnault sits atop a sprawling empire that is a veritable who’s who of luxury brands. LVMH’s drinks brands include Hennessy cognac and Moet & Chandon champagne, while in fashion and leather goods it owns Louis Vuitton, Loewe, Berluti, Christian Dior and Kenzo. Its perfumes include Guerlain and Givenchy while its watch and jewelry brands include Chaumet, Bulgari, Tag Heuer and Hublot.

LVMH’s annual results last month did not break out revenue from China but it said Asia, excluding Japan, accounted for 30% of LVMH’s revenue last year. That was despite what the company called a “difficult environment” in Hong Kong, which was rocked by months of anti-government protests last year. But that’s far from the full story; Chinese consumers typically make most luxury purchases abroad.

The coronavirus outbreak, which has killed more than 1,100 people, has not only emptied out luxury boutiques in China, it has prevented many affluent Chinese from traveling abroad.

Arnault presented last month bumper results for 2019 with LVMH revenues rising 15% to €53.7 billion ($58.5 billion) and group share of net profit rising 13% to €7.2 billion ($7.8 billion).

LVMH’s strong performance has driven the company’s shares up by more than 40% in the last year. But it’s down 7% since mid-January, which is eating into his immense personal wealth.

World’s richest…for a moment

The Arnault family’s controlling stake in the company turned Arnault briefly in December and again in January into the world’s richest person. But the drop in LVMH’s share price as the coronavirus crisis deepened has reduced Arnault’s fortune and dropped him down the list.

According to Forbes’ real-time billionaire’s list, Arnault currently ranks third among the world’s wealthiest, with a fortune of $110.2 billion, behind Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates on $112.7 billion and Amazon’s Jeff Bezos on $131.8 billion.

Arnault insists that making quality products is his main concern, not pursuing growth for its own sake.

“What we want is to continue to produce quality products and satisfy our customers. Growth is good. It delights the shareholders. I’m also a shareholder, so I can’t say that I look askance at it, but it’s not really the objective,” he told analysts.

At 70, Arnault’s ambition to come out on top burns as strongly as ever.

Last November, Arnault sealed the biggest ever deal in the luxury goods industry, snapping up U.S. jeweler Tiffany & Co, which he had long coveted, for $16.2 billion. When the deal completes later this year, LVMH will bring global heft to Tiffany, an 183-year-old company made famous by Audrey Hepburn in the classic 1961 movie “Breakfast at Tiffany’s.”

Louis Vuitton, part of Arnault’s empire, announced another audacious acquisition in January when it revealed it had bought, for an undisclosed price, the 1,758 carat Sewelo diamond, the world’s second largest rough diamond. The purchase of the gem, which will be cut into smaller stones, underlined Louis Vuitton’s ambitions in the most exclusive segment of the jewelry business.

It is second only to the 3,107 carat Cullinan diamond, found in South Africa in 1905. Several of the diamonds cut from that stone form part of the British crown jewels.

Arnault was again in the limelight after fire ravaged Paris’ ancient Notre Dame cathedral last April. LVMH and the Arnault family pledged 200 million euros ($218 million) to rebuild the Paris landmark the day after the blaze.

In 2019, LVMH also linked up with singer Rihanna to launch a new fashion label.

Born into a family of industrialists in Roubaix, northern France in March 1949, Arnault attended local schools before going on to study at France’s prestigious Ecole Polytechnique.

He began his career as an engineer with the Ferret-Savinel construction company, which his family owned, becoming chairman in 1978. In 1984, he took control, for a single franc, of the troubled Boussac textile company that owned the Christian Dior brand.

He turned Christian Dior into the cornerstone of his fledgling empire. In the late 1980s, Arnault built up a large stake in LVMH, which had recently been formed from the merger of Moet Hennessy and Louis Vuitton. He has been chairman and CEO of LVMH since 1989.

Since then, acquisitions have followed thick and fast, including Kenzo, Guerlain, Loewe, Marc Jacobs and Sephora.

He has had setbacks. One of the biggest was in 1999 when PPR, now called Kering, bested LVMH in a takeover battle for the Italian luxury brand Gucci.

Married with five children, Arnault is a well-known modern art collector, owning works by Pablo Picasso and Henry Moore.

And, yes, he enjoys playing tennis.

Monumental Merger: LVMH Purchases Tiffany & Co. for $16.2 Billion - Jetset Magazine,"Fri, 14 Feb 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmpldHNldG1hZy5jb20vZXhjbHVzaXZlL2J1c2luZXNzL21vbnVtZW50YWwtbWVyZ2VyLWx2bWgtcHVyY2hhc2VzLXRpZmZhbnktY28tZm9yLTE2LTItYmlsbGlvbi_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Monumental Merger: LVMH Purchases Tiffany & Co. for $16.2 Billion

It’s official. Come mid-2020, the world’s biggest luxury goods company, LVMH, and Tiffany & Company, will be teaming up in a massive merger that will reinvent the market for high-end jewelry. After months of negotiation, Louis Vuitton and its partner company Moët Hennessy have put forward a deal to acquire Tiffany & Co. for a staggering $16.2 billion price tag, expanding its already massive luxury retail empire.

Founded in 1837, Tiffany and Co. is a respected American department store known for its trademark shade of bird’s egg blue, as well as its central role in the classic film Breakfast at Tiffany’s, starring Hollywood icon Audrey Hepburn. The purchase will initiate LVMH’s broader strategy to overhaul the fine goods retailer for the 21st century, as millennial buying trends have shifted and altered the market for luxury products.

Ready for Revamp

Although Tiffany and its line of hand-crafted jewelry have been a staple of American retail for over 180 years, its primary source of revenue—pricy decorative merchandise, such as necklaces, watches, and home décor—has posed marketing challenges for the company in recent years. Data shows that millennial consumers are shying away from the indulgent splurges their parents preferred. In moving forward with this merger, CEO of LVMH Bernard Arnault sees a strategic opportunity to build on the storied history of Tiffany while revamping its product lines and marketing for a rapidly-evolving industry.

Already the company has recruited an army of influencers, including Elle Fanning and Kendall Jenner, for ad campaigns. With this new generation of celebrities and clientele, the masterminds behind the Tiffany brand hope to showcase its cutting-edge jewelry designs to younger viewers, primarily through social media. By also expanding its product lines to include purses and accessories, the company seeks to win over and cultivate new markets that stick around for years to come.

A Growing Influence

Adding Tiffany & Co. to its portfolio means that LVMH will increase its considerable dominance over the world’s luxury goods market. Between Louis Vuitton and Moët Hennessy, the two companies own and manage make-up retailer Sephora, fashion brand Dior, elegant jeweler Bulgari, and even wine manufacturer Don Pérignon, among others. Moët Hennessy itself produces top-notch alcoholic beverages in expertly crafted glass decanters, whose ingenuity and elegance have been highlighted by Jetset before in The Point of Elegance: Hennessy x Louis Vuitton Reveal in in Shanghai.

However, this bold business decision did not develop seamlessly overnight. Tiffany and Co. initially refused LVMH’s proposal, due to a dispute over the company’s valuation and share prices—two indicators that are notoriously difficult to assess, especially in the volatile luxury goods market. After reviewing Tiffany’s assets carefully, Arnault updated his proposal, giving the deal legs and forever altering the trajectory of this beloved American retailer. Once shareholders finalize the merger in the coming months, LVMH will oversee 75 luxury brands across the globe, advancing its unparalleled influence over what the world’s most discerning customers want and buy.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9871245622634888}",neutral,0.9871245622634888,0
Why Tag Heuer still believes in Shanghai - Style,"Sat, 22 Feb 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjbXAuY29tL21hZ2F6aW5lcy9zdHlsZS9sdXh1cnkvYXJ0aWNsZS8zMDUxNjEyL3doeS10YWctaGV1ZXItcGlja2VkLWNhcmEtZGVsZXZpbmduZS1sYXVuY2gtaXRzLWNoaW5lc2XSAXNodHRwczovL2FtcC5zY21wLmNvbS9tYWdhemluZXMvc3R5bGUvbHV4dXJ5L2FydGljbGUvMzA1MTYxMi93aHktdGFnLWhldWVyLXBpY2tlZC1jYXJhLWRlbGV2aW5nbmUtbGF1bmNoLWl0cy1jaGluZXNl?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"This year, TAG Heuer marks 50 years of the Monaco. Stéphane Bianchi, CEO of LVMH watchmaking division and CEO of TAG Heuer, reveals the reason for its lasting popularity, and why one of the anniversary models was launched in Shanghai.

The latest instalment in our On Work series with luxury CEOs. This month: Stéphane Bianchi, CEO of LVMH watchmaking division and CEO of TAG Heuer

2015-2018: Board member of Maus Frères, responsible for brands like Lacoste, Gant and Aigle

1998-2015: CEO of cosmetics and beauty brand Yves Rocher

1994-1998: Joined Yves Rocher Group

Why is the Monaco more popular now than ever?

It’s been growing in popularity over the past 10 years. It accounts for more than 20 per cent of our sales in France. In 1969, when it was launched, it was not popular at all. It was too different. It was blue – people were not used to having blue dials; they preferred white or black. Having the crown on the left was a crazy thing. Square? Wow! People didn’t like it very much at all.

What made it famous was the film [ Le Mans , 1971]. Since then, people who love cars and motorsports in Europe have been wearing a TAG Heuer Monaco. Then there is the famous Formula One Grand Prix in Monaco, where every year we speak about the Monaco watch and TAG Heuer. Step by step, it has developed into a real big story. And now it looks modern. It was much too far ahead of its time – and now it’s in its time.

Why launch one of the 50th anniversary models in Shanghai?

We started with Monaco, during the Grand Prix, as we couldn’t possibly start with another city. Then we went to Le Mans. Again, we had to. Then we went to New York, then Tokyo. Why did we finish with China and Shanghai? It’s simple – because China is a country that inspires us. It’s always innovating. There is a lot of tradition but the country’s always looking ahead. Every time I visit Shanghai it’s like a different city, there’s something new. From the beginning we thought the most contemporary limited edition should be launched in Shanghai. To us, it’s the most contemporary city in the world.

Cara Delevingne is launching the Shanghai edition of the Monaco. How do you choose your brand ambassadors?

Firstly, they have to be loyal to the brand and they have to like the brand. They have to [agree] with our way of doing things. We are a cool brand. Cara is cool. Our ambassador has to be proud to wear our watches and speak freely about the brand. [There has to be] good communication between the brand and the ambassadors.

What are TAG Heuer’s strengths as a brand?

It’s avant-garde. It’s different from the others. Our watches [adopt] a “show me rather than show off” approach. Wearing a TAG Heuer shows who you are. It’s for rising achievers. It’s not for someone who says, “I’ve done everything. Now I’m the king and this is my reward.” With TAG Heuer it’s a never-ending story. Every finish line is a new start line. This is the main difference between TAG Heuer [and other brands].

We are a competitive and challenging brand, always on the move. We’re a good match for China, which is also always on the move, always innovating, always going forward. But the brand has to be consistent. We need to have a strategy and stay with that strategy. We shouldn’t dilute our brand, otherwise we’re not a brand.

What are the personal challenges you face as a CEO?

[I face] the same challenges that every CEO faces – develop the brand, develop new products, make the team successful, make the team understand the strategy. It’s about teamwork. It’s not one person’s work.

I have to get my team on the same page because I can’t be in every market. For me, what’s most important is teamwork. I’ve been CEO of a group for the past 20 years and it’s always the same challenges – try to make the brand the same everywhere in the world and try to make people understand the brand.

How do you market a mechanical watch when consumers have an eye on smartwatches?

Firstly, we will have a new smartwatch this year. But it’s not for the same consumer. A mechanical watch is more than just a tool to read the time. For men, it’s like jewellery, it’s a way to be different. A mechanical watch is all about precision, detail and shape.

On certain TAG Heuer watches, when you look at the back you can see 350 pieces. There are 130 operations just on the dial. It’s a piece of perfection. We can fit so many mechanical pieces in such a tiny space. It’s like magic.

Watches can be emotional as well. A watch can be a gift for your wedding or graduation. Whenever you look at it, you see that moment. It’s precision, it’s emotion, it’s beauty. It’s everything. It’s all in a mechanical watch.

Exec On Sephora's Retail Strategy

Jeff Gaul, Sephora's senior vice president of real estate and store development, told CNBC in an interview the company will focus on growing its off-mall locations.

Doing so would better position the beauty retailer to be closer to where its core clients live and work, he said. It also makes it easier for customers to merely ""pull right up and grab something.""

Sephora plans on focusing more on non-urban markets, such as Charlotte, North Carolina and Nashville, Tennessee.

Gaul also commented on Sephora's relationship with the struggling department store J C Penney Company Inc (NYSE: JCP).

Sephora's store-in-a-store concept inside JCPenney remains an ""ongoing"" partnership, and the beauty chain has no major closures planned, the exec said. Exposure inside JCPenney also gives Sephora exposure to new customers.

LVMH, Ulta Price Action

According to CNBC, Sephora's growth plans will put it in direct competition with Ulta Beauty Inc (NASDAQ: ULTA) whose stores are more often located away from large malls.

Ulta shares were down 0.52% at $273.52 at the close Tuesday, while LVMH shares were higher by 3.74% at $90.62.

Sephora will focus on opening stores that are slightly smaller, at around 4,000 square feet compared to its current average of 5,500. The stores will also focus on fragrances and hair care, which represent two notable growth segments.

It was founded in 1945 by Céline Vipiana. LVMH Moët Hennessy – Louis Vuitton SEalso known as LVMH, is a French multinational luxury goods conglomerate headquartered in Paris (France).

Entrupy Sneaker Authentication System Launch - HYPEBEAST,"Wed, 05 Feb 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vaHlwZWJlYXN0LmNvbS8yMDIwLzIvZW50cnVweS1zbmVha2Vycy1hdXRoZW50aWNhdGlvbi1sZWdpdC1jaGVjay10ZWNoLWxhdW5jaNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LVMH accelerator participant Entrupy recently unveiled a new sneaker authentication system that is able to determine whether a sneaker is counterfeit or not in about one minute. The system was developed as a way to combat the growing counterfeit industry — which mainly encompasses handbags and sneakers — and to empower retailers, resellers, marketplaces to add data-driven research to their processes.

Entrupy’s “Legit Check Tech” system for sneakers includes an app and a physical box that photographs various points of interest of the shoe. Before placing a pair of sneakers in the box, the app first prompts users to select whether the shoe is Nike or adidas (more brands likely to come). It then takes users through a series of additional questions, asking them to photograph specific areas of the shoe through its interface. An important part of this first step is photographing the sneaker’s size tag (as shown in the gallery above).

After placing one of the shoes in the box, iPods then photograph eight general images of the shoe, including side views, a frontal view and a close-up of the sole. Once the images are sent back to the app, it takes around 10 seconds for the system to analyze the data and determine whether or not the sneaker is “authentic” or “unidentified.”

So far, Entrupy’s Co-founder and CEO Vidyuth Srinivasan tells HYPEBEAST that the Legit Check Tech system has had a 100% success rate. In order to reach this level of accuracy, his team has tested hundreds of fakes — even multiple levels of fakes for each popular style. Legit Check Tech is so accurate that it can recognize when a counterfeit shoe is made in the same factory as an authentic Nike shoe.

Srinivasan recognizes that, as with any data-driven system, an error may slip through the cracks eventually. In order to instill a high level of trust in its users, each pair is backed by Entrupy’s financial guarantee. If a counterfeit pair passes its system, Entrupy will reimburse the buyer for the cost. This not only ensures the user will get their money back, but it also allows Entrupy to learn and improve its system.

The tech and idea behind Legit Check Tech are solid, but the question of who will be able to use it still remains. Resellers and airport customs could see this as a worthwhile investment, but it’s hard to imagine this being used in one-off retail shops and by casual eBay resellers. Entrupy could possibly need to co-sign or partner with a large reselling platform to get a strong foothold in the industry – like if eBay or Grailed were to establish Entrupy as a trusted third party evaluator.

Entrupy has already become known for its successful handbag authentication tech, which sparked a lot of interest from LVMH in 2019. Its Legit Check Tech system will likely follow suit as the sneaker industry continues to expand – the way in which this happens is just yet to be seen.

The Italian luxury company pledged 1 million yuan (RM591,033) to the Chinese Red Cross Foundation to alleviate the deficit of medical supplies.

Capri Holdings Ltd, parent company of Versace that also owns Jimmy Choo and Michael Kors, said that the virus is expected to reduce this quarter’s revenues by US$100 million (RM412 million) as the outbreak continues to spread.

A number of other luxury companies have already made donations over the past few weeks. The Kering Group, parent company of brands including Saint Laurent, Gucci, Balenciaga, Alexander McQueenn and Ulysse Nardin, donated 7.5 million yuan (RM4.43 million) to the Red Cross Foundation in Hubei. The funds will be used to care for medical staff and patients at hospitals as well as for public health education.

Paris-based fashion conglomerate LVMH Moët Hennessy, which owns Louis Vuitton, Fendi, Christian Dior and Celine pledged 16 million yuan (RM9.46 million), also donated to the same foundation. Other brands have pledged aid too, including Estée Lauder with 2 million yuan (RM1.18 million) and Austrian glass producer Swarovski with 3 million yuan (RM1.77 million).

Fashion houses have warned investors that sales could take a hit as streets in China, as well as populous cities in the world, are faced with shuttered stores and empty streets. Additional travel restrictions have also caused a massive drop in spending by Chinese tourists abroad. The situation is worsened with flight cancellations as most airlines are suspended from and to China.

Fashion heavy-hitters aside, large multinationals in the US and Europe including Microsoft, Dell, L’Oreal and Cargill have collectively donated roughly 10 million yuan (RM5.91 million) to authorities in Hubei province battling the epidemic. Apple's Tim Cook announced that the company would instead contribute efforts on the ground.

Alibaba founder Jack Ma, the second-richest person in China, reportedly pledged 100 million yuan (RM59.13 million) to develop a coronavirus vaccine through his Jack Ma Foundation. The company will also help hospitals to acquire medical supplies in Wuhan, the central Chinese city where the epidemic first emerged.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.989015519618988}",neutral,0.989015519618988,0

Louis Vuitton has just opened up its first-ever restaurant – Le Café V. LVMH Moet Hennessy had been exploring the idea of entering the hospitality business, and their first step has been the opening of Le Café V at their new flagship boutique in Osaka, Japan. The announcement followed up the brand’s unveiling of the Sewelo, the second largest rough diamond ever discovered (it measures 1,748 carat).

The opening of the restaurant suggests that Louis Vuitton will be looking for even more opportunities. In fact, Michael Burke, the chairman and chief executive officer of Vuitton, hinted at more eateries and even hotels at the announcement of the restaurant. “We think the so-called experiential luxury is something that will be important in the future,” stated Louis Vuitton’s chief financial officer Jean-Jacques Guiony. The restaurant falls right in line with recent acquisitions for LVMH. Just 18 months ago the brand acquired Tiffany, which owned the Blue Box Café at its Fifth Avenue Flagship. LVMH also picked up Belmond Ltd., which includes 46 luxury hotel, restaurant, and train and river cruise properties in 24 countries.

With spending on gourmet food and fine dining rising 6 percent in 2019, according to the Altagamma Worldwide Luxury Market Monitor by Bain & Co., getting into the hospitality business is a wise move on LVMH’s side. Luxury cruises also saw an increase, gaining 9 percent. Private yacht and jet sales jumped 5 percent while fine wines and spirits also saw a 5 percent increase. Personal luxury goods like those made by Louis Vuitton? They only rose 4 percent.

The menu for the restaurant, located on the top floor of the four-level Vuitton maison, is by celebrated Japanese chef Yosuke Suga. There is also an adjoining bar and a terrace. A lucky few will also be able to enjoy dinner at the Sugalabo V in an open kitchen.

Fashion brands turn to hackathons to crack sustainability strategies - Vogue Business,"Tue, 11 Feb 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijQFodHRwczovL3d3dy52b2d1ZWJ1c2luZXNzLmNvbS90ZWNobm9sb2d5L2Zhc2hpb24tYnJhbmRzLXR1cm4tdG8taGFja2F0aG9ucy10by1jcmFjay1zdXN0YWluYWJpbGl0eS1zdHJhdGVnaWVzLWx2bWgtbW9uY2xlci1rZXJpbmctcHJhZGEtZ3JvdXDSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The app already tracks carbon emissions, water consumption, air and water pollution along the supply chain. By the end of the competition, Daveu and the jury of experts — pulled from Kering brands, Google, the media company Corporate Knights and the World Wildlife Fund — awarded a €10,000 prize to a team of six who created a prediction and recommendation engine that would further assist designers.

In an effort to think and operate more like tech companies, fashion has embraced hackathons, once reserved for intensive digital prototyping by coders and software engineers. Now, the practice is becoming more targeted. In addition to Kering, LVMH, Prada Group and German online retailer Zalando have held hackathons centred on sustainability, as pressure surrounding the environmental impact of luxury fashion mounts.

The challenge lies in whether the proposed solutions generated by hackathons can and will be implemented in the real world — and whether they’ll have a measurable positive impact on the environment.

Move fast and fix things

Fashion companies are turning to hackathons to spark carbon footprint-reducing ideas as the industry grapples with challenges including waste management, greenhouse gas emissions and water usage. They’re also a way for companies to both advertise and convey action surrounding their commitment to sustainability.

Moncler’s hackathon in July listed sustainability as one of the problem areas it would address, while LVMH brings together employees from across sectors, disciplines and continents in order to identify talent and new innovations for their hackathons. Some of LVMH’s more successful hackathons have yielded projects including zero-waste packaging for its wine and spirits category, and the implementation of a process that turns grape seed waste from its wine portfolio into a cosmetics ingredient. LVMH told the Financial Times in January that other eco-design innovations are currently in development.

For its 2019 hackathon, Burberry invited 35 undergrad and graduate UK students with design, engineering and business backgrounds to create a physical prototype of a “Trench Coat of the Future” with help from Burberry’s design and R&D teams. The goal was to glean ideas for sustainable innovation, plus find promising talent.

“It was a very positive experience,” says a member of the winning team, who signed an NDA and spoke anonymously. “How often do we get to sit down with engineers and people from multidisciplinary backgrounds?” Burberry is currently looking to test the winning team’s proposal of a new leather-tanning technology that uses 70 per cent less water.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.6752626895904541}",neutral,0.6752626895904541,0

Wall Street complains: “The ECB helped LVMH's acquisition of Tiffany” - LaConceria | Il portale dell'area pelle - laconceria.it,"Thu, 27 Feb 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxhY29uY2VyaWEuaXQvZW4vZmluYW5jZS93YWxsLXN0cmVldC1jb21wbGFpbnMtdGhlLWVjYi1oZWxwZWQtbHZtaHMtYWNxdWlzaXRpb24tb2YtdGlmZmFueS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Wall Street is complaining: the details on the role payed by the European Central Bank in the operation that led LVMH to purchase Tiffany is irritating the US-based financial community. The first to brak this news was Bloomberg, stating that “France’s richest man was helped by the ECB”. Why? “Because the corporate bonds emitted by LVMH to buy Tiffany ended up being less costly than Mr. Arnault could have ever hoped for”.

Wall Street is unhappy

Online news source Zerohedge adds to the accusation: “The ECB helps France’s richest man in getting even richer”. According to the reconstruction of the events, the acquisition operation ended up being way more convenient for Arnault than he expected: “When he offered 16 billion for Tiffany he knew he would have had to emit a 10 billion USD bond to finance the operation – reads Zerohedge -. He also knew it wouldn’t have been a problem, as the ECB was going to help. But even Mr. Arnault couldn’t have imagined this bond was going to end up paying part of his income”.

Financial schemes

These are some stock-related technicisms, but it’s worth getting a better understanding of the issues. LVMH emitted a 7.5 billion euro bond, along with a 1.55 billion UK pounds bond to purchase Tiffany: the owed amounts can be paid anywhere between 2 an 11 years. The difference is made by the rate: “the bonds are very convenient for billionaire Arnault – summarizes Italia Oggi -, as they were expected to have a rate of between 0% and 1%, at the end, both were emitted at negative rates. Simply put, investors who bought the bonds paid Mr. Arnault to borrow money (as it would happen with negative interest rates for banks)”. What does the ECB have to do with it? It made the deal possible by purchasing the bonds directly (up to 20%), thank to the “189 billion-euro Corporate Sector Purchasing Program, which lowered the ‘spread’ to receive credit”.

The commentary

Wall Street is disappointed. First because Christine Lagarde, president of the ECB, was unable to provide a clear explanation of the central bank’s role in the purchase. But also because this is a political matter: “How would have European reacted – asks Zerohedge -, if the FED (Federal Reserves), was to directly help a US-based corporation in purchasing a European giant?”.

Bulgari's ""Mai Troppo"" campaign. Image credit: LVMH

Roman jeweler Bulgari has launched a new advertising campaign called ""Mai Troppo,"" which translates into ""Never too much"" in a campaign that matches Rome's flamboyance with the models' jewels.

Breaking on social media over the weekend, the campaign by the LVMH-owned brand is all about enjoying life's little moments, big and small. It is centered around a short film about a mysterious woman who is being talked about by everyone in Rome.

The ad stars actresses Naomi Scott and Zendaya, as well as supermodel Lily Aldridge. Swedish director and photographer Johan Renck created the images.

Ring of mystery

Ms. Aldridge wears Bulgari high jewelry while walking the dogs by Fori Imperiali and posing at night in front of the Fountain of Trevi.

Ms. Scott wears B.zero1 rings while eating chocolate dessert in a high-tech kitchen and explores the streets of Rome in Divas’ Dream jewels.

Zendaya, who has on a Octo Roma watch while attending a masquerade ball, wears a sparkling diamond from the Forever collection while posing in a garden.

Chinese-Canadian pop star Kris Wu also makes an appearance, drinking coffee in an elegant cafe.

“She’s here,"" actors from the spot say. ""Everyone thinks she’s so interesting.”

""She loves dogs,"" says a bartender in the film. ""She's always in the right place.""

“She just has too much style,"" says an actress. ""She just has too much everything.”

The film is full of footage of Rome's flamboyant sites that include statues, bridges, shots of the Coliseum, Villa Adriana in Tivoli and Villa Aldobrandini in Frascati, and even the Eternal City's famous traffic and opera. It ends with each of the stars saying the tag line, ""Mai Troppo.""

The campaign uses a special Italian flavor to showcase the brand's luxurious jewelry, while illustrating that Bulgari can be integrated into everyday experiences from fancy parties to the tennis court.

Chinese target

The Italian flamboyancy is appealing to audiences all over the world.

Affluent consumers in China are one of the fast-growing demographics for Bulgari and Mr. Wu's appearance hints at this target.

The company's Jean-Christophe Babin recently said that he recognizes how China has been the fastest-developing luxury market in the world, responsible for a large share of the world’s luxury goods consumption.

With a much younger luxury-goods clientele than most countries, China is by far the main driving power when it comes to product development and marketing. Mr. Babin said the biggest challenge for luxury brands vying for the Chinese audience is finding the perfect blend of product and target marketing that appeals to younger, wealthy customers.

“Chinese clients are buying the iconic collections such as B.zero1 and Serpenti, like the rest of the world, but there are some specificities in that market that we cater to, so you will find certain materials and Bulgari products there that you won’t find in the rest of the world,” Mr. Babin said (see story).

This latest effort suggests that these young affluent Chinese consumers are attracted to a glamorous and dazzling Italian story.

The enduring lure of luxury - Drapers,"Fri, 28 Feb 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRyYXBlcnNvbmxpbmUuY29tL2NvbXBhbmllcy90aGUtZW5kdXJpbmctbHVyZS1vZi1sdXh1cnnSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The challenges facing fashion retail – falling sales, the shift of spend to online, high street store closures and job losses – are unrelenting and show no signs of ending soon. However, one sector seems relatively immune: luxury is quietly thriving.

Global revenue at LVMH was up 15% year on year to £45bn in 2019, while fellow luxury house Kering’s 2019 revenue rose by 16.2% to £13.3bn. High-end department store Selfridges reported a 5% boost in sales over the Christmas period.

The UK luxury market was worth £46.1bn in 2019, Euromonitor International data shows. It is predicted to grow 3.5% to £47.7bn this year.

Helen Brocklebank, CEO of luxury industry body Walpole, which counts Burberry, Selfridges and Harrods among its 250 members, observes: “Business is really robust. We’re coming off the back of 49% growth over the last four years – the luxury sector has been in an incredibly good place. We haven’t seen the same impact as high street businesses. Bricks-and-mortar retailers such as Selfridges, Harrods and Fortnum & Mason have done particularly well – outperforming the market. The international customer is really strong.

“British luxury businesses are less dependent on the domestic customer than their high street counterparts. We’re very lucky in this country, as we have a very high-spending international customer.”

Importance of China

Research by Walpole shows that Chinese customers make up 22% of the luxury spend in the UK, and 33% globally – which is why travel bans in the wake of coronavirus could have important implications for the luxury sector. At the end of January, the UK Foreign Office advised against all but non-essential travel between the UK and China. British Airways has suspended all flights to and from Beijing until 29 February and Virgin Atlantic has grounded flights from Heathrow to Shanghai until 28 March.

Coronavirus is a speed bump, but not a long-term threat Helen Brocklebank, Walpole

Brocklebank continues: “If you’re looking at a third of your sales, then luxury is quite concerned. If almost a quarter of the shoppers in the market aren’t able to travel, sales are undoubtedly being impacted.”



However, she downplays the long-term impact on the luxury market: “It’s a speed bump, but not a long-term threat. Only about 11% of British luxury goods are exported to Greater China. It’s a relatively small market for the UK. It hasn’t impacted sales for Chinese New Year, as those who were coming to shop were already here.”

Brocklebank says the reaction of the UK and Chinese governments has been much swifter to the coronavirus outbreak than that of SARS in 2003.

“A downturn is unavoidable, but it will be much shorter than in the last outbreak of 2003 – back then it had an impact of six months. This time as the action to contain the virus has been much quicker, so we hope it will be four months.”

She concludes: “It’s a great shame. People are ill and that’s what we need to focus our thoughts on first. It will be relatively short lived, and businesses will bounce back.”

Galvan spring 20

British brand Burberry warned at the start of this month that coronavirus has had a “material negative effect” on luxury demand in the Chinese market. The luxury label closed 24 of its 64 Chinese stores at the beginning of February.

One former luxury retail director says: “Burberry and other luxury brands there will be affected. It involves inbound tourists as well – the Chinese mainland customer is not going into the cities to shop.”

Before the outbreak, Burberry reported positive third-quarter results. Store sales were up 3%, and revenue rose by 1% to £719m in the 13 weeks to 28 December 2019 compared with the same period in 2018.

The importance of the Chinese shopper was cemented in its January report, when the brand attributed some of this success to its “continued focus on Chinese consumers, including taking our runway show to Shanghai”, which shows just how much the luxury market relies on the demographic.



While Brocklebank insists that the coronavirus will only have a short-term impact, brands including Ralph Lauren have also issued a profit warning – earlier in February, it stated expectations for its fourth-quarter sales in Asia to be hit by £43m-£54m.

The US company gets 4% of its total revenue from China, where it had to temporarily close two-thirds of it 110 stores – and also said that global fourth-quarter orders could be affected as a result of disruptions in the supply chain.

Capri Holdings, the parent company of brands including Michael Kors, Versace and Jimmy Choo, warned in early February that revenue could be hit by £77m, and had to close 150 of its 220 stores in China. Its chief executive John D Idol said that the effects of the coronavirus were having “a material impact on our business.”

Big overseas spenders

Coronavirus is having less impact on the UK’s biggest foreign luxury spenders: customers from the Middle East.

Luca Solca, head of luxury goods research at Bernstein, explains: “The UK has been an attractive destination for some of the most important nationalities in the luxury high end, namely the Middle Eastern customer.” He attributes this to “tradition, and Britain’s presence in that area”, adding that tourist spend overal accounts for “more than 50% of luxury demand, when you account for overseas nationals living here”.

A superior shopping experience creating lasting memories is just as important as the products Derrick Hardman, Global Blue

Tax-free shopping specialist Global Blue defines “elite” international shoppers as the 0.5% that account for 17% of tax-free spend. In the UK, it says those from the Gulf states account for 30% of this group. They spend an average of £29,520 in UK transactions, and are attracted to department stores, where they make 85% of their purchases. It found that the Chinese customer is the second biggest spender, followed by those from South-East Asia, the US and Russia.

Shoppers from the Gulf states are particularly attracted to department stores, where they make 85% of their purchases.

Global Blue managing director Derrick Hardman explains their attractions: “A superior shopping experience creating lasting memories is just as important as the products [international visitors] purchase and take home.

“Department stores such as Harrods, Selfridges, Fortnum & Mason and Liberty have increasingly established experiential VIP services and lounges devoted to these elite shoppers – these offer personal invitation, one-to-one treatment, and exclusive brand collaborations and products.”

Giulio Cinque, owner of Cambridge high-end boutique Giulio Fashion, which stocks Burberry and Alexander McQueen, argues that these expectations extend into the luxury independent sector: “The consumer is searching for an emotional experience and is prepared to pay for it.

“Luxury is doing well as a result of the high street not delivering the aspirations its consumers are looking for, and the consumer finding that aspiration in luxury.”

Ida Petersson, director of men’s and womenswear buying at Browns, agrees that customer involvement sets the market apart: “There are definitely opportunities in the luxury market, with the in-store experiences and events that are offered, that go outside of the normal product and operational side of our business.”

Britain’s departure from the European Union by the end of the year is likely to impact trade with the UK’s largest export market: 42% of British luxury goods are exported to the EU, 23% to the US and 11% to China.

But Solca believes that Brexit might not be so negative for the luxury sector, he tells Drapers

“I believe Brexit could potentially help the luxury market in the UK, as it could allow continental European visitors to buy duty free – the same way as Swiss or Chinese tourists do.”

Brocklebank explains: “The challenge that every luxury business has is the change in trading conditions that come from the back of Brexit.” Walpole said last month “the introduction of friction in the form of tariffs or of new administrative burdens around the movement of goods and delivery of services will be an unwelcome and additional cost on luxury businesses used to trading freely across the channel”.

She also cites the 25% tariff on some EU goods – imposed by the US in October 2019, as another challenge for the luxury industry, and UK textile manufacturers as cashmere is included, “It is affecting suiting, pyjamas – a number of categories that will impact British businesses. We’re working with the government to try to solve this as soon as possible.”

Despite the trade war, Brocklebank believes the US is “a bigger market than China”, adding: “We’ve been thinking of how to reinforce those export opportunities.”

A cultural shift

Another challenge to the sector is changing attitudes to shopping, which is impacting all areas of the fashion industry. Consumers are increasingly prioritising spending on experiences, rather than goods. In January, Barclaycard research showed that spending on clothing fell by 3%, while the amount spent on experiences such as cinema tickets rose 19% in December 2019.

Burberry spring 20

The former luxury retail director tells Drapers: “There’s just been a cultural change to spending on clothes. It’s across all sectors. I know people who shop on the high street, and luxury consumers who would rather go out for a nice dinner than buy another shirt.”

He continues: “Everyone’s considering sustainability – how many clothes they have or what that’s doing to the planet. There really seems to be a big conscience around that. It’s having a knock-on effect on people’s shopping habits.”

But those choosing to spend more wisely on better, but fewer items, could also provide a boost to the luxury market, as shoppers choose higher-value products that will last longer over cheaper fast fashion.

Boutique owner Cinque says: “In general I think consumers are being more considerate towards over-consumption, the planet and are starting to buy less, meaning what they buy will be a more considered purchase and not just another throw away item.

Petersson agrees: “Non-apparel had a smashing year with the customer returning to luxury investments and slowing down on quick pick-me-ups from the contemporary world.”

Womenswear label 16Arlington designers Marco Capaldo and Kikka Cavenati agree: “The luxury market’s performing better than ever because of a shift in mindset about buying quality over quantity and investing in pieces that have longevity within in a women’s wardrobe. Pieces that can be re-worn, re-worked, re-imagined are where people would rather spend their money these days.”

Katherine Holmgren, CEO of designer label Galvan, also believes that shoppers are buying less, but better, “As the fashion community focuses increasingly on sustainability, we see customers moving away from fast fashion or trend-driven purchases and instead investing in fewer pieces that are higher quality and longer lasting.”

The year is off to less than a flying start for retailers, though the luxury industry appears in a stronger state than the high street, thanks to affluent international customers. While the coronavirus is a setback because of the powerful influence of Chinese shoppers, the effects on the luxury market may only be visible on a short-term basis. Brexit could allow the sector to target new international customers","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9996647834777832}",positive,0.9996647834777832,1
