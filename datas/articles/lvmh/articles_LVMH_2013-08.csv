Luxury’s 25 Most Innovative Brands: Louis Vuitton - Robb Report,"Thu, 01 Aug 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vcm9iYnJlcG9ydC5jb20vc3R5bGUvZmFzaGlvbi9sdXh1cnlzLTI1LW1vc3QtaW5ub3ZhdGl2ZS1icmFuZHMtbG91aXMtdnVpdHRvbi0yMzQwOTkv0gFgaHR0cHM6Ly9yb2JicmVwb3J0LmNvbS9zdHlsZS9mYXNoaW9uL2x1eHVyeXMtMjUtbW9zdC1pbm5vdmF0aXZlLWJyYW5kcy1sb3Vpcy12dWl0dG9uLTIzNDA5OS9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"In 1858, Louis Vuitton created the first flat, stackable travel trunk—a concept that, though revolutionary for the luggage industry at the time, seems in hindsight a rather modest beginning for one of the world’s largest producers of luxury goods. Today, Louis Vuitton is a flagship brand of the LVMH group, the French conglomerate that generated sales of approximately $37 billion last year from the sale of complicated watches, fine jewelry, and stylish clothing and accessories for men and women.

Even among LVMH’s impressive portfolio of brands, Louis Vuitton stands out for its ability to fulfill the wishes of its clients, no matter how exacting these may be. Its global footprint notwithstanding, the house remains an exclusive carriage-trade business, operating bespoke workshops in France and Italy for custom luggage, handbags, and footwear. Artisans, for instance, have delivered on requests for trunks that accommodate a variety of items, including a folding bed, a library of books, and a sound system with an iPod docking station and speakers. The brand also offers high fashion designed under the aegis of its creative director, Marc Jacobs, whose influence extends far beyond the house’s many collections for men and women. At the same time, Louis Vuitton has emerged, somewhat paradoxically, as an emblem of mass luxury, supplying consumers the world over with a variety of products bearing its LV logo, which was unveiled in 1896. The firm’s creative team has continued to spur interest in its classic LV bags and other gear by offering even more covetable versions through collaborations with such artists as Takashi Murakami and Stephen Sprouse.

In recent years, Louis Vuitton has emphasized its beginnings, training a new generation of artisans to craft leather goods and footwear using century-old techniques. The company has also refreshed its canvas designs: The Damier, a checked pattern that debuted at the Paris World’s Fair in 1889, for example, was reintroduced this past spring in a neon palette. Still, despite its formidable growth, the brand has stayed true to its original mission by opening specialty shops around the globe that offer expansive collections of luggage, accessories, and clothing to elegantly outfit the well-heeled traveler. 866.884.8866, www.louisvuitton.com

Luxury's Veteran Leader - INSEAD Knowledge,"Thu, 01 Aug 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8va25vd2xlZGdlLmluc2VhZC5lZHUvbGVhZGVyc2hpcC1vcmdhbmlzYXRpb25zL2x1eHVyeXMtdmV0ZXJhbi1sZWFkZXLSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"We size each other up a bit, Domenico De Sole and I, in the lobby of his central London hotel, to see how much we may have changed in the dozen or so years since the “Handbag Wars” in which Gucci – under the leadership of De Sole – fought to stay out of the clutches of LVMH – under the leadership of Bernard Arnaud.

That two-year battle ended September 10, 2011, when PPR and LVMH signed a deal in which PPR (which had essentially taken over Gucci in a white knight manoeuver orchestrated by De Sole himself, showing his Harvard Law School-corporate lawyer roots) agreed to buy LVMH’s stake in Gucci two years out for the closing market price. That was he day before two hijacked planes toppled the World Trade Towers in Manhattan and the world changed. Shares of luxury goods companies crashed but Gucci was still stuck with paying the higher price for LVMH shares.

Now, as if nine years in the high-powered world of luxury wasn’t enough - a stint that included taking Gucci from near-bankruptcy, with everything from tax evasion to murder in its murky past, to the keystone of the PPR luxury group – De Sole is back at it as chairman of Tom Ford International.

“Tom and I left for the U.S. on the same day,” he reminisces. “May 1, 2004. It was a difficult moment for me and I know it was a difficult moment for Tom Ford.”

“I don’t play golf”

The Rome native and his American-born wife Eleanore decamped to the Sea Pines Resort in Hilton Head, North Carolina – a haven overlooking the sea with nearly two dozen golf courses. Since 2005, one room has served as De Sole’s global headquarters. The man doesn’t play golf. Retirement was no more than a pit stop.

“I went to visit Tom at his beautiful ranch in Santa Fe (New Mexico) just a social visit, no business purpose. He was about to make a movie (“A Single Man”) and he said he wanted to go back into business. So my advice to him was it had to be done pretty quickly. We agreed and went back into business together... and my retirement was postponed.”

Once the decision was made, things moved fast: start-up money came from their own pockets; makeup and eyewear licensing agreements with Estee Lauder and the Marcolin Group, respectively, were signed in 2005. The products themselves were launched the next year, and in April 2007 the first collection was presented at the first store, in New York, for men. De Sole himself is decked out in it: suit, shirt, tie... Women’s clothing was launched in September 2010.

It’s that timing thing again: 2007 was not the best year to launch a business, even with an internationally known name. “It was a difficult time, you know – ’08, ’09, part of 2010, but we moved along and felt very proud of the progress the brand has made.”

That progress comes about as the artful manipulation of expansion and cost control, of licensing and keeping a close eye on details. Tom Ford International has 20 stores, seven of which have opened in the past 12 months or so, plus a flagship store in London which opened this autumn. Besides the U.S. and Milan, there are stores in China, Japan, Korea and Hong Kong.

The Store’s the Thing

Stores are De Sole’s weakness. ""We do invest in beautiful stores because it’s part of the approach to the brand – to be a leading luxury brand."" All the stores now feature both men’s and women’s clothes. Distribution is tightly controlled. “Its very limited distribution,” says De Sole. “Outside of our own stores, to give you an idea, in the U.S. we sell only to Bergdorf Goodman and selected department stores. Tom is an amazing perfectionist and he approves everything.”

And who is the customer at whom all this perfection is aimed? “Our clients tend to be people who really seem to enjoy a high quality, a very beautiful product, willing to obviously pay an appropriate price for the product.” That price is upwards of US$100 for a 4-colour eye shadow palette, or around US$1200 for a pair of perfectly cut black gabardine slacks.

“Most importantly there’s one big piece that I think I’ve noticed at this level, and that’s quality of service. The expectation of service is very, very high. If a suit is not perfectly made, we hear back very quickly.”

The customers demanding perfection and high levels of service are not the same as De Sole’s Gucci days. “In the ‘90s remember the strongest part of the market was Japan, not just in Japan bit also by the Japanese travelling abroad,” he remembers. “What has really changed today is the emergence of China – and Asia in general, led by China. Not only have we seen the strength and the growth of the business within China but also the buying power that Chinese have travelling abroad.”

Still, there’s that slowdown in the Chinese economy everyone is worried about. ""I'm actually optimistic,” De Sole says, referring to China and the outlook for luxury in the coming year. “There is a slowdown in China, but from everything I hear and everything I see – we have stores there – things are picking up. I think the economy is recovering in the United States. The consumption of luxury goods in the U.S. in the last couple of years has been quite good. Europe went through a very difficult period and hopefully things will improve. Historically, European luxury stores became propelled to success by a lot of ‘visitors’. In the '90s Japanese visitors, now Chinese, Asian, new countries emerging – a lot of Brazilian customers. I really do believe this is very helpful to the luxury industry.”

Dom and Tom

De Sole’s connection to Tom Ford – the man - goes back a long time, to the early days at Gucci when De Sole gave moral support to the young designer in tumultuous days, propelling him to prominence during the Gucci power struggle - PPR years, 1999-2004.

“We have great respect for each other and we love to work together,” De Sole says of the pair, known in the industry as “Dom and Tom”. He continues, “I think having a good balance of business and creative is very important. I do have a very clear distinction in my mind between business and creativity. You do need to be very creative to do certain things and learn about the business. On the other hand, having a creative force is a gift of nature, which is something very, very special and unique.

“To give you an example, I obviously have a very good sense for the business; I have a very good sense for stores. I also have a very good sense of a collection – whether a collection is good or bad, how successful the collection would be eventually in the stores... But it’s one thing to have that kind of sense, which is good, another to be creative. I can certainly look at a collection, be critical and have a great understanding of what the collection is all about, but then if somebody said ‘OK, you don’t like it, you do it,’ I really wouldn’t know where to start.”

And what’s next for this erstwhile retiree who doesn’t (yet?) play golf? “I really love what I’m doing. It’s an exciting business. I do a lot of travelling and sometimes I feel tired but people tell me that working hard keeps you young, so I take their advice and I’ve no other plan than to just keep working.”"

Why the Louis Vuitton group invested in Charles & Keith - Philstar.com,"Wed, 28 Aug 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBoaWxzdGFyLmNvbS9saWZlc3R5bGUvZmFzaGlvbi1hbmQtYmVhdXR5LzIwMTMvMDgvMjgvMTE0MDgwMS93aHktbG91aXMtdnVpdHRvbi1ncm91cC1pbnZlc3RlZC1jaGFybGVzLWtlaXRo0gF8aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cucGhpbHN0YXIuY29tL2xpZmVzdHlsZS9mYXNoaW9uLWFuZC1iZWF1dHkvMjAxMy8wOC8yOC8xMTQwODAxL3doeS1sb3Vpcy12dWl0dG9uLWdyb3VwLWludmVzdGVkLWNoYXJsZXMta2VpdGgvYW1wLw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Why the Louis Vuitton group invested in Charles & Keith

In the glamorous and cutthroat world of fashion, very few labels are able to maintain themselves, style-wise at least, as both classic and yet bold and trendy. Even fewer can remain timeless and yet be ever-evolving. Itâ€™s a fine line, but it can be done. After all, thatâ€™s what Singaporean fashion brand Charles & Keith have been doing for the past 17 years â€“â€“ wielding a classic but still effortlessly cool approach with everything from peep-toe pumps to chic sunglasses.

So when multinational luxury goods conglomerate LVMH (Louis Vuitton Moet Hennessy) invested in the brand back in 2011, you knew the dynamic, designing duo, brothers Charles and Keith Wong, were doing something more than right. Besides, who would argue with a company thatâ€™s an expert on fashion as well as Champagne, right?

â€œLVMH investing in Charles & Keith is impactful for all partners,â€ says Kristine Lim, AVP for brand marketing of Suyen Corporation, which brought the Charles & Keith label to the Philippines. â€œThis partnership means that a luxury giant who is responsible for major international brands like Louis Vuitton, Givenchy, and Celine saw value and worth in investing in a local and homegrown Singaporean brand.â€

With over 300 stores open worldwide, including Africa and the Middle East, the label has added yet another to its impressive location list with the grand opening of its newest store in Takashimaya SC, Singapore last Aug. 23, having opened its first local store in the Amara Shopping Centre back in â€™96. The opening, which also showcased the new autumn-winter 2013 collection (more on that later, folks), was as impressive as it was star-studded with guests that included both regional and international celebrities and personalities. I even had my own little fan moment when I spotted Korean actor Daniel Henney less than 10 feet away from me.

The physical store reflects the brand in every possible way â€“â€“ sophisticated, chic, and forward. Fashion forward, that is. With its brightly lit interior, sleek layout, and even an LED video wall that displays key looks and styles of the season, the store is as visually delightful as the various items on display.

â€œI am confident that the fashion-conscious will enjoy an unparalleled experience with fast fashion at an accessible shopping landmark,â€ says chief executive officer of the Charles & Keith group, Charles Wong. Yes, that Charles. He sure wasnâ€™t kidding when he mentioned â€œaccessibleâ€ either, with the Takashimaya shopping center literally just around the corner from our hotel and located along the shopperâ€™s paradise that is Orchard Road.

The collection itself, part of the Charles & Keith Signature Label for Autumn 2013, is described as â€œbuilding on edgy looks and theatrical style with architectural volumes and extravagant embellishments.â€ New designs and looks for everything, from footwear (ballerina flats, wedges, and boots), to bags (totes, satchels, and minaudiÃ¨res), and a variety of eyewear, bracelets, and belts are enough to awaken that not-so-hidden accessory lust in many of us.

If youâ€™re a diehard fashionista who constantly wants to keep on top of the latest trends and stand out from the crowd with your sense of style, grab a pair of deep red, pointed pumps with metal toe caps, a black studded handbag, and leather cuff bracelet with mesh details.

If youâ€™re a more laidback gal with a preference for simplicity, minimalism and comfort, slip into some croc embossed leather moccasins, a mid-waist belt in duo colors, and classic square-framed sunglasses. But with the brandâ€™s hundreds of designs and accessories, even the most fashion-savvy will be put into a spin trying to decide which shoulder bag goes with what pair of suede wedge ankle boots. Thatâ€™s where Kelvin Wong, youngest brother of Charles and Keith and spokesperson for the brand, reassures us, â€œWe try to make our accessories complement all the shoes to solve the customerâ€™s problems of matching them together.â€

Asking him what he finds to be the biggest challenge when coming up with or selecting new designs, he says, â€œLooking for the next big thing to focus on.â€

At the packed fashion show that followed the event, guests were eager to see complete looks that will be musts for the upcoming season and werenâ€™t disappointed as models circled the runway in monochrome threads while, of course, wearing key pieces by Charles & Keith.

The brand, which has been in the Philippines since 2001 and the franchise was later acquired by Suyen Corporation in 2006, has become a must-have in many a Filipina womanâ€™s closet for years. Asked about the wide appeal of the brand both globally and in the country, Kristine says, â€œAffordability and the ability to balance the trends and the classics are two reasons why Charles & Keith is well-loved by many. Their designs donâ€™t get lost in a single trend, but instead fuse to turn a noteworthy trend into a classic silhouette. The market responds well to that because they get to be stylish but the fashion is still wearable.â€ Concerning the brandâ€™s future in the country, Kristine is rightfully positive in adding, â€œAs one of the first footwear and accessories brands that penetrated the Philippine market, Charles & Keith Philippines already has a loyal following. As Filipinos are appreciating fashion and personal style more, Charles & Keith will always be here to provide affordable fashion for every Filipina in the country. Currently, we have 32 stores all over Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao, and weâ€™ll be opening SM Lanang, our second store in Davao, within the year.â€

Itâ€™s safe to say that a brand like Charles & Keith isnâ€™t just about looks and trends, but also making fashion accessible and appealing to a wide market at the same time.

As editor-in-chief for American Vogue Anna Wintour once said, â€œ[The democratization of luxury] means more people are going to get better fashion. And the more people who can have fashion, the better.â€

Introducing: Tigran Avetisyan - Dazed,"Tue, 20 Aug 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhemVkZGlnaXRhbC5jb20vZmFzaGlvbi9hcnRpY2xlLzE2OTIyLzEvaW50cm9kdWNpbmctdGlncmFuLWF2ZXRpc3lhbtIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"It takes a lot to make the fashion world sit up and take notice. Russian menswear designer Tigran Avetisyan has managed to do just that, releasing his graduate collection under the sponsorship of LVMH to critical acclaim. Now based in Moscow after graduating from CSM, Avetisyan’s designs draw on the hardship of student life: the penury and the lack of hope for the future. Workman style jackets are cut from fabrics usually hidden or thrown away, like toile and calico, and disparaging slogans such as ‘No Jobs’ and ‘Nothing Changes’ are scrawled across the garments in chalk. Avetisyan’s SS14 collection is a spin-off from his debut show, the issues he drew upon for inspiration, still as relevant as ever.

Dazed Digital: Where do the slogans you use in your designs come from?

Tigran Avetisyan: The messages that I ""chalk” onto garments come from various places. I have a story about each one. Most of them were overheard from my friends and classmates – ‘No jobs, too much pressure’, others come from music I listen to ‘wish you weren't here’ is a slightly reworded title of Pink Floyd's album and often it's just cliché phrases ‘stop dreaming, nothing changes’ that many people have heard or can resonate with – sometimes a word could weight more than the heaviest book.

DD: You studied at CSM – how did living in London influence your work?

Tigran Avetisyan: Nowhere else in the world you are exposed to such incredible amount of creativity. The city is a melting pot of ideas, a place where so many cultures meet. Studying with people from all over the world had an immense impact on my own vision.

Nevertheless I think that the scandal is completely blown out of proportion. My numerous gay friends, who don’t follow the Western media, were not even aware of the hysteria surrounding the issue until recently.

DD: Your graduate collection was sponsored by LVMH, how did that come about?

Tigran Avetisyan: My tutor at CSM had contacted me just few months before I was due to commence my final year. At that time I was interning for Acne in Sweden. He selected me to represent menswear pathway and compete for the bursary amongst students from other pathways. I ended up having a tête-à-tête interview with the HR manager of LVMH and Imran of Business of Fashion. A week later they told me I had been granted the scholarship.

Although the money I had won covered my tuition fees and production of graduation collection, the most important thing that I gained was confidence that I lacked then. Being supported by the world’s biggest luxury group removed the fear that otherwise most certainly would’ve prevented me from exploring my ideas to the fullest.

DD: Why did you choose Moscow as your studio base?

Tigran Avetisyan: I enjoyed my 5 year stay in the UK immensely. However as with most things, in order to get you also have to give something back. I was drained. London is fit for ambitious people, my ambitions have very little to do with my career.

DD: You describe ‘stagnancy as the new form of protest’, can you elaborate?

Tigran Avetisyan: There is a wonderful film by Ingmar Bergman called ‘Persona’ where the character played by Liv Ullmann in the face of horror and lies she experiences on day-to-day basis decides to refrain from speaking. In the age when you’re just a tweet away from sharing your point of view with millions of people the importance of self-reflection should not be undermined. Perhaps now is the time to be mute and rethink our views.

Putting pressure on Russian politicians just escalates the tension between governments. I am worried that this will create further problems.

DD: What drew you to exploring rebellion within fashion?

Tigran Avetisyan: I wasn’t always interested in fashion. I arrived to London thinking I’d pursue product design studies. And I did just that for two years. However I grew weary with the course realising that no one was really interested in my work or work of my peers. Fashion on the other hand seems to attract people by default, which makes it a perfect platform for expressing one’s views. Besides, so many things are intuitively wrong about it. The industry that prides itself with being always on trend and time defining hasn’t changed for decades. It just becomes faster and faster. But then the speed is of no importance if the chosen direction is wrong.

DD: You define your personal style as ‘unexpressionism’ – defined by the people and events around you – how has your work been influenced by the current political situation in Russia?

Tigran Avetisyan: Unfortunately there is no shortage of issues I could talk about within fashion. Political hypocrisy in Russia has not been on my radar as of yet. But I never say never. Maybe my upcoming collection will touch just upon that.

DD: What’s the current feeling on the ground surrounding the recent anti-gay laws?

Tigran Avetisyan: I detest any form of violence based on race, religious beliefs or sexual preference. Regrettably the gay community in Russia historically has always been deprived of declaring their sexual preference publicly. Nevertheless I think that the scandal is completely blown out of proportion. My numerous gay friends, who don’t follow the Western media, were not even aware of the hysteria surrounding the issue until recently. It’s not like suddenly the heterosexual majority was granted a licence to kill anyone who isn’t straight. Yes, violence does occur occasionally and it is horrendous. But the fact is the conditions haven’t changed at all here. What I despise almost as much now is the situation where athlete’s achievements are overshadowed by the colour of their nail polish or when recently they were trying to boycott Stolichnaya when in fact it is not even a Russian brand. I am sick of Facebook slacktivism that consists solely of sharing links, signing petitions, and changing profile pictures to rainbow flags. If people want to rebel they should give up the comfort of their rooms. Rebellion without sacrifice is not possible.
