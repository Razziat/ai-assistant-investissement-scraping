LVMH Legal Battle With Tiffany's Ends With Discounted Sale - Jing Daily,"Sat, 31 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vamluZ2RhaWx5LmNvbS9wb3N0cy9sdm1oLXRpZmZhbnlzLXNhbGUtbG91aXMtdnVpdHRvbi1jYXJ0aWVy0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"What happened

: According to The Wall Street Journal , the legal battle between LVMH and Tiffany & Co. has finally ended. The revised deal comes with a $430 million discount off of the original $16.2 billion offer. LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE is now paying $131.30 per share for Tiffany’s stock, compared to its original offer of $135 per share.

: The buyout is hardly surprising if we consider the strategic importance of Tiffany. Having the American jeweler under its belt, the French conglomerate can now compete with its primary challenger in the luxury jewelry market, Richemont.

While LVMH leads in other luxury segments (including handbags, cosmetics, and apparel), the French conglomerate is not the global leader in fine jewelry and is losing market share to its Swiss competitor, which owns Cartier, IWC Schaffhausen, Montblanc, Vacheron Constantin, and Van Cleef & Arpels.

According to Bain & Co. , the jewelry segment was one of the best-performing in luxury in 2018. Plus, Tiffany is performing well with the mid-level market and younger, first-time luxury buyers, who are looking for more affordable options than investment pieces from Cartier or Bvlgari. “From Tiffany's perspective, we see the access to capital, global and high luxury expertise as likely to boost Tiffany's transition considerably,” said Atlantic Equities analyst Daniela Nedialkova.

At the same time, LVMH executives see the critical importance of Tiffany's supply chain, which is vertically integrated — meaning that it allows the American jeweler to control every part of the process, from production to sales. This control is especially important in the jewelry industry, where it gets increasingly difficult to trace the journey and provenance of gold, precious metals, and diamonds. In an industry that was associated with “blood diamonds,” Tiffany’' reputation and commitment to the sustainable supply chain stand out.

As younger luxury shoppers have become more aware of social and environmental issues, they have begun pursuing sustainable luxury, and heritage brands have grasped the value of building a sustainable supply chain. And LVMH knew this aspect was a strong suit of Tiffany & Co.

Structuring M&A Agreements – Five Lessons from the Tiffany & Co. V. LVMH Affair - JD Supra,"Thu, 08 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmpkc3VwcmEuY29tL2xlZ2FsbmV3cy9zdHJ1Y3R1cmluZy1tLWEtYWdyZWVtZW50cy1maXZlLWxlc3NvbnMtMTA4MzYv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"It was a whirlwind affair. The Manhattan socialite and the sophisticated Parisian. Tiffany & Co. (NYSE: “TIF”) and LVMH, Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE (OTC: “LVMUY”), announced their engagement, via joint press release, on November 25, 2019 and set a date in 2020. The proposed combination valued Tiffany’s stock at $135 per share in an all-cash deal, yielding an implied aggregate transaction value of approximately $16.2 billion. The holidays were magical, and all seemed well with the world.

But 2020 arrived and brought with it unforeseen developments around the globe. Tiffany’s Madison Avenue neighbor, Brooks Brothers, filed for bankruptcy on July 8, 2020 and Tiffany & Co. itself experienced significant declines in its business, with global sales down 45% for the fiscal quarter ended April 30 and down 29% for the quarter ended July 31. Tiffany & Co. lost over $32 million during the first six months of its fiscal year. LVMH stated publicly that Tiffany’s business had been “devastated” by the coronavirus. Things soured quickly, and the erstwhile happy couple ended up in Delaware Chancery Court. As Michael Douglas’ famous character, Gordon Gekko, quipped in Oliver Stone’s 1987 film, Wall Street, “Exit visas are imminent.”

Tiffany filed first, on September 9th, with a complaint seeking specific performance of the deal and alleging that LVMH was dragging its feet in pursuing required regulatory approvals, enlisting the help of the French government to delay closing, and misinterpreting the material adverse effect (MAE) clause in the acquisition agreement. In short, it was Tiffany’s position that LVMH’s actions amounted to a “blatant attempt to evade its contractual obligation to pay the agreed-upon price.” In addition to naming LVMH as defendant, Tiffany’s complaint also named as additional defendants the special purpose acquisition subsidiaries formed for the transaction, Breakfast Acquisition Corp. and Breakfast Holdings Acquisition Corp. (See what they did there?).

LVMH’s recriminations were aired in its opposition to Tiffany's motion for expedited proceedings filed in Chancery Court on September 16, 2020 and in a countersuit filed with the court on September 28, 2020, in which LVMH alleged that Tiffany’s “spurious arguments” were “completely unfounded” and that “Tiffany's mismanagement of its business constitutes a breach of its obligation to operate in the ordinary course.” Just for good measure, it also alleged that Tiffany & Co. had been “burning cash.”

The case is pending, but there are key terms from this tale that can be applied now. Below is a list of five provisions that are almost always negotiated in a definitive agreement for an acquisition transaction, any of which may end up determining the outcome of the Tiffany v. LVMH case.

Material Adverse Effect (MAE) Provisions. The MAE clause could end up being the centerpiece of this case. While MAE provisions are very common in definitive agreements for M&A transactions, they must be finely tuned. During what period must an MAE occur? Are there quantitative thresholds or tests written into the definition? Does the MAE clause trigger a right to terminate or merely a potential price adjustment? Does it apply to the buyer’s business too, or just that of the seller? What if the seller can cure the issue or things otherwise start to improve on their own? Does the agreement’s definition of MAE specifically reference (or exclude) things like pandemics? The Tiffany agreement did not explicitly reference pandemics (then again, most of us were not quite as focused on global pandemics in late 2019 as we are now). For more on this topic, please see this recent Wyrick Robbins client note on MAE clauses and the L Brands / Sycamore Partners transaction.

Outside Date. Most M&A agreements include an outside date, also sometimes referred to as a “drop dead date” (which one imagines might be the preferred name in the Tiffany case). Typically, these provisions permit either party to terminate the agreement unilaterally without “cause” or reliance on any MAE standard if the transaction has not closed by a specified date. But, how far out that date is set and whether there are any provisions for its extension (automatic or otherwise) can become crucial in a transaction like the LVMH / Tiffany deal, where a party with a fight on its hands to prove the existence of a MAE, may just decide to wait out the drop dead date. But can it do so in good faith, and are the facts and circumstances leading to the delay in closing really beyond the control of the party that now wants to kill the deal? Thoughtful consideration of the outside date provisions in a definitive agreement cannot be overlooked, and a date that seems like it is well into the future may be here sooner than imagined. The outside date in the Tiffany case is November 24, 2020, which was extended from the original outside date of August 24, 2020. The validity of the extension is contested, and so time is of the essence. Tiffany’s motion for expedited proceedings may ultimately decide the case.

Required Approvals. Larger transactions and those in regulated industries often require prior approval or non-objection from government regulators, and definitive agreements typically require the receipt of all such approvals as a condition to close. There are 10 such governmental approvals required in order to close the Tiffany & Co. transaction. But what are the obligations of the parties to pursue these approvals? Does the definitive agreement require the filing of regulatory applications by a specified deadline or otherwise impose a “best efforts” or “commercially reasonable” standard for pursuing regulatory approvals? Is the seller required to cooperate in the preparation of those applications? Does the seller have a right to approve applications prior to filing, and if so, is there a “reasonable satisfaction” or other standard written into that language or is approval in the seller’s sole discretion? Of course, all of the same questions may also apply with regard to shareholder approvals, meetings of shareholders and proxy solicitation materials.

LVMH agreed to use its “reasonable best efforts to obtain all regulatory clearances as transparently and promptly as practicable.” How transparent were LVMH’s actions in the instant case, and could a party use its best efforts to obtain regulatory approvals while at the same time encouraging some governmental agency or other third party to intervene? Could any failure on the part of LVMH to promptly file for EU antitrust approval (as has been alleged by Tiffany & Co. and unequivocally denied by LVMH) present complications under the “reasonable best efforts” standard?

Conditions to Close. The definitive agreement in the LVMH / Tiffany deal includes a number of required conditions that must be satisfied in order for the transaction to close, including one that requires:

No Governmental Entity shall have enacted, issued, promulgated, enforced or entered any Law (whether temporary, preliminary or permanent) or temporary restraining order, preliminary or permanent injunction or other Order, in each case, that is in effect and enjoins, prevents or otherwise prohibits, materially restrains or materially impairs or makes unlawful consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

There is obviously a lot to argue about here, and it’s compounded in the Tiffany v. LVMH case by Tiffany’s allegation that LVMH approached the French government in a deliberate effort to obtain just such an edict. Does the definitive agreement require the parties to try to resolve government intervention of this nature or otherwise continue to work in good faith to close the transaction? Does the government’s stance on the matter come within the scope of the specific language, i.e., is it a “Law” or an “Order” that “materially impairs” the transaction? Counsel may spend months arguing the merits of differing interpretations of a provision that was drafted in a matter of hours. Add to that, the additional complication that communications from the French government are, of course, written in French, and translations are themselves subject to interpretation.

Forum Selection and Choice of Law Provisions. The Tiffany agreement provides that the definitive agreement and the transactions it contemplates will be governed by Delaware law and that any action arising out of or otherwise relating to the definitive agreement must be adjudicated in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (assuming it has subject matter jurisdiction). In this case, where the clock is ticking on the “outside date,” imagine the likely effect of a delay for procedural arguments over the proper venue and governing law for the case. Anything less than an airtight forum selection clause and choice of law provision in a case like Tiffany v. LVMH where the timeline is extremely compressed could end up deciding the outcome of the transaction.

In fact, the wording of any of these provisions in the definitive agreement could have a direct bearing on the outcome of the multi-billion dollar Tiffany v. LVMH case. While the resolution of that dispute may not be known for some time, these five lessons can be applied immediately when negotiating and drafting definitive agreements for M&A transactions.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9950770735740662}",neutral,0.9950770735740662,0
LVMH snags $400 million discount on Tiffany deal after legal spat - CNN,"Thu, 29 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vMjAyMC8xMC8yOS9pbnZlc3RpbmcvdGlmZmFueS1sdm1oLWRlYWwtaW50bC1obmsvaW5kZXguaHRtbNIBR2h0dHBzOi8vYW1wLmNubi5jb20vY25uLzIwMjAvMTAvMjkvaW52ZXN0aW5nL3RpZmZhbnktbHZtaC1kZWFsLWludGwtaG5r?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Hong Kong CNN Business —

Tiffany (TIF) and LVMH (LVMHF) are getting back together.

The New York jeweler has agreed to accept a lower purchase price from the French conglomerate, ending a dramatic spat that had threatened to derail the $16 billion takeover.

The companies said in a joint statement on Thursday that they have modified the terms of last year’s merger agreement, lowering the price per share that LVMH will pay from $135 to $131.50. The move now values Tiffany at $15.8 billion, $400 million less than the $16.2 billion originally agreed upon. It also ends a legal battle over the deal.

LVMH announced in September that it would abandon its planned acquisition of Tiffany, which was expected to be the biggest luxury goods deal in history. LVMH said that a trade fight between Brussels and Washington had forced it to scrap the agreement, but some analysts believed that the move was a bid to renegotiate the sale.

Tiffany argued that the decision had no legal grounds. It sued LVMH in a Delaware court, saying that the French group had breached its obligations and should go ahead with the merger.

Weeks later, LVMH countersued, arguing that the coronavirus pandemic had seriously damaged the US jeweler’s business and carried “devastating and lasting” effects.

The deal is expected to help LVMH better compete with rival Swiss jewelry seller Richemont by cementing its position in watches and jewelry. Until now, that had been LVMH’s “weakest division” by some metrics, according to Luca Solca, a senior research analyst of luxury goods at Bernstein. It also would help the company boost its presence in the United States.

Bernard Arnault, LVMH’s billionaire CEO, characterized the new agreement as “balanced,” and said it “allows LVMH to work on the Tiffany acquisition with confidence.”

“We are as convinced as ever of the formidable potential of the Tiffany brand and believe that LVMH is the right home for Tiffany and its employees,” he added.

The deal, which must be approved by Tiffany shareholders, is expected to close early next year.

“We are very pleased to have reached an agreement with LVMH at an attractive price and to now be able to proceed with the merger,” said Roger Farah, the chairman of Tiffany, in the statement Thursday. “The board concluded it was in the best interests of all of our stakeholders to achieve certainty of closing.”

Solca said the news sends a “very good message for the sector — it reassures [people of] the confidence the big groups have on the business.”

“The LVMH and Tiffany saga seems to have finally come to an end,” he added.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.7362453937530518}",neutral,0.7362453937530518,0

The two companies originally announced their synergistic engagement last November only to engage in months of public mudslinging after the pandemic hit the luxury market and LVMH’s commitment turned wobbly. But on Thursday they said they had agreed to new terms.

LVMH will acquire Tiffany for $131.50 a share, $3.50 less than the original price but $1.50 more than Tiffany’s reported bottom line. That will save Bernard Arnault, the chairman of LVMH, and his shareholders the relatively low amount of $420 million off the original $16.2 billion price, and it will keep Tiffany from being left to fend for itself in an uncertain luxury environment.

It has been a drama-filled relationship, however, beginning in September when LVMH went public with the news that the French government — the government! — had asked it to wait on closing the deal.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9996881484985352}",neutral,0.9996881484985352,0
Ruinart Second Skin Case: innovation for sustainability - LVMH,"Tue, 13 Oct 2020 19:57:42 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmx2bWguY29tL25ld3MtZm9sZGVycy9ydWluYXJ0LXNlY29uZC1za2luLWNhc2UtaW5ub3ZhdGlvbi1mb3Itc3VzdGFpbmFiaWxpdHkv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The case is instantly fascinating, with a shape unlike any box currently used by the wines and spirits market. Ruinart’s new packaging is almost other-worldly. As its name – Second Skin – signifies, it perfectly replicates the signature shape of Ruinart bottles, heightening the elegance of the curves as it hugs them. The ethereal lightness of the case, thanks to a construction in 100% cellulose fibers, contrasts with the current imposing norm in the world of champagne. The surface of the second skin evokes the walls of the Crayères de Reims, the ancient chalk quarries and natural wine cellars where Maison Ruinart champagnes age, giving the case a silky, organic feel. The novel coffret opens and closes thanks to a snap fastener to reveal the bottle nestled in its second skin.

In addition to its elegant look, the new packaging is extraordinarily eco-friendly. Eco-designed from start to finish, it is nine times lighter than the previous generation of Ruinart gift boxes (just 40 grams, compared with 360 grams previously). The carbon footprint has been reduced by 60%, and 100% of the paper comes from sustainably managed European forests. What’s more, 91% of the water used is clean enough to be released back into nature after filtering. None of these innovations of course have any effect whatsoever on the unique taste of Ruinart champagnes. Even though it is ultra-thin, the second skin is totally resistant to humidity and service uses. It protects the wines from light as well, which is essential to optimal storage, especially for the clear glass Ruinart Blanc de Blancs bottle.

Maison Ruinart President Frédéric Dufour says the new packaging marks a decisive stage in the Champagne house’s holistic environmental approach:","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999916553497314}",neutral,0.9999916553497314,0
"Tiffany, LVMH agree to end bitter legal battle in new merger deal - New York Post","Thu, 29 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vbnlwb3N0LmNvbS8yMDIwLzEwLzI5L3RpZmZhbnktbHZtaC1hZ3JlZS10by1lbmQtYml0dGVyLWxlZ2FsLWJhdHRsZS13aXRoLW5ldy1kZWFsL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Tiffany & Co. and LVMH are heading back to the altar.

The ritzy retailers said they will end their bitter legal battle as they announced a revised merger deal announced Thursday — less than two months after LVMH moved to cancel the blockbuster wedding.

The companies said they’ve agreed to settle their dueling lawsuits in Delaware Chancery Court that were filed after the Louis Vuitton owner sought to scrap the tie-up last month. They also confirmed that LVMH will now pay $131.50 a share for the storied New York jeweler instead of the original $135 price, as reports indicated Wednesday.

“We are as convinced as ever of the formidable potential of the Tiffany brand and believe that LVMH is the right home for Tiffany and its employees during this exciting next chapter,” Bernard Arnault, the French luxury conglomerate’s billionaire CEO, said in a statement.

The revised deal — now worth about $15.9 billion based on Tiffany’s number of outstanding shares — is expected to close early next year if the blue-box jeweler’s shareholders approve it. The deal has already received regulatory clearance, and both companies’ boards have approved the terms, according to a news release.

The agreement marked an end to a dramatic saga that began when LVMH said it was walking away from the deal in early September, claiming the French government had told it not to proceed in response to the US’s threat to impose tariffs on French goods.

Tiffany sued to keep the deal intact, accusing LVMH of dragging its feet on seeking approval for the acquisition, while Paris-based luxury titan shot back that Tiffany’s business prospects had turned “dismal” due to the coronavirus crisis.

The two companies’ Delaware court battle was slated to go to trial in January had they not agreed to drop the dispute.

“We are very pleased to have reached an agreement with LVMH at an attractive price and to now be able to proceed with the merger,” Roger Farah, chairman of Tiffany’s board, said in a statement. “The board concluded it was in the best interests of all of our stakeholders to achieve certainty of closing.”

Tiffany shares were up 0.6 percent at $130.70 in premarket trading Thursday as of 7:31 a.m., while LVMH’s Paris-listed shares were recently up 0.1 percent at 402.80 euros ($471.73).","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9996776580810547}",neutral,0.9996776580810547,0

The total cost of the original agreement was about US$16 billion. Bloomberg News and other media reported earlier that the two were close to reaching an agreement on a new deal.

Tiffany & Co.’s board have approved an agreement to revive its sale to LVMH, according to people familiar with the matter, giving the French luxury conglomerate a US$425 million discount from the original price.

Bloomberg reported that Tiffany sought around US$132 per share as a compromise price, citing people familiar with the matter. The jeweller also likely wanted a guarantee that LVMH wouldn’t back out of any revised deal, after the Louis Vuitton owner said in September it could not complete the acquisition because of a French government request.

Tiffany shares erased losses on October 28, rising 0.8 per cent to US$129.95 in New York. Representatives for the jeweller and LVMH declined to comment the following day.

The compromise ends a year-long saga involving a bitter war of words, French government intervention and lawsuits in the US. By striking a new deal, the companies can avoid a courtroom battle that was set for January 2021 in Delaware.

However, the original deal’s closing date of November 24 would not be met, according to a person familiar with the matter.

Adding Tiffany will give LVMH’s billionaire chairman Bernard Arnault a major boost in the global jewellery market, allowing the billionaire to challenge Cartier owner Richemont for supremacy as the luxury industry begins to recover from a turbulent 2020. At LVMH, Tiffany would join a portfolio of high-end brands that include Dior, Givenchy and Bulgari.

The relationship between Tiffany and LVMH started affably last year following a short courtship, with the jeweller hosting Arnault and his top brass at its New York flagship store. France’s wealthiest man spoke of Tiffany as an American icon and expressed his “intense respect and admiration” for the business.

The smiles faded soon after the coronavirus pandemic sparked worldwide economic turmoil and roiled the global luxury market. LVMH got a helping hand from the French government when its foreign minister sent a letter asking the company to delay the deal amid a trade dispute with the US.

That sparked a Tiffany lawsuit, followed by an LVMH countersuit in which it accused the jeweller’s executives of mismanaging the business during the pandemic.

Tiffany persuaded a judge to fast-track its suit and the two sides reopened talks as the original closing date approached.

Luxury goods giant LVMH has officially landed its gem.

The Paris-based conglomerate, which has a portfolio including Louis Vuitton, Christian Dior, Bulgari and Hennessy, will acquire New York's famed jeweler Tiffany for $15.8 billion, the companies said.

The sale price is slightly lower than the $16.2 billion the two companies announced in November 2019. LVMH will now pay $131.50 per share for Tiffany's stock, down from $135 per share.

LVMH appeared to walk away from the acquisition last month after it said the French government had pushed for a delay to assess the threat of proposed U.S. tariffs.

Rumors that both were still interested in making the deal happen began to surface in recent days.

The companies have come to an agreement on new deal terms calling for LVMH to pay $131.50 a share for the iconic U.S. jewelry maker, according to people familiar with the matter. That’s down from an original price of $135 a share, equating to savings of roughly $430 million for LVMH. It would allow the two sides to avoid what would have been a costly and time-consuming trial set to start in January.

Tiffany’s board signed off on the revised terms at a meeting late Wednesday, one of the people said. Under the new framework, litigation over the deal would be resolved, paving the way for a new shareholder vote and a closing of the transaction possibly by January.

Tiffany agreed to sell itself to the European consumer conglomerate late last year in a roughly $16.2 billion deal. LVMH, whose roughly 75 brands include Louis Vuitton and Bulgari, saw an opportunity to revamp the jeweler, which had struggled with weak demand. It would also strengthen LVMH in China, where demand for luxury goods has been steadily increasing as incomes rise, and expand its presence in the U.S.

LVMH, with a market value of roughly $200 billion, is one of Europe’s most valuable companies and many times the size of Tiffany. It has a long history of deal making, including a $13 billion move in 2017 to bring all of French fashion house Dior under the ownership of LVMH.

TIFFANY AND LVMH DISCUSS PRICE CUT TO SETTLE DEAL DISPUTE

But the Tiffany acquisition represented the biggest bet yet by LVMH under Bernard Arnault, the French billionaire who has been its chief executive and controlling shareholder for three decades. The deal’s merits changed when the pandemic spread around the world in early 2020, forcing Tiffany and other retailers to close stores and severely denting sales.

The pandemic has especially hurt demand for luxury brands, given that they tend to be more reliant than other consumer goods on both in-store sales and steady streams of tourists. Consultants at Bain have forecast a sales decline of 20% to 35% across the global luxury-goods industry in 2020.

LVMH said in September it was backing out of the deal, using the novel justification of trade disputes between France and the Trump administration. It said it had received a letter from the French foreign ministry asking it to delay the acquisition. Many saw the move as a bid to lower the price. Tiffany Chairman Roger Farah said at the time there was no basis under French law to order a company to breach a valid and binding agreement and a French diplomatic official also said such a letter wouldn’t be binding.

HOW CORONAVIRUS CHANGED THE RETAIL LANDSCAPE

Tiffany sued LVMH in Delaware Chancery Court to enforce the agreement or obtain damages. That prompted LVMH to countersue, arguing the U.S. jeweler’s business had been so deeply damaged during the pandemic that their takeover agreement was no longer valid. Some legal experts have said LVMH faced long odds of prevailing.

Whether in the end it turns out to have been a good move for LVMH to challenge the deal—for a $400 million-plus discount—remains to be seen, given that the next time it tries to make an acquisition the target could hesitate, worried it too could risk being left at the altar.

Meanwhile, Tiffany shareholders have continued to receive a 58-cent-per-share quarterly dividend and are to get another one. LVMH had criticized the company’s decision not to cut its dividend despite losing money during the coronavirus crisis.

The tie-up is the highest-profile deal to sour as a result of the pandemic, though far from the only one, especially among companies in the hard-hit retail sector. Private-equity firm Sycamore Partners sued Victoria’s Secret parent L Brands Inc. in April, saying that the retailer had violated the terms of their merger agreement by closing stores, furloughing workers and skipping rent payments. L Brands countersued, and the two sides eventually agreed to scrap the deal.

Mall landlord Simon Property Group Inc. sued to terminate a $3.6 billion deal to buy high-end mall developer Taubman Centers Inc. Taubman countersued and Simon later amended its complaint to argue that Taubman since breached the merger agreement by renegotiating its credit facilities. The companies are set to go to trial in Oakland County Superior Court in Michigan next month.

LVMH Says Rihanna's Fenty Clothing Line Is a 'Work in Progress' - WWD,"Thu, 15 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3dkLmNvbS9mYXNoaW9uLW5ld3MvZmFzaGlvbi1mZWF0dXJlcy9sdm1oLXNheXMtcmloYW5uYXMtZmVudHktY2xvdGhpbmctbGluZS1pcy13b3JrLWluLXByb2dyZXNzLTEyMzQ2MzYzOTkv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS — Like her other beauty ventures, Rihanna’s new skin-care line is off to a flying start. But her fashion venture with LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, launched with great fanfare last year, is still a “work-in-progress,” the luxury conglomerate admitted on Thursday.

Bernard Arnault, chairman and chief executive officer of LVMH, has long professed his admiration for the singer, noting that her Fenty Beauty color cosmetics racked up sales north of $100 million within weeks of their launch via a partnership between Rihanna and LVMH-controlled Kendo.

He has been noticeably silent on the Fenty clothing line, leading to speculation that the direct-to-consumer collection is underperforming. The label recently recruited Bastien Renard, who worked for 19 years at Nike in Europe and in the U.S., as managing director.

Speaking to analysts after LVMH published third-quarter sales, chief financial officer Jean-Jacques Guiony said Rihanna’s luxury maison was still finding its footing.

“On Fenty fashion, we are obviously still in a launching phase and we have to figure out exactly what is the right offer. It’s not something that is easy. We were starting entirely from scratch,” he said.

“Obviously, we have the great help from Rihanna on this, but I would say it’s still a work in progress when it comes to really defining what the offer will be. We have successes, we have things that have worked less well, so we have to sort in between the two and really decide what should be the core strengths of the offer in the years to come,” he added.

Sources suggested Renard, a dynamic and agile executive adroit at all things digital and cutting-edge, could tweak the positioning of the brand, celebrated with pop-up events in such marquee stores as Bergdorf Goodman and Galeries Lafayette Champs-Élysées.

Robyn Rihanna Fenty holds the titles of founder, chief executive officer and artistic director of Fenty.

Her fashions, sold principally online at Fenty.com via see-now-buy-now drops, have skewed more to the dressy and designer end of the spectrum. The latest fashion volley is focused on denim, including oversize jackets and shirts, plus waist-cinched dresses.

WWD broke the news in January 2019 that Rihanna would enter the fashion arena with her own brand following a stint as Puma’s creative director.

Announced officially in May last year, the Fenty house is “centered on Rihanna, developed by her and takes shape with her vision in terms of rtw, shoes and accessories, including commerciality and communication of the brand,” LVMH and the music superstar said at the time.

It marked the first time LVMH — whose forte is modernizing legacy brands such as Dior, Louis Vuitton, Givenchy and Bulgari — has launched a fashion brand from scratch since it set up a couture house for Christian Lacroix in 1987.

LVMH agrees $15.8bn takeover of Tiffany - The Guardian,"Thu, 29 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy8yMDIwL29jdC8yOS9sdm1oLWFncmVlcy0xNThibi10YWtlb3Zlci1vZi10aWZmYW550gFWaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAudGhlZ3VhcmRpYW4uY29tL2J1c2luZXNzLzIwMjAvb2N0LzI5L2x2bWgtYWdyZWVzLTE1OGJuLXRha2VvdmVyLW9mLXRpZmZhbnk?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"France’s LVMH will pay slightly less to buy the US jeweller Tiffany & Co after the two firms agreed to end a bitter dispute triggered by the Covid-19 pandemic and salvage the luxury sector’s biggest-ever deal.

The new takeover price was set at $131.5 (£101.6) a share, down from $135 in the original deal, the companies said on Thursday, bringing the total price tag to about $15.8bn.

The price represents an overall discount of $425m for LVMH, which is led by the billionaire Bernard Arnault, who is betting that the French group can restore Tiffany’s fortunes by investing in stores and new collections.

“We are as convinced as ever of the formidable potential of the Tiffany brand and believe that LVMH is the right home for Tiffany and its employees during this exciting next chapter,” he said.

Other key terms of the deal, which was initially agreed in November, remain unchanged, the companies added.



“Tiffany and LVMH have also agreed to settle their pending litigation in the Delaware chancery court,” the companies said in a statement.



The new deal ends an acrimonious and public war of words between two of the luxury sector’s best-known groups.

The initial deal ran into trouble last month when LVMH, which owns Louis Vuitton, said it could no longer complete the transaction by the deadline of 24 November. It cited a French political intervention asking it to delay the acquisition until 6 January owing to a threat of new US tariffs on French products. It also criticised the jeweller’s “dismal” performance during the coronavirus crisis.

Tiffany in return sued LVMH in a Delaware court, seeking to force the French group to honour the original deal. The case had been scheduled to be heard in early January.



“We are very pleased to have reached an agreement with LVMH at an attractive price and to now be able to proceed with the merger,” said Tiffany’s chairman, Roger Farah. “The board concluded it was in the best interests of all of our stakeholders to achieve certainty of closing.”

Some analysts have questioned why LVMH had prompted such a bitter dispute for what ended up being a relatively modest price cut, though ending the spat allows the French group to save on potentially costly legal fees.

The deal is designed to bolster LVMH’s smallest business, the jewellery and watch division that is home to Bulgari and Tag Heuer, and help it expand in one of the fastest-growing areas while also strengthening its US presence.

LVMH Warms to E-Commerce as Prospects Brighten - Yahoo Finance,"Thu, 15 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9sdm1oLXdhcm1zLWUtY29tbWVyY2UtcHJvc3BlY3RzLTIxMTAzNDQ5NS5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS — Long averse to selling its luxury products online, LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton is projecting a bigger role for its e-commerce platforms, including multibrand site 24S, as the coronavirus pandemic reshuffles the landscape of brick-and-mortar retail.

The luxury conglomerate said its sales trends improved significantly in the third quarter, driven by its key fashion and leather goods division, amid signs of a global upturn in activity, particularly in the U.S. and Asia.

More from WWD

Although LVMH did not disclose the increase in online sales, the company said e-commerce had compensated for prolonged store closures through spring and summer.

“We’ve seen a big surge in the share of the business we do with online, I would say across the board,” chief financial officer Jean-Jacques Guiony told analysts on a conference call on Thursday.

“What this complicated period has shown us is that there is a validity in the vertical e-commerce system for all the brands,” he added. “Online will continue to develop, [but] certainly not at the speed we’ve seen this year, which was definitely a function of stores being closed.”

LVMH reported that organic revenues fell by 7 percent in the three months ended Sept. 30, beating market expectations and marking a dramatic improvement from the second quarter, when comparable sales plummeted 38 percent as the pandemic shut down stores and factories worldwide and grounded travelers.

The Bloomberg consensus estimate was for a 12 percent drop in the third quarter, with fashion and leather goods seen down 0.9 percent.

Instead, the division recorded a 12 percent jump during the period, fueled by its star brands Louis Vuitton and Dior, which both staged physical shows during Paris Fashion Week.

“Some businesses, particularly Celine, Loewe and Fendi, had a big improvement in Q3 so we are very pleased. Not all of them did as well, but all in all, we see a gradual improvement in all our businesses, and that’s quite encouraging,” said Guiony.

Story continues

While he declined to comment on LVMH’s acrimonious legal dispute with U.S. jeweler Tiffany & Co. over their soured $16.2 billion merger deal, he appeared to strike a more conciliatory tone when asked what would be the group’s strategy in the event that a Delaware court rules that it has to go through with the transaction.

“We still believe Tiffany’s a great brand, that the stock market was not necessarily the best home for Tiffany with the short-term view on quarterly earnings that was preventing Tiffany a little bit from developing a sound marketing strategy,” he said.

“This is what we would implement, but I will not make further comments. All these comments we made in due course when we announced the transaction. Nothing has changed,” he said.

LVMH added that it expects to receive the European Commission’s regulatory approval for the deal by the end of October.

As the COVID-19 outbreak reconfigures the geography of luxury, the group reported that overall sales in Asia grew 13 percent in organic terms in the third quarter, increasing the region’s share of global revenues at LVMH to 34 percent from 31 percent at the same time last year.

Meanwhile, revenues in Europe declined by 24 percent as strong domestic sales failed to compensate for the absence of tourists, leaving the region with a 23 percent share of overall revenues, versus 27 percent a year ago.

With Chinese travelers grounded for the foreseeable future, LVMH is putting the accent on local marketing campaigns and rethinking its attitude toward 24S, the online arm of Paris department store Le Bon Marché, considered the poor parent of its selective retailing division since its launch in 2017.

“Our 24S platform did quite well, I’m happy to say, in the recent months,” said Guiony. “We wouldn’t call this a full and lasting success yet, but it’s encouraging.”

Guiony noted that LVMH was unlikely to partner with online giant Amazon or Facebook on their luxury ventures, and will continue instead to invest in its own e-commerce capabilities.

“Some partners like Tmall, for instance, in China are extremely important and not being with them — and I’m talking about mostly cosmetics — is really not getting access to a large chunk of the potential customer base,” he acknowledged.

“But it’s not the general case for luxury — this is the exception more than the norm. So maybe we’ll have a different reasoning in five years’ or 10 years’ time, but for the time being, we don’t see the need to team up with anybody when it comes to distribution. We feel we are doing pretty well ourselves,” he added.

While 24S has already changed names once — it was originally known as 24 Sèvres — he believes it should be more closely identified with Le Bon Marché.

“To be frank, we cannot use the Bon Marché dot-com name, which doesn’t belong to us. But definitely we want more integration between the 24S and Bon Marché, because we think the curation potential of Le Bon Marché is obviously extremely important,” Guiony said.

While it marks a change of tone from LVMH, which has frequently criticized the presence of counterfeit goods on online sales platforms, Guiony clarified that e-commerce would remain a complementary channel.

“Stores will be the privileged way to deal with our customers going forward. We are not trying to replace stores with online sales, but we welcome our customers to shop online if they feel that way,” he said.

Looking ahead, he said LVMH was still adjusting to the collapse in global tourism, whose ramifications were felt in almost every division. Before the pandemic, travelers accounted for 40 percent of luxury goods purchases in value terms, according to analysts.

Sales of perfumes and cosmetics were down 16 percent in the third quarter, despite a steady increase in online sales and a promising start for Fenty’s new skin-care line.

There was a 14 percent decline in sales of watches and jewelry, while selective distribution — which includes Sephora and DFS, LVMH’s travel-retail business — saw revenues plummet 29 percent.

In wines and spirits, the decline in revenues was limited to 3 percent, thanks to the strong performance of Hennessy cognac, especially in the U.S.

Guiony did not forecast much change in travel trends until a vaccine for the coronavirus is found. “I am not particularly hopeful that we’ll see a lot of touristic flows before that,” he said.

That means luxury brands have to find new ways of capturing Chinese spending, of which 40 percent occurred overseas before the pandemic. “There is no such thing as a Chinese traveler for the time being,” said Guiony.

“We hope that we shall be able in due course to extract as much value as we can from the Chinese customers by enabling them to shop where they want to shop. But for the time being there are serious constraints as to their ability to shop outside China, and this is obviously a weight on the growth for coming quarters,” he added.

LVMH’s revenues totaled 11.95 billion euros in the third quarter, down 10 percent in reported terms. The group confirmed its ambition to strengthen its lead in the global luxury market in 2020.

Analysts expect the group to outperform the rest of the luxury sector. HSBC has maintained its “buy” rating on the stock, and raised the target price to 480 euros, versus a closing price of 403 euros on the Paris Stock Exchange on Thursday.

“For LVMH’s key profit contributors there is no such thing as a ‘new normal’ because of COVID-19,” HSBC said in a recent research note. “LVMH’s high margins and healthy balance sheet should allow the group to increase its leadership positions even further. LVMH has now created a gap versus competitors in size and quality that we believe should prove difficult to close.”

LVMH is the first major luxury group to report third-quarter results. Kering and Hermès International are scheduled to publish their sales on Oct. 22, while Compagnie Financière Richemont is set to present interim results on Nov. 6, and Burberry on Nov. 12.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9999552965164185}",positive,0.9999552965164185,1
"LVMH, Tiffany Reach New $15.8 Billion Deal, Agree to Settle Legal Dispute - The Fashion Law","Thu, 29 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWZhc2hpb25sYXcuY29tL2x2bWgtdGlmZmFueS1yZWFjaC1uZXctMTUtOC1iaWxsaW9uLWRlYWwtYWdyZWUtdG8tc2V0dGxlLWxlZ2FsLWRpc3B1dGUv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton and Tiffany & Co. have managed to salvage their deal, with the French luxury goods conglomerate agreeing to pay a few dollars less per share to acquire the New York-based jewelry company. In a statement on Thursday, the parties confirmed that LVMH will pay $131.5 per Tiffany share, down from the $135/share price tag they initially agreed to in November 2019 before the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. As a whole, the deal amounts to a whopping $15.8 billion merger.

“We are as convinced as ever of the formidable potential of the Tiffany brand and believe that LVMH is the right home for Tiffany and its employees during this exciting next chapter,” LVMH chairman Bernard Arnault said in the statement. More than merely shoring up the transaction, which had gone awry in the midst of the global health pandemic, the new deal brings an end to the bitter legal dispute that Tiffany & Co. initiated in a Delaware court. “Tiffany and LVMH have also agreed to settle their pending litigation in the Delaware Chancery Court,” the statement from the companies said.

In the lawsuit that it filed in September, Tiffany sought a court order requiring LVMH to “abide by its contractual obligation under the merger agreement to complete the transaction on the agreed terms” on the heels of LVMH pulling out of the deal, citing a letter from the French government requesting that it push back the closing date for the merger (in light of a tax battle between the U.S. and France over the latter’s digital services tax). More than that, LVMH argued that it had grounds to drop out of the deal because the management of the COVID crisis by Tiffany’s management and its Board of Directors fell short, enacting the Material Adverse Effect clause in the deal, and thereby, putting the validity of the deal at risk.

The headline-making transaction – which received all of the necessary regulatory approvals as of this week – is expected to close in early 2021, subject to Tiffany shareholder approval. “We are very pleased to have reached an agreement with LVMH at an attractive price and to now be able to proceed with the merger, said Tiffany Chairman Roger Farah. “The board concluded it was in the best interests of all of our stakeholders to achieve certainty of closing.”

In a note on Thursday, Bernstein analyst Luca Solca said that he sees “material value that LVMH could unlock at Tiffany,” including as a tool to “reinforcing its watches and jewelry business – so far the weakest division in terms of Return on Invested Capital performance.” As for the “relatively modest discount” that the parties agreed upon, that “seems to confirm the strength of Tiffany’s negotiating position, a common willingness to find a practical solution, and – possibly – a point of principle on Tiffany’s decision to continue to pay a dividend under the current fiscal year circumstances.”

With its $15.8 billion price tag, the deal still maintains the title of the largest deal in the luxury goods sphere, topping the $13.1 billion that LVMH paid in 2017 to take full control of Christian Dior – both the brand, itself, and the larger holding company – in a complex internal transaction aimed at simplifying the structure of the businesses, which had “long been requested by the market,” per Arnault.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9995823502540588}",neutral,0.9995823502540588,0
Tiffany and LVMH Conclude Revised Deal - WWD,"Wed, 28 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3dkLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy1uZXdzL2ZpbmFuY2lhbC90aWZmYW55LWxtdmgtYmVybmFyZC1hcm5hdWx0LWJ1eW91dC1kZWFsLWJhY2stb24tMTIzNDY0ODY1OC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Tiffany & Co. and LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton are getting married after all.

The recently warring firms jointly announced that they have “concluded an agreement modifying certain terms of their initial agreement” and a new purchase price of $131.50 in cash per share versus an original offer of $135. Tiffany and LVMH have also agreed to settle their pending litigation in the Delaware Chancery Court.

“We are very pleased to have reached an agreement with LVMH at an attractive price and to now be able to proceed with the merger,” Roger Farah, chairman of the board of directors of Tiffany, said in a statement. “The board concluded it was in the best interests of all of our stakeholders to achieve certainty of closing.”

Bernard Arnault, president and chief executive officer of LVMH and one of the industry’s most formidable dealmakers, commented: “This balanced agreement with Tiffany’s Board allows LVMH to work on the Tiffany acquisition with confidence and resume discussions with Tiffany’s management on the integration details. We are as convinced as ever of the formidable potential of the Tiffany brand and believe that LVMH is the right home for Tiffany and its employees during this exciting next chapter.”

Tiffany’s current ceo Alessandro Bogliolo added: “We continue to believe in the power and value of the Tiffany brand and the compelling long-term strategic and financial benefits of this combination.”

Regulatory hurdles have already been cleared, and the deal is expected to close in early 2021, subject to Tiffany shareholder approval and customary closing conditions.

The confirmation confirms a report in Thursday’s WWD that the two parties had reached a truce to avoid legal proceedings deemed harmful to both parties.

The denouement puts an end to uncertainties that were seen as harmful to Tiffany as it faces its most critical quarter in the calendar year, and allows LVMH to prevail in the largest acquisition in the luxury sector with a roughly $420 million discount.

One source suggested Tiffany was increasingly concerned it might not prevail in the Delaware court, and came under pressure from shareholders to go back to the negotiating table with LVMH. Also, with coronavirus cases spiraling in Europe, the U.S. and elsewhere, LVMH’s argument of a material adverse impact was looking more and more irrefutable.

Other legal experts, however, have argued that LVMH would have faced an uphill climb to make its case in court.

Now the main task is to bury the hatchet.

It’s been a messy fight since LVMH said it was walking away from the deal in September, pointing at first to an unusual request from the French government (which is in the midst of a trade spat with Washington) and then mismanagement, poor performance and clauses in the contract.

The legal battle between the two — filled with lots of fireworks and big legal flourishes — can now be seen as simply part and parcel of big-time deal making, where the price tags, advisory fees and reputations at stake are all outsized.

But it has also left plenty of rancor to pivot away from now.

In court papers, LVMH was critical in its assessment of Tiffany:

• “The business LVMH proposed to acquire in November 2019 — Tiffany & Co., a consistently highly profitable luxury retail brand — no longer exists. What remains is a mismanaged business that over the first half of 2020 hemorrhaged cash for the first time in a quarter century, with no end to its problems in sight. The sharp decline in foot traffic in malls, which are at the heart of Tiffany’s retail strategy, will have a significant long-term detrimental impact on the company.”

• “Tiffany’s recent woes are just the beginning of its troubles. The pandemic is still very active and far from over.”

• “Tiffany is particularly ill-suited for the challenges ahead.” (Pointing to trends in luxury retail sales and the company’s reliance on retail, especially New York).

• “Tiffany’s top five executives are in line to receive approximately $100 million collectively [in change of control payments]. On a stand-alone basis, Tiffany’s executives would never earn compensation like this and now, going forward, will instead have to face harsh realities and the shell of Tiffany’s former business.”

Joel Bines, global coleader of retail at AlixPartners, said all of the ill will can be easily washed away given the timescale that LVMH operates in.

“A lot of companies talk about long-range planning, but they mean a three-year plan or five-year plan, LVMH thinks in generations,” Bines said. “For LVMH to have a row with a company like Tiffany in the time horizon under which they are thinking about…is probably meaningless. They’re thinking about what Tiffany looks like in a generation.”

And people who work at the tony jeweler have every reason to move forward.

“If you approach it from the Tiffany side, it’s just a question of what is the best thing to do and in a situation like this, you can pout and lick your wounds or you can focus on a good outcome,” Bines said. “And if Tiffany focuses on a good outcome and understands the incredible gift that they have just been given — of time, in generations — than this will blow over and our children will know a completely different Tiffany.”

If Tiffany employees have been rattled in the back and forth, it’s an unease that can only be coming on top of the nervousness that no doubt accompanies a global pandemic and an epic recession.

“Tiffany employees are going to recognize that LVMH is a great employer and a strong company,” said Jonathan Low, a partner at the Predictiv consultancy.

The back-on again deal, though, raises again questions of scale and just what kind of massive influence LVMH has in the global marketplace means (a topic big tech has been wrestling with in increasingly public ways).

“The big are getting bigger and I think the concern for merchants and customers long-term is, if everything is controlled by LVMH or Amazon, what is choice really about anymore?” Low said. “Is this going to affect innovation in fashion? Is it going to affect innovation in jewelry? Is it going to affect what sort of products people are going to see and will it spark a backlash from people who say, ‘All this stuff looks the same and it comes from the same place and I want something new’?”

That work is likely to involve new leadership, boutique upgrades and plenty more luxury razzmatazz.

So say equity analysts and others polled in the wake of Thursday’s news that LVMH and Tiffany had agreed on new deal terms and ditched their rancorous legal proceedings against each other. The firms jointly announced they had “concluded an agreement modifying certain terms of their initial agreement” and a new purchase price of $131.50 in cash per share, versus an original offer of $135.

The truce paves the way for the French group — which has revved up Dior, Fendi, Loewe, Bulgari and other brands — to try its hand at one of America’s most iconic names, synonymous with diamonds, blue gift boxes, Audrey Hepburn — and breakfast.

“LVMH is a master at selling perceived exclusivity to the masses,” said Luca Solca, senior research analyst, global luxury goods at Bernstein. “This, I expect, will be the most important contribution that LVMH can bring to Tiffany.”

In Solca’s view, Tiffany harbors the same potential it did in November 2019, when LVMH launched its original $16.2 billion takeover bid, but the current leadership “falls short on executing on this mission, and behaved sometimes in the past too much as a mass-market retailer.”

“It would seem natural that LVMH may appoint a new leader for the business down the road,” Solca said, also adding that, “Tiffany probably needs stronger specialist design talent in jewelry.”

Its current chief artistic director, Reed Krakoff, spent most of his career in fashion and leather goods, having been the head of a namesake fashion house, which closed in 2015, and the longtime president and executive creative director for Coach. Krakoff has been productive during his time at Tiffany. In addition to reimagining and expanding on the jeweler’s signature “T” collection, he introduced The Blue Box Cafe, added three distinct high-jewelry collections; introduced Tiffany Paper Flowers, which runs from fine to high jewelry, and launched the brand’s first comprehensive men’s offering.

According to Solca, LVMH is likely to update the design jewelry offer, rejuvenate timepiece collections, rationalize and improve the physical retail network, improve digital execution and update brand communications.

“I believe LVMH has what it needs to potentially enhance Tiffany’s fortunes,” he concluded.

One source familiar with LVMH said it is likely to drive Tiffany more upscale and “re-enchant the brand” by improving product desirability and customer service while revamping stores and sharpening the American company’s messaging.

As for a potential leader from a group that tends to promote from within, the source named only one: Michael Burke, chairman and chief executive officer of Louis Vuitton, LVMH’s flagship and cash-cow brand.

“It takes someone who knows America very well because the organizational structure is way different than in Europe,” the source said.

Long a key protégé of Bernard Arnault, Burke started his career with the French business titan in 1980, working at various of his holdings before joining Dior in the U.S., ultimately becoming president. He was president of Louis Vuitton’s U.S. operations for four years before returning to Paris in 1997 as Dior’s executive vice president.

He has also been the ceo of Fendi, and was briefly the ceo of Bulgari shortly after LVMH snapped up the Roman jeweler in 2011 for 3.7 billion euros.

During his tenure at Vuitton, Burke has put a strong focus on watches and jewelry, recruiting the high-profile designer Francesca Amfitheatrof for the role of artistic director of those categories in 2018. Before that, she headed the jewelry design team at Tiffany.

While HSBC analyst Erwan Rambourg said Tiffany’s current management is strong and has improved the company, he, too, expects changes in leadership.

Tiffany will also have a change in outlook under LVMH, which Rambourg said can develop the brand for “the next generation, not the next quarter.”

“What LVMH will bring is a sense of urgency, a sort of intensity of management and obviously phenomenal financial means,” he said. “The positioning is right at Tiffany, there’s nothing wrong at Tiffany. What’s underdeveloped is this sort of in-your-face presence the brand should be having. It’s sort of neither here nor there, it’s not a small brand, it’s not a megabrand. I think the mission for LVMH is to make it a megabrand.

“Look at Vuitton 10 years ago and look at what it’s become today,” Rambourg said. “It was a big brand, now it’s become completely unavoidable. I think LVMH has the power to make that happen at Tiffany.”

In announcing their truce on Thursday, Tiffany and LVMH assumed a conciliatory tone.

“We are very pleased to have reached an agreement with LVMH at an attractive price and to now be able to proceed with the merger,” Roger Farah, chairman of the board of Tiffany, said in a statement. “The board concluded it was in the best interests of all of our stakeholders to achieve certainty of closing.”

Bernard Arnault, president and ceo of LVMH and one of the industry’s most formidable dealmakers, commented: “This balanced agreement with Tiffany’s board allows LVMH to work on the Tiffany acquisition with confidence and resume discussions with Tiffany’s management on the integration details. We are as convinced as ever of the formidable potential of the Tiffany brand and believe that LVMH is the right home for Tiffany and its employees during this exciting next chapter.”

Tiffany’s current ceo, Alessandro Bogliolo, added: “We continue to believe in the power and value of the Tiffany brand and the compelling long-term strategic and financial benefits of this combination.”

Regulatory hurdles have already been cleared, and the deal is expected to close in early 2021, subject to Tiffany shareholder approval and customary closing conditions.

The denouement puts an end to uncertainties that were seen as harmful to Tiffany as it faces its most critical quarter in the calendar year, and allows LVMH to prevail in the largest acquisition in the luxury sector with a discount of about 420 million euros.

That discounted price doesn’t factor in the 58-cent dividend Tiffany will pay per share next month. (The fact that the jeweler kept to its long-held practice of paying dividends in good times and bad through the pandemic was one of many points that irked LVMH as the legal battle played out.)



Extra caution was taken to make sure there’s little to no wiggle room in the revised deal.

“We wound up with a better prenup than Melania,” said one source close to Tiffany, referring to President Trump’s marriage agreement to First Lady Melania Trump.

The source said Tiffany remained very confident in its legal case and that it was not being pressured by shareholders when LVMH reached back out to start negotiations back up.

A fuller and on-the-record retelling of how the negotiations resumed and proceeded should be revealed as the regulatory paperwork is updated, fleshing out the merger and acquisition case study that is Tiffany vs. LVMH.

What has been filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission so far shows an effort to put all the wrangling into the past with changes to the termination provisions and a set schedule of how the two parties will stay in touch between now and closing, which can’t happen before Jan. 7.

And if somehow things do go off the rails, the purchase price could conceivably snap back to the original level.

“In the event that registrant [Tiffany] brings any claim, litigation, or other similar proceeding to enforce the terms of the amended merger agreement or for money damages, the ‘per share merger consideration’ will be deemed, for all purposes in such proceeding, including any award of specific performance or damages, to be $135 in cash,” Tiffany said in a regulatory filing.

Morgan Stanley analysts were sanguine if the deal had derailed. “Tiffany offers interesting opportunities for LVMH, but is not a ‘must do transaction’, among other reasons because of LVMH’s strong opportunities with its existing portfolio of 70 brands,” the investment firm said in a recent research report, noting that Tiffany’s enterprise value represents only about 7 percent of LVMH’s market capitalization.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.999794065952301}",neutral,0.999794065952301,0
Why the new LVMH-Tiffany deal makes sense - Vogue Business,"Thu, 29 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZvZ3VlYnVzaW5lc3MuY29tL2NvbXBhbmllcy93aHktdGhlLW5ldy1sdm1oLXRpZmZhbnktZGVhbC1tYWtlcy1zZW5zZdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"A historic luxury mega-deal is back on. French luxury conglomerate LVMH and American jeweller Tiffany & Co. said on Thursday that they have reached an agreement on a purchase price of $131.50 in cash, instead of the initial $135-a-share agreement, representing a 2.5 per cent discount on the original price.

Other key terms of the merger agreement remain unchanged, the companies said. They have also agreed to settle their pending litigation in the Delaware Chancery Court.

“This balanced agreement with Tiffany’s board allows LVMH to work on the Tiffany acquisition with confidence and resume discussions with Tiffany’s management on the integration details,” LVMH president and chief executive Bernard Arnault said. “We are as convinced as ever of the formidable potential of the Tiffany brand and believe that LVMH is the right home for Tiffany and its employees during this exciting next chapter.”

“The board concluded it was in the best interests of all of our stakeholders to achieve certainty of closing,” Tiffany chairman of the board of directors Roger Farah said.

The small size of the price cut has raised some eyebrows. “The amount of the discount is quite modest, but it is broadly equivalent to just a little higher than the dividends [that Tiffany had given to its shareholders despite the crisis]. It seems that LVMH renegotiated out of principle,” Bernstein analyst Luca Solca explains.

A French luxury sector source, who asked to remain anonymous due to the sensitivity of the topic, claims: “I think that LVMH wasn’t in a good position on the legal front. But there’s a great image risk in buying reluctantly at the initial price. Therefore buying at a discount, albeit very small, sends a better message to the outside world and conveys a better image of Tiffany. LVMH saves face.”

Mario Ortelli, founding partner of luxury consultancy Ortelli & Co. in London, notes: “It’s a tweak on the price. It’s the common ground between the two parties.”

From LVMH shareholders’ perspective, the deal strengthens the group’s presence in the attractive jewellery market and provides reassurance. “Being reassured that the group has a sound strategy when it comes to integrating assets in the long run is more important than a couple of billions in price reduction,” Ortelli says.

Sales at LVMH’s watches and jewellery division, which includes Bulgari, Chaumet and Tag Heuer, were down 14 per cent in the third quarter, underperforming compared with the fashion and leather goods division, which was up 12 per cent. Group sales were down 7 per cent.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9670983552932739}",neutral,0.9670983552932739,0

Under the revised terms, LVMH would acquire Tiffany for $130 to $133 per share, compared with an original price of $135 per share, Faber reported, noting the talks remain fluid. He added the retailers are looking to get a deal done as soon as possible. Earlier, there had been a discussion of a tender offer, but that is unlikely at this point, those familiar with the talks said.

Representatives from Tiffany and LVMH did not immediately respond to CNBC's requests for comment.

Tiffany shares jumped nearly 5% Tuesday to about $128.75. The stock has fallen about 8% this year. Tiffany has a market cap of about $15.2 billion.

On Monday, Tiffany said it had received all regulatory approvals needed to complete the acquisition, having received the nod it needed from the European Commission.

In the midst of the coronavirus pandemic, LVMH has been trying to get out of the deal, which would have been the biggest-ever in the luxury industry.

Tiffany has filed a lawsuit to enforce the agreement, alleging that the French conglomerate has deliberately been stalling the deal from going through. LVMH has since countersued, alleging Tiffany has been mismanaged during the global health crisis.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9997846484184265}",neutral,0.9997846484184265,0
Surging Vuitton sales boost LVMH despite pandemic woes - CNBC,"Fri, 16 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tLzIwMjAvMTAvMTYvc3VyZ2luZy12dWl0dG9uLXNhbGVzLWJvb3N0LWx2bWgtZGVzcGl0ZS1wYW5kZW1pYy13b2VzLmh0bWzSAV9odHRwczovL3d3dy5jbmJjLmNvbS9hbXAvMjAyMC8xMC8xNi9zdXJnaW5nLXZ1aXR0b24tc2FsZXMtYm9vc3QtbHZtaC1kZXNwaXRlLXBhbmRlbWljLXdvZXMuaHRtbA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Recovering sales of Louis Vuitton handbags helped LVMH contain the fallout from the coronavirus crisis in the third quarter, as the world's biggest luxury goods group reported a smaller-than-expected drop in revenues.

LVMH has like peers been hurt by the pandemic, and the French conglomerate has also hit the headlines as it seeks to walk away from its planned acquisition of U.S. jeweller Tiffany in the midst of the crisis.

But LVMH has proved more resilient than some of its smaller peers, despite travel restrictions and store closures that have affected the whole industry, and its shares are only down 3% since the beginning of the year.

On Thursday, LVMH said its overall comparable sales fell 7% in the third quarter, beating analysts' average forecast for a 12% fall, with revenues coming in just under 12 billion euros ($14 billion).

Its fashion and handbag division in particular set a high bar for rivals including Gucci-owner Kering, after sales swung back into positive territory and rose 12% like-for-like, which strips out acquisitions and currency changes.

The division is home to Vuitton and Christian Dior, which dominate revenues, but Chief Financial Officer Jean-Jacques Guiony said the performance of other labels like Loewe, Celine and Fendi had also improved.

""The update confirms our impression of a strong summer for luxury goods,"" Bernstein analyst Luca Solca said in a note, adding other top brands including Hermes will likely have benefited.

Resurging sales among Chinese customers in particular, after China emerged from its coronavirus lockdown before much of Europe, also helped, Guiony said.

""China turned positive in the third quarter at Vuitton,"" he told an analyst conference call.

Tiffany Stand Off

LVMH, which owns and beauty chain Sephora and travel retailer DFS, did not escape all pain, however. Its revenues were down 21% like-for-like in the first nine months of 2020 as a whole.

In the third quarter, comparable sales at the retailing division - the most exposed to travel flows - plunged 29%, while sales of perfume and cosmetics dropped 16% and watches and jewellery, where it rivals Tiffany, fell 14%.

The wines and spirits unit, home to its Hennessy cognac brand, fared a little better, with sales down 3% in the three months to the end of September.

LVMH's $16 billion acquisition of Tiffany, announced before the pandemic erupted, ran into trouble last month when the French group said it could no longer complete the deal.

It cited a French political intervention preventing it from doing so, but also what it described as the jeweller's ""dismal"" performance.

The two sides are facing off in a Delaware court, with Tiffany seeking to force LVMH to honour the deal.

Earlier on Thursday, Tiffany unexpectedly published preliminary results, saying its sales have been rising through October as its business rebounds from pandemic lows. It added it expected fourth-quarter sales to fall by under 10%.

LVMH, which has refuted accusations that it deliberately stalled the transaction and is pressing ahead with antitrust filings, said in its release that it expected to receive approval for the deal from European authorities in October.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9999409914016724}",positive,0.9999409914016724,1

Kicking off the seventh school year, Chantal Gaemperle, who heads the group’s human resources activities and founded the program, applauded the engagement of students, and noted support from organizers.

“You were able to count on the unfailing support of the the teams of the IME, the maisons of the group and the 22 partner schools,” she said, speaking through a Zoom meeting. LVMH counts 18 company-run training schools.

“It’s an entire ecosystem offering responsibility, unity and solidarity, that is by your side to allow you to continue to learn from the best and acquire the unique skills that are so precious to our maisons,” added Gaemperle.

Last year’s ceremony brought together 300 people for a photo shoot, and featured LVMH chairman and chief executive officer Bernard Arnault, who declared “we are all artisans at LVMH.”

These days, the coronavirus pandemic has highlighted the relevance of such programs, noted Gaemperle, who lauded work by apprentices in couture making masks and the role of technology students who helped professors move their classes online.

“IME is a community of 900 apprentices, more than half have found work in our various activities,” she said.

“To those who haven’t found a contract, in this difficult context, I would like to say this: we are convinced of your value and your potential and you can count on the IME to accompany you,” said Gaemperle.

The program, which counts apprentices in France, Switzerland, Italy and Spain, covers dozens of crafts and creative professions and includes retail training.

LVMH has also partnered with local authorities in cities with limited resources, and hosts a vocational fair every year in Clichy-sous-Bois, a Paris suburb.

The online event featured executives and trainees at Tag Heuer in Switzerland, who explained how they set up new training sessions online as well as a laboratory center of research and development for the group’s cosmetics activity.

Participants outlined the challenges of training during lockdown period, explaining how they drew up projects that were compatible with the constraints.

Complementing the online meeting, LVMH held small gatherings at the Dior and Chaumet workshops in Paris.

“We are lucky to be able to work with our hands,” noted an apprentice in the Chaumet workshop, which overlooks the Place Vendôme. He explained the differences of working with gold and platinum — platinum is more challenging to manipulate — and noted that he often gets questioned about the challenge of working with valuable stones.

“As artisans, we’re more focused on the work,” he explained.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999874830245972}",neutral,0.9999874830245972,0

Revenue for the category fell 14% to EUR 947 million ($1.11 billion) for the three months ending September 30.

“A rebound in China was observed in the third quarter, but did not prevent the overall activity from dropping…in the period,” the luxury group noted.

Bulgari introduced Barocko, a new line of fine jewelry, and debuted new watch models, which performed well. TAG Heuer became the official partner of the Porsche Golf Cup France following the debut of a special golf smart watch.

Luxury goods company LVMH has been given the go-ahead by the competition authorities of the European Commission to take over its sector counterpart Tiffany for $16.2 billion (€13.8 billion).

The takeover has only one catch: LVMH no longer wants to go ahead without a major revision of the price.

LVMH – the initials stand for Louis Vuitton Moet Hennessy – is based in France and has fashion, champagne and cognac in its name, and a wide range of clothing, cosmetics, fashion accessories, jewellery, perfumes, spirits, watches and wine brands in its portfolio.

Some examples: Château d'Yquem, Dom Pérignon, Glenmorangie, Christian Dior, Givenchy, Kenzo, Givenchy Parfums, Guerlain, Bulgari and TAG Heuer.

Tiffany, based in New York, is renowned for its jewellery, but also sells silverware, china, crystal, stationery, fragrances, water bottles, watches, personal accessories, and leather goods.

“The Commission concluded that the proposed concentration would not raise competition concerns given the moderate market shares of the combined entity, the presence of a significant number of third-party suppliers, and the recent entry of several new competitors,” the Commission said in a statement.

The original price offered by LVMH was $135 (€115) a share back in November 2019, which would have made it the biggest deal ever in the luxury market, but the world has changed since then. The coronavirus pandemic has pulled the rug out from under the luxury market, which LVMH thinks has also reduced the value of Tiffany.

At the same time LVMH accused Tiffany of mismanagement, for example by paying out dividends to shareholders despite the difficulties of the pandemic.

Tiffany sued LVMH for wanting to pull out of the deal. LVMH counter-sued over mismanagement. In the end, the two companies came to the negotiating table to discuss a compromise.

The EU’s decision may seem like an irrelevance in the current circumstances, but the go-ahead from Brussels will be crucial if and when an agreement is reached. Ironically, the announcement of the competition authorities’ decision saw Tiffany’s share price go up by 33c to $123.13, while LVMH quote fell by $4.05 to $417.70.

The two companies are discussing a new offer price of $130 to $133. Should the talks break down, the lawsuits are still pending.

French Billionaire Might Prefer Cartier to Tiffany - Yahoo Finance,"Mon, 05 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9mcmVuY2gtYmlsbGlvbmFpcmUtbWlnaHQtcHJlZmVyLWNhcnRpZXItMDYwMDM1ODEyLmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Ever since LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE said it was walking away from Tiffany & Co., the question has been why?

The obvious answer is that LVMH chairman Bernard Arnault is trying to shave the $16 billion purchase price that now looks too high given the damage inflicted on the luxury industry by Covid-19. But saving a couple of billion dollars is a rounding error to a company with a market capitalization of about $240 billion. It could hardly be worth getting dragged into an acrimonious fight.

Another possibility is that he’s interested in pursuing alternative opportunities. One recurring scenario among the market speculation is that LVMH could look to make a bid for Cartier-owner Cie Financiere Richemont SA.

LVMH needs to bulk up in the faster-growing jewelry market, where it lacks scale — that’s why it struck the deal with Tiffany in the first place. Richemont is currently the world’s biggest branded jeweler by market share, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. And it’s not just thanks to Cartier, which has gained a strong following among millennials. Richemont also owns Van Cleef & Arpels.

Unlike Tiffany, Richemont is not a pure jeweler. It has a sizeable watch business, as well as pen-maker Montblanc and a collection of fashion-and-accessories brands including Chloe and Dunhill. And then there is Yoox Net-a-Porter, a luxury online retailer.

Richemont would be a much bigger acquisition for LVMH than Tiffany, giving Arnault an even more dominant position in luxury. Annual sales of the combined group would be four times that of nearest rival, Gucci-owner Kering SA.

A deal of this size isn’t impossible for LVMH. The Geneva-based Richemont has a market capitalization of about 35 billion Swiss francs ($38 billion). Assuming the 30% premium that investors would typically expect, that would mean an offer price of about 45.5 billion francs, equivalent to about three times the price of Tiffany. Even at this level LVMH’s net debt at the end of 2021 would still be less than 2.5 times the estimated Ebitda for the combined group.

Story continues

Its temping to think that LVMH could do both deals. But that isn’t practical, primarily because it would likely have to pay a bigger premium than that 30% for Richemont. After all, Richemont’s chairman, Johann Rupert, is going to need some persuading to sell when the stock is still relatively depressed. He holds 10% of the equity and 51% of the voting rights. He insisted in May that the company had no intention of merging or being acquired. What’s more, his 33-year-old son Anton joined the board in 2017, paving the way for a possible handover to the next generation.

But with watch sales hit hard by the pandemic and Richemont battling stiff competition from smartwatches, it could risk falling behind peers in other faster-growing segments. Plus, with the question of succession coming into sharper relief, maybe Rupert would be more open to a deal.

To convince him, LVMH would have to pay more. It could afford a 60% premium in a cash-only bid and still keep the leverage ratio below 3 times. And that’s before any disposals. While YNAP has underperformed, it could still be worth about $6 billion because online shopping is booming and tech stocks have been soaring.

Alternatively, LVMH could offer a mixture of cash and shares. That would enable Rupert to participate in the potential upside brought by bringing the two luxury conglomerates together.

Of course, all this is academic right now. LVMH must first convince a U.S. court to release it from its Tiffany engagement. A hearing is set for early next year.

Immediately falling into the arms of another bride after that might look more like something from a trashy reality TV show than the rarefied world of luxury. Arnault’s reputation may suffer. But as with securing the most favorable terms for Tiffany, he has a duty to his shareholders to get the best prize. If that is the owner of Cartier, then it’s a risk worth taking.

Arnault’s investment group acquired a more than 5 percent stake in Lagardere SCA, once a sprawling conglomerate covering everything from cars and planes to space that’s now focused on media, publishing and retail outlets at airports and train stations. The purchase is a precursor to Arnault’s group playing a greater role in those activities, people familiar with discussions at the two companies said.

Why would Arnault, known as France’s most successful investment banker after he shrewdly acquired an armada of luxury brands — from Dior and Fendi to Louis Vuitton, Hennessy Cognac and Dom Perignon Champagne — want a piece of a struggling group like Lagardere?

For Arnault observers, it’s all about political influence.

Lagardere’s stable of media assets includes such French brands as Paris Match, a glossy photo magazine that has often boosted the chances of presidential hopefuls, the all-news radio station Europe 1 and the influential Le Journal du Dimanche weekly paper. While the media unit is losing money and carries little weight beyond France, within the country — where business and politics are intricately intertwined — it has clout.

Arnault’s formidable wealth — his net worth is about $86 billion according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index — already makes him hugely influential in France. But having more pull never hurt anyone, said Remy Le Champion, the co-head of the French Press Institute’s journalism program at Paris-Assas University.

“Bernard Arnault has access to anyone he wants in the government,” he said. “Still, extremely rich people often have a hobby horse. The benefits brought by the ownership of a media largely make up for the relatively limited cost for a man whose net worth is 80 billion.”

Take the Tiffany case, for example. Arnault, who has been adding to his media assets over the years, was able to lean on the French government for help to pull out of the deal. LVMH secured a letter from Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian that asked for a delay in the deal because of a US-France trade dispute, which the company cited as a reason for getting out.

LVMH denied it played a role in obtaining the letter, but Le Drian told parliament he had responded to a query from the company, and said in an interview that it’s his “duty to protect French interests,” effectively melding the company’s priorities with those of the country.

Arnault-controlled LVMH owns Les Echos, France’s main financial business daily and Le Parisien, Paris’s staple read. The classical music aficionado also controls Radio Classique, a station that covers news in its morning programs.

Being the owner of these newspapers gives him media clout, and that means you want him off your back.

“Being the owner of these newspapers gives him media clout, and that means you want him off your back,” said Julia Cage, a professor of economics at Sciences Po in Paris, referring to the Le Drian letter.

The Lagardere stake purchase will allow the billionaire to deepen his media presence and also forge closer ties between similar businesses at the two companies, analysts at Oddo BHF wrote in a note. LVMH owns the duty-free store network DFS, and has a stake in Madrigall group, owner of Gallimard, the publisher of authors like Nobel laureate Patrick Modiano.

Arnault also plans to buy a 40 percent stake in the press group behind the influential business magazine Challenges, its chief Claude Perdriel told Le Monde this month.

“Having media assets owned by industrial figures, even if they aren’t interventionist, fosters distrust and doubt,” said Cage, who chairs a Le Monde readers’ association, adding that it gives them an “outsized” influence over the government.

Arnault isn’t the only French billionaire investing in media assets. Telecom moguls Martin Bouygues and Patrick Drahi respectively control or own broadcaster TF1 and 24-hour news channel BFM TV, while Xavier Niel co-owns the daily, Le Monde. The Dassault industrial family owns Le Figaro newspaper while Vincent Bollore with his eponymous group owns a controlling stake in Vivendi SA’s CNews TV network as well as a stake in Lagardere.

The internet era has disrupted the media business, shrinking its client-base and advertising revenue and driving it into the arms of rich patrons for life support. In the past decade, the circulation of Lagardere’s Paris Match — once France’s best-selling news magazine — has dropped by 100,000 to just over 500,000.

For Arnault, who has bankrolled a range of activities in France — pledging 200 million euros for the rebuilding of the Notre Dame de Paris cathedral gutted in a fire last year and hosting contemporary art exhibitions at his Fondation Louis Vuitton — the Lagardere stake purchase is also a way to support a once-storied French industrial group.

The conglomerate was started by Jean-Luc Lagardere, who was Arnault’s tennis partner until his death in 2003. It has been in troubled waters, with Jean-Luc’s son, Arnaud Lagardere, assailed by activist investor Amber Capital for more than two years over bad governance.

The investment “underscores our attachment to the integrity and development of” Lagardere, Groupe Arnault said in its statement on September 24. It declined to comment on Arnault’s media ambitions or on analysis suggesting it was aimed at buying political influence.

The billionaire’s push for media assets is less about making money and more about controlling the narrative at home, said Paris-Assas’s Le Champion.

In 2016, a controversy emerged when Les Echos and Le Parisien chose not to publish a review of the documentary “Merci Patron” (Thanks Boss). The documentary by Francois Ruffin, a left wing activist-turned-member-of-parliament, was a critique of LVMH and the power of the wealthy. A year later, Les Echos journalists criticised an editorial decision to take out Ruffin’s name from a piece written by a columnist.

That said, many at Arnault-owned publications say there have been few examples of censorship. Pierre Louette, the chief executive of the Les Echos-Le Parisien group, characterised its ties with the owner as “natural, fluid and normal.”

Still, Les Echos treaded lightly on the issue of whether LVMH had leaned on the government to pull out of the Tiffany deal, saying instead that it was “collateral damage” in the trade war between France and the US.

“I don’t think anyone is picking up the phone and complaining to reporters when Bernard Arnault doesn’t like a story in Les Echos,” Le Champion said. “Rather, we’re talking about subtle influence, assumptions, self-imposed limits.”

LVMH sees green shoots of recovery in spirits and fashion - DFNIonline.com,"Thu, 15 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRmbmlvbmxpbmUuY29tL2JyYW5kLW5ld3MvbGlxdW9yLXdpbmVzL2x2bWgtc2Vlcy1ncmVlbi1zaG9vdHMtcmVjb3Zlcnktc3Bpcml0cy1mYXNoaW9uLTE1LTEwLTIwMjAv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton recorded revenue of €30.3bn in the first nine months of 2020, down 21%. Organic revenue also declined 21% compared to the same period in 2019.

The Group saw significant improvement in trends in Wines & Spirits and Fashion & Leather Goods in Q3 2020, while Perfumes & Cosmetics, Watches & Jewelry and Selective Retailing — which includes LVMH’s travel retail business — continued to decline.

The luxury giant’s Selective Retailing Division, which houses travel retailer DFS Group and cruise retailer Starboard Cruise Services (among other businesses) saw organic revenue decline 31% in the first nine months of 2020. “DFS saw a significant decline in its activity in most destinations as a result of the suspension of international travel, which is showing no signs of improving,” the company stated.

However, the travel retailer is embarking on a gradual reopening of downtown stores in Venice, Macao and Hong Kong. More details to follow…

At the end of September, DFS announced Benjamin Vuchot (pictured below) as Chairman and CEO, succeeding Ed Brennan.

“I am excited to return to DFS at this critical juncture, when travel retail is facing both incredible opportunities as well as unprecedented challenges,” he said.

“DFS has long been known for its strong brand relationships and for the unparalleled retail experiences it creates through its global network of Gallerias and airport locations, but it has also made significant strides in ecommerce and digitalization. I believe DFS is entering the most significant phase in its history, and I look forward to being part of this journey.”

The Selective Retailing Division was buoyed be the performance of Sephora, which demonstrated good resilience during the health crisis despite the closure of almost all its stores globally for nearly two months, with improved fortunes in Q3.

For the group overall, the third quarter was more positive with marked improvement in trends compared to the first half, notably a return to growth in Cognac and Fashion & Leather Goods. Green shoots of recovery observed in June for several of the Group’s activities were confirmed in the third quarter in all regions, particularly in the US and Asia which saw growth in the period.

“In a very turbulent context, marked by continuing economic and health uncertainties, LVMH will continue to exercise caution, strengthen its cost controls and selectivity in its investments. The Group will maintain a strategy focused on preserving the value of its brands, by continuing its marketing and communication investments and relying on the exceptional quality of its products and the reactivity of its organisation. LVMH will rely on the power of its brands and the talent of its teams to further extend its global leadership in the luxury market in 2020,” the company stated.

LVMH also filed its countersuit against Tiffany with the Delaware Chancery Court on 28 September. To date, nine of the ten required regulatory authorisations have already been obtained and LVMH expects to receive approval from the European Commission by the end of October. The trial is scheduled for 5 January 2021.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9998207688331604}",positive,0.9998207688331604,1
LVMH's Philanthropy Arm Donates 5 Million Euros for COVID-19 Research - Yahoo Finance,"Fri, 09 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9sdm1oLXBoaWxhbnRocm9weS1hcm0tZG9uYXRlcy01LTE3MjcxMjYyNC5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS — LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton’s philanthropy arm is donating 5 million euros to the Pasteur Institute of Lille, France for research to help fight the coronavirus, stepping in with a boost for a project as it began to show significant promise.

The institute noted researchers had identified a molecule that has been “particularly effective” in fighting Sars-Cov-2, the coronavirus strain that causes COVID-19, and plan to launch large scale clinical trials to test it as a possible treatment.

“I am proud of this discovery that was made by research teams in the north, the region where I am from, and greatly hope that their work will come to fruition rapidly,” said Bernard Arnault, chairman and chief executive officer of LVMH in a statement from the institute. The luxury executive remarked that the institute’s discovery had incited “enormous hope for treatment.”

Citing the importance of carrying the research further, Arnault noted that was why he decided to offer support for the crucial phase of clinical trials.

“I am thrilled that the LVMH group has joined our support circle today with a significant donation that will allow us to begin a new phase in our research against COVID-19,” said Xavier Nassif, who heads the Pasteur Institute of Lille, thanking Arnault, the luxury executive’s family and LVMH.

The institution, which invests 17 million euros in research a year, funded in part by philanthropic corporate donations, noted that it was contacted by LVMH just after revealing initial results in fighting the virus.

European luxury groups and their brands have stepped in to help with COVID-19 efforts, donating funds to hospitals, making sanitary gel and and procuring masks for public authorities.

LVMH ordered 40 million masks from a Chinese industrial supplier to address the shortage in French hospitals and retooled its perfumes and cosmetics production units to manufacture and distribute large quantities of hydroalcoholic gel.

Kering’s COVID-19 efforts, meanwhile, include donations to the Hubei Red Cross Foundation in China, major Italian hospitals and the CDC Foundation in the U.S., as well as financing research at the Pasteur Institute in France.

In an example of a luxury label funding COVID-19 research, Bulgari, which belongs to LVMH, in June created the Virus Free Fund to finance research related to seeking cures to viruses. It supports the Jenner Institute at the University of Oxford, the Lazzaro Spallanzani National Institute for Infectious Diseases in Rome and the Rockefeller University in the U.S, and purchased a high technology microscope for researchers.

The fund also covers four years of doctorate studies for two students, while the Bulgari Clinical Fund will support clinical testing of new therapies, drugs and vaccines to fight COVID-19.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9457625150680542}",neutral,0.9457625150680542,0
Surging Louis Vuitton Sales Boost LVMH Despite Pandemic Woes | ESM Magazine - ESM – European Supermarket Magazine,"Fri, 16 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVzbW1hZ2F6aW5lLmNvbS9hLWJyYW5kcy9zdXJnaW5nLWxvdWlzLXZ1aXR0b24tc2FsZXMtYm9vc3QtbHZtaC1kZXNwaXRlLXBhbmRlbWljLXdvZXMtMTExNjQ00gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Recovering sales of Louis Vuitton handbags helped LVMH contain the fallout from the coronavirus crisis in the third quarter, as the world's biggest luxury goods group reported a smaller-than-expected drop in revenues.

On Thursday, the Hennessy cognac maker said its overall comparable sales fell 7% in the third quarter, beating analysts' average forecast for a 12% fall, with revenues coming in just under €12 billion.

Its fashion and handbag division in particular set a high bar for rivals, after sales swung back into positive territory and rose 12% like-for-like, which strips out acquisitions and currency changes.

The division is home to Vuitton and Christian Dior, which dominate revenues, but Chief Financial Officer Jean-Jacques Guiony said the performance of other labels like Loewe, Celine and Fendi had also improved.

""The update confirms our impression of a strong summer for luxury goods,"" Bernstein analyst Luca Solca said in a note, adding other top brands including Hermes will likely have benefited.

Resurging sales among Chinese customers in particular, after China emerged from its coronavirus lockdown before much of Europe, also helped, Guiony said.

""China turned positive in the third quarter at Vuitton,"" he told an analyst conference call.

Revenue Performance

LVMH's revenues were down 21% like-for-like in the first nine months of 2020 as a whole.

In the third quarter, comparable sales at the retailing division - the most exposed to travel flows - plunged 29%, while sales of perfume and cosmetics dropped 16% and watches and jewellery, where it rivals Tiffany, fell 14%.

The wines and spirits unit, home to its Hennessy cognac brand, fared a little better, with sales down 3% in the three months to the end of September.

Bottle Design

Elsewhere, Hennessy has teamed up with architect Frank Gehry on the development of a limited edition bottle to mark the 150th anniversary of its Hennessy X.O. variant (pictured).

“I wanted to bring Hennessy X.O. to life, and so I took inspiration from its birthplace and used this crumpling effect of the material that gives it a feeling of movement,"" Gehry commented. ""The materials I’ve chosen catch the light and make this a really beautiful object on its own, but then you realise it is a bottle of Hennessy X.O.""

In our latest round-up, we look at William Hill accepting a $3.7 billion bid from Caesars Entertainment, Louis Vuitton being named the most seized item in South Korea, Antifa being largely absent on global trademark registers, and much more. Coverage this time from Trevor Little (TL), Bridget Diakun (BD), Joyce Ng (JN), Jonathan Walfisz (JW) and Tim Lince (TJL).

Market radar:

William Hill accepts $3.7 billion bid from Caesars – Caesars Entertainment has been successful in its bid for the UK’s William Hill, with a $3.7 billion takeover offer that was accepted by the bookmaker’s board, reports Bloomberg. It would appear, then, that this announcement means that the rival bid from buyout firm Apollo Global Management Inc was rejected. The tie-up with Caesars will help WIlliam Hill to expand into sports and online betting in the US, a market that could be worth as much as $35 billion. WTR previously reported on the online betting market after Flutter Entertainment, the owner of Paddy Power, made an offer to acquire The Stars Group. M&A activity has become more common in this industry, and major players are hoping to standout in an increasingly crowded market by getting their hands on established brands with existing equity.

Clarivate completes acquisition of CPA Global – Clarivate has announced the completion of the previously announced acquisition of CPA Global. The company states that it will now offer law firm and corporate customers covering patent and trademark research solutions, expanded IP services capabilities, IP management and renewal solutions and domain management, “all underpinned by extensive human expertise, unparalleled data and powerful technology”. “This is an exciting day for our company as we unite with CPA Global to offer our combined global customer base a more comprehensive suite of IP related products and services,” said Jerre Stead, executive chairman and CEO of Clarivate. “With our joint resources and exceptional people, we are well positioned to accelerate the ways in which organizations can more effectively identify new opportunities, avoid risks, and act more efficiently throughout the innovation lifecycle.” Simon Webster, formerly CEO of CPA Global and now executive advisor to the CEO at Clarivate, added: “Together, we have the strength, scale and breadth to meet the rapidly-evolving needs of our customers - whether that’s helping them to operate more efficiently and with less risk, or by delivering the insights and information that empower them to execute their IP strategies. In the current challenging world we live in, the need for a strong, global end-to-end IP partner has never been greater.” In connection with the transaction, former CPA Global shareholders received approximately 217 million Clarivate ordinary shares, representing 35% pro forma fully diluted ownership of Clarivate.

Daren Tang officially starts at WIPO... – This week Daren Tang officially assumed his functions as director general of the World Intellectual Property Organisation, starting a six-year mandate. Previously chief executive of the Intellectual Property Office of Singapore (IPOS), Tang was appointed to the role in May and can now get to work, which he has stated will be focused on three key themes: inclusiveness, balance, and future-orientation. Speaking to WTR, Tang said: “I am very pleased to take up my duties today as WIPO director general and once again thank all Member States for their confidence in selecting me for this role. My priority is to build on the current foundations of the organisation while working toward the construction of an inclusive, balanced, vibrant and forward-looking global IP ecosystem that serves the interests of all Member States and their stakeholders, including users of WIPO’s global IP systems. I will ensure that these systems remain the premiere choice of innovators to protect their inventions, brands, designs and other IP, in multiple countries. We live in an interconnected world and it is incumbent on WIPO to nurture effective multilateral cooperation that will facilitate international trade and economic development.” (TL)

… and already has work to do – One of Tang’s immediate tasks will be to pep for a keynote speech at the upcoming International Trademark Association’s 2020 Annual Meeting & Leadership Meeting. This week INTA announced that Tang and Duncan Wardle, former vice president of innovation & creativity at The Walt Disney Company, will each examine how innovation can bring about transformation and meaningful change. They join a roster of upwards of 100 other presenters from 20 countries for the virtual event, which take place in November. “We’re honored to host our keynote speakers, who are both highly respected individuals renowned for championing new ideas. Our community is always looking for ways to innovate and grow, perhaps now more than ever given the need to adapt and stay a step ahead in the fast-moving business environment and changing consumer landscape,” said 2020 INTA president Ayala Deutsch. Alongside the educational programme will be INTAconnect, a platform that serves as a registrant directory, appointment system, and matchmaking tool – using artificial intelligence to help registrants make connections with other attendees from around the world, based on their profile, interests, and goals. “This year’s industry gathering no doubt will be a very different experience than past meetings because it will be completely virtual,” Deutsch concluded. “But it has given our team the exciting opportunity to be creative - to innovate and expand our offerings to give the INTA community a very rich experience.” (TL)

Louis Vuitton claims an unwanted title in Korea – South Korean customs has reported that Louis Vuitton is the country’s most seized luxury brand when it comes to counterfeit goods. Since 2017, 432 individual items have been seized, including 191 cases just this year. Runners up to the unwanted trophy of most seized are brands Gucci and Chanel, with Korean Customs seizing 340 and 231 pieces in the past three years respectively. The size of the haul is significant with a customs representative estimating Louis Vuitton’s seized goods would have been worth $166 million, Chanel’s would have been worth $77.4 million and Gucci’s goods would be approximately $44 million. (JW)

Antifa largely absent from trademark registries – Over recent months, US president Donald Trump has made multiple accusations that Antifa – short for Anti-fascism – is an extremist left wing organisation responsible for violence at social justice protests across the US. For that reason, the term has become known worldwide. However, unlike right wing movement QAnon – which Trump has reportedly tacitly endorsed – there is only one active USPTO trademark related to Antifa (MAKE ANTIFA GO AWAY). Outside of the US, there is a single ANTIFA trademark application, held by Axel Bürger who also has an application for marks such as BLACK LIVES MATTER. Whether more applicants seek to register the term remains to be seen. (JW)

Legal radar:

LVMH countersues Tiffany – The legal battle between LVMH and Tiffany is heating up as the former has sued the American jeweller over its own “baseless” lawsuit, reports The Fashion Law. The French luxury powerhouse has argued that it was fair to pull out of a $16.2 billion acquisition deal because it agreed to take on “a consistently highly profitable luxury retail brand” that, in its opinion, no longer exists. In a nearly 100-page complaint filed in a Delaware Chancery Court, LVMH makes claims of mismanagement, and argues the letter it received from the French foreign minister (that told the company to defer closing the transaction) is a “binding legal restraint” which prohibits LVMH from adhering to the acquisition’s 24 November deadline. Tiffany & Co chairman Roger Farah responded to the countersuit saying, “LVMH’s specious arguments are yet another blatant attempt to evade its contractual obligation to pay the agreed-upon price for Tiffany. Tiffany has acted in full compliance with the merger agreement, and we are confident the court will agree at trial and require specific performance by LVMH. Had LVMH actually believed the allegations made in its complaint, there would have been no need for LVMH to procure the letter from the French Foreign Minister as an excuse for its refusal to close.” This is turning into a doozy of a lawsuit, and is one to keep watching. LVMH may not want to pay full price for Tiffany, but should the deal fall through there will likely be other luxury heavyweights who are keen on getting a hold of the company’s signature blue hue.

Oracle takes umbrage against ORGABLE – Tech company Oracle has filed an opposition against an application for the trademark ORGABLE. The mark, owned by Mercantilo, would cause consumer confusion and dilution of its marks, claims Oracle. The mark has been applied for in Class 42 for “online non-downloadable business management software”, which Oracle states is an area they are “one of the world’s foremost providers” in having used the ORACLE mark in relation to computer software since 1979. (JW)

McDonald’s v Hungry Jack’s could escalate further – On WTR we previously covered the burger battle in Australia, after McDonald’s filed a trademark infringement suit against restaurant chain Hungry Jack’s over its ‘Big Jack’ burger. After the lawsuit was lodged, a new TV ad from Hungry Jack’s claimed Australian consumers won’t have any issues discerning between the two products due to Hungry Jack’s burger superior ingredients and bigger size. Now, The Sydney Morning Herald reports that McDonald’s has written to Hungry Jack's objecting to the TV advertisement and ""seeking substantiation of the claim"" – the company’s barrister raising the spectre that it could add a potential claim for misleading or deceptive conduct to the trademarks infringement case.

LVMH sells more handbags in Asia - Retail Detail Europe,"Fri, 16 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldGFpbGRldGFpbC5ldS9uZXdzL2Zhc2hpb24vbHZtaC1zZWxscy1tb3JlLWhhbmRiYWdzLWFzaWHSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LVMH sold more handbags and leather goods in the third quarter, although there was still a sharp decline in the duty-free and cosmetics segments. The luxury holding company sees “encouraging signs of recovery”.

Does not compensate enough

There was renewed growth in Asia and clear recovery in the United States, sees luxury group LVMH after the end of the third quarter. The “encouraging signs of recovery” already seen by the Louis Vuitton mother in June have now been confirmed in all regions.



As a result, the world’s largest producer of luxury goods achieved comparable sales growth of 12% in its fashion and leather goods business, with the Louis Vuitton and Dior brands as its strongholds. The division generated sales of 5.9 billion euros, far outperforming the 1% decline in sales analysts expected, writes the Financial Times.



However, it was not enough to compensate for the weak sales in the duty-free, cosmetics, watches and jewellery segments. As a result, total comparable sales in the past quarter were still 7% lower than a year earlier, at 11.96 billion euros. Analysts had predicted a 10% decline.

Staying vigilant

In the first nine months of this year, LVMH’s turnover fell by 21% on a comparable basis to 30.3 billion euros, but Vuitton owner Bernard Arnault nevertheless talks about a significant improvement in the third quarter. Due to continuing uncertainty, the luxury home remains vigilant, both in terms of cost savings and investments.



The corona pandemic hit everyone in the luxury sector hard: analysts expect sales in the sector to fall by 30% this year and it will take up to three years for sales to fully recover. Precisely for this reason, much depends on the trial between LVMH and the American jeweller Tiffany, which will start on 5 January. The French want to escape the 16 billion dollar acquisition.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9994713664054871}",positive,0.9994713664054871,1

LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE boss Bernard Arnault and his ilk saw their wealth balloon more than fivefold to $443 billion between 2009 and mid-2020, fueled by Asian hunger for French-branded luxury goods and a global real-estate boom fanned by low interest rates. France is the land of what writer Pascal Bruckner calls ""Bolshevism-lite,” where wealth is publicly hated but privately hoarded.

While the COVID-19 pandemic looks like the start of an altogether less bright decade, the rich are unlikely to let this crisis go to waste.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.97496098279953}",neutral,0.97496098279953,0
How luxury watchmakers have embraced VR online boutiques during Covid-19 - Style,"Tue, 06 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjbXAuY29tL21hZ2F6aW5lcy9zdHlsZS9sdXh1cnkvYXJ0aWNsZS8zMTA0MjYwL2NhcnRpZXItcGlhZ2V0LWl3Yy1qYWVnZXItbGVjb3VsdHJlLWpvaW4tYWxpYmFiYXMtdG1hbGzSAXNodHRwczovL2FtcC5zY21wLmNvbS9tYWdhemluZXMvc3R5bGUvbHV4dXJ5L2FydGljbGUvMzEwNDI2MC9jYXJ0aWVyLXBpYWdldC1pd2MtamFlZ2VyLWxlY291bHRyZS1qb2luLWFsaWJhYmFzLXRtYWxs?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Products from the Richemont maisons, such as Cartier and Jaeger-LeCoultre, were already available on various e-commerce platforms. In 2019, Richemont and Alibaba Group formed a strategic partnership with the opening of the Net-a-Porter flagship store on Alibaba’s Tmall Luxury Pavilion . The joint venture put all Richemont-owned watch brands including Cartier, Baume & Mercier, IWC Schaffhausen, Jaeger-LeCoultre, Panerai, Piaget, Roger Dubuis as well as Vacheron Constantin and Montblanc, at the finger tips of affluent Chinese consumers.

When the world shut down early this year due to the Covid-19 pandemic, it seemed like trips to the local watch retailers – and indeed almost any shops – would be impossible. But were they?

Retailers are now taking the experiences offered by their platforms to the next level. In early May, IWC launched its first virtual reality boutique, featuring its Singapore store, enabling an immersive experience with the brand while sitting in the comfort of your own home.

“At a time when virtual connections are more frequent and accessible than physical ones, visitors can now enjoy an IWC experience outside the traditional retail infrastructure,” says Stanislas Rambaud, managing director for IWC Southeast Asia.

IWC’s foray into virtual reality was soon followed by sister brand Piaget, who launched a similar virtual boutique experience just a few weeks later. In both instances, the boutiques use vivid three-dimensional depictions of real-life IWC or Piaget stores, with different areas of the store playing host to watch or jewellery collections from the two brands. The private corner of the IWC virtual boutique contains the year’s Portugieser watch novelties, for instance, while the main atrium of the Piaget virtual store plays host to the Sunlight high jewellery collection.

Guests are able to explore the store on their own, engage with a programmed chatbot, or book a private virtual appointment with a brand representative who will take them on a tailored journey through the space. This ability to connect with a person is part of what distinguishes these virtual boutiques from other brand websites or e-commerce platforms.

Of course, this is not the watch world’s first foray into recreating a virtual retail experience for its customers. In 2018, LMVH-owned Hublot launched a new digital technology platform for its Fifth Avenue boutique in New York City that allows buyers to communicate with the brand’s salespeople without physically being in the boutique. According to the brand, the digital experience is virtually identical to an in-person visit to the store – except, perhaps, for the risk of contagion in pandemic times.

These virtual boutiques are attempting to bridge the gap between the traditional in-store experience and regular e-commerce, aiming to elevate the overall digital luxury experience to beyond being just another purchasing platform.

Despite the optimistic sentiment and the ongoing development of new technologies that improve the customer experience, not every player is joining the virtual game. The virtual boutiques all still have one major flaw – save for exceptions for very special clients, customers don’t get to see and touch the actual watch or jewellery pieces before making their purchases.

Many time-honoured names like Rolex still rely on traditional channels to sell their timepieces. Some industry insiders have also expressed reservations about the limitations of e-commerce as a whole, believing it unable to confer even a fraction of the full luxury experience afforded to in-store customers.

“Luxury shopping is not as straightforward as commodity shopping,” said Petronille de Parseval, managing director of Piaget Southeast Asia and Australia. “It is about purchasing an intimate art piece that resonates with your values and personality. Brand inspiration and experience are key. Our customers are highly connected and seek information that is not only accurate, precise and accessible but speaks to them emotionally. It is complicated to have a full brand shopping experience while browsing online.”

Not every brand is on board with the virtual game. Some, like Rolex, still rely on traditional approaches to sell watches. Photo: Rolex

Moreover, understandably, most customers have reservations about purchasing big-ticket items via e-commerce, primarily because the experience of appreciating the fine finish of a guilloche dial or the sparkle of a VVS1 D-flawless diamond in person is key to sealing the purchase deal. And that experience cannot be replaced – yet.

The development of today’s virtual reality boutiques is likely just the first step towards a truly vivid, fully immersive digital experience. Brands such as Roger Dubuis and Patek Philippe have already experimented with using augmented reality headsets to allow for deep dives into the brand’s products. For example, Patek Philippe allowed visitors to assemble a watch movement in virtual reality during its Watch Art Grand Exhibition in Singapore last year – an experience far less easily replicated in real life. If this experience could be delivered to customers on a wider scale, that would truly be impressive.

Given changing demographics that point towards younger, digitally-native clients, digital touchpoints for luxury brands have become increasingly important. A website and robust social media presence are today seen as the bare minimum – perhaps the virtual reality boutique is just the next level up.

The Covid-19 pandemic acted as catalyst and opportunity for the launch of virtual reality watch boutiques. While the industry has a long way to go in meeting the full demands of customers and delivering the very best of one-on-one service, it has laid a foundation for further innovations towards a truly virtual watch retail ecosystem.

Independent Fashion Designer Sindiso Khumalo On Sustainability And The Next Generation - ELLE UK,"Sat, 10 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVsbGUuY29tL3VrL2Zhc2hpb24vYTM0MzA5MjQzL2Zhc2hpb24tZGVzaWduZXItc2luZGlzby1raHVtYWxvL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Earlier this year, Cape Town-based fashion designer Sindiso Khumalo received the prestigious LVMH prize, which was for 2020 shared out between the eight finalists, as a measure of Covid-19 era support for emerging talent. But that's just one of the growing number of accolades Khumalo can add to her mantlepiece. In a fraught year, she's fought through to be now bestowed with a second prestigious distinction, in the form of the Green Carpet Fashion Awards' Independent Designer title.

On October 10, a re-invented for the lockdown-era GCFA ceremony took place virtually, with a film created to celebrate the themes of 'togetherness' and 'rebirth', as well as a digitally enhanced red carpet moment, with celebrities gracing the virtual runway in their finery. To celebrate the moment, and the occasion of her award, we caught up with winner Khumalo to discuss her brand, the future and all things sustainability.

What does sustainability mean to you in 2020?

My interests in sustainability lie mainly in socio-economic impact of our businesses, and poverty alleviation. It is often the poorest communities in the world that are also the most polluted. Whether it's groundwater contamination, living in proximity to busy roads and highways, and sewage issues.

So I believe that by addressing issues of poverty, you are invariably also addressing environmental issues. I feel the social and environmental sides of the sustainability conversation are inextricably linked, and as designers we need to try and address both where we can.



How has your concept of sustainability evolved over time?

In many ways, I have always been interested in sustainability, but it was only when I had children six years ago that I actually began to ask the right questions.

Questions like: 'Where does my waste go?'; 'What is the impact of this fabric?'; 'Who made my clothes?'. I think considering what we intend to leave to the next generation is very much at the core of what we try to do as a business. Looking at both the social and environmental impact of the clothes we make.

Your most recent collection is based on Harriet Tubman, how do you feel sustainable clothes can be political?

I think taking a stand on anything is a political statement. One cannot help but be political in a time when the President of the free world won’t denounce white supremacists in a presidential debate. We have to be political, because there is so much to fight for, and especially with sustainability, our planet depends it.

Why do we need to support more independent brands in the fashion landscape?

With independent brands come new ways of thinking, and usually new methods of shaking up the industry. I think supporting independent brands is also about supporting new and diverse voices in the fashion industry. And this is so important. I don’t go shopping for clothes anymore, but when I do, it's either vintage or a great independent brand that speaks to me. You vote with your dollars.

What does it mean to you to win this GCFA award?

It means so much! Of course I am gutted I won’t be able to receive it in person. The GCFA is such a beautiful ceremony in the most magical setting in Milan. But I am hugely grateful to be recognised in this way. But with all recognition, comes responsibility, and I just want to grow and grow the work we do in getting women out of abject poverty into fair, ethical work.

LVMH and Tiffany & Co strike new terms for acquisition - The Moodie Davitt Report,"Thu, 29 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vbW9vZGllZGF2aXR0cmVwb3J0LmNvbS9sdm1oLWFuZC10aWZmYW55LWNvLXN0cmlrZS1uZXctdGVybXMtZm9yLWFjcXVpc2l0aW9uL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"FRANCE/US. LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton and Tiffany & Co have have struck an updated agreement that will allow the acquisition of the US jeweller to proceed.

The new deal reflects a lower price of US$131.50 per share in cash, or a valuation of around US$15.8 billion. The original acquisition valued Tiffany & Co at US$135 per share in cash.

Both parties have also agreed to settle their pending lawsuits at the Delaware Chancery Court. The Board of Directors of both LVMH and Tiffany & Co have agreed the terms, with all regulatory approvals already obtained.

The adapted Merger Agreement states that the regularly scheduled Tiffany quarterly dividend of US$0.58 per share — due to be declared on 19 November 2020 — will be declared and paid. The acquisition is expected to close in early 2021, subject to Tiffany shareholder approval and customary closing conditions.

LVMH President and CEO Bernard Arnault said, “This balanced agreement with Tiffany’s Board allows LVMH to work on the Tiffany acquisition with confidence and resume discussions with Tiffany’s management on the integration details. We are as convinced as ever of the formidable potential of the Tiffany brand and believe that LVMH is the right home for Tiffany and its employees during this exciting next chapter.”

“We are very pleased to have reached an agreement with LVMH at an attractive price and to now be able to proceed with the merger,” commented Tiffany & Co Chairman of the Board of Directors Roger N. Farah. “The Board concluded it was in the best interests of all of our stakeholders to achieve certainty of closing.”

Tiffany & Co CEO Alessandro Bogliolo added, “We continue to believe in the power and value of the Tiffany brand and the compelling long-term strategic and financial benefits of this combination.”

As reported, LVMH announced in September that was no longer completing the acquisition of Tiffany & Co, due to complications surrounding the deal. This included a warning by the French European and Foreign Affairs minister related to the threat of taxes on French products by the US.

As a result, the US jewellery firm filed a lawsuit in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, seeking an order which would require LVMH to abide by its contractual obligation to complete the transaction on the agreed terms. LVMH also filed a counter-lawsuit in response to Tiffany & Co’s litigation.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9996969699859619}",neutral,0.9996969699859619,0
Givenchy Drops $25M For Early Exit At Madison Avenue Flagship - Bisnow,"Wed, 28 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJpc25vdy5jb20vbmV3LXlvcmsvbmV3cy9yZXRhaWwvZ2l2ZW5jaHktZHJvcHMtbWlsbGlvbnMtdG8td3JpZ2dsZS1vdXQtb2YtbWFkaXNvbi1hdmUtc3BhY2UtMTA2NTA00gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"747 Madison Ave.

Givenchy is leaving its ritzy retail location on Madison Avenue seven years early, paying millions for the right to do so.

LVMH, Givenchy’s parent, is paying $24.5M to landlord Wharton Properties to be able to terminate its lease at 747 Madison Ave. in 2022, despite it being set to expire in 2029, Commercial Observer reports, citing Tel Aviv Stock Exchange documents.

The $24.5M figure included a $15M fee for rescinding the original contract plus $9.5M prepaid rent up until March 2022. From then, LVMH is free to leave with 60 days notice, and the landlord in turn can terminate its lease with the same amount of notice. The lender on the property, JPMorgan Chase, agreed to the terms, and the store is expected to keep running until March 2022.

It is yet another development that points to a rapidly shifting retail landscape in the city. Direct ground-floor retail availability hit a new high of 254 spaces across the 16 prime retail corridors in Manhattan, according to a CBRE retail report released this month. Asking rent hit dropped 13% year-over-year to $659 per SF in the third quarter.

The uncertain outlook at falling rents is starting to make its mark on values. Akris, a Swiss clothing retailer, paid $45M for three retail properties on Madison Avenue this month, The Wall Street Journal reported, marking an 80% drop from the peak of the market in 2014.

LVMH is exiting the property as talks have resumed in its $16B takeover attempt of Tiffany's, with the French conglomerate expected to get a $425M discount to its original takeover agreement, Bloomberg reports.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999476671218872}",neutral,0.9999476671218872,0

PARIS : French luxury giant LVMH said comparable sales fell 7% in the third quarter, beating analyst forecasts, as its fashion and leather goods division managed to contain the fallout from the coronavirus crisis to swing back into positive territory.The luxury sector was hit hard by the pandemic which forced brands to temporarily shut stores across the globe and severely disrupted international tourism.But LVMH, which is embroiled in a legal dispute over its planned acquisition of U.S. jeweller Tiffany , has proved more resilient than some of its smaller peers, and its shares are only down 3% since the beginning of the year.Its star fashion and leather goods labels, Louis Vuitton and Dior, have outperformed most rivals, and the whole division saw sales grow by 12% in the three months to September on a like-for-like basis, which strips out the impact of foreign exchange and acquisitions.Comparable sales of wines and spirits were down 3% over the period, while perfume and cosmetics dropped 16%, watches and jewellery fell 14%, and the retailing division - the most exposed to travel flows - plunged 29%.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.7076001763343811}",positive,0.7076001763343811,1

Leading luxury goods group LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton today revealed its nine-month revenue figures, with revenue of €30.3 billion down by -21% year-on-year but with a sharp improvement in Q3, when organic revenue fell by just -7%.

The group noted: “Since the start of the year, LVMH has demonstrated good resilience in an economic environment severely disrupted by the serious health crisis that led to the suspension of international travel and the closure of the group’s stores and manufacturing sites in most countries over a period of several months.”

Q3 revenue showed a return to growth in the Cognac and Fashion & Leather Goods divisions, with marked growth in the US and Asia.

In Selective Retailing, which includes DFS Group (owned by LVMH and original Co-Founder Robert Miller) and Starboard Cruise Services, organic revenue declined -31% in the first nine months.

LVMH said: “DFS saw a significant decline in its activity in most destinations as a result of the suspension of international travel, which is showing no signs of improving.”

The Wines & Spirits business group saw organic revenue decline by -15% over the first nine months of 2020 and by -3% in the third quarter. After a significant drop in volumes in the second quarter, the Champagne business saw an improvement in Q3 in all regions.

Hennessy Cognac recorded a strong recovery in the third quarter, driven by VS ranges and consumer demand in the US. The Château d’Esclans and Château du Galoupet acquisitions, made in 2019, were integrated in 2020 and buoying Moët Hennessy in the growing market for high-end rosé wines. A new high-end rum, Eminente, launched in the third quarter.

The Fashion & Leather Goods business group posted a -11% organic revenue decline in an environment marked by the closure of stores for several months. The third quarter saw a strong rebound in activity, with double-digit organic revenue growth, led by Louis Vuitton but with strong momentum too from Christian Dior. Other fashion brands also saw a good improvement in the third quarter, notably Fendi, Loewe and Celine.

The Perfumes & Cosmetics business group recorded a -25% decline in organic revenue in the first nine months. “The major brands are showing good resistance in a sector marked by a fall in both makeup demand and purchases made by international travellers, partially offset by the development in skincare. Online sales grew steadily in the third quarter and there was a significant improvement in trends in stores as well.”

The Watches & Jewelry business group saw organic revenue decline by -30% year-on-year. The rebound in China was observed in the third quarter but did not prevent the overall activity from dropping by -14% in the period.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9999998807907104}",positive,0.9999998807907104,1
People Are Starting to Spend Money on Luxury Products Again - InsideHook,"Fri, 16 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmluc2lkZWhvb2suY29tL2N1bHR1cmUvcGVvcGxlLWJ1eWluZy1sdXh1cnktcHJvZHVjdHMtYWdhaW7SAUpodHRwczovL3d3dy5pbnNpZGVob29rLmNvbS9jdWx0dXJlL3Blb3BsZS1idXlpbmctbHV4dXJ5LXByb2R1Y3RzLWFnYWluP2FtcA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"After tightening purse strings in the early days of the pandemic, people are finally starting to feel comfortable dropping cash on pricey purchases again, and they’re not just maxing out their credit cards stocking up on toilet paper. Luxury goods sales are on the rise, and according to CNN, that’s good news.



On Thursday, luxury goods conglomerate LVMH — which houses high-end brands like Louis Vuitton, Fendi and Dior — reported solid earnings and a return to growth in its fashion and leather goods division last quarter, with revenue rising 12 percent compared to the same period last year. Jeweler Tiffany and Co. — which LVMH was previously set to acquire in a deal that ultimately unraveled amid the pandemic — also reported “extremely strong” sales, with positive trends continuing in October.



The rising sales in high-end leather goods and jewelry are good news for the global economy, suggesting consumers are getting more comfortable spending money on large, luxury purchases again. However, CNN noted there are still obstacles ahead. While sales in China have rebounded, they can’t sustain the entire business, and while both LVMH and Tiffany said activity in the United States was improving, consumer spending is still lagging behind where it was in January.



LVMH Chief Financial Officer Jean Jacques Guiony also noted that international tourism — which tends to drive luxury goods sales — is expected to remain muted amid the ongoing pandemic. On a conference call, Guiony reportedly told analysts he was “not particularly hopeful that we’ll see a lot of tourist inflows” before a COVID-19 vaccine is available.

On a Q3 revenue results call held today by LVMH, Chris Hollis, Director of Financial Communications and Head of Investor Relations, said that international travel restrictions continued to ‘deeply impact’ the travel retail sector and while the group as a whole observed gains in Q3, travel retail revenue has been ‘fairly consistently down’ since the initial outbreak of Covid-19.

Hollis said that improvements in fashion & leathergoods and the wines & spirits divisions were strongest; down just 11% and 15% respectively.

“In a very turbulent context, marked by continuing economic and health uncertainties, LVMH will continue to exercise caution, strengthen its cost controls and selectivity in its investments,” said LVMH.

“The Group will maintain a strategy focused on preserving the value of its brands, by continuing its marketing and communication investments and relying on the exceptional quality of its products and the reactivity of its organisation. LVMH will rely on the power of its brands and the talent of its teams to further extend its global leadership in the luxury market in 2020.

The decision to pay an interim dividend will be discussed by the Board of Directors before the end of the month and announced thereafter.

‘GOOD RESILIENCE’ FROM SEPHORA

Sephora demonstrated good resilience during the health crisis, despite the fact that it had to close almost all its stores globally for nearly two months. Revenue improved in the third quarter and Sephora gained market share where the brand already has a strong presence, thanks in particular to strong online sales growth. “Supported by an innovative and varied offer, momentum within skincare products was strong,” added LVMH.

For the group overall, revenue was down 7% in the third quarter on an organic basis, reflecting a marked improvement in trends compared to the first half, notably a return to growth in Cognac and fashion & leathergoods.

The encouraging signs of recovery observed in June for several of the Group’s activities were confirmed in the third quarter in all regions, notably in the United States, and in Asia, which once again grew over the period.

The wines & spirits business group saw its organic revenue decline by 15% over the first nine months of 2020 and by 3% in the third quarter. After a significant drop in volumes in the second quarter, the Champagne business saw an improvement in the third quarter in all regions.

Hennessy Cognac recorded a strong recovery in the third quarter, driven by VS ranges in the context of ‘exceptional stimulus support for consumer demand in the United States’, said LVMH. “The Château d’Esclans and Château du Galoupet acquisitions, made in 2019, were integrated in 2020 for the first time, establishing a strong position for Moët Hennessy in the growing market for high-end rosé wines.” A new high-end rum, Eminente, launched in the third quarter.

The fashion & leathergoods business group saw its organic revenue decline by 11% over the first nine months of 2020 in an environment marked by the closure of stores for several months.

The third quarter saw a strong rebound in activity, with double-digit organic revenue growth. Louis Vuitton continued to display ‘exceptional momentum and creativity’, in all areas, from products to shows and customer events. During Fashion Week, the new collections were presented in an original format in the legendary renovated La Samaritaine building in Paris – currently not trading as a DFS Galleria as it was due to – as well as in Shanghai and Tokyo. In addition, Louis Vuitton opened a new workshop in France.

The perfumes & cosmetics business group recorded a 25% decline in organic revenue in the first nine months of 2020. The so-called ‘major brands’ are showing good resistance in a sector marked by a fall in both makeup demand and purchases made by international travellers, said LVMH, partially offset by the development in skincare.

Online sales grew steadily in the third quarter and there was a significant improvement in trends in stores as well. Parfums Christian Dior launched its new fragrance J’adore Eau de Parfum Infinissime and continues to develop Prestige and Capture skincare products. According to LVMH, Guerlain recorded ‘remarkable growth’ in skincare with the continued successes of Abeille Royale and Orchidée Impériale. The new skincare brand Fenty Skin, developed by Rihanna, is off to ‘a very promising start’.

The watches & jewellery business group saw its organic revenue decline by 30% in the first nine months of 2020. The rebound in China was observed in the third quarter, but did not prevent the overall activity from dropping by 14% in the period. Bvlgari unveiled a new line of Barocko fine jewellery.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9387033581733704}",positive,0.9387033581733704,1

Europe’s richest person’s net worth soars on luxury rebound - The Indian Express,"Sat, 17 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigQFodHRwczovL2luZGlhbmV4cHJlc3MuY29tL2FydGljbGUvYnVzaW5lc3MvZXVyb3Blcy1yaWNoZXN0LXBlcnNvbi1iZXJuYXJkLWFybm91bHQtbmV0LXdvcnRoLXNvYXJzLW9uLWx1eHVyeS1yZWJvdW5kLWx2bWgtNjc1ODU3NS_SAYYBaHR0cHM6Ly9pbmRpYW5leHByZXNzLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL2J1c2luZXNzL2V1cm9wZXMtcmljaGVzdC1wZXJzb24tYmVybmFyZC1hcm5vdWx0LW5ldC13b3J0aC1zb2Fycy1vbi1sdXh1cnktcmVib3VuZC1sdm1oLTY3NTg1NzUvbGl0ZS8?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"French luxury-goods tycoon Bernard Arnault is staging a comeback on the world’s wealth rankings.

Arnault’s net worth jumped by $8.3 billion this week after his conglomerate LVMH posted unexpectedly strong third-quarter results on the back of eager-to-splurge consumers.

The gain puts Arnault, 71, within striking distance of becoming the world’s fifth centibillionaire, behind Jeff Bezos, Bill Gates, Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.

Arnault’s net worth hasn’t exceeded $100 billion since January, when his fortune reached a record high of $109.4 billion. The outbreak of Covid-19 and the subsequent economic fallout wiped out almost 50% of his wealth over the next two months as lockdowns shuttered storefronts and luxury spending nosedived.

Friday’s LVMH results showcased the strength of its brands, which include Louis Vuitton, Moet & Chandon champagne and Givenchy, to selective consumers despite an uncertain economy. Founder Arnault’s net worth has tracked mostly upwards over the past month despite the uncertainty looming over its $16 billion purchase of jeweler Tiffany & Co.

LVMH abruptly announced last month that the French government requested it delay the deal due to trade issues with the U.S. The two luxury giants are now suing each other, with Tiffany saying LVMH’s rationale for backing out is baseless and misleading and LVMH claiming the decision was driven by the government and Tiffany’s own mismanagement. Both companies reject the allegations.

Even with his recent gains, Arnault’s net worth is down by $8.7 billion so far this year, the fifth-biggest loss on the Bloomberg index, which tracks the world’s 500 wealthiest people. Overall it’s been a banner year for gains for the world’s richest people. The combined fortunes of the individuals on the ranking have risen by $986 billion, or 16.8%, year-to-date","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.6389176249504089}",positive,0.6389176249504089,1
LVMH revives biggest luxury deal by settling Tiffany dispute - Gulf Business,"Thu, 29 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vZ3VsZmJ1c2luZXNzLmNvbS9sdm1oLXJldml2ZXMtYmlnZ2VzdC1sdXh1cnktZGVhbC1ieS1zZXR0bGluZy10aWZmYW55LWRpc3B1dGUv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LVMH agreed to buy Tiffany & Co. at a slightly reduced price of almost $16bn, preserving the luxury industry’s biggest takeover and avoiding a courtroom battle over an earlier deal that soured.

The compromise ends a yearlong saga characterized by accusations of bad faith, French government intervention and lawsuits. Both sides were due to meet in a Delaware court in January, after the Louis Vuitton owner walked away from their original agreement and Tiffany sued to keep it on track.

Adding Tiffany at a lower price reinforces LVMH Chairman Bernard Arnault’s image as a hard-nosed bargainer, even though the savings – roughly $425m – are a small fraction of his company’s $240bn market value. The deal gives LVMH a major boost in the global jewelry market, adding a famous brand that can compete with Richemont’s Cartier.

Under the new accord, the French owner of brands like Dior fashions and Hennessy cognac will pay $131.50 a share, down from the original price of $135, according to a statement Thursday.

LVMH rose as much as 0.6 per cent in Paris. Tiffany traded at $130.50 in pre-market US trading Thursday.

Pandemic effect

The reduction in the price follows Tiffany’s payment of dividends and management bonuses that angered LVMH. The payouts were made after the companies struck their first agreement in late 2019 and as the Covid-19 pandemic caused a slump in luxury sales.

Under the modified terms, Tiffany will pay its regular dividend of 58 cents per share in November, the companies said. That’s a win for Tiffany on a “point of principle,” said Luca Solca, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein.

The new price is a reduction of only 2.6 per cent from the original deal. Without a new agreement, analysts surveyed by Bloomberg saw the jeweler’s shares falling far more – to around $108, on average.

“The relatively modest discount agreed seems to confirm the strength of Tiffany’s negotiating position,” Solca said.

The new accord was fueled by improving results at both companies. Some normalcy has returned to major luxury markets such as China, even as new coronavirus lockdowns spread across Europe.

Later closing

The new agreement is expected to close in early 2021. The original closing date was November 24. The companies agreed to set aside their lawsuits.

Tiffany and LVMH executives were all smiles last year when the jeweler hosted Arnault at its New York flagship. France’s wealthiest man spoke of the jeweler as an American icon and expressed his “intense respect and admiration” for the 183-year-old business.

Their relationship soon soured as the pandemic halted tourism, shut down stores and stifled luxury spending. In September, LVMH said it couldn’t go through with the deal, citing a request from the French government amid a trade dispute with the US.

If it had gone to court, LVMH risked the airing of dirty laundry, including its engagement with French officials as the original deal frayed. Arnault solicited a letter from Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian in which he asked the company to delay the purchase, Bloomberg reported in September.

A Delaware judge last month urged both sides to talk and reach an agreement. At first, the companies were reluctant to return to the negotiating table, but they changed their tune as the November deadline for the original transaction approached.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.999727189540863}",neutral,0.999727189540863,0

Speculation around Rihanna’s rumored partnership with luxury fashion conglomerate LVMH has taunted fans since early January. Finally, an official announcement confirming the forthcoming venture was confirmed earlier this month.

Women are forces of this earth. We are multifaceted, complex, vulnerable yet bulletproof.

Today only fueled that excitement after Rih dropped the official campaign video and T Magazine teased a new cover story showing the singer modeling apparel and accessories from her debut line set to drop this week.

Rihanna’s fearless spirit and attitude are infused throughout all of the brand’s offerings, which range from ready-to-wear and footwear to jewelry and eyewear.

“Women are forces of this earth. We are multifaceted, complex, vulnerable yet bulletproof, and FENTY speaks to all of our intricacies. Some days I want to be submissive, many days I’m completely in charge and most days I feel like being both. It was imperative that we created a line versatile enough to embrace and celebrate us in that way.”

We’re not the only ones anticipating the debut of FENTY. Rihanna also shares our excitement. “I’m just hyped to see people in my clothes,” she added.

Just like Rihanna, FENTY will be breaking a few rules. Instead of operating on a traditional seasonal fashion schedule, it will retail via multiple incremental releases on a “See-Now-Wear-Now” model.

The romantic dualism by Nensi Dojaka - nssgclub.com,"Wed, 28 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5zc2djbHViLmNvbS9lbi9mYXNoaW9uLzI0MDIwL25lbnNpLWRvamFrYS1kZXNpZ25lci1sdm1oLTIwMjHSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"In 2019 Nensi Dojaka completed her MA at Central Saint Martins in London. For the occasion the designer showed her Spring-Summer 2020 graduate collection on the catwalk during the LFW, thus entering the fashion radar of stylists, editors and most avid addicts. To date, Nensi is among the most interesting emerging designers in the creative landscape - thanks to her ultra-feminine aesthetic and her sense of deconstruction - so that she has just received the LVMH Prize 2021.

Free femininity

Nensi Dojaka, twenty-seven years old and Albanian origin, began to shape her label among the desks of the London College of Fashion, to then define it during her MA at Central Sain Martins. Her style focuses on a strong conceptualization of the female universe which finds its roots the freedom of image. According to the Dojaka woman, femininity and sensuality lies in showing yourself as you want to be seen. And in fact, in that first lookbook, Nensi had invited the models to document their outfits on their iPhone, so they could appropriate their own image and choose for themselves.

The transparencies of the garments and the bodies of the models are not conceived to communicate sexuality, but instead they represent a new power, unleashed and bold, with deep contrasts, and that explores the many facets of femininity and what it represents to people, independently from the brand itself. There is therefore no single definition, or categorization, of what femininity is, and rather it remains versatile, multiform, patchwork, like Nensi Dojaka clothes.

Cutting-edge aesthetics

Recently Nensi has been presented among the Fashion East 2020 emerging talents for the autumn-winter collection, where once again she strikes through her enveloping silhouettes with reasoned and complex architectures, elevated through the layers of veiled silks and the contrasts between sharp lines and softer details. A taste of the 90s but also very now, which mixes raw and deep elements with the inspirations of today's world. Her looks are impalpable but structured, light as a butterfly and tinted with punk tones. The contrast is an integral part of the garments. The woman is self-confident, but there is a vulnerability, a fragility which sets off the weight of gravity. And the play of veiling, between the overlapping layers enriches the dress, contrasting with the purity of lines, materials, and the naked skin. Avant-guard is the Nensi Dojaka aesthetic, in its extreme simplicity and never taken for granted. The designer is inspired by the great names of the nineties fashion scenario, like Helmut Lang, Ann Demeulemeester, and Alessandro Dell'acqua, with their poetic and subversive elements, to create a constant duality of the product.

Nensi Dojaka's clothes are the result of careful construction that focuses on the quality of the materials. They communicate honesty and want to propose an alternative to the usual clothes. The buyer is a strong woman who is not afraid to look different, or to break the mould of a beautiful dress. Nensi herself claims to love mixing fabrics: the stretch georgette with the finest jersey and tailored fabrics. A perfect mix of attention to detail, quality, but also irony, which make the designer more relevant to the eyes of the entire fashion industry.

Through her clothes, the designer conquered everyone and immediately gained partnerships with luxury retailers SSENSE, as well as the endorsement of celebrities like Bella Hadid.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.999974250793457}",neutral,0.999974250793457,0

The glittering tie-up was originally unveiled at the end of 2019, when LVMH — which owns luxury brands such as Louis Vuitton, Dior and Moet & Chandon — said it would take over the jeweller for $135 per share.

However, the deal quickly lost its shine and broke down in acrimony, and LVHM walked away from its proposal last month pointing to what it described as a series of poor decisions by Tiffany’s board since the purchase was announced.

Tiffany dismissed the charges and said there was no valid basis to call off the deal.

It lodged a complaint in a Delaware court and LVMH responded with a counter-claim.

The US court has set a trial date of January 5, 2021, while a judge has called for talks between the parties to avoid litigation.

On Thursday, the nuptials were back on after Tiffany agreed to accept a lower price from LVMH, the French group announced.

“LVMH, the world’s leading luxury products group, and Tiffany, the global luxury jeweller, today announced that they have concluded an agreement modifying certain terms of their initial agreement to reflect a purchase price of $131.50 (per share) in cash and to reduce closing conditionality,” the statement said.

“Other key terms of the merger agreement remain unchanged.”

– ‘Formidable potential’ –

At the revised share price, the deal is worth around $15.77 billion, down from $16.2 billion initially.

“This balanced agreement with Tiffany’s board allows LVMH to work on the Tiffany acquisition with confidence and resume discussions with Tiffany’s management on the integration details,” said LVMH chief executive Bernard Arnault.

“We are as convinced as ever of the formidable potential of the Tiffany brand and believe that LVMH is the right home for Tiffany and its employees during this exciting next chapter.”

Tiffany’s board chairman Roger Farah said: “We are very pleased to have reached an agreement with LVMH at an attractive price and to now be able to proceed with the merger. The board concluded it was in the best interests of all of our stakeholders to achieve certainty of closing.”

The different competition authorities involved, such as the European Commission in Brussels, have already given the deal their blessing, so it is expected to be finalised in January.

“It remains a very attractive acquisition, even if the coronavirus pandemic has robbed it of some of its sparkle,” said Arnaud Cadart, asset manager at Flornoy.

“Tiffany, currently in full lockdown, has a strong pair of shoulders to lean on in LVMH with its long-term perspective.” (AFP)","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9983225464820862}",neutral,0.9983225464820862,0

LVMH noted a “significant improvement” as fashion and leather limited a fall in revenue to seven per cent on an organic basis after the virus had wreaked havoc in the first half of the year.

Sales came in at almost €12 billion for the quarter, above expectations of between €11.7 and €11.4 billion.

The world’s leading luxury products group said it recorded revenue of €30.3bn for January-September, down 21%

“Since the start of the year, LVMH has demonstrated good resilience in an economic environment severely disrupted by the serious health crisis that led to the suspension of international travel and the closure of the group’s stores and manufacturing sites in most countries over a period of several months,” the company said in a statement.

“The encouraging signs of recovery observed in June for several of the group’s activities were confirmed in the third quarter in all regions, notably in the United States, and in Asia, which once again grew over the period.”

Hermes Accuses Heir of Lying About Shares During LVMH Battle - BNN Bloomberg,"Wed, 28 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJubmJsb29tYmVyZy5jYS9oZXJtZXMtYWNjdXNlcy1oZWlyLW9mLWx5aW5nLWFib3V0LXNoYXJlcy1kdXJpbmctbHZtaC1iYXR0bGUtMS4xNTE0MDE20gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"(Bloomberg) -- French authorities are looking into whether a Hermes International heir lied about selling some of his shares during a rival’s attempt to build a stake in the maker of $10,000 Birkin handbags.

The probe into Nicolas Puech’s claim he still owned nearly 6% of Hermes half a decade ago was sparked by tension in the family after LVMH’s 2010 surprise stakebuilding. The case, which focused on the role of Puech’s wealth manager, Eric Freymond, was secret until its disclosure this month by France’s top court.

After messy legal battles against the Hermes founding family, LVMH boss Bernard Arnault started to unwind the 23% stake in 2014. The family then turned on itself, and Hermes International lodged the criminal complaint. Hermes told French investigators Puech, a great-great-grandson of the founder of the 183-year-old company, made a false statement to the luxury firm about his shareholding.

The investigation, which is nearing completion, is looking into the suspicions of French authorities that Freymond played a role in the 77-year-old Puech’s share disclosures for 2013 and 2014. According to the top court ruling detailing parts of the case, investigators suspect that the wealth manager acted “in an intentionally deceitful manner” and provided false data that led to the sworn statements.

The probe came to light in a ruling by France’s top court that threw out some evidence against Freymond. His attorney said the decision may upset the probe.

‘Surprised’

François Besse, a lawyer for Puech, said his client was “surprised” by the Hermes complaint and hasn’t been charged. The share statement, “which Mr. Puech had no legal obligation to sign, was not signed lightly but after verification with his bankers of the exact number of Hermes shares he held,” Besse said.

François Zimeray, an attorney for Freymond, described the case as “poorly extinguished embers of an old fire” and said his client “fully contests” the allegations. Paris prosecutors said that the probe is ongoing.

Hermes declined to comment beyond noting that it no longer breaks out Puech’s holding since it published its 2016 annual report. LVMH declined to comment, saying it isn’t a party to the investigation.

According to the top court ruling, French investigators’ checks found that Puech hadn’t owned nearly 6% of Hermes shares since 2012, and they say his claim made the firm provide inexact information about its share allocation and floating capital. Hermes also alleges Puech failed to stick to a legal obligation to publicly state that his shareholding had gone below 5%.

$6 Billion

Besse dismissed the allegations, saying his client’s 5.8% stake was unchanged.

“Mr. Puech still owns, among other securities, these 6,082,615 Hermes shares, which he has always managed alone,” the lawyer said. He added that Puech didn’t sell shares to LVMH.

Since the end of 2015, Puech stopped disclosing his exact Hermes holding, which would now be worth about $6 billion if he still has the 5.8% stake. The family is among the world’s richest with a fortune of more than $60 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.

The luxury firm has pretty much always been a family affair. Axel Dumas, a member of the sixth generation, has been at the helm for half a dozen years. Puech and his brother Bertrand, who led the counter-attack to fend off LVMH, are the grandsons of Emile Hermes, who transitioned the saddlemaker into luxury bags. Nicolas’s cousin, Jean-Louis Dumas, led Hermes from 1978 until his retirement in 2006.

Although the court case has been secret, the rift caused within the Hermes family by LVMH’s disclosure of its stakebuilding on Oct. 23, 2010, is well-known.

Puech has been seen as a rebel ever since he became the only relative not to put any shares into a new holding company set up in 2011 to prevent LVMH from wresting control. He said at the time that he thought the move would deprive them of the power to individually influence the firm’s management.

Court Ruling

The French top court got involved when Freymond challenged the evidence used by investigators.

The wealth manager won an argument about documents provided by a Swiss stock-market regulator in a related case that was closed four years ago without charges. The Cour de Cassation said the evidence shouldn’t have been used as the purposes of the two probes were different. The current one focuses on forgery allegations, while the other targeted possible market abuses.

While it’s unclear how central to the case the disputed evidence is and what impact Freymond’s court victory will have on the investigation, Zimeray says the ruling “will further weaken an already fragile complaint.” Additionally, a new investigative judge, who may have different views on the case, is now in charge after the previous one left her position several months ago.

NEW YORK--U.S. jeweler Tiffany & Co and French luxury goods giant LVMH are in talks to settle their dispute over a $16 billion takeover at a price slightly lower than that initially agreed, sources familiar with the matter said on Tuesday.



The negotiations were based on a price in the range of $131-$134 for each Tiffany share, against the $135 price when the deal was first agreed last November. An agreement at the bottom of that range would save LVMH, led by billionaire businessman Bernard Arnault, about $480 million on the initial $16.2 billion purchase price.

The initial deal ran into trouble last month when the French group said it could no longer complete the transaction by the Nov. 24 deadline. It cited a French political intervention preventing it from doing so, but also what it described as the jeweller's ""dismal"" performance during the coronavirus crisis.

The two sides are facing off in a Delaware court, with Tiffany seeking to force LVMH to honour the deal. The case is due to be heard in early January.

CNBC earlier reported that the two parties were in indirect talks to settle the dispute. Both LVMH and Tiffany did not immediately respond to Reuters requests for comment.

Tiffany shares rose almost 5% to $128.78 on Tuesday after reports of a potential end to the dispute.

Louis Vuitton owner LVMH agreed last year to buy Tiffany in its biggest acquisition yet, betting it could restore the U.S. jeweller's lustre by investing in stores and new collections. The deal was designed to boost LVMH's smallest business, the jewellery and watch division that is already home to Bulgari and Tag Heuer, help it to expand in one of the fastest-growing industry sections and strengthen its U.S. presence.

New York-based Tiffany, founded in 1837 and known for its signature pale blue boxes, retains a resonance as the go-to purveyor of engagement rings that only a handful of rivals can match.

Tiffany also said on Monday that it had received the nod from the European Commission for the deal's completion, thus clearing all regulatory hurdles.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9998883008956909}",neutral,0.9998883008956909,0
French luxury goods giant LVMH secures deal for US jeweller Tiffany - Jersey Evening Post,"Thu, 29 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5qZXJzZXlldmVuaW5ncG9zdC5jb20vbW9yZW5ld3Mvd29ybGRuZXdzLzIwMjAvMTAvMjkvZnJlbmNoLWx1eHVyeS1nb29kcy1naWFudC1sdm1oLXNlY3VyZXMtZGVhbC1mb3ItdXMtamV3ZWxsZXItdGlmZmFueS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The largest deal in luxury is back on after New York jeweller Tiffany agreed to a slightly reduced offer from Paris-based LVMH.

LVMH will now pay 131.50 dollars (£100) for each Tiffany share, putting the total price tag at 15.8 billion dollars (£12.02bn), down from the 16.2 billion (£12.33) that was first offered earlier this year.

The owner of Louis Vuitton, Christian Dior and Fendi, along with a series of wine and champagne brands, appeared to walk away from the acquisition last month after it said the French government had pushed for a delay because of the threat of proposed US tariffs.

Rumours that the two luxury companies had rekindled talks began to surface in recent days.

“We are as convinced as ever of the formidable potential of the Tiffany brand and believe that LVMH is the right home for Tiffany,” LVMH CEO Bernard Arnault said in a statement on Thursday.

Tiffany, with its famed blue boxes, has in recent years attempted to regain the lustre of the “Breakfast At Tiffany’s” era as its customer base aged.

It has shifted its focus to younger shoppers and made a significant push online. The deep pockets of LVMH could go a long way in helping that transformation along.

LVMH, led by billionaire Mr Arnault, believes Tiffany will strengthen its position in high-end jewellery and in the US market.

LVMH is also making a bet on China’s economy, where Tiffany has been expanding.

The buyout has been approved by the boards of both companies and is expected to be completed early next year.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9956377148628235}",neutral,0.9956377148628235,0
Luxury retailer Chalhoub Group to re-organise as pandemic accelerates e-commerce push - The National,"Tue, 27 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiAFodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGVuYXRpb25hbG5ld3MuY29tL2J1c2luZXNzL2x1eHVyeS1yZXRhaWxlci1jaGFsaG91Yi1ncm91cC10by1yZS1vcmdhbmlzZS1hcy1wYW5kZW1pYy1hY2NlbGVyYXRlcy1lLWNvbW1lcmNlLXB1c2gtMS4xMTAwNDEw0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Dubai-based luxury retailer Chalhoub Group said it is re-organising and appointing two new senior executives as the Covid-19 pandemic accelerates its digital and e-commerce drive.

The company will be structured into four verticals of managed companies: JV and strategy; growth, innovation and investment; operations and enablers; and people and culture, Chalhoub Group said in a statement on Tuesday.

""I am confident that the new organisation will enable us to unleash all the potential and energy of our people,"" Patrick Chalhoub, chief executive of the Chalhoub Group, said. ""This structure will allow us to drive growth and sustainability, be innovative and creative, foster synergies, cooperation and drive efficiency, have more ownership and accountability for our initiatives.”

The global luxury goods market is expected to contract between 20 to 35 per cent in 2020, driven by pandemic-triggered lockdowns and a slump in tourism, according to a May report by consultancy Bain and Company. The pandemic forced LVMH, the world's largest luxury company, to abandon its $16.2 billion buyout of Tiffany. Both companies are now engaged in a legal battle in the US.

The Chalhoub Group represents LVMH in the Middle East in addition to more than 300 brands that include such as Sephora, Tod's, Michael Kors, L’Occitane, Lacoste, Tory Burch.

The company, which has more than 750 retail outlets across the region, said it will further develop and create its own brands, concepts and products and sharpen its focus on the Saudi Arabia market.

The luxury retailer appointed David Vercruysse, a former manager at the company, to lead the new managed companies vertical, which entails beauty and fashion distribution, franchise businesses and the group's own concepts such as Level Shoes. Mr Vercruysse will re-join the company on December 1.

Michael Chalhoub - whose experience spans corporate finance, strategic consulting and launching and developing businesses - will lead strategy, growth, innovation and investment as well as overlook the joint venture businesses.

In June, Mr Chalhoub told The National that the company is cutting costs and preserving cash as it restructures its business to cope with the Covid-19 pandemic that has hit sales. However, it will press on with its e-commerce strategy and expects a full recovery by 2022, its chief executive said at the time.

The company cited its market research that showed about 30 per cent of Gulf consumers bought luxury items from a website for the first time. Customers have ""raised the level of expectations on-line and in the stores ... preferences have evolved with more appetite for casualwear, skincare and wellness,"" the company said.

“I am convinced that the future is full of opportunities for our group,"" Mr Chalhoub said in the statement.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.6427179574966431}",neutral,0.6427179574966431,0
