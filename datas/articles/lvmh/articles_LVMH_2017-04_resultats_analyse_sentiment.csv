LVMH to Take Control of Christian Dior in $13.1 Billion Deal (Published 2017) - The New York Times,"Tue, 25 Apr 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMTcvMDQvMjUvYnVzaW5lc3MvZGVhbGJvb2svbHZtaC1hcm5hdWx0LWNocmlzdGlhbi1kaW9yLmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LONDON — The LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton luxury empire and the French billionaire Bernard Arnault announced on Tuesday a series of moves to take over Christian Dior in a $13.1 billion deal to consolidate control over the 70-year-old Parisian fashion house.

The transaction would simplify LVMH’s relationship with Christian Dior by buying out minority shareholders. LVMH, the world’s biggest luxury group by revenue, already owns Parfums Christian Dior, and the deal would give it ownership of the Christian Dior haute couture, leather, men’s and women’s ready-to-wear, and shoe businesses.

As part of the proposal, one of the largest for the luxury goods conglomerate, the Arnault family offered to buy the 25.9 percent of Dior it does not already own. The family would hand over a mix of cash and Hermès shares, valuing Dior at 260 euros, or $282, a share, LVMH said. That represented a 15 percent premium over the closing price on Monday.

The LVMH fashion and leather goods division would then buy Christian Dior Couture for an enterprise value of €6.5 billion.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999514818191528}",neutral,0.9999514818191528,0
LVMH Takes Control of Christian Dior in $13 Billion Deal - The Business of Fashion,"Tue, 25 Apr 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzb2ZmYXNoaW9uLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy9uZXdzLWFuYWx5c2lzL2x2bWgtdG8tYnV5LWNocmlzdGlhbi1kaW9yLWNvdXR1cmUtZm9yLTEzLWJpbGxpb24v0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS, France — LVMH announced on Tuesday that it plans to integrate the entire Christian Dior brand within the luxury group, as part of a two-pronged strategic deal to strengthen its fashion and leather goods division. In total, the deal is valued at around $13 billion.

In part one, the Arnault family group (Groupe Arnault) has offered to buy the 26 percent of Christian Dior it doesn't already own for €172 per share in cash and 0.192 Hermès International shares for each Christian Dior share. (These values represent a 14.7 percent premium over Christian Dior’s latest share price and an 18.6 percent premium over its 1-month average.)

In part two, LVMH will acquire Christian Dior Couture from Christian Dior for an enterprise value of €6.5 billion.

The deal fuses together the entire Dior brand, creating further synergies between Christian Dior Couture and the Parfums Christian Dior, the latter of which is already fully owned by LVMH.

Shares in LVMH rose by more than 4 percent, to €224 per share, by 13.41 BST as the markets reacted to the news.

Revenue for Christian Dior has doubled over the past five years and its profitability has improved over the same period, with an increase in operating profit from recurring operations of 24 percent per year. For the last 12 months ended March 31, Christian Dior reported revenue in excess of €2 billion and profit from recurring operations of €270 million.

Bernard Arnault, chairman and chief executive, said the move illustrated the commitment of his family group towards LVMH and its brands. ""The corresponding transactions will allow the simplification of the structures, long requested by the market, and the strengthening of LVMH's fashion and leather goods division thanks to the acquisition of Christian Dior Couture, one of the most iconic brands worldwide,"" he said in a statement.

Luca Solca, head of luxury goods at Exane BNP Paribas, said he sees a number of positives in the deal. ""It adds a strong brand to the LVMH portfolio at a reasonable valuation and on an accretive basis,"" he said. ""It [also] reduces the risk of LVMH potentially buying 'trophy assets' at the expense of ROIC [return on invested capital] dilution.""

LVMH expects the filing of the proposed offer by the end of May, with the acceptance period lasting around three weeks.

Disclosure: LVMH is part of a group of investors who, together, hold a minority interest in The Business of Fashion. All investors have signed shareholder’s documentation guaranteeing BoF’s complete editorial independence.

Luxury goods giant LVMH grabs full control of Christian Dior - The Guardian,"Tue, 25 Apr 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy8yMDE3L2Fwci8yNS9sdm1oLWx1eHVyeS1nb29kcy1jb250cm9sLWNocmlzdGlhbi1kaW9y0gFZaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAudGhlZ3VhcmRpYW4uY29tL2J1c2luZXNzLzIwMTcvYXByLzI1L2x2bWgtbHV4dXJ5LWdvb2RzLWNvbnRyb2wtY2hyaXN0aWFuLWRpb3I?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The French luxury group LVMH, led by billionaire Bernard Arnault, is to take full control of Christian Dior, in a complex €12bn (£10bn) deal that reunites the fashion house with the perfume and other Dior brands.

The Arnault family, which holds a controlling stake in LVMH, owns 74.1% of Christian Dior, one of the world’s top fashion houses. The family said it wants to buy the remainder for €12bn, or €260 a share. It will then sell Christian Dior Couture to LVMH for €6.5bn.

LVMH, the world’s largest luxury company, owns Christian Dior perfumes and beauty after a deal in the 1960s to raise capital for the then-struggling brand. The latest transactions will bring the whole Christian Dior brand under one roof, from fashion to fragrances.

Arnault, France’s richest man and chief executive of LVMH, which was formed from the 1987 merger of fashion house Louis Vuitton with champagne and cognac producer Moët Hennessy, hailed the deal as an “important milestone” for the group.

He said the transactions demonstrated his family’s commitment to LVMH and would result in “the simplification of the structures, long requested by the market, and the strengthening of LVMH’s fashion and leather goods division thanks to the acquisition of Christian Dior couture”.

The move was welcomed by analysts and investors, and LVMH shares rose more than 4% to €223.55 in morning trade on Tuesday.

Luca Solca, the head of luxury goods at Exane BNP Paribas, said: “It adds a strong brand to the LVMH portfolio at a reasonable valuation.”

Paris-based Christian Dior has 198 stores worldwide including one in Mayfair, central London. It posted revenues of €2bn and underlying earnings of €418m last year.



The fashion house was founded by the French designer Christian Dior in 1946 with backing from the cotton fabric magnate Marcel Boussac. It later branched out into perfume, watches, jewellery, shoes and accessories.

His debut collection was quickly christened the “new look”, with a calf-length full skirt, cinched waist and fuller bust. Dior’s clothes were worn by stars such as Rita Hayworth, and he was invited to present the collection privately to the British royal family. He died in 1957.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999946355819702}",neutral,0.9999946355819702,0

It’s been a brisk couple of months for LVMH — first, there were unconfirmed reports that the company could be launching its own e-commerce venture, then yesterday’s news that it has fully acquired the house of Dior. And now, Business of Fashion reports that LVMH is unveiling Clos19, a new e-commerce platform that will sell the luxury conglomerate’s wine and spirits brands, which include Veuve Clicquot and Dom Pérignon. It will also offer customers “experiences” — including tastings, private dinner parties, even trips to Antarctica — that incorporate the beverages.

Founder and CEO Stephanie Watine Arnault, who is the niece of LVMH chairman and CEO Bernard Arnault, told BoF: “We are selling more than just a tour. What we are selling is the whole experience around it: from the trip to the right hotel booking to the right restaurants in the Champagne region. It’s the full package.” Considering millennials are increasingly choosing experiences over things, it’s a savvy approach to business — though considering this is fashion, “things” aren’t going anywhere anytime soon.

LVMH Makes 6.5-Billion-Euro Offer for Christian Dior Couture - WWD,"Tue, 25 Apr 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3dkLmNvbS9mZWF0dXJlL2x2bWgtb2ZmZXJzLXRvLWJ1eS1jaHJpc3RpYW4tZGlvci1jb3V0dXJlLWZvci02LTUtYmxuLWV1cm9zLTEwODc0NzY1L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS — French billionaire Bernard Arnault’s decision to bring Christian Dior Couture into the LVMH fold drew cheers from analysts and investors, who welcomed the luxury conglomerate’s move to plump its already strong portfolio of fashion and leather goods brands.

Shares in LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton shot up 3.9 percent to close at 223.15 euros, or $244 at current exchange rates, on the Paris Stock Exchange on Tuesday after the group said it would make an offer to buy Christian Dior Couture for 6.5 billion euros, or $7.06 billion.

“Overall, we think this deal is strategically good for LVMH, strengthening its already well-balanced portfolio with another top brand, and also giving it room to improve its earnings through further scale and synergies,” Bernstein Research said in a note.

The move will make Dior the second-largest brand in LVMH’s fashion division, behind Louis Vuitton and ahead of Fendi, reuniting its fashion and fragrance activities under a single umbrella — though Dior chief executive officer Sidney Toledano said he did not expect planned synergies to result in job cuts.

In tandem, Groupe Arnault, the investment firm controlled by the Arnault family, will make an offer of up to 12.1 billion euros, or $13.2 billion, for the 25.7 percent stake in the Christian Dior Group that it does not currently control, using its remaining stake in rival Hermès International as partial payment.

Presently, the Christian Dior Group includes Christian Dior Couture and LVMH. Christian Dior Couture encompasses the brand’s apparel, accessory and jewelry businesses, while the perfume and cosmetics lines are exercised under the umbrella of LVMH.

“We are reuniting the two houses, which will allow for even greater synergies and a continued growth in the potential of this house,” Arnault, who is chairman and ceo of LVMH, told a hastily convened press conference at LVMH’s headquarters on Avenue Montaigne.

“It’s as if there had been a missing family member,” Toledano said afterward. “It’s important for the brand to speak as one, in a clearer manner.”

Arnault noted the deal would simplify the structure of LVMH and reinforce his family holding’s grip on the group, which controls brands including Sephora, Bulgari, Guerlain and Moët & Chandon. Groupe Arnault’s stake in LVMH will rise to 46.8 percent from 36.2 percent previously.

“It’s an investment that shows our confidence both in the French economy and in the potential of the LVMH group internally,” Arnault said.

The executive reiterated his recent warnings that the luxury sector could be headed for its biggest correction since the 2008 collapse of Lehman Brothers, but said he was planning for posterity.

“I have always run my businesses with an eye on the medium-term, so I am used to LVMH weathering crises. We have experienced one every 10 years and at the end of the day, we have always come through relatively unscathed, so I am gearing up for the next one with a certain degree of serenity,” he said.

The timing of the operation reflects the strong performance of Dior and favorable market conditions, with historically high share prices and low-interest rates allowing LVMH to offer its shareholders a good deal and borrow the full amount of the buying price.

“This is a good acquisition for LVMH in our view given the strong brand of Christian Dior, good use of its balance sheet and reunites the Christian Dior brand with the very profitable perfume operation that LVMH operates,” Barclays said in a research note.

Dior, which celebrates its 70th anniversary this year, has come a long way since Arnault bought the brand in 1984 as part of a bankrupt textile group. The brand’s revenues have doubled in the last five years to reach two billion euros, or $2.2 billion at average exchange rates, in the 12 months ended March 31.

Its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, totaled 418 million euros, or $459 million, with the EBITDA margin rising above 20 percent of sales for the first time.

The simplified public offer for Christian Dior Group, to be filed with France’s stock market regulator AMF at the end of May, will consist of two-thirds cash and one-third shares in Hermès International.

If fully subscribed, it will entail Groupe Arnault getting rid of all its shares in Hermès, putting to rest any lingering speculation that Arnault was plotting an eventual takeover after triggering a protracted battle with the rival luxury firm with his stealthy acquisition of a 17.1 percent stake in Hermès in 2010.

Groupe Arnault still owns 8.4 percent of Hermès International’s capital, worth around four billion euros, or $4.3 billion.

The deal values each Christian Dior Group share at 260 euros, or $282.85. This represents a premium of 14.7 percent over Monday’s closing share price, and of 32.8 percent over the six-month share price average.

Shares in Christian Dior SE closed up 11.1 percent at 252.00 euros, or $275.63, while Hermès International was down 4.5 percent at 440.75 euros, or $482.03.

Christian Dior Couture’s enterprise value of 6.5 billion euros is equivalent to 15.6 times its EBITDA, a ratio which Jean-Jacques Guiony, chief financial officer of LVMH, said was in line with recent luxury sector acquisitions. It will be accretive to LVMH earnings per share from the first year.

“We are probably paying a slightly high price, but in 30 years, we will surely be glad we did it,” Arnault remarked.

Analysts said the valuation seemed fair, with Bernstein noting Dior’s growth potential, opportunity to improve profitability after a period of heavy investment and synergies with other brands.

Guiony said these included further integration in media buying and real estate management, as well as centralizing debt. Toledano said Dior would take advantage of LVMH’s support services, including its human resources, finance and IT teams, but plans to retain its 5,000 employees.

“There will be synergies on the administrative side, but we are not going to eliminate positions,” he said.

Further boosting Dior’s valuation are real estate assets including eight flagship buildings in prestigious locations such as Avenue Montaigne in Paris, New Bond Street in London and Ginza in Tokyo, as well as eight production facilities in France and Italy making shoes, handbags and costume jewelry, Toledano said.

Guiony said that after a lengthy development phase, Dior now benefits from three powerful assets: critical size, profitability and control over its sales, with 93 percent of revenues generated by its global network of 198 stores.

“Christian Dior Couture’s historic proximity to LVMH should not obscure the fact that this is an extremely strategic and important operation for LVMH,” he said. “There are not a lot of brands with revenues of more than 2 billion euros, and even fewer within Christian Dior Couture’s specific positioning.”

Toledano, who has run the brand since 1998, said the acquisition represented a new challenge, noting that he has no plans to retire anytime soon. “I am not a good golf player,” he said with a smile.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.999626636505127}",neutral,0.999626636505127,0
LVMH Billionaire Bernard Arnault to Take Full Control of Christian Dior - Fortune,"Tue, 25 Apr 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vZm9ydHVuZS5jb20vMjAxNy8wNC8yNS9sdm1oLWJlcm5hcmQtYXJuYXVsdC1jaHJpc3RpYW4tZGlvci_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"French billionaire euter will combine the Christian Dior fashion brand with his LVMH luxury goods group as part of a 12 billion euro ($13 billion) move to simplify his business interests, a restructuring long demanded by other investors.

Under a series of complex transactions, LVMH (LVMHF) will buy the Christian Dior Couture brand from the Christian Dior (CHDRY) holding company for 6.5 billion euros, including debt.

That will unite the 70 year old fashion label worn by film stars from Grace Kelly and Elizabeth Taylor to Jennifer Lawrence and Natalie Portman with the Christian Dior perfume and beauty business already owned by LVMH.

The Arnault family, which holds a 47% stake in LVMH, will also offer to buy the 25.9% of the Christian Dior holding company it does not already own for about 260 euros per share, a premium of 15% over Monday’s closing price.

LVMH shares rose 3% to a record high of 223 euros as investors and analysts welcomed the deals, which Arnault said would boost earnings at its fashion and leather goods division. Dior shares jumped 13% to a new high of 256 euros.

“This is a good acquisition for LVMH in our view given the strong brand of Christian Dior, good use of its balance sheet and it reunites the Christian Dior brand with the very profitable perfume operation that LVMH operates,” Barclays analysts wrote in a research note.

The Dior holding company owns 41% of the LVMH group and 100% of Christian Dior Couture, the home of the Lady Dior handbag.

Arnault’s family company will offer 172 euros per share and 0.192 Hermes (HESAY) shares for each Dior holding company share. It will also offer all-cash and all-share alternatives.

Arnault has a stake of about 8% in luxury group Hermes, and its shares fell about 5% on the prospect of more of the stock coming to the market.

The transactions “will allow the simplification of the structures, long requested by the market, and the strengthening of LVMH’s Fashion and Leather Goods division,” Arnault said in a statement.

LVMH said the overall deal would boost earnings per share within the first year of its completion, with the transactions expected to close during the second half of 2017.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9997239708900452}",neutral,0.9997239708900452,0
LVMH Purchases Christian Dior for $13.1 Billion - W Magazine,"Tue, 25 Apr 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndtYWdhemluZS5jb20vc3RvcnkvbHZtaC1wdXJjaGFzZXMtY2hyaXN0aWFuLWRpb3ItZm9yLTEzMS1taWxsaW9uLWRvbGxhcnPSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"This morning it was announced that LVMH — the luxury owner of a slew of brands from Sephora to Louis Vuitton — took total control of Christian Dior in a deal worth an $13.1 billion in cash.

Keep in mind, though, LVMH CEO Bernard Arnault and his family already had a majority ownership in Dior, and Arnault also served as Dior’s chairmen. Dior’s perfume and cosmetics businesses were also already full subsidies of LVMH. It was a bit of complicated arrangement, and the latest deal gives the Arnault family and LVMH full control of Dior’s high fashion business while simplifying the ownership arrangement. In a statement released by LVMH, the Arnault Family Group — the largest shareholder of LVMH —would purchase the remaining 26 percent of Dior shares that it does not already own for $282 a share, with a mix of cash and shares in Hermès, a luxury brand famously not under the LVMH umbrella but in which Arnault also owns a minority stake. (Other labels LVMH does maintain control of include Givenchy, Céline, Nicholas Kirkwood, Thomas Pink, Marc Jacobs, and of course, Moet Champagne.)

While both parties have remained relatively mum on the details of the deal, the statement does note that the purchase will lead to the reorganization and restructuring of Christian Dior Couture and Parfums Christian Dior. What that restructuring will ultimately mean to consumers, if anything, remains to be seen.

It’s also unlikely that deal will have any major immediate consequences for the creative side of Dior. Arnault was already deeply involved with the choice of Maria Grazia Chiuri as Dior’s latest creative director.

It's the latest business coup for businessman Bernard Arnault, who has expanded his LVMH empire to include dozens of leading luxury brands — from high-end champagne and whiskies, to exclusive Vuitton handbags, Kenzo and Givenchy perfumes and Bulgari and TAG Heuer watches. Dior Couture, launched in 1946 and seen as the pinnacle of Paris style, would be a starring jewel in his empire.



Shares in Christian Dior and LVMH Moet Hennessy — Louis Vuitton rose after Tuesday's long-awaited deal. The public offers values Dior at 260 euros per share. Shares in Dior spiked 12 percent to 253.95 euros by early afternoon trading Tuesday, while LVMH shares were up 4.3 percent at 223.95 euros.



According to the announcement, LVMH, which already owned Christian Dior cosmetics and perfumes, would buy Christian Dior Couture, its fashion business, for 6.5 billion euros ($7.1 billion). In addition, the Arnault Family Group is making a public offer for the Christian Dior shares it doesn't currently hold.



The hope is that combining Dior's entities under one roof and simplifying internal activities, savings will be generated.



The statement says the boards of both companies approved the transactions on Monday. The proposed deal will still need regulatory approval and consultations with workers. The companies also hope to issue the public offer in June, and finalize the purchase of Dior Couture in the second half of this year.



The companies laid out their hope that Dior's fashion revenues and profit, which have risen in recent years, will be a ""source of growth"" for LVMH, particularly with development in the U.S., China and Japan.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9996280670166016}",neutral,0.9996280670166016,0

It’s merely the latest acquisition in a battle between two families that has turned the world of luxury fashion into a virtual duopoly.

The Arnaults

The patriarch of the Arnault family, Bernard Arnault is chairman and CEO of LVMH—which stands for Louis Vuitton Moët Hennessy—the largest luxury company by revenue. He is France’s richest man and together with his family has an estimated net worth of $51.6 billion.

He was born in the industrial French town of Roubaix and began his career at Ferret-Savinel, his family’s construction company, as an engineer. In 1984, he bought Boussac, a textile group that at the time included Christian Dior (which since shifted ownership), and began to build his luxury empire. In 1989, Arnault became the majority shareholder of LVMH—formed from a merger between Moët Hennessy and Louis Vuitton in 1987 that included Moët champagne and Hennessy cognac.

The elder Arnault has been the chairman and CEO of the company since then. He is also a patron of the arts, and his benchmark project the Fondation Louis Vuitton, a $135 million center in the west of Paris designed by Frank Gehry and opened in 2014.

The oldest of his children, Delphine Arnault, 41, is executive vice president at Louis Vuitton; and her brother, Antoine, 39, is chief executive of the shoemaker Berluti and chairman of the cashmere label Loro Piana. The third of the five Arnault children, Alexandre, 24, recently (paywall) became co-CEO of the German luggage maker Rimowa. The Arnault family now overseas as empire of 70 brands, including these iconic luxury names:

Céline (Acquired the Parisian fashion house in 1988)

Berluti (Acquired the shoemaker in 1993)

Kenzo (Acquired the Japanese fashion brand in 1993)

Guerlain (Acquired the perfumer in 1994)

Loewe (Acquired the Spanish leatherwear maker in 1996)

Marc Jacobs (Acquired the fashion brand in 1997)

Sephora (Acquired the cosmetics retailer in 1997)

Thomas Pink (Acquired the fashion brand in 1999)

Tag Heuer (Acquired the Swiss watchmaker in 1999)

Emilio Pucci (Acquired the Italian fashion house in 2000)

Fendi (Acquired the Italian fashion house in 2001)

The Pinaults

The other family that dominates fashion is headed by Francois Pinault, the self-made billionaire born in 1936 to a family of timber traders. He was a high-school dropout who built his fortune from a wood-importing business, which he then sold to invest in the luxury-goods business that was PPR and became the holding company Kering.

His biggest victory over his rival, Bernard Arnault, was the acquisition of the Gucci brand, after a public tussle for ownership. His son, François-Henri Pinault, joined the Pinault Group in 1987 and worked in several of the group’s operating companies before taking over as chairman and CEO in 2005. The family—which also owns auction house Christie’s, two Parisian department stores, four wineries, and three French publications—has a net worth of $19.5 billion.

Like his contemporary and rival, Francois Pinault is also an art collector, has a 3,000-piece art collection including works by Picasso, Mondrian and Koons—which he displays in his Palazzo Grassi contemporary art museum in Venice. He plans (paywall) to open a private museum in Paris in 2018 to display his contemporary art collection.

PARIS (Reuters) - French billionaire Bernard Arnault will combine the Christian Dior fashion brand with his LVMH luxury goods empire as part of a 12 billion euro ($13 billion) move to simplify his business interests - a restructuring long demanded by other investors.

Under a series of complex transactions, LVMH, the world's largest luxury group, will buy the Christian Dior Couture brand from the Christian Dior holding company for 6.5 billion euros, including debt.

The deal will unite the 70-year-old fashion label worn by film stars from Grace Kelly and Elizabeth Taylor to Jennifer Lawrence and Natalie Portman with the Christian Dior perfume and beauty business already owned by LVMH.

The Arnault family, which holds a 47 percent stake in LVMH, will also offer to buy the 25.9 percent of the Christian Dior holding company it does not already own for about 260 euros per share, a premium of 15 percent over Monday's closing price.

The transactions ""will allow the simplification of the structures, long requested by the market, and the strengthening of LVMH's Fashion and Leather Goods division,"" the 68-year-old Arnault said in a statement.

Ronan Poupon, European equity portfolio manager at Natixis Asset Management, who holds LVMH shares, said the deal was good for both sets of shareholders, the Arnault family and LVMH, which adds a profitable luxury brand to its stable.

LVMH shares rose almost 5 percent to a record high of 225 euros as investors welcomed the deals, which they expect to boost LVMH earnings. Dior shares also jumped 13 percent to a new high of 256 euros.

""This is a good acquisition for LVMH in our view given the strong brand of Christian Dior, good use of its balance sheet and it reunites the Christian Dior brand with the very profitable perfume operation that LVMH operates,"" Barclays analysts wrote in a research note.

LAST BIG DEAL?

LVMH said it would use a loan to pay for Christian Dior Couture, which has 198 stores in over 60 countries, and whose sales have doubled over the past five years.

Story continues

Exane BNP Paribas analyst Luca Solca welcomed ""the long awaited LVMH and Dior merger"", which he said was made at a reasonable valuation. Including debt, LVMH is paying 15.6 times Dior's 2017 earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA).

Solca added the deal also reduced the risk of LVMH, whose brands include Louis Vuitton and Hennessy cognac, buying pricey, ""trophy assets"".

Finance chief Jean-Jacques Guiony declined to comment on LVMH's future mergers and acquisitions (M&A) policy. But Arnault told the Financial Times that LVMH was not hunting for acquisitions as ""fewer and fewer assets are looking attractive to us. And the best assets are not for sale.""

The Dior holding company owns 41 percent of the LVMH group and 100 percent of Christian Dior Couture, the home of the Lady Dior handbag.

Arnault's family company will offer 172 euros per share and 0.192 Hermes shares for each Dior holding company share. There are potential all-cash and all-share alternatives.

Arnault has a stake of about 8 percent in luxury group Hermes, and Hermes' shares fell from earlier record highs on the prospect of more of the stock coming to the market.

LVMH said the overall deal would boost earnings per share by some 3 percent within the first year of its completion, with the transactions expected to close during the second half of 2017.

LVMH Boss Delivers Little Cheer at General Assembly - WWD,"Thu, 13 Apr 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3dkLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy1uZXdzL2ZpbmFuY2lhbC9hcm5hdWx0LWRlbGl2ZXJzLWxpdHRsZS1jaGVlci1hdC1sdm1oLWFubnVhbC1tZWV0aW5nLTEwODY2OTEzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS — Strong first-quarter results propelled LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton shares to a record high this week, but did nothing to brighten Bernard Arnault’s cautious outlook for the year ahead.

Shareholders hoping to revel in the company’s record 2016 performance at its annual general meeting in Paris on Thursday were treated instead to a repeat of the warning that Arnault, chairman and chief executive officer of LVMH, delivered to analysts in January.

“In my opinion, it is at times like these, when the results are excellent, that you need to be most attentive, most vigilant and most cautious. Indeed, experience shows there is nothing worse in a successful company than self-satisfaction, and this tends to have an effect that is both numbing and demotivating,” Arnault told Thursday’s meeting at the Carrousel du Louvre.

Earlier this week, the parent of brands including Louis Vuitton, Guerlain, Moët & Chandon and Tag Heuer reported revenues rose 15 percent in the first quarter to 9.9 billion euros, or $10.55 billion, significantly beating market expectations. Organic growth was 13 percent, with all divisions posting double-digit gains.

At the group’s full-year results press conference at the beginning of the year, Arnault startled analysts by warning that the luxury sector could be headed for its biggest correction since the 2008 collapse of Lehman Brothers.

Among the risk factors, he cited record-low interest rates; “irrationally exuberant” stock markets, borrowing a phrase coined by former Federal Reserve Board chairman Alan Greenspan; geopolitical uncertainty, with potential conflicts brewing in the areas of trade, customs and currencies, and continued low growth in Europe.

While the first half should be relatively positive, thanks to easy comparisons with the same period last year, the situation could rapidly worsen, he warned at the time. Arnault reiterated his prediction on Thursday, saying he would not be surprised if another major crisis erupted within the next five years.

“There is a crazy amount of money in all the markets, so we are ready to make a big mistake, and to cap it all, stock markets keep rising. So I think we are in a period that calls for a lot of vigilance,” he said. In a gesture of consolation, shareholders were gifted a bottle of Moët & Chandon Champagne at the meeting.

Arnault sidestepped a question about his relationship with U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, both of whom he has met in recent months, but said demand was picking up in both countries.

“The Russian clientele, after having pulled back sharply due to sanctions and a large drop in oil prices, is back for the time being,” he noted.

The executive was happier to address a shareholder’s request for a recording of his recent public piano performance in Moscow alongside his wife, concert pianist Hélène Mercier, and their son Frédéric. The trio played Mozart’s Piano Concerto No. 7. “I’ll send you a DVD,” Arnault promised.

Asked about the group’s decision to exit De Beers Diamond Jewellers, its retail joint venture with De Beers Group, Arnault signaled that LVMH has big ambitions for Bulgari, the star of its watches and jewelry division. “We prefer to concentrate on Bulgari and other brands, and making sure that Bulgari becomes one day perhaps the number-one jewelry brand in the market,” he said.

He also made clear LVMH would retain its selective approach to acquisitions, following its recent purchase of a majority stake in German luggage maker Rimowa. “The group’s principal objective is not to make acquisitions,” he said. “It is the internal growth of our brands.”

Looking ahead, he predicted a successful launch for the line of handbags developed by Louis Vuitton in collaboration with artist Jeff Koons. Unveiled at a dinner at the Louvre museum on Tuesday, the Masters collection is scheduled to go on sale on April 28.

Arnault also touted initiatives like LVMH’s upcoming collaboration with Rihanna on a makeup collection, to be called Fenty Beauty by Rihanna, and its relaunch of department store Le Bon Marché’s e-commerce site.

“The group is totally oriented towards digital, both in terms of e-commerce, but also with regard to the internal management of our business and communication,” he said.

Antonio Belloni, group managing director, said LVMH was creating a digital skill center and shifting investment to online initiatives. This includes a target of directing 30 percent of its media spend toward digital platforms, he added.

The meeting approved the company’s proposed dividend of 4 euros, or $4.27, for 2016, up 13 percent versus 2015. Arnault said that despite the company’s high share price — it closed at 208.60 euros, or $221.47 at current exchange rates, on the Paris Stock Exchange on Thursday — he did not see the need for a share split.

“Two hundred euros is the price of a [Louis Vuitton] perfume,” he said, prompting laughter from the audience.

Animal rights group PETA had hoped to challenge LVMH at the meeting on its use of exotic skins, which the activist group alleges causes suffering to animals such as crocodiles and ostriches. The non-profit group, formally known as People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, bought a single share in LVMH in order to gain admittance — a strategy it employed successfully at the Hermès AGM last year.

Anissa Putois, a French spokeswoman for PETA, said she was not able to ask the question because she was seated in a room adjacent to the main auditorium, where the proceedings were screened for the overflow crowd. “It was very disappointing,” she said.

The LVMH meeting was followed on Thursday afternoon by another AGM, this time for Christian Dior Group, the company that holds Christian Dior Couture as well as a controlling stake in LVMH.

It was the second general assembly in five months for the group, after it moved back to reporting in line with the calendar year in 2017, resulting in a shortened financial year that exceptionally ran from July 1 to Dec. 31, 2016.

Earlier this week, Christian Dior Couture posted first-quarter revenues of 506 million euros, or $539 million at average exchange rates, up 18 percent versus the same period a year ago. At constant exchange rates, sales rose 17 percent, compared with 12 percent in the previous quarter.

Retail sales revenue rose 19 percent at actual exchange rates and 18 percent at constant exchange rates, boosted by the positive reception for Maria Grazia Chiuri’s first ready-to-wear and accessories collections for the house, it reported.

“The results are very encouraging with regard to her designs,” Sidney Toledano, vice-chairman and ceo of Christian Dior Group, told the annual meeting.

The meeting approved the nomination of Maria Luisa Loro Piana, the widow of Sergio Loro Piana, to the board of directors of the group.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9937995076179504}",positive,0.9937995076179504,1

LVMH, which already owns Christian Dior perfumes, said in a statement on Tuesday it had now agreed to buy Christian Dior Couture for 6.5 billion euros ($7.0 billion).

Under a series of complex transactions, LVMH luxury goods group will buy the company - best known for the leatherware, Haute Couture, ready-to-wear, jewellery and shoes businesses - in addition to acquiring a 25.9-percent stake in Christian Dior SA holding company it doesn't already hold.

LVMH was offering 260 euros per share, the company said - a premium of 15 percent over Monday's closing price and raising the value of the deal to 12 billion euros.

The announcement sent LVMH shares soaring on the Paris stock exchange, where they jumped by around three percent in a generally flat market.

Clearer structures

The transactions would allow ""the simplification of the structures, long requested by the market, and the strengthening of LVMH's Fashion and Leather Goods division,"" the Arnault family, which holds 47 percent in LVMH, said in a statement.

In the view of LVMH, the 70-year-old fashion label was ""one of the most iconic brands worldwide,"" selling a range of goods ""almost exclusively"" in 198 luxury boutiques around the world.

Christian Dior Couture sales have doubled over the past five years, and last year revenues amounted to more than two billion euros, while underlying or operating profit totaled 270 million euros.

By making it a wholly-owned subsidiary, LVMH would be able to unlock its ""high growth potential,"" the LVMH statement said. ""The development of Christian Dior Couture will be notably supported over the coming years by a new creative momentum and significant investments already completed, notably in America, China and Japan,"" it added.

Market analysts also hailed the long-awaited deal. In a research note, analysts of Barclays Bank spoke of a ""good acquisition"", saying the ""strong brand Christian Dior"" would be reunited with LVMH's ""very profitable"" perfume business.

Exane BNP Paribas analyst Luca Solca also sees ""a number of positives,"" saying in a statement that the deal ""adds a strong brand to the LVMH portfolio at a reasonable valuation."" Furthermore, it would reduce the ""risk of LVMH potentially buying 'trophy assets',"" which would dilute returns on capital, he told the news agency AFP.

It would offer 172 euros in cash and 0.192 shares in Hermes , in which Arnault also has a stake, to buy each remaining Christian Dior share it does not currently hold.

LVMH will also buy the Christian Dior couture brand from the Christian Dior holding company for an enterprise value of 6.5 billion euros ($7.1 billion). Arnault has controlling stakes in both the current Dior structure and LVMH.

LVMH added in a statement that the overall deal would boost its earnings-per-share within the first year of its completion, with the transaction expected to be closed during the second half of 2017.

French business magnate, art collector and billionaire Bernault Arnault has moved to consolidate the corporate structure of Christian Dior, bringing all of the Paris-based fashion house’s operations together under the LVMH luxury umbrella. As it stands, Christian Dior is split between LVMH and other minority shareholders.

LVMH is publically traded, but the Arnault family currently owns a 47 percent stake in the brand. The group has owned a large chunk of Christian Dior’s operations since the 1960s, when it forged a deal to raise capital for the fashion house. However, the brand’s couture business – comprising handbags, made-to-measure gowns and men’s and women’s ready-to-wear fashions – has for decades been split from LVMH’s arm of the business.

The purchase will be completed in a number of payments that have been planned to simplify leadership of the fashion house. The cash-and-shares deal values Christian Dior at €260 ($283) a share, giving the deal a total value of €12.1bn ($13bn). The purchase price marks a 15 percent premium above the stock’s closing price on April 24.

In a statement, Arnault said: “The corresponding transactions will allow the simplification of the structures, long requested by the market, and the strengthening of LVMH’s fashion and leather goods division thanks to the acquisition of Christian Dior Couture, one of the most iconic brands worldwide.”

The merger is expected to be immediately accretive to LVMH earnings per share. Stephen Mitchell, Head of Strategy for Global Equities at Jupiter Asset Management, said in a Bloomberg Radio interview: “Reuniting Christian Dior Couture and Christian Dior Parfums, so one brand under one leadership, has to be a good thing for LVMH shareholders.”

LVMH shares rose by 3.2 percent in early trading in Paris as markets reacted to the news.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999940395355225}",neutral,0.9999940395355225,0

Collectors, grab these oldies while they're hot.

This article originally appeared in the June 2017 issue of ELLE.

On March 7, the same day one French fashion house mock-launched a branded rocket 33 feet into the air at the Grand Palais, and a beloved Italian brand upholstered practically every inch of the Palais d'Iéna in what appeared to be the faux-fur hide of a Purple People Eater, it was Louis Vuitton that really took Paris's show-location cake—er, macaron. The monumental, Louis XIV–commissioned white-marble warriors of the Louvre museum's cavernous Cour Marly—illuminated by shifting evening light through an I.M. Pei glass pyramid and, one imagines, vibrating gently to the thudding bass of Frank Ocean—bore little evident connection to Nicolas Ghesquière's patterned-fur jackets, high-shine tweed dresses, and cropped flares. Yet the message in staking out an entire wing of the planet's most-visited and arguably most-revered museum? It was a show of force by fashion's most powerful luxury brand.

Two days later, in an unmarked building not far from the museum, Louis Vuitton Executive Vice President Delphine Arnault arrived to unveil another show of force—this one a years-long mission that has, until now, been guarded like a palace secret. As the daughter of Bernard Arnault, head of LVMH—parent company of Vuitton, Dior, Céline, Givenchy, Bulgari, Dom Pérignon, and more—and France's richest man, Delphine, 42, is, along with her brother Antoine (the CEO of men's footwear label Berluti), an heir apparent to the biggest luxury stable in the world. But with her pale blond hair, delicate features, and soft-spoken presence, Delphine is anything but showy about her considerable might; she rarely speaks to the press and, in the interviews she does grant, chooses her words with care and hesitates to take credit for big ideas like, say, the LVMH prize recognizing emerging designers, a project she introduced in 2013 that has become a famously successful incubator for next-generation fashion talent. Yet behind the scenes, Delphine Arnault's ambitions are clearly bold—for, carrying on the brand's grand tradition of artist collaborations, her latest undertaking is turning over LV's bread-and-butter leather goods to Jeff Koons, an artist whose own catalog blurb once described him as waging a ""one-man war on taste."" The Arnaults are longtime Koons boosters and collectors, and Delphine is something of a megafan. ""He is probably the most important living artist,"" she raves. ""I've been to three of his retrospectives—at the Whitney, the Centre Pompidou, the Guggenheim Bilbao."" Enlisting Koons, she says, ""was a dream.""

For art's captain of ""obvious,"" whose oeuvre—from shiny, mammoth balloon animals to a golden sculpture of Michael Jackson and his pet chimp, Bubbles—is in some ways as conceptually accessible as tulips in a deli stall, making luxury goods seems a natural extension of making epic art out of humble objects. In 2006, Koons replicated his shiny Rabbit (based on a blow-up toy) on pendants for Stella McCartney's runway. In 2014, he loaned H&M a six-inch image of his monumental Balloon Dog—a version of the work that sold at Christie's in 2013 for $58.4 million, the highest-ever price at auction for the work of a living artist—for a bag that cost $49.50.

It took some 50 tries for LV artisans to reproduce each painting to Koons's specifications.

But this time around, Koons isn't relying on his own archive. ""I think Vuitton is about audacity and innovation,"" Arnault says. ""And brands have to make people think and question."" So when Koons said he wanted to make bags (and wallets, computer cases, scarves, key chains—51 items in all) splashed with five of the most iconic works in the art history canon—even Mona Lisa, the most famous painting in the world, says Arnault, who happens to share the Mona Lisa's enigmatic smile—""We thought, Wow, what a genius."" In the end result—available live and in person for the first time at Masters – A collaboration with Jeff Koons, a pop up shop at 655 Madison Avenue running tomorrow through July—Fragonard's pearly-skinned girl frolics in bed with her floppy-eared dog across a wallet; Titian's nude Venus, her hand entwined in Mars's hair as Cupid takes his aim, lounges on LV's Neverfull tote; Van Gogh's blue sky undulates over A Wheatfield With Cypresses on a piece of hand luggage. For the pop up, these legendary works are also blown up across double-height LED screens for Manhattan's ritziest residents to marvel at. It's certainly the starriest opening these works have seen in awhile.

FREDERIKE HELWIG

For an artist who considers it a moral imperative to polish to perfection even the underside of a 150-ton sculpture—a surface likely to be seen only by professional art movers—the bags, too, are considered from every angle. It took some 50 tries for LV artisans to reproduce each painting to Koons's specifications, showing every brushstroke and nuance of age. Another challenge: devising a finish sufficiently shiny for the bags' many gold LV logos and four-point fleur-de-lis. Then there's the interior. If you unzip, say, the Speedy top-handle, you get a pair of Wiki-style blurbs, one about the great master behind the borrowed work, one about Koons himself. Koons didn't stop there. On each bag (and, thus, each masterpiece), you'll find his own shiny signature as well as his initials, JK, winkingly styled to look like the LV logo.

In New York, sitting in his Chelsea HQ in the middle of an all-white, cathedral-quiet office, surrounded by a handful of the 140 people he employs to manage his business and produce his works, Koons elegantly skirts any suggestion of artistic button-pushing. Instead, he dives into a discourse that ranges from Platonism to humanism to metaphysics and, ultimately, transcendence. It starts with the name that sits smack in the middle of each bag, identifying its old- master creator in big, block-lettered hardware. That's not just an homage. In Paris, Arnault pointed out the letters as a hat-tip to the bags' artistic predecessors, Koons's recent Gazing Ball series, in which he has reproduced 35-plus masterpiece paintings—including the five used here—and affixed to each a reflective blue ball not unlike those most banal of lawn ornaments. Like the supershiny surfaces of many of Koons's most famous pieces, the balls reflect light, but also the viewer. ""As soon as you move, it starts,"" the artist says. ""It lets you know that the art is not in the object, but inside you."" So on a laptop case in which the Mona Lisa peeks placidly out from behind a smattering of golden logos, those letters—DA VINCI—reflect the person opposite the bag. ""All of a sudden, the viewer, the person carrying these bags, are interconnected,"" Koons says, to the infinite line of art history.

""I realized the power of art that so effortlessly connects all of the human disciplines together: that I can be involved in philosophy and psychology and physics and theology and aesthetics.""

He asks an assistant to pull up an image of Diamond (1994–2005), his giant, blingy ""stones"" cut for the finger of a comic-book giantess. Those sculptures marked the origins of his interest in metaphysics: ""As far back as you can go to the point of the diamond, that's as far back as you can go in human history in our biology, in our genes, in our DNA.""

Likewise, Koons links backward and forward along strands of cultural interconnectivity: Da Vinci, he says, loved and referenced his fellow Renaissance man, painter Piero della Francesca. ""Through being interested in people outside himself, things outside himself, he was able to experience transcendence. This type of linkage changed Da Vinci."" Koons, too, claims to have been genetically altered by the work of other artists. ""My first art history lesson, my teacher showed us Manet's Olympia, and spoke about what different references it may have had, what types of symbolism, how it may have functioned in nineteenth-century France, people observing the work."" He continues, simply: ""My life changed. And I became a different human being. All of a sudden, I realized the power of art that so effortlessly connects all of the human disciplines together: that I can be involved in philosophy and psychology and physics and theology and aesthetics."" The bags he sees as a symbol of humanism; a person carrying them would, in his eyes, be a person who ""enjoys people, enjoys becoming, enjoys the contributions of what people have made before them.""

Koons and Vuitton worked closely with the museums that are home to each of the works—largely to get access to the originals and as a courtesy, since works from the distant past are now in the public domain and thus fair game. As director of the Museum of Fine Arts of Rennes in northwestern France, Anne Dary is the current keeper of Peter Paul Rubens's 1616 Tiger Hunt, another of Koons's chosen works. The painting of men on horseback locked in brutal battle with a trio of leaping, majestic beasts illustrates Koons's point about cultural interconnectedness, in that it kick-started an interest in exotic hunting scenes that lasted up to the eighteenth century. ""No artist would have produced a hunting scene without Rubens in mind,"" Dary says. It also inspired 21 known copies, and Rubens himself allowed the work to be painted into Jan Brueghel the Elder's Sight and Smell, in which dozens of lush paintings crowd a collector's wall. Yet, other than postcards and the like, Tiger Hunt has never been reproduced commercially—and certainly never on a $3,200 backpack. Dary says she's constitutionally opposed to the use of art on ""goodies—even in museum shops. I just can't stand it!"" The difference for her, she says, is that this request came not from a brand, but from an artist. ""In my view, an artist can use other artists' works to create their own art,"" Dary says. Besides, with the royalties from the LV project, her museum will be able to purchase new works of art.

Before leaving Paris, I circled back to the Louvre, compelled to pay homage to the Mona Lisa herself, independent of her gilded accoutrements. It's not hard to find her: You just follow the signs bearing her face. I I recalled my first trip down these infinite marble halls. As a 17-year-old who thought she loved art, I felt vaguely embarrassed that Mona Lisa was one of few works I knew well enough to seek out—already aware of her as both treasure and, perhaps, cliché—and then a little deflated by the reality of her: a mere 30-by-20-inch canvas, protected behind glass, with crowds of schoolchildren held at bay by a wide, semicircular wooden barricade.

This time, I think I can see her a little better. She, who has seen so many generations pass through these halls, looks so wise, so serene, as if to say, You will come and go, and I will still be here. Maybe it's a kind of transcendence.

When I left, I exited through the gift shop, of course. There was Mona Lisa again, so many of her this time—on nail files and notebooks, mugs and bags, magnets and playing cards and Rubik's Cubes—commerce having won the battle with artistic purity long ago. I considered her shy smile, peering up at me from a tin of lip balm. But it had started to rain, so I bought her umbrella.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.999996542930603}",neutral,0.999996542930603,0

LVMH, which already owns Christian Dior perfumes, said in a statement it had now agreed to buy Christian Dior Couture -- the leatherware, Haute Couture, ready-to-wear, jewellery and shoes businesses -- for 6.5 billion euros ($7.0 billion). The announcement sent LVMH shares soaring on the Paris stock exchange, where they jumped by around three percent in a generally flat market. At the same time, the Arnault family who own 74 percent of the holding company, Christian Dior SA, would ""demonstrate their commitment"" by acquiring the remaining 26 percent, LVMH said. That would streamline the current shareholder structure and help unlock synergies, LVMH finance chief Jean-Jacques Guiony told a telephone news conference. Set up 70 years ago, Christian Dior Couture ""is one of the most iconic brands worldwide"", LVMH said. It sells its range of goods ""almost exclusively"" in 198 luxury boutiques around the world. Sales have doubled over the past five years and, last year, revenues amounted to more than two billion euros, while underlying or operating profit totalled 270 million euros. At present, Christian Dior Couture is wholly owned by Christian Dior SA. By making it a wholly-owned subsidiary, LVMH would be able to unlock its ""high growth potential,"" it said. The deal ""will allow LVMH to incorporate one of the most emblematic brands worldwide. It will allow for the regrouping of Christian Dior Couture and Parfums Christian Dior brands,"" the statement continued. - 'Source of growth' - ""On the strength of its history and favorable prospects, Christian Dior Couture will be a source of growth for LVMH,"" it said. ""The development of Christian Dior Couture will be notably supported over the coming years by a new creative momentum and significant investments already completed, notably in America, China and Japan."" In its part of the two-fold deal, the Arnault Family Group would launch a public takeover offer to purchase the shares in Christian Dior SA it did not already own. The bid will take the form of a cash offer of 172 euros per share, plus 0.192 shares in Hermes International, valuing the each share at 260 euros, the statement said. That represented a premium of 14.7 percent over the closing share price on Monday and a premium of 18.6 percent over the average share price during the past month. The boards of directors of Christian Dior and LVMH were ""unanimously favourable"" to the plans, LVMH said. ""This project represents an important milestone for the group,"" said LVMH chief executive Bernard Arnault. ""The corresponding transactions will allow the simplification of the structures, long requested by the market, and the strengthening of LVMH's Fashion and Leather Goods division. They illustrate the commitment of my family group and emphasize its confidence in the long-term perspectives of LVMH and its brands."" Analysts also hailed the long-awaited deal. ""We see a number of positives,"" said Exane BNP Paribas analyst, Luca Solca. ""It adds a strong brand to the LVMH portfolio at a reasonable valuation and on an accretive basis and it reduces the risk of LVMH potentially buying 'trophy assets'"" which would dilute returns on capital, the expert said. ""The operation is being viewed positively by the markets,"" because it will increase the theoretical value of the share, Daniel Larrouturou of Diamant Bleu Gestion told AFP.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.8923605680465698}",neutral,0.8923605680465698,0

French billionaire Bernard Arnault will combine the Christian Dior fashion brand with his LVMH luxury goods group as part of a 12 billion euro ($13 billion) move to simplify his business interests, a restructuring long demanded by other investors.

Under a series of complex transactions, LVMH will buy the Christian Dior Couture brand from the Christian Dior holding company for 6.5 billion euros, including debt.

That will unite the 70 year old fashion label worn by film stars from Grace Kelly and Elizabeth Taylor to Jennifer Lawrence and Natalie Portman with the Christian Dior perfume and beauty business already owned by LVMH.

The Arnault family, which holds a 47 per cent stake in LVMH, will also offer to buy the 25.9 per cent of the Christian Dior holding company it does not already own for about 260 euros per share, a premium of 15 per cent over Monday's closing price.

LVMH shares rose three per cent to a record high of 223 euros as investors and analysts welcomed the deals, which Arnault said would boost earnings at its fashion and leather goods division. Dior shares jumped 13 per cent to a new high of 256 euros.

""This is a good acquisition for LVMH in our view given the strong brand of Christian Dior, good use of its balance sheet and it reunites the Christian Dior brand with the very profitable perfume operation that LVMH operates,"" Barclays analysts wrote in a research note.

The Dior holding company owns 41 per cent of the LVMH group and 100 per cent of Christian Dior Couture, the home of the Lady Dior handbag.

Arnault's family company will offer 172 euros per share and 0.192 Hermes shares for each Dior holding company share. It will also offer all-cash and all-share alternatives.

Arnault has a stake of about eight per cent in luxury group Hermes, and its shares fell about five per cent on the prospect of more of the stock coming to the market.

The transactions ""will allow the simplification of the structures, long requested by the market, and the strengthening of LVMH's Fashion and Leather Goods division,"" Arnault said in a statement.

LVMH said the overall deal would boost earnings per share within the first year of its completion, with the transactions expected to close during the second half of 2017.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.999198853969574}",neutral,0.999198853969574,0

LVMH is also looking to acquire Christian Dior Couture, effectively reuniting it with the Parfums Christian Dior brand; the latter being already part of the LVMH Group.

Bernard Arnault is already a majority shareholder of Christian Dior and serves as the Chairman of both LMVH Group and Dior. He is also the CEO of the LVMH Group.

The Arnault Family Group offer of Dior’s remaining shares would consist of €172 in cash ($187) and 0.192 Hermès International shares for each Christian Dior share, and would be completed by two secondary offers [in cash and in Hermès shares respectively].

The group also announces that LVMH will acquire Christian Dior Couture for an enterprise value of €6.5bn, ($7.07bn).

Christian Dior, listed on Euronext Paris, currently holds a 41% stake in LVMH (representing 57% of the voting rights) and 100% of Christian Dior Couture.



The Arnault Family Group offer values each Christian Dior share at €260, which represents a premium of 14.7% over the closing share price as of 24 April 2017 and 18.6% over the one-month average share price, says the Arnault Family Group.

OFFER TIMELINES

The filing of the proposed offer is expected by the end of May 2017 and the French financial market authority’s (Autorité des marchés financiers) clearance (décision de conformité) and launch of the offer are both expected in June 2017.

In addition, LVMH and Christian Dior signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) on 24 April regarding the disposal of Christian Dior Couture to LVMH for an enterprise value of €6.5bn.

The transaction will be financed by a vendor loan granted to LVMH with a maximum maturity of 24 months, allowing LVMH to refinance at the appropriate time, based on market conditions.

“Founded by Monsieur Dior 70 years ago, Christian Dior Couture has been the inspiration for global fashion since its creation,” says Dior. “It is one of the most prestigious brands worldwide.

198 STORES REPRESENT 93% OF DIOR’S REVENUE

“Its unique positioning encompasses most high quality product categories, such as leather, haute couture, men’s and women’s ready-to-wear, jewellery and shoes, and relies on exceptional savoir-faire.”

Dior merchandise is distributed almost exclusively within its proprietary worldwide network of 198 stores. This network represents 93% of the brand’s revenue and ensures comprehensive control over its distribution and brand image.

Christian Dior Couture owns a portfolio of real estate assets in prime locations, notably its historic store on Avenue Montaigne, the New Bond Street, London store and the new Ginza store in Tokyo.

According to Dior, revenue doubled over the past five years and profit from recurring operations grew by 24% each year.

The Dior Couture acquisition will be accretive (+2.7% on a pro forma basis) to LVMH earnings per share from the first year. Following the acquisition, LVMH’s gearing will increase from 12% as of December 31, 2016 to 35% on a pro forma basis.

The closing of the transaction is expected in the second half of 2017 subject to compliance of the offer for Christian Dior shares.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999983310699463}",neutral,0.9999983310699463,0

""In the first part of the five-year [presidential term] that is about to end, corporations were ostracised from society.

""I had no doubts that Macron would get past the first round. But after the recent US elections and the UK's referendum results, one could never trust forecasts and opinion polls.

PARIS: French billionaire Bernard Arnault moved to consolidate control over Christian Dior for about 12.1 billion euros ($13.2 billion), folding the fashion house's operations into the LVMH luxury empire in one of his biggest transactions.The deal, in which the Arnault family is offering to buy out minority investors in Christian Dior SE for 260 euros a share and shedding some of its holdings in rival Hermes International, unites ownership of one of the most iconic fashion brands under one roof. That's 15 per cent above the Monday closing price of Dior, which the family already controls with a 74 per cent stake.The two-part transaction, which comes amid a China-led revival in the luxury-goods industry's fortunes, simplifies a complicated ownership structure and crowns the career of the biggest consolidator in the business.Arnault, who has a net worth of $46.3 billion, took control of the parent companies of Dior and Louis Vuitton in the 1980s and later added brands ranging from fashion label Fendi to jeweler Bulgari and suitcase maker Rimowa.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999940395355225}",neutral,0.9999940395355225,0

AmorePacific tops LVMH in cosmetics

AmorePacific Group, a Korean manufacturer of cosmetics, outperformed French luxury retail giant LVMH in the global cosmetics business last year.AmorePacific ranked seventh on the list of top 100 cosmetics companies by U.S.-based fashion journal Women’s Wear Daily, while LVMH was ninth.Last year, LVMH was 11th, and AmorePacific was 12th. AmorePacific Group’s five-step catapult was the biggest jump among companies listed in the top 10 this year.The list released annually by Women’s Wear Daily is based on each company’s earnings report. The evaluation solely focuses on beauty products and excludes revenue generated from non-beauty segments like soap, toothpaste and other products commonly manufactured by cosmetics makers.L’Oreal, a French cosmetics giant that handles brands like Lancome, Biotherm, Kiehl’s and Shu Uemura, took the No. 1 spot for the 11th straight year.Unilever, a Dutch-British company best known for Dove and Pond’s, ranked second, followed by U.S.-based conglomerate Procter & Gamble.This is AmorePacific’s first year in the top 10. The leading Korean cosmetics company last year generated $5.58 billion, an 18.2 percent year-on-year jump. The company attributed the growth to five of its most popular brands, Sulwhasoo, Laneige, Mamonde, Innisfree and Etude House. In particular, Innisfree, sold as a nature-friendly brand in the low-to-mid price range, generated 1 trillion won ($880 million) last year.AmorePacific also diversified its global business last year in China, the United States and Southeast Asia. The cosmetics company said it will further emphasize the Southeast Asian region in the near future to lower its dependence on the large Chinese market as political tension between Korea and China over a U.S. missile shield have affected trade between the two countries.AmorePacific said it will target mature markets like Singapore, Malaysia and Thailand to build on its brand recognition and plans to newly expand to emerging markets like Vietnam, Indonesia and the Philippines.For the Middle East region, another emerging market in the cosmetics business, AmorePacific said it will launch Etude House, one of its low-priced brands, within this year. It started a local corporation in Dubai last year.“I feel honored to list in the top 10 list to represent Korea,” AmorePacific Group CEO Suh Kyung-bae said in a statement. “AmorePacific has grown based on distinctive brands, continuous investment in technology and localized business strategies in overseas markets.”BY JIN EUN-SOO [jin.eunsoo@joongang.co.kr]","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999176263809204}",neutral,0.9999176263809204,0

Billionaire Bernard Arnault’s LVMH – which houses a raft of brands including Louis Vuitton and Moet Hennessy – announced it was buying the remaining 26 per cent of Christian Dior it does not already own, while also revealing it will fold the fashion house’s 70-year-old couture label into its group for €6.5 billion.

The deal, valuing Dior at €260 a share, marks one of LVMH’s biggest ever acquisitions and sees it add Christian Dior Couture to its stable, joining Dior perfumes, which it has owned since the 1960s.

Arnault said the deal was an “important milestone”and that Christian Dior Couture’s enterprise value of €6.5bn represented a 15.6x EBITDA4 multiple for the company.

He added that it would “allow the simplification of the structures, long requested by the market, and the strengthening of LVMH’s fashion and leather goods division thanks to the acquisition of Christian Dior Couture, one of the most iconic brands worldwide”.

The Arnault family already owns controlling stakes in both Dior and LVMH.

They said the full acquisition of Dior will also boost LVMH earnings from the first year, with the transaction expected to be complete during the second half of 2017.

Designer Christian Dior founded the House of Dior in 1946, with backing from businessman Marcel Boussac.

It has since expanded into perfume, watches and accessories and the couture arm has 198 stores worldwide.

Designers Pierre Cardin and Yves Saint Laurent also once worked for the House of Dior. Dior died in 1957.

The luxury label continued its growth momentum over the last twelve months, with revenue in excess of €2bn, an EBITDA of €418m3 and profit from recurring operations of €270m.

The acquisition will be accretive (+2.7 per cent on a pro forma basis) to LVMH earnings per share from the first year. Following the acquisition, LVMH’s gearing will increase from 12 per cent as of December 31, 2016 to 35 per cent on a pro forma basis.

LVMH said the Christian Dior Couture will be a source of growth and the development will be supported over the coming years by a new creative momentum and significant investments, notably in America, China and Japan.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.8439992070198059}",neutral,0.8439992070198059,0

April. 27, 2017 07:24. by Jung-Min Dong ditto@donga.com. LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton Chairman and chief executive officer Bernard Arnault, who inherited his father’s construction company, acquired the Boussac group, the parent company of Christian Dior in 1989 at the French government’s request. After that, he became a luxury goods mogul by taking control over some 70 luxury brands including Louis Vuitton, Céline, Fendi, Givenchy, Marc Jacobs, Bulgari and Hublot. People close to him say that Dior is “like Arnault’s baby.” After launching the LVMH group in 1987, he has been expanding his empire in the global luxury market through large-scale mergers and acquisitions.

On Tuesday, Arnault completed his reign in the luxury world by announcing a decision to take full control over Dior. LVMH announced that it acquired 25.9 percent of Dior for 12.1 billion euros (13.1 billion U.S. dollars). As LVMH had already owned 74.1 percent of Dior, the deal would give it ownership of the Christian Dior haute couture, leather, men’s and women’s ready-to-wear, and shoe businesses. The acquisition would also increase the Arnault family’s share in LVMH from 36 percent to 46 percent.

After the announcement, Dior’s share prices surged by 11 percent in the European stock market on Tuesday, while LMVH stocks also gained by 3.94 percent. According to Forbes on Tuesday, Arnault, the richest man in France, has become the eighth wealthiest in the world, with assets of 51 billion dollars.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999419450759888}",neutral,0.9999419450759888,0

Christian Dior, the luxury goods group, is the main holding company of LVMH, owning 40.9% of its shares, and 59.01% of its voting rights.

Price target increase

Last Tuesday, LVMH released their sales and revenue for Q117 and once again they smashed estimates.

Having gone through my model, we increased the price target from €210 to €225.

The increase in price target is a result of an increase in the forward P/E from 24x to 26x given the resilience and strength of this Group.

Investment rationale:

* The shares have clearly outperformed the market this year given the positive outlook on the Group and sector. Year-to-date, LVMH shares are up 16% compared to the CAC Index which is up 5%. This is an outperformance of 11%.

* LVMH 1Q sales delivered a beat across the board. We expect 2017 and beyond to remain positive for the Group

* Don’t forget this Group outperformed even during the Asian crisis when retail was getting slaughtered due to concerns China was slowing down. LVMH was still managing to outperform consensus

* All brands within the group are well known brands doing exceptionally well

* What was truly impressive though is that ALL divisions were up double-digit, which was last seen in 1Q11. The strength of all group businesses continues to drive outperformance in all key categories:

o Wines & Spirits Q1 17: 13% organic growth (expected 5%)

o Fashion & Leather Goods Q1 17: 15% organic growth (expected 9%)

o Perfume & Cosmetics Q1 17: 12% organic growth (expected 7%)

o Watches & Jewellery Q1 17: 11% organic growth (expected 6%)

o Selective retailing Q1 17: 11% organic growth (expected 8%)

* Other analysts are also increasing their price target on this stock given the strength of this company being priced in

* Management is going through a cost cutting exercise which should improve margins going forward

* LVMH is well positioned to benefit from improved economic conditions

Concerns

* The group stated that the c20% growth in cognac was volume-driven and this could have implications for stock levels later in the year

* The group also indicated that the trends currently being observed ‘cannot reasonably be extrapolated for the full year’

* Geopolitical risks

These figures reported are much better than we expected. Impressively all divisions were in double-digit growth. We expect Fashion & Leather Goods to be the main focus in 2017. If global economic growth continues picking up, LVMH will continue outperforming the market.

Why Dior deal may leave Diageo waiting for Moet Hennessy ownership - Sky News,"Tue, 25 Apr 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vbmV3cy5za3kuY29tL3N0b3J5L3doeS1kaW9yLWRlYWwtbWF5LWxlYXZlLWRpYWdlby13YWl0aW5nLWZvci1tb2V0LWhlbm5lc3N5LW93bmVyc2hpcC0xMDg1MDMwMtIBamh0dHBzOi8vbmV3cy5za3kuY29tL3N0b3J5L2FtcC93aHktZGlvci1kZWFsLW1heS1sZWF2ZS1kaWFnZW8td2FpdGluZy1mb3ItbW9ldC1oZW5uZXNzeS1vd25lcnNoaXAtMTA4NTAzMDI?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Sky's Ian King says the UK drinks firm's wish for full control of Moet Hennessy was not aided by Bernard Arnault's Dior move.

It's often tricky when a brand has more than one owner or when different extensions of a brand have different owners.

For example, the Hilton Hotels brand was for many years split, with the US business owned by the US-based Hilton Hotel Corporation and operations in the rest of the world owned by Britain's Ladbrokes.

Foster's, the Australian lager, is owned by brewing giant AB InBev everywhere in the world, apart from Europe, where it is owned by Heineken.

Similarly, many people - including some journalists - continue to be confused by the fact that Rolls-Royce Motors is owned by BMW and not by Rolls-Royce, the aircraft engine maker.

Today, such confusion concerning Christian Dior, one of the world's most famous names in fashion and luxury goods, is brought to an end in a €12.1bn (£10.2bn) deal put together by Bernard Arnault, one of France's richest and wiliest businessmen.

It is a complicated deal but the key headline behind it is that, for the first time in 70 years, the whole of the Christian Dior brand will be united under one roof.

Previously, Dior's fragrance and cosmetics businesses were owned by Louis Vuitton Moet Hennessy (LVMH), the luxury goods business in which Mr Arnault and his family were major shareholders.

And the Christian Dior Couture business, comprising leatherware, Haute Couture, ready-to-wear, jewellery and shoes, was owned by the separately listed Christian Dior PA, in which the Arnault family were also major shareholders.

To add to the confusion, Christian Dior PA also owned 41% of LVMH.

So what's behind the deal? Well, on one level, this represents a significant tidying-up of Mr Arnault's business affairs.

It will raise his family's shareholding in LVMH from the present 35% to 46%. It is something minority shareholders in both LVMH and Christian Dior PA have wanted for a while.

The other strand is the opportunity LVMH now has from owning all aspects of the Dior name.

At present, the fragrances business is by far the bigger, generating operating profits last year of €551m on sales of €4.95bn, while Christian Dior Couture made profits of €270m on sales ""in excess of €2bn"", according to Tuesday's statement.

What is striking, though, is that the Couture business appears to be growing more rapidly. Its sales have doubled during the past five years while the fragrances business has only grown sales by 55% in that time.

But both are out-performing the wider luxury goods market which, during the last few years, has been rattled by a number of factors.

They include terrorism in Europe, which has prevented some well-heeled Asian and American tourists from coming over to snap up bargains; the clampdown on corruption in China, which has prevented officials from giving and receiving gifts and squalls in emerging markets, whose customers have been of growing importance to the sector.

The market is also highly fragmented. The banking group Macquarie estimates the two arms of the Christian Dior name still only account for 1.8% of the global luxury goods market, trailing the likes of Burberry, Prada, Gucci, Hermes, Chanel and Louis Vuitton itself.

So there is plenty of scope for the Christian Dior name, thanks to the opportunities provided by unification, to grow both sales and market share during coming years. During Tuesday's presentation to investors, LVMH pointed out that 93% of Christian Dior Couture's sales are generated in its global network of just 198 stores, indicating the potential to grow sales through other channels should the company see fit.

Customers of the Christian Dior brand have also, during recent years, proved less resistant to price increases than the customer of rival luxury brands and this will also have undoubtedly influenced Mr Arnault's thinking. The deal also lessens LVMH's dependence on the Louis Vuitton brand itself in future.

But the new deal also raises other questions about LVMH. The acquisition of Christian Dior Couture makes this flagship French company more rooted than ever in fashion, perfumes and other luxury accessories. Wines and spirits are of diminishing significance.

LVMH owns 66% of Moet Hennessy, the champagne and cognac house, with the other 34% owned by Diageo, the UK spirits giant, which has made no secret of its desire to take full control.

The assumption has always been that, until Mr Arnault needed the cash to buy another fashion house, no deal would be possible. Cunningly, Mr Arnault has avoided this for now, by using his family's shares in another luxury brand, Hermes, as his acquisition currency.

It looks as if Diageo may have to wait a little longer.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999972581863403}",neutral,0.9999972581863403,0
LVMH billionaire Bernard Arnault takes control of Dior for $17.4bn - The Australian Financial Review,"Tue, 25 Apr 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFmci5jb20vY29tcGFuaWVzL3JldGFpbC9sdm1oLWJpbGxpb25haXJlLWJlcm5hcmQtYXJuYXVsdC10YWtlcy1jb250cm9sLW9mLWRpb3ItZm9yLTE3NGJuLTIwMTcwNDI1LWd2czZkaNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LVMH rose as much as 3.2 per cent in early trading in Paris, while Dior was up as much as 13 per cent.

The deals ""illustrate the commitment of my family group and emphasise its confidence in the long-term perspectives of LVMH and its brands,"" Mr Arnault said in a statement.

Dior investors can choose payment in cash or in stock of fashion rival Hermes International, using shares in the rival Paris-based luxury company that the Arnault family received in 2014 after a controversial effort by LVMH to build a stake. The boards of Christian Dior and LVMH are unanimously in favour of the deals, and have appointed independent experts to review the terms.

Swapping the Hermes stock for Dior shares helps the Arnault family cash out of a profitable investment without paying taxes on a sale.

LVMH surprised its rival in October 2010 by announcing it held 17.1 per cent of the company. The move led the Hermes founding family to file a lawsuit and to form a holding company to protect its ownership. LVMH in 2014 ended the drama, distributing the shares to investors. Hermes shares have risen 351 per cent since the end of 2008, the year in which LVMH began buying derivatives on the stock.

""This is a good acquisition for LVMH in our view, given the strong brand of Christian Dior,"" analysts at Barclays said in a note, adding that it its a ""good use of its balance sheet.""

Hermes was down as much as 4 per cent in early trading.

LVMH, whose full name is LVMH Möet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE, is paying about 15.6 times earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation over the past year for Christian Dior Couture, which it will acquire for €6.5 billion under the second part of the plan announced Tuesday.

Designer Christian Dior founded the fashion house in 1946 with backing from businessman Marcel Boussac, later expanding into fragrances, watches and accessories and opening stores in New York, London and Tokyo. Designers Pierre Cardin and Yves Saint Laurent also worked for the house early in their careers. Dior died in 1957.

LVMH to consolidate hold on Dior in multibillion-euro deal - CTV News,"Tue, 25 Apr 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmN0dm5ld3MuY2EvYnVzaW5lc3MvbHZtaC10by1jb25zb2xpZGF0ZS1ob2xkLW9uLWRpb3ItaW4tbXVsdGliaWxsaW9uLWV1cm8tZGVhbC0xLjMzODM1NzTSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS -- The magnate behind LVMH is to incorporate Christian Dior into his luxury goods empire in a multibillion-dollar deal.

It's the latest business coup for businessman Bernard Arnault, who has expanded his LVMH empire to include dozens of leading luxury brands -- from high-end champagne and whiskies, to exclusive Vuitton handbags, Kenzo and Givenchy perfumes and Bulgari and TAG Heuer watches. Dior Couture, launched in 1946 and seen as the pinnacle of Paris style, would be a starring jewel in his empire.

Shares in Christian Dior and LVMH Moet Hennessy - Louis Vuitton rose after Tuesday's long-awaited deal. The public offers values Dior at 260 euros per share. Shares in Dior spiked 11.8 per cent to 253.65 euros by mid-morning Tuesday, while LVMH shares were up 3 per cent at 221.25 euros.

According to the announcement, LVMH, which already owned Christian Dior cosmetics and perfumes, would buy Christian Dior Couture, its fashion business, for 6.5 billion euros (US$7.1 billion). In addition, the Arnault Family Group is making a public offer for the Christian Dior shares it doesn't currently hold.

The hope is that combining Dior's entities under one roof and simplifying internal activities, savings will be generated.

The statement says the boards of both companies approved the transactions on Monday. The proposed deal will still need regulatory approval and consultations with workers. The companies also hope to issue the public offer in June, and finalize the purchase of Dior Couture in the second half of this year.

The companies laid out their hope that Dior's fashion revenues and profit, which have risen in recent years, will be a ""source of growth"" for LVMH, particularly with development in the U.S., China and Japan.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9996850490570068}",neutral,0.9996850490570068,0
LVMH to buy Christian Dior in a £10bn deal - GQ India,"Tue, 25 Apr 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdxaW5kaWEuY29tL2NvbnRlbnQvbHZtaC1idXktY2hyaXN0aWFuLWRpb3ItMTBibi1kZWFs0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Today the Arnault Family Group announced that it's simplifying its existing relationship with Christian Dior by buying out minority shareholders, ensuring LVMH will now have complete control over the storied brand, founded by the designer in 1946.

The deal, worth 12.1 billion euros, cuts through the existing complicated ownership structure to unite Christian Dior Couture and Christian Dior Parfums for the first time in decades. Under a series of planned transactions, LVMH will get Christian Dior Couture, made-to-measure gowns and men's and women's ready-to-wear lines.

The Arnault family already controls Dior, with a 74 percent stake, but ""the corresponding transactions will allow the simplification of the structures, long requested by the market, and the strengthening of LVMH's Fashion and Leather Goods division thanks to the acquisition of Christian Dior Couture, one of the most iconic brands worldwide,"" Bernard Arnault said in a statement.

At the same time, the Arnault family who own 74 percent of the parent company, Christian Dior SA, will acquire the remaining 26 percent in a move to streamline the current shareholder structure, LVMH finance chief Jean-Jacques Guiony told a telephone news conference.

Set up 70 years ago, Christian Dior Couture “is one the most iconic brands worldwide”, LVMH said.

Its activities range from leatherware, Haute Couture, read-to-wear, jewellery and shoes and has a global network of 198 luxury boutiques and its sales have doubled over the past five years.

Last year, revenues amounted to more than two billion euros and it booked underlying or operating profit of 270 million euros.

Under the current group structure, Christian Dior Couture is wholly owned by Christian Dior SA, which for its part also holds a 41-percent stake in LVMH.

By making it a wholly-owned subsidiary, LVMH would be able to harness its “high growth potential” of Christian Dior Couture, the statement said.

At the same time, the Arnault Family Group is planning a public takeover offer to purchase the shares in Christian Dior SA it does not already own.

The bid will take the form of a cash offer of 172 euros per share, plus 0.192 shares in Hermes International, the statement said.

The simplification of the shareholder structure appeared to please investors and LVMH shares were showing a gain of around three percent on the Paris stock exchange in response to the news, while the blue-chip CAC 40 index was up just 0.1 percent.

LVMH to Take Control of Christian Dior in $13.1 Billion Deal - RAU.UA,"Wed, 26 Apr 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiLWh0dHBzOi8vcmF1LnVhL2VuL25ld3Nlbi9sdm1oLWNocmlzdGlhbi1kaW9yL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Кожна акція паризького будинку моди Christian Dior обійдеться LVMH в $282, остаточно формальності будуть улагоджені у другій половині року.

New York Times, London.

The LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton luxury empire and the French billionaire Bernard Arnault announced on Tuesday a series of moves to take over Christian Dior in a $13.1 billion deal to consolidate control over the 70-year-old Parisian fashion house.

The transaction would simplify LVMH’s relationship with Christian Dior by buying out minority shareholders. LVMH, the world’s biggest luxury group by revenue, already owns Parfums Christian Dior, and the deal would give it ownership of the Christian Dior haute couture, leather, men’s and women’s ready-to-wear, and shoe businesses.

As part of the proposal, one of the largest for the luxury goods conglomerate, the Arnault family offered to buy the 25.9 percent of Dior it does not already own. The family would hand over a mix of cash and Hermès shares, valuing Dior at 260 euros, or $282, a share, LVMH said. That represented a 15 percent premium over the closing price on Monday.

The LVMH fashion and leather goods division would then buy Christian Dior Couture for an enterprise value of €6.5 billion.

“The corresponding transactions will allow the simplification of the structures, long requested by the market, and the strengthening of LVMH’s fashion and leather goods division,” Mr. Arnault said in a statement. He added that the deal “illustrated the commitment of my family group and emphasizes its confidence” in LVMH’s long-term prospects.

Mr. Arnault laid his first claim to Christian Dior in 1984, when he bought Boussac, a textile group that included the Parisian fashion house and that was in bankruptcy protection at the time. Christian Dior soon became the cornerstone of Mr. Arnault’s luxury empire.

But the company was part of a complicated holding structure, making Dior a “sister” fashion brand to the many labels that Mr. Arnault bought via LVMH, including Berluti, Givenchy and Loro Piana. From the outside, however, Dior seemed to be part of the same family.

The Arnault family owns a 47 percent stake in LVMH, whose brands also include Céline and Fendi. The boards of Christian Dior and LVMH are unanimously in favor of the deals, the statement said, and they have appointed independent experts to review the terms.

LVMH’s offer to take over the Dior couture division will simplify ownership to an extent, but not entirely. The company called Christian Dior, which owns the brand’s couture business, will continue to exist and will own 41 percent of the share capital in LVMH, plus 56.8 percent of voting rights, making it the conglomerate’s controlling shareholder.

LVMH continues to outperform the wider luxury market, which has faltered in recent years in the face of fears of geopolitical conflict and currency fluctuations. Last month, rebounding demand for luxury goods in China and Europe pushed its first-quarter sales to €9.88 billion, a 15 percent increase over the same period a year earlier and far beyond estimates.

Analysts reacted positively to news of the deal with Christian Dior, which had long been expected by industry observers. The transaction is expected to close in the second half of this year, and it is projected to increase LVMH’s earnings per share within the first year of its completion, according to the statement announcing the agreement.

“The deal adds a strong brand to the LVMH portfolio at a reasonable valuation,” Luca Solca, managing director of luxury goods at Exane BNP Paribas, wrote in a note to investors.

Over the past five years, revenue at Christian Dior has doubled and profitability has improved. The brand named its first female creative director, Maria Grazia Chiuri, to much excitement last June. Though her collections have been met with lukewarm reviews, the brand reported revenue in excess of €2 billion and profit from recurring operations of €270 million for the 12 months ended March 31.

The Arnaults’ decision to offload Hermès shares comes nearly three years after the family received stock in the Paris-based luxury leather goods house after an effort by LVMH to build a stake in the company.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.999990701675415}",neutral,0.999990701675415,0
Christian Dior now fully owned by LVMH - Retail Gazette,"Tue, 25 Apr 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldGFpbGdhemV0dGUuY28udWsvYmxvZy8yMDE3LzA0L2NocmlzdGlhbi1kaW9yLW5vdy1mdWxseS1vd25lZC1ieS1sdm1oL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"A decades-long, complicated ownership system of luxury fashion retailer Christian Dior has been simplified after LVMH moved to consolidate control of the brand.

The â‚¬12.1 billion (£10.2 billion) deal unites ownership of Dior with LVMH – the global luxury fashion and retail empire owned by France‘s richest person Bernard Arnault.

A 1960s-era deal meant LMVH had already owned the perfumes and beauty arms of Dior, but this latest deal folds operations of Christian Dior Couture, which makes the Lady Dior handbag, made-to-measure gowns and men‘s and women‘s ready-to-wear fashions, under one roof.

Arnault said that bringing the two arms of Dior under the same umbrella will ease its access to financing for stores and marketing as well as making it easier to move talent between Dior’s perfume and fashion arms.

Dior Couture also owns prime real estate, including stores in London, Paris and Tokyo.

“This is an operation that shows our confidence in the French economy as well as in LVMH going forward,” Arnault said at a press conference announcing the deal.

“It will allow us to increase the synergies that already exist between LVMH and Christian Dior Couture.”

LVMH, otherwise known as LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton, is a business empire that owns Louis Vuitton, Marc Jacobs, Sephora, Givenchy, Fendi, Tag Heuer, Bulgari, Kenzo and various upmarket alcohol and cosmetics brands.

Christian Dior chief executive Sydney Toledano told reporters that the new consolidation deal would have little impact on the brand‘s eight production sites in France.

Other LVMH-owned brands have also maintained control of their factories.

“As with creativity and product development, I believe that the Dior touch has to remain distinct in production,” Toledano said.

The news comes amid a revival in sales and profits for the luxury retail sector, boosted by Asian markets as well as consumers taking advantage of the Brexit-hit pound.

Earlier this month, LVMH recorded a 15 per cent increase in revenue in the quarter, raking in â‚¬9.9 billion (£8.4 billion) – also represented an organic revenue growth was 13 per cent compared to the same period of 2016.

The French billionaire proposed a €12 billion ($13 billion) deal on Tuesday that was cheered by the shareholders of both luxury titans according to CNN Money.

The Arnault family already owns a controlling interest in both Christian Dior and LVMH and Arnault is chairman of both firms. The family is offering to pay a 15% premium for the 26% of Dior they don’t already own. The deal would also bring Dior’s couture business under LVMH’s umbrella.

Allyson Stewart-Allen, a director at International Marketing Partners, said the deal will also help LVMH diversify. Dior’s biggest regional market is Asia, accounting for over 30% of its sales.“It’s a risk management strategy to diversify your portfolio … but it’s also about going for growth,” she said. “In the emerging markets, Dior is growing.”

The “transactions will allow the simplification of the [business] structures,” Arnault said in a written statement.

The companies said they expect the deal to close in the next few months. The proposed deal is complicated but the end goal of the transaction is simplicity.
