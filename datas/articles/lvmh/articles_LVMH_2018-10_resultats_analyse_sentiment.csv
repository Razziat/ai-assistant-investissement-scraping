LVMH Third Quarter Sales Boosted by Fashion and Leather Goods - The Business of Fashion,"Tue, 09 Oct 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzb2ZmYXNoaW9uLmNvbS9uZXdzL2x1eHVyeS9sdm1oLXNob3dzLXRoYXQtY2hpbmFzLWx1eHVyeS1zaG9wcGVycy1hcmVudC1maW5pc2hlZC15ZXQv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS, France — A standout performance by LVMH's fashion and leather goods business boosted third-quarter sales growth, it said on Tuesday, offering an encouraging sign for a luxury goods sector gripped by fears of a slowdown in China.

The Louis Vuitton owner, which has a stable of brands ranging from couture label Givenchy to cognac maker Hennessy, has profited along with a handful of rivals such as Gucci-owner Kering from rebounding demand among Chinese customers in the past two years.

Concerns over a trade war between Beijing and Washington and a falling yuan has rattled luxury goods stocks in recent weeks, though there is little sign of waning spending among young and digital-savvy Chinese shoppers with a taste for branded goods.

LVMH, the world's biggest luxury goods company, posted a 14 percent rise in comparable sales in the division covering sales of high-margin handbags and fashion, beating the 12 percent increase expected in an Inquiry Financial poll of analysts.

Powered by Vuitton, the single most important contributor to the conglomerate's sales, the division is also home to fashion brand Christian Dior, which has been revamping its accessories with the recent relaunch of its 1990s Saddle bag.

LVMH, the first luxury goods player to report for the three months to Sept. 30, said sales reached 11.4 billion euros ($13.1 billion) in the quarter and were up 10 percent on a comparable basis, in line with forecasts.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9999991655349731}",positive,0.9999991655349731,1
Crowds Throng to Fourth Edition of LVMH's Open Doors Event - WWD,"Mon, 15 Oct 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigQFodHRwczovL3d3ZC5jb20vZmFzaGlvbi1uZXdzL2Rlc2lnbmVyLWx1eHVyeS9sdm1oLWRyYXdzLWNyb3dkcy1mb3VydGgtZWRpdGlvbi1qb3VybmVlcy1wYXJ0aWN1bGllcmVzLW9wZW4tZG9vcnMtZXZlbnQtMTIwMjg3ODE3Ni_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS — The long queues in front of leading luxury stores in Paris this weekend might suggest they were holding the high-end equivalent of a Black Friday sale.

But the crowds gathered outside Dior headquarters on Avenue Montaigne, the Guerlain flagship on Avenue des Champs-Elysées or the Chaumet salons on Place Vendôme weren’t looking to part with any cash — just to catch a glimpse behind the scenes of some of the 70 brands that form LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton.

From Oct. 12 to 14, the world’s biggest luxury group held the fourth edition of its Journées Particulières open-doors event, which gives members of the public worldwide a rare opportunity to meet the craftspeople who make everything from Louis Vuitton handbags to Tag Heuer watches and Berluti shoes.

The event is the brainchild of Antoine Arnault, head of communication and image of LVMH, who launched the biennial initiative in 2011 to counter a perception that the group was only interested in making money. It has steadily grown in size, with this year’s edition drawing a record 180,000 visitors, up from 145,000 in 2016.

Arnault kicked off proceedings with a cocktail party on Thursday at the group’s headquarters, where he posed with his father, LVMH chairman and chief executive officer Bernard Arnault, alongside dozens of craftspeople — some still wearing their workshop aprons — in the building’s inner courtyard.

Inside, senior executives including group managing director Antonio Belloni, human resources director Chantal Gaemperle and Sidney Toledano, chairman and ceo of LVMH Fashion Group, mingled with participants over Champagne and canapés.

“What is different this time around is that there are a lot more houses taking part, so there’s a lot of expectation and an even greater responsibility on our shoulders,” said Arnault, flanked by his partner Natalia Vodianova, the Russian model who has been a face of Guerlain for 10 years.

For the first time, the free event spread to the U.S., Latin America, Australia and New Zealand, with 14 countries taking part, versus six in 2016. In total, 77 venues welcomed visitors, starting with the Cloudy Bay vineyard in New Zealand and ending with the Benefit Cosmetics headquarters in San Francisco.

However, the underlying format of the initiative remained unchanged.

“The feedback we got from our teams was basically, ‘Keep things as they are, and above all, don’t try to reinvent something that’s already working very well,’” Arnault said. “Obviously, we try to ensure that logistically, it’s even more comfortable for visitors and the visits are even more interesting for everyone concerned.”

This time, LVMH allowed applicants to create a profile on a dedicated web site beginning Sept. 13 in order to make it easier to book priority access tickets on Sept. 22 and 25. Still, Arnault admitted that tickets to the hottest venues — the Dior couture atelier and the Vuitton leather goods workshop — were again snapped up in record time.

“We had tens of thousands of online applications,” Arnault revealed. “The Vuitton visits were gone in less than a minute, so you really had to be in front of your computer at 10 a.m. precisely on that day. It’s a little unfair, but we haven’t found a better way to do it.”

A number of sites were also open without reservations, with 3,000 staff and artisans on hand to welcome the public. On Friday morning, Arnault began three days of site visits at the workshops of Berluti, personally greeting the first groups of visitors to the exclusive shoemaker, of which he has been ceo since 2012.

Then it was across the Avenue des Champs-Elysées on foot to the Guerlain store, where perfumer Thierry Wasser and creative director Olivier Echaudemaison were on hand to provide insights into the history of the house, which is celebrating its 190th birthday with 1,100 fragrance creations to its credit.

Wasser noted that until recently, perfume formulations were handed down orally from generation to generation. “Today, should something happen to us — heaven forbid — there are procedures in place and all the instructions have been committed to paper,” he told a group of visitors.

Echaudemaison explained that Guerlain was the first to produce lip tint in stick form in the 19th century. “The strength of Guerlain is to have created products that are mythical today, but that nobody knew before,” he said, adding the house’s Terracotta bronzing powder and Météorites highlighting powder to the list.

Arnault watched as an artisan demonstrated how perfume bottles are sealed with gold thread. Soon, it was on to the next destination: the Chaumet headquarters on Place Vendôme, where he paused to snap a picture on his cell phone of the crowd beginning to gather on the historic square that is home to France’s leading jewelers.

Inside, groups lined up on the carpeted stairs leading to spectacular 18th-century reception rooms, where artisans lifted the lid on the history of the 235-year-old house, famed as the official jeweler to Empress Joséphine. A group of women listened in wonder as a stone setter explained that he picks up gemstones with a tool made of a mixture of wax and cigar ash, to prevent them from sticking.

Chaumet ceo Jean-Marc Mansvelt showed Arnault the futuristic Vertiges tiara designed by Scott Armstrong, the winner of a competition held at Central Saint Martins art school in London to coincide with Chaumet’s “Imperial Splendor” show in Beijing’s Forbidden City last year.

It’s the kind of one-of-a-kind creation that is beyond the reach of all but the world’s 1 percent, but then again, the Journées Particulières event is not designed to recruit new customers, according to Arnault.

“We’re not trying to sell a single extra pair of made-to-measure shoes. That might be a consequence in five years’ time, who knows? But I’m not really concerned with that,” he explained.

“If our customers want to come, they’re welcome, but this is not aimed at them. Our customers are already very well taken care of. If an important client really wants to see the Dior or Berluti workshops, 99 percent of the time, it can be arranged. This is for people who are not privileged every day. It’s for people who are interested in the heritage and the history of these houses,” Arnault added.

That doesn’t mean the workshops were backward-looking. Paris department store Le Bon Marché put the spotlight on female entrepreneurs with a series of master classes hosted by women who have founded mono-product brands, including jewelry designer Marion Vidal, knitwear brand Molli’s Charlotte de Fayet and Philippine Janssens, who specializes in made-to-measure pants.

And at the Sephora headquarters in the Paris suburb of Neuilly-sur-Seine, visitors heard about fledgling brands involved in the company’s accelerator and mentorship programs, some of which have not yet been launched and were being presented by their founders to the public for the first time. These included BeautyMix, Saisons d’Eden, Anju Rupal, pH Fragrances, Zeto and Ho Karan.

Chris de Lapuente, the retailer’s ceo, said he believes that Sephora, now in 34 countries and commanding some 10 percent of the prestige beauty market, “will be present in every single country of the world” one day.

For those unable to join a visit, LVMH has produced a podcast series, “Confidences Particulières,” featuring conversations with artisans such as winemakers, makeup artists, seamstresses and enologists. The episodes are available on the Journées Particulières web site, as well as Soundcloud, Podcast Addict and Apple Podcasts.

Featured personalities include Jean-Claude Biver, the watchmaking veteran and industry leader who recently stepped down as head of LVMH’s watch division, and perfumer Francis Kurkdjian, whose independent house was snapped up by LVMH last year.

Arnault said the group’s artisans regularly thank him for opening up their secretive and highly specialized trades to a wider audience. “They can invite their family and friends,” he noted. “You can really tell that it’s more than a job for these people — it’s a passion, so it’s a beautiful thing to share.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999979734420776}",neutral,0.9999979734420776,0

That’s how projects used to start.”

Imagine that: an artistic collaboration born over chatty cocktails rather than a pointed marketing strategy. Those outings most likely paired the famous furrier with legendary auteurs like Luchino Visconti and Martin Scorsese — and more recently, Wes Anderson. Who can’t easily visualize Gwyneth Paltrow as insouciant Margot Tenenbaum wearing a mink over a damn tennis dress?

Such synergy — and celebration of craftsmanship — is the focus of LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton’s fourth installment of Les Journées Particulières, a look-see event that unveils 56 houses within the mega luxury brand — including Fendi (natch), Bulgari, Givenchy, Christian Dior and Dom Pérignon — across four continents. The event takes place Oct. 12-14 in 14 countries with over 3,000 LVMH artisans, from couturiers to tailors to vintners, showing their mettle in live exhibitions and insider tours. (Case in point: See Bulgari creative director Lucia Silvestri roughly conceptualize a million-dollar bauble in under a minute.)

In Rome, less than a week before the 13th annual film festival, early birds can visit Fendi’s pop-up cinema at their Mussolini-commissioned headquarters Palazzo della Civiltà Italianato and take in their short experimental film. “You can use movies to experiment,” says Fendi, who produced the recent remake Suspiria starring Dakota Johnson and Tilda Swinton. “You can do things that you would not have the courage to do for a fashion show.”

That’s a tall statement from a label that just showed “giant pockets” on the outside of dresses, shirts and anoraks for spring 2019 on the runway in Milan. At the Fendi HQ, you can also watch artisans at work crafting leather goods and clothes. Take a moment to stroll by the 28 statues representing various industries and trades that are tucked into arches outside the travertine building, too.

EXCLUSIVE: LVMH Names Sophie Brocart as CEO of Jean Patou - WWD,"Thu, 11 Oct 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vd3dkLmNvbS9mZWF0dXJlL2x2bWgtc29waGllLWJyb2NhcnQtY2VvLWplYW4tcGF0b3UtMTIwMjg3NjA2MS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS — LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton has named Sophie Brocart chief executive officer of Jean Patou, signaling its commitment to reviving the dormant fashion house under the creative direction of Guillaume Henry, WWD has learned.

Brocart, senior vice president of fashion ventures at LVMH Fashion Group, joins the brand from Nicholas Kirkwood, where she held the position of ceo since 2015. Her successor at the London-based footwear brand will be named shortly, LVMH said.

Sidney Toledano, chairman and ceo of LVMH Fashion Group, welcomed her appointment, which confirms the group’s commitment to promoting talents from within its own ranks. “With Guillaume Henry, a talented designer, Sophie is charged with reviving this iconic house, which marked the history of fashion and fragrance. I wish her great success,” he said in a statement.

Brocart has been a key behind-the-scenes talent scout at LVMH, where she has mentored the winners of the annual LVMH Prize for Young Designers. She has also held positions at the group’s headquarters, and at brands including Louis Vuitton and Celine.

Last March, Henry exited Nina Ricci and he is said to be passionate about the legacy of Patou, a French designer considered one of the great names of couture of the Twenties and Thirties, prized for the glamour and showmanship he brought to high fashion.

LVMH is now in the throes of building teams around Henry with a view to launching the first collection of ready-to-wear and accessories in the second half of 2019.

It is understood the group views Patou as something of a niche, rarified name — and not its next megabrand. Consequently, LVMH will likely start with a single boutique, most likely in Paris, along with e-commerce and select wholesale partners.

The relaunch suggests the world’s largest luxury group is anticipating an easing of the streetwear craze, and a swing of the fashion pendulum back to sophisticated chic. LVMH acquired the Patou brand from London-based Designer Parfums, whose founder and ceo Dilesh Mehta was looking for a partner to revive the fashion house.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999219179153442}",neutral,0.9999219179153442,0

Free spirits Having pioneered a new cool for men at Louis Vuitton, Kim Jones has taken up the creative reins at Dior Homme. At Louis Vuitton, his inspired mix of tailoring, sportswear and luxury fabrics set the tone for a style without borders, underpinned by a passion for travel which he shared with the legendary trunk-maker. His first collection for Dior took an entirely different direction, in line with his personal evolution and that of the identity of a Maison founded on a certain classicism. Here, a glamorous mood was offset with touches of romance and humor, and flawless tailoring with subtle vintage influences – another of the designer’s passions – as Kim Jones set out a vision where respect for tradition flirted with a freer, contemporary spirit. Trained at London’s Central Saint Martins (an incubator of creative talent with which LVMH has a long-standing partnership), the designer is also actively involved behind the scenes. A team player who likes to know what is happening on the ground, he does not hesitate to engage directly with customers instore. In fact, he is so passionately committed to the cause that he decided not to keep his own label, but rather to explore the extraordinary possibilities of fashion’s major players.

Another evolution which has been eagerly observed since June 2018 is that of Louis Vuitton menswear, which is now in the hands of the American designer Virgil Abloh. An LVMH Prize finalist in 2015, an architect by training and an accomplished DJ, the founder of the It-label Off-White is one of the pioneers of the street-chic-sport trend. Virgil Abloh has an innate sense of creativity and an instinctive avant-garde approach which enable him to capture the mood on the streets and mix it up like nobody else… At a time when fashion is breaking the boundaries of culture and gender, who better than he to define a style that embraces global influences? If his appointment, and subsequently his first collection, created a buzz, his sense of movement and juxtaposition, his silhouettes infused with energy from here and elsewhere, his use of vibrant color, his wearable clothes and desirable bags, all feel truly enduring, like the traits of a forceful personality. Virgil Abloh or the art of mixing luxury and streetwear.

« Every case is different. There is no rule, only exceptions »

Every case is different. There is no rule, only exceptions. In this context, January 2019 will see the début at Berluti of Kris Van Assche who, after 11 years at Dior Homme (where he succeeded Hedi Slimane), will take the helm of a Maison renowned for its instantly identifiable tradition with a twist. The designer’s finely tuned tailoring, keen attention to detail and respect for artisanal techniques, which he constantly strives to update, make him the ideal candidate to extend with rigor and intelligence the scope of a historic label which came to fashion, be it made-to-measure or ready-to-wear, barely seven years ago.

To interpret their desires and ideas, the creative directors of these Maisons can count on other talents which, though they operate in the shadows, are equally indispensable: the committed craftsmen and women, whose experience and expertise bring a designer’s vision to life. Archive inspirations and contemporary influences are the heartbeat of LVMH. And of every customer who wants to share the dream.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999866485595703}",neutral,0.9999866485595703,0

The art in our retail spaces sparks emotion while instantly transmitting the values of the Maison.

Beyond their patronage initiatives, LVMH and its Maisons have since the early 2000s actively promoted a unique blend of art and architecture that transforms the customer experience and shares this passion for beautiful objects with the largest possible number of people.

LVMH has always nurtured a passionate relationship with the world of art, a source of inspiration for exceptional products that are the fruit of masterful craftsmanship and rare skills.

Art de vivre and art

A monumental sculpture, a copper arc rises from the lagoon with metallic arms that reflect the rays of the sun. At the Cheval Blanc Rhandeli hotel in the Maldives, artist Vincent Beaurin plays with water and light in both the rooms and the landscape. Cheval Blanc, the hospitality brand of LVMH, transforms a journey into multifaceted invitations. Its unforgettable Maisons and horizons offer escapades where guests discover a unique collection of contemporary artworks. As captivating expressions of unique experiences, these singular creations are inseparable from an exceptional art de vivre.

At Cheval Blanc Courchevel, Bruno Peinado’s mirrored Trojan Horse, Xavier Veilhan’s bear, seemingly sculpted from snow, or the immense pearl necklace by Jean-Michel Othoniel all open fresh poetic perspectives for guests. The soon to reopen Cheval Blanc Saint Barth Isle de France will unveil the Constellation of Pegasus, a giant mobile by Jean-Michel Othoniel set in the heart of a tropical paradise conceived by garden designer Madison Cox.

LVMH welcomes creativity to the center of its different universes not simply to kindle sensations, but also to explore meaning. There is an osmosis between excellence and innovative expressiveness. When Hennessy invited the art collective Marshmallow Laser Feast to create an installation for its “Founder’s Cellar” in Cognac – where its most precious eaux-de-vie are carefully stored – the idea was to pay tribute to the sublime, inspired skill and almost spiritual dedication of the master blender. Entitled “The Quest”, an amazing galaxy of almost immaterial crystals is intersected by light and enriched by sound, a celebration of the pinnacle of excellence that can be reached when prodigious nature and virtuoso artisans meet…","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9377098679542542}",neutral,0.9377098679542542,0

Is Hedi Slimane’s Celine Paris debut just like ‘a second YSL’? - Style,"Tue, 02 Oct 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjbXAuY29tL21hZ2F6aW5lcy9zdHlsZS9mYXNoaW9uLWJlYXV0eS9hcnRpY2xlLzIxNjY2MjcvaGVkaS1zbGltYW5lcy1jZWxpbmUtZGVidXQtbHZtaC1wYXJpcy1mYXNoaW9uLXdlZWvSAXZodHRwczovL2FtcC5zY21wLmNvbS9tYWdhemluZXMvc3R5bGUvZmFzaGlvbi1iZWF1dHkvYXJ0aWNsZS8yMTY2NjI3L2hlZGktc2xpbWFuZXMtY2VsaW5lLWRlYnV0LWx2bWgtcGFyaXMtZmFzaGlvbi13ZWVr?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"It was youthful, it was black, it was rock ‘n’ roll. Tailoring was skinny where bodies were covered at all. Unsurprisingly, it looked a lot like Kering’s Saint Laurent.

Star designer Hedi Slimane revealed his first collection for LVMH’s Celine brand in Paris on Friday in the most anticipated runway show of September’s fashion weeks.

Under Slimane, who is returning to fashion after a two-year hiatus, the French luxury conglomerate wants to double or triple Celine’s sales within five years, adding new product categories to transform it into a megabrand on the scale of Christian Dior or Prada.

Here’s how the designer’s new vision for Celine could affect the luxury sector’s bottom line.

The man

Slimane is best known for setting the menswear agenda for over a decade when he brought back skinny suits and jeans at Dior Homme in the early 2000s, prompting men around the world to retire their flouncy trousers and pay a premium for form-fitting looks.

During a subsequent four-year tenure at Kering’s Yves Saint Laurent, he turned the floundering French fashion house into a commercial force.

He put in place an ultra-branded, black-and-white aesthetic for marketing campaigns while mining the house’s archives to pull together retro, rocker-chic looks that put a California spin on French luxury.

Slimane filled Saint Laurent’s shelves with biker jackets, sleek handbags and easy-selling US$450 low-top trainers.

The brand

Celine, a Parisian accessories brand founded in 1945, was elevated by designer Phoebe Philo, who left last year after a 10-year stint during which her designs were lauded for their intellectual, grown-up woman chic.

While star products such as the US$3,000 Phantom handbag and US$500 Edge sunglasses increased revenue to roughly €1 billion (US$1.16 billion), Philo remained committed to niche positioning, shunning e-commerce and social media.

Slimane’s mandate is to scale up the brand, expanding into menswear, fragrances and haute couture.

The challenge

The move by LVMH’s CEO Bernard Arnault to tap a star designer at Celine could be seen as a riposte to arch-rival Kering, which reported 25 per cent growth last year, with its hip Gucci and Balenciaga properties outpacing competitors.

For LVMH to meet its revenue target of €2 billion to €3 billion for Celine, the label will need to expand by as much as 15 per cent a year. That is at least three times the pace of the global luxury market, according to consultancy Bain.

Sector experts seemed unconcerned ahead of the show.

LVMH – whose other brands include Louis Vuitton, Dior and Fendi – is the world’s largest luxury goods maker and France’s most valuable company and has unrivalled investment firepower to promote Slimane’s Celine.

“[Hedi Slimane is] a brand in himself, and anything he touches makes money,” Gachoucha Kretz, marketing professor at HEC Paris business school, said.

The rival

Since Slimane’s departure from Saint Laurent, that brand’s growth has continued.

New designer Anthony Vaccarello has made his mark on ready-to-wear collections with a sexed-up, 1980s aesthetic and cinematic runway shows against the backdrop of the Eiffel Tower. But the brand has largely remained within the outlines of Slimane’s monochromatic, youth-focused template.

“If Celine is going to grow significantly, and I believe it will, the question is from which brand it will take market share,” Mario Ortelli, a luxury consultant, said before the show.

Saint Laurent is one label that could be affected “due to its price point as well as its recent heritage with the designer”, Ortelli said.

The look

The mood and references of Slimane’s Celine debut were Parisian where his Saint Laurent had been Californian.

Tailoring was slim, but not skin-tight. Long-time fans of Slimane’s look celebrated. “King is back”, posted the record producer and Polish reality-TV star Maja Sablewska.

The skimpy, rock-groupie-inspired womenswear looks were enough to burn devotees of his predecessor’s arch aesthetic in one go, however.

There are now two YSLs in town. I was hoping for a bit more evolution James Scully, casting director, Instagram post

Little satisfied with the brand’s statement that the covered-up menswear looks would all be marketed as unisex, they decried the collection as disrespectful and retrograde in a flurry of Instagram comments before the show had even ended.

Runway critics and junior stylists wondered why LVMH had not given Slimane his own brand rather than imposing his singular vision on Celine.

“There are now two YSLs in town,” casting director James Scully commented on Instagram following the show. “I was hoping for a bit more evolution.”

Don’t expect any of this to shake Slimane’s devotion to his trademark skinny look.

“I found my style more than 20 years ago, unless it’s the other way around,” he said in a rare interview with French newspaper Le Figaro on Tuesday.

“It passes through a line, a stroke, an appearance, a silhouette that I have been obsessively pursuing since.”

And because Mr. Arnault, 26, is (despite being 26) the president and chief executive of a luggage company with nearly half a billion euros in annual revenue, he may be in Cologne, Germany, where that luggage is made and where he briefly relocated, or in his hometown, Paris, where he has returned and opened an international sales and marketing office, or in London, where he often has business to attend to, or New York, where he recently hosted a dinner for 120 to celebrate the new look of said luggage, or in Los Angeles, where friends like Evan Spiegel, the 28-year-old chief executive of Snap, the parent company of Snapchat, are based.

So to cross his path requires a fair amount of commitment, not to mention a travel stipend. He is well positioned to observe what he calls “airport market share,” which a layman might call hanging out by the baggage carousel, just watching the wheels go ‘round and ‘round.

“If you follow me on Instagram, you see that,” he said last week. “Just a lot of stories of suitcases everywhere.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999977350234985}",neutral,0.9999977350234985,0
Luxury labels are going direct-to-consumer - Yahoo Finance,"Wed, 10 Oct 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9sdXh1cnktbGFiZWxzLWdvaW5nLWRpcmVjdC1jb25zdW1lci0xNDU2MTE1OTkuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"FILE PHOTO: A woman with a Louis Vuitton-branded shopping bag looks towards the entrance of a branch store by LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton in Vienna, Austria October 4, 2018.

The idea of selling fashion straight to shoppers sounds simple enough, but how often it happens today represents a big shift in retail. For decades, retailers that collected brands under one roof were industry power brokers, playing a lead role in determining which labels shoppers bought, or even knew existed, and helping to shape their images. Plenty of labels had their own stores, but establishing a global network of shops to reach all potential customers could be prohibitively expensive and complicated. Many brands, especially in luxury fashion, instead relied on multi-brand retailers to be their main connection to shoppers.

But thanks in large part to the growth of e-commerce and social media, brands are able to connect—and sell—directly to customers themselves (pdf), shifting the balance of power between the brands and retailers. Those leaning into this shift aren’t just digitally native upstarts like Everlane, Bonobos, and others that built their businesses on the idea of cutting out the middleman. Labels across the spectrum are doing it, through a combination of e-commerce and their own stores, up through and including top luxury labels. (Sorry, they’re still charging the same retail prices so as not to undercut those wholesale partners who are still important.)

According to an analysis of financial filings from LVMH, Kering, and Richemont—three of the world’s biggest luxury conglomerates—by Gartner L2, a business-intelligence firm, the companies have substantially increased the percentage of annual sales they get from their brands’ directly operated stores and e-commerce over the past decade. Their brands include names like Louis Vuitton and Celine (LVMH); Gucci, Saint Laurent, and Balenciaga (Kering); and Cartier, Azzedine Alaïa, and Chloé (Richemont).

DTC sales by luxury conglomerates

The numbers are notable given that luxury was notoriously slow in embracing digital sales. “They’ve been some of the longest holdouts on really just having a [business-to-consumer] business,” says Lauren Price, director of client strategy for luxury and specialty retail at Gartner L2. A decade ago consumers were still proving that they would buy high-end products like a $5,000 dress online, and brands were unsure how to replicate their high-touch store experiences on a website, let alone one viewed through a smartphone.

Story continues

But the investments they made years ago in their digital businesses are increasingly paying off, leading brands to keep building out their operations, Price says, and while stores still account for the great majority of direct sales, e-commerce is driving a lot of the growth.

There are numerous benefits for luxury brands doing more of their sales straight to shoppers, whether those transactions happen in stores or online. They have more control over how a product is presented, the story around it, the images and description of it, and what items it’s next to—all critical components in projecting a high-end image. The margins are also better, since a retailer isn’t taking a cut of the sale. Not least, brands get direct access to a rich array of customer data that they don’t typically get from wholesale partners.

Direct sales do come at a cost. Brands must maintain stores and websites, plus handle logistics and all those costly returns. Price points out that it isn’t enough to just build an e-commerce shop and expect people to find it either. They have to pay for ads and other ways of driving traffic.

But to brands, the returns are worthwhile. “The reason why we’ve developed a bigger direct-to-consumer business is because it’s critical today to have a customer understand you, inside and out,” Theory CEO Andrew Rosen told Glossy recently (paywall). “We simply can’t do that in the same way with outside retailers, whether it’s Saks or Neiman or Bergdorf.”

Organic sales grew 11 per cent compared to the same period last year and by 13 per cent after excluding the impact of the closed DFS concessions at Hong Kong International Airport at the end of the year. Every geographic market performed well, the company said. Third quarter revenue was up 10 per cent.

The wines & spirits business group recorded organic revenue growth of 7 per cent during the first nine months, with Champagne volumes stable and Hennessy cognac volumes increased by 4 per cent, led by the US and Chinese markets.

The fashion & leather goods business group achieved organic revenue growth of 14 per cent and 20 per cent reported, with the flagship Louis Vuitton brand the standout performer.

“Ready-to-wear and shoes, in particular, experienced strong momentum with an excellent reception of the last two fashion shows of womenswear and menswear,” the company said in a statement. “A new communication for Louis Vuitton perfumes was unveiled, marking the launch of the brand’s latest perfume creation. Christian Dior, consolidated since the second half of last year, enjoyed an excellent performance.

Celine made progress and began a new chapter in its history with the first runway show of Hedi Slimane, which was a great success and created enormous resonance. Fendi and Loro Piana continued to grow. The other brands continued to strengthen,” the company said.

LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton’s perfumes & cosmetics business group recorded organic revenue growth of 14 per cent, driven in particular by the performance of its star brands Christian Dior, Guerlain and Givenchy.

The watches & jewellery business group achieved organic revenue growth of 14 per cent, with Bulgari delivering “an excellent performance and gaining market share”.

The selective retailing business group achieved organic revenue growth of 8 per cent in the first nine months of 2018, and 14 per cent excluding the airport concession closures in Hong Kong.

Sephora’s organic revenue growth was strong, particularly in North America and Asia. The expansion and renovation of its distribution network is continuing with a new store concept in China and the first Sephora-branded store in Russia.

“DFS performed well, especially in Hong Kong and Macao. The recent openings of T Galleria in Cambodia and Italy progressed well.”

The company said that in an “uncertain geopolitical and monetary context, LVMH will continue to be vigilant” in the months ahead.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 1.0}",positive,1.0,1

Nov 23, 2015

The Cova pastry shop brand has opened its first café-restaurant and a gift store in Beijing. ""The opening in the Chinese capital is part of a regeneration and expansion path that started in 2013, after the brand was acquired by the group,"" the latter has stated in a press release.







The Cova pastry shop-café in Beijing - LVMH



Both new stores have been conceived by Italian architect and designer Ferruccio Laviani, and are located in the prestigious Seasons Place shopping mall, at the heart of Beijing's financial district. The architect's work was inspired by Milan's very first Cova café, which first came into being in 1817 in Piazza della Scala, and established the reputation of this nearly two centuries-old enterprise.

The brand launched internationally some twenty years ago and has struck several franchising deals with cafés in Asia. It has been present in China, notably in Hong Kong since the 1990s and in Shanghai since 2010, as well as in Japan.

Exclusive: LVMH-backed Bateel open to stake sale as it eyes expansion - The National,"Wed, 31 Oct 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZW5hdGlvbmFsbmV3cy5jb20vYnVzaW5lc3MvZXhjbHVzaXZlLWx2bWgtYmFja2VkLWJhdGVlbC1vcGVuLXRvLXN0YWtlLXNhbGUtYXMtaXQtZXllcy1leHBhbnNpb24tMS43ODYzMTbSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Bateel International, the confectionery company in which French luxury group LVMH has a 26 per cent stake, is open to selling more stakes to strategic investors as it embarks on a $200 million (Dh734.5m) investment to finance expansion, its chief executive said.

“If we can find equity at a reasonable price we are happy to invite investors,” said Ata Atmar.

“When you grow very fast and get into large scale capacity building, equity is necessary because you can’t leverage too much.”

Bateel, which started in Saudi Arabia selling premium dates in 1992, is expanding its operations into Asia and may spend as much as $200m over the next three to four years, he said.

“If we can find equity at a reasonable price we are happy to invite investors,” said Ata Atmar. Antonie Robertson/The National) Journalist: Dania Saadi. Section: Business.

The private equity arm of LVMH, the owners of Louis Vuitton, bought a stake in Bateel in 2015 as the confectionery and restaurant chain company was undertaking expansion.

The majority of the company is owned by the Al Sudairi family from Saudi Arabia and they are open to relinquishing control of the company. The family owns the date farms in Al Ghat, around 250km away from the capital Riyadh.

“The shareholders are very open and they are not hung up on keeping control. With the right price, right strategy and right partner we are open to discussing various options,” Mr Atmar said.

The company, which had held discussions to go public, has put off the decision for now as it waits for better market conditions and focuses on expanding the business further.

The company had looked at London and Nasdaq Dubai to list its shares, but no decision has been made yet.

“We have had an interest from some markets that wanted us to go public but I think that is a few years delayed given the last two to three years of economic conditions in the region,” he said. “We are at least three years away before we are ready for an IPO given our business plans. We want to grow further to make it a substantial IPO event.”

The company continues to tap bank financing to fund expansion beyond the 16 markets where Bateel has franchises.

""Now we are growing through less capital intensive processes, whether through franchising or opening in duty free,"" he said. ""To truly establish the kind of presence we have in the Gulf in other markets, we need capital. Capital will be important, but at what price?""

Currently 90 per cent of the business is generated in the Arabian Gulf but Bateel wants to expand further into Asia, particularly China.

The company is interested in franchising its date store concept because it is not capital intensive.

It is also planning to expand its product range, which includes dates to date syrup. The company has a capacity to produce 4,000 tonnes of dates a year.

""We can double our sales and we have the capacity to do that without significant investments, but going beyond that we need to lay the foundation capacity to produce value-added products and produce all dates,"" he said.

Bateel wants to diversify its sources of revenue because it has achieved growth in the Gulf and is looking for new income streams.

Last year, the company posted a 17 per cent increase in revenue, but profitability continued to suffer due to prevailing economic conditions. This was an improvement from 2015-2016 when top line slowed to 4 per cent and profit declined.

“Profit growth resumed in the first half of 2018 largely due to efficiency measures, but top line growth remains a challenge for the balance of the year,” he said. “Based on recent trends in business we expect solid improvement in both top and bottom lines next year.”

Meet The 26-Year-Old CEO Of Rimowa - Live and Let's Fly,"Thu, 04 Oct 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiNGh0dHBzOi8vbGl2ZWFuZGxldHNmbHkuY29tL3JpbW93YS1hbGV4YW5kcmUtYXJuYXVsdC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The President and CEO of Rimowa Luggage is only 26 year old..and has grand plans for the luxury luggage brand. But will he save Rimowa or ruin a brand that did not need saving?

First some background. French-born Alexandre Arnault took over Rimowa 18-months ago, a storied German luggage company established in 1898. The New York Times shares:

Mr. Arnault is the driving force behind Rimowa, the German suitcase company that, as he put it, is “a 120-year-old company that was owned and run by the same family for 119 years when I got there.” Mr. Arnault, barely out of university, persuaded Rimowa’s then-chief executive, Dieter Morszeck, the grandson of its founder, to sell, and his father, Bernard Arnault, the chairman of LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, to buy, an 80 percent stake in the company, and in 2016, Rimowa became the newest addition to the LVMH luxury group.

Bernard Arnault is France’s richest man. Let’s put the envy aside for a moment and recognize, despite what privilege and fortune the young Arnualt has grown up in, he has taken on quite a daunting task.

I love Rimowa luggage and have used it for several years now. But Rimowa has traditionally appealed to a narrow subset of the population as a high-quality, functional German brand. That drives its exclusivity, but also limits its appeal.

During his short tenure, Alexandre Arnault has already made his mark. Rimowa has introduced a new logo (the style of the luggage is unchanged). Furthermore, Rimowa has begun to collaborate with other LVMH brands like Fendi to create cross products. Rimowa even teamed up with Supreme, a New York skate company, to create contemporary bags which sold out almost instantly. Thus far, Arnault’s changes have been well-received.

Here are some pictures of the new ad campaign:

images: Rimowa

CONCLUSION

The whole New York Times article is worth a read. I’m generally averse to change and liked Rimowa just the way it was. I’m also not a fan of the new logo. But by linking it to other LVMH brands, Arnault has already laid the groundwork to ensure that Rimowa remains an enduring and high-demand luxury brand.
