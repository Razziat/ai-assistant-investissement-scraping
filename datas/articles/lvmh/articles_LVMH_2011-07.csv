""She was her own fashion statement, and it's my guess, had she been able to deal with her own demons, she would have ended up shaping fashion, not the other way around. She wouldn't have sung for her style; her singing would have set the style. And the effects would have reverberated at a deeper level.""

Hermès Opens in Horniman Circle (Mumbai Boss)

""The store, the first stand-alone luxury brand boutique outside of a mall or five-star hotel in India, marks a departure for Hermès's strategy in the country, where it already has two branches in Delhi and Pune, both in hotels... The process has taken them 18 months and it is hoped that the store will inspire other businesses to help revive and restore the area.""

""LVMH has raised its stake in smaller luxury rival Hermès to 21.4 percent from 20.2 percent... The owner of the Louis Vuitton and Kenzo fashion brands, Moet & Chandon champagne and Chaumet jewelry added, however, it did not own any financial instruments, other than those disclosed, which could raise its Hermès holding further.""

""Ben Malka initially denied rumors that he would take over at Halston following its sudden meltdown two weeks ago, he confirmed that he had left BCBG Max Azria Group to do just that. Malka was the president of BCBG since 2001, and worked at the company for sixteen years, during which time he solidified BCBG's place in the contemporary womenswear market.""

What attracts foreign buyers is the emphasis on endurance, not only in the clothing, but its back stories as well."""

Luxury company boss Arnault come out on top of the business weekly magazine

Challenges annual ranking of France’s well-to-do.

The American magazine Forbes puts Arnault in fourth place in its league table of the world’s richest people.

The second richest person in France, according Challenges, is Gerard Mulliez, the founder of the Auchan supermarket chain.

He was top of the list back in 2008, but the economic crisis has hit him and his fortune is now a mere 19 billion euros.

In third place is France’s richest woman, Liliane Bettencourt, the scandal-hit L’Oréal heiress whose daughter is trying to get her judged too senile to manage her own finances.

The top 10 includes several other founders and heirs of big French luxury groups.

According to a Société Générale and Forbes poll, only one third of French fortunes are self-made. Two thirds come from inheritance – the opposite of the situation in US, China or Brazil.

Net profit amounted to 1.3 billion euros ($1.9 billion) and six-month sales rose by 13.0 percent from the equivalent figure last year to exceed 10 billion euros for the first time, the group said in a statement late on Tuesday.

Operating profit rose by 23.0 percent to 2.2 billion euros

The LVMH name owns the brands of Louis Vuitton, Givenchy, Moet & Chandon and Dom Perignon champagnes, Parfums Christian Dior and Sephora.

Chief executive Bernard Arnault said that the group looked forward to the second half of the year with confidence.

The price of LVMH shares was showing a gain of 1.23 percent to 131.60 euros in late morning trading.

LVMH also said that it now owned 21.4 percent of the capital of luxury leather goods firm Hermes from 20.21 percent in December.

The Hermes management has made clear that the arrival of LVMH as a big shareholder is unwelcome."

After a poorly received Dior haute couture show without the shamed John Galliano at the helm, Bernard Arnault, the head of LVMH, talks about the future of his luxury brand empire.

As the head of a luxury conglomerate that includes Christian Dior, Louis Vuitton, Marc Jacobs, Donna Karan and Céline to name but a few, Bernard Arnault knows more than enough about working with eccentric fashion types. Estimated to be worth $41 billion, Arnault, 62, the wealthiest man in France, talked to Newsweek about the future of his empire and the demise of John Galliano.

""Arnault suggests it's time for change, time to recast his global, glittering, status-laden empire as something else,"" writes Robin Givhan. ""The watchwords are: intimate, Old World, artful. And the timing feels right… After all, Arnault has learned that rock-star designers come and go.""

Now is the time for discrete fashion designers; Phoebe Philo - who keeps a low profile and rarely gives interviews - being the shining example of fashion talent that comes without a similar portion of drama.

""I'm surprised that I did not get a call or a word of excuse from him,"" he told Robin Givhan not long after the Galliano scandal erupted. ""After all that I did for him?""

The huge success of Céline, with Philo taking the reins in 2008 - the label has since seen triple-digit growth - would suggest that it's not a necessity to have a larger-than-life eccentric steering the ship. Galliano was often depicted as the mad pirate, frantically sailing the high seas of fashion, but Arnault clearly has a yearning for calmer waters.

John Galliano trial: 'Fashion can be very toxic'

""Phoebe has the potential. She is doing a style which is completely in line with our time,"" he says.

Sarah Burton is another example of this quiet, behind-the-scenes style of fashion guru. She took over at the helm of Alexander McQueen after McQueen committed suicide in February 2010. Arnault, he says, is turning away from the cult of personality.

Christian Dior autumn/winter 2011 show goes on

Givhan describes meeting a French seamstress who had been at Dior for 38 years, during a recent tour of the label's studios. There, a team of 200 artisans has been working away, out of the limelight, for decades.

""A lot of schools produce designers, but the technical people - this is what we have to protect,"" Sidney Toledano, Dior's current chief executive, told the magazine. ""They work very hard here, and they live outside of Paris. They are not living like the designer. They are simple people. Some of them have a difficult life. They have their feet on the ground.""

Toledano adds, ""They're sustaining the house.""

But Arnault puts it most poetically. ""From time to time, the Vienna Philharmonic could play without a conductor because they are so good,"" he says. ""But that cannot last forever. We want to make the best choice for the house and find the best conductor."""

LVMH on Tuesday announced the appointment of Humberto Leon and Carol Lim as artistic directors of the ready-to-wear label Kenzo with immediate effect.

They replace Sardinian designer Antonio Marras, who has held the post for eight years and who shows his own name label in Milan,

“After eight successful years, LVMH and Antonio Marras have decided to end their collaboration,” LVMH said in a statement, without giving details.



“Humberto Leon and Carol Lim will bring to Kenzo the freshness of their creative talent to give a new boost to this emblematic house.

I am sure they will succeed in positioning the brand on the road to an ambitious development,” Pierre-Yves Roussel, chief executive of the fashion division of LVMH, said.

The appointments follow the arrival in January of a new chief executive, Eric Marechalle, at the helm of Kenzo.

It has been seen as an indication by analysts of LVMH chief Bernard Arnault’s desire to revitalise the label amid persistent rumours that it was going to be sold.

Leon and Lim, both 36, made their name with Opening Ceremony, the fashion concept and New York based multi-label boutiques they founded in 2002.

They will now share their time between New York and Paris.

Kenzo was created in 1970 by the Japanese designer Kenzo Takada, who sold the house in 1993 to LVMH and retired in 1999. It has around 100 boutiques worldwide.
