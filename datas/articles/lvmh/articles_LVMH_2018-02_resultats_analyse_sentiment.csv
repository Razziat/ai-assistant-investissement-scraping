"Pierre Godé, Top Adviser to France's Richest Man, Dies at 73 (Published 2018) - The New York Times","Fri, 02 Feb 2018 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMTgvMDIvMDIvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9waWVycmUtZ29kZS1sdm1oLWRlYWQuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Pierre Godé, a French lawyer whose steely negotiation skills and strategic vision made him the éminence grise of the world’s largest luxury group, LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, has died in Nice, France. He was 73.

The group said in a statement on Friday that he died after a long illness, but it did not specify a cause or say when he died.

Polished, charming and deliberately low profile, Mr. Godé was for 30 years rarely far from the side of Bernard Arnault, LVMH’s chairman and chief executive. The two men set about building a brand portfolio that today includes more than 70 fashion houses, among them Louis Vuitton, Christian Dior and Bulgari.

Mr. Godé and Mr. Arnault met in 1973, when Mr. Godé was the youngest qualified law professor in France and a lawyer to Mr. Arnault’s father, Jean, the head of a property company.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9986081719398499}",neutral,0.9986081719398499,0
Chart of the Week | LVMH Cash Cow Nears $12 Billion in Sales - The Business of Fashion,"Wed, 07 Feb 2018 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzb2ZmYXNoaW9uLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy9sdXh1cnkvY2hhcnQtb2YtdGhlLXdlZWstbG91aXMtdnVpdHRvbi1sdm1ocy0xMi1iaWxsaW9uLWhlYXZ5d2VpZ2h0L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS, France — Louis Vuitton remains the world's largest and most profitable luxury brand. According to estimates by Sanford C. Bernstein, the luxury megabrand earned €9.6 billion in revenue (almost $12 billion), with earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) of more than €4 billion in 2017, making up almost half of the operating profit in the entire LVMH empire.

The French luxury conglomerate posted another fiscal year of record revenues and operating income last month. Revenue rose to €42.5 billion, a 13 percent increase year-on-year, while group operating income was 8.3 billion euros, up 18 percent. But while LVMH itself does not breakout results for its individual brands, Bernstein estimated revenues and profits for each of the LVMH's brands and the results show just how important Louis Vuitton is to the overall LVMH business.

The group's fashion and leather goods division posted revenues of €15.5 billion ($19 billion), up 13 percent year-on-year, making up about 36.3 percent of the overall LVMH business, but accounting for 59.1 percent of the group’s profits, with earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) of €4.9 billion ($6.1 billion). Meanwhile the selective retailing business, which includes multi-brand beauty giant Sephora, accounts for another third of the business — 31.2 percent of revenues. Watches and jewellery, perfumes and cosmetics, and wines and spirits account for approximately 10 percent each.

But it is Louis Vuitton that is the driving force of the group, capturing 22.5 percent of revenues — estimated to be €9.6 billion — and accounting for a staggering 48.4 percent of overall EBIT, with an EBIT margin of 42 percent.But it is Louis Vuitton that is the driving force of the group, capturing 22.5 percent of revenues — estimated to be €9.6 billion — and accounting for a staggering 48.4 percent of overall EBIT, with an EBIT margin of 42 percent. No other brand in the group even comes close. Christian Dior Couture accounts for about 5.2 percent of group sales and Fendi for 2.7 percent of sales, eight times less than Louis Vuitton, and at 21 percent, Céline reported the third highest EBIT margin, half that of Louis Vuitton.

Is LVMH's fashion and leather goods division overly reliant on a single megabrand?

“The problem is when the key brand loses traction, but Vuitton is an incredible asset because it’s the biggest brand by size in luxury overall and also the brand with the highest profitability,” said Mario Ortelli, a senior luxury goods analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein. “That’s why the company is aiming to keep the brand up and running by continuing product innovation and improving its digital strategy.”

But looking ahead, Céline could be the fashion and leather division's new star. While it accounted for only €950 million in sales — 2.2 percent of the group's total revenues — in 2017, the recent appointment of Hedi Slimane as artistic, image and creative director signals LVMH chief executive and chairman Bernard Arnault's commercial ambitions for Céline, especially as the label nears the €1 billion mark. ""Slimane in the past has had fantastic results at Dior Homme and Saint Laurent,"" said Ortelli of the new hire.

Under Slimane, Céline is set to expand into men’s, couture and fragrance and LVMH has re-evaluated its growth plan for the label, establishing a revenue target of €2 billion to €3 billion within the next five years. This means Céline could surpass Fendi and Christian Dior by 2023. But as the round of designer musical chairs speeds up, “the risk for LVMH is if Mr Slimane loses his commitment to this project over time,” said Ortelli.

It also means the conglomerate will continue with its opportunistic mergers and acquisitions strategy. While Arnault has said he will “probably wait for the next crisis” to make additions to the group’s portfolio, the group is not actively pursuing targets because valuations are sky-high. “But be sure that LVMH will look for acquisitions of any brand with good heritage, good positioning and the relevant size if it comes up for sale,” said Ortelli.

Editor's Note: This article was revised on February 7, 2017. A previous version of this article misstated that Christian Dior Couture revenues in 2017 were €1.17 billion. In fact, 2017 revenues for Christian Dior were €2.23 billion.

The latest brand to get backing from the programme is New York’s Stadium Goods.

Details on what role LVMH Luxury Ventures will take in the reseller are unclear, although it is rumored that this backing could allow Stadium Goods to expand. The store — which is the location for most Sneaker Shopping episodes — has been open for just over two years and the team behind have previously told WWD about potential plans to move into merch and open a second physical location. Back in 2017, prior to LVMH’s backing, Stadium Goods raised $4.6 million USD in equity funding and was predicted to gross more than $100 million USD in 2017.

"At Home with Stéphanie Watine Arnault, the Fashion Royal and Founder of Clos19 - W Magazine","Fri, 23 Feb 2018 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndtYWdhemluZS5jb20vc3Rvcnkvc3RlcGhhbmllLXdhdGluZS1hcm5hdWx0LWNsb3MtMTktbHZtaC1ob21l0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"It’s not easy being an Arnault. “The family name is a lot of responsibility,” says Stéphanie Watine Arnault of her rather high-class dilemma. “Failure is not an option.” Not that the 34-year-old niece of the LVMH chairman and CEO, Bernard Arnault, has had any trouble entering the family fray. Last year, she launched Clos19, a digital platform that offers a range of luxe entertaining options, centered around Dom Pérignon, Moët & ­Chandon, and Krug, all part of LVMH’s stable of champagne and fine spirits brands. “We’re not selling bottles, we’re selling lifestyle, with a touch of hedonism,” says the blonde Parisienne, whose drink of choice is a martini with “just the zest of the lemon” before, or perhaps after, dinner.

Clos19—named for the French term for a walled vineyard and the 19th century, when champagne began being widely consumed—has launched in the U.S., the U.K., and Germany, and will send everything and ­everyone you need to stage the perfect soirée: hard-to-find vintages, mixologists, glassware, sommeliers, and waiters. But as an “experience” business, the company can also take you on a tour of the finest wineries in France, or even to Antarctica on one of its catered adventures (a $94,500-per-person, eight-day trip includes champagne at the South Pole). “We live so much through the screen, it’s good to focus on creating wonderful happenings in real life,” Watine Arnault says. “I knew Clos19 needed to be a digital company, but I’m still the sort of person who likes to send handwritten Christmas cards.”

She’s also the sort of person who knows a thing or two about throwing a party. This past September, she married Cyrille-Alexandre Joly, a civil engineer she first met when she was 20; their wedding reception took place at La Colle Noire, the château in the South of France acquired by Christian Dior in 1951 that is now owned by LVMH. At her wedding, there were roses everywhere—“Dior loved them,” she says—and the bride wore a billowing Dior gown for the ceremony. “It was tulle because I wanted something light. I couldn’t be a bride in a 90-pound dress.” For the dance party, she changed into another dress, this one inspired by the Junon design from Dior’s fall 1949 collection, with an exquisitely petalled skirt. The 135 guests sat at a 164-foot-long table and drank Moët & Chandon from 1983, her birth year. “It had been a warm summer,” she says, smiling, “and you could taste the sweetness in the champagne.”

Watine Arnault was born in the north of France, in Roubaix, near the farm where her father trained horses. In 1990, the family moved to Paris, where she “never left the 7th arrondissement until I moved to New York in 2006. I’ve known the local florist, Monsieur Moulié, in the Place du Palais Bourbon, all my life. He used to give me peonies when I was little.” She grew up steeped in art and design. Her mother, Dominique—Bernard’s sister—ran the Etude Dominique Watine Arnault ­auction house and then became the president of Fred, the jeweler owned by LVMH, until her untimely death, in 2006, when Stéphanie was just 22. “She had impeccable taste and knew everyone in the French art world,” Watine Arnault recalls. “But when it came to my own career, I knew I was more interested in business than art.”

After studying for a master’s degree in marketing and strategy at l’Université Paris-Dauphine, Watine Arnault headed to Marc Jacobs in Manhattan, where she worked on product development. “We came up with the Mercer, the soft bag with studs on the side, that—crucially, back then—had to be the right size for a laptop,” she says. Returning to Paris, she got an MBA in entrepreneurship at INSEAD, the quintessential French-business boot camp, driving to classes every day through the Fontainebleau forest in her Mercedes SLK with the top down. “Even in the winter! There’s nothing better than the smell of the trees.”

Now she and Joly live close to Hyde Park, in London, where they moved in 2011. At first, they rented a mews house in Marylebone—“cute but dark,” Watine Arnault says. It took them two years to find the South Kensington aerie they now call home. After an extensive renovation by the British designers March & White, the pair moved in a year ago. The hallway, with its rough brick walls and huge skylight, feels like a slice of Manhattan; the elegant sitting room, with its painted-panel walls, is pure Paris. “I wanted to reflect the cities I love,” she says. “But most of all, I wanted to be comfortable, surrounded by things with meaning. I hate the idea of living in a museum.”

Many of her most treasured pieces she inherited from her mother: a pair of occasional tables with curving gold legs by the French designer Elizabeth Garouste; a northern-French beach scene by Massimo Vitali; a painting of Lake Maggiore by Valerio Adami so magnificently large it had to be taken out of its frame and rolled up to get it into the apartment. The luscious flower arrangements Watine Arnault does herself. “Freesia and roses—I get them from Whole Foods on Kensington High Street. I was in a nail bar and overheard another woman say how good their flowers were. It turns out it was good advice!”

Layered among the family heirlooms are more recent acquisitions, which signal Watine Arnault’s own deepening taste: a pair of jaunty paintings by the young French artist Camille Henrot and a remarkable work by the Japanese artist Chiharu Shiota, in which a child’s dress is entrapped in a web of intricately woven red thread. “My husband thinks it’s really creepy,” she says, laughing. Some of the Baccarat on tables comes from the first of her two wedding registries—one was online at Le Bon Marché, the other analog at Dior. “They haven’t gone digital at Dior yet,” she notes in amazement, though, as it happens, her older brother, Ludovic, is working on that initiative right now.

Meanwhile, Watine Arnault runs her own business from offices near Victoria Station. “It’s a small team,” she says. “Fifteen great people whom I need to inspire. People will only do what they want, so you have to make sure they want what you want.” Surely, Uncle Bernard would agree.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999852180480957}",neutral,0.9999852180480957,0

The London-based label is the work of husband-and-wife duo Léa Dickely and Hung La, who between them have an impressive decade of combined experience working for Rick Owens, Balenciaga, Alexander McQueen and Céline. “It was never our intention to start a brand,” says La, but when the pair found themselves free from in-house roles for the first time, it appeared the next logical step. “We thought the best way to challenge ourselves and to empower ourselves would be to start something of our own,” he continues.

Having met at Antwerp’s prestigious Royal Academy - La is American-Vietnamese and Dickely is French - the couple bonded over cinema. In fact, their first date was spent watching The Shining and their label takes its name from Japanese director Masaki Kobayashi’s 1965 film, based on a series of traditional ghost stories.
