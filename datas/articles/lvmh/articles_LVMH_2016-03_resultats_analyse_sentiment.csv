LVMH Shines Light on the Young Designer Set (Published 2016) - The New York Times,"Thu, 03 Mar 2016 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMTYvMDMvMDQvZmFzaGlvbi9wYXJpcy1mYXNoaW9uLXdlZWstbHZtaC1wcml6ZS5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS — For the third year running, the office doors of LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton on Avenue Montaigne were thrown open for the presentation of the shortlisted candidates for the LVMH prize for emerging designers, those younger than 40 with at least two collections under their belts.

The designers with the 23 shortlisted labels come from around the world (the expected fashion capitals of New York, London and Paris, but also Copenhagen; Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia; and Tehran, among others) and have a chance to win 300,000 euros ($326,000) and a year of mentorship from the well-oiled LVMH machine.

The added bonus, even for those who do not make the culling to eight finalists and then to the winner, is the audience with fashion’s major players that the selection affords: the LVMH group’s creative directors who will make the final choice, including Karl Lagerfeld, whose arrival occasioned the most extended deployment of flashes, but also the editors, retailers and megamodels on the selection committee that winnowed the initial 1,000 applications.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.999950647354126}",neutral,0.999950647354126,0
Kanye West and LVMH-Approved: Meet Designer Matthew Williams - W Magazine,"Wed, 02 Mar 2016 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndtYWdhemluZS5jb20vc3RvcnkvbWF0dGhldy13aWxsaWFtcy1hbHl4LWx2bWgtcHJpemUtMjAxNtIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"When Alyx founder and creative director Matthew Williams was a teenager, he convinced his grandmother to buy him a skate shirt that, unbeknownst to her, said “F—k you.” At first glance, it was just an abstract logo — the profanity only appeared when the fabric was folded in half — but Williams was tickled to get away with it whenever he wore it to school. It was the perfect crime for a fashion-obsessed boy and the sort of mischief he’s still getting away today, only now they’re of his own design.

This punk subversion mixed with thoughtful craftsmanship perfectly sums up Alyx, a fashion label he launched in New York last February with a catalogue done by longtime friend and collaborator, Nick Knight. And it’s precisely why the discriminating judges of the lucrative LVMH Prize for Young Fashion Designers has shortlisted Williams alongside such high-profile emerging talent like Brandon Maxwell (Lady Gaga’s stylist) and Christelle Kocher (who was shortlisted last year as well).

“It’s always been my goal to have my own brand, so I started it as soon as I could,” he said from Paris for the prize’s semifinalists presentation, which will take place between Wednesday and Thursday.

Although only in its third season, Williams, 30, has been embedded in the art and fashion scene for over a decade. He started working in clothing production right after high school in Los Angeles, where he learned pattern-making with denim and jersey, and later transitioned to designing costumes for musical artists. Eventually, he found his way to Lady Gagaand then to Kanye West two years ago as the art director ofDonda, West’s creative agency. Williams has also worked with brands like Nike, Hood by Air, Supreme, Stussy, and founded the popular DJ and art collective Been Trill with Heron Preston and Virgil Abloh. Today, cool kids like Luka Sabbat and Sarah Snyder can be spotted on Instagram wearing his designs.

Williams really doesn’t want to talk about his celebrity-filled past, though. “I’m from a generation where just because I did work that was successful when I was 21, I’m forever known for that work,” he said.

He continued: “Like Hedi Slimane and Raf Simons — not that I’m anywhere close to those people, but I definitely look up to them and would like to be as great of a designer as them one day — they didn’t start having their work shown until they were around my age. Now with the fashion system, everyone sees stuff right away and I think it takes time for a designer to develop their voice…I want to take it slow.”

So, what might Williams’ voice be? Well, for starters, there’s that “F—k you.” But Williams also has a soft and romantic side, hence the flowery pastel background in his fall lookbook images, which he photographed himself. The collection is aptly named “Natural Order,” which refers to the absence of law or anarchy, but also the laws of the earth. “There are many different through-lines that you could find if you looked at the collection,” said Williams. “You could find darkness, or brightness.”

Like his contemporaries Demna Gvasalia of Vetements and Virgil Abloh of Off-White, Williams is a part of the movement transforming what was once considered subversive, underground style into mainstream luxury.

Alyx doesn’t quite have the luxury brand backing (yet), but the collection can still be found in directional boutiques like Maryam Nassir Zadeh, Dover Street Market, Machine-A, The Broken Arm, and Colette.

While Williams prefers lookbooks and private appointments now, he hopes to one day do large-scale see now-buy now shows.

“I go back to that feeling of discovery,” he said, speaking of attending fashion shows when he was younger. “I saw something that other people weren’t able to see the next second on Instagram. It felt special. How do you bring that sense of discovery back to a fashion show?”

For now, Williams is focused on discovering what it means to have full creative control after eight years of implementing other people’s visions. The words, “My first time,” were even printed on his fall 2015 shirts.

“That collection was the first time doing my own ideas,” he said. “It represents the loss of virginity and something really personal. It marked day one of something I hope to do for the rest of my life.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999758005142212}",neutral,0.9999758005142212,0
French media accused of censorship over film mocking LVMH boss Arnault - RFI English,"Sat, 12 Mar 2016 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJmaS5mci9lbi9jdWx0dXJlLzIwMTYwMzEyLWZyZW5jaC1tZWRpYS1hY2N1c2VkLWNlbnNvcnNoaXAtb3Zlci1maWxtLW1vY2tpbmctbHZtaC1ib3NzLWFybmF1bHTSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"FRANCE

Media treatment of a film that ridicules French billionaire Bernard Arnault has raised charges of censorship and questions over concentration of media ownership. Journalists at a a paper owned by Arnault's LVMH were banned from mentioning François Ruffin's Merci Patron (Thanks boss) this week and the director himself claimed there had been other cases of censorship.

Journalists' unions at Le Parisien newspaper accused their boss of self-censorship this week, claiming he had ordered critics not to review Merci Patron, ""not even in 10 lines"", and rejected a proposal by the politics desk to report on the ""buzz"" it had stirred up on the French left.

Arnault's LVMH, best known for its ownership of luxury brands such as Louis Vuitton, Sephora and Christian Dior, bought Le Parisien last year and the unions accuse editor Stéphane Albouy of not wanting to annoy his new boss.

Albouy called the film ""dishonest"" and accused Ruffin of manipulating the couple who are its principle subjects, the unions said in a joint statement.

Merci Patron is a Michael Moore-style documentary that follows the efforts of the Klurs, a couple who were laid off by an LVMH subsidiary, to contact Arnault and ask for help as they are threatened with the loss of their home.

Ruffin, who edits the left-wing magazine Fakir, says that it gives ""injustice ... a name, a face, a voice"".

He hailed the ""courage"" of the journalists who protested and claimed that reporters from Le Parisien and another LVMH-owned title, Les Echos, had earlier told his press attaché that they loved the film but would not be able to write about it.

Another journalist told him that his film ""makes you want to become a Bolshevik"" but that he couldn't cover it for fear of losing advertising revenue, he said.

Earlier in the week an invitation to Ruffin to appear on Europe 1 television, not owned by LVMH but by the Lagardère group, was cancelled at the last minute, although he was invited to another show after the incident became public.

He took advantage of the occasion to lay into Lagardère group boss, Arnaud Lagardère.

Ruffin also claims that a charity pulled out of financing the film because it had links with LVMH.

In a statement supporting Ruffin, the SNJ-CGT union denounced the ""personal connections between billionaires proved by the successive censorship by [Vincent] Bolloré at Canal + [a TV channel] so that his 'friends' are not hurt"", while the director declared that ""the freedom of the press is theatened by the ownership of the means of production by these big capitalists who know each other and spend time together"".

Nine media groups, several of them conglomerates with interests in industries stretching from fashion to armaments, control the majority of the French media, apart from public broadcasters like RFI.

Bernard Arnault, the world's 14th-richest person, is no stranger to spats with the press.

In 2012 he threatened to sue Libération newspaper for its headline ""Clear off, rich loser!"" referring to his application for Belgian nationality, which the paper interpreted as an effort to become a tax exile.

He dropped the case after the two sides reached an agreement.

‘Merci Patron!’: Film Review - Hollywood Reporter,"Mon, 07 Mar 2016 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvbGx5d29vZHJlcG9ydGVyLmNvbS9tb3ZpZXMvbW92aWUtcmV2aWV3cy9tZXJjaS1wYXRyb24tZmlsbS1yZXZpZXctODczMDQzL9IBW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvbGx5d29vZHJlcG9ydGVyLmNvbS9tb3ZpZXMvbW92aWUtcmV2aWV3cy9tZXJjaS1wYXRyb24tZmlsbS1yZXZpZXctODczMDQzL2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"As another Paris Fashion Week begins to wind down, French multinational LVMH — which owns such luxury brands as Dior, Celine, Kenzo, Louis Vuitton and Marc Jacobs — and its billionaire boss, Bernard Arnault, may have more to worry about than what’s happening on the runway.

After three weeks in theaters, the anti-LVMH documentary Merci Patron! (Thanks Boss!) has become a sleeper hit in France, raking in nearly 100,000 admissions in a release that will soon be expanded to several hundred screens.

The Bottom Line France’s richest man gets a run for his money.

Made on a tiny budget (about $200K, or the price of about 60 Louis Vuitton City Steamer bags) by activist-journalist turned director Francois Ruffin, the film uses a very Michael Moore-style approach to not only point out some of Arnault’s rather questionable business practices over the years, but to literally blackmail him onscreen for ruining the lives of two textile workers whose jobs were outsourced to more cost-friendly countries in Eastern Europe.

The 67-year-old Arnault — who is France’s richest man, with an estimated net worth of $37.2 billion in 2015 — has already been the subject of several scandals in recent years, including his underhanded attempt to take over family-run fashion giant Hermes and a purported plan to relocate to Belgium for tax purposes, the latter of which prompted French daily Liberation to put him on their front page with the headline: “Casse-toi riche con!” (“Get lost, rich asshole!”).

Ruffin, who founded the ultra-left publication Fakir and crashes LVMH shareholders meetings wearing a t-shirt that says “I heart Bernard,” details a few major grievances against Arnault and his empire in the film’s expeditious opening reel.

First, he explains how LVMH acquired one of its top brands, Dior, by buying out the holding company Boussac in the 1980s — only to sell off or shut down most of Boussac’s other businesses despite promises to retain them, resulting in hundreds, if not thousands, of job losses. After, Ruffin shows how salesmen at Kenzo (which LVMH bought in 1993) claim that their suits are 100% locally made, while a hidden camera uncovers that they’re actually manufactured in Poland and Bulgaria, where labor is significantly cheaper.

While such practices are widespread in the fashion world and not at all unique to LVMH, Ruffin goes from macro to micro to concentrate on one blue-collar couple — the jovial Serge and Jocelyne Klur — who worked at a now-defunct Kenzo plant in northern France and have been unemployed for several years now. They live on only a few euros a day, with barely enough money to feed themselves and a slew of unpaid debts that may result in their house being seized by the local huissier.

Rather than simply telling their sob story, Ruffin decides to help them fight back by penning threatening letters to Arnault on the Klurs’ behalf, claiming that they’ll go to the press about their predicament unless the billionaire pays them the equivalent of $40,000 and helps them find new jobs. Astonishingly enough, Arnault dispatches one of his security chiefs to meet with the couple in their home, with Ruffin setting up hidden cameras and microphones to record a series of highly shady transactions that reveal just how far the LVMH chief is willing to go in order to protect his public image.

The result is both surprising in terms of the final outcome, and at times quite funny, especially when Ruffin has to constantly school the easygoing Klurs on how to toughen up and stick it to the man. (The couple seems to go along with the plan for the hell of it — they literally have nothing to lose.) Other moments can be a bit grating as Ruffin puts himself at the forefront of the action, such as in a scene where we see him reading the story of Robin Hood to his kids and explaining to them how daddy is basically doing the same thing.

Despite such stabs at martyrdom, which is something Moore can be accused of as well, you can’t fault the director for genuinely helping a few good people while exposing a mogul who can sometimes come across as the French equivalent of Mr. Burns from The Simpsons. And while Merci Patron! will in no way solve the nation’s many economic woes, or the problems of the luxury fashion business in general, it deserves credit for having the courage to try and outscheme a first-class schemer — and for getting away with it.

Tech credits are low-fi if lively, including a titular theme song recorded in 1972 by popular French comic ensemble, Les Charlots.

"Jean-Claude Biver: 'The Watch Industry Is Not in Trouble, The World Is.' - The Business of Fashion","Thu, 24 Mar 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzb2ZmYXNoaW9uLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy9uZXdzLWFuYWx5c2lzL2plYW4tY2xhdWRlLWJpdmVyLXRoZS13YXRjaC1pbmR1c3RyeS1pcy1ub3QtaW4tdHJvdWJsZS10aGUtd29ybGQtaXMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"BASEL, Switzerland — Sitting on the top floor of Hublot's shiny black Baselworld stand, Jean-Claude Biver, the man at the head of LVMH's watch division, is venting. I've asked him why the Swiss watch industry is flagging, and he's not very happy about it.

“The industry is not in trouble, the world is in trouble,” he says, thumping his fist on the table (which is made of pine and heat-stamped with a line drawing of a Hublot watch and what might be edelweiss). ‘And that’s very different. Syria is in trouble; the refugees are in trouble; Putin is in trouble; Ukraine is in trouble; Brexit is in trouble; Europe is in trouble; Al-Qaeda and Islamic State are in trouble; Paris is in trouble; currency is in trouble; the finance market is in trouble; the stock market is in trouble… Goddamn, the whole world is in trouble! And we? We should sell watches like crazy?”

While he’s currently charged with running TAG Heuer (of which he is chief executive), Hublot and the lesser-known Zenith, outside watch circles, the name of Jean-Claude Biver carries little weight. But inside those circles, the JCB initials alone induce reverence.

In the 1980s, Biver bought and revived Blancpain, a name that had been redundant since the early 1960s. In the mid-1990s, he orchestrated Omega’s partnership with James Bond. And in the Noughties, he turned Hublot from a peculiar Swiss watchmaking concern into a global brand that now counts footballer demigod Pelé, the Ferrari F1 team and Usain Bolt among its partners and is the official timekeeper of the FIFA World Cup. In 2005, launched the Hublot Big Bang, a brazen, larger-than-life watch that is as good a metaphor for his impact on Swiss watchmaking as any.

Unhappy though Biver is with the charge that the watch industry is in a funk, the fact remains it is. Exports were down 8 per cent in January according to the Federation of the Swiss Watch Industry, following a 6.8 per cent slump in the second half of 2015. Much of the explanation for this lies in the Chinese market. The country’s well documented economic slow-down saw exports to China fall by 4.7 per cent last year, but more dramatic was the story in Hong Kong, where many Chinese travel to buy their watches. Exports to the world’s largest market for Swiss watches dropped by 22.9 per cent, equivalent to SFr 1bn by value. That’s a big hole in the industry total of SFr 21.5bn.

At times like these, the industry looks to Biver for answers. What is he doing to reverse the trend? Last year he slashed the prices of TAG Heuer watches, repositioning the brand for a younger audience after a decade spent pursuing the super-rich with low-volume, six-figure complications. At the same time, he signed Cara Delevingne, Cristiano Ronaldo and most recently Formula 1 upstarts Red Bull Racing.

Then in November last year, TAG Heuer released its TAG Heuer Connected, Switzerland’s most aggressive answer to the Apple Watch. Biver even held the press conference in a New York tower, within eyeshot of Apple’s iconic glass-box store. He claims it’s flying off the shelves.

“We expected to sell 20,000 pieces, but we have demand for 80,000 pieces for 2016,” he says. That would make it far and away the smartwatch leader among the Swiss brands, a crown so far belonging to Frédérique Constant, an independent that claims to have sold 16,000 of its Horological Smartwatch last year.

This mini-boom is representative of the brand’s overall performance, according to Biver. “If I look at the numbers, TAG had the best January ever in the history of the brand,” he says bullishly. “TAG also had the best February in the history of the brand. TAG will have the best March ever in history. The Connected watch pushed the whole thing. It gave the brand a new feeling. A new image. Suddenly people believe TAG is cool. Suddenly people believe TAG is avant-garde. Suddenly people believe TAG is dynamic. Suddenly people believe TAG is a young brand. Cindy Crawford said to me; ‘You succeeded – everybody thinks TAG Heuer is cool.’”

To his credit, Biver knows that this isn’t entirely his own doing. “Probably it’s because of Apple,” he concedes. “When the journalists said the only alternative to an Apple Watch is TAG Heuer, that gives us a transfer of image and we have taken it.”

Biver has always been a fearless disruptor. When he bought the Blancpain name in 1982, the mechanical watch industry was in tatters, ripped apart by the perfect storm of oil and gold crises, and the genesis of cheap quartz watches brought into the market from the Far East. It was no time to be breathing new life into a company making outmoded, expensive watches.

And yet it was. Biver, like Swatch Group founder Nicholas Hayek Sr., was one of a handful who twigged early that Swatch was reclothing wrists all over the world with its cheap but fashionable analogue watches, and that those same consumers would want more exclusive watches made the old-fashioned way as they got older.

By 1992, Blancpain was turning over SFr 50 million. Biver sold it to Swatch Group (owner of Omega, Longines and its most recent big name acquisition Harry Winston), becoming a member of the group's management committee at the same time. He stayed there until 2004 (hooking Omega up with Bond, Crawford and Michael Schumacher), at which point he became chief executive of the little fancied Hublot. LVMH boss Bernard Arnault apparently asked him to take over the running of all the group's watch brands in the summer of 2013. After some initial hesitation, Biver was announced as President LVMH Watch Division in March 2014, aged 63.

The strategies Biver has put in place since appear to be working. “There is an opportunity for Swiss brands to adopt new technologies and come to the market with new products, taking market share from slower competitors,” says Luca Solca, luxury goods analyst at Exane BNP Paribas. “And that is what TAG is doing.”

Biver’s thoughts on smartwatches make for interesting reading. “In three years I believe the success [of the TAG Heuer Connected] will be much bigger than today because the wearable has legs,” he says. “Wearable will be everywhere. You will be surrounded by information tools that all communicate with one another.”

TAG’s smartwatch has been developed in partnership with Google and Intel — it’s scarcely a watch, something Biver is eager to impress. “What do we have inside our watch if we take everything away? We have a computer. We have the smallest Intel computer in the world. We are invading the wrist, not for a watch, but to communicate to you,” he says firmly.

Such a statement begs the question: can a man proselytising smartwatches developed in America and made in the Far East lead the charge for the traditional Swiss watch industry? Surely if this is the future, the mechanical watch is doomed?

“No!” he booms, his face reddening. “If you have never worn a watch, the effort to wear a watch is much bigger than if you have been wearing an information tool on the wrist since you were 15 years old. The Connected watch is the best promotional tool for the mechanical watch.”

Biver is so convinced that TAG Heuer Connected's customers will come to want a mechanical watch that after two years they can trade their obsolete smartwatch for its mechanical twin. At launch, Biver announced that for an additional £1,100, customers could buy “eternity.”

ADVERTISEMENT

He is also working on perceptions of TAG Heuer. “TAG Heuer must be the entry price in luxury,” he says. “It must enable every young man and every young woman to enter through the door of luxury. That means it must be affordable luxury. And I need a perceived value that must be double what I see.”

By combining these strategies, Biver believes TAG Heuer will rise above the chaos around it. “You will not go to a restaurant where you see one old couple sitting talking to each other,” he says feverishly. “Many people waiting outside, that’s where you want to go. And people see many people waiting outside TAG Heuer. And they think: ‘The brand must be successful!’ You want to be linked to success; you don’t want to be linked to a sleeping brand.”

TAG Heuer is awake, as is Hublot. Zenith, by comparison is, in Biver’s words, “suffering.” The traditional brand was guilty of placing too many eggs in one basket during the years of plenty at the beginning of this decade. “From 2011 to 2013, Zenith was so strong; but it did 67 per cent of its turnover in Asia. They have lost probably 30 per cent [of their Chinese customers] due to the Chinese slow-down. This is why Zenith is doing minus 8 per cent, like the Swiss watch industry.”

Biver has recently begun focusing his attentions on the old brand. Few would bet against him turning it around. “You can safely count Jean-Claude among the giants in the industry,” says Solca. “His vision and competence in watches can be compared to that of the best entrepreneurs we have seen in this business in the past 30 years.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.8285727500915527}",neutral,0.8285727500915527,0
Doc about workers' revenge on France's richest man becomes smash hit - FRANCE 24 English,"Sun, 20 Mar 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZyYW5jZTI0LmNvbS9lbi8yMDE2MDMyMC1GcmVuY2gtZmlsbS1Bcm5hdWx0LWJpbGxpb25haXJlLXdvcmtlcnMtTFZNSNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"CINEMA

French audiences have been cheering in the aisles for a documentary film about the so-called little guys taking on France's richest man and laughing all the way to the bank.

AFP | In the documentary ""Merci Patron!"" (Thanks boss!), former textile workers take on Luxury group LVMH CEO Bernard Arnault, pictured.

Advertising Read more

So far, more 120,000 people have flocked to see ""Merci, Patron!"" (Thanks Boss!) on little more than word of mouth but it is now being expanded onto nine times as many screens across France.

The stars of the film are Jocelyne and Serge Klur, an unemployed, middle-aged couple from northern France who lose their jobs in the textile industry when the company opens up new factories in Poland.

With the help of leftwing activist and film-maker François Ruffin, the Klurs make billionaire Bernard Arnault, the head of LVMH fashion and luxury goods empire, pay for ""ruining their lives"".

The darkly comic film has become a rallying cry for thousands of French workers who have lost their jobs -- or who fear losing them -- to foreign labour.

Recently, protestors demonstrating against reforms of France's labour laws used the film's title as a slogan at marches. They’ve also taken to singing its 70s theme song, also titled ""Merci Patron!"", which urges bosses and workers to swap places.

Ruffin played an active role in helping the Klur couple save their home and find Serge a full-time job. In the process, they run rings around Arnault's sidekicks, including a former intelligence officer and a politician from the ruling Socialist party.

Ruffin said the film's magic was its ""liberating effect"" on audiences.

""When you see such an empire trembling in front of something so insignificant it has a liberating effect,"" he insisted.

Arnault himself has remained tightlipped about the affair. LVMH, which owns such fabled brands as Dior, Givenchy and Louis Vuitton, declined to comment to French press agency AFP.

The film tops French website Allocine's audience ratings of the best films currently on release alongside another documentary, ""Demain"" (Tomorrow), which showcases positive solutions to the global climate crisis.

Middle-class also worried

Sociologist Michel Pincon said its Michael Moore-style scenario has caught the mood of a country where ""people crave a little security in a world where capitalism has become more and more unbridled"".

Pincon admitted that the movie's ""audiences were mostly middle-class"" (as opposed to working class) but that the debates after screenings ""prove that they, too, are also worried for themselves and their children"".

The film plays strongly on France's working-class northern ""Ch'ti"" culture, contrasting the locals’ love of beer, French fries and stinky Maroilles cheese with Arnault, who owns the Moet & Chandon, Dom Perignon and Veuve Clicquot champagne houses.

The film, however, does not totally dehumanise Arnault.

John Baxter, an American who saw the film in Paris, said he could never imagine a US business leader compensating former workers years after getting rid of them.

""Arnault is the bad guy of course -- and the sting is at his expense -- but he doesn't come out of it all bad. He clearly has some kind of a conscience. Most American business leaders would not give these people the time of day. They would just blow them off,"" he added.

Arnault sparked the wrath of the French left in 2012 when he applied for Belgian nationality after the government proposed higher taxes on the rich, prompting the Liberation newspaper to run the front page headline, ""Clear off, rich loser!""

A fighting film

Like its protagonists, the film faced an against-the-odds battle to get made, losing half of its tiny €30,000 ($33,000) budget when state funding was withdrawn ""without explanation"" at the last minute.

Journalists working at France's highest-selling national newspaper, Le Parisien, which is owned by Arnault, claimed they were banned from writing about it.

The host of a top radio show also admitted that the film's director Ruffin was ""uninvited"" from his show after management intervened, apparently fearing they would lose advertising revenue from Arnault's businesses.

Meanwhile, the Kenzo suits that the Klurs once made in Poix-du-Nord are now manufactured in Bulgaria after LVMH switched production from Poland after wages rose. But salaries have fallen so sharply in crisis-hit Greece that the Bulgarian factory's owners are now considering moving some operations there.

The apparel maker is the subject of takeover speculation after some mysterious movements among its investor base. But a potential price tag of 8 billion pounds would be extravagant. The stock is not cheap, costs are already lean and it’s not clear that a new owner could do much to halt slowing sales.

Even without any bid premium to its £6.5 billion enterprise value, Burberry would be a brave buy. It is forecast to earn £472 million of operating profit in 2019, based on Thomson Reuters Eikon estimates, or £363 million after tax. That would give any buyer a threadbare 5.6 percent return on investment. Add a 30 percent premium to pad out the deal, and that falls to 4.3 percent.

The trick for a buyer would be to get that return up to around 9 percent, which is Burberry’s cost of capital, according to Morningstar. But how?","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9697079658508301}",neutral,0.9697079658508301,0
"In Paris, Christelle Kocher Capitalizes on Streetwear - W Magazine","Fri, 04 Mar 2016 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndtYWdhemluZS5jb20vc3RvcnkvY2hyaXN0ZWxsZS1rb2NoZXIta29jaGUtbHZtaC1wcml6ZS1mYWxsLTIwMTYtcGFyaXMtZmFzaGlvbi13ZWVr0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"If style today is defined by a carefully curated mix of high and low, it couldn’t be a better time to be Christelle Kocher. Her label, Koché, which launched in 2014, is a study in contrasts, combining quotidian silhouettes with elaborate fabrications. Think embellished sports bras, feathered parkas, and a bodysuit meticulously coated in paillettes.

“The idea behind Koché is to mix [the] everyday with French couture and artisanal work,” said the designer on the phone from Paris, the day after showing her fall collection. “Like having a really amazing dress, but mixing it with jogging pants.”

You don’t have to look further than the street style scene surrounding fashion month – where editors are more often seen dashing to shows in sneakers and everyone is wearing patchwork jeans, usually Vetements – to know that streetwear is having a moment. So it’s been a fortuitous time for Kocher to launch her line, and her mix of styles has caught the attention of the LVMH prize for emerging designers, for which she’s been shortlisted twice. After this interview, Kocher headed to Avenue Montaigne to the offices of Louis Vuitton Moët Hennessy to meet the likes of Karl Lagerfeld and Karlie Kloss at a presentation of the semifinalists’ work.

“In one year so many things happened!” she said. “Fashion goes really fast sometimes, and I’m glad I’m getting some attention for Koché. Young brands needs those opportunities for sure.”

Koché may only be three seasons old, but the 37-year-old is no neophyte. After graduating from Central Saint Martins in 2002, the French designer began her career working for Emporio Armani, which was followed by stints at Chloé, Dries Van Noten and Bottega Veneta.

Since 2010, she’s served as artistic director of Maison Lemarié, an atelier commissioned by Chanel and Dior that specializes in “plumasserie,” or making fabric flowers. (Conveniently, she uses her work at Lemarié for her own label’s ornamentations.)

Despite her high fashion background and use of artisanal techniques, Kocher isn’t all that interested in the elitism of couture. Her first runway show in September took place at the Forum des Halles, a shopping mall in central Paris that’s popular among the teeny-bopper set. This season, models – a combination of Kocher’s friends and known names such as Soo Joo Kim – stomped through a covered outdoor passageway. Editors had to stand to watch the show.

“We wanted it [to be] open to the public, to the people who were living there and working there, to anyone passing by. That’s why the girls were walking outside the passage, in the streets, waiting under this big beautiful Saint-Denis arch,” said the designer. “I like the idea of sharing a show with unknown people.”

Her democratic attitude has major cities’ autocratic shops clamoring. Already, Koché is carried at Selfridges in London, Collette 21 in Singapore, Maxfields in Los Angeles, and Ikram in Chicago.

“Christelle’s collection has a street vibe with a couture quality which is being received passionately by our clientele,” said Ikram Goldman, the owner of her eponymous store. “And the fit is sensational!”

And Kocher’s expanding her offerings, adding a jewelry collaboration with Goossens and a shoe collaboration with the French brand Adieu. She hopes to add menswear soon.

If she wins the LVMH prize, expansion won’t be a problem. The winner, to be announced on June 16th, will take home 300,000 euros as well as a year of mentorship from the fashion conglomerate. But for all the attention Koché is getting, Kocher is remaining level-headed.

“I’ve worked in fashion long enough to be careful and to stay focused on what’s most important to me: creation,” she said. “I want to last.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999966621398926}",neutral,0.9999966621398926,0

Simon Porte Jacquemus Gets Personal - W Magazine,"Tue, 08 Mar 2016 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiNWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndtYWdhemluZS5jb20vc3Rvcnkvc2ltb24tcG9ydGUtamFjcXVlbXVz0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"When he was 18, Simon Porte Jacquemus moved to Paris from the Provençal countryside to enroll in ESMOD International fashion school. He was there only a month before his mother passed away. Realizing that life is short, he quit school, procured a job at the local Comme des Garçons boutique, and worked on his own designs at night, producing his first collection while still a teenager. With a millennial’s instinct for social media, he began posting pictures of his eminently Insta­grammable clothes, their obvious avant-gardeness influenced by a Rei Kawakubo sensibility. With the added support of Comme des Garçons president Adrian Joffe, it wasn’t long before the French press, eager to promote one of their own, pounced. Now 26, Porte ­Jacquemus and his label, ­Jacquemus—so called for his mother, whose maiden name the designer has adopted—is one of the most promising designers in a decade to emerge in a country where young talent now tends to get fast-tracked into the giant, battling mother ships of Kering and LVMH. While he remains independent, with a staff of 12, Porte ­Jacquemus did, in fact, win an LVMH Special Jury Prize last year. “I guess you have to be crazy to start your own label,” he says over a pot of Moroccan mint tea in a café in the Marais around the corner from his atelier. “There aren’t enough crazy people in Paris.”

Crazy, or just very, very confident—a characteristic that the designer says he owes to his mother’s immense support. His father was a farmer, and Porte Jacquemus grew up surrounded by horses; Saturdays were spent selling fruit and vegetables at the markets. “It’s weird for me now not to wake up every morning and pet the donkeys,” he says. But his parents were also creative people. When not tending to the farm, his father was a musician, and his mother, a bit of a fashion fanatic. “She’d show up in some hot pink getup or a 1930s dress to school meetings. She was an eccentric, but I loved that.” When he was 9, he had a seamstress make a skirt for her of his own design, and though he admits that it was “pretty ugly,” his mother proudly wore it, proclaiming it beautiful. At that point, Porte Jacquemus was already five years into what would be a decade-plus career as a child model and actor in the South of France, fostered, as junior careers tend to be, by his mother. (Today, he posts the occasional tear sheet from those days on Instagram; a picture of him jubilantly holding up a package of diapers received an overwhelming amount of “likes.”) “Imagine me going to Marseille for shoots on Saturdays, followed by visits to museums with my mother, and then having beignets on the beach,” he remembers. “It was a good childhood.” So perhaps it’s no wonder that his designs started out as a celebration of infantile regression. Flat to the point of almost two-dimensionality, in geometric shapes with dashes of primary colors, the dresses, tops, and skirts looked straight out of a Colorforms sticker set. “I want to stay innocent my whole life, even if I don’t want to stay a kid. I wish fashion were more innocent.”

Some critics have questioned the wearability of his clothes, but despite their challenging silhouettes, exaggerated grommets, and color-block and striped patches, they continue to sell out at Le Bon Marché, Dover Street Market, and on Net-a-porter. “It’s always our most out-there pieces that do the best,” Porte Jacquemus says. While Lady Gaga has been spotted in Jacquemus, and Miley Cyrus is a devotee, too, such celebrity accolades were never the designer’s goal. “Sure, we loan to famous people, and I’m happy when I see Marion Cotillard shot in my clothes,” he says. “But that whole red-carpet machine is done for me. I prefer to put up on Instagram a photo of a real girl in my clothes, because that speaks to people and touches their lives.” And Jacquemus himself speaks extra loudly, posting each image not once but three times, as if to say, “No, really, look at this!”

Call him an oversharer, if you must—it doesn’t bother him in the least. Porte Jacquemus’s spring 2016 collection, arguably his most accomplished, is also his most personal. “I said to myself, ‘I’m sick of laughing, I want to make people cry,’ ” he recalls. “Of course, what I didn’t realize was that it would make me cry, too, and I’d be crying the whole time.” There was not a dry eye in the audience, either, as models glided out in deconstructed pinstriped suiting and white shirts, and as the designer emerged at the end of the show, somberly leading a white horse. “It was a poetic way for me to say there is always hope. And honestly, now I’m ready to laugh again.”
