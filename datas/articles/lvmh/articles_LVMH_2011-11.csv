New Cheval Blanc hotel for Paris - Decanter.com,"Sun, 20 Nov 2011 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlY2FudGVyLmNvbS93aW5lLW5ld3MvbmV3LWNoZXZhbC1ibGFuYy1ob3RlbC1mb3ItcGFyaXMtMzM4MDUv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Luxury goods group LVMH has unveiled its plans for a new Cheval Blanc hotel in Paris.

The group is continuing to expand its luxury hotel and restaurant chain named after its Saint Emilion premier cru classé property, Chateau Cheval Blanc.

The Paris venture, due to open in 2014, is part of LVMH’s €450m restoration of La Samaritaine, a department store next to the Louvre.

LVMH, headed by billionaire financier Bernard Arnault, opened the 5-star hotel Cheval Blanc in the Courchevel ski resort in 2006 (pictured).

Operated by LVMH Hotel Management, and with a two-star Michelin restaurant called 1947, after the chateau’s most renowned vintage, it has recently been named one of eight ‘Palace’ hotels in France.

LVMH Hotel Management is also set to open two Cheval Blanc hotels in Oman and Eygpt.

The Maison Cheval Blanc in Oman will be located on the island of Al Soda, while the development in Egypt is on the private island of Amoun in Aswan.

‘It makes perfect sense to carry out these types of brand extensions’ Jean-Luc Coupet, an investment expert at Wine Bankers told Decanter.com.

‘Ultra high-end tourism fits perfectly with the wine’s image. Each one reinforces the other.’

Louis Vuitton Moet Hennessy is bringing the yacht business to India - Luxurylaunches,"Tue, 15 Nov 2011 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vbHV4dXJ5bGF1bmNoZXMuY29tL3RyYW5zcG9ydC9sb3Vpc192dWl0dG9uX21vZXRfaGVubmVzc3lfaXNfYnJpbmdpbmdfdGhlX3lhY2h0X2J1c2luZXNzX3RvX2luZGlhLnBocNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"

The famous luxury brand Louis Vuitton Moet Hennessy (LVMH) Group has announced their plans to open up the business of selling yachts in partnership with the Princess firm in Mumbai. The Princess firm is a UK-based company that had bought over LVMH in 2008. Their fleets of lavish yachts start from the smallest 39-foot vessels at $789,719. Their most expensive yachts go for $ 5,922,900. So if you have always dreamed of sailing out to sea on your own yacht, now achieving that just got easier.



Navnit Marine is the direct distributor for the Princess firm International business in India. They have tie-ups with five more yacht-makers, and the company claims the demand for extravagance yachts will increase regardless of the current economic situation. Sharad Kachalia, a director at Navnit Marine, said, “We will sell four to five yachts in the next 12 months”. Since 2002 they have sold over 100 yachts already. It’s the absence of infrastructure supporting marinas that is holding back in this sector, according to Sharad Kachalia. However, with its presence in 65 countries already, India was counted as a major consumer of super-luxury toys.

""We are going to beat the 2.4 billion euros in sales of 2010,"" Hermes boss Patrick Thomas said. ""Demand for our products continues to grow both in emerging and traditional markets.""

Sales growth was registered across the group's whole range of products with silk and textiles up 27 per cent, leather goods up 13 per cent, fashion and accessories up 31 per cent and perfumes up 15 per cent.

Sales for the first nine months of the year were up 20.2 percent to 1.99 billion euros.

Thomas also confirmed that the descendants of founder Thierry Hermes, who collectively hold more than 73 per cent of Hermes, would create by Christmas a holding company structure aimed at thwarting a potential takeover bid by luxury brand rival LVMH.

The move came after LVMH increased its stake in Hermes to more than 20 per cent, raising fears of a takeover bid which under French rules can be blocked if a holding company controls more than 50 per cent.

by ZeeNews.com on 14 Nov 2011'We will sell four to five yachts in the next 12 months,' Sharad Kachalia, a director at Navnit Marine, Princess International`s distributor for the country, told reporters here. Princess`s sales manager, Bill Barrow, said it has entered into an exclusive arrangement with Navnit and will sell the entire range of its yachts in India.Princess, a UK-based company which was bought by LVMH in 2008, is also designing a 39-footer yacht, which will be its smallest. It will help attract more buyers in a price-sensitive geography like this, Barrow said. When asked if the entry into India is a strategic decision, considering the slowdown in Europe and elsewhere, Barrow avoided giving a direct answer.However, he said the share of emerging economies like China in the company`s total revenue pie has been growing steadily over the past few years. The company sells its products in 65 countries.According to Navnit Marines, which has a tie-up with five more yacht-makers, demand for the super-luxury machines continues to be strong even in the present economic situation.

Marc Jacobs On South Park— Marc Jacobs Gets South Park Tattoo - Refinery29,"Tue, 08 Nov 2011 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiPmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJlZmluZXJ5MjkuY29tL2VuLXVzL21hcmMtamFjb2JzLXNvdXRoLXBhcmstdGF0dG9v0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Forget the CFDA accolades. Lose the legendary fashion lines. Screw the epic makeover and the random upcoming film role. Marc Jacobs himself will tell you he has one singularly immortalizing personal accomplishment: he's been animated on South Park. While we try really, really hard to imagine him sitting on his couch identifying who killed Kenny, we'll elaborate. At the Glamour Women of the Year Awards in NYC last night, his surprise TV cameo had Jacobs gushing. ""Honestly, without hesitation, it is the greatest honor, I mean way above and beyond the lifetime achievement award, beyond anything. It's like, to be immortalized on South Park, I can die a happy man.""

Despite the fact that his character gets boiled to death at the end of the episode, Marc is thrilled to have been added to the ranks of the rude characters. And what does such a fashion god do to celebrate such an, ehm, epic role? Add the cartooned version of himself to his 28 piece ink portfolio, of course (We know the man loves a permanently animated funny: see one Sponge Bob Squarepants on his right bicep, an M&M, and two forearm pieces featuring other South Park characters.) Can we expect a South Park LV bag in our future? (The Cut)"
John Galliano launch online store - Telegraph - The Telegraph,"Tue, 15 Nov 2011 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXmh0dHA6Ly9mYXNoaW9uLnRlbGVncmFwaC5jby51ay9uZXdzLWZlYXR1cmVzL1RNRzg4OTIwNTgvSm9obi1HYWxsaWFuby1sYXVuY2gtb25saW5lLXN0b3JlLmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"John Galliano launch online store

New e-commerce site, named the 'Galliano Gazette', signals that the show really is going on at the disgraced designer's eponymous label.

BY Olivia Lidbury | 15 November 2011

The man behind the label may have been ousted following an anti-Semitic rant in a Paris café earlier this year, but it's business as usual at John Galliano, the fashion label.

""The House of John Galliano is thrilled to be able to launch itself into cyberspace, and is excited to bring the elements of the Galliano Universe to e-commerce,"" said a company statement released this afternoon.

The many faces of John Galliano

The result is the ""Galliano Gazette"", an image-lead, newspaper-themed website (in-keeping with the brand's iconography) that is effortless to navigate and a million miles away from the often stuffy, overly-conceptual websites favoured by fellow luxury brands. The company's aim to create ""global access for fans of the iconic brand"" has been seamlessly achieved.

Central Saint Martins graduate John Galliano founded his eponymous label in the Eighties and went bankrupt several times before being bought by luxury conglomerate LVMH. He was fired from both his brand and his creative director role at the LVMH-owned Christian Dior weeks after footage surfaced of him shouting anti-Semitic abuse at a couple in a Paris bar.

But a flaw of the new Galliano site is that it makes only the briefest of references to its founder however, and focuses more on how newly-instated creative director Bill Gaytten came to meet Mr Galliano and how the two formed a close working relationship that spanned 23 years.
