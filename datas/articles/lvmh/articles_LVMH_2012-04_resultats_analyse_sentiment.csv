Slowdown in China? Not for luxury brands - CNN,"Tue, 24 Apr 2012 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vbW9uZXkuY25uLmNvbS8yMDEyLzA0LzI0L21hcmtldHMvY2hpbmEtbHV4dXJ5LWJyYW5kcy9pbmRleC5odG3SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"China is on pace to top Japan as the world's largest market for luxury goods, with sales surging 18% annually to hit $27 billion by 2015. That's a fifth of the worldwide total.

NEW YORK (CNNMoney) -- China's broader economy may be losing momentum, but its big spenders aren't letting anything get in the way of their love affair with Louis Vuitton, Chanel and Gucci.

China is on pace to top Japan as the world's largest market for luxury goods, according to McKinsey & Co., which estimates sales will surge 18% annually to hit $27 billion by 2015. That's a fifth of the worldwide total and up from just $10 billion in 2009.









""China's consumer is still in its infancy,"" said Wendy Trevisani, a portfolio manager at Thornburg Investment Management. It's true that exports and real-estate investment are softening, but Trevisani contends consumer spending is growing ""pretty much without hesitation.""

In fact, consumer spending is forecast to account for 43% of China's GDP growth by 2020, up from about a third currently, according to McKinsey. That's in line with the nation's current five-year plan, which aims to help the country become less dependent on exports and investment-led growth.

And with China's appetite for Western goods, luxury brands stand to be big beneficiaries.

One of Trevisani's biggest holdings in the co-managed Thornburg International Value Fund (TGVAX) is LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton, the world's largest luxury goods groups with its 60 brands including its namesakes, Marc Jacobs, Tag Heuer and beauty retailer Sephora.

Thanks to its 20% gain this year, the stock is one of the best performers in the Thornburg fund.

LVMH's first-quarter sales jumped 25% thanks to China. And while Chinese buyers are Louis Vuitton's biggest customers already, the market is far from saturated.

Nearly every brand of the company is focused on tapping further into China.

Diamond jeweler De Beers, an LVMH brand, opened its first store in China less than a year ago in Beijing. Louis Vuitton boutiques, which already boast multiple locations in China's big, thriving cities, are continuing to expand, even making a push into the country's second- and third-tier cities.

Meanwhile, the head of the LVMH's wine and spirits group, Christope Navarre, recently announced that the company has found land in China that is perfect for a vineyard, and will be producing a super-premium red wine within two years. ""The potential is huge,"" Navarre said.

LVMH, of course, is not the only luxury company enjoying success in China. Following Louis Vuitton, private label Chanel and Gucci, owned by PPR were the most desired brands in China last year, according to research by Bain & Co.

Compagnie Financière Richemont, known for its Cartier jewelry and watches, is also gaining traction. Between 2006 and 2011, its China and Hong Kong sales more than tripled.

Despite that growth, Cartier CEO Bernard Fornas recently told the Wall Street Journal that the company has not even ""scratched the potential"" of many cities in China.

Although China is not its biggest market yet, Fornas said many Chinese consumers are already big Cartier clients in other markets.

Prada, which includes the namesake label as well as Miu Miu and others, has also made a big bet on China. Prada's sales in Asia, excluding Japan, climbed 42% in 2011, and nearly a quarter of the new stores the company opened last year were in the region.

The Italian fashion house also made its public debut on the Hong Kong stock exchange last year, as it continues to expand its international presence.

Chinese consumers have also embraced Coach (COH), which listed depositary receipts on the Hong Kong stock exchange last year and operates more than 80 locations through Hong Kong and China.

In addition to fashion and jewelry brands, luxury car manufacturers are also luring in Chinese customers.

Sales of Tata Motors' (TTM) Land Rovers, Ranger Rovers and Jaguars jumped 60% in China in 2011, and last month, the company inked a deal with China's Chery Automobile to manufacture and sell luxury cars in China.

Sales of Daimler-owned Mercedes-Benz, Volkswagen's Audi, and BMW vehicles also continue to grow at a red-hot pace.

U.S. automakers Ford (F, Fortune 500) and General Motors (GM, Fortune 500) are also continuing to successfully grow in the world's second-largest economy.

GM sold a record number of vehicles in China during the first quarter, up more than 10% from a year ago.

While Ford's first-quarter sales declined in China, the company recently announced that it is investing $600 million in one of its Chinese manufacturing facilities to meet growing demand.

As China's economy continues to grow and create more wealth, average household spending is likely to follow, a healthy signal for Western brands. And the outlook is particularly bright for luxury companies, since the biggest increase in spending is forecast to come from the most affluent consumers.

Consumers who spent $2,000 and $4,000 on discretionary items in 2010 are expected to raise that to $3,000 and $6,000, respectively, by 2020, according to McKinsey. And consumers who allocated $12,000 toward discretionary spending in 2010 are forecast to almost double that figure by 2020.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.8161368370056152}",neutral,0.8161368370056152,0

Dior names new designer to succeed Galliano - FRANCE 24 English,"Mon, 09 Apr 2012 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZyYW5jZTI0LmNvbS9lbi8yMDEyMDQwOS1jaHJpc3RpYW4tZGlvci1uYW1lcy1uZXctY2hpZWYtZGVzaWduZXItc3VjY2VlZC1nYWxsaWFuby1yYWYtc2ltb25zLXJhY2lzdC1vdXRidXJzdNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"FASHION

France's Dior fashion house on Monday named Belgian Raf Simons (pictured) to succeed John Galliano as chief designer. Galliano was fired more than a year ago for a high-profile racial outburst in a Paris bar.

AFP - French fashion powerhouse Dior on Monday named Raf Simons as chief designer to succeed disgraced John Galliano who was fired more than a year ago for racist outbursts.

The 44-year-old Belgian will be responsible for ""Haute Couture, Ready-to-Wear and Women's Accessories,"" the Paris-based fashion house said in a statement.

He will premier his first Christian Dior Haute Couture collection in Paris in July, said Dior, one of the crown jewels in Bernard Arnault's LVMH luxury empire.

Dior hailed the Belgian as ""one of the biggest contemporary talents"", saying that ""he will inspire and push into the 21st century the style that Mr Dior launched with the opening of his house and that has changed, since its first collection, the codes of world elegance.""

Flamboyant British designer Galliano was sacked last year after a video emerged of him hurling anti-Semitic slurs at patrons in a Paris bar.

Since then, his former right-hand man Bill Gaytten has overseen Dior collections.

Galliano was convicted of anti-Semitism by a French court in September, receiving suspended fines totalling 6,000 euros after the court accepted his argument that he was sorry for his actions.

The Paris criminal court found him guilty of making anti-Semitic insults in public -- an offence under French law -- when he clashed with bar patrons in the capital's Marais district on two occasions, in February this year and October 2010.

The court ordered Galliano to pay a symbolic euro in damages to each of the victims and to five anti-racism groups that were plaintiffs in the case. He was also told to pay the bodies 16,500 euros in legal costs.

The 50-year-old designer later checked into rehab for two months in Arizona and Switzerland.

NK defector-spy gets 4-year jail term for assassination attempt - 코리아타임스,"Thu, 05 Apr 2012 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmtvcmVhdGltZXMuY28ua3Ivd3d3L25hdGlvbi8yMDI0LzAzLzExM18xMDgzODIuaHRtbNIBP2h0dHBzOi8vbS5rb3JlYXRpbWVzLmNvLmtyL3BhZ2VzL2FydGljbGUuYW1wLmFzcD9uZXdzSWR4PTEwODM4Mg?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"A North Korean defector-turned-spy was sentenced to four years in prison for attempting to kill a fellow defector in South Korea at the order of the communist regime, court officials said Thursday.



The secret agent, surnamed Ahn, was charged with plotting to kill Park Sang-hak, a defector leading anti-Pyongyang propaganda activities in the South, with a poisoned needle in September.



He was also ordered to pay 11.75 million won ($10,399) in fines, the equivalent of his payment from the North.



""Severe punishment is needed for crimes that can threaten the existence and safety of the Republic of Korea (South Korea),"" the Seoul Central District Court said in a ruling. ""However, (the court) took into consideration the circumstances that led Ahn to commit the crime, such as the fact that he was unexpectedly given the poisoned needle while gathering North Korea intelligence for the National Intelligence Service (NIS),"" the South's spy agency.



Ahn defected to the South in 1995 and served as a director of a company handling inter-Korean economic projects. In 2010, he came into contact with a North Korean spy during business trips to Mongolia, and was later ordered to carry out the assassination, court officials said.



Ahn said he followed the instructions out of resentment for the NIS, as he informed the agency of the assassination plot and offered to gather top intelligence on the communist regime, but was rebuffed and even warned of possible legal consequences, according to the officials.



North Korea has said it opposes all forms of terrorism, though it has a track record of terrorist attacks against South Korea. The Koreas are technically at war with each other after the 1950-53 Korean War ended in a truce. (Yonhap)

The arrangements have Reliance written all over. They demonstrate its ability to swing favourable deals, signal it’s a long-haul player and also show it’s learning from others. For example, Pradeep Hirani, owner of the Kimaya fashion chain, entered into five-year contracts with labels such as Max Mara and Roberto Cavalli, but ultimately exited, despite sitting on Rs 60 crore of private equity (PE) funds. It takes two to three years just to establish a brand in India, no matter how well it is known globally, and returns start coming in only after five years. “We were tilling the soil, but missing the crop. So we decided to get out,” says Hirani. According to industry estimates, the upfront spends per luxury label on rentals, advertising, marketing costs, logistics, and salaries in the first two to three years could be anywhere between Rs 3 crore and Rs 10 crore. Roberto Cavalli now has another five-year contract with a Delhi-based fashion outfit.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999527931213379}",neutral,0.9999527931213379,0

The French label, helmed by British designer Phoebe Philo, has signed a deal to open a store on the site of the Jordan International Bank at 103 Mount Street.

The label becomes the latest in a long line of big-name designer brands to open on the street: Lanvin, Bottega Veneta, Loewe, Marc Jacobs, Christian Louboutin and Balenciaga already have shops there - and earlier this week, Oscar de la Renta confirmed it will occupy a unit previously owned by hairdresser Nicky Clarke. Property investor Grosvenor, which owns almost every key property on Mount Street, is reportedly in talks with labels including Givenchy, Alaïa, Chloe, Yves Saint Laurent and Erdem to open stores on the street.

At the time the label remained tight-lipped about the strategy behind the closure, but it was suggested that Philo wanted to allow time to put her stamp on the brand, before opening a new raft of stores in keeping with her pared-back vision.

LVMH said that, despite the buoyant sales for Q1 of 2012, it remained ""uncertain"" over the European economy - the Evening Standard reports - and was placing ""strict control over costs"".

The designer in turn hailed his new employer as “a symbol of absolute elegance.”

Flamboyant British designer Galliano was sacked last year after a video emerged of him hurling anti-Semitic slurs at patrons in a Paris bar.

Since then, his former right hand man Bill Gaytten has overseen Dior collections.

Galliano was convicted of anti-Semitism by a French court in September, receiving suspended fines totalling €6,000 after the court accepted his argument that he was sorry for his actions.

The Paris criminal court found him guilty of making anti-Semitic insults in public – an offence under French law – when he clashed with bar patrons in the capital’s Marais district on two occasions, in 2010 and 2011.

The 50-year-old designer later checked into rehab for two months in Arizona and Switzerland.

Simons, who has always been a darling of the fashion press, had his own eponymous line that has been showing in Paris for a while. He is known for his often ground-breaking, minimalist fashion which he originally designed for men before launching into women’s pret-a-porter.

The Flemish Belgian works and lives in Antwerp, and his name had been repeatedly mentioned over recent months as a possible replacement for Galliano.

The Jil Sander fashion house, for which he had worked as creator since 2005, announced his departure last February.

His last Sander fashion show, which was well received in Milan, was awash with sculptural pastel-coloured dresses.

Simons, whose blue eyes, athletic build, and short hair lend him an air of strict authority, was born in Neerpelt, close to the Dutch border.

He studied industrial design before launching his career as a furniture designer for art galleries and private patrons.

Following an internship with Belgian fashion designer Walter Van Beirendonck, he switched to clothes, working under a Belgian tailor, before showing off his mostly classical first men’s wear creations in Milan for Raf Simons in 1995.

In 1999-2000, he also designed men’s wear for the experimental Ruffo Research fashion house, in association with Veronique Branquinho who worked on women’s creations.

But despite good reviews, he declared bankruptcy and took a year’s sabbatical saying he felt “stifled and constrained by the commercial aspect of fashion”.

In 2000, he started teaching fashion at the Vienna University of Applied Arts, a job he kept for five years. But in 2001 he also resumed his own fashion work with a smaller team and the backing of a Belgian industrial tycoon.

His Paris fashion shows, which played ever more on refining volumes, were keenly watched as indicative of future trends.

Taking his cue from the sub-cultural youth movement and his own predilection for clear cut lines, Simons described his men’s wear as meant for “the individualist, an eccentric who doesn’t mind being different”.

As of 2004, he started designing women’s clothing. In 2008, he opened two shops in Japan and took to designing accessories, including handbags, shoes and glasses, working with partners such as Eastpak, which designed backpacks popular with US students.

In May last year, he presided at the fashion festival in Hyeres, southern France, defending young designers who try to branch out by saying that “if they have a real message, if they have a true story to present, the fashion world will follow them.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999743700027466}",neutral,0.9999743700027466,0
