Tapestry acquires Capri Holdings for $8.5 billion - Fortune,"Thu, 10 Aug 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikgFodHRwczovL2ZvcnR1bmUuY29tLzIwMjMvMDgvMTAvdGFwZXN0cnktY29hY2gta2F0ZS1zcGFkZS1idXlzLWNhcHJpLWhvbGRpbmdzLXZlcnNhY2UtbWljaGFlbC1rb3JzLWZhc2hpb24tbWVyZ2VyLWFjcXVpc2l0aW9uLWx2bWgtYmVybmFyZC1hcm5hdWx0L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Big fashion is in the midst of a U.S.-European arms race.

American fashion brands are merging to become luxury goods giants, but they’re going up against the industry’s French titan, LVMH (Louis Vuitton Moët Hennessy), and its billionaire owner Bernard Arnault, who has been in a tug-of-war with Elon Musk for the title of world’s richest person.

The latest consolidation of a U.S. luxury company is by Tapestry, owner of luxury handbag brands Coach and Kate Spade. On Thursday, it dished out $8.5 billion to buy Capri, the owner of fashion brands Versace, Michael Kors, and Jimmy Choo.

The goal is to create “a new powerful global luxury house,” Tapestry CEO Joanne Crevoiserat said in a statement. Experts say the acquisition is an effort to mitigate the effects of slowed consumer spending amid inflation and rising interest rates.

Today’s mega-merger is still dwarfed by the sector’s largest-ever deal. In October 2020, LVMH purchased the iconic jewelry company Tiffany & Co. for nearly $16 billion.

LVMH is a French luxury group formed from the 1987 merger of fashion house Louis Vuitton, champagne and spirits company Moët & Chandon, and cognac manufacturer Hennessy. The company owns 75 brands across six sectors, including fashion houses Christian Dior, Givenchy, Marc Jacobs, Fendi, and Stella McCartney; jewelry company Bulgari; cosmetics retailer Sephora; as well as vodka distillery Belvedere; and champagne winery Dom Pérignon.

The company boasts a $462 billion market cap, and the man behind the curtain is French business magnate Arnault.

The (second) richest man in the world

Arnault, 74, became chairman and CEO of LVMH in 1989 after spending $2.6 billion buying up a stake in order to become the company’s largest shareholder and oust the former chief executive, Henry Racamier.

Arnault has a net worth of $226.2 billion, according to Forbes, and his wealth is largely tied to LVMH shares, including a 97.5% stake in Dior. He and tech tycoon Musk have been vying to be the world’s richest person for over a year now.

Musk moved up to No. 1 in June with a net worth of $228.8 billion, bumping Arnault down to No. 2 after holding the title for five months, according to Forbes.

But the French billionaire is doing just fine. LVMH announced at the end of July it would become a premium sponsor of the 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris, committing €150 million, or $166 million, to the Olympic and Paralympic games, Bloomberg reported.

Recovering from the popped luxury retail bubble

With inflation and rising interest rates, American consumer spending has slowed significantly from the buying craze of the pandemic years. From 2020 to 2022, low interest rates boosted consumer spending, creating an “everything bubble.” The luxury retail market was one of many to explode.

Now, shoppers’ appetite for discretionary items like electronics, furniture, and apparel has diminished, and luxury brands are feeling the effects.

European luxury stocks fell $32.3 billion in May as investors anticipated the impact of a softening U.S. economy. LVMH shares lost over $50 billion shortly after reaching a record-breaking $500 billion market cap. (This downturn is in part why Musk surpassed Arnault as the wealthiest person in the world.)

Tapestry’s acquisition of Capri is a move to both wield greater influence in the European-dominated market and mitigate the effects of the spending slump.

“Luxury is facing something of a slowdown, especially in the North American market, where consumers, even at the higher-income end, are starting to curtail spending,” Neil Saunders, managing director at GlobalData, told the Associated Press. “This has put pressure on Tapestry and Capri, both of which are now looking to international markets to bolster growth.”

The Tapestry and Capri acquisition is expected to close next year. Both boards have approved the deal, but it still awaits approval from Capri shareholders, who will receive $57 per share in cash, a nearly 65% premium from its closing price of $34.61 on Wednesday.

Tapestry, founded in 1941, has a market cap of $8.2 billion. Capri has a market cap of $6.3 billion. The two companies generated a combined $12 billion in global sales and a nearly $2 billion adjusted operating profit in the 2022 fiscal year, according to a release."
Clout not discounts: how LVMH will reattract ‘aspirational’ luxury shoppers - Style,"Tue, 08 Aug 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMioAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5zY21wLmNvbS9tYWdhemluZXMvc3R5bGUvbHV4dXJ5L2FydGljbGUvMzIzMDM1NS9ob3ctbHZtaC1wbGFucy1yZWF0dHJhY3QtYXNwaXJhdGlvbmFsLWx1eHVyeS1zaG9wcGVycy11cy1jb25zdW1lci10aGlua2luZy10d2ljZS1hYm91dC1zcGVuZGluZy1hbWlk0gGgAWh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLnNjbXAuY29tL21hZ2F6aW5lcy9zdHlsZS9sdXh1cnkvYXJ0aWNsZS8zMjMwMzU1L2hvdy1sdm1oLXBsYW5zLXJlYXR0cmFjdC1hc3BpcmF0aW9uYWwtbHV4dXJ5LXNob3BwZXJzLXVzLWNvbnN1bWVyLXRoaW5raW5nLXR3aWNlLWFib3V0LXNwZW5kaW5nLWFtaWQ?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"But that’s not how French luxury conglomerate LVMH does business.

Most retailers will do almost anything to encourage customers to come back and buy more products, especially when those shoppers begin to tighten their purse strings. Typical strategies include bigger ads, deeper discounts, cheaper merchandise and more, chasing after a shrinking pool of consumer spending.

LVMH needs sales from “aspirational” customers, but offering major discounts to keep them would spell trouble for the company.

The powerhouse behind Louis Vuitton, Christian Dior, Tiffany and over a dozen other iconic luxury brands was one of the largest beneficiaries of a pandemic-era boom in “aspirational” spending from US shoppers earning less than US$100,000.

Flush with surplus cash, these middle-income shoppers splurged on handbags and perfumes, propelling LVMH to record profits last year.

This year however, high inflation, increasing economic uncertainty , and dwindling cash reserves have led most US consumers to think twice about what they spend and where they spend it.

“The aspirational customer is suffering a bit,” LVMH CFO Jean-Jacques Guiony said on the company’s earnings call Tuesday, citing lower sales online and in “second-tier cities”.

While big-box stores are stepping up with markdowns to boost sales, that approach would spell disaster for a luxury brand, which needs to preserve an image of exclusivity and rarity.

“Extensive discounting to stimulate sales is never a good idea as while it can provide a short-term boost, it usually causes long-term damage to the brand which becomes more ubiquitous,” GlobalData retail analyst Neil Saunders said.

Saunders highlighted Coach and Michael Kors as brands who have spent several years now rebuilding their cache after wading too far into the mainstream.

Even as the company hands the reins over to a younger generation and expands its reach, Guiony said: “All our energy is focused on increasing the desirability of the brands.”

And desirability is rarely found in the bargain bin.

Still, even though chasing after “aspirational” customers would be bad for LVMH’s business, neither can the brand run away from them and into the arms of the ultra-wealthy.

“It’s a myth that a lot of the revenue stream comes from high earners,” retail industry expert and consultant Hitha Herzog said. “Their bread and butter are products at lower price points, like sunglasses, wallets and perfumes, that really target the aspirational customer.”

Herzog also pointed out that the breadth of LVMH’s geography and brand portfolio puts the company in a more secure position to ride out dips and changes in buying behaviours.

Falling US handbag sales can be offset by gains in Asia; fewer bottles of cognac can be compensated with more bottles of champagne.

So what’s a luxury house to do?

If the earnings call is any evidence, the answer is lots of advertising and a few blockbuster events to get the brands’ message out and burnish the image.

Guiony said a marketing blitz leading up to a mega-budget fashion show on the Pont Neuf in Paris with musician-turned-designer Pharrell Williams pulled in over a billion views for Louis Vuitton.

“The cost of all these initiatives was obviously quite high,” Guiony said. “It’s quite extraordinary in my view and worth the investment.”

Not every luxury brand can pull this strategy off, but it appears LVMH certainly can.

LVMH wants to conquer the metaverse. Can the luxury titan pull it off? - Jing Daily,"Wed, 02 Aug 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vamluZ2RhaWx5LmNvbS9wb3N0cy9sdm1oLXdhbnRzLXRvLWNvbnF1ZXItdGhlLW1ldGF2ZXJzZS1jYW4tdGhlLWx1eHVyeS10aXRhbi1wdWxsLWl0LW9mZtIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Responsible for industry hotshots including Tag Heuer , Dior, and Loro Piana, LVMH is going for gold in the virtual landscape.

The group announced a partnership with Epic Games in June, whereby the game software developer will help the multinational maison embark on new digital paths. In the same week, subsidiary house Louis Vuitton launched its first-ever non-fungible token (NFT) project, taking its lauded LV trunk into the metaverse, generating an audience response so big it made its way onto the pages of the UK’s Daily Mail.

“With this partnership, we will work with LVMH’s designers to transform physical and digital product creation using Epic’s suite of advanced creator tools. We are excited to accelerate the Group’s adoption of Unreal Engine, Reality Capture, Twinmotion and MetaHuman technology, and help LVMH’s global brands engage with customers through immersive digital experiences,” Bill Clifford, VP, Unreal Engine at Epic Games tells Jing Daily.

LVMH is keeping the pace up. Last month, Dior launched its B33 collection, which connects a physical sneaker to its own NFT digital twin, while beauty division Fenty Beauty dived into the world of Roblox, a favorite among Gen Z.

A global market leader, LVMH has helmed the ship of luxury by preserving its esteemed savoir faire since it was founded in 1987. With the technological era unfolding at record speed, the behemoth is wasting no time consolidating its nascent presence across the third iteration of the World Wide Web.

LVMH’s investment into the digital environment solidified after the appointment of Nelly Mensah, former Digital Strategist at Kering, as Head of Crypto and Metaverse of its Digital Innovation division in January last year. Since then, Mensah has pushed the conglomerate into new virtual frontiers through deploying tech such as augmented reality, near-field communication, and digital twins.

But with 75 brands under its belt, the answer is not a one-size-fits-all solution. Determining what technological use-case suits each brand best is a challenge in itself. Every project needs to embody distinct house codes, as well as resonate with its audience.

For example, Fendi’s low-key foray into the crypto space likely slipped under the average consumer’s radar (the project was positioned predominantly towards blockchain enthusiasts), while other initiatives rocked the luxury landscape – take Tiffany’s 50,000 CryptoPunk pendant, or Louis Vuitton’s 42,000 digital trunk, as cases in point.

LVMH’s business strategy has already undergone multiple major changes as it leans further into Web3. But it’s only a recent pivot. Only in early 2022 did the giant’s Chief Executive Officer Bernard Arnault claim that he was wary of a metaverse “bubble,” implying that the company was taking new online trends, like NFTs, with a pinch of salt.

Fast forward to today, and its investment in the ecosystem extends beyond consumer-facing projects. Despite Arnault’s hesitancy, in 2021, LVMH teamed up with Prada Group and Richemont to establish its own dedicated blockchain solution platform, the Aura Blockchain Consortium.

A first of its kind for luxury, Aura uses Quorum permissioned blockchain technology to allow brands and their suppliers to write data into the blockchain, without the need for any previous coding knowledge. The solution also aims to assist luxury labels in leveraging their supply chain transparency, authentication of products, after sales service, and transfer of ownership.

""The significance of Aura lies in its provision of a much-needed technological infrastructure that addresses the challenges posed by the changing digital landscape. Luxury brands have recognized the importance of onboarding a new audience, particularly the digitally native generation, and the consortium's implementation served as a strategic response to this need,"" Alexandre Frih, founder of Paris-based tech company Next Decade and former Technical Program Manager at Louis Vuitton says.

Frih was part of the team that brought the Consortium to life.

""The concept behind Aura Blockchain was truly innovative, and its appeal resonated with numerous actors within the luxury sector. The fact that many luxury brands subscribed to this shared vision created a unified force that aimed to shape the future of the industry in many ways. Another groundbreaking aspect was the creation of teams within each member, even competitors in the industry,"" he continues.

Unlike other blockchain networks, Aura is built on a private ledger that cannot be accessed publicly or display personal information to other participants of the consortium – a new, anonymized direction for Web3 which LVMH is leading the way in.

""This collaborative approach fostered an environment of cooperation and innovation, wherein luxury brands worked together to forge a path towards mutual growth,"" Frih adds.

Embracing Web3 also means tapping new communities and creative concepts. For example, Fendi’s aforementioned Web3 debut saw the brand join forces with leading crypto hardware company Ledger to release a line of limited-edition wallet holders last year.

""We collaborated with Fendi because they were genuinely excited to learn more about the digital assets space. Successful collaborations at any brand are driven by the creative director, and our collaboration with Fendi was no exception,” Ian Rodgers, Chief Experience Officer at Ledger tells Jing Daily.

Rodgers believes that lesser-known startups and niche businesses like Ledger can benefit from partnering with big names like LVMH to amplify their presence in the luxury industry. But conglomerates as big as LVMH need to remain wary of harming their reputation by teaming up with the wrong partner, particularly in a space that’s unpredictable and subject to fraudulent activity.

“New companies will need to earn their stripes by sticking around through multiple cycles, and building a large consumer base, before brands will partner with them, especially after the mistakes made during the 2021 and 2022 cycle,"" he says.

LVMH’s offline success has been buoyed by old-school luxury spenders. But onboarding them into a landscape like Web3 is never going to be completely smooth sailing. Even as the company courts a new generation of tech-forward consumers, it remains cautious about the online world’s checkered past, and how this could dent its success.

A step back from implementing blockchain language has been key to engaging a reticent audience. In May this year, LVMH-owned Patou tapped technology firm The Ordre Group to power its Web3-enabled digital verification feature. Although the function was essentially an NFT, Patou opted against marketing it this way.

“While it is a blockchain application, we don’t talk about it as such, and consumers don’t want to know about it. No one cares what the technology is built on. All they want to know is that they have the digital ID on their phones,” Simon Lock, co-founder of The Ordre Group told Jing Daily in an exclusive interview in May this year.

Though LVMH has deep pockets to fund its digital ambitions, the Web3 revolution has given birth to natives who aren’t easily swayed. This new wave of shoppers demands more from luxury leaders: more transparency, more autonomy, more exclusivity, and more benefits.

""No one is ever guaranteed success in anything. Every brand is judged by every product and collection it releases, and as they say in the music business, 'you're only as big as your last hit,’” Rodgers says. “Great luxury brands are great because they make things with high standards of creativity and quality that their audiences love. The same standards will hold true for digital items. Without high-quality standards and careful attention to the market dynamics, it can't work.”

Even with resources aplenty, LVMH can’t only rely on its status to thrive in these new pastures. It requires the delivery of experiences from an authentic point of view, and not just a money-making one.

Web3’s journey to public recognition may be recent, but it’s already resulted in a competitive environment, especially in the fashion industry. LVMH’s peers aren’t far behind. Kering, for example, has had its own team working on metaverse activations since late 2021.

Despite having less of a brand presence in the space compared to LVMH, Kering has scored Web3 successes, in large part down to Gucci’s robust metaverse roadmap.

As LVMH prepares for Web3 to become a more dominant fixture in our reality, it’ll need to balance holding up its distinct heritage and championing the next era of tech-powered luxury."
LVMH Tops $22 Billion Luxury Rally as China Lifts Travel Ban - The Business of Fashion,"Thu, 10 Aug 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzb2ZmYXNoaW9uLmNvbS9uZXdzL2x1eHVyeS9sdm1oLXRvcHMtMjItYmlsbGlvbi1sdXh1cnktcmFsbHktYXMtY2hpbmEtbGlmdHMtdHJhdmVsLWJhbi_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LVMH led luxury stocks higher in Europe on Thursday as China lifted a ban on group tours, boosting the case for travelers spending money on high-end watches and fashion.

The maker of Louis Vuitton bags rose as much as 2.6 percent in Paris, Hermès International gained 2.4 percent and L’Oréal SA advanced 1.8 percent, adding about €20 billion ($22 billion) in combined market value. Rolex retailer Watches of Switzerland Group Plc climbed as much as 5.9 percent after maintaining earnings guidance in a trading update.

China ended a group travel ban to countries including the US, UK, Australia, South Korea and Japan. Buyers from the country account for about 25 percent of European luxury-goods sales, including purchases made by tourists, according to estimates from Goldman Sachs Group Inc.

Group tours to Switzerland, Italy, Spain, France, Greece, Denmark, Iceland and Portugal had already been approved earlier this year.

“The ban on group travel opens ‘phase two’ of Chinese luxury spend” in Europe, Sanford C. Bernstein analyst Luca Solca said in an email. “We expect group travel to resume in 2H23E and support Chinese spend on luxury goods globally. The adverse price elasticity effects suffered by the industry in 2020,” when spending from Chinese tourists had dried up, “will unwind,” Solca said.

After a solid start to the year, luxury stocks have drifted lower in recent months in response to weak Chinese consumer and economic data. Bullish investors are pinning their hopes on a revival in anticipation that Beijing will soon implement more decisive stimulus measures to kick-start a flagging economy.

The relaxation, a significant boost to the global tourism market, also sent Europe’s travel and leisure subindex 1% higher, with Air-France KLM rising as much as 2.8 percent and TUI AG gaining 2.4 percent.

Sentiment on Thursday was also supported by signs of deal activity in the sector picking up. Capri Holdings Ltd soared in US premarket trading after the Wall Street Journal reported that the owner of the Michael Kors and Versace fashion brands was nearing a deal to be acquired by Tapestry Inc.

Luxury Briefing: 'The American LVMH' - Tapestry's Capri Holdings acquisition expected to be first of many - Glossy,"Fri, 11 Aug 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5nbG9zc3kuY28vZmFzaGlvbi9sdXh1cnkvbHV4dXJ5LWJyaWVmaW5nLXRoZS1hbWVyaWNhbi1sdm1oLXRhcGVzdHJ5cy1jYXByaS1ob2xkaW5ncy1hY3F1aXNpdGlvbi1leHBlY3RlZC10by1iZS1maXJzdC1vZi1tYW55L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"This week, a look at the week’s unexpected acquisition, which has big implications for American fashion. Scroll down to use Glossy+ Comments, giving the Glossy+ community the opportunity to join discussions around industry topics.

A handful of entrepreneurs developing multi-brand fashion empires have been said to be building an American LVMH. In 2016, the New York Times’s Vanessa Friedman questioned whether Adam Pritzker and Vanessa Traina’s Assembled Brands could become the conglomerate’s local counterpart. Four years prior, Anna Wintour described Andrew Rosen’s business as LVMH’s American equivalent. And last year, Naadam’s Matt Scanlan called building “the next LVMH” his business goal.

But on Thursday, Tapestry, Inc. announced its $8.5 billion acquisition of Capri Holdings Limited and gave legs to the once farfetched notion of a leading global fashion group birthed in the states. Once the deal goes into effect next year, one U.S. company will own six major fashion brands bringing in a combined $12 billion in annual revenue. And, due to the brands’ complementary strengths and the company’s potential to grow from there, analysts say that Tapestry, Inc. going head-to-head with Europe’s fashion giants is a feat that could someday pan out.

But also, considering the advantages of big businesses in today’s consumer product landscape, strategic jumps such as this deal may be necessary for U.S. fashion businesses to stand a fighting chance.

“From a strategic point of view, they’re clearly trying to do the American LVMH. And that makes total sense,” said Javier Lastra, CFA, portfolio manager of investment fund Tema Luxury ETF, which has invested in Tapestry, Inc. and Capri Holdings.

Like both companies’ leaders during Tuesday’s investors’ presentation, Lastra pointed to the resulting, risk-lowering diversification within the brand portfolio — namely, across brands, product categories and geographic markets. For example, he said it’s smart to move on from being borderline-“mono-brands” — with a majority of their businesses being driven by Coach (76% in the most recently reported quarter), on the Tapestry side, and Michael Kors (64%), for Capri. “To be just dependent on one brand is very dangerous, very volatile,” he said.

In addition, with Coach, Kate Spade and Stuart Weitzman, Tapestry over-indexes on accessories, while Michael Kors, Versace and Jimmy Choo owner Capri has more success in ready-to-wear, footwear and licensing. And, while both companies count America as their largest market, Tapestry has comparatively more strength in Asia — which makes up 29% of its business, compared to Capri’s 16% — and Capri is more established in Europe; 28% of its business is generated in the EMEA, compared to 6% for Tapestry.

Meanwhile, Capri stands to gain from Tapestry’s digital prowess, while Tapestry will gain access to the thriving, notoriously stable luxury market.

In early 2020, under CEO Joanna Crevoiserat, Tapestry introduced an Acceleration Program intended to make the company “more agile and data-driven, with a digital-first mindset.” The company has since earned 15 million new customers in North America, more than tripled its digital sales and achieved record annual revenue, at $6.7 billion in 2022.

In mid-July, Robin Barrett Wilson, executive fashion advisor at SAP, noted Tapestry’s recent strength, including its brands’ profitability. She owed that to Crevoiserat’s foresight in establishing a digital-fueled path to “end-to-end” change ahead of the pandemic, which exacerbated the need for digital expertise. During Tuesday’s presentation, Crevoiserat said that the realized ability to scale its advanced data and digital platform was a driving factor in Tapestry’s acquisition of Capri.

Jeffries equity analysts Ashley Helgans and Blake Anderson stated in an email that, while they view the deal as positive for Capri Holdings shareholders, they’re “surprised” by Tapestry’s investment, due, in part, to “the momentum with [its] current strategy.”

According to Crevoiserat, all involved companies will retain their leadership teams, and their combined 33,000 employees will stay intact. But there are “synergies” which will work to save the companies a combined $200 million per year, in three years’ time, she said. Tapestry CFO Scott Roe said the companies will benefit from cost-cutting around corporate facilities, logistics, transportation and the supply chain. As for the supply chain, Tapestry has unique expertise in leather goods production that will work to Capri’s advantage, for example. Lastra called the $200 million goal less than ambitious; he expects the companies’ synergies to result in more savings.

In April, while predicting ongoing consolidation and “a lot of acquisitions” in the luxury sector, Boston Consulting Group head of luxury Sarah Willersdorf called out the “tremendous advantage” of scale for luxury companies. That’s particularly in terms of the “power” it affords them when negotiating with wholesale partners and media, for example.

On that note, Lastra said to expect the six Tapestry, Inc. brands to open more stores: “We all know that when a big prestigious mall opens anywhere in the world, LVMH gets the best store,” he said. “But as they gain more scale and financial resources, the brands will get better stores, in better locations. … That’s part of the synergistic benefits.”

Last week, while recording Glossy’s Week in Review podcast, LVMH came up in two of the three news-based segments: Birkenstock going public would be the second company owned by LVMH investment arm L Catterton to do so this year. Meanwhile, Phoebe Philo is getting ready to launch her namesake brand, which has minority backing from the conglomerate. The repeated mentions of the company prompted a discussion about how “the giants keep getting bigger.” The web of companies that are making LVMH money is clearly expansive.

As such, with six brands and a fraction of LVMH’s annual revenue, which was €79.2 billion in 2022, Tapestry, Inc. has a ways to go before comparisons to the company will seem fitting. Lastra expects that after Tapestry pays off debts associated with this week’s deal, a task slated to take two years, it will ramp up its M&A activity. “This is not going to be the last acquisition,” he said.

However, he said that it’s unclear whether the company will lean into the affordable luxury or premium luxury market. “If they want to play in the champions’ league with the European, premium players, they’ll have to [scoop up] more high-end-positioned brands. And that’s a different ballgame,” in terms of the required investment, he said.

Among the challenges Tapestry, Inc. can expect moving forward is stabilizing Capri’s Michael Kors brand, which has struggled in the wholesale channel, as pointed out by analysts during the presentation. Along with the Asian market, the men’s category and digital capabilities, Crevoiserat said she sees opportunity for the brand in direct sales channels.

“We could have a final destocking of channels that is quite brutal before [the new Tapestry brands] launch their turnaround in 2024,” Listra said.

Tapestry expects Capri to see revenue declines this year, followed by single-digit annual growth over the next three years."

(TPR) the parent company of brands such as Coach and Kate Spade, has acquired Capri Holdings Limited (CPRI), home to brands Versace, Jimmy Choo, and Michael Kors, in a deal worth about $8.5 billion.

“We are confident this combination will deliver immediate value to our shareholders,"" John D. Idol, chairman and CEO of Capri Holdings Limited said in a statement.

As these two global luxury fashion houses come together, here are five lesser-known parent companies of some of the biggest luxury brands in the world.

Key Takeaways Tapestry, Inc. (TPR) the parent company of brands such as Coach and Kate Spade, has acquired Capri Holdings Limited (CPRI), home to brands Versace, Jimmy Choo, and Michael Kors.

The deal was worth an estimated $8.5 billion.

Tapestry and Capri generated a combined revenue of over $12 billion over the last fiscal year, and have a presence in over 75 countries.

Tapestry-Capri

New York-based Tapestry, Inc. was founded in 1941 as Coach Inc., and was listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in 2000. It later became Tapestry, Inc. in 2018, by which time the company had acquired Stuart Weitzman and Kate Spade.

Capri Holdings Limited was founded in 1981 by Michael David Kors, and was originally called Michael Kors Holdings. The company changed its name to Capri Holdings Limited in 2018. The company is headquartered in London.

Tapestry and Capri generated a combined revenue of more than $12 billion over the last fiscal year, and have a presence in more than 75 countries. The brands owned by Tapestry and Capri are: Coach, Kate Spade, Stuart Weitzman, Jimmy Choo, Versace, and Michael Kors.

Some of the brands owned by LVMH include: Louis Vuitton, Tiffany & Co., Givenchy, Marc Jacobs, Bulgari, Dior, Fendi, Celine, Guerlain, Fenty Beauty by Rihanna, Tag Heuer, and more.

Richemont

Switzerland-based luxury goods company Richemont (CFRUY) owns a collection of well-known high-end fashion, jewelry, and watch brands. The company brought in about $21.8 million (19.95 million euros) in sales in fiscal year 2022, an all-time high for the company.

Brands owned by Richemont include: Cartier, Van Cleef & Arpels, Piaget, Chloe, and Net-A-Porter.

Swatch Group

The Swatch Group (SWGAY) makes and sells watches and fine jewelry through its portfolio of luxury brands.

As the world's largest watchmaking company, the Swatch Group supplies nearly all the parts needed for watches sold by the 17 brands in its portfolio. The Swiss company had net sales of $569 million ($499 million Swiss Franc) in 2022.

Some of the luxury watch and jewelry brands owned by Swatch include: Harry Winston, Omega, Balmain and Rado, and Breguet."
Analysis | Louis Vuitton May Finally Get a US Challenge - The Washington Post,"Thu, 10 Aug 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMirAFodHRwczovL3d3dy53YXNoaW5ndG9ucG9zdC5jb20vYnVzaW5lc3MvMjAyMy8wOC8xMC9jb2FjaC1zLXRhcGVzdHJ5LWFuZC12ZXJzYWNlLXMtY2FwcmktY291bGQtbWFrZS1sdXh1cnktZ2lhbnQtbHZtaC1uZXJ2b3VzLzQ3NDc5ZmVjLTM3NjgtMTFlZS1hYzRlLWU3MDc4NzBlNDNkYl9zdG9yeS5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"When Coach owner Tapestry Inc. and Michael Kors parent Capri Holdings Ltd. began their individual acquisition sprees, each had an opportunity to become the US equivalent of LVMH. Fast forward six years, and neither on its own has emulated the success of the world’s biggest luxury group. But they have another chance to become a bling behemoth: Tapestry said on Thursday that it would acquire Capri for an enterprise value of $8.5 billion.

A combination creates a US luxury powerhouse with more than $12 billion of annual revenue and almost $2 billion of underlying operating profit. As well as namesake brands Coach and Michael Kors, Tapestry owns Kate Spade and shoemaker Stuart Weitzman, while Capri is also home to Versace and Jimmy Choo. The enlarged company will also have a more global reach, with Capri’s operations in Europe complementing Tapestry’s presence in Asia.

The combined group would still be dwarfed by the European conglomerates — LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE, Gucci-owner Kering SA and Cartier parent Cie Financiere Richemont SA. But they are be getting closer. And together, Tapestry and Capri would be better able to compete with the European names as well as domestic rivals such as Ralph Lauren Corp.

This is essential, because the last three years have seen a polarization between the biggest players and the rest of the industry. Scale means more funds to make brands stand out. The European giants have been able to invest in the best stores, the most high-profile marketing campaigns and increasingly celebrity designers. Cost savings can be hard to come by in luxury, but Tapestry said it expected to achieve more than $200 million of synergies within three years.

What’s more, after several years of blockbuster growth, luxury sales are starting to settle at a more normal level amid a slowdown in the US and signs that China’s post-Covid return may not be as spectacular as hoped. Even the mighty LVMH had to invest more in the first half of its fiscal year to keep its labels at the forefront of consumers’ minds; it splashed out on Pharrell Williams’ inaugural fashion show for Louis Vuitton menswear in Paris.

Tapestry and Capri mostly operate in the riskier premium part of the market, not at the very top echelons of luxury. It’s the younger and merely comfortable shoppers rather than super-wealthy who are beginning to pull back. The two companies are exposed to just these types of customers.

A combination is not be without its challenges, of course.

Tapestry is offering $57 per share in cash for Capri, a 65% premium to Wednesday’s closing price. Although Capri stock has slumped nearly 50% since February, when the company cut its outlook for the year, that may not be enough to win over investors. The shares were trading as high as about $68 before the warning. Meanwhile, at the proposed valuation, the acquisition multiple is 9 times trailing earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization, well below the about 16 times implied by Kering’s recent purchase of a 30% stake in Valentino. Capri shares rose almost 60% to about $55 in pre-market trading.

The weaker outlook was prompted by Capri’s Michael Kors brand, which has suffered from years of overexposure, department store woes and appealing to customers who are feeling the pinch. These long-term problems will still need to be addressed. But Kors’ issues may be better dealt with as part of a bigger group. Not only will it have more financial firepower, but Tapestry has a strong track record in reviving tired names. It has done a good job revitalizing its flagship brand Coach with more desirable products, effective marketing and high-profile collaborations with Selena Gomez and Jennifer Lopez.

Indeed, the risks of a deal are worth taking. If Tapestry and Capri can get it right, they can be a bigger force in global luxury. There might even be scope to bulk up further, for example, through a deal with Ralph Lauren if its founder ever decides to sell.

The US has always punched below its weight when it comes to luxury. With Tiffany becoming part of LVMH and speculation that Ralph Lauren might eventually follow, the two American names are at least trying to forge a path away from Paris.

“American LVMH”? New Merger Combines Six Big Fashion Brands - JCK,"Mon, 14 Aug 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmpja29ubGluZS5jb20vZWRpdG9yaWFsLWFydGljbGUvbmV3LW1lcmdlci1zaXgtYmlnLWJyYW5kcy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Two prominent U.S. luxury brand conglomerates are merging, and some are wondering if the new combo may create an “American LVMH.”

On Aug. 10, Tapestry—which owns the Coach, Kate Spade, and Stuart Weitzman brands—agreed to buy rival Capri, which owns the Versace, Jimmy Choo, and Michael Kors brands.

The price was $8.5 billion, or $57 per share, which represents a 60% premium over Capri’s 30-day weighted average.

The combined company will have a presence in 75 countries and will be the fourth-largest luxury house in the world, behind LVMH, Richemont, and Kering.

Both Tapestry and Capri are heavily involved in accessories—which will constitute 67% of the new company’s private offerings, according to its investor presentation.

Together, the two companies’ six brands generate over $12 billion in annual sales and $2 billion in annual operating profit. (By contrast, LVMH controls over 70 brands, and its 2022 sales topped $85 billion.)

“Tapestry has long targeted becoming a bona fide ‘house of luxury’ like Kering or LVMH, but its current brands are near-luxe rather than true luxe,” Craig Johnson, president of Customer Growth Partners, told WWD. “Capri gives Tapestry a toehold in the true luxe world—with both Versace and Choo.”

Versace may well be the deal’s “jewel in the crown,” he added, as he feels the brand is “under-penetrated” in North America.

In a statement, Tapestry CEO Joanne Crevoiserat said that the merger “creates a new powerful global luxury house.”

Analysts generally praised the deal, though some flagged concerns. The FT noted that Tapestry is taking on significant debt to acquire Capri, and that the “struggling and not particularly prestigious” Michael Kors brand generates about 70% of Capri’s revenue.

Tapestry was originally known as Coach. It purchased Kate Spade in 1993, and Stuart Weitzman in 2015. It changed its name two years later.

Similarly, Capri began life as Michael Kors. It bought shoemaker Jimmy Choo in 2017, and Versace in 2018, after which it became known as Capri.

The beauty sector, defined as skincare, fragrance, make-up and hair care, generated around US$430 billion in revenue last year, according to McKinsey & Company. The company also predicted that the sector will continue to grow rapidly by six per cent per year.

Among the richest men in the world, Bernard Arnault took the throne from Elon Musk earlier this year – before the Tesla and SpaceX CEO snatched back the title a few days ago, per Forbes. When it comes to ladies, Françoise Bettencourt Meyers has topped the charts for years.

The beauty business not only generates hundreds of billions in profit each year, but also turns out some of the biggest billionaires in the world. So just who are these beauty billionaires?

"Tapestry acquires Capri Holdings in a $8.5B merger that will rival LVMH, increase presence in China - Jing Daily","Fri, 11 Aug 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vamluZ2RhaWx5LmNvbS9wb3N0cy90YXBlc3RyeS1jYXByaS1ob2xkaW5ncy1tZXJnZXItY2hpbmEtbHZtaNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"What happened

Luxury industry insiders were abuzz as Tapestry, the parent company of Coach and Kate Spade, announced its acquisition of Capri Holdings, the umbrella group for Versace and Michael Kors, in a deal worth approximately 8.5 billion on Thursday.

This high-stakes merger is positioned as a direct challenge to European luxury conglomerates LVMH and Kering, which have long dominated the luxury market.

The move comes at a time when luxury retailers, especially in the US, are grappling with changing consumer behaviors and a potential pullback in discretionary spending. Many brands are turning their focus to Chinese consumers, in hopes that the nation’s reopening will see continued post-pandemic rebound spending.

By joining forces, Tapestry and Capri Holdings aim to generate a combined revenue of about 12 billion, bringing together a diverse portfolio of brands, from affordable designer labels like Coach and Kate Spade to high-end houses like Versace and Jimmy Choo.

The consolidated entity will operate under the name Tapestry.

The Jing Take

Tapestry’s strategic move is not only about numbers — it's about positioning.

For years, American luxury brands have been overshadowed by their European counterparts, especially brands under the LVMH and Kering umbrellas. Europe-based brands like Christian Dior, Balenciaga, Gucci, and Saint Laurent, have set the gold standard in luxury fashion. This merger is a clear statement from Tapestry: American luxury is ready to compete on the global stage.

Joanne Crevoiserat, the CEO of Tapestry, emphasized the financial and strategic potential of the merger, noting that it offers an opportunity to ""deepen engagement with luxury customers on the high end."" The acquisition is expected to expand Tapestry's footprint in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa, while Capri's brands will benefit from increased exposure in Asia.

Earlier this year, Capri Holdings sent its executive team to China with the goal of raising its strategic investment in the country. The group also hosted its Michael Kors “Jet Set” event at a Hainan resort in late March, seeking to better engage with a new generation of Chinese consumers following the nation’s reopening.

“China is an important long-term growth opportunity for our three luxury houses, Versace, Jimmy Choo and Michael Kors,” Capri Holdings CEO John Idol stated at the time. “We will continue to increase our strategic investments in the country, including new stores openings and events.”

Meanwhile, in recent years, Tapestry has also set its sights on expanding further in China. In 2022, the firm announced it would open 30 new Coach stores with a specific focus on launching in lower-tier cities across the nation. Tapestry’s strategy to make Coach’s “accessible luxury” even more readily available takes place as China faces a new era of post-pandemic uncertainty and economic downturn.

As for the Tapestry-Capri merger, the road ahead is also not without challenges. The term ""synergies"" was frequently mentioned during investor calls, referring to the benefits derived from pooling resources, sharing digital and marketing capabilities, and optimizing supply chains. But as Simeon Siegel, a retail analyst at BMO Capital Markets pointed out , achieving these synergies is easier said than done.

The luxury market has witnessed a flurry of mergers and acquisitions in recent years. From Kering's stake in Valentino to LVMH's acquisition of Tiffany & Co., the industry is consolidating, driven by the need to diversify portfolios and tap into new markets.

Even with this merger, Tapestry's combined sales will still pale in comparison to the likes of LVMH, which reported sales of €79 billion (86.8 billion) in 2022. The majority of Tapestry's brands target ""aspirational luxury shoppers,"" a segment more susceptible to economic downturns.

And with this merger, Tapestry is clearly eyeing a bigger slice of the luxury pie, aiming to elevate its brands and appeal to a broader, more affluent consumer base. Only time will tell if this American luxury powerhouse can truly rival the European giants, but one thing is clear: The luxury fashion landscape is set for a major shift.

"Cold email landed me my first job at LVMH, says Nespresso's U.K. CEO - Fortune","Thu, 31 Aug 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vZm9ydHVuZS5jb20vZXVyb3BlLzIwMjMvMDgvMzEvY29sZC1lbWFpbC1maXJzdC1qb2ItbHZtaC1uZXNwcmVzc28tdWstY2VvLWFubmEtbHVuZHN0cm9tL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Anna Lundstrom, now at the helm of Nespresso’s U.K. and Ireland operations, once strutted in the world of high-end fashion with Chanel, Louis Vuitton, and Gucci on her résumé.

In an industry notorious for its cutthroat competition and nepotistic tendencies, landing a job at just one of these fashion powerhouses would be the realization of a lifelong dream for many. Yet, the reality is that the world of couture often remains elusive for the average job seeker.

So, how did Lundstrom, a student at the time with no industry connections, manage to penetrate this exclusive world? Surprisingly, it all began with a cold email.

In 2003 Lundstrom was in her final year of university at the London School of Economics and Political Science when she came across a Draper’s interview with Xavier de Royère, the U.K. head of the French luxury powerhouse Hennessy Louis Vuitton (LVMH) at that time.

“He said, ‘We never get applicants from LSE, who want to work in our industry,” she recalls to Fortune. “I was like, oh my goodness, this is a sign.”

She immediately wrote to the LVMH U.K. boss to express her interest in pursuing a career at the company behind high-end brands like Christian Dior, Louis Vuitton, and Tiffany & Co to name a few.

Before long, Lundstrom got a call back from de Royère’s office inviting her for an interview about a project he had in the works.

From there, he offered her an internship which soon turned into her first permanent role after graduating, as the head of CRM (customer relationship management) for Louis Vuitton in the U.K. and Ireland.

Ultimately, it turned out that a cold email provided Lundstrom with the foot in the door that she needed to prove her prowess, work her way up the ladder, and eventually land at Nespresso.

“I think the lesson is to try to find a personal angle and just go for it,” she concludes. “It’s very powerful when you reach out to individuals.”

Want to bag an internship? Give emailing the boss a go

There are many ways of formally applying for internships and breaking into an industry, but Lundstrom still recommends job seekers email the boss to strengthen their chances of bagging a position.

“It’s not the only way but it can show determination and passion if there is a specific reason to it,” she says.

And Lundstrom doesn’t just talk the talk.

Impressed by the students who take the time to find her email address and write to her, she tries to respond to every student who lands in her inbox.

“There might not always be an opportunity within Nespresso. But if I can I try to help them or even have a coffee with them,” she adds. “Now 20 years on, it must be even more challenging not only to know what you want to do but also to understand how things work and how to get forward.”

But don’t fire blanket emails at senior leaders if you want any chance of a response.

“It’s always helpful if there’s a specific reason to it,” Lundstrom advises. “Like when I emailed Xavier, he was the one who said nobody from LSU ever applies so I was responding to a specific quote.”

“I’m sure it’s not the only approach these days, but definitely, it’s one way to at least get some advice,” she concludes."

(which owns Coach, Kate Spade and Stuart Weitzman) inked a deal to acquire Capri Holdings Limited (parent company of Versace, Michael Kors and Jimmy Choo) for $8.5 billion. The acquisition, which is slated to be finalized sometime in 2024, will bring six of the world’s largest designer brands together under one roof, creating a U.S.-based luxury conglomerate that could be capable of competing in a global market largely dominated by LVMH, Kering and Richemont.

Which isn’t to say that the Tapestry x Capri Holdings collaboration poses a threat to European heritage player dominance in the luxury market. The new global fashion group, which will have a presence in 75 countries, generated combined annual sales of more than $12 billion last year, which is nowhere near the $46.6 billion in sales reported by LVMH for just the first half of 2023.

So when Tapestry CEO Joanne Crevoiserat wrote on LinkedIn about competing in the growing $200+ billion global luxury market for new consumers and market segments, she may have had her sights set on Richemont, the parent company of brands like Cartier and Van Cleef & Arpels. It owns around 50 fewer companies than LVMH (LVMHF) and last year reported sales of roughly $18.3 billion.

“By joining with Tapestry, we will have greater resources and capabilities to accelerate the expansion of our global reach while preserving the unique DNA of our brands,” said Capri Holdings CEO John D. Idol in a statement, and that brand DNA might be precisely what helps Tapestry become, if not the LVMH of the U.S., perhaps the Richemont.

Some might wonder how that could work given that luxury consumption in the U.S. has slowed in the past few months. In LVMH’s second-quarter earnings call, chief financial officer Jean-Jacques Guiony reported seeing a decline in shopping by “aspirational customers” in the U.S.—“a special group of customers that were benefiting from subsidies in the Covid pandemic period.”

It may be that Tapestry is hedging its bets on the domestic decline in luxury sales. In a CNBC interview, Crevoiserat suggested the acquisition will let Tapestry reach customers with a more diverse range of incomes. One can imagine that middle-class shoppers who once purchased higher-end entry-level luxury goods might, in leaner times, be more likely to splash out on a Coach tote than a Hermès wallet.

“Tapestry has long targeted becoming a bona fide ‘house of luxury’ like Kering or LVMH, but its current brands are near-luxe rather than true luxe,” Craig Johnson, president of Customer Growth Partners, told WWD, adding that Capri Holdings also offers Tapestry the opportunity to expand into LVMH territory in the future with Versace and Jimmy Choo."

In a recent conference call, LVMH’s CFO Jean-Jacques Guiony said that the company wants to be done with most of the network of stores at Tiffany within “three, four years max,” adding: “That’s a significant capital cost that we have to bear. But frankly, I mean, what we want to do with the brand cannot be done in the existing network. Not one single store apart from the few ones that we have already renovated are up to our standards. And it will take time and a lot of money to redo them.”

In jewelry, “Tiffany enjoyed excellent momentum with the exceptional success of the reopening of the “Landmark” in New York.” Bulgari experienced “strong growth” and the launch of its high jewelry Mediterranea collection saw “outstanding performance.” Likewise, Chaumet and Fred “experienced strong growth over the first half.”"
Stella McCartney on Wanting to Make Fashion More Sustainable - TIME,"Wed, 09 Aug 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vdGltZS5jb20vNjMwMjU2Mi9zdGVsbGEtbWNjYXJ0bmV5LXN1c3RhaW5hYmlsaXR5LWludGVydmlldy1sdm1oL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Stella McCartney doesn’t want you to feel bad. The British fashion designer understands it’s easy to get overwhelmed by all the ways the products we eat, buy, and wear come with unintended consequences—for society, for animals, for the planet. And so even if she’s talking about the harrowing conditions workers suffer in fast-fashion factories or the devastating climate impact of animal agriculture, she’s eager to emphasize that the goal isn’t guilt. It’s hard work to be the best you can be, after all, especially when what many of us want is seemingly impossible: to live more sustainably without giving up the luxuries and conveniences of modern life. We want to look good, feel good, and still somehow do good.

And so McCartney, 51, is trying to make that a little easier. Creator of the first ever vegan “It bag”—the slouchy faux-leather Falabella tote with a sleek silver-chain trim—McCartney has spent her career trying to show the world that ethical choices don’t have to mean compromising on glamour. Since the launch of her namesake label in 2001, she has created luxury clothing that celebrates modern femininity—her brand is a closet staple for countless celebrities—while eschewing leather, feathers, and fur. She also made a name for herself as one of the cool girls of the noughties, out with Kate Moss, Madonna, and Gwyneth Paltrow. (A 2000 Vogue profile called her “a girl who loves to make a little trouble, get a rise, stir things up.”)

Two decades on, she remains a fixture on the high-fashion circuit, making clothing that is known as much for its sharp tailoring, minimal lines, and bold aesthetics as it is for its eco credentials. She’s also a pioneer, collaborating with startups on the cruelty-free, sustainable materials—like grape-based leather, forest-friendly rayon and recycled cashmere—that made up 90% of her latest two collections. “All I’m trying to show is that you don’t need to sacrifice,” she says when we meet in her London office in July. “You’re not being penalized for your choices.”

McCartney had a running start: she’s the daughter of two prominent animal-rights activists who wrote protest letters to companies involved in animal abuse, lobbied against fur, and published vegetarian cookbooks. They also happen to be music royalty: Beatles legend Paul McCartney and the American photographer Linda (who died in 1998), who built a home in the countryside but also took their kids on the road with their band, Wings. “One side was this farm life, and the other side was the stage, with glittery boots and glamour,” McCartney recalls. “It was an early inspiration.”

She has since established herself as a British fashion icon in her own right, designing the uniforms for Team GB Olympic athletes and Meghan Markle’s wedding-reception dress. “It was impossible for fashion to think of luxury and sustainability in the same breath before Stella changed that,” Anna Wintour, chief content officer of Condé Nast and global editorial director at Vogue, writes over email.

McCartney’s work increasingly extends beyond her own label: in the past few years, she has met world leaders at the G-7 and the U.N. Climate Change Conference and co-founded the $200 million Collab SOS fund for climate solutions. As sustainability became a business imperative, her brand became more desirable. In 2018, she bought back the 50% stake that Kering had held for 17 years—only to team up the following year with Kering’s chief rival, LVMH (Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton). There, she was appointed special adviser on sustainability to CEO Bernard Arnault, one of the world’s richest men, who said in a statement that “a decisive factor was that she was the first to put sustainability and ethical issues on the front stage, very early on.”

The minority stake provides both the freedom and the cash to continue innovations that might not turn a profit. Her namesake brand reported a loss of more than $40 million in 2021, the third consecutive year of a loss of more than $38 million, following the split from Kering and the business challenges of the pandemic. Now, as McCartney brings more eco-friendly materials into her own collections, she also collaborates with LVMH—Europe’s largest company by market value—to encourage its other maisons (among them Loewe, Dior, and Givenchy) to do the same.

In an era when many make claims to sustainability, few have been doing it as well, as stylishly—or as long—as McCartney. “When I first started, I was definitely the eco weirdo in the room,” she says. “But why would I compromise what I believe in morally to go into an industry I’m passionate about?”

Raised vegetarian, McCartney traces her connection with nature to her childhood, which she spent riding horses on a remote Scottish farm and hiking trails in Arizona. Her parents may have been icons, but Linda, who had rejected her Park Avenue life to tour with rock stars, and Paul, the working-class Liverpudlian who became a household name in his 20s, wanted to keep their family grounded. They chose to send their four children to local schools, opting against the private education favored by wealthy Brits. “They had to take a bit of flak for having a famous dad, but it toughened them up,” Sir Paul McCartney recalls, sitting in his office overlooking London’s Soho Square. A Wurlitzer jukebox glows in one corner, and he points out a pair of spectacles that once belonged to René Magritte, a present from Linda. “Now I’m just showing off,” the 81-year-old says, laughing.

He and Linda always had “slightly offbeat tastes in fashion,” he adds, and from a young age, Stella would spend hours pulling together outfits from their shared closet. In 1997, just two years after graduating from Central St. Martins, the renowned art and design school in London, 25-year-old McCartney was appointed to succeed Karl Lagerfeld as creative director of Chloé in Paris. ""More Clueless Than Couture,"" a Vogue headline read at the time. “I think they should have taken a big name,” Lagerfeld sniped of his successor. “They did—but in music, not fashion.”

“She had to prove herself,” her father says. “I said, if she doesn’t do well at the end of that year, then the name is not something to help, it’s a cudgel to beat her with. But she did well.”

At Chloé, where McCartney worked with her former classmate Phoebe Philo, the pair injected a raunchy sensibility into a French house known for soft femininity, designing low-slung skintight pants, see-through gold-chain tank tops, and skimpy sequin dresses. McCartney also stuck to her values; no collection she’s ever designed has used animal products. She acknowledges that her ability to uphold her convictions comes partly from being the daughter of one of the most successful men on the planet. “As one of the first nepo babies,” she says wryly, “I had the privilege of choice. I’m very aware of how lucky I’ve been to be accepted to work in this way since day one.” Aja Barber, a stylist and author of Consumed: The Need for Collective Change: Colonialism, Climate Change, and Consumerism, commends how McCartney has used her platform to drive change. “The fashion industry runs on privilege and nepotism,” she says. “So why isn’t everyone making the same choices that Stella McCartney is making?”

Those choices are not always an easy sell to CEOs. “I’ve had moments where I’ve been challenged very heavily to change my morals for the success of the company,” McCartney says, recounting instances when she was urged to incorporate leather into her line for better margins. (She has appealed to leaders to review policies that may favor leather goods over synthetic ones.)

But if fashion is meant to be about dreams and fantasy and escaping from reality, as McCartney says, that makes it hard to force a broader reckoning with its harms. The industry was responsible for more than 2 billion metric tons of greenhouse-gas emissions in 2018—equivalent to the output of the U.K., France, and Germany combined—according to McKinsey. Around 60% of all clothing winds up in landfills or incinerators within a year of production—the equivalent of a truckload of used clothing being dumped or burned every second. While cheap, accessible fast fashion drives much of the environmental degradation, luxury brands aren’t exempt: in 2017, Burberry notoriously destroyed $37 million worth of merchandise to maintain its reputation of exclusivity. (It has since stopped the practice.) Every year, the global leather industry—on which luxury fashion houses depend—is involved in slaughtering more than a billion animals, while tannery workers are exposed to toxic chemicals. “That is the glamorous industry of fashion,” McCartney says.

While concerns over animal cruelty were always front of mind, McCartney’s focus expanded after the publication of a 2006 U.N. report that stated that livestock production is responsible for more emissions than the entire global transport sector. In response, she launched the Meat-Free Monday campaign in the U.K. with her father and her sister Mary, encouraging the public to adopt a weekly meat-free day, and examining how to make her own lines more sustainable. Paul says Stella’s strategy of offering people better, ethical alternatives—rather than guilt-tripping them—was inspired by her mother, who launched a successful vegetarian-food business. “Linda was a pioneer and she was very strong, very ballsy, like Stella is,” he says. “It’s difficult. But she’s showing it’s not that difficult.”

In the bright white lobby of the Stella McCartney offices in West London, scenes from her widely praised show at Paris Fashion Week in March play on loop. Dappled gray horses canter alongside models wearing her Winter 2023 collection: furry overcoats, checked blazers, sharply tailored jackets, silky asymmetric dresses. The models sport thigh-high boots and carry handbags that, though you could never tell, are made from grapes, apples, or other plant-based materials.

Vegan fashion may not harm animals, but it can still harm the planet. Most vegan leathers are made from polyurethane (PU) or polyvinyl chloride (PVC), which can release microplastics into the environment. McCartney’s team hopes to minimize such effects by working closely with startups to find greener alternatives that can match the quality and durability of leather. It’s an incredibly complex, costly, and lengthy process: McCartney’s team starts by testing swatches of each new material, examining its feel, scent, resistance to scratching or tearing; they then make a prototype handbag to test its color retention and strength. Feedback is relayed to the scientists to refine the material over months and years. A major part of the work, McCartney says, is communicating their needs to scientists unfamiliar with the fashion industry. “I know the product needs to be tested in this way, to drape, to breathe,” she says, “to say ‘That color doesn’t work’ or ‘That fabric cracks.’” When the Stella McCartney team first met with NFW, the company that makes Mirum—a plant-based, plastic-free, and circular leather alternative—in March 2022, the material was too thick for anything other than firm, structured bags. But through working with them, a thinner, more flexible option is now available.

These collaborations often involve startups in early stages of development, and scaling for wider uptake will likely take years. And even after all that, achieving 100% sustainability is challenging; with the exception of Mirum, bio-based leathers require a PU coating to prevent scratching.

Working with small startups can also be unpredictable. In 2022, Stella McCartney produced the world’s first-ever Mylo luxury handbag made from mycelium, the rootlike system of fungi, but Mylo recently halted production because it wasn’t able to fundraise enough. Other materials can be impractical: her collaboration with startup Radiant Matter on biodegradable sequins led to Cara Delevingne wearing a Stella McCartney–designed BioSequin jumpsuit on Vogue’s April 2023 cover—but each fragile sequin had to be hand-stitched. And other non-PVC sequins lack the color range of traditional ones. “I get driven and angry,” McCartney says of the limitations she faces compared with her peers. “But these are the kinds of things that make me want to get up in the morning.”

The results, she feels, are worth it. Her Winter 2023 collection includes a version of the brand’s iconic Falabella made from Mirum, as well as over-the-knee boots made of Vegea, derived from wine-grape waste, and faux-crocodile handbags made from AppleSkin, a by-product of juice and jam production. There’s a particular thrill McCartney feels when customers have no idea that they’re buying shoes made from grapes, or a blouse made of regenerative cotton. “We can win if there’s no sacrifice on a dream,” she says, “on desirability, on luxury, on escapism.”

Despite her success, McCartney still has her detractors. She tells me several times that she is not perfect and that her brand isn’t either. Though she has a focus on reusing stock and waste material, she’s still in the business of making new products—though it’s unlikely an $1,100 Mirum handbag would be thrown out quickly. “My solutions aren’t there price-point wise,” McCartney says, noting that she encourages her four children to buy second-hand clothing at charity shops over fast fashion. She also has a sportswear collaboration with Adidas. “I’m a firm believer in less is more. Buying luxury—something made well, that is a timeless design—is an investment, and now there are businesses that support resale and rental.” (Stella McCartney was the first official brand partner of luxury consignment site The RealReal.)

There’s also the question of how feasible it is for McCartney to really make change within LVMH. CEO Arnault may have praised McCartney’s values, but just a few months after their deal, he publicly criticized climate activist Greta Thunberg for “surrendering completely to catastrophism.” Ever since her early days at Kering, McCartney has been accused of getting into bed with the fur-wearing, leather-toting enemy—something she describes as “infiltrating from within.” She has a history of success: in 2010, she banned the use of the notoriously toxic PVC at her label, a move later adopted by all Kering brands, from Saint Laurent to Balenciaga. Industry norms may be stubborn, but McCartney says the work at LVMH has been exciting and rewarding. “If I can have a seat at that table—where the decisions are still made—I want to be there. I’m pleased to say it’s not just bullsh-t.”

The partnership with LVMH, she says, is already yielding results. McCartney’s Summer 2023 collection includes a T-shirt made from 100% regenerative cotton, a first in luxury, emblazoned with a blue “Snog a Log” graphic—a classic example of what Wintour calls McCartney’s “wonderfully tongue-in-cheek sense of humor.” Since 2019, the brand has been working with Soktas, a family-owned cotton producer in Turkey, to help it transition away from conventional cotton farming, which uses harmful chemicals to control pests and boost production. The regenerative-cotton project started with 5 hectares and grew to 55 in 2022, her team says; LVMH has now taken over the Soktas funding, which will further expand the project.

That helps keep McCartney going. But behind it all is a drive to connect with consumers through her clothes. She considers fashion a service industry. When she’s working on a collection, she’s thinking about how a Stella McCartney-designed piece should make you feel: confident, comfortable, alive, effortless, sensual. “I want to feel the best version of myself,” she says, her eyes lit up. “I want to feel f-cking fabulous.”

Versace’s parent company has announced it’s being bought by the luxury goods group Tapestry.

In a new deal worth $8.5 billion (approximately €7.75bn), Capri Holdings is being taken over by Tapestry, whose existing brands include high-end names like Coach and Kate Spade.

Capri Holdings will also be passing over ownership of labels such as Michael Kors and Jimmy Choo.

In a statement from Tapestry's boss Joanne Crevoiserat, the company said the deal ""creates a new powerful global luxury house"".

Fashion industry analysts are already surmising the buyout will be the foundation for a rival to compete with European fashion giants, like Kering and LVMH.

The France-based industry behemoths own some of the biggest brands in fashion, including Gucci, Saint Laurent and Balenciaga (Kering) and Givenchy, Louis Vuitton and Dior (LVMH).

Versace itself, founded in Milan 45 years ago, has long been seen as a symbol of luxury, Tapestry’s brands are often seen as more accessible for aspirational consumers.

Pieces from the likes of Michael Kors and Kate Spade tend to start around the €100 mark, making them a little more affordable than the thousands of euros high-end luxury brands often charge for clothing and accessories.

However, Michael Kors is currently suffering a dip, following years of underperformance. It’s a risk to take on, industry experts say, but Tapestry has a solid history of turning around suffering brands. Among other triumphs, it managed to invigorate the struggling Kate Spade when it took the label over in 2017.

As well as the challenge of trying to turn around the fortune of Michael Kors, Tapestry is also faced with a difficult time for the industry. Inflation has shot up in many countries, squeezing consumer spending and hitting hard the pockets of aspirational shoppers.

The Tapestry deal is set to go ahead next year and is the second time in five years that Versace has been sold.

Michael Kors acquired the Italian label in 2018, paying over €1.8 billion for the company, owned by the Versace family for decades.

Along with Jimmy Choo, which it had purchased in 2017, Michael Kors set up Capri Holdings as an umbrella company - perhaps proving that fashion can truly be cyclical."
"Luxury Brands Want the Aspirational Shopper, But Not at a Discount - PYMNTS.com","Tue, 01 Aug 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnB5bW50cy5jb20vbmV3cy9yZXRhaWwvMjAyMy9sdXh1cnktYnJhbmRzLXdhbnQtdGhlLWFzcGlyYXRpb25hbC1zaG9wcGVyLWJ1dC1ub3QtYXQtYS1kaXNjb3VudC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"When consumers don’t spend, retailers typically think to offer a discount. But discounts, as we all know, can become a slippery slope. What lengths will a luxury retailer go to get the “aspirational shopper” to continue to shop?

The question arises due to the difference in spending behaviors between affluent Americans and aspirational shoppers. The divergence has urged luxury retailers to explore alternative revenue streams and, in some cases, modify their merchandise strategies.

However, in the realm of luxury and aspirational shoppers, the dynamics appear to be different. It becomes a delicate balancing act to preserve the brand’s luxury image.

As an illustration, French luxury conglomerate LVMH, which owns brands like Louis Vuitton, Christian Dior, Tiffany, and other luxury labels, was successful during the pandemic, because of an increase in aspirational spending from U.S. shoppers earning below $100,000.

Last year, middle-income shoppers, with surplus cash on hand, indulged in luxurious handbags and perfumes, contributing to LVMH’s profits. However, the current year paints a contrasting picture as inflation, economic uncertainty, and dwindling reserves lead the majority of U.S. consumers to exercise caution in their spending.

“The aspirational customer is suffering a bit,” said Jean-Jacques Guiony, LVMH’s CFO, during the company’s earnings call July 25, citing lower sales online and in “second-tier cities.”

Guiony attributed the decline in U.S. sales to a decrease in spending by aspirational consumers on entry-level products. He hinted that the diminishing impact of stimulus payments could have played a role.

“If we assume that that group was benefitting from subsidies during COVID, those come to an end at some point,” Guiony said.

In contrast, Guiony noted that LVMH’s high-priced goods are faring well in the U.S., likely due to wealthier shoppers being less affected by inflation, student debt, and economic fluctuations.

In June, the jewelry company Signet, which owns Kay, Jared, and Zales, linked its declining sales to a reduction in spending by aspirational customers who tend to make occasional purchases of goods priced between $300 and $800 but are more mindful of their spending when it comes to essential items.

According to Signet’s Chief Financial Officer, Joan Hilson, sales declined in fashion jewelry priced below $5,000 starting in April, and this trend continued through June. However, items priced above $5,000 remained robust.

According to Hilson, Signet is expanding its services to drive spending, with a particular focus on increasing sales of warranty and protection plans for watches and jewelry. A protection plan for a $3,200 tennis bracelet at Kay adds an additional $315 to the price.

Why Luxury Won’t Be Discounted

This probably goes without saying, but luxury wouldn’t be luxury if it were attainable. Nevertheless, there are some nuances and blurred lines within this notion.

Adopting a markdown strategy similar to big-box stores may generate short-term sales for a luxury brand, but it would have negative consequences in the long run. Luxury brands heavily rely on their image of exclusivity and rarity. In the pursuit of short-term gains, a luxury retailers risks diluting its brand identity.

LVMH is placing its trust in the younger generation to expand its influence, as emphasized by Guiony, with a goal of intensifying the desirability of its brands. But that doesn’t mean LVMH goods will be offered at a discount.

But that doesn’t also mean the aspirational customer is unattainable. According to retail industry expert and consultant Hitha Herzog, luxury retailers generate a significant portion of their revenue from lower-priced products, such as sunglasses, wallets and perfumes which cater to the aspirational market.

Additionally, Herzog stressed that LVMH’s global presence and range of brands provide the company with a stronger ability to weather fluctuations in consumer behavior.

The Future the Aspirational Shopper

Organizing high-profile events is an effective approach to promote the brand’s message, enhance its image, and cater to the ultra-wealthy, while simultaneously targeting the aspirational shopper.

Take Gucci and Saks Fifth Avenue, which have initiated efforts aimed at catering to their top clients. While these initiatives target the ultra-wealthy to encourage spending, they also employ a luring tactic that creates FOMO (fear of missing out) for the aspirational shopper.

According to Guiony, the marketing blitz leading up to the mega-budget fashion show on the Pont Neuf in Paris, featuring Pharrell Williams, was a highly successful venture. This event garnered over a billion views for Louis Vuitton. Guiony acknowledged that the cost of these initiatives was substantial, but he deemed it a worthwhile investment."

Carrera Chronograph 60th Anniversary | Image: TAG Heuer

TAG Heuer Carrera Chronograph 60th Anniversary Edition

Six decades after the original Carrera watch was unveiled, TAG Heuer has revisited the classic silhouette. The heritage-themed timepiece is limited to just 600 examples worldwide and judging by the first look, they’ll go quickly. The TAG Heuer Carrera 60th Anniversary Edition takes inspiration from the 1960s 2447 SN reference and features the iconic ‘panda’ dial. Unlike the original’s hand-wound Valjoux movement, however, the new 39mm iteration is backed by some seriously modern firepower.

Inside the sapphire crystal case back, you find the Heuer 02, TAG Heuer’s 80-hour in-house automatic chronograph calibre. A powerful piece of horological technology, this calibre brings the timepiece into the modern age, however, it does keep many of the design hallmarks that made the ref.2447 SN special. The 60th Anniversary Editions arrives in a polished steel case, topped by a raised profile ‘glass box’ in sapphire crystal, which, along with the vintage pushers, beige lume and slimline tension ring around the dial’s outer edge, gives the watch much of its retro look.

Aquaracer Professional 200 Solargraph | Image: TAG Heuer

TAG Heuer Aquaracer Professional 200 Solargraph

After stunning Watches & Wonders last year with the Aquaracer Solargraph, TAG Heuer has returned with a new edition. The Aquaracer Professional 200 Solargraph takes many of the lessons learned from the initial solar-powered machine and builds upon them, with remarkable results. This time around, the Solargraph is wrapped in titanium, improving quality and durability even further. Best of all, there’s no need to change the watch’s battery as it’s recharged by the sun or artificial light.

“A two-minute exposure to direct sunlight is enough to power the watch for an entire day,” TAG Heuer said. “Once fully charged, after less than 20 hours in the sun, the watch can run for up to six months with no light exposure. If the timepiece stops ticking, it only needs exposure to any light source for ten seconds to get it started again, thanks to its ultra-efficient recharge time.”

In order to make the new Solargraph work, TAG Heuer partnered with the Manufacture La Joux-Perret in La Chaux-de-Fonds, Switzerland to develop a new calibre TH50-00. Developed and manufactured exclusively for TAG Heuer, the Caliber TH50-00 has a five-year extended warranty, ensuring peace of mind when out on the trails. TAG Heuer revealed that the new Aquaracer Professional 200 Solargraph will be available for purchase starting in February 2023.

TAG Heuer Monza Flyback Chronometer

The long-fabled relationship between TAG Heuer and motorsport took another step at LVMH Watch Week 2023, courtesy of the Monza Flyback Chronometer. The special edition 42mm timepiece is made of ultra-lightweight resistant carbon and features a striking black dial with two-register layout. More specifically, you can find a translucent fumé blue sapphire crystal chronograph counter at 3 and the permanent second at 6 o’clock, while the unique skeletonised dial reveals the stunning in-house Calibre Heuer 02 Flyback movement underneath.

For racing fans, the new TAG Heuer Monza Flyback Chronometer offers three functions designed for the track. Namely, a chronograph, a tachymeter scale that indicates average speed for a 1-kilometre or 1-mile distance and a pulsometer, which helps determine one’s heart rate per minute. From there, red details on the dial such as the sub-counter hands and the framing of the date window are designed to evoke “exhilarating speed and racing hearts”, which, judging by the reaction in the room was this was first unveiled, it has nailed.

“We are delighted to reintroduce the TAG Heuer Monza, one of our most important designs that holds such rich emotional and historic motorsport heritage,” Frédéric Arnault, CEO of TAG Heuer said. “The 2023 TAG Heuer Monza is a very special reinterpretation of its famed ancestor, in which its unmistakable racing spirit comes alive in a bold and resolutely modern way, showcasing TAG Heuer’s most advanced expertise in dial design and performance timekeeping.”

A major focus for TAG Heuer over LVMH Watch Week 2023 was the Connected line. TAG Heuer’s marquee smartwatch range copped a host of fresh faces, including the 45mm Connect Calibre E4 Sport Edition. With a number of new functions and a redesigned strap, the Sport Edition can now monitor any sporting activity with a wider range of data, including a new Trail & Hiking application for runners and adventurers. TAG Heuer has also boosted the steel crown with a rubber insert on all 45-mm models, making it easier to grip, even with wet hands.

DEFY Skyline Skeleton | Image: Zenith

Zenith DEFY Skyline Skeleton

Zenith kicked off its LVMH Watch Week 2023 campaign with a number of new additions to the DEFY Skyline range, the most important of which was the DEFY Skyline Skeleton. With two variations, a blue-toned openworked dial or a black-toned openworked dial, the new releases represent a more modern approach to watchmaking from LVMH Group’s most revered producer. According to Zenith CEO Julien Tornare, the latest DEFY Skyline Skeleton pieces were inspired by modern cityscapes where structures and light are bound in a constantly moving interplay.

“In just one year, the DEFY Skyline has become one of the most in-demand lines for Zenith. Its strong visual identity, unique movement and effortless versatility have made it a compelling choice within the sporty steel bracelet segment,” Tornare said. “It’s a purely modern creation that’s full of details that carry on the enduring legacy of the DEFY collection that goes back to 1969. This year, the collection is growing with a new skeleton version featuring a bold and futuristic design, as well as mid-size unisex version of the DEFY Skyline in 36mm with some vibrant dial colours. We’re really excited to witness the completion of the DEFY collection with these dynamic new references.”

Importantly, Zenith claims the new release is the world’s first skeleton watch featuring a 1/10th of a second indicator. Housed within an angular 41mm steel case at 6 o’clock, you’ll find the constantly running 1/10th of a second counter making steady jumps in fixed increments, completing one revolution every 10 seconds. It’s a unique function that is powered by the high-frequency automatic El Primero 3620 SK calibre, whihc is. among the traditional maison’s best-loved movements. Truly stunning work from Zenith.

Zenith DEFY Skyline Boutique

After the success of the DEFY Skyline Collection last year, it’s little wonder Zenith has returned with a boutique-exclusive edition. The new Zenith DEFY Skyline Boutique is a 41mm steel release with a characteristic dodecagonal bezel that recalls the original DEFY wristwatches from the 1960s. Where this one differed, however, is in the radiant anthracite dial, which arrives engraved with a rose gold motif and set with rose gold hands and hour markers. Perhaps most impressive of all, Zenith has managed to capture a constellation of golden stars twinkling against the night sky by recalling the ZENITH emblem found in past references, engraving them on the dial, and then plating them with rose gold.

Much like the Zenith DEFY Skyline Skeleton, this release is powered by the El Primero 3620 automatic high-frequency calibre and features a unique running 1/10th of a second indicator that’s driven directly from the 5Hz escapement. The DEFY Skyline Boutique Edition is delivered on a steel bracelet with a satin-brushed surface with chamfered and polished edges, seamlessly following the contours of the angular case.

For its final release for LVMH Watch Week 2023, Zenith set its phasers to ‘extreme’. Following the DEFY Extreme Desert that was unveiled back in 2021, the new DEFY Extreme Glacier represents the collection’s most durable and rugged piece, capable of withstanding the most torrid of conditions

Inspired by frozen barren landscapes, this stunning piece of horological ingenuity features a titanium case, designed specifically to protect the pushers, while the dodecagonal bezel is crafted from chalcedony, a crystalline semi-translucent stone with a pale blue hue. Like its stablemates, the DEFY Extreme Glacier’s open dial reveals the inner workings of the innovative and singular El Primero 1/100th of a second automatic high-frequency chronograph calibre. Here, you’ll find two regulating organs beating at 50Hz for the chronograph and 5Hz for the timekeeping.

Keeping with the ice-cold theme, the chronograph counters are made in a transparent sapphire crystal that has been treated to a frosted finish. The DEFY Extreme Glacier is made in a limited edition of 50 pieces, available exclusively at ZENITH physical and online boutiques.

Big Bang Tourbillon Automatic Saxem Yellow Neon | Image: Hublot

Hublot Big Bang Tourbillon Automatic Saxem Yellow Neon

For LVMH Watch Week 2023, avant-garde specialist Hublot went out of this world, quite literally. The watchmaker unveiled the Big Bang Tourbillon Automatic Saxem Yellow Neon, a new variation of the hit timepiece crafted from (you guessed it) Saxem, a material often used in satellites and lasers. While you could argue the goal in using the material was to make the timepiece more robust, in essence, Hublot has harnessed Saxem as a method to produce unique colourways – this time opting for a neon yellow semi-translucent finish. According to Hublot CEO Ricardo Guadalupe, the process to nail the colour was harder than you may think.

“It has taken us almost three years of research, after the MP-11 Emerald Green to develop a new colour fit for our Big Bang that would be totally transparent and completely resistant,” Guadalupe said. ” Once again, Hublot is pushing the possibilities of technology and aesthetics and fuses them to create a unique neon yellow manufacture piece.”

Colourways aside, the new Big Bang is also a stunningly intricate piece. It is powered by the HUB6035 self-winding manufacture calibre, complete with a micro-rotor so as to not conceal the back of the movement. The fully-skeletonised design allows for complete visibility, which is key when you have an addition as complex as a tourbillon at the heart. Limited to just 50 pieces worldwide, the Hublot Big Bang Tourbillon Automatic Saxem Yellow Neon is priced at a cool CHF 200,000 (AUD$310,000).

In addition to the hyper-colour Saxem release, Hublot also revealed two similarly glitzy new Big Bangs. The Hublot Big Bang Integrated Rainbow and Big Bang Unico Time Only Rainbow arrived adorned with a series of translucent gemstones of varying colours, responsible for their namesake’s design. A mixture of ruby, amethyst, blue topaz, tsavorite and a bevy of coloured sapphires make up the two timepieces, with 174 on the Big Bang Integrated and 176 on the Time Only, respectively.

Interestingly, these new watches are also cut from King Gold, a Hublot specialty that the brand claims offers a ‘warmer fold colour’ than the traditional 18K 5N. Separting the two pieces is the movement within, with the 42mm Integrated chronograph powered by the Unico manufacture self-winding, while the 40mm Time Only features the MHUB1710 self-winding movement.

Fans of Hublot will note that the brand has been supporting SORAI – Save Our Rhinos Africa India – an organisation founded by Hublot ambassador and former test cricket star Kevin Pieterson, since 2019. For Watch Week this year, the brand reaffirmed its commitment to the enterprise by releasing the new Big Bang Unico Sorai, the third such watch to feature in the series. As with the previous two, part of the proceeds from the sale of the 100 pieces will be donated to SORAI, helping to keep rhinos safe from poachers.

This latest Hublot Big Bang Unico Sorai arrives in a polished and micro-blasted rhino-grey ceramic developed specifically for the piece and comes complete with an openworked dial in stunning colour. Inside the 44mm case, you’ll find the Unico self-winding manufacture movement with a 72-hour power reserve.

Revisiting Carlo Crocco’s original design, Hublot took a stab at a new series of Classic Fusion releases as well. Copping the instantly recognisable rubber strap, it’s easy to see where the brand has based its foundations, however, there are a bunch of new additions thrown in for good measure. This time around, the logo is a little more contemporary and the addition of new case materials certainly hasn’t been lost on fans. There are now yellow gold, titanium and ceramic models, each available in 42mm, 38mm and 33mm. There’s not a huge amount that has changed on this one but you could argue that it is a good thing.

For LVMH Watch Week 2023, fine jewellery producer Bulgari reimagined one of its most revered necklaces as a stunning piece of horological ingenuity. Eight of the iconic fan-shape designs that the Diva’s Dream is best known for now sit around a mother-of-pearl dial, framing the timepiece with unparalleled glamour. In between each fan, Bulgari has dropped a series of large gemstones, giving an even more outrageous finish.

The mosaic tapestry-like effect gives the finish a more art-deco aesthetic, which feels fittingly lavish. At 37mm, this Mosaic is a big step up in size from the standard Diva’s Dream, but the addition of the mechanical BVL 191 movement with automatic winding makes this a necessity.

As to be expected, the new piece arrives dripping in diamonds, but there is an interesting change-up in terms of design. This new piece sees the iconic Tubogas technology, which is responsible for the coiling, spring-action movement of the bracelet, weave its magic through both the case and bracelet components, which feature a string of precious gems.

These Luxury Retail Stocks Have Been Crushing the Market for the Past Decade - The Motley Fool,"Sat, 05 Aug 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIzLzA4LzA1L3RoZXNlLWx1eHVyeS1yZXRhaWwtc3RvY2tzLWhhdmUtYmVlbi1jcnVzaGluZy10aGUv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Hermes and LVMH Moet Hennessy have been beating the market for years.

The stock market and overall U.S. economy appear to be moving in the right direction. Although inflation remains above the Federal Reserve's target of 2%, it has been consistently cooling (falling to 3% in June). The markets seem OK with how higher interest rates are impacting the economy and consumer demand. After all, the S&P 500 index is up 17% year to date, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite is up 33%.

While big tech has dominated the headlines this year for various reasons, from mass layoffs to advances in artificial intelligence (AI), the luxury retail sector has quietly been beating the market. Oh, and it's been doing so for over a decade.

Two European powerhouses, Hermes International (HESAY -1.47%) and LVMH Moet Hennessy (LVMHF -1.57%), have been leading the charge in luxury retail for quite some time. While each has become synonymous with status-symbol accessories and products, there is much more to their underlying businesses. Namely, each company is a worldwide brand reaching consumers of all ages across the globe.

In this article, I will explore some of the catalysts fueling the boom in sales of luxury goods. While most people may not be able to afford these companies' products, their stocks are much more accessible and buying them could prove to be a savvy investing decision in the long run.

Rock-solid financials are always in style

Through June, Hermes generated 6.7 billion euros in revenue, a 25% increase year over year. That revenue growth helped fuel impressive gains to its gross margin, which rose 120 basis points from the prior-year period to 72.2%. Operating margin hit a peak of 44.0% year to date, and the expanding margins dropped right to the bottom line as net income rose 36% year over year to 2.2 billion euros.

If this weren't impressive enough, Hermes generated 1.7 billion euros in adjusted free cash flow during the period, up 21% year over year, and it paid out 1.4 billion euros in dividends.

Similarly, LVMH Moet Hennessy delivered strong financial results during the first six months of 2023. It generated 42.2 billion euros in revenue and expanded its gross margin slightly to 69.4%. Moreover, the company's net profit grew 30% year over year to 8.5 billion euros, far outpacing top-line growth of 15%.

An important metric to note is that LVMH Moet Hennessy's operating free cash flow actually declined to 1.8 billion euros -- less than half of what it was during the first six months of 2022. However, this dynamic can be traced to a significant increase in operating investments, namely in the form of real estate for its retail brands.

What is pushing luxury retail higher?

Nearly half of Hermes' revenue in the first half stemmed from the Asia/Pacific region (excluding Japan). Management commented on this growth, highlighting healthy trends in Greater China as well as Singapore, Thailand, Australia, and South Korea. Furthermore, due to the extensive and strict zero-COVID lockdowns that China was imposing in various regions as recently as last year, results in 2023 signal that region is rebounding strongly and consumers are out shopping. LVMH Moet Hennessy also had strong results in Asia (excluding Japan); nearly one-third of its sales year to date stemmed from that region.

Another notable takeaway from LVMH Moet Hennessy is that 23% of its sales came from Europe. This is interesting because Europe's economy has been in a contraction period for several months, and yet demand from luxury shoppers seems unfazed.

Should you invest?

The chart above illustrates the performance of both Hermes and LVMH Moet Hennessy stocks and benchmarks them against the S&P 500 over the last decade.

There are some important takeaways when analyzing this chart. First and foremost, the broad market has performed well over the last 10 years. An investment in an S&P 500 exchange-traded fund would be well on its way to tripling in value, underscoring how challenging it can be to the beat the market.

That said, LVMH Moet Hennessy and Hermes have done so handily with returns approximately two to three times higher than the S&P 500. That performance makes it clear just how resilient luxury retail companies can be, even in periods of economic uncertainty, as the two stocks made their biggest gains during the global pandemic.

This dynamic tells us a few things. First, as my fellow Motley Fool contributor Neil Rozenbaum points out, a good portion of luxury buyers are already wealthy. And despite sluggish economic growth across the European continent, wealthy people have the means to shop during all sorts of economic conditions.

Perhaps more importantly, a more macro takeaway could be that the luxury retail segment is more insulated from downturns than other areas of the consumer discretionary market, making it a tempting addition to a well-diversified portfolio. The combination of strong growth, expanding profitability, and dividend income makes this pair of world-class luxury retailers a compelling investment opportunity."
Versace’s new owner wants to be a big beast. But it’s no match for Europe’s behemoths - The Guardian,"Thu, 10 Aug 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigQFodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGVndWFyZGlhbi5jb20vZmFzaGlvbi8yMDIzL2F1Zy8xMC92ZXJzYWNlcy1uZXctb3duZXItd2FudHMtdG8tYmUtYS1iaWctYmVhc3QtYnV0LWl0cy1uby1tYXRjaC1mb3ItZXVyb3Blcy1iZWhlbW90aHPSAYEBaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAudGhlZ3VhcmRpYW4uY29tL2Zhc2hpb24vMjAyMy9hdWcvMTAvdmVyc2FjZXMtbmV3LW93bmVyLXdhbnRzLXRvLWJlLWEtYmlnLWJlYXN0LWJ1dC1pdHMtbm8tbWF0Y2gtZm9yLWV1cm9wZXMtYmVoZW1vdGhz?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"For the past two years, Coach, Michael Kors and Kate Spade New York have been the cornerstone of a particular type of New York fashion.

A bit ritzy without being eye-wateringly expensive, they mushroomed during the 1990s and 2000s, defining American leisure-glamour – the sort of thing you might see in Sex and the City then and Real Housewives of New York now – and rolling it out for a wealthy middle class who wanted attainable handbags they could save up for, rather than just the 0.1% who had money to burn.

So in one sense, having them under one roof at Tapestry, alongside old-school accessory brands Stuart Weitzman and Jimmy Choo – with a boost from the ritiziest of all, Versace – should be enough to shunt nostalgic American fashion back into the limelight.

After all, an $8.5bn (£6.7bn) acquisition is a lot of money. Except that, when you consider that French fashion colossus LVMH acquired Tiffany for $16bn alone back in 2021, it’s a drop in the conglomerate ocean. LVMH is worth more than $450bn. The Americans might be coming, but it’ll take a lot more to get anywhere close to the Europeans.

For the past few years, luxury fashion has been dominated by LVMH and its rival, Kering – two Paris-based conglomerates that own about 100 huge, household-name-level brands between them.

The ascent of LVMH, in particular – whose founder, Bernard Arnault, overtook Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos as the world’s wealthiest person at one stage this year – is not only a testament to the resilience of fashion, but the speed at which a brand can grow. LVMH controls 75 brands, including Louis Vuitton, Dior and Fendi, and has the power to get Pharrell Williams on its payroll. Even Kering, which owns Gucci, Bottega Veneta, Saint Laurent and Balenciaga and is worth more than $70bn, is trailing in its wake. With six brands under its belt, Tapestry has a long way to go.

There is a lot riding on Coach, Tapestry’s blueprint model for how to make a brand balloon overnight. It is run by the well liked, charismatic British designer Stuart Vevers, who this September will celebrate 10 years at the brand.

Just a few years ago, Coach was considered a bit beige and horsey. But with some clever campaigns and casting – Selena Gomez as a face, and Lil Nas X as a catwalk opener – as well as a sharpened focus on upcycling (its waste leather handbags were rolled out just as the industry was under peak scrutiny for wasteful practices), it has been adopted by gen Z, who will represent 40% of the luxury goods market by 2035 (according to a report by the consultancy Bain). In June, Versace followed suit, enrolling pop star Dua Lipa to work on a butterfly and Barbie-pink collection which was geared towards the younger buyer.

It’ll take more than those two, of course. Kors himself is beloved in the industry but is also known for saying things like “What does it mean to look rich?” backstage. For context, you only have to look at New York fashion week, which plays host to these brands. For the past few years, it has been quiet, relying on the occasional big name to appear in the marquee slot to bring in the starry front row and the press. Sometimes, it’s Marc Jacobs. Last year, it was Tom Ford. In February, it was Luar, a young designer known for his cult handbags and cult following – but a far cry from the nostalgic banner names of yore. This purchase is as much about money as it about putting American fashion back on the map.

As fashion conglomerates go, Tapestry is about as American as it gets, the apple pie to Kering’s pizza and LVMH’s croissant. But it’ll take more than a big purchase to change the tastes of the growing rich."
World's richest man lobbied Macron to ditch prime minister - POLITICO Europe,"Fri, 25 Aug 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5wb2xpdGljby5ldS9hcnRpY2xlL2VtbWFudWVsLW1hY3Jvbi1iZXJuYXJkLWFybmF1bHQtZWxpc2FiZXRoLWJvcm5lLWdlcmFsZC1kYXJtYW5pbi1tZWV0LXRoZS13b3JsZHMtcmljaGVzdC1tYW4tZmF2b3JpdGUtcG9saXRpY2lhbi_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Cet article est disponible en français.



PARIS ― Bernard Arnault, one of the world’s most powerful CEOs, personally lobbied Emmanuel Macron to replace Prime Minister Elisabeth Borne with a more economically liberal figure.

In a previously unreported meeting with the French president at the Elysée Palace in early July, Arnault argued for one of the government’s other ministers to replace Borne, who is considered center-left. His first choice was Interior Minister Gérald Darmanin, who campaigned heavily for the job at the time, two senior figures with knowledge of the conversation told POLITICO.

Rumors were running wild earlier this summer that Borne, who has had a hard time rallying right-leaning MPs behind the government’s agenda, would go in a much-anticipated reshuffle ― she ended up staying with changes made at junior ministerial level. While Darmanin did not succeed in becoming prime minister this time, it’s no secret that he’s still eyeing the position.

Arnault — who alternates with Elon Musk for the title of world’s richest man and who runs luxury goods company LVMH — has been an open supporter of Macron and his family is close to first lady Brigitte Macron. However, it is rare for him to comment on day-to-day politics.

Darmanin, a rising star who rose up the ranks of the conservative party Les Républicains during the Nicolas Sarkozy era, is one of Borne’s main rivals inside the government. He was on the frontline throughout the summer as the government dealt with riots following the death of 17-year-old Nahel M., who was killed by a police officer. All eyes will be on Darmanin this Sunday when he addresses supporters in his constituency in Tourcoing, northern France.

LVMH didn’t respond to a request for comment. The Elysée declined to comment on the meeting or confirm it had taken place.

Fashion Briefing: What are the brand advantages of owning stores and factories? - Glossy,"Fri, 04 Aug 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmdsb3NzeS5jby9mYXNoaW9uL2Zhc2hpb24tYnJpZWZpbmctd2hhdC1hcmUtdGhlLWJyYW5kLWFkdmFudGFnZXMtb2Ytb3duaW5nLXN0b3Jlcy1hbmQtZmFjdG9yaWVzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"This week, we explore the recent supply chain and store acquisitions, and what they mean for brands aiming to future-proof their businesses. Scroll down to use Glossy+ Comments, giving the Glossy+ community the opportunity to join discussions around industry topics.

Luxury and mass brands are increasingly announcing store and factory acquisitions, moving on from leases and reliance on third parties. Although costs are steep for the initial purchase, the long-term benefits allow brands to both use property as part of their investment portfolio and future-proofing components of their business like artisan production.

Most brands still lease their retail locations

Purchasing store real estate is typically limited to giant conglomerates, like LVMH and Kering, that own multiple brands. So far this year, LVMH has purchased retail locations in Champs Elysées in Paris and East Hampton, with the latter requiring a $22 million investment. Meanwhile, LVMH rival Kering has scooped up four store spaces, all in Paris.

On its July 25 earnings call for the second quarter, LVMH chief financial officer Jean-Jacques Guiony said that the company does not have a global strategy of owning its stores, but it is making exceptions for special locations. “Renting is fine,” he said. “In pure financial terms, owning and renting are exactly the same thing, as the value of a property is the discounted value of its rent.”

He said there are some instances where purchasing makes more sense for the long term, particularly as rental fees increase. “There are … some traditional locations where, by experience, we see that the rental fees are growing faster than actually their implied value, in assessing the global property value,” said Guiony. “Then, it makes sense to own it, because there is an opportunity in the market to buy it at a certain price. … In the years to come, if we rent, chances are that the rental cost will go even higher. We are better off owning the property rather than renting it.”

“Purchasing a store is the same as buying a house, so you’re trying to find the best possible location and building structure to keep for 30 years,” said Wayne Kulin, executive chairman at StreetTrend, the parent company of footwear brand P448. To date, StreetTrend has rented its retail locations, while also experimenting with store formats like pop-ups.

“With a purchase, you’re able to control all aspects,” said Kulin. “But renting a store gives you the flexibility to be in a particular location with a known timeline, as well as flexibility on speed; you aren’t tying up long-term capital in real estate.”

“This is about control. Luxury brands want to be less reliant on third parties to drive their sales,” said Neil Saunders, retail analyst at data analytics company GlobalData. “Most luxury players have good enough margins to absorb the costs [of owning stores], despite the expense. They can get gains from greater efficiency by controlling store function and use, lower costs in leveraging a substantial retail network and higher margins by selling direct to consumers.”

“Larger brands will look at [available storefronts] as opportunities to diversify their investment portfolio, as well as to create more vertical supply chain control,” said Nicole Marra, founder and CEO of consulting firm Fixer Advisory Group. “But [successfully] driving those initiatives takes additional bandwidth, expertise and energy within the group that is outside of the core mission of their business.”

For NYC-based contemporary luxury fashion brand Lafayette 148, the answer is still to rent. The brand has seen growth in the past year through its retail network, opening new boutiques in Beverly Hills and Chicago in the past two months.

“Leasing allows us the flexibility to ensure we are always in the right locations and adjacencies to best serve the customer,” said Deirdre Quinn, co-founder and CEO of the brand. “With less investment on the front end, we’re allowed to keep focus on elevating the brand experience.”

However, there are drawbacks. “Although our locations are in such prestigious markets, we do not have the luxury of benefiting from the rise in property values over time,” said Quinn. “Today, the climate is more difficult for both tenants and landlords. While business is strong, rents are increasing.”

Vertical supply chain integration future-proofs artisan skills

At the same time, M&A around luxury fashion production has been active for a while, especially in Italy. Vertical integration means that brands own their own factories, benefitting their business through better economies of scale and decreased logistics costs, while providing security to workers in those areas.

In June, the Prada Group and Ermenegildo Zegna Group announced that, together, they had acquired a 15% stake in the Italian knitwear manufacturer Luigi Fedeli e Figlio. In 2021, the two companies also jointly acquired a majority stake in wool and cashmere supplier Filati Biagioli Modesto. And Burberry invested in an Italian outerwear manufacturer in March.

Meanwhile, LVMH acquired a majority stake in tannery Heng Long Italy and a minority stake in leather and suede manufacturer Robans, both in September 2022. In August 2021, Chanel acquired a majority stake in Italian knitwear company Paima. And Golden Goose acquired its largest supplier, Italian Fashion Team, in October 2022. Fendi took a majority stake in Italian knitwear company Maglificio Matisse in the same month.

But Italy isn’t the only country attracting these investments. In 2019, LVMH opened its third factory in the U.S., in Texas, following its opening of two other factories in California. And in April, Hermès purchased three factories in France. Some heritage brands like Birkenstock and Lafayette 148 also own their own factories, and even DTC brands are considering vertical integration.

Lafayette 148 owns its own factory in China, where it produces all of its garments. Among the advantages that provides the brand are quality control and easy coordination between its design and development teams. “We’re able to strategically react to the evolution of the market with replenishments while providing custom special orders for the VIP customer,” said Quinn.

Although the initial investment in the factory in China was high, it was part of a long-term plan for the business. “We will continue to invest in our production and, most importantly, our people, as we have done since founding the brand 27 years ago,” said Quinn. “It is a huge responsibility to keep a factory both busy and efficient. A company would find itself at a huge disadvantage without experienced manufacturing partners.”

StreetTrend’s P448 footwear relies on local production in Italy, it doesn’t own its own factories. Kulin described the missed opportunity. “Vertical integration allows you to have complete transparency into how your products are priced, as well as control of delivery dates, consistency and quality,” he said.

On the flip side, since every person working in the factory is paid, if a brand is unable to maintain an established pace of production, its fixed costs don’t change,” said Kulin. “The margins are extremely low and finding quality artisans is extremely difficult, as the next generation is not interested in working in factories as a career.”

Brand investment in quality-focused supply chains is necessary to keep local artisan skills alive, which many contemporary and luxury brands rely on. “These brands need these artisans for their production, and their business supports the economy and small communities in and outside of Europe,” said Marra. “Partnering with brands or with the big [conglomerates] on a [supplier investment] is an incredible way to make sure that the heritage is sustained over the generations.”

Ultimately, because of the long-term growth goals of their businesses, luxury houses have the most incentive to establish vertical integration and own their stores. However, as more brands see value in taking control of their production and customer data, investments in stores and production will likely catch on.

Revenue in the Americas gained 21 per cent in the second quarter at constant exchange rates, almost double what analysts expected. The stock rose as much as 4.3 per cent in Paris.

Hermès is outperforming rivals LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE and Cartier owner Richemont , which have reported weaker demand in the US after strong spending on luxury goods in the past two years.

Demand has stayed strong in all regions in July, executive chairman Axel Dumas told reporters in a call Friday, adding he’s confident for the rest of the year.

“In difficult moments, there’s what we call in finance the flight to quality, so we’ve benefited from it,” Dumas said, adding, “I don’t want to jinx it.”

Recurring operating profit advanced 28 per cent to €2.95 billion (US$3.24 billion) in the first half, and the margin reached a record 44 per cent.

Analysts consider Hermès to be in a category of its own as far as pricing power is concerned as demand for its handbags consistently surpasses its capacity to produce them. That means many bags enjoy higher resale values

“Hermès blows the whole luxury goods industry out of the water,” wrote Luca Solca, an analyst at Bernstein.

LVMH’s US revenue fell one per cent in the second quarter on an organic basis. The Americas growth at Hermès was helped by all divisions and mostly by higher volumes, Dumas said. Sales from the region that includes China also grew by a more than a third.

Dumas said historically profitability is stronger in the first half.

Hermès shares have outperformed its luxury rivals, jumping by around a third this year. The company saw its market capitalisation cross the symbolic €200 billion threshold earlier this year.

Jane Birkin, the actress who was the muse for the bag model named after her, died earlier this month.

“She was a dear friend of the maison,” Dumas said earlier, describing her as an “open-minded” artist who happened to be close to his uncle Jean-Louis Dumas who once ran the company. After famously bumping into her once on a flight in the 1980s, Jean-Louis took on her design idea for a bag model , which went on to become one of the label’s most sought-after products.

The maker of Kelly bags, named after actress Grace Kelly , aims to open one new leather manufacturing facility per year in France in order to maintain a growth rate of about seven per cent for its leather goods.

The company said it has no plans to further boost product prices this year after January’s hike."

Where does the name Setchu come from?

Satoshi Kuwata, the Japanese founder of Milan-based label Setchu and winner of the 2023 LVMH Prize for young fashion designers, tells Vincenzo La Torre about his distinctive East-West aesthetic.

“Take this garment [points to an item on the rack], which looks like an origami kimono but is actually a tailored jacket.”

A look from Setchu’s spring/summer 2024 collection.

Why did you choose Milan as your base?

“At Setchu, almost everything is made in Italy. It was my dream to be based in Italy. I’ve lived in all the fashion capitals, like Paris, London and New York , but my favourite is Milan because Italy is the factory of our industry.

“My shirts are made in Naples, all handmade. I’m really happy with the results and all the fabrics are from Italy.”

Tell us about your background.

“I was born in Kyoto and grew up in a small city between Osaka and Kyoto. It’s where they make whisky so you can imagine how much nature was there. I used to swim in the river and see a lot of fish.”

How did you get into fashion?

“I started picking my clothes when I was six years old but I remember that, when I was 12 or 13, one night I stayed at a friend’s house and all we talked about was fashion.

A look from Setchu’s spring/summer 2024 collection.

“I went to fashion school in London, Central Saint Martins, but after high school I was working at Beams, a fashion boutique in Osaka, and that’s where I learned everything. By the time I got to London I had already learned a lot.

“I started working at Savile Row because I loved cutting but I still had to go to Saint Martins to move from tailoring to fashion […] My first job was at Huntsman & Sons [in Savile Row], followed by Gareth Pugh in London and then I went to work for Kanye West, and Riccardo Tisci at Givenchy and later to Edun, the sustainable brand.

“I then moved to Milan and was the creative director of a commercial brand. I saved some money and started Setchu.”

Your background is quite global, which is also reflected in your work.

“That’s why I named my brand Setchu. My life has become like Setchu, a mix of Western and Japanese culture. My name is Satoshi but who cares about my name? I’m so far away from Japan now so I look at it the way you probably look at it.”

What do you plan to do with the €400,000 (US$439,000) LVMH prize money?

“First, I need to share my business ideas with the mentors and get advice on when and how I should use the prize. I need to be really clever about the timing.

Tapestry, the parent company of Coach and other brands, is set to acquire Capri Holdings, the owner of Michael Kors, in a significant $8.5 billion deal.

This move aims to create a prominent US fashion conglomerate that can better compete with larger European counterparts in the global luxury market.

According to a Bloomberg report, under the terms of the deal, Tapestry will pay $57 per share in cash to Capri shareholders, totaling around $6.69 billion. This offer represents a premium of nearly 65% over Capri's pre-deal share price of $54.90.

“We are confident this combination will deliver immediate value to our shareholders,” Capri chief executive officer John Idol said in the statement, as stated by the Bloomberg report. “By joining with Tapestry, we will have greater resources and capabilities to accelerate the expansion of our global reach while preserving the unique DNA of our brands.”

The merger combines Tapestry's brands, Kate Spade, Stuart Weitzman, with Capri's portfolio, Jimmy Choo, Versace, to bolster the position of US luxury companies, historically trailing behind European counterparts like LVMH. This acquisition addresses potential post-pandemic declines in U.S. luxury demand due to inflation, prompting a focus on international markets for growth and stability.

Both Tapestry and Capri have expanded through acquisitions in the past. Six years ago, in 2017, Tapestry (then known as Coach Inc) acquired Kate Spade for $2.4 billion. Capri (formerly Michael Kors), on the other hand, purchased Jimmy Choo for $1.2 billion. In the subsequent year, Capri acquired Versace for $2.2 billion.

The Capri-Tapestry deal may mark a revival of deal-making in the US luxury industry, in contrast to European luxury giants that have been making acquisitions. For instance, French luxury group Kering recently acquired a 30% stake in Italian fashion label Valentino. What's more, LVMH successfully concluded its substantial $15.8 billion acquisition of Tiffany in early 2021.

How To Build A Brand With Pauline Brown - HerMoney,"Mon, 28 Aug 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vaGVybW9uZXkuY29tL2Vuam95L2Zhc2hpb24vaG93LXRvLWJ1aWxkLWEtYnJhbmQtd2l0aC1wYXVsaW5lLWJyb3duL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Former LVMH Chairman Pauline Brown on taking risks with fashion, making a statement, and what it takes to build a brand.

When you think about your favorite clothing and accessory brands, what is it that makes you truly LOVE them? Is it the name? The way you feel in the clothing? What about how fashionable you look? Pauline Brown knows all about the fashion industry and why we feel so loyal to the brands — and the styles — that make us feel our best, inside and out. She also knows how to build a brand that consumers will love.

That’s because Brown has helped to build some of the world’s most influential luxury brands. She is the former Chairman of North America for LVMH, where she led 70 brands in five sectors including fashion, leather goods, watches, and jewelry. She’s also the founder of the e-learning platform, called Aesthetic Intelligence Labs, which teaches executives and entrepreneurs how to build brands that stand out. (Her platform is an extension of a popular course she introduced at Harvard Business School in 2017, and currently teaches at Columbia Business School.) Her book “Aesthetic Intelligence: How to Boost It and Use It in Business and Beyond,” dives into what it takes to create the look and feel of a brand people will adore.

Interestingly, Brown says that great aesthetics aren’t actually about how we look, but rather how a particular item or experience makes us feel. People who are interested in learning how to build a brand should consider the emotions we feel when we are truly moved — what feelings come up when we see a piece of art at a museum? “Is it emotionally uplifting? Is it memorable? Is it compelling? Is it something that draws us in?” she says. Strong brands all inspire these feelings.

Brown also offers guidance on building a personal brand, and how we can all become more fashionable — no matter how clueless we may feel when it comes to closet coordination. “I always say to my students, there’s no right or wrong. All there is, is true,” she says. Even after decades in the fashion industry, she admits that she still makes mistakes. Her best advice? Express ourselves fully, get messy, and learn what works for us and what doesn’t — only then can we build a brand we love.

The cultivation of beets is a key element in the perfumery supply chain since it produces the alcohol that serves as a support for most luxury fragrances.

Agroecological transition of 380 hectares

This year, Parfums Christian Dior, Givenchy Parfums and Kenzo Parfumsare financing a project aimed at supporting the agroecological transition of 380 hectares of beetroot cultivation in the east of France to produce the equivalent of 45% of their alcohol needs (“Mass balance” approach).

The project is based on the Regeneration Index, a tool developed by French NGO Pour une Agriculture du Vivant. It allows to assess the agro-ecological score of farms and to support farmers on their path to progress.

“This collaboration sets an important milestone on the path traced by the LIFE 360 program towards the regeneration of 5 million hectares of ecosystems. Beetroots hold a prominent place in the supply chain of the LVMH Beauty business group. The implementation of new, virtuous production models in this sector represents a key step on the way to our commitments,” highlights Hélène Valade, Environmental Development Director of the LVMH group.

A five-year R&D program

In addition, and for a period of five years, LVMH finances a Research & Development program with Cristal Union within 12 farms with the objective to test new agronomical practices with a particular focus on:

– Reducing nitrogen inputs in beetroot cultivation by optimizing cover crops.

– Limiting the addition of fertilizers of mineral origin through an increased use of organic matter.

As part of these trials, the three Maisons will work with Genesis, selected by the Maison des Start-ups LVMH and awarded for its tool measuring the health and quality of soils.

Is it down to creative director Jonathan Anderson's input? Euronews Culture investigates.

LOEWE was founded in 1846, making it LVMH's oldest luxury fashion house, but you’d be forgiven for thinking the superstar brand was new to the scene.

Established in Madrid by a group of Spanish leather craftsmen and Enrique Loewe, a merchant of Hessian origin, they were a favourite of royals and public figures alike.

In 1905, then King Alfonso XIII granted the fashion house a Royal Warrant of Appointment, making Loewe Purveyor of the Royal Household of Spain.

The brand grew in popularity decades later with celebrity fans including Ava Gardner, Ernest Hemingway, Sophia Loren, Rita Hayworth and Marlene Dietrich.

More recently, Loewe has been under the radar, ignored in favour of ever-popular luxury houses like Chanel, Gucci and Celine, to name but a few.

That’s all changed this year, though, with experts naming it the hottest brand of the year.

Loewe's rise to success

Research undertaken by LDMV Marketing has found that Loewe currently has over 800 million views on TikTok, with the hashtag #loewebag being one of the most popular on the platform with more than 8 million views.

That’s an impressive feat for any brand and is backed up with countless fans from all quarters of the fashion industry.

Last month, fashion technology company Lyst named Loewe officially as the hottest brand in the world. In its ranking of the most influential players in the fashion game, the brand went from the number 5 spot in Lyst's Q1 report, released in April, up to the top spot in Q2.

On Lyst’s hottest products of Q2 list, two of Loewe’s fan favourite pieces - its logo tank top and raffia tote bag - ranked at first and fourth, respectively.

Following in the footsteps of fashion power players including Chanel, Prada and Louis Vuitton, the Spanish brand opened a new store in exclusive East Hampton, New York, last week, cementing itself firmly in the hearts of the elite.

The shop follows Loewe’s creative director Jonathan Anderson’s Casa Loewe store concept, offering an experience where art, craft and fashion intertwine.

Jonathan Anderson's influence on the brand

Loewe’s ability to tap into a wide aspect of the market has been part of the brand’s success, according to fashion expert and founder of LDMV Marketing, Jo Threlfall.

“Alongside the brands clothing, accessory and bag range, Loewe also offers a home range and perfume selections, with the option to obtain sample sizes, giving consumers the opportunity to try the products before committing to a full-size purchase”, she tells Euronews Culture.

Jonathan Anderson, perhaps best known for his eponymous brand JW Anderson and their viral frog clogs, has been at the helm of Loewe since 2013.

The Northern Irish designer seems to have his finger on the pulse of what’s desirable at all times.

As well as maintaining the royal relationship - Spanish queens Sofía and Letizia often carry Loewe bags - celebrity collaborations have helped make the brand what it is today.

The label has recently signed K-pop sensation Taeyong and South Korean girl group Nmixx as brand ambassadors, a move no doubt intended to win over fans of the hugely popular music genre.

Anderson has picked other representatives to promote Loewe from all corners of the celebrity world. As well as designing Beyoncé’s spangled bodysuits for her Renaissance tour and dressing Rihanna for her Super Bowl halftime show, he’s casted the likes of Sir Anthony Hopkins and The White Lotus star Murray Bartlett in recent adverts.

Cast members of the smash hit drama Succession have also been seen in the front rows of Loewe shows and, in its recently-unveiled menswear campaign, actor Jamie Dornan and singer-songwriter Omar Apollo wear the latest collection while reading ‘Metamorphosis’ by Franz Kafka and James Frey’s ‘My Friend Leonard’.

Like many of Jonathan Anderson’s choices, the relevance of the novels isn’t obvious but his tenureship at Loewe has constantly raised eyebrows and got people talking.

Euronews Culture spoke to J'Nae Phillips, Insights Editor at consumer agency Canvas8, to learn more about Anderson’s fail proof approach.

“Loewe's ‘pixelated clothing’, cartoon-style high heels and anthurium breastplates are visually impactful and social media friendly”, Philips explains, adding, “this helps elevate brand awareness and permeate the greater collective fashion consciousness. Loewe garments function as real-life meme-worthy content that's captivating audiences online and offline”.

While Loewe is well known for its street style favourite puffed up sunglasses and balloon and broken egg-themed shoe designs, Anderson hasn’t just tapped into the avant garde side of the market.

“At a time when logos are becoming less desirable, Loewe is certainly bucking that trend,” stylist Bella Hignett tells Euronews Culture, adding, “Its accessories are heavily branded and people are clambering to be seen in the brand and to be associated with its luxury cool image”.

If you’ve been on social media over the last few months, you can’t have missed countless celebrities and influencers sporting the brand’s tank tops. Coming in neutral colours, it’ll set you back upwards of €342 but is seen as the perfect 'stealth wealth' piece.

With his basic pieces sitting comfortably next to unconventional yet practical bags like the Puzzle as well as even more unusual designs, Anderson has taken Loewe from ‘just another brand’ to the most lusted after on the planet.

“Anderson isn't afraid to take risks. He’s quoted as saying that you can’t underestimate the customer”, Hignett adds. “I think his quirkiness has made Loewe a huge success and so desirable”."

Among the richest men in the world, Bernard Arnault took the throne from Elon Musk earlier this year – before the Tesla and SpaceX CEO snatched back the title a few days ago, per Forbes. When it comes to ladies, Françoise Bettencourt Meyers has topped the charts for years.





But Arnault and Bettencourt Meyers have one thing in common: they’re both bosses of a beauty empire – LVMH and L’Oréal, respectively. The beauty sector, defined as skincare, fragrance, make-up and hair care, generated around US$430 billion in revenue last year, according to McKinsey & Company. The company also predicted that the sector will continue to grow rapidly by six per cent per year.

The beauty business not only generates hundreds of billions in profit each year, but also turns out some of the biggest billionaires in the world. So just who are these beauty billionaires?



10. Suh Kyung-bae (Amorepacific) – US$1.6 billion

As the chairman of Amorepacific, the largest cosmetic and skincare company in South Korea, Suh Kyung-bae, 60, became not only a billionaire but the second richest man in the country in 2015. Since then, he has always been among the top 10 wealthiest people in South Korea.



When he succeeded his father’s cosmetic business as its CEO in 1997, Suh rehauled Amorepacific with dozens of brands like Amore Pacific, Innisfree, Etude and Laneige. Today Amorepacific is worth US$4.7 billion and its boss has a fortune of US$1.6 billion, Forbes estimated.



9. Kim Kardashian (KKW Beauty) – US$1.7 billion

Reality TV star Kim Kardashian, 42, is also a super successful entrepreneur. She dominates the beauty scene and the fashion world alike with her KKW Beauty and Skims shapewear lines.



Kardashian launched KKW Beauty in 2017, which brought her over US$100 million in gross revenue, according to Celebrity Net Worth. In 2020, she sold a 20 per cent stake of the line for US$200 million, estimating its whole value at US$1 billion. But she closed it in 2021 and launched SKKN By Kim, a nine-step high-end skincare collection last year, per Forbes. She currently sits on US$1.7 billion, according to the same source.



8. Rihanna (Fenty Beauty) – US$1.7 billion

Superstar Rihanna, 35, became a billionaire in 2021, thanks to her Fenty Beauty empire in which she has a 50 per cent take, according to Forbes. That also makes her the richest female singer in the world with a net worth of US$1.7 billion, per Celebrity Net Worth.



Launched in 2017 in a partnership with luxury brand LVMH, Fenty Beauty aimed to appeal to women of all skin tones. It made US$100 million in its first two months, according to Celebrity Net Worth. Today, it is worth US$1.4 billion. Rihanna also owns 30 per cent of the Savage x Fenty lingerie brand, which is worth US$1 billion.



7. Hou Juncheng (Proya) – US$2.2 billion

Hou Juncheng, 60, founded Proya in 2006 and turned the company into one of the top cosmetics groups in China. Proya focuses on skincare, make-up and beauty products for women aged 18 to 24 in small and medium cities. The company is known for its local and international signature brands such as Timage, Zwyer Caviar and Artemis.

In 2020, he entered Forbes’ list of Chinese billionaires with a fortune valued at US$1.2 billion. Just over two years later, he has almost doubled it to US$2.2 billion.



6. Antonio Luiz Seabra (Natura) – US$3 billion

Antonio Luiz Seabra, 81, founded Natura in 1969. He made it the largest beauty brand in Brazil – and made himself a billionaire.

Natura, the current owner of The Body Shop, was first inspired by Avon’s door-to-door sales model, expanding from Brazil to other Latin American countries and then France. Later it bought Avon, making an annual combined gross revenue of over US$10 billion, according to Premier Beauty News.

Seabra also owns Bresco, a property rental firm focused on warehouses, offices and hotels. His businesses bring US$3 billion into his money bag, Celebrity Net Worth reports.



5. Michael and Wolfgang Herz (Beiersdorf) – US$13 billion

Brothers Michael and Wolfgang Herz, 79 and 73, owe nearly half of Beiersdorf, the company behind popular brands like Nivea, Eucerin and Labello. They have a current net worth of US$6.5 billion each, according to Forbes.

Their cash doesn’t only flow in from beauty care products, but also in a large part from Tchibo Holding, one of Germany’s largest retail groups.



4. The Lauder family (Estée Lauder) – US$40 billion

Estée Lauder and her husband Joseph founded the company in 1946, which has grown to become one of the leading names is the cosmetics business today with familiar lines like Clinique, Mac, La Mer and more. Their offspring have grown the brand even more to a combined fortune of US$40 billion, making them one of the five richest families in the US, per Celebrity Net Worth.



Among them, Estée’s oldest son, 90-year-old Leonard, the chairman emeritus, joined the company in 1958 and became the richest member of the family. He is worth US$21 billion, a bit more than half of the family’s fortune, according to Celebrity Net Worth. His brother Ronald joined the company much later and shares a similar net worth as the next generation – Leonard’s son William and Ronald’s daughters, Aerin and Jane, who are key leaders of Estée Lauder. Each of them is worth US$2.5 billion to US$4.5 billion.



3. Alain and Gerard Wertheimer (Chanel) – US$90 billion

Brothers Alain and Gerard Wertheimer, 74 and 72, the co-owners of Chanel, are each worth US$45 billion, coming to US$90 billion together, according to Celebrity Net Worth.



As the grandsons and heirs of Pierre Wertheimer, who bought out his early partner Gabrielle (Coco) Chanel, the company’s namesake, most of the brothers’ wealth obviously come from the favourite lines of the brands, including Chanel Beauty and Chanel Perfume. Other money streams of theirs also include three vineyards in France and California’s Napa Valley, and racehorse breeding.



2. Françoise Bettencourt Meyers (L’Oréal) – US$90 billion

Queen of the beauty biz, Françoise Bettencourt Meyers herself, is the granddaughter of Eugène Schueller, the founder of L’Oréal. Her net worth of US$90 billion, per Celebrity Net Worth, has more than doubled since 2018, when she topped Forbes’ list of the richest newcomers on the billionaires list with US$42.2 billion.



The heiress to Liliane Bettencourt, who was the world’s richest woman before her death in 2017, the 70-year-old now serves as the chairwoman of L’Oréal’s holding company. Her wealth is derived from her and her family’s 33 per cent stake in the company.



1. Bernard Arnault (LVMH) – US$219 billion

Elon Musk’s formidable opponent who has beat him to the top of the list more than once in recent years, is none other than Bernard Arnault, the French big boss of giant luxury house LVMH, owner of over 70 fashion and beauty brands including top-tier ones like Louis Vuitton, Christian Dior, Fendi, Tiffany, Bulgari and Givenchy.



Co-founder of LVMH, Arnault is lord of the fashion and beauty world. LVMH’s profit soared from US$4 billion in 1989 to US$86 billion last year and its stock increased 35 per cent over the past year, according to Forbes. Arnault’s fortune is around US$219 billion, per the same source.

If nothing else, last week’s announcement that Tapestry (the owner of Coach, Stuart Weitzman, and Kate Spade) had spent $8.5 billion to acquire Capri (the parent company of Versace, Jimmy Choo and Michael Kors) brought some drama to an otherwise lackluster American fashion market—one where middling brands often struggle for attention against their more revered and exciting European counterparts. On the face of it, this looks like a pretty logical deal—and perhaps inevitable, given the rapid consolidation of the industry. These are the two companies keeping the middle of the market warm, so why shouldn’t they band together against Big Luxury and Fast Fashion alike, all while lowering operating expenses and increasing their margins? Tapestry will undoubtedly save the $200 million in efficiencies that the company predicts—human resources, real estate, technology, back office finance people, accounting fees, etcetera—resulting in “enhanced TSR,” or total shareholder return, for those of us allergic to acronyms.

More than anything, though, this is an amazing outcome for Capri C.E.O. John Idol, who has achieved some of the most impressive financial exits in fashion history. After a few formative years as group president of Ralph Lauren, Idol took over as C.E.O. of Donna Karan, which he helped sell to LVMH for $243 million in 2001. A year later, along with investors Lawrence Stroll and Silas Chou, who already owned Tommy Hilfiger, Idol bought Michael Kors from LVMH and the brand’s other owners for $100 million. At the time, it was posting about $20 million a year in sales. In 2011, Michael Kors went public on the New York Stock Exchange at $3.8 billion. Everyone involved got very rich."

With a global footprint encompassing over 40 boutiques, notably in Asia, and a complete range of nearly 800 items from skincare to fragrances to beauty accessories, Officine Universelle Buly is one of the most successful names in the French cosmetics world. With a real capacity for disruption: for example, it recently unveiled a collection of water-based fragrances called “Les Jardins Français”, featuring plant-based scents.

Inspired by the heritage of the Parisian company founded by perfumer Jean-Vincent Bully in 1803, the entrepreneurial tandem of Ramdane Touhami and Victoire de Taillac breathed new life into this ancient treasure to give birth to Officine Universelle Buly, a new immersive interpretation of the delights of the past.

“We were lucky enough to discover an engaging beauty catalog created by this 19th-century brand. The names of the products and the bottles appealed to us. So we opened our first boutique on rue Bonaparte, in Paris,” explains Victoire de Taillac. “This decision corresponded to our desire to have an exceptional beauty products store, something we felt Paris didn’t offer at the time. We blended the company’s iconic products, based on the original catalog, such as Eau Triple or Huile Antique, and a selection of 20-30 botanical oils and powdered clays, to revive the original beauty store system, with a selection of beauty accessories.”

A unique sales experience

Guided by an identity focused on the Golden Age and a bespoke experience enhanced by the art of calligraphy, Buly’s establishments and products have rapidly conquered global markets. With the opening of a dozen new boutiques in 2022, Officine Universelle Buly now has four outlets in Paris and nearly forty worldwide. This includes destinations in Japan (Tokyo, Sapporo and Osaka), as well as South Korea. In Europe, the brand is already firmly established in Paris, London and Munich, and has recently established a presence in Milan.

Are Blackpink’s Lisa & LVMH Heir Frédéric Arnault Dating? - HELLO!

Blackpink member Lisa is always making headlines, be it for her sartorial choices or for selling out stadiums. So, it doesn’t really come as a surprise that like all celebrities, her dating life is also subject to intense speculation online, especially when it involves another well-known figure in the industry.

The ‘Money’ hitmaker is rumoured to be in a relationship with Tag Heuer CEO Frédéric Arnault, and the couple have been spotted together by the paps since the past few months.

Who is Frédéric Arnault, Lisa’s rumoured boyfriend?

Frédéric Arnault is the third son of LVMH founder and the second richest man in the world, Bernard Arnault. He became the CEO of Tag Heuer in 2020 and is a force to be reckoned with in the luxury brands’ landscape.

How did the rumours of Lisa and Frédéric dating begin?

Frédéric has self-confessedly been a longtime ‘Blink’ (the official name for the Blackpink fandom for the uninitiated). He even attended the group’s concert last November and shared a photo with the members on his Instagram.

He was later spotted with Lisa at several events, including the Bulgari Meditarranea High Jewellery Event in Venice back in May. The two were then seen hanging out in Paris, where Lisa was performing during Blacpink’s ongoing world tour.

A photo from their dinner date went viral and it was enough for Internet sleuths to turn their investigative eyes towards the rumoured couple.

Lisa recently shared photos from a vacation on Greece’s Zakynthos Island, the same spot where Frédéric’s sister-in-law and brother were vacationing, according to her Instagram.

While this wasn’t conclusive proof of their relationship, it did allow FredLisa shippers to believe that the two might be on a double date in the picturesque vacation spot.

More recently, the singer was photographed with the CEO at a private airport in Los Angeles, lending further weight to the relationship rumours.

What have Lisa and Frédéric been saying about the rumours?

So far, there hasn’t been any confirmation or denial about the relationship from Lisa or Frédéric. When rumours of Jennie and BTS’ Taehyung relationship began doing the rounds, Blackpink’s parent agency YG Entertainment jumped in with a statement about it. In Lisa and Frédéric’s case, there hasn’t been any word from the agency yet.

What has been the fans’ reaction to the relationship rumours?

Fans of the group have been largely supportive of the singer’s relationship and regularly drowns out antis (that’s Stan Twitter-speak for fans who hate on a K-pop group member’s personal choices).

Given that this picture has been circulating for the past hours, the only thing the fans could do is support Lisa with whoever she wants to be with. Be happy lovers. ❤️#LISA#FREDERICARNAULT#LALISA#BLACKPINKhttps://t.co/xRiAbr52S4 — mochi lalisa 🩷 (@ellewoodsbiatch) August 15, 2023

Until the people involved confirm or deny the relationship themselves, it’s best to keep the speculations to a distant observation rather than an intensive investigation into their private lives."
Luxury brands like Prada and Burberry are stepping into the sports arena - Glossy,"Thu, 03 Aug 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmdsb3NzeS5jby9mYXNoaW9uL2x1eHVyeS9sdXh1cnktYnJhbmRzLWxpa2UtcHJhZGEtYW5kLWJ1cmJlcnJ5LWFyZS1zdGVwcGluZy1pbnRvLXRoZS1zcG9ydHMtYXJlbmEv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"This story was first reported on and published by Glossy sibling site Modern Retail.

Luxury brands are increasingly becoming bigger players in the world of sports sponsorship.

Prada announced its partnership with the Chinese women’s soccer team last month for this summer’s FIFA Women’s World Cup. Soccer-inspired lifestyle brand Able Made teamed up with luxury fashion house Burberry to introduce a soccer apparel collection using upcycled Burberry fabrics. Meanwhile, luxury conglomerate LVMH just recently announced that it was sponsoring next year’s Olympic Games in Paris.

For years, athletic brands like Nike and Adidas were some of the dominant retail brands in sports. Now, it appears that luxury brands want a slice of the profitable sports market. While luxury brands and traditional athletic brands can coexist in the same market, experts said that luxury brands also have an opportunity to eat up market share.

“It shows how important sports is to retail in the world today,” said Matt Powell, advisor at retail consultancy firm Spurwink River. “It gets a tremendous amount of media attention and personal attention on the part of the consumer. So I think there’s a recognition that there’s an opportunity to harness that interest and introduce those folks to their brands.”

Indeed, these games — particularly major sporting events — get a lot of viewership. For example, Euromonitor International predicts that 2 billion people would tune into the 2023 Women’s World Cup, which is double its 2019 numbers.

Powell said that by increasing their presence in sports, luxury brands also gain international attention, which can be beneficial if they’re targeting a specific market. For years, Prada has been attempting to grow its business in China by launching pop-up shops and tapping Chinese actresses to be its ambassador, where many luxury brands appear to thrive. When the Italian fashion brand announced its partnership with the Chinese soccer team, a post featuring the squad wearing tailored suits was viewed over 300 million times on microblogging site Weibo.

It’s no surprise that the 2024 Olympic games in Paris, where LVMH is a sponsor, will get worldwide viewership as well. The event will reportedly be the largest event ever organized in Paris and is expected to attract 9.7 million spectators. LVMH’s luxury jewelry and watch brand Chaumet will design the games’ medals and wines and spirits from Moët Hennessy will be part of the hospitality program. The company is also sponsoring specific athletes like French swimmer Léon Marchand. In contrast to LVMH’s newfound partnerships, Nike has partnered with the U.S. Olympic Committee since 2005.

While luxury brands are dipping their toes in sports, Powell doesn’t expect them to start releasing performance apparel. “I don’t see the luxury brands competing for the performance side of it,” he said. “I think that they are absolutely going to compete for the mindshare side of it. So and that’s probably more important to them.”

Although experts agree that luxury brands aren’t likely to release their own cleats or dri-fit shirts, there’s an opportunity for them to work with athletes outside the playing field. Able Made’s recent collection in partnership with Burberry offers hoodies, joggers and jackets — athleisure wear items that the likes of Nike and Adidas dominate in.

“Athleisure has moved upscale in the last few years,” said Matt Moorut, director analyst at Gartner. “There’s definitely that kind of experimentation that helps luxury brands to reposition themselves for that younger audience.”

Outside of the games, luxury brands also have the chance to work with athletes in sports adjacent events like the annual NBA draft. Drew Green, CEO of the suit brand Indochino, told Glossy that the company dressed nine athletes at the event. Brands like Gucci and Dolce & Gabbana also have a strong presence during the drafts.

However, entering the sports arena isn’t an easy task. Unlike traditional athletic brands, luxury brands might not have the experience or data to identify the athletes or teams with the most potential, experts said. By sponsoring teams or organizations as opposed to individuals, luxury brands also run the risk of aligning themselves with people that don’t match their values.

“With teams, it can be a bit more difficult because of the fact that there are just more people involved,” Moorut said. “You can’t always control how those ambassadors for you will behave, and that in itself carries risks.”

But the prospect of gaining new and younger customers through sports is too good for the brands to miss out on, experts said. “Just as we saw more and more luxury brands getting into the sneaker space some years ago, I think we’re gonna see the same thing here,” Spurwink River’s Powell said."

The rumor spread like wildfire among the celebrities invited to the extravagant Louis Vuitton fashion show on the Pont Neuf in Paris on June 20. And everyone believed it. After all, 16 years ago, the brand managed to pull off an advertising campaign starring Mikhail Gorbachev, his hand resting on a Vuitton bag in the back of a car, in front of the Berlin Wall. Can anyone resist the world's biggest luxury group?

A G20 summit couldn't have been better secured: swarms of black sedans with tinted windows lined up on the quays of the Seine (opened up to LVMH for VIP parking), bodyguards with earpieces, dozens of police officers brought in to protect the dazzling guest list of American stars, from Rihanna to Leonardo DiCaprio, who came to admire the debut show by musician-slash-designer Pharrell Williams. The city had zealously cordoned off the entire area, causing monster traffic jams. ""I'll have you know that Mr. Arnault creates a lot of jobs,"" a security guard was heard telling one exasperated local.

In a country like France, being the richest man in the world (or the second, when he alternates with Elon Musk) confers a special status. No one says it that way, but no one disputes it: LVMH CEO Bernard Arnault is held up on par with a head of state. Never before had France occupied the top spot in the rankings of which the American press is so fond. Also unprecedented is the fact that the company is valued at between €400 and €500 billion – more than the national budget. ""For the first time in France, where there is nothing above the state, a private individual is more powerful than the king,"" summed up economist and philosopher Jérôme Batout.

Arnault, indivisible from the group of which he and his family own 48%, is the only non-American to wield such firepower. As such he has become symbolic of an inversion of the balance of power between the political and the commercial, a shift which is underway worldwide. ""Large corporations are organizations whose power now exceeds the economic sphere alone,"" wrote essayist Olivier Basso in his book Politique de la Très Grande Entreprise (""The Big Corporation and its Politics,"" 2015). ""They participate in the creation of the world we live in. In fact, they have become political players.""

This is a power without borders, without democratic legitimacy, and by nature, in competition with states. ""Bernard Arnault has reached such a level of economic power that he has reversed the balance of power with politics,"" agreed Gilles Le Gendre, MP for Paris from Emmanual Macron's centrist Renaissance party. ""There is no other case like this in French history.""

Versace owner bought by Tapestry for £6.6bn in LVMH challenge - City A.M.,"Fri, 11 Aug 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNpdHlhbS5jb20vdmVyc2FjZS1vd25lci1jYXByaS1zbmFwcGVkLXVwLWJ5LWNvYWNocy10YXBlc3RyeS1pbi02LTZibi1tZWdhLWRlYWwtdG8tY2hhbGxlbmdlLWx2bWgv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Versace owner Capri snapped up by Coach’s Tapestry in £6.6bn mega-deal to challenge LVMH

Tapestry, the American fashion giant behind luxury brands such as Coach and Kate Spade, has agreed to buy Capri the owners of designer Versace in a $8.5bn (£6.6bn) deal.

The merger will form a larger fashion conglomerate which will rival the likes of LVMH, the multibillion pound business behind designers such as Louis Vuitton and Dior.

As part of the deal Capri Holdings shareholders will receive $57 (£44) per share in cash.

The company’s share price nose dived over 15 per cent on Thursday evening following the announcement, while Capir’s rocketed 55.83 per cent as Wall Street gave a mixed reaction to the news.

The Versace owner showed signs of struggling in the last quarter, with revenues down 9.6 per cent to $1.23bn (£97bn).

Tapestry has performed better in recent months, with the group acquiring over 1.2 million new customers in North America alone,half of which were Gen Z and Millennial consumers.

In the third quarter, its net sales totaled $1.51bn (£1.19bn) , up five per cent year on year.

“The combination of Coach, Kate Spade, and Stuart Weitzman together with Versace, Jimmy Choo, and Michael Kors creates a new powerful global luxury house, unlocking a unique opportunity to drive enhanced value for our consumers, employees, communities, and shareholders around the world,” Joanne Crevoiserat, chief executive officer of Tapestry, Inc."

Called Sephora Sounds, the LVMH-owned retailer’s latest project features more than 55 emerging artists, whose music will be used in its social media marketing across multiple platforms.

Sephora said the programme aims to provide an opportunity for underrepresented artists, with more than 70% of participating artists saying that they have never been given a paid brand opportunity before.

The artists include Aint Afraid, a twin sister duo who are said to use their music as a platform for advocacy for a variety of causes including health care, education, mental health and more.

Also featured is SuperKnova, aka Ellie Kim, a transgender Korean-American musician who creates ‘queer pop’ with themes of identity and being your authentic self.

Nigerian-American singer-songwriter Precious, meanwhile, began by posting acoustic covers of popular songs to YouTube and has gone on to collaborate with musicians including rapper Baby Tate and singer and Coming 2 America actor Rotimi.

There will be further opportunities for artists to join as Sephora said it plans to expand the programme over time.

Participating artists have already had their music featured in Sephora’s TikTok videos, including Fenty Beauty’s Super Bowl promotion and the launch of Glossier at the retailer.

Sephora is not the first big beauty name to venture into supporting up-and-coming musicians.

Paco Rabanne’s artist grant programme, A Million Ways To Make It, provided UK musicians with £5,000 in funding as well as mentorship from music experts.

Music stars have also shown their support to beauty start-ups, with the likes of Miley Cyrus and Dua Lipa investing in tanning brand Dolce Glow and hair care brand Dizziak respectively."
"Tapestry To Nearly Double Its Store Footprint With $8.5 Billion Michael Kors, Versace Acquisition - CoStar Group","Thu, 10 Aug 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jb3N0YXIuY29tL2FydGljbGUvMTczNDQ5NDE5My90YXBlc3RyeS10by1uZWFybHktZG91YmxlLWl0cy1zdG9yZS1mb290cHJpbnQtd2l0aC04NS1iaWxsaW9uLW1pY2hhZWwta29ycy12ZXJzYWNlLWFjcXVpc2l0aW9u0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Coach's parent Tapestry will nearly double its brick-and-mortar footprint, to roughly 2,700 stores, when it acquires Capri Holdings — the owner of Michael Kors and several other brands — in an $8.5 billion deal as it competes with Europe's luxury-goods juggernauts.

New York-based Tapestry, the owner of retailers Kate Spade and Stuart Weitzman in addition to Coach, on Thursday said it had entered into a definitive agreement to purchase Capri, home to Kors as well as Versace and Jimmy Choo. Capri stockholders will receive $57 a share in cash when the transaction closes, which is expected to happen next year.

In a joint statement, Tapestry and Capri, based in London, said the deal will combine six complementary brands, accelerate their expansion globally and across categories, and create synergies, particularly related to their supply chains, that will result in $200 million in savings over three years.

The acquisition will also be the latest in a series of mergers that have made some of the international powerhouses in the luxury sector, such as Louis Vuitton parent LVMH and Gucci owner Kering, get even larger and more formidable. The combined Tapestry-and-Capri business will move up a notch or so in market share in that arena.

""The acquisition of Capri by Tapestry is the logical next step on the journey to create a global luxury powerhouse,"" Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData, said in a note Thursday. ""Once completed the new entity will be the fourth-largest luxury company in the world, with a combined market share of around 5.1% of the luxury goods market. In the Americas, the company will be the second largest luxury player behind LVMH, with a combined share of 6% of the luxury goods market.""

The luxury category had remained relatively resilient during a rocky period for retail, but it has seen a bit of a recent slowdown. Affluent consumers are still spending on high-end goods because they are more buffered from rising inflation and higher prices for food and gas than other Americans. Luxury retailers have also become more important tenants to some landlords, and some malls have even created dedicated luxury wings where they group high-end stores. David Simon, CEO of mall giant Simon Property Group, said on a recent second-quarter earnings call that LVMH ranks in the top 10 tenants for his company.

Luxury retailers ""have loyal customers,"" Simon told Wall Street analysts. ""So there's no better companies to do business with ... and we aspire to be more like them than, than anything. And I think how they maintain their stores and how they treat their customers and how they're true to themselves. So the luxury business is here to stay. It's growing. It's really important. It's worldwide. It's a great consumer that loves physical retail, that wants to go shop and do other things at our centers.""

Tapestry and Capri combined will have $12 billion in annual revenue and a substantially bigger store fleet domestically and globally. As of Dec. 31, worldwide Coach had 953 stores, Kate Spade had 400 stores and Stuart Weitzman had 99 stores, for a total of 1,452 locations. As of July 2, Capri's Michael Kors had 810 stores, Jimmy Choo had 237 stores, and Versace had 224 stores, for a total of 1,271 locations. The merged companies will have 2,723 stores. Analysts said they expect Tapestry will open more stores after the merger but didn't know how quickly that would happen.

Capri now occupies about 1.18 million square feet of retail space across the United States with an average footprint of just under 3,350 square feet per store, Brandon Svec, national director of U.S. retail analytics for CoStar Group, said in an email. The vast majority of locations are under the Michael Kors brand, according to CoStar data. Tapestry now occupies 1.49 million square feet of retail space domestically with an average footprint of just over 2,800 square feet.

More Power, Influence

Retail analysts said they don't expect to see Tapestry closing any stores after the merger is completed.

""Given a similar target customer in the luxury space, there is significant overlap in locations between the two companies (and six brands),"" Svec said in an email. ""That said, I would not expect there will be much, if any consolidation of retail space, as each brand within the combined entity will likely keep its own unique attributes and feel. The real estate implication is much more likely to be felt on the office side (albeit, where the combined entity has significantly less space), where synergies are much more likely to be identified.""

With its bigger scale after the acquisition, Tapestry can follow in the footsteps of its bigger rivals such as LVMH, according to GlobalData's Saunders.

""American luxury fashion companies have long looked with envy at their European counterparts, which exert significant power and influence in the market through their house-of-brands approach,"" Saunders said in his note. ""As luxury labels tend to be directional and are targeted at particular demographics and tastes, the model works because it allows firms to grow large by having a patchwork of brands appealing to different segments, rather than by making individual brands ubiquitous. A house of brands approach is also efficient as core functions and talents can be applied to the different brands, reducing expense in areas like distribution and operations.""

The merger may also give Tapestry more leverage with landlords, according to some analysts and consultants.

""A combined entity will have a bit more negotiating power with landlords and malls, if only because it will control a lot more stores,"" Saunders said in an email to CoStar News. ""That said, because the brands it operates are all separate entities the group will not be consolidating or merging its stores. It may undertake a review of the store fleet once the acquisition has completed but given how important direct to consumer sales are for luxury brands, I doubt that there will be a rash of closures. Tapestry might even decide that some of the Capri brands need more stores to amplify their presence.""

Gaining Possible Leverage

Tapestry's acquisition of Capri will probably give it an edge on the real estate front, Anjee Solanki, national director of retail services for Colliers, told CoStar News.

""When you look at the top-performing malls across the U.S., and the high sales per square foot, LVMH can come in and talk to those five, six, seven landlords and get portfolio deals and take down the best location and cluster their brands together, and they're going to see that strong performance,"" Solanki said. ""And I think that's what Capri and Tapestry are looking at in terms of how do we combine forces so we can also benefit from having better-positioned real estate, to be in the top malls and not be out-positioned or displaced, let's just call it, because LVMH has come in and taken the better sites. I think it provides a strength there.""

Edward Coury, senior managing director at RCS Real Estate Advisors, told CoStar News that Tapestry may also get a better hand to play with landlords.

""If they position their portfolio properly, there's no doubt that they have twice the amount of impact and store count, and they should have definitely improved leverage,"" he said. ""In terms of growth and stores and all that, they bought the businesses to improve them ... to improving those brands. And some of them are in a good position and some of them are not. So they're going to have to enhance the brands and once you do that, then growth is the natural next step.""

He added that ""I would imagine they'll be a little cautious right now, because in the near term they've got to get their arms around what they just rally acquired, not just from a business standpoint and a merchandising standpoint it's from a real estate standpoint.""

Coury said Michael Kors and Coach have a very mature outlet-store business, ""but some of their other brands certainly have opportunities, not only in full price but outlet.""

Capri's Tough Quarter

Luxury retailers are plum tenants for malls because they have high average sales per square foot, which helps drive higher rents and valuations at those properties, according to Coury. Those high-end stores also bring foot traffic to retail centers, he said.

Tapestry successfully revived the Coach chain and revitalized Kate Spade. It will have to take the same kind of action with flagging Michael Kors, which lost its luster with oversaturation and discounting of its apparel at department stores and other retail outlets. Tapestry officials on Thursday emphasized they are interested in direct-to-consumer sales, from its own stores and e-commerce.

""I think the acquisition of Capri Holdings by Tapestry is good for shopping center owners and for the shopping center industry in general,"" Rudolph Milian, formerly with the ICSC retail trade group and now president and CEO of Woodcliff Realty Advisors, said in an email to CoStar News. ""Tapestry has a good track record for distributing and marketing its brands. Tapestry did a good job turning around Coach and Kate Spade and making their products available to the consumer via the internet and physical stores.""

Michael Kors ""is an excellent brand but it relies too much on wholesale business distribution through the declining department store sector,"" according to Milian.

He expects Tapestry ""will look to open more off-price Michael Kors stores in outlet centers and full-price stores in malls, fashion-oriented community centers and lifestyle centers, which will make the brand more prominent to consumers exactly where they shop,"" he said. ""The same would apply to Versace and Jimmy Choo. Jimmy Choo is a very upscale brand but needs more presence at upscale malls. I can foresee opportunities for expanding Jimmy Choo stores beyond its very limited presence.""

Capri reported its fiscal 2024 first-quarter earnings Thursday, saying that revenue dropped 9.6% to $1.23 billion. Michael Kors performed the worse of its three chains, with its revenue dropping 13.8%, to $787 million.

""As the ink dries on the acquisition agreement by Tapestry, champagne corks will no doubt be flying at Capri’s HQ,"" Saunders said in a separate note on the earnings. ""However, if anyone needs sobering up, they only need to look at the latest trading numbers from the luxury group. These do not make for happy reading and show a continued decline in overall revenue, by 9.6%, and a sharp deterioration on the bottom line where net income is down by 76.1%. ... Against this performance, the price paid for Capri by Tapestry seems extremely toppy.""

Tapestry and Capri didn't respond to emails seeking a response to his comments.

Saunders was especially critical of Michael Kors' performance and said Tapestry has its work cut out for it with that chain.

""The recent trajectory of Capri, and especially the core Michael Kors brand, also means that Tapestry is not buying a business that is firing on all cylinders; it is buying a business that, while still perfectly roadworthy, needs a lot of maintenance and fine tuning,"" Saunders said. ""Tapestry will likely be confident it has the skills needed to do the job, but the size and scale of the work required and the time it will take should not be underestimated.""

For the Record

The deal will bring new heft to New York-based Tapestry’s portfolio, adding Capri’s Michael Kors, Versace and Jimmy Choo labels to the US group’s existing Coach, Kate Spade and Stuart Weitzman brands.

For years America’s fashion groups have lagged European “big luxury” heavyweights like LVMH and Kering, which enjoy considerable scale advantages in everything from retail and marketing to the war for talent, and have continued to grow their portfolios. Last month, French group Kering said it was buying a 30 percent stake in Valentino. In 2021, LVMH acquired Tiffany in a $16 billion deal.

US fashion players have tried to bulk up. In 2017, Tapestry, then known as Coach Inc, bought Kate Spade for $2.4 billion. Later that year, Capri, then known as Michael Kors, bought Jimmy Choo for $1.2 billion. The following year later, Capri bought Versace for $2.2 billion.

But America’s fashion groups remain small compared to their European rivals. Tapestry has a market capitalisation of about $10 billion. Capri is worth about $4 billion. By comparison, Kering is valued at about $72 billion, while sector leader LVMH, which owns 75 brands, has a market cap of $456 billion.

Speculation about a relationship between the pair began when photos emerged of the alleged couple enjoying a laugh at the Bulgari Mediterranea High Jewelry event in Venice back in May, a moment that quickly sent fans on the hunt for more evidence of a blossoming romance.

This unearthed another photo of the pair sitting together at an airport lounge in Los Angeles as well as sightings in Paris and at multiple fashion events - while others began analyzing Lisa's Instagram, insisting that her posts revealed a slew of clues hinting at a romance between the 26-year-old pop princess and the billionaire luxury fashion heir.

Frederic, 28, is the son of the richest man in the world, Bernard Arnault. The patriarch is the chairman and CEO of LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, and he and his family are worth about $212 billion, according to Forbes.

Another photo also surfaced of the two at a private airport lounge in Los Angeles, California

Successful in her own right, the 26-year-old musician, born Lalisa Manobal but is known professionally as Lisa, rose to fame as a member of the K-pop supergroup Blackpink.

The Arnaults have recently returned from a long summer vacation in Greece and Italy.

And eagle-eyed social media users were quick to spot similarities in Lisa's posts with those on the accounts of the heir's brothers Alexandre Arnault and wife Geraldine Guyot as well as Jean Arnault and girlfriend Zita d'Hauteville.

Lisa began posting from her lavish getaway on August 9 as she posed up a storm in a pair of denim shorts and chic long-sleeved top.

She soaked up the sun in front of an imposing white cliff face before stripping down to a green bikini for a dip.

In a video she shared at the time, a distinctive stone archway led out into a blue lagoon - with Geraldine also posting snaps just four days earlier from the exact same spot after she and her husband visited by kayak.

Similarly, in another post just hours later, Lisa stunned in a turmeric dress as she relaxed in a wicker chair on a patio balcony.

And, once again, the same seating set up featured in Geraldine's Instagram Story as Zita gazed playfully at the camera.

Geraldine and Zita were also quick to like and comment on the singer's photos soon after they were posted.

Meanwhile Frederic, who is the CEO of luxury watch brand TAG Heuer, has been posting less on social media - but did share a snap showcasing one of the company's watches.

The pink-faced dial undoubtedly caught the eye, but the backdrop also sparked interest among fans as it appeared to mirror that of Lisa's European getaway.

It is not clear when the pair first met, but Lisa has previously worked alongside brands that are part of the LVMH group.

She was Celine's global ambassador for three years and collaborated with Bulgari on a limited-edition watch earlier this year.

Capri Holdings shares rose on news of the deal. Yahoo Finance Live takes a look at the deal and its impact on both companies.

Video Transcript

SEANA SMITH: Tapestry reaching a big deal here to buy Capri Holdings for $8.5 billion. We're seeing a massive reaction in Capri stock, up just about 55% right now, while the fashion giant saying that this is going to help expand their global reach. The transaction will see Tapestry, which is the owner of Coach, Stuart Weitzman, and Kate Spade gain control of Michael Kors, Versace, and Jimmy Choo.

And, Akiko, when we take a look at what's been happening within the retail space, specifically within the luxury space, we have seen this pattern of consolidation. We know they are up against some stiff competition. LVMH has long-- has been viewed, I think, fair to say in recent years as the winner, as the leader, I should say, within this space. How much is this materially going to change, though, Tapestry's business going forward? I think a lot of people are starting to question that just given the brands that they have under this umbrella and how much it still resonates or how little maybe it's resonating with consumers these days.

AKIKO FUJITA: Yeah, Seana, that's something we were talking about this morning, right? I mean, if you look at the portfolio of brands that are under Tapestry and Capri Holdings versus LVMH, it still, still pales in comparison to what LVMH has. Having said that, it is interesting timing in all of this. When you think about consumers increasingly pulling back on discretionary spending, what would the announcement today allows these two big retail names, American names, we should say, really, to pull resources together in a big way?

A number of things the companies have announced, that the two groups combined generate $12 billion in revenue. The merger will result in $200 million in savings. We're talking about in operations as well as supply chain costs over the course of 3 years. And then this really does increase the opportunity in terms of direct-to-consumer opportunities for these brands.

Story continues

So strategically, it makes sense. You know, if the question is, does this allow them to compete with the likes of LVMH in a big way, it feels like there's still a ways off.

SEANA SMITH: Yeah, it feels like they are very far ways off. And it also took the street by surprise-- a little bit by surprise. We're getting some analysts reaction today. BMO Capital Markets Simeon Siegel, he was out saying that this deal was a surprise. He does view it as a positive for Capri shareholders. Remember, this is a stock that was off just about 40% so far this year ahead of this deal.

But he was saying it's a little bit surprising given the similarity, the brand similarity-- Akiko, you just mentioned two US American brands here-- and also, the momentum, the current strategy, potential execution issues, which could arise and likely to arise with the combination of these two well-known names. So I think the future of it and also just given the timing like you were saying with consumers thinking twice before spending on discretionary products makes some people just second-guess, I guess, what exactly the catalyst will be for these two names in the short-term.

AKIKO FUJITA: Yeah, I mean, having said that, when you combine these two forces, it does mean something for the brand. If you look at Capri Holdings, for example, they get more exposure to the Asian markets.

SEANA SMITH: Yeah.

AKIKO FUJITA: You look at somebody like Tapestry, more exposure to EMEA. So we'll still have to see some of those brands, you know, their footprints expand and see how consumers respond. But yes, to your point, you know, luxury brands, just like a lot of brands, certainly going to get hit because consumers are becoming increasingly conservative with their wallets. That space is certainly going to take a hit as a result of that."
The Riviera Maya's Top Luxury Resort Is Back - Caribbean Journal,"Mon, 07 Aug 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNhcmliam91cm5hbC5jb20vMjAyMy8wOC8wNy9yaXZpZXJhLW1heWEtcmVzb3J0LXRvcC1sdXh1cnktYmVsbW9uZC1sdm1oL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The top luxury resort in the Riviera Maya has made its long-awaited return after a large-scale transformation project: Maroma, a Belmond Hotel.

LVMH’s only hotel in Mexico, and one of just four in the Caribbean, officially welcomed back its first guests this week (Belmond is part of the LVMH portfolio).

The hotel, which has a mix of 72 rooms, suites and villas, is set on a 200-acre site between tropical jungle and Caribbean coastline.

Long the top luxury resort in the Mexican Caribbean and the Riviera Maya in particular, the reborn property has added everything from a Guerlain-branded spa to a new eatery called Woodend by Michelin-starred Chef Curtis Stone.

The Ranas Fountain at the heart of the resort’s entrance.

That’s along with another new eatery by Mexican-born Executive Chef Daniel Camacho called Casa Mayor.

Design studio Tara Bernerd and Partners led the overhaul of the property, with a focus on sustainability that included using 80 percent of furnishings handcrafted in Mexico and even a broad range of pan-Mexican art.

“The reborn Maroma channels effortlessly chic, hacienda-style living,” Belmond says.

The transformation also included a complete redesign of all three of the resort’s pools, including the installation of Sukabumi tiles made by hand from volcanic stone.

Each of the 72 rooms are spread across the beach; the transformation saw the addition f 10 new one and two-bedroom beachfront suites, including some with their own private pools.

That’s along with the four-bedroom, 3,939-square-foot Villa Maroma, a full-fledged villa option for guests.

It’s a major addition to the western edge of the region, and a sign of LVMH’s renewed push to expand and transform its Caribbean portfolio.

The insatiable global demand for luxury goods and LVMH's stellar financial results have thrown the French conglomerate into an ever-brighter spotlight.

Its stock market gains have greatly increased the fortune of its controlling shareholder, Bernard Arnault, who is now the world's second-wealthiest person.

Arnault sits at the heart of this success story. In this Bloomberg Originals short documentary, Bernard Arnault: King of Luxury, we meet the man behind a conglomerate built by decades of acquisition. Arnault has brought some of the world's most desirable, high-end brands under the LVMH umbrella. Christian Dior, Dom Perignon, Tiffany & Co. and Cheval Blanc are just a few of the gems in his portfolio.

But industry observers are asking how long can LVMH continue to outperform, given doubts about luxury appetites in critical Chinese and American markets."
How did Bernard Arnault of LVMH become so rich? - Gulf News,"Tue, 08 Aug 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vZ3VsZm5ld3MuY29tL2J1c2luZXNzL21hcmtldHMvaG93LWRpZC1iZXJuYXJkLWFybmF1bHQtb2YtbHZtaC1iZWNvbWUtc28tcmljaC0xLjE2OTE0ODM5NzU2NzDSAWhodHRwczovL2d1bGZuZXdzLmNvbS9hbXAvYnVzaW5lc3MvbWFya2V0cy9ob3ctZGlkLWJlcm5hcmQtYXJuYXVsdC1vZi1sdm1oLWJlY29tZS1zby1yaWNoLTEuMTY5MTQ4Mzk3NTY3MA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"For a majority of this year so far, Elon Musk was not the world’s richest man. It was Bernard Jean Étienne Arnault.

The entrepreneur pushed Musk off his position in 2023, Forbes reported, until Musk caught up and re-established himself at the top of the list in June. Arnault’s rise to the top of the list is legendary.

The 74-year-old is known as ‘the pope of fashion’ and, infamously, as the ‘wolf-in-cashmere.’ His business tactics and strategy are legendary.

LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE, which Arnault heads up as Chief Executive Officer, is the primary source of wealth for the businessman and his family.

While it is highly unlikely that the company’s namesake brands won’t strike as familiar, if they don’t, the family-run enterprise has over 70 other brands that consumers would recognise. From Tiffany & Co., Givenchy and Tag Heuer, to Sephora, Make Up For Ever and Fendi, many names of the 75 under the LVMH umbrella are legacy brands.

Catering to the 1 per cent, most of its flagship products are expensive, unique and limited in quantity. In an interview with Harvard Business Review, Arnault explained how they choose products or designs to sell.

“Our whole business is based on giving our artists and designers complete freedom to invent without limits.”

And it has paid off, big time, for the brand and Arnault. But the story of LVMH came to be the world’s biggest luxury group is almost cinematic and thrilling as Arnault went about building the empire one brand at a time.

The beginning

The mogul did not start his business journey in luxury and fashion. It was the non-glamourous industry of construction, and then real estate, which gave Arnault the money to get into luxury and fashion.

Arnault joined his father’s business after graduating as an engineer in 1971 – a civil engineering firm called Ferret-Savinel. Always one for innovation, Arnault convinced his father to change the focus of the company to real estate. The company was renamed Ferinel in 1974. Arnault led Ferinel as CEO in 1977 and then took over as Chairman in 1978.

The next couple of years marked Arnault’s journey into fashion and luxury, with the acquisition of the legendary ‘House of Dior’ (referred to as ‘Dior’ hereon).

Why Dior?

The Arnault family, through Financière Agache, holds a direct Shareholder interest of 96 per cent in Christian Dior.

An unexpected conversation is, reportedly, why Arnault set his eyes on the renowned fashion house of Dior. According to media reports, the businessman asked a New York cabbie if he knew France’s President – Georges Pompidou at the time.

The cabbie didn’t know the French president, but famously said that he knew the House of Dior in France.

Christian Dior’s designs garnered international fame for his namesake house of fashion from its inception in the 1940s. French entrepreneur Marcel Boussac owned the couture house, among other businesses. While Dior was profitable, all of Boussac’s enterprises were facing bankruptcy by the late 1970s.

French entrepreneur Marcel Boussac owned Dior until the late 1970s

A Washington Post report published in 1978 details how a Parisian court allowed the Boussac enterprise, and ultimately Dior, to be purchased by the Willot brothers, The four sibling-owners of the Agache-Willot Group bought out Boussac for $175 million, completing the purchase in 1980.

However, in less than two years, the Boussac division in the Agache-Willot Group went bust, though Dior remained the only profitable asset. The division, which comprised a third of the company’s sales, needed $70 million in external assistance.

An NYT article published on July 7, 1981 (digitised version of article) reported, “The Agache-Willot Group, the big textile and retail organization that employs about 20,000 workers in France and includes both the Christian Dior fashion house and the ailing Korvettes chain in the United States, is in serious financial trouble.”

‘The Terminator’

Arnault, 35 at the time, had his eyes set on the jewel, Dior, and put together $15 million from his firm with $45 million from financiers Lazard Frères (now Lazard Ltd) to take over the running of the company – Financière Agache – from the Willot brothers.

Financière Agache was the springboard for Arnault’s fashion empire. Soon, he bid for and won Boussac Saint-Frères, and Dior, for “one symbolic franc” in 1984.

In his attempt to bring the books to black, Arnault laid off 9,000 workers, sold off most Boussac interests except Dior and Le Bon Marché department store. These decisions earned him the nickname ‘The Terminator.’

Arnault, who was until then just a real estate businessman moving in relative obscurity, started getting recognised in business circles for his transformative and aggressive business strategies.

To LVMH: A glamorous boardroom struggle

In 1988, Arnault was invited to invest in LVMH by the company’s chairman, Henri Racamier.

Racamier, who was married to Odile Vuitton (great-granddaughter of Louis Vuitton), brought the legendary brand into profitability after taking over in 1970. In 1987, Racamier merged Louis Vuitton with Moet-Hennessy to form LVMH to avert chances of a hostile takeover.

Henry Racamier, who married into the Vuitton family, is credited with making Louis Vuitton the profitable brand it became in the '80s and was one of the co-founders of LVMH. Arnault ousted Racamier from LVMH in 1990.

However, soon after the merger, Racamier got into a power struggle with Alain Chevalier, the LVMH chairman at the time. Arnault, after joining LVMH, also had issues with Racamier leading to a public and bitter hostility between the duo.

While Racamier was preparing for hostile external parties, Arnault used his business acumen to stage a coup.

This is how: A 1988 NYT report announced a deal between Guinness and LVMH. Guinness invested over $400 million in a joint venture with Financière Agache – this venture, the report added, would own a 24 per cent stake in LVMH. Agache had a 60 per cent stake in the new venture, giving Arnault huge control over the stake.

Tiffany & Co. is one of the 75 brands under the LVMH umbrella, which includes Sephora, Givenchy, Tag Heuer, Make Up For Ever, Fendi and so many more

Europe’s most valuable company

In 1990, armed with the stake the Guinness-Agache venture had in LVMH, Arnault ousted Racamier from the group.

Arnault became Chairman and CEO of the LVMH group. Starting then, Arnault went on an acquisition and expansion spree with LVMH, spending over $43.6 billion over the years.

Taking over competitors and upcoming brands in fashion, tech, media and spirits over the past three decades, LVMH now has 75 brands under its umbrella with the fashion wing bringing in more than 35 per cent of their revenue. Many of these are what Arnault would call ‘star brands’.

Our whole business is based on giving our artists and designers complete freedom to invent without limits. - Bernard Arnault in Harvard Business Review

According to Arnault, “a star brand is timeless, modern, fast growing, and highly profitable.”

Today, the Arnault family, through Financière Agache, holds a direct Shareholder interest of 96 per cent in Christian Dior. Christian Dior in turn holds just over 41 per cent stock interest in LVMH.

LVMH is the world's biggest luxury group. With a market capitalization of close to $500 billion, it has the resources to reinvest in its brands, led by Louis Vuitton and Dior, as well as operate the most extravagant stores and recruit the best designers and celebrities to steer its houses.

Who is next?

Given that Arnault is 74 and his vast business interest, the subject of who his successor will be is a major topic of speculation. He has five children from two marriages – one daughter and four sons – all of whom are in the family business. Forbes reported that in July 2022, Arnault proposed that all five children would get equal stakes in Agache.

However, the question remains – who will take over LVMH after Arnault?

Given his special love for Dior, some experts have said that his only daughter Delphine (48) is the front-runner to head up LVMH. He named Delphine as the chairman and CEO of Dior in February this year.

Son Antoine (46) is CEO of Berluti, chairman of Loro Piana and head of communications and image at LVMH, and is also a possible contender for the role of LVMH chief.

Second son Alexandre (31) is Executive Vice President of Product and Communications at Tiffany & Co. Frédéric (28) is CEO of TAG Heuer. Jean (25) is the youngest of the brood and is Director of Marketing and Development for Watches at Louis Vuitton."

Below, we reveal 10 things you need to know about the young CEO Frederic Arnault.

1. He hails from the illustrious Arnault family.

His collection of mentors includes Thierry Breton, a former CEO of France Telecom and the current European Union commissioner for the internal market, and Tony Fadell, a prominent figure in the tech world, known for his contributions to the iPod and iPhone. This diverse mentorship network demonstrates Frederic's desire to draw insights from different fields and apply them creatively to TAG Heuer's strategies, solidifying his status as a versatile and forward-thinking leader.

10. He doesn't appreciate being likened to the Roys in HBO's ""Succession.""

Despite the natural association between his family's legacy and the TV show Succession, Frédéric Arnault doesn't like this reference. The popular series, which revolves around a wealthy and powerful media family with similarities to his own, might seem intriguing from an outsider's perspective, but it's not a topic he prefers to discuss. He enjoyed The Queen's Gambit and The Roman Empire, though!

Arnault, 74, is the world’s second richest man with a personal fortune of around $218bn (£170.5bn) and presides over an empire that spans Louis Vuitton luggage, Tiffany diamonds and Moët champagne at LVMH.

Pinault, 86, controls Gucci, Balenciaga, Yves Saint Laurent, Alexander McQueen and through his own conglomerate, Kering.

The pair have spent a lifetime building kingdoms that have helped to cement Paris as the capital of the world of luxury. Both men are preparing to hand their legacy onto the next generation, with both LVMH and Kering likely to remain within family control.

Yet the pair suddenly face a surprise challenge: the first truly American luxury group.

On Thursday, New York-based Tapestry – the owner of Coach handbags and Kate Spade – announced an $8.5bn (£6.7bn) deal to buy Capri Holdings, the parent company of Jimmy Choo, Michael Kors, and Versace.

The deal, spearheaded by Tapestry’s chief executive officer Joanne Crevoiserat, turns the company into a major force in the industry with the heft to compete with Europe.

Crevoiserat, a former Abercrombie & Fitch chief operating officer, joined Tapestry in 2019, shortly after its share price was hammered amid disappointing sales.

She has helped to steady the ship but is now taking a significant gamble with the Capri deal."

Loyal customers continue to drive luxury's resilience - Drapers,"Wed, 02 Aug 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRyYXBlcnNvbmxpbmUuY29tL2luc2lnaHQvYW5hbHlzaXMvbG95YWwtY29uc3VtZXJzLWNvbnRpbnVlLXRvLWRyaXZlLWx1eHVyeXMtcmVzaWxpZW5jZdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The luxury industry can be more sheltered from the challenges encountered by the majority of fashion retailers – although it is not immune.

This area still shares the impact of staffing challenges, Brexit, inflation and slowing demand that are felt widely across the market.

Hermès, Prada and French luxury conglomerate LVMH – owner of Louis Vuitton, Dior, Loewe, Fendi and Celine among others – all posted rising sales for the first half of 2022/23. While sales at Italian rival group Kering – owner of Gucci, Bottega Veneta, Alexander McQueen and others stalled at just a 2% year on year increase because of a fall in demand for Gucci. It is reshuffling its executive team and awaiting the unveiling of new creative director Sabato De Sarno’s first collection this September.

Michael Kliger, CEO of luxury etailer Mytheresa, which is based in Germany, explains that luxury consumers can be defined into two categories: ""wardrobe builders"", whose spending has not been affected and so continue to shop; and ""aspirational dressers"", who save up for special purchases.

Kliger says that spending by aspirational dressers has slowed compared with the pandemic boom, while wardrobe builders have “showed no slowing down whatsoever”: ""Brands that have a focus on the timeless luxury shopper will [do] much better than those focusing on the aspirational market [as the timeless shopper's spend is continuous].""

Super-luxury French label Hermès, whose leather bags start at around £10,000 and often involve a waiting list, reported revenues of €6.7bn (£5.8bn) in the six months to 30 June – an increase of 25% at constant exchange rates.

Luca Solca, senior research analyst – global luxury goods at Bernstein, tells Drapers the label is “benefiting from strong brand desirability and a particularly buoyant high-end demand [for premium products].”

Revenue rose by 15% at LVMH to €42.2bn (£36.2bn) in the first six months of 2023. Profit from recurring operations increased by 13% year on year to €11.6bn (£9.9bn). The business commented that Louis Vuitton had an “excellent” first half – driven by collections from both its womenswear creative director Nicolas Ghesquière, and the first menswear catwalk collection from statement hire Pharrell Williams (main image above) – who was announced as menswear creative director in February and presented a catwalk on the Pont Neuf bridge during Paris Men’s Fashion Week in June.

Helen Brocklebank, CEO of luxury industry body Walpole, tells Drapers that positive results are familiar across the board: “The big brands with international presence are doing incredibly well.” She reports that the same is true of Walpole members Harrods and Burberry: “The overall luxury market is really strong.”

Kliger adds: “Quiet luxury is really booming but it’s not a trend as in someone has flocked to it. That customer has never stopped buying and the centre of gravity has moved to this segment of the market.”

Kering, meanwhile, is going through a period of transformation. Earlier this month the group announced that Gucci CEO Marco Bizzarri would be stepping down in September after 13 years at the label. This follows a shake-up in its image.

Following Bizzari's exit, Kering's managing director Jean-François Palus will take over at Gucci for a transitional period. The move was announced alongside the promotion of two other Kering executives. Francesca Bellettini, currently CEO at Saint Laurent, was made deputy CEO of Kering Group and will be in charge of brand development. Kering's current CFO, Jean-Marc Duplaix, has been promoted to deputy CEO and will be in charge of finance and operations.

Solca explains: “Kering is still in the process of relaunching Gucci and imagining a new aesthetics chapter for the brand. This is implying a significant organisation redesign and new responsibilities.”

Walpole’s Brocklebank says that Kering has been “dampening” only because “Gucci was on an incline for so long"".

This year, revenue at Gucci declined by 1% year on year to €5.1bn (£4.4bn) on a reported basis. For the same interim period in 2022, revenues at Kering had increased by 23% year on year to €9.9bn (£8.3bn), with Gucci's revenues seeing a growth of 15% year on year to €5.2bn (£4.4bn).

Katie Haxton, client director of boutique executive recruitment firm Flint Hyde London tells Drapers that the “shake-up” at Kering “seems well thought out”: “This will show strength and commitment for taking the group into a new phase and ultimately a transformation at Gucci, timed well with Sabato’s up and coming first show in Milan.”

She continues that a change in creative directors will “certainly” have had an impact on growth: “Luxury consumers more than ever want to feel like they are investing in the most exclusive communities in the world, and that allegiance begins with having an impactful designer at the helm. I would imagine Sarno and his creative team are feeling some pressure.”

Agnes Locret, director of international at executive recruiter Mode Search, tells Drapers: “[Kering] was on top for so long with Gucci dominating – you can tell when the cycle is coming to an end and there is only so long you can deliver growth [before the] only solution is to bring a fresh pair of eyes.”

To coincide with its step change, Kering has also been bolstering its offer by acquiring a 30% stake in Italian luxury label Valentino, which has Pierpaolo Piccioli at the helm as creative director. It announced the €1.7bn (£1.5bn) move last week. Solca says it is “a good fit for Kering – which has an established track record in effectively managing its fashion brands"".

Kering is hoping that its big unveiling of the new Gucci will reestablish growth. Haxton explains that all eyes will be on the fashion week show: “It will be interesting to see who is in attendance and who will be modelling. We have seen from Pharrell’s debut for Louis Vuitton this summer that the guestlist impacts sales just as much as the designs themselves – especially if it’s a pregnant Rihanna or Beyoncé mid a very fashionable world tour.”

While Kering focuses on recapturing the power of Gucci, the wider luxury industry is struggling with several challenges.

Kliger explains that spending by the aspirational shopper has slowed: “They might delay buying a bag this year to next year – whether this is driven by them actually having less money or just the sentiment, is hard to tell. There is no high unemployment rate, interest rates are high but not at levels we haven’t seen before. Experience ranks highest for aspirational shoppers – they would also rather spend on vacation than luxury fashion.”

Brocklebank explains that the luxury market “is a game of two halves” for the next six months – the majority of established brands are enjoying buoyancy, but smaller independent brands are feeling challenges.

She cites that access to the right number of retail staff is still a challenge, while the abolishment of VAT-free shopping “is still an impact on those that aren’t as familiar internationally.”

The “Brexit effect” is also having an impact, and while it is felt across the market, it is higher for luxury brands whose customer base is often used to a high quality of service and can alter their spending habits to a more streamlined service.

Mytheresa’s Kliger says that the first 12 months following Brexit were “chaotic” but that the UK is now a “stable” market. He adds that retailers and brands have to absolve the cost of additional processes: “Process costs for ecommerce platforms and retailers that go across [from the EU to the UK] because you now have to declare customs, and ensure all tariff costs are correct.”

However, he adds that London is still one of the strongest luxury markets in Europe.

Luxury’s biggest players are reporting positive results at the year’s halfway point, but even houses such as Kering are feeling shifts in demand. Classic consumers of luxury who are not as impacted by macro-economic factors give it a stable advantage missing from other sectors of the fashion industry – and will continue to fuel demand."

Rolex retailer Watches of Switzerland Group Plc climbed as much as 5.9% after maintaining earnings guidance in a trading update.

China ended a group travel ban to countries including the US, UK, Australia, South Korea and Japan. Buyers from the country account for about 25% of European luxury-goods sales, including purchases made by tourists, according to estimates from Goldman Sachs Group Inc.

Group tours to Switzerland, Italy, Spain, France, Greece, Denmark, Iceland, Portugal had already been approved earlier this year.

“The ban on group travel opens ‘phase two’ of Chinese luxury spend” in Europe, Sanford C. Bernstein analyst Luca Solca said in an email. “We expect group travel to resume in 2H23E and support Chinese spend on luxury goods globally. The adverse price elasticity effects suffered by the industry in 2020,” when spending from Chinese tourists had dried up, “will unwind,” Solca said.

After a solid start to the year, luxury stocks have drifted lower in recent months in response to weak Chinese consumer and economic data. Bullish investors are pinning their hopes on a revival in anticipation that Beijing will soon implement more decisive stimulus measures to kick-start a flagging economy.

The relaxation, a significant boost to the global tourism market, also sent Europe’s travel and leisure subindex 1% higher, with Air-France KLM rising as much as 2.8% and TUI AG gaining 2.4%.

Sentiment on Thursday was also supported by signs of deal activity in the sector picking up. Capri Holdings Ltd soared in US premarket trading after the Wall Street Journal reported that the owner of the Michael Kors and Versace fashion brands was nearing a deal to be acquired by Tapestry Inc.

Investment bank Goldman Sachs and financial services firm JP Morgan are advising on the potential listing.

Last month, L Catterton started working with the two financial advisers, when it was revealed the footwear brand could be valued at more than $6bn (£4.7bn) in an IPO.

L Catterton bought a majority stake in Birkenstock for an undisclosed sum in 2021. The descendants of its founder – brothers Alex and Christian Birkenstock, have kept a minority stake."
The richest man in Europe is at the centre of the world's luxury market - Irish Examiner,"Fri, 18 Aug 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmlyaXNoZXhhbWluZXIuY29tL2J1c2luZXNzL2Vjb25vbXkvYXJpZC00MTIwNzg3OC5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"It is a rarity you’ll meet someone who does not know the name Elon Musk. The entrepreneur is known for his eccentric behaviour, like naming his dog Floki, a Shiba Inu, the CEO of Twitter after he purchased the social media platform.

The CEO of electric car company Tesla is currently worth an estimated $237bn (€207bn), putting him at the top of the revered list compiled by Forbes of the 10 richest people in the world. Even without the attention-seeking behaviour, it is hard to maintain a low profile with this kind of wealth.

However, the second richest person has managed to do just that. Bernard Arnault, the CEO of French luxury group LVMH, is worth about $233bn, according to Forbes. Mr Arnault was in the top position last year as the rich continued to splash out on expensive goods while tech leaders struggled with a slowdown in the sector.

The 74-year-old does not make a habit of intentionally trying to make headlines and is often only referenced in articles about his company. Aside from his business deals, he is also known to be an art enthusiast and has collected pieces by Picasso, Henry Moore, and Andy Warhol.

Mr Arnault began his professional career in 1949 as an engineer with the Ferret-Savinel construction company and was promoted to various executive management positions before becoming chairman in 1978.

He stayed there until 1984, when he undertook the reorganisation of the Financière Agache holding company. He returned the group to profitability as he embarked upon a strategy of developing the world’s leading luxury products firm. In the process, he reinvigorated Christian Dior as the cornerstone of the new organisation.

In 1989, Mr Arnault became the majority shareholder of LVMH, creating the world’s leading luxury products group. He has been the chairman and CEO of the company since that date.

Mr Musk leapfrogged over the Frenchman to take the top spot earlier this year, as spending on luxury items normalised as inflation lingers and pent-up demand built up during the pandemic stabilises.

Expensive brands continue to weather the cost-of-living crisis across the globe but tech firms remain in choppy waters, exposing economies that rely too much on them to risk.

Mr Arnault is the only European to make the list, which features no women, and leads the group behind some of the most luxurious brands in the world including Louis Vuitton and Givenchy. The company is older than firms like Mr Musk’s Twitter, Facebook owner Meta and search engine Google.

LVMH, which owns 75 brands, experienced a slowdown in the US market earlier this year, as did its competitors Burberry and Cartier. However, LVMH has weathered the weaker demand in the US better than its peers. The group benefits from a bigger global footprint and a wide array of brands spanning Moet & Chandon champagne to Tiffany jewellery, according to Bloomberg.

Bloomberg also reported that the market in Europe is seeing the return of wealthy tourists post-covid, which is leading to higher numbers heading towards fashion hotspots like Paris and Milan.

Expensive brands continue to weather the cost-of-living crisis across the globe but tech firms remain in choppy waters, exposing economies that rely too much on them to risk.

For example, Apple recently posted its third straight quarter of declining sales and predicted a similar performance in the current period. In addition, Microsoft shares fell last quarter as the slowdown continues as the sector recovers from a post-pandemic e-commerce downturn and the impact of interest rate hikes.

Apple, as well as PC makers like Lenovo and Dell, is also reporting sales declines amid the slump.

For several years now, players in big tech have been sought after to grow gross domestic product (GDP) in various countries, including Ireland. But before everyone had a smartphone in their hands, luxury brands were a key economic health indicator as they highlighted the spending power among consumers. The companies behind them have significantly boosted economies and continue to do so.

The longevity of fashion and luxury brand companies should not be overlooked or underestimated when tech enters its renaissance period post slowdown, especially as the emergence of AI provides new hope for the sector.

Luxury goods groups like LVMH and its rival Kering, the company behind Gucci, have demonstrated durability having survived previous financial crises which tumbled shares.

It may be time for economies to go back to basics and look to fashion and high-value goods to boost the economy while tech muddles through its current storm.

One guarantee that companies like LVMH provide is consistency, no matter what the economic environment looks like.

consumers still go after the trademark fashion looks such as Burberry’s signature check pattern, Christian Louboutin’s red sole shoes or the Louis Vuitton sought-after brown leather bags, despite eye-watering prices.

Tech firms strive for change and to provide the latest cutting-edge product. For example, phones and laptops are constantly changing and each iteration decreases in value over time. This is not the case for fashion and jewellery.

Vintage pieces are held in a high regard among buyers and while designs change somewhat from time to time, consumers still go after the trademark fashion looks such as Burberry’s signature check pattern, Christian Louboutin’s red sole shoes or the Louis Vuitton sought-after brown leather bags, despite eye-watering prices.

It is difficult for other countries, especially smaller ones like Ireland, to get a slice of the luxury goods’ success in Europe as places, mainly France and Italy, have the industry sown up. Bellwether companies including LVMH and Prada already based their European headquarters in Paris and Milan.

Switzerland cannot be excluded either as it is a stronghold for opulent watches such as Rolex and Patek Philippe.

Yet, the impact of these brands can be felt in Ireland as demand for luxury brands remains strong, despite a squeeze on incomes, according to the head of Brown Thomas.

Brown Thomas Arnotts managing director Donald McDonald said the lifting of mask mandates in the country would further boost consumer confidence as he opened the group's fifth Brown Thomas store earlier this year, according to Reuters.

Some countries are making strides in significantly boosting their dominance in the luxury market though.

Fashion house Coach parent Tapestry is set to buy Michael Kors owner Capri Holdings in a deal valued at $8.5bn, creating a US fashion powerhouse to challenge larger European rivals for a bigger share of the global luxury market.

US luxury firms have consistently lagged their European peers in scale, limiting their ability to compete better.

The combined businesses will be the fourth-largest luxury company in the world, with a market share of about 5.1%, according to GlobalData analyst Neil Saunders. In the Americas, it will be the second-largest player behind LVMH, he added.

Luxury giants have been snapping up smaller brands even as inflation has potentially darkened the outlook for discretionary spending.

Cosmetics firm Estée Lauder Cos took over Tom Ford in a $2.8bn deal announced last year and completed in April.

Kering, which had held talks to buy Tom Ford before it was sold to Estée Lauder, agreed a deal last month for a 30% stake in fashion house Valentino for about $1.9bn. Kering also agreed in June to acquire perfume maker Creed at an undisclosed valuation.

Overall, luxury goods have boosted the euro area economy this year amid an energy crisis, sticky inflation and interest rate hikes.

Earlier this year, LVMH managed to reach a market capitalisation of $500bn, a monumental milestone for the continent.

That said, after a solid start to the year, luxury stocks have drifted lower in recent months in response to weak Chinese consumer and economic data, according to Bloomberg. Bullish investors are pinning their hopes on a revival in anticipation that Beijing will soon implement more decisive stimulus measures to kick-start a flagging economy.

Meanwhile, some industry leaders are looking at ways to merge both the old and the new by weaving technology into the fashion industry.

Ralph Lauren chief executive Patrice Louvet told Bloomberg his company is investing in the metaverse, a virtual reality product created by Meta.

“We want to be where our consumer is. And that's where the younger population is. That's where they want to engage with brands like us,” he said.

“We've got a partnership with Fortnite. There's some really cool boots that we developed that you can dress your player with, but we’ve actually done a physical version of them as well,” he added.

In the meantime, while tech, luxury, and most other industries battle an ongoing volatile economic environment, they must also grapple with internal pressures.

The insatiable global demand for luxury goods and LVMH’s stellar financial results have thrown the French conglomerate into an ever-brighter spotlight.

Mr Arnault has brought some of the world’s most desirable, high-end brands under the LVMH umbrella. Christian Dior, Dom Perignon and Cheval Blanc are just a few of the gems in his portfolio.

But industry observers are asking how long can LVMH continue to outperform, given doubts about luxury appetites in critical Chinese and US markets.

And now he is approaching 80, there is also the issue of succession and who the tycoon will eventually pass the reins of his empire to.

Billionaire heir seen with Blackpink Lisa a power player of business world - VnExpress International,"Wed, 23 Aug 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vZS52bmV4cHJlc3MubmV0L25ld3MvdHJlbmQvYmlsbGlvbmFpcmUtaGVpci1zZWVuLXdpdGgtYmxhY2twaW5rLWxpc2EtYS1wb3dlci1wbGF5ZXItb2YtYnVzaW5lc3Mtd29ybGQtNDY0NTExMy5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LVMH heir Frédéric Arnault is attracting attention the world over for being seen with Blackpink’s Lisa on many occasions and his business achievements.

Though there has been no specific information on Frédéric’s net worth, it would be hard for the 28-year-old man to not be a power player in the rich’s world, when his family, led by his father Bernard Arnault, have a net worth of $230 billion, according to Forbes.

The ultimate ‘nepo baby’ was even appointed CEO of the watchmaker TAG Heuer, a brand under the management of his father's conglomerate LVMH, in 2020 at the tender age of 25. He became the youngest ever chief executive in the luxury watch world with this act, reported the Australian Financial Review.

Arnault has achieved various unprecedented successes since taking the role. He managed to convince actor Ryan Gosling, who had never acted as a brand endorser before, to sign an endorsement deal with TAG Heuer.

The wealthy youngster also formed a partnership with Porsche as a promotional investment for the brand.

And though LVMH did not publicize its individual brand business results, the conglomerate’s watch and jewelry division reported a growth of 11% in sales in Q1 2023 compared to the same period last year.

With his experience working at TAG Heuer’s department of strategy and digital before taking his role as the CEO, he is raising the number of TAG Heuer stores in the U.S. to 50 by 2026 to better reach retail customers and become less reliant on third-party retailers or department stores, according to CNBC.

Occupied with his busy work, Arnault still take his time to enjoy several leisure activities, including watching films, playing sports, and playing the piano, something he inherited from his pianist mother Hélène Mercier."

Despite her solo photos from an unknown location, some eagle-eyed fans of the K-Pop star spotted similarities between her and her rumoured boyfriend and LVMH’s Bernard Arnault’s son Frederic Arnault’s locations. Amid the romance rumours, the duo was recently spotted in the US, at a private airport lounge.

She shared various snaps with a picturesque backdrop on her Instagram and her fans found that Arnault’s sister-in-law was also at the same location with her husband. Many claimed that the 26-year-old was vacationing with the Arnault family, but others needed strong proof.

Now, a photo of Lisa and Frederic Arnault allegedly waiting in a private lounge at an airport in Los Angeles, California, is making rounds on the internet. The photo has fueled the duo’s dating rumours who happen to be well-acquainted with each other. As per Allkpop, it is reported that Lisa boarded Arnault’s private plane with him in New Jersey after two Born Pink shows at MetLife Stadium. It is also believed that all four members of the quartet travelled separately to Las Vegas for their shows.

Coming back to the romance rumours, they began last year after Frederic Arnault, TAG HEUER CEO, was spotted attending a BLACKPINK show. Earlier this year, Lisa and Frederic were also spotted together in Paris. Despite the rumours, the girl band’s agency, YG Entertainment, has stayed quiet and not issued any clarification.

The owners of Birkenstock are planning an initial public offering as soon as September that could value the German sandal maker at more than $8 billion, reports said Tuesday.

Private equity firm L Catterton, which is linked to French luxury group LVMH, is looking at listing Birkenstock in the United States, Bloomberg News reported, citing people with knowledge of the matter.

Deliberations are ongoing about the flotation of the maker of wide-strapped sandals with cork and latex soles, and no final decisions have been taken on size or timing, it said.

Birkenstock and L Catterton declined to comment when contacted by AFP about the plans for the IPO, which were also reported in the Financial Times.

The planned listing comes after the company received a Hollywood boost when actress Margot Robbie donned a pair of pink Birkenstocks in the lead role of the hit movie “Barbie”.

Birkenstock was founded in 1774 to make orthopaedic shoes. By 1897, Konrad Birkenstock had made the first flexible sole fitting the contours of the feet.

The sandals were brought to the United States in the 1960s, where they were adopted by hippies who took to their no-frills comfort but also saw their utilitarian look as an anti-fashion badge.

But their “unfashionable” association with sock-and-sandal wearing Germans is a thing of the past — they have become standard footwear for celebrities while the company has launched collaborations with top brands.

In 2021, L Catterton and French luxury brand magnate Bernard Arnault’s family holding fund acquired a majority stake in Birkenstock, based in Linz am Rhein in western Germany.

Analysts estimated the price of the sale at around four billion euros ($4.4 billion).

BLACKPINK Lisa has been causing a stir due to rumors of a romantic relationship with Frédéric Arnault, the son of one of the world’s richest billionaires – Bernard Arnault, the tycoon behind the LVMH fashion conglomerate.

How did Lisa and Frédéric Arnault meet?

It is not precisely known when Lisa and Arnault first met, but there is substantial evidence suggesting they met at a fashion event.

Arnault, 28 years old, is the son of Bernard Arnault and his second wife, renowned pianist Hélène Mercier (married in 1991). Arnault is currently the CEO of Tag Heuer. Meanwhile, members of BLACKPINK have collaborated with LVMH brands: Lisa with Bulgari, Rosé with Tiffany & Co., Jisoo with Dior, and Jennie with Loewe.

Through frequent collaborations, Lisa had interactions with one of the LVMH heirs when she was a Celine ambassador.

Frédéric Arnault’s Relationship Status

Coming from a ‘chaebol of all chaebol’ family, Frédéric Arnault’s private life is quite discreet. The rumored boyfriend of Lisa prefers to keep his personal life private, staying away from unnecessary media attention.

According to ebiographypost, Frédéric Arnault was previously seen in numerous photos alongside a girl named Fernanda Mottura. In May 2021, Fernanda graduated from the University of Cambridge with a Master’s in Law. She was once an intern at DLA Piper.

Frédéric Arnault took this girl to the Cannes Awards ceremony in 2016 but didn’t confirm their relationship. Many believe they may have had a romantic connection but tried to keep it private. There’s also information suggesting they were just good friends.

However, social media, especially Twitter, circulated intimate images between the billionaire’s son and Fernanda Mottura. According to sources, they were once a couple but have since broken up. To this day, both still follow each other on Instagram.
