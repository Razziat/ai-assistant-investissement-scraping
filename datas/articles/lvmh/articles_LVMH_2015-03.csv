LVMH Celebrates Its Designer Search - The New York Times,"Thu, 05 Mar 2015 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMTUvMDMvMDYvZmFzaGlvbi9sdm1oLWNlbGVicmF0ZXMtaXRzLWRlc2lnbmVyLXNlYXJjaC1wYXJpcy1mYXNoaW9uLXdlZWstMjAxNS5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS — “Is this the god of London?” Kanye West exclaimed to the English designer Craig Green before hopping into Mr. Green’s booth and gamely strapping into one of his armor-like, tunic-cum-breastplate designs.

Of course Mr. West, who spent at least an hour visiting with the 26 global labels selected as shortlist semifinalists for the second edition of the LVMH Young Fashion Designer Prize, thronged by cameras all the way, was only one of the star visitors to the open-house cocktail party on Wednesday night, though he might have been the most appreciative of the lot.

Around him, and in the packed aisles that ran between rows of designer booths — so filled with people, photographers and videographers that to move along gave one a distinct sympathy for salmon in their quest upstream — other big-name attendees circulated.

Here was Karl Lagerfeld, a prize-jury member, recalling that his own career was jump-started by a prize (from the International Wool Secretariat, in 1954) and gossiping in German with Arthur Arbesser, a Viennese shortlister based in Milan."
LVMH's Tag Heuer surfs wave of smartwatch partnerships - Yahoo Lifestyle UK,"Wed, 18 Mar 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vdWsuc3R5bGUueWFob28uY29tL3RlY2gvcy9sdm1ocy10YWctaGV1ZXItc3VyZnMtd2F2ZS1zbWFydHdhdGNoLXBhcnRuZXJzaGlwcy0yMjM0MTI2NTYtLWZpbmFuY2UuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"By Astrid Wendlandt BASEL, Switzerland (Reuters) - Tag Heuer plans to unveil a smartwatch on Thursday among a wave of partnerships expected at the world's biggest watch fair this week as luxury watchmakers fight back against Apple. The Swiss watch brand, the biggest at French luxury group LVMH, will announce it is teaming up with U.S. chip maker Intel Corp to create a digital version of one of its best-selling model, industry sources have said. Tag Heuer is planning to launch next autumn a smartwatch version of its Carrera watch that will offer many of the same functions as the Apple watch such as geolocation, distance walked and altitude. The major difference is that the watch will be a digital replica of the original Tag Heuer black Carrera, known for its bulky, sporty allure, and will look like the original. ""People will have the impression that they are wearing a normal watch,"" Tag Heuer Chief Executive Jean-Claude Biver told Reuters in an interview at Baselworld, the industry's biggest fair where retailers place their orders for the year. Biver agreed with Swatch Group Chief Executive Nick Hayek who said the smartwatch ""would increase the cake"" for the industry as a whole. ""Apple will get young people used to wearing a watch and later maybe they will want to buy themselves a real watch,"" Biver said. The jury is still out on whether Apple's smartwatch will be a major success once it hits the stores next month but Swiss watch makers have been busy trying to come up with attractive alternatives ahead of time. Many analysts predict Apple's watch, to be priced from $349 to $17,000, will dent sales at several Swatch Group brands, such as Tissot and Omega. JPMorgan estimates 33 percent of Swatch Group's profit is exposed to Apple's watch threat. Swatch Group has told analysts it will integrate near field communication (NFC) into several of its watch brands, first Swatch, then Tissot and Omega. It said its competitive advantage would be longer battery life than Apple's watch as its smartwatches, having more limited capabilities, would require less energy. Apple watches must be recharged every 18 hours, meaning they typically cannot be worn overnight. Tissot, which has long been making watches with touch screens, on Wednesday unveiled its new connected T-Touch fitted watch with a solar battery. Makers of traditional mechanic watches such as Hermes and family-owned Patek Philippe said there would always be demand for the real thing. Their argument is that the technology of smartwatches such as that of Apple will be obsolete after a few years while luxury watches could last centuries. They also pointed out that Apple's watch needed an iPhone to be in close proximity to function fully. ""When you are buy a Patek Philippe, you buy a timeless piece of art,"" said Patek Philippe Chairman Thierry Stern. ""It would be as if you told people to no longer buy paintings but TV screens projecting the image of a painting."" Stern also said he believed many consumers would prefer wearing a traditional watch with a suit or a black tie, rather than a smartwatch. Both Patek Philippe sand Hermes said they had no plans to market smartwatches. ""For the moment, Hermes is observing what is going on,"" said Guillaume de Seynes, a managing director at Hermes. ""We still do not know how the smartwatch market will evolve."" (Reporting by Astrid Wendlandt, editing by David Evans)"

The Sephora effect: How the cosmetics retailer transformed the beauty industry - The Washington Post,"Mon, 09 Mar 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiQFodHRwczovL3d3dy53YXNoaW5ndG9ucG9zdC5jb20vbmV3cy9idXNpbmVzcy93cC8yMDE1LzAzLzA5L3RoZS1zZXBob3JhLWVmZmVjdC1ob3ctdGhlLWNvc21ldGljcy1yZXRhaWxlci10cmFuc2Zvcm1lZC10aGUtYmVhdXR5LWluZHVzdHJ5L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The beauty industry has had something of a makeover recently as cosmetics retailers have learned an important lesson about selling their goods to millennials: They don’t want to buy makeup the same way their moms did. The clearest evidence of this shift has been the explosive growth of Sephora and Ulta, specialty beauty retailers that have gained traction with shoppers by offering an in-store experience that is distinct in the beauty marketplace.

“Sephora and Ulta have tapped into every little girl’s dream of being able to open up their mom’s makeup bag and just play,” said Stephanie Wissink, a senior research analyst at Piper Jaffray & Co.

Before these stores began popping up at malls across the country, beauty shoppers largely had two choices: Buy their makeup at a no-frills drugstore, such as CVS or Duane Reade, or go to a fancy department store counter and let a white-lab-coat-wearing specialist spend an hour dabbing their face with pricey anti-aging creams.

Experts say that Sephora and Ulta have filled in the wide chasm between those experiences. They have an assortment of upscale brands and trendy store design that give them a more exclusive luster than a drugstore. And yet they feel more accessible than a department store because shoppers can test out all the products for themselves.

By occupying this middle ground, both brands have seen extraordinary growth. Since 2007, Bolingbrook, Ill.-based Ulta Beauty has more than tripled its store count to about 765. About 50 of those outposts were opened in the third quarter of 2014 alone. In that quarter, Ulta delivered blockbuster results: A 30 percent increase in profit and a 21 percent increase in revenue, growth that was fueled by an increase in the number of transactions at its stores and an uptick in the average value of those transactions. The impressive performance has driven its stock up nearly 59 percent in the last year.

Sephora, which today has 360 North American stores and nearly 1,800 outposts worldwide, is owned by French luxury conglomerate LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton. LVMH said in a February earnings announcement that Sephora “had an exceptional year and continued to gain market share.” The “selective retailing” division of LVMH, of which Sephora is a cornerstone brand, saw an 8 percent increase in revenue in 2014.

With an announcement last week that it is opening an Innovation Lab in San Francisco, Sephora telegraphed its seriousness about continuing to grow its market share in this category. The company said the team there will be responsible for developing and testing new technology to be used in its stores and e-commerce operation.

Experts say millennials have flocked to these stores because their setup and merchandise assortment is uniquely aligned with what research shows this generation of shopper prefers.

Today’s cosmetics customer is not particularly loyal to any one brand, according to Kurt Jetta, the chief executive of Tabs Group, a consumer analytics firm that studies beauty shoppers.

Instead, customers approach buying beauty products as more of a treasure hunt, and the mission is that much easier in a place where you can easily test virtually any product. Plus, both Sephora and Ulta carry a selection of niche, under-the-radar brands, which can be appealing to millennial shoppers who gravitate toward items that give them a sense of individuality.

Karen Grant, a beauty industry analyst with NPD Group, said these specialty stores have also created an environment that is well-suited for customers who don’t need much help in making their purchases.

“With the explosion of the Web, [shoppers have] more access, and the consumer can do much more research,” Grant said. “They don’t have to go to a counter to get that education.”

The rise of Sephora and Ulta has also pushed traditional beauty players to rethink their offerings. You’ve likely noticed that CVS and other drugstores have moved to create splashier, better-lit displays in their beauty aisles to try to give them a more upscale, experiential vibe. And department stores are moving more products from behind the counter so shoppers can do more testing of their own. In perhaps the clearest concession that customers prefer Sephora’s model, JCPenney has partnered with the brand to open some 430 “store-within-a-store” Sephoras at JCPenney locations across the country.

Macy’s recent acquisition of Bluemercury may also offer some clues about how department stores view the future of the beauty category. Macy’s hadn’t made an acquisition in about a decade, and yet it announced earlier this year that it will put up $210 million for a chain of 59 specialty stores and spas that compete directly with Sephora and Ulta.

Direct-selling models such as Avon’s are also under siege, thanks to millennials’ changing beauty preferences. Why go to a party in someone’s home to test makeup when you can do it at the mall on your own time? While Avon has been weighed down by a number of business woes in recent years, including bribery charges, experts say the change in the cosmetics market may be part of the reason that the brand is struggling to recruit a U.S. sales force and has seen its profits slide in recent quarters."
