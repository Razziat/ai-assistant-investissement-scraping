The Rise of LVMH: Story of the Arnault Luxury Family Business Giant - Tharawat Magazine,"Sun, 18 Sep 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoYXJhd2F0LW1hZ2F6aW5lLmNvbS9ncm93L2x2bWgtZmFtaWx5LWJ1c2luZXNzLWx1eHVyeS_SAUdodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGFyYXdhdC1tYWdhemluZS5jb20vZ3Jvdy9sdm1oLWZhbWlseS1idXNpbmVzcy1sdXh1cnkvYW1wLw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Long before the 1987 merger that gave life to French luxury goods giant LVMH was the births of two family businesses Moët et Chandon and Louis Vuitton. Moët et Chandon was founded when Claude Moët and his son Claude-Louis started a wine business called Moët et Cie, running the company together and establishing its old world heritage before passing it down to Claude’s grandson Jean-Rémy in 1792.

Louis Vuitton, a solo venture of the company’s namesake, Louis Vuitton, started as a small packing and luggage company that over time grew to include Louis’s son, Georges. It was Georges who stretched the company beyond the borders of France and into the international marketplace when he opened the first Louis Vuitton store in London in 1885. The foundations laid by the Vuitton father-son duo paved the way for another father and son, Jean and Bernard Arnault to take these founders’ old world crafts and turn the companies into the worldwide luxury brand that we know today.

Birth of LVMH

In 1971, Frenchman Bernard Arnault graduated from university and joined his father Jean’s successful construction company called Ferret-Savinel. By 1978, after years of upward mobility and successful restructuring under his father’s watch, Arnault succeeded Jean as Chairman of Ferrel-Savinel and eventually went on to reorganize the Financière Agache holding company, owner of the ailing House of Dior by Christian Dior. As part of this reorganization, Arnault set his eye on developing a strategy that would not only reinvigorate the House of Dior brand, but also create a new paradigm in the luxury goods industry.

In 1988, shortly after the merger between Moët Hennessy and Louis Vuitton resulted in the creation of LVMH, Arnault methodically implemented his vision for luxury goods with quick, opportunistic action when Louis Vuitton’s president invited him to invest in the new company’s stock. This invitation, a colossal mistake on the part of the president who hoped his invitation would solidify an alliance with Arnault and give him greater control of the newly formed company, allowed Arnault to channel his resources and purchase far more shares than expected, giving him a 43.5% stake in LVMH.

To Each His Own

With his claim staked out, Arnault was appointed Chairman and CEO of LVMH in 1989 and immediately set his sights on expanding the new company. What followed in the next two decades was an impressive sweep of luxury goods companies including Dom Pérignon, Givenchy, Fendi, Tag Heur, Sephora and sixty five other well-established brands worldwide.

With each acquisition, Arnault insisted on retaining each brands’ unique identity and name while operating under the umbrella of LVMH. This strategy gave Arnault the freedom to refine brands and refresh their images while maintaining their heritage and followership. The insistence on running the individual brands autonomously gave LVMH a wider swath of the marketplace, keeping consumers loyally engaged with their favorite products without realizing how many of them belong to the same parent company. It is also why each brand, internally governed, was able to uphold its unique identity and maintain its reputation of quality.

Rutheless Expansion

While many of Arnault’s acquisitions came easily to LVMH, not every one of his targets went down without a fight. Two of his greatest failures in acquisition to date followed his attempts to take over Gucci in 2001 and Hermes in 2014. In both cases, Arnault set out to buy small quantities of each brand’s stock, while insisting that LVMH had no intention of expanding said ownership.

Like a wolf in sheep’s clothing however, Arnault began aggressively pursuing the full acquisition of Gucci shortly after purchasing shares in the company, alerting Gucci’s leadership to his plan. Gucci responded by offering itself up to LVMH and Arnault for $85 million, an offer Arnault refused. This refusal bought Gucci time to protect itself against Arnault’s advances with swift legal action and creating an alliance with Francois Pinault, chairman of LVMH’s archrival Kering, who ultimately bought out the shares owned by LVMH over a two year period.

Hermes, on the other hand, endured a much longer, more arduous defense against LVMH after a small batch of its stock was quietly purchased in 2001. Perhaps having learned from his failure with Gucci, Arnault crafted a slower advance on Hermes, purchasing chunks of the company over the course of a decade without Hermes’s knowledge. In 2010, LVMH announced to much surprise that it had acquired a cumulative 14.2% stake in Hermes gained partly via derivatives that allowed it to not declare its holding, causing Hermès CEO Patrick Thomas to declare, “If you want to seduce a beautiful woman, you don’t start by raping her from behind”. The announcement kicked off years of legal battles and criminal complaints, which came to a close in 2014 when Arnault relinquished most of his $7.5 billion holding in Hermes.

A Family Affair

Despite the controversies, Bernard Arnault’s commitment to building a luxury empire has propelled LVMH to become the largest luxury good producer in the world today, and his successful model of brand integration has gone on to inspire other luxury companies such as French conglomerate Kering and Swiss giant Richemont into doing the same. And after twenty seven years of growth under his leadership, his successors are now looking to take on the family heritage, Arnault’s daughter Delphine joined LVMH in 2000 and after taking on a variety of roles including management board chairperson and deputy managing director of Christian Dior, was appointed executive vice president of Louis Vuitton, a position she continues to hold today.

Delphine is not the only Arnault offspring to lend a hand in LMVH’s success. Her younger brother Antoine joined the company shortly after Delphine and quickly climbed the ladder as his father and sister had before him. Today, he is the CEO of luxury menswear brand Berluti, which has grown under his watch from $45 million a year to $130 million in sales.

Rumors are circulating that 67 year old Arnault will soon retire as Chairman and CEO of LVMH and place his company in the capable hands of Delphine with Antoine’s support. Time will tell if this is true, but one thing is certain: the strategic growth of LVMH under Arnault’s watch ensures that the brand will be a prominent force in luxury goods for generations to come."
LVMH inaugurates new creative perfume workshops in the French town of Grasse - Premium beauty,"Fri, 16 Sep 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnByZW1pdW1iZWF1dHluZXdzLmNvbS9lbi9sdm1oLWluYXVndXJhdGVzLW5ldy1jcmVhdGl2ZSwxMDI2NNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"French group LVMH yesterday inaugurated the creative workshops that will be shared by Jacques Cavallier Belletrud and François Demachy, the Master Perfumers of the Maisons Louis Vuitton and Christian Dior, in the heart of Grasse, a city situated on the French Riviera and which boast to be the cradle of contemporary perfumery, thanks to a history of flower farming.

“Les Fontaines Parfumées”, the site dedicated to the production of perfume, has been given a new lease of life. Located at the heart of the town, the old building, which used to be a form and a perfumery shop, has been restored entirely.

As nature constitutes a special source of inspiration for the Master Perfumers, 350 essences have been rigorously selected by Jacques Cavallier Belletrud and François Demachy, both originally from Grasse, to create a sensual palette throughout the estate: exceptional roses, tuberoses, jasmin, citrus trees, lavender, mint… the list goes on.

However, only 30 tons per 40 hectares of perfume flowers are produced in Grasse today. To support cultivation for the future, the Maison Christian Dior entered into exclusive partnerships ten year ago, firstly with the local estate “Domaine de Manon”, then with the “Clos de Callian”, from where Christian Dior has committed to purchasing its entire crop. Louis Vuitton will similarly form partnerships with young producers.

Lastly, in addition to the courses offered in various establishments throughout the region, the two Master-Perfumers welcome apprentices from Grasse and the local area to Les Fontaines Parfumées as a means of introducing them to the art of creativity. In so doing they maintain the transfer of knowledge from master to disciple, a tradition from which they themselves were beneficiaries."

See which other château and vineyard owners made the list.

This list has been expanded and updated from Jane Anson’s original story published in 2015. Updates and editing by Chris Mercer.

Bernard Arnault, who’s Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton empire includes names such as Krug, Dom Perignon and Cheval Blanc, was beaten into second place on the annual French rich list by L’Oreal’s Liliane Bettancourt.

But, he is still the richest French wine château owner.

French magazine Challenges estimated Arnault’s fortune at €30.3 billion, down from €34.6bn in its 2015 rich list.

Around one in 10 of those listed are connected to French wine châteaux and vineyards.

Here are some of the most prominent names:

Serge Dassault , whose family owns Chateau Dassault in St-Emilion alongside the aeronautical business, remains at number five but has seen his fortune rise to €20bn in 2016, from with €17.5bn last year.

The Wertheimer brothers , of Chanel and owners of Château Rauzan Ségla and Château Canon in Bordeaux are up one place to sixth, with €16.5bn.

Château Latour owner Francois Pinault is seventh, also up one place versus 2015 despite losing money. He has an estimated fortune of €11.7bn, down €1bn on last year, through parent company Kering. Pinault also owns Araujo Estate in Napa Valley.

Pierre Castel , the wine and beer magnate who turns 90 in October, is up three places to eighth. He has a fortune of €8bn, versus €7.5bn in 2015.

Vincent Bolloré is 10th with €7.3bn, down one place versus 2015 after losing a third of his fortune in the past 12 months. His namesake firm has a 39% stake in Socfin Group, one of the world’s biggest plantation owners, alongside various media and transport investments. It owns several estates in southern France, including Domaine de la Croix and Domaine de la Bastide Blanche in Provence.

François Perrodo, of Château Labegorce and energy company Perenco, remains 12th in 2016 with an estimated fortune of €7bn.

There’s special mention for the Ricard family in 21st place. It is the biggest single shareholder in publicly listed Pernod Ricard with a 13% stake. Pernod Ricard doesn’t deal in French wine but does own Campo Viejo in Spain, Brancott Estate in New Zealand, Jacob’s Creek in Australia and Graffigna in Argentina.

Robert Peugeot , who still holds 14% of the namesake car manufacturer and is co-owner of Château Guiraud in Sauternes , is 23rd with an estimated fortune of €2.8bn. He had €3.6bn last year.

The Bouygues brothers of Château Montrose fell three places to 30th in 2016. But they only lost 4% of their fortune, bringing them in at €2.3bn. They own 20% of their namesake telecoms giant.

At 37 is the Hériard-Dubreuil family of Rémy Cointreau, with a fortune of €2bn in 2016, up 20% on 2015.

On the heels of Louis Vuitton announcing their latest fragrance line, Claude Martinez, Chairman and CEO of Parfums Christian Dior, and Michael Burke, Chairman and CEO of Louis Vuitton, have now inaugurated “Les Fontaines Parfumées”, the creative workshops of Jacques Cavallier Belletrud and François Demachy, the Master Perfumers of the Maisons Louis Vuitton and Christian Dior, in the heart of the world’s perfume capital, Grasse, situated on the French Riviera.

Les “Fontaines Parfumées”, the site dedicated to the production of perfume, has been given a new lease of life. After four years of study and research into the legacy of the site, almost 200 artisans and journeymen, primarily from the region – as a mark of respect for the local craftsmanship – were entrusted with the restoration work of this centrepiece at the heart of the town. The challenge of the two Maisons has been to preserve the heritage while applying contemporary features to the ancient structure of the Bastide and its mill in order to establish a place that would give rise to creativity, exchange and education. The estate welcomes every year several hundred colleagues from the Maisons Christian Dior and Louis Vuitton, to share with them the exceptional characteristics of the raw materials from the Grasse region and the outstanding knowledge and expertise of the two creative Maisons.

Nature constitutes a special source of inspiration for the Master Perfumers. 350 essences have been rigorously selected by Jacques Cavallier Belletrud and François Demachy, both originally from Grasse, to create this sensual palette throughout the estate: exceptional roses, tuberoses, jasmin, citrus trees, lavender, mint…the list goes on.
