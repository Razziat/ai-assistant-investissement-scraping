"Down US$30 billion, luxury titan is still betting on growth - South China Morning Post","Mon, 11 May 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjbXAuY29tL2xpZmVzdHlsZS9mYXNoaW9uLWJlYXV0eS9hcnRpY2xlLzMwODM1MjAvbHZtaC1vd25lci1oYXMtbG9zdC1tdWNoLWplZmYtYmV6b3MtaGFzLWdhaW5lZC11czMw0gFxaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAuc2NtcC5jb20vbGlmZXN0eWxlL2Zhc2hpb24tYmVhdXR5L2FydGljbGUvMzA4MzUyMC9sdm1oLW93bmVyLWhhcy1sb3N0LW11Y2gtamVmZi1iZXpvcy1oYXMtZ2FpbmVkLXVzMzA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Undeterred, Arnault has been heading to his war room every day, where he’s fighting to keep a blockbuster acquisition and a couple of pharaonic real estate projects on track, while holding video calls with deputies as they prepare to reopen factories and boutiques in a virus-shaken world.

Arnault’s wealth has plunged. With LVMH shares down 19 per cent this year, his net worth has shrunk by more than US$30 billion – meaning he has lost more money than any other individual in the world, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. As of May 6, he had lost about as much money as Amazon.com chairman Jeff Bezos had gained.

In his ninth-floor office on Paris’s Avenue Montaigne, Europe’s wealthiest man, Bernard Arnault, is spending long hours plotting a post-virus future for his luxury goods empire, LVMH. At 71, the billionaire has lived through several crises, but none quite like this one, with his armada of more than 70 brands – from Dior to Fendi – hit from all sides.

“He’s putting himself in a position to keep taking share once the market gets back to growth,” says Mario Ortelli, founding partner of luxury consultancy Ortelli & Co. in London.

Since the late 1980s, Arnault has dazzled – and at times scandalised – the rarefied world of French business with his prodigious flair for turning the creativity and craftsmanship of Europe’s oldest brands into a windfall of ever-growing profits. His flagship Louis Vuitton brand is estimated by analysts to have a profit margin as high as 45 per cent.

The mark-ups on that brand’s monogrammed trunks and handbags, as well as the earnings from other golden-goose products like Hennessy cognac and Dom Perignon champagne, have helped fuel Arnault’s expanding presence in most things rich people spend money on: whether they buy a Fendi handbag, a Bulgari watch, or stay at Venice’s Hotel Cipriani, they’re adding to Arnault’s coffers.

But as the coronavirus outbreak and lockdown measures to contain it plunge the global economy into its worst crisis since World War II, being the number one beneficiary of discretionary spending suddenly does not look so hot.

Most of Arnault’s fashion boutiques around the world have shut down for more than a month, leading to billions in missed revenue in his most profitable division. The maker of a fifth of the world’s champagne is selling a lot less of it with parties and concerts cancelled and nightclubs and restaurants closed. J’adore Dior perfume is less of a priority for the world’s masked masses.

Amid all that, Arnault is on the hook to pay US$16 billion for Tiffany & Co. in what was billed as the luxury industry’s biggest-ever acquisition. LVMH has pushed back at any suggestion that it would walk away from the deal or renegotiate the price after the US jeweller’s business similarly stalled.

“What’s happened with Covid-19 is a perfect storm for luxury,” Ortelli says. “You’ve got a contraction in GDP along with an increase in uncertainty.”

Still, investors would be writing Arnault off at their own peril. LVMH shares have fared better than those of Gucci owner Kering and watchmaker Richemont, which have fallen 25 per cent and 30 per cent, respectively. Arnault’s brands, their juicy margins, and his cash pile of about €9 billion (US$9.7 billion) give him the flexibility not just to ride out the crisis but to keep expanding.

“We are very much long-term oriented,” LVMH chief financial officer Jean-Jacques Guiony says. “In a crisis a lot of people say things will never be the same, but we are still confident.”

Historically, Arnault has made a career out of investing through downturns when his competitors were too weakened or too skittish to forge ahead. The recession in the early 2000s saw him squeeze Prada out of its shareholding at his newly acquired Fendi brand.

It was also when he launched the first luxury e-commerce emporium and built in Tokyo what was then Louis Vuitton’s biggest ever store.

“You could divide the world’s top billionaires into highly successful risk managers and highly successful risk takers; Arnault is a highly successful risk taker,” says Pauline Brown, the former chairman of LVMH Americas. “When he feels momentum and long-term potential, he uses the resources he has to go after it aggressively.”

LVMH’s strategy has often been to spend big to win big. In recent years, a sort of communications race against the likes of Chanel and Gucci has seen the company flying hundreds of guests each spring to runway shows around the world, housing them in plush addresses like the French Riviera’s Hotel du Cap-Eden-Roc or Marrakech’s La Mamounia resort. Such extravagance has served to reinforce the cachet of Arnault’s biggest brands.

Those events were scuttled this year, along with much of the budget for developing the accompanying collections.

Advertising spending was also slashed, along with the next season of menswear and haute couture fashion shows that would normally have taken place in June and July. Some of the events are likely to be replaced by less expensive presentations online.

What’s perhaps extraordinary, however, is the investment that Arnault still plans to maintain. With the outlook for international tourism still cloudy, LVMH is sticking to its plan to reopen the Samaritaine department store in Paris as a duty-free shopping hub and luxury hotel. Construction has resumed, with the US$1 billion project now targeting a possible February opening next year. LVMH also plans to build a Cheval Blanc luxury hotel on Los Angeles’ Rodeo Drive.

With major projects like the Samaritaine, “once you’ve engaged, it makes better sense to complete it than to stop and start again”, Guiony says.

Also, Givenchy is moving forward with plans to recruit a new designer and retool the brand’s aesthetic in time for a September fashion show – even if virus-related restrictions might preclude gathering a crowd for the designer’s debut.

In contrast, Italian shoemaker Salvatore Ferragamo says it suspended or cancelled non-fundamental investments in March.

With LVMH set to report its steepest ever declines – analysts currently expect first-half operating profit to fall by roughly half – Arnault could still make deep cuts. The company plans to cut capital expenditure by 30-35 per cent this year, delaying some store openings and renovations. Already in the US, its Sephora chain laid off more than 3,000 people, or about 30 per cent of store staff, in early April.

While other recent crises were purely economic, “this one is psychological, and could last for a generation”, Brown says. “I think it’s going to call for a very different approach across the portfolio.”

LVMH’s core assets are “very tightly managed, but there is this long tail of smaller brands that don’t get the same scrutiny”, she says.

Thanks to its cash pile and with sales showing green shoots of a rebound in China, LVMH could just as well double down on investing through the crisis. Highly specialised suppliers, prime real estate and top talent could all come up for grabs.

And while Arnault isn’t known for being a bargain hunter, he’d be loath to pass up on opportunities to add unique assets to his stable.

The industry’s fate, and Arnault’s with it, will largely depend on China, a market that accounts for more than one-third of luxury sales and two-thirds of the sector’s growth in recent years.

“In April, in the large brands, we’ve seen very high growth rates in mainland China,” Guiony says. “It really shows the appetite of Chinese people after two months of lockdown to come back to their previous pattern of consumption.”

Consumer data, however, shows many Chinese plan to spend more cautiously. And even if the pent-up demand that has been called “revenge spending” there is real, the boost will not be enough to ease the luxury industry’s woes.

Closer to home, Monday will provide LVMH’s first big test for relaunching its business in the rest of the world, as France’s lockdown measures start to ease. After the company reconfigured French factories to crank out protective masks and sanitising hand gel – as much as 60 tonnes per week – since March, production of its famed accessories has resumed.

Shops including most Sephora, Dior and Louis Vuitton locations are set to reopen, as well as the Bon Marché department store. A Sephora spokeswoman says it is ramping up click-and-collect options, with French stores now filling orders within two hours, and installing Plexiglas barriers at the registers.

Steps away from Arnault’s war room, the hiss of hydraulic lifts and the thuds of hammers can be heard behind scaffolding-wrapped windows at Christian Dior’s founding boutique on Avenue Montaigne. With Arnault’s blessing, the storied house is forging ahead with plans for a sweeping renovation that will triple its size: yet another bet that the industry will rise again.

Winners Take All: How LVMH and Kering Will Extend Their Supremacy Post-Pandemic - The Business of Fashion,"Tue, 26 May 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5idXNpbmVzc29mZmFzaGlvbi5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvbHV4dXJ5L3dpbm5lcnMtdGFrZS1hbGwtaG93LWx2bWgtYW5kLWtlcmluZy13aWxsLWV4dGVuZC10aGVpci1zdXByZW1hY3ktcG9zdC1wYW5kZW1pYy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS, France —As the coronavirus pandemic's long-term toll began to reveal itself, the fashion industry showed a rare semblance of solidarity. During one week in May, two groups of designers, executives and retailers published proposals to fix a broken system that relies on antiquated rules in order to buy, sell and market goods.

One, led by Belgian designer Dries Van Noten, urged the industry to say no to early-season discounting and move the delivery schedule back a few months, making warm-weather clothes available in warm-weather months, and cold-weather clothes in cold-weather months. Another, dubbed #rewiringfashion and facilitated by BoF's Imran Amed and Tim Blanks, took things further, calling for a shift of the entire fashion calendar, starting when clothes are presented to buyers, press and consumers and ending when they are put on discount.

The efforts gained widespread support, with more than 1,500 industry figures, from Proenza Schouler designers Jack McCollough and Lazaro Hernandez to Bergdorf Goodman’s Linda Fargo, signing the #rewiringfashion petition. But missing from the conversation were many of the most powerful brands in the world, including Prada, Hermès and Chanel, as well as those owned by multinational conglomerates LVMH and Kering.

When they first assembled, these independent groups did not invite the heavy hitters to join in their conversations, mostly because they're facing two very different realities. Many of luxury’s top players don’t need things to change so quickly. The current system, with all its faults, has worked well for them. They sell most of their goods directly to the consumer, which means they don’t have to go on discount if they don’t want to. They increasingly own — or at least control — their manufacturing, which means they can choose when to ramp up production or when to slow it down. They can stage a runway show any time of the year they’d like, and are able to put enough marketing dollars behind it to make it worthwhile. Their finances give them the freedom to do as they please.

However, as conversations advance, the megalabels are announcing plans that so far align with the independents. Kering-owned Gucci recently said it would go ""seasonless,"" scaling back to two fashion shows per year, while Saint Laurent — also owned by Kering — said that it would skip fashion week this fall, planning instead to show at a yet-to-be-determined time when it makes the most sense for both the brand and its customers. No LVMH brands have made announcements, but the group has recently joined in the discussions already underway.

The independent players know that if they really want things to change, especially when it comes to the fashion week calendar, they won't be able to do without the support of the strategic groups. In an industry in the midst of major consolidation, that's who holds the cards.

LVMH and Kering’s primary battleground is the market for personal luxury goods, worth €281 billion (about $311 billion at current exchange rates) in 2019, according to Bain & Company. A back-of-the-envelope calculation finds that about 40 percent of the market last year was controlled by five companies — LVMH, Kering, Richemont, Hermès and Chanel. To come to this number, BoF took the direct-to-consumer sales of each company and added them to an estimate of retail revenue from wholesale partnerships. The market share, in reality, is probably larger.

The two conglomerates came to dominate the category over the last three decades by snapping up dusty, family-run fashion and leather goods houses and transforming them into global brands backed by corporate infrastructure and large sums of capital. This allows them to control their own supply chains, recruit top talent, develop the most sophisticated marketing and advertising strategies and spend handsomely on prime release estate.

For instance, in the early days of 2020, LVMH made headlines for offering to pay record rents for new Dior and Fendi stores in Milan’s historic Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II shopping arcade. After winning a public auction, Dior will pay €5 million (about $5.5 million) a year for its space, while Fendi will pay €2.4 million (about $2.6 million). The current tenants, smaller Italian rivals Versace and Armani — two global fashion brands with roots in the city — simply could not compete with these bids.

Of course, those bids were placed before the outbreak of a novel coronavirus became a pandemic, killing hundreds of thousands of people, leaving millions others unemployed and forcing the global economy into a severe recession. Today, in the age of Covid-19, the LVMH and Kering empires are being put to a great test. The luxury sector is forecasted to contract by up to 39 percent this year, according to BoF and McKinsey & Company's Coronavirus Update to The State of Fashion 2020. Retail stores across the world were shut down by government-enforced lockdowns and, while consumers in most places were able to shop online, many simply didn't want to — or could no longer afford non-discretionary purchases.

That lack of consumption has already hit the industry hard. Fashion brands and retailers encumbered by debt are closing. Factories are panicking, waiting on payments while sitting on goods that were produced pre-crisis. While China's re-opening in early April has provided a glimmer of hope, the outlook remains uncertain, with consumer spending in the country down 7.5 percent from a year earlier. Chinese consumers are by far the biggest driver of growth for luxury, but much of their money is spent during overseas travel, which has effectively stopped. The tourism industry is projecting a recovery timeline of three to five years, and shopping habits — including Chinese spending money abroad while travelling — may never return to normal. Morgan Stanley projects that LVMH's organic sales will decrease by 49 percent in the second quarter of this year, versus 17 percent in the first quarter, with annual sales down 18 percent and EBIT (earnings before interest and taxes) down 22 percent.

As a result, stock prices have taken a hit. As of May 25, LVMH’s share price was down 13 percent from the beginning of the year, while Kering’s was down 26 percent. The CAC-40 Index, which includes 40 of the most important stocks traded on the Euronext Paris, was down about 24 percent year-to-date.

The strategic groups' relative resilience has made analysts confident in the long-term health of both businesses. In luxury, like other industries, only the strong — those with the tightest production lines, the biggest networks and the most cash — will endure. And if any companies are going to emerge from the coronavirus pandemic more powerful, it’s LVMH and Kering.

Luxury is Europe's big tech.

Just as the FAANG companies (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google) have come to dominate not only their own industry — technology — but also culture and commerce, LVMH and Kering have done something similar in luxury. “Luxury is Europe’s big tech,” said Scott Galloway, a professor of marketing at New York University’s Stern School of Business. “Consolidation like that is very hard to reverse.”

Before any of this happened, the luxury fashion industry was already consolidating around a handful of key players, including independent operators Hermès and Chanel, as well as strategic groups including Switzerland’s Richemont — which owns Cartier and Chloé — Italy’s OTB Group, owner of Diesel, Maison Margiela and Marni, and newer US-based firm Capri Holdings, which controls Jimmy Choo, Versace and Michael Kors. But none is as mighty as the two dominant groups.

“LVMH and Kering have built a competitive advantage that will just increase over time,” said Mario Ortelli, managing partner at Ortelli & Co., a strategic advisory. “It’s very difficult for anyone else to catch up.”

The Genesis of Modern Luxury

The rise of LVMH and Kering tells a fairly neat-and-compact story of the formation of the modern luxury industry. Owning and displaying luxury goods has long been a way to communicate social status, but 20 years ago, it just wasn’t as common to possess a Louis Vuitton bag or a Gucci watch if you were middle class. The concept of masstige — or shiny, luxury-branded products that a large constituency of consumers can afford, or at least feel comfortable charging to their credit card — was only in its infancy.

With the revival of old houses, that began to change. While the Chanel flap bag was invented in 1929, it didn't go mass until Creative Director Karl Lagerfeld embedded an interlocking CC into the closure in the 1980s. In 1994, the house of Dior introduced a quilted, top-handled rival to Chanel's flap, and called it the Lady. But it was the introduction of Fendi's baguette in 1997 that marked a turning point. Created by Silvia Venturini Fendi, who was inspired by a skinny bread loaf, the clutch became a status symbol in popular culture, imortalised in the HBO television series ""Sex and the City.""

In the early days of these house revivals, companies relied on new interest from European and American consumers, as well as the Japanese market, which became important to luxury from the 1970s when the country's economy experienced tremendous growth.

The Arnault family, which controls LVMH and its 70-strong brand portfolio, didn't start in luxury, but in real estate. Its construction business shifted into the buying and selling of property in 1976. But by 1984, patriarch Bernard Arnault, the current Chairman and Chief Executive of LVMH, had bought the company that owned both Christian Dior and Le Bon Marché. Arnault didn't create LVMH — Alain Chevalier, chief executive of Moët Hennessy, and Henry Racamier, president of Louis Vuitton did — but he gained control of the business in 1989 after buying up shares over the course of two years. It would take another decade for Arnault's playbook for reviving brands to coalesce, but he certainly took more than a few cues from Chanel, which was already on its way to building a global powerhouse.

Under Lagerfeld, Chanel devised a product pyramid still used by luxury brands today, one that takes brand heritage — which helps to earn the consumer's trust — and melds it with relevance, which helps create desirability. At the top of the pyramid is couture, followed by ready-to-wear, then shoes and handbags, then sunglasses and other entry-price accessories, then finally fragrance and makeup. (In more recent years, streetwear — sneakers and t-shirts — has also been layered in.)

Couture sold the dream, as French fashion executives like to say, while the accessories, fragrance and makeup generated the cash.

In the mid-1990s, Arnault began pairing his heritage brands with young, lauded talents, fueling a cult around his creators: John Galliano at Givenchy (1995) and then Dior (1996), Alexander McQueen at Givenchy (1996), and Marc Jacobs at Louis Vuitton (1997). He did away with the cheap licensing deals done in the 1970s when the bottom fell out of the couture business and started building up these labels again from scratch, working to create a myth and product hierarchy as strong as Chanel's. (In the early 2000s, he would also buy Italian furrier Fendi, where Karl Lagerfeld had been creative director for more than 50 years.)

At the same time, a rival was forming in Italy. The Gucci Group, brainchild of business executive Domenico De Sole and his creative partner, Tom Ford, took a slightly different approach, starting with Gucci and adding a mix of heritage and emerging houses, including Yves Saint Laurent — called ""fashion's biggest prize"" by journalist Suzy Menkes — in 1999, Alexander McQueen in 2000 (who by that time had exited LVMH) and Stella McCartney in 2001.

Two Rival Groups

In the late 1990s and early 2000s, LVMH and Kering — then known as PPR — tussled for several years over the acquisition of the Gucci Group. PPR was founded by François Pinault, a French businessman who started in the lumber trade but moved into retail by the late 1980s, buying up French department store Printemps, electronics retailer FNAC and others. The company increased its stake in Gucci Group to 42 percent in 1999, with the intention of fending off a ""creeping takeover"" by LVMH. (Over the years, Arnault has tried similar tactics with Hermès — to no avail — and won LVMH this way in the first place.) At one point, De Sole wanted to make a deal with LVMH, but Arnault rejected his proposal.

This was no quiet battle. (""One of the most bitter fights in corporate history,"" wrote Suzanne Kapner in the New York Times."") PPR played the white knight by sweeping in and making a deal that was much better for the Gucci Group than what LVMH was offering. De Sole and Ford would be given the opportunity to operate somewhat independently from the rest of the group, while a partnership with LVMH could mean the dissolution of their current operational structure.

PPR won Gucci Group for a little under $9 billion, though Ford and De Sole exited in 2004 after it fully acquired the business. But there’s no denying that Arnault’s decision to reject De Sole’s offer was a turning point for the luxury industry, paving the way for two rival groups, even if one was 20 years ahead of the other.

""Rather than putting an end to the feud between Mr. Pinault and Mr. Arnault, the deal that was signed at 3 a.m. today in Paris is merely the closing of one chapter in what analysts predict will be a long and juicy tale,"" the Times wrote. ""In addition to competing for acquisitions and design talent in the world of high fashion, the two men will still face each other in other industries, including telecommunications, publishing, art and wine.""

What LVMH and PPR now had were a stable of luxury brands, constructed around cash cows Louis Vuitton and Gucci, respectively. They were best positioned to take advantage of the opportunity ahead.

Big Luxury Takes Flight

In the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, the fashion industry underwent its biggest transformation yet. As the gap between the rich and poor increased — in 2020, 70 percent of the global population lives in countries where the wealth divide is widening — fashion brands at the high end (luxury) and low (discount and fast fashion) continuously won out over the once-dominant middle market.

Suddenly, it wasn’t just older, wealthier people buying luxury goods, but young consumers, too, whose post-recession spending habits were focused more on personal extravagances than ever before. While Generation X scoffed at the transformation of counter-culture Baby Boomers from hippies to money-driven conservatives in the 1980s, deeming it deeply uncool, Millennials and Generation Z embraced consumerism without irony. They often prioritised shopping for material goods over investing in items that were once considered the building blocks of an optimal life. Rent the house instead of taking out a mortgage, call the Uber instead of owning a car, buy the Gucci loafers.

That shift in priorities in the West, combined with the rapid acceleration of new wealth in China, has afforded luxury brands the ability to grow at lightning speed. Last year, Chinese consumers accounted for 35 percent of the market overall and 90 percent of global market growth, according to Bain. (By 2025, Chinese consumers will account for half of spending in the category.) Other growth markets — in particular, the Middle East, Korea, Russia, Brazil and India — have also played an integral role.

In 2019, Kering-owned Gucci generated €9.6 billion (about $10.5 billion) in sales, up 317 percent from €2.3 billion (about $2.5 billion) in 2009, when the group was still called PPR. While Kering has pruned its portfolio over the past decade to focus solely on personal luxury goods — fashion, accessories and jewellery — its share price increased to more than €561.60 (about $621) at the end of 2019, up 836 percent from €59.99 (about $66) in December 2009.

LVMH, which is more than three times the size of Kering, has broadened its areas of interest, buying up companies that deal in hospitality and hard luxury, including Belmond hotels and Italian jeweller Bulgari, among others. In 2019, it generated €53.7 billion (about $58.9 billion) in sales, up 214 percent from €17.1 billion (about $18.8 billion) a decade earlier. With several major acquisitions, including the integration of Dior into the main business in 2017, its share value has also increased dramatically to €404.50 (about $447) at the end of 2019, up 540 percent from 63.13 (about $70) in 2009.

Much like their customers, luxury's rich have only gotten richer, while it's harder than ever for less-well-off competitors to succeed. In 2019, 97 percent of economic profits for public fashion companies were earned by just 20 corporations — including LVMH, Kering, Hermès and Richemont — according to McKinsey and BoF's State of Fashion 2020 report.

The Little Victims

Consolidation is natural. It makes industries more efficient. The luxury industry, with its handful of major players, is in the third stage — or the ""focus"" segment — of the process, according to a 2002 Harvard Business Review article on the theory of the ""consolidation curve,"" written by three executives from consulting firm A.T. Kearney. ""This is a period of megadeals and large-scale consolidation plays,"" they said. ""The goal is to emerge as one of a small number of global industry powerhouses.""

Kering and LVMH, first movers in personal luxury goods, have used their profits to strengthen their positions.

As they’ve grown in scale, LVMH, Kering and Richemont — along with fiercely independent, family-controlled players Chanel and Hermès — have worked to gain as much control as possible over their businesses, building vertically integrated operations by buying up factories and opening new ones, but also taking more of their sales direct to customers, controlling the best real estate in high-end malls and on major retail streets. Through partnerships with top fashion and business universities, as well as competitions like the LVMH Prize, they have also built pipelines that allow them to recruit and retain top creative and executive talent.

Chanel and Hermès have managed to maintain their position versus LVMH and Kering because of the strength of their brands and their robust operations. Most importantly, they began scaling long before the two strategic groups were even formed and remain large enough to fend off unwanted interest from potential acquirers. They also both started buying suppliers and factories years ago, and Chanel — the largest luxury brand in terms of volume, with more than $11 billion in annual sales — has always directly owned its beauty and fragrance business, the biggest driver of topline revenue. Additionally, they have the backing of families that seem, for now, wholeheartedly dedicated to remaining independent.

But for most other brands, LVMH and Kering have made operating solo incredibly difficult.

Consider the case of Stella McCartney, who learned the hard way how difficult it is to be independent when she separated from Kering, her longtime financial partner, in 2018. The decision was hers, but with sales under €300 million (about $329 million), the designer's nearly 20-year-old brand was never a significant source of revenue for the group.

Less than a year after the split, she found herself in the arms of LVMH. Arnault certainly didn't need McCartney to grow his business. But he could benefit from her knowhow and authority when it came to the sustainability conversation, a burgeoning battleground in which Kering was seen to be ahead of the curve. McCartney's motivations were pragmatic. She needed the support that comes with being in a group — managing global distribution, IT, human resources and other functions — to seriously compete, and would also have the ears of the most powerful man in fashion when it comes to driving the sustainability conversation.

Antoine Arnault, the second of Bernard Arnault's children from his first marriage, insists that there is room for independent players, and that LVMH fosters their development by recruiting young designers — who sometimes go on to launch their own brands — or by sponsoring young upstarts through the LVMH Prize. Or, as with the case of Jonathan Anderson and, before him, Marc Jacobs, funding a small brand so that its designer can front one of the company's marquee brands.

If you only have three big TV channels, isn't it going to be a little boring?

“When we look at the industry as a whole, we need those younger, smaller brands to exist, to create interest into the market,” Antoine Arnault said. “If you only have three big TV channels, isn’t it going to be a little boring?”

“We buy smaller brands, we don’t only acquire brands such as Tiffany or Belmond,” he added, mentioning the McCartney partnership. “Everyone can play his part in this big game… clearly we are playing our part well.”

Kering Chief Financial Officer Jean-Marc Duplaix echoed that sentiment. “There is still room for small brands or emerging brands, but these brands have to accept that they need to grow and develop quite slowly,” he said. “They should be focused on certain categories, as the cost to expand is very high.” However, he also noted smaller brands can be a distraction for a group: “I’m not sure that the recipe can really work.”

Kering has backed away from these sorts of investments, selling its majority stake in Christopher Kane back to the designer in 2018 and instead using Artemis, the family's personal investment arm, to make smaller bets on rising labels like Giambattista Valli. (However, Kering still owns a significant minority interest in American brand Joseph Altuzarra.)

As McCartney learned, if you do want to build a global luxury fashion business, doing so without the help of one of these groups is now practically impossible. Even other groups are struggling to compete against such colossal operations.

The Big Victims

It's not just independently operated firms that are threatened by LVMH and Kering. Richemont SA, best known as the market leader in hard luxury as the owner of Cartier and Van Cleef & Arpels, is the third member of luxury's Big Three. But the cash-rich group has had difficulty keeping up with its rivals. For one, it has never been able to crack the fashion category, lacking the necessary knowledge on how to make, market and distribute soft goods. Now, its collection of fashion brands — including trend-sensitive Chloé and connoisseur-favourite Alaïa — are often pushed aside on retail floors by their stronger, more aggressive competitors despite their tremendous potential. (It's telling that Chloé was the first major label to join Van Noten's recent efforts to fight discounting.) Other major brands, including Prada, Ralph Lauren and Burberry, face similar challenges. As does Mayhoola, the Qatari-backed investment fund that owns Balmain and Valentino.

More recently, Richemont has struggled to maintain its position as the leading seller of fine jewellery, as both LVMH and Kering have made significant inroads in the category. LVMH's expected $16.2 billion acquisition of Tiffany, combined with its $5.2 billion majority stake in Bulgari in 2011, has positioned it as a real competitor in the space.

To maintain a competitive advantage, Richemont has invested in multi-brand e-commerce — where neither of its competitors have a foothold — buying Yoox Net-a-Porter Group (YNAP) in 2018 for about $3.3 billion, although that bet has yet to pay off. In the first half of its most recent fiscal year, net profit was down 61 percent in the period to €869 million (about $953 million). LMVH's own attempts at developing multi-brand e-commerce — eLuxury in 2000 and 24 Sèvres (24s) in 2017 — were unsuccessful. eLuxury shuttered in 2009, while Arnault has downplayed the group's efforts around 24s, the digital version of its famous Left Bank department store Le Bon Marché.

“We haven’t found a way to make it profitable...it is almost insignificant to us,” he said in January 2020, adding that he is “somewhat sceptical of the category overall.”

“All of them are losing money,” he said, regarding existing players including YNAP and Farfetch. “The bigger they are, the more money they lose.”

Kering, which exited a strategic partnership with YNAP in 2018, is focused on further developing its individual brand sites, which still make up a small percentage of overall sales. (Gucci’s e-commerce has operated independently since 2002.)

Post-pandemic, it seems that it will be even more challenging for the likes of Richemont to maintain their positioning within the luxury fashion ecosystem. ""In the aftermath of a crisis, resilient players can outperform rivals,"" according to BoF's recent update to The State of Fashion 2020 report. ""Power can be consolidated as previously held market share is freed up once competitors fall away.""

So, then there were two.

A Winning Playbook

There are many reasons that the industry has consolidated around LVMH and Kering. One of the most important is that they are both vigilant brand stewards and believe in strong creative leadership alongside strong executive leadership. Over the years, LVMH’s approach to brand building has remained virtually the same. Take a name — one with a history — and build on it with exciting fashion, fresh cosmetics and trendy accessories until it has achieved fashion legitimacy. Sometimes that happens more quickly than with others.

“From the beginning, Mr. Arnault was more focused,” Ortelli said.

Antoine Arnault said that while there is no exact recipe to his father’s success, there are certain fundamentals. “The first one is to respect and worship the history and core values of a brand,” he said. “Once you really understand, once you’ve dug into the heritage and archives and know it inside out, you must assemble the best teams to combine performance and creativity.”

Kering's approach is slightly different, especially with the transition of power in 2005 from founder François Pinault to his son, current Chairman and Chief Executive François-Henri Pinault, who has spent the last 15 years recalibrating the company's portfolio to focus solely on fashion and hard luxury, with a tight group of labels that almost all have the potential to become megabrands generating well above $1 billion a year.

“At the beginning, PPR was more like private equity: it was about finding opportunities in different sectors and investing in it,” Ortelli said. “Then, luxury became its expertise.”

While LVMH has a heritage-first approach —its most popular brand, Louis Vuitton, was originally a luggage maker — Kering is more exposed to fashion labels like Yves Saint Laurent and Balenciaga. Some argue this is a riskier prospect that’s more susceptible to the ebb and flow of trends.

“LVMH is overweight on heritage brands; Kering is overweight on fashion brands,” Ortelli said. “Heritage is constant, with less volatility. In fashion, you’ve got a more volatile road.”

There are exceptions to this rule: LVMH-owned Celine is not obviously trading on any fixed core heritage; just look at the stark difference between the collections designed by former creative director Phoebe Philo and current creative, artistic and image director Hedi Slimane. Neither has Givenchy in its multiple reinventions, despite its long history. Conversely, while Gucci may be under the spell of Alessandro Michele, its bestsellers — loafers, logo belts — are classics that have been available to purchase for decades in one iteration or another.

Kering does not agree with the assessment that its houses are more trend-driven.

""The brand is symbols, icons — it's never a style,"" Pinault told BoF in a 2018 interview. ""The style is the interpretation of something and if you think that the style of the brand has to be respected, you never move forward.""

Duplaix said Kering’s formula requires the creative director to evolve the brand’s style without losing sight of its heritage.

“As a corporation, we ensure there is a framework, but it’s not a science,” he said. “We start with product and creativity, to make sure there is a clear definition of the brand.

One approach isn’t necessarily better than the other. They are fundamentally grounded in the same thing: selling expensive, fashionable handbags and accessories to Chinese consumers through smart storytelling. But they each have their strengths and weaknesses. LVMH has a diverse portfolio of brands — in several categories, including travel and beauty — which means it does not need to pressure any one brand to outperform — while Kering’s ability to identify and amplify creative talent has been unmatched in recent years.

From the elevation of Michele at Gucci and, more recently, the matchups of Demna Gvasalia at Balenciaga and Daniel Lee at Bottega Veneta, Kering has made genuine cultural waves. While LVMH has done well to market its leading brands by installing Virgil Abloh at Louis Vuitton and Kim Jones at Dior, the critical and commercial success of their collections, while important, is not the dominant factor in the success of those houses.

The group's other recent attempt at tapping the zeitgeist, a fashion venture with pop star Rihanna, has yet to take off. Neither has Slimane's Celine reboot. In fact, neither group has much ability to create new brands from scratch, in part due to the inherently high capital requirements and risk involved. Instead, they've both achieved a dominant position by snapping up properties that are already well known and ensuring the right management and creative teams are in place.

There's also a difference in attitude at the groups. Kering has built a more casual corporate culture that avows transparency and a start-up mindset — with near-continual press releases about the inner workings of the company, from environmental policies to employee wellbeing — that is, ultimately, driven by the personality of François-Henri Pinault.

LVMH, by contrast, is almost monarchical. However, that's changing as the new generation of Arnaults take on leadership roles: Antoine Arnault, chief executive of Berluti and chairman of Loro Piana, is also the group's head of image, communication and environment, as well as a member of the LVMH board of directors. Then there's Delphine Arnault, director and executive vice president of Louis Vuitton, who is also a board director, Alexandre Arnault, chief executive of Rimowa and Frédéric Arnault, strategy and digital director for Tag Heuer. (The youngest heir, Jean, is still studying.)

The Black Swan

By the end of 2019, the industry’s two superpowers seemed, in many ways, invincible, making it harder and harder for others to succeed alone, or even within a less well-positioned group.

The coronavirus outbreak, in some ways, has underscored their enviable positions. Despite the crisis, both groups have the ability to continue to pay employees, to control inventory and to provide support by producing, or at least paying for, medical supplies and new hospital wards.

The main focus is not how they will survive the crisis, but which companies may make for opportunistic acquisitions, as once-independent businesses determined to go it on their own grow tired of the fight.

Several Italian firms, including Moncler and Salvatore Ferregamo, are often surfaced by analysts and bankers as potential targets.

In recent months, speculation that Prada, which has been around longer than Louis Vuitton or Chanel, would be acquired by Kering, has continued to mount. And yet Prada — which recruited Raf Simons to be mastermind Miuccia Prada's co-creative director this year — has denied it's for sale. (Lorenzo Bertelli, the son of Prada and her husband, Co-Chief Executive Patrizio Bertelli, is being groomed to take over.) Kering declined to comment on Prada. But the possibility remains, and would be a smart deal for both companies, said Elsa Berry, managing director and founder of Vendôme Global Partners, a New York-based strategic mergers and acquisitions advisory firm.

“I think many, many independent brands will realise after this global crisis that it is more and more challenging to remain so,” she said. “Unlike Moncler, where the valuation is high and future growth may be less significant and certainly where Kering’s knowhow will be less needed and less relevant, Prada would be an ideal fit for both sides. Kering can patiently grow and add value, and for Prada shareholders, they get, with Kering, a solid track record.”

However unlikely, a Prada acquisition would be a boon. Over the years, Kering has made deals in other categories with varying success — including the acquisition of Puma and the purchase of Bocheron — but not in the group's core category, fashion. Pinault has said he is looking for a globally recognised, sizable brand that will not directly compete with any of the brands currently in the portfolio. (Versace, once a hot prospect, was acquired by Capri in 2018 for more than $2 billion, a price Kering believed to be too high.)

LVMH, too, is focused on making big acquisitions, like the Tiffany deal, which was decades in the making and is expected to take place even with pandemic-related setbacks. While LVMH seems dedicated to continue to develop smaller brands and new brands — its relaunch of Patou, and the FENTY by Rihanna fashion brand — its track record in that department remains unproven. Gone are the days of scooping up a $200-million-revenue business in the hopes of scaling it quickly to $1 billion. Now, they're looking for $1 billion companies they can scale to $10 billion.

The Future

The pandemic may very well bring new challenges to the luxury sector at large, but particularly to those who dominate it, and who might be reluctant to change when the rest of the industry seems to be hungry for a reset. For every Woolworth, there’s a Walmart, and for every Walmart, there’s an Amazon.

LVMH and Kering are both extremely reliant on Chinese customers — and that dependency is likely to increase as China’s economy continues to grow, albeit much more slowly, with many analysts estimating that it will be the least affected region in the ensuing economic crisis.

While that’s not necessarily a bad thing — even as spending slows in the region — it may become harder to win over those consumers as their consumption habits change, the market rapidly matures and shoppers start to care less about certain old-fashioned status symbols that have been adopted by the masses. They will begin to obsess less over failsafe blockbuster brands and more over new prospects. China may even begin to create its own global luxury labels, something it has failed at in the past.

The luxury industry is also far too reliant on driving up prices of individual items to increase profits. (Today, handbags often cost well over $3,000 a piece. Shoes, $1,000 a pair.) Rising prices of goods were fine when the economy was minting new millionaires, and billionaires, at a steady pace. (China added 182 billionaires over the year ending January 2020, according to the Hurun Global Rich List.)

But now, as the coronavirus has wiped out trillions of dollars in wealth, priorities — and consumer behaviour — may change in the medium term. What makes a handbag, or a pair of sneakers, worth it? As top brands including Chanel and Louis Vuitton begin instituting price increases in order to make up for lagging lockdown-era sales — inspiring consumers to queue up to buy the products before the hikes were put in place — the limit is going to be tested.

One looming threat is luxury's lack of agency over its own secondary market. Consumers are already buying luxury products secondhand from the likes of The RealReal and Vestiaire Collective, and even renting them from US-based service Rent the Runway, showing that ownership is less important to the current generation of would-be luxury shoppers. There is an argument that LVMH and Kering, which tend to take a wait-and-see approach to new models before trying them out themselves, should already own this stage of the product lifecycle.

And while consumers will always find ways to express themselves through fashion, the specifics will change. They may prefer customised, made-to-order products. Or new categories: streetwear instead of gowns and protective face masks instead of shoes. Or they may simply choose to buy fewer things. High fashion is already fairly homogenised, and many argue it will only become more boring if just a few companies are producing just about everything.

In order for these giants to continue to dominate this next wave of consolidation, they will need to react quickly to the changes brought on by the pandemic, or risk the disruption they’ve managed to stave off thus far. For instance, LVMH is only now putting proper focus on e-commerce, a channel that will account for 30 percent of sales of personal luxury goods by 2025, according to Bain. (And that’s not considering the amount of purchasing done in-store that begins online.)

Perhaps most importantly, both LVMH and Kering’s models are predicated on the idea that wealthy people will continue consuming at a rapid pace. “It is easy to get carried away during a tragedy,” Bernstein analyst Luca Solca wrote in a recent note. “The legitimate aspiration to social elevation, being better off and having more, will persevere.” And yet, “On the back of the sharp recession to come... we do expect consumers will become more conservative,” Solca added.

This battle is far from over.

Beyond their patronage initiatives, LVMH and its Maisons have since the early 2000s actively promoted a unique blend of art and architecture that transforms the customer experience and shares this passion for beautiful objects with the largest possible number of people.

Artworks at flagships, stores and other public spaces add an extra dimension, fitting naturally thanks to carefully curated affinities, a perfect echo to uncompromising creativity. The art in our retail spaces sparks emotion while instantly transmitting the values of the Maison.

Art de vivre and art

A monumental sculpture, a copper arc rises from the lagoon with metallic arms that reflect the rays of the sun. At the Cheval Blanc Rhandeli hotel in the Maldives, artist Vincent Beaurin plays with water and light in both the rooms and the landscape. Cheval Blanc, the hospitality brand of LVMH, transforms a journey into multifaceted invitations. Its unforgettable Maisons and horizons offer escapades where guests discover a unique collection of contemporary artworks. As captivating expressions of unique experiences, these singular creations are inseparable from an exceptional art de vivre.

At Cheval Blanc Courchevel, Bruno Peinado’s mirrored Trojan Horse, Xavier Veilhan’s bear, seemingly sculpted from snow, or the immense pearl necklace by Jean-Michel Othoniel all open fresh poetic perspectives for guests. The soon to reopen Cheval Blanc Saint Barth Isle de France will unveil the Constellation of Pegasus, a giant mobile by Jean-Michel Othoniel set in the heart of a tropical paradise conceived by garden designer Madison Cox.

LVMH welcomes creativity to the center of its different universes not simply to kindle sensations, but also to explore meaning. There is an osmosis between excellence and innovative expressiveness. When Hennessy invited the art collective Marshmallow Laser Feast to create an installation for its “Founder’s Cellar” in Cognac – where its most precious eaux-de-vie are carefully stored – the idea was to pay tribute to the sublime, inspired skill and almost spiritual dedication of the master blender. Entitled “The Quest”, an amazing galaxy of almost immaterial crystals is intersected by light and enriched by sound, a celebration of the pinnacle of excellence that can be reached when prodigious nature and virtuoso artisans meet…

Shopping as artistic journey

As the virtual world continues to permeate daily lives, the desire – indeed the need – to reconnect with simple pleasures becomes stronger than ever. Pleasures such as wandering through a store, being surprised, or discovering some inner enrichment. The stores of LVMH Maisons seek to elevate reality, to connect with true emotions and encourage time for contemplation.

Guerlain stores, for instance, have always been designed as truly unique showcases thanks to the artists and artisans who craft them. In the 1930s, Jean-Michel Frank, Christian Bérard and Alberto Giacometti all applied their talents to create décors for the Guerlain boutique on Place Vendôme, as well as for the newly opened Institut des Champs-Élysées. Guerlain boutiques continue to cultivate their strong ties with art today. The Passy boutique, which recently reopened at 93, rue de Passy, welcomes “L’Abeille” (The Bee) by Brazilian photographer Vik Muniz, was well as an exquisitely soft and refined interpretation of the orchid by Caroline Perrin and a series entitled “Ashkal” by Lebanese designer Richard Yasmine.

Support for talented artists and artisans is also an integral part of the Guerlain identity. For the past 12 years, the Maison’s most emblematic store at 68, Champs-Elysées has taken part in the “private itinerary” tour during the FIAC international art fair. For the 2018 edition, an exhibition with the unambiguous title “Future Anterior” has been conceived by curator Caroline Mensensee, proposing a novel perspective in resonance with Guerlain’s 190th anniversary. This anniversary is being celebrated throughout the year, including a tribute to photography, which was invented the same era Guerlain was founded. Over the summer, the Guerlain boutique featured a series of photos commissioned from eight photographers, each illustrating a period in the history of the Maison alongside the corresponding state of the art in photographic techniques. In addition to sharing singular perspectives of the Maison, events such as these are a tremendous springboard that boosts recognition for both emerging and established artists by giving them exposure to a broad public.

Distinctive exhibition spaces at stores sometimes really push boundaries, as at Le Bon Marché, now well-known for its regular art events. In winter 2017 the celebrated department store gave carte blanche to Argentine artist Leandro Erlich, who revisited the architecture with trompe-l’œil illusions, creating an itinerary like a waking dream as visitors meander through the store. This masterful immersion echoes installations in previous years by Ai Weiwei and Chiharu Shiota.

The store as cultural destination

When the store environment and products transcend reality, shopping becomes an ideal chance to discover new worlds.

Le Bon Marché began acquiring its collection of contemporary art 30 years ago and displays the works on every floor of the store. Paintings, sculptures, drawings and photos have all been selected for their intrinsic beauty, evocative force and the questions and emotions they inspire. Unexplored territories await visitors at every turn…

The Bulgari “New Curiosity Shop” is a cultural attraction in itself. A future-facing version of its forerunner at Bulgari’s historic Via Condotti store, inaugurated in 1905, the new space created by architect Peter Marino celebrates the art of wonder. The shop brings together a playful array of opposites, antique pieces and new models against the backdrop of morphing and sometimes extravagant decors. On display through fall 2018, wax sculptures by Chilean artist David Aaron Angeli are like sinuous, mysterious shadows, resonating with the snake theme that has long inspired iconic Bulgari creations.

Perpetuating history without slipping into nostalgia is about establishing bridges between the past and the future, creating something new by exploring styles and eras. This is an integral part of Louis Vuitton’s DNA, and one reason the Maison has always forged close collaborations with artists. One particularly striking recent example is the line of bags signed Jeff Koons, always delighted to blur the lines between art, craftsmanship, history and modernity, raising questions with a touch of sly humor. This added value inspired by tradition is also expressed in the new Maison Louis Vuitton Vendôme on Place Vendôme. The recently inaugurated Maison brings together two 18th century private mansions, located just a stone’s throw from the very first store opened by the trunkmaker Louis Vuitton himself in 1854. Among the legendary models and contemporary collections now on display are creations signed by Stephen Sprouse, Rashid Rana, Farhad Moshiri, Annie Morris, Kimiko Fujimura and others.

With creative audacity, LVMH and its Maisons continually renew the art of retail while at the same time renewing the scope for artistic expression. they are committed to eliminating barriers, pushing limits and encouraging an ongoing dialogue between artists and the public to offer everyone and especially each individual a chance to experience the impact of powerful emotions wherever they might be, and whenever they encounter compelling art.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9987335801124573}",neutral,0.9987335801124573,0

"How luxury retailers like Gucci, Stella McCartney and LVMH are embracing digital transformation - Technology Magazine","Sun, 17 May 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikAFodHRwczovL3RlY2hub2xvZ3ltYWdhemluZS5jb20vYWktYW5kLW1hY2hpbmUtbGVhcm5pbmcvaG93LWx1eHVyeS1yZXRhaWxlcnMtZ3VjY2ktc3RlbGxhLW1jY2FydG5leS1hbmQtbHZtaC1hcmUtZW1icmFjaW5nLWRpZ2l0YWwtdHJhbnNmb3JtYXRpb27SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Luxury retailers often rely on the exclusivity of their brands to generate sales. Names like “Louis Vuitton” and “Gucci” evokes a certain sense of craftsmanship and in the eyes of many brands, purchasing luxury goods should be about an unrivaled in-store experience.

The problem for this business model is that more wealthy customers are doing their shopping online. In fact, a recent report by McKinsey forecasts that nearly one fifth of luxury sales will take place online by 2025. The same report points out how nearly 80% of luxury sales today are “digitally influenced”, meaning that consumers hit one or more digital touchpoints in their luxury shopping journeys.

As the competition heats up, it seems that luxury retailers have no choice but to embrace digital transformation. This are how some brands are taking on this challenge.

Gucci

Led by creative director Alessandro Michele, the reinvention of Gucci is a blockbuster success story. This is partially thanks to its revamped digital strategy. To drive customer satisfaction, the Italian retailer has built a Facebook-integrated chat bot and it also launched scannable adverts. Elsewhere, for its spring 2018 campaign, Gucci developed in-store augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) installations, which allowed consumers to become a part of the campaign. So far, this digital transformation has proven to be a roaring success. Speaking to CNBC , Francois-Henri Pinault, CEO and Chairman of parent firm Kering, noted that about 50% of Gucci’s sales now come from millennials - a demographic of 35-year-olds and younger which many luxury brands are struggling to capture.

Neiman Marcus

Neiman Marcus has quickly earned a reputation for its digitally-savvy approach, winning the 2017 IRT Retailer Innovation Award. In 2012, the luxury department store line launched the Neiman Marcus Innovation Lab (iLab), spearheading the evaluation, design, testing and piloting of new technologies and applications for luxury retail. One such technology from the lab was Memory Mirrors. Composed of giant video screens and cameras, this interactive mirror enables shoppers to see outfits from 360-degrees, and compare clothing options side-by-side. The technology – which has been rolled out to most of the store’s 44 locations – also remembers what customers have already tried on. In a similar vein, Neiman Marcus also rolled out an AR beauty tool that allows customers to try on makeup virtually when looking in mirrors. Elsewhere, the company launched ‘Snap Find Shop’: if you see an item you like, you can take a photo and the Neiman Marcus app will use image recognition to deliver comparable products.

LVMH

French conglomerate LVMH, which counts Louis Vuitton, Dior and Sephora among its brands, is making waves with its digital strategy. Last year, the firm created an accelerator programme at the Station F startup campus in Paris. Welcoming around 50 international startups, the accelerator aims to “support the Group’s key issues around the durability of raw materials, the reinvention of customer experience and stores, and the production chain, as well as the security of products”. Through LVMH’s start-up accelerator, one participating firm developed an artificial intelligence solution which consumers can use to detect counterfeit products with their smartphones.

Stella McCartney

Digital transformation isn’t just transforming how luxury items are sold, it’s also impacting production and supply chain. For instance, Stella McCartney is harnessing technology to push for eco-futuristic fashion, honing in on footwear. Using cutting-edge technology, the luxury brand launched a sustainable ‘Loop’ sneaker that is glue-free and entirely recyclable. “The sneaker’s design is the result of pioneering innovation and technology developed over 18 months,” the brand wrote in a blog post. A study from Nielsen highlighted that 73% of millennial respondents were willing to spend more on a product if it comes from a sustainable or socially conscious brand. As more and more luxury brands pivot towards sustainable and conscious business models, digital transformation is proving to be an essential task.

Bernard Arnault Isn’t Letting a $30 Billion Loss Derail His Plans for LVMH - Robb Report,"Fri, 08 May 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vcm9iYnJlcG9ydC5jb20vc3R5bGUvZmFzaGlvbi9iZXJuYXJkLWFybmF1bHQtcGxhbnMtYnJpbmctYmFjay1sdm1oLWNvcm9uYXZpcnVzLTI5MTk4MDgv0gFjaHR0cHM6Ly9yb2JicmVwb3J0LmNvbS9zdHlsZS9mYXNoaW9uL2Jlcm5hcmQtYXJuYXVsdC1wbGFucy1icmluZy1iYWNrLWx2bWgtY29yb25hdmlydXMtMjkxOTgwOC9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Bernard Arnault may be down $30 million, but he’s not letting the pandemic deter his plans.

The famous owner of luxury conglomerate LVMH was hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic––that $30 billion figure is how much his personal net worth declined as LVMH stock plunged by 19 percent this year. According to Bloomberg Billionaires Index, Arnault lost more money than any other individual in the world during this period and about as much as Amazon’s Jeff Bezos gained.

But Arnault has garnered a reputation as an aggressive businessman who historically does well under pressure, so it’s no surprise that he is hatching plans to ensure that LVMH comes back stronger than ever. He first shocked the luxury world with his hardball tactics (something often derisively branded as deeply American by his French compatriots) in the ’80s and has continued to use economic downturns to his advantage. Arnault took the recession in the 2000s as a means to force Prada out as shareholders of Fendi, which he had recently acquired at the time.

“You could divide the world’s top billionaires into highly successful risk managers and highly successful risk takers; Arnault is a highly successful risk taker,” Pauline Brown, the former chairman of LVMH Americas, told Bloomberg. “When he feels momentum and long-term potential, he uses the resources he has to go after it aggressively.”

The biggest bet will be LVMH’s acquisition of American fine jeweler Tiffany & Co. for which the company paid $16 billion––the largest acquisition in luxury history and a move that briefly made Arnault the world’s richest person. LVMH has vehemently denied it has any intention to renegotiate the price or walk away from the agreement. “We are very much long-term oriented,” LVMH chief financial officer Jean-Jacques Guiony told Bloomberg. “In a crisis a lot of people say things will never be the same, but we are still confident.”

WATCH

Even though tourism is among the economy’s most devastated industries, Arnault is plowing ahead with the reopening of Paris’s Samaritaine department store as both a luxury hotel and a center of duty-free shopping. After temporarily shutting down, construction on the $1 billion project has resumed. An equally extravagant Cheval Blanc hotel on Los Angeles’ Rodeo Drive is likewise in the works. The same investment-driven mindset is informing the conglomerate’s stable of heritage fashion labels, as it is actively recruiting a new head designer for Givenchy and retooling the brand in time for a September runway show.

Whether Arnault’s plans for LVMH yield much-need profits is an open question—and one that may not be answered until the Covid-19 crisis is over. In the meantime, the CEO will have to take some solace in the knowledge that LVMH is faring no worse than its competitors. Shares for chief rivals Kering and Richemont have fallen by 25 percent and 30 percent, respectively, since the pandemic has started.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.5366347432136536}",neutral,0.5366347432136536,0
"Kering and LVMH choices on layoffs prove sensitive in France, not in Italy - LaConceria | Il portale dell'area pelle - laconceria.it","Mon, 11 May 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxhY29uY2VyaWEuaXQvZW4vbmV3cy9rZXJpbmctYW5kLWx2bWgtY2hvaWNlcy1vbi1sYXlvZmZzLXByb3ZlLXNlbnNpdGl2ZS1pbi1mcmFuY2Utbm90LWluLWl0YWx5L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"They have been proving sensitive to France’s financial problems, not to Italy’s ones though. In fact, in their home country both Kering and LVMH eventually decided not to resort to social security cushions: they did not want to overburden French public accounts with additional expenses. Conversely, in Italy, where they currently run a deeply rooted marketing and (most of all) manufacturing activity, the French luxury giants did not prove to pay such close attention as they did in France.

In fact, in Italy they reportedly took advantage of financial measures implemented by Italian government through a decree, namely the decretoCuraItalia, to soften and overcome difficulties caused by Coronavirus outbreak. The Post Internazionale (TPI) reported the news: around 5,000 Kering Italian workers, employed for retail and production, will benefit from unemployment insurance. As regards LVMH group, instead, there are about 1,000 of them.

They care about France, not about Italy

Their choice is fully legitimate of course. The point made by TPI rather concerns a political choice, somehow, so to speak. The two groups proved very sensitive to France’s public financial situation: why did not they act alike in Italy? For example, “all of the brands controlled by Kering group, except Ginori, are going to benefit from wages guarantee funds or additional funds for salary compensation – recapped Luca De Zolt (Filcams CGIL), while speaking to TPI –, because some of them have less than fifty employees.

As for the latter, the company is going to pay in advance money remuneration usually provided by Italy’s social security service. On the other hand, as regards workers who benefit from wages guarantee funds, the company will be paying in advance their thirteenth and fourteenth monthly salary for the first nine weeks, which have almost finished, at this point. However, companies are going to complete, for all of them, the whole (100%) of the payment due”.

What they opted for in France

To tell the truth, we cannot consider such French generosity to be fully genuine after all. In fact, as reported by the Financial Times at the beginning of April, the two holding companies, which are in control over multimillionaire fashion brands, such as Louis Vuitton and Gucci, had started negotiations with trade unions in France as well. The aim of talks was to possibly resort to social security cushions. What did they do then? Well, they focused their attention on a name and image issue.

The chief leaders of the two groups are Bernard Arnault and François-Henri Pinault, who are respectively placing third and twenty-seventh in the annual ranking of the wealthiest people in the world, compiled and published by Forbes. Well, considering their position, if they had taken advantage of any social aid, they would have antagonized the public opinion. On top of that, competitors played their cards as well: when Hermès and Chanel announced they would not resort to wages guarantee funds, at that point LVMH and Kering were compelled to act likewise. In France, at least.

Why Luxury Brands Are Raising Prices in a Pandemic - The Business of Fashion,"Fri, 15 May 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzb2ZmYXNoaW9uLmNvbS9icmllZmluZ3MvbHV4dXJ5L3doeS1sdXh1cnktYnJhbmRzLWFyZS1yYWlzaW5nLXByaWNlcy1pbi1hLXBhbmRlbWljL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Hello BoF Professionals, your exclusive 'This Week in Fashion' briefing is ready, with members-only analysis on the key topic of the week and a digest of the week's top news.

The Covid-19 pandemic has savaged the global economy and crushed consumer demand for luxury goods. Now may not seem like the best time to raise prices on expensive handbags. But that’s exactly what top-tier luxury brands Chanel and Louis Vuitton are doing.

Louis Vuitton raised prices by 3 percent in March and another 5 percent in April. This week, Chanel was even bolder, raising prices on its iconic 11.12 and 2.55 handbags, as well as its Boy, Gabrielle and Chanel 19 bags, and certain small leather goods, by between 5 percent and 17 percent. The percentage increases reflect prices in France, but the hikes are being phased in globally.

As the news leaked, thousands of shoppers in Asia flocked to Chanel stores to snap up handbags before the price increases take effect in their markets in what effectively became a sort of reverse sale. Lines formed outside Chanel boutiques in Shanghai, Hangzhou, Guangzhou and Beijing. In Seoul, the queues were so long that the municipal government is considering an order to suspend Chanel from doing business in the city, citing fears over Covid-19 infections.

Luxury prices have been rising for decades, growing at more than twice the rate of inflation. It's common to see one to two price hikes per year, typically under 10 percent, reflecting everything from the rising costs of raw materials and labour to the customer's growing willingness to pay. But the amount of Chanel's latest increase raised eyebrows.

“Like all major luxury brands, we regularly adjust our prices to take changes in our production costs and raw material prices, as well as exchange rate fluctuations, into account,” said a spokesperson for Chanel. “In the current environment, the price of certain raw materials, which were already difficult to procure due to the quality we require, has increased again.”

The pandemic has no doubt disrupted the luxury supply chain and product shortages may even be a factor. But raising prices will also help Chanel and its competitors to pad margins and cushion the bottom-line impact of lower overall sales volumes as they try to make up for revenue lost during weeks of forced store closures. Louis Vuitton declined to comment.

It's a very difficult time for the luxury business. According to Bain, sales are expected to sink by up to 35 percent this year. Consumer demand remains extremely low in Europe and the United States, where retail is slowly sputtering to life again. But Asian spending is bouncing back, if not to pre-pandemic levels, then at least enough to signal opportunity.

Chinese consumers drove 90 percent of global luxury growth last year and, in its first quarter results, Louis Vuitton owner LVMH, a bellwether for the sector, reported a sharp rise in Mainland China sales, starting in mid-March as stores in the country began re-opening. Raising prices will surely help brands like Chanel and Louis Vuitton make the most of the momentum.

Raising prices will help Chanel and its competitors to pad margins and cushion the bottom-line impact of lower overall sales volumes.

Of course, Chinese consumers historically do only about one-third to half of their luxury spending at home, preferring to buy while travelling outside Mainland China, both to benefit from the symbolic value of buying European luxury goods in the continent's fashion capitals and capitalise on persistent price differentials. And with overseas sales effectively at zero, Mainland sales would roughly have to double or triple to make up for lost revenue.

Chanel said its price hikes were in line with the “harmonisation” strategy it adopted in 2015 to better equalise prices across markets. “These adjustments are made while ensuring that we avoid excessive price differentials between countries,” said the spokesperson for the brand. “We believe it is essential not to penalise our clients on the basis of geographic considerations.”

Louis Vuitton has also made attempts to minimise price differentials. Last April, when the Chinese government lowered its VAT on luxury goods from 16 percent to 13 percent, the brand responded by lowering prices in China by 3 percent. In a statement at the time, it said it was ""fully supportive of the Chinese government's ongoing efforts to narrow the price gap between China and overseas.""

But the recent price hikes are global and do not seem calculated to drive the repatriation of Chinese spend. Nonetheless, Asian consumers appear likely to stomach the increases, at least when it comes to Chanel and Louis Vuitton, such is the pricing power of top-tier brands.

The strategy is probably not replicable for brands further down the food chain, however. Indeed, it serves to further differentiate the true luxury credentials of brands like Chanel from competitors, who may have a hard time increasing prices in Asian markets where some consumers may be feeling squeezed by the economic contraction and tired of paying more.

According to market reports, Gucci and Prada, which may not be seeing as strong a recovery in China, are playing a more cautious game on pricing, with no plans for hikes. The ailing British label Mulberry is even going in the other direction, lowering its prices by up to 20 percent in some Asian markets in an attempt to entice consumers to buy. Whether anyone else has the guts to put their brand credentials to the test and implement Chanel-style price hikes remains to be seen.

Bankruptcy court approves Neiman Marcus' plea to access financing. The luxury department store arranged $675 million of debtor-in-possession financing to aid operations while it attempts to reorganise. Neiman Marcus plans to hand over control to creditors in exchange cancelling of $4 billion of debt. Neiman Marcus' debt totals about $5 billion. The company hopes to come out of Chapter 11 proceedings in autumn with a $750 million package from creditors that provided its initial bankruptcy loan.

Designers and CEOs rally to rewire the fashion industry. A group of independent designers have with the help of BoF put forward a proposal with the aim of reorganising the fashion calendar to suit the rhythm of the natural seasons as most of the world experiences them. The proposal also includes a proposition that the industry reposition fashion shows to better engage consumers as well as a bid to stop markdown periods and mid-season sales.

Dries Van Noten proposes reset to fashion's deliveries and discounting calendar. A group of designers and retailers, led by the Belgian designer, wants the industry to realign fashion deliveries with real-world seasons and stop early discounting. The group proposes that the Autumn/Winter season is moved to August through January and Spring/Summer to February through July. They also urge retailers to push end-of-season discounting to January and July, which could result in abandoning high profile markdown days like Black Friday, Cyber Monday and Singles Day.

British Fashion Council aims to raise £50 million for struggling designers. The BFC has announced its first 37 Foundation Fashion Fund recipients, including Charles Jeffrey, Bethany Williams and Richard Malone, who will receive the first £1 million round of funding. Each brand will get up to £50,000 to help weather the Covid-19 crisis and will be offered access to business support and mentoring from the BFC's network. The organisation also urges the British government and industry leaders to extend a helping hand to smaller brands hard hit by the crisis.

Richemont reports 67 percent drop in annual profit. Over the past three months sales have fallen by 18 percent as a result of widespread store closures and low consumer confidence. Chairman Johann Rupert estimates up to three years of grave economic impact of Covid-19 on the Swiss luxury group. As a result, Richemont has reduced production at its watch and jewellery plants to lower its costs.

Neiman Marcus creditor calls for deal with Saks Fifth Avenue. A letter by the creditor suggests that combining the two luxury retailers would create between $2.8 billion and $4.7 billion of value. Neiman Marcus has also been advised to use bankruptcy procedures to close 22 stores in overlapping locations, which would boost both retailers' earnings. The two department store chains have flirted with the idea of merging before in 2017 and once again a year later.

Under Armour's quarterly revenue drops 23 percent. The sportswear brand reported a net loss of $589.7 million the first quarter ended March 31, compared with a profit of $22.5 million a year earlier. As a result of the Covid-19 crisis, the company has so far been forced to temporarily lay off about 600 staff at its US-based distribution centres, prolong store closures and withdraw its annual forecast. These steps have significantly disrupted Under Armour's typical business operations.

J.C. Penney talks with KKR, Ares and Sixth Street Partners lenders on bankruptcy loan. The plan would be included in a Chapter 11 court filing that could come next week, according to people with knowledge of the matter. The lender group, which also includes Apollo Global Management Inc., could reduce the department store chain's debt in exchange for control of the company. They could also provide as much as $500 million to help J.C. Penney stay in business during the bankruptcy process.

THE BUSINESS OF BEAUTY

Coty to sell majority stake in hair businesses to investment firm KKR in $4.3 billion deal. The cosmetics maker said it would receive about $3 billion in cash from the divestment. The deal includes Wella and Clairol brands as well as OPI and Ghd brands. Coty also said third-quarter sales dropped 23 percent to $1.53 billion in the three months ended March 31.

L'Oréal cancels 10.4 percent dividend increase. The beauty group will instead stick to the same payout per share of €3.80 ($4.06) it made in 2019. The beauty group's revenues fell 4.8 percent on a comparable basis in the first quarter as a result of extensive store closures linked to the outbreak, but it nonetheless remains hopeful about a consumer bounce back later this year, likely led by China.

DELHI, India — ""If my son becomes an artisan like me he won't have the money or the respect that he would have even if he were just a mechanic,"" says Rajab Khan, a master artisan from Uttar Pradesh, a state in northern India that flanks the nation's capital. Each month he sends money home to his elderly parents, wife, and his children aged between nine and fifteen.

For over twenty years Khan has been embroidering some of the most exquisite pieces that grace the catwalks and boutiques of global luxury brands. It has taken a lifetime to hone his superior craft, but all the precious skills he acquired could simply vanish, instead of being passed on to the next generation.

“I don’t know if I want my son to be an artisan like me. I never had the chance to study properly. I want him to speak English and get a good education,” he adds.

While millions of factory workers across India toil for companies hired by international fast-fashion brands, there are also couture-level artisans like Khan, who are essential to European luxury brands that employ them indirectly through local export ateliers.

It is telling that in India, even while craft is venerated as a symbol of national pride, Indian artisans remain socially marginalised and poorly paid.

“Many young people don’t want to follow in their parents’ footsteps, seeing craft as having less status and social mobility than…an Uber driver. Why would so many skilled workers want to leave unless there was an inherent lack of recognition and respect for their work?"" asks Ritu Sethi, chairperson at the Craft Revival Trust, a not-for-profit NGO established in 1999.

Undervaluing artisans is a problem not limited to India, but it is endemic in the country because of its hereditary caste system, reinforced by the pernicious marginalisation of its large Muslim minority – many of whom work in the apparel and textiles industry.

Karishma Swali, managing director of family-run company Chanakya, which produces for brands including Christian Dior, Gucci and Valentino, reminds us why artisans at her Mumbai-based export house are working for western brands in the first place. ""Europe has high degrees of creativity, but these days fewer and fewer possess craftsmanship knowledge,"" she says.

Europe has high degrees of creativity, but these days fewer and fewer possess craftsmanship knowledge.

Of course, the fact that labour costs in India are so much lower than those in Europe also helps keep luxury brands motivated to produce here. It is estimated that luxury embroidery done in India would cost 10-15 times more to produce in Europe. Given their increasing reliance upon India for surface ornamentation like embroidery and other embellishments, it would make good business sense for brands to safeguard this essential industry so that it will continue to attract new generations of artisans.

""There are three motivating factors [for luxury brands],"" says Ashok Som, Professor and Global Strategy Director of the EMILUX programme at France's ESSEC Business School. ""Diversifying their supply chain, global sustainability issues haunting the luxury brands vis-à-vis high ethical considerations that the brands [aim to] represent, and a shortage of highly-skilled craftsmen globally.""

Whatever their motivations – enlightened self-interest, pressure from consumers and shareholders or an emotionless cost-benefit analysis – luxury industry leaders have endeavoured to make some progress supporting artisans in India. Whether their initiatives are sufficiently fair and effective, however, is another matter.

Trial and Error

Although luxury brands have been using artisans' highly prized skills for years, until recently Indian artisans have been completely airbrushed out of the supply chain. But following a January exposé by BoF, The New York Times laid bare more of the problems inherent to this secretive industry in a March investigative report.

The latter exposed a secretive pact called Utthan (Sanskrit for ""upliftment""), with founding members including Kering and LVMH. The pact, launched in 2016, set out to formalise embroidery workers' employment terms by implementing a standard minimum wage, health and safety measures, maximum working hours as well as mandatory provident fund and Employee’s State Insurance (ESIC) contributions.

Signatory brands committed to only work with Utthan-compliant factories by the second year, and several Indian export atelier firms in Mumbai who serve as suppliers and production managers for luxury brands also joined. UK-based consultancy Impactt was brought in to implement and monitor the measures suggested.

However, according to the report, implementation of the pact over the three years of its initial phase was piecemeal, with insufficient resources and oversight to ensure its success. Brands paid nothing towards the cost of implementing factory renovations for the health-and-safety measures suggested by the pact. Instead, suppliers spent their own money with no guarantee of future business. The report concluded that sub-contracting, low wages, poor working conditions and even crackdowns on collective worker organisation remained endemic.

In response to BoF’s requests for comment, both Kering and LVMH acknowledged problems with implementation of the pact and emphasised their ongoing commitment to resolving them. A Kering spokesperson also reiterated the company's earlier commitments to Indian artisans and its plan to open its own embroidery workshop in India, emphasising however that this is a long-term plan.

I know many embroiderers working for other factories who have not been paid. Many have returned to their villages. Who knows when they'll be able to return.

The group’s statement reads in part: “The goal is not to cover 100 percent of Kering brands’ hand embroidery works, but rather to get a direct and concrete knowledge of hand embroidery – from both a business and a technical perspective – and thus, also be able to better collaborate with external suppliers as regards working conditions, wages, prices and contractual commitments.”

LVMH responded by offering a statement which clarified its intentions and conceded there is room for improvement. “For more than two years, LVMH has been committed with determination to constantly support the embroidery craftsmen based in Mumbai so that they benefit from better working and living conditions as well as a better recognition of their excellent craftsmanship. This is the meaning of our investment in the Utthan project,” the statement read, in part. “We still have a lot to do collectively, which is why we will significantly strengthen our participation in this project in order to accelerate these changes.”

The group contends that it is currently exploring several options in a bid to make good on its commitment to Indian artisans by tightening and strengthening control over its supply chain, such as creating its own workshop or taking a stake in one of its suppliers.

LVMH also explained its stance in relation to the COVID-19 outbreak in India. “We are currently working with all Utthan members to financially support the embroiderers by maintaining a remuneration while the activity starts again.”

In this regard, it appears that some highly-skilled artisans are in a better position than their less skilled compatriots – millions of whom are now facing destitution after work dried up or they were forced to flee back to their hometowns in a mass exodus after the lockdown was announced with only four hours warning on March 23 by India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

Nevertheless, even for those who are comparatively lucky, the current crisis has been painful. “Things have been very hard; everyone is very, very scared,” says luxury embroiderer Rajab Khan, who out of concern for job security asked not to disclose which export atelier or brands he works for.

“It was too far to reach home [his village is 1,500 km away]. When the lockdown happened we thought it would just be for two weeks, so I decided to stay in Mumbai. We were given salary in advance for April, but I know many embroiderers working for other factories who have not been paid. Many have returned to their villages. Who knows when they’ll be able to return.”

“I talk to my family on WhatsApp every day. My children cry and miss me and tell me you must wear a mask and to be careful. I stay in a small place with other embroiderers here in Mumbai. We were shut inside with not much to do but wait and worry. We passed the time with much disturbance in our minds. We prayed together,” he adds.

Khan finally returned to work in the first week of May. “There is a lot of fear but we are happy to be working again. There are less people there now and we’re all worried about what will happen; we hope there will be enough work for us this year.”

The longer-term future for artisans like Khan remains highly uncertain. Given the decline in sales expected to hit the luxury industry this year, it is highly unlikely that brands will be commissioning Indian suppliers to produce as many intricately embroidered pieces as they usually do. For unfortunate artisans who are selected to be laid off, the consequences can be dire.

Putting the current crisis to one side, recent steps made by the luxury industry to improve the welfare of its artisans are of course welcome. But the earlier failures of Utthan and the deeply embedded structural inequality of Indian society demonstrate that making progress will not be easy. What’s more, luxury brands must keep in mind that there are a number of other complex issues to navigate if they want to clean up their supply chains.

Misleading Provenance

Given loopholes in country of origin laws, European brands are able to indicate “Made in France” or “Made in Italy” provenance for fashion items which in reality have only been finished in Europe.

As Sethi says, “there is a crucial difference between protecting information regarding supplier sources or lying about provenance.”

Being transparent about where items were embellished, perhaps even creating a special mark to designate embroidery done in India, would begin to create awareness among international luxury consumers and lead to the increased recognition and respect that Indian artisans deserve.

Som from ESSEC warns that aligning business motivations with social consciousness is not always straightforward. “The conditions have to be linked with the storytelling part of the brand and has to be integral to the brand DNA. The real question is whether the French and Italian luxury brands are ready yet to promote the work of [artisans from outside Europe in sourcing countries like India],” he explains.

There is a crucial difference between protecting information regarding supplier sources or lying about provenance.

Some are willing to be more transparent than others. Since 2007, Hermès has put a “Made in India” label on its range of “Les Exceptionnelles” embroidered silk scarves and plaid cashmere throws. Having found the fit between Indian craft excellence and its own DNA, the luxury brand now releases new “Made in India” pieces each season.

At Kering, the group’s March press release included its first public acknowledgment of the role of India’s artisans: “Most of the luxury brands in the world rely on Indian know-how for hand embroidery,” it read.

Even light-touch moves to celebrate the partial Indian heritage of European luxury brand products are welcome. In collaboration with Maria Grazia Chiuri and Dior, Chanakya started an embroidery school for women and, although it is regarded by most as a CSR initiative, the fact that banners embellished by women embroiderers were featured in the latest Dior show during Paris couture week is a step in the right direction for an industry that needs to be more honest about its relationship with artisans from India and other countries in the developing world.

It is worth noting that compared to fast fashion, luxury brands are generally still remarkably opaque. According to Fashion Revolution's 2020 Fashion Transparency Index, which ranks brands out of a 100 percent possible score, ""high street brands lead on transparency but luxury brands are making progress."" Indeed, the top scores were for H&M (73 percent) and C&A (70 percent), followed by sportswear brands Adidas and Reebok. While affordable luxury players like Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger did make it into the 51-60 percent range, pure luxury brands all scored 48 percent, or lower.

Making further progress in terms of transparency is important because it is inextricably linked to fair pay. Transparency provides the practical groundwork and builds the cultural value necessary to recognise Indian artisans as valued agents in supply chains. As it currently stands, lack of transparency means many brands are able to exploit the structural inequalities inherent in Indian craft while passing their work off as European.

Unfair Status

The structural inequality of Indian society first impacts artisans at the very start of their careers, long before they make the trip to big cities in search of a better life. Artisans typically enter the industry through the guru-shishya parampara (Hindi for the teacher-pupil tradition of succession) in rural villages where they learn embroidery in a small workshop of five or six people. The most talented move on to bigger workshops in nearby towns until the best among them are eventually recruited by the export ateliers in hubs like Mumbai.

But because these artisans have had no formal education, they are relegated to the position of daily wage labourer, even though they possess exceptional skills essential to the luxury supply chain. In fact, insiders say their skills are often on par with or better than their counterparts in Europe who are paid at least ten times more.

“It’s my 23rd year in this business and I’m learning new things every time I spend time with the artisans. There can be seven-hundred variations on a stitch. Their skill is the foundation [of it all],” says Swali of Chanakya. The founders of other Indian export houses like Milaaya and Aditiany similarly praise the level of their artisans’ work.

But for artisans to gain similar recognition to their counterparts in Europe, they need more formal structures for education, qualification schemes and ongoing skills development throughout their working life. Recognition is the first step toward being more highly valued, which is key to be able to command better pay and working conditions.

To this end Max Modesti, the founder and director of Les Ateliers 2M, a specialist luxury embroidery and textile company in Mumbai, founded the Kalhath School of Embroidery in 2016 in Lucknow, Northern India, an area renowned for exquisitely intricate chikankari embroidery.

“Craft value can be created only through education — empowering women and men artisans is essential,” says Modesti, explaining that the purpose of the institute is to give a professional education to artisans who never had the chance to pursue studies.

“We felt it was essential to create this one-year intensive education course, as craft businesses like embroidery lack middle management able to coordinate teams of workers, understand design and marketing, and maybe raise up entrepreneurs,” he adds.

With the training of new leadership roles comes an opportunity for some artisans to move up the ladder and be able to pursue new options in a richer career path. For now, the number of students is small, but the Kalhath Institute’s approach to career development seems to be a model for brands to learn from.

Race to the Bottom

One way Utthan reinforced broader structural inequality is in its interpretation of what constitutes a living wage for a highly-skilled artisan. It followed what exporters typically pay embroiderers based on the state of Maharashtra’s (which includes Mumbai) category of skilled workers. There is no official government designation for a skilled high-end embroiderer, instead they are clubbed together in a broadly defined skilled labour category.

Hence Utthan set the monthly wage at 16,000 rupees ($209), a low wage considering the cost of living and relatively high rents in Mumbai. But because this amount also includes insurance contributions and two hours mandated overtime, Utthan embroiderers end up taking home just 13,000 ($170) or less. As a result, some have argued that they are even worse off since they can no longer officially supplement wages through extra overtime. Secretly though, some artisans still do overtime way above the legal limits as they are desperate to earn more.

Recognition and respect are the cornerstones of transforming the conditions for the artisans.

Given the enormous margins made by luxury brands, campaigners assert that there is room to increase artisans' pay to allow them a better standard of living, where they are not compelled to work sixteen-hour days in order to earn enough to support their families back home. Yet what the local export ateliers who manage artisans consistently report is that luxury brand representatives continue to push down prices, making it difficult to raise artisans’ wages.

Modesti rejected the invitation to join Utthan, believing it sought to burnish the reputation of luxury conglomerates without any real commitment to the artisans. He says he pays artisans 50 percent more than the amount stipulated by Utthan, claiming that it is possible in part because his clients guarantee regular work regardless of seasonal swings or trends, and pay consistently and fairly for production costs.

""I've got these stable clients, and we've signed a production agreement and it's clear,"" explains Modesti, referring to his company's long-standing partnership with the brands for whom it produces embroideries, namely Hermès, Chanel and Isabel Marant.

“Today we are in a completely different position from all these manufacturers around us, because basically we don’t need to fight with prices, we don’t need to fight with orders, we don’t need to go and steal the client of another one by trying to make the same piece cheaper. This happens in the other luxury brands today as we speak,” he claims.

Aggressively pushing supplier prices down is a sourcing practice associated more with fast fashion than luxury brands, given the latter’s prestige positioning and high profit margins. But according to Modesti (and other export atelier owners BoF spoke to under the condition of confidentiality for this article), only a few of the luxury brands who source embroideries and surface embellishments from the many specialist export ateliers in Mumbai adhere to more ethical business practices.

Yet all luxury brands – not just a handful – have the potential to make a real difference to artisans’ lives. One subtle but important way for brands to move in the right direction is to fundamentally rethink the status of international artisans in the corporate organisation.

Luxury’s ‘Respect Deficit’

As Sethi says, “recognition and respect are the cornerstones of transforming the conditions for the artisans.” But she adds that while it may seem inconsequential at first glance, paying due respect to artisans in their day-to-day working life is not something that happens everywhere. In fact, many luxury brands still have a “respect deficit.”

One export atelier where respect does appear to be a guiding principle, however, is the embroidery firm Vastrakala which was set up by Jean-François Lesage and business partners Patrick Savouret, Malavika Shivakumar and Sandeep Rao in Chennai, southern India. Vastrakala’s parent company Lesage, is itself now part of Chanel's Paraffection subsidiary, the French luxury giant’s stable of couture artisan workshops.

“[Our] company is dedicated to work of excellence, and to make artisans the most important people within the structure,” explains Lesage.

It is instructive to observe Lesage and the artisans at Vastrakala. As Indian embroiderers, dressed in a uniform of white coats denoting their status as master artisans, work on various embroideries, Lesage converses with them, bringing over books to discuss a particular technique or encouraging them to stop and look at each other’s work while sharing opinions on how something could work better or differently.

It seems that intangible forms of respect are the foundation for more tangible forms of respect, like offering fairer pay and healthcare insurance, something associated with the company’s status of SA8000 certification (a global social certification standard for factories and organisations established in 1997 by Social Accountability International).

But for Modesti, in order to fairly treat and compensate artisans, the luxury industry needs a more sustainable future in India and that means cleaning up its supply chain. The only way to do that, he says, is to own it – literally.

“What I foresee in the next 20 years is luxury groups slowly, slowly acquiring Indian excellence [and] craftsmanship. They will have to integrate it. Because that will be the only way for them to be truly ethical and sustainable,” he asserts.

“There won’t be any other way.”

LVMH's Arnault to purchase stake in Arnaud Lagardère's holding company - TRBusiness,"Wed, 27 May 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigwFodHRwczovL3d3dy50cmJ1c2luZXNzLmNvbS9yZWdpb25hbC1uZXdzL2ludGVybmF0aW9uYWwvbHZtaHMtYXJuYXVsdC10by1wdXJjaGFzZS1zdGFrZS1pbi1hcm5hdWx0LWxhZ2FyZGVyZXMtaG9sZGluZy1jb21wYW55LzE4OTQyM9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LVMH Moët Hennessy Chairman and CEO Bernard Arnault has struck a deal to buy roughly 25% of Arnaud Lagardère’s holding company Lagardère Capital & Management (LC&M).

Via the holding company, Group Managing Partner Arnaud Lagardère owns a 7.26% stake in media conglomerate Lagardère SCA, parent of Lagardère Travel Retail.

“This linkup will strengthen the corporate structure and financial capacities of LCM,” read a joint statement. “The family groups led by Bernard Arnault and Arnaud Lagardère will act in concert with regard to Lagardère SCA.”

The agreement is subject to conditions. On completion of the planned transactions, the parties will make obligatory declarations to the French financial markets authority (Autorité des marchés financiers).

Arnaud Lagardère commented: “I am happy and proud of this link-up with Groupe Arnault. We have long shared the values of family entrepreneurship.

“Groupe Arnault’s exceptional achievements in France and worldwide, its success in the field of distribution and its investment in the creative and cultural industries, are aligned with the fundamentals of my Group and are the mark of an enduring and productive working relationship.”

Bernard Arnault added: “I have welcomed Arnaud Lagardère’s proposal to join forces with him. My friendship with Jean-Luc Lagardère brought our families together, and I have the utmost respect for the group that he built. I am delighted that we are now, alongside Arnaud Lagardère, a long-term shareholder of the company that bears his name.”

The development is an interesting one and follows a recent attempt by leading shareholder Amber Capital to replace Lagardère’s supervisory board, the proposal of which was rejected at the Annual Ordinary and Extraordinary General Meeting of Lagardère SCA on 5 May.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9971306920051575}",neutral,0.9971306920051575,0
French Jeweler Chaumet Makes Daring Move on WeChat E-Commerce - Jing Daily,"Wed, 20 May 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vamluZ2RhaWx5LmNvbS9wb3N0cy9mcmVuY2gtamV3ZWxlci1jaGF1bWV0LW1ha2VzLWRhcmluZy1tb3ZlLW9uLXdlY2hhdC1lLWNvbW1lcmNl0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The brand known for making tiaras for Empress Joséphine, the first wife of Napoleon, is now making hard luxury accessible for Chinese consumers. Just prior to the “520” holiday in China, also known as the new Chinese Valentine’s Day, the Parisian jeweler Chaumet launched its flagship store on WeChat, allowing people to shop for its rings, necklaces, and watches through a Mini Program.

Having launched two successful WeChat pop-up stores last year, the LVMH-owned brand has learned a thing or two, which it has incorporated into its digital flagship store experience. On last “Qixi,” China’s traditional Valentine’s Day, it solved a pain point for online ring shoppers by providing a smart size guide that allows measuring their finger sizes in 360 degrees, as Jing Daily reported. The smart size guide has now become a permanent fixture on the Mini-Program in addition to an infographic tutorial for customers to measure ring sizes by hand.

If hard luxury is going digital, there’s no better way than launching your own digital store. Compared with launching on a third-party platform, having your own official store on WeChat keeps your brand imagine intact, your customers’ personal data secure, and also encourages direct consumer engagement. For example, a customer would need to add their phone number before any purchase through Chaumet's WeChat flagship store, which is then saved by the brand’s online and offline channels and makes it easier for them to book future in-store visits.

Moreover, to boost direct communication, Chaumet asks potential buyers to get in touch with the brand’s customer service team for any questions and price inquiries regarding any product, especially wedding rings sporting large diamonds. Working with a third-party platform, who isn’t as intimately knowledgeable about Chaumet’s 240-year-old history , diamond shape variations, and ring sizes, might diminish not only the luxury purchasing experience, but also be a much harder sale to close.

Rihanna Lands on 'The Sunday Times' of London's Rich List 2020 - HYPEBEAST,"Mon, 18 May 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vaHlwZWJlYXN0LmNvbS8yMDIwLzUvcmloYW5uYS1zdW5kYXktdGltZXMtb2YtbG9uZG9uLXJpY2gtbGlzdC0yMDIwLWZlbnR5LWx2bWgtbmV0LXdvcnRo0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Rihanna was named the richest female musician in the world by Forbes last year, and now the popstar’s financial prowess continues. The Barbadian entrepreneur has landed on The Sunday Times of London’s Rich List for 2020, fueled in large part by her just one-year-old FENTY partnership with LVMH.

Rihanna’s wealth is estimated at £468 million GBP (approximately $571 million USD) according to The Sunday Times, which estimates the FENTY brand to be worth $3 billion USD. The publication expects that as a minority stakeholder, Rihanna owns about 15 percent of the label or a share that’s worth approximately $351.6 million USD. Elsewhere, her other ventures including her storied music discography, her Savage x Fenty lingerie range and her Fenty beauty makeup line attribute to her growing wealth.

While the singer has earned her way onto this year’s prominent list, it’s a different story for some of the region’s historical power players. In fact, the combined wealth of the 1,000 richest individuals and families dropped for the first time since the financial crisis of 2009, according to The Sunday Times, driven largely by the financial impact of the coronavirus.

While LVMH CEO Bernard Arnault did not individually make the list, he and his family nabbed the number five spot on another one of the publication’s annual rankings (focused specifically on the top ten richest families and individuals in the world) with an estimated wealth of £59.4 billion GBP (approx. $72.4 billion USD). Number one on the list are the Walton family, who own retail giants Walmart and Asda, with a wealth of £160.5 billion GBP (approx. $195.7 USD).

As for the sole wealthiest person on the Rich List 2020, inventor Sir James Dyson lands at the top, raking in £16.2 billion GBP (approx. $19.8 GBP).

In other news for Rihanna, the artist was recently honored with the President’s Award at 51st Annual NAACP Image Awards.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.999998927116394}",neutral,0.999998927116394,0
How did Rihanna become the world's wealthiest female musician? - The Telegraph,"Thu, 14 May 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRlbGVncmFwaC5jby51ay93b21lbi93b3JrL2RpZC1yaWhhbm5hLWJlY29tZS13b3JsZHMtd2VhbHRoaWVzdC1mZW1hbGUtbXVzaWNpYW4v0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The story of Robyn Rihanna Fenty, whenever it is written, tends to begin either in Bridgetown, Barbados – where she grew up in a bungalow with her two brothers, her accountant mother and her alcoholic, abusive, crack cocaine-addicted father, who worked as a warehouse supervisor but also sold clothes from a market stall, with which his daughter helped – or leaps straight to New York City in early 2005, where the 17-year-old Rihanna was auditioning for the new CEO of Def Jam Recordings, Jay-Z.

Music lore has it that Jay-Z heard Rihanna performing an early version of ‘Pon de Replay’ and signed her immediately, with his boss, LA Reid, asking her to not leave the building until she was a Def Jam artist, lest she wander off and join a rival label that very day. Rihanna allegedly waited in Jay-Z’s office until 3am, when lawyers finished drafting a six-album record deal to sign. She then cleared her diary of other meetings, moved from Barbados to the US, and Rihanna, the mononymous star, was born.

It is fair to say it went well, music. Jay-Z called ‘Pon de Replay’ right: it became a global hit, as was Rihanna’s debut album, Music of the Sun, even if it now looks weak compared to many of her follow-ups. There were number ones, like ‘SOS’ and ‘Umbrella’ (which spent an entire summer at the summit of the Top 40 in the UK, the longest, ironically, since Wet Wet Wet), experiments with dubstep, rock, pop and dancehall, collaborations with Calvin Harris, Kanye West, Jay-Z and Eminem, as well as nine Grammy Awards, 13 American Music Awards, 12 Billboard Music Awards, 30 UK top-tens, 250m records sold and six Guinness World Records.

Still, almost all of that came before Rihanna made the bulk of her wealth, even if it had made her a multi-millionaire. Throughout the first decade of her career she had tip-toed into fashion, working with Armani, River Island, and becoming the first black woman to be the face of Dior. By 2014 she was made creative director of Puma, with her first shoe selling out within three hours of a pre-sale launching.

Two years later, a first clothing line with the sports brand debuted – to glowing reviews from the notoriously hard-to-please fashion press – at New York Fashion Week, and 12 months later, at 29 years old, she was ready to launch Fenty Beauty.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999951124191284}",neutral,0.9999951124191284,0

The transaction between the two French billionaires is expected to see Arnault pick up about a quarter of LCM’s share capital, according to a Reuters report.

Lagardere’s portfolio includes numerous global travel retail stores, many of which are in Asia. In Hong Kong it is in a joint venture with China Duty Free running key airport concessions for liquor & tobacco and it has a licence to roll out the Thai-based Dean & Deluca cafes in airports in Europe and Asia.

According to a statement released by LVMH and Lagardere, the move is set to “strengthen the corporate structure and financial capacities of LCM”.

“The family groups led by Bernard Arnault and Arnaud Lagardere will act in concert with regard to Lagardere SCA”.

Lagardere has recently been resisting attempts by leading shareholder Amber Capital to extend its influence over the firm by replacing the firm’s supervisory board. The moves are partly in response to criticism of the firm for its overly broad range of business interests and flagging stock exchange performance.
