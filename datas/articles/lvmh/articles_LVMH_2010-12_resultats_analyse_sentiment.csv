Hermes v. LVMH: A French Battle - WWD,"Wed, 01 Dec 2010 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vd3dkLmNvbS9mZWF0dXJlL2hlcm1lcy12LWx2bWgtYS1mcmVuY2gtYmF0dGxlLTMzOTMyODktMTIyMDg5MS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS — France’s latest corporate saga has it all: two of the nation’s richest families, acrimony and more than a soupçon of snobbism.

LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton’s surprise investment in Hermès International has set off a war of words that holds a mirror to French society, which — for all its claims of fraternité and égalité — still harbors tensions between the aristocracy and everybody else, up to and including LVMH kingpin Bernard Arnault, the wealthiest man in the country, who, observers agree, is playing a long game aimed at eventually gaining control of Hermès.

Several observers said they were struck by the degree of surprise and indignation expressed chez Hermès when LVMH unveiled its investment on Oct. 23. Hermès executives immediately questioned the legality of LVMH’s purchase of 17.1 percent of its shares via cash-settled equity swaps.

“Just because it’s the luxury sector, are you supposed to wear gloves?” one industry source asked incredulously. “This is no gentleman’s battlefield — it’s a business like any other.”

But beyond the technicalities of the deal, the family, which prides itself on its long tradition of craftsmanship rooted in an elite equestrian heritage, has made no secret of its distaste for the man Hermès chief executive officer Patrick Thomas described as “a visitor in the garden.”

Bertrand Puech, executive chairman of Emile Hermès SARL, which represents the family shareholders, told French daily Le Figaro they did not consider the move “friendly,” despite Arnault’s assurances that he does not plan a hostile takeover and will not seek any board seats.

“The family is saying clearly and unanimously: ‘If you want to be friendly, Monsieur Arnault, then you must withdraw,’ ” Puech told the paper.

With 73.4 percent of the capital, the three Hermès family branches — Dumas, Puech and Guerrand — appear to have a lock on the 173-year-old firm, whose status as a limited partnership guarantees they keep control of all key posts. But they have made clear that Arnault’s arrival represents an assault on all the values they hold dear.

“I don’t think a house like Hermès is capable of surviving in a universe controlled by money. This house has proved again and again that poetry is not incompatible with business,” Thomas said recently at the opening of the new Hermès store on the French capital’s Left Bank.

“I sincerely hope that the power of money alone will not kill the pretty flower,” he added.

Arnault, on the other hand, has limited himself to repeating that he has no intention of seeking control of Hermès and that LVMH’s acquisition was in full compliance with French market regulations — although even the head of French market regulator AMF, Jean-Pierre Jouyet, has said the rules are not stringent enough.

Analysts have no doubt Arnault’s ultimate goal is a full takeover, noting the luxury titan is repeating a scenario that has marked all his key acquisitions since taking over LVMH in 1989. But the legal complications to an outright takeover, in this case, mean the process will be long and drawn out.

“LVMH is waiting in the wings. They don’t need to rush,” said Christophe Reille, managing partner of RLD-Partners, a firm specialized in crisis communications, whose past clients include France’s rogue trader Jérôme Kerviel. “In terms of communications, they have the easy part.”

Reille said that by sticking to a purely financial message, LVMH had effectively pushed Hermès into a corner: If its managers point to the company’s healthy financial results in order to convince family members not to sell their shares to Arnault, they are merely highlighting the reason why LVMH started snapping up capital in the first place.

And by insisting the company wants to remain independent at all costs, Thomas and Puech are shutting the door to a potential white knight.

“In the end, all they have left to communicate on is the link between the members of the family and how this is threatened by the arrival of a nouveau riche on their turf. Well, that’s a pretty weak message. As a result, they are resorting to this kind of bucolic allegory, but the message is very narrow,” Reille said.

Arnault, on the other hand, will probably remain silent while he waits for family members to sell him their shares — a process analysts say could take years but is increasingly likely, as a growing number of sixth-generation heirs come into ownership of ever-decreasing portions of the company.

“It’s the technique of the Ottoman strangler — every day, it tightens its grip a little. Gradually, you are going to die, but without realizing it,” said Reille. “It is a rampant, stealthy acquisition of shares, and he will end up swallowing the company and digesting it calmly, bit by bit.”

In media terms, the story is solid gold, pitting as it does a self-made billionaire tycoon against a family-run house whose Birkin bags and iconic silk scarves have become a byword for fine craftsmanship.

“At Hermès, LVMH has always been seen as evil — too strong and powerful to be fair or friendly,” said one industry source.

Catherine Veillé, president of branding consultancy Ipsos Insight Marques, said the saga was bound to grip readers of the French newspapers that have relayed every salvo in the battle, but it will make little difference to clients in stores.

“It’s like ‘Dallas.’ At best, if consumers pay any attention to this, it’s because they are witnessing the kind of soap opera they usually see on television, and nothing more. It does not affect the image of the brand in the slightest,” she said.

For one, the two sides are fighting on unequal terms, Veillé said.

Hermès is a brand name with a distinct identity, while LVMH designates the luxury group that owns more than 60 brands, ranging from Louis Vuitton to Moët Chandon to Guerlain. At the same time, while the concept of LVMH may be more abstract in image terms, the group has a distinct figurehead in Arnault, something Hermès is lacking.

“There is no emotional link to any founder. The emotional link is with the product: the horse, the saddle and leather,” Veillé said of Hermès.

And most luxury specialists believe that an LVMH takeover would not fundamentally threaten the Hermès brand’s DNA.

Benoit Garbe, a vice president of global brand strategy and financial consultancy Millward Brown Optimor, said LVMH’s track record suggests it is committed to preserving the specificity of the brands it acquires, even if that means forgoing some cost savings and synergies.

“So it’s not like suddenly you go to the evil LVMH and you become a chemical company with no soul. I don’t think that is a fair argument, and I don’t think the culture and the magic of the brand would be destroyed. I think it’s really looking at what the future could look like,” Garbe added, noting that LVMH could provide valuable resources and know-how for accessing emerging markets where Hermès has yet to open stores.

His colleague Pierre Dupreelle, also a vice president at Millward Brown Optimor, had a more nuanced view.

“I think it would make sense as a brand portfolio to have both Hermès and Vuitton, if you keep them at the positioning that they are both today,” he said. “A great example on how to include the Hermès brand into the LVMH portfolio would be the example of Bottega Veneta in the Gucci Group portfolio.”

However, it was more likely that LVMH would try to introduce the Hermès brand to a much larger client base.

“That has an impact in terms of price points, where price points are lower than they used to be to address that new marketplace, and the communication is also very different, because you need to raise awareness in a much broader way than what Hermès is doing today,” Dupreelle said. “That would definitely have an impact on the brand DNA.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999814033508301}",neutral,0.9999814033508301,0
Hermès clan unites to fight LVMH in 'handbag war' - The Guardian,"Fri, 03 Dec 2010 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiPGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy8yMDEwL2RlYy8wMy9oZXJtZXMtbHZtaNIBPGh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy8yMDEwL2RlYy8wMy9oZXJtZXMtbHZtaA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The family shareholders of the French luxury goods maker Hermès will hold crisis talks tomorrow to discuss how to defend themselves against a potential takeover by the rival conglomerate LVMH.

In the latest round of Paris's bitter ""handbag wars"", about 60 family shareholders in the exclusive label met to stave off what they see as a hostile advance by the billionaire businessman Bernard Arnault, head of the world's biggest luxury-goods group.

Various branches of the family descended from the saddle-maker who founded Hermès in 1837 still hold 73.4% of the stock of what has become one of the most successful luxury brands – one that has largely bucked the financial crisis.

The company prides itself on being one of the world's last high-end labels to remain independent, defiantly resisting conglomerates and what it scathingly calls ""mass-market techniques"".

But family members have been in a panic since it emerged last month that Arnault, whose group includes Louis Vuitton and Moët Hennessy, has used legal but controversial forms of derivatives and equity swaps to obtain a 17.1% stake in Hermès without being detected.

The family have said they consider Arnault's move to be hostile and unwelcome; they refer to him as ""an intruder in the garden"" and have called for him to offload his shares and withdraw. Arnault, France's richest man and a friend of the French president, Nicolas Sarkozy, has said he is ""peaceful"" and ""friendly"" and is simply seeking to protect the French label from foreign takeover.

Hermès has declined to comment on the family shareholders' plans. But options for a defence could include the creation of an unlisted holding company for the family shareholding and shareholder pacts, or a mixture of the two. The firm has hired BNP Paribas and Bank of America to advise on how to fend off a possible takeover bid.

Hermès bosses have pleaded for the need to protect the ""poetry"" of their exclusive leather-goods and fashion label from the threat of a giant ruled by money.

Shares in Hermès closed down 9.3% at €155.55 today but are still substantially up on the year. The shares had hit a record high after LVMH's stake came to light, and made gains earlier this week when large trading volumes sparked speculation of a big trade ahead of the family meeting.

Hermès, which reported €1.67bn (£1.4bn) in sales for the first nine months of this year, has said it is on track to post the best profits in a decade, or even in the company's 173-year history.

Analysts said investors now expect LVMH to acquire more shares or launch a takeover. Arnault has denied this and says he does not seek a boardroom seat. But he has earned a reputation in France for building up his empire, which ranges from wines to fashion, watches, perfume and jewellery, by voraciously acquiring smaller firms, often exploiting divisions within the families that run them.

Ten years ago, during another of Arnault's ""handbag wars"" against rival François Pinault, he insisted he was not going to bid for the family-owned Italian label Gucci before mounting a failed takeover bid.

The French regulator has launched an investigation into the methods used by LVMH to acquire its stake in Hermès. The group insists it has played by the rules, but authorities now want loopholes closed.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9997979998588562}",neutral,0.9997979998588562,0

Hermes-LVMH battle: a story of big brands, big personalities, big money and a big families

Hermes is a chic brand for products ranging from handbags to scarves and perfume while French company LVMH or Louis-Vuitton Moet Hennessy is the world's largest luxury goods group, specialising in wines and spirits, fashion and leather goods, perfumes, watches and jewellery.On Friday, the extended Hermes family meets and is expected to launch a counter attack against LVMH which acquired 17.1 percent of Hermes by stealth in October.Shares in Hermes rose 1.46 percent to 159.95 euros by midday on Thursday, showing an increase of 15 percent over the week so far.Hermes has come a long way in 170 years since Thierry Hermes rode the horse business to make bags for saddles for the nobility.Today, the French company is in the business of making the rich and middle classes, increasingly in rising emerging economies, feel and look good.Luxury is proving to be a sector with ever expanding appeal in an ever more global market, and strides onwards and upwards in bad times as well as good.The battle in prospect is a story of big brands, big personalities, big money and a big family.LVMH employs 77,000 people and has a market value of nearly 60 billion billion euros, compared with Hermes on 16.8 billion euros.On November 9, shortly after LVMH's presence was revealed, Hermes reported sales in the first nine months of the year amounted to 1.67 billion euros (2.18 billion dollars) and that sales for the year were on target to increase by 15 pecent.The company ""is on the way to probably the best year in at least 10 years and perhaps in all its history,"" Hermes Patrick Thomas said.About 70 inheritors of the six-generation Hermes family business meet on Friday to discuss how to use their combined 73.4 percent in the face of the unwelcome raid by LVMH.One option is to create a holding company, which would not be quoted on the stock market and so would be closed to outside investors, to house all of the interests held by the family.Another option is an agreement for the family to act together to keep the invader at the gates of the family jewels.Meanwhile a high-profile defender of the rights of small shareholders in companies, Colette Neuville, has urged the stock market authority not to exempt the family from an obligation under such circumstances to make a bid to acquire the entire share capital.For several days, there has been heavy trading in Hermes shares.One analyst, who declined to be named, commented: ""One can see there has been speculative activity for several days because investors consider that it is increasingly likely that LVMH will acquire more shares or launch a takeover.""The shares are still below the record high of more than 200 euros they reached immediately after LVMH announced that it had built up its stake. Shares in LVMH were showing a rise of 1.05 percent on Thursday to 119.68 euros.LVMH has been built into one of the global giants of luxury propucts by Bernard Arnault, who insists that his sudden arrival in Hermes is ""friendly.""To those who manage Hermes for the family, the manoeuvre looks hostile.""If you want to be friendly, Mr. Arnault, you should withdraw,"" Hermes executive Bertrand Puech, an heir of Emile Hermes who switched the company into fashion, said last month. ""We're artisans, our goal is to make the best products in the world. We're not in luxury, we're in quality.""To observers the stand-off recalls a tremendous takeover battle for another once family-owned business, Gucci of Italy, which ended in 2001.That contest was fought out with a sudden stock issue, courtroom clashes and eventually defeat for LVMH and Arnault at the hands of big French rival PPR, headed then by its founder Francois Pinault, now run by his son. Gucci had appealed to PPR as a defensive ""white knight"" to drive off LVMH.The French stock market authority AMF has opened an investigation into the method used by LVMH to snap up its holding in Hermes. LVMH insists that it acted within the rules.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9504936933517456}",neutral,0.9504936933517456,0
