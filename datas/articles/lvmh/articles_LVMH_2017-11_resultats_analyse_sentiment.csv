Napa's Colgin Cellars Sells Majority Stake to French Luxury Titan LVMH - Wine Spectator,"Tue, 21 Nov 2017 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndpbmVzcGVjdGF0b3IuY29tL2FydGljbGVzL2NvbGdpbi1jZWxsYXJzLXNlbGxzLW1ham9yaXR5LXN0YWtlLXRvLWZyZW5jaC1sdXh1cnktdGl0YW4tbHZtaNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Colgin owners Ann Colgin and her husband, Joe Wender, have agreed to sell 60 percent of their Napa Valley winery to French luxury conglomerate LVMH. The deal includes the brand, the winery and its 26 acres of vineyards. Colgin and Wender will stay on in leadership roles, as will COO Paul Roberts, and winemaker Allison Tauziet will continue to make the wines. The sale price was not disclosed.

""Their ethos of luxury and spirit of entrepreneurship resonated with us,"" Colgin told Wine Spectator. ""Their track record of championing hand-crafted products and showcasing them to the world made us confident that a partnership would preserve the quality of our wines and the spirit of excellence that has inspired us for the past quarter-century.""

Founded by Ann and her then-husband, Fred Schrader, in 1992, Colgin has become one of Napa's cult classics, with limited-production Cabernet Sauvignons and a Syrah that command prices exceeding $500 per bottle and sell exclusively to mailing-list members and high-end restaurants and retailers. Its wines regularly earn outstanding to classic ratings from Wine Spectator. Total annual production is approximately 4,000 cases.

The winery and estate vineyards are located in one of Napa's most sought-after locales, on Pritchard Hill, in the eastern hills above St. Helena. They also own the historic Tychson Hill Vineyard near Calistoga, which Colgin has restored. The brand also purchases grapes from David Abreu's Madrona Ranch on the western side of St. Helena for their Cariad bottling.

""We were not looking for a partner,"" said Colgin. ""After a social introduction to Bernard Arnault several months ago, we began discussions with the LVMH team.""

LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton is the world's largest luxury-goods company, and its portfolio includes some of France's most prominent wine brands, including Moët & Chandon, Dom Pérignon, Veuve Clicquot, Krug, Ruinart, Château Cheval-Blanc and Château d'Yquem. The company also represents Napa's Chandon and Newton wineries, as well as other notables from around the world, including Terrazas de los Andes, Cheval des Andes, Cloudy Bay, Cape Mentelle, Bodega Numanthia and Ao Yun. The company is also known for its fashion and luxury brands, which include Louis Vuitton, Christian Dior and Sephora.

""We share with Colgin Cellars the same desire to offer the very best quality products,"" Arnault, chairman and CEO of LVMH, said in a statement. ""I am delighted to welcome Colgin's unique heritage, reaffirming our strategy of selective acquisition of the best existing terroirs, and enriching our collection of iconic wines.""

International luxury companies see profit potential in Napa wineries. François Pinault's Artemis Group, which owns fashion brands Gucci and Yves Saint Laurent, and Château Latour in Bordeaux and Domaine Eugénie and Domaine Clos de Tart in Burgundy, purchased the Eisele Vineyard in 2013. And in 2015, Chanel added Rutherford's St. Supéry to its roster of Bordeaux estates. As competition among luxury wine brands becomes fiercer, global companies offer marketing and distribution muscle. LVMH recently launched an American division of its online retail site, Clos19.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999886751174927}",neutral,0.9999886751174927,0
Dior CEO Sidney Toledano Promoted to Lead All LVMH Fashion Houses - Observer,"Wed, 08 Nov 2017 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vb2JzZXJ2ZXIuY29tLzIwMTcvMTEvZGlvci1jZW8tc2lkbmV5LXRvbGVkYW5vLXByb21vdGVkLXRvLWxlYWQtYWxsLWx2bWgtZmFzaGlvbi1ob3VzZXMv0gFjaHR0cHM6Ly9vYnNlcnZlci5jb20vMjAxNy8xMS9kaW9yLWNlby1zaWRuZXktdG9sZWRhbm8tcHJvbW90ZWQtdG8tbGVhZC1hbGwtbHZtaC1mYXNoaW9uLWhvdXNlcy9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"French luxury group LVMH (LVMHF) has promoted Sidney Toledano, the long-time CEO of Christian Dior Couture, to lead LVMH Fashion Group, which umbrellas 16 fashion houses, including dior (CHDRY), the company announced this morning.

In his new role, Toledano will oversee operations for Céline, Givenchy, Loewe, Pucci, Kenzo, Marc Jacobs, Rossimoda and Nicholas Kirkwood, LVMH said in a press release.

The Fashion Group is the largest business sector of LVMH, accounting for 34 percent of LVMH’s total sales, as of 2016. The group’s 16 fashion houses reported a combined revenue of €12.8 billion ($14.8 billion) in 2016.

Current head of the Fashion Group, Pierre-Yves Roussel, will step down after a 13-year tenure. He will serve as a special advisor to Bernard Arnault, chairman and CEO of LVMH, and assume new operational responsibilities within the LVMH Executive Committee.

Growing up in fashion-suffused Morocco, Toledano has had a passion for the fashion industry since a young age. After a detour in engineering school and working in the steel industry, he found his path when he began working for UK-based shoemaker Kickers in the 1980s.

Toledano joined Dior in 1994 and was made president and CEO in 1998. He is best known for launching the iconic Lady Dior handbag in the 1990s and navigating the public relations scandals of former design chief John Galliano.

“You cannot do anything that could put in danger the name of Dior. Protect the brand, the reputation of the brand,” he told The Financial Times last year. “They used to say in the industry: location, location, location. I say people, people, people; you invest in stores, you invest in events, but investment in people is the most important.”

“Sidney Toledano is the driving force behind the huge success of Christian Dior Couture across the world,” LVMH CEO Arnault said in a company statement. “Over the past 25 years, he has done an outstanding job of developing the exceptional House of Christian Dior Couture and promoting its elegance and modernity through its highly talented team of designers.”

Last month, LVMH reported a 12 percent revenue growth in the first nine months of 2017.

The CEO chair at Dior will be succeeded by Petro Beccari, current CEO of Fendi and a former marketing director at Louis Vuitton. LVMH hasn’t announced the new CEO for Fendi yet.

All new appointments will take effect at the beginning of 2018.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999829530715942}",neutral,0.9999829530715942,0

Sidney Toledano, the man who built Christian Dior into a multibillion-dollar global powerhouse and shepherded it successfully through one of fashion’s biggest scandals, will be stepping down from the helm of the brand after leading it for almost 20 years. He will become chairman and chief executive of the LVMH Fashion Group, the division that encompasses eight of the group’s smaller brands including Céline, Givenchy, Loewe, and Emilio Pucci. He will also join the LVMH executive committee. Pietro Beccari, the chief executive of Fendi, another brand in the LVMH stable, will become chief executive of Dior.

Pierre-Yves Roussel, the former head of LVMH Fashion Group and the architect of its evolution and expansion, is leaving that role after 10 years to become a special adviser to the LVMH chairman, Bernard Arnault.

The scale of the changes reflects the unrest in the wider industry, which was rebounding this year after a period of difficulty.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9995439648628235}",neutral,0.9995439648628235,0
Why LVMH May Become a Bigger Beauty Player - The Business of Fashion,"Thu, 23 Nov 2017 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzb2ZmYXNoaW9uLmNvbS9vcGluaW9ucy9iZWF1dHkvd2h5LWx2bWgtbWF5LWJlY29tZS1hLWJpZ2dlci1iZWF1dHktcGxheWVyL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"GENEVA, Switzerland — The world of mass broadcast media has supported the rise of big brands that, almost by definition, had wide appeal. In contrast, today's digital media reality favours niche brands that speak the language of specific consumer segments. Furthermore, with much digital media bought and sold through blind auctions, the raw procurement advantage enjoyed by big brands in traditional media is less clear-cut. Add e-commerce with its limitless shelf space, absence of listing fees and direct-to-consumer business models, and we have a recipe for market fragmentation.

In the beauty market, giants like L'Oréal and Estée Lauder have risen to the challenge, acquiring and then globalising niche brands. L'Oréal has bought and developed Nyx and likely has similar internationalisation plans for It Cosmetics and CeraVe. Meanwhile, Estée Lauder is doing the same with Becca and Too Faced. But all this requires capital investment.

French luxury conglomerate LVMH — which owns historic houses, such as Parfums Christian Dior, Parfums Givenchy and Guerlain, as well as brands like Benefit Cosmetics, Fresh and Make Up For Ever — has so far stayed out of the fray. However, the group's success with the Fenty Beauty by Rihanna line, developed with Kendo, an incubator for beauty brands, may encourage LVMH to take the plunge with a full brand rollout model. If so, the conglomerate would have a significant advantage: Sephora.

Sephora, LVMH’s highly successful multi-brand cosmetics and fragrance play, is a powerful brand in its own right. What’s more, the business has enviable retail expertise and deep experience in assortment management and localisation. It also has a good track record when it comes to the commercial development of niche brands, including Estée Lauder’s Too Faced.

In short, in Sephora, LVMH has the perfect platform with which to harness the power of niche brands without the need to invest capital to acquire them. Sephora effectively gives LVMH a laboratory in which to incubate, test and tweak new brands in a range of locations before expanding into other channels.

And the benefits flow both ways. With the fragmentation of the market playing into Sephora's raison d'être, the pace of expansion at Sephora itself seems set to accelerate, pushing it even further ahead of its competitors.

For LVMH, there are also two indirect, but no less important, benefits. First, a more powerful beauty and cosmetics presence would bring greater stability to the group’s business portfolio. Secondly, it could open up an even more profitable entry point to the middle class whose ranks are growing across the globe.

In short, LVMH looks poised to become a more meaningful player in beauty.

LVMH Inaugurates Institut des Métiers d'Excellence at Palazzo Pucci - WWD,"Mon, 27 Nov 2017 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3dkLmNvbS9mZWF0dXJlL2x2bWgtaW5hdWd1cmF0ZXMtaW5zdGl0dXQtZGVzLW1ldGllcnMtZGV4Y2VsbGVuY2UtYXQtcGFsYXp6by1wdWNjaS0xMTA1NjM0Mi_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"MILAN — LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton has found a home in Italy for its Institut des Métiers d’Excellence and the vocational training program inaugurated its Italian headquarters at Palazzo Pucci in Florence on Monday as it plans new partnerships in the country. The ceremony marks the beginning of the courses, in collaboration with Polimoda, for the 27 students selected.

“To give life to the ideas of an artistic director is exciting,” said Florence Rambaud, director of IME. “There is a real desire to do beautiful things with one’s hands and there are a lot of people who change jobs and become craftsmen.”

Rambaud said Florence, being a cradle of “culture and creativity,” and Emilio Pucci’s own history stand for what LVMH “wants to represent. Laudomia [Pucci] has been a great supporter since the beginning.” Florence is also near one of Italy’s main leather goods hubs in Scandicci. “It was an obvious choice,” Rambaud said.

Students will have the opportunity to divide their time between school and training at Bulgari, Céline, Christian Dior, Fendi, Loro Piana and Louis Vuitton, all controlled by LVMH. “We have worked for a year to build a program from scratch. We want cross-fertilization and to avoid the silos [effect], finding solutions with different techniques and being very concrete.”

She was enthusiastic about the work done so far by other IME students, “unbelievable things that one cannot imagine,” and about how they “learn to work on a project and as a team for individual and collective excellence.” The program also creates synergies between France and Italy, she said.

The inauguration at Palazzo Pucci coincided with the beginning of the academic year for the first apprentices in training courses created in partnership with Polimoda and For.Al in leather goods and jewelry, respectively. As reported in July, LVMH is extending its vocational training model to Italy through a partnership between IME and Italian fashion and design school Polimoda, aimed at training leather-goods artisans, beginning with the 2017-18 school year.

For.Al is based in Valenza and IME participants will train at Bulgari, which is located in the storied goldsmith district.

Rambaud said IME is also developing two new programs, in retail and a “client adviser” course in Venice, and another dedicated to footwear near Padova, also in the Veneto region, “hopefully” in 2018.

The existing programs are funded by the Tuscany and Piedmont regions. The apprenticeships alternate between theoretical education at the schools and practical training at the LVMH companies and also include language training and original course content, with master classes for both specific skill sets and multiple métiers. Rambaud underscored how LVMH focuses on the “transmission of Italian savoir-faire” and how IME plays “an active role in developing the employability of young people in these regions.”

Created in 2014, the IME program offers work and study vocational training programs designed to ensure the transmission of knowhow that involve artisanal craftsmanship, creative and retail skills. To date more than 300 apprentices have joined the program to train for different professions. IME is involved in schooling more than 200 young people in areas including jewelry, dressmaking, winemaking, leather goods, culinary arts, watches, luxury retail and design together with partner institutions in France and Switzerland. They include BJO Formation in Paris for jewelry, the École de la Chambre Syndicale de la Couture Parisienne for fashion and the Ferrandi Paris school for gastronomy.

The program is expected to find a permanent home with the creation of La Maison LVMH/Arts–Talents–Patrimoine in the Bois de Boulogne near Paris. Like the nearby Fondation Louis Vuitton, it will be designed by architect Frank Gehry.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999827146530151}",neutral,0.9999827146530151,0
LVMH buys majority stake in Napa Valley's Colgin Cellars - North Bay Business Journal,"Tue, 21 Nov 2017 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5vcnRoYmF5YnVzaW5lc3Nqb3VybmFsLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL2luZHVzdHJ5LW5ld3MvbHZtaC1idXlzLW1ham9yaXR5LXN0YWtlLWluLW5hcGEtdmFsbGV5cy1jb2xnaW4tY2VsbGFycy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LVMH buys majority stake in Napa Valley’s Colgin Cellars

French luxury goods company LVMH Group, whose brands include Louis Vuitton and Dom Perignon, has made another play in Napa Valley fine wine with the acquisition of a majority stake in Colgin Cellars.

Ann Colgin and her husband, Joe Wender, sold 60 percent equity in the St. Helena winery she started in 1992, Paris-based LVMH announced Nov. 21. The couple will keep 40 percent ownership and retain leadership of the operation. Chief Operating Officer Paul Roberts and winemaker Allison Tauziet also will remain in place.

'After a social introduction to Mr. Arnault several months ago and discussions with the LVMH team, I realized that I could not find a better partner for Colgin Cellars to preserve our founding spirit and our exquisitely handcrafted red wines, into the future,' Colgin said in a statement, referring to LVMH Chairman and CEO Bernard Arnault. 'We are happy to join the LVMH Group to continue to offer our loyal customers the unique and high-end experiences we've been creating for them, for over a quarter of a century.'

LVMH made a point to note that the winery, located at the north end of the IX Estate vineyard property in the Pritchard Hill area of the valley, wasn't touched by the massive October wildfires.

Colgin Cellars's four wines are Tychson Hill cabernet sauvignon, Cariad Napa Valley red wine, IX Estate Napa Valley red wine and IX Estate syrah. They are sold by mailing list to consumers and distributed to high-end restaurants and retailers in the U.S. and more than 30 other countries.

'We share with Colgin Cellars the same desire to offer the very best quality products,' Arnault said in a statement. 'I am therefore delighted to welcome Colgin's unique heritage into LVMH, reaffirming our strategy of selective acquisition of the best existing terroirs, and enriching our collection of iconic wines such as Château Cheval Blanc, Château d'Yquem or Domaine du Clos des Lambrays.'

LVMH Group formed with the merger of Moët Hennessy and Louis Vuitton. Its 70 brands span hundreds of years of production, from Le Clos des Lambrays started in 1365 to Edun, a fashion brand started in 2005 and acquired in 2009. Revenue in 2016 was 37.6 billion euros, up 5 percent from 2015.

Wine & Spirits business unit revenue was 4.84 billion euros last year, up 5 percent.

Colgin is the latest LVMH venture in Napa Valley. In 1973, Domaine Chandon opened in Yountville. It was the first sparkling-wine house in the U.S. by a French producer, Moët & Chandon.

Peter and Su Hua Newton started Newton Vineyard near St. Helena in 1977 and sold a majority stake to LVMH in 2001.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.99998939037323}",neutral,0.99998939037323,0
BoF Exclusive | Inside LVMH's Executive Reshuffle | BoF - The Business of Fashion,"Wed, 08 Nov 2017 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzb2ZmYXNoaW9uLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy9uZXdzLWFuYWx5c2lzL2x2bWgtYW5ub3VuY2VzLW1ham9yLWV4ZWN1dGl2ZS1yZXNodWZmbGUv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS, France — Today's game of musical chairs does not involve fashion designers, but rather the business minds leading the commercial charge.

In what is perhaps the greatest executive reshuffle to occur in the industry in some time, LVMH has announced that Sidney Toledano, longtime chief executive of Christian Dior Couture, is stepping down, and will be replaced by Fendi chief executive Pietro Beccari. Meanwhile, Toledano will step into the shoes of Pierre-Yves Roussel, becoming chairman of the LVMH Fashion Group. Roussel will transition into the role of special advisor to LVMH chairman and chief executive Bernard Arnault, effective January 2018. In due time, Roussel will assume ""new operational responsibilities"" within the LMVH executive committee, of which he has been a member for 14 years, although the details of his new role have yet to be disclosed. Beccari and Toledano will also join the LVMH executive committee. A successor for Beccari, who has led Fendi since 2012, has not yet been named.

According to Arnault, Beccari's appointment signals ""a new era"" at the house of Dior, which was integrated into the LVMH group earlier this year through a two-part deal worth $13 billion. ""Having been an integral member of our group for 12 years, Pietro has an excellent track record,"" he said in a statement, citing Beccari's work as marketing director of Louis Vuitton and the growth experienced by Fendi during his tenure. ""He will be an excellent leader who will steer Dior towards ever greater success in the future.""

""[Beccari] has done extremely well at Fendi,"" said Luca Solca, head of luxury goods at Exane BNP Paribas. ""It is one of the brands on the ‘front foot’ in the global soft-luxury landscape.""

“It will be difficult to find low-hanging fruits because the job has been exceptional, and therefore there is a need to be even more careful,” Beccari told BoF in an exclusive interview, when asked about his strategy for Dior. “I need three or four months to feel the house, feel the values and start from there.”

Beccari, who will report directly to Arnault, is a natural choice for Dior, given his tenure within the group and his shared Italian heritage with women's artistic director Maria Grazia Chiuri . ""I never had the chance to work with her, but we've sat at a few tables together at dinner,"" Beccari said of their personal rapport. ""We have a good energy together. I hope that this good energy will be able to create the connection necessary for the maison to perform. I think the relationship between the creative director and the CEO has to work for the house to work. The fact that we are both Italian, and the fact that we both have experience at Fendi, may make it easier for us.""

That good energy may prove invaluable. While the company says Chiuri’s early collections generated a strong response at retail, they have been met with chilly reviews from the fashion press and some industry observers have questioned whether the designer is a good long-term fit for Dior.

“I think it’s definitely a plus, but I believe the fact that I know the group from the inside and [I know] the mechanics of the group is very important,” said Beccari . “We’re living in a very interesting period in the industry in which there are big losers and big winners. What is true today is not true the day after tomorrow. It’s a very challenging moment in a way; you have to be better than the others and get market share from the others in order to survive. I think innovation and speed are exceptionally important in the market today.”

Dior's prosperous fragrance business, Parfums Christian Dior, will continue to be led by Claude Martinez.

Executives from Céline, Givenchy, Loewe, Pucci, Kenzo, Marc Jacobs, Rossi Moda and Nicholas Kirkwood will now report to Toledano, whose tenure at Dior began in 1994, when he was named director of leather goods. Under his direction, Christian Dior released the Lady Dior handbag in 1995, one of the industry's first ""It"" bags, which helped to catapult the couture house into a global brand.

He was named president and chief executive of Christian Dior Couture in 1998, ushering in an era of significant growth across categories including fragrance, cosmetics and accessories as well as men's and women's fashion. In 2016, the house generated almost €1.9 billion ($2.2 billion) in sales, a 5 percent increase from the year before. Toledano has also managed several creative turning points, including the rise of Hedi Slimane as men's artistic director in the early 2000s, the sudden departure of longtime womenswear designer John Galliano in 2011, the three-year tenure of Raf Simons and the appointment of Chiuri.

""Sidney Toledano is the driving force behind the huge success of Christian Dior Couture across the world,"" Arnault said. ""Over the past 25 years, he has done an outstanding job of developing the exceptional house of Christian Dior Couture and promoting its elegance and modernity through its highly talented team of designers.""

“This long, long journey at Dior has been full of success and turbulence, but I believe Dior Couture is on the right track. There has been robust growth and the building blocks are there,” Toledano told BoF. “For me, it was a moment to say, ‘What is the next step?’ If I have to make a change, it’s now, because I am full of energy. All of those brands, most of them have huge potential. When Bernard Arnault asked me to do this, I didn’t hesitate. I think it will be good for LVMH. I think Pierre-Yves did a great job, and now we’ll see how we can continue on. For me, it’s an exciting, new experience.”

In his new role, Toledano — known as a seasoned executive — hopes to continue building on Roussel’s foundation by advising each house leader on operations, brand positioning and brand integrity. “We’ve had success at Dior because of the talent of the designers, but also because of how we merchandise ready-to-wear, bag, shoes and retail,” he said. “I believe that experience is important. It’s easy to make mistakes; it’s not enough to have a hit bag or a hit shoe. You have to reinforce the knowledge.”

Toledano, who mentored several of the industry’s top executives during his tenure at Dior, said that he looked forward to serving as a sounding board for executives who operate within the group. “I want to give guidance,” he said. “I don’t want to do it myself. At Dior, I was so hands on. I want to help them. This is my objective.”

Roussel, who joined LVMH in 2004 as executive vice president of strategy and operations, was promoted to chief executive of the Fashion Group in 2006. His tenure has been marked with significant growth in the Fashion Group, in part thanks to his reinvention of several of maisons, including Givenchy, which saw tremendous acceleration under the creative direction of Riccardo Tisci; Kenzo, where he installed Opening Ceremony founders Carol Lim and Humberto Leon, who ushered the brand back into the cultural conversation with great financial success; Loewe, revitalised by J.W. Anderson designer Jonathan Anderson; and, perhaps most importantly, Céline, transformed by the highly influential work of creative director Phoebe Philo. He also led the acquisition or investment in emerging labels — including Anderson's J.W. Anderson and Nicholas Kirkwood — and managed the sale of Donna Karan International to G-III in 2016.

“Thanks to his leadership, the Fashion Group's various brands have achieved remarkable success over the last 10 years. In particular, he has played an instrumental role in the selection of the best creative talent and in introducing innovative strategies and high-performance teams within the different houses,"" said Arnault.

A decade ago, Roussel was tasked with scaling the fashion businesses beyond Louis Vuitton and Dior, the company’s cash cows. He was involved in the hiring and scouting of both executives and creatives, and has moved several women into chief executive positions. (Currently, Loewe, Kenzo and Céline are all run by women on the business side.)

“We need the mega brands and we’re really happy with the success of those brands, but I was also convinced that alongside those mega brands there would be an appetite for more,” Roussel told BoF. “It’s been a cycle of 10 years. We tried many things: some things worked really well. If you look at the size of all those brands, many are five, six, seven times the size that they were.”

Roussel's decision to step down may also fan the flames that one of his star recruits, Philo, may be exiting the company at the end of the year. In October, BoF reported that LVMH is interviewing replacements for Philo and rebuilding the design team in preparation for her eventual departure from Céline.

In 2016, LVMH’s Fashion and Leather Goods Group — which includes every fashion maison besides Christian Dior Couture — accounted for nearly a third of the overall business, generating €12.3 billion ($14.3 billion), up 5 percent from €11.7 billion ($13.6 billion) a year earlier and 137 percent from €5.2 billion ($6 billion) in 2006. “We make more profit now at Céline and Givenchy than we were making in sales 10 years ago,” Roussel said. Investments have also paid off. J.W. Anderson had £2 million ($2.6 million) in turnover when Roussel brought it into the LVMH fold. It’s now 10 times that size. “It’s not a question of putting money into it,” he said. “I’ve built an organisation that’s capable of grooming a small brand.”

Today’s announcement also underscores LVMH’s expertise in grooming and retaining executive talent. “They are good at breeding a long-and-strong senior management bench,” Solca said. “They didn’t have to go outside to fill a most important position.”

Next up, of course, is finding the right replacement for Beccari at Fendi. “It will be key,” Solca added.

Italy is becoming increasingly important as a production hub for . In March, the French luxury group opened a new jewellery manufacturing facility for in Valenza, Piedmont - Europe's largest - and now has turned its sights on Tuscany, where it plans to enlarge the production facilities for and . LVMH also announced the building of a new eyewear factory in Longarone, in the Veneto region.







Bulgari's new, state-of-the-art production site opened last March in Valenza, Italy - LVMH



""This factory, once completed, will bring the total number of our production sites in Italy to 24, and will start operating in early 2018. We are building it with Marcolin, our eyewear partner, via the joint-venture company Thelios, in which we hold a 51% stake. The factory's initial output will be the Céline eyewear collections,"" said LVMH Group Managing Director Antonio Belloni, speaking at the opening ceremony for the group's Italian vocational training programme, held at the Institut des Métiers d’Excellence, LVMH's institute for luxury goods craftsmanship, in Florence.



""We manufacture 90% of our range in Europe, and over 80% of this output is sold outside the European borders. A large part of this output is produced in Italy,"" said Belloni, reminding his audience that LVMH employs 8,000 people in Italy, of whom 1,000 were hired in 2017, and operates 220 stores in the country, as well as featuring no less than seven Italian labels in its portfolio ( , Bulgari, Fendi, Loro Piana, , footwear manufacturer Rossimoda and the Cova café chain).

Between 2012 and 2016, the world luxury goods number one invested €100 million a year in Italy, a figure which in 2017 rose to €150 million, and the trend will not slow down in the next few years, as the group is busy on several other projects.



Speaking in Florence, Antonio Belloni confirmed that Céline's leather goods factory in Radda in Chianti, Tuscany, will be enlarged. Work will start in 2018 and the renovated factory will be fully operational in 2019. ""It is a question of bringing it to a new level, generating more jobs, with the workforce growing from the current number of 130 employees to 380-400,"" said Belloni.



The other new initiative regards Fendi. LVMH plans to eventually hire 350 employees, and build a factory specialised in leather goods in Bagno a Ripoli, close to Florence, where the group recently acquired a 90,000 m2 site, formerly home to a blast furnace. The factory will also be active in product development and prototype fabrication, with a section dedicated to exotic hides. Production is expected to start in summer 2019.







Antonio Belloni, LVMH's Group Managing Director - LVMH - LVMH



Still in Italy, the Loro Piana headquarters in Milan will change location in 2018, and will occupy the former premises of the Corriere della Sera newspaper in via Solferino. In Florence, LVMH is keen to make more use of Palazzo Pucci, the historic building still owned by the label's founding family, turning it into ""an activity hub for the group, and making it more accessible to the general public."" Besides the Emilio Pucci archives, the lavish building is also the Italian home of LVMH's institute for luxury goods craftsmanship.



Antonio Belloni hinted that LVMH is evaluating other major projects regarding its manufacturing activities in Italy, without adding any detail. Perhaps will be the next label to be involved.



As for the business forecast for 2018, the luxury giant, whose sales in the first nine months of this year grew by 14%, reaching €30.1 billion, is planning to ""do a little better than in 2017."" ""We will continue on a positive track, always taking into account potential geopolitical risk factors, and the slightly less favourable euro [exchange rate],"" concluded Antonio Belloni.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999924898147583}",neutral,0.9999924898147583,0
Another Arnault Steps Into the Spotlight - The New York Times,"Tue, 07 Nov 2017 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMTcvMTEvMDcvZmFzaGlvbi9sdm1oLXN0ZXBoYW5pZS13YXRpbmUtYXJuYXVsdC1jbG9zMTkuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"“I have always liked drinking Champagne,” said Stephanie Watine Arnault, the niece of Bernard Arnault, the chairman of the LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton luxury conglomerate, and reportedly France’s richest man — and the latest family member to step into the spotlight.

“I got a taste for it when I was very young and growing up in France,” Ms. Watine Arnault, said, tucking back a strand of her long blond hair. “My grandmother used to let me have sips at the dinner table. And that was that.”

Now she has convinced her uncle to help her share her taste with others. On Nov. 2, Clos19, LVMH’s first e-boutique and travel experience agency dedicated to Champagne, wines and spirits, had its debut in the United States, via a fizz-fueled soiree in New York. The focus of Ms. Watine Arnault’s brainchild, she said after the party, is on the “art of hosting” in the 21st century.

So what, one wonders, does that entail? Clos19 isn’t exactly an online bottle shop. Yes, you can order crates of LVMH’s finest drinks brands, like Dom Pérignon, Veuve Cliquot, Belvedere or Hennessy, to be delivered to your door in 24 hours. But you can also specify the temperature of the deliveries, and the glassware to go with it. Tastings or consultations with in-house experts will be regularly offered, as is event planning for weddings and dinner parties.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.999990701675415}",neutral,0.999990701675415,0

LVMH to buy control of Colgin Cellars in Napa - Decanter.com,"Wed, 22 Nov 2017 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlY2FudGVyLmNvbS93aW5lLW5ld3MvbHZtaC1idXlzLWNvbnRyb2wtb2YtbmFwYS13aW5lcnktY29sZ2luLWNlbGxhcnMtMzgwMTU4L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LVMH, the French luxury goods group that includes Krug and Dom Pérignon Champagne, has signed a deal to buy control of cult Napa winery Colgin Cellars, in the latest in a string of wine estate deals this year.

LVMH said last night (21 November) that it had agreed to buy 60% of Colgin Cellars, which has around 10.5 hectares of vines.

Colgin’s founder, Ann Colgin, and her husband, Joe Wender, will retain the other 40% of the wine business. A fee was not disclosed.

It marks a significant move in Napa Valley for LVMH and its owner, Bernard Arnault, who regularly features at the top of France’s rich lists and already has names such as Krug, Clos des Lambrays and Château d’Yquem.

Colgin’s wines, such as Tychson Hill Cabernet Sauvignon from the historic vineyard of that name near Calistoga, have developed something of a cult status among fine wine lovers since the estate was founded 25 years ago.

Others include Cariad and ‘IX Estate’ Syrah, and Colgin bottles are regular fixtures in wine lists in top restaurants.

Ann Colgin said, ‘After a social introduction to Mr. Arnault several months ago and discussions with the LVMH team, I realised that I could not find a better partner for Colgin Cellars to preserve our founding spirit and our exquisitely handcrafted red wines, into the future.’

LVMH indicated that little will change in the day-to-day running of Colgin, at least in the short-term.

‘Their talented winery team will continue to be led by Ann Colgin & Joe Wender along with COO, Paul Roberts and Winemaker, Allison Tauzie,’ it said.

The winery is located at the northern end of IX Estate in the Pritchard Hill area of Napa Valley.

It is the latest of several wine estate deals this year across California, France and Italy, in particular.

Sidney Toledano has been named chairman and CEO of the Fashion Group after 20 years at the helm of Christian Dior Couture, and will become a member of the LVMH executive committee. The CEOs of Céline, Givenchy, Loewe, Pucci, Kenzo, Marc Jacobs, Rossimoda and Nicholas Kirkwood will report to him.

Pietro Beccari has been appointed chairman and CEO of Christian Dior Couture after heading up Fendi since 2012. He also becomes a member of the LVMH executive committee.

Pierre-Yves Roussel has stepped down as head of the Fashion Group after ten years and becomes a special advisor to Bernard Arnault. He will shortly assume new operational responsibilities within the LVMH executive committee, of which he has been a member for 14 years.

“Sidney Toledano is the driving force behind the huge success of Christian Dior Couture across the world,” said Bernard Arnault, chairman and chief executive officer of LVMH. “Over the past 25 years, he has done an outstanding job of developing the exceptional House of Christian Dior Couture and of promoting its elegance and modernity through its highly talented team of designers. I want to offer my profound gratitude and am delighted that we will continue to work together and benefit from his expertise.”

“The appointment of Pietro Beccari as head of Christian Dior Couture signals a new era,” added Arnault. “Having been an integral member of our Group for 12 years, Pietro has an excellent track record. After several years as marketing director of Louis Vuitton, he oversaw strong growth at Fendi by expertly harnessing the creativity of Karl Lagerfeld and Silvia Venturini Fendi and closely aligning it to the Roman influence of the House. He will be an excellent leader who will steer Dior towards ever greater success in the future.”

These appointments will take effect from the beginning of 2018. The new CEO of Fendi will be announced in the near future.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.841830849647522}",positive,0.841830849647522,1

Launched in the United States just a few weeks ago, Clos19 is a new e-commerce platform backed by luxury giant LMVH that doesn’t just focus on facilitating purchases, but also on providing the shopper with a holistic experience that includes education and access to experts, unique services, and special opportunities.

Initially launched in the U.K. and Germany earlier this year, Clos19 has expanded to offer its massive selection of LMVH wine and spirits to customers in the United States. In addition to the big names one would expect—Hennessey, Glenmorangie, Krug, Dom Perignon—the service also offers releases from some of the conglomerate’s smaller holdings like Volcan de mi Terra and Newton Vineyards. As part of the effort to make Clos19 feel like a complete lifestyle platform rather than a simple company storefront, many of the product pages offer a ton of extra information to help you get the most out of your purchase, like pairing and serving suggestions. You can also find cocktail recipes, expert tasting notes, and additional information about the release’s ingredients and creation; there’s even a handy but unobtrusive bottle size guide on wine and Champagne pages.

The website is simple and easy to navigate, but it houses a surprising amount of content if you dig in. Although focusing mostly on its brand’s standard and premium offerings, there are also sections in each of its main categories for rare and vintage bottles, including Glenmorangie Pride 1974 and Krug Clos d’Ambonnay 2000. For hosts, there is a large collection of cocktail-making videos and even a party-planning tool that will recommend wines, spirits, and accessories for your particular event. Want an even more intimate experience? Clos19’s Become the Host series will bring the party to you with masterclasses and tastings hosted by the company’s experts. One of its current offerings, for instance, comprises an in-home party for you and 10 guests that includes a mixology class and a backgammon tournament. (Follow the link to read an article in which we explore Clos19’s premium travel experiences in greater detail.)

For now, Clos19 is only available in New York and California, though it plans to roll out its service in Texas, Florida, and Illinois—as well as a few additional foreign markets—next year.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999796152114868}",neutral,0.9999796152114868,0

Founder and CEO Stephanie Watine Arnault hosted the night alongside three co-hosts -- Derek Blasberg, Cecilia Dean and Heron Preston -- who each presided over separate (and separately-themed) dinner parties-within-a dinner party at a gallery space in Chelsea. Over a dinner of black cod and burrata along with, of course, copious glasses of wine and champagne from LVMH's portfolio, guests learned a bit more about Clos19. Launched in the U.S. last week (they already have a presence in the UK and Germany), Arnault says the site aims to bring access to ""bottles of champagne, wine and spirits"" to consumers via licensed retailers facilitated by Thirstie through its independent retailer network as well as offering ""accessories around the 'perfect serve' and experiences."" Of the last, these experiences may include the ability to bring a sommelier or mixologist to your dinner party as well as trips to explore terroir as varied as New Zealand and Antarctica. (In this last case, the trip is to explore how wines and spirits change depending on where you drink them.)Available now for consumers in New York and California, Arnault says the site has plans to expand to more states in 2018.

Millennials Demand Transparency From Luxury Brands - Jing Daily,"Tue, 21 Nov 2017 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiOWh0dHBzOi8vamluZ2RhaWx5LmNvbS9wb3N0cy9jb25zdW1lcnMtbHV4dXJ5LWF1dGhlbnRpY2l0edIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Bernard Arnault, the billionaire head of the French luxury goods group LVMH once remarked, “What we create is emblematic. It’s linked to Versailles, to Marie Antoinette.”

His message enhanced the mystique surrounding the company’s number one brand, Louis Vuitton. Louis Vuitton, he inferred, reflected the elegance and nobility of France's Ancien Régime and its most iconic piece of architecture, at least before its gates were breached by starving peasants and Marie Antoinette executed.

Arnault’s 40-year-old son Antoine, a board member of LVMH and the CEO of Berluti, is of another generation. Seizing upon the mood of new and future consumers, he spoke at The New York Times Luxury Conference in mid-November that the industry’s competitive edge is now won by, “transparency in communicating.”

He is “outer-directed” and argues that the mystery and romance of a brand flourish when its doors are opened, if selectively, to reveal what's happening behind the scenes.

Speaking to Vanessa Friedman the NYT’s fashion director at the Brussels’ summit, Arnault discussed the company's first commitments to transparency, when LVMH introduced a meet-the artisans initiative called journées particulières.

“In 2011 more than 100,000 people came to see 30 production sites the first weekend,” he said. LVMH, a company with 60-plus luxury brands, had chosen to throw open its doors to around 50 percent of its ateliers.

It was an unprecedented move when fans learned about a product in the making, from design to the finished handbag. In the case of Louis Vuitton, they saw bags being hand-stitched by artisans.

Arnault said the event was as much about the “sincerity of the artisans who wanted to show and share their skills” as it was about the guests.

It is axiomatic to Arnault that there can be no secrets from the millennial generation. These consumers are absolutely clear: they see nothing forgivable in keeping secrets.

In a single address Arnault nailed the theme of the newspaper’s Brussels conference, titled: “What’s Next: Luxury in a Turbulent World.”

Speakers consistently addressed the question of millennials, a generation of “digital natives” who demand transparency and authenticity at a time when luxury is becoming institutional. There are more and more brands and fewer companies.

Stella McCartney, who is the founder of the sustainable luxury fashion label that bears her name, acknowledged the word “authenticity” as the buzzword for this generation.

“We started authenticity,” she confidently told the audience. “We trot it out all the time but if we have a relationship with this generation it’s because we haven’t actively gone out and targeted them. We don’t fake it, we don’t pay people. The design process is so heartfelt at Stella McCartney. I don’t have to try too hard, I think people believe when its honest and know when its not.”

While the 400-plus million millennial, Chinese consumers are front of mind for the European luxury industry, Amarta Banta, managing director of Agility Research & Strategy, provided insights about another demographic: the current spenders, a class of Chinese millionaires.

Agility, a global research company with a focus on affluent consumers in Asia, knows the world wants to welcome Chinese visitors. These travelers may be engaged by a brand at home but they shop in the wider world.

It’s a given that most Chinese millionaires are debt free, but highlighting their spending priorities Banta pointed to their focus on the “experiential” and their surging interest in fitness and health.

“They are spending on spas, organic food, diet, and personal trainers,” she said. “They are looking after their health and while 56% buy products and services on mobile phones, their ease with the digital world also allows them to find the best value which they prioritize.”

Banta said for the millionaire class the top 5 purchases in the next 12 months will be on jewellery, travel experiences, airline tickets, entertainment, and fashion, in that order.

According to Agility’s report, this is the state of millionaire spending: their top four obsessions are shopping (59 percent), fine dining (49 percent), cinema/movies (45 percent), and wine tasting (41 percent). They spend approximately the same amount on leisure travel and jewelry and watches. The breakdown of their consumption looks like this: travel 25 percent, watches and jewelry 20 percent, fashion 14 percent, food and entertainment 13 percent, beauty 10 percent, art and electronics (an unusual grouping) 14 percent, and health 4 percent.

These spenders still put a high value on in-store shopping and presume a customized experience, appreciating more bang for their buck. They want to feel special with the offer of a loyalty program or an invitation to an in-store event. The strategy is all about connecting directly with their demographic. Take their details, stay in touch. It’s meaningful for them.

In fact, less than a fifth of their luxury possession are bought online and while searching for the best prices, many skip the boutique and find their way to luxury outlet malls. Agility’s report states that around 25% make their luxury purchases at outlets abroad. Outlets like La Vallee Village, a purpose-built village outside Paris requiring a 45-minute bus ride, have proven particularly popular among this demographic.

The top five fashion brands this crowd owns are no surprise, Chanel, Dior, Hermes, Louis Vuitton, and Gucci in that order. They say they trust social media influencers more than celebrities.

If forecasting is key, speaker Julie Wainwright, the founder of The RealReal, may have more insights than the brands themselves.

Wainwright’s online luxury store has 200,000 sellers and marries an in-store experience with e-commerce and she sells authenticated luxury on consignment. It’s not unusual for her to sell a product valued at 100,000.

“We often know when a brand is in decline because we see the re-sale value dropping first. So we know before the brands do,” she said. Not only that, but Wainwright sees a future for The RealReal in China. “Yes, one day we will be an international brand and sell in China.” That day may not be far away given The RealReal’s rapid rise.

Wainwright applauded McCartney for her commitment to sustainable fashion, saying, “Authenticity will win over branding because values matter.”

As big name luxury is less and less consumed by Europeans, panelists at this conference were united on the big challenge of connecting to the middle-class Chinese consumer.

“Luxury is emotional and people buy it because it represents something,” said Jonathan Akeroyd, chief executive of Gianni Versace. He said Donatella Versace was not taken seriously until she started to share her story on social media, two years ago. “Her credibility is incredible now. Consumers expect you are making more than clothes.”

Jean-Marc Loubier, president of First Heritage Brands that counts Delvaux among its brands, said every company has to insist on its values. “We have a responsibility and a logo must bring something of value.”

In terms of communicating the message Arnault offered a key example. “When LVMH acquired Loro Piana, a 60-year old Italian company that specializes in cashmere, it had never advertised,” he said. That swiftly changed as the company shared its message. Referencing the location of the LVMH executive offices, Arnault said, “I am of a new generation, the 9th floor understands change. They understand my generation.”

The future, this conference concluded, is inclusion, not exclusion.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.999972939491272}",neutral,0.999972939491272,0
"From Gucci to Calvin Klein, Where Top Fashion Brands Recruit - The Business of Fashion","Fri, 03 Nov 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzb2ZmYXNoaW9uLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy93b3JrcGxhY2UtdGFsZW50L2Zyb20tZ3VjY2ktdG8tY2FsdmluLWtsZWluLXdoZXJlLXRvcC1mYXNoaW9uLWJyYW5kcy1yZWNydWl0L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LONDON, United Kingdom — Want to work at Tommy Hilfiger's design headquarters in Amsterdam? Consider applying to Kingston University. Its students have collaborated on projects with the PVH-owned brand. Passionate about tailoring? Brioni, the menswear house owned by Kering, partners with London's Royal College of Art each school year to hold talent competitions and recruit interns.

Gone are the days of the shot-in-the-dark application. In order to burnish their reputations as employers and recruit top talent, leading luxury houses are developing formal programmes with the best universities. These feeder programmes — from Kering's partnership with the Centre for Sustainable Fashion (CSF) at the London College of Fashion to Sup de Luxe at Paris' École des Dirigeants et des Créateurs d'entreprise (ECF), which offers both a master's and bachelor's degree in global luxury management and is supported financially by Richemont-owned Cartier — are now often the key to landing an entry-level position at a top fashion company.

""It's more about partnerships these days,"" says Karen Harvey, an executive recruiter who places c-level candidates in positions on both the creative and business sides of fashion. ""Through these long-term relationships, companies get to meet with the students more than once or twice. It's not just about glancing through their portfolios.""

But which schools offer opportunities at which brands? BoF examined three of the industry’s top conglomerates to identify both formal and informal partnerships between their labels and the world’s leading fashion schools.

Kering

Top Brands: Gucci, Saint Laurent, Bottega Veneta, Balenciaga, Stella McCartney, Alexander McQueen, Brioni.

Kering's formal programmes with universities span both disciplines and regions. ""A key objective of the group is to attract, recruit and develop the best people for every aspect of our activities, wherever they may be,"" a spokesperson for the group told BoF. ""We want to create an environment where each of us is encouraged to learn, to grow, to fulfil our potential and to have a positive impact. Diversity in the workplace — of gender, nationality, age, background, sexual orientation and talent — enriches us all and is a key driver of creativity and growth.""

For MBAs, the luxury group sponsors the “Kering Luxury Certificate” at international business school HEC in Paris. The programme includes seminars led by Kering managers and visits to Kering brands, as well as an annual competition judged by HEC professors and Kering directors. In 2017, 38 participants from 15 different countries were admitted into the programme, which, according to Kering, regularly results in appointments within the group.

On the creative side, Kering participates in several initiatives, including its partnership with the London College of Fashion's Centre for Sustainable Fashion (CSF), which includes a master's course in sustainability supported by the company as well as the annual Kering Award for Sustainable Fashion — a monetary prize and/or an internship placement — and an annual talk given by a Kering executive. (At this year's talk in October, Gucci chief executive Marco Bizzarri announced that the white-hot brand would no longer use real fur in its clothing and accessories.)

At Parsons School of Design in New York, Kering awards two BFA fashion design graduates the opportunity to intern or apprentice at one of its brands, while its partnership with the University of Tsinghua in Beijing includes two programmes: the artistic innovation studio, which helps students create their own workspace, and a scheme that offers financial support to 10 female students.

There are also more specialised programmes within Kering's brands, including a partnership between La Scuola dei Maestri Pellettieri, Bottega Veneta's workshop, and University IUAV of Venice, which offers post-graduate training in creating handbags and other accessories. At Brioni, tailors are trained through its own sewing school — Scuola di Alta Sartoria — while other talent is tapped through the Royal College of Art, where the brand supports competitions and recruits interns. Gucci recently partnered with Italian fashion school Polimoda to launch a master's course in fashion retail management.

LVMH

Top brands: Louis Vuitton, Céline, Givenchy, Dior, Loewe, Marc Jacobs.

With more than 70 maisons under its umbrella, it's no surprise that LVMH's formalised partnerships are quite varied. While the company recruits from traditional design schools including Institut Français de la Mode, Central Saint Martins and Parsons School of Design, it also looks to Harvard Business School, INSEAD and HEC to hire MBAs.

At ESSEC business school outside of Paris, students can be selected for the LVMH chair, a luxury brand-management programme with seminars led by LVMH managers, complemented by company visits and internships. Students also get to work on a real-life project with an LVMH brand manager. LVMH and Dom Pérignon also support ESSEC’s “Savoir-Faire d’exception” chair, a 20-student course that explores the importance of heritage in the luxury industry.

At HEC Paris, LVMH supports a chair in general management in excellence and client experience. Prospective students interested in supply chain and logistics might look to engineering university CentraleSupélec, where the group backs a course on the topic. Milan’s Bocconi University has established a fashion and luxury management professorship in partnership with LVMH, which also supports the luxury track of its MBA programme. In Asia, the conglomerate has teamed with Singapore Management University on a research initiative that aims to shed light on the luxury goods market in the East through unbiased case studies and field reporting.

On the design and creative side, LVMH often recruits interns and entry-level designers from Central Saint Martins as well as Parsons School of Design. In 2016, the group launched ""Sustainability and Innovation in Luxury,"" a strategic partnership with Central Saint Martins to identify ""cutting-edge solutions to address future sustainability and innovation in luxury."" LMVH also offers vocational training through its Institut des Métiers d’Excellence (IME).

For Burak Cakmak, dean of fashion at Parsons, formalised partnerships are not only about work placement, but also about résumé building.

""The immediate benefit for a brand is the ability to learn from the talent and to be able to hire the individual,"" Cakmak says. ""But it will always be a small number of students who achieve that. No matter if you are directly hired, what matters is what you have on your CV and diversity is critical.""

Top brands: Calvin Klein, Tommy Hilfiger.

The New York-based group welcomes 300 to 350 summer interns into its 10-week programme. And that's not including those placed in its offices in Europe. (PVH hires 20-25 percent of its interns each year.) ""They do real work,"" says Dave Kozel, executive vice president and chief human resources officer at PVH. At Calvin Klein, 50 new interns are welcomed each semester.

PVH has working relationships with more than 250 schools globally. While many senior executives graduated from schools located on the east coast of the United States — including the Fashion Institute of Technology, Philadelphia University and the Savannah College of Art and Design — certain schools are pinpointed for certain skills.

For instance, Lehigh University and Penn State University, both in Pennsylvania, often breed good candidates for supply-chain related jobs, while the University of Delaware boasts a strong fashion-merchandising programme. Parsons and FIT are the primary feeders for entry-level design positions. In Europe, PVH regularly works with the London College of Fashion and Kingston University, as well as Hong Kong University in Asia.

Meet the man who made Kendall Jenner walk on water - Style,"Fri, 17 Nov 2017 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjbXAuY29tL21hZ2F6aW5lcy9zdHlsZS9mYXNoaW9uLWJlYXV0eS9hcnRpY2xlLzIxMjAzNDEvbWVldC1kaW9ycy1uZXctbWFuLXdoby1tYWRlLWtlbmRhbGwtamVubmVyLXdhbGstd2F0ZXLSAXlodHRwczovL2FtcC5zY21wLmNvbS9tYWdhemluZXMvc3R5bGUvZmFzaGlvbi1iZWF1dHkvYXJ0aWNsZS8yMTIwMzQxL21lZXQtZGlvcnMtbmV3LW1hbi13aG8tbWFkZS1rZW5kYWxsLWplbm5lci13YWxrLXdhdGVy?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Beccari, CEO of the Italian fur-and-leather purveyor, has been tapped by parent LVMH to take over leadership of Christian Dior Couture in early 2018. Over the past five years, he has moved Fendi to the forefront of luxury branding, offering customers a full-immersion experience ranging from eye-catching stores and a whimsical e-commerce site to a boutique hotel and one of chef Rainer Becker’s trendy Zuma restaurants in the Roman palazzo that houses its flagship store.

At luxury house Fendi , Pietro Beccari made Kendall Jenner walk on water. His next assignment: to make Christian Dior fly again.

The Fendi chief cemented the brand’s ties to the Italian capital, adding the word Roma to the logo and moving into a new headquarters at the long-abandoned Palazzo della Civilta Italiana, a marble block dating to the Mussolini era.

Behind the arched facade, the building houses art exhibitions, fur ateliers and executives suites. The brand sponsors art exhibits and cultural restoration projects, and staged a runway show last year in which Jenner and other models traversed a plexiglass runway atop the Trevi Fountain – a Roman landmark that had been renovated under the brand’s sponsorship.

“Beccari has done an amazing job of taking the craft of the house and using it in a very modern way,” Elizabeth von der Goltz, global buying director at online luxury retailer Net-a-Porter, says. “At Dior, there’s something to be done in terms of modernising their communications – making it more playful.”

New look

Beccari’s challenge will be to take Dior, the first luxury asset French billionaire Bernard Arnault acquired on the way to assembling industry leader LVMH, and restore its status as a trendsetter. While the brand’s tight-waisted “New Look” helped revive the French fashion industry after the second world war and its clients have run the gamut from Ava Gardner to Melania Trump, it’s become an elder statesman in an industry being revived by designers like Gucci ’s Alessandro Michele.

Under Sidney Toledano, who’s moving on from his position as Dior CEO to a supervisory role at other LVMH brands, Dior has been one of the steadiest performers in fashion, growing an average of 12 per cent a year since 2000. But the output of chief designer Maria Grazia Chiuri, hired in 2016 as the first woman creative director since Dior’s founding in 1946, has drawn mixed reviews.

Menswear collections by Kris Van Assche pass largely unnoticed – a far cry from the agenda-setting power the brand enjoyed a decade ago when Hedi Slimane’s skinny suits and jeans set the pace for the industry.

Meanwhile, the luxury industry’s changing fast. Gone are the days when growth could be achieved simply by opening another store in China, or even by designing a generation’s must-have handbag or heels. Led by millennials newly attuned to the allure of high fashion, consumers visit stores to envelop themselves in the brand and its provenance – and then do their buying at home, online.

“Dior needs a rejuvenation,” particularly online, says Marco Pozzi, senior adviser at Milan-based digital marketing consultancy ContactLab. LVMH declined to make Beccari available for an interview.

The Fendi chief, 50, carried out a multipronged revamp after taking over in 2012 following a six-year stint as marketing and communications director at LVMH’s Louis Vuitton . Under his leadership, Fendi doubled down on its identity as a specialist in high-end leather and furs, ditching entry-level logo-printed canvas handbags to focus on US$4,000 Peekaboo bags, US$12,000 fox-fur coats and intricate, handmade fur ensembles that can cost as much as US$1 million.

Fendi hasn’t ignored its retail network, opening new stores in Australia, Japan and the US, including boutiques in New York, San Francisco and Dallas. Rather than sitting on shelves against cold marble, handbags are suspended amid a wall of golden wands. Entry-level shoppers can still get “bag bugs” – furry charms to personalise their handbags – for US$650 and up.

The website’s holiday gift guide invites shoppers to explore “Fendi Land” – an animated depiction of a carnival that walks them through the brand’s range. Fendi under Beccari “has become a top performer in terms of how to convey a luxury experience to clients when they purchase online”, Pozzi says.

While those investments have been costly, Fendi’s expanded scale helps to offset the expense, says Rogerio Fujimori, a luxury analyst at RBC Capital Markets in London. LVMH doesn’t break out figures for individual brands, but RBC says Fendi has sales of about US$1.1 billion, with a profit margin over 20 per cent. Fujimori estimates that Dior’s margin, as gauged by earnings before interest and taxes, is in the low teens.

Beccari should be able to improve profitability at Dior, Fujimori says, “because of the power of the brand, its scale”.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999879598617554}",neutral,0.9999879598617554,0
Dior’s Sidney Toledano to step down after 20 years - Style,"Thu, 09 Nov 2017 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjbXAuY29tL21hZ2F6aW5lcy9zdHlsZS9uZXdzLXRyZW5kcy9hcnRpY2xlLzIxMTkwODAvZGlvcnMtc2lkbmV5LXRvbGVkYW5vLXN0ZXAtZG93bi1hZnRlci0yMC15ZWFycy1mZW5kadIBdWh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLnNjbXAuY29tL21hZ2F6aW5lcy9zdHlsZS9uZXdzLXRyZW5kcy9hcnRpY2xlLzIxMTkwODAvZGlvcnMtc2lkbmV5LXRvbGVkYW5vLXN0ZXAtZG93bi1hZnRlci0yMC15ZWFycy1mZW5kaQ?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"“He will be an excellent leader who will steer Dior towards ever greater success,” LVMH’s chairman and chief executive, billionaire Bernard Arnault, said.

New boss Pietro Beccari, 50, took the Italian Fendi brand further upmarket and gave it a zestier feel. Sales for the brand – known for its fur coats – crossed the 1 billion-euro threshold last year.

Christian Dior ’s chief executive Sidney Toledano will step down after 20 years to take on a broader fashion role at parent LVMH in a reshuffle that propels the boss of stablemate Fendi to the top of Dior.

Toledano, who was born in Casablanca and is 66, is credited with boosting sales at Dior and steering the couture house through various cycles of designers.

He will now head a broader fashion group within LVMH and be named to LVMH’s executive committee, the company said, as will Beccari.

The generational shift at Dior comes months after LVMH, the world’s biggest luxury goods company, brought the couture part of the label in-house for US$7.5 billion, uniting it with the perfume and beauty offshoots.

The deal boosted LVMH earnings at a time when luxury goods sales are riding high on revived demand from Chinese consumers.

Arnault said Toledano, who will now have brands such as Givenchy, Celine and Marc Jacobs under his mantle, had been “the driving force behind the huge success of Christian Dior Couture across the world.”

Dior’s sales have doubled over the past five years. Under Toledano, who ran Dior’s leather goods unit before taking the top role in 1998, the label released its hit Lady Dior handbag, still a staple for the 70-year-old brand.

Toledano also extended Dior’s store network, which stands at close to 200 worldwide, cut the brand’s reliance on third-party distributors and put the onus on developing its craftsmanship on products such as its handmade bags.

Under his tenure, Dior fired designer John Galliano in 2011 after a notorious anti-Semitic outburst.

Changing of the guard

Rival luxury labels are also going through management change as they rush to try and make the most of an industry upturn and deal with challenges such as moving online, which many were slow to address.

Italy’s Gucci , part of Kering, has enjoyed a sales boom over the past two years under a new CEO-designer team.

Britain’s Burberry, where sales have been more sluggish, recently switched CEOs and said last week it was parting ways with its long-time designer.

After its own long search to replace another creative head, Raf Simons , Dior appointed its latest artistic director – and first female top designer – Maria Grazia Chiuri , formerly of Valentino, in 2016.

Also part of the reshuffle announced on Wednesday – which takes effect in early 2018 – the former head of the fashion group Pierre-Yves Roussel will become a special adviser to Arnault.

Arnault, 68, has recently brought in new staff, with analysts saying the firm was preparing for a series of successions at its labels.

LVMH hired Nicola Brandolese from Italian eyewear maker Luxottica this year, where he was head of retail. Brandolese initially took on an unspecified role at Fendi, and his new position within LVMH is expected to be announced by early next year.

LVMH said Beccari’s replacement would be announced soon.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.7438532710075378}",positive,0.7438532710075378,1

“It’s a nice moment for me because Dior is on a high and so am I, with a terrific team. It’s a carefully considered decision, but one that didn’t take long,” Toledano told WWD in an exclusive interview.

“This job that Bernard Arnault is entrusting me with allows me to switch to a different type of management. It’s an important wish on my part,” he said. “I am passionate about transmission. I have no more career ego to prove, but I am so happy to pass things on. It’s mentoring, it’s coaching, it’s guidance.”

Beccari will join Dior from Fendi, which he helped to propel beyond the billion-euro revenue mark by dropping its ubiquitous logo bags in favor of more upscale products, in addition to developing lifestyle destinations like Palazzo Fendi in Rome, comprising a boutique hotel and Zuma restaurant.

“The Dior Maison has enormous prestige and I approach it with much humility,” the Italian executive said in a separate interview. “I will inject all my passion and commitment [into Dior], as well as a dose of ambition. I hope to continue to build a company that represents so much for France and for the Arnault family.”

The nominations follow months of speculation following LVMH’s 6.5-billion-euro acquisition of Christian Dior Couture in July, reuniting its fashion and fragrance activities under a single umbrella, and making Dior the second-largest brand in the group’s fashion division, behind Louis Vuitton and ahead of Fendi.

The house is celebrating its 70th anniversary this year with events including a retrospective at Les Arts Décoratifs in Paris that has broken attendance records at the museum.

“The appointment of Pietro Beccari as head of Christian Dior Couture signals a new era,” Arnault said in a statement. “He will be an excellent leader who will steer Dior towards ever greater success in the future.”

Arnault credited Toledano as the “driving force” behind Dior’s success over the last 25 years. “I want to offer my profound gratitude and am delighted that we will continue to work together and benefit from his expertise,” he said.

Toledano joined Dior in 1994, rapidly making his mark with the launch of the Lady Dior handbag, which remains a bestseller for the brand. He was promoted to ceo in 1998, and since then has overseen a tenfold increase in the brand’s revenues.

He will take over as chairman and ceo of the Fashion Group from Pierre-Yves Roussel, who will remain as a special advisor to Arnault, the group said. The heads of Céline, Givenchy, Kenzo, Loewe, Marc Jacobs, Pucci, Rossi Moda and Nicholas Kirkwood will report to Toledano.

Roussel will take on new operational responsibilities with the LVMH executive committee, of which he has been a member for 14 years, but the executive told WWD he plans to take some time off first.

Arnault thanked Roussel for his “excellent” work at the Fashion Group over the last decade. “In particular, he has played an instrumental role in the selection of the best creative talents and in implementing innovative strategies and high-performing teams within the different houses,” the LVMH chief said.

Toledano and Beccari will become members of LVMH’s executive committee. The appointments will take effect from the beginning of 2018.

Beccari will help find a successor at Fendi, effectively stepping into the Dior role and moving to Paris in February. He expressed his pride and gratitude for being offered such a position, adding that he “will try to pay back with sound results, which is what is expected of me.”

He also conceded a pinch of sadness at leaving Fendi, where he took over as ceo in 2012, succeeding Michael Burke. “I leave with pride in what has been achieved for the label. Things will take place step by step but there are big changes at the group level, ushering in a new era,” he said.

Toledano said he expects revenues at Christian Dior Couture to exceed 2 billion euros in 2017. Including the beauty division, retail equivalent sales will total around 8 billion euros in 2017, Exane BNP Paribas estimates. The calculation applies a multiplier to wholesale and license sales to derive the retail sales value.

Toledano wouldn’t comment on that estimate, but said Dior still has plenty of room to grow. “Pietro will know how to do it. I have complete faith in him and I will definitely help him,” he said. “We have known each other since he joined the group.”

During his tenure, Toledano transformed the company from a licensing-driven operation to one centered on control of production and distribution. The brand now makes 95 percent of its sales through its own stores and has a single license left with Safilo for eyewear.

A right brain-left brain type, the executive has a knack for managing creative leaders — who at Dior include not only a couturier, but dedicated designers for men’s wear, fine jewelry and watches, home wares and Baby Dior.

“I am passionate about this brand, passionate about the people, having worked with all these designers,” he said, reeling off the names of John Galliano, Hedi Slimane, Maria Grazia Chiuri, Raf Simons, Kris Van Assche and Victoire de Castellane.

Toledano added that Chiuri would remain as creative director of women’s wear at Dior. “The creative direction will continue, absolutely,” he said.

Beccari sees his move to Paris as “a return home” given his past experience at Vuitton. “That said, I will miss Rome, its beauty, its blue skies and its light,” he added.

The executive joined Vuitton in 2006 from consumer products giant Henkel as director of strategy and marketing coordination, ultimately taking on responsibility for business units including ready-to-wear and accessories.

From 2009, he held the role of executive vice president of communications and marketing with worldwide responsibilities. He dramatically developed both the accessories and ready-to-wear businesses, working with then artistic director Marc Jacobs, and rose in the ranks to become executive vice president.

Beccari is close to Antoine Arnault, ceo of Berluti and a director at LVMH, with whom he worked at Vuitton. Beccari is also supervisory board president at Berluti.

A native of Parma, Italy, he once played soccer professionally, and started his career in international marketing at consumer products giant Reckitt Benckiser in Milan. He went on to work for Parmalat in New York for a couple of years before joining Henkel in Germany, where he worked for 10 years.

Beccari, 50, speaks fluent French, English and German, is married and has three daughters. Affable, eloquent and driven, he has elevated the luxury quotient of Fendi and its overall perception, emphasizing its links to the city of Rome with a deeper focus on its fur roots and its craftsmanship.

Fendi’s target customer has grown more sophisticated and younger during this process.

Beccari masterminded the restoration of the company’s new headquarters at the stately Palazzo della Civiltà, opening the ground floor to the city as an exhibition space. Since 2015, more than 100,000 visitors have flocked to the venue, from young university students and families to tourists.

He has invested in Fendi’s promotion of the arts, most recently inking a partnership with the Rome-based art museum Galleria Borghese.

Beccari has also spearheaded several initiatives to reinforce the relationship between Fendi and the city of Rome, including the restoration of several fountains in the city including the Trevi Fountain, where a spectacular Haute Fourrure show marking the brand’s 90th anniversary was held in July last year.

The show was a first for the Baroque monument, with a catwalk placed on the water and the closure of four neighboring streets on a busy summer day. “I refuse to look at projects that are not ambitious enough,” Beccari said at the time. “We must think big. Surprise me.”

Meanwhile, Roussel told WWD he hopes to take “a couple of months” off to “refresh” himself before taking on a new role in the sprawling French group. He declined to comment on what that post might be.

To be sure, he’s had a fruitful tenure shepherding and growing LVMH’s so-called second-tier brands, which a decade ago analysts were urging Arnault to sell so as not to distract from cash-cow brands such as Vuitton, Parfums Christian Dior and Dom Perignon.

Most were small and loss-making when Roussel arrived, giving him the freedom to experiment with new strains of creative leadership, famously recruiting fashion star Phoebe Philo to reinvent Céline in her own image, sweeping out all the old products and pressing the reset button.

He hired retailers Humberto Leon and Carol Lim of Opening Ceremony to transform Kenzo from a moribund designer label to a zesty, contemporary player riding the streetwear craze with its tiger sweatshirts, logo caps and skater shoes.

And most recently he installed fashion wunderkind Jonathan Anderson to rev up Loewe with his crafty, cultural mien.

It is understood the Fashion Group tripled in size under Roussel’s watch, with some brands multiplying five, six and seven times. Roussel said that proves that Arnault’s vision “of having a large portfolio of brands can be successful.”

He noted that “we could have grown those brands even faster, but we’ve been very controlled.” He cited two mantras – “experimenting within a vision” and “agility with focus” – as his guiding principles, along with the belief that “talent is everything.”

“As long as there is interest and appetite in fashion, then the game is how do you make your brands relevant and desirable in that space,” he said. “If you don’t experiment and try things, you’re stuck.

“Fashion is a continuous challenge,” he added. Indeed, not all brands in the group have found their groove, with Pucci still seeking the right creative formula, and Marc Jacobs in the midst of a turnaround.

While he insists it wasn’t intentional, Roussel also brought greater gender parity to his division. Most recently, he recruited Sylvie Colin from the contemporary fashion brand Maje, to helm Kenzo. She started Sept. 25.

Colin is the third female executive to arrive at the helm of an LVMH fashion house in the past year. Roussel tapped Berluti’s Séverine Merle to succeed Marco Gobbetti at Céline and Pascale Lepoivre, the number-two executive at Céline, to take the helm of Loewe.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9988590478897095}",neutral,0.9988590478897095,0

Dior's sales have doubled over the past five years. Under Toledano, who ran Dior's leather goods unit before taking the top role in 1998, the label released its hit Lady Dior handbag, still a staple for the 70-year-old brand.

Toledano also extended Dior's store network, which stands at close to 200 worldwide, cut the brand's reliance on third-party distributors and put the onus on developing its craftsmanship on products such as its handmade bags.

Under his tenure, Dior fired designer John Galliano in 2011 after a notorious anti-Semitic outburst.

CHANGING OF THE GUARD

Rival luxury labels are also going through management change as they rush to try and make the most of an industry upturn and deal with challenges such as moving online, which many were slow to address.

Italy's Gucci, part of Kering <PRTP.PA>, has enjoyed a sales boom over the past two years under a new CEO-designer team.

Britain's Burberry <BRBY.L>, where sales have been more sluggish, recently switched CEOs and said last week it was parting ways with its long-time designer.

After its own long search to replace another creative head, Raf Simons, Dior appointed its latest artistic director - and first female top designer - Maria Grazia Chiuri, formerly of Valentino, in 2016.

Also part of the reshuffle announced on Wednesday - which takes effect in early 2018 - the former head of the fashion group Pierre-Yves Roussel will become a special advisor to Arnault.

Arnault, 68, has recently brought in new staff, with analysts saying the firm was preparing for a series of successions at its labels.

LVMH hired Nicola Brandolese from Italian eyewear maker Luxottica <LUX.MI> this year, where he was head of retail. Brandolese initially took on an unspecified role at Fendi, and his new position within LVMH is expected to be announced by early next year.

LVMH said Beccari's replacement would be announced soon.

He becomes a member of the LVMH executive committee, and the CEOs of Celine, Givenchy, Loewe, Pucci, Kenzo, Marc Jacobs, Rossimoda and Nicholas Kirkwood will report to him.

Pietro Beccari has been appointed chairman/CEO of Christian Dior Couture after heading up Fendi since 2012, and also joins the executive committee. Fendi’s new CEO is yet to be appointed.

Also, Pierre-Yves Roussel steps down from being chairman/CEO of LVMH’s fashion group after 10 years to become special advisor to Bernard Arnault, who has controlling interest of LVMH. Roussel will also assume new management responsibilities on the executive committee, of which he has been a member for 14 years.

“Sidney Toledano is the driving force behind the huge success of Christian Dior Couture across the world,” says Arnault. “He has done an outstanding job of developing the exceptional house of Christian Dior Couture and of promoting its elegance and modernity through its highly talented team of designers.”

Arnault says Beccari’s appointment signals a new era for Christian Dior. “Having been an integral member of our group for 12 years, Pietro has an excellent track record. After several years as marketing director of Louis Vuitton, he oversaw strong growth at Fendi by expertly harnessing the creativity of Karl Lagerfeld and Silvia Venturini Fendi.”

The appointments take effect in January.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9906003475189209}",neutral,0.9906003475189209,0
Buy into LVMH excellence - Investors Chronicle,"Thu, 16 Nov 2017 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmludmVzdG9yc2Nocm9uaWNsZS5jby51ay90aXBzLWlkZWFzLzIwMTcvMTEvMTYvYnV5LWludG8tbHZtaC1leGNlbGxlbmNlL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The world of luxury retail is enjoying a bumper year thanks to the relative strength of the US dollar against global currencies and strong demand from well-heeled international shoppers. In our view, the premium demanded for shares in Paris-listed luxury conglomerate LVMH (FR:MC.) is justified when compared with the peer group, and especially London-listed rivals. Indeed, Burberry (BRBY) is bogged down in a managerial and strategic quagmire after chief designer Christopher Bailey announced plans to leave the brand, while Mulberry’s (MUL) valuation remains prohibitive for new investors. Jimmy Choo (CHOO) is also in the middle of a complex takeover process by US group Michael Kors (US:KORS). Crucially, these businesses remain single-brand, whereas LVMH owns brands spanning several luxury product categories – thus insulating it from volatility created by short-term trends in any one market.

LVMH revealed strong 12 per cent sales growth for the third quarter, comfortably beating consensus expectations of 9 per cent and outperforming market expectations in pretty much every division. The exception was wine and spirits, where supply constraints held back growth. We feel LVMH can be forgiven for this as the performance was in line with previous guidance and forecasting the demand high-end tipples such as cognac is challenging due to the long lead time associated with ageing the colourless fruit brandy Eau-de-Vie.

Elsewhere, fashion and leather goods – the division that accounts for the lion’s share of group earnings – grew sales by 13 per cent (versus a 9 per cent estimate), supported by the launch of the first Louis Vuitton smart watch, development of the distribution network and the consolidation of the additional stake taken in Parisian couture house Christian Dior earlier this year. Perfumes and cosmetics was the clear outperformer, growing sales 17 per cent (versus a 9 per cent estimate) due to the continued success of the J'adore, Sauvage and Miss Dior perfumes. Several other products were cited as drivers for the strong results, including Rouge Dior lipstick, Mon Guerlain fragrance, Givenchy make-up, and the recent launch of Fenty Beauty, a new make-up range by popstar Rihanna. Watches and jewellery grew 14 per cent, thanks to the popularity of Bvlgari's signature jewellery collections and the launch of the new Festa high-end jewellery line. In watches, TAG Heuer and Hublot continued to grow following new product launches, bucking wider industry trends for this product category.

These top-line numbers illustrate how well diversified LVMH is as a luxury conglomerate. Profitability is improving, too, with first-half operating margins up 1 percentage point to 18.5 per cent, while the group’s share of net profits improved by a quarter to €2.1bn (£1.9bn). The group also declared a half-year dividend worth €1.6, supported by a 23 per cent rise in adjusted cash generation to €4.5bn. Strong cash generation is keeping LVMH’s debt pile in check, too – at the halfway stage the net total fell by a quarter. Leverage has never been too onerous for the company (it’s steadily fallen below one times cash profits), but analysts have expressed concerns that acquisitions are weighing on return on capital employed. In our view, as long as costs keep falling and sales accelerate hereafter, such worries should abate over time.

Specific targets aren’t exactly LVMH’s style. But it wants to continue growing market share via new product launches in new markets. At the last count, sales were strong across Europe, Asia and the United States.

MACAU DAILY TIMES 澳門每日時報Luxury retail | Dior chief is said to step aside as LVMH shuffles leadership - Macau Daily Times,"Thu, 09 Nov 2017 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vbWFjYXVkYWlseXRpbWVzLmNvbS5tby9sdXh1cnktcmV0YWlsLWRpb3ItY2hpZWYtc2FpZC1zdGVwLWFzaWRlLWx2bWgtc2h1ZmZsZXMtbGVhZGVyc2hpcC5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Sidney Toledano will step aside as head of LVMH’s Christian Dior, ending an almost 20-year tenure at the helm of one of the world’s top fashion houses as the luxury conglomerate rejuvenates its executive ranks, according to people familiar with the matter.

Pietro Beccari, the chief executive officer of LVMH- owned fashion brand Fendi, will replace Toledano as CEO of Christian Dior Couture, according to one of the people, who asked not to be identified because the appointment hasn’t been made public. The Dior chief will move to a supervisory role as chief of the LVMH Fashion Group, overseeing smaller brands including Kenzo and Celine, another person said.

The shift ends an era for Dior and its parent, after two decades in which Toledano acted as a steady hand as designers like John Galliano grabbed headlines for their creations and, sometimes, their behavior. The 66-year-old Dior chief presided over the rapid growth and transformation of a fashion house known for dressing Grace Kelly and Marlene Dietrich, relaunching its menswear line under Hedi Slimane.

Across the fashion industry, new blood is stepping into the executive ranks amid the rise of online shopping and a sales rebound in China, with traditional markets like the U.S. and Europe lagging behind. Recent executive changes have included the planned departure of Burberry Group Plc creative head Christopher Bailey, while three of LVMH CEO Bernard Arnault’s children have assumed senior management jobs at the French luxury giant.

Beccari, 50, transformed Fendi from a fur specialist into a brand with more than 1 billion euros in sales. Leaving in place designers Silvia Fendi and Karl Lagerfeld, he reinvigorated the label with eye-popping store renovations and pushed it upmarket by discontinuing logo-printed handbags in favor of luxury models like the USD3,200 Peekaboo and $5,550 Baguette.

He’ll take over Dior at a time when it’s more important than ever to its parent company, whose full name is LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE. LVMH this year bought Christian Dior Couture for 6.5 billion euros ($7.5 billion), bringing the brand’s fashion and accessories business under the same umbrella as the LVMH-owned perfume business for the first time since the 1960s.

LVMH laid the groundwork this year for Toledano’s succession with several executive changes. Among them, Nicola Brandolese, who most recently served as president of retail at Italian eyewear retailer Luxottica Group SpA, joined the maker of Louis Vuitton bags and Dom Perignon Champagne for an unspecified role on June 1. He began by shadowing Beccari at Fendi, people familiar with the situation said in July.

Toledano joined Dior in 1994 and became CEO in 1998. In 2011, he fired Galliano after the head designer was filmed uttering anti-Semitic comments in a Paris cafe. The Dior chief maintained growth amid the successive departures of Slimane and Galliano, as well as Raf Simons, the Belgian designer who left in 2015 after three and a half years.

The Dior merger created a mega-brand with combined of sales of more than 5 billion euros a year, according to Exane BNP Paribas analyst Luca Solca. The project is known internally as “One Dior.”

Arnault, 68, has yet to detail his own succession plan. Eldest daughter Delphine, 42, climbed the ranks at Dior before becoming director and executive vice president at Louis Vuitton, while son Antoine, 40, is CEO of Berluti and president of Loro Piana. Alexandre was named co-CEO of the Rimowa suitcase brand last year at the age of 24. LVMH brands including Celine, Loro Piana and Loewe recently named new heads.

Asia a priority for BA&SH after early Hong Kong success - Inside Retail Asia,"Thu, 09 Nov 2017 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vaW5zaWRlcmV0YWlsLmFzaWEvMjAxNy8xMS8wOS9hc2lhLWEtcHJpb3JpdHktZm9yLWJhc2gtYWZ0ZXItZWFybHktaG9uZy1rb25nLXN1Y2Nlc3Mv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Parisian affordable luxury brand BA&SH plans to ramp up its Asian presence after early success in Hong Kong.

The region has become a top priority for founders Barbara Boccara and Sharon Krief after a cornerstone 50 per cent investment by LVMH-linked PE fund L Capital in 2015. BA&SH plans to open 12 more stores in China, Macau and Hong Kong next year.

The co-founders made their first personal appearance in Asia at the recent Spring-Summer 2018 collection media preview in Beijing.

“BA&SH is spreading fast in Asia and seems to match the local way of life, confirming the universal reach of its lifestyle,” said Ba&Sh CEO Asia Isolde Andouard.

Hongkongers quickly embraced the BA&SH label, with growing foot traffic in the three stores which have opened since April, at Times Square, Harbour City and IFC Mall.

“The shops are flourishing, so the brand is all the more optimistic and enthusiastic at the time of launching BA&SH in China,” she told Inside Retail Hong Kong.

Five Mainland China stores have opened since September in fashionable and luxury malls in Beijing – Shin Kong Place, Galeries Lafayette and Taikoo Li – and in Shanghai – Reel and Taikoo Hui.

The Asia roll-out is being led by Andouard, who previously headed up rival fashion operator, the Chinese-owned French company SMCP, parent of the Sandro, Maje and Claudie Pierlot.

“Isolde is the right person to achieve ba&sh development in Asia,” explained BA&SH global CEO Pierre-Arnaud Grenade. “Her versatile background and her in-depth understanding of the Asian market are strong assets to support BA&SH implementation there.”

Authenticity wins following

Andouard says the brand’s authenticity won over French women and believes that same authenticity appeals to Asian consumers.

Despite its LVMH-linked ownership, Barbara and Sharon remain the faces of the brand “and, as such, they do reinforce the customers’ identification withBA&SH. But above all, BA&SH benefits from its success in France and from the LVMH network to carry out a daring expansion strategy. The launch in Asia and in the US were done simultaneously, a bold move that is starting to show tangible results,” she said.

The co-founders, high school girlfriends, have given the first two letters of their names and more than 10 years of their lives to create the brand before attracting the attention of LVMH.

Globally, BA&SH now has 500 points of sale worldwide, including 163 direct retail stores.

The brand’s two core values – freedom and friendship – are at the heart of the creative process.

“Trend books never set foot in the BA&SH workshop, where only refined fabrics and craftsmanship ignite the spark of the stylists’ creativity. Barbara and Sharon dreamed of building the ideal wardrobe, and that’s why our products are so versatile, in fitting with today’s never-resting metropolitan woman who parties when she’s not working or with her family.”

The new SS18 collection mixes Anglo-Saxon and Asian inspirations to embody “the joyful and Parisian BA&SH spirit”.

Most prints draw their inspiration from the heart of Asia; Japanese and traditional Chinese patterns are reinterpreted with flair.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9984534978866577}",positive,0.9984534978866577,1
Meet Dior’s new man who made Kendall Jenner walk on water| Gulf Times - Gulf Times,"Sat, 18 Nov 2017 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmd1bGYtdGltZXMuY29tL3N0b3J5LzU3MTU3NC9tZWV0LWRpb3JzLW5ldy1tYW4td2hvLW1hZGUta2VuZGFsbC1qZW5uZXItd2Fsay1vbi13YXRlctIBZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmd1bGYtdGltZXMuY29tL3N0b3J5LzU3MTU3NC9tZWV0LWRpb3JzLW5ldy1tYW4td2hvLW1hZGUta2VuZGFsbC1qZW5uZXItd2Fsay1vbi13YXRlci9hbXA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"MEET

At luxury house Fendi, Pietro Beccari made model Kendall Jenner walk on water. His next assignment: to make Christian Dior fly again.

Beccari, chief executive officer of the Italian fur-and-leather purveyor, has been tapped by parent LVMH to take over leadership of Christian Dior Couture in early 2018.

Over the past five years, he’s moved Fendi to the forefront of luxury branding, offering customers a full-immersion experience ranging from eye-catching stores and a whimsical e-commerce site to a boutique hotel and one of chef Rainer Becker’s trendy Zuma restaurants in the Roman palazzo that houses its flagship store.

The Fendi chief cemented the brand’s ties to the Italian capital, adding the word Roma to the logo and moving into a new headquarters at the long-abandoned Palazzo della Civilta Italiana, a marble block dating to the Mussolini era. Behind the arched facade, the building houses art exhibitions, fur ateliers and executives suites.

The brand sponsors art exhibits and cultural restoration projects and staged a runway show last year in which American reality-television personality Jenner and other models traversed a plexiglass runway atop the Trevi Fountain — a Roman landmark that had been renovated under the brand’s sponsorship.

“Beccari has done an amazing job of taking the craft of the house and using it in a very modern way,” Elizabeth von der Goltz, global buying director at online luxury retailer Net-a-Porter, said in an interview. “At Dior there’s something to be done in terms of modernising their communications — making it more playful.”

Beccari’s challenge will be to take Dior, the first luxury asset French billionaire Bernard Arnault acquired on the way to assembling industry leader LVMH, and restore its status as a trend-setter. While the brand’s tight-waisted “New Look” helped revive the French fashion industry after World War II and its clients have run the gamut from Ava Gardner to Melania Trump, it’s become an elder statesman in an industry being revived by designers like Gucci’s Alessandro Michele.

Under Sidney Toledano, who’s moving on from his position as Dior CEO to a supervisory role at other LVMH brands, Dior has been one of the steadiest performers in fashion, growing an average of 12% a year since 2000. But the output of chief designer Maria Grazia Chiuri, hired in 2016 as the first woman creative director since Dior’s founding in 1946, has drawn mixed reviews. Menswear collections by Kris Van Assche pass largely unnoticed — a far cry from the agenda-setting power the brand enjoyed a decade ago when Hedi Slimane’s skinny suits and jeans set the pace for the industry.

Meanwhile, the luxury industry’s changing fast. Gone are the days when growth could be achieved simply by opening another store in China, or even by designing a generation’s must-have handbag or heels. Led by millennials newly attuned to the allure of high fashion, consumers visit stores to envelop themselves in the brand and its provenance — and then do their buying at home, online.

“Dior needs a rejuvenation,” particularly online, said Marco Pozzi, senior adviser at Milan-based digital marketing consultancy ContactLab. LVMH declined to make Beccari available for an interview.

The Fendi chief, 50, carried out a multipronged revamp after taking over in 2012 following a six-year stint as marketing and communications director at LVMH’s Louis Vuitton. Under his leadership, Fendi doubled down on its identity as a specialist in high-end leather and furs, ditching entry-level logo-printed canvas handbags to focus on $4,000 Peekaboo bags, $12,000 fox-fur coats and intricate, handmade fur ensembles that can cost as much as $1mn.

Fendi hasn’t ignored its retail network, opening new stores in Australia, Japan and the US, including boutiques in New York, San Francisco and Dallas. Rather than sitting on shelves against cold marble, handbags are suspended amidst a wall of golden wands. Entry-level shoppers can still get “bag bugs” — furry charms to personalize their handbags — for $650 and up.

The website’s holiday gift guide invites shoppers to explore “Fendi Land” — an animated depiction of a carnival that walks them through the brand’s range. Fendi under Beccari “has become a top performer in terms of how to convey a luxury experience to clients when they purchase online,” Pozzi said.

While those investments have been costly, Fendi’s expanded scale helps to offset the expense, says Rogerio Fujimori, a luxury analyst at RBC Capital Markets in London. LVMH doesn’t break out figures for individual brands, but RBC says Fendi has sales of about $1.1bn, with a profit margin over 20%. Fujimori estimates that Dior’s margin, as gauged by earnings before interest and taxes, is in the low teens.

Beccari should be able to improve profitability at Dior, Fujimori said, “because of the power of the brand, its scale.”
