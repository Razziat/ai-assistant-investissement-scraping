"LVMH, the Luxury Goods Giant, Posts a 64% Gain in Annual Profit (Published 2015) - The New York Times","Tue, 03 Feb 2015 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMTUvMDIvMDQvYnVzaW5lc3MvbHZtaC10aGVsdXh1cnktZ29vZHMtZ2lhbnQtcG9zdHMtYS02NC1nYWluLWluLWFubnVhbC1wcm9maXQuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Paris — LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, the world’s largest luxury goods group, said on Tuesday that its profit jumped by 64 percent last year, bolstered by stronger demand in the United States and Europe, despite an overall softening of global demand for high-end goods.

LVMH, whose brands include Givenchy and Bulgari in addition to Louis Vuitton, as well as Dom Pérignon and Veuve Clicquot Champagne, posted a 2014 net profit of 5.65 billion euros or $6.4 billion, up from €3.4 billion a year earlier.

Revenue growth was more modest, up 6 percent, to €30.6 billion, largely because of an unfavorable currency exchange-rate environment, the company said.

Consumer spending on luxury goods continued to rise in 2014, but at a far slower pace than in previous years. That has crimped the sales of Europe’s big luxury houses, not only at LVMH but also at Richemont of Switzerland and Kering, the French company formerly known as PPR, whose brands include Gucci, Bottega Veneta and Yves Saint Laurent.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9999988079071045}",positive,0.9999988079071045,1
LVMH vs Kering: Which Player is Best Positioned for Growth? - The Business of Fashion,"Mon, 23 Feb 2015 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzb2ZmYXNoaW9uLmNvbS9vcGluaW9ucy9uZXdzLWFuYWx5c2lzL2x2bWgtdnMta2VyaW5nL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS, France — Louis Vuitton Möet Hennessy (LVMH) and Kering, the French conglomerates that dominate luxury fashion, both operate strong brands in many categories, yet they have crucial features which distinguish their approaches and prospects for growth. Which is best positioned for growth?

LVMH’s domination of two unrelated categories — leather goods and wines and spirits — helps smooth the volatility of its operating profit. The group is also building up a dominant position in beauty retailing, primarily through Sephora and travel retailer DFS, exploiting rich synergies with its perfumes and cosmetics business and steadily increasing asset returns.

By contrast, Kering's forays into lifestyle have not generated shareholder value. Synergies with luxury were never expected. Yet Puma's return on invested capital and earnings have both gone the wrong way since the acquisition in 2007. Also, Kering’s move into lifestyle has nullified possible valuation upside from the company’s progressive exit from general retailing to refocus on luxury. Ten years ago, we argued the merit of Kering’s stated aim of “value creation through luxury focus.” This focus still seems appropriate.

Advantage LVMH.

This isn't the first time we have raised the spectre of ubiquity and the resulting loss of desirability of fashion goods. Coach, Burberry and Abercrombie & Fitch have all suffered. Louis Vuitton and Gucci, LVMH and Kering's largest brands, respectively, have each worked hard to protect their long-term appeal, increasing entry-level price points, injecting more novelty into their offering, tightening their grip on distribution and curbing store expansion.

Gucci appears to have been earlier in raising its entry-level price points and ""ennobling"" its communications, but then again Louis Vuitton always was more expensive. Vuitton, by contrast, recognised earlier the need to pause growth of new space and has traditionally kept a tighter grip on distribution, through its retail-only approach. Also, Vuitton seems to have worked harder to refresh its style and product offering in the past few years, bringing on new designer Nicolas Ghesquière. This will likely be a top priority for Gucci's new creative leadership, helmed by Alessandro Michele, over the next few years.

As their mega-brands lose their star sparkle and become cash-cows, the two groups will need to accelerate the growth of their smaller brands. Kering has a superior track record in this area, with the landmark examples of Bottega Veneta and Saint Laurent and the promise of more to come from its smaller brands including Alexander McQueen and Stella McCartney.

LVMH seems to have realised only recently the need for brand orchestration, managing different brands for different price points, style loci and consumer segments. It has yet to gain significant traction with many of its smaller brands.

Advantage Kering.

On the flipside, LVMH’s watches and jewellery division seems to offer more upside in the short term, especially as new product ranges and re-sized stores appear set to boost Bulgari's sales productivity and operating performance. What’s more, the group’s wines and spirits division should be ready to pay back on years of investment: champagne margins are recovering their pre-crisis fizz, cognac is normalising and single malt whisky is strengthening the mix. This is the group’s most important area where returns must materialise.

We expect selective retailing to be a positive net contributor at LVHM as Sephora and DFS continue to develop both physically and in terms of productivity. The growth relay in fashion and leather goods will not be created overnight, but Fendi, Marc Jacobs, Loro Piana are promising candidates.

Advantage LVMH.

So which group is better positioned?

LVMH couples higher structural appeal with a higher stock market multiple, whereas Kering offers one of the most compellingly low valuations in the sector. Kering's reward for its efforts at Gucci will take time to emerge but Alessandro Michele has hit the ground running. He has rapidly taken responsibility for the brand's fashion week shows and will be fully immersed in the Spring/Summer collections to be presented in September. Moreover, the strength of the partnership between Michele and Marco Bizzarri, previously the CEO of Kering's couture and leather goods division and the newly installed as president and chief executive officer of Gucci, should keep things running smoothly and staunch the flow of bad news over the next 12 months.

All in all, this tips the scales in Kering’s favour in the short-term, though LVMH scores higher for long-term structural appeal.

Luca Solca is the head of luxury goods at BNP Exane Paribas.

Bateel sees sweet success in LVMH partnership - FoodNavigator.com,"Fri, 06 Feb 2015 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2RuYXZpZ2F0b3IuY29tL0FydGljbGUvMjAxNS8wMi8wNi9CYXRlZWwtc2Vlcy1zd2VldC1zdWNjZXNzLWluLUxWTUgtcGFydG5lcnNoaXDSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The deal will see L Capital Asia, a Singapore-based private equity firm backed by LVMH, take a minority stake in Bateel, according to media reports. Neither Bateel or L Capital Asia have formally commented on the sale, but did release a statement announcing a partnership between the two firms.

Global potential​

“With the world seeking healthier and newer options, we believe the Bateel franchise has tremendous potential, and we hope to work closely with the company to take the brand to more people across the globe​,” said Ravi Thakran, chairman and managing partner of L Capital Asia, adding that few local Middle East brands had been able to define a position in the luxury marketplace.

“Bateel has been a tremendous success with its origins in the Middle East. Not only have they created a unique branded packaged goods proposition for dates which were traditionally viewed as a commodity product, but also deliver a world-class café experience with a flavour of the Middle East through the Bateel cafés​,” he added.

Ata Atmar, managing director of Bateel, said Bateel had been working with Thakran and L Capital Asia over the last few years, adding that he looked forward to making use of their knowledge of and passion for premium brands.

Developing the brand​

“Leveraging our partner and [its] vast experience in marketing and management of iconic brands around the world will provide a strong platform to compete in the gourmet confectionery, and premium café markets​,” said Atmar.

“The partnership with L Capital Asia is a very welcome development, coming at an important juncture in Bateel’s corporate life cycle. We have built a premium brand with a strong market position and robust growth prospects. With a well-defined and tested business model and a strong production and distribution infrastructure in place, we are poised to accelerate Bateel’s expansion beyond our current core markets in the Gulf​,” he added.

Bateel developed from selling only dates in its native Saudi Arabia to offering a range of chocolate and confectionery products, many of them date-based. It now has a presence in 16 markets across the Middle East, Europe and Asia, distributes its products through vendors such as Harrods and Fortnum & Masons, and operates a number of shops and cafes across the Gulf.

LVMH, formerly known as LVMH Moët Hennessy • Louis Vuitton, controls a large swathe of the world’s luxury brands, from its eponymous champagne, spirits and fashion divisions, to many other high-end beverage brands such as Krug, Glenmorangie and Chateau d’Yquem. L Capital Asia is managed independently of LVMH, but has a “strong alignment of interest” with LVMH’s business strategy.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9998354911804199}",positive,0.9998354911804199,1

W. Anderson, to discuss the need for efficiency, the difference an LVMH investment makes and the problem with desks (among other burning questions that did not make the final cut). This conversation has been condensed and edited.

JONATHAN ANDERSON: We moved into this building about a year ago. Our old studio is just around the corner, and I wanted to stay in the area because it was somewhere that I grew the brand up. This space is a bit like my house: a bit higgledy-piggledy. Things are never finished. We built everything. We have a lot of wardrobes because that was the only storage we could get. We were all about trying to make these amazing built-in cupboards, but that never happened. Maybe one day. All our chairs came from Tesco.

VANESSA FRIEDMAN: What is important to you about the space?

JWA: I like open, communal spaces. I feel that people work better where there are no divisional walls. We obviously have a couple for meetings. I feel like you put barriers up and people don’t ask questions. I like to float around. I don’t think I’ve ever sat more than 10 minutes at a desk. It’s sort of like a barrier between you and someone so they feel like they’re coming to present something to you. I’m used to sitting on a sofa.

VF: What about the people you work with?

JWA: I’m very into clear-desk policy. I believe that you have to have very clean spaces to work on. If we had wallpaper with a lot of print, or a lot of old collections lying around, or a lot of anything nostalgic, you pick up influence from it, subconsciously, even color. So I have a lot of these large boards that literally everything goes on it, and once we’ve finished, everything comes off it, so that we start from scratch. And I think it forces people to kind of think back onto a blank canvas.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.99972003698349}",neutral,0.99972003698349,0
LVMH +6% to $35.1bn as growth slows for DFS - TRBusiness,"Wed, 04 Feb 2015 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRyYnVzaW5lc3MuY29tL3JlZ2lvbmFsLW5ld3MvaW50ZXJuYXRpb25hbC9sdm1oLTYtdG8tMzUtMWJuLWFzLWdyb3d0aC1zbG93cy1mb3ItZGZzLzcyMDAz0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LVMH recorded total revenues up 6% to €30.6bn ($35.1bn) in 2014, with revenue up in all divisions except Wines & Spirits and a more challenging environment for DFS Group.

DFS business was impacted by the expansion and renovation of several airport concessions, plus ‘geopolitical developments in 2014, according to LVMH’s full-year results.

LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton described the performance of the company as a whole as ‘excellent’. pointing to ‘strong momentum’ in the United States, while Europe showed good resilience and markets in Asia showed variable performances.

On the retail side with its Selective Retailing Division, the Sephora beauty chain was said to have had ‘an exceptional year’, gaining market share and performing particularly well in North America, the Middle East and Asia.

By comparison, DFS Group’s progress has been impacted by currency and geopolitical developments. This was hardly unexpected following comments to analysts by LVMH Chief Financial Officer Jean-Jacques Guiony in his three quarter results conference call last October.

[He told analysts then that were several pressure points on DFS’ business, including a weak yen, Singapore down between -5% and -7%, a softening of sales in DFS’ Gallerias in Hong Kong and Macao – plus some likely impact on its retail business in Hong Kong, due to the political protests. To review those comments, click here: http://www.trbusiness.com/regional-news/international/lvmh-talks-dfs-to-the-analysts/].

Some four months later, LVMH reports that DFS has continued focusing and optimizing its retail offer, while deploying its Loyalty T rewards programme, although LVMH adds that the retailer’s profitability was impacted by the expansion and renovation of several airport concessions.

TRBusiness notes that these include the huge new S$85m ($97.4m) reinvention project related to Changi Airport’s L&T business which opens next year (85,350sq ft in all four terminals), plus its upcoming multi-million dollar Venice (Fondaco dei Tedeschi building) and Cambodia downtown projects and other airport investments – plus improvements to its Okinawa Galleria. DFS’ recently renovated airport concessions in Hong Kong and North America (New York JFK, Los Angeles etc) are also said to have delivered strong performances.

Commenting on the outlook for DFS, LVMH said: “Drawing on its unique expertise in travel retail, DFS will continue to optimize its stores’ offerings according to each destination, while adapting to its customers’ expectations. In 2015, renovation work will start on the Chinachem and Hysan stores in Hong Kong and the brand will launch its first foray into the digital domain at Changi Airport in Singapore.

“DFS will continue to selectively review opportunities to diversify its product offering and its geographic coverage in order to build on its success and future growth prospects.”

On top of DFS’ ongoing progress and investments, Sephora also expanded its store network further by opening its first stores in Indonesia and Australia, while renovating several flagship outlets, including the Champs-Elysées and Dubai Mall. Online sales were also said to have grown significantly, supported by ‘innovative mobile features’.

Against this complex background of heavy investment for the full year, the Selective Retailing business appears to have done pretty well, recording organic revenue growth of 8%, with profit from recurring operations reaching €882m ($1,012m) in 2014.

In the bigger picture and across LVMH’s entire business, fourth quarter revenue rose by 10% compared to the same period of 2013, while organic growth was recorded at 5%. Profit from recurring operations reached €5,715m ($6,555m), resulting in an operating margin of 19%. Group share of net profit was reported at €5,648m ($6,477m).

Commenting, Bernard Arnault, Chairman and CEO of LVMH said that these results confirm LVMH’s capacity to progress, ‘despite economic and currency uncertainty’.

He added: “Revenue and net profit reached new record levels. Commitment to excellence, a passion for quality and our capacity to innovate [and] underpin our growth momentum are all values epitomised by the Fondation Louis Vuitton and its emblematic building inaugurated in October 2014.

“The year was also marked by the arrival in the Group of Loro Piana, which saw a good performance. LVMH reached an agreement with Hermès and disposed of its stake in this company, in the form of a distribution to our shareholders.

“In 2014, all our Maisons demonstrated outstanding flexibility. By adapting their strategies to global changes and by continuing to evolve, they have shown the creativity and entrepreneurship that drive them forward. In an uncertain economic environment, we can rely on the desirability of our brands and the agility of our teams to further strengthen our leadership in the world of high-quality products.”

In Summary, LVMH lists the key influences during the year as follows:

Good momentum in the United States and continued growth in Europe;

A major increase in net profit;

Large negative exchange rate effect, principally impacting Fashion & Leather Goods:

Wines & Spirits’ performance penalized by the destocking by distributors in China;

The success of new products at Louis Vuitton, where profitability remains at ‘an exceptional level’;

Continued investment in our fashion brands;

Worldwide market share gains by Christian Dior;

Excellent results from Bvlgari;

Strong progress at Sephora;

Free cash flow of €2.8bn ($3.2bn);

A gearing ratio of 21% – as at the end of December 2014.

LVMH adds that it is looking forward to 2015 with confidence, despite a climate of ‘economic, currency and geopolitical uncertainties’. The company says it is well-equipped to continue its growth momentum across all business groups this year. It adds that it has once again set itself the objective of increasing its global leadership position in luxury goods market.

The bottom line for shareholders now is that LVMH says it will propose a dividend of €3.20 ($3.67) per share (+3%) at the Annual Shareholders’ Meeting on April 16, 2015.

Meanwhile, a summary of the performances of LVMH’s luxury product divisions during 2014 is shown below:

WINES & SPIRITS: DESTOCKING IN CHINA; GROWTH IN THE US:

The Wines & Spirits business group recorded a decrease in organic revenue of 3% in 2014. Profit from recurring operations reached €1,147m( $1,316m).

LVMH said: :This situation is essentially explained by the evolution of Cognac in China, linked to the continued destocking by distributors. Against this background, Hennessy leveraged its extensive portfolio and global presence, in particular in the United States, where its growth remains strong.

“Other spirits, Glenmorangie and Belvedere continue their development. The Champagne business performed well, driven in particular by its prestige vintages. The American and Asian markets benefited from strong demand.”

FASHION & LEATHERGOODS: LVMH said that the Fashion & Leather Goods business group recorded organic revenue growth of 3% in 2014. Profit from recurring operations reached €3,189m ($3,659m). LVMH stated that 2014 was characterised by ‘strong creative momentum’ at Louis Vuitton, dominated by the ‘enthusiastic reception’ to Nicolas Ghesquière’s first runway shows and new products.

LVMH said: “The celebration of the Monogram canvas as revisited by six leading designers and the inauguration of the Avenue Montaigne flagship store in Paris are among the highlights of the last quarter. 2014 marks the first year of Loro Piana’s integration into the business group.

“Fendi experienced strong growth driven by the success of its iconic lines. Celine continued its remarkable performance. Other fashion brands such as Givenchy, Kenzo and Berluti experienced accelerated growth, while Donna Karan and Marc Jacobs are in a redeployment phase.”

PERFUME & COSMETICS: LVMH reported that the Perfumes & Cosmetics business group significantly outperformed the market with organic revenue growth of 7% and profit from recurring operations of €415m ($476m).

LVMH said: “The business group’s momentum was boosted by continuous innovation and sustained investments. Iconic perfumes of Christian Dior, J’adore, Miss Dior and Dior Homme continued to demonstrate their exceptional appeal.

“The make-up segment also contributed to the good performance of the Maison, notably thanks to Dior Addict Fluid Stick. Guerlain benefited from the successful launch of its new fragrance L’Homme Idéal and the success of its high-end skincare range Abeille Royale.

“Benefit confirmed its strong global momentum and is ranked as the leading make-up brand in the UK. Fresh and Make Up For Ever continued to strengthen their positions.”

WATCHES & JEWELRY: LVMH says that it noted a strengthening of the jewellery business in 2014, but cautious purchasing behaviour by multi-brand watch retailers.

The company commented: “The Watches & Jewelry business group recorded organic revenue growth of 4%. Profit from recurring operations reached €283m ($324m).

“While jewelry revenue showed remarkable momentum, watches were penalized by the cautious purchasing behaviour of multi-brand retailers in an uncertain economic environment. Bvlgari recorded strong growth driven by the success of its iconic lines and enhanced its watch collections with its new Lvcea watch for women.

“TAG Heuer refocused on its core offering, adapting its organization accordingly. While maintaining tight control, the Maisons continued to selectively invest in their distribution network and production capacity.”","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9998952150344849}",positive,0.9998952150344849,1

Details of the transaction have not yet been disclosed but the deal is expected to expand the group’s presence in Asia, the US and other underdeveloped markets.

Chief executive Carlos Ortega and the company’s Barcelona-based management team are expected to remain in place.

Pepe Jeans Group and other shareholders close to the management will reinvest alongside M1 Fashion, a subsidiary of M1 Group, and L Capital Asia.

The Pepe Jeans Group management team said: “Our new incoming partners bring with them a wealth of experience, knowledge and influence, particularly in markets where we envisage significant growth opportunites. We share a long term vision and a collective aspiration for the company and its brands.”

M1 Group and L Capital Asia said in a statement: “While there are multiple levers for us to bring value to the business, we believe our investment will benefit the group for further expansion globally, particularly targeting opportunities in Asia and North America.”

Torreal, Artá and L Capital Europe added: “Pepe Jeans and Hackett have experienced a strong development in the last few years and are today global brands uniquely positioned to benefit from additional expansion opportunities in new geographies.”

Pepe Jeans and Hackett were previously owned by Torreal Funds (31%), Artá Capital (16.4%), L Capital Europe (11.5%) and its managers.

Pepe Jeans Group had annual earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation of €60m (£47.46m) in the year to March 31, 2014. Hackett’s turnover increased 10% to £170m and its pre-tax profits soared 74% from £3.9m to £6.8m in the same time period.

The group has more than 290 owned stores, 170 franchise stores and 6,000 stockists including multi-brand and department stores.

Morgan Stanley and Baker & McKenzie advised Pepe Jeans Group, while M1 Group and L Capital Asia were advised by Citi and Dechert.

L Capital Asia most recently acquired a controlling interest in Australian swimwear brand Seafolly in December, for an undisclosed amount.

M1 Group is a family-owned investment company, founded by brothers Taha and Najib Mikati, with its origins in the construction and telecom sectors. Its fashion subsidiary bought French womenswear and menswear brand Façonnable from Nordstrom Inc for $210m (£138m) in 2007 and was in discussion to acquire All Saints in 2011, but the deal collapsed after its investors developed nerves about the retail sector as a whole.

Can Ferrari really cut it in luxury beyond supercars? - Yahoo Finance,"Fri, 13 Feb 2015 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTWh0dHA6Ly9maW5hbmNlLnlhaG9vLmNvbS9uZXdzL2ZlcnJhcmktcmVhbGx5LWN1dC1sdXh1cnktYmV5b25kLTEyNTA0OTU2MC5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The new LaFerrari hybrid car is pictured on the Ferrari stand during the first media day of the 83rd Geneva Car Show at the Palexpo Arena in Geneva, in this March 5, 2013 file photo.

By Agnieszka Flak

MILAN (Reuters) - Ferrari faces a battle to persuade investors that it should be priced as a high-flying luxury goods stock, given a carmaker's margins and the heavy investment required to make its prancing horse logo a big attraction on other exclusive lines.

Few would question the business acumen of Sergio Marchionne, redoubtable chief executive of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA)(FCHA.MI)(FCAU.N), but his strategy for squeezing every last drop of value from the listing of the group's illustrious Italian sports car brand has certainly raised a few eyebrows.

""Ferrari is capable of being a fully-fledged luxury brand,"" Marchionne declared last month, setting his stall out to target the kind of high-end valuation multiples enjoyed by the likes of LVMH (LVMH.PA) and Richemont (CFR.VX).

The 62-year-old said Ferrari is worth up to 10 billion euros (7 billion pounds), eyeing an initial public offering (IPO) slated for the first half of this year and hoping for a chunky windfall to boost FCA's own ambitious five-year investment plan.

But for all Ferrari's Formula One racing pedigree, exclusivity exemplified by the LaFerrari supercar's 1 million euro price tag and a production cap that maintains a healthy customer waiting list, the company has its work cut out if it is to join a sector that trades at about 20 times future earnings. That's more than double the average for carmakers.

It has to be acknowledged that Ferrari is no laggard in the money-making stakes, with profit nearly tripling over the past decade and its margins of 14 percent unmatched by any carmaker bar Porsche (VOWG_p.DE).

But those margins are well below Prada's (1913.HK) 26 percent and have been under pressure from rising costs.

Revenue growth has been more gentle than that of most European luxury stocks and its capital expenditure and research and development requirements are more than double, depressing its return on capital.

SHORT ON DETAIL

While the multiples investors will pay depend on Ferrari's ability to grow, it is hard to see what the company has beyond its cars that would fit the luxury mould.

Story continues

Ferrari has the capacity to raise annual production to 10,000 vehicles a year from 7,000, but Marchionne has made clear that output will be kept below demand to protect the brand's exclusivity and told analysts in a post-results conference call last month that further detail on his strategy would not be forthcoming until nearer the IPO.

Ferrari's merchandising division might seem an obvious starting point, but Marchionne has denied this. In any case, the elevated prices of T-shirts, bags and shoes bearing the prancing horse are well below those commanded by luxury goods.

Its theme park in Abu Dhabi is also accessible to anyone willing to fork out 250 dirham ($70) for a one-day pass.

""If you're already available to everyone, then making your way back up to the luxury level is nearly impossible,"" said Manfred Abraham at brand-building consultancy BrandCap.

""They would have to stop doing a lot of things and start again, which is a massive investment ... how attractive is that to shareholders?""

Investors have also been left scratching their heads over Marchionne's statement that carmaking, which accounts for the bulk of sales and profit, is ""incidental"" to Ferrari.

As shown by Porsche Design, tyre maker Pirelli's (PECI.MI) PZero and Bugatti's move into apparel, previous attempts by automotive groups to stretch beyond their core products have not provided a major revenue boost.

Then there's the Ferrari logo and colours, which analysts have said make it a difficult sell in the fashion and design world.

LUXURY ALLIANCE?

There was talk of a luxury alliance with other opulent Italian brands to rival conglomerates such as Kering (PRTP.PA), but the concept has been dismissed by two bankers close to the company.

Analysts, meanwhile, have pointed to the potential for exclusive clubs and hotels for the super-rich or Ferrari moving into high-value motorcycles and boats.

However, Bernstein analyst Max Warburton remains sceptical, suggesting that the Ferrari brand could be extended at a luxury premium only to watches, perfumes and eyewear.

""A sports car maker has little competitive advantage when it comes to producing and selling personal luxury goods,"" he said.

Regardless of its prospects as a true luxury goods business, the spinning off of Ferrari is far from a car crash.

The divorce will unlock the value of a business that made 12 percent of FCA's profit last year. It could also pave the way for FCA to attempt a tie-up with another carmaker, perhaps focussing on the Asian market, bankers have said.

Yet how investors interpret Marchionne's bold statements remains unclear, with analysts' estimates for Ferrari's worth ranging anywhere between 5 billion euros and 10 billion euros.

""With luxury it's a lot about emotion and allure,"" one U.S. investment banker said. ""People may not fully buy into Marchionne's argument, but they will put money on Ferrari on the promise of what it represents and could be.""
