What recession? Why LVMH luxury goods sales are (still) soaring right now - Style,"Fri, 14 Oct 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjbXAuY29tL21hZ2F6aW5lcy9zdHlsZS9sdXh1cnkvYXJ0aWNsZS8zMTk1OTQyL3doeS1hcmUtbHZtaC1zYWxlcy1zb2FyaW5nLWRlc3BpdGUtZ2xvYmFsLWluZmxhdGlvbi1jcmlzaXPSAXZodHRwczovL2FtcC5zY21wLmNvbS9tYWdhemluZXMvc3R5bGUvbHV4dXJ5L2FydGljbGUvMzE5NTk0Mi93aHktYXJlLWx2bWgtc2FsZXMtc29hcmluZy1kZXNwaXRlLWdsb2JhbC1pbmZsYXRpb24tY3Jpc2lz?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"In a sign of the enduring demand for pricey goods, sales at the company’s fashion and leather goods unit soared 22 per cent on an organic basis in the third quarter. Analysts had expected a gain of 16 per cent.

LVMH sales have suddenly surged, with the French conglomerate behind Louis Vuitton and Christian Dior benefitting big from the appetite of newly returned American tourists visiting Europe on the hunt from luxury goods.

LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE – to give the firm its full name – is the first high-end group to report revenue for the three months ending September. So far the industry has avoided the squeeze on spending that other retailers and consumer goods companies have faced amid a growing cost-of-living crisis.

But even LVMH, which has been pushing up the prices of its products amid soaring inflation , indicated it’s not immune to the wider economic distress in the market and said it would keep a tight rein on costs and only invest selectively. That’s a new area of emphasis for LVMH, whose comments on the company’s outlook have tended to focus on growth prospects.

The luxury group, which also owns Tiffany & Co. and Celine, has been helped in part by currency fluctuations, with the euro trading below the dollar level – making purchases in Europe cheaper for US tourists who splurged on fancy hotel nights in Paris, including LVMH’s Cheval Blanc.

LVMH said overall sales in Europe, the US and Japan have been strong since the start of the year thanks to solid local demand and the resumption of international travel . Asia, including China, saw a lower level of growth in the same period, although there has been some improvement in the third quarter as strict Covid-19 restrictions started to ease.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9963632225990295}",positive,0.9963632225990295,1
Gagosian Denies Rumors It Is Being Acquired by Luxury Goods Conglomerate LVMH - ARTnews,"Wed, 26 Oct 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFydG5ld3MuY29tL2FydC1uZXdzL25ld3MvZ2Fnb3NpYW4tZGVuaWVzLXJ1bW9ycy1sdm1oLTEyMzQ2NDI0Mjcv0gFRaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYXJ0bmV3cy5jb20vYXJ0LW5ld3MvbmV3cy9nYWdvc2lhbi1kZW5pZXMtcnVtb3JzLWx2bWgtMTIzNDY0MjQyNy9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Larry Gagosian (at center) talking with Bernard Arnault (at left), chairman and CEO of LVMH.

Gagosian, the world’s biggest art gallery, has refuted rumors that it is in talks with French luxury goods conglomerate LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton.

Talk of a potential deal between the two has been circulating widely among market experts, with the Art Newspaper’s Italian edition and Artnet News running articles that mentioned the murmurings. The rumors suggested that LVMH was reportedly in talks to invest in Gagosian, the mega-gallery founded by Larry Gagosian in Los Angeles in 1980 that now encompasses some 16 spaces worldwide.

Multiple sources also told ARTnews and WWD that they were aware of talk of a potential deal.

But on Tuesday, a Gagosian representative vigorously disputed that deal as mere hearsay and not rooted in fact.

“There is absolutely no truth to the rumor and the company is not for sale,” the Gagosian spokesperson said in an email.

LVMH owns an array of luxury companies, from the fashion house Christian Dior to the jeweler Tiffany & Co. to the yacht manufacturer Princess Yachts. Owning or investing in Gagosian would give the conglomerate a foothold in the rapidly expanding art market.

A representative for LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton declined to comment to ARTnews and WWD.

The rumors came as the art market directed its attention last week to Paris, where LVMH is headquartered. Paris+, the first edition of a new Art Basel fair, just completed its first edition in the French capital, where Gagosian currently has two locations, plus a third in the nearby suburb of Le Bourget.

The talk also arrived as Gagosian begins to plot its future. Larry Gagosian, who is now 77, has begun to reveal his succession plans in the past few years, naming Andrew Fabricant as the gallery’s chief operating officer in 2019. Details have been scant since then, however, leading to widespread speculation about where the gallery is headed in the years to come.

Previously, Fabricant has advocated for a total merger of the art and fashion sectors. “You have [Bernard] Arnault buying Tiffany’s and then buying a Basquiat painting and then producing a Patek Philippe limited [edition] watch that is first seen on Jay-Z’s wrist,” he told WWD earlier this year. “The interaction of art and commerce and fashion is inevitable. It’s just being accelerated by the consolidation of all these issues, whether it’s Kardashian, Arnault or the Gagosian Gallery having 19 galleries. It’s just more, more, more. It’s also mutually beneficial.”

Any potential investment in Gagosian would lend LVMH significant clout in the art world. Much of the conglomerate’s dealings concern the fashion industry. Outside that sphere, the company also owns the publication Le Parisien, the luxury hotel chain Cheval Blanc, and the amusement park Jardin d’Acclimatation.

While Gagosian’s main competitors—David Zwirner, Hauser & Wirth, and Pace—have made forays into industries beyond the art world, none can boast an investment from a company so large as LVMH.

Gagosian represents some of the world’s most high-profile artists, including Georg Baselitz, Theaster Gates, Michael Heizer, Damien Hirst, Takashi Murakami, Richard Serra, and Jordan Wolfson. These artists appear side by side on the roster with younger ones with loyal market followings, like Jadé Fadojutimi and Anna Weyant.

Gagosian reportedly accounts for a billion dollars in sales annually.

Although LVMH is mainly known within the fashion space, it has some art connections. Bernard Arnault, LVMH chairman and CEO, is one of the world’s top art collectors. Arnault is known to buy various Gagosian artists, including Hirst, Murakami, and Richard Prince. Arnault and other members of his family are also believed to be close with Larry Gagosian.

The acquisition of a stake in Gagosian would give Arnault a leg up in the art world over his own business enemy, François Pinault, founder of the French luxury goods company Kering, which owns the auction house Christie’s. Pinault is also a major collector.

Another art connection is its portfolio, which at one point included a stake in the Phillips auction house. LVMH acquired the stake in 1999, then divested itself of it four years later amid a period of financial strain at Phillips.

Additionally, LVMH sponsors the Fondation Louis Vuitton, a Parisian contemporary art space opened in 2014. Even though Arnault initiated the project, the space is a nonprofit that is technically not operated by LVMH proper.

Talk of LVMH’s potential investment in Gagosian comes as the boundary between art galleries and lifestyle brands has become increasingly blurred.

Gagosian, for its own part, operates a series of shops that sell branded offerings. Pace recently opened a teahouse in Seoul that’s partnered with the luxury brand Osulloc, and Manuela and Iwan Wirth, the founders of Hauser & Wirth, run a hospitality arm.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999924898147583}",neutral,0.9999924898147583,0
Soaring Sales At LVMH Prove That Luxury Consumers Are A Different Breed - Jing Daily,"Wed, 19 Oct 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiPWh0dHBzOi8vamluZ2RhaWx5LmNvbS9wb3N0cy9sdm1oLXEzLWVhcm5pbmdzLWx1eHVyeS1jb25zdW1lcnPSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"It’s a tough time to be in business. Thanks to spiking inflation rates, ongoing supply chain issues, overstocked inventory, and on-and-off store pandemic closures in China, companies across the apparel and beauty sectors have dimmed their outlooks for the rest of the fiscal year despite beating analyst expectations in previous quarters.

But luxury players aren’t letting headwinds slow them down. On October 11, French conglomerate LVMH posted a sharp rise in sales in the third quarter, up 19 percent on a comparable basis from a year earlier to 19.8 billion euros (19.2 billion) — a testament to the ongoing demand for high-end products around the world. In fact, the group attributed revenue growth to American tourists taking advantage of the strong dollar to splurge in Europe, as well as easing health restrictions in Asia.

That said, Louis Vuitton sales were flat in China during the period — better than the second quarter but still far from recovery. As LVMH chief financial officer Jean-Jacques Guiony said on a call with investors, “The Chinese market is not working the normal way. We still have disruptions, both in terms of people being in lockdown, some stores are being closed. If you look at brick and mortar, the traffic in stores is still very low compared to 2019.”

Given these fluctuations in the mainland, the company’s biggest division, fashion and leather goods, pulled most of the weight. In the first nine months of 2022, business grew 31 percent (24 percent in organic) to 21.3 billion euros (20 billion), led by Louis Vuitton. In addition to a successful men’s Spring Summer 2023 LV show in China, the star label unveiled many new products, including the Tambour Twenty collector’s watch. Limited to just 200 pieces, the 17,800 timepieces went “immediately out of stock” after being released in September, the company noted.

LVMH isn’t the only luxury giant turning its fortunes around. Earlier this week, Shanghai-based Lanvin Group announced that revenue in the first half of the year grew 73 percent year-over-year, representing “one of the highest growth rates in the global luxury industry.” Although Europe and North America largely drove this performance, Greater China managed to surge 32 percent year-over-year in sales as brands expanded their presence on local e-commerce platforms such as JD.com and Xiaohongshu. (Still, the owner of Sergio Rossi lowered its valuation in light of shifts in the currency and stock markets.)

As these results show, strong local demand in Europe and North America and rebounding tourism are helping global businesses to weather the storm. However, Bernstein analyst Luca Solca tells Jing Daily that Chinese consumers remain the most important constituency for these players. “We see in our analyses that — as soon as COVID-19 restrictions are lifted — Chinese consumers will go back to the stores.”

It’s also important to remember that these affluent consumers are not heavily swayed by inflationary pressures. “Luxury is not a proxy for the general economy,” explained LVMH’s Guiony. “We don’t necessarily sell to the average household. We end up selling to affluent people and they have a behavior on their own that’s not necessarily totally aligned with economic or GDP ups and downs.”

As consumers getting out of the pandemic are in “carpe diem mode,” luxury names can head into the holiday season with some optimism. But they’re not completely out of the woods just yet: “Clearly, at one point luxury spend will normalize and converge back to fundamentals,” Solca continued. “This is why we think it would be important for luxury brands to find a ‘growth relay’ between western consumers moderating their spend into FY23E and Chinese consumers accelerating.” Those that do will be the ones that pull ahead of the pack.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9999773502349854}",positive,0.9999773502349854,1
Why LVMH Stock Is Down 27% This Year - The Motley Fool,"Mon, 17 Oct 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIyLzEwLzE3L3doeS1sdm1oLXN0b2NrLWlzLWRvd24tMjctcGVyY2VudC10aGlzLXllYXIv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The French luxury giant is still a rock-solid investment.

LVMH Moet Hennessy (LVMUY -1.91%) (LVMHF -1.57%), the world's largest luxury goods maker, just announced solid third-quarter results. For the period ended Sept. 30, revenue rose 27% year over year to 19.76 billion euros ($19.21 billion). And for the first nine months, revenue was up 28% to 56.49 billion euros ($54.93 billion).

Those robust growth rates indicate that LVMH, which owns 75 major brands across five major categories -- wines and spirits, fashion and leather, perfumes and cosmetics, watches and jewelry, and selective retailing -- remains resistant to inflation and other macroeconomic headwinds.

That isn't surprising since economic downturns generally don't affect LVMH's affluent customers as much as middle-class shoppers. It had also previously bounced back quickly from the pandemic, which throttled its sales throughout 2020 as it temporarily closed down many of its brick-and-mortar stores.

Analysts expect LVMH to continue growing its revenue at a compound annual rate of 12% from 2021 to 2024, and its earnings per share (EPS) to increase at a rate of 13%. Those estimates indicate it's still a solid long-term investment, and its stock still seems reasonably valued at 20 times next year's earnings.

So why did LVMH's stock still shed more than 25% of its value this year? Let's review the four main reasons to see if it's still worth buying.

1. Reverberations from Russia's war on Ukraine

LVMH is one of the largest companies in Europe, and its main shares are listed in Paris. Russia's invasion of Ukraine this February, which sparked a war that hasn't ended yet, has been throttling Europe's economic growth with higher energy and food prices. That pressure has been weighing down the major European indexes.

2. Exchange rate issues for U.S. investors

The rampant inflation that occurred after Russia's invasion of Ukraine caused many countries, including the U.S., to raise their interest rates. That shift was particularly painful for U.S. investors, who had grown accustomed to low interest rates in the decade following the Great Recession.

Rising interest rates also strengthened the U.S. dollar against the euro and other foreign currencies. This caused LVMH's U.S.-listed American depositary receipts (ADR), which trade in dollars, to drop faster than their underlying Paris-based shares, which trade in euros and declined only about 13% this year.

3. Supply chain issues

LVMH struggled with several supply chain issues in the first nine months of 2022. It grappled with new COVID-19 lockdowns in China, logistics problems, including a shortage of glass bottles, for its wine and spirits segment in the U.S., and a decision to stop sourcing diamonds from Russia after its invasion of Ukraine.

These disruptions will probably persist as China sticks with its zero-COVID policy, gas prices remain high, and the Russo-Ukrainian war drags on.

4. Other concerns about the Asian market

Lastly, investors are concerned about LVMH's loss of momentum in Asia (excluding Japan), which accounted for 32% of its top line in the first nine months of 2022.

Its sales in the region rose just 2% organically during that period, mainly because of the zero-COVID lockdowns in China and other regional restrictions across Asia. And it trailed far behind the high double-digit growth rates of its other three core markets -- the U.S., Japan, and Europe.

That's worrisome, because LVMH previously relied heavily on its growth in Asia to carry it through the Great Recession. If it can't restart that growth engine before the next recession starts, it could suffer a much tougher slowdown.

On the bright side, LVMH's 6% organic growth in Asia (excluding Japan) in the third quarter represented a significant acceleration from the region's 8% decline in the second quarter. Those early signs of improvement indicate that its Chinese market could gradually recover if the country finally ends its zero-COVID restrictions.

LVMH is still a solid investment

LVMH faces near-term headwinds, but it's still a great long-term investment. Its five core businesses all grew at double-digit rates in the first nine months of 2022, and its diverse mix of high-end brands -- including Louis Vuitton, Dior, Tiffany, Tag Heuer, and Hennessy -- should still insulate it from a major recession. The euro should also stabilize against the U.S. dollar once inflation is reined in, which could make LVMH's ADR shares a lot more appealing to American investors again.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.999951958656311}",positive,0.999951958656311,1
"LVMH Opens Doors to Berluti, Dior, Kenzo, Tiffany & Co., Louis Vuitton - WWD","Sun, 16 Oct 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3dkLmNvbS9mYXNoaW9uLW5ld3MvZGVzaWduZXItbHV4dXJ5L2x2bWgtb3BlbnMtZG9vcnMtdGlmZmFueS1rZW56by1hcm5hdWx0LWpvdXJuZWVzLTEyMzUzODg5MzEv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS — LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton‘s doors opened to all once again.

After a four-year hiatus, the world’s largest luxury group’s heritage days returned worldwide from Oct. 14 to 16, adding new houses and events along the way. It’s the fifth edition of the Journées Particulières, which give a peek into its storied ateliers, allowing guests the chance to interact with craftspeople in all things luxury, from Champagne to fine jewelry.

“It is quite moving,” said Antoine Arnault, head of communication and image at LVMH, of the return to in-person events. He conceived of the days to showcase the houses’ inner workings over a decade ago and decided against holding a virtual event during the pandemic in anticipation of the day its ateliers could once again welcome visitors in person.

“Its all about sensory experience, and you don’t really get that on a screen,” he said. This year, a total of 93 locations in 15 countries from across 57 of the company’s maisons were opened, some for the first time, including Tiffany & Co.’s jewelry design and innovation workshop in New York City and Berluti‘s bespoke tailoring workshop in Paris.

Tickets to visit those never-open-to-the-public places, along with visits to Dior and Louis Vuitton, were fully reserved in just three seconds. The rest of the 200,000 spots available were gone within six minutes. With the free reservation system full (“It’s one of the rare times where we we don’t sell anything,” joked Arnault), guests lined up as early as 5 a.m. each day for an inside glimpse into the brands.

For Arnault, the popularity of the event is the payoff of a gamble he took a decade ago. “It was a real challenge and bet when I had the idea and launched it,” he said. The first event welcomed 100,000 guests — now the three-day event has doubled in size. “It’s a gratifying success that my intuition was right. Since then it’s not easier because we at LVMH like to challenge ourselves and always try to do a little bit better, a little bit more and have a little bit of a challenging objective.”

This year’s event took six to eight months of planning, he said.

It’s a testament to the strength of the brands and their place in French — and global — culture. “We must do something right in terms of expressing the values, expressing where they’re from and what they stand for,” he said.

Arnault’s dance card for the event’s calendar was full. He began midweek with a pre-launch reception to open the newest Fendi atelier in Capannuccia, Tuscany, and visits to Berluti and Loro Piana ateliers in Italy.

The official launch took place on Oct. 13 at a splashy cocktail party at the conglomerate’s headquarters on Avenue Montaigne. Bernard Arnault, chairman and chief executive officer of LVMH, joined his son for a brief press conference, both wearing turtlenecks under their suits, which have become de rigeur as luxury brands turn down the thermostat amid a looming energy shortage in Europe.

The two men gamely skirted a question about their favorite LVMH brand, and posed for a photo with dozens of artisans from Chaumet, Berluti, Dior, Louis Vuitton, Broderies Vermont and Moynat, most of them dressed in white lab coats.

Then it was off to a marathon of events, including the Vuitton atelier in Asnières, a trip to the Champagne region to visit Moët & Chandon, Krug, and Veuve Clicquot, plus 25 other sites across Paris. “I don’t think I’m missing a single one,” Antoine Arnault said.

One of the highlights of the Paris locations was Chaumet’s newly revamped hotel particulier on Place Vendôme. It was opened to the public for the first time since undergoing a revamp in 2020.

Guests were welcomed in the opulent Salon Chopin with pianist Ionah Maiatsky tickling the ivories, before house archivist Michael Lepage led the group through a grand dining room done up in Chaumet’s signature deep blue by architect Patricia Grosdemange. A “fantasy dinner party” of sorts was set in grand Belle Époque style, including place settings for Edith Wharton, Gertrude Vanderbilt, Gustave Eiffel and Olga and Pablo Picasso — all of whom were clients of the house.

The grand display room was next, where the Radziwill tiara, famous for its seven diamond drops, and the Bourbon-Parma tiara were on display for the first time. The tour took in the archives full of leather-bound books and old correspondence, as well as a magical shadow puppet show before being welcomed into the workshop by manager Benoit Verhulle. He walked guests through the creation process with various craftspeople.

Original tools of wood and iron stood in the sleek white atelier, a stark contrast to today’s scientific microscopes and computer screens, which ensure precise measurements. Craftspeople put each piece together like a puzzle, and they demonstrated how they remake an object several times through paper, wax castings, and various metal versions before constructing the final piece.

Necklaces take one year to finish; tiaras, two. “The story of creation is part of the value,” said craftsman Didier Larue, as he explained the intricate steps for an extravagant headpiece for a private client. Other pieces were being prepped for the 2024 collections.

A group of university students walked by, part of LVMH’s outreach to young people in an effort to get them more interested in crafts as it faces a near constant shortage of skilled workers. The heritage days serve as a calling card of sorts.

“For our business to continue to grow, to be successful in a way that it can contribute to society, we need those younger generations to get interested in these métiers de la main, these manual jobs, that are super interesting and probably not valorized enough,” said Arnault. “It’s not the first objective, but if it can be a collateral advantage, we’d love that.” He noted that some students who attended the first edition in 2011 now work for LVMH, crafting shoes and leather goods in its workshops.

LVMH’s sales have continued to soar, despite global economic headwinds. The company reported double-digit growth across divisions in results last week. Arnault credited the company’s heritage for allowing it to move forward.

“Our real strength is the fact that we have a very long-term horizon. Of course, we have to publish [financial results] every three months. However, we don’t decide our strategy in function of the next three months, but over the next three, five, 10, sometimes 30 years. It’s really something that you can feel inside the companies — there’s no short-term stress.” He framed it in terms of U.S.-based Tiffany & Co., which LVMH bought in 2021.

“They were always a bit out of breath because they always had to explain what they were going to do in the next quarter, and then justify what they did in the previous quarter. That’s not how we function, it’s really not very healthy for a company that should have time ahead to implement strategies,” he said. “The good thing about a group like ours is we have long horizon and we have the means to get these strategies implemented.”

Amid other LVMH brands taking part in the event, Kenzo welcomed close to 400 visitors to its Rue Vivienne headquarters. They were treated to a spacious, museum-caliber exhibition drawing links between the late founder, Kenzo Takada, and Nigo, the current artistic director, who has thrust the brand’s painterly florals, lively checks, layering, hats and Asian-inspired silhouettes into the present day.

Guided tours offered a close look at rare archival designs, including a clutch of short, padded kimonos from a 1983 collection and a one-of-a-kind, couture-quality wedding dress from a 1982 show that the founder composed from a stash of antique ribbons.

More than 60 outfits were displayed alongside show invitations, contact sheets, vintage magazine covers, fabric samples and video footage of a 1972 show at the then-derelict Gare D’Orsay.

Visitors learned about the founder’s fondness for cotton and hand-painted prints, including a poppy motif that Nigo reprised and remixed for his debut collection for fall 2022.

Kenzo’s headquarters house a ready-to-wear atelier numbering 15 people, with another 27 or so in the studio, who are apprised of the latest vintage acquisitions in order to glean inspiration from the prints and innovative cutting.

This year, which marks Sephora’s second time participating in Les Journées Particulières, the prestige beauty retailer flung open the doors of its headquarters in the Paris suburb of Neuilly-sur-Seine.

In the lobby there, visitors could explore an exhibition showcasing the company’s history and DNA, while a video playing overhead featured Sephora founder Dominique Mandonnaud.

Down a level, attendees could take part in one of three half-hour masterclasses, created by Sephora University, which were centered on either makeup, skin and hair care or fragrance. A spotlight was shone on Sephora’s private-label collection and the retailer’s cherrypicked selection of “Good For” products. These come in four categories: “good for recycling,” “a better planet,” “vegan” and “you.”

Sephora also showcased products slated for the end-of-year holiday period.

On iPads, it was possible virtually to personalize one of the brand’s four iconic products with various designs. The finished creations were then projected onto a big, rectangular screen. Sephora’s creative director will choose the three most imaginative ideas, and each will win a prize.

Simultaneously, Sephora organized happenings in some of its flagships in Paris, in the Champs-Élysées, Opéra and Saint-Michel neighborhoods. Others took place in Milan’s Corso Vittorio Emmanuele; Barcelona’s El Triangle; New York’s Fifth Avenue, and in Asia, Nanjing Road in Shanghai and Singapore’s Raffles City.

Each activation was designed for attendees to learn about Sephora’s background and have beauty advisers answer questions via guided tours and masterclasses.

It was the first time Tiffany’ s jewelry workshop in New York City was open to the public as part of the LVMH initiative. Housed in an office tower on West 23rd Street, it has a corporate aesthetic that Robert Downey Jr.’s “Iron Man” character would appreciate: modernist interiors; multiple monitors to magnify the work underway, and sleek stainless-steel machinery for molding, prototyping and other specific tasks. Visitors started their tours in a holding area, where the brand’s Knot and Lock jewelry was displayed.

Dana Naberezny, vice president and chief Innovation officer of the jewelry design and innovation workshop, or JDIW, noted it was created in 2018 and consists of a team of engineers, CAD designers, master craftspeople and quality professional. Prototyping and function are the focus for JDIW workers, whose objective is to turn designs into a reality with the best mechanisms. Once accomplished, manufacturers make them for the stores.

About 650 people secured time slots online to visit the workshop. Considering that part of Tiffany’s appeal has always been its mystique, there must surely have been debate about how much to show during the public tours or whether to participate. Naberezny offered, “You’re seeing existing products when you walk through here. I have a joke, ‘What happens in the JDIW, stays in the JDIW.’ We want to keep surprising customers so we’re not showing the newest of the new. But we are giving them that look at what we do and how we work. It’s a blend, right? It’s [a matter of] how do we make it really special for individuals to really understand Tiffany while also saving some surprises for later in the year.”

Passing through an engineering lab, a two-armed robot was testing the closure of a T1 bangle — a test that is done thousands and thousands of times to ensure it can withstand the normal wear-and-tear of a customer so that it can be passed on from one generation to the next.

As a reminder of the company’s heritage, which dates back to 1837, a wall in the main work space features Pop Art-ish lighting of a signature Tiffany box, an “&” and other emblems of the brand’s DNA. Next was the intriguing 3D Printing Lab, which stays a few degrees cooler than other areas to maintain the consistency of the wax that is used for prototypes of Knot bracelets and rings, and other articulated items for wear-testing and other functions.

Visitors were privy to the custom embellished sunglasses that Tiffany partnered on with Pharrell Williams earlier this year and the hefty necklace that Beyoncé Knowles sported in the latest ad campaign. Other tour attractions were the bejeweled pendants that are part of the NFTiffs.

Nearing the end of the tour, a few rows of people were immersed in their craftsmanship, whether that was molding a wax figure of Louis Comfort Tiffany or setting diamonds in one of Tiffany’s Schlumberger Sixteen Stone Ring.

“It’s a different kind of curiosity. It’s maybe less commercial,” added Arnault, of the guests who visit the ateliers to see a little bit of magic being made. “Of course, I preach for my companies, but I’m an advocate of continuing to dream.”

Ye Lashes Out at LVMH Chief Bernard Arnault - WWD,"Tue, 04 Oct 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3dkLmNvbS9mYXNoaW9uLW5ld3MvZmFzaGlvbi1zY29vcHMva2FueWUtd2VzdC15ZWV6eS1wYXJpcy1zaG93LWJlcm5hcmQtYXJuYXVsdC1sdm1oLTEyMzUzNzkyNTQv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Ye is keeping the controversy coming — and again going after LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton chief executive officer Bernard Arnault.

The designer and rapper, formerly known as Kanye West, riled up fashion — and the internet at large — with his Yzy fashion show in Paris on Monday.

The online spotlight shone brightest on his T-shirt, which read “White Lives Matter” — which the Anti-Defamation League deems “a white supremacist phrase that originated in early 2015 as a racist response to the Black Lives Matter movement.” Ye said the shirt “says it all,” although many found it offensive and the outcry over his actions is ongoing.

But on the sidelines, Ye kept at Arnault, whom he declared to be “my new Drake” and “the number-one competition” at the show Monday.

Arnault leads the world’s largest luxury house, ranked by Forbes to be the world’s second-richest person with a fortune of $153.8 billion, including a gain of $9.1 billion on Tuesday alone.

But Ye’s beef — which so far seems to be one-sided — metastasized into something else Tuesday on Instagram, where he made a series of controversial claims.

“SPANK MY HAND WITH THE RULER(S) I’LL GO SIT IN THE ‘PRINCIPAL(S)’ OFFICE CAN’T WE TALK ABOUT MORE IMPORTANT THINGS LIKE HOW LATE THE SHOW WAS OR HOW BERNARD ARNAULT KILLED MY BEST FRIEND EVERYONE’S GOT A RIGHT TO AN OPINION RIGHT THERE’S MINE,” Ye wrote in a post, featuring a bust of Roman poet Virgil.

LVMH has not publicly responded to Ye’s statements and a spokesperson did not immediately respond to a WWD query.

Virgil Abloh — one of fashion’s most beloved designers and the first Black man to be men’s artistic director at Louis Vuitton — died from a rare form of cancer at 41 last year. Both Abloh and Ye interned at another LVMH house, Fendi, in 2009.

However, Arnault championed Abloh and in 2021, when LVMH raised its stake in the designer’s Off-White brand, the billionaire said he was “thrilled” to be expanding the partnership.

In another post on Tuesday that seemed to bring more heat than light to the situation, Ye said the streetwear brand Supreme is owned by LVMH — it’s not, VF Corp. bought the brand in 2020 from private equity backers — and that “IN WAR THEY WILL SEND YOUR OWN PEOPLE AT YOU. GOOD ONE BERNARD.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999831914901733}",neutral,0.9999831914901733,0
Kanye West claims LVMH CEO Bernard Arnault 'killed' Virgil Abloh in wild rant - New York Post,"Tue, 04 Oct 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vbnlwb3N0LmNvbS8yMDIyLzEwLzA0L2thbnllLWNsYWltcy1sdm1ocy1iZXJuYXJkLWFybmF1bHQta2lsbGVkLXZpcmdpbC1hYmxvaC1pbi1yYW50L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Kanye West is at it again, this time hurling accusations pertaining to his friend Virgil Abloh, the late designer.

After sparking controversy during Paris fashion week when he unveiled a “White Lives Matter” T-shirt graphic in his Yeezy Season 9 fashion show Monday, Ye defended his designs in a series of Instagram rants.

In one of his tirades, the 45-year-old self-proclaimed genius wrote on Instagram that Bernard Arnault, the CEO of the largest conglomerate of luxury brands, LVMH, “killed” the beloved Off-White designer, who died of cancer last year at age 41.

“SPANK MY HAND WITH THE RULER(S) I’LL GO SIT IN THE ‘PRINCIPAL(S)’ OFFICE,” West captioned a photo of a statue. “CAN’T WE TALK ABOUT MORE IMPORTANT THINGS? LIKE HOW LATE THE SHOW WAS, OR HOW BERNARD ARNAULT KILLED MY BEST FRIEND.”

“EVERYONE’S GOT A RIGHT TO AN OPINION RIGHT THERE’S MINE,” he added.

The Post has reached out to reps for West and Louis Vuitton for comment.

Abloh, who gained a loyal following in the fashion world thanks to his streetwear brand Off-White, died on Nov. 28, 2021, after a two-year private battle with cancer.

Abloh became the first black person to ever be appointed the artistic director of Louis Vuitton menswear in May 2018. In July 2021, he was given greater creative control across the LVMH brand, which also purchased a 60% stake in Off-White.

He and West were friends and creative collaborators — Abloh was even a groomsman in West’s wedding to Kim Kardashian — and the two shared a sweet, viral embrace at the end of Abloh’s first LV menswear show.

Tremaine Emory, founder of Denim Tears and the creative director of Supreme, didn’t take kindly to West’s mention of Abloh, writing in his own Instagram post, “Keep Virgil name out your mouth.”

“Ye tell the ppl why you didn’t get invited to Virgil’s actual funeral the one before the public one at the museum,” Emory wrote. “You knew Virgil had terminal cancer and you rode on him in group chats, at yeezy, interviews … YOU ARE SO BROKEN. KEEP VIRGIL NAME OUT YOUR MOUTH.”

Emory also defended Vogue contributing editor Gabriella Karefa-Johnson, who attended the Yeezy show and later called West’s WLM shirts in an Instagram Story “pure violence.”

Ye put the editor on blast in several Instagram posts, some of which critiqued her appearance.

“This is not a fashion person You speak on Ye Ima speak on you Ask Trevor Noah,” he wrote. “I KNOOOOOOW ANNA HAAAATES THESE BOOTS.”

“KEEP @gabriellak_j NAME OUT YOUR MOUTH,” Emory said. “Your not a victim your just an insecure narcissist that’s dying for validation from the fashion world [sic].”

West posted a screenshot of Emory’s post to his own feed and later added a caption: “IN WAR THEY WILL SEND YOUR OWN PEOPLE AT YOU … GOOD ONE BERNARD.”

Model Gigi Hadid also weighed in on West’s designs, commenting on one of his posts in defense of Karefa-Johnson.

“You wish u had a percentage of her intellect,” she wrote. “You have no idea haha … If there’s actually a point to any of your s–t she might be the only person that could save u. As if the ‘honor’ of being invited to your show should keep someone from giving their opinion ..?

“Lol. You’re a bully and a joke,” Hadid concluded.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.999991774559021}",neutral,0.999991774559021,0
LVMH’s Bernard Arnault Sold His Private Jet to Stop Twitter Activists From Tracking His Movements - Robb Report,"Tue, 18 Oct 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vcm9iYnJlcG9ydC5jb20vbW90b3JzL2F2aWF0aW9uL2Jlcm5hcmQtYXJuYXVsdC1zZWxscy1wcml2YXRlLWpldC0xMjM0NzYxNjUwL9IBWGh0dHBzOi8vcm9iYnJlcG9ydC5jb20vbW90b3JzL2F2aWF0aW9uL2Jlcm5hcmQtYXJuYXVsdC1zZWxscy1wcml2YXRlLWpldC0xMjM0NzYxNjUwL2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Bernard Arnault has found a way to fly under the radar.

The CEO of luxury titan LVMH, who has been criticized on Twitter for his consistent use of private jets, has started renting planes to prevent the Twitterverse from tracking his flights. Accounts such as I Fly Bernard and Bernard’s Airplane have been monitoring the billionaire’s private jet journeys to draw attention to the resulting pollution, as reported by Bloomberg.

Arnault, who is currently the world’s second-richest individual with a net worth of $137 billion, told Radio Classique on Monday that the LVMH group had a plane, and sold it. “The result now is that no one can see where I go because I rent planes when I use private planes,” Arnault explained to the LVMH-owned radio station.

C'est l'heure du bilan du mois de septembre 2022 pour les 5 avions de nos milliardaires:

– nombre de vols: 26✈️

– 48,4 heures de vol ⏱️

– vol le plus court: 30min 🤡

– CO2 émis: 203 tonnes 🔥🔥🔥

Premier mois sans l'avion de Bernard Arnault (dont il s'est séparé 🥲) pic.twitter.com/7XNAj26tP7 — I Fly Bernard (@i_fly_Bernard) October 1, 2022

The billionaire’s son, Antoine Arnault, who is an LVMH board member and the director of communications for Louis Vuitton, added that the Tweets reporting where the jet is could also be bad for business. “It’s not very good that our competitors can know where we are at any moment,” he said during the interview. “That can give ideas, it can also give leads, clues.”

It’s not just Arnault catching flak, either. Back in September, I Fly Bernard called out Kering’s CEO François-Henri Pinault for flying from Venice to Paris and back in one day. The account also pointed out that private planes flying the wealthy around France emitted 224 tons of carbon into the atmosphere in September alone. The environmental impact has not gone unnoticed by French lawmakers. In fact, some of the country’s politicians are advocating taxing the rich for using private jets.

Stateside, Elon Musk is facing similar online wrath. The Tesla CEO, who is now the world’s richest individual with a fortune of $208 billion, recently sparked controversy when an account called ElonJet reported that he flew just nine minutes from San Jose to San Francisco in his private Gulfstream. Musk has called the account “a security risk” and asked the young man who runs it to delete it.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999935626983643}",neutral,0.9999935626983643,0
LVMH's Diversified Luxury Brand Portfolio is Recession Armor - Entrepreneur,"Thu, 20 Oct 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVudHJlcHJlbmV1ci5jb20vZmluYW5jZS9sdm1ocy1kaXZlcnNpZmllZC1sdXh1cnktYnJhbmQtcG9ydGZvbGlvLWlzLXJlY2Vzc2lvbi80Mzc1NjfSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"This story originally appeared on MarketBeat

What does Dom Perignon champagne, Louis Vuitton handbags, FENDI purses, TAG Heuer watches, Tiffany & Co. jewelry, and Geurlain parfums have in common? Yes, they are luxury brands, but they're also owned under one global luxury goods company LVMH-Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton Société Europeenne (OTCMKTS: LVMUY). Paris, France-based LVMH sells low to high-end luxury brand products in five categories and over 60 major fashion brands known as houses. These categories include wines and spirits (26 houses), fashion and leather goods (14 houses), watches and jewelry (8 houses), perfumes and cosmetics (15 houses), and selective retailing (5 houses) including Sephora, DFS, and Starboard Cruise Services. The strong U.S. dollar is bolstering demand for its products in the U.S. and boosting margins for brands that are imported in U.S. dollars. While it receives nearly 40% of its revenues from the Asia-Pacific region including COVID restricted Chinese provinces, its performance has still been relatively strong despite inflationary headwinds. LVMH is a global luxury brand powerhouse that has both low and very high end brands. This enables it to protect itself during recessions as consumers tighten their purse strings and curb their spending from high end luxury brands to a notch or two lower.



Massive Luxury Brand Umbrella

The scale of diversification is what protects LVMH versus single brands like Ralph Lauren (NYSE: RL), or multiple brand players like PVH Corp (NYSE: PVH) which owns Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein brands. Multi-brand companies like Tapestry (NYSE: TPR) which owns Coach, Kate Spade, and Stuart Weizmann or Capri Holdings (NASDAQ: CPRI) which owns Versace, Jimmy Choo, and Michael Kors provide little diversification and they just can't compare to the 60+ brands owned under the LVMH umbrella.

Luxury Tiers Provide Armor in Recessions

LVMH is a luxury retailer that spans multiple tiers of luxury brands. It's widely believed that a recession hurts upper to lower-middle-income consumers as they tighten their spending on discretionary items and luxury brands. Luxury items are best during strong economies. However, the diversity of LVMH brands ranging from low to high-end luxury enables it to still capture discretionary spending. For example, Dom Perignon champagne consumers may opt to tighten their wallets and downgrade to Veuve Clicquot champagne which often sells for half the price but maintains excellent quality. Luis Vuitton shoppers may downgrade to Mark Jacobs or Christian Dior. Either way, LVMH still gets the business due to its massive diversification and scale in the luxury products industry.

Here's What the Charts Say

Using the rifle charts on the weekly and daily time frames enables a precise view of the playing field for LVMUY stock. The weekly rifle chart made a bottom at the $112.12 Fibonacci (fib) level. Shares rallied through the weekly market structure low (MSL) buy trigger on a breakout through $125.29 as they peaked out on the weekly stochastic oscillation just above the 80-band as shares rejected off the falling weekly 50-period moving average (MA) resistance at $139.10. The weekly stochastic commenced its full oscillation back down towards the 20-band led by the weekly 5-period MA at $120.97 followed by the 15-period MA at $128.67. The weekly 200-period MA sits at the $112.12 fib. The daily rifle chart looked to breakdown, but a spike caused the daily 5-period MA to stall at $119.92 and 15-period MA to stall at $120.27. The daily stochastic is still falling but stalling at the 40-band to set up a daily make or break set-up. Attractive pullbacks levels sit at the $119.50, $118.02 fib, $116.68, $113.22 fib, $110.59, $108.28 fib, and the $105.55 fib level.

Rising Against the Tide

On Oct. 11, 2022, LVMH released its fiscal first-half 2022 results for the quarter ending June 2022. The Company reported revenue growth of 21% year-over-year (YoY) to 36.7 billion euros. Operating profits grew 34% YoY to 10.2 billion euros with 27.9% operating margins. Operating free cash flow fell (-24%) to 4 billion euros. Wine & Spirits revenues rose 23% to 3.327 billion euros and operating profits rose 23% to 1.154 billion euros led by the 16% volume spike in champagnes. Fashion & Leather Goods sales jumped 31% to 18.13 billion and operating profits rose 33% to 7,509 billion euros. Perfume & Cosmetics saw revenues spike 20% to 3.618 billion euros, but operating profits fell (-1%) to 388 million euros stemming from the COVID restrictions in China. The Watches & Jewelry segment saw a 22% jump in revenues to 4.91 billion euros and 26% jump in operating profits to $987 million euros. Selective Retailing saw a 30% gain in revenues to 6.63 billion euros, but operating profits spiked 181% to 367 million. The Sephora store-within-a-store Kohl's (NYSE: KSS) partnership added over 250 additional stores in the first-half of 2022. DFS brand performance was hurt by the health restrictions in China.

CFO Sums up LVMH Competitive Advantages

LVMH CFO, Jean-Jacques Guiony summed up their competitive advantages, ""One, we enter the second half with a strong momentum, particularly demand momentum. Two, our geographic balance and diversification has proven to be a key asset over the last couple of years. Three, our financial strength provides an unparalleled ability to invest in marketing and selling strategies behind our brains. All this does not mean that we are immune to any external shocks, but it just means that we have the ability to face more adverse conditions and to emerge from them stronger than ever.""","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.723298966884613}",neutral,0.723298966884613,0
Luxury goods group LVMH maintains strong pace of sales growth in first nine months - The Moodie Davitt Report,"Tue, 11 Oct 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vbW9vZGllZGF2aXR0cmVwb3J0LmNvbS9sdXh1cnktZ29vZHMtZ3JvdXAtbHZtaC1tYWludGFpbnMtc3Ryb25nLXBhY2Utb2Ytc2FsZXMtZ3Jvd3RoLWluLWZpcnN0LW5pbmUtbW9udGhzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"FRANCE/INTERNATIONAL. Leading luxury goods group LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton recorded revenue of €56.5 billion in the first nine months of 2022, up by +28% compared to the same period in 2021. Organic revenue growth year-on-year was +20%. In the third quarter, organic revenue growth was +19%, in line with the trends in the first half of the year.

By region, Europe, the USA and Japan benefited from “the solid demand of local customers and the recovery in international travel”, said the group.

Asia (including China) saw a lower level of growth over the first nine months, though growth in the latest quarter accelerated due to the partial easing of health restrictions, LVMH added.

In Selective Retailing, revenue growth was +30% (+20% in organic) in the first nine months. Within this, DFS (co-owned by LVMH and co-founder Robert Miller) was affected by the persistent lack of travel, owing to ongoing health restrictions in Asia, noted the group.

The Wines & Spirits business group recorded revenue growth of +23% over the first nine months of 2022 (+14% organic). LVMH’s Champagne Maisons posted strong momentum, which increased pressure on supplies. Growth was particularly strong in Europe, the USA and Japan.

Hennessy Cognac grew, aided by a firm policy of price increases across all regions, which LVMH said “offset the effects of the logistical disruptions in the United States and the impact of health restrictions in China”. Moët Hennessy strengthened its global portfolio of wines with the acquisition of the Joseph Phelps vineyard in Napa Valley, California.

The Fashion & Leather Goods business group recorded revenue growth of +31% in the first nine months (+24% organic). Louis Vuitton shone again, noted LVMH, with new product lines well received. Christian Dior continued to achieve “remarkable growth”, Celine saw strong growth through Hedi Slimane’s creations, as did Loewe, driven by the creativity of J.W. Anderson. Loro Piana and Fendi were other brands to perform well.

With revenue growth of +19% (+12% organic) over the first nine months, the Perfumes & Cosmetics business group maintained its highly selective distribution strategy. Parfums Christian Dior enjoyed “a remarkable performance”, said the group, strengthening its lead in key markets.

Perfumes grew sharply due to the continued success of Sauvage, Miss Dior and J’adore, further strengthened by its latest creation Parfum d’Eau. Dior Addict in makeup and Prestige in skincare also contributed to the Maison’s rapid growth. Guerlain continued to grow, due in large part to the vitality of its Abeille Royale skincare line, its Aqua Allegoria collection and perfume line l’Art et la Matière. Parfums Givenchy performed well, driven by its fragrances.

The Watches & Jewelry business group recorded revenue growth of +23% (+16% organic) in the first nine months. Tiffany & Co. was driven by strong momentum in the USA. Bulgari continued to strengthen its collections with new high jewellery and watch lines.

Looking ahead. LVMH commented: “Against an uncertain geopolitical and economic backdrop, the group is confident in the continuation of current growth and will maintain a policy of cost control and selective investment.”","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9999998807907104}",positive,0.9999998807907104,1

Shares in three of the industry’s biggest players rose early on Wednesday morning amid widespread economic uncertainty and geopolitical unrest. LVMH shares climbed 1.4 percent, Richemont shares traded up 0.6 percent and Hermès shares rose 1.4 percent, as reported by Reuters. Kering shares were also on the up by the late morning.

The spike came just a day after LVMH posted strong third-quarter results and declared that “growth continues at the same pace.” Bernard Arnault’s luxury behemoth recorded revenue of roughly $54.8 billion (€56.5 billion) in the first nine months of 2022, up 28 percent compared to the same period last year. The boom in sales indicates that shoppers have not lost their appetite for high-end designer goods, even in such tumultuous times.

LVMH said sales in Europe, the US and Japan have rocketed since the start of the year due to the ongoing demand of local clients and the recovery of international travel. Well-heeled Americans have also taken advantage of the dollar’s strength in the UK and Europe, purchasing pricy items while the exchange rate is in their favor.

Although some analysts are concerned the luxury sector may face darker times ahead, LVMH is confident in the continuation of current growth and the resilience of its affluent client base. “Luxury is not a proxy for the general economy,” LVMH chief financial officer Jean Jacques Guiony told analysts in a conference call on Tuesday.

Guiony noted that watches and jewelry had performed particularly well in the past nine months. Indeed, the category was up 23 percent compared to the same period last year and pulled in around $7.3 billion (€7.6 billion) in revenue. He added that these products in particular tend to do well in an inflationary environment because they hold their value. He also highlighted that there had been a shift in purchases of silver jewelry to gold jewelry at Tiffany & Co.

Hermès and Kering will be reporting third-quarter sales on October 20. Perhaps you should buy a few more shares now before another spike.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9958129525184631}",positive,0.9958129525184631,1

LVMH’s revenue growth slowed in the U.S. but is recovering in Asia.



U.S. organic revenue was up 11 percent year-over-year in the third quarter, a significant decline from the 22 percent and 26 percent increases in the first and second quarters, respectively.



For the first nine months, revenue in the region was up 19 percent year-over-year.



The U.S. remains LVMH’s second largest market in terms of revenue, just behind Asia. It accounted for 26 percent of total revenue in the first nine months, up from 25 percent in the previous period.



“Europe, the United States and Japan, up sharply since the start of the year, benefitted from the solid demand of local customers and the recovery in international travel,” said LVMH.



Revenue growth in Europe was up 36 percent in the quarter and 43 percent in the first nine months.



In Japan, revenue climbed 30 percent in the quarter and 32 percent in the first nine months.



The Asia region recovered in the third quarter, up 6 percent, after health restrictions in Q2 sent revenue down 8 percent. For the first nine months, revenue in Asia inched up 2 percent.



LVMH has a confident outlook for the rest of the fiscal year.



The company did not provide specific financial guidance for the year ahead but communicated a positive outlook in spite of ongoing economic headwinds.



“LVMH is confident in the continuation of current growth and will maintain [the] objective of further strengthening its global leadership while staying vigilant in [the] context of macro and geopolitical uncertainties,” it said.



The company said it remains well-positioned to keep gaining market share and will see continued momentum in its online revenue and omnichannel developments.



Its focus going forward will be offering “innovative and high-quality” products and continued selective investments, including expanding its store network.

LVMH fashion sales rise 22% as China shows signs of rebound - Vogue Business,"Tue, 11 Oct 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZvZ3VlYnVzaW5lc3MuY29tL2NvbXBhbmllcy9sdm1oLWZhc2hpb24tc2FsZXMtcmlzZS0yMi1hcy1jaGluYS1zaG93cy1zaWducy1vZi1yZWJvdW5k0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"To receive the Vogue Business newsletter, sign up here.

Sales in LVMH’s fashion and leather goods division rose 22 per cent in the third quarter to €9.69 billion, the company said on Tuesday, boosted by a return in tourist spending in Europe and early signs of improvement in China as growth slowed in the US.

The division beat analyst expectations of a 16.2 per cent year-on-year increase for the quarter. Fashion and leather goods sales for the first nine months of the year were up 24 per cent to €27.8 billion. Growth accelerated from the last quarter (sales in Q2 were up 19 per cent) despite external challenges like inflation, a looming global recession and geopolitical tensions, though it’s still behind the pace set in the first quarter when sales climbed 30 per cent. The group said it was lifted by strong sales in Europe as Americans took advantage of the strong dollar to splurge abroad this summer. In China, Covid restrictions slightly eased compared to the second quarter, though the company said the quarter was flat in China for Louis Vuitton.

LVMH chief financial officer Jean-Jacques Guiony conveyed a general cautious message about China. “We cannot really talk about a recovery in China. Things are better than they were in the second quarter for sure, but they are not back to normal. We still have lockdowns here and there, supply chain disruptions, the level of traffic in stores across the country is nowhere near what it was in 2019. We are not operating in normal conditions…We expect it to recover soon.”","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 1.0}",positive,1.0,1

Covering a variety of topics, the interview saw the divisive artist reveal that he was originally offered Virgil Abloh‘s position at Louis Vuitton.

Around the 12:35 mark, Ye touches on how he was offered the Artistic Director role at Louis Vuitton Men’s by LVMH Chief Executive Officer, Bernard Arnault. “No one knows I’d been offered the deal by Bernard Arnault,” Ye said.

Ye also shared how he found out Virgil had landed the position, as the late multi-disciplinary called him “two minutes before it hit the Internet.” Despite feeling a sense of validation that someone he came up with was now the head of Louis Vuitton, Ye admits that he felt “a lot of pain and jealousy.”

Pierre-Emmanuel Angeloglou has added oversight of communications and events to his existing role of executive vice president of strategic missions at Louis Vuitton. Stefano Cantino, senior vice president communication and events at Louis Vuitton, has started reporting to Angeloglou, people familiar with the matter said.

Overseeing communications and events is crucial for one of the world’s best known fashion labels, which has more than 50 million followers across its Instagram and TikTok accounts and whose shows in Paris draw celebrities and fans alike.

Angeloglou joined Louis Vuitton in 2019 as director for fashion and leather goods as well as strategic missions according to his LinkedIn profile. He currently also oversees Louis Vuitton menswear, visual merchandising, window display as well as sustainability matters.

The executive previously spent more than two decades at L’Oréal SA where his final role was global brand president at L’Oréal Paris. He graduated from business school HEC Paris in 1996.

Michael Burke has run Louis Vuitton for the past 10 years, according to his biography page on the LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE website. The powerful executive is also chairman of Tiffany & Co. which LVMH bought almost two years ago.

Angeloglou’s expanded role could help bolster his chances to one day succeed Burke.

LVMH founder Bernard Arnault’s daughter Delphine also works at Louis Vuitton where she oversees products. Both Burke and Delphine Arnault are on the executive committee of LVMH.

Although LVMH doesn’t break down numbers by brands, HSBC estimated in its April report that the label probably generated €17.1 billion ($16.8 billion) in sales in 2021 with earnings before interest and tax of €9.1 billion, which is more than half of the LVMH’s total.

Angeloglou and a representative for Louis Vuitton didn’t immediately reply when asked to comment. LVMH declined to comment.

After sparking controversy during Paris Fashion Week when he unveiled a “White Lives Matter” shirt in his Yeezy Season 9 fashion show on Monday (Oct. 3), Kanye “Ye” West took to social media to defend his designs. In one of his Instagram rants, he wrote that Bernard Arnault, the CEO of LVMH, one of the largest conglomerate of luxury brands, “killed” his “best friend” Virgil Abloh.

In the now deleted Tuesday (Oct. 4) morning Instagram post, the 45-year-old rapper and fashion designer wrote “SPANK MY HAND WITH THE RULER(S) I’LL GO SIT IN THE ‘PRINCIPAL(S)’ OFFICE. CAN’T WE TALK ABOUT MORE IMPORTANT THINGS? LIKE HOW LATE THE SHOW WAS, OR HOW BERNARD ARNAULT KILLED MY BEST FRIEND,” as the caption of a photo of a statue.

“EVERYONE’S GOT A RIGHT TO AN OPINION RIGHT THERE’S MINE,” West added.

The Off-White designer died of cancer on Nov. 28, 2021, after a two-year private battle with cardiac angiosarcoma, an aggressive and rare form of cancer. He was 41.

Arnault’s LVMH owns luxury brands like Louis Vuitton, Christian Dior, Fendi, Givency, and more. In May 2018, Abloh became the first black person to ever be named the artistic director of Louis Vuitton menswear. In July 2021, he was granted creative control of the entire LVMH brand, which also purchased a 60 percent stake in Off-White, the fashion brand Abloh created in 2013.

West declared Arnault his new rival and biggest competitor during his his Yeezy Season 9 fashion show. According to WWD, In a speech before the show, he said “Bernard Arnault is my new Drake. After my first collection, Yeezy One, got more views than Chanel, I had a meeting with Bernard Arnault and he offered me a deal for the Kanye West line, and three months after that, he pulled on the deal. So my second collection didn’t have a producer.”

West and Abloh were frequent collaborators. Abloh was even a groomsman in West’s wedding to ex-wife Kim Kardashian in 2014.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999971389770508}",neutral,0.9999971389770508,0
LVMH's Bernard Arnault Sold His Private Jet to Stop Twitter Activists From Tracking His Movements - Yahoo Finance,"Tue, 18 Oct 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9sdm1oLWJlcm5hcmQtYXJuYXVsdC1zb2xkLXByaXZhdGUtMTUzMDAwMjEwLmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Bernard Arnault has found a way to fly under the radar.

The CEO of luxury titan LVMH, who has been criticized on Twitter for his consistent use of private jets, has started renting planes to prevent the Twitterverse from tracking his flights. Accounts such as I Fly Bernard and Bernard’s Airplane have been monitoring the billionaire’s private jet journeys to draw attention to the resulting pollution, as reported by Bloomberg.

More from Robb Report

Arnault, who is currently the world’s second-richest individual with a net worth of $137 billion, told Radio Classique on Monday that the LVMH group had a plane, and sold it. “The result now is that no one can see where I go because I rent planes when I use private planes,” Arnault explained to the LVMH-owned radio station.

C'est l'heure du bilan du mois de septembre 2022 pour les 5 avions de nos milliardaires:

– nombre de vols: 26✈️

– 48,4 heures de vol ⏱️

– vol le plus court: 30min 🤡

– CO2 émis: 203 tonnes 🔥🔥🔥

The billionaire’s son, Antoine Arnault, who is an LVMH board member and the director of communications for Louis Vuitton, added that the Tweets reporting where the jet is could also be bad for business. “It’s not very good that our competitors can know where we are at any moment,” he said during the interview. “That can give ideas, it can also give leads, clues.”

It’s not just Arnault catching flak, either. Back in September, I Fly Bernard called out Kering’s CEO François-Henri Pinault for flying from Venice to Paris and back in one day. The account also pointed out that private planes flying the wealthy around France emitted 224 tons of carbon into the atmosphere in September alone. The environmental impact has not gone unnoticed by French lawmakers. In fact, some of the country’s politicians are advocating taxing the rich for using private jets.

Stateside, Elon Musk is facing similar online wrath. The Tesla CEO, who is now the world’s richest individual with a fortune of $208 billion, recently sparked controversy when an account called ElonJet reported that he flew just nine minutes from San Jose to San Francisco in his private Gulfstream. Musk has called the account “a security risk” and asked the young man who runs it to delete it.

LVMH Signs Energy Efficiency Pact With Chinese Developer Hang Lung Properties - WWD,"Tue, 25 Oct 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikAFodHRwczovL3d3ZC5jb20vc3VzdGFpbmFiaWxpdHkvYnVzaW5lc3MvbHZtaC1lbmVyZ3ktZWZmaWNpZW5jeS1wYWN0LWNoaW5lc2Utc2hvcHBpbmctbWFsbC1kZXZlbG9wZXItaGFuZy1sdW5nLXByb3BlcnRpZXMtYWRyaWVsLWNoYW4tMTIzNTQwMDY5NS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS — Energy sobriety. The phrase may have been coined by French president Emmanuel Macron as part of his plan to reduce national power consumption, but like any good trend, LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton is taking it global.

The world’s largest luxury group is partnering with Hong Kong-based real estate developer Hang Lung Properties to reduce their energy consumption. LVMH head of image and environment Antoine Arnault and Hang Lung vice chair Adriel Chan took part in a splashy signing ceremony Tuesday, with the groups committing to a three-year partnership.

Hang Lung Properties will cut its energy consumption by 18 percent by 2025 across its 100 shopping malls, in part by turning off shops’ lights outside of business hours, while LVMH committed to measuring and tracking energy consumption at its stores and sourcing 70 percent of its materials within 300 miles. This follows LVMH’s overall energy reduction plan, which aims to cut consumption 10 percent worldwide by October 2023, which was announced Sept. 15.

“As far as sustainable development is concerned, I think we are pioneers – as far as philosophy is concerned, and as far as mindset is concerned,” said Arnault of his efforts to overhaul the group.

“As virtual spaces continue to flourish, we strongly believe that physical experience must retain its importance, because it constitutes one of life’s enjoyable pleasures…[and] the excellence of our stores extends to their environmental excellence,” he said. Arnault noted that they do not always have direct control of their properties and thus are not able to ensure those shopping center units adhere to LVMH’s environmental standards. “Ambitious environmental objectives must therefore be shared by both partners or there is a risk that these goals will not be achieved.”

Arnault praised Hang Lung for working collaboratively: “A landlord that shares our environmental ambitions as well as our belief that partnerships are a powerful driver for positive change,” he said. LVMH has 97 stores in mainland China through Hang Lung Properties.

“This partnership will make a positive impact in real estate and retail globally,” said Chan, noting that China aims for carbon neutrality in 2060, while the group aims for 2050. “This brings me to one of my favorite aspects of sustainability, the fact that it is a positive sum game, in what often feels like a zero-sum world. We’re setting an important example for the entire real estate sector. And we hope that it will inspire many more collaborations with our other tenants, and for LVMH with their other real estate partners.”

Arnault noted that they are now seeking out similar agreements with property groups in the U.S. and Europe.

The signing was part of LVMH’s “Life 360 in Stores” conference, which awarded some of the group’s maisons including Hublot, Berluti, Fendi and Loewe, as well as multibrand retailers Sephora, DFS and Le Bon Marché, for innovations.

LVMH environment development director Hélène Valade discussed the company’s commitment to reducing its energy use. “We have been in a context of very high tension on the energy market, in particular on the electricity and power market and we have tried to act proactively to present a plan for energy sobriety,” she said. “We do things which are more profound in terms of energy efficiency, because we are talking about issues which are complex, sophisticated in a city.”

Éléonore de Boysson, president of DFS in Europe and the Middle East, said the group’s Paris department store La Samaritaine has reduced its energy consumption significantly. While they don’t have hard numbers just yet, it could be up to 40 percent, she estimated. De Boysson noted the historical building installed all LED lighting during its renovation, and that DFS recently launched an internal education campaign for employees. “It was easier because we have a very young team, and all the young people have a very high awareness of these issues, so it was quite easy to mobilize them,” she said.

The reductions are also helping the bottom line and making the financial argument for environmental programs, said Valade. “We can also talk about the economic challenge, because the power and electricity invoices are going down, and this supports the environmental transition that we need.”

Stores are reporting bimonthly numbers on energy use so the group can accurately set targets and monitor reductions, group deputy director of environment Alexandre Capelli told WWD. The plan has been implemented across France, and will be applied across Europe on Nov. 1. It will roll out to the rest of the world in the first quarter of 2023 in order for the group to reach its targets by the end of the year.

The conference also served as a small preview of an upcoming retail, real estate and climate forum that will be cohosted by LVMH and Hang Lung to discuss further ways property developers can reduce their energy use.

Valade said the conference is the first of its kind and aimed at “cocreating” solutions. “It is also the first time with LVMH and the Hang Lung team to define the duty of each one to ameliorate the environmental management of boutiques, in a collaborative partnership,” she told WWD. “The precise measures are not yet defined, but we thought it would be more effective to sit down with LVMH teams and operational teams to discuss and decide formats to make our work, construction, mobilization and valuation more efficient.”

“We are highly anticipating it,” she added.

That conference will take place Nov. 24 and 25 simultaneously in Paris, Hong Kong and Shanghai.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.7138678431510925}",positive,0.7138678431510925,1

Hang Lung Properties, which owns a hundred malls in China, has notably committed to cutting its energy consumption by 18% by 2025, to turning off shops’ lights outside business hours, and to ensuring the presence of electricity meters. For its part, LVMH’s commitments include sourcing 70% of its materials from within a radius of 500 kilometres, along with measuring and tracking energy consumption at its stores. The two partners’ objective is to reduce their environmental impact while at the same time ensuring the health of customers and employees, with special emphasis on indoor air quality, for example by installing air quality sensors in all stores.

This cooperation with a major landlord will enable LVMH to achieve more quickly its environmental objectives thanks to swift and effective implementation of the standards set by the LIFE 360 roadmap. This includes progress at stores whose premises are owned by third parties outside the Group.

This initial agreement is groundbreaking in scope and consolidates efforts to achieve the LVMH Group’s announced target of a 10% cut in energy consumption worldwide by October 2023.

The partnership was announced in conjunction with the LIFE360 in Stores event on October 25-26, part of LVMH’s LIFE 360 environmental initiative. Alongside this new partnership, the event celebrates best practices in energy performance at the Group’s stores, with seven awards going to the most outstanding achievements.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.8265313506126404}",neutral,0.8265313506126404,0
LVMH is about to buy the world's most prestigious art gallery? The multinational of galleries meets the multinational of ... - nss magazine,"Mon, 31 Oct 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiOGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5zc21hZy5jb20vZW4vYXJ0LWRlc2lnbi8zMTMwMC9sdm1oLWdhZ29zaWFu0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The relationship between contemporary art and luxury fashion is becoming increasingly close. This is proven by the initiatives of François Pinault, CEO of Kering, owner of the Christie's auction house for over twenty years, as well as patron of Palazzo Grassi and Punta Della Dogana in Venice and the more recently inaugurated Bourse de Commerce in Paris. This is also demonstrated by the ambitions of LVMH founder and chairman Bernard Arnault, machete, collector, and head of the Louis Vuitton Foundation, which has its Frank O' Gehry-designed headquarters in Paris. But a new acquisition could open up unexpected scenarios, linking art galleries and the top echelons of luxury even tighter, more fragile, and even more complex, following a merger between multinationals that in addition to changing the dynamics of the contemporary art scene could set a significant precedent in the world of collectors.

According to a rumor launched in Italy on 24 October by Dagospia and reported by ArtTribune, the second richest man in the world after Elon Musk, according to Forbes, Bernard Arnault, is in negotiations with Larry Gagosian, a Californian patron of Armenian origin, for the acquisition of the eponymous mega-gallery, founded in Los Angeles in 1980 and which today has 19 branches and two shops around the world. A rumor that began to spread during Paris Art Week among the stands of the new Paris+ fair, which Artnews and WWD immediately denied. Yet, according to Kenny Schachter, art critic a, and curator, the news would not only be true, but the negotiations would already have been concluded. ""Breaking news!"" - commented Schachter under the detailed portrait of Gagosian intent, on his knees, on getting an unknown lady to slip a pump: «The Gagosian Gallery has been sold to Bernard Arnault's LVMH. The commodification of art as just another collectible fashion accessory and luxury object is now complete.»

For Arnault, controlling the wide-spread Gagosian empire would mean having control of 100 of the world's most highly rated artists as well as the possibility of launching young artists as the art dealer recently did with Jadé Fadojutimi and Anne Weyant, thus significantly shaking up the art market. If the news were true, a large gallery would become part of a multinational company for the first time. But many questions remain unanswered beyond the truthfulness of the news itself: what will Gagosian's network of galleries become in the hands of Arnault? How will the art business change? And how will it be integrated with the group's other businesses? Indeed, many wondered what would happen to the entire structure of Larry Gagosian who is 77 years old and has no heirs, perhaps Arnault's move could be the answer.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999828338623047}",neutral,0.9999828338623047,0
LVMH reports 28% revenue growth in first nine months - DFNIonline.com,"Wed, 12 Oct 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRmbmlvbmxpbmUuY29tL2xhdGVzdC1uZXdzL2x2bWgtcmVwb3J0cy0yOC1yZXZlbnVlLWdyb3d0aC1maXJzdC1uaW5lLW1vbnRocy0xMi0xMC0yMDIyL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, luxury products group, recorded revenue of 56.5bn euros in the first nine months of 2022, up 28% compared to the same period of 2021.

Organic revenue growth was 20%. In the third quarter, organic revenue growth was 19%, in line with the trends observed in the first half of the year.

Europe, the United States and Japan, up sharply since the start of the year, benefitted from the

demand of local customers and the recovery in international travel. Asia (including China) saw a lower level of growth over the first nine months of 2022, though growth in the latest quarter accelerated there due to the partial easing of health restrictions.

In Selective Retailing, revenue growth was 30% (20% in organic) in the first nine months of

2022. DFS, which is part-owned by LVMH, was affected by the continuing lack of travel, owing to ongoing health restrictions in Asia.

The Wines & Spirits business group recorded revenue growth of 23% over the first nine months (14% in organic). LVMH’s Champagne Maisons “enjoyed excellent momentum”, which increased pressure on supplies. Growth was particularly strong in Europe, the United States and Japan. Hennessy cognac was driven by its consistent strategy of value creation. The policy of price increases across all regions offset the effects of the logistical disruptions in the United States and the impact of health restrictions in China. Moët Hennessy strengthened its global portfolio of wines with the acquisition of the Joseph Phelps vineyard, in Napa Valley, California.

The Fashion & Leather Goods business group recorded revenue growth of 31% in the first nine

months of 2022 (24% in organic). Many new products were unveiled, in leather goods notably, as well as in watches. The Tambour Twenty collector’s watch, embodied by Bradley Cooper, ambassador of the Maison was immediately out of stock. Christian Dior continued to achieve remarkable growth in all its product lines. After three years of renovations, the birthplace of the Maison at 30 Avenue Montaigne in Paris, which reopened at the start of the year to offer a new vision of the Maison Dior, has been successful. Celine saw very strong growth resulting from the success of Hedi Slimane’s creations, as did Loewe, driven by the strong creativity of J.W.Anderson. Loro Piana maintains good momentum. Fendi, where Kim Jones brings his talents to the Maison, celebrated the 25th anniversary of its iconic Baguette bag with an exceptional fashion show in New York.

The Perfumes & Cosmetics business group saw revenue growth of 19% (12% in organic) over the first nine months of 2022, Christian Dior strengthened its lead in all its key markets. Perfumes grew sharply due to the continued success of Sauvage, Miss Dior and J’adore, further strengthened by its latest creation Parfum d’Eau. Dior Addict in makeup and Prestige in skincare also contributed to the Maison’s rapid growth. Guerlain continued to grow, due in large part to its Abeille Royale skincare line, its Aqua Allegoria collection and its perfume line l’Art et la Matière. Parfums Givenchy benefitted from the continued success of its fragrances. The Stella skincare line by Stella McCartney was launched using an environmental approach, originating from the LVMH Beauty R&D centre.

The Watches & Jewelry business group recorded revenue growth of 23% (16% in organic) in

the first nine months of 2022. Tiffany & Co. was driven by strong momentum in the United States.

The new collection of Lock unisex bracelets was rolled out in North America. Bulgari continued to strengthen its collections. Its new high jewelry and watch line Eden: The Garden of Wonders was showcased in Shanghai and Beijing, and the Maison’s jewelry creation and manufacturing talent were revealed in the film “Inside the Dream”. Chaumet’s “Végétal” exhibition celebrated nature over the course of the summer in Paris. Fred opened its first retrospective exhibition at the Palais de Tokyo in Paris, which is a success. In the watch business, TAG Heuer unveiled its new Caliber E4 – Porsche Edition smart watch and Hublot continued the countdown to the 2022 Football World Cup as its official

timekeeper.

Outlook

Against an uncertain geopolitical and economic backdrop, the group says it is confident in the continuation of current growth and will maintain a policy of cost control and selective investment.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 1.0}",positive,1.0,1
LVMH Reports $55.1 Billion in Revenue for First 9 Months - The Fashion Law,"Tue, 11 Oct 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWZhc2hpb25sYXcuY29tL2x2bWgtcmVwb3J0cy01NS0xLWJpbGxpb24taW4tcmV2ZW51ZS1mb3ItZmlyc3QtOS1tb250aHMtZHJpdmVuLWJ5LWxvY2FsLWRlbWFuZC10cmF2ZWwv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton recorded revenue of 56.5 billion euros ($55.1 billion) for the first nine months of 2022, up 28 percent compared to the same period of 2021. Revenue for the third-quarter (ending on September 30) totaled 19.8 billion euros ($19.2 billion), up 19 percent compared to Q3 2021. The luxury goods titan – which owns Louis Vuitton, Dior, Celine, and Givenchy, among an array of other brands – highlighted “sharp” sales increases in Europe, the United States, and Japan thanks to “solid demand of local customers,” as well as “the recovery in international travel,” and as usual, it pointed to the might of its Fashion & Leather Goods division, which generates almost 50 percent of its total revenue.

Delving into its biggest division, LVMH reported that revenue for the Fashion & Leather Goods business group grew by 31 percent in the first nine months of 2022 to 21.3 billion euros ($20.75 billion). LVMH pointed to Louis Vuitton, including the success of “many new products [which] were unveiled [over the past 9 months], in leather goods notably, as well as in watches.” The 200 Tambour Twenty collector’s watches, for instance, were “immediately out of stock” when they were released last month. The group’s second largest fashion brand Dior, which boasted slightly higher growth in Q3 than Louis Vuitton, has “continued to achieve remarkable growth in all its product lines,” per LVMH, which notes the “excellent performance of leather goods and ready-to-wear” and the “continued success of icons like Lady Dior.”

Meanwhile, “Celine saw very strong growth resulting from the success of Hedi Slimane’s creations,” namely, “strong progress of ready-to-wear” and “success of new high-end leather line for Triomphe and 16 models,” as did Loewe, where sales were driven by the good performance of leather goods lines Puzzle and Hammock,” according to LVMH. And still yet, “Loro Piana maintains good momentum” driven by the “great success” of its Resort collection; Marc Jacobs has shown “sustained growth of online sales,” as has been the message from LVMH in the past several quarters; and Rimowa saw “strong demand” again thanks to an increase in summer travel. (The mention of Givenchy was limited to its “continued store network expansion and renovation,” with still no mention of the success of (of lack thereof) Matthew Williams’ designs.)

In addition to Rimowa benefitting from a return to travel, LVMH’s Selective Retailing division, which houses duty-free retailer DFS, saw a big boost – up 30 percent for the first 9 months of the year. Sales activity for DFS is “still impacted by lockdowns in Hong Kong and Macao,” but it is also engaging in “progressive reopening in North America, Abu Dhabi, and Japan.” Also under the Selective retailing umbrella is Sephora, which “enjoyed excellent performance with a strong rebound in its in-store activity,” with momentum being “particularly strong in North America, France, and the Middle East.”

With revenue growth of 19 percent over the first 9 months of 2022, LVMH says that its Perfumes & Cosmetics business group maintained its “highly selective distribution strategy” and saw “strong momentum” for fragrances.

The Watches & Jewelry business group recorded revenue growth of 23 percent for the same period, thanks, in large part to, “excellent” performances of Tiffany and Bulgari, with the latter proving to be the stronger performer in Q3. In terms of Tiffany, sales are being driven by strong momentum in the U.S., LVMH states, as well as an array of “successful launches,” including the Lock bracelet in U.S., an international rollout of the Knot, and High Jewelry collection Blue Book in Asia. The group’s management said during an earnings call on Tuesday that it is “hopeful” the Lock collection, which appears to be Tiffany’s attempt to compete with Cartier’s Love bracelet, “could be sizable in the future.” Management also specifically pointed to watches as a key source of growth, noting that watches are “a well-suited category for an inflationary environment.” (Gold similarly performs well in an inflationary environment.)

Geographically speaking, the group’s 9-month sales were up in Europe and the U.S., while “Asia (including China) saw a lower level of growth over the first nine months of 2022, though growth in the latest quarter accelerated there due to the partial easing of health restrictions.” China, in particular, continues to see low foot traffic in stores compared to 2019, LVMH management said, noting that while the situation improved from 2Q, traffic to stores still is not back to normal. “Numbers in China were more or less flat for Louis Vuitton in 3Q,” Bernstein’s Luca Solca asserted in a note on Tuesday.

As for trends in consumption from a regional perspective, LVMH Chief Financial Officer Jean Jacques Guiony said that “in fashion and leather goods, part of the business has shifted away from the U.S. and towards Europe as U.S. citizens benefit from the strength of the dollar.” More broadly, LVMH management revealed that digital growth has been slowing down over past year, as business in most markets (excluding China) shifts back to brick-and-mortar.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 1.0}",positive,1.0,1
Kanye West alleges Louis Vuitton offered him Virgil Abloh's artistic director role - REVOLT,"Mon, 10 Oct 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5yZXZvbHQudHYvYXJ0aWNsZS8yMDIyLTEwLTEwLzIxOTA0NC9rYW55ZS13ZXN0LWFsbGVnZXMtbG91aXMtdnVpdHRvbi1vZmZlcmVkLWhpbS12aXJnaWwtYWJsb2hzLWFydGlzdGljLWRpcmVjdG9yLXJvbGXSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Image Image Credit Getty Image Alt Kanye West, Virgil Abloh

There is no doubt that Kanye West will speak his mind, despite how people may feel about it. Most recently, Ye revealed he was in the running for a highly sought-after position that ultimately went to Virgil Abloh.

In an interview released on Friday (Oct. 7), West sat down with the French media outlet “Clique TV,” where he spoke about learning of the news that Abloh accepted the role of artistic director of menswear at Louis Vuitton.

“No one knows that I have been offered the deal by Bernard Arnault,” he said. “No one knows that the deal was pulled. I used to call myself the ‘Louis Vuitton Don.’ So when Virgil was at the house, there was a lot of pain and jealousy that I was dealing with. And also I would sometimes get mad because I would feel that certain designs could be better.”

West said that although he felt “pain” and “jealousy” toward Abloh, his political stance prevented them from working together before Abloh’s passing. “So there was a lot of pain and trauma and unpacking in the idea. I would go back to Calabasas with no production, and I would have sweatshirts; that’s what we had. And Virgil would have access to the house, and we were never able to do a collaboration, I think because they considered me to be toxic because I had a political opinion and because I wouldn’t wear a [Black Lives Matter] shirt [and] because I would wear a red hat.”

He added, “I have to say that the fact that I wanted to vote for [Donald] Trump was the thing that sent me to the hospital. Scooter Braun would say, ‘Hey, you know that’s going to mess up your career.’ Sakiya Sandifer would say, ‘You don’t want to be on the wrong side of history.’ So imagine being in an environment where someone as vocal as me is told by every single person around them that they can’t say what they believe in and that I was a bad person if I believed in something different from all the people in Hollywood.”

The 45-year-old multi-hyphenate artist has been vocal about his political stance and right to have an opinion lately, specifically on his Instagram and Twitter accounts, which he has since been restricted from using. However, it did not stop Ye from releasing a 30-minute documentary, LAST WEEK, on his YouTube channel. REVOLT previously reported that the short flick shows the father of four spending time with his children, among other Kanye-esque things, including showing Adidas executives a pornographic film during one of their meetings.

LVMH Signs Energy Efficiency Pact With Chinese Developer Hang Lung Properties - Yahoo Movies Canada,"Tue, 25 Oct 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vY2EubW92aWVzLnlhaG9vLmNvbS9sdm1oLXNpZ25zLWVuZXJneS1lZmZpY2llbmN5LXBhY3QtMTYxNTU5NTk2Lmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS — Energy sobriety. The phrase may have been coined by French president Emmanuel Macron as part of his plan to reduce national power consumption, but like any good trend, LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton is taking it global.

The world’s largest luxury group is partnering with Hong Kong-based real estate developer Hang Lung Properties to reduce their energy consumption. LVMH head of image and environment Antoine Arnault and Hang Lung vice chair Adriel Chan took part in a splashy signing ceremony Tuesday, with the groups committing to a three-year partnership.

More from WWD

Hang Lung Properties will cut its energy consumption by 18 percent by 2025 across its 100 shopping malls, in part by turning off shops’ lights outside of business hours, while LVMH committed to measuring and tracking energy consumption at its stores and sourcing 70 percent of its materials within 300 miles. This follows LVMH’s overall energy reduction plan, which aims to cut consumption 10 percent worldwide by October 2023, which was announced Sept. 15.

“As far as sustainable development is concerned, I think we are pioneers – as far as philosophy is concerned, and as far as mindset is concerned,” said Arnault of his efforts to overhaul the group.

“As virtual spaces continue to flourish, we strongly believe that physical experience must retain its importance, because it constitutes one of life’s enjoyable pleasures…[and] the excellence of our stores extends to their environmental excellence,” he said. Arnault noted that they do not always have direct control of their properties and thus are not able to ensure those shopping center units adhere to LVMH’s environmental standards. “Ambitious environmental objectives must therefore be shared by both partners or there is a risk that these goals will not be achieved.”

Story continues

Arnault praised Hang Lung for working collaboratively: “A landlord that shares our environmental ambitions as well as our belief that partnerships are a powerful driver for positive change,” he said. LVMH has 97 stores in mainland China through Hang Lung Properties.

“This partnership will make a positive impact in real estate and retail globally,” said Chan, noting that China aims for carbon neutrality in 2060, while the group aims for 2050. “This brings me to one of my favorite aspects of sustainability, the fact that it is a positive sum game, in what often feels like a zero-sum world. We’re setting an important example for the entire real estate sector. And we hope that it will inspire many more collaborations with our other tenants, and for LVMH with their other real estate partners.”

Arnault noted that they are now seeking out similar agreements with property groups in the U.S. and Europe.

The signing was part of LVMH’s “Life 360 in Stores” conference, which awarded some of the group’s maisons including Hublot, Berluti, Fendi and Loewe, as well as multibrand retailers Sephora, DFS and Le Bon Marché, for innovations.

LVMH environment development director Hélène Valade discussed the company’s commitment to reducing its energy use. “We have been in a context of very high tension on the energy market, in particular on the electricity and power market and we have tried to act proactively to present a plan for energy sobriety,” she said. “We do things which are more profound in terms of energy efficiency, because we are talking about issues which are complex, sophisticated in a city.”

Éléonore de Boysson, president of DFS in Europe and the Middle East, said the group’s Paris department store La Samaritaine has reduced its energy consumption significantly. While they don’t have hard numbers just yet, it could be up to 40 percent, she estimated. De Boysson noted the historical building installed all LED lighting during its renovation, and that DFS recently launched an internal education campaign for employees. “It was easier because we have a very young team, and all the young people have a very high awareness of these issues, so it was quite easy to mobilize them,” she said.

The reductions are also helping the bottom line and making the financial argument for environmental programs, said Valade. “We can also talk about the economic challenge, because the power and electricity invoices are going down, and this supports the environmental transition that we need.”

Stores are reporting bimonthly numbers on energy use so the group can accurately set targets and monitor reductions, group deputy director of environment Alexandre Capelli told WWD. The plan has been implemented across France, and will be applied across Europe on Nov. 1. It will roll out to the rest of the world in the first quarter of 2023 in order for the group to reach its targets by the end of the year.

The conference also served as a small preview of an upcoming retail, real estate and climate forum that will be cohosted by LVMH and Hang Lung to discuss further ways property developers can reduce their energy use.

Valade said the conference is the first of its kind and aimed at “cocreating” solutions. “It is also the first time with LVMH and the Hang Lung team to define the duty of each one to ameliorate the environmental management of boutiques, in a collaborative partnership,” she told WWD. “The precise measures are not yet defined, but we thought it would be more effective to sit down with LVMH teams and operational teams to discuss and decide formats to make our work, construction, mobilization and valuation more efficient.”

“We are highly anticipating it,” she added.

That conference will take place Nov. 24 and 25 simultaneously in Paris, Hong Kong and Shanghai.

HANNAH TRAORE TAKES LONDON

Hannah Traore likes to mix it up. The 27-year-old opened her Lower East Side gallery this January, and the buzzed-about space challenges art-world norms in a few ways: the programming is dedicated to historically marginalized voices (which reflects Traore’s own Canadian, Malian, Jewish, and Muslim background), and the artwork is displayed in a non-traditional gallery setting, where warm hues and rounded archways invite gallery-goers to get comfy around the art.

Since I met her a few months ago, I’ve been curious to learn more about what makes her tick, and more importantly, to find out how she likes to party. Where better to do so than in Londontown? I met up with Hannah at birthday festivities for Antwaun Sargent, a director at Gagosian and member of the New York art elite.

7:54 p.m.: I arrive to a very chic townhouse in Mayfair, where a string of servers in sleek black vests are waiting to greet me with a glass of champagne. It’s a crisp evening in London, and I am feeling like royalty in the Burberry trench coat I thrifted on Brick Lane earlier that day and consequently won’t shut up about (though I’m hardly the only Burberry in the room). I spot Hannah, who is looking predictably fashionable in a sculptural black mini dress by Tyler Mcgillivary and hot pink sock boots, hanging out by the DJ booth.

7:55 p.m.: “Hi cutie!” she trills. Hannah is an exceptionally warm person—to be in her orbit is to feel her sunshine. Also to be in her orbit, I’ve found, is to have lots of photos taken of you. A quick skim of her BFA profile tells me she’s been captured precisely 378 times at events. (And, not like I obsess over this or anything but, for reference, there are 67 photos of me on there, and Hannah and I have been in the art circuit for pretty much exactly the same amount of time.) I’m in socialite territory here. (P.S. please do not look at my BFA profile—the photography is far too honest.)

8:27 p.m.: Which brings me to the birthday boy. Antwaun Sargent, clad head-to-toe in Alexander McQueen, jokingly implores me not to publish his age. “Tell them I’m turning 90!” he laughs (I think he’s in his 30s.) He and Hannah met a few years back, after Hannah—who was interning for curator Isolde Brielmaier, who is now deputy director of the New Museum—cold-emailed him asking for advice about starting a gallery. “I said, ‘Think about having a distinct point of view. There’s no point in starting a gallery and just showing whatever. Show people of your generation,’” Antwaun recalled. “The best gallerists, the thing they did was capture the zeitgeist of their generation. I told her to do that, because we don’t have that yet.”

The meeting was a formative moment for Hannah. “No one knew who the fuck I was, and he took the time to meet with me and just listen to me,” she said. “I felt so seen.”

9:01 p.m.: The crowd is starting to thicken up, so we weave our way upstairs where a truly decadent spread of food awaits us—fish crudo, artichoke hearts, decorated portobello mushroom caps, and some truly divine steak tartare. “This looks like that Sofia Coppola Marie Antoinette movie,” she says. I stain my new coat with an artichoke Negroni and momentarily consider flipping over the food table in anger. But ascendant photographer Tyler Mitchell appears, and we congratulate him on his London debut at Gagosian. “It was the thing where you’re unsure, you’re unsure, you’re unsure. Then Deborah Roberts came by to see it and said it was good, so I feel good,” he said with a smile.

9:47 p.m.: Each of us run into approximately 20 jillion people we know, and get separated for a spell. We reconvene in a truly atrocious bathroom line, where Hannah spritzes us both with her perfume—a very piney, masculine scent, which surprises me. There’s rumblings about Antwaun’s birthday cake coming out soon, and the image of Marie Antoinette returns to me.

10:41 p.m.: The dancing starts to pick up. We run into Storm Ascher, who runs Miami’s Superpositions gallery and is one of Hannah’s best friends. Bear hugs as they greet each other. “We were in 1-54 art fair together,” Hannah told me. “She knew I was struggling with sales, and I’ll never forget that she brought her collectors up to my booth. I could actually cry. In what world! From the outside, we’re direct competition.”

We also chat with Adebayo Bolaji, who’s shown work at Hannah’s gallery, and the conversation turns to the pros and cons of London. They’ve both experienced recent instances of racist micro-aggressions come their way from locals, and of course the topic of how expensive the city is comes up. Regardless, Hannah loves London’s intellectual atmosphere and the general British milieu, and confesses a ten-year goal to open a second space here.

Over the course of the evening, I am left with the impression that it must be pretty good to be Hannah Traore. In what world! she’d asked. But this is Hannah’s world, cultivated in part thanks to her cocoon of positivity. I ended the night feeling much more included than I ever have at an art-world party (seriously, don’t look at my BFA profile). I tell her as much.

“That snippy, extremely homogenous, white art world is not me,” she replied. “They don’t know who I am, and I don’t know them. The art world that I’m a part of is fucking excellent. It’s tonight. It feels like family.”

GAGO SAYS LVMH IS A NO-GO

As we know here at Wet Paint, the rumor mill is relentless. It is especially relentless for one man in particular, the blue-blazer clad maverick Larry Gagosian. I and others have been flies buzzing around his ears for a long time now (there’s so much material! May-December relationships, artist representation swaps—something for everyone). But the subject that is perhaps most intriguing to the art trade is the mysterious succession plan for the 77-year-old’s gallery empire. In London this week, one rumor has been pin-balling around quite rapidly: that French luxury holding company LVMH, which is owned by mega-collector Bernard Arnault, is set to buy up Gagosian gallery in its entirety.

Many heard it first on Nota Bene, the podcast run by my predecessor Nate Freeman and art advisor Benjamin Godsill. “I hear there’s whispers, and I don’t know if this is true, that [LVMH] may be making a move into the art space by acquiring a major art space… when there’s no succession plan in place, rumors fly,” Godsill said in the final minute of the show’s most recent episode, before Freeman cut in: “Rumors! Just rumors, Ben!”

The prospect is tantalizing. François Pinault, founder of the luxury conglomerate Kering and Arnault’s business rival, owns Christie’s, which, along with Gagosian, is one of the few art businesses with a brand strong enough to have name recognition beyond the art world.

Gagosian opened his first gallery in Los Angeles in 1980. Now, it has 19 locations and represents 86 artists and estates. The exact size of the business is unknown, but Forbes floated a $1 billion figure back in 2012.

Alas, several sources close to Gagosian have put the kibosh on the notion, saying there’s no substance to it. In 2019, the gallery named Andrew Fabricant as COO, positioning the art-industry veteran as Gagosian’s natural successor to keep the business go-going. Reached for comment, a spokesperson for the gallery said, “The company is not for sale.”

We’ll catch you next time for another round on the Gagosian rumor mill. Thanks for playing.

WET PAINT QUESTIONNAIRE

Summer has come and past, but vacation photos last forever. Last week I asked who in the art world had the most enviable summer vacation, and Robert Dimin nominated Journal Gallery‘s Michael Nevin, who took off to a Greek island for a few weeks. “It looked super chill…” Dimin said. Curator Lolita Cros cheekily suggested that Gagosian interns probably had the best vacations this summer, and on a similar note, artist Diego Benavente Zúñiga added Anna Delvey‘s “inclusive resort package stay on the tax payer’s dime.” Meee-yow.

For my next question, because its October: Which museum could you plausibly believe is haunted? Email me your response at [email protected].

The accusation comes after the rapper, who legally changed his name to Ye, declared Arnault his new rival and biggest competitor during a fashion show. According to WWD, the “Jesus Walks” artist addressed the CEO during his surprise YZY show on Monday (Oct. 3) during Paris Fashion Week.

“Bernard Arnault is my new Drake,” Ye exclaimed. “After my first collection, Yeezy One, got more views than Chanel, I had a meeting with Bernard Arnault and he offered me a deal for the Kanye West line, and three months after that, he pulled on the deal. So my second collection didn’t have a producer.”

At the show, the Chicago-bred artist sported a “White Lives Matter” shirt, sparking pushback. The message was also plastered across a pull-over worn by a model on the runway, as well as on Candice Owens who attended the showcase. The rapper responded by calling Black Lives Matter a scam.

“EVERYONE KNOWS BLACK LIVES MATTER WAS A SCAM,” expressed Yeezy on Instagram. “NOW IT’S OVER. YOU’RE WELCOME.”

Ye Lashes Out at LVMH Chief Bernard Arnault - Yahoo Movies Canada,"Tue, 04 Oct 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vY2EubW92aWVzLnlhaG9vLmNvbS95ZS1sYXNoZXMtbHZtaC1jaGllZi1iZXJuYXJkLTIyNTIxNDg0Ny5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Ye is keeping the controversy coming — and again going after LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton chief executive officer Bernard Arnault.

The designer and rapper, formerly known as Kanye West, riled up fashion — and the internet at large — with his Yzy fashion show in Paris on Monday.

More from WWD

The online spotlight shone brightest on his T-shirt, which read “White Lives Matter” — which the Anti-Defamation League deems “a white supremacist phrase that originated in early 2015 as a racist response to the Black Lives Matter movement.” Ye said the shirt “says it all,” although many found it offensive and the outcry over his actions is ongoing.

But on the sidelines, Ye kept at Arnault, whom he declared to be “my new Drake” and “the number-one competition” at the show Monday.

Arnault leads the world’s largest luxury house, ranked by Forbes to be the world’s second-richest person with a fortune of $153.8 billion, including a gain of $9.1 billion on Tuesday alone.

But Ye’s beef — which so far seems to be one-sided — metastasized into something else Tuesday on Instagram, where he made a series of controversial claims.

“SPANK MY HAND WITH THE RULER(S) I’LL GO SIT IN THE ‘PRINCIPAL(S)’ OFFICE CAN’T WE TALK ABOUT MORE IMPORTANT THINGS LIKE HOW LATE THE SHOW WAS OR HOW BERNARD ARNAULT KILLED MY BEST FRIEND EVERYONE’S GOT A RIGHT TO AN OPINION RIGHT THERE’S MINE,” Ye wrote in a post, featuring a bust of Roman poet Virgil.

LVMH has not publicly responded to Ye’s statements and a spokesperson did not immediately respond to a WWD query.

Virgil Abloh — one of fashion’s most beloved designers and the first Black man to be men’s artistic director at Louis Vuitton — died from a rare form of cancer at 41 last year. Both Abloh and Ye interned at another LVMH house, Fendi, in 2009.

However, Arnault championed Abloh and in 2021, when LVMH raised its stake in the designer’s Off-White brand, the billionaire said he was “thrilled” to be expanding the partnership.

Story continues

In another post on Tuesday that seemed to bring more heat than light to the situation, Ye said the streetwear brand Supreme is owned by LVMH — it’s not, VF Corp. bought the brand in 2020 from private equity backers — and that “IN WAR THEY WILL SEND YOUR OWN PEOPLE AT YOU. GOOD ONE BERNARD.”

One of the Twitter accounts bemoaned the fact that the LVMH jet had ceased to be registered in France.

The world’s second-richest man has had enough of the Twitterverse tracking his every move in his private plane.

“Still no word from either Bernard Arnault or LVMH on the subject of private jets,” Bernard’s Airplane wrote on September 10. “So Bernard, are you hiding?”

“Indeed, with all these stories, the group had a plane and we sold it,” Arnault said on the LVMH-owned radio station. “The result now is that no one can see where I go because I rent planes when I use private planes.”

Arnault has a net worth of almost US$133 billion, surpassing Amazon’s Jeff Bezos as the world’s second-richest man, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.

His son, Antoine Arnault , defended the use of private jets on a television show last week. “This plane is a work tool,” he said on France 5’s C à Vous.

“Our industry is hyper-competitive,” he said, and a private plane gives executives an edge in the race to be first to a new product or deal. LVMH sold its plane over the summer, he said.

In the recent radio interview alongside his father, the younger Arnault said there is another business reason for keeping the company’s travels secret.

“It’s not very good that our competitors can know where we are at any moment,” he said. “That can give ideas, it can also give leads, clues.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999840259552002}",neutral,0.9999840259552002,0

Inspired by artist cafés of 1920s Paris, Café 11 aims to curate distinctive experiences across the globe for members. Membership to Café 11 comes in the form of an NFT featuring bespoke digital artwork by John P. Dessereau , a New York-based artist and one of the 3000 creatives in the FWB community.

This December’s Art Basel Miami Beach is the venue for the first Café 11 event. Apart from meeting fellow members, NFT holders will be able to participate in cognac tastings alongside food and music experiences over several days. Following the Basel event, NFT holders can access exclusive experiences internationally. From a strategic perspective, these events provide Hennessy with numerous opportunities to connect with customers and ultimately, they might buy some cognac.

The partnership leverages Hennessy’s 250-year legacy, with FWB’s aim of merging culture and cryptocurrency. It’s a great example of FWB supporting its artist community.

On November 4, FWB will mint 1,765 Café 11 NFTs, priced at $450. As one of the first luxury clubs powered by an NFT, the club benefits are open-ended in the web3 way. But with the Hennessy brand behind it, the barrier to entry is relatively low. That’s especially compared to a previous NFT that Hennessy sold for two bottles of Hennessy-8 cognac at a price of $226,450 each. That was in association with BlockBar, the alcohol NFT platform.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9986078143119812}",neutral,0.9986078143119812,0
The Brands: Why turning lights off is the right thing for LVMH and Valentino - the-spin-off.com,"Thu, 06 Oct 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZS1zcGluLW9mZi5jb20vbmV3cy9zdG9yaWVzL1RoZS1CcmFuZHMtV2h5LXR1cm5pbmctbGlnaHRzLW9mZi1pcy10aGUtcmlnaHQtdGhpbmctZm9yLUxWTUgtYW5kLVZhbGVudGluby0xNjcyM9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Small gestures can do much, like, for instance, switching lights off. Such a decision can help to cut costs, increasing efficiency and avoid waste, especially in days of energy emergency.











Some luxury players have actually started embracing this decision, like, for instance, LVMH Group and Maison Valentino.











Following the call of the President of the French Republic and the French government, the French luxury group LVMH has announced an energy efficiency plan as part of a concrete and immediate contribution to the national effort to face the recent – and, very probably, also future – energy emergency.











To address the current tensions on the electricity market, which are likely to increase this winter during consumption peaks, the LVMH Group has decided to reduce its electricity consumption as of October, first in France and then worldwide throughout the group.











Two key measures will enable a 10% reduction in energy consumption between October 2022 and October 2023: turning off the lighting of the Group’s Maison stores between 10 pm and 7 am and of the administrative sites at 9 pm; and the modification of indoor temperatures in all industrial sites, administrative sites and stores of -1 °C in winter compared to the usual temperature setting and +1 °C in summer compared to the usual air conditioning trigger temperatures.











In addition, LVMH will mobilize its 34,000 employees in France around new energy consumption behaviors focused, for instance, on launching a major awareness campaign around the New Energy Gestures like to turn off lighting, screens and computers, and unplug chargers, electric cars, and similar devices, choose alternatives to the elevator and to the printer, and manage consumption peaks.

People will also be encouraged to use the EcoWatt app, which allows them to manage their energy consumption at home according to peak demand.











Investments to complete the Group’s energy transition will be increased and will cover both energy management and renewable energy across the world.











A reflection on new lighting methods and the use of colors’ thermal qualities has also been engaged.











LVMH’s energy consumption in France is 354,000 MWh, equivalent to the annual electricity consumption of a city of 150,000 inhabitants. The Group had already announced in 2021 its desire to achieve 100% supply of renewable or low-carbon energy for all its sites for workshops, stores and offices by 2026. Today, the Group uses 100% green electricity in France and 39% renewable energy globally.











Also Valentino, the luxury brand of Italian origins that has already taken some steps towards a green transition, has started a new global initiative - Maison Valentino's Lights Off Campaign.











From October 6, 2022, the lights in Valentino boutiques have been turned off every day starting at 10pm globally, a decision in line with the maison’s conscious-driven mindset. This gesture involves around 95 boutiques, predicting a daily decrease in energy consumption of over 800 kWh, equal to the hourly consumption of over 13,000 traditional light bulbs.











Logos will be involved in the initiative, alongside the lighting of the shop windows, that of the sales areas and the lightboxes-backlit structures. The boutique warehouse lights will also remain off, while the emergency lights remain on in a quest to safeguard all its staff.











In Italy, about 80% of the energy Maison Valentino uses for its headquarters, boutiques and manufacturing sites comes from renewable sources. A 360° approach that permeates within the Maison’s green transition and in its conscious driven mindset, an essential pillar of the brand’s daily actions rooted in different business areas.









The plan of reducing consumption is a clear sign of an unwavering focus on the environment, both locally with an eye on territorial areas and globally. Valentino, thus, also speaks to its Community, inviting every single person to adopt a mindful approach also in matters of s of energy saving - to continue building, together, step by step, a better future for us and for all.

Dominique Muret Translated by

Cassidy STEPHENS Published

Oct 12, 2022

Despite an increasingly complex and fluctuating market, is staying the course. The number one in luxury goods has just closed a record third quarter, driven by its most profitable ""fashion & leather goods"" division, which achieved 9.68 billion euros between July and September 2022 with an organic increase of 22%, while over nine months it recorded a growth in sales of 24%, to 27.8 billion euros. An increase of 31% at current exchange rates. The latter has managed to cope with a geographical situation that has changed recently with a slowdown in the American market, but also with increased economic difficulties between recession, price increases, shortages of raw materials and geopolitical tensions.







Christian Dior shows remarkable growth this trimester - LVMH



This is a context that is pushing the group to be more cautious about its annual objectives, as CFO Jean-Jacques Guiony explained on Tuesday evening during a conference call with analysts: ""Frankly, 2022 has not been short on surprises, good or bad"".



While the rise in the dollar has been positive, the company is also facing headwinds such as ""the situation in Russia or the management of the pandemic in China"".

""We are doing our best to develop our brands and make the most of the year in conditions that are obviously different from those we had in mind a year ago when we drew up the budgets for 2022,"" he said.



Looking closely at the quarterly figures, LVMH seems to have managed to do better than expected. The ""fashion & leather goods"" division accelerated the pace in the third quarter to an increase of 22% (the previous quarter's growth was 19%), led once again by the group's leader, Christian , which saw sales increase in all categories and whose renovated boutique at 30 has become ""a very popular destination"", closely followed by , which delivered ""an excellent performance"". also experienced very strong growth, as did . Loro Piana continues to enjoy good momentum, as does , according to a company statement.



Over the first nine months of the year, the luxury giant progressed in all regions, but it saw the share of its sales in Asia, excluding Japan, decrease from 36% on September 30 2021, to 32% a year later, with a still weak growth of 2%, due to the restrictions that persist in several cities in China. Over the last three months alone, the situation is improving with a 6% increase in sales, compared to an 8% decline in the second quarter.



Nevertheless, Guiony again called for caution concerning the Chinese market still penalised by health restrictions. ""We can't really talk about a recovery in China. Things are better than they were in the second quarter, that's for sure, but they are not back to normal. We still have lockdowns here and there, supply chain disruptions and the level of traffic in shops across the country is nowhere near what it was in 2019. We are not operating under normal conditions.""



In China, sales continue to be driven mainly by the online channel, while in other markets in-store sales have taken over. However, e-commerce continues to record double-digit increases, accounting for 13% of total sales.







Quarterly organic revenue change by region - LVMH



Another geographical change is that recorded in recent months in North America, which has seen its momentum slow down with organic growth of 11% in the third quarter compared to 22% in the second quarter (up 19% over nine months), with this market accounting for 26% of total sales.



""A large number of American buyers have moved to Europe, where they are benefiting from a strong dollar, with a particularly positive impact on fashion and leather goods,"" explained Guiony, who rules out ""drastic measures"" in the short term concerning a possible price increase in Europe for the group's products, which are currently cheaper than in the United States. ""Currencies always fluctuate with ups and downs. There is nothing we can do about it.""



At the same time, the manager emphasises the good results that continue to be guaranteed by local customers in Europe, ""with significant progress especially in the United Kingdom and Germany"". In fact, in Europe outside France, which currently accounts for 16% of total turnover compared to 15% a year earlier, LVMH saw its sales jump by 36% in the third quarter (up 48% in the second quarter, up 43% over nine months).



For the end of the year, the group remains confident. In this respect, Guiony is cautious about the notion of an imminent crisis, which everyone is talking about. ""I wouldn't call it a recession, but a pre-announced recession. We are in a situation where the recession has not yet fully materialised,"" he noted, before concluding, ""The luxury industry is not immune to recession or economic shocks, we have seen that in the past, but we have also seen that when it happens, it doesn't last long and the strongest brands come out even stronger.""



However, the fourth quarter is likely to be much more complicated than the third, with the European market expected to stagnate between soaring energy costs, falling purchasing power and a likely slowdown in tourism.

Louis Vuitton CEO Bernard Arnault says he sold his private jet once people tracked it on Twitter - New York Post,"Mon, 17 Oct 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vbnlwb3N0LmNvbS8yMDIyLzEwLzE3L2xvdWlzLXZ1aXR0b24tY2VvLWJlcm5hcmQtYXJuYXVsdC1zYXlzLWhlLXNvbGQtaGlzLXByaXZhdGUtamV0LW9uY2UtcGVvcGxlLXRyYWNrZWQtaXQtb24tdHdpdHRlci_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"French mogul Bernard Arnault, the second richest person in the world by virtue of his stake in luxury goods maker LVMH, said he sold his private plane after Twitter users started tracking his flights online.

Arnault, the 73-year-old co-founder of the Paris-based conglomerate that sells popular luxury brands such as handbag maker Louis Vuitton and the wine and spirits giant Moët Hennessy, told French-language Radio Classique that he has been renting private jets after selling the company-owned aircraft.

His remarks were first reported by Bloomberg News.

Arnault said the decision to sell the company’s private jet was made after Twitter accounts such as “I Fly Bernard” and “Bernard’s Airplane” sprung up. These accounts were devoted solely to tracking the aircraft’s movements.

“Indeed, with all these stories, the group had a plane and we sold it,” Arnault, whose net worth was pegged by Forbes at $150.7 billion on Monday, told Radio Classique, which happens to be owned by LVMH.

“The result now is that no one can see where I go because I rent planes when I use private planes.”

Arnault was the subject of intense backlash in France for his use of a private jet. The Twitter accounts routinely tracked his flights and critics used the information to point out just how much pollution they cause.

The criticism even prompted some French politicians to propose a ban or a tax on private jets.

Antoine Arnault, Bernard’s son, appeared on a French television show last week and defended his father’s use of a private jet.

“This plane is a work tool,” he said. “Our industry is hyper-competitive.”

Having a private jet nearby gives the CEO a chance to be first to fly to a distant city to meet with other businesspeople about prospective deals and products, according to Antoine Arnault.

The younger Arnault said that selling the plane was a good idea because revealing his father’s location could tip off competitors to LVMH’s future plans.

“It’s not very good that our competitors can know where we are at any moment,” he said.

“That can give ideas, it can also give leads, clues.”

Arnault is one of several billionaires who have had their flights tracked on social media.

Last year, Jack Sweeney, a tech-savvy 19-year-old college student, founded the Twitter account @ElonsJet, which gives regular updates on flights taken by Tesla CEO Elon Musk, the world’s richest human, on his private plane.

Musk, who said that the site was a security risk, was so alarmed by Sweeney’s Twitter account that he contacted the student last year and offered him $5,000 to take it down.

“I don’t love the idea of being shot by a nutcase,” Musk wrote to Sweeney in a private message.

Sweeney turned down the $5,000 offer. He then demanded $50,000 from the Tesla chief.

Online users have also enlisted flight tracking software to keep tabs on the travel habits of stars such as Taylor Swift, Kylie Jenner, Drake, Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg, and others.

Several celebrities have come under fire for using private jets to take short flights even while publicly declaring their support for combating climate change.

Jenner, the social media influencer and reality television star, was deemed a “climate criminal” online after she boasted of taking private jets for short, three-minute flights for trips that most people would make by car in around 45 minutes.

Other A-list stars who have been flagged online for excessive use of private planes include Swift, Floyd Mayweather, Jay-Z, Alex Rodriguez, Blake Shelton, Steven Spielberg, Mark Wahlberg, and Oprah Winfrey.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999934434890747}",neutral,0.9999934434890747,0

Emma RUFFENACH Translated by

Nicola Mira Published

Oct 17, 2022

The exhibition’s venue is a historic dressed-stone building at 18 rue Vivienne, in one of Paris's central districts, close to the eponymous arcade home to ’s first boutique, right opposite the National Library of France. Since 2007, the building, with its courtyard and garden, has housed the headquarters and ateliers of ready-to-wear label Kenzo.







The colour red, here featured on a box with Kenzo’s logo, is the thread running through the exhibition - Kenzo



In an accident of history, the building once belonged to the nephew of Jean-Baptiste Colbert, a promoter of French arts and manufacturing under Louis XIV, and then hosted a trading house for silk and wool. “For the second time since 2013, Kenzo is taking part in the group’s ‘Private Days’ initiative,” said Camille Martinez, head of heritage and events at Kenzo. “With the theme ‘Savoir Faire Rêver’ (knowing how to make dreams), our goal is to showcase our expertise through the label’s heritage,” she added. On the ground floor, silhouettes from Kenzo’s first collections - from the label's well-preserved archives - are juxtaposed with looks by Nigo, Kenzo’s current creative director, cleverly encapsulating the label's history.



Immersed in a hip-hop atmosphere, visitors step into the world of Kenzo, amidst a plethora of printed patterns and a kaleidoscope of bright colours. The exhibition retraces the label’s history since it was founded in 1970 by the Japanese designer, who initially called it Jungle Jap - a nod to the Parisian urban jungle and the paintings of Henri ‘Le Douanier’ . “ wanted to remove his persona from the label,” said Salomé Dudemaine, exhibition curator and fashion historian. But the name [Jungle Jap] was hard to market in the USA, because it was perceived as devaluing and racist,” she added.

Ten years later, the label was renamed Kenzo, but the brand’s tiger symbol did survive the change. A fetish animal for the Japanese designer, the tiger is once again roaring on the trench coats of the Spring/Summer 2023 collection designed by Kenzo’s successor. The same goes for Kenzo’s favourite material, cotton, of which most of the garments on display are made. “In the early days, Takada used cotton through economic necessity, but then it became an aesthetic choice for him, because it's a fabric that lets the body breathe,” said Dudemaine. Many of the mannequins, whether displaying 1970s or contemporary looks, feature “the famous T-cut with butterfly sleeves, with which the designer wanted to set free the silhouette.”



Countless references to the label’s founder characterise the wardrobe now designed by Nigo. The label will celebrate its 53rd anniversary next April, and its creations are inspired by the past, present and future.





Travel as earthly and spiritual nourishment





Takada, born in February 1939 in the Japanese city of Himeji, dreamed of far-off lands and the West. With a diploma from the Bunka Fashion College in his pocket, he crossed the oceans to Paris, his favourite city. “A lengthy sea journey took him from Tokyo to Hong Kong, Cairo, Djibouti and Marseilles,” said Dudemaine. They were stages in what was an initiatory journey, during which Takada assimilated many of the local techniques he discovered.

On a neighbouring mannequin, an imposing blue coat with floral print, a tribute to the Cossacks’ traditional garb. “The velvet lining inspired by Slavic carpets is visible, and lends a dramatic effect to the garment,” said Dudemaine.

Throughout his career, Takada was dismissive of the conventions of haute couture, but one of his masterpieces, a patchwork ruffled wedding dress in pink and gold tones, was undoubtedly closely related to it.



“He fashioned this dress by sewing strips of fabric by hand directly on to the mannequin; almost by accident, he used garment-making techniques borrowed from haute couture,” said Martinez grinning. “At once very fragile and very heavy,” the exhibition’s showpiece is nevertheless in excellent condition because “it was preserved flat, with an anatomical shape inside it, so that it would not deform,” she added.



Although Kenzo is a relatively young label, with 122 monobrand stores worldwide, it takes the archiving of past collections very seriously, rigorously controlling humidity and light levels in the storage rooms. Martinez and her three-person team regularly “hunt for old items on second-hand sites and in vintage shops, to rebuild the label’s heritage,” she said. “Since Kenzo is present in many sectors, with perfumes, bed linen and ready-to-wear clothes, there truly exists a living imagery of the brand,” she added.



Indeed, the exuberance and colourful imagination of the label’s founder Kenzo Takada can be palpably felt throughout this temporary exhibition.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999973773956299}",neutral,0.9999973773956299,0

The division brought in €27.8bn (£24.4bn) in revenues for the first nine months of 2022 - 49.2% of LVMH's total revenue of €56.5bn (£49.7bn). In comparison to the same nine-month period in 2021, this had increased by 30% year-on-year.

The accusation comes after the rapper, who legally changed his name to Ye, declared Arnault his new rival and biggest competitor during a fashion show. According to WWD, the “Jesus Walks” artist addressed the CEO during his surprise YZY show on Monday (Oct. 3) during Paris Fashion Week.

“Bernard Arnault is my new Drake,” Ye exclaimed. “After my first collection, Yeezy One, got more views than Chanel, I had a meeting with Bernard Arnault and he offered me a deal for the Kanye West line, and three months after that, he pulled on the deal. So my second collection didn’t have a producer.”

The company's policy of price increases across all regions offset the effects of the logistical disruptions in the United States and the impact of health restrictions in China.

LVMH’s Champagne Maisons enjoyed excellent momentum, which increased pressure on supplies, the company noted.

Elsewhere, Hennessy cognac's growth was driven by consistent strategy of value creation.

In this period, Moët Hennessy strengthened its global portfolio of wines with the acquisition of the Joseph Phelps vineyard, one of the most renowned wine properties in Napa Valley, California.

Overall Performance And Outlook

The luxury group reported 28% year-on-year increase in revenue to €56.5 billion in the first nine months of 2022.

The fashion and leather goods business recorded revenue growth of 31%, while the perfumes and cosmetics unit saw 19% growth.

In the third quarter, the company registered organic revenue growth of 19%, which it says was in line with the trends observed in the first half of the year.

LVMH is confident that its current growth momentum will continue amid an uncertain geopolitical and economic backdrop. It will continue its policy of cost control and selective investment.

The group will focus on continuously strengthening the desirability of its brands by relying on the authenticity and quality of its products and its distribution network, it said.

French luxury conglomerate LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton is partnering with Chinese developer and manager Hang Lung Properties on a three-year climate and sustainability pact in retail real estate in Hong Kong and mainland China.

The collaboration will initially cover 26 LVMH brands occupying more than 90 retail spaces in total rentable area of 27,000 square meters across Hang Lung’s portfolio of shopping centers and commercial properties in seven cities in mainland China.

""The design of our stores, like that of our products, is inspired by LVMH's core values of creativity, innovation and excellence,” said Antoine Arnault, who runs LVMH Image and Environment, in a statement from Paris. “This, of course, means guaranteeing the environmental performance of our over 5,550 stores around the world.

“We are, thus, delighted with the unprecedented scope of this agreement with Hang Lung Properties,” he said. “Our collaboration will allow us to expand our environmental commitments, especially with regards to climate.""

The initiative offers a new take on the relationship between property owners and retail brands on consumer-sensitive issues such as sustainability, especially in a non-Western market.

Green back

China is the biggest revenue generator for LVMH among all global markets, as it is with its competitors Kering, Hermès, Chanel and Richemont. LVMH brands such as Louis Vuitton, Dior, Bulgari and Tiffany have a major retail footprint in malls across China.

Based in Hong Kong, Hang Lung Properties develops and manages retail, commercial, residential and hotel real estate in its hometown as well as the nine mainland cities of Shanghai, Shenyang, Jinan, Wuxi, Tianjin, Dalian, Kunming, Wuhan and Hangzhou.

The Chinese company positions its luxury retail real estate under the ""66"" brand.

LVMH, whose 56 brands make it the largest luxury conglomerate worldwide, will work with Hang Lung in five key areas: climate resilience, resource management, events, progress reviews and wellbeing, sustainable transactions and sustainability communication.

Both organizations will work with employees and suppliers on this sustainability effort.

The first major event under the partnership is a Real Estate & Climate Forum Nov. 24-25. The forum’s agenda and speakers will focus on idea generation for action in 12 areas, including energy efficiency, circularity and social impact.

THE PARTNERSHIP will be renewable after it expires at the end of 2025.

“Although Hang Lung already has ambitious ESG goals and targets, the partnership with LVMH takes our sustainability agenda to the next level, demonstrating how landlords and tenants can work creatively together for the greater good,” said Adriel Chan, Hang Lung Properties vice chair and chair of the sustainability steering committee, in a statement.

“We are confident that the partnership will make a positive impact in support of China's goals to peak its carbon emissions by 2030 and to reach carbon neutrality by 2060,” he said.

“I have always held that one of the great things about sustainability is that it is a positive-sum game. To this point, Hang Lung and LVMH have made explicit in our agreement that we encourage one another to work with other tenants and other landlords to further the sustainability agenda, and so we welcome the proliferation of these types of agreements going forward.""","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999886751174927}",neutral,0.9999886751174927,0

Since 1989, Bernard Arnault has served as the company's CEO and now fashion lovers want to know more about him.

Who is Bernard Arnault?

Bernard Arnault is a business magnate, investor, and art collector who was born on March 5, 1949, in Roubaix, France.

Over the years, he has worked for several companies but is arguably best known for his work with LVMH.

He co-founded LVMH in 1987 after Moët Hennessy and Louis Vuitton merged.

Along with being the acting CEO, Arnault is also the majority shareholder and chairman.

Does Bernard Arnault have children?

When Arnault is not in the office, he can often be found at home spending time with his wife, Hélène Mercier, who he married in 1991.

The pair share three children together: Alexandre, Frédéric, and Jean.

Arnault also has two children - Delphine and Antoine - from his previous marriage to Anne Dewavrin.

All of Arnault's children work in corners of the LVMH empire.

Frédéric, Delphine, Antoine, and Alexandre have been working with their father for some time, while Jean, the youngest of them all, joined the business back in 2021.

On Wednesday, January 11, 2023, it was announced that Arnault had appointed his daughter, Delphine, as the new head of Christian Dior.

Starting in February, the 47-year-old will serve as chair and CEO of the French label.

""Under her leadership, the desirability of Louis Vuitton products advanced significantly, enabling the brand to regularly set new sales records,"" Arnault is quoted as saying, according to CNN.

""Her keen insights and incomparable experience will be decisive assets in driving the ongoing development of Christian Dior.""

What is Bernard Arnault's net worth?

Over the years, the Arnault family's net worth has continued to soar due to the success of LVMH.

As of January 12, 2023, their worth is estimated to be $204.8billion, according to Forbes.

""In January 2021, LVMH acquired American jeweler Tiffany & Co for $15.8 billion, believed to be the biggest luxury brand acquisition ever,"" as per the outlet.

However, the majority of Arnault's worth comes from his stake in LVMH.

The company had a revenue of over $60billion dollars within the first nine months of 2022, which is up 28% compared to the same period in 2021, according to a LVMH statement.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999949932098389}",neutral,0.9999949932098389,0

The sector has sailed above stock market turbulence, lockdowns in China and soaring inflation in recent months, buoyed by its wealthy customer base even as retailers of cheaper clothing and accessories warn of weakening demand.

After cheering a solid quarter, investors will be looking for any signs that appetite for leading fashion labels could also ease from the post-lockdown frenzy that has seen business boom in recent months.

“Resilience will be tested starting in Q4 this year,” said Aurelie Husson-Dumoutier of HSBC.

Slowing economic growth and drops in consumer confidence and US credit card spending paint a “cautious” picture of the consumer in the run-up to the festive season, Thomas Chauvet of Citi warned.

Company strategies for increasing prices, which will likely have helped boost sales and are aimed at protecting margins, will also be scrutinised.

Luxury labels including the industry’s largest, LVMH’s Louis Vuitton, have historically raised prices at around 2.5 times the rate of inflation, according to UBS, which forecasts further price hikes in at least the mid-single digits next year, citing a global inflation forecast of around 4 percent.

Without citing a corresponding inflation figure, UBS estimates prices for the sector increased by 4.6 percent on average this year, through July.

Business in China is expected to have bounced back considerably from the second quarter as COVID lockdown disruption eased, but uncertainty remains.

“China is where companies see high volatility, which makes it difficult to extrapolate trends month-on-month,” noted Luca Solca of Bernstein.

UBS’ Zuzanna Pusz, who ranks among the top 8 analysts covering LVMH in terms of estimate accuracy according to Refinitiv data, forecasts the group will post organic sales growth for the quarter of 21 percent, with a boost from foreign exchange rates. A Visible Alpha consensus cited by the bank points to 13 percent organic sales growth.

Pusz expects 13 percent organic sales growth for Kering and 15 percent growth at constant rates from Hermes, over the period.

Marc DEVILLE/Gamma-Rapho via Getty Images

Bernard Arnault said LVMH sold its private jet after Twitter accounts started tracking it.

The billionaire said he'd started renting private aircraft for his trips instead.

Arnault is one of several billionaires to express concern over jet tracking on social media.

Bernard Arnault, the CEO of LVMH, said on Monday that the luxury-goods company sold its private jet following people's attempts to track the aircraft on social media.

The 73-year-old billionaire said he'd started renting private planes instead. He made the announcement an interview with Radio Classique, which was first reported by Bloomberg. The radio station is owned by LVMH.

""Indeed, with all these stories, the group had a plane and we sold it,"" Arnault said, according to a Bloomberg translation. ""The result now is that no one can see where I go because I rent planes when I use private planes.""

Multiple Twitter accounts that track and share publicly available flight data have sprung up over the past year — publicizing the travel activity of people such as Elon Musk and Taylor Swift. Two of the top accounts that track the Louis Vuitton cofounder's flights are @i_fly_Bernard and @laviondebernard. The accounts have a combined following of nearly 100,000 and were both created over the past six months.

Arnault appears to have made the switch to renting jets several weeks ago. In September, @laviondebernard tweeted about the billionaire's lack of recent flight data after noting several weeks earlier that LVMH had de-registered its plane in France.

""Still no word from either Bernard Arnault or LVMH on the subject of private jets,"" the account tweeted on September 10, according to a Bloomberg translation of the tweet. ""So Bernard, are you hiding?""

Arnault is the second-wealthiest man — surpassing even the Amazon founder Jeff Bezos — with an estimated net worth of $133 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index's estimate. He is the CEO, cofounder, and chair of LVMH and has amassed a luxury-goods empire that includes major names like Tiffany & Co., TAG Heur, and Dom Pérignon.

Story continues

On Monday, Arnault's son Antoine Arnault defended the company's use of a private jet after his father faced criticism from French media outlets over the jet's influence on carbon emissions. The younger Arnault said a private plane gave executives an edge in the race to be first to a new product or deal.

""Our industry is hypercompetitive,"" the son said on a TV show, according to an Insider translation. ""We haven't found anything better than a private plane to win that race every day and be just a small step ahead of our competitors.""

Bernard Arnault is not the only billionaire to come under scrutiny in recent months for private-jet usage. In July, critics slammed Swift after she and her jet topped a list of those causing major carbon emissions. At the time, spokespeople for the music star said the ""jet is regularly loaned out to other individuals.""

Other public figures have expressed safety concerns over the sharing of flight data on social media. Earlier this year, Musk offered $5,000 to the person behind a Twitter account that tracked his travel, asking the Twitter user to shut it down. He failed to get the account shut down.

""I don't love the idea of being shot by a nutcase,"" Musk said in a text about the issue, Protocol reported.

Meanwhile, the Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg switched his aircraft after an account started tracking his plane, and the billionaire investor Mark Cuban brokered a deal with a man who tracked and shared his flight data by offering him business advice in exchange for deleting the account.

The billionaire said he'd started renting private aircraft for his trips instead.

Bernard Arnault, the CEO of LVMH, said on Monday that the luxury-goods company sold its private jet following people's attempts to track the aircraft on social media.

The 73-year-old billionaire said he'd started renting private planes instead. He made the announcement an interview with Radio Classique, which was first reported by Bloomberg. The radio station is owned by LVMH.

""Indeed, with all these stories, the group had a plane and we sold it,"" Arnault said, according to a Bloomberg translation. ""The result now is that no one can see where I go because I rent planes when I use private planes.""

Multiple Twitter accounts that track and share publicly available flight data have sprung up over the past year — publicizing the travel activity of people such as Elon Musk and Taylor Swift. Two of the top accounts that track the Louis Vuitton cofounder's flights are @i_fly_Bernard and @laviondebernard. The accounts have a combined following of nearly 100,000 and were both created over the past six months.

Arnault appears to have made the switch to renting jets several weeks ago. In September, @laviondebernard tweeted about the billionaire's lack of recent flight data after noting several weeks earlier that LVMH had de-registered its plane in France.

""Still no word from either Bernard Arnault or LVMH on the subject of private jets,"" the account tweeted on September 10, according to a Bloomberg translation of the tweet. ""So Bernard, are you hiding?""

Arnault is the second-wealthiest man — surpassing even the Amazon founder Jeff Bezos — with an estimated net worth of $133 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index's estimate. He is the CEO, cofounder, and chair of LVMH and has amassed a luxury-goods empire that includes major names like Tiffany & Co., TAG Heur, and Dom Pérignon.

On Monday, Arnault's son Antoine Arnault defended the company's use of a private jet after his father faced criticism from French media outlets over the jet's influence on carbon emissions. The younger Arnault said a private plane gave executives an edge in the race to be first to a new product or deal.

""Our industry is hypercompetitive,"" the son said on a TV show, according to an Insider translation. ""We haven't found anything better than a private plane to win that race every day and be just a small step ahead of our competitors.""

Bernard Arnault is not the only billionaire to come under scrutiny in recent months for private-jet usage. In July, critics slammed Swift after she and her jet topped a list of those causing major carbon emissions. At the time, spokespeople for the music star said the ""jet is regularly loaned out to other individuals.""

Other public figures have expressed safety concerns over the sharing of flight data on social media. Earlier this year, Musk offered $5,000 to the person behind a Twitter account that tracked his travel, asking the Twitter user to shut it down. He failed to get the account shut down.

""I don't love the idea of being shot by a nutcase,"" Musk said in a text about the issue, Protocol reported.

Meanwhile, the Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg switched his aircraft after an account started tracking his plane, and the billionaire investor Mark Cuban brokered a deal with a man who tracked and shared his flight data by offering him business advice in exchange for deleting the account.

In a results statement released yesterday (11 October), the luxury goods giant’s Selective Retailing division, which includes Starboard Cruise Services among five houses, grew its reported revenue by 30% to €10,095 million/$10,004 million for the period in question.

The result adds €2,300m to the business division’s balance sheet versus the result in the first nine months of 2021.

Sephora notched a strong performance, as in-store activities rebounded with momentum notably strong in North America, France and the Middle East.

Meanwhile, its omni-channel strategy absorbed further investment as it seeks to elevate brick-and mortar and online shopping experiences for its customers.

Group revenue for Bernard Arnault’s firm LVMH jumped 28% (+20% organic) year-on-year in the nine months of 2022 to total €56,485 million.

Europe, the US and Japan, experienced solid demand from local customers and benefitted from the continued recovery in international travel.

Though growth in Asia in the latest quarter accelerated due to the partial easing of health restrictions, the region (excluding China) returned a lower level of growth over the nine-month period.

LVMH revenues reached €36,729m in half-year 2022, yet the result in Q3 surpassed the respected results achieved in Q1 (€18bn) and Q2 (€18.7bn).

Hotel Review: Cheval Blanc Paris

STAY

Occupying the 1930s Pont Neuf side of the legendary Samaritaine department store (beloved by all Parisians), LVMH-owned Cheval Blanc Paris has rattled the city’s luxury hotel scene. The bass note is casual contemporary-chic – trainers pace through the rather austere, art-clad entrance, though they are most likely Celine or Fendi. The striking Samaritaine deco exterior remains, while inside Eduard François has worked his architectural magic, carving out vast, airy rooms and indulging his inside-out hallmark to thrilling effect. Suites’ winter gardens tip over several city landmarks and the Seine’s daily bustle below, while inside Peter Marino enlisted an army of artisans to layer exquisite fabrics into a deceptively minimalist and calming picture, with lashings of contemporary art. The lavish use of rich materials in restrained hues throughout echoes the futuristic family homes of the modern elite, where avant-garde coffee tables, pricey art and multitudes of marble are softened by multi-generational antics.

Splashes of primary colours add a playful, artistic edge (not the bohemian type) and nowhere more so than in the lively Le Tout Paris restaurant, where tiles, coasters and leather chairs recall a Calder mobile. Cheval Blanc Paris’ glory lies several floors down in the spa: Europe’s longest hotel pool with digital art rendering the wall invisible with an animated would-be view of the Seine. From the leather-bound flasks filled with ginger and mint infusions before bed to the special fridge for Evian face sprays, the attention to detail is staggering, and seriously raises the bar for future hotel stays.

This is the French-owned conglomerate’s wildly luxurious and successful hospitality project coming home to roost, where many of its Saint Barths, Saint Tropez or Courchevel clients live and socialise. As such Peter Marino commissioned several French artists and sewed local reference points throughout the design project: Thierry Drefus’s digital art installation animates the lift and Vik Muniz’s commissioned painting of the Eiffel Tower hangs in the lobby. Courtesy of its previous life as a department store, Le Jardin is a rooftop Eden of geraniums and hydrangeas for pretty Parisian sunsets. If you’re looking for Sun-King splendour, head to the palace hotels surrounding the Arc De Triomphe, or accept that a modern Marie Antoinette would probably drop her bags here instead.

EAT

Having sprinkled Cheval Blanc St Tropez’ La Vague d’Or in Michelin stardust, Arnaud Donkele now oversees three of the city hotel’s six restaurants. This includes a proud and polished Milanese seafood joint, Langosteria, convivial hot-spot, Le Tout Paris and three Michelin-starred Plènitude – a high-octane brothy, saucy show with a contemporary, crinkle-wooded take on a wine cellar, and a secret cheese room.

Serving breakfast, lunch and supper, Le Tout Paris is the beating heart of the hotel with splashes of Calder-like primary colours and sweeping Parisian views, from Notre Dame to the Tour Eiffel. Well-dressed locals and hotel guests mingle for haute riffs on French brasserie classics, such as steak frite (done three ways) and pocket-sized potato dauphinoise. The comte-stuffed Madeline garnished with a hazelnut tree flower sets the pitch of this ‘brasserie’, as does the lavishly marbled bar lined with glasses of Ruinart.

Just off the lobby, Limbar shows off Maxim Frederic’s pastry game during the colder months with afternoon tea, whereas Le Jardin is a summertime affair – a vast, green space with a birds-eye view over the very best of Paris. Menus take their cue from tomatoes and strawberries, which are whipped into elaborate plates of tomato carpaccio or french toast and Iberico ham on a bed of gazpacho. Cocktails also embrace the summer theme (go for the Verbena olive oil pisco sour).

DO

Throw on a robe and deep cushioned slippers embroidered in golden thread and head down to the Dior spa for the gold-standard of potions and treatments. Thimble-sized glasses of superfood juices greet guests on the Dior cushion-studded sofas before they float behind a therapist up a buttermilk corridor. The signature microdermabrasion uses a high-tech (quick results) tool which gently vibrates over layers of dead skin. Or choose one of the three scents from fragrant silk coils in glass jars, which are skillfully worked into weary muscles and tense shoulders. Room themes delve into Dior’s heritage, such as the Granville, named after Christian Dior’s childhood hometown. A marble steam room and spacious sauna can cocoon spa guests for hours.

Having riffled through bathroom beauty drawers and lathered on every delicious hair mask and body scrub designed by Dior perfumer François Demachy, guests can make the most of the neighbourhood (a boon for those less enamoured by Paris’ Arc-de-Triomphe crowds). Cheval Blanc Paris sits between the trendy Marais, the Louvre (an art-lover’s labyrinth) and Isle de La Cité, where the iconic and slowly recovering Notre Dame sits amid a cluster of restaurants and independent boutiques. Head to Musée des Artes Décoratifs for high-octane exhibitions of fashion designers’ life and works, such as Elsa Schiaparelli or cross the river into Saint Germain’s ancient streets, thrumming with design shops and low-key brasseries. Serious shoppers are granted private access to La Samaritaine’s haul of designer garbs from the hotel, through a Narnia-like door.

FAMILY FRIENDLY

Despite an austere design mission, Cheval Blanc is surprisingly family-friendly. Few Parisian palace hotels have mastered the kids club, or even entertained the notion, but Cheval Blanc’s nirvana of fancy dress, pet salamanders and toys galore is a hit with families. What’s more, elsewhere in the hotel, brightly-coloured pool floats line up next to flawlessly white sun loungers, nappies and a changing mat sit alongside marble loos with heavy, mirrored doors and smoky-scented hand creams. The message is clear: parents shouldn’t forgo the exquisite Cheval Blanc experience (and the hotel is wise to observe a cultural shift with well-to-do families increasingly travelling with sprogs in tow).

THE FINAL WORD

As a group, Cheval Blanc has mastered softening extraordinary and wildly elaborate scenes with a smart-casual code. Its aloof, gallery-like interiors and angular furniture thaw with this tangible mood, which renders everything, from the golden-topped beauty balms to the intricately layered pain au chocolat, even more phenomenal.

"The big interview: Laurent Boillot, Hennessy CEO - The Spirits Business","Tue, 11 Oct 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXNwaXJpdHNidXNpbmVzcy5jb20vMjAyMi8xMC90aGUtYmlnLWludGVydmlldy1sYXVyZW50LWJvaWxsb3QtaGVubmVzc3ktY2VvL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Feature

By Melita Kiely

Having spent two years in lockdowns in Cognac, Hennessy CEO Laurent Boillot has immersed himself in the brand. Now, thanks to tie-ups with Harrods and the NBA, he is taking the company’s message global.

*This feature was originally published in the July 2022 issue of The Spirits Business

“It’s high pressure, but it’s great pressure,” says Laurent Boillot, CEO of Hennessy Cognac, about being at the top of the category. In June, Hennessy was given the prestigious title of Cognac Brand Champion in The Brand Champions 2022 annual report. Owned by Moët Hennessy, the wine‐and‐spirits arm of LVMH, the brand sits several million cases ahead of its closest Cognac competitors.

“We have been able to put ourselves into the number‐one position of the spirits business, and it’s about staying there,” Boillot says. “If we do our job well, we can stay number one, and probably even increase the gap between us and the others. And the competition is not only Cognac, it’s all wine and spirits; the whole spirits industry.”

Boillot became Hennessy CEO in January 2020, and admittedly “knew nothing about the Cognac industry”. His previous positions saw him gain a wealth of business experience in the 12 years he worked for Unilever, before he joined LVMH in 2002. At first, he oversaw the transformation of designer brand Guerlain, working as marketing director, then chairman and CEO from 2007. As of 2014, Boillot was also executive vice‐ president of Make Up For Ever.

Invaluable period

With the pandemic taking hold just a few months into Boillot’s move to Hennessy, the CEO found himself grounded in the region for nearly two years. But ever the optimist, Boillot reflects on this time as an invaluable period that allowed him to build his knowledge of the category.

“Instead of travelling the whole world – because Hennessy is present in more than 160 countries – my home base for almost two years has been Cognac,” he explains. “I realised that something so important to us is the viticulture; we are certain we can create the best Cognac, coming from the best soils, coming from the best winegrowers.”

The pandemic caused a slight dip in sales for Hennessy in 2020, as volume sales went from more than 8 million cases in 2019 to 7.8m in 2020. However, the brand bounced back stronger than ever in 2021, and reported 9.2% volume growth to hit 8.6m cases.

“When the wind is under you, you want to take the wind,” Boillot says. “We are pushing as much as we can. We know there are many clouds coming – the health issue is still there, the logistics issue is there, inflation, which is huge, and all the signs show there will probably be a recession some day. But you don’t decide that day, you don’t know what’s going to happen, or the magnitude; so more than ever, it’s about preparing to be ready in case there is a crisis. If there is, we’ll face it like before. But for the moment, it’s full speed ahead.”

Hennessy has long taken pride in its strong marketing initiatives and partnerships. To tap into the brand’s current momentum further, the Cognac house opened a permanent retail shop in luxury London department store Harrods in early June.

“The idea was to get closer to consumers, and also to better serve them,” says Boillot about when the idea was conjured. “That brought me to pay a visit to Michael Ward [managing director at Harrods] – it should have been a physical visit but it was a Zoom visit in 2020 – and I asked Michael, why do you not have a Hennessy space in the greatest department store in the world, to try and develop the category in your store?”

Two years later, and the vision became reality as the Hennessy Boutique took its place on the lower ground floor of the store, in London’s Knightsbridge. The space is dedicated to the rarest Hennessy Cognacs, such as Hennessy Paradis.

Harrods’ clientele is the ideal customer for such a boutique, Boillot and Board believe, with consumers flocking from around the world to shop there. Harrods’ customers seek “to get the best of the best – not only products, but services”, notes Boillot. “This is precisely why we wanted to focus more on the top range of our portfolio, and particularly Paradis, one of the finest products of the maison. It’s one of the rarest because of the blend; this is made of eaux‐ de‐vie that can be a century old. We wanted to bring the rarest blends to the consumer.”

The opening of the shop coincided with a special bottling made exclusively for Harrods. The ‘one‐of‐a‐kind’ Cognac comprised some of Hennessy’s ‘rarest eaux‐ de‐vie’, presented in a limited edition Dame Jeanne that was created in collaboration with artist Nelly Saunier.

Shoppers can also make use of the Hennessy Hands personalisation service. Boldly coloured leather bottle tags can be embossed while shoppers wait at the boutique. This is offered to add an extra element of uniqueness to purchases and to the overall shopping experience.“It’s not only about the product but services, and this is precisely why we wanted to focus more on the high‐end range of our portfolio, and particularly Paradis,” says Boillot.

Hennessy’s ongoing partnership with the National Basketball Association (NBA) has also been important to aiding the brand’s growth. “It’s not your usual sponsorship story,” insists Boillot. Hennessy became the first global spirits partner of the NBA in February 2021, when it signed a multi‐year agreement to be the ‘official spirit of the NBA’. The collaboration, which built on the North American deal announced in February 2020, comprises a range of consumer activations worldwide, and localised content.

“The reason why we selected the NBA and basketball is I don’t think there is another sport that is offering something that is necessary for us,” explains Boillot. “Most sports are about what is happening on the court, on the field, the activity in the arena. Basketball has such excitement in the game, but also great excitement off court; it’s the culture of the NBA. There are a billion fans of NBA on the planet, and they are global – 200m fans are Chinese citizens, fans in America, the UK. Understand, basketball is the second‐largest sport in the UK.”

Last year, Hennessy launched a campaign starring American basketball player Russell Westbrook, called ‘Make Moves That Start Movements’. The creative push stars Westbrook alongside artist Victor Solomon, and Alex Taylor, founder of women’s basketball community group Hoop York City. The film depicts the journey of a basketball, and looked at communities that are forwarding the culture of the game.

Spots like this help Hennessy elevate its name among NBA fans, and recruit new drinkers, Boillot says. “What I sense, is when you speak about the NBA fans, it is a sport that is able to bring together so many people from different positions; under‐privileged, different types of backgrounds and ethnicities,” Boillot says.

But the relationship with the basketball league extends much further than this. Hennessy and the NBA have taken their influence into local communities worldwide as part of the ‘Hennessy in the Paint’ initiative, which combines art and sport, reviving neglected basketball courts in underprivileged areas.

“Social elements are also part of what Hennessy has always done; it’s about giving back,” Boillot says. “The programme started in 2021 and is developing fast. We are in six countries so far, and by the end of the year we will have restored 15 courts worldwide, in Canada, South Africa and more, we will go everywhere. Each time we ask a local artist to design the court with us, so it’s a way to bond with the culture, and to give the country the opportunity to express itself.”

Most recently, Hennessy enhanced the digital aspect of its Make Moves That Start Movements campaign with an immersive online space, called Hennessy House of Moves. The digital ‘house’, features three virtual floors, where users can access a performance by American rapper Gunna, and NBA‐themed Hennessy cocktails.

Hennessy NFTs

The power of digital has become ubiquitous over the past two years. Hennessy harnessed its digital prowess further this year with the launch of its first NFTs via online marketplace Blockbar. The first and last bottles of Hennessy 8 Cognac, of which 250 numbered bottles were released in 2017, were made available as NFTs, priced at 70.47 ethereum (US$226,450).

NFTs are sparking widespread debate in the spirits industry; but for Boillot, their purpose is simple: to attract new drinkers to discover Hennessy, offer traceability and proof of ownership.

“Personally, my wake‐up call [to NFTs] was more than a year ago. I said to the company, we have to look at it, we have to understand it, we have to get into it and make our own way on this one,” Boillot says. “There are elements we are not interested in, and some elements we are interested in.”

Boillot makes it crystal clear the company is not interested in launching NFTs as a cryptocurrency investment. “What we are interested in is using NFTs as an entry door to get to our consumers or to new consumers,” he explains. “Wherever our consumer is, we have to go there to connect with them, engage with them. What’s really important to us is to use the digital world to bring those people into the regular world. That’s what I’m looking at. So launching an NFT, why not? But under the condition that it’s a key to get to the consumers and to bring them to the real world, because the real world is fantastic.”

Boillot says he takes the brand’s mission ‘to preserve, to enrich and to transmit’ “very seriously”. Improving Hennessy’s sustainability is an imperative aspect of this pledge, and something Boillot and his team plan to continue working on. Parent company Moët Hennessy has set ambitious goals to cut its greenhouse gas emissions by 50% in absolute value by 2030 compared with 2019, as part of its sustainability programme, Living Soils Living Together.

Hennessy and its winegrowers have close to 80,000 hectares of vineyards altogether, Boillot says, and there is still room to grow more. “We plant at a decent pace. We encourage the winegrowers to plant more, not too much, just to grow in the long term,” he notes.

“I don’t want to look like one of those ‘greenwashers’,” he continues. “We take sustainability very seriously for a simple reason: if we don’t protect the soil that is giving the eaux‐de‐vie, if we don’t protect the forest that is giving the oak and the barrels to make the eaux‐de‐vie, there is no future for our brand. So we do it selfishly to protect ourselves, but also with a sense of altruism because as a big company we believe that it is also our duty to do our share for the planet. We have a big programme about what viticulture should be and what it should look like in years to come.”

Long-term strategies

For Boillot, regardless of short‐term pivots as challenges arise, the future success of Hennessy will largely depend on the company’s long‐term strategies.

“I’m always looking at the long‐term future, especially when it comes to eaux‐de‐vie, vineyards, the winegrowers,” Boillot insists. “We are still buying as much eaux‐de‐vie as we can; we are still building cellars in Cognac because we believe whatever the crisis, we must plan for another 10, 20, 30, 50 years. The company has been there for 260 years and we believe it will be there for centuries to come.”

I ask Boillot what his views are on the future of Cognac. “G‐r‐e‐a‐t, great,” Boillot laughs. With sales of Cognac up by 31% in 2021, reaching €3.6 billion (US$4.1bn), according to the Bureau National Interprofessionnel du Cognac, he is understandably upbeat about the category’s outlook, and there is much to look forward to in the years to come.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9990798234939575}",neutral,0.9990798234939575,0
Paris 2024 Olympics: LVMH's long-awaited sponsorship sign-on - Le Monde,"Sat, 22 Oct 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlbW9uZGUuZnIvZW4vc3BvcnRzL2FydGljbGUvMjAyMi8xMC8yMi9wYXJpcy0yMDI0LW9seW1waWNzLWx2bWgtcy1sb25nLWF3YWl0ZWQtc3BvbnNvcnNoaXAtc2lnbi1vbl82MDAxMzE2XzkuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"""If we have LVMH, we're good."" This short phrase, uttered by an expert on the Paris 2024 Games, sums up the mindset among private and public players in the Olympic and Paralympic event (July 26 to August 11, then August 28 to September 8).

To complete its sponsorship budget – €1.115 billion or about 30% of its total budget – the Organizing Committee for the Olympic and Paralympic Games (COJOP) has no choice but to find a new top-tier partner; in other words, they must be ready to pay more than €100 million. It's ""an imperative necessity,"" as the audit committee, chaired by Jacques Lambert, told the head of Paris 2024, Tony Estanguet, in late June.

The ""target"" has been identified: LVMH. Discussions with the world's number one luxury goods company, chaired by Bernard Arnault, France's richest man, are underway. But they are taking time, and both COJOP and the public authorities are waiting for a formal signature.

Signing a deal with LVMH (€64 billion in revenue, of which 93% are generated abroad, and 175,000 employees worldwide, of which 34,000 are in France) would represent a breath of fresh air for the COJOP, which must present, in a context of high inflation, an updated version of its budget (about €4 billion) at its board meeting on December 12. This would be all the more significant as the group would be making a significant contribution, whereas other so-called premium partners – such as the French retail giant Carrefour at the beginning of the summer – have offered to provide goods and services to lighten the bill.

However, the French manufacturer, which owns Moët & Chandon, would also be able to supply bottles of champagne or have Olympic medals made in the workshops of one of its jewelry brands. When contacted by Le Monde, LVMH did not wish to comment on this information. Paris 2024, which also did not have any comment, assured that it is in advanced negotiations with other lower-tier partners. But the organizer of the Games is essentially in a race against time: It has set itself the goal of closing 80% of its partnerships by the end of 2022.

Unparalleled media exposure

The balance of power is favorable to the French luxury giant, argues someone involved in the Olympic project, according to whom, ""LVMH does not need the Games."" However, joining Paris 2024 would provide the manufacturer with an unparalleled level of media exposure: In less than two years, 4 billion viewers are expected, and nearly 10 million spectators are expected in the streets of the capital, some of whom – the wealthiest – will pass through the doors of its retail outlets. As it happens, the Louis Vuitton store on the Champs-Elysées (with estimated sales of €200 million) is scheduled to undergo an expansion by 2024.

Bernard Arnault, the CEO of luxury brand LVMH—known for expensive labels like Louis Vuitton—is the world’s second-richest man according to Bloomberg’s Billionaires Index. He currently clocks in at a net worth of $133 billion, beating out Amazon founder Jeff Bezos’ paltry $130 billion. He’s also been harangued on Twitter for his consistent use of private jets. French accounts that use planes’ transponder signals and publicly accessible information have tracked Arnault’s and other rich folks’ use of private jets to reveal just how much wasteful flying time is used by the world’s wealthiest.

In September, the Twitter account laviodebernard (Bernard’s Plane) wrote that Arnault’s plane had been de-registered in France. The account wrote “The LVMH private jet has not been registered in France since September 1, 2022. Still no word from Bernard Arnault or LVMH on the subject of private jets. So Bernard, are we hiding?”

Apparently, that’s just what Arnault has been doing. On the LVMH-owned podcast released Monday, Arnault admitted that the LVMH group “had a plane, and we sold it.” He added: “The result now is that no one can see where I go because I rent planes when I use private planes.”

LVMH did not immediately respond to Gizmodo’s request for comment. The topic of taxing the country’s richest for using private jets has been seen favorably by French lawmakers and some officials like environmental minister Christophe Bechu.

Antoine Arnault, the second scion of the world’s second richest man, a LVMH board member and director of communications for Louis Vuitton, also said during the podcast that other people knowing where their company jet is could give competitors an edge. He also told French news channel 5’s à Vous last week “This plane is a work tool.” As translated by Bloomberg, the younger Arnault added that the company sold the plane over the summer.

Of course, the issue doesn’t just have to do with Arnault alone. Another one of these critical Twitter accounts I Fly Bernard recently pointed out that millionaires’ private planes coming from France have emitted 203 tons of CO2 into the atmosphere through over 48 hours of flights in September alone. On Sept. 18 the account pointed out that the French businessman and CEO of Kering François-Henri Pinault, flew from Venice to Paris, then back to Venice all in one day, cheekily writing “maybe a forgotten phone charger at the hotel?”

The world richest man, Elon Musk, also has a penchant for using his private plane quite an obscene amount. Earlier this year, the Tesla and SpaceX CEO came under fire when transponder signals showed his $70 million private Gulfstream jet flew just nine minutes from San Jose to San Francisco. That flight likely took place in May.

The billionaire reportedly proposed to buy one of the accounts tracking his jet, called @ElonJet. Musk asked Jack Sweeney, the young man who runs the bot-tracking Twitter account, to take down the account calling it a “security risk.” He even offered to buy the account for a measly $5,000, according to Twitter DMs seen by Protocol. Sweeney asked Musk to add “an extra ‘0’” to that number, but to this day, the tracking account remains.
