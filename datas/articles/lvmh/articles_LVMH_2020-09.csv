Tiffany's $16 Billion Sale Falls Apart in Face of Pandemic and Tariffs (Published 2020) - The New York Times,"Wed, 09 Sep 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjAvMDkvMDkvYnVzaW5lc3MvbHZtaC10aWZmYW55LWRlYWwtbGF3c3VpdC5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Last November, LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, the world’s largest luxury goods conglomerate, announced plans to acquire Tiffany & Company, the American jeweler founded by Charles Lewis Tiffany in 1837 and famed for its robin egg blue boxes and diamond engagement rings.

The transaction, worth more than $16 billion, was set to be the largest ever in the luxury sector. LVMH’s chief executive, Bernard Arnault, said that Tiffany would “thrive for centuries to come” as part of his portfolio of premium brands, which includes Louis Vuitton, Dior and Givenchy.

Nine months later, the agreement is in tatters. On Wednesday, LVMH said that it was pulling out of the deal, citing a highly unusual request by the French government to delay the closing as well as the damage caused to the luxury industry by the pandemic. In turn, Tiffany sued the luxury giant in an effort to force the deal through.

Tiffany is now facing several uncomfortable prospects beyond its expensive looming legal battle with LVMH: The deal may eventually be completed, potentially at a discounted price, or Tiffany could remain a stand-alone company looking for a buyer once more, in a much less certain world."
"LVMH plans to sue Tiffany over troubled deal, alleges jeweler mismanaged coronavirus crisis - CNBC","Thu, 10 Sep 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tLzIwMjAvMDkvMTAvbHZtaC1zYXlzLWl0LXBsYW5zLXRvLXN1ZS10aWZmYW55LW92ZXItdHJvdWJsZWQtbWVyZ2VyLmh0bWzSAV9odHRwczovL3d3dy5jbmJjLmNvbS9hbXAvMjAyMC8wOS8xMC9sdm1oLXNheXMtaXQtcGxhbnMtdG8tc3VlLXRpZmZhbnktb3Zlci10cm91YmxlZC1tZXJnZXIuaHRtbA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Louis Vuitton owner LVMH said Thursday it intends to file a lawsuit against Tiffany , accusing the luxury jeweler of ""dishonesty"" and mismanaging the coronavirus crisis.

The announcement comes a day after LVMH announced it would be scrapping its $16.2 billion acquisition of Tiffany, a deal that would have been the biggest ever in the luxury industry. Tiffany then sued LVMH in Delaware to enforce the agreement.

LVMH said it was ""surprised"" by Tiffany's ""totally unfounded"" lawsuit.

""LVMH will defend itself vigorously,"" the company said. ""The long preparation of this assignment demonstrates the dishonesty of Tiffany in its relations with LVMH. This action is essentially based on the accusation by Tiffany that LVMH failed to take the reasonably necessary steps to obtain the various regulatory authorities' approvals in a timely way.""

LVMH has argued it can't complete its acquisition of Tiffany after the French government requested a delay on closing the deal. It also said Tiffany didn't follow an ordinary course of business during the pandemic, for example by extending dividends to shareholders when it was losing money.

It also called Tiffany's recent financial results and 2020 outlook ""very disappointing, and significantly inferior to those of comparable brands of the LVMH Group.""

Tiffany's net sales for the quarter ended July 31 fell 29% from a year earlier. That was slightly better than when it reported a 45% drop during the quarter ended April 30, along with a $65 million loss.

A representative for Tiffany didn't immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment.

""Even prior to the pandemic, Tiffany's business trends had been volatile, but Covid-19 resulted in challenges that the company has never experienced before,"" Wells Fargo analyst Ike Boruchow said in a note to clients.

He said, however, investors appear to be keeping a ""floor"" on the stock in the near-term, betting that initiatives by Tiffany's management team to expand into new product categories and invest online will payoff, even as a standalone company. Tiffany is also still in the midst of remodeling its Fifth Avenue flagship location in New York.

And there's still the possibility that the deal from LVMH could be renegotiated at a lower price, or another conglomerate could come into the picture and submit a bid for Tiffany, Boruchow said.

Tiffany shares were up nearly 1% in premarket trading Thursday, having closed Wednesday down more than 6%. Shares are down about 14% this year, bringing its market value to $13.8 billion."
How Hermès got away from LVMH—and thrived - The Economist,"Sat, 12 Sep 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVjb25vbWlzdC5jb20vYnVzaW5lc3MvMjAyMC8wOS8xMi9ob3ctaGVybWVzLWdvdC1hd2F5LWZyb20tbHZtaC1hbmQtdGhyaXZlZNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"I N THE AUTUMN of 2010 le tout Paris of business braced for the sad, if predictable, end of an era. After 173 years and six generations, Hermès, a purveyor of handbags to bankers and neckties to their husbands, was to become part of LVMH . The champagne-to-evening-gowns mastodon, home to Louis Vuitton and Christian Dior, among many others, had disclosed a stake of 17% and rising. Bernard Arnault, LVMH ’s boss, with a knack for closing in on companies he admires, had only to pick off a few Hermès heirs ready to cash out. Bankers assumed the “wolf in cashmere” would take mere weeks to gobble up his elegant prey.

Fast forward to autumn 2020, and the various descendants of Thierry Hermès not only still control their family’s firm, they have beaten LVMH at its own game. One of their own, Axel Dumas, has reclaimed the helm from an outside manager. Mr Arnault has all but scarpered off the Hermès shareholder register and moved on to other targets, though not always successfully: on September 9th LVMH said it would not go ahead with a $17bn bid for Tiffany, an illustrious American jeweller. By just about any measure, Hermès has led the luxury pack, nearly trebling revenues between 2010 and 2019, to €6.9bn ($7.7bn). Operating margins last year hit 34%, best in the industry. Even as it has been roiled by covid-19, its market capitalisation has risen this year to €78bn, while big competitors have shrunk.

Plenty of companies, particularly those with family histories, resist the lure of takeovers by bigger rivals. Often the decision is guided by pride rather than financial sense. Hermès provides a road map of how to stay independent—and how it can pay off.

The first step was to keep the wolf at bay. Though listed since 1993, most of Hermès’s shares belonged to 60 or so descendants, split into various branches. Hermès threw up all manner of defences. Mr Arnault was publicly rebuked as a corporate raider (less polite language was used). Lawyers attacked the underhand way in which his stake was built through complex financial products that skirted disclosure rules ( LVMH was later fined €8m by the markets regulator). Ultimately, Hermès family members eager to remain in charge created a structure which pooled just over 50% of shares, committing themselves to owning their stakes come what may until 2031. By 2017 Mr Arnault had given up.

The second step is to use independence wisely. That Mr Arnault coveted Hermès is testament to its good management. But the general rule in the past decade has been that multibrand conglomerates like LVMH , Richemont (home of Cartier and Montblanc) or Kering (Gucci and Saint Laurent) hold an edge over single-brand outfits like Burberry, Prada or Hermès. The cost of building new e-commerce capabilities can be spread more widely; size gives a bargaining advantage with landlords. Creators are lured to the biggest names in a virtuous loop of desirability.

Hermès might have struggled to compete head-on. So instead—and this is the wise part—it played to its strengths. While rivals flocked to the fashionable, ostentatious and cutting-edge, it erred on the side of discretion, timelessness and tradition. Its biggest hits today, the Birkin and Kelly handbags that often sell for $10,000 or more, are refreshed versions of what it has sold for decades. It can do whimsy and eye-catching: its website currently features a functioning porcelain skateboard, a snip at €3,350. And whereas a Dior dress will last one season, an Hermès product is for life. As creative directors shuffle from one brand to the next, at Hermès the same designer has overseen menswear since 1988.

Understatement works as a strategy only because Hermès enjoys an aura of exclusivity. This gives it pricing power to sell knick-knacks for over ten times what they cost to make. Waiting lists for Birkins stretch for years. Because much of what it sells carries through the seasons, Hermès does not need discounts to get it off the shelves. That preserves both margins and the brand, a luxury group’s most valuable asset. The firm claims not to have a marketing department. It is the kind of claim a clever marketing department might dream up, but Hermès does spend only around 5% of revenues on advertising and promotions, half the share of rivals.

The stolid approach has paid off in the pandemic. Sales will probably drop this year because of store and factory closures in the spring. But Hermès looks in better shape than its competitors, says Luca Solca of Bernstein, a broker. It is less reliant than they are on Asian tourists shopping in Paris or New York. It makes most of its wares itself, so does not need to bail out third-party suppliers. Demand wobbles are less of a problem given those long waiting lists. And if well-heeled consumers are to spend in a recession, they favour timeless brands.

For success to endure, Hermès heirs may require one more thing. The company is a digital laggard. A mere 2-3% of its sales last year came from its website, half its rivals’ share. Its Instagram account—a measure of a brand’s buzziness—has just 10m followers, compared with 41m for Chanel or Gucci. It lacks younger consumers who inject brands with vitality; according to Citigroup, a bank, only a quarter of sales are to Gen-Zs or millennials (the oldest of whom are about to turn 40).

Tough as leather

Mr Dumas is alive to this. Hermès has started to branch out into cosmetics, offering aspiring shoppers a cheaper entry point than Birkins (or skateboards). It has invested in a Chinese venture, Shang Xia, that may be useful if consumers in China—big buyers of luxury goods—start coveting local baubles instead of French ones."
Tiffany and Co. sues LVMH after $16 billion deal collapses - Fortune,"Wed, 09 Sep 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQWh0dHBzOi8vZm9ydHVuZS5jb20vMjAyMC8wOS8wOS90aWZmYW55LWx2bWgtbWVyZ2VyLXRhbGtzLWxhd3N1aXQv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The luxury industry’s biggest takeover is unraveling as LVMH moved to call off a $16 billion purchase of Tiffany & Co., which countered with a lawsuit to try to keep the deal on track.

The Louis Vuitton owner cited delays related to a U.S.-France trade dispute, while the jeweler said the French giant was trying to leverage the protests against police brutality and the COVID-19 pandemic to seek a lower price.

Tiffany shares plunged as much as 11% in New York, while LVMH gave up gains to trade 0.3% lower in Paris.

The deal, struck in November 2019, ran into trouble after coronavirus-related lockdowns closed shops around the world and curbed international travel, hitting demand for luxury goods. Adding Tiffany was seen as a way for LVMH Chairman Bernard Arnault to bolster the French company’s U.S. presence by adding an iconic label known for its robin’s egg blue packaging.

Backing away from the deal would be a rare setback for Arnault, who built his empire through a string of acquisitions, amassing a conglomerate encompassing everything from Dior fashions to Dom Perignon Champagne. Tiffany offered a rare opportunity to gain a major brand in the jewelry market, which remains largely splintered among artisanal manufacturers, while other global names like Richemont’s Cartier are already owned by competitors.

Tiffany’s global net sales fell 29% in the quarter ended July 31, though that was an improvement from a 45% drop reported the previous period. The turmoil in the luxury market since the coronavirus spread had prompted speculation that LVMH would seek a lower price.

“It’s a great way out for LVMH,” said Keith Temperton, a trader at Lombard Forte Securities, in an email. “They had paid a top-of-the-market price ahead of the pandemic for Tiffany. It’s not surprising, their efforts to wriggle out of it.”

Deadline extended

The jeweler last month extended the deal deadline by three months, to Nov. 24, prompting LVMH to say it reserved the right to challenge the new closing date.

LVMH said the French government in a letter had asked the company to delay the deal beyond Jan. 6, 2021, citing a U.S. move to impose tariffs on French goods.

“It’s a governmental order—we have no other choice,” LVMH Chief Financial Officer Jean-Jacques Guiony said on a conference call Wednesday, adding that advisers told the company the government has the right to ask for a postponement.

After that comment, LVMH was forced to cut the call with Guiony short because of a technical problem. It’s scheduled to resume at 3:45 p.m. Paris time.

In July, the U.S. announced 25% tariffs on French goods including makeup, soap and handbags in a long-running battle over taxing global technology firms. The implementation of the levies was delayed for 180 days while France suspended collection of its digital services tax, which the U.S. says unfairly targets American firms.

A month before LVMH and Tiffany struck their deal last year, Arnault traveled to Texas to join President Donald Trump at a ribbon-cutting ceremony for a new Louis Vuitton factory, part of a plan by the French tycoon to hedge against trade tensions.

After reaching an agreement to buy the jeweler, Arnault described it as an “iconic, emblematic brand of America, with a great history,” and said the deal would boost its prospects in Europe and China.

Delaware suit

The government’s request to LVMH for a delay in the closing date has no basis in French law, Tiffany said.

The lawsuit, filed in Delaware, “refutes LVMH’s suggestions that it can avoid completing the acquisition by claiming Tiffany has undergone a material adverse effect or breached its obligations under the merger agreement, or that the transaction is in some way inconsistent with its patriotic duties as a French corporation,” Tiffany said.

The reason advanced by LVMH, notably the letter from the government, is “convenient,” but it’s not an “excuse you can invent,” Sanford C. Bernstein analyst Luca Solca said by phone.

The price LVMH would have to pay to walk away wouldn’t be a “very material amount,” Solca said. That’s because typically U.S. courts would look only at the negative impact for the company, not shareholders. The courts would probably assess the costs of the legal and financial advisers and any third party that advised Tiffany."
Tiffany sues LVMH for scrapping $16bn takeover - The Guardian,"Wed, 09 Sep 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy8yMDIwL3NlcC8wOS90aWZmYW55LXN1ZXMtbHZtaC1vdmVyLTE2bS10YWtlb3ZlctIBVGh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy8yMDIwL3NlcC8wOS90aWZmYW55LXN1ZXMtbHZtaC1vdmVyLTE2bS10YWtlb3Zlcg?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"A legal battle has broken out between two of the world’s biggest luxury goods groups after LVMH ditched its planned $16.2bn (£12.5bn) takeover of the New York jeweller Tiffany.

Bernard Arnault’s luxury goods empire, which owns brands such as Louis Vuitton, Dior and Moët & Chandon, said it could not go ahead with the the acquisition because it had been undermined by a “succession of events”. These include an intervention this month by the French government, which had asked for a delay to the deal until 6 January in the wake of a threat by the US government to impose import taxes on French products.

LVMH, the world’s largest luxury goods group, said Tiffany had also asked that the deal be completed by 31 December instead of 24 November as planned. It said that as the new date was later than that in the merger agreement it “will therefore not be able to complete the acquisition of Tiffany & Co”.

In return, Tiffany said it had launched a lawsuit in the US in an attempt to force LVMH to go ahead with the deal “on agreed terms” by the end of November.

It said LVMH had failed to meet its promise to secure regulatory clearance for the deal in Europe or Taiwan. It also refuted LVMH’s suggestions that Tiffany had breached its obligations under the merger agreement or undergone a “material adverse effect”, relating to the US social justice protests and the Covid-19 pandemic, which would entitle the French company to pull out of the deal or reduce the terms.

Tiffany said the lawsuit also challenged the suggestion that the “transaction is in some way inconsistent with its patriotic duties as a French corporation.”.

It said LVMH had assumed all regulatory risk and all “financial risk related to adverse industry trends or economic conditions” under the terms of the deal.

Roger N Farah, the Tiffany chairman, said: “We regret having to take this action but LVMH has left us no choice but to commence litigation to protect our company and our shareholders.

“Tiffany is confident it has complied with all of its obligations under the merger agreement and is committed to completing the transaction on the terms agreed to last year. Tiffany expects the same of LVMH.”

He said LVMH’s unilateral discussions with the French government without consulting with Tiffany were a further breach of the agreement and accused LVMH of puffing up France’s battle over potential US tariffs as an excuse to pull out of the deal. The US has threatened to impose tariffs on French goods if Emmanuel Macron pushes ahead with a proposed tax on major tech companies including Google, Amazon and Facebook.

“This supposed official French effort to retaliate against the US for proposed new tariffs has never been announced or discussed publicly; how could it possibly then be an effort to pressure the US into revoking the tariffs? Furthermore, as we are not aware of any other French company receiving such a request, it is all the more clear that LVMH has unclean hands,” he said.

When it announced the deal in November 2019 LVMH said the move would transform its watches and jewellery division, which includes Bulgari, Tag Heuer and Hublot, and boost its presence in the US. Founded in 1837 when Charles Lewis Tiffany opened the first store in downtown Manhattan, New York, the US jeweller now has more than 300 stores worldwide and employs more than 14,000 people.

Since November, luxury businesses have come under pressure from the economic impact of the Covid-19 pandemic as well as a fall in domestic and tourist spending globally as countries entered lockdown and travel was restricted.

However, Tiffany’s chief executive, Alessandro Bogliolo, a former LVMH executive, said the jeweller had already returned to profitability after one quarter of losses and expected profits for the fourth quarter of 2020 to be up on the same period last year. “The fundamental strength of Tiffany’s business is clear,” he said."

The luxury-goods giant said Wednesday the merger agreement signed last November provides for a closing deadline no later than Nov. 24, 2020. But Tiffany had requested to extend the date to Dec. 31, and the French minister of foreign affairs had directed the company to defer the deal until after Jan. 6 due to a U.S. threat of taxes on French goods.

The company said in a statement that it will not be able to complete the acquisition of Tiffany ""as it stands."" It said it needs additional time to figure out any impact from potential U.S. tariffs on French goods, and therefore can't close the deal before the end of the year.

Tiffany shares tumbled 10% in early trading Wednesday. Tiffany shares, which have a market value of $14.8 billion, have fallen nearly 9% this year.

A representative for Tiffany did not respond to a CNBC request for comment. The Wall Street Journal reported that the U.S. jewelry chain has filed a lawsuit in Delaware to enforce the agreement, saying the request from the French government has no basis in law.

The coronavirus pandemic has hit the luxury retail sector hard, sending Tiffany's same-store sales down 44% and throwing the LVMH deal into doubt. Investors worried whether the French company overpaid, and LVMH CEO Bernard Arnault was looking to lower the price of buying the U.S. jewelry chain, according to people familiar with the matter.

Amid the turmoil, LVMH and Tiffany had agreed to push back an initial deadline from Aug. 24 to Nov. 24, as talks started to sour.

Analysts had said they believed the transaction was still going to go through, but at a lower price.

With international tourism seemingly dragged to a halt, Tiffany's and other luxury retailers' businesses have been battered, as many relied on big spenders from China venturing to their flagship shops in the U.S. to splurge on handbags and diamonds. In buying Tiffany, LVMH had been looking to grow its jewelry business, which had been one of the hottest and fastest-growing categories in luxury until the pandemic hit.

At the time of Tiffany's earnings report in early June, the company was still waiting to clear key regulatory hurdles for the deal.

Some other retail-related deals have been called off because of the pandemic.

The biggest U.S. mall owner Simon Property Group has terminated its deal to buy the high-end mall owner Taubman , prompting Taubman to file a counterclaim against Simon's accusations. The private-equity firm Sycamore also backed out of its deal to take over Victoria's Secret from L Brands .

Court intrigue in Tiffany’s fight with LVMH

LVMH declared yesterday that its $16.2 billion takeover of Tiffany was effectively dead, citing a highly unusual request by the French government to delay the closing of the deal. Not surprisingly, Tiffany has sued to force completion, dismissing LVMH’s “baseless, opportunistic attempts to use the U.S. social justice protests and the Covid-19 pandemic to avoid paying the agreed price.” The fight over the deal, agreed to nine months ago, is full of drama, M. & A. machinations and political intrigue.

BREAKING — LVMH’s latest maneuver: The company plans to bolster its case by claiming that Tiffany has been mismanaged, violating the terms of the deal, in a countersuit expected within days. LVMH also plans to file for E.U. regulatory approval, which the conglomerate believes undermines Tiffany’s argument that it is slow-walking the deal process.

A key factor in the fight is a French government letter to LVMH. The foreign ministry asked the company not to close the deal until January — well after the transaction’s late November deadline — as France looks to “dissuade the American authorities” from imposing threatened tariffs on luxury French goods. LVMH sent Tiffany a translated copy of the letter, but hasn’t released the French text. (A representative of Tiffany has reviewed the original letter, according to a source.)"

Luxury goods giant LVMH is ending its takeover deal of luxury jewelry retailer Tiffany & Co., saying the French government had requested a delay to the agreement due to the threat of proposed U.S. tariffs on French goods.

The Paris-based conglomerate said that both the French government and Tiffany had requested that the closing of the deal be postponed. The French government, it said, wanted to assess the impact of the possible U.S. tariffs on French goods.

As a result, LVMH said, the $14.5 billion deal that was scheduled to close Nov. 24 will be canceled.

Tiffany replied that it’s suing to enforce the merger agreement, which was signed in November 2019. The New York company said LVMH’s argument has no basis in French law. Tiffany also said that LVMH hasn’t even attempted to seek antitrust approval from three jurisdictions.

Tiffany shares slid 9% in premarket trading.

Last year France sought to impose a tax on global tech giants including Google, Amazon and Facebook. The French tech tax is aimed at “establishing tax justice.” France wants digital companies to pay their fair share of taxes in countries where they make money instead of using tax havens, and is pushing for an international agreement on the issue.

In response to the tech tax, the U.S. threatened to slap 100% tariffs on $2.4 billion of French products.

The two sides are at a tense truce as France has said it would delay collection of the digital tax until December, parking the issue until after the next U.S. presidential election where Trump hopes to secure another four-year term.

The French government did not immediately respond to a request for comment."

Tiffany announced it would file a lawsuit against the conglomerate to try and force through the acquisition, and accused LVMH of finding an excuse not to pay the agreed price.

This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.

LVMH, which owns 75 brands including Louis Vuitton and Dior, said it had received a letter from the French government asking it to delay the deal to January 2021, in response to US threats of tariffs on French imports. Tiffany had separately requested the deadline for the deal be pushed back from November 24 to December 31, LVMH said.

""As a results of these elements ... LVMH will therefore not be able to complete the acquisition of Tiffany & Co,"" it said in a statement.

On Wednesday, Tiffany announced that it would file a lawsuit to force LVMH to complete the acquisition by November 24. It accused the French firm of deliberately delaying the deal, and said LVMH had threatened to abandon the takeover unless the price of the transaction was reduced.

""We believe that LVMH will seek to use any available means in an attempt to avoid closing the transaction on the agreed terms,"" Tiffany chairman Roger Farah said. There ""was no basis under French law"" for the French government to ask LVMH to delay the deal, he added.

In its statement, the New York-based jeweler referred to ""LVMH's baseless, opportunistic attempts to use the US social justice protests and the COVID-19 pandemic to avoid paying the agreed price for Tiffany shares.""

Deal has looked unsteady for months

LVMH first announced its acquisition of the luxury jeweler in November 2019, and said it expected the transaction to close in mid-2020. At $16.2 billion, it would have been the largest-ever takeover in the luxury goods sector.

The takeover has looked unsteady for a while. In June, LVMH's board expressed concerns about the pandemic and questioned whether Tiffany could cover all its debt covenants at the end of the transaction. That same month, LVMH's CEO Bernard Arnault mulled ideas about how the group could pressure Tiffany to lower the agreed $135-per-share takeover price.

In July, LVMH said antitrust filings related to the deal were still being processed in around six countries. It said that the pandemic and Black Lives Matter protests had caused delays.

Though competition regulators in China and the US have already cleared the acquisition, LVMH hasn't filed for approval in the EU and Taiwan, Tiffany claimed in its statement. It said LVMH deliberately stalled this process. LVMH didn't tell Tiffany about the French government letter until a week after it was received, the US jeweler claims, arguing this amounts to a breach of the transaction agreement.

Since LVMH pulled out of the takeover, Tiffany's shares have fallen by as much as 9.3%.

The luxury goods industry has suffered during the pandemic, and Tiffany is no exception. The company recorded its first quarterly loss in six years over the first quarter, though sales have since improved."

"French Foreign Minister “Flew to the Aid” of LVMH With “No Legal Basis,” Says French Lawmaker - The Fashion Law","Tue, 22 Sep 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWZhc2hpb25sYXcuY29tL2ZyZW5jaC1mb3JlaWduLW1pbmlzdGVyLWZsZXctdG8tdGhlLWFpZC1vZi1sdm1oLXdpdGgtbm8tbGVnYWwtYmFzaXMtc2F5cy1mcmVuY2gtbGF3bWFrZXIv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton may have had a hand in the letter from a French regulator that it has blamed for sinking its $16.2 billion deal to acquire Tiffany & Co. Despite the Paris-based luxury goods group previously asserting that its decision to pull out of the “iron clad” merger agreement it entered into with Tiffany & Co. in November 2019 was the result of an “unsolicited” letter blocking it from fulfilling the merger agreement, the author of that letter, French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian, told Parliament something of a different story on Tuesday.

In a hearing on Tuesday, Mr. Le Drian revealed to French Parliament that the letter he wrote to Bernard Arnault on August 31 – in which he told the LVMH chairman that he “should defer the closing of the pending Tiffany transaction until January 6, 2021” as a result of the U.S. government’s decision “to implement an additional customs duty on the import of certain French goods” in connection with the two country’s fight over France’s implementation of a digital services tax – came as a result of an inquiry from LVMH.

To be exact, Mr. Le Drian told Parliament that the letter was the result of “a request” that Louis Vuitton’s parent company “made for government advice,” a remark that the Wall Street Journal describes as calling into question earlier statements by LVMH,” which previously characterized the letter as a “total surprise.” Mr. Le Drian was questioned about the letter by lawmakers on Tuesday, including 34-year old Les Républicains party member Aurélien Pradié, who accused the French Foreign Minister of flying “to the aid of his board of directors with no legal basis, no solid argument.”

In addition to the letter, which Tiffany described as “a non-binding advisory letter” in the corporate lawsuit that it filed in Delaware Chancery Court on September 9 against LVMH for walking away from their legally-binding agreement, the French conglomerate has alleged that the management of the COVID crisis by Tiffany’s management and its Board of Directors fell short, enacting the Material Adverse Effect clause in the deal, and thereby, putting the validity of the deal at risk.

Tiffany & Co. has since pushed back against LVMH’s argument that it “did not follow an ordinary course of business, notably in distributing substantial dividends when the company was loss making and that the operation and organization of this company are not substantially intact,” and the New York-based jewelry stalwart has argued, instead, that LVMH is simply looking for a way out of the deal (or looking for a better deal), likely due to the post-COVID drop in the price of Tiffany’s shares compared to the $135 per share price LVMH agreed to pay for them in connection with the November 2019 deal."

EU antitrust regulators will decide by October 26 whether to clear LVMH's $16 billion acquisition of Tiffany & Co. — but LVMH remains confident that it can still withdraw from the takeover.

French luxury goods conglomerate LVMH, which owns 75 brands including Louis Vuitton and Dior, submitted its proposed acquisition of Tiffany for antitrust review to the EU on Friday, and a Monday filing gives October 26 as an initial deadline.

This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.

It follows Tiffany lodging a lawsuit accusing LVMH of stalling antitrust proceedings so that it wouldn't have to pay the agreed price tag. LVMH, which said it was pulling out the deal in September, has called the lawsuit ""totally unfounded.""

LVMH is seeking regulatory approval, but has ""full confidence"" that the courts will rule it can pull out of the deal. It has cited two reasons for why it no longer wants to buy Tiffany: First, a letter from the French government asking it to delay the acquisition into 2021 because of potential US tariffs against French products, and second, a request from Tiffany to extend the ""outside date"" of the merger — after which either party can walk away if the deal is not completed — to December 31.

LVMH had previously agreed to secure the regulatory clearances for the acquisition, but as of August 24 it had not filed for antitrust approval in three of the required jurisdictions, Tiffany said.

Eight of the ten required antitrust clearances have now been obtained, LVMH said Friday, leaving just Taiwan and the EU remaining. It said it expects to receive approval from Taiwan well before November 24, the deadline for the deal.

The European Commission can either clear the deal with or without concessions, or it can open a four-month long investigation.

On September 16, Tiffany said that ""LVMH is continuing its blatant ongoing efforts to avoid paying the agreed-upon price for Tiffany"" after the conglomerate asked Delaware Chancery Court to hold a trial about the deal in ""six or seven months."" Tiffany described this as LVMH's ""latest attempt"" to delay the acquisition.

The next day, LVMH responded by accusing Tiffany of ""meritless allegations and aggressive misdirection campaign tactics,"" and said that the jeweler's executive board is ""clearly seeking to avoid having to answer, notably to their shareholders, for their bad results and mismanagement."""

On the heels of Tiffany & Co. filing suit against LVMH in Delaware Chancery Court on September 9, in which it is accusing LVMH of trying to withdraw from their $16.2 billion merger, and LVMH promising to “vigorously” defend itself against Tiffany’s “totally unfounded” claims, Tiffany says that the French luxury goods conglomerate is pushing back against its efforts to handle the matter swiftly and in fact, has asked the court in a filing this week to put the case on hold for as long as seven months.

In an 8-K filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and corresponding press release both dated September 16, New York-based Tiffany & Co. responded to LVMH’s request to delay the Delaware trial for “six or seven months” and aimed to “correct inaccurate statements by LVMH regarding [the parties’] merger agreement.”

According to Tiffany’s release, LVMH’s September 16 motion to oppose its request for expedited proceedings is the latest example of the luxury goods titan “grasping at any opportunity to delay and avoid its obligations.” After “failing to make standard antitrust filings” in a timely manner and thereafter, “producing a non-binding advisory letter from a French government official that requests further delay in closing,” Tiffany & Co.’s chairman Roger Farah says that LVMH’s opposition motion is yet another example of LVMH looking to escape the “ironclad contract” that the parties entered into in November 2019, which would see LVMH acquire the stalwart jewelry company in what would be its largest deal to date.

“LVMH’s opposition to our motion to expedite is the latest attempt [by LVMH] to run out the clock to avoid fulfilling its obligations under the merger agreement,” Farah argues, asserting that “if LVMH were confident in its legal position, it would have no reason to oppose an expedited trial schedule,” noting that Tiffany is “urging the court to hold the trial on a timetable that will enable a decision before the November 24 termination date in the merger agreement.”

While the state of the market has undoubtedly changed since the parties signed-off on the deal in pre-COVID November 2019, that does not allow LVMH to undo the legally-binding agreement, per Farah. “The terms of the Merger Agreement are crystal clear,” he stated on Wednesday. “LVMH simply does not have the unilateral right to walk away from the transaction or to reduce its price just because it is now suffering from a case of buyer’s remorse.”

Speaking specifically to LVMH’s allegation that the management of the COVID crisis by Tiffany’s management and its Board of Directors fell short, enacting the Material Adverse Effect (“MAE”) clause in the deal, and thereby, putting the validity of the deal at risk, Tiffany & Co. called foul. In response to LVMH’s argument that Tiffany “did not follow an ordinary course of business, notably in distributing substantial dividends when the company was loss making and that the operation and organization of this company are not substantially intact,” the jewelry company says that “it is equally clear that no MAE has occurred.”

“Any impact from the COVID-19 pandemic and U.S. social justice protests cannot even be considered in determining whether an MAE has occurred,” per Tiffany, which states that “the term MAE is very clearly defined” in the merger agreement. As such, “LVMH’s MAE claim is entirely without merit and without support in the text of the Merger Agreement or under Delaware law.”

Tiffany & Co. Chief Executive Officer Alessandro Bogliolo bolstered this argument, stating, “LVMH’s allegations regarding mismanagement are both untrue and legally irrelevant. We have already returned to profitability and expect to remain profitable for the balance of the year, with fourth quarter profits actually exceeding those of the fourth quarter of 2019.” Bogliolo further stated that “the only standard under the Merger Agreement is whether Tiffany has breached its covenants — and we have not.”

In a statement on Thursday, LVMH attempted to set the record straight in terms of the motivation behind its opposition motion, stating, “There is no objective reason why the upcoming trial should not take place within a normal time frame,” and that “it is up to the Delaware court to determine who is in his right, and not the chairman of Tiffany through the press.”

“Given the legal and financial issues at stake, in the context of a pandemic that obviously weighs on the ability of a European group to organize its defense in the United States,” the Bernard Arnault-led giant said, “It seems to LVMH that sound justice requires a reasonable time be granted to rule on the matter.”

Expediting in COVID

In terms of Tiffany & Co.’s motion for expedited proceedings, it is hardly an out of the ordinary request. Francis G.X. Pileggi, the managing partner of the Wilmington office of Lewis Brisbois and a member of the Complex Business & Commercial Litigation Practice, says that the filing and “the grant of a motion for expedited proceedings in the Delaware Court of Chancery is common for corporate and commercial litigation,” especially when transaction deadlines are in play.

While a relatively common procedural element, attempts to expedite proceedings are, nonetheless, becoming increasingly important in the age of COVID, according to Kramer Levin’s Arthur Aufses, Alan Friedman, and Daniel Ketani, particularly in cases where there is “a last-minute case of buyer’s remorse,” which is precisely what Tiffany & Co. says is underway in the case at hand. In light a COVID-related “surge in buyers seeking to avoid their commitments,” they assert that “even if the seller has a solid claim of breach, it is critically important to [the selling party] that they be able to expedite litigation and the resolution of their claims before it becomes difficult to close on the transaction or otherwise obtain an adequate remedy.”

As for whether the court will side with Tiffany’s push for expediency, Aufses, Friedman, and Ketani say that even if a plaintiff like Tiffany “can establish a colorable claim and irreparable harm,” the court will still likely “balance that harm [to Tiffany] against the risks and challenges of an expedited schedule in light of the pandemic, particularly when the assertion of an MAE” – as LVMH is arguing here – “may involve complex fact questions.” In the past, “the Court of Chancery has focused primarily on the strength of the plaintiff’s claim and the possible irreparable harm, but in light of COVID-19 the court has expressed greater concern about both the economic cost and the feasibility and risk of expedited proceedings.”

Despite COVID-19, they say, “The Delaware Court of Chancery continues to be receptive to expedited proceedings, although, it may not be willing to order the sort of aggressive schedules that it has in the past.”

Tiffany & Co. Wins First Round in $16.2 Billion Battle with LVMH - The Fashion Law,"Mon, 21 Sep 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWZhc2hpb25sYXcuY29tL3RpZmZhbnktY28td2lucy1maXJzdC1yb3VuZC1pbi0xNi0yLWJpbGxpb24tYmF0dGxlLXdpdGgtbHZtaC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Tiffany & Co. has won the very first round in its $16.2 billion battle with LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton. After seeking to expedite trial proceedings in the lawsuit that it filed against luxury goods conglomerate LVMH earlier this month (a common move in a corporate case with a looming deadline), a Delaware Chancery Court judge has agreed to fast-track the case to an extent, setting a January 5, 2021 date for the luxury goods purveyors’ four-day trial. While the January date comes weeks after the November 24, 2020 deadline set out in the parties’ November 2019 merger agreement, Reuters notes that it still comes “before [the relevant] antitrust approvals begin to expire” next year.

In an order issued on Monday, Delaware Chancery Court Vice Chancellor Joseph Slights denied Tiffany & Co.’s initial bid for the case to be heard before the newly-extended November 24 deadline, but stated that it will expedite the matter to early next year. Vice Chancellor Slights stated that the early January 2021 trial date will give the two luxury heavyweights time to engage in “productive discussions” and potentially, reach a deal among themselves in order to “avoid the need for litigation” – and what Bloomberg’s Jef Feeley and Angelina Rascouet aptly assert could very turn into a “lengthy and expensive distraction at a time when the luxury world needs to focus on its recovery.”

The hearing on Monday comes just days after LVMH sought to squash Tiffany’s bid for an expedited trial, asserting in a filing last week that “there is no objective reason why the upcoming trial should not take place within a normal time frame,” arguing in a press release that “it is up to the Delaware court to determine who is in his right, and not the chairman of Tiffany through the press.” More than that, the Paris-based luxury goods giant asserted that “given the legal and financial issues at stake, [and] the context of a pandemic that obviously weighs on the ability of a European group to organize its defense in the United States, it seems … that sound justice requires a reasonable time be granted to rule on the matter.”

Against that background, LVMH, which has characterized Tiffany’s allegations as “totally unfounded” and even “defamatory,” argued that the case that Tiffany filed against it for seeking to back out of their previously-agreed-upon acquisition deal should be put on hold for as long as seven months.

Before appearing in court on Monday, counsel for Tiffany asserted in a separate filing with the court that an August 31 letter from the French Minister of Foreign Affairs urging LVMH to delay the deal until after January 6, 2021 – which LVMH is using as part of its basis for pulling out of the legally-binding acquisition – is not a valid “legal restraint” in accordance with the parties’ deal. As Bloomberg reported on Monday, citing Tiffany’s filing, “LVMH does not ‘contend that the Foreign Minister has any jurisdiction over the transaction,’ because they know European Union regulators handle antitrust reviews and French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian can’t stop the deal.”

Meanwhile, European Union antitrust regulators said in a filing of their own that they will determine whether to give the merger the go-ahead by October 26. The European Commission – which has not yet made issued its findings on whether the merger will negatively impact competition in the European Union – can either “clear the deal with or without concessions or it can open a four-month long investigation if it has serious concerns,” per Reuters. The Commission one of the last remaining regulators needed to sign-off on the merger.

Ultimately, if the existing Tiffany and LVMH deal breaks down completely, as is certainly a possibility, assuming they do not arrive at a more palatable price than the $16.2 billion sum ($135 per share) that LVMH agreed to before the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic (which is one of the potential outcomes), analysts expect that other luxury players, including LVMH rivals Kering and/or Richemont, may end up vying for and winning the fabled jewelry company. After all, Morningstar analyst Jelena Sokolova says, “Tiffany is a strong brand and would be an appealing acquisition target” once the pandemic-ravaged market settles.

As a result, the American jeweler has sued LVMH in attempt to force the deal through.

The unraveling of this agreement has reportedly two outcomes for the famous jewelry house: the upcoming legal battle could ultimately result in the deal being honored, though at a discounted price, or Tiffany could resume its search for a buyer.

Yesterday, LVMH released a statement of explanation, elaborating that the deal could not be completed ""as it stands,"" because the French government had asked them to delay the deal past January 6 due to the threat of tariffs on French goods imported into the United States.

After months of rumors, it was confirmed in November 2019 that luxury giant LVMH would acquire Tiffany & Co., the storied American jewelry company, for $16.2 billion dollars. The deal would have been the largest ever in the luxury sector, according to The New York Times.

To celebrate the deal, LVMH turned its homepage Tiffany blue . “We are delighted to have the opportunity to welcome Tiffany, a company with an unparalleled heritage and unique position in the global jewelry world, to the LVMH family,"" said Chairman and Chief Executive Bernard Arnault in a statement. ""We have an immense respect and admiration for Tiffany and intend to develop this jewel with the same dedication and commitment that we have applied to each and every one of our Maisons. We will be proud to have Tiffany sit alongside our iconic brands and look forward to ensuring that Tiffany continues to thrive for centuries to come.”

Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton is Europe's second most valuable company, and home to 75 brands, including fashion giants such as Dior, Givenchy, and Fendi, among others, along with wine and spirits brands like Dom Pérignon, Krug, and more—all names synonymous with affluence and tasteful opulence. Tiffany was not the company's first foray into jewelry—it owns Bulgari and Tag Heuer, among others—but this was by far its most ambitious acquisition in that sector. At the time, jewelry and watch sales made up only nine percent of LVMH's total revenue.

Should the deal go through, with Tiffany, LVMH will not only acquire a company with 151 years of history in iconic designs, but a modern behemoth, with a 5th avenue flagship that's a cultural icon (thanks to Breakfast at Tiffany's) and 300 stores world wide. Few brands have packaging synonymous with receiving a treasure, but everybody knows that special things come in a ""little blue box.""

Despite its profile—and size—Tiffany had been finding independence increasingly difficult, according to industry insiders. Its ubiquity and accessibility working against it in an era when pleasing a millennial audience is a tricky business.

LVMH Is Calling Off Its Tiffany Mega-Deal. What Now? - The Business of Fashion,"Wed, 09 Sep 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzb2ZmYXNoaW9uLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy9sdXh1cnkvbHZtaC1jYWxscy1vZmYtdGlmZmFueS1hY3F1aXNpdGlvbi_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS, France — It was meant to be the biggest deal in the history of the modern luxury industry. It isn't happening.

After months of speculation, LVMH has called off its planned mega-merger with American jeweller Tiffany & Co. The break up has not been amicable so far. Tiffany is suing the French luxury conglomerate.

The $16 billion deal has looked dicey for months. Rumours that it might not go ahead as planned emerged as early as March, as Covid-19 began to batter the luxury sector, whose sales are set to shrink by as much as 35 percent this year, according to Bain.

LVMH issued statements to diffuse speculation that it planned to buy the jeweller’s shares on the open market, a strategy that could have potentially helped it negotiate a better price for Tiffany in light of the post-pandemic decline in its stock price.

But behind the scenes, the company was allegedly dragging its feet in obtaining necessary regulatory permissions, a bid to renegotiate the terms of the deal, according to a Tiffany statement outlining the lawsuit it filed against LVMH in Delaware on Wednesday.

The lawsuit was first reported by The Financial Times, shortly before LVMH issued a statement saying it would not proceed with the acquisition. The French conglomerate cited ""recent developments"" including a request from France's Foreign Affairs Ministry to delay the deal past its closing deadline due to a US government plan to impose tariffs on a variety of French and European goods.

LVMH is attempting to compel Tiffany back to the negotiating table.

The company described the notice as an ""order,"" which would make it an unusual move on the part of the French government. The French Foreign Affairs Ministry did not immediately respond to request for comment, but Reuters reported that its notice was not binding, citing a French government source.

Several analysts expressed skepticism, noting that ‘buyer’s remorse’ might be a more realistic explanation.

“The developments today appear in our view to be LVMH playing some of the final cards in its hand,” William Blair analyst Dylan Carden wrote in a note. “Rather than exit the deal entirely, in an attempt to extend the outside date with shaky legal justification for doing so, we believe LVMH is attempting to compel Tiffany back to the negotiating table.”

On a call with reporters, LVMH's Chief Financial Officer Jean-Jacques Guiony wouldn’t specify under what authority the government order had been issued, but repeatedly stated that the company was legally bound to obey.

“The deal cannot take place — we are prohibited from completing this transaction,"" Guiony said. He added that Tiffany's allegation that the company dragged its feet on regulatory approvals is “totally unfair.” He said LVMH could walk away from the deal without incurring a breakup fee.

Tiffany is claiming it was only made aware of this latest development on Tuesday and that it is not grounds to stop the transaction.

“We believe that LVMH will seek to use any available means in an attempt to avoid closing the transaction on the agreed terms,” Tiffany Chairman Roger Farah said in a statement.

The jeweller is seeking to legally compel the French conglomerate to see the deal through, hoping for an expedited ruling on the matter in advance of November 24, the date by which the transaction was meant to close.

The high-profile unravelling is an ugly twist in a deal that had seemed set to rewire the luxury market. It scuppers LVMH's long-held ambitions to transform its hard luxury division to rival Cartier's owner, the Swiss group Richemont, and will slow plans to expand in the US market.

Neither LVMH nor Tiffany is likely to come out of this battle unscathed.

Bernard Arnault, LVMH's chairman and CEO, had long eyed Tiffany as a uniquely iconic asset — one of just a handful of jewellers with international brand recognition. But the deal had begun to look increasingly expensive this year as the pandemic hammered the luxury market and Tiffany's share price and sales fell.

“The performance of Tiffany is lacklustre in the first six months of the year, it’s loss-making: full stop,” said Guiony. “We cannot be very pleased by a loss-making company with sales falling 50 percent.”

In its statement Wednesday, Tiffany said its performance remains in line with the merger agreement and outlined optimistic prospects. The company expects earnings in the fourth quarter to beat last year’s performance.

Still, analysts believe the deal is not completely dead. Tiffany’s share price fell around 10 percent on the news, but it’s holding up around its post-deal low, suggesting investors still see a path to some kind of deal.

Among other outcomes, the Delaware court could ask LVMH to proceed with the acquisition, though it will more likely rule the company must pay Tiffany for costs incurred and damages, Bernstein analyst Luca Solca wrote in a note. Similarly, the two companies may return to the table in the new year if trade tensions diminish, pending the outcome of the US election in November, he said.

Arnault is certainly no stranger to hardball tactics. In the late 'nineties, he sued Gucci relentlessly to try to block its takeover by Francois Pinault, the founder of what is now rival luxury conglomerate Kering. But usually Arnault has fought to acquire assets — never to back out of a deal.

Rising complexity among the assets LVMH already owns might be one reason he'd welcome the chance to get out of the deal, said Pauline Brown, a consultant and business writer who was formerly chairman of LVMH Americas.

With coronavirus accelerating the shift away from physical retail, ""his business is much more distressed than people are aware,” Brown said. “This is a comment as much as anything on the convergence of challenges across his portfolio.”

Neither LVMH nor Tiffany is likely to come out of this battle unscathed.

“This is likely to be taken negatively for Tiffany, with investors potentially assuming LVMH is going to either walk away or seek a price cut,” said UBS analyst Zuzanna Pusz.“We believe this is also likely to be taken negatively for LVMH, as LVMH shareholders had welcomed the deal.”

On the other hand, it could mean LVMH is back in the market for a big acquisition, she added. Meanwhile, if LVMH walks away completely, Tiffany may find other willing buyers in the likes of Kering or Richemont, Bernstein’s Solca said.

LVMH’s Tiffany & Co. purchase might still be going ahead – here’s why - Style,"Tue, 15 Sep 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjbXAuY29tL21hZ2F6aW5lcy9zdHlsZS9sdXh1cnkvYXJ0aWNsZS8zMTAxNjQ3L2x2bWhzLXRpZmZhbnktY28tcHVyY2hhc2Utc3RpbGwtZ29pbmctYWhlYWQtbHV4dXJ5LWdyb3Vw0gF0aHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAuc2NtcC5jb20vbWFnYXppbmVzL3N0eWxlL2x1eHVyeS9hcnRpY2xlLzMxMDE2NDcvbHZtaHMtdGlmZmFueS1jby1wdXJjaGFzZS1zdGlsbC1nb2luZy1haGVhZC1sdXh1cnktZ3JvdXA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"According to The Wall Street Journal, LVMH has accused Tiffany of mismanagement during the Covid-19 crisis, citing disappointing results that are “significantly inferior to those of comparable brands of the LVMH Group during this period”.

Turning Tiffany & Co. around and setting it on a sustained and significant growth trajectory would be one of the biggest success stories in the luxury industry. The prospect of transforming the seemingly ever-underperforming, yet iconic American jeweller into a growth driver was what lured Paris-based LVMH, parent company of brands like Louis Vuitton, Dior, Rimowa and Fendi into a – potentially short-lived – love affair with New York-based brand. It seemed to be a match made in heaven , but recent events may lead to a break-up.

Additionally, the French group, controlled by billionaire Bernard Arnault , alleges that a letter from the French foreign minister obliges them to delay any commitment in order to have leverage in a potential trade war between France and the USA.

As a response, on September 9, Tiffany & Co. announced a lawsuit against LVMH to enforce the planned merger. The Financial Times indicated in an article on September 11, titled “Grandmaster Bernard Arnault looks to the Tiffany endgame”, that the moves may have been nothing more than an aggressive tactic to lower the price from that negotiated before the pandemic. The article states that Arnault used tactics from chess to secure the US$16.6 billion acquisition, including “decoys, deflections, pins and interference”.

The next months will prove whether these tactics will play out in favour of LVMH, or if trying to buy a luxury at a discount could become costly for the world’s leading luxury conglomerate. While the outcome of the very public battle is unclear, a potential marriage that starts with a public fight in court is not the most romantic and promising way to start a successful long-term relationship. It suggests that even if LVMH does proceed with the takeover, a smooth integration may be at risk.

Over the last decade, Tiffany has made a series of changes at the top, including the stepping-down of former CEO Frederic Cumenal in early 2017, leading to the appointment of Alessandro Bogliolo that autumn. Bogliolo was confronted with the critical need to focus on more affordable collections while not alienating brand image and top-end customers who expect exclusivity, personal attention and privacy.

Facing forwards will be key to achieving buoyancy in the years ahead: Brands that don’t resonate enough with millennials and Gen Z risk their future. Even worse, when the brand positioning becomes blurry, it risks reducing the brand’s emotional bond. When I discussed the issue with my luxury MBA students – all of them young millennials – at Pepperdine this spring, their preference was for other competing brands.

Tiffany needs a rigorous and consequent turnaround and the marriage with LVMH could be the perfect match. LVMH has a track record turning around luxury brands and Tiffany needs one of the biggest turnarounds in the business. For LVMH the deal would significantly strengthen its position in the North American market and in the fine jewellery business.

To bring back consistent growth, every aspect of the brand needs to be addressed. First, brand equity needs to be rebuilt entirely. It is not enough to capitalise forever on Audrey Hepburn. Millennials need storytelling that is relevant for now, translating historic values into extreme value for today’s customers. Overdependency on the past can be catastrophic, as many failed brands have learned the hard way.

Second, the brand has to bring excitement back to their customers, whether they are current, lapsed or prospective. This will only be successful if the entire experience from digital to physical is reimagined and taken to a different level. Intentions don’t count. The ultimate judge will be the customer.

Third, Tiffany needs to clean up its portfolio and refocus on the top end. Some of this has already been initiated by Bogliolo and his team.

All of this will require dedication, focus and expertise. This is why the current relationship drama and the potential break-up are so dangerous. The current situation could easily lead to a downward spiral. Breakfast at Tiffany’s? A love affair? A lasting romance? Or a brutal break-up that ends in court? Time will tell.

LVMH and Nicholas Kirkwood to Part Ways - The Business of Fashion,"Thu, 10 Sep 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzb2ZmYXNoaW9uLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy9sdXh1cnkvbHZtaC1hbmQtbmljaG9sYXMta2lya3dvb2QtdG8tcGFydC13YXlzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS, France — Nicholas Kirkwood is taking back control of his brand from LVMH, ending a 7-year partnership between the luxury conglomerate and the British footwear label.

“This decision was mutual and amicable,” LVMH told BoF in a statement. The company said it would continue to support Kirkwood over the next few months to “ensure a smooth transition,” though it didn't disclose the financial terms of the transaction. The split is expected to complete by the end of the year.

Kirkwood declined to comment.

Historically, LVMH has been known for its aggressive and expansionary dealmaking. Before now it had only ever sold two brands: Christian Lacroix in 2005, and Donna Karan International in 2016. But the news comes hot on the heels of a more major break at LVMH. On Wednesday, the French conglomerate called off its planned $16 billion takeover of Tiffany & Co. The deal, agreed last November, was set to be the biggest ever luxury acquisition.

Nicolas Kirkwood, on the other hand, only accounts for a sliver of sales within LVMH's €22.2 billion fashion division, which is driven by mega brands Louis Vuitton and Dior. But the pandemic, which has left companies big and small struggling to stay afloat, is putting pressure on the company to streamline its portfolio. Within the group's fashion and leather goods division, first-half profits fell 68 percent this year to €1.8 billion, missing analyst forecasts by over half a billion euros. Revenue was down 23 percent, hitting €10.4 billion.

“Complexity is a big issue for LVMH near-term,” said Pauline Brown, a lecturer and business writer who was formerly chairman of LVMH’s North America unit. “I think we’ll see more rationalising of the portfolio and the organisation in the months ahead.”

LVMH doesn't break out sales for individual brands, however, according to UK company filings, Nicholas Kirkwood has been suffering from widening losses. Turnover in 2019 was down 28 percent from the year previous at £8.14 million according to a report published to Companies’ House on August 7. That same year the company suffered an operating loss of £3.3 million an increase on losses of £2.46 million in 2018. (The brand is yet to report financials for the coronavirus period.)

“When times are tough, you may be tempted to clean up your act. Kirkwood was not going places as a brand and was likely generating (small) losses, even before the Covid-19 pandemic, hence, a good candidate for rationalisation,” said Bernstein analyst Luca Solca. “LVMH has a long tail of underperforming brands in the fashion and luxury goods division. The tail is now apparently one little bit shorter.”

The sale suggests the interest in smaller, founder-led brands is waning. Over the past few years, LVMH rival Kering has also been cleaning up its portfolio, unravelling partnerships with smaller brands it has struggled to scale including Christoper Kane and Stella McCartney.

Nicholas Kirkwood launched his namesake label in 2005 with co-founder Christopher Suarez, who was the brand's CEO until he left the business in 2015. The fledgeling label garnered much buzz from press and buyers drawn to Kirkwood's signature sculptural high heels, and Kirkwood became the first accessories designer to win the British Fashion Council/Vogue Designer Fashion Fund award. Eventually, the label caught the attention of LVMH, which bought an undisclosed majority stake in the company in September 2013.

Today the brand’s shoes, which retail between £400 and £1,000, are stocked at global luxury retailers including Matchesfashion and Net-a-Porter, as well as top-tier department stores like Harrods, Galeries Lafayette and Saks Fifth Avenue.

Recently, the label has worked to reduce its reliance on wholesale retailers, attempting to boost its own direct-to-consumer sales by inking a partnership with luxury marketplace Farfetch and re-launching its own e-commerce website in September 2019. The brand also has a flagship retail store, located in London’s Mayfair neighbourhood.

Nevertheless, directors expect difficulty ahead as wholesalers slash budgets, according to filings with Companies House.

Norman explained that in order for a party to successfully assert there has been a material adverse effect, it must prove there has been a decline in the target company's business that is disproportionate when compared with competitors. Additionally, it has to prove the negative impact on the target's business will be long-lasting.

""Those factors must be proven with great particularity,"" Norman said. ""When a party alleges that due to a recession or COVID or other unanticipated events, that a target company is no longer as valuable to the buyer, the target's loss of revenue, cash flows or market share, if comparable to those experienced by its competitors, may not be enough to establish a material adverse effect.""

LVMH Inc. North America Names Corey Smith VP of Diversity and Inclusion - WWD,"Tue, 01 Sep 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3dkLmNvbS9mZWF0dXJlL2x2bWgtZGl2ZXJzaXR5LWluY2x1c2lvbi12cC1ub3J0aC1hbWVyaWNhLTEyMzQ1NzE5Njcv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton is resolute in its commitment to diversity. Today, Corey Smith assumes the new position of vice president of diversity and inclusion at LVMH Inc., the group’s North American operation. Smith joins the company after a long focus on diversity at Major League Baseball, most recently as vice president of diversity and inclusion.

“LVMH has demonstrated a deep commitment to creating opportunities for people regardless of their gender, ethnicity, sexual orientation or race,” Smith said in a statement to WWD. “I look forward to working closely with the leadership team in North America to build on the foundation they have in place in order to ensure that the group continues to be an inclusive, forward-thinking and desirable place to work and that we can use the power of our brands to effect change.”

Smith reports to Gena Smith, senior vice president of human resources and head of global executive and creative recruitment. “I am delighted to welcome Corey to LVMH Inc. as we accelerate our efforts to advance diversity, inclusion and equity across our group and brands in North America and further our commitment to fighting racism and intolerance,” Gena Smith said. “Corey brings unique expertise in both workforce and supplier inclusion, and will play an integral role in supporting our brands to ensure we meet the highest standards in promoting equality, for every person we work with and serve in North America.”

LVMH initiated its diversity efforts more than 10 years ago, the overall strategy spearheaded by Chantal Gaemperle, executive vice president of human resources and synergies and a member of the executive committee. The company’s earliest strides came in the areas of gender and sexual orientation. Not surprisingly, the global outcries for racial equality and social justice in reaction to the police killings of George Floyd and other Black victims in the U.S. have intensified the group’s urgency to focus more acutely on racial equality and opportunity. Internally, these efforts include strengthening recruitment, ongoing career development and advancement procedures for people of color and other diverse groups, and fostering a culture in which diverse opinions and personalities can thrive, areas of particular focus for Smith in his new role. Externally, a goal is to increase and strengthen relationships with Black-owned suppliers and other related businesses.

“Racism can’t be solved through a company’s words, good intentions and money alone,” Gaemperle told WWD in June. “It can only be eradicated by actions and a long-term determination, and must be tackled at an individual and structural level.”

Gaemperle stressed, too, that fostering diversity and inclusion is essential, good business. “[It’s] not just a human imperative, [but] a business enabler, because we know that inclusive companies have more engaged employees and are better positioned for success,” she said. “At LVMH, the diversity and uniqueness of our peoples’ experience is the foundation for the creativity and innovation on which our success is built.”

At the time, LVMH offered a glimpse into the racial demographics of its North American business. Such a breakdown is not available for all of its regions of operation, since many countries, including LVMH’s home base of France, prohibit businesses from accumulating race-based employment data. In the U.S., Black employees comprise 12 percent of LVMH’s employee base, and “nonwhite employees,” 64 percent. Among management positions, 26.2 percent are held by nonwhite workers — a percentage the company is determined to increase.

LVMH’s recent employment initiatives include rolling out unconscious bias training around the world; conducting diversity certificate training for North American recruiters; intensifying on-campus recruitment efforts, and establishing employee focus groups to inform D&I procedures.

The overall strategy is multitiered with global and regional aspects. Smith is the group’s first regional D&I chief named as part of that approach. Last year, Hayden Majajas joined as LVMH’s first global head of D&I. Along with worldwide oversight, Majajas, who is based in Singapore, is also strongly involved with specific efforts in the APAC region. In addition, a number of the LVMH’s maisons have D&I heads in place.

Prior to MLB, Smith held positions at NBC Universal, Altria Corporate Services and Columbia University, where he led supply-chain programs and initiatives to increase supplier diversity. Columbia is also his alma mater, from which he holds both a B.S. in mechanical engineering and an MBA."

LVMH said its board decided to no longer pursue the acquisition in light of ""recent developments,"" including the possibility of new U.S. tariffs on French goods and Tiffany & Co.'s request to push back the deal's deadline from Nov. 24 to Dec. 31.

TIFFANY AND LOUIS VUITTON OWNER EXTEND DEAL DEADLINE

""As a results of these elements, and knowledge of the first legal analysis led by the advisors and the LVMH teams, the Board decided to comply with the Merger Agreement signed in November 2019 which provides, in any event for a closing deadline no later than November 24th, 2020 and officially records that, as it stands, the Group LVMH will therefore not be able to complete the acquisition of Tiffany & Co.,"" LVMH said in a statement.

Meanwhile, Tiffany & Co. says it will take legal action to ensure the deal goes through and has filed suit in Delaware.

""The lawsuit not only makes clear that LVMH is in breach of its obligations relating to obtaining antitrust clearance, but also refutes LVMH's suggestions that it can avoid completing the acquisition by claiming Tiffany has undergone a Material Adverse Effect ('MAE') or breached its obligations under the Merger Agreement, or that the transaction is in some way inconsistent with its patriotic duties as a French corporation,"" Tiffany & Co. said in a statement.

Tiffany fires more salvos in legal dispute with LVMH - Chain Store Age,"Tue, 29 Sep 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vY2hhaW5zdG9yZWFnZS5jb20vdGlmZmFueS1maXJlcy1tb3JlLXNhbHZvcy1sZWdhbC1kaXNwdXRlLWx2bWjSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Tiffany & Co. is not letting up in its struggle to force French global luxury giant LVMH to follow through on a previously agreed $16.2 billion acquisition.

On Sept. 9, LVMH said it would likely not be able to complete the planned $16.2 billion purchase, citing in part the U.S. threat of tariffs on French goods coming into the U.S. and Tiffany’s request to push back the deal's deadline from Nov. 24 to Dec. 31. (LVMH’s original acquisition agreement called for a deadline of Nov. 24 to complete the transaction.)

The U.S. jeweler fired back with a lawsuit and said LVMH was trying to leverage the retail slowdown caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and the recent “social protests” to seek a lower price. LVMH has since publicly accused Tiffany of “meritless allegations and aggressive misdirection campaign tactics,” while a Delaware Chancery Court has fast-tracked the lawsuit trial to begin Jan. 5, 2021.

In the latest development in this ongoing luxury retail saga, Tiffany is responding to what it calls “baseless and misleading counterclaims” filed by LVMH. Specifically, Tiffany said LVMH is being duplicitous in its claims it did not solicit a letter from a French government official prohibiting the acquisition within the original deadline of the merger agreement, is making a baseless claim that the merger would create an adverse material effect, and that LVMH is wrongly accusing Tiffany of breaching its obligation to conduct its business in the ordinary course through certain dividend payments and limited store closures that resulted from the COVID-19 pandemic.

Tiffany also denied LVMH claims that it improperly drew down debt and said LVMH has interfered in the regulatory approvals process.

“LVMH’s specious arguments are yet another blatant attempt to evade its contractual obligation to pay the agreed-upon price for Tiffany,” said Tiffany chairman of the board Roger Farah. “Tiffany has acted in full compliance with the Merger Agreement, and we are confident the court will agree at trial and require specific performance by LVMH. Had LVMH actually believed the allegations made in its complaint, there would have been no need for LVMH to procure the letter from the French Foreign Minister as an excuse for its refusal to close.”"
Tiffany Shares Lose Their Sparkle as LVMH Pulls the Plug on $16.2 Billion Deal - Yahoo Finance,"Wed, 09 Sep 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy90aWZmYW55LXNoYXJlcy1sb3NlLXNwYXJrbGUtbHZtaC0xNzQ1MzAxODAuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"- By Sydnee Gatewood





Putting an end to what would have been the biggest-ever deal in the luxury industry, fashion house LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE (XPAR:MC) called off its $16.2 billion buyout of jeweler Tiffany & Co. (NYSE:TIF) on Wednesday.

Shares of the iconic New York-based jeweler sank 10% in early trading on Wednesday following the announcement, while the French company's stock declined nearly 0.2%.





The deal, which was struck in November 2019, ran into issues after coronavirus-related lockdowns shuttered stores around the world and curbed international travel, crippling demand for luxury goods and sending Tiffany's global net sales down 29% in the second quarter. This was, however, an improvement from the 45% decline recorded in the previous quarter.

After initially contemplating renegotiating the deal in June, the two companies agreed last month to extend its closing to November. Tiffany then requested to push it back even further to Dec. 31. LVMH also said the French government asked in a letter to delay it beyond Jan. 6, 2021 due to the U.S. potentially implementing tariffs on its goods.

As a result of these developments, the Louis Vuitton owner said in a press release it would not be able to complete the acquisition of Tiffany ""as it stands"" before the end of the year since it will need more time to figure out any potential impacts from the tariffs.

In response, the Wall Street Journal reported that Tiffany filed a lawsuit in Delaware to enforce the agreement, arguing that the request from the French government has no basis in law.

The Covid-19 pandemic has caused several other retail-related deals to fall through. For instance, mall owner Simon Property Group Inc. (NYSE:SPG) scrapped its deal to buy Taubman Centers Inc. (NASDAQ:TSC) in June, which led to a countersuit. Private equity firm Sycamore also backed out of buying Victoria's Secret from L Brands Inc. (NYSE:LB) in May.

Story continues

With a $13.58 billion market cap, shares of Tiffany were down 8.5% at $111.48 on Wednesday. GuruFocus estimates the stock has fallen nearly 20% year to date. Similarly, shares of LVMH were down 0.08% at 404.05 euros ($477.21) in Paris. The stock has tumbled an estimated 4% so far this year.

The New York-based jewelry company dismissed LVMH’s argument that the French government had requested the closing of the deal – which would have been the biggest of its kind in the luxury goods sector – be postponed, saying it has no basis in French law.

Tiffany also said that LVMH hadn’t even attempted to seek the required antitrust approvals.

“We believe that LVMH will seek to use any available means in an attempt to avoid closing the transaction on the agreed terms,"" said Roger Farah, chairman of Tiffany, in a statement.

Tiffany said Wednesday that it hoped a court based in the US state of Delaware would hand down a ruling before November 24, and order LVMH ""to comply with its obligations and complete the transaction on the agreed terms"".

The takeover would have been LVMH's largest-ever acquisition, enabling it to bolster its presence in the US, currently its second-largest market.

The tussle illustrates the extent to which trade squabbles and the coronavirus pandemic have affected the luxury goods sector.

A letter from Le Drian

LVMH said its board had decided not to tie the knot following ""a succession of events which undermine the acquisition of Tiffany & Co"", notably US threats to slap tariffs on French products.

The French luxury goods giant said it had learnt of a letter from French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian directing it to defer the deal in reaction to Washington's threat to levy taxes on French products.

The letter, signed by Le Drian, urged LVMH to delay the closing of the acquisition from November 24 to January 6, 2021, given the threat of additional US tariffs against French products.

LVMH's Financial Director Jean-Jacques Guiony told reporters that the group had been obliged to comply, and given it had no desire to extend negotiations, it could not complete the deal.

A French government source, however, told Reuters the letter had a ""political value"" and was meant to alert LVMH to the risks of pursuing the deal just as France wrangles with the United States over trade tariffs – but it was not binding.

""They are free to take the letter into account or not,"" the source said, adding that the French government was not a stakeholder in the firm.

According to a translated version of the letter released by Tiffany, Le Drian urged LVMH to take action at a time when the government was trying to dissuade US authorities from slapping retaliatory tariffs on sectors like luxury goods from January.

""In order to support the steps taken vis-à-vis the American government, you should defer the closing of the pending Tiffany transaction until January 6, 2021,"" the letter distributed by Tiffany read.

Iconic New York brand

LVMH – which is led by billionaire Bernard Arnault and owns brands such as Louis Vuitton, Dior and Moet & Chandon – had pursued Tiffany, one of the world's most famous jewelry houses, known for its wedding rings and diamonds.

The coronavirus crashed the party however, and Tiffany suffered as lockdowns meant tens of millions of dollars in losses from closed stores.

Arnault had described Tiffany as ""an emblematic brand, an American icon that will become a little bit French"".

Founded in 1837 and headquartered on Fifth Avenue in New York, Tiffany has long symbolised US sophistication, most memorably in the 1961 film ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"" starring Audrey Hepburn, based on the Truman Capote novella.

Tiffany, meanwhile, sought to benefit from LVMH's extensive global network and promotional power. It recorded a net loss of $65 million (€55m) during the three months from February to April 2020.

Nicholas Kirkwood Takes Back Ownership of His Brand - WWD,"Thu, 10 Sep 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3dkLmNvbS9mZWF0dXJlL25pY2hvbGFzLWtpcmt3b29kLXRha2VzLWJhY2stb3duZXJzaGlwLWxlYXZlcy1sdm1oLTEyMzQ1Nzg0MTYv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LONDON — Nicholas Kirkwood plans to take back control and ownership of his company by the end of this year, becoming independent from LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, WWD has learned.

Sources described the parting of ways as mutual and amicable, with LVMH planning to support and reshape the business in the coming months to ensure a smooth transition.

Staff at the London-based company were informed of the development today, and it is understood the designer is excited about this new chapter for his brand.

LVMH had acquired a majority stake in London-based high-end footwear business in 2013, part of a spate of acquisitions by the big luxury groups of edgy young brands.

But in recent years, Europe’s key luxury players have achieved strong double-digit growth with their biggest and most profitable brands — Gucci, Louis Vuitton and Dior being three prominent examples — as the advantages of scale and creative renewal lifted them to new heights of revenue growth and profitability.

At the same time, those big groups have learned that small brands require management attention better applied to bigger businesses. In an echo of the Kirkwood separation, Christopher Kane took back full control of his brand from Kering in 2018.

A graduate of Central Saint Martin fashion school, Kirkwood launched his eponymous brand in 2005 and won attention for his use of unconventional materials and techniques marrying traditional crafts with cutting-edge technology. He went on to win accolades from the British Fashion Awards, Footwear News and the BFC/Vogue Fund Award — and attract the attention of the world’s biggest luxury group.

Over the past seven years, with LVMH as his owner, Kirkwood opened a flagship on London’s Mount Street, undertook a handbag collaboration with LVMH-owned Bulgari and ramped up his e-commerce offer, allowing customers, in some cases, to create their own designs.

Known for his distinctive, architectural styles and embellished, sculptural heels, Kirkwood has also embraced sustainable materials and processes, and is working toward making his luxury footwear from plant-based, food industry waste.

“It’s a pipe dream, but there’s a very strong chance the technology will go there. A lot of it is there already,” Kirkwood told WWD earlier this year.

Kirkwood has long pioneered the use of environmentally friendly materials and processes for luxury footwear, and said he is hoping to ply cactus, bamboo, or apple-core waste into leathers that can match the quality and aesthetics of calfskin.

To mark Earth Day in 2019, he reimagined his Beya mule as a slingback for Net-a-porter, working with recycled denim and leather uppers that underwent a toxin-free, chrome tanning process. Insoles were created with 100 percent recycled carton cardboard, while the leather-covered block heels were made of ontano wood, which can be dried naturally rather than with chemicals.

Kirkwood plans to showcase much of the research and development that he’s been pursuing over the past few years in his spring 2021 collection, which will be 60 percent biodegradable, 20 percent chrome-free, and 20 percent using stock from his archive.

Spring 2021 will also be the first time the shoes’ uppers are made from fully biodegradable materials, such as organic silk, wool, hemp, suede and nappa leather. The shoes will have recycled soles and biodegradable linings, which he has used in past designs.

He’s using a mix of contrasting wood for the heels: The theme is mid-20th-century Brazil, and particularly the furniture and architecture of the period. Kirkwood said his use of wood fits the theme, and his ambitions in the green space.

Kirkwood believes he’s made big leaps in the last two to three years, testing everything from glues and backings to production techniques.

The designer is also concerned about the afterlife of his shoes: The brand already offers repairs at its Mount Street flagship in London, and the designer now wants to educate customers about the best way to dispose of them. “We’re looking at options where people can bring them back to us, and we safely and correctly put them in an environment where they will decompose.”

According to the brand’s latest filing on Companies House, turnover in fiscal 2019 was 8.1. million pounds, down from 11.3 million in 2018, while losses widened to 3.5 million pounds from 2.6 million pounds.

The exit from Kirkwood marks a rare disposal for LVMH chief Bernard Arnault, seen as a patient and persistent entrepreneur who takes a long-term view on luxury goods.

It caps off a busy week for the French group, which appointed Kim Jones as Karl Lagerfeld’s successor at Fendi, and revealed that it can no longer move forward with its planned $16.2 billion acquisition of Tiffany & Co. following a directive from the French government amid a brewing trade war with the U.S."

Breakup at Tiffany's: How the LVMH Deal Fell Apart - JCK,"Wed, 16 Sep 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmpja29ubGluZS5jb20vZWRpdG9yaWFsLWFydGljbGUvdGlmZmFueS1sdm1oLWRlYWwtZmVsbC1hcGFydC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"For all the debate last year about LVMH’s acquisition of Tiffany & Co., the purchase made a lot more sense following COVID-19. Like many companies, Tiffany could use strong financial backing during tough times.

However, last week, LVMH made clear it doesn’t want to be Tiffany’s safety net. It unilaterally canceled the $16.2 billion deal, following a French government request to postpone it to January, to give that country more leverage in its trade war with the United States. Since January falls outside the deal’s November closing date, LVMH declared the deal dead.

Not everyone bought this logic. For one, French government sources called the request nonbinding. For another, the cancellation “deprives France of its bargaining chip,” said Wall Street Journal reporter Matthew Dalton. In other words, by killing the deal, LVMH also killed the reason for the request.

Then, last week, Bloomberg reported that LVMH chairman and CEO Bernard Arnault first reached out to French officials, seeking help to make the deal go away. Arnault, considered Europe’s richest man, “initially sought support from the finance ministry, which rejected him, before going to the foreign ministry,” the report said.

LMVH staunchly denied the story. “Are you seriously suggesting that we procured the [government] letter?” asked chief financial officer Jean-Jacques Guiony on a conference call, as reported by WWD. “It was fully unsolicited.” The local press believes otherwise. “LVMH seems to be organizing a sort of merger with French diplomacy in its sole interest,” declared one French newspaper.

The controversy is just one of a number of headaches that has plagued LVMH since it scuttled the purchase. On Sept. 9, soon after LVMH dropped its bomb, Tiffany sued the luxury giant in the Delaware Court of Chancery, a move that reportedly made Arnault feel “insulted and angry.”

Tiffany’s 114-page complaint is full of allegations detailing how the deal came together and eventually fell apart:

– LVMH made its first unsolicited bid for Tiffany on Oct. 15, one day before Tiffany’s board meeting—propitious timing that apparently raised eyebrows. “The dates of meetings of Tiffany’s board of directors are not publicly disclosed, and are generally known only to Tiffany’s directors and the top management of Tiffany,” said the filing.

– During the negotiations, LVMH was so eager to buy Tiffany it conducted just five days of due diligence and submitted five bids in total, including three in one day.

– Then came COVID-19. Business tanked around the world. After Tiffany’s stock price fell in March, LVMH asked if it could buy shares on the open market, at a lower price than the $135 a share it agreed to in November. Tiffany responded this would have to be publicly disclosed. LVMH backed off. Tiffany executives saw this as an indication that its once-besotted suitor was getting cold feet.

– By June, COVID-19 had spread throughout the United States, and protests filled the streets—forcing Tiffany to temporarily shut its stores. All of which, LMVH suggested, left Tiffany more exposed than other retailers, as “it operates a United States-centric business,” the filing said.

– Things got worse from there. After the deal was signed, the two companies’ executives spoke regularly. By June, the informal chats had ceased, and LVMH was giving Tiffany the “corporate cold shoulder.” That same month, LVMH issued a statement saying it was taking a fresh look at the deal.

– Tiffany began to suspect that LVMH was looking for a way out. LVMH “drag[ged] its feet” when asked for responses needed for antitrust clearances, Tiffany claimed. Guiony blamed the delays on COVID-19, which, he snarked, “Tiffany must have heard of.”

Tiffany’s complaint said that LVMH has “made it clear” it still wants to buy the retailer, it’s just angling for a better price. And while many analysts agree, Guiony said it has never asked to renegotiate, and the thought “never crossed our mind.”

For now, the two parties seem headed for the courtroom, rather than the negotiating table. LVMH has threatened a countersuit, and its statement offered a fresh reason for backing out: It found Tiffany’s first-half sales “disappointing.” The retailer responded they were better than projected and par for the COVID era.

Even if it’s true that Tiffany performed badly during the pandemic, that’s a reason to clean house, not cancel the sale. This is the same brand executives repeatedly praised in November.

There are dangers here for both parties. One journalist wrote that LVMH—which has acquired more than 70 brands in four decades—might see its dealmaking rep “take a hit” if this deal collapses. Future targets might think twice when Arnault comes knocking.

Tiffany claimed it was already on guard. “Tiffany was aware of Arnault’s reputation and his ruthless approach to acquisitions,” the complaint said. “[H]is ‘playbook’ has been described as ‘ousting founders, dividing families, or driving a wedge between business partners.'”

Which raises the question: If the directors truly believed that, why would they want him to buy their company—then or now?

And yet, amazingly, Tiffany still wants the deal to happen and has asked the court to force LVMH to abide by its terms. It may get its wish. “Delaware judges have only rarely allowed a buyer to walk away from an agreed deal,” said the Financial Times.

If that can’t happen, Tiffany has requested damages. That might be a far better outcome.

For starters, it’s still not clear what LVMH had planned for its new jewel. Arnault said he wanted to make Tiffany a “little bit French,” likely meaning more exclusive.

But that’s not what Tiffany’s all about. Following “a European Louis Vuitton or Christian Dior luxury-brand model [could] be a huge mistake” for Tiffany, wrote Pam Danziger in Forbes. “It undermines the uniquely American heritage and values Tiffany stands for.”

Post-acquisition, Guiony told analysts he didn’t expect many changes in Tiffany’s strategy or direction, but LVMH would nurture it with “time and capital.”

That drew this response from a JCK reader:

I worked for an LVMH company and the story here is not what I experienced. They did not invest in the company. You were on your own to generate investment dollars. They worked like a typical equity company. You were on your own. It is a challenging environment. If you did borrow from the LVMH piggy bank there was a cost to your bottom line.

Perhaps that was not how LVMH originally planned to run Tiffany. But it could be more likely now, if the deal is forced down its throat. Tiffany shouldn’t be saddled with an unhappy owner that believes it overpaid. The brand needs to be beefed up, not bled out.

This acquisition may be a boon for Tiffany’s shareholders. But its directors, executives, and attorneys are supposed to be stewards of the 183-year-old brand. They need to consider not only Wall Street’s interests but those of its employees, as well as the brand’s long-term future. Tiffany is a rare and special company. Now that LVMH has lost its ardor, Tiffany shouldn’t be thrown to the “wolf in cashmere.”

LVMH is not the first acquisition-happy colossus whose reach may have exceeded its grasp. At least it made that determination before the sale was completed, rather than after.

France-US trade tensions disrupt billion-dollar LVMH-Tiffany buyout - RFI English,"Tue, 15 Sep 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJmaS5mci9lbi9mcmFuY2UvMjAyMDA5MTUtZnJhbmNlLXVzLXRlbnNpb25zLXNwaWxsLW92ZXItaW50by1sdXh1cnktbHZtaC10aWZmYW55LWJ1eW91dHnSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"France-US

French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire has backed the country’s Foreign Affairs minister in requesting that LVMH, the French luxury goods conglomerate, postpone its 16.6 billion dolar takeover of American jewellery company Tiffany.

Bernard Arnault, chief executive of French luxury conglomerate LVMH, with US President Donald Trump in New York in January 2017, weeks after he was elected president.

Le Maire said Foreign Affairs Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian was protecting French interests with his intervention in the LVMH-Tiffany deal.

Le Drian wrote a letter to Bernard Arnault, LVMH chief executive, on 31 August, requesting he delay plans to buy out Tiffany.

According to an extract of the letter reproduced by Marianne magazine, the letter calls for a postponement of the deal until early next year, to protect French national interests:

“In order to support the steps taken vis-à-vis the American government, you should defer the closing of the pending Tiffany transaction until 6 January 2021. I am sure you will understand the need to take part in our country’s efforts to defend its national interests.”

Last week, on 8 September, LVMH’s legal team informed Tiffany that the French government had asked it to delay its acquisition because of trade tensions between France and the administration of US President Donald Trump.

In the letter, Le Drian referred to an earlier move by Trump:

“The American government has decided to implement an additional customs duty on the import of certain French goods, in particular goods in the luxury sector, in reaction to France adopting a digital services tax. The US has deferred the application of the duty until 6 January 2021.”

LVMH told Tiffany that it considers the document from the French government to be legally binding and that it will therefore not be able to complete the acquisition of Tiffany & Co before the 16.6 billion dollar merger agreement expires on 24 November.

French officials have disputed that the letter is a binding request and said LVMH was free to do what it wanted.

LVMH, owner of Louis Vuitton, Dior and dozens of other luxury brands, also said that Tiffany paid out large dividends while it was making losses.

It added that the US jeweller was underperforming and that its market value is now much less than when the deal was signed in November 2019.

According to LVMH, Tiffany’s first-half results and its outlook for 2020 “are very disappointing, and significantly inferior to those of comparable brands of the LVMH Group during this period”.

Tiffany filed a lawsuit against LVMH on 9 September for breach of its obligations and is also suing LVMH to force it to complete the takeover as planned at 135 dollars per share or pay damages.

Tiffany CEO Roger Farah said “LVMH will seek to use any available means in an attempt to avoid closing the transaction on the agreed terms”.

He added that “there is no basis under French law for the Foreign Affairs Minister to order a company to breach a valid and binding agreement”.

LVMH said it was surprised by the lawsuit filed by Tiffany.

“It has clearly been prepared by Tiffany a long time ago and communicated in a misleading way to shareholders and is defamatory,” LVMH said, adding that the legal action “demonstrates the dishonesty of Tiffany in its relations with LVMH"".

LVMH Pulls Out of Blockbuster $16.2 Billion Deal to Buy Tiffany & Co. - Robb Report,"Wed, 09 Sep 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vcm9iYnJlcG9ydC5jb20vc3R5bGUvamV3ZWxyeS9sdm1oLXNjcmFwcy0xNi0yLWJpbGxpb24tdGlmZmFueS1kZWFsLTI5NDk2NDMv0gFXaHR0cHM6Ly9yb2JicmVwb3J0LmNvbS9zdHlsZS9qZXdlbHJ5L2x2bWgtc2NyYXBzLTE2LTItYmlsbGlvbi10aWZmYW55LWRlYWwtMjk0OTY0My9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"In news sure to send shock waves through the luxury world, LVMH has pulled out of its $16.2 billion takeover of Tiffany & Co.

On early Wednesday morning, Bernard Arnault’s luxury behemoth announced it would scrap plans to acquire the famed jewelry company, less than a year after the agreement had first been reached, reports Bloomberg. In response, Tiffany says it will sue LVMH to keep the record-breaking merger on track.

The reversal comes just weeks after the jeweler moved to delay the mega-money deal, which had yet to receive regulatory approval, from late August until the end of the year. In a statement released on Wednesday, LVMH cited the delay, along with the looming threat of US tariffs on French goods, as reasons for pulling out of the merger:

“After a succession of events which undermine the acquisition of Tiffany & Co, the Board of LVMH met to review the situation relating to the contemplated investment in light of these recent developments . . . As a result of these elements, and knowledge of the first legal analysis led by the advisors and the LVMH teams, the Board decided to comply with the Merger Agreement signed in November 2019 which provides, in any event for a closing deadline no later than November 24th, 2020 and officially records that, as it stands, the Group LVMH will therefore not be able to complete the acquisition of Tiffany & Co.”

But Tiffany doesn’t intend to let LVMH just walk away from the gargantuan deal. Shortly after news broke, The Wall Street Journal reported that the jeweler had filed a lawsuit in Delaware, where some of LVMH’s US subsidiaries are based, to enforce the agreement.

WATCH

“We regret having to take this action, but LVMH has left us no choice but to commence litigation to protect our company and our shareholders,” chairman Roger N. Farah said in a statement provided to Robb Report. “Tiffany is confident it has complied with all of its obligations under the Merger Agreement and is committed to completing the transaction on the terms agreed to last year. Tiffany expects the same of LVMH.”

The French conglomerate’s decision to withdraw from the deal didn’t come as a complete surprise. Earlier this summer, Reuters reported that some members of the LVMH board wanted Arnault to renegotiate the deal because of the financial effects of the coronavirus outbreak, with some pushing for it to be scrapped altogether. Nevertheless, LVMH decided to move forward with the agreement already in place. But last month’s delay, along with a request from the French government to postpone closure until early next year amid likely US tariffs, appears to have tipped the scale.

Although Tiffany had been struggling for years, LVMH entered into an agreement to buy the jeweler for $135 per share in late November of 2019. The $16.2 billion purchase was set to be the conglomerate’s biggest acquisition and was viewed as a key part of its long-term expansion strategy. As a result of Wednesday’s announcement, CNBC reports that Tiffany’s stock has fallen by more than 9 percent in early trading."

The ""conditions necessary to close the acquisition of Tiffany have not been met"" for several reasons, including a letter from the French minister of Europe and Foreign Affairs asking for the deal to be delayed, LVMH said in a statement Tuesday.

TIFFANY LAWSUIT FOR $16B LVMH DEAL FAST-TRACKED FOR JANUARY TRIAL

Tiffany & Co. sued LVMH earlier in September after the acquisition broke down, prompting LVMH to vow to countersue. LVMH's countersuit claims that it has an out because the coronavirus pandemic has had a ""devastating and lasting"" material adverse effect on Tiffany & Co.'s business, and the two companies' deal did not contain a pandemic carveout.

LVMH also accused Tiffany & Co. of a ""blatant breach of its obligation to operate in the ordinary course.""

""For instance, Tiffany paid the highest possible dividends while the company was burning cash and reporting losses,"" LVMH said in a statement, although Tiffany & Co. counters that it has never missed or reduced dividend payments and has more than $1.2 billion in cash.

Tiffany & Co. pushed back against other claims made by LVMH on Tuesday.

""LVMH’s specious arguments are yet another blatant attempt to evade its contractual obligation to pay the agreed-upon price for Tiffany,"" Roger Farah, the chairman of Tiffany & Co.'s board, said in a statement. ""Tiffany has acted in full compliance with the Merger Agreement, and we are confident the Court will agree at trial and require specific performance by LVMH.""

Tiffany sues LVMH as French luxury giant walks away from acquisition deal - New York Post,"Wed, 09 Sep 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vbnlwb3N0LmNvbS8yMDIwLzA5LzA5L3RpZmZhbnktc3Vlcy1sbXZoLWFzLWZyZW5jaC1sdXh1cnktZ2lhbnQtZHJvcHMtYWNxdWlzaXRpb24tZGVhbC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LVMH just left Tiffany at the altar — and the jeweler isn’t taking the rejection well.

The French luxury conglomerate behind Louis Vuitton and Christian Dior — and run by Bernard Arnault, the fourth richest man in the world — said Wednesday that it’s walking away from its $16.2 billion takeover of the storied New York jeweler. Tiffany, popular for its engagement rings, is suing to keep the deal intact.

In a statement, LVMH blamed US tariffs policies for ruining the wedding, saying the French government told it in a letter to wait until Jan. 6 of next year to close the deal in response to the US’s threat to impose tariffs on French goods. The company also noted that Tiffany had asked to complete the tie-up on Dec. 31 instead of a previous Nov. 24 deadline.

“As a results of these elements … as it stands, the Group LVMH will therefore not be able to complete the acquisition of Tiffany & Co.,” LVMH said in its statement.

The jeweler shot back by blaming the closing delay on LVMH’s failure to seek approval from antitrust authorities in countries that have jurisdiction over the merger, including the European Union and Taiwan.

Tiffany also accused LVMH of waiting until Tuesday to tell it about the French government’s letter to hold off on the deal even though the letter was dated Aug. 31. Regardless, the government’s request “does not excuse LVMH from completing the merger,” Tiffany said.

The jeweler at the center of the 1961 hit film “Brakfast at Tiffany’s” starring Audrey Hepburn, said it filed a lawsuit in Delaware Chancery Court to hold LVMH to the terms of the merger agreement the companies reached last November.

“We regret having to take this action but LVMH has left us no choice but to commence litigation to protect our company and our shareholders,” Roger N. Farah, chairman of Tiffany’s board, said in a statement.

Tiffany shares tumbled 8.5 percent in premarket trading Wednesday to $111.45 as of 7:30 a.m. LVMH’s Paris-listed shares were recently down 0.8 percent at 400.95 euros ($471.34).

The dispute throws a wrench into a blockbuster deal that was expected to restore some luster to Tiffany while expanding LVMH’s already massive portfolio of high-end brands including Louis Vuitton, Givenchy and Christian Dior.

If it falls through, the Tiffany-LVMH marriage would be the second-most-expensive deal to collapse so far in 2020, according to Bloomberg data. Some 122 other such transactions have been terminated since the start of the year. The biggest was Xerox’s failed attempt at a $35.3 billion hostile takeover of HP, which the printer maker abandoned because of the coronavirus pandemic, the data shows.

While LVMH’s Wednesday statement did not mention COVID-19, the pandemic has taken the shine off Tiffany’s sales. The 183-year-old retailer swung to a $65 million loss from February through April as the virus forced it to temporarily close many of its stores.

Tiffany returned to profitability in the quarter ending July 31, but its net earnings of $32 million were still 77 percent lower than the same period last year.

Reports emerged in June that LVMH’s Arnault had been considering ways to renegotiate the deal amid the coronavirus pandemic and mass protests in the US, which have majorly disrupted the retail landscape.

The company reportedly decided not to ask for a lower price even as LVMH publicly acknowledged that it was weighing how the COVID-19 crisis could affect Tiffany’s “results and perspectives.”"
LVMH Prize Winner Thebe Magugu Launches E-Commerce Site - WWD,"Fri, 18 Sep 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihwFodHRwczovL3d3ZC5jb20vZmFzaGlvbi1uZXdzL2Rlc2lnbmVyLWx1eHVyeS9sdm1oLXByaXplLXdpbm5lci10aGViZS1sdm1oLXByaXplLXdpbm5lci10aGViZS1tYWd1Z3UtbGF1bmNoZXMtZWNvbW1lcmNlLXNpdGUtMTIzNDU4ODg1Ny_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS — Winning the LVMH Prize for Young Designers last year should have propelled Thebe Magugu on a fast-track to expansion. Instead, the designer has found himself navigating choppy waters as the coronavirus pandemic has upended relationships between retailers and labels.

The silver lining? The drop in wholesale orders has prompted the South African brand to speed up the launch of its e-commerce site, which goes live today alongside Magugu’s fall 2020 campaign shot by Travys Owen.

Designed by London-based branding consultancy Commission Studio, which created the visual identity for Rihanna’s Fenty label, and built by digital agency Official Business, ThebeMagugu.com is inspired by the front-end look of .edu web sites, reflecting Magugu’s tradition of naming his collections after university courses.

“I wanted to make an open invitation into my universe — making it more tangible and accessible,” he said.

In the Collections menu, the spines of books bear the name of each season, and open to his research on the collections. The shop section carries women’s ready-to-wear and accessories, alongside select pre-fall items exclusive to the e-store. A men’s collection is in the pipeline.

To mark the launch, the site will carry a unisex T-shirt line called Extracurricular that is also available exclusively at Dover Street Market locations worldwide and online. The T-shirts feature doodles from Magugu’s Instagram sketchbook, with the first drop showing a stick figure sipping tea while everything around it goes up in flames.

The fall campaign stars a group of the designer’s closest friends posed in tableaux around objects from his childhood, including a steaming cauldron spewing red smoke — a reference to a cultural ceremony his family performs every few years, but also to one of his favorite plays, Arthur Miller’s “The Crucible.”

In an interview with WWD, Magugu talked about how he is adapting his brand, which is present in 19 points of sale worldwide, to the new market realities, and how he plans to show his next collection remotely during Paris Fashion Week.

WWD: Were you always planning to launch your online store this fall, or did the lockdown speed up the process?

Thebe Magugu: Lockdown certainly sped up the process. Initially, I wanted to grow wholesale and then follow that up with my own retail operation, but now that wholesale is in a state of postponed flux, I thought now was the time to act. The process, although intense, has been quite exhilarating. Commission Studio, Official Business and I created the site in a way that makes it feel like a “resource” by creating a universe for people to not only shop but also delve into the brand’s DNA and general context through publishing, photography and other special projects.

WWD: How did the lockdown affect your wholesale activities? Did you suffer any canceled orders?

T.M.: Unfortunately, like many designers, lockdown affected wholesale quite a bit, and I think a defining moment was when I was getting ready to ship to two stores in New York during my delivery window. On shipping day…I learned that the stores I was about to send to had officially closed — and DHL was already en route to collect from my studios. On the bright side, at least that stock can now live on my online store.

I must admit though that there were stores that committed to their buy and it was a considerably better situation than some of the horrors designers were faced with when buyers canceled orders mid-production and refused to meet them in the middle.

WWD: Many emerging designers have found that d-t-c has been a lifesaver during this period. How important do you expect direct sales to be to your business going forward?

T.M.: It is something that I have been asked about time and time again, especially in my local market. My accessibility had been quite limited, with only select pieces making it into select stores, and the idea of having a space where everyone can gain something — whether that’s physical clothes or stimulating content — gives me great joy. I think in these precarious times, it’s important to explore viable retail avenues and d-t-c curtails many of the risks and disadvantages of wholesale (well at least for the time being).

WWD: Are you partnering with anyone on the fulfillment portion, or is this something you are doing in-house?

T.M.: I am doing this process in-house, but I have incredible assistance from a local logistics company that has considered every aspect of our back-end, making it as automated as possible and ensuring ease-of-use for both us in-house and the customer’s shopping experience.

WWD: Do you plan to present a new collection at Paris Fashion Week? If so, what format will it take?

T.M.: South Africa has closed its borders to international travel as a precaution, but I have worked on a collection that will be presented in a digital format during Paris Fashion Week and the garments themselves will be available at Palais de Tokyo for viewing by appointment only for our seasonal buying meetings.

Tiffany Sues LVMH For Dumping $16B Deal; Analysts Say This Is Not The End - TipRanks.com - TipRanks,"Wed, 09 Sep 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRpcHJhbmtzLmNvbS9uZXdzL3RpZmZhbnktc3Vlcy1sdm1oLWZvci1kdW1waW5nLTE2Yi1kZWFsLWFuYWx5c3RzLXNheS10aGlzLWlzLW5vdC10aGUtZW5k0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Tiffany & Co has filed a lawsuit in the US against Louis Vuitton owner LVMH to enforce the $16 billion merger agreement between the two parties.

Shares dropped 6.5% to $113.96 on Wednesday. The move comes after LVMH pulled out of the deal to snap up the US jewelry chain. LVMH said the French government requested the luxury group to delay the acquisition until Jan. 6 next year because of the threat of additional US tariffs against French products. The deal was due to be completed by Nov. 24 this year.

Tiffany (TIF) seeks an order requiring LVMH to abide by its contractual obligation under the merger agreement to complete the transaction on the agreed terms. The jewelry chain said that the lawsuit filed with the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware shows that LVMH is in breach of its obligations relating to obtaining antitrust clearance, and refutes the French luxury group’s claim that it can call off the deal by arguing that Tiffany has undergone a Material Adverse Effect (MAE) or that the transaction is in some way inconsistent with its “patriotic duties as a French corporation”.

“LVMH has left us no choice but to commence litigation to protect our company and our shareholders,” said Tiffany chairman Roger N. Farah. “LVMH will seek to use any available means in an attempt to avoid closing the transaction on the agreed terms. There is no basis under French law for the Foreign Affairs Minister to order a company to breach a valid and binding agreement, and LVMH’s unilateral discussions with the French government without notifying or consulting with Tiffany and its counsel were a further breach of LVMH’s obligations under the Merger Agreement.”

Earlier on Wednesday, LVMH had said that it received a letter from the French government which due to the US threat of taxes on French products, directed the group to differ the acquisition of Tiffany until after January 6th, 2021. The group said that Tiffany asked to extend the merger agreement date to December 31st, 2020.

“As a results of these elements, the board decided to comply with the Merger Agreement signed in November 2019 which provides, in any event for a closing deadline no later than November 24th, 2020 and officially records that, as it stands, LVMH will therefore not be able to complete the acquisition of Tiffany,” LVMH concluded in the statement.

Shares in Tiffany are down about 15% so far this year, with the $135 average analyst price target implying almost 19% upside potential over the coming year.

Meanwhile, Guggenheim analyst Robert Drbul believes that this is not the last word in the saga.

“Considering the deal was initially negotiated in November 2019 (pre-pandemic), the deal could still be finalized, albeit at a lower price,” Drbul wrote in a note to investors. “We continue to believe LVMH is the optimal buyer for TIF, and TIF is a logical fit within LVMH’s portfolio of brands.”

The analyst maintains a Hold rating on the stock adding that “timing and price remain uncertainties”.

Similarly, Oppenheimer analyst Brian Nagel also noted that the latest developments are likely part of an ongoing negotiation.

“Our best estimate is that there now exists an 80-85% chance (down from 90%-plus) for a deal to occur at or above an acquisition price of $108/share (vs. a current offer of $135/share),” Nagel said.

The rest of the Street shares Drbul’s stock outlook with a Hold analyst consensus. (See TIF stock analysis on TipRanks)

The information was confirmed by an LVMH spokesperson, who said the executive would soon be replaced.

More from WWD

Comar, a former Chanel executive, had taken the position in 2017 and steered the label’s expansion abroad over his three-year tenure. In 2018, the brand celebrated its launch at Saks Fifth Avenue in Beverly Hills, followed by a store in the Peninsula hotel in Hong Kong, and in Selfridges in London, as well as Dubai.

Comar was not immediately reachable for comment.

The label is known for the modern, minimalist approach of its designer Gaia Repossi, who has been creative director since 2007. She has built a niche for the label with multiband Berbère rings, which take inspiration from the tattoos of Tuareg nomads in North Africa, and ear cuffs. Her jewelry has been worn by celebrities including Isabelle Huppert, Emma Stone and Keira Knightley. Repossi cites Richard Serra and Cy Twombly as influences on her work, as well as the Brutalist movement. The brand sponsored a retrospective of work by Donald Judd at the Museum of Modern Art in New York, its first major arts sponsorship.

Repossi is known to have personal relations with LVMH executive committee member and second-in-command at Louis Vuitton Delphine Arnault, who was instrumental in forging an alliance with the French luxury group. LVMH took a minority stake in the Italian jeweler in 2015, and owned 69 percent at the end of last year.

LVMH’s watches and jewelry division, which includes Bulgari, Chaumet and Fred, has been hit hard by the coronavirus crisis, with sales down 38 percent in the first half of the year.

The high-end Italian jewelry house traces its origins to the Forties, and opened its first store in Monaco in 1977 and in Paris in 1986.

Repossi brought in star architect Rem Koolhaas to design futuristic interiors for a revamp of the Place Vendôme flagship that was unveiled in 2016."
LVMH bites back in counter-lawsuit against Tiffany & Co for crisis mismanagement - The Moodie Davitt Report,"Thu, 10 Sep 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vbW9vZGllZGF2aXR0cmVwb3J0LmNvbS9sdm1oLWJpdGVzLWJhY2staW4tY291bnRlci1sYXdzdWl0LWFnYWluc3QtdGlmZmFueS1jby1mb3ItY3Jpc2lzLW1pc21hbmFnZW1lbnQv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"FRANCE. LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton (LVMH) today announced that it will be filing a counter-lawsuit in response to the one filed by Tiffany & Co after the sudden breakdown of acquisition negotiations.

As reported, LVMH announced yesterday that it will not be completing the acquisition of Tiffany & Co, due to complications surrounding the deal. This includes a warning by the French European and Foreign Affairs minister related to the threat of taxes on French products by the US.

As a result, the US jewellery firm filed a lawsuit in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware yesterday, seeking an order which would require LVMH to abide by its contractual obligation to complete the transaction on the agreed terms.

In a statement today, LVMH said: “LVMH considers that this action is totally unfounded. It has clearly been prepared by Tiffany a long time ago and communicated in a misleading way to shareholders and is defamatory.

“LVMH will defend itself vigorously,” the company added. “The long preparation of this assignment demonstrates the dishonesty of Tiffany in its relations with LVMH. This action is essentially based on the accusation by Tiffany that LVMH failed to take the reasonably necessary steps to obtain the various regulatory authorities’ approvals in a timely way.”

LVMH continued by saying that the filing for the agreement will continue as scheduled, denying Tiffany’s allegations that it has intentionally delayed proceedings. It said, “This accusation has no substance and LVMH will demonstrate this to the Delaware Court. On this matter, the filing in Brussels will take place, as expected, in the following days and this is simply the result of the planning fixed by the European Commission, about which Tiffany is completely aware. It is legitimate to expect this authorisation will be obtained in October.”

According to LVMH, the Board examined Tiffany & Co’s current economic situation and its mismanagement of the COVID-19 crisis. “The first-half results and its perspectives for 2020 are very disappointing, and significantly inferior to those of comparable brands of the LVMH Group during this period,” said the company.

LVMH also stressed that the period is impacted by a Material Adverse Effect and that the US jewellery house did not follow an ordinary course of business. According to LVMH, Tiffany & Co distributed substantial dividends when the company was making a loss and so the operations and organisation of the company have been severely destabilised.

This statement is in direct response to Tiffany & Co’s comment yesterday saying that LVMH was in breach of contractual obligations.

Tiffany said that the lawsuit “not only makes clear that LVMH is in breach of its obligations relating to obtaining antitrust clearance, but also refutes LVMH’s suggestions that it can avoid completing the acquisition by claiming Tiffany has undergone a Material Adverse Effect or breached its obligations under the Merger Agreement, or that the transaction is in some way inconsistent with its patriotic duties as a French corporation.”"

French luxury goods group LVMH (MC.PA) said on Thursday it intends to sue US jewellery chain Tiffany (TIF) for “mismanagement” of the COVID-19 crisis, deepening the messy rift between the two companies that had been due to seal a $16bn (£12.3bn) deal.

LVMH said in a statement it would sue Tiffany for “crisis mismanagement,” alleging the company botched its handling of the COVID-19 crisis and destroyed value for LVMH, which had been due to buy the business.

“The first half results and its perspectives for 2020 are very disappointing, and significantly inferior to those of comparable brands of the LVMH Group during this period,” LVMH said in a statement. The group owns brands like Louis Vuitton and Christian Dior, as well as jewellery houses such as TAG Heuer and Bulgari.

LVMH accused Tiffany’s executives of “not follow an ordinary course of business, notably in distributing substantial dividends when the company was loss making.”

The French company argued that the terms of November’s takeover deal had therefore been breached and “the necessary conditions for the conclusion of the acquisition of Tiffany are not fulfilled.”

LVMH’s notice comes a day after it announced it was walking away from plans to buy Tiffany for $16bn. Since the deal was announced last year, the COVID-19 crisis has hit the global luxury market and trade tensions have flared between the US and France.

Tiffany said on Wednesday it would sue LVMH to try and force completion of the takeover. The jewellery business accused LVMH of slow rolling paperwork on the acquisition in an attempt to intentionally scupper the deal.

LVMH said the lawsuit was “totally unfounded” and “defamatory,” promising to “defend itself vigorously.”

“The long preparation of this assignment demonstrates the dishonesty of Tiffany in its relations with LVMH,” the company said on Thursday.

Shares in LVMH were down 0.7% in Paris by early afternoon. Tiffany shares were up almost half a percent in the pre-market in New York, having closed down 6.4% on Wednesday."

The deal would have been the biggest and most valuable merger in fashion history, according to the New York Times. But after the pandemic decimated the luxury sector, LVMH reconsidered. The fashion conglomerate announced last week it was cancelling the deal and leaving the jewelry brand high and dry in the middle of a retail apocalypse. They’ve also gotten the French government involved, accused the jeweler of mismanaging their business, and sparked what’s become an all-out battle between two of fashion’s most powerful players. Here’s what you need to know about the merger and what went wrong.

What is LVMH?

Since 1987, the year that Louis Vuitton and champagne-cognac brand Moet Hennesy merged into LVMH, the conglomerate has been building a luxury monopoly, scooping up iconic brands across fashion, cosmetics, liquor and hotels. Under their thumb in just fashion are Céline, Marc Jacobs, Christian Dior, Kenzo, Givenchy, Loewe, Fenty and Fendi. (Just six companies own the top 40 brands in fashion).

What did the deal look like?

When it was announced in November, it seemed like a match made in heaven. Tiffanys, one of the world’s best known jewelry brands, would be a strategic and valuable addition to LVMH’s portfolio that would boost their presence in the US and grow their share of the jewelry and watch market. In turn, the takeover would pluck Tiffany’s out of declining relevance and a sales slump, as they struggled with fluctuating tourist flows and interest from younger shoppers, setting them up for long-term growth. LVMH offered the company $135 per share — $36.45 per share more than their market value of $98.55 — according to Busness of Fashion back in November when the deal was announced. The total figure is worth more than LVMH’s takeover of Christian Dior for $13 million in 2017.

“Tiffany has been synonymous with elegance, innovative design, fine craftsmanship and creative excellence,” read a LVMH press release. Arnauld himself promised that Tiffany’s would continue to “thrive for centuries to come” under LMVH’s care.

The deal spiked both Tiffany’s Facebook chatter from around 60,000 to 100,000 alongside their stock price. As things have gone south, both have been on the fritz.

What was the first sign of trouble?

LVMH was first rumored to be getting cold feet in late May and early June, after Covid-19 transmission rates continued to rise in the US and racial justice protests overtook American cities. In a press release on June 4, LVMH confirmed they were no longer offering the $135 per share price and wanted to renegotiate to seek a lower price. WWD reported that, due to the pandemic and protest’s disruption of retail in Tiffany’s home market, LVMH board members questioned the jeweler’s “ability to cover its debt covenants” after the deal was done. In August, the companies also squabbled over Tiffany’s right to delay the closing deadline, though they settled on a new November close date. It wasn’t the first big fashion deal to be thrown on the rocks by current events. Private equity firm Sycamore Partners dropped a deal to acquire Victoria’s Secret from L Brands in May for similar reasons.

When did LVMH officially pull out and how did they play it?

On September 9, news broke that LVMH was officially pulling out of the deal due to a “succession of events.” Specifically, the company cited a letter from the French foreign ministry forcing them to postpone the deal until January 6 — a month after the closing deadline stipulated in the merger, giving them a legal exit (they say). LVMH said, according to the Wall Street Journal, that France was imposing the delay because of the US’ threats to impose a tax on French goods: Trump’s retaliation to a French “tech tax” on American companies like Facebook, Google and Amazon.

Is the French government actually involved?

LVMH says the “governmental order” leaves them with “no other choice.” However, some feel the letter’s timing was suspiciously convenient for LVMH, which has spent months looking for an exit strategy. “A person familiar with the government’s thinking says Arnault asked for help to let him wiggle out of the purchase,” reports Bloomberg. The outlet says the whole situation “underscores” Arnault’s “reach into the highest political echelons.”

It wouldn’t be the first time Arnault, known in fashion as “the wolf in cashmere,” used aggressive business tactics: LVMH was reportedly considering a hostile takeover of Hermés in 2017. Adding to suspicion, TIffany’s representatives were only allowed to view a translated version French government’s letter, which was dated from over a week earlier, for a few minutes and weren’t allowed to take pictures. LVMH chief financial officer disputed these rumors to the New York Times. “Are you seriously suggesting that we procure the letter?” he asked, adding later: “It was fully unsolicited.”

What is Tiffany’s game plan?

Tiffany’s is calling bullshit. They’ve gone straight to court to try to save the deal, arguing that the foreign ministry’s letter isn’t a legal basis to end the deal, and that LVMH breached their contractual “consulting obligations” by leaving Tiffany’s out of discussions with the French government. In a press release, Tiffany’s suggest LVMH initially undermined the deal, dragging their feet and failing to file antitrust paperwork in multiple necessary regions.

Chairman Roger Farah, also alleged that no other French companies have received a similar letter delaying trade with the US, saying it’s evidence of LMVH’s “unclean hands,” according to Bloomberg.

How is LVMH fighting the lawsuit?

The dealings have gotten dirty. Despite their glowing words about Tiffany’s months before, LVMH is counter-suing. The conglomerate claimed in a press release that Tiffany’s suit was “clearly'' prepared “a long time ago,” and demonstrates “the dishonesty of Tiffany in its relations with LVMH.” LVMH also berated Tiffany’s performance during the pandemic as ”very disappointing, and significantly inferior to those of comparable brands” and said the jeweler mismanaged their business by deciding to pay out dividends despite the health crisis. All of this, they say ”confirms that the necessary conditions for the conclusion of the acquisition of Tiffany are not fulfilled.”

Where does this leave Tiffany’s and LVMH?

Arguably, Tiffany’s needed LVMH more than LVMH needed Tiffany’s. However, according to Business of Fashion, LVMH solicited the jeweler, not the other way round. Although Tiffany executives are “in wait-and-see-mode” Tiffany Chief Executive Alessandro Bogliolo told employees that, even if the deal collapses “Tiffany will be fine as it is.” The outlet points out that, although the jeweler’s shares have fallen to around $113, the whole ordeal still leaves Tiffany shares 15% higher than before the deal was announced. “That means that investors value Tiffany 16 percent higher despite both Covid-19's blow to sales and the prospect of no LVMH deal,” the outlet writes.

“At the end of the day, Tiffany will be OK... it offers an image and a history that is kind of second to none and is highly attractive because of that,” consultant Robert Burke tells Business of Fashion. Some industry insiders still think there’s hope for the deal. For LMVH’s part, both their share price and Facebook likes have increased since the beginning of the Tiffany deal, despite all the turmoil. Tiffany and LMVH might have been stronger together, but neither is going anywhere anytime soon.

He turned his father’s construction company into the world’s largest luxury conglomerate with a series of savvy acquisitions starting with the purchase of Dior in the early 80s by taking over the label’s bankrupt owner Boussac, then mastering an internal power struggle to control Louis Vuitton Moët Hennessy, followed by the rapid purchase of dozens of jewellers and heritage labels in the 2000s.

This week, LVMH called off the $16.2 billion Tiffany & Co. acquisition “as it stands”, the biggest deal in luxury history, citing a directive from the French government to delay the deal due to the deadlock with the US on tariffs, and a request from Tiffany to extend the deadline beyond the agreed date. A legal battle has begun.

The fallout of the deal, beyond the legal wranglings, signifies first and foremost LVMH wants a good price for the US jeweller, analysts say. The impact of Covid-19 on Tiffany has been worse than competitors, including LVMH who also owns Bulgari, and the $135-a-share deal was looking increasingly overpriced, analysts suggest. The French government’s letter to LVMH directing the business to hold off the deal until January amid wrangling between President Macron and President Trump over America’s new 25 per cent luxury tax on French goods in retaliation over a French (GAFA) digital tax on US tech firms, complicates the deal further. But it may also offer leverage for Mr Arnault in future negotiations. (The tariffs could be implemented starting in January, if both countries don’t reach an agreement by then.)

“Such a request is convenient for LVMH, while it is useful for the French government to have this deal as a further bargaining chip in the negotiations with the US administration. With the US elections coming up in November, we shall see how those go,” says Bernstein analyst Luca Solca.

LVMH hasn’t written off future negotiations. “The only sizable company in the US in jewellery is Tiffany. That’s why we wanted to enter into a transaction with them,” LVMH chief financial officer Jean-Jacques Guiony told reporters on Wednesday. “Things are turning a bit different but I will not speculate as to what we may or may not do in the US in the future.”

Tiffany filed a lawsuit in the court of chancery of the state of Delaware against LVMH to require the French group to abide by contractual obligation to complete the transaction and accusing LVMH of foot-dragging on receiving regulatory clearance. “We believe that LVMH will seek to use any available means in an attempt to avoid closing the transaction on the agreed terms,” Roger Farah, chairman of the Tiffany board stated. “Moreover, this supposed official French effort to retaliate against the US for proposed new tariffs has never been announced or discussed publicly; how could it possibly then be an effort to pressure the US into revoking the tariffs?”"

LVMH vs Tiffany: Deal or No Deal? | BoF - The Business of Fashion,"Mon, 21 Sep 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzb2ZmYXNoaW9uLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy9sdXh1cnkvbHZtaC10aWZmYW55LWJhdHRsZS1kZWFsL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"NEW YORK and PARIS — On Monday, September 21, a Delaware court will hear Tiffany & Co.'s case to force French luxury group LVMH and its Chairman and Chief Executive, Bernard Arnault, to move ahead with its $16.2 billion acquisition of the historic American jeweller, agreed upon in November 2019, just months before Covid-19 shuttered stores and pushed the profitability of luxury and fashion companies off a cliff.

After months of insisting it would honour the deal, LVMH has walked away — with both parties lashing out publicly against each other, throwing accusations of pandemic-era mismanagement left and right — and finds itself in a face-off against Tiffany in court. The French group claims it can't pursue the deal due to a French government request amid trade turmoil with the United States, while Tiffany claims the attempt to back out of the agreement is a means to negotiate a lower price.

Last-hour renegotiations in mergers and acquisitions often happen when the buyer sees an opportunity to strike a better deal. “This isn’t an isolated manoeuvre,” said Kathryn Rudie Harrigan, a professor at Columbia Business School. But the high price LVMH agreed to pay for Tiffany — and Arnault’s history of landing in court to get exactly what he wants — means that this match made in high-end heaven is far from guaranteed.

In court, Tiffany will argue, according to a suit filed last week, that LVMH has intentionally dragged out regulatory approvals and fished for evidence of mismanagement that could invalidate the deal. (Since Tiffany filed its suit, LVMH has filed for regulatory approval in the European Union and had anti-trust clearances expedited in Taiwan. The deal was also approved in Mexico and Japan during this time period.)

While Tiffany wants to expedite the case, LVMH is asking for a six-month delay.

For LVMH, the strategic rationale for closing the deal remains sound. After long dominating the market for ""soft"" luxuries including leather handbags and shoes, the acquisition of Tiffany would change the game for the French group by more than doubling its share in so-called ""hard"" luxuries, which include fine jewellery and watches. LVMH has long trailed Cartier- and Van Cleef & Arpels-owner Richemont in this space, though it gained ground with its 2011 acquisition of Italian jeweller Bulgari.

For Tiffany, too, which has lagged in modernising its retail stores and marketing campaigns, being acquired by LVMH would bring welcome expertise in branding and customer experience in order to combat a tough North American market and accelerate progress in China.

But with 2020 came the coronavirus, which forced store closures and crushed consumer demand, shrinking sales and margins for both firms. With luxury sales down an average of 41 percent in the second quarter of the year, according to UBS, it’s no surprise that LVMH no longer wants to close at the original price.

While Tiffany's position is clear — the jeweller is pressing for the deal to go ahead at full price — LVMH's objective isn't as easy to divine. Arnault has been interested in Tiffany for decades, and he doggedly and aggressively pursued this purchase at the height of the market. (In the suit, Tiffany said that LVMH increased its bid five times, including three times in one day before an agreement.)

Whether Arnault still thinks LVMH can afford to pay for and integrate an acquisition of this size is cloudier. Either way, he is unlikely to want to pay full price if he believes he can do better.

""The deal still makes sense strategically, but for Mr. Arnault, it's also important to act and be seen as a smart buyer,"" said Mario Ortelli, a luxury consultant. “When you play hardball, as Arnault has shown in the past he’s willing to do, sometimes you have to make believe you’re really walking away.""

Whether the deal is consummated at the original price, renegotiated or falls apart definitively will depend on several factors. What's the standard for managing a company ""according to the ordinary course"" during an unprecedented pandemic? Is Tiffany ready to go up against LVMH in litigation? And most importantly, how badly does Arnault want the asset?

BoF lays out five possible outcomes.

DEAL

Scenario 1: Tiffany gets LVMH to close the deal at the original price.

Tiffany's case against LVMH is set to be tried in Delaware, a state which, as the legal base for many multinational companies, prizes its expertise and efficiency in litigating financial disputes. Multi-billion dollar merger contracts are familiar to judges there, who could review the case quickly and demand that LVMH move forward.

N2E43Z26GJA2FG23B3JLMQJ5VA

Tiffany's stock is still trading as high as $116 per share, while analysts estimate it would be worth as little as $75 if the deal collapsed, implying many investors are still banking on a deal at or close to Arnault's original price of $135 per share.

At present, LVMH's principal argument for voiding the merger contract has been that it can't close the deal due to a request for delay from the French government. LVMH said that, in a letter, the foreign minister asked to hold off on closing the deal while a trade agreement is negotiated with the US. (The US is threatening to raise tariffs on French goods in response to an effort to tax American internet companies.) However, LVMH has yet to release the original letter, only an English translation.

If the court decides not to consider that request as legally binding, LVMH will have to find another way out of the contract or pay up. French officials are already saying that the request was merely ""advice"" to the company and not an order, Reuters reported.

“This situation shows the high level of proximity between the French establishment and the government,” said Sophie Vermeille, a French corporate law specialist. But Vermeille doesn’t expect the administration to back up LVMH’s assertion that the letter should be seen as binding. “The French administration would not take a route that would be broadly criticised, or could even be illegal, to preserve the interests of a private party, even one as important as LVMH.”

LVMH could fight an unfavourable ruling and further tie up the deal in courts. But other factors could encourage the company to get the deal back on track. Luxury sales or the economy as a whole could rebound more quickly than expected from the Covid-19 crisis, making the original price appear palatable again. A coronavirus vaccine, a trade agreement with the US, economic stimulus packages or the threat of a competing buyer for Tiffany are all wild cards that could support this outcome.

If Tiffany has its way, it will emerge with a full-price deal and could even seek damages for delays in closing, a person familiar with the board's thinking said.

Scenario 2: The deal is done, but at a lower price than previously agreed.

It's hard to imagine that Arnault, who was ready to pay $16 billion for Tiffany, has truly lost his appetite for acquiring the company.

Tiffany's suit claims that before calling off the deal, LVMH had already deployed numerous tactics aimed at securing a lower price—which the jeweller currently has no intention of accepting, a person familiar with the board’s thinking said.

But LVMH has so far revealed few details of its case for voiding the merger, and the strength of its arguments will be a key variable.

“Throughout this litigation, the board of Tiffany will be constantly engaging in an internal calculation of whether or not they’re going to win,” said Brian Quinn, a law professor at Boston College.

Whether Tiffany would eventually settle for less money could depend on how certain the brand's managers are to win their case, as well as how confident they are that the deal could be enforced promptly (or if litigation will drag on). They'll also be factoring in the chance that they could walk away with nothing.

Analysts at investment banking firm Cowen & Co. estimate that Tiffany shares could plunge to $75 should a deal fail to materialise — a bit more than half the price Arnault agreed. If Arnault renegotiated the deal as high as $120 per share, that would still save him around $2 billion.

LVMH could try to prove that a ""Material Adverse Effect"" (or ""act of God"") clause has been triggered since the pandemic. They could also argue that Tiffany's executives failed to manage the brand according to the ""ordinary course of business"" since the deal was struck. On a call with reporters in early September, LMVH Chief Financial Officer Jean-Jacques Guiony railed at Tiffany for paying a cash dividend to shareholders even after the company became loss-making during the lockdowns.

Tiffany, which has since returned to profitability, will argue it had the right to pay dividends during the merger period. (The original agreement indicated that Tiffany should pay dividends after signing and before closing.) Ultimately, an argument criticising management's choices is likely to be an uphill climb.

""LVMH can argue that Tiffany breached its covenant by not operating in the ordinary course,” Quinn said. “But how do you say what is the ordinary course in a global pandemic?""

For Tiffany, the question will be: what is better for shareholders? To cash-out at a lower price, or remain independent? This calculation depends on Tiffany’s long-term prospects.

“You have to be realistic,” said Columbia’s Harrigan. “If this is as high an offer as they’ve ever gotten and ever likely to get… the world is changing.”

Scenario 3: Arnault goes hostile, tries to buy Tiffany on the public market.

LVMH denied reports earlier this summer that it would buy Tiffany shares on the open market, taking advantage of the fact that the jeweller’s market capitalisation is lower than the price enshrined in the deal. Even so, the market reports called attention to the fact that Tiffany's shareholding is fragmented, with many small stakes and shares traded openly on the market, making it a potentially viable target for a hostile takeover.

If LVMH wriggles out of its current merger contract, could it really take control of Tiffany's shares simply by buying them on the open market, rather than negotiating a new deal? Bernard Arnault once bought as much as 23 percent of Hermès, secretly building up shares through various investment vehicles before he was found out (and ordered to sell). But such a move is unlikely in the US, where corporations can defend themselves from hostile takeovers by adopting ""poison pill"" clauses that dilute the stakes of unwanted investors.

""A hostile takeover quickly becomes a Sisyphean task,"" Boston College's Quinn said, referring to the figure of Greek mythology condemned for eternity to push a boulder up a hill.

In the case of Tiffany, the board would remind shareholders that Arnault and LVMH had been willing to pay a hefty buyer's premium previously and take steps to prevent him from circumventing their approval in the future.

NO DEAL

Scenario 4: The deal dissolves, but someone else swoops in.

If the relationship between LVMH and Tiffany further disintegrates, another party could swoop in and make a competing offer.

The two most obvious bidders would be hard-luxury leader Richemont and Kering, LVMH's greatest competitor in fashion and accessories. For Richemont, winning Tiffany would be a defence against LVMH's growing power in the watches and jewellery space. But in the past few years, Richemont has lost hundreds of millions of dollars running Yoox Net-a-Porter Group, and also had difficulty in the watch market, which took a hit as Chinese government gifting policies changed. The watch market has also been affected by the rise of the Apple Watch and the shifting priorities of young luxury consumers across the globe.

For Kering, buying Tiffany would give it much stronger footing in the hard luxury space. Earlier this month, the group's watch brands said they'd lay off 25 percent of employees due to declining sales. And while French jeweller Boucheron has raised its profile under Kering's umbrella, it's still small compared to market leaders. Buying Tiffany would market Pinault's second major acquisition since taking over the company in 2006 — the first was his troubled purchase of Puma, which the group spun off in 2018 — and mirror his father's white-night acquisition of the Gucci Group out from the clutch of Arnault in 2001.

But whether either Richemont or Kering is hungry for such a deal remains unclear.

Richemont, a cash-rich company, is warning it needs to ""err on the side of caution"" because of how much it has lost in the pandemic. Also, Richemont, while an expert in hard luxury, lags competitors in marketing, branding and store experience, areas where Tiffany needs support.

For Kering, which has the least expertise in hard luxury of the ""big three"" major groups, taking on such a large acquisition may be riskier than for its two rivals. Most importantly, neither of these companies would likely do an all-cash deal. Instead, it would be a mix of stock and cash, not as good for Tiffany shareholders. Tiffany executives insist that the company was not seeking a buyer before LVMH showed interest, which means it would take a lot to convince the board that another deal was worth pursuing.

“It comes down to shareholder approval at a certain price,” said Chen, the Cowen analyst. “What is someone willing to pay, and what are shareholders willing to accept?”

Scenario 5: Tiffany remains independent.

In a Delaware court, LVMH will struggle to prove that the pandemic and socioeconomic outlook degraded Tiffany enough that the deal should not be honoured. Material adverse claims are difficult to prove in court, especially when both companies have healthy balance sheets. At the end of the second quarter of 2020, Tiffany had more than $1 billion in cash and cash equivalents available. LVMH, while struck hard by the lockdowns, had already raised more than $10 billion in cash to fund the deal — much of it at negative interest rates — in a record-breaking bond sale in February.

“The clauses’ vagueness means that they are hard to prove and therefore expensive to litigate, so parties often don’t want to spend the money to litigate them,” said Cathy Hwang, a professor of law specialising in mergers and acquisitions at the University of Virginia. “The other thing is that Delaware has just always found that there’s a high bar to establishing a material adverse change or event.” The first-ever Delaware ruling in favour of a party citing the material adverse claim was only in 2018.

Of course, Arnault is not just any adversary, and the dissolution of private equity firm Sycamore's deal to buy Victoria's Secret early in the pandemic could spur a new way of thinking, even if that particular case was settled out of court.

If the court in Delaware rules in favour of LVMH, Tiffany could very well go it alone and still appease shareholders, who have received dividends for 131 consecutive quarters.

“The things that LVMH has liked about this business haven’t really changed,” said Cowen analyst Oliver Chen, citing the company’s strength in bridal, the success of its modern fashion collections — the Tiffany “T” line, first introduced just a few years ago, generates around $1 billion in annual sales — as well as its China growth, where sales spiked 90 percent following the lifting of lockdown restrictions. “What’s happening right now in terms with mergers, agreements, lawsuits — they don't necessarily impact five years from now. LVMH typically owns brands with long-term histories.”

“If they’re a good board, [Tiffany] will tell Arnault to go take a walk and look at his numbers again,” added Columbia’s Harrigan.

Then again, Tiffany’s troubles in North America precede the pandemic. As social mores shift, with people marrying later and the traditional princess-bride wedding waning in popularity, the company needs to modernise its image — and fast. It has begun that process with the renovation of its Fifth Avenue flagship and release of new product lines, but there is more work to do on retail, marketing and design, all areas of strength at LVMH.

In an increasingly consolidated industry, being a part of a larger group would no doubt be beneficial. While other potential acquisition targets might be more wary of LVMH than they would have been prior to the events of the last few months, big groups like Arnault's — which have suffered during the pandemic but not as much as most — remain one of the only viable strategic options. Moving forward, it's only getting harder to go it alone.

NEW YORK/MILAN/PARIS (Reuters) - LVMH <LVMH.PA>, the world's biggest luxury group, has called off its $16-billion(12.51 billion pounds) engagement to Tiffany <TIF.N>. Wall Street however seems to think the U.S. jeweler will fare just fine by itself.

The jilted bride thinks so, too.

On Wednesday, after news that LVMH would not proceed with its takeover deal, Tiffany Chief Executive Alessandro Bogliolo held a call with employees, saying the executives are in wait-and-see mode. He told employees that Tiffany executives hadn't solicited LVMH's takeover. If the deal collapses, he said, Tiffany will be fine as it is. Tiffany declined to comment.

Tiffany's shares ended trading Thursday at $114.36. Before news of the deal - in which LVMH offered $135 per share to Tiffany’s investors - came out in October, Tiffany shares were at $98.55. That means that investors value Tiffany 16% higher despite both COVID-19's blow to sales and the prospect of no LVMH deal.

""It certainly seemed as if this deal was a strength in numbers for both sides,"" said Robert Burke, founder of an eponymous luxury retail consulting firm. ""But at the end of the day, Tiffany will be OK... it offers an image and a history that is kind of second to none and is highly attractive because of that.""

LVMH, led by billionaire Bernard Arnault, said earlier this week it could not complete its purchase after the French government requested a delay on closing the transaction.

Tiffany executives were thrilled with the deal when it was agreed with LVMH last year, seeing it as the culmination of their turnaround efforts, according to a person familiar with the matter.

Longer-term, there are questions about Tiffany’s prospects in a prolonged economic downturn, particularly if governments raise taxes and property prices plummet.

In a lawsuit filed in Delaware on Wednesday, Tiffany alleged that starting in late March, LVMH began foot-dragging on antitrust compliance as a strategy to kill the deal.

Story continues

""LVMH has sought to delay and impede the regulatory approval processes in every manner possible,” Tiffany stated in its complaint.

The deal would have been the biggest-ever in the global luxury industry, allowing Tiffany to quickly expand its global presence and invest more money in spruced-up stores and new collections without having to report quarterly earnings to shareholders. LVMH could use Tiffany to broaden its U.S. presence and help grow its smallest jewelry and watch business.

OTHER TAKEOVER TARGETS?

Asked whether LVMH had any other U.S. acquisition plans, LVMH Chief Financial Officer Jean Jacques Guiony said Tiffany is the only major jewelry player in the country and would not speculate further.

Shares of a rival, the Switzerland-based luxury jeweler and watchmaker Richemont, were up 5% Thursday as its name surfaced in analyst reports as a possible alternative target for LVMH.

Some industry insiders say LVMH's U-turn opens the way to negotiations rather than an acrimonious break-up. Brokerage Oppenheimer expects LVMH to cut its bid to $108 per Tiffany share.

Bernstein analyst Luca Solca said Richemont, as well as LVMH’s French rival Kering <PRTP.PA>, could emerge as suitors for Tiffany. “While it is unclear if and at what level these companies could be interested, the notion that Tiffany is open to M&A should be a support,” he said.

A TOUGH ECONOMY

To be sure, Tiffany and peers face major headwinds as the health emergency has plunged major economies into recession and brought international tourism to a halt, and it may have less of a buffer against them on its own.

Based in New York and best known for its diamond engagement rings, Tiffany has worked to attract a younger clientele with more affordable offerings, invested heavily in its online business, and, over the last couple of years especially, prioritized China. The Asia-Pacific region accounted for approximately 28% of Tiffany's worldwide net sales in 2019.

Standalone luxury goods brands, including Britain's Burberry or Italy's Salvatore Ferragamo, have underperformed the major conglomerates that dominate the industry in recent years. They are less able to hedge themselves against changes in trends and tastes - while LVMH, for instance, has over 70 brands in its portfolio, including cash cows like Louis Vuitton, eclipsing problems at its smaller labels.

The big groups have also succeeded in drowning out rivals in the marketing stakes, with major investments in social media advertising, for example.

Back in November 2019, when LVMH sealed the acquisition, media-shy Bernard Arnault – France's richest man and a shrewd deal maker who has built an empire through acquisitions -- did a full round of press interviews waxing lyrical about what he called an American icon. He said Tiffany has created a strong brand image, including an identifiable blue-egg color of its own.

“We’re the owner of a color,” the 71-year-old told Reuters at the time. “It’s a pretty rare thing.”

This week, LVMH filed a countersuit against Tiffany, accusing it of mismanagement through the coronavirus pandemic. It said Tiffany had underperformed LVMH’s comparable brands in the first half of the year, and questioned the fact that it had gone ahead with quarterly dividend payments despite booking a net loss of $33 million and a revenue decline of 34% in the six months to end-July.

""We cannot be very pleased with a loss-making company,” LVMH finance chief Guiony told reporters.

France's presidential palace asked the country's Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian to write to LVMH advising the luxury goods company to defer its purchase of US jeweler Tiffany, two sources familiar with the letter's origins told Reuters.The French company's $16 billion purchase of Tiffany hit the rocks this month after LVMH said it could not complete the deal by a November 24 deadline, triggering a legal battle.LVMH cited, in part, an official foreign ministry request to delay closing the deal to January amid trade tensions with the US. The letter requesting the delay was signed by Le Drian, US legal filings by Tiffany and LVMH show.The two sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the Elysee Palace, President Emmanuel Macron's office, had asked Le Drian to produce the letter.The Elysee declined to comment. A spokeswoman for the foreign ministry referred questions to a representative for Le Drian, who did not immediately respond.Le Drian said in parliament on Tuesday, that, in the context of an ongoing trade row with the US, his ministry had received an enquiry from LVMH, and that it was natural for him to respond with advice. There was no immediate comment from LVMH on Le Drian's remarksAsked by Reuters about any interactions between the Elysee and the foreign ministry over the letter, an LVMH spokesman repeated statements denying it had solicited the letter.Tiffany declined to comment on any Elysee involvement.The coronavirus crisis has dealt a huge blow to the luxury goods sector and raised questions about whether LVMH was overpaying with its $135 a share offer.LVMH said after the deal fell apart that Tiffany had significantly underperformed LVMH's own comparable brands in the first half of 2020, and that the US group's prospects for 2020 were ""very disappointing"".In a lawsuit filed in the US state of Delaware to force the deal through, Tiffany said updated forecasts it had provided to LVMH in August projected that its earnings for the fourth quarter of 2020 would be greater than the previous year, demonstrating a rapid return to, and surpassing of, its pre-pandemic performance.Sources told Reuters in June that LVMH's billionaire owner Bernard Arnault, a dealmaker known as the ""wolf in cashmere"" who has built an empire through acquisitions, was exploring ways to renegotiate the price, something LVMH has denied.Analysts have said the two sides may still agree to close the deal at a lower price, although some did not rule out that Arnault may have already set his sights elsewhere.One point of contention has been the provenance of the August 31 letter from the foreign ministry. Lawyers for LVMH sent an English translation of it to Tiffany's lawyers, a legal filing submitted by the US firm shows.""In order to support the steps taken vis-a-vis the American government, you should defer the closing of the pending Tiffany transaction until January 6, 2021,"" the filing quoted the letter as saying.""I am sure that you will understand the need to take part in our country's efforts to defend its national interests.""Responding to media reports that LVMH had solicited the letter, the French company has said repeatedly that it had no involvement, and that any reports it was involved are malicious.Two government sources familiar with the details told Reuters that LVMH approached the French finance ministry seeking help in deferring completion of the deal.The two government sources were not the same sources who said the Elysee asked the foreign minister to provide the letter.One of the two government sources said the approach by LVMH to the finance ministry happened in mid-July. The second source did not say when it had happened.Both of the government sources said the finance ministry rejected the request from LVMH.The finance ministry declined to comment.

LVMH Is Trusting Kim Jones to Define Fendi's Post-Karl Look - The Business of Fashion,"Wed, 09 Sep 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzb2ZmYXNoaW9uLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy9sdXh1cnkva2ltLWpvbmVzLW5hbWVkLWZlbmRpcy1hcnRpc3RpYy1kaXJlY3Rvci1mb3Itd29tZW5zd2Vhci_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS, France — Kim Jones is joining the Roman fur and leather goods maker Fendi as its artistic director for womenswear, while keeping his job as the designer of LVMH stablemate Dior Homme, following in the footsteps of Fendi's late multi-tasking designer Karl Lagerfeld, who designed three brands at once.

At Dior Homme, Jones has reinvigorated sales since 2018 with a mix of luxe tailoring, streetwear and hip artist collaborations. He rose to prominence as a menswear star during a seven-year tenure as menswear director at Louis Vuitton, LVMH's biggest brand, following stints at rival group Richemont's Dunhill label and years running his own menswear brand.

But women's ready-to-wear, fur and haute couture will be new territory for the designer. So, what is it about Kim Jones that's won over LVMH's trust enough for the group to hand him the keys to yet another house, an Italian brand where tradition and culture run deep?

The designer isn't easy to categorise. You might say he was ""street,"" with his deep appreciation for Japanese streetwear and track record in launching blockbuster collaborations between Louis Vuitton and Supreme, and Dior and Nike. But then you'll see him send out softly tailored suits in pink and lilac, tied with regal sashes, reinterpreting Dior's founding fairytale aesthetic for men. Items as casual and traditionally masculine as cargo pants and combat boots brush up against pearl necklaces and opera gloves.

But if his look is full of contrasts, it's also adaptable: at Louis Vuitton, Jones took the monogrammed luggage-maker's travel heritage to heart, organising his creative process around trips to Tokyo, New Orleans or the Chilean desert, building a global catalogue of inspirations for the most global of luxury brands. And while leaving luxury's biggest brand might have appeared as a downgrade to many a designer, Jones embraced Dior's extensive archive and ateliers to tell a new story, with references that are as historical as they are global, and with an added dimension of technical research that often pushes menswear in the direction of couture.

Jones ""has continuously proven his ability to adapt to the codes and heritage of the LVMH houses while revisiting them with great modernity and audacity,"" said Bernard Arnault, LVMH's chairman and CEO, in a statement.

""Kim brings a fresh approach, he's a young spirit — but he's also an old soul,"" said Julie Gilhart, a fashion consultant and chief development officer at showroom-turned-accelerator Tomorrow. ""It's a good match for Fendi, which is such a heritage brand.""

Jones will work alongside Silvia Venturini Fendi, the granddaughter of Fendi's founders, who will return to focusing on accessories and menswear collections after taking on the overall creative directorship of the house in the wake of Lagerfeld's death last year. Serge Brunschwig, previously managing director at Dior Homme, has been Fendi's CEO since 2018.

In addition to honing his voice as the womenswear designer of a major brand for the first time, Jones will be charged with injecting a fresh fashion perspective at a house where Karl Lagerfeld's aesthetic codes reigned supreme for 54 years.

While Kim Jones is entering uncharted territory by designing for two top LVMH houses at the same time, Lagerfeld was known as the ultimate fashion multitasker. He designed a dozen or more collections each year between Fendi, Chanel and his namesake brand.

During his long tenure at Fendi, Lagerfeld dusted off what had been a stodgy fur coat maker for the Italian bourgeoisie and turned it into a global fashion brand. He re-engineered the brands coats to be much lighter, more supple, and more colourful. Sales took off in 1997 with the introduction of Venturini Fendi's Baguette purse, which ushered in the ""it bag"" era.

Fendi surpassed €1 billion in annual revenues under former CEO Pietro Beccari, who left the brand for Dior in 2018. Beccari ramped up digital communications, moved the brand upmarket by phasing out monogrammed canvas lines, and emphasised Fendi's Roman heritage with marketing spectacles such as a building a catwalk across the Trevi Fountain.

Working alongside Lagerfeld and Venturini Fendi, Beccari also increased the brand's focus on fur, expanding its use across product categories with colourful bag charms, linings and collars. The move added a luxurious touch to merchandising and reconnected bags and ready-to-wear to the brand's roots, but has also increased the risk of alienating shoppers who are increasingly concerned with animal-rights.

After launching a couture unit with “haute fourrure” or high fur shows starting in 2015, Fendi has since repositioned the outings as more traditional haute couture shows, pulling back the events' emphasis on animal pelts.

Navigating the ""fur question"" will be a key challenge for Jones as he defines a post-Lagerfeld womenswear look at Fendi. Fur is Fendi's founding product, and thus the primary source of its heritage and legitimacy as a luxury house. But it's also a category in crisis: even if it's still sported by some pop culture icons and influencers, and remains popular with clients in key markets like China, cities like Los Angeles and Sao Paolo have instated fur bans.

California, the most populous US state, banned the sale of fur last year, and top luxury brands including Prada and Gucci have said they'd stop using it in their collections.

""I'm sure Kim would have already been thinking about this before accepting the job,"" Gilhart said. ""Fendi is a lot of things beside fur. It's a billion-dollar business.""

“Over the last three years, he has built Asia into a pillar of global Sephora, expanding its footprint and building a strong organization,” Bernard Arnault, chairman and ceo of LVMH, said in an internal announcement seen by WWD.

The luxury executive also lauded Vuchot’s leadership as president of Sephora in Asia, noting he has an understanding of digital innovation, citing the need to meet “evolving expectations of consumers.”

Robert Miller, cofounder of DFS Group, thanked the outgoing executive Ed Brennan, who will leave after a three-month handover period and return as a full-time member of the DFS board of directors in January 2021.

Sales at LVMH’s selective retailing division, which includes Sephora and DFS, have been hit by global travel disruptions from the pandemic and were down by 32 percent in the first half of the year to 4.84 billion euros. DFS’ two main markets were affected to varying degrees, with Hong Kong heavily hit while store closures in Macau lasted only two weeks in the first half. DFS has been increasing digital marketing efforts, including a partnership with WeChat.

Vuchot graduated from the ESSEC business school in France and started his career at Cartier before moving on to direct Asian operations for Van Cleef & Arpels. He also has experience at DFS, where he headed operations in Greater China and South Korea in 2011."

PARIS: It's an ugly spat for such a glamorous industry: French luxury powerhouse LVMH and U.S. jeweller Tiffany & Co. are blaming each other for the collapse of what would have been the sector's biggest-ever buyout deal.Paris-based LVMH had announced Wednesday it was abandoning the $14.5 billion takeover plan because the French government had requested a delay to assess the impact of proposed U.S. tariffs. Tiffany sued to enforce the deal, and on Thursday LVMH lashed back.The Paris-based conglomerate - whose holdings including Christian Dior, Louis Vuitton , Moet & Chandon, Bulgari and Sephora - issued a statement threatening legal action of its own, accusing Tiffany of mismanaging the financial crisis prompted by virus lockdowns.LVMH criticised Tiffany for issuing dividends even as it was losing money, and Tiffany's performance in the first half of this year was ""significantly"" worse than that of other LVMH brands during the period. ""LVMH confirms that the conditions are not met"" to close the deal, it said.Even before Wednesday's announcement, the deal's value had been eroded by wider industry troubles caused by the coronavirus pandemic, which has caused retail sales to plunge around the world.Tiffany, based in New York, said LVMH's argument for halting the buyout has no basis in French law, and that LVMH hadn't attempted to seek the required antitrust approval from three jurisdictions. LVMH disputed that, and said the necessary approvals were expected in October.Tiffany, known for its delicate jewellery , distinctive blue boxes and an Audrey Hepburn movie, had been trying to transform its brand to appeal to younger and more digital shoppers. LVMH, had thought the deal would strengthen its position in high-end jewellery and in the U.S. market.The pandemic threw all those assumptions and plans in doubt, and the threat of new tariffs between the U.S. and Europe was cited as a further complicating issue."
Tiffany & Co. is in big trouble without LVMH's $16 billion takeover — here's the biggest reason why - Yahoo Finance,"Wed, 09 Sep 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiigFodHRwczovL2ZpbmFuY2UueWFob28uY29tL25ld3MvdGlmZmFueS1jby1pcy1pbi1iaWctdHJvdWJsZS13aXRob3V0LWx2bS1ocy0xNi1iaWxsaW9uLXRha2VvdmVyLWhlcmVzLXRoZS1iaWdnZXN0LXJlYXNvbi13aHktMTYzMTIxOTA2Lmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Tiffany & Co. (TIF) is about to embark back down the path of being a stand-alone public company following luxury goods giant LVMH yanking its $16 billion takeover offer.

And for Tiffany (and what’s left of their investor base), that road is likely to really suck for one primary reason — awful tourism trends globally at the hands of the COVID-19 pandemic. Unlike most in retail, Tiffany has long been over-reliant on global tourism flows to its castle-like stores in densely populated cities. The company’s iconic New York City flagship store on Fifth Avenue alone (which is being renovated and targeted for a late 2021 reopening) has accounted for 10% of worldwide sales in 2019, 2018, and 2017, according to Tiffany’s latest annual report.

Those epic flagship stores in places such as Japan and Europe are now generally filled with tumbleweeds — as opposed to throngs of international buyers with cash in hand ready to buy a $5,000 Tiffany necklace — as tourism has ground to a halt around the world. When it returns to pre-pandemic levels is very unknown. Heck, when tourism returns to 50% of pre-pandemic levels is very unknown.

The latest reads on retail spending at flagship stores and tourism more broadly are far from encouraging.

Macy’s (M) is similar to Tiffany in that it operates large stores — or flagships — in urban areas. The best example: The enormous Macy’s in New York City’s Herald Square. Before the pandemic, Macy’s Herald Square was a microcosm of the world. Now, it’s a mostly empty massive store focusing on curbside pickup.

And when Macy’s flagship stores historically struggle, it struggles to meet investor expectations. Same deal for Tiffany & Co.

“In some urban markets, including New York City, San Francisco, and Chicago, we continue to see these declines in traffic driven by the slow return of workers to the city center and the erosion in both international and domestic tourism. Thus, as expected, international tourism sales were down significantly in the quarter, and the decline impacted our Macy's Inc. crop by about 210 basis points,” warned Macy’s CFO Felicia Williams on a conference call with analysts last month.

Story continues

Meanwhile, the most recent UNWTO (United Nations World Tourism Organization) World Tourism Barometer showed a 98% year-over-year crash in international tourist numbers in May. The number of tourist arrivals between January and May plunged 56% from the prior year.

The UNTWO estimates there was a 300 million drop in the number of tourists from January through May, leading to a staggering $320 billion in lost international tourism receipts.

What all of this means for Tiffany you ask? An unfortunate stretch of terrible earnings release days in the months ahead and possibly a sharply lower share price. LVMH is a master of deals and surely knew this was brewing, so it’s hard to argue with them playing hardball on their offer price for Tiffany. The company said Wednesday it would no longer pursue the acquisition of Tiffany in light of “recent developments”, including the potential of new U.S. tariffs on French goods.

LVMH should sit tight. A year from now Tiffany’s battle through the pandemic and weak flagship store traffic is likely to leave its stock price much cheaper than current levels.

Tiffany wants Bernard Arnault to testify in court on merger intrigue - New York Post,"Thu, 10 Sep 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vbnlwb3N0LmNvbS8yMDIwLzA5LzEwL3RpZmZhbnktd2FudHMtYmVybmFyZC1hcm5hdWx0LXRvLXRlc3RpZnktb24tcmVwb3J0ZWQtYmlkLXRvLXNjcmFwLW1lcmdlci_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Tiffany & Co. wants to grill LVMH chief Bernard Arnault in court about his reported attempts to wriggle out of the $16.2 billion marriage of the luxury giants, The Post has learned.

The New York-based jeweler — which sued LVMH on Wednesday to prevent the French luxury conglomerate from backing out of the November 2019 deal — wants to force the French billionaire to testify on the stand whether he asked French officials for help to scuttle the merger, which has soured since the Covid-19 crisis tanked Tiffany’s business.

Specifically, Tiffany plans to ask Arnault — who is Europe’s richest man with a net worth of $86.5 billion — about allegations that he solicited a letter from France’s foreign affairs office that asked LVMH to delay the tie-up, sources said.

That letter arrived only because Arnault approached the French government for assistance in getting out of the deal, Bloomberg News reported this week. Arnault reportedly went to the foreign ministry after the nation’s finance ministry rejected his request.

“He’ll get questioned: Did you go to the Ministry of Finance?” a source close to the escalating legal battle told The Post.

Questions about how Arnault tried to get the letter, who approached whom, and why the Ministry of Finance did not issue the letter could be embarrassing for the fashion tycoon, who is the world’s fourth-richest person, sources close to Tiffany said.

Arnault is insulted and angry about Tiffany’s suit against LVMH, believing it is a personal attack, a source close to LVMH said. The Paris-based conglomerate said this week that the French government had asked it to delay the merger until January in response to planned US tariffs on French luxury goods.

LVMH — whose pricey labels include Louis Vuitton, Christian Dior and Marc Jacobs — said Wednesday that the foreign ministry’s letter was unsolicited. The company believes it has a valid order from the French government to delay the merger closing, according to sources close to LVMH.

Tiffany, meanwhile, suspects that LVMH pressured the French government to ask for a delay so LVMH in turn could push 183-year-old Tiffany for a price cut in the merger, sources said. LVMH agreed to pay $135 a share in the deal, but Tiffany shares were trading at $113.78 as of 10:02 a.m. Thursday.

Tiffany plans to compel Arnault to testify in the second or third week of October — though the company believes he will cave and go through with the deal rather than take the stand, the source said.

The Delaware Chancery Court, where Tiffany filed the suit, is known for moving quickly, and Tiffany has asked for an expedited trial so a judge can rule before the merger agreement’s Nov. 24 expiration.

Tiffany does not believe any letter from the French government will hold up in Delaware Chancery Court, sources said. The European Union has jurisdiction over mergers and is the only regulator for the EU countries that can order a merger be stopped.

“France is powerless to interfere with the transaction,” according to a source close to Tiffany.

LVMH declined to comment. Tiffany did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment on LVMH’s Thursday statement.

On Thursday, LVMH fired back, saying it would sue Tiffany over its management of the COVID-19 pandemic, which forced it to close stores and hammered its sales. LVMH called Tiffany’s financial results for the first half of the year “very disappointing” and “significantly inferior” to LVMH’s comparable jewelry brands, which include Bulgari, Hublot and TAG Heuer.

LVMH also rebutted Tiffany’s allegations that it failed to seek antitrust approval for the deal in key jurisdictions such as the European Union. The company said it expects EU officials will approve the deal next month after LVMH files for approval, which it plans to do in “the following days.”

Tiffany’s lawsuit “has clearly been prepared by Tiffany a long time ago and communicated in a misleading way to shareholders and is defamatory,” LVMH said in a statement. “LVMH will defend itself vigorously.”"

LVMH Greater China President witnesses Shanghai's growth as fashion hub - EastDay.com,"Sun, 27 Sep 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiMmh0dHA6Ly9lbmdsaXNoLmVhc3RkYXkuY29tL0xhdGVzdC91MWFpODY4OTMzMi5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LVMH Greater China President witnesses Shanghai’s growth as fashion hub

What is the relevance between Shanghai and fashion? According to LVMH Greater China President, Andrew Yue Wu, being an international city of fashion is a prominent positioning of Shanghai.





(Andrew Yue Wu, LVMH Greater China President)

Fashion career in Shanghai

Wu loves to talk about fashion. For him, fashion has a subtle but positive impact on Chinese young people. “After decades of exposure to fashion elements, young people will not necessarily become fixed consumers to certain brands, but as their aesthetic appreciation improves, they will become more confident. Plus, due to the economic growth, we have today what we call the ‘Chinese fashion’. Chinese youngsters are now chasing the trend together with all young people across the world.”

Born in Shanghai, Wu moved overseas in his early adult years. In the spring of 1993, a speech given by Zhu Rongji (then vice premier of China) in Toronto impressed him, which spurred him to go back to Shanghai. That year, when China’s high-end retail market started, he came to Shanghai to build Dior’s China team and direct retailing. Due to that opportunity, Wu witnessed the transition of China’s luxury market from nothing to thriving. “I still remember we rented a banquet hall as our office that summer to make plans for Dior’s retail outlets. Everything is difficult in the beginning, but we blazed the ground,” said Wu.

As he believes, since China launched the reform and opening-up policy, Shanghai has played a crucial role in the country’s economic transformation. Wu’s career in fashion is also related to Shanghai. Since joining LVMH, he has encouraged his international peers to recruit more Chinese executives, cultivate Chinese talent, develop localized industrial models and sustainable businesses, thus improving the whole industry and the market environment. That has helped Shanghai to become a capital of fashion. Moreover, LVMH has directly created tens of thousands of mid and high-end jobs and significantly promoted the upgrading of surrounding industries and commercial supporting facilities.









(Andrew Wu is honored with the Shanghai Magnolia Silver Award)

As the first Asian top manager in the global luxury fashion industry, Wu has been conferred as one of the most influential Chinese in the global fashion industry by Forbes and The Business of Fashion. In September 2020, he was also bestowed with the Shanghai Magnolia Silver Award, which as he said should be owed to the past 27 years in Shanghai. The honor is for the whole industry, he added.

(Andrew Wu’s message after winning the award)

Confidence in China during epidemic

The COVID-19 epidemic has been a sudden hit to the economy and people’s life. On January 27, on behalf of its 160,000 employees around the world, LVMH announced its donation plan to the Red Cross Society of China.

“It coincided with the Chinese New Year. Including myself and the international senior management team, during that weekend, we were studying the situation and kept in close communication, so the decision was fast.” The quick move also promoted the subsequent participation of the international fashion industry. For Wu personally, during the week, he happened to be in Canada visiting some relatives. He was also wondering what he should do. At the beginning of February, Wu decided to return to his “battlefield” and bought a flight ticket to Shanghai in mid-February, though his decision was unwise in his friends’ and relatives’ eyes. Wu said he returned to Shanghai due to his sense of responsibility for his team, and his confidence in China and Shanghai. Having experienced SARS 17 years ago, he knew that China has learnt from past lessons. Impressed by the attention to information, knowledge and professional guidance during the COVID-19 outbreak, he is confident in Shanghai’s anti-epidemic reaction and measures.





Apart from sending supportive messages and donating masks, Wu and his company has made a brave decision: all brands under LVMH should maintain operational in large and mid-sized cities across China, except in Wuhan. As he recalled, “Actually in February, there were no consumers in many shopping malls. But, except in Wuhan, our 40 brands were still open. As I put it, retailing is a city’s face, which represents our confidence. At that moment, big companies must shoulder their responsibility to support society.” In late February, LVMH sponsored a donation of medical supplies from France to Wuhan.

Starting from mid March, LVMH’s brands took the lead in recovery by launching retail promotions in China. Dior became the world’s first leading luxury brand to open a heavyweight retrospective in Shanghai in late July. In early August, Louis Vuitton moved its latest products’ world premiere from Paris to Shanghai, as the world’s first leading luxury brand to do so.

“Holding major events was no easy task. Starting from mid-March, especially in April and May, the epidemic was at its worst in Europe. Work and school were suspended in many places. International exchanges stopped. Many of our professionals are based in the French headquarters, none of whom could fly into China. It was our Chinese team that delivered the amazing task from planning to execution,” said Wu.

Looking back, Wu said he made a wise decision to return to Shanghai during the epidemic. “Shanghai, a metropolis with 25 million people, has made a quick recovery. No matter from a personal perspective, or as an international brand, I am honored and happy to be involved in the city’s anti-epidemic fight.”

International fashion turns eye on Shanghai

Over recent years, Shanghai’s aim of becoming a capital of brands, fashion and design has presented a great opportunity for itself. When asked why Shanghai is more favored by the international fashion industry, Wu said that it is because of the city’s urban charm and the continuous communication and interaction between the enlightened government and enterprises. “The advantages of Shanghai’s business environment have been highlighted once again during this epidemic. The government is constantly interacting with companies to understand the needs of the industry, providing effective help and continuously improving its ability and quality when serving companies.”

The world is fluid, and the fashion industry is especially an industry that requires a double cycle. According to Wu, that cycle “is to continuously promote the connection between China and the world, which is in line with the spirit of the CIIE.” As he revealed, this year, LVMH Group will still be a participant of the fair but will showcase itself in the France Pavilion. “For our industry, participation in the CIIE must first be displayed in the pavilion, and more importantly, we must promote the CIIE spirit to the entire Chinese market. More than 40 brands under LVMH Group have established direct contact with Chinese consumers, so the focus in the future is to study how to better serve Chinese consumers directly and satisfy their demands.”

“There is no doubt that Shanghai has become the headquarters of international luxury brands in China and is moving towards becoming the regional headquarters of the industry.” Wu will keep doing his bit in contributing to Shanghai and China’s ascent in the global fashion arena.

By :France's LVMH faces an uphill battle in walking away from its $16 billion deal to buy U.S. jeweler Tiffany & Co, with legal experts noting most mergers which end up in court are renegotiated rather than dissolved.Tiffany last week sued LVMH in the Delaware Court of Chancery, the top U.S. business court, after the maker of Louis Vuitton handbags said it could not complete the acquisition, citing a French government request to delay the close and Tiffany's deteriorating business outlook due to the COVID-19 pandemic LVMH has said it will defend itself vigorously. In a filing on Wednesday, it accused Tiffany of mismanaging the pandemic's financial fallout and arguing this has triggered a material adverse effect (MAE) that nullifies their agreement.But Delaware courts have set a high bar for buyers to walk away from deals, ever since the Court of Chancery ruled almost two decades ago that chicken producer Tyson Foods Inc had to complete its deal for rival meat company IBP Inc.That ruling came despite a severe winter that hurt the business of both companies and issues raised by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission about IBP's financial statements.""The inclination is to save the deal where it's possible and where it doesn't defeat the agreement of the parties to the deal,"" said Larry Hamermesh, professor emeritus at Delaware Law School.Tiffany declined to comment. In a prepared statement on Thursday, LVMH said there are no objective reasons why the upcoming trial should not take place in a normal timeframe.""Tiffany clearly fears a serene and fair rendering of justice,"" LVMH said in the statement.A judge will weigh in on the matter for the first time on Monday, when the court hears Tiffany's request to fast-track the case. The jeweler, famous for its robin's egg blue packaging, wants a ruling before a Nov. 24 deadline for completing the deal. LVMH has countered that there is no reason to ""move mountains"" to conduct a trial quickly.""The Court of Chancery has stepped up in this emergency to make sure that disputes are promptly decided on their merits, not by leverage resulting from delay, something especially important to vulnerable sellers,"" said Leo Strine, an attorney at Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz and former chief justice of the Delaware Supreme Court.The legal row is the largest and most high-profile yet in a series of broken deals due to the COVID-19 pandemic, including mall owner Simon Property Group Inc's move to abandon its $3.6 billion acquisition of Taubman Centers Inc and private equity firm Sycamore Partners' decision to dump L Brands Inc's lingerie line Victoria's Secret.A 2013 University of Pittsburgh study of 755 planned acquisitions found that most which experienced MAEs ended up being renegotiated on average at a 15% lower price.""There are deals that are canceled, but that is a lower percentage,"" said David Denis, one of the authors of the study and a professor of business administration at the University of Pittsburgh.To be sure, courts judge cases on their merit. In 2018, German healthcare group Fresenius SE was allowed to walk away from its $4.75 billion acquisition of Akorn Inc, because the Court of Chancery found the generic drugmaker's dramatic slump amounted to an MAE.This was a first for a Delaware court and it stunned Wall Street. Even so, the legal standard for an MAE to be triggered in Delaware remains high, lawyers say.""Our courts view the reliability and predictability of the court as one of the more important things that Delaware offers to its constituents,"" said Greg Varallo, a partner at law firm Bernstein Litowitz Berger & Grossmann.Other high-profile deals collapsed without a Delaware Chancery Court judge declaring an MAE. Energy Transfer LP cited tax problems that allowed it to walk away from its proposed $20 billion takeover of rival pipeline operator Williams Cos in 2016. The court found that Apollo Tyres Ltd had not breached its proposed $2.5 billion acquisition of Cooper Tire & Rubber in 2013 after the buyer failed to reach a contract with U.S. workers, allowing the Indian company to walk away.""If you're litigating in Delaware and you can find some other basis to get out of a merger other than an MAE clause, I think you have a better shot,"" said Jill Fisch, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania Law School.Fisch added that LVMH will likely point to a letter from the French government asking that the deal be delayed as a way to break up the deal without requiring the judge declare an MAE.Some 1,900 deals have been canceled, renegotiated or disputed around the world since the start of the pandemic, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence."
Luxury goods giant LVMH cancels $14.5B deal for Tiffany - Turks and Caicos Sun,"Wed, 16 Sep 2020 21:09:21 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vc3VudGNpLmNvbS9sdXh1cnktZ29vZHMtZ2lhbnQtbHZtaC1jYW5jZWxzLWItZGVhbC1mb3ItdGlmZmFueS1wNTQxOS0xMjYuaHRt0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Business

Luxury goods giant LVMH is ending its takeover deal of jewelry retailer Tiffany & Co., saying the French government had requested a delay to assess the threat of proposed U.S. tariffs.



Wednesday’s announcement came after the deal’s value had been eroded by wider industry troubles caused by the coronavirus pandemic.



The Paris-based conglomerate said that both the French government and Tiffany had requested that the closing of the deal be postponed by a few months. The French government, it said, wanted to assess the impact of the possible U.S. tariffs on French goods.



As a result, LVMH said, the $14.5 billion deal — which would have been biggest ever in the luxury market and was scheduled to close Nov. 24 — will be canceled.



Tiffany replied that it’s suing to enforce the merger agreement, which was signed in November 2019. The New York company said LVMH’s argument has no basis in French law. Tiffany also said that LVMH hasn’t even attempted to seek the required antitrust approval from three jurisdictions.



“We believe that LVMH will seek to use any available means in an attempt to avoid closing the transaction on the agreed terms,” said Roger Farah, chairman of Tiffany, in a statement.



Shares in Tiffany slid $7.85, or 6.4%, to close Wednesday at $113.96. Those in LVMH, which owns 75 brands including Christian Dior, Fendi, Givenchy and Tag Heuer, were stable.



The deal’s value came under strain during the pandemic, which has caused retail sales to plunge around the world. Tiffany’s share price has been trading around $125 a share for weeks — below the $135 per share price that LVMH had agreed to pay last fall, before the pandemic.



Back then, industry experts had said the deal made sense. Tiffany, known for its delicate jewelry, distinctive blue boxes and an Audrey Hepburn movie, had been trying to transform its brand to appeal to younger and more digital shoppers, and could have used an owner with deep pockets to help expand.



LVMH, led by billionaire Bernard Arnault, had thought the deal would strengthen its position in high-end jewelry and in the U.S. market. LVMH was also making a bet on China’s economy, where Tiffany had been expanding its presence.



The pandemic threw all those assumptions and plans in doubt, and the threat of new tariffs between the U.S. and Europe was cited as a further complicating issue.



Before COVID, the global market for personal luxury goods was solid, reaching a record high of $307.1 billion (260 billion euros) in 2018 — a 6% increase from the year before, according to consulting firm Bain & Co. That sector slipped by 2.1% to $331.9 (281 billion euros) last year, according to Bain estimates.



But given COVID’s financial fallout and the shutdown of tourism worldwide, those sales could drop by 20% to 35% in 2020, Bain estimates. Bain expects that personal luxury sales won’t recover to pre-COVID levels until 2022 and 2023.



Tiffany’s global sales declined 29% during the fiscal second quarter ended July 31, following a 45% drop in the fiscal first quarter.



Last year, France sought to impose a tax on global tech giants including Google, Amazon and Facebook. The French tech tax is aimed at “establishing tax justice.” France wants digital companies to pay their fair share of taxes in countries where they make money instead of using tax havens, and is pushing for an international agreement on the issue.



In response to the tech tax, the U.S. threatened to slap 100% tariffs on $2.4 billion of French products.



The two sides are at a tense truce as France has said it would delay collection of the digital tax until December, parking the issue until after the next U.S. presidential election where Trump hopes to secure another four-year term.



In a news conference on Wednesday, French government spokesman Gabriel Attal confirmed that a letter was sent by French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian to LVMH and referred to international talks about U.S. tariffs as a “very important issue.”



“The (French) government is neither naive nor passive. We have objectives that we want to reach,” he said. He wouldn’t further elaborate and said that Le Drian is expected to express his views on the issue in the coming hours.



CFO Jean Jacques Guiony of the LVMH insisted in a phone interview with reporters that the letter received Sept. 1 from the French government was legal and valid and left the group no choice.



“I don’t think their objective is to please or not to please LVMH. They don’t give a damn …,” he said. “The letter is legally valid, is legal. When you get such a legally binding and legally valid letter, you just apply it …. We will apply it.”



Asked about lowering the price to keep the deal alive, he said that had not even been considered as there is no article in the contract that would allow that.



“The deal cannot take place ... we are prohibited from closing this transaction … we have no choice.”



As for the threatened lawsuit, the CFO said that he doesn’t “see a way in between” the arguments the two sides could put forth -– we don’t do the deal on Nov. 24 and they saying that you have to do it anyway, he said.



“We’ll see what happens.”
