Some brands are shunning fur but luxury powerhouse LVMH, which owns premium brands including Dior, Marc Jacobs, Fendi, and Louis Vuitton, hasn't made the move.

Antoine Arnault — a member of the conglomerate's board, the company's head of image and environment, and son of Bernard Arnault, Europe's richest person — explained why some of LVMH's brands are continuing to sell fur, at FT Live's Business of Luxury Summit on Thursday.

Arnault said that LVMH was encouraging its brands to use lab-made fur but that their designers ultimately had full creative control, including getting to decide which materials they used.

Arnault said that the fur industry created jobs, with whole companies depending on its trade.

According to Arnault, if LVMH didn't sell fur, consumers would go to other brands that don't produce it as responsibly.

""We are not for animal cruelty, of course we fight against it,"" Arnault said. The French luxury conglomerate has come under pressure from some activists, such as PETA, to halt sales of products made from fur and the skins of exotic animals.

LVMH owns Italian fashion and accessories brand Fendi, which makes products including fox and mink fur jackets and bags made from ostrich, python, and crocodile leather.

Fendi says that all of its raw materials will be ""responsibly sourced"" by 2026. The brand says it only purchases exotic leathers from farms with strict standards on animal welfare and says it has the ""highest ethical sourcing standards"" for buying fur.

""Our mission is the ethical supply of quality furs to our customers who have chosen freely to wear fur, and we are unwaveringly committed to respecting everyone's opinion and freedom of choice,"" Fendi says on its website.

As demand for fur has dropped globally, companies making lab-grown fur have sprung up. LVMH and Fendi announced in April that they were working with Imperial College London and Central Saint Martins, UAL, to develop lab-grown fur fibres using keratin.

""Lab-grown fur seems like a much better option to me than fake fur,"" Arnault said at the Luxury of Business Summit. He said that the company was open to change but that lab-grown fur needed to have the same durability and value perception from customers for it to be rolled out across the company.

Arnault said that the LVMH is also trying to encourage sustainability by selling unused fabrics from its brands at discount prices. The online store opened last April and sells leftover fabrics and leathers, with the cheapest currently priced at $2 ($2.12) a meter.

The American retailer Nordstrom is among the bigger companies that have vowed to stop selling products made with real fur or exotic animal skin. The company hadn't used them in its own-brand product in years but this year applied the ban to third-party brands as well. The transition hasn't been without hiccups, though; a ""Fur and Faux Fur"" section on Nordstrom's website on Friday listed seven women's coats, six of which contained sheepskin — which the company still allows — but one of which featured a rabbit-fur trim. The company removed the product after Insider contacted it for comment, saying the listing was a mistake.

New York CNN Business —

To most investors, navigating today’s stock market is as treacherous as walking the plank. But for luxury investors, it’s more like strutting down the catwalk.

The United States may very well be hurtling toward a recession and the Nasdaq is suffering its worst 100-day performance on record. But luxury spending is up 14% year to date, according to Bank of America aggregated US credit & debit card data.

In short: Our weekdays are filled with photos of traders holding their heads in their hands at the New York Stock Exchange, and our weekends have been filled with photos of Kanye West and Balenciaga models stomping through the narrow alleyways of … that same exchange.

“Money is probably the biggest fetish in the world,” said Demna, the creative director of Balenciaga, while backstage at his NYSE fashion show last weekend, The luxe fashion house is now selling NYSE-branded shirts for $800.

And why not? US luxury spending was 47% higher in 2021 than in pre-Covid 2019, while jewelry spending was 40% higher, according to Bank of America data. General stock market chaos isn’t a headwind either, they say.

“We believe that many investors think that US luxury demand is highly correlated to stock market performance as a large proportion of household wealth is tied up in this asset class,” wrote Bank of America analysts in a recent note. But that’s far from the case: The bank’s data showed that in the 10 years prior to Covid, the correlation between luxury spending and the S&P 500 was less than 30%. There was no correlation at all between the price of cryptocurrency and luxury spending.

“Very strong demand from US luxury customers was the biggest positive tailwind in 2021. The strength has continued in 2022 despite a more complex macroeconomic backdrop. Higher-income consumer demand for luxury is accelerating, which we attribute to reopening and more purchase occasions (return of weddings, galas, holidays, etc.),” they wrote.

If there werea Walmart vs. Weitzman matchup today, the luxe shoe brand would take the belt. Walmart and Target have felt the brunt of rising inflation and supply-chain kinks.

“US inflation levels, particularly in food and fuel, created more pressure on margin mix and operating costs than we expected,” said Walmart CEO Doug McMilon after the company posted weaker-than-expected first quarter earnings and cut its full-year profit forecast last week.

Walmart stock is down more than 18% for the month and Target is down nearly 30%. By contrast, Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton (LVMH) fell just 5.6%, Burberry is up more than 8% and Tapestry, the company behind Coach, Kate Spade and Stuart Weitzman, has grown by more than 2%. The S&P 500 is about 3% lower for the month.

As the West presents some good news for luxury brands, China’s Covid-related shutdowns, however, have caused some concern. China’s strict containment measures in response to the latest surge in Covid have shuttered luxury stores and left goods intended to be shipped around the world stuck in Chinese ports. But increased demand in the US and Europe has offset those losses, said Ferragamo CEO Marco Gobbetti during a recent conference call.

The second quarter is also less exposed to Chinese consumption because there’s less travel and less important shopping holidays, giving luxury brands some breathing room as Asia begins to lift restrictions again. The hope is that by the third quarter, Chinese consumers will revert to “revenge shopping” from pent-up demand during lockdowns.

Still, luxury stocks are priced as though they’re in recession, wrote Bank of America analysts. “The luxury goods sector continues to come under pressure now as a result of the rising Covid cases in China,” said the note.

There have been six prior pullbacks of the luxury industry over the past two decades: The 2000-2001 dot com bubble, the 2007-2009 global financial crisis, the 2013-2014 Chinese anti-corruption campaign, China-US trade hostilities in 2018, the Covid pandemic; and China’s Common Prosperity announcement in 2021.

Those pullbacks have grown shorter and less severe over time. The first three pullbacks, on average, resulted in a 52% decline peak-to-trough over 85 weeks and took 119 weeks to recover back to the previous peak, BofA analysts found. But the last three pullbacks declined just -22% on average in 8 weeks and took only 20 weeks to recover back to previous highs.

If the patterns remain the same, then “history shows Covid-related restrictions in China are not likely to destroy luxury demand, only shift the timing, and that a share price pullback on this (low-multiple event) would be a particularly good buying opportunity,” wrote Bank of America analysts.

The evidence at hand might indicate that this downturn isn’t hitting all Americans equally. The recovery from the short-lived Covid recession was what people refer to as K-shaped. That happens when separate communities recover from economic downturns at varying rates. Some sectors of society may experience renewed growth while others continue to lag.

Growth in US fashion luxury spending grew among all income groups in 2021 as the economy recovered from Covid shocks and markets shot higher. That hasn’t been the case in 2022. Luxury spending growth has been strongest amongst the higher-income cohort, up 26% year-over-year. Lower-income earners have dropped their consumption of luxury goods by 5%.

It’s impossible to draw conclusions from such a small data sample, but the numbers sugget that this downturn could be a repeat of the 2020 K-shaped recession when many who worked in white-collar jobs recovered quickly as the government handed out stimulus payments and stocks and home prices appreciated. Those without savings and who worked service jobs continued to suffer, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

Today, it appears that Walmart shoppers are getting dinged while Balenciaga shoppers are getting $800 NYSE shirts.

Republican Senators fight back against ESG push

“With great power comes great responsibility” is an adage that both Spider-Man and asset managers have taken to heart. Some Republican Senators don’t like that – at least when it comes to asset managers.

Over the past few decades investors have flocked to index-tracking funds that give them broad access to markets for accessible prices. Large asset managers, including BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street, have grown accordingly. Together the three companies manage $22 trillion in assets. That’s equivalent to more than half the value of all shares for all the companies in the S&P 500.

That’s a lot of money. And a lot of shares. And that means these asset managers have loads of voting power over public companies.

Lately they’ve been using that power to advocate for ESG-friendly changes. They’ve pushed companies to diversify their executive staff and boards, to focus on environmentally-friendly policies and to invest in labor.

This year, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink asked companies to set short-, medium- and long-term goals to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. “These targets, and the quality of plans to meet them, are critical to the long-term economic interests of your shareholders,” he said.

Leaders in the Alaska energy sector were unhappy with that pressure. They complained to their Republican Senator Dan Sullivan, who in turn introduced legislation that would allow voting choices to be available to individual investors in passive funds if money managers own more than 1% of a company’s shares.

In other words, the investors parking money in the funds, not the fund managers, would have the voting power.

The bill is co-sponsored by 11 other Republican Senators.

“The whole ESG movement is not reflective of what America wants,” said Sullivan in a recent “Squawk Box” interview. “Why should these three companies that have monopoly power be able to vote on all these shares? It’s distorted the market tremendously to have these three companies that have massive, massive power. They own 88% of the S&P. That is a distortion of capital markets and it reflects on the energy policies we are talking about.”

BlackRock said late last year that it would soon roll out technology to allow proxy voting by clients.

EXCLUSIVE: LVMH Confirms Stéphane Rinderknech Will Lead Hospitality Division - WWD,"Mon, 09 May 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihQFodHRwczovL3d3ZC5jb20vYnVzaW5lc3MtbmV3cy9odW1hbi1yZXNvdXJjZXMvZXhjbHVzaXZlLWx2bWgtY29uZmlybXMtc3RlcGhhbmUtcmluZGVya25lY2gtd2lsbC1sZWFkLWhvc3BpdGFsaXR5LWRpdmlzaW9uLTEyMzUxNzYyMDcv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Signaling its ambitions in luxury experiences, LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton has appointed a dynamic, much admired executive to lead its hospitality division.

Stéphane Rinderknech, most recently president and chief executive officer of L’Oréal USA and a 20-year veteran of the French beauty giant, has been named chairman and CEO of LVMH Hospitality Excellence, effective June 6, WWD has learned. Rinderknech also becomes a member of LVMH’s executive committee.

The appointment confirms a WWD report on April 28 flagging Rinderknech as the likely successor to Andrea Guerra, who is exiting the role at the end of May to “pursue other interests.” Guerra will then become a strategic and development senior adviser to the French conglomerate, as reported.

LVMH made a step change in hospitality in 2018 with its surprise $2.6 billion acquisition of Belmond, prized for its fleet of marquee properties in a range of standout destinations.

LVMH Hospitality Excellence now comprises Hôtels Cheval Blanc and Belmond Hotels and Trains, which together count more than 50 luxury hotel, restaurant, train and river cruise properties. Among the marquee properties are the Cipriani in Venice, the Copacabana Palace in Rio de Janeiro, the Mount Nelson in Capetown and the Venice Simplon-Orient-Express Train.

The group’s fashion and leather goods brands have also been stepping further into experiences, with Louis Vuitton adding eateries and a chocolate shop to new flagships in Japan, while Dior’s supercharged Avenue Montaigne boutique now incorporates a restaurant, cafe, museum and hotel suite.

When La Samaritaine reopened last June after a long renovation, the landmark department store debuted a clutch of new restaurants and a Hôtel Cheval Blanc that is said to be enjoying occupancy rates in excess of 90 percent, despite the lack of Chinese tourists in the French capital. Reservations at its restaurants Le Tout-Paris and Langosteria are difficult to come by.

“High-end hospitality represents a great opportunity for our group,” Bernard Arnault, chairman and CEO of LVMH Group, said in an internal announcement seen by WWD.

The luxury titan trumpeted that Rinderknech “has demonstrated a remarkable ability to deliver impressive performances, to develop organizations and to bring out the best in talented people” throughout his career.

“His appetite to learn and constantly evolve, coupled with his agility and passion for new challenges, constitute compelling assets to lead our exceptional properties and destinations to a next level of development,” Arnault added.

In the wake of the appointment, Olivier Lefebvre, CEO of Hôtels Cheval Blanc, and Roeland Vos, chairman and CEO of Belmond Hotels & Trains, will report to Rinderknech.

“I am thrilled to join the LVMH Group and to take the lead of its Hospitality Excellence division,” Rinderknech commented in the announcement. “During my many years living abroad, I have developed a deep passion for the art of hospitality and its variations around the world.

“With their unique properties and heritages, Cheval Blanc and Belmond are ideally positioned to meet customers’ expectations for authentic luxury experiences,” he added.

A graduate of ISG Business School in Paris, Rinderknech began his career in 2002 with the American travel retail division of L’Oréal, accruing additional responsibilities when he took on positions in Japan and South Korea.

He moved to China in 2011, first as general manager of L’Oréal’s Luxe Division, then as head of the Consumer Products Division before being promoted to president and CEO of L’Oréal China for all divisions and corporate operations.

Rinderknech became a member of L’Oréal’s executive committee in 2018 and a year later assumed the management helm of L’Oréal USA.

Hailed as a rising star and viable candidate to be CEO of L’Oréal’s global operations one day, he was responsible for increasing the company’s China business by 30 percent during his time as CEO of that division. His strength in digital marketing — e-commerce accounted for 40 percent of L’Oréal’s sales in the country when he left — was a key driver behind his appointment in the U.S., where he was charged with accelerating L’Oréal’s digital transformation.

While LVMH is known for growing and grooming executive talent from within, it has recruited a number of high-profile L’Oréal executives in recent years, including Damien Bertrand, now CEO of Loro Piana, and Pierre-Emmanuel Angeloglou, strategic missions director for fashion and leather goods at Louis Vuitton.

LVMH-owned watchmaker Tag Heuer to accept crypto payments - Vogue Business,"Wed, 18 May 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZvZ3VlYnVzaW5lc3MuY29tL3RlY2hub2xvZ3kvbHZtaC1vd25lZC13YXRjaG1ha2VyLXRhZy1oZXVlci10by1hY2NlcHQtY3J5cHRvLXBheW1lbnRz0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"To receive the Vogue Business newsletter, sign up here.

LVMH-owned Swiss watchmaker Tag Heuer is jumping on cryptocurrencies by accepting 12 digital currencies on its US website from today.

When checking out online, customers can select “Bitpay” to be redirected to select a preferred crypto wallet or exchange and cryptocurrency. There is no minimum spend and a limit of up to $10,000 per transaction, the brand announced today. Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Dogecoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, Shiba Inu, Wrapped Bitcoin as well as five US dollar-pegged stablecoins will be accepted. More than 100 different crypto wallets and exchanges are currently supported, including Bitpay, Coinbase, Exodus Wallet and Ledger Wallet.

Read More Frédéric Arnault talks Tag Heuer, Web 3.0 and NFTs The CEO of Tag Heuer and son of LVMH chairman and CEO Bernard Arnault believes the watch brand can surpass €1 billion in annual sales.

The crypto market is not without its detractors: the lightning-fast crash of Terra stablecoin and its sister token Luna last week had a ripple effect on other assets. Bitcoin is down 33 per cent since the beginning of the year. The heavy currency swings is perhaps most relevant when considering returns. Tag Heuer issues the refund in US dollars and BitPay will convert the dollar amount to cryptocurrency, at the conversion rate applicable at the time of the refund. (Off-White, who also accepts crypto offers, returns in local currency. Gucci offers returns in the same cryptocurrency in which the item was purchased, but converts the value to reflect current value fluctuations.) Still, the watch industry has been an early supporter of crypto, keen to meet the spending power of newly wealthy crypto investors with a collector spirit.

“We have been following cryptocurrency developments very closely ever since Bitcoin first started trading. As an avant-garde watchmaker with an innovative spirit, we knew Tag Heuer would adopt what promises to be a globally integrated technology in the near future despite the fluctuations— one that will deeply transform our industry and beyond,” Tag Heuer chief executive Frédéric Arnault said in a statement. Arnault, son of billionaire LVMH chairman Bernard Arnault, is known for his embrace of Web3 and owns a collection of NFTs, including a Clone X PFP by Rtfkt (acquired by Nike) from a collaboration with Takashi Murakami and an Invisible Friends. He recently told Vogue Business he plans to build Tag Heuer into a €1 billion brand."

Previously working in materials purchasing and manufacturing at both Givenchy and Kenzo, he founded Paris-based resale platform Nona Source – alongside Marie Falguera and Anne Prieur du Perray – to connect these forgotten riches to a new generation of designers at a significant discount, supported by LVMH’s entrepreneurial programme, Dare. ‘This isn’t about profit, it’s about supporting creative communities,’ Brabo told Wallpaper* last year.

As of this month (May 2022), a new outpost of Nona Source opens in London’s King’s Cross neighbourhood, giving the city’s designers access to fabrics from LVMH maisons – from Louis Vuitton to Dior. Now supported by LVMH’s Life 360 programme (Life: LVMH Initiatives for the Environment), Nona Source’s library of fabrics will be available in a showroom at The Mills Fabrica, a membership-led workspace dedicated to sustainable innovation. London-based designers will be able to shop an array of fabrics – cotton poplin, silk, crêpe de Chine, Shetland wool and more – at more than two-thirds off their original price.

The arrival of Nona Source in London coincides with the platform’s first anniversary, marking ‘a major step forward in Nona Source’s commitment to develop circular creativity and creative reuse as well as supporting young and emerging designers, talent and brands’, as Brabo tells Wallpaper*. ‘There is a huge pool of young designers and creative talent here that push the boundaries in terms of creative fashion, which ultimately is what we want to champion through Nona Source.’ With the latter in mind, the showroom is located in close proximity to Central Saint Martins, providing those on its esteemed fashion courses access to some of the best fabrics currently available. Alexandre Capelli, LVMH’s environment deputy director, calls it ‘a concrete tool to inspire and support one of the most creative and sustainability-focused communities of designers’.

Nona Source already has plenty of fans in London: among them, designers Richard Malone, Sarah AlHamdan and Stella McCartney, each of whom has created a special design out of the platform’s fabrics that will be displayed in the showroom. ‘It’s no secret that the fashion industry has a huge waste issue; currently, less than one per cent of material used to produce clothing is recycled into new textiles,’ says McCartney. ‘ This is where Nona Source comes in, taking these incredible deadstock fabrics from the world’s leading fashion maisons – meaning they are accessible for all brands, new and old.’

From this week, creative professionals will be able to book private, hour-long appointments with a Nona Source expert via the company’s website, and choose from a colorful, textural rainbow of cotton velvets, faux fur, tweeds, plaid and checks from brands including Celine, Fendi and Louis Vuitton.

Designers will be able to choose from more than 1,000 fabrics which the cofounder of Nona Source, Romain Brabo, refers to as “sleeping beauties,” ready to be reawakened by young, emerging designers.

Nona Source acts as a broker, purchasing deadstock fabric from the fashion houses, and selling it at up to 70 percent off the original wholesale price.

The Nona team then works with customers on planning and purchasing, and advises designers on alternatives if quantities are low. Customers who can’t make it to the showroom can also scan a QR code online and see what quantities and colors are available.

The seed for Nona Source was planted in 2017 when Brabo, an expert in materials purchasing and manufacturing at the LVMH-owned Givenchy and Kenzo, took note of all the luxury fabrics sitting in brands’ warehouses.

He believed he could give them a new lease on life and teamed with LVMH colleagues Anne Prieur Du Perray and Marie Falguera, launching the company through DARE, LVMH’s “intrapreneurial” program, and an incubator for new ideas.

DARE enables all LVMH employees, across brands and regions, to propose and transform an idea into a solution. The trio subsequently built the Nona Source platform with the support from LVMH’s Environmental Development Direction.

Brabo said the brands quickly warmed to the idea of giving their old fabrics new life. He added that COVID-19 accelerated the need for brands to find solutions to excess stock and materials.

“In the past, these fabrics were taboo for the brands because it made them look as if they could not manage the extra resources. But every industry makes waste, so it’s just about managing what’s left over,” he said.

In the luxury business, Brabo said around 5 percent to 10 percent of fabrics are left over each season, mostly because suppliers dictate high minimums and orders end up being more than what the brands actually need. The situation is worse with fast fashion, he added, where 15 percent to 20 percent of fabrics are left behind in the warehouse.

There are around seven brands working with the platform now, and by the end of the year Brabo is expecting all of the fashion brands in the LVMH portfolio to join. Nona Source does not disclose the origin of the fabric to the end-buyer, although a trained eye would be able to discern a Fendi fabric from a Celine one.

London’s young designers are already big fans of Nona Source.

“The fabrics I have chosen have always been great, showing a high level of quality, and having the availability that is ideal for small businesses like mine,” said Bianca Saunders. “Fabrics can be sourced online easily with a quick and efficient turnaround time. It’s exciting that Nona Source will have a physical flagship here in the U.K., giving me the chance to view the fabrics in person.”

Richard Malone, whose business is mainly made-to-order and whose seasonal collections are small, said he loves sourcing “fabrics that already exist,” and that Nona Source allows him to make single pieces in exclusive colors, and to plan ranges around fabric that is available.

Nona Source, he said, also takes the pressure off designers like him who work in small quantities. They can buy exactly what they need instead of having to over-order and over-produce. Malone believes that sustainability in fashion is about reducing what is actually made, and he said Nona Source caters to that need.

While Nona Source has big growth ambitions, there are no plans to stock fabrics from outside LVMH, or expand outside Europe. By sticking to the LVMH brands’ fabrics, Brabo said Nona will be able to guarantee the quality, and also trace the fabrics’ journey.

The plan is to have more showrooms similar to the one in London, but they will be in Europe because Nona Source wants to avoid shipping fabrics via air. “Our DNA is local, and we don’t want to be sending fabrics on airplanes,” he said, adding that growth will come from developing “our offer and resources.”

Nona Source will expand its offer to include leather, trims, yarns, embroideries, and alternative materials such as metallics, plastic and wood.

While Nona Source is only available to professionals, Brabo said it also reserves stock for students and sells it to them at even cheaper prices.

The company is currently in discussions with Central Saint Martins about connecting its students with Nona Source. LVMH already has a series of partnerships with the fashion school, including the Maison/0 platform, which is dedicated to regenerative luxury.

Last month, LVMH announced a further partnership with Fendi, Imperial College London and Central Saint Martins, a two-year research project to develop new, lab-grown fur fibers for luxury fashion.

Eventually, Brabo also foresees Nona becoming a platform for the brands within LVMH to exchange resources.

Circularity is a key pillar of LVMH’s environmental strategy as expressed in the group’s LIFE 360 program. LIFE stands for LVMH Initiatives For the Environment.

Hélène Valade, LVMH Environmental Development director, said that by supporting London and U.K.-based creative community, “we aim to boost circularity and upcycling of our unused fabrics as we have done with the Parisian showroom for over a year now.”

Alexandre Capelli, LVMH Environment deputy director, said the “London Nona Source showroom will be a concrete tool to inspire and support one of the most creative and sustainability-focused communities of designers.”

Stella McCartney, whose business is part-owned by LVMH and who has been advising its managers on sustainability, described Nona Source as a “groundbreaking, circular platform that will revolutionize the fashion industry.” Her brand already uses it.

Nona Source’s choice of The Mills Fabrica as a partner was an important one.

Brabo said he shortlisted a few partners, but The Mills “shared the same values of sustainability, innovation, and supporting emerging talents and brands. On the human side, it was a good fit, too.”

The Mills Fabrica opened its London site last year, and hosts companies looking for regenerative solutions and sustainable innovations across fashion and agri-tech. It also invests in start-ups and student talent, and gives them space and resources to grow.

The Nona Source showroom is located on the ground floor of The Mills building, and its neighbors are fashion, home and food brands, all of which have sustainability at their core.

Businesses include Flax London, which makes heavy jackets out of discarded upholstery linen, and Bolt Threads, which makes Mylo fabric out of mycelium.

Another business makes hanging mushroom plants, powered by coffee grounds, cardboard and moss. Those mushroom pods hang near vertical beds of potted plants, including basil and kale, part of a “zero mile” farming project.

Upstairs, there are desks, offices and workspaces for the various entrepreneurs that The Mills Fabrica supports. All of the furniture in the building is recycled or upcycled, including tables and stools made from melted down CDs and garden furniture and the marble-like tabletops are created from old yogurt pots.

Nikita Jayasuriya, general manager of The Mills Fabrica, said the organization teamed with Nona Source because its “profound mission not only strongly aligns with ours around sustainability, but they are pioneering a new form of fashion that puts circular and no-waste ethics at the forefront of luxury and cutting-edge design. We are so proud to support Nona Source on their journey and to welcome them to our community.”

Nona Source is one of the more recent green initiatives from LVMH. The group has had a partnership with The Environmental Center for Eco-friendly Packaging Breakdown and Recycling for more than 10 years to encourage recycling within all of its Maisons. From a brand perspective, Loewe’s The Surplus project crafts bags exclusively with the excess leather from previous collections.

is set to leave , which he had joined in early 2020, but will continue to collaborate with the group as “strategy and development consultant to the management,” as LVMH announced in a brief note. The Italian senior executive and former boss of , who was notably in charge of the Hospitality Excellence division for the world’s number one luxury group, will be pursuing “new projects.”







Andrea Guerra - LVMH



At the end of 2020, exactly a year after joining the French giant to take charge of its hotel business, comprising the Cheval Blanc hotels and the Belmond and Orient Express hotels and trains, Guerra was assigned the additional remit of overseeing Italian luxury labels and Loro Piana. In May 2021, he was also tasked with overseeing the group’s eyewear manufacturer , joining its board of directors.



Guerra will step down from his roles at LVMH on May 31. The group said his successor will be appointed soon.

Guerra graduated from the University of Rome La , and began his career in 1989 in the hospitality sector, as marketing director at International. In 1994, he joined home appliances producer Merloni Elettrodomestici, later renamed Indesit, where he held various positions in the commercial, production and central administration departments, before becoming CEO in 2000.



Four years later, he took charge of the Luxottica group, where he remained until 2014, growing the eyewear group’s revenue by just shy of €3 billion, to €7 billion.



After a one-year stint in politics, as adviser to then Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi, Guerra returned to the business world as executive chairman of Eataly, the Italian fine foods and cuisine group. A position he left in autumn 2019 to join LVMH, to whose executive committee he was appointed in 2020.



The split between Guerra and LVMH is consensual, according to both parties. “I am delighted that the group and I will still be able to benefit from Andrea's advice, as he will now continue to collaborate as a consultant,” said LVMH’s CEO . “The group’s culture of success, established through the prism of excellence, has deeply inspired me,” said Guerra, adding that “the last two years have been especially intense. I now wish to pursue other entrepreneurial projects.”



Guerra is set to return to Italy where, according to sources cited by the local media, he will focus on a major new venture. Either as an investor, setting up an investment fund in which it is rumoured Bernard Arnault might join in, or by taking the helm of a luxury label and an investment fund."

LVMH company Onboard Media promotes Alaskan brands with Carnival Cruise Lines - The Moodie Davitt Report,"Tue, 24 May 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vbW9vZGllZGF2aXR0cmVwb3J0LmNvbS9sdm1oLWNvbXBhbnktb25ib2FyZC1tZWRpYS1wcm9tb3Rlcy1hbGFza2FuLWJyYW5kcy13aXRoLWNhcm5pdmFsLWNydWlzZS1saW5lcy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"US. Onboard Media has partnered with the Alaska Small Business Development Centre (SBDC) and its BuyAlaska programme to showcase homegrown brands onboard all Carnival Cruise Lines sailing through Alaska this season.

Onboard Media, the LVMH-owned sales and marketing agency, is showcasing a diverse group of locally-owned Alaskan businesses through bespoke BuyAlaska Directory port guides and shopping materials. The guides are given to cruise guests during their voyage.

The BuyAlaska Directory are delivered to cruise passengers at every port. The guide is accessible via QR code and highlights different locally-owned businesses in every port of call.

The business directory comprises over 800 companies. It is part of a state-wide network supporting Alaskan small businesses. The directory’s goal is to showcase homegrown Alaskan brands and products to the state’s over one million annual visitors.

Onboard Media General Manager Jeffrey Meister commented, “We are thrilled to be the first media company to partner with the SBDC on this important initiative to promote small businesses from the ports visited, as well as align with our partner Carnival Cruise Line’s mission to support the local communities visited as part of the cruise itinerary.”

Carnival Cruise Line Head of Retail Andres Villalever added, “The partnership that Onboard Media developed with the SBDC very much aligns with Carnival’s values of supporting the local communities our ships visit as well as offering our guests a wonderful opportunity to bring home a truly unique item from their vacation.”

Onboard Media has also partnered with Made in Alaska and Silver Hand in showcasing brands and products that were made by the local and native artisans of Alaska.

The Silver Hand Seal proudly shows that the products were created by hand. The seal can only be attached to an original work produced in the state of Alaska by a full-time resident or member of a native Alaskan tribe.

“We are excited about the opportunity to partner with Onboard Media and Carnival Cruise Line to educate visitors on the importance of authentic Alaska,” commented Made in Alaska Programme Manager Grace Beaujean. “We believe this will contribute to an outstanding guest experience and enable them to identify true Alaska keepsakes.”

Alaska State Council on the Arts Executive Director Andrea Noble added, “Being able to clearly and easily identify authentic Alaska Native arts and crafts is good for the artist and the cruise guest who is buying work that’s unique to Alaska, so we’re thrilled to be a part of this important initiative,”

The Alaska Small Business Development Centre is a state-wide programme that provides resources, advice and assistance to help small businesses grow. It is hosted by the University of Alaska Anchorage through the Business Enterprise Institute.

Commenting on the initiative, Alaska Small Business Development Center (SBDC) Executive Director Jon Brittner said: “With Alaska not having received cruise guests since 2019, it was so important to support local port towns and small businesses, aiding in their economic recovery. With this Onboard Media partnership, we can provide exponentially higher exposure for our members’ businesses and expedite their recovery.”"
Should Luxury Brands Actually Reduce Their Dependence on China? - Jing Daily,"Tue, 24 May 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vamluZ2RhaWx5LmNvbS9wb3N0cy9zaG91bGQtbHV4dXJ5LWJyYW5kcy1hY3R1YWxseS1yZWR1Y2UtdGhlaXItZGVwZW5kZW5jZS1vbi1jaGluYdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"With earnings reports from luxury brands like Gucci and Burberry showing the strain from China’s most recent COVID-19 lockdowns, some industry observers are dusting off an old pre-COVID question: are luxury brands too dependent on the China market?

According to one LVMH board member, Hubert Védrine, they are. In a recent interview with the blog Miss Tweed, Védrine opined that luxury brands should reduce their dependence on the China market as much as possible, saying, “For those luxury brands who can, it would be prudent, even if it is difficult, to avoid increasing their exposure to China and even reduce it.”

A quick look at the current state of the luxury market indicates where Védrine is coming from. As luxury brands struggled with extended lockdowns and COVID restrictions in Europe, North America, and Japan, China reopened malls in spring 2020, with the ensuing revenge spending boom encouraging many brands to open new stores and redouble on- and offline China efforts. Largely unable to travel abroad to make luxury purchases, Chinese consumers spent far more at local luxury boutiques. According to Bain & Company, domestic sales of personal luxury goods in China jumped 48 percent in 2020 and 36 percent in 2021, totaling nearly 471 billion yuan ($70.7 billion), a near doubling in just two years.

This domestic luxury revival left brands little choice but to intensify their focus on an even more important China market. According to a recent report on the global luxury retail market by Savills, China was the only market to increase its share of new openings in 2021, although the report also noted an uptick in luxury retail openings in North America late last year.

Over the past two years, China has been a hotbed of luxury activity, with the likes of Burberry and Prada experimenting with “new retail” concepts and intensifying social commerce efforts on platforms like Douyin and Bilibili. Meanwhile, with Chinese tourist-shoppers prevented from making their usual pilgrimages to duty-free shops in Hong Kong or South Korea, brands shifted their duty-free efforts towards Hainan, which recorded a more than 120 percent year-on-year increase in duty-free sales in 2020 and an 83 percent increase last year.

Luxury’s 2020-2022 China pivot makes the country’s Omicron lockdowns and insistence on a “Zero COVID ” strategy hit even harder, with Burberry’s China sales dipping 13 percent in the final quarter and Richemont Chairman Johann Rupert dampening hopes of a sharp rebound in the months ahead. But rather than indicating luxury brands should reduce their dependence on the China market, recent struggles indicate a need to retool efforts for more global Chinese luxury consumption.

While outbound Chinese tourism is still a long way from returning to pre-COVID levels, new projections by the China Outbound Tourism Research Institute predict “a strong wave” of outbound travel to kick off next year and get back to 2019 numbers in 2024. This would be a welcome development for luxury brands that have seen Chinese tourist arrivals (and spending) dry up at key European or North American flagships over the past two years. After reaching a peak of 170 million border crossings in 2019, Chinese outbound tourism crashed to just 18 million crossings in 2020 and a meager 8.5 million in 2021.

Chinese outbound tourism has plummeted over the past two years. Image: Shutterstock

For luxury brands, taking the current COVID-impacted softness in mainland China as a cue to reduce exposure to the market is the wrong approach. The greater focus on improving the retail experience and enhancing digitalization efforts over the past two years has been a net positive for luxury brands. Despite recent COVID-fueled struggles, Burberry recorded a 37 percent increase in mainland China comparable-store sales last year, while LVMH noted a “strong rebound ” in China in 2021 and the country was key to Gucci’s 29.5 percent year-on-year growth in the Asia-Pacific region.

Even if China's upcoming “re-reopening” fails to spur another luxury spending boom, the brands that invested in improving the customer experience and the convenience of online sales – rather than those that cut back on their China exposure – stand to benefit the most. As the likes of Louis Vuitton and Gucci have long shown, placing importance on the China market does not necessarily mean neglecting other key geographies, and in many cases, China can function as a valuable test-bed for new marketing and sales concepts ahead of their global rollouts."

She manages all domestic and international employment matters and general litigation for the company in the Americas and also serves as senior employment counsel for Berluti, a subsidiary of LVMH. She is a member of the Luxury Law Alliance advisory board

In your current role at Louis Vuitton, you manage labour and employment matters for the Americas region. Were you always interested in this practice area?

My path to law was not a linear one. From a young age, I always thought I was going to be a dermatologist. But in college, I did an internship at a local hospital and realised that not only did I not like the setting but that I am something of a germ-a-phobe. My aunt suggested that I might like law and I worked a summer job at a law firm in college. That led me to Villanova University School of Law and from the first day, I loved it. During law school, I worked as an intern at Morgan Lewis for one semester and assisted with some labour and employment matters and I knew immediately that was the area for me.

In the United States, there are only a handful of federal statutes that govern all labour and employment matters. But there is such great variety and so many human elements in these laws. Just think about the importance of laws protecting against discrimination in employment based on sexual orientation or providing maternity and paternity leave. Work is such a large part of our lives that I enjoy practicing in an area that makes a difference for all of us.

How did you come to work at Louis Vuitton?

I always had an interest in fashion and wanted to find a way to relate that to practicing law. Villanova law school is in the Philadelphia area and there are only a handful of fashion companies there; most are based in New York. One day during law school, I cold called Barbara Kolsun – who many of us in the Luxury Law Alliance know as a fashion law professor at Benjamin Cardozo School of Law. At the time, she was general counsel of Kate Spade. Barbara took my call. She is a remarkable person. We kept in touch and she offered me an externship position when she became general counsel of 7 For All Mankind. I travelled one day a week from Philadelphia to New York.

After the externship, I wanted to go in-house right away but Barbara gave me some very valuable advice. She said that I had to get broad legal experience because in-house doesn’t have the time to provide that training. She also told me that I wouldn’t be successful in-house unless I was passionate about my practice area and knew it inside and out.

Did you take Barbara’s advice?

Yes, I did. I practiced labour and employment law at three law firms – Obermayer Rebmann Maxwell & Hippel, Cozen O’Connor, and Littler Mendelson. While at Obermayer I created a blog called HRLegalist, an online resource on the latest developments and trends in labour and employment that also has analysis and commentary regarding best practices for employers. I tried to gear the blog toward fashion and retail as much as I could. Every time I wrote on these topics, I would send the piece to Barbara. She sent one of the articles to a contact of hers at LVMH, who said they were hiring an employment counsel. Barbara put me in touch. I interviewed for the position, made it to the final round but ultimately did not get it. They told me that if something else opened up they would be in touch. Seven months later, I received a call that there was an opening for an employment counsel at an LVMH subsidiary, Louis Vuitton. I successfully interviewed for the position and started my job in 2014 at Louis Vuitton.

Barbara has been a mentor not only to me but countless others. She is responsible for launching many careers in the fashion industry, including mine. Her influence in this industry is remarkable.

Earlier this year, you began a position as a fashion law professor at Villanova law school. Did Barbara have anything to do with that?

Yes, I truly believe her mentorship is the reason I was offered that role. Barbara made an introduction for me to the then fashion law professor at Villanova law school who has since retired and she also asked me to write the employment chapter in her fashion law textbook, The Business and Law of Fashion and Retail (Carolina Academic Press, 2020) – it’s the book that every fashion law class uses.

Because of all Barbara has done for me, I am very focused on paying it forward. For example, I oversee the Louis Vuitton Legal Externship Program and try to be available and helpful to the next generation of fashion lawyers. Being a fashion law professor allows me another opportunity to be a mentor and guide to students, just as Barbara has been to me. Teaching and mentoring holds a special place in my heart.

What is it like to work in the fashion industry?

It’s my dream job. I have the gift of working with people who are creative and passionate about what they do, and that makes for an incredible working environment. Not only do I practice law at Louis Vuitton but I am often involved in business decisions at the company. I especially enjoy being part of different projects and seeing them to fruition. It is particularly exciting to be involved in the implementation of various policies at the company and seeing the positive impact they have on employees’ professional and personal lives. Working for a company like Louis Vuitton means I get to work in a very creative environment that sets trends in the marketplace and is always one step ahead.

What are some of your interests outside of work?

I am very interested in fashion and my work doesn’t feel like work because I enjoy it so much. But I do love to cook, I love to run and I also love to travel and experience different cultures.

Louis Vuitton makes so many beautiful things. Do you have any favourites?

The Capucine is my favorite go-to-style of handbag. On my wish list, I would love to purchase one of the Louis Vuitton trunks. There is something very special about vintage items like those.

The fashion industry’s commitment to sustainability has never been made more clear. intends to offer its customers a transparent supply chain for 100% of its products within three years. This strategy is in line with its objective to have at least 60% of its products made with at least half of more environmentally friendly materials. To help it achieve their goal of transparency, the brand as well as the entire group which generates more than one billion euros in sales, has entrusted the French start-up, Fairly Made.







Camille Le Gal and Laure Betsch, co-founders of Fairly Made - DR



This challenge does not seem to intimidate the young, fast-growing company. It has recently expanded its premises in Paris’ sustainable fashion hub, La Caserne, in the city’s 10th district, and additionally works with six -owned brands. Whether they are contemporary fashion brands, luxury giants or independent labels, Fairly Made, founded by Laure Betsch and Camille Le Gal in 2018, promises to provide a methodology to its roster of clients.



The start-up was created to support brands in their buying habits and to help them evolve environmentally and socially. The founders have had work experience in the buying departments of large companies such as , , and which allowed them to identify the needs of brands prior to embarking on their entrepreneurial adventure.

However, in 2018, environmental issues were only emerging and were not yet taken seriously by the fashion industry. In their early days, Betsch and Le Gal had to spread the word, and this was first done through capsule collections made with a more sustainable approach for fashion and textile industry players. The start-up has the contacts and flexibility to operate quickly and with limited quantities, which notably allowed a brand like Des Petits Hauts to take its first steps towards more responsible sourcing in 2019.





'These transparency issues will become the standard'





""Our mission was to improve the social and environmental impact of the textile industry, to bring about change. The capsules were ideal for this because they allowed for rapid implementation,"" explained Le Gal. “Now, we are working in depth, with the aim of eventually changing 100% of the collections. These transparency issues will become a standard. New emerging brands must have this issue ingrained in their DNA, and those that are established have a lot of catching up to do.""



Fairly Made provides brands with a solution that enables them to trace their entire value chain and evaluate the quality of each of its products according to five criteria: environmental, social, traceability, recyclability and sustainability.







The platform transcribes these results on the product labels via a QR code - Fairly Made



""With eco-certified capsule collections, brands needed concrete solutions and we provided them with certified factories and materials. The brands then asked us to help them with the rest of their supplier base. Suppliers were coming up with suggestions for labels and certifications, but brands didn’t know how to position themselves on these issues. We had the expertise to analyze suppliers and the impact of products. And we positioned ourselves as a trusted third party,"" said the co-founder.



Fairly Made developed its own platform in partnership with DNVB Asphalte and women's fashion brand Des Petits Hauts. Two industry players with different profiles that have allowed Fairly Made to test its technological solution and its versatility according to the brands' business models.



The solution allows them to collect information on the supplier base and to then start collecting information from these partners.



“On an initial data collection, we centralize all the information that the brands have,"" explained Betsch.



Some have an ERP (enterprise resource planning) system that has already compiled certain data, others do not. Usually, it's a true driver in understanding how the brands work and where their pressure points are. often, they know the tier 1 plant. But then it's an exploration. It's a co-management with the suppliers, because it requires extra work for the suppliers to gather the information. Our statistics tell us that we know 70% more of the supplier base from the second data collection. The brands are at the bottom of the pyramid, which allows them to identify the biggest impacts along the chain and to direct their attention to them. Often we deal with repeat business because it's the highest volume and the suppliers where there are the biggest orders.""



The company, which explains that it carries out a diagnostic analysis in less than two months, emphasizes a SaaS solution that is accessible to companies via a monthly subscription so that they can directly understand their data, transformation plan and performance. This solution now accounts for 70% of the company's turnover and it intends to expand its customer portfolio, which currently includes around 50 companies in France and Europe such as M.Moustache, Patou, Balzac, , and .





Fighting against greenwashing and tightening regulations





There appears to be significant potential for growth. While the workload is cumbersome, increasingly more brands see it as a necessary component for their business for two reasons. Firstly, because customers demand to know this information and are wary of greenwashing and secondly, because legislation and regulations are being put in place concerning these matters.



Traceability on four links of the supply chain is becoming mandatory in France, as is environmental labelling, which is expected to be implemented this year. In Europe, regulations must be coordinated to evaluate the environmental footprint of products and communicate it to customers.



Finally, the textile manufacturer will have to ensure their products’ end-of-life. Brands and distributors faced with this obligation must review their production methods and be fully aware of their material sourcing in order to effectively manage the end-of-life of their products.



“The Covid pandemic has been a catalyst for awareness,"" said Le Gal. It was a motivating factor indeed. Before, CSR managers were a bit lonely. Now we see that human and financial resources have multiplied. Our role is to make them aware of what is going to happen at the regulatory level. But we are not alarmed because there is good news and France is ahead of the curve on these issues.""



In addition to its platform, the company offers tools whereby brands can detail the origin of their products via QR codes on labels or widgets. These tools are of interest to brands to develop their potential and the life of their products on the second hand market.



With a roster of international clients, Fairly Made faces the challenge of rapid growth and the need to recruit developers, textile and materials engineers and new employees. From a dozen people last year, the company is expected to grow to around thirty employees by the end of 2022, with a turnover of several million euros.



After a first financing round last year, the founders are currently preparing a second round of about three million euros this summer to help support the start-up’s expansion. This contribution should also permit the Fairly Made methodology to multiply. The company has expanded from textiles to leather and metalwork and has its sights set on woodwork."

But what can be found on board the pleasure craft of the Louis Vuitton boss himself, Bernard Arnault? There’s no room for anything ordinary or simple inside this hidden gem.

Last year, he was the world’s richest man, surpassing Jeff Bezos. Currently, he’s only number three on the world’s top billionaires list, but he’s still number one in France and even Europe. Bernard Arnault’s name may not be as immensely popular as Bezos or Elon Musk, but the brands under the LVHM (Moet Hennessey Louis Vuitton) group are more than famous.LVMH is the world’s largest luxury conglomerate, and is incredibly diverse, with 70 fashion and cosmetics brands alone. Their common denominator is sheer opulence. In 2021, the group also acquired the famous Tiffany & Co, reportedly for $15.8 billion, scoring the biggest luxury brand acquisition ever made. His father built the foundation, and Arnault turned it into the incredibly successful and powerful empire we know today.We’ve said it before - when it comes to superyachts and billionaires, you can’t have one without the other. It’s no surprise that Arnault owns a spectacular $150 million floating mansion. Although its details remain elusive, because this custom beauty hasn’t revealed itself to anyone besides its owner and his private entourage, enough is known about Symphony to beguile and make our jaws drop.With a massive 333-foot (101.5 meters) silhouette, the 2015 Symphony was the largest model built by Feadship at that time. It was also the brand’s first vessel to comply with the new Passenger Yacht Code regulations, which allowed more than 12 passengers onboard. The beautiful yacht with a dark blue steel hull and bright white aluminum superstructure went on to win the World Superyacht Award 2016 for best displacement motor yacht, in the 2,999 GT and above category.This choice wasn’t accidental. A few years prior, in 2008, LVMH purchased Royal van Lent, the Dutch builder of luxury yachts, under the Feadship brand. A logical step for the group’s expansion strategy, this acquisition, estimated at a minimum of $300 million, added a builder known for having an “ultra-exclusive clientele.” And it wasn’t the only one in the LVMH portfolio, as the group had bought the British Princess Yachts International that same year.Big names were responsible for the look of the Symphony, unfolding across six decks. Tim Heywood created the exterior, while Francois Zuretti and Peter Marino envisioned the interiors inspired by exotic residences in Bali, to which African influences were added to recreate a floating “summer house at the sea.”Calling it a floating exclusive neighborhood wood be more appropriate since everything you could possibly need is included. You can pamper yourself at the state-of-the-art spa, work out at the gym, relax at the beauty parlor, or enjoy the spectacular 19.5-foot (6 meters) contra-flow swimming pool with its own waterfall. Below its glass bottom, you can spot a generous lounge area. That’s also where you’ll find an ultra-high-definition cinema, for movie nights in grand style.There’s also a second cinema, an outdoor one, on the bridge deck. Another favorite area would probably be the sun deck, with its generous jacuzzi, bar, and an observation lounge. You can even play golf on this floating neighborhood’s mini-golf field and enjoy gourmet dinners al-fresco, at the table on the aft deck that’s large enough for 20 people. When the sun sets, this area magically transforms into a high-class nightclub.You might think that a lot of superyachts boast similar amenities. It’s true, but the Symphony goes even further. According to automation expert Henri , which participated in the yacht’s building process, its interiors were the most elaborate ever seen on a superyacht at that time, boasting 300 different finishes.The exquisite attention to detail is obvious when looking at the truly unique elevator shaft, with an interactive video wall representing a stunning virtual aquarium. The wall is 49-foot-tall (15 meters) comprised of 25 screens. Even the engine room is a work of art. There’s an elegant corridor from the movie theater to the beach club, giving guests a glimpse of the engines, through large glass walls, illuminated by blue LEDs.These powerful MTU engines, four in total, allow the Symphony to cruise at 16 knots (18.4 mph/29.6 kph), for up to 5,500 nautical miles (6,300 miles/10,000 km).Built with eight staterooms for up to 16 guests, the Symphony dazzles with an owner’s suite that’s equal to a luxury apartment. It includes double bathrooms, dressing rooms, a private study, a sauna, and access to its own terrace with a jacuzzi. A large crew can also be accommodated to cater to the guests’ every desire.Sophisticated and mysterious, the Symphony seems worthy of a luxury empire king. It hasn’t revealed its most intimate secrets, but it’s safe to say that it could compete with younger billionaires’ toys, including Jeff Bezos’ infamous megayacht."
"After marketing blitz, Tiffany's upgrade pivots to stores - Vogue Business","Tue, 31 May 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZvZ3VlYnVzaW5lc3MuY29tL2NvbnN1bWVycy9hZnRlci1tYXJrZXRpbmctYmxpdHotdGlmZmFueXMtdXBncmFkZS1waXZvdHMtdG8tc3RvcmVz0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"To receive the Vogue Business newsletter, sign up here.

First came the celebrity-powered advertising campaigns, playful TiffCoin, a new gold-focused Tiffany Knot collection, plus renewed ambitions for high-jewellery. Now, Tiffany & Co has unveiled an experiential year-long pop-up store in Paris amid its global repositioning under LVMH.

The pop-up on 34 Avenue Montaigne, Paris’s luxury thoroughfare, located next to the new Dior flagship (in the former space occupied by Dior jewellery that merged into the new Dior flagship) will be open until May 2023 and will change themes several times throughout the year, kicking off with “Paris in love” theme.

The depth of the archive is core here: an 1889 bonbonnière (small decorative box), a Jean Schlumberger brooch from the 1960s, and the original catalogue from the French Crown Jewels auction, which Charles Lewis Tiffany purchased a significant portion of in 1887. These are accompanied by new items such as a €64,000 HardWear semi pavé necklace and a €290,000 heart-shaped diamond brooch.

Historic pieces are also displayed (not for sale) alongside the iconic collections in the 80-square-metre pop-up, decorated with gold and blue in partnership with architectural firm The Office for Metropolitan Architecture (OMA), co-founded by Rem Koolhaas. It will also feature stained-glass lamps by Louis Comfort Tiffany, son of the house founder Charles Lewis Tiffany.

The opening, albeit temporary and in a small format, is just one in a 300-strong store portfolio that analysts suggest needs a significant repositioning to align with LVMH’s planned upscale. Since Tiffany was acquired by the luxury conglomerate for $15.8 billion in October 2020, and the appointment of a new management, including seasoned executive Anthony Ledru and Alexandre Arnault, son of LVMH chairman and CEO Bernard Arnault, the American jeweller has been focused on shaking off its positioning in silver to compete against high-end jewellers like Cartier. Early results show it is working, particularly in the US. Chris Hollis, LVMH director of financial communication, told investors during the recent first-quarter earnings call that Tiffany’s performance was “excellent” and the US was “the strongest contributor”."
Web3 is still elusive. Web2.5 may be a safer option - Vogue Business,"Mon, 23 May 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZvZ3VlYnVzaW5lc3MuY29tL3RlY2hub2xvZ3kvd2ViMy1pcy1zdGlsbC1lbHVzaXZlLXdlYjI1LW1heS1iZS1hLXNhZmVyLW9wdGlvbtIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"To become a Vogue Business Member and receive the Technology Edit newsletter, click here.

Are luxury brands embracing Web3 technologies too early? While NFTs and crypto currencies are being explored and metaverse and Web3 strategies developed, there’s a concern that the luxury fashion and beauty sector may be moving too fast.

Recent dips in the crypto market are causing jitters, while consumers are showing resistance to the appeal of a rapidly oversaturated NFT market. And the metaverse is still in its infancy — experts warn it will take years before we experience a decentralised ‘metaverse’.

Read More Why Brand.eth is the new brand.com Public Ethereum wallet names are similar to email addresses and Instagram handles. As brands approach Web 3.0, they should be thinking about owning their presence in the metaverse.

Enter Web2.5, a new term — and solution — being discreetly shared among executives facing pressure to flip the switch from Web2 to Web3.

Web2.5 describes the reality of a transition period, according to Serotonin, a digital marketing agency that has worked with Adidas and Sotheby’s to develop metaverse and Web3 strategies. “Brands are still trying to figure out [Web3], and some of them feel uncomfortable with that feeling of not knowing,” says Claire Jencks, content manager at Serotonin. “But the brands that are pushing into this space are a bit more open with experimenting.”

To relieve potential concerns about the decentralised, community-driven dream that is Web3, Serotonin has published a comprehensive report today that outlines how creative and media industries, along with consumer goods and food sectors, are expanding existing capabilities with success.

The report considers recent projects from Gucci Vault, DressX and Nike. In December, Nike acquired Rtfkt, whose digital assets “redefine the boundaries of physical and digital value”, according to the report.

Connecting Web3 assets such as NFTs to physical goods is a prime example of Web2.5, says Everett Muzzy, Serotonin VP of content. “The number of times that Nike has slightly rebranded itself or its audiences just proves how agile a company it is. It is not not only accessing but bringing in an entire Web3 audience. It did that very intelligently through something like Rtfkt, which had grown natively in a very committed and very engaged Web3 native audience.”

Web2.5 is a step on the way to Web3. Coinbase is an example, says Muzzy; it’s a cryptocurrency exchange that enables people to exchange Web3 assets using Web2 infrastructure such as credit cards and fiat currency. It’s this combination of using Web3 assets with Web2 infrastructure that defines Web2.5, he adds.

Best of Web2 and Web3?

Web2 shouldn’t be dropped, says Muzzy. “Web2 has been powerful for audience growth and retention. Web2 companies can’t abandon their Twitter followers and email distributions or any of the ways they currently engage and interact with their customers — and I don’t think it would be prudent of them to consider that,” he says. “For Web3, we’re not asking brands to abandon their audiences. It's a brand new way to engage with those existing audiences.”"
This LVMH semi-finalist moonlights as a head chef at a Sri Lankan restaurant in Berlin - VOGUE India,"Fri, 20 May 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZvZ3VlLmluL2Zhc2hpb24vY29udGVudC90aGlzLWx2bWgtc2VtaS1maW5hbGlzdC1tb29ubGlnaHRzLWFzLWEtaGVhZC1jaGVmLWF0LWEtc3JpLWxhbmthbi1yZXN0YXVyYW50LWluLWJlcmxpbtIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Berlin-based Sri Lankan designer Amesh Wijesekera is pushing the boundaries of creativity. A self-taught chef, he took over the kitchens of popular restaurant Sathutu in Berlin's Rykestraße district, a few years ago. The designer by day and head chef by night now works two jobs, both exciting in nature and dynamic by profession. Inspired by childhood flavours and his mother's spice mixes, curry sauces and grandmother's home made pineapple chutneys, the multitasking designer says he is bringing contemporary Sri Lankan cooking to a German crowd.

Inspired by the bistros of Colombo and Galle, the restaurant ‘Sathutu,’ which means ‘happiness’ in Sinhalese, harbours the tastes of Sri Lanka to the urban synagogue of Berlin. Its delightful menu, curated with a contemporary ingredient led approach, fosters the best of Sri Lankan cuisine on a plate. A self taught chef–the LVMH Prize nominated designer, chanced upon this opportunity as he pursued his design career living in Berlin through a mutual friend online. Much like his designs, Wijesekera’s cooking recalls home at every juncture. Recipes borrowed from his grandmother’s kitchen are tweaked to add an inventive touch of contemporary Sri Lankan cooking to the menu. The shortbread, pineapple chutneys, flavoursome yoghurt with tropical components such as jackfruit, tamarind and coconut amongst others are only a snippet of the many eateries that are served by him through the year.

Chef by the day and designer by night, Wijesekera has been juggling his roles with a proficiency that only a few could pull off. As his homeland suffers through a devastating economic crackdown, Wijesekera reflects on the strength of his community and pays homage through his latest collection— Paddy Field Play. “This is my ode to the joy and optimism my home country has always provided me. As Sri Lanka faces its most severe political and economical crisis what is resoundingly clear is the boundless creativity of Sri Lankans from all walks of life, even as we take to peaceful protesting on foot. The youth are coming together to express emotions of love, frustrations and uncertainty. A sense of community is rebuilding and healing, laying a step towards creating a more inclusive and tolerant space. Challenging and subverting traditional ideas, a new way of “Sri Lankness” is creating a space for individuality, identity and freedom of expression. A movement of resilience and optimism is ready to be celebrated in this resplendent island I call home,” he writes."
