Hermès Sells Gaultier Fashion House Stake to Puig - The New York Times,"Tue, 03 May 2011 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMTEvMDUvMDQvYnVzaW5lc3MvZ2xvYmFsLzA0aWh0LWZhc2hpb24wNC5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Mr. Gaultier, who had owned 55 percent of his fashion house, is selling a 15 percent stake to Puig. “It gives me a lot of joy,” he said. “I am not interested in management. I love clothes and I will have the freedom to concentrate on that.”

Marc Puig, chairman and chief executive of Puig, based in Barcelona, said in a statement that his company was “very proud to take over from Hermès and continue the development” of “a brand with such great creativity.”

The Spanish company supports the fashion houses of Nina Ricci, Carolina Herrera and Paco Rabanne and creates fragrances for Comme des Garçons, Prada and the actor Antonio Banderas. The company is growing and eager to raise its profile beyond Europe, where it does more than half of its business.

Hermès is repositioning itself after the unwelcome intrusion into its capital by LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, the luxury conglomerate run by Bernard Arnault. LVMH now holds more than 20 percent of the equity in Hermès, though the ownership structure of the family-controlled luxury company gives Hermès effective control of its destiny for now.

Mr. Gaultier’s cheeky fragrances, including some in bottles shaped like a woman’s body, have been a long-term financial success, making the brand attractive to Puig despite weaknesses elsewhere in the Gaultier lineup. The haute couture line, founded in 1997, just breaks even, although it has a regular clientele. Mr. Gaultier said high-end fashion would be continued in the new deal.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9983929991722107}",neutral,0.9983929991722107,0
District is for and by design - Sarasota Herald-Tribune,"Sun, 29 May 2011 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhlcmFsZHRyaWJ1bmUuY29tL3N0b3J5L25ld3MvMjAxMS8wNS8yOS9kaXN0cmljdC1pcy1mb3ItYW5kLWJ5LWRlc2lnbi8yOTAyMDM5ODAwNy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"District is for and by design

Over 17 years, developer Craig Robins has nearly single-handedly turned the once-derelict Design District into a trendy destination for high-end home furnishings, art and dining. The missing piece has been the pedestrian traffic needed to create an energetic, 24-hour urban area.

That's about to change, as Robins launches a repositioning of the area to bring in a new mix of luxury international fashion retailers, boutique hotels and loft apartments. It's all about creating Miami's version of a hip neighborhood akin to New York City's SoHo or Meat Packing District.

A bold move like this isn't cheap. Robins is on a buying spree: $40 million so far this year to acquire 10 more properties. His burgeoning portfolio includes 60 percent of the entire neighborhood and the vast majority of the central core between Northeast First and Second avenues.

""By having us own so much contiguous property, the neighborhood is protected from becoming over-commercialized,"" said Robins, whose company Dacra was also an early South Beach developer.

""We want to build a beautiful neighborhood with diverse architectural structures and businesses, all designed with a strong sense of community and a unique sense of place. We believe if you combine fashion, art and design, everyone's sales will go up.""

When the last deals close within the next 60 days, Robins' will own 26 properties in the Design District, representing 700,000 square feet of mixed-use commercial property and 20 acres.

Existing Design District tenants are excited. It's why shoe designer Christian Louboutin, one of the first luxury retailers, opened a store in late 2009.

The owner of Luminaire, the contemporary home furnishings retailer that was one of the area's first tenants, recently agreed to double the size of its space.

""We're still a little bit of a cult area,"" said David Wichner, boutique manager for Louboutin, which has seen its sales steadily increase as customers discover the destination location.

Robins' plans for the Design District got an instant credibility boost in March when Louis Vuitton announced plans to open a store in the area by 2014.

Robins' goal: bring in 20 to 30 luxury retailers over the next five years. He's targeting the industry's biggest names including Cartier, Prada, Chanel, Gucci, Armani, Hermes and all the LVMH brands from Dior to De Beers.

Already the news of the luxury fashion arrivals is having an impact on the market's real estate.

While Robins paid an average of about $300 per square foot of space, some recent prices have more than doubled, local brokers said.

""There's certainly been a jump in values since the speculation of a deal with LVMH and Craig Robins,"" said Tony Cho, president and chief executive of Metro 1 Properties, which specializes in real estate in the Design District.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9958662986755371}",neutral,0.9958662986755371,0
