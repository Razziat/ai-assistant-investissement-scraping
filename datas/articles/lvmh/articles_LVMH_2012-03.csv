Anna Wintour Likens Andrew Rosen to America's Version of LVMH - The Cut,"Thu, 29 Mar 2012 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWN1dC5jb20vMjAxMi8wMy9hbmRyZXctcm9zZW4tcHJvZW56YS1zY2hvdWxlci1yYWctYm9uZS10aGVvcnktYW5uYS13aW50b3VyLmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Andrew Rosen, photographed by Tina Barney for WSJ.

We can probably all agree that mogul is an overused word, particularly in the fashion industry. But when it comes to Andrew Rosen, who owns major stakes in several of New York’s most popular and cutting-edge clothing labels — Proenza Schouler, rag & bone, Theory, and Helmut Lang — the title is quite apt. In WSJ. Magazine’s profile of Rosen, which appears in the forthcoming April “Men’s Style” issue, a bunch of his peers and protégés gush about how lovely he is (as beneficiaries of his investments are obviously wont to do, but for what it’s worth, he sounds like a genuinely pleasant and extremely smart guy). There’s also the requisite discussion of his passion for breeding racehorses and his family history in the garment district (his father, Carl Rosen, ran a huge dressmaking company called Puritan Fashions, which Andrew sold after his father died in 1982). But far more interesting are anecdotes like this one, from Alice + Olivia’s Stacey Bendet:

“He said, ‘I want to be your partner,’ and I was 24, and I’m like, ‘Um, I’m just making my fun pants,’” says Bendet. She and Rosen talk every morning now. “He’s never tried to change anything I’ve done — he just makes it more efficient. He’s on his way to the acupuncturist, and it’s like — boom! — ‘Stacey, I passed this store on 65th and Madison and it’s perfect for Alice + Olivia!’ And I’m like, ‘Andrew, I’m having a C-section at the moment,’ and he says, ‘Oh, don’t worry, we can get it opened by the end of the month.’”

Meanwhile, Anna Wintour offers this high praise:

We don’t have a Gucci or LVMH in this country … but in his own way, Andrew is creating a kind of American equivalent.

And of course, because moguls often hang out with each other, J.Crew CEO Mickey Drexler is one of Rosen’s best friends. Says Drexler:

When I visualize a garmento, I think of a guy with a bad combover, but it’s also a term of honor … Andrew’s father was a legend when I was a young department store buyer. My father bought buttons and piece goods. There’s not many of us left with that good garmento DNA. Andrew’s one of the few — he sees things the way they are because he’s been there and done it.

Elie Tahari, who co-founded Theory with Andrew Rosen in 1997 (they sold it in 2003, but Rosen still runs it), admires Rosen’s personal style.

Andrew always came in to work in Armani with pleats. He was a very dapper guy.

And perhaps most significantly, Rosen’s own 24-year-old son, Austin, has nice things to say too:

On Austin’s phone is a list of things his father says all the time: “If everything was perfect, they wouldn’t need us”; “That’s a long run for a short slide”; “The whale that spouts gets harpooned.” “It’s amazing — it’s so natural with him,” says Austin Rosen. “It’s not so easy to teach, though. You have to see it.”

Indian icon succumbs to charms of Louis Vuitton - The Guardian,"Mon, 19 Mar 2012 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS93b3JsZC8yMDEyL21hci8xOS9sb3Vpcy12dWl0dG9uLWZhYmluZGlhLXB1cmNoYXNl0gFNaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAudGhlZ3VhcmRpYW4uY29tL3dvcmxkLzIwMTIvbWFyLzE5L2xvdWlzLXZ1aXR0b24tZmFiaW5kaWEtcHVyY2hhc2U?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"For generations it has been an Indian icon, the place where the country's left-leaning, intellectual elite get their village-made homespun clothes and, more recently, their organic mango chutney and ethnic-design furnishings.

But fans of Fabindia, though much too mild-mannered to be outraged, have been really quite concerned to discover that the internationally known ethical retailer with an annual turnover of £65m is now part-owned by a private investment firm sponsored by Louis Vuitton Moet Hennessy (LVMH), the luxury goods giant that includes brands such as Dior, Donna Karan, Thomas Pink, Bulgari and the eponymous bags.

""My friends have been sending me a Fabindia kurta (a traditional long-tailed shirt) on my birthday for decades,"" said Sadanand Menon, a well-known artist, choreographer and cultural commentator. ""What are they going to send me now? I hope it's not a matching luggage set.""

The association prompted questions from Tehelka, a campaigning magazine, which asked: ""What will lefty intellectuals now wear to smart parties?"" and from shoppers outside the Fabindia branch in Delhi's exclusive Khan Market.

""I suppose Louis Vuitton is all about craftsmanship and so on, but it's a big jump from some socialite's handbag or some fancy wine to dhurris [traditional rugs] from Rajasthan, isn't it?,"" said Pooja Chandra, 31.

A spokesman for Fabindia repeatedly stressed that the purchase of an 8% stake by L Capital Asia, a fund opened last year by LVMH to invest more than £400m in so-called aspirational brands, positioned between the luxury and the mass market on the continent, would not alter the company's outlook, products or working practices.

""Fabindia is going to stay Fabindia,"" said Prableen Sabhaney. ""It is one of India's iconic brands and we are not going to change. But Fabindia is also a very successful mainstream business and this is our way of raising capital.""

Established in 1960 by an American who had come to India on a Ford Foundation grant to advise the government on creating a market for handloom fabrics produced by artisans in remote rural areas, Fabindia originally focused on export. One big customer was Terence Conran's Habitat; Fabindia ended up supplying rugs and textiles to western living rooms for nearly three decades.

Unlike more conventional suppliers, John Bissell pioneered the idea of ""fair trade"", paying local communities much more than most retailers and allowing artisans and craftspeople to participate actively as suppliers and shareholders.

Crucially, too, Bissell adapted traditional designs to western tastes.

""He added colour, changed designs. It made a huge difference,"" said Radhika Singh, author of The Fabric of Our Lives, a book about the company.

A shop in Delhi was opened in 1976, but real expansion came following liberal economic reforms in India in the early 1990s, which not only boosted the purchasing power of the urban middle class, but simultaneously created a desire for ""authentic"" rural Indian products in a rapidly changing society.

""Fabindia took [clothing] which had once been associated with Gandhi and village life and converted it into a symbol not just of the poor, but of chic, too. It became very popular,"" said Menon, the artist.

Over the last decade, said Singh, the author, a new strategy has aimed to turn Fabindia into a global brand satisfying ""different kinds of clients and consumers"", with new stores opening in the Middle East and Europe. There are now 148 shops in 63 cities in India and eight overseas, with more due to open soon.

In this context, the association with LVMH ""makes a great deal of sense"", Singh said, even if the two companies ""are chalk and cheese"".

""We are now dealing with new money, a large middle class, and the kinds of styles are changing very fast. The new money wants something flash,"" she told the Guardian.

The old market of liberal intellectuals hoping to satisfy a desire to look good, support rural communities and show their attachment to India has almost disappeared, said Dilip Cherian, a marketing and branding consultant. For him, LVMH's investment in Fabindia was simply another element of ""the modern India in the flux of change""."
French perfumier Guerlain convicted of racism - FRANCE 24 English,"Thu, 29 Mar 2012 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZyYW5jZTI0LmNvbS9lbi8yMDEyMDMyOS1qZWFuLXBhdWwtZ3VlcmxhaW4tY29zbWV0aWNzLWZyYW5jZS1wZXJmdW1lLXJhY2lzbdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"FRANCE

Renowned French cosmetics tycoon Jean-Paul Guerlain was convicted by a French court on Thursday of making racist remarks during a television interview in 2010. The 75-year-old heir to the Guerlain empire was fined €6,000.

AP - A French court convicted longtime perfume maker Jean-Paul Guerlain of making racist insults on national television and fined him Thursday €6,000 ($8,000).

The 75-year-old Guerlain, an heir to his family’s cosmetics empire, provoked anger among French minorities with the comments in a 2010 interview on France-2 television.

He used a French word for black people in a derogatory way as he described how hard he worked to create one of the company’s most famed perfumes.

Several anti-racism groups filed legal complaints, and protests were staged in front of the Guerlain store on the Champs-Elysees avenue in Paris. Some called for a boycott of Guerlain products.

Guerlain apologized to France’s black community during the trial, calling it an “imbecilic” remark.

He was convicted in a Paris court. The judge did not sentence him to any prison time, though the charge could have allowed a sentence of up to six months behind bars.

“I am from another generation,” he said during the trial, so part of the remark was “a common expression at the time.” He also said he did so during a TV interview because he “wanted to make the journalist laugh and I regret it.”

“I was anything but racist,” he said, standing before the court with the help of crutches.

Lawyers for the SOS Racism association said Guerlain abused the national platform he was given.

The company distanced itself from Guerlain, who had retired at 65 but remained a consultant.

Guerlain is the great-great-grandson of the founder of the Guerlain cosmetics company, now owned by LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton.

LVMH was embarrassed last year when designer John Galliano - who worked for LVMH subsidiary Christian Dior - was convicted of anti-Semitic comments.

Indonesia to be largest luxury market in SE Asia: LVMH - CNBCTV18,"Thu, 01 Mar 2012 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiKGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmN0djE4LmNvbS9uZXdzLy0yNDc4My5odG3SASxodHRwczovL3d3dy5jbmJjdHYxOC5jb20vbmV3cy8tMjQ3ODMuaHRtL2FtcA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Indonesia will become the largest luxury market in southeast asia over the next few years, Ravi Thakran, LVMH`s head for South Asia, South East Asia and Middle East told CNBC.





According to him, Indonesian consumers currently buy their luxury goods mostly from Hong Kong and Singapore, but Indonesia`s political stability and improving retail infrastructure will help boost the country`s luxury sector.

""I really see a new `I` emerging in BRICS. Going forward, we believe the Indonesian market will be one of the big surprises,"" said Thakran, who added that the country remains an under-penetrated market for high-end goods.

LVMH is planning to open 20 to 22 new cosmetic stores under its Sephora brand in Indonesia over the next two to three years as well as a big flagship store for Fendi within 12 months.

LVMH, the world`s biggest luxury goods group, has remained largely unaffected by global economic uncertainties. Its 2011 profit reached USD 4.04 billion and sales jumped 16 percent on year. Around 25% of its revenue comes from countries in Asia, excluding Japan.

Thakran said that Asia`s luxury consumers have `come of age` and they are acquiring a more refined taste with watches and jewelery being particularly popular. ""When you look at jewelery or watches, Asians are buying the highest priced segment and the most sophisticated of the products.""

LVMH remains positive on China, which is currently the world`s second largest luxury market, with Thakran saying that he sees no sign of a slowdown in the country`s luxury segment.

""In fact, Chinese numbers across the region, be it in Dubai, Singapore, Hong Kong, they are buying more and more in all these markets."""

But will it mean anything in the world of fine wine?

The Bulgari family does not know, but this week it will begin to find out. A new wine venture by two members of the Bulgari watch and jewelry dynasty, Paolo and Giovanni Bulgari, will release its first three wines this weekend at Vinitaly, the international wine trade fair in Verona, Italy.

The wines, made at the family’s PoderNuovo estate here in southern Tuscany, are the first fruits of the enterprise established by the former chairman of the Bulgari Group, Paolo Bulgari, and his son since the family sold control of the jewelry company through a share swap with the French luxury company LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton in March 2011.

It is difficult to make a splash in the world of fine wine. It is very competitive and has plenty of venerable boutique brands like Tignanello, produced by Antinori, or Tenuta San Guido’s Sassicaia wines. But that has not stopped many celebrities, like the golfer Greg Norman and the actress Drew Barrymore, from entering the business."
Nigeria's Luxury Market - Business Insider,"Thu, 22 Mar 2012 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiPWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vbmlnZXJpYXMtbHV4dXJ5LW1hcmtldC0yMDEyLTPSAUFodHRwczovL3d3dy5idXNpbmVzc2luc2lkZXIuY29tL25pZ2VyaWFzLWx1eHVyeS1tYXJrZXQtMjAxMi0zP2FtcA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) — Glittering sapphire necklaces, designer suits against perfumed skin, the taste of freshly popped Champagne and the roar of a speeding Porsche: the five senses in Nigeria, brought to you by luxury brands now trying to tap directly into the country's market.

The wealthy elite in Nigeria — upstart business owners, oil industry executives and corrupt politicians — have a healthy appetite for top-shelf brands, but have previously had to shop for them in Dubai, London and Paris. Now though, sellers of luxury goods are opening stores in Nigeria where seemingly gratuitous displays of wealth are the norm.

This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.

""I feel that with some real infrastructure development and opportunity to create luxury environments for luxury brands to come in, this market has enormous potential to become a key luxury capital of Africa,"" said Ozwald Boateng, a top British fashion designer born to Ghanaian parents who recently showed a collection at Arise Magazine Fashion Week in Lagos.

""I have some very good clients here but I want to have more,"" said Boateng, who has a flagship store on London's prestigious Savile Row, where bespoke suits start at around $6,500.

Since independence in 1960, wealth flowed into Nigeria as crude oil pumped out. The OPEC nation's easily refined crude remains a top energy source for the U.S. However, politicians and military rulers squandered billions of dollars through the corruption choking the nation's potential.

Then democracy took hold in 1999, and other industries have since developed in the country of 160 million, including banking and telecommunications. Billionaire Aliko Dangote, whose net worth is $11.2 billion according to Forbes magazine, built his empire on commodities like flour, sugar and cement. Another billionaire, Mike Adenuga, runs an oil company and Globacom Ltd., one of Nigeria's largest mobile phone service providers.

Nigeria's commercial capital Lagos, along with four other of Africa's largest cities, will each have consumer spending of $25 billion or more by 2020, according to a McKinsey & Co. report. That's comparable to spending in India's business hub of Mumbai.

That purchasing power is starting to draw new brands into Nigeria. Those include LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SA, one of the world's largest luxury brand groups; Amrapali Jewels Pvt. Ltd., which makes jewels for Hollywood and Bollywood stars; and Porsche AG. Those businesses often work with partners already established in Nigeria's difficult businesses environment, where there are no dedicated luxury shopping areas. Luxury companies can run small operations, get little competition and have markups that make the profits high.

LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SA, the French luxury conglomerate, has doubled its marketing efforts in Nigeria to sell its top-shelf wines and liquors. The company also came out with a commemorative Hennessy cognac bottle in honor of Nigeria's 50th independence last year — a sign of the country's value to the company.

""Nigeria is the largest market in Africa and the Middle East for Moet Hennessy,"" said the company's Nigeria marketing manager, Tokini Peterside. ""For Hennessy cognac, Nigeria ranks among the Top 10 consuming countries in the world.""

It's not just cognac that Nigerian top buyers want. Indian jewelers Amrapali sold a $37,000 necklace in Nigeria that set a diamond in 22-karat gold with blue, yellow and red sapphires and hope to sell others at the store they stock in Nigeria.

""We've noticed that people are not afraid to wear bold things,"" said Sameer Lilani, a London-based representative for Amrapali. ""It suits people here and it suits the climate. The delicate things didn't get such a good reaction.""

Sports car maker Porsche AG also recently opened a showroom on Lagos' Victoria Island, home to many company headquarters and homes for the nation's wealthiest citizens. The open-air showroom, visible from traffic on one of the island's busiest roads, prominently displays the new Porsche 911 Carrera S, starting from about $150,000.

""In any project that we do, we look far beyond today,"" said George Wills, Porsche's managing director for the Middle East and Africa. ""Whilst today the numbers may not be significant, what will happen with Porsche in the future as we produce new models, new derivatives, is that these will create bigger opportunities.""

Spending that much money on a Porsche that goes from zero to 60 miles per hour in four seconds may not make sense in the reality of Nigeria, where poorly maintained roads have axle-eating potholes. Such spending also draws criticism from social commentators, especially as a recent government report showed more than 100 million people in Nigeria live in poverty, subsisting on less than $2 a day.

Yet the spending continues in a nation where the rich take out full-page newspaper advertisements to celebrate birthdays and bells ring and waiters light up sparklers when a table buys a bottle of Champagne.

Many of those waiting the tables and hustling chewing gum in traffic hold out the belief, based on churches preaching financial prosperity, that they too will some day look out at the world from behind tinted glass.

""There is a sense of opportunity here. People believe 'my turn will come,'"" said Folarin Gbadebo-Smith, the director of the Centre for Public Policy Alternatives in Lagos. ""Whereas in many other places there's that sense that where you find yourself in society could be permanent, here everybody is rich in waiting."""

Famed perfumist Guerlain faces ruling on racist comments - FRANCE 24 English,"Wed, 28 Mar 2012 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZyYW5jZTI0LmNvbS9lbi8yMDEyMDMyOC1mcmFuY2UtZmFtZWQtcGVyZnVtaXN0LWd1ZXJsYWluLWZhY2VzLXJ1bGluZy1yYWNpc3QtY29tbWVudHNwYXJpcy1jb3VydNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"FRANCE

Jean-Paul Guerlain, once known as the ""nose"" behind the famous French perfume brand that bares his name, risks jail time and a hefty fine Thursday if a Paris court finds him guilty on charges of making ""racist insults"".

AFP - A Paris court was to decide Thursday whether Jean-Paul Guerlain, for decades the ""nose"" behind the world-famous perfume brand, was being racist when he said that he ""worked like a negro.""

Asked in an October 2010 television interview about how he had created the Samsara scent, Guerlain replied using a racial slur -- the French term ""negre"" -- and implied that black people are lazy.

""For once, I set to work like a negro. I don't know if negroes have always worked like that, but anyway,"" he said.

The incident sparked widespread condemnation, with anti-racism groups saying it highlighted deep prejudice in French society.

The 75-year-old heir to one of the world's oldest perfume houses went on trial in February on charges of making ""racist insults"" during the interview on French public television.

He faces up to six months in prison and a 22,500 euro ($30,000) fine if the court finds him guilty when it delivers its verdict on Thursday.

And this month French police said they were probing additional accusations that Guerlain made an anti-immigrant rant against Eurostar workers.

Three employees of the high-speed rail firm that links Paris and London made a complaint to police accusing Guerlain of making remarks of a racist nature as they helped the wheelchair-bound pensioner board a train.

Guerlain missed the train because he arrived late at Paris Gare du Nord station and then allegedly launched into a tirade against the three, two of whom were black and the third of Asian origin.

His televised comments last October were quickly denounced, with France's Movement Against Racism and for Friendship (MRAP) saying the remarks revealed ""the state of ordinary racism that still permeates French society.""

Guerlain apologised but protests erupted outside the company's boutique on the Champs Elysees in Paris and there were calls for a boycott of Guerlain and its owner, luxury brand giant Louis Vuitton Moet Hennessy (LVMH).

""I offer my apologies to all those who might have been hurt by my shocking words,"" Guerlain said in a statement after the interview. He said the comments ""in no way reflect my true thinking, but were a slip of the tongue.""

The Guerlain company also distanced itself from the remarks, saying his words were ""unacceptable"" and noting that Guerlain had not been a shareholder in the company since 1996 or on salary since 2002.

Guerlain took over the family perfume house from his grandfather, Jacques, in 1959, by which time he could reportedly recognise 3,000 subtly different smells.

The perfume house was run by the Guerlain family for five generations and created over 300 fragrances since doctor and chemist Pierre Francois Pascal Guerlain opened his first perfume boutique in Paris 183 years ago.

LVMH purchased the company in 1994 and Guerlain remained as master perfumer until he retired in 2002.

During his time at the company he was hailed as one of the great perfume ""noses"" of the 20th century and created famous scents including Samsara, Nahema and Jardins de Bagatelle.

A brief history of Guerlain - The Guardian,"Mon, 26 Mar 2012 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9mYXNoaW9uL2Zhc2hpb24tYmxvZy8yMDEyL21hci8yNi9icmllZi1oaXN0b3J5LWd1ZXJsYWlu0gFTaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAudGhlZ3VhcmRpYW4uY29tL2Zhc2hpb24vZmFzaGlvbi1ibG9nLzIwMTIvbWFyLzI2L2JyaWVmLWhpc3RvcnktZ3VlcmxhaW4?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"What's the story?

This is the tale of a real family business: five generations of Guerlains have led the company over the years. The brand dates back to 1828, when it started life as a small perfume business in Paris under Pierre-François Pascal Guerlain. Guerlain was a master perfumer, creating fragrances for the rich and famous - Napoléon III and Queen Victoria to name but two.

Pierre-François Pascal passed his skills on to his son Aimé, who in turn taught his nephew Jacques (the latter being responsible for Guerlain's signature Shalimar scent). Years later, Jacques handed down the family secrets to his grandson Jean-Paul, which is where the buck stopped. In 1994, Jean-Paul sold the company to the multinational LMVH.

In the 184 years since its inception, Guerlain has created more than 325 different fragrances and still holds its own in the luxury perfume market.

So it's just perfume?

Au contraire! Pierre-François Pascal Guerlain created all sorts of lotions and potions, including a lip balm (Baume de la Ferté) that is still available today. Their makeup range has a five-star feel to it - lots of gold, reassuringly weighty and sleekly designed palettes, bottles and bullets (I may have mentioned previously that I'm a sucker for a bit of shiny packaging). I particularly like the Rouge G lipsticks (£29.50, available from the Guardian Fashion Store) as the bullet actually has its own flip-out mirror. How very clever!

What else?

The new Terracotta Light Sheer Bronzing Powder from Guerlain Photograph: Fabien SARAZIN

Probably most well-known (and bestselling) of the Guerlain makeup is their Terracotta range - a collection of summery bits and bobs with new launches every year. This year's offering is called Sun In The City and includes two new shades of the existing Terracotta Light sheer bronzing powder (£33.50, debenhams.com), made with darker skin in mind. It's a splendid all-rounder with a super-light texture and pinky or coral hues, meaning it can be used either as a blush on cheeks or a full-on bronzer for the parts of your face that the sun naturally hits. Also, it's scented which is rather nice.

If that's a bit out of your price range then try NYC Color Wheel Face Mosaic in Rose Glow (£3.99, superdrug.com). Not quite as light, and not perfumed, but a tenth of the price and you can't argue with that."
