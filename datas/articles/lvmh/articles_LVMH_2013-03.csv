Is Nicholas Kirkwood LVMH's New Pet Project? - The Cut,"Fri, 15 Mar 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWN1dC5jb20vMjAxMy8wMy9uaWNob2xhcy1raXJrd29vZC1sdm1ocy1uZXctcGV0LXByb2plY3QuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Photo: Nick Harvey/WireImage

Sources told WWD that Nicholas Kirkwood, who took home the fourth BFC/Vogue Designer Fashion Fund prize at the end of January, “is meeting with potential backers, including LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton,” but “the likelihood of a deal, and the identity of other potential suitors, could not immediately be learned.” Last month, LVMH announced plans to invest in Maxime Simoëns’s eponymous brand. Though the luxury goods conglomerate wouldn’t comment on what percentage of the Simoëns label it purchased, it was said to be a minority stake.

LVMH Look to Expand Stake in Indian Watch Market - Haute Time,"Wed, 27 Mar 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhhdXRldGltZS5jb20vbHZtaC1sb29rLXRvLWV4cGFuZC1zdGFrZS1pbi1pbmRpYW4td2F0Y2gtbWFya2V0L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Luxury conglomerate LVMH are looking to increase their stake in the multi-billion dollar watch industry by expanding their presence in the Indian market. Louis Vuitton Moët Hennessy (which owns Tag Heuer, Hublot, Zenith, and Bulgari) are looking to increase growth in the watch and jewellery segments, with plans to open eight new boutiques across India.

Franck Dardenne, the country manager at LVMH Watch and Jewellery India, spoke to the English-language daily newspaper Financial Chronicle about the conglomerate’s plans: “We want to aggressively tap the growing popularity of our brand among the rich and famous, as well as the aspiring middle class with growing disposable incomes. We are opening two new boutiques in Chennai next month after the soft launch this week.”

“The luxury watch market in India is pegged over 40,000 units annually with a billing of over Rs 1,000 crore,” Dardenne said, adding that in the years to come, LVMH expects the market to grow by 15-20%. It’s good news for the conglomerate’s brands, since according to Dardenne one out of five luxury watches sold in India is a TAG Heuer.

At the moment the French conglomerate has six boutiques in the country, with two each in Delhi, Mumbai, and Bangalore. The group’s brands are also sold through more than 80 multibrand retailers across the country. However, with growing concern over counterfeit timepieces, brand-owned boutiques have become increasingly popular since they offer a guaranteed chain of supply.

LVMH currently stands in third in the Indian market, behind the Swatch and Rolex brands.

On the Wings of Céline | BoF - The Business of Fashion,"Wed, 27 Mar 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzb2ZmYXNoaW9uLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy9uZXdzLWFuYWx5c2lzL29uLXRoZS13aW5ncy1vZi1jZWxpbmUv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS, France — A flip through any of the fashion glossies currently on the newsstand can induce an uncanny sense of déjà vu. Practically every other advertisement for a luxury brand — from Lanvin to Valentino to Fendi — prominently features a somewhat boxy leather bag that widens towards the top to form a vaguely trapezoidal, 'winged' shape. This is no coincidence, but rather evidence of the unmistakable influence of one woman: Phoebe Philo, the creative director of the house of Céline, who pioneered the shape.

It's no secret that Céline, acquired by luxury conglomerate LVMH in 1996, has been hugely influential, and a favourite of critics, since Phoebe Philo took the creative reins in 2008. In a recent profile for American Vogue, Hamish Bowles said Philo had ""reinvented the way women dress and transformed a mere house into a fashion cult."" But Philo's Céline has been a commercial success story as well. While LVMH doesn't break out performance figures for individual brands, on an earnings call in January, the group's chairman and CEO, Bernard Arnault, made special mention of Céline, saying that the brand had produced ""exceptional results."" Indeed, according to market sources, Céline's revenues are said to have doubled in the last three years, surpassing €400 million for 2012, Milano Finanza Fashion reported in early February.

It's an impressive achievement and one that's been driven largely by the label's formidable leather goods business. Beginning with her first collection for the house, Philo introduced three foundational bag lines — the 'Cabas', 'Luggage' and ""Classic' — with pared-down, logo-free designs, distinguished by their easily identifiable shapes. Last year, speaking to WWD, Céline's chief executive, Marco Gobetti, called them the ""pillars"" of the business. Each season, the label releases new iterations of these models, sometimes customised for specific regions or retailers. On top of this foundation, Philo has also gradually added new shapes, such as this season's 'Edge.'

Following the opening of Céline's first US store, a major flagship on New York's Madison Avenue, the brand plans to finally unveil a full-fledged, Peter Marino-designed flagship in Paris later this year, while stores in Hong Kong and Los Angeles are said to be in the works. But such is the power of Philo's bag designs that, even at the raw-feeling, temporary Paris store the brand has operated on rue François 1er since 2010, product consistently sells out. And all this, despite a questionable decision to completely eschew e-commerce.

Retailers, too, continue their unabashed love affair with Céline. When New York department store Bergdorf Goodman announced its ambitious makeover plans last week, the retailer said it planned to anchor the revamped accessories area on the ground-floor of its iconic Fifth Avenue store around two brands — Chanel and Céline — placing Philo's house alongside what may be the foremost luxury fashion label in the world.

""[Céline] is the perfect storm of a truly original fresh voice, absolute perfection of quality, utter standards, disciplined brand stewardship and good timing,"" Linda Fargo, senior vice president and fashion director of Bergdorf Goodman, told BoF. ""Céline operates on all these cylinders all at once. And if imitation is any gauge of success, then clearly Phoebe Philo's Céline is universally recognized as the pinnacle 'It' brand.""

""I felt it was necessary to establish quality to the brand,"" Philo told The Wall Street Journal back in 2010.""Now that we are establishing that and the top of the pyramid is in place, we can open it out.""

Indeed, building on Céline's current momentum, Pierre-Yves Roussel, president of LVMH's fashion division, aims to double the brand's revenues in the next three to five years, according to Milano Finanza Fashion. But as Céline continues to grow, will the brand be able to maintain the elite positioning it has worked so hard to attain, while increasing revenues at the scale LVMH envisions?

Fargo, for one, isn't worried: “Dare I say it, they may well become the modern-day equivalent of the standard bearer of non-perishable luxury: Hermès.”

Disclosure: LVMH is part of a consortium of investors which has a minority stake in The Business of Fashion."

That's Rich: Saudi Prince and Forbes in Spat Over Billionaire List | TIME.com - Time Magazine,"Thu, 07 Mar 2013 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd29ybGQudGltZS5jb20vMjAxMy8wMy8wNy90aGF0cy1yaWNoLXNhdWRpLXByaW5jZS1hbmQtZm9yYmVzLWluLXNwYXQtb3Zlci1iaWxsaW9uYWlyZS1saXN0L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Prince Alwaleed Bin Talal isn’t happy with Forbes for ranking him No. 26 on its annual billionaires’ list and estimating his wealth at $20 billion. He says he’s worth more.

YASSER AL-ZAYYAT / AFP / GETTY IMAGES Saudi Prince Alwaleed bin Talal holds a press conference in Kuwait City on April 24, 2011. The Prince claims that Forbes underestimated his wealth on its annual billionaires' list.

Prince Alwaleed bin Talal of Saudi Arabia has publicly severed ties with Forbes magazine and its annual billionaires’ list after the magazine estimated his worth at $20 billion. The prince insists he’s worth a lot more, according to the Independent.

The nephew of the current Saudi monarch, King Abdullah, is currently ranked No. 26 on Forbes’ 27th annual billionaires’ list. But the Prince, whose Kingdom Holding Co. has investments in everything from Rupert Murdoch’s News Corp. to Citigroup, put his own wealth at $29.6 billion – nearly $10 billion higher than Forbes’ estimate, the Independent reported.

If Prince Alwaleed is correct, the figure would catapult him into the ranks of the top 10 wealthiest people in the world, ahead of Google founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page, New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg and LVMH Chairman and CEO Bernard Arnault.

Unimpressed with his Forbes ranking, the Prince will instead work with a rival rich list: the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. The Bloomberg list, which started last year, ranks the Prince as the world’s 16th-richest person with an estimated wealth of $28 billion.

The Saudi royal’s office said in a statement: “Prince Alwaleed has taken this step as he felt he could no longer participate in a process which resulted in the use of incorrect data and seemed designed to disadvantage Middle Eastern investors and institutions.”

Shadi Sanbar, the finance chief of Kingdom Holdings, added that the Prince has “worked very openly with the Forbes team over the years and have on multiple occasions pointed out problems with their methodology that need correction,” the Telegraph reported.

However, Forbes isn’t budging. The magazine published a piece on its website on Wednesday entitled “Prince Alwaleed And The Curious Case of Kingdom Holding Stock,” recounting how Sanbar attacked Forbes reporters and its methodology before the annual list was released. The article also mentioned how it had been investigating Prince Alwaleed’s finances for several years.

It appears the argument is over Forbe’s refusal to use share values as listed by Saudi Arabia’s stock exchange, Tadawul. According to the Guardian, Forbes accepts the valuations of other emerging markets like the Mexican stock exchange. Prince Alwaleed’s investment company, Kingdom Holding, said in a statement: “The application of differing standards of proof for different individuals resulting in an arbitrary set of standards that seems biased against the Middle East.”

A Forbes spokeswoman said the Prince would continue to be included in the list in the future, even if he chooses not to participate, CNN Money reported.

L'Oréal heiress Bettencourt is world's richest woman - FRANCE 24 English,"Tue, 05 Mar 2013 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZyYW5jZTI0LmNvbS9lbi8yMDEzMDMwNS1mcmFuY2Utd29ybGQtcmljaGVzdC13b21hbi1iZXR0ZW5jb3VydC1mb3JiZXPSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"FRANCE

L’Oréal heiress Liliane Bettencourt has been named the wealthiest woman in the world after breaking into Forbes magazine’s “Top 20 Billionaires” list for the first time since 1999. Her net worth is estimated at $30 billion.

Advertising Read more

Liliane Bettencourt's grip on cosmetics and beauty giant L'Oréal has loosened considerably over the years. And yet the 90-year-old L'Oréal heiress is getting richer by the day.

Forbes ranked Bettencourt and her family at number nine on its “2013’s Top 20 Billionaires” list, with a net worth of $30 billion, making her not only the world’s richest woman, but also the wealthiest person in France. Bernard Arnault, chairman and CEO of the luxury group LVMH, came in just behind Bettencourt with a net worth of $29 billion, dropping six places on the list from last year.

Born in Paris in 1922, Bettencourt was the only child of L‘Oréal founder Eugène Schueller. She inherited the L’Oréal fortune upon her father’s death in 1957, becoming the firm’s main shareholder. According to Forbes, she still owns 30 percent of the company’s shares -- the source of her considerable wealth.

From family feud...

The French public was given a rare glimpse into Bettencourt’s life in 2010 after a legal battle with her only daughter, Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers, created a scandal that reached into the highest echelons of government. Convinced that her mother, who suffers from dementia, had been swindled by celebrity photographer François-Marie Banier out of millions of euros in cash and gifts, Bettencourt-Meyers sought to have her placed under legal guardianship.

Banier fiercely denied Bettencourt-Meyers’ charges, while Bettencourt herself at one point accused her daughter of “vile doggedness” in her determination to get her hands on the family fortune.

The saga quickly spiraled out of control amid allegations that Liliane Bettencourt had showered former French President Nicolas Sarkozy’s 2007 election campaign with illegal contributions. The scandal soon focused squarely on Sarkozy’s trusted ally and then-labour minister, Eric Woerth.

... to political scandal

While Sarkozy ultimately emerged from the scandal relatively unscathed, Woerth was not as fortunate. He was forced to leave government amid widespread calls for his resignation in July, 2010.

As Woerth dominated headlines across France, Bettencourt and her daughter reconciled, bringing a brief end to the bitter legal battle that had turned family gossip into fodder for the press. One year later, though, in 2011, the scandal resurfaced, this time with Bettencourt-Meyers successfully gaining legal guardianship of her mother, and, therefore, control of the family fortune.

Since then, Bettencourt has been replaced on L’Oréal’s board by her grandson Jean-Victor Meyers. Regardless, she has continued to accrue wealth over the past few years, catapaulting her once again into the Forbes's top 20 list for the first time in over a decade.

The salon’s owner, a man surnamed Chan, said LVMH sent him a “deed of undertaking” initially demanding HK$25,000 in compensation and a published apology.

Luxury goods brand Louis Vuitton is accusing the owner of a Shau Kei Wan hair salon of trademark infringement after he was found to have chairs covered in what appeared to be the French label’s trademarked check pattern, Apple Daily reported on Tuesday.

The company said they found an adjustable stool and reclining shampoo chair in Chan’s salon covered in a fabric that closely resembled the brand’s iconic check pattern. Chan has since removed the chequered covers but claims he cannot afford to pay.

""In the case of Apple Daily, we follow a cooperative approach to encourage the infringer to sign an undertaking, publish an acknowledgement of our trademark rights and bear a portion of the [infringement] costs,"" said a statement issued by Louis Vuitton Asia Pacific's spokesperson on Thursday.

""In majority of cases, we reach an agreement with the infringer that is reasonable to both parties yet ensuring the application of the law.""

Chan, 33, said he sourced the furniture in Shenzhen for a total of HK$1,200 after opening his salon last year and was not aware the pattern was LV’s intellectual property.

“I can’t go against such a big corporation…Right now I’m just hoping they will be generous and make me compensate a smaller amount,” Chan told the newspaper. “Worse case scenario, I could just close down.”

Last year, Louis Vuitton claimed to have been responsible for more than 11,000 raids and 30,000 anti-counterfeiting lawsuits worldwide."

Believes Hollande's tax regime is anti-business



Two Moët Hennessy executives due to move



LVMH said executives are not leaving for tax reasons



The millionaire boss of French technology giant Dassault Systemes said 'residing in France has become a big handicap.'

Bernard Charles' criticism of President Francois Hollande's new tax regime comes as two senior executives at Moët Hennessy move to London from Paris.



President Hollande is under pressure as Gallic tycoons look to quit France to flee higher taxes while the economy continues to struggle.



Cashing out: Bernard Charles, 55, has revealed he is considering joining thousands of wealthy French fleeing President Francois Hollande's new tax regime

Mr Charles, 55, said he is considering whether to follow suit and leave the country.



He told French daily Le Monde in an interview: 'Residing in France has become a big handicap. Very largely, our hiring of top managers will have to be done elsewhere than in France.'

Europe's richest man Bernard Arnault denies the two executives from Moët Hennessy, the champagne and cognac arm of LVMH, are leaving because of tax reasons.



Mr Arnault, who heads LVMH luxury goods company, told the Financial Times that tax is not behind the move by LVMH director Gilles Hennessy and Christophe Navarre, chief executive of Moët Hennessy.

Mr Arnault is himself applying for residency in Belgium.



The latest moves will be bad news for President Hollande, whose approval ratings have dropped to as low as 30 per cent as unemployment reached 10 per cent of the workforce.



Europe's richest man Bernard Arnault has applied to Belgium for dual nationality

LVMH said it will continue to be based in Paris and told the Financial Times Belgian national Mr Navarre 'pays, and will continue to pay, his taxes in France.'

The paper reported that Mr Hennessy plans to retire later this year.

Mr Charles said his own decision about whether to leave France will not be based on tax.



'But to be clear, this isn’t about plans for a 75 per cent tax on all earnings above a million euros - even if I do think that tax above a certain level is confiscatory.'

Mr Charles sold £24million worth of shares in Dassault Systemes - which makes software for industry - last year.



Asked if this was a sign he was about to quit, he answered: 'I had to do that to pay other taxes related to the purchase of other shares, but it does show how heavy taxes are these days.



'But if I find I can no longer buy and sell shares in the company, I will leave.'

Actor Gerard Depardieu has quit France for Russia over the tax plans

He also revealed that other highly-paid Dassault executives had left France, adding: 'I can’t say how many, but not as many as those that want to.'

With LVMH in his corner, new boy Maxime Simoens made his mark on Paris Fashion Week today, writes Luke Leitch.

Watch out, fashion: tanned, trim, in professorial horn-rimmed spectacles and shockingly youthful (a young-looking 28), Maxime Simoens made his Paris Pret-a-Porter debut today.

As he equably received the fragrant embraces of various wafty Parisian celeb-moiselles post-show, Simoens semaphored not a jot of the raging anxiety many designers - particularly the young ones - are gripped by at this moment.

LVMH, the world's largest luxury conglomerate, looks to have chosen a candidate to play Simon Cowell-style star-maker with extremely wisely. Last month the group announced a minority acquisition of the Simoens brand, which was enough to attract editors and buyers you'd normally never expect to see at a relative unknown's show.

The heft of LVMH was evident in the flawless finishing of this collection. Elaborate shoes with vine like ebony tendrils that looped up the leg looked expensively and perfectly produced. A beautiful aquatic horizontal-wash gabardine that was meant to echo the wateriness of Swan Lake - Simoens starting point for the collection - was gleamingly accomplished. His black or white, corolla-skirt dresses with faux-astrakhan panels nodded to the ballerina but brought her from on-stage to cocktail party. There was a hint of Victoria Beckhaminess in his closely fitted contra-collared shirts and the technical, deliberate sexiness of these dresses and pencil skirts. Cigarette trousers were neat and close, their tweed paneled jackets in blue and black efficiently sporty.

Following PPR's recent investment in Christopher Kane, LVMH's support for Simoens might represent the start of a heartening new trend. For years these groups have appointed young designers as creative masterminds at old houses, all to perpetuate the recognisability of their cash-cow brands. Yet the friction between pre-established codes and newly-installed designers can be uncomfortable. Much better to ask a talented newcomer to go his own way than make him join a tribute act.

Simoens's collection was no rival to the roiling creativity of Kane's, but his calmness, the consistency of these highly wearable luxury pieces, and the presence of LVMH'S chief doer, Sidney Toledano, backstage today all suggest that he is a real prospect. ""I just want to do more and more fashion shows,"" he said: ""I want to build my own universe.""

Has Logo Fatigue Reached a Tipping Point? - The Business of Fashion,"Mon, 11 Mar 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzb2ZmYXNoaW9uLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy9uZXdzLWFuYWx5c2lzL2hhcy1sb2dvLWZhdGlndWUtcmVhY2hlZC1hLXRpcHBpbmctcG9pbnQv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS, France — At last week's Louis Vuitton show, all eyes were on Kate Moss, as she walked down the runway in a long-sleeved embroidered tulle dress and a choppy short black wig. But while the Croydon-born supermodel was certainly attention-grabbing, a more interesting surprise was tucked into the show notes that awaited each guest. There, hidden between celebrations of the house's savoir faire and high quality materials was this sentence, penned by Vuitton's creative director Marc Jacobs: ""The house's Monogram and Damier canvas are nowhere to be seen on the catwalk.""

Especially in light of last season's Vuitton showing, inspired by the label's signature two-tone checkerboard known as Damier, the disownment of two of the brand's most recognisable visual signifiers seemed like an about-face. But rather than being a seasonal whim on Jacobs' part, the shift reflects a new strategy outlined earlier this year by the designer's boss, Bernard Arnault, chairman and chief executive of LVMH, the luxury conglomerate which owns Louis Vuitton.

After the fashion and leather goods company, which accounts for more than half of LVMH’s profits, reported, for the second quarter in a row, its slowest growth in revenue since 2009, Arnault said, on an earnings call in January, that the brand would open fewer stores, focus on more luxurious materials and reduce the visibility of its monogrammed products.

“Of course it would be easier for Louis Vuitton to boost its revenue; all it would take would be to launch ten new products with the monogram product, but down the road it’s not a good strategy,” he said.

But what does it mean when the world’s largest luxury brand shifts its focus away from the very trademarks on which its success has been built? Clearly, Louis Vuitton has detected that some of its customers are tiring of the brand’s increasingly ubiquitous ‘LV’ monogram and its equally familiar Damier, begging a question with wide-ranging ramifications for the sector.

Has luxury logo fatigue reached a tipping point?

As LVMH generates 28 percent of its sales in Asia (excluding Japan), according to the group’s annual results, it’s not surprising that Vuitton’s strategic reorientation is inextricably linked to shifting consumption habits in China.

To be clear, the logo-loving Chinese consumer hasn’t disappeared and still accounts for a significant portion of revenue. According to Bain & Company’s ‘Luxury Goods Worldwide Market Study,’ published in cooperation with Italian luxury goods trade association Altagamma, “Consumers in China remain focused on conspicuous logos. Fifty-five percent of consumers outside of Beijing and Shanghai say they will buy more products showing logos.” Similarly, a recent survey by the Hurun Report identified Vuitton as the top preferred brand when it comes to gifting by wealthy Chinese men.

But the rise of a more discerning consumer, who eschews blatant brand signifiers, is putting new pressure on brands like Louis Vuitton to adapt their communications strategies and product assortments. “Chinese shoppers in Beijing and Shanghai are now truly global luxury consumers. They are shifting away from typical emerging market preference for logos and other visible signs of luxury spending, and shifting to a global mindset of uniqueness, high-quality and understatement in luxury items,” according to the Bain study.

“Luxury in China is now about being ‘in the know’ versus being ‘in the show’,” said Bruno Lannes, a Bain partner in Greater China and lead author of the Chinese edition of the study. “Changes in what Chinese shoppers want are now a central issue for the global luxury sector’s largest brands.”

Of course, logo fatigue is not new. Nor is it unique to China. The phenomenon swept over Japan, Europe and the US long before emerging in less developed markets. In the 1990s, the 'LV' monogram was highly popular in American and European cities, but slowly drifted away (often relegated to the provinces) as more savvy and demanding consumers sought out less obvious brand signifiers like iconic shapes or signature design treatments — Chanel's quilting, for example — that only a select, like-minded minority would recognise.

By 2001, logo fatigue was pervasive enough in the West to power the rise of ‘stealth luxury’ brands like Bottega Veneta, which, over the last decade, grew from a small, family-run enterprise to a global powerhouse driving over $1 billion-plus sales.

But in the last few years, even companies like Gucci, which continued to rely heavily on logo-ed products well into the 2000s, have changed direction. In 2010, François-Henri Pinault, chairman and chief executive of PPR, which owns Gucci, told WWD: ""Our groups are moving toward fewer logos, more discreet luxury. It's a question of adapting our ranges very rapidly to this new perception of luxury, a luxury which is more subtle, more sophisticated which is what we are doing.""

Conventional wisdom, however, said that conspicuous logos would remain desirable in emerging markets like China. But in a country where luxury brands have expanded their retail presence aggressively — Vuitton is available even in provincial cities like Guangxi and Hefei — logo fatigue is starting to take hold sooner than expected. Indeed, it’s taken Chinese consumers only a few years to approach the level of maturation that took more than a decade to emerge in Japan.

It goes without saying that being seen as commonplace is poison for any luxury brand, thus Arnault’s plans to limit Vuitton’s store openings and focus its communications on high-value, logo-free leather goods that signal their specialness more discreetly, through shape and materials.

But as Vuitton shifts course, the challenge will be striking the right balance between exclusivity and popularity to remain profitable.

Paul Graham quits Anomaly - London - CampaignLive,"Fri, 08 Mar 2013 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNhbXBhaWdubGl2ZS5jby51ay9hcnRpY2xlL3BhdWwtZ3JhaGFtLXF1aXRzLWFub21hbHkvMTE3Mzg0NtIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"His departure follows the appointment last November of Ben Moore, the former Sony and Nike marketer, as a partner at the agency.



Graham, the former managing partner of Rainey Kelly Campbell Roalfe / Y&R agency Saint, joined Anomaly to launch the UK office in 2009. The UK agency’s opening followed Carl Johnson’s launch of Anomaly in New York in 2005.



Graham has left the agency to take a break before considering his next move.



Since Moore’s arrival, Anomaly has hired Stuart Smith, the head of planning at Wieden & Kennedy New York, as a partner. It is expected to announce the appointment of a creative partner within weeks.



Last year, Anomaly lost its Sony Europe business after the advertiser made changes to its marketing team in Europe and moved to a system of briefing global work out of its Tokyo HQ.
