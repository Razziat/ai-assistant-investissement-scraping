Will LVMH Change Loro Piana's Commitment to Ultra Luxury? - The Business of Fashion,"Tue, 31 May 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzb2ZmYXNoaW9uLmNvbS9uZXdzL2x1eHVyeS9jYW4tbG9yby1waWFuYXMtNDIwMDAtb3ZlcmNvYXQtc3Vydml2ZS1hcy1wYXJ0LW9mLWx2bWhzLWVtcGlyZS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"MILAN, Italy — This is how luxury is made: At the foot of the Italian Alps, rows of machines sift, comb and twist wool from cashmere goats, Merino sheep and Andean vicuna. In one aisle, a worker in a green polo and khaki pants reattaches some fibres so they can be spun into yarn and become capes or coats that can sell for $42,000.

Technology aside, it’s a process that hasn’t changed much since Pier Luigi Loro Piana joined his family’s textile business 40 years ago. What’s different: Loro Piana, 64, no longer controls the company that bears his name. Since 2013, the manufacturer has been in the hands of French luxury conglomerate LVMH, which paid 2 billion euros ($2.2 billion) for an 80 percent stake.

The sale led to a new chairman and a new chief executive officer, and this year could bring an end to the Loro Piana family’s involvement. Pier Luigi hopes it doesn’t also mean a decline in the quality that allows the 92-year-old company to charge clients eye-watering prices at a time when even the very wealthy are reining in spending on luxury goods.

“Quality will save our company,” said Loro Piana, wearing a blue double-breasted wool, linen and silk suit over a white shirt, navy tie and tasseled brown loafers. “This has to be the real mission.”

LVMH has respected those values so far and being one of its 70 businesses has made Loro Piana stronger, the executive said at the Italian company’s offices in nearby Quarona. This year Loro Piana will reopen a store on luxury-shopping hub Avenue Montaigne in Paris, and Loro Piana is serving as a kitchen for the French group’s other fashion brands to cook up ideas, he said.

Loro Piana is something of a rarity within LVMH and the fashion and luxury goods industry in general: It controls every step, from raising the vicuna on a 2,000-hectare nature reserve in Peru to weaving yarns into apparel and accessories for distribution in its 156 stores. About three-quarters of Loro Piana's estimated 800 million euros of revenue comes from finished products, the rest from supplying textiles to other brands. The company produces about 5 million meters of fabric each year.

Back at the mill, a technician in a white lab coat pores over an electronic microscope as she checks a cashmere sample. Behind her is a photo of her counterpart in Beijing, who has already analysed another sample from the same batch, also taking more than 1,000 measurements, to ensure it meets Loro Piana’s standards for purity, fineness and length.

“From this material, which is very soft, to think that you produce a fabric, something that you wear, something that you use,” said Loro Piana, recalling his amazement the first time his father showed him that the butter-soft cashmere he touched could be transformed into a suit. “It’s the oldest technology in the world.”

The Loro Piana family has been trading wool and textiles since the beginning of the 19th century and established the company in 1924. Franco Loro Piana, Pier Luigi’s father, started exporting fine fabrics in the 1940s and Pier Luigi and his older brother, Sergio, joined in the 1970s. Sergio died in December 2013 at the age of 65, shortly after the sale went through.

Since then, Bernard Arnault, the billionaire owner of LVMH, has installed his son, Antoine, 38, as Loro Piana chairman and appointed a French CEO. Pier Luigi stayed on as deputy chairman, fulfilling what he says is his ""duty"" to smooth the transition to new ownership. Loro Piana's longtime chief operating officer quit last year.

The Loro Piana family's continued involvement isn't guaranteed. Put and call options on its 20 percent stake expire this year, meaning LVMH can still ask members to sell it or the Loro Pianas can push LVMH to buy it. Pier Luigi says he doesn't know what's going to happen. Discussions are ongoing but LVMH would welcome the Loro Piana family staying as a shareholder, says Antoine Arnault.

“My feeling is that they want to continue to be part of the capital,” Arnault says of the Loro Piana family. “What I feel our clients want is stability.”

While the management shuffle was to be expected — LVMH replaced the top brass at Bulgari after purchasing the jeweller in 2011 — Loro Piana faces a luxury market Deutsche Bank has described as the most uncertain in nearly a decade. Global luxury sales will expand at best by 2 percent in 2016, making it the industry's second-weakest year since 2009, estimates Bain & Co.

Some companies are closing stores: Loro Piana shuttered two locations, in Italy and South Korea, in the first quarter. Others are reviewing how much they charge customers and what they sell, as terror attacks and elections diminish the feel-good factor that drives consumers to buy luxury goods.

LVMH doesn’t plan to change Loro Piana’s strategy of “bringing the best that nature can offer in terms of luxury for your lifestyle,” said CEO Matthieu Brisset — who is leaving to take another role in LVMH, the conglomerate said Monday. Starting in September, he will be replaced by Fabio d'Angelantonio, who has worked for sunglasses maker Luxottica since 2005.

Because Loro Piana made-to-order suits can fetch tens of thousands of euros, there's a misconception about the brand, Brisset said, noting that it also sells cashmere sweaters for 800 euros. “It’s a question largely of communication.”

For Autumn/Winter 2015, Loro Piana introduced products online whose prices were 30 percent lower than the cheapest items the previous season, according to marketing consultant ContactLab. The $1,650 median price of the collection was down 2 percent compared with spring-summer online, ContactLab estimates.

Widening the price range online is a tactic LVMH has used more aggressively at other fashion and leather goods brands it owns, notably Louis Vuitton and Givenchy. The plan to offer a more balanced selection of products in Loro Piana stores may lead to selling more items at the lower end of the price range. But it doesn't mean the company will be making cheaper cashmere sweaters, Brisset says.

For Pier Luigi Loro Piana, the important thing is that quality doesn't suffer: “You don’t have to make things which are just expensive,” he said. Still, ""I don’t see a possibility for Loro Piana to be successful changing the strategy. The strategy should remain the same.”

LVMH to operate at Shilla I'Park duty-free shop - The Korea Herald,"Wed, 04 May 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiNmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmtvcmVhaGVyYWxkLmNvbS92aWV3LnBocD91ZD0yMDE2MDUwNDAwMDc3NNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Shilla I’Park Duty Free has become the first of last year’s newly-licensed duty-free stores in Korea to house the world’s largest luxury goods maker LVMH Moet-Hennessy Louis Vuitton, according to Hotel Shilla Tuesday.



The two companies recently agreed to launch 20 LVMH-owned brands, including Louis Vuitton, Dior, Bvlgari, Tag Heuer, Givenchy and Marc Jacobs, at the Shilla I’Park Duty Free store in Hyundai I’Park Mall in Yongsan.





The store’s operator HDC Shilla Duty Free — a fifty-fifty joint venture between Hotel Shilla and Hyundai Development — will begin constructing and setting up the new brand shops in the coming months, with plans to open all the shops by March 2017.Shilla’s success in getting LVMH to join its new duty-free store was largely spearheaded by president and CEO of Hotel Shilla Lee Boo-jin, who is also the daughter of Samsung Group chairman Lee Kun-hee.Lee played a pivotal role in convincing LVMH chairman Bernard Arnault of HDC Shilla Duty Free’s exclusive locational benefits and high growth potential, according to Hotel Shilla. Arnault was in Seoul last month to participate in a luxury conference.“As the very first among the newly-launched duty-free stores to secure participation from LVMH, HDC Shilla Duty Free will continue to offer our consumers more diverse products and the best services,” a Hotel Shilla spokesperson told The Korea Herald.Last year, five new duty-free operators, including HDC Shilla, won licenses to open new tax-free outlets in Seoul. Since then, they have engaged in a fierce competition to bring in global luxury houses like LVMH to their new shops.The operation of big-name luxury brands is crucial for Korean duty-free businesses as they are key to attracting big, high-end spenders at home and abroad.“HDC Shilla Duty Free hopes that other famous luxury brands such as Prada, Gucci, Hermes and Chanel will consider joining,” the Hotel Shilla representative said.By Sohn Ji-young ( jys@heraldcorp.com","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9834293127059937}",neutral,0.9834293127059937,0

The hidden forces in yachting - Yacht Harbour,"Thu, 19 May 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8veWFjaHRoYXJib3VyLmNvbS9uZXdzL3RoZS1oaWRkZW4tZm9yY2VzLWluLXlhY2h0aW5nLTc1ONIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"70% of companies in the yachting sector describe themselves as leading according to a study performed by Yacht Harbour on a sample of over 100 companies. It can therefore be hard for customers to differentiate at first glance the real financial position of companies and their scale.





Following a very active past 20 years in the mergers and acquisitions space in the yachting industry, some behemoths have emerged, controlling a large portion of the market and shaping the industry moving forward. Some high-profile individuals and corporations have also become involved in the superyacht industry in recent years. We have therefore investigated some of the most powerful corporations and individuals in the yachting space.





Dalian Wanda Group









Princess AVK





Annual revenue: $39.47 billion (2014)





Chairman & Founder: Wang Jianlin









Largest commercial real estate operator in China and world's largest cinema chain operator, Wanda Group was founded in 1988 by Wang Jianlin. The company has today 634 billion yuans in assets and manages over 26 million square meters of hotel property. In 2013, the company decided to purchase UK-based yacht manufacturer, Sunseeker.





Having gone through losses of 9 million pounds in 2009, Sunseeker restructured its debt and was taken over by FL Partners, an Irish private equity company. Sunseeker was sold in 2013 to the Wanda Group for around 300 million pounds according to the Financial Times .





LVMH

Annual revenue: $35.6 billion (2015)





Chairman & CEO: Bernard Arnault









Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton, better known as the French luxury goods conglomerate, LVMH, is perhaps not so surprisingly also a player in the superyacht industry. In 2008, L Capital, the company's investment arm, purchased Princess Yachts in a deal worth 200 million pounds according to Reuters, with support from the Calyon investment bank.





Later that year, the conglomerate strengthened their position in the company with the purchase of Royal Van Lent, part of the Feadship organization, for a reported sum between 200-400 million euros. In 2007, Royal Van Lent had posted sales of 100 million euros.





Gavio Group

Annual turnaround: €2.2 billion (2012)









Gruppo Gavio, a large Italian corporation whose main business lies in motorway concessions with the company operating over 1400 kilometers of motorways in Italy, also has interests in the yachting industry. In 2012, Bejamino Gavio led an acquisition of the iconic Italian Baglietto shipyard for a sum of €18.5 million. The shipyard had been through some rough waters during the financial crisis resulting in 73 million euros of negative equity in 2009.





The group further consolidated its position in the sector by purchasing Cerri Cantieri Navali, a few months before the Baglietto deal, and by later acquiring US-based Bertram in 2015.





Privinvest Group

Current owners: Akram & Iskandar Safa









Privinvest Group is one of Europe's largest maritime corporations which is involved in naval manufacturing and is also involved in the superyacht industry. Founded by the Safa brothers, Privinvest purchased Constructions mécaniques de Normandie (CMN) based in Cherbourg, France in 1992. The company then managed to turn around the fledging shipyard with new orders from the Middle East according to the Independent





In 2007, the group funded 30% of the Abu Dhabi MAR company which ventured into shipbuilding through ADMShipyards and worked on the 141-meter Yas . In 2009, Privinvest continued to consolidate its position in the sector by acquiring German shipyard Nobiskrug.





Azimut-Benetti Group









I Dynasty © Superyachts Monaco





Maximum recorded asset net worth: €300 million (2011)





Current owner: Paolo Vitelli





Brands: Benetti, Azimut





Azimut was established in the early 1970s by Paolo Vitelli as a dealership of Amerglass boats. The company then evolved into yacht manufacturing by building its first 43ft boat. It later delivered Failaka, the first 30-metre fibreglass yacht ever built, to a Kuwaiti prince. In 1985, Azimut took over the Fratelli Benetti boatyard in Viareggio, setting the roots for the group. The company later started collaborating with young designer, Stefano Righini, which would bring the Azimut lines the company is known for today.





The company acquired the Gobbi shipyard in 2001 which now produced the group's Atlantis range from 10m to 18m. In 2004, the group acquired Fraser Yachts, a large yacht brokerage company. It later developed Marina di Varazze and the Royal Yacht Club in Moscow. By 2011, the group's net assets grew to €300 million according to this presentation with a turnover of €600 million, a significant cut on its €1 billion turnover in 2008 according to the Financial Times .





Ferretti Group









Chopi Chopi © Yacht Harbour

Maximum recorded value: € 1.5 billion (2007)





Current owners: Weichai Group, Royal Bank of Scotland









Ferretti was established in 1968 as the first marine division of Alessandro and Norberto Ferretti's family business. In 1971, the company delivered its first wooden motor-sailer and by 1982 it began producing boats for sport fishing with a flybridge. By 1996, the group decided to expand into a larger range and set up Custom Line, a division meant to operate in the growing 26-40m range. In following years, the company multiplied acquisitions buying CNA in 1998, CRN in 1999, Riva in 2000, Mochi Craft in 2001 and Itama in 2004.





As the company was preparing for an initial public offering (IPO) after having been acquired in a leveraged buyout by Candover Investments which put the Group's value at €1.5 billion in 2007, the financial crisis led to a significant drop in sales. As a result, the Group had to restructure debt and its creditors, led by the Royal Bank of Scotland, converted a portion of their €1.2 billion debt into equity according to Bloomberg





Ferretti Group was eventually sold to Weichai Group, a state-owned Chinese company, the largest maker of bulldozer's in China.

Hard Candy Founder Dineh Mohajer Has One Beauty Regret - W Magazine,"Mon, 30 May 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndtYWdhemluZS5jb20vc3RvcnkvZGluZWgtbW9oYWplci1oYXJkLWNhbmR5LXNtaXRoLWN1bHQtYmVhdXR50gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"When Dineh Mohajer launched Hard Candy in 1995, her line of pastel-shaded nail polishes became an overnight success. Women of all ages fell for the playful shades—including Alicia Silverstone, whose nails, adorned with the pale blue “Sky” caught the eye of David Letterman when she appeared on his show. Mohajer sold the brand to LVMH in 1999, but re-entered the beauty biz in 2014 with Smith + Cult, which could be described as an older sister to Hard Candy. Having begun with polishes, Smith + Cult recently added lip glosses and is expanding to eye shadows, liners and mascara as well as full-on matte lip color this Fall. Here, Mohajer talks about how she went from pre-med to the Barney’s counter and spilled her opinions on various beauty topics as well as what’s in her own makeup bag.

How old were you when you started Hard Candy? 21.

How old were you when you knew you wanted to create a nail polish line? Never. I was a biochemistry major at USC. I was dead set on becoming a plastic surgeon.

Wow! That’s quite a leap from nail polish. Ok, let’s go back to when you were, say, ten. What did you want to be back then? …Eleven…? I mean, I loved fashion, but I don’t think I realized that you could do something in fashion for a living. I grew up in Michigan, which is not exactly Seventh Avenue. All the dads in my family were physicians. Iranian physicians, so that’s what we all grew up thinking we’d become. I didn’t have any concept that you could work in fashion. I remember the first time I came to New York. I was like, “Oh my god, where am I?”

So, when did the pre-med decision get put aside? Well, organic chemistry did me in. It doesn’t matter where you go to college, that class is HARD. It’s like the weed-out class. I was surrounded by tutors. My summers would consist of studying for the MCATS six hours a day AND doing these DNA extractions in a basement of a pathology department in a hospital. See, you need to get your name on a published paper to get into med school. I think it was a backlash to all of that.

But why nail polish? Well, I was at USC, and I saw this world of supermodels in LA and I thought, “I have to do something to stand out.” I thought I had to create something to be cool. So in the corner of a nail salon, they had a bunch of bright, used up, nasty crusty colors. I mixed them with Essie white and I got all those pastels. It wasn’t brain surgery.

But no one else had done it. No one else had done it, but I did it because I had this weird underlying motivation! I wore it and five people accosted me. And my sister said, “You should sell it.” So we sat down and came up with names together. We liked Hard Candy the best. That was in March. The line launched in May. By the time August came around, it was time to register for classes and the brand was in full distribution.

Man. That is fast. Meanwhile, it was time to register for the next semester at USC. I had three more classes in upper divisions to go, but I never finished. I’d never be able to go back and do them now. How could I do an upper division science class now?

You’re saying this to me presuming I know what “upper division science” means. But I’ll take a stab and guess that it’s REALLY HARD. REALLY HARD.

But you know what? No one cares. I know, but some people are like, “You should go back and finish.”

That’s the older generation saying it. Yes. That’s my dad saying it.

Please. I’ve got two words for you: Bill Gates. Those are the hardest classes. I’d have to take calculus now. Whatever.

The only calculus I’m familiar with is the tartar on my teeth. Hey, I’ve got an idea: Why don’t you name a shade “Calculus” and be done with it? Ok, time for the beauty questions! What’s your first beauty memory? My mom had all this makeup. Like these nine thousand eye shadows that they’d sell in those huge palettes at Bonwit Teller. And she had this really lame loose powder called Starlight. I’d just put all this makeup all over my face. But I’ve got another one. When we were selling our house in Michigan, the prospective buyers were walking through the house. I remember I had to sit on my bed because I had all these little dots of red nail polish all over my bedspread. I thought they weren’t going to buy the house if they saw my bedspread, so I sat on it to cover up the dots to hide it.

How old were you? Maybe 5 or 6.

That is pretty adorable. What was your worst beauty blunder? You’re looking at it.

You’re silly. Tell me. For real? A botched nose job. It was big and huge and it had a hook. In retrospect, I wish I’d kept my original nose.

Coulda, shoulda, woulda. ..What beauty products are in your purse? Tampons.

That’s not really a beauty product. [Pulls takes a small cosmetics bag out of her purse] Serge Lutens lip pencil, By Terry pressed powder, Kevyn Aucoin The Precision Brow Pencil in Dark Brunette, Cle de Peau concealer, SkinMedica Total Defense + Repair Broad Spectrum Sunscreen, Kuumba Persian Garden, Visine, Smith + Cult The Tainted in Linger Sigh.

What’s your skin care routine? SkinMedica TNS Essential Serum, Topix Glycolic 10%, SkinMedica Dermal Repair Cream. At night, I use .1% Retin A.

And your hair? Oribe’s Gold Lust line.

What beauty professional can you not live without? I’ve got two: Chris McMillan and Tracy Cunningham.

What beauty trend do you not get? I have a problem with airbrushed social media narcissism. What’s yours?

That little wing of black liquid eyeliner. All the kids do it, and I can’t stand it. And I agree, I’m seeing more and more of that airbrushed look. I was at a work event the other day and this blogger, who was in her mid-twenties sat near me and her skin had no pores! She looked like an avatar! How did she not have pores?

No, she was just wearing SO MUCH PRODUCT. It’s the weirdest thing when they do that. Don’t they feel dumb with that much makeup on?

Oh my god, no. They feel empowered. But it looks so weird! Don’t you agree?

Yes, but that’s when I feel like we’re starting to sound like the older generation… Is this a symptom of being older or are we just thinking it looks gross?

Good point__. Finally, you’ve created two hugely successful beauty brands. What’s the difference between Hard Candy and Smith + Cult?__ Hard Candy was about a pivotal chapter from childhood. Smith + Cult is a diary of a beauty junkie, chronicling a lifetime of beauty experiences.

Well, keep on chronicling, lady.

Co-founder of Ku De Ta club goes to court in new twist - AsiaOne,"Mon, 23 May 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFzaWFvbmUuY29tL3NpbmdhcG9yZS9jby1mb3VuZGVyLWt1LWRlLXRhLWNsdWItZ29lcy1jb3VydC1uZXctdHdpc3TSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The former Ku De Ta club, which opened in 2010 at Marina Bay Sands to much fanfare, is at the centre of yet another legal dispute.

Mr Chris Au, a Singapore-based Hong Kong businessman who co-founded the club, since renamed Ce La Vi, has sued his former business partners for conspiring to steal his rightful share of the club.

On Jan 30, 2014, French luxury group LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton reportedly paid $100 million for a 51 per cent stake in the swish club on the 57th floor of Marina Bay Sands' SkyPark. The purchase was made through LVMH's investment arm L Capital.

In court papers filed in the High Court last week, Mr Au said he should have received more than $33.7 million from the deal but was denied because of ""a conspiracy... designed to deprive (him) of his shareholding and rights in Ku De Ta, a company that he founded and made successful"".

He named a staggering 10 defendants in his writ of summons, including four former business partners and L Capital.

The Singapore permanent resident said in court papers that he held 35.5 per cent of Kudeta BVI - which owned the Ku De Ta Singapore nightclub - and that there was an agreement to buy out his interest for $33.7 million using funds from L Capital's acquisition.

But on Jan 29, 2014, a day before the acquisition, Mr Au said his former business partners got the Hong Kong court to freeze his assets without his knowledge.

The court order was served on him only a week later, said Mr Au, adding that he would not have proceeded with the acquisition had he known of the court order.

He said L Capital was aware of the court order to freeze his assets, but ""intentionally and wilfully chose not (to) warn or inform"" him.

As a result of the actions by his former business partners and L Capital, he said he ""has not received a single cent that he is entitled to"".

The rift between Mr Au and the club's new owners continued even after the club sale, the court papers showed. For example, he charged that he was wrongfully removed as a board director in July last year after he warned the board of mismanagement of the club. Examples included appointing a chief executive without relevant experience and failure to comply with ""basic corporate governance requirements such as holding quarterly board meetings"".

He also accused his four business partners of unlawfully conspiring to break into his laptop and hacking into his e-mail account to steal personal and business information.

The lawsuit is the latest twist in a high-profile saga that started in 2014.

Barely after Ku De Ta was taken over by LVMH, shareholders began waging a legal battle in Hong Kong over the distribution of proceeds.

Shareholders Komal Patel - also known as Karl Patel - and Harilaos Apostolides claim in Hong Kong court papers that they each hold 24.17 per cent of Kudeta BVI. They also claim that Mr Au owns the same amount, a figure that Mr Au is challenging.

The Hong Kong trial is set for later this year. But even before the trial, Mr Au already had two run-ins with Justice Kevin Zervos.

In November last year, Mr Au asked that the judge recuse himself because of professional links with Mr Apostolides' brother, but the judge declined.

In August 2014, the same judge said Mr Au had given false evidence in Singapore about his interest in Ku De Ta and it merited referral to the Attorney-General's Chambers (AGC) in Singapore.

But when contacted last week, an AGC spokesman said: ""There appears to be no record of a referral from the Hong Kong High Court.""
