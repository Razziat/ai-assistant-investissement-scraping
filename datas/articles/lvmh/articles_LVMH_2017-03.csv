"Losing Sparkle: DeBeers, LVMH Joint Venture Fizzles - WWD","Wed, 22 Mar 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vd3dkLmNvbS9mZWF0dXJlL2x2bWgtZGUtYmVlcnMtcGFydG5lcnNoaXAtc3BsaW50ZXJzLTEwODUwMjIzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LONDON — First the fanfare, then the fizzle. De Beers Group said Wednesday it had purchased its partner LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton‘s 50 percent stake in their much-touted jewelry joint venture De Beers Diamond Jewellers.

While observers would argue the investment was a minor one for the French luxury giant — and that it was high time for LVMH to dispose of its stake — the partnership clearly never worked.

Bruce Cleaver, chief executive officer of De Beers, said by having full ownership, De Beers will be able to grow its offer and achieve further integration of operations across the retail network, which includes 32 stores in key markets such as London, Paris and a new location in New York’s Madison Avenue.

The company has been expanding its business in China and, since 2015, showcasing designs from its high-jewelry collections during Paris’ Haute Couture week as an official member of the Fédération Française de la Couture du Prêt-à-Porter des Couturiers et des Créateurs de Mode.

“By fully integrating the De Beers Diamond Jewellers brand and store network, it will enable us to deliver an even more differentiated diamond offering, alongside our fast-growing diamond brand, Forevermark,” said Cleaver.

De Beers Diamond Jewellers operates as a stand-alone retail business, while Forevermark diamonds are carried by third-party retailers.

Following the announcement, François Delage, ceo of De Beers Diamond Jewellers, talked about “a shared heritage and strong brand link” with De Beers Group. “By being fully part of the group, we will benefit even more from the unique diamond culture, established since 1888.”

While the jewelry retail brand continues to expand, the partnership between the two corporate behemoths was almost always unlikely to be a long-lasting one despite the bold and optimistic projections made for the business when it launched. Sources familiar with both parties said the LVMH and De Beers boards never gelled, and were worlds away from one another culturally.

“On one hand, you had the rough-and-tumble miners who are used to calling the shots in their industry. On the other, you had LVMH, which is all about doing things in a luxury way. De Beers didn’t understand how to market a luxury jewelry brand. Strategies were difficult to execute. The decision should not come as a surprise,” said a source familiar with the venture.

De Beers and LVMH unveiled their partnership in January 2001, setting ambitious goals to turn the De Beers name into the world’s leading prestige jewelry brand.

At the time, the South African mining group was looking to fuel demand for its rough diamonds. It was also wrestling with antitrust issues because of its role as the largest supplier of rough diamonds, and hoping to move into new areas of the business with an experienced retail partner.

Meanwhile, luxury titan Bernard Arnault wanted to expand LVMH’s watch and jewelry division and grab a bigger share of the diamond jewelry market, which, at the time was worth an estimated $60 billion.

“It is our strategy to build one of the largest [jewelry] companies in the world in 10 years. But even a fraction of a percent of $60 billion is quite a lot of money,” said Arnault during a press conference unveiling the venture.

At the time, LVMH’s watch and jewelry portfolio included Tag Heuer, Ebel, Chaumet, Zenith and Fred. Since then, it has expanded to include Bulgari, a big-name jewelry brand that made De Beers Diamond Jewellers look like a sideline business.

The venture was equally owned by the partners with an initial investment of $400 million made over the first five years, split equally. Opening De Beers freestanding stores and introducing high-jewelry collections by the brand were among the first steps taken. Arnault was also focused on building the brand’s image in order to transform De Beers into a consumer name.

Iman, alongside models Erin O’ Connor and Amy Wesson, were the first faces of the brand, and featured in a campaign shot by Nick Knight in the summer of 2002. The Somalian-born model, who also inspired the inaugural collection, was chosen by the brand for representing different facets of a woman’s life, from mother to wife to businesswoman.

The relationship between Iman and De Beers sparked controversy and the two parted ways after the model’s two-year contract expired. Iman became a target of criticism by the group NGO Survival International for appearing in the ads. Survival claimed that De Beers’ mining was forcing the relocation of the indigenous Bushmen of Botswana.

The business early on saw a revolving door of designers and ceo’s as strategies seemed to shift repeatedly. De Beers’ first store on Piccadilly in London was massive — too large for a store selling only diamond jewelry — while it also opened a two-floor store on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan, right near Cartier.

Meanwhile, the venture continued to change its design aesthetic, one moment emphasizing cutting-edge styles, another large stones and then another focusing on engagement rings, the core market for diamonds.

On Wednesday, analysts gave a thumbs-up to LVMH’s decision to sell its stake, saying it was a long time coming.

“LVMH has finally pulled the plug on their joint venture with De Beers. This originated at a time when LVMH did not have any branded jewelry of their own,” said Luca Solca, managing director at Exane BNP Paribas. “The situation is very different today, as they own one of the megabrands in this space: Bulgari. It seems appropriate, therefore, to turn the page on this, and relegate it to the ‘experiments that didn’t work’ pile.”

Julian Easthope, a luxury goods analyst at Barclays Capital, said the De Beers venture only represented a fragment of LVMH’s business, so the deal is of little consequence. “It was a joint venture between the two [parties], so not fully consolidated in the LVMH accounts, and it was a tiny part of one of [LVMH’s] smaller divisions, their watch and jewelry division. Therefore it makes sense for LVMH to tidy up their portfolio,” said Easthope.

In its 2016 annual report, De Beers’ parent Anglo-American said De Beers has a global leadership position in diamonds, producing around a third of the world’s rough diamonds, by value. It said De Beers “seeks to stimulate consumer demand for diamonds through its Forevermark brand and De Beers Diamond Jewellers,” a retail joint venture with LVMH."
"Here Are Your Eight LVMH Prize Finalists, Including Atlein and Molly Goddard - W Magazine","Tue, 28 Mar 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndtYWdhemluZS5jb20vc3RvcnkvbHZtaC1wcml6ZS1maW5hbGlzdHMtYXRsZWluLW1vbGx5LWdvZGRhcmTSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"And then there were eight.

Ambush, Atlein, Cecile Bahnsen, Jahnkoy, Kozaburo, Marine Serre, Molly Goddard and Nabil Nayal have been named the eight finalists for the LVMH Prize for Young Fashion Designers. The group was narrowed down from the initial 21 designers shortlisted for the coveted prize—which includes €300,000 and a year of mentorship from executives at the luxury conglomerate—by a group of “international fashion experts” after seeing the collections first-hand during a special presentation during Paris Fashion Week. Among the experts: Kendall Jenner, Karlie Kloss, Patrick Demarchelier, Miroslava Duma, and Linda Fargo.

This year’s class of nominees includes five traditional womenswear designers, with two focused on menswear (Jahnkoy and Kozaburo) and one unisex label (Ambush). This year also marks the first time a Danish designer (Cecile Bahnsen) has made it to the final eight of the international competition. Also a notable inclusion: London-based Nabil el-Nayal, who was shortlisted two years ago, in 2015.

Anderson, Phoebe Philo, Riccardo Tisci, Maria Grazia Chiuri, Nicolas Ghesquière, and Karl Lagerfeld, on June 16th at the Fondation Louis Vuitton in Paris. The winner will be announced the same day.

In the meantime, a refresher on each of the final eight:

Ambush

Originally founded as a jewelry line, designer Yoon Ahn transformed her collection, based in Tokyo, into a full-fledged line of unisex clothing that has already caught the eye of Louis Vuitton, Maison Kitsuné, Sacai, and Undercover, all of whom have done collaborations with the brand.

Atlein

Stocked by Net-A-Porter, Bergdorf Goodman, and Neiman Marcus, among other top retailers, Paris-based designer Antonin Tron‘s line of streamlined wardrobe staples has quickly become a go-to for French It-girls—and those who want to dress like them.

Celcilie Bahnsen

Upon graduating from the Royal College of Art in London, the Danish designer developed her eponymous contemporary collection which finds inspiration from traditional techniques including quilting, patchwork, and appliqué embroidery.

Jahnkoy

Based in New York, Russian designer Maria Kazakova describes her menswear line as a “return to craft,” which includes intricate and delicate embroidery, beading, weaving and crochet on each piece.

Kozaburo

With experience working for Thom Browne under his belt, Japanese menswear designer Kozaburo Akasaka has a knack for mixing classic pieces with something modern, citing inspiration from the ’90s music he grew up listening to.

Marine Serre

A graduate of Alexander McQueen, Christian Dior, Maison Martin Margiela, and Balenciaga, the French womenswear designer has crafted an aesthetic all her own that incorporates unexpected silhouettes with bright, primary colors.

Molly Goddard

A darling of London Fashion Week, Goddard embraces the feminine side of fashion, stemming from her signature frills and ruffles.

Nabil Nayal

Also a 2015 LVMH Prize semi-finalist, the London-based designer’s dramatic, often theatrical pieces have been worn by Lady Gaga, Rihanna, and Florence Welch.

Perfumer Speaks on Rare LVMH Acquisition | BoF - The Business of Fashion,"Mon, 20 Mar 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzb2ZmYXNoaW9uLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy9iZWF1dHkvYXMtbHZtaC1hY3F1aXJlcy1tYWlzb24tZnJhbmNpcy1rdXJrZGppYW4tcGVyZnVtZXItc3BlYWtzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS, France — LVMH has acquired a majority stake in Maison Francis Kurkdijan, the independent perfumer launched in 2009.

Speaking to BoF shortly after the deal was signed, Marc Chaya, the brand’s CEO and co-founder, said: “We thought it would be an amazing opportunity to anchor everything we have done over the past nine years and concentrate on continuing to drive the business with greater experience and greater means.”

The eponymous perfumer added: “If there’s a product I can’t do myself because we don’t have the know-how, it means that I can have an idea and LVMH will have the expertise to explore new territories and products. I’m not afraid of being bigger, but I think you need the right people to implement what I am creating.”

While financial terms of the deal were not disclosed, both Chaya and Kurkdjian will remain shareholders in the company.

I'm not afraid of being bigger, but I think you need the right people to implement what I am creating.

The announcement is significant in that beauty acquisitions by LVMH are few and far between. It does, however, follow a string of acquisitions by Estée Lauder and L'Oréal which have been investing in smaller, independent beauty and cosmetics brands.

Maison Francis Kurkdjian was launched with a line of 25 products and a boutique in Paris. ""Marc and I never thought we were niche,"" says Kurkdijan, who created perfumes for established brands, and is the 'nose' behind some of the industry's best-selling scents, including Jean Paul Gaultier's 'Le Male', Narciso Rodriguez's 'Narciso For Her' and Versace's 'Jeans Couture Glam'.

“When you start a company, you start small,"" he continued. ""We were privately funded from the two of us, as well as a third party, so it was small because we had limited resources. If I create a perfume, it doesn’t matter if it goes into one bottle or ten thousand; it’s the same thing. At some point, I’d hoped that we could get bigger and the idea is to do that under the umbrella of LVMH.""

Today, Maison Francis Kurkdjian has two stores in Paris, three in Taiwan, one in Malaysia and one in Dubai. It is stocked in more than 40 countries worldwide, with more than 30 counters and a presence in almost 500 retailers, including Bergdorf Goodman, Neiman Marcus, Selfridges, Liberty, Harrods and John Lewis.

“Department stores are our main destinations,” said Chaya, a former partner at Ernst & Young in Paris. “They want to create an opportunity for independent brands to grow, and finally the customer wants to have different experiences of perfume and that means the independent market has grown in proportion.”

Maison Francis Kurkdjian, whose largest market is the US, registered retail sales of about $25 million in 2015, up 40 percent versus 2014.

Karen Grant, global beauty industry analyst at NPD, says the market for cult fragrance-only brands, such as Byredo and Le Labo, is growing by 50 percent annually, prompting a flurry of acquisitions by companies like Esteé Lauder, which bought Le Labo and Editions de Parfums Frédéric Malle in 2014, and Manzanita Capital, owner of Diptyque and SpaceNK, which bought Byredo in 2013.

Profits from LVMH’s perfumes and cosmetics division grew by 5 per cent in 2016 to 551 million euros, from 524 million euros.

Report: LVMH to Launch E-Commerce Site for All Brands - National Jeweler,"Fri, 10 Mar 2017 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5hdGlvbmFsamV3ZWxlci5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvNDk1Ni1yZXBvcnQtbHZtaC10by1sYXVuY2gtZS1jb21tZXJjZS1zaXRlLWZvci1hbGwtYnJhbmRz0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Paris--It looks like luxury conglomerate LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton is getting ready to jump back into the e-commerce game.



According to a report from the Financial Times, the luxury goods company plans to launch a website in May branded as Le Bon Marché, which is the department store that the company acquired in 1984.



The website will offer not only brands from LVMH’s own stable--the company owns Bulgari, TAG Heuer and Hublot, among others--but also non-LVMH brands, making it competition for other online luxury websites such as Net-a-Porter and Farfetch. It is unclear at this time if the site will operate on a wholesale or marketplace model with these other brands.



When asked about it by National Jeweler, an LVMH spokesperson declined to comment on the report.



The Financial Times story also noted that the move would be the first from the luxury goods company since it hired Ian Rogers from Apple as chief digital officer in 2015. While it could be considered something of a late start, it also indicates the company’s renewed focus on the digital space.



If and when the multi-brand site does launch, it won’t be LVMH’s first foray into online retailing.



In 2000, the company launched eLuxury.com, selling its own apparel, accessories and children’s collections, but shuttered the e-commerce part of the operation nine years later, when many of its brands began developing their own online presence (the 70 creative houses under its umbrella currently have the ability to create their own digital strategies.) LVMH relaunched eLuxury.com as a ditigal channel, Nowness.



In its most recently released financials, LVMH reported 5 percent year-over-year growth in its Watches & Jewelry division in 2016, with sales of its watch and jewelry brands totaling $3.72 billion last year, compared with $3.55 billion in 2015.



Overall, the company said revenue was up 5 percent to $39.83 billion, with profit increasing 6 percent.



While the company said the American market “remains on a good track,” chairman and CEO Bernard Arnault also warned of possible trouble ahead in the luxury sector, noting it is due for another downturn."

LVMH certainly has the portfolio to embark on a project of this scale, owning 16 fashion and leathergoods houses, including , Christian and ; seven watches and jewellery labels; and nine perfume brands. The giant French luxury group had a record year 2016, posting €37.6 billion in sales (up 5% compared to 2015).



This luxury virtual department store will reportedly go into a test phase sometime in April or May before an official public launch in June, according to our source. When contacted by Fashion Network about the project, LVMH said ""no comment"".

This platform will host both the group’s many brands as well as other designer and affordable luxury labels. LVMH already owns Bon Marché and the duty free retail chain, which should give it enough synergy to involve other brands with which it already has a relationship.



In September 2015, LVMH poached Ian Rogers from , naming him Chief Digital Officer, an indication of digital’s growing importance in world of luxury.







Luxury groups were initially wary about the Internet but have been revising their strategies for several years now, with varying degrees of success. Italian luxury label Tod's also announced a plan to create a multi-brand e-shop, but was not able to bring the project to fruition.



For its part, created a joint venture with Italian fashion platform in 2012 to manage the e-commerce sites of its brands. In 2015, Yoox, which also operates LVMH brand 's online store, merged with Net-a-Porter, a subsidiary of the Group, giving birth to an e-commerce giant.



More and more brands are now signing up with this luxury e-commerce platform, which gives them much greater exposure."
LVMH Purchases Maison Francis Kurkdjian - WWD,"Mon, 20 Mar 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3dkLmNvbS9mZWF0dXJlL2x2bWgtYWNxdWlzaXRpb24tbWFpc29uLWZyYW5jaXMta3Vya2RqaWFuLWZyYWdyYW5jZS0xMDg0Nzg0Ni_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS – LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton is the latest group to jump on the accelerating niche fragrance bandwagon, with its acquisition of Maison Francis Kurkdjian.

The French luxury conglomerate said on Monday that it had purchased a majority share in the house created in 2009 by perfumer Francis Kurkdjian and Marc Chaya. Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed.

The news confirms a report WWD published on Nov. 14, 2016.

“Motivated by a shared vision of French perfume making and the creativity that inspires it, LVMH and Maison Francis Kurkdjian have announced their association in order to jointly pursue the long-term development of the fragrance house,” the companies said jointly in a statement, adding that growth will be pursued especially abroad.

“Their avant-garde spirit and the quality of their creations give this fragrance house great potential and a promising future,” said Bernard Arnault, chairman and chief executive officer of LVMH.

Maison Francis Kurkdjian was launched with a line of 25 products and a boutique in Paris. The wide-ranging brand takes a holistic approach to beauty, with a “fragrance wardrobe” — involving everything from eaux de toilette to scented bubbles and textile cleaning products — meant for perfuming a person’s life 24 hours a day, seven days a week.

Today, Maison Francis Kurkdjian has two stores in Paris, three in Taiwan, one in Malaysia and another in Dubai. Worldwide, it is in more than 40 countries, with more than 30 counters and a presence in almost 500 retailers, including Bergdorf Goodman, Aedes Perfumery, C.O. Bigelow Apothecary and Neiman Marcus in New York.

The perfume label, whose largest market is the U.S., registered retail sales of about $25 million in 2015, up 40 percent versus 2014.

Maison Francis Kurkdjian in January 2016 became a member of Comité Colbert, the association promoting French luxury and know-how.

Kurkdjian is one of the most well-known perfumers of today, having created blockbuster scents such as Jean Paul Gaultier’s Le Male and Narciso Rodriguez’s Narciso for Her. The perfumer has also conceived perfumes for some of LVMH’s own brands, including Acqua di Parma, Christian Dior, Guerlain and Kenzo.

Kurkdjian, who was made a Knight of Arts and Letters in France in 2008, stated: “I have always championed my personal conception of beauty and respect for the métier of perfumer-creator. Maison Francis Kurkdjian lets me freely express my inspirations. LVMH clearly understands the nature of our maison, and the group’s approach to custom-crafted creativity guarantees that our distinctive identity will thrive for the long term.”

Chaya is a former partner at Ernst & Young in Paris. He and Kurkdjian will continue at Maison Francis Kurkdjian in their current roles of ceo and creative director, respectively. They will also remain shareholders in the company.

LVMH’s acquisition is the latest move in the race among multinationals to snap up hot niche beauty labels as the trend for premium products keeps rising. Luxury and super-luxury brands also tend to offer solid growth rates, and they present an alternative for some big companies wanting to move from celebrity or fashion brands.

The Estée Lauder Cos. Inc. has been a frontrunner in the charge for niche labels. In February 2016 it acquired By Kilian, while in 2014 it scooped up Éditions de Parfums Frédéric Malle and Le Labo.

In early January 2016, Puig purchased Penhaligon’s and L’Artisan Parfumeur. And last June, L’Oréal acquired Atelier Cologne.

While niche fragrance brands keep cropping up, there are not many today with enough critical mass to put them on the radar of big companies. Some privately held fragrance brands in Europe currently ripe for the picking — though none with a visible for-sale sign at present — include Creed, Memo and Juliette Has a Gun.

LVMH, which was a pioneer in acquiring indie beauty brands in the late Nineties, has currently been more actively developing niche brands through its Kendo division, which functions as an incubator for products that become retailed in the LVMH-owned Sephora perfumery chain, among various outposts.

Other perfume and cosmetics brands at LVMH, which ranked eleventh in the WWD Beauty Inc Top 100 listing of beauty makers for 2015 — with sales of 4.52 billion euros, or $5.01 billion at average exchange — include Christian Dior, Guerlain, Acqua di Parma and Ole Henriksen.

The 24-year-old, who is joint chief executive officer of the German luggage maker, welcomed guests including his father, luxury magnate Bernard Arnault, mother Hélène, brother Frédéric and half-siblings Delphine and Antoine, as well as their respective partners, Xavier Niel and Natalia Vodianova.

“We’re superproud,” he said as guests including Karl Lagerfeld, Bella Hadid, Sidney Toledano, Virgil Abloh, Remo Ruffini, Mario Testino, Caroline Vreeland, Eugenie Niarchos, Bianca Brandolini and Alexia Niedzielski stopped by to pay their respects.

LVMH in January completed the acquisition of an 80 percent stake in Rimowa, making Arnault joint ceo of the firm alongside Dieter Morszeck, the grandson of the founder. The towering young executive has been playing a more prominent role at LVMH lately, accompanying Bernard Arnault to New York for a meeting with Donald Trump in January.

It appears there was more than one Rimowa fan in the crowd.

“I am actually a Rimowa client. I have been for a long time,” said Dior men’s designer Kris Van Assche. “Mine are the basic ones, but I’ve seen now they have the ones with the leather patches and those are really nice. I think that’s a smart move.”

Patrice Wagner, ceo of LVMH-owned department store Le Bon Marché, said he liked how the suitcases were solid and light at the same time. “I have been a fan of this brand since before the group bought it,” he said. “At Le Bon Marché, we were among the first in Paris to carry Rimowa. For people who travel as much as we do, it’s in a league of its own.”"

Bernard Arnault to Open New $166 Million Frank Gehry-Designed Museum in Paris - artnet News,"Wed, 08 Mar 2017 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vbmV3cy5hcnRuZXQuY29tL2FydC13b3JsZC9iZXJuYXJkLWFybmF1bHQtbXVzZXVtLXBhcmlzLTg4NTA4MNIBTmh0dHBzOi8vbmV3cy5hcnRuZXQuY29tL2FydC13b3JsZC9iZXJuYXJkLWFybmF1bHQtbXVzZXVtLXBhcmlzLTg4NTA4MC9hbXAtcGFnZQ?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"French luxury goods billionaire Bernard Arnault will open a new museum close to his Fondation Louis Vuitton in Paris, which opened in 2014. The collector enlisted Frank Gehry to revamp the building that formerly housed the Museum of Arts and Popular Traditions.

In a presentation attended by French President François Hollande, culture minister Audrey Azoulay, and Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo, Bernard Arnault announced that he agreed to a 50-year lease at €150,000 ($158,000) annually for the 11-story building, which belongs to the city of Paris. Additionally, the city will receive a variable percentage of turnover between two and 10 percent depending on profitability.

As part of the deal, the museum will be renamed La Maison LVMH/Arts, Talents, Patrimonie. According to Le Parisien, renovation costs have been estimated at €158 million ($166 million).

The 15,100-square-meter building will include a traditional craft workshop, a 2,000-seat event hall, multiple gallery spaces, and a rooftop restaurant.

Abandoned for over a decade since the ethnological museum closed to the public in 2005, the structure will require extensive renovation. According to a 2014 report by the court of auditors, the cost of removing asbestos alone has been estimated at between €50–80 million ($52.7–84.4 million)

As a result of the astronomical renovation costs, the city has struggled to find a new tenant, and with monthly security costs totaling €33,000 ($34,000), the property had become a burden. Arnault and LVMH agreed to reestablish a museum in the building after protracted negotiations.

According to Le Parisien, the deal is expected to be formally finalized on Friday, but is subject to approval by the Paris city council and the French Ministry of the Environment, due to its close proximity to the Bois de Boulogne park.

Renovation of the museum is expected to take at least five years, and the new institution is slated to open in 2022.

Following showrooms in Paris last month featuring other shortlisted talents (and more of our favourites) Dilara Findikoglu, Charles Jeffrey, Martine Rose and Richard Malone – the judges (including big names like Karl Lagerfeld, Marc Jacobs and J.W.Anderson) had the unenviable task of shortening this list further.

Having taken London, and subsequently the world by ruffled tulle storm (just check your fashion week Instagram feeds for proof), it’s little wonder that the young Brit designer Goddard is one step closer to following in the footsteps of fellow CSM graduate and 2016 LVMH prize winner, Grace Wales Bonner. Her concoctions have appeared on everyone from Susie Lau to Rihanna, who wore one of her designs to protest Trump’s election.

Similarly, Ambush has an impressive CV of fans and collaborations including Kim Jones for Louis Vuitton, Sacai and Jun Takashi’s Undercover – as well as King and Queen of K-Pop G-Dragon (who collaborated with them for his own label PEACEMINUSONE, shot for our Winter 2016 issue by Noboyushi Araki) and CL. Joined by Syrian-born London designer Nabil El-Nayal, French label Atlein, French-Belgian Marine Serre, Copenhagen’s Cecilie Bahnsen, Russian New York-based label Jahnkoy and the Russian-Japanese duo behind Kozaburo, the eight that have made the list this year are a celebration of design talent all over the world.

This list will now compete for the €300,000 prize money and year’s mentorship that comes with the title, judged on June 16. Watch this space until then."
Maison Francis Kurkdjian Bought by LVMH | British Vogue - British Vogue,"Wed, 22 Mar 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZvZ3VlLmNvLnVrL2FydGljbGUvbWFpc29uLWZyYW5jaXMta3Vya2RqaWFuLWJvdWdodC1ieS1sdm1o0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Getty

LVMH knows good perfume. In addition to its industry-leading scents from LVMH brands Dior, Guerlain, Givenchy and Aqua di Parma, Louis Vuitton launched its very first line of scents last year, created by in-house perfumer Jacques-Cavallier Bertrand at the company’s exquisitely-restored chateau in Grasse. On Monday, the company announced that it has purchased Maison Francis Kurkdjian, the label created by the perfumer Kurkdjian and his business partner Marc Chaya, in 2009.

Francis Kurkdjian is exactly how you would imagine a French perfumer to be: dark, handsome, a little intense. But for all his brooding intensity, he still knows how to create a blockbuster: he’s the “nose: behind Narciso Rodriguez For Her, Elie Saab Le Parfum, My Burberry and also Jean Paul Gaultier Le Male (the one in the bottle that looks like a sailor and which is consistently in the top 10 bestselling men’s scents worldwide).

Kurkdjian’s own label is his opportunity to let his imagination run wild. If Frederic Malle was the person responsible for pioneering the new “niche” world of perfumery, then Kurkdjian was the one who brought the unbridled creativity. As well as the usual body and shower products, his bestselling Aqua Universalis scent – an attempt to create the ultimate feeling of freshness in perfume – also comes in clothes detergent and fabric softener. But perhaps best-loved are his Scented Bubbles, which come in scents like Rose, Cut Grass and Fresh Mint, and which you can pop with your nose to release the scents.

But the thing about perfumers, generally, is they are kept out of the limelight. I remember interviewing Kurkdjian once and him laughing that on the way to our meeting, he had been walking along Regent Street carrying a Maison Francis Kurkdjian carrier bag from his newly-opened Paris boutique. A woman had stopped him on the pavement. “Oh my god!” she had said, “have you been there?! I’m dying to go! I love those perfumes!” – all the while having no idea that she was in fact talking to the maestro himself. Will all that change at LVMH? Who knows. But for all scent lovers, the idea of scaling up this gem of a brand, and providing the wherewithal for new, chic and interesting perfume possibilities is an exciting one indeed.

"De Beers Buys Out LVMH, Now Owns All of Retail Chain - JCK","Tue, 21 Mar 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmpja29ubGluZS5jb20vZWRpdG9yaWFsLWFydGljbGUvZGUtYmVlcnMtYnV5cy1vdXQtbHZtaC1ub3ctb3ducy1hbGwtb2YtcmV0YWlsLWNoYWluL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"De Beers has bought out longtime partner LVMH and now owns 100 percent of the De Beers Diamond Jewellers retail chain.

No price was given.

The diamond giant and luxury giant have been 50-50 partners in the joint venture since it was first announced in 2001. The chain, meant to take advantage of consumer awareness of the De Beers name, opened its first store in London that year.

Initial expectations were heady, with the partners reportedly kicking in $250 million apiece, and executives talking about opening as many as 150 stores.

But in the years since, those grand plans have been noticeably scaled back. The chain currently comprises 32 stores in 17 markets. Several of the stores it opened in the U.S. market—in Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Las Vegas—have closed, though it still operates in Houston and Naples, Fla. In December, it debuted a new flagship in New York City (pictured).

Asia appears to be giving the brand a better reception; in December, CEO Francois Delage told Bloomberg that the chain had logged “double-digit” growth in China.

Still, while De Beers has seemingly never wavered in its support of the venture, in 2014, a Royal Bank of Scotland report called the retail chain “sub-economic.”

In a statement, De Beers CEO Bruce Cleaver said that “more fully integrating the De Beers Diamond Jewellers brand and store network will enable us to deliver an even more differentiated diamond offering, alongside our fast-growing diamond brand, Forevermark.”

Interview: the House of Francis Kurkdjian joins LVMH - Numéro Magazine,"Tue, 21 Mar 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm51bWVyby5jb20vZW4vYmVhdXR5LTAvaW50ZXJ2aWV3LXRoZS1ob3VzZS1vZi1mcmFuY2lzLWt1cmtkamlhbi1qb2lucy1sdm1o0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Numéro: You announced on Monday March 20th that the Maison Francis Kurkdjian will be joining the LVMH Group…

Francis Kurkdjian: Before us all my little comrades have all sought refuge in the lap of a big group [Éditions de Parfums Frédéric Malle, Le Labo and Kilian with Estée Lauder, Serge Lutens with Shiseido, Byredo and Diptyque with Manzanita Capital… editor’s note]. If everyone had stayed independent there would have been a perpetuation of a real niche market. But only two or three actors share this market. We had to put a considerable amount of energy into everything only to platform after five years. We needed to feel supported in the dimension we wanted to give the house. LVHM approached us and got to know us. It is a genuine partner joining us today as the major shareholder.

You’re the nose behind a huge number of perfumes including Le Mâle by Jean Paul Gaultier, Cologne Blanche and Eau Noire by Christian Dior, For Her (in duo with Christine Nagel) and For Him by Narciso Rodriguez, as well as perfume for Elie Saab, and My Burberry by Burberry… On top of that your own perfume company, Maison Francis Kurkdjian, has created 25 perfumes. What led you to becoming a perfumer?

I’d never planned on becoming a perfumer… I grew up in the suburbs in an Armenian family with open minded parents who when I was a kid accepted me wanting to do classical ballet every day after school. There was the cane at my lessons and our feet were strapped to the barre to achieve ailes de pigeon. It was very hard. I learnt constraint, discipline and endless starting over. Aged 13 I failed to get onto the Opera and slowly began to stop dancing until I was 25. Then I tried fashion. I was told I didn’t have a future in it. At the time perfume was a continuation of couture. And that was how I ended up here. It all worked out and I never even questioned whether I liked it or not.

“I never planned on becoming a perfumer.”

You signed your first perfume at the age of 25 which is an exceptional feat. And that creation, Le Mâle by Jean Paul Gaultier, quickly became one of the world’s best-selling fragrances.

My beginnings in the business were pretty unusual. I’d created Le Mâle just after I finished studying, when most perfumers experience their first success around the age of 45. After having been to perfume school I got a job at the Quest fragrance company. At the same time I was doing a course in luxury marketing. It was there at a graduation ceremony that Chantal Roos - then the president of Jean Paul Gaultier and Issey Miyake perfumes - gave me her card and asked to meet me. I entered her office on July 20th1994 under my own name because Quest had told me I couldn’t go to her on behalf of the company. I summarised my brief. And she was impatient to talk to me about Jean Paul Gaultier. But it wasn’t my world. She talked about an exercise around a men’s fragrance, the olfactive sensations of lavender on the skin of a chic man who’s just been swimming in the sea… and then she said to call her if I had any ideas. The perfumers went on holiday. I carried on working discreetly, and it was her who came back to me. There was panic at Quest who thought it outrageous that such an important woman in the perfume world should be in contact with a newbie like me. I was put into the hands of a perfumer. I saw her again and she was interested in my trials. Suddenly Jean Paul Gaultier validated the choice. For the four months of work it took to finalise the project I was all alone. My only support came from the girls who weighed out the raw materials. When Quest found out that my perfume had been chosen, it was complete hysteria. Le Mâle was released and was an instant commercial success. Quest sent me to the USA. I realised then that my life as a perfumer could be short lived, almost like the rocket that had gone off too soon.

“I realised that my life as a perfumer would be short. As if a rocket had gone off to soon.”

Was there something missing then?

No, but there was an anticipated wear in relation to the job. I compressed my life as a perfumer by two decades. I was treated like a dog. I had doubts. The success was so great that I thought the story of Mâle would resume my entire career.

So your journey into perfumery began with a certain singularity, a sort of solitude?

No, not a solitude, but an independence yes, accompanied by a vision and a commitment. My path has been a wide reaching fan of my activities and my freedom. As well as working as a perfumer, I have continued doing artistic collaborations in the shape of olfactive installations like the one I did at the Château de Versailles [the ornamental lakes by the Orangerie were perfumed with orange blossom in tribute to Louis XIV’s penchant for the scent. Editor’s note]. I learnt how to make choices. Leaving Quest for a smaller and more human company like Takasago was one of them. Working on the creation of made-to-measure perfumes was another, doing perfume differently, using other means and making them for other people too. And the creation in 2009 of my own house with my partner Marc Chaya.

“I learnt how to make choices.”

Establishing your own perfume house, was that the ultimate goal?

No, my house was never going to be a finality. It was a happy accident, linked to me meeting my partner. My house is a part of what I like about perfumery, a little something extra.

What is your process, how do you operate when creating a perfume?

Whether I’m working for me or for other houses my process is always the same. Starting from a brief I have to succeed in building my story. I have to find the word or the name that will be the frame in which I will evolve and determine my creative journey. On a daily basis I have 25 to 40 projects on the go, sometimes even 50. The lexical field has a dominating place.

“On a daily basis I have 25 to 40 projects on the go.”

What project are you working on at the moment in your own house?

I’m thinking about a new perfume for 2018 based around transgender. Today there is a redefinition of sexuality. It’s in the corner of my mind and I don’t really know yet where it’s going to take me. Without being caught up in any sort of social demands, I like the house to be connected with what’s going on in the world, obviously taking into consideration the 18 months’ time lag necessary for me to move an idea into its commercialisation. I am a citizen and I want to be fully aware of what’s happening. This connection nourishes me. Now I have the means to express myself differently, to commit myself too. In fact every Monday I help out at a soup kitchen. I’ve got the means to do it and so I make the time to do it.

What has been your greatest olfactive adventure?

Well obviously there’s been the opening of my house because all odds were against us. And then there’s my project with Syrian artist Hratch Arbach, presented at the 2014 Nuit Blanche in the Saint-Séverin Church in Paris. I created three scents evoking blood, earth and jasmine that perfumed 20,000 wax nails laid on the floor. Every visitor chose their nail and let it melt on a monolith liberating the fragrance. This collaboration was very important to me. In my job we only ever talk about beautiful things and beautiful materials. We’re disconnected from the world. That kind of project anchors me in reality.

“In my job, we only talk about beautiful things and beautiful materials.”

What are your favourite creations?

I don’t like anything. You learn how to break everything down because if you like something too much, you get stuck and can’t see beyond it. I always look ahead, towards something I haven’t done. The rest remains imperfect.

For you what relationship does perfume have with the brain, the body and desire?

Work-work-perfume, the perfume-brain relationship is my daily life. Alas I myself haven’t worn perfume for years now. I love the hint of a perfume that fades away in the nape of the neck. When you rub up against someone and their odour comes off onto you. It’s so beautiful, and sometimes very sexual. It’s a sensation of humanity. A look can tell lies, even looking straight into the eye. The mouth can too. But not a perfume, or an odour. A hated perfume provokes rejection by the body.

“I love the hint of a perfume that’s fading away in nape of a neck.”

What do you think about the perfume of tomorrow?

I’m very happy because everything is going in the perfumer’s direction. When I started out no one talked about niche brands. Then along came Serge Lutens, and Frédéric Malle. The future looks pretty sunny; it no longer belongs to composition houses, but to the perfumer who has taken a real place in the heart of the houses. In reality the perfumer should have the same positon as a designer of fine jewellery…

With perfume being a volatile liquid, is it more difficult for a perfumer than a designer to materialise it?

It’s not because a perfume is immaterial that I don’t have an idea of the bottle or the visual that should accompany it. Serge Lutens is a make-up artist, and he knew how to create a whole world in perfumes. It’s true that for perfumers it is more complicated, because history has seen us go from a hyper-artisanal era to a hyper-industrialised one without the artistic dimension being considered in our craft. From the moment we got the new molecules, it wasn’t to do olfactive installations or fun things, it was always just about making perfume and selling as much as possible. Perfume became a financial tool and not a wide open field of potential exploration. We got left behind without acquiring an aesthetic vision of perfumery."
New art museums in France: Architect Frank Gehry to design the LVMH Applied Arts Centre in Paris - LUXUO,"Sat, 18 Mar 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5sdXh1by5jb20vY3VsdHVyZS9hcnQvbmV3LWFydC1tdXNldW1zLWluLWZyYW5jZS1hcmNoaXRlY3QtZnJhbmstZ2VocnktdG8tZGVzaWduLXRoZS1sdm1oLWFwcGxpZWQtYXJ0cy1jZW50cmUtaW4tcGFyaXMuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Culture / Art Republik

Mar 18, 2017 | By AFP Relaxnews

LVMH will tap on the expertise of architect Frank Gehry once again to create a centre for applied arts beside the Louis Vuitton Foundation. The celebrated Canadian-American architect, aged 88, will be tasked with renovating and transforming a disused museum. The site is located a stone’s throw from the futuristic Foundation Gehry on the western edge of Paris in the Bois de Boulogne.

The new centre, to be called the Maison LVMH – Arts, Talents, Patrimoine (Heritage), will be created at an estimated cost of 158 million euros (US$167 million), of which 50 million to 80 million euros will be employed for asbestos removal. Stated a joint statement on the centre made by the luxury group and the City of Paris on March 8: “The new centre will be dedicated to artists, live performances and to the applied arts and French savoir-faire.”

The centre will include two halls for concerts, exhibitions and workshops, and a panoramic restaurant on the top floor. The project will be developed in “close collaboration with the heirs of Jean Dubuisson,” the statement said, noting that Dubuisson’s grandson Thomas Dubuisson, also an architect, has worked for Gehry at his Los Angeles base.

French President Francois Hollande attended Wednesday’s news conference announcing the project, along with Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo, Gehry and LVMH Group’s Chief Executive Officer Bernard Arnault. Hidalgo said in the joint statement that the project “sends a powerful message to young generations: artisanal craftsmanship offers tremendous potential and opportunities that we encourage them to discover and seize.”

The original function of the eight-storey building to be revamped to house the art centre was a museum of folk art and traditions. The structure, designed in the 1970s by architect Jean Dubuisson, has been closed since 2005."
"Meet Marine Serre, the Latest Young Designer Enjoying a Breakthrough in Paris - W Magazine","Thu, 09 Mar 2017 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndtYWdhemluZS5jb20vc3RvcnkvbWFyaW5lLXNlcnJlLXlvdW5nLWZyZW5jaC1kZXNpZ25lci1sdm1oLXByaXpl0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Last October, the young French designer Marine Serre moved to Paris to take a job at Balenciaga. But, within months, she had gotten more than she bargained for.

In February, unexpectedly, she was among the 21 designers shortlisted for the coveted LVMH Prize, alongside other upstarts like Molly Goddard and Antonin Tron of Atlein. But that wasn’t it. Serre was also invited to showcase at the prestigious Hyères International Festival of Fashion and Photography in April.

The flurry of accolades has taken Serre by surprise, as she always assumed her career would be in sports.

“I played tennis, I participated in all these competitions. At the same time, I was doing art,” she said at her home in Paris’s 18th arrondissement during Paris Fashion Week. (All the other LVMH Prize finalists presented their collections to a jury of industry leaders, and Kendall Jenner, last week). “One day I had a car accident, and I thought, ‘Ok, what do I actually like in art, and what do I want to do?’”

Serre’s existential question already had an answer. She was living in the South of France, and had been experimenting with fashion design on a personal level. Serra is slight of frame, about 5 feet tall, and she was fond of shopping in beloved second hand shops, but everything was just too big.

“Since I was small, I always needed to cut all my pants,” she explained. “And then I decided to study fashion in Marseilles for 2 years.”

That was all the encouragement she needed. Serre took a risk and moved to Brussels, enrolling at La Cambre and studying there for 5 years while also apprenticing for the likes of Martin Margiela, Raf Simons, and Alexander McQueen. Then, last year, Serre presented her first collection, and in what felt like a surprise turn of events for the young designer, she found significant interest. After that first collection, Serre thought, “Ok, dream on. I’m going to have nothing to do anymore. I was not expecting any big success off of that.”

But stores, like H. Lorenzo in Los Angeles and The Broken Arm in Paris, started to take notice. When LMVH asked her to participate in the young designers’ prize, which could win her 300,000 euros (or about $316,000), Serre thought she was too small to go for it. But lo and behold, she made the shortlist.

Serre’s fall collection is inspired by 19th century traditional Arabic dress, specifically its volume and silhouette, as well as, curiously, athletic-wear. For her long dresses, she sliced found Arabic fabrics and patchworked them with modern fabrics, giving the overall look a contemporary feel. She has a keen eye for color—something she’d learned from her time with Simons—and applied that to the way she styled the collection. For instance, a well-cut camel coat is worn over a lime green jersey bodysuit, and the jacket’s sleeves are lined in an orange fabric that pops as the wearer moves. The half moon crescent that appears on a number of pieces in this collection is a riff on the idea of a logo. It’s on headbands and shoes, just like a Nike swoosh would be.

It is all moving very fast for someone who just moved to Paris and who just wanted to find a small space for her atelier, instead of having to work out of her apartment. However, there is a lot to look forward to.

“I don’t know exactly what is coming up next,” Serre said smiling, a little bewildered and amused by all the attention this fashion week, “but I do want to just continue doing what I like.”

“Women’s Rights Are Human Rights”: 62 Fashion Insiders Speak Out in a Powerful Video for International Women’s Day"
Luxury family businesses Hermes and LVMH buck downward market trend - Campden FB,"Tue, 28 Mar 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNhbXBkZW5mYi5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS9sdXh1cnktZmFtaWx5LWJ1c2luZXNzZXMtaGVybWVzLWFuZC1sdm1oLWJ1Y2stZG93bndhcmQtbWFya2V0LXRyZW5k0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Hermès and LVMH announcing record profits for 2016 suggests the French family businesses are resuscitating the moribund $1.1 trillion global luxury market despite ongoing political and economic uncertainty.

Hermès Group, the French high fashion clothing and accessories manufacturer and retailer started its 180th anniversary in 2017 on a high note. The group's consolidated revenues for 2016 passed the €5 billion ($5.4 billion) mark to reach €5 billion ($5.9 billion) up 7.5% at current exchange rates and 7.4% at constant exchange rates, the supervisory board heard.

Recurring operating income shot up 10% at Hermès, which amounted to €1.7 billion ($1.8 billion) or “an all-time high” of 32.6% of sales. Net profit increased 13% to reach €1.1 billion ($1.2 billion).

Leather goods and saddlery products confirmed their role as the mainstay of the group with “remarkable” 14% growth, the company said. Growth was due to the success of the collections and the diversity of models, particularly the Constance, Halzan and Lindy bags alongside the Birkin (pictured) and Kelly, named in honour of the movie stars Jane Birkin and Grace Kelly.

“Otherwise, sales benefitted from a positive momentum at year end in certain sectors such as silk and the ready-to-wear and accessories division,” the group added.

Hermès said growth was driven in Japan (+9%) due to its selective distribution network, despite the strengthening of the Yen, and Asia excluding Japan (+7%) particularly with extensions of the Liat Towers and Takashimaya stores in Singapore and store openings in Macao, at Hong Kong Airport and in Chongqing in China. However, Hong Kong and Macao remained “challenging”.

The United States (+7%) achieved solid growth, in a “contrasting environment”, the group continued. The stores in Hawaii and Philadelphia were renovated and extended at the end of the year.

Europe (+8%) posted growth, despite the group vaguely alluding to “the impact of recent events”. The Bocca di Leone store in Rome was performing well and the home territory of France (+5%) displayed “solid growth.”

Hermès created 590 new jobs worldwide, two-thirds in France, taking the global workforce to 12,834 people including 7,881 in France.

The family businesses' share price increased from a low of €395 ($429.08) on 8 February, the day of the company's announcement, to climb steadily and peak at €437.45 ($475.06) on 27 March.

After a dispute with LVMH which ended in 2014, the sixth-generation descendants of founder Émile-Maurice Hermès continued to hold a majority stake and agreed not to sell their shares for 20 years, reported Forbes. The magazine ranked fifth-generation patriarch Nicolas Puech at 896th in its 2017 World's Billionaires List with his net worth pegged at $2.3 billion.

LVMH (Louis Vuitton Moët Hennessy) also looked back at 2016 with satisfaction. The world's leading luxury products group declared its revenue of €37.6 billion for the year in late January, an increase of 5% over 2015, itself a year of growth. Organic revenue growth was 6%.

The 30-year-old France-based multinational group of 70 resilient brands, including Givenchy, Dom Pérignon and Bulgari, said the American market “remains on a good track as does Europe” while “Asia, excluding Japan, continued its good momentum.”

Profit from recurring operations reached €7 billion in 2016, an increase of 6%, to which all business groups, apart from selective distribution, contributed.

Bernard Arnault (left), chairman and chief executive, said LVMH achieved an “excellent performance” in 2016 given geopolitical and economic instability.

“Continued innovation, entrepreneurial spirit and the quest for excellence: all Maisons continue to assert these core values while maintaining rigorous execution of their strategies on the ground,” Arnault said.

De Beers Group announced last week it had successfully concluded the purchase of LVMH's 50% shareholding in De Beers Diamond Jewellers to take full ownership of the company. De Beers Diamond Jewellers' retail network consists of 32 stores in 17 global consumer markets.

“This includes a growing business in greater China and with Chinese clients worldwide, an established presence in London and Paris, and a new flagship location in New York City,” the company, established in 1888, said.

The share market reacted fairly positively to the diamond divestment. LVMH share price had dipped to €198.70 ($215.85) on 21 March, the day of the announcement, then the price rallied to a peak of €201.95 ($219.33) two days later.

Commentators blame the luxury market slump on the decline in Chinese consumer spending and fewer tourists in the wake of European terrorist attacks plus the strong United States dollar and uncertainty around the 2016 election in the US, which was also the world's biggest personal luxury goods market."
De Beers Ends Retail Venture with LVMH - The Business of Fashion,"Wed, 22 Mar 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzb2ZmYXNoaW9uLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy9yZXRhaWwvZGUtYmVlcnMtbHZtaC1lbmQtcmV0YWlsLXZlbnR1cmUv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LONDON, United Kingdom — De Beers has confirmed that it has ended a joint venture with LVMH after more than 16 years, having bought back the 50 percent stake acquired by the French luxury conglomerate in 2001 for an undisclosed sum.

The joint venture saw a more seamless integration of the luxury jeweller’s brand and store network and allowed it to deliver a more differentiated diamond offering.

The move marks the end of a partnership that at the time, had intended to transform the way diamonds were sold to consumers, positioned more as fashion accessories or casual purchases that customers bought for themselves rather than as an occasional or formal gift for others.

De Beers’ venture into retail with LVMH formed part of an effort to transform itself from a mining company into a luxury goods firm. Comprising 32 stores, De Beers’ retail network spans 17 markets around the world, which includes its business in China, as well as London, Paris and a new flagship in New York.

""With its strong brand awareness, consummate diamond expertise and a commitment to responsibility, De Beers Diamond Jewellers is a trusted and industry-leading diamond jeweller,”said Bruce Cleaver, chief executive of De Beers Group in a statement on Tuesday. “More fully integrating the De Beers Diamond Jewellers brand and store network will enable us to deliver an even more differentiated diamond offering.”

A spokesperson for LVMH was not immediately available for comment.

The announcement comes at a time when diamond suppliers are facing a challenging market, as the price of diamonds falls. De Beers, which supplies 40 percent of the market, reported that the average price per carat in 2016 was $187, down from $207 in 2015.

The strength of the dollar, the tightening of anti-corruption laws in China (which has affected gifting), and the general slowdown of the hard-luxury market, diamonds in particular, has hit luxury jewellers hard at a time of volatility in the wider luxury market.

On top of this, the retail market for luxury jewellery remains tough; competitor Tiffany & Co has struggled to maintain its standing as an industry leader in both its mature markets like United States and emerging markets like China.

On Monday, the luxury goods group acquired a majority interest in exclusive fragrance house Maison . The French label, whose current revenue is in the region of €12 million, was created in 2009 by perfumer Francis Kurkdjian - the nose behind 's Le Mâle fragrance - and Marc Chaya, a former partner at Ernst & Young, and soon made a name for itself in the world of ultra-sophisticated fragrances. 's President and co-founder Marc Chaya has told FashionNetwork how the label forged links with LVMH, and what its plans are.







Marc Chaya and Francis Kurkdjian - ©Nathalie Baetens



FashionNetwork: What can you tell us about your brand's acquisition by LVMH?



Marc Chaya: For reasons of confidentiality, we can only confirm that LVMH has bought a majority stake in Maison Francis Kurkdjian, which was formerly controlled by Francis Kurkdjian and myself. There will be no break with the past however: we are still shareholders in the company and we maintain our operational roles, Francis Kurkdjian as Creative Director and myself as President. There will be no change in our team either, except that we will continue to add to and strengthen it.

FNW: Why has a label like yours, which made independence one of its assets, decided to join a major group?



MC: With LVMH, we've entered into a partnership that's more strategic than financial. We are an independent label, profitable and solid, with a 50% annual growth rate. The strategy that led to the partnership is neither defensive nor financial. Above all, we needed to adopt a long-term strategic vision. We are a niche brand, and we had to take into account the trend towards partnerships. Many of our competitors have joined forces with major groups in the last couple of years.



FNW: What sparked off this operation?



MC: LVMH got in touch with us, as many others did. But LVMH was the only partner that would do. We are a French house, a creator of fragrances and not simply a label, and 's group is adept at managing the business of creation, as well as being already active in the perfumery industry. We share the same culture. It wasn't the financial side of things that motivated us, but the desire to join a group which has a specific expertise.



FNW: What can LVMH offer you?



MC: As I said, it will contribute its expertise. For example, know-how on markets in which we are not present, such as China, or others where we could do better, as in Russia, where we can rely on the group's local organisation. And also, they will support us with their know-how in other areas, such as digital operations.



FNW: Do you also envisage the possibility of synergies, for example in fragrances, in terms of suppliers and the like?



MC: Synergies will not be automatic. We will continue to work with our existing partners. When opportunities for synergy will arise, we will exploit them, for example, as I said earlier, in terms of local organisations in other countries, or in the case of specific know-how. It is not in the nature of our house to rush into things. For us, it is marketing which is at creativity's service, and not the other way round.



FNW: Which are your main markets?



MC: The USA is Maison Francis Kurkdjian's main market, accounting for nearly 40% of our revenue. We opened a subsidiary there when we set up the company in 2009, and we are well-established. Until now, we were exclusively distributed at , where we rank among the top 4 labels in fragrance sales. From 2017, we began to collaborate with too. We are also present in more than 40 other countries, notably in the whole of South-East Asia. We are not present in China however, nor in Latin America.



FNW: How is your distribution network structured?



MC: We are distributed via 500 multibrand stores, all fragrance specialists, and we operate 10 monobrand stores, either directly or with partners: two in Paris, four in Taiwan, and one each in Dubai, Kuwait City, in Qatar and in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.



FNW: What are your short-term projects?



MC: We will continue to drive our expansion in the USA and the Middle East, and we will also debut in Thailand, where we signed a partnership last year."
South Korean Fashion Line Blindness Embraces Gender Fluidity - The Cut,"Thu, 30 Mar 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWN1dC5jb20vMjAxNy8wMy9ibGluZG5lc3Mtc291dGgta29yZWFuLWZhc2hpb24tbGluZS1sdm1oLWdlbmRlci1mbHVpZGl0eS5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Photo: Courtesy of Seoul Fashion Week

In recent years gender-fluid clothes have become more common in ads and runway shows — look at Pharrell wearing a Chanel purse, Jaden Smith’s collection of skirts, or Burberry’s Virginia Woolf–inspired September collection. You’d think this was a liberal-thinking, Western-oriented trend but it’s not. The most exciting line out of South Korea, Blindness, fully embraces the idea that it’s all about making beautiful pieces that anyone, regardless of social preconceptions of gender norms, can wear.

Designers KyuYoung Shin and JiSun Park debuted the brand in 2013, but it was their last collection that really launched their work globally. Their The Danish Girl–inspired spring 2017 collection was filled with corset-inspired silhouettes, pearl trims, and millennial-pink ruffles — mostly shown on men. It was enough to grab the attention of the judges behind the LVMH prize, where they finished as semifinalists.

Taking the momentum from being noticed by one of the most influential luxury-fashion conglomerates, the duo decided to go even flashier for their fall collection. This time the idea sprang from the death of David Bowie and his fashion legacy. What resulted was sparkly, eye-catching mix of puffers, dresses, cowboy boots, and yes, more pearl accents on mostly men with a few women sprinkled in.

Their choice in what each model wears down the runway feels deliberately unconventional. The two women skew more masculine while their muse, male model Jae Yong Na, at one point wears a pearl-studded crop top, while another outfit features a sequin-studded pencil skirt with knee-high red boots. Even the closing look, a silver “evening” dress is shown on a tough, bald-headed guy with a chest full of tattoos.

While the designers might not have a dream client, it’s easy to imagine seeing someone like Rihanna, Jared Leto, or Frank Ocean in the clothes. And really, given their current track record, it won’t be long before we do."
Bernard Arnault pledges $166M to Frank Gehry-designed Museum in Paris - World Architecture Community,"Thu, 09 Mar 2017 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd29ybGRhcmNoaXRlY3R1cmUub3JnL2FydGljbGVzL2N2aGNoL2Jlcm5hcmRfYXJuYXVsdF9wbGVkZ2VzXzE2Nm1fdG9fZnJhbmtfZ2VocnlkZXNpZ25lZF9tdXNldW1faW5fcGFyaXMuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"French luxury goods billionaire Bernard Arnault pledges $166 Million to Frank Gehry-designed new museum in Paris, he announced his new deal at a meeting on March 8, 2017. The new museum, renamed as La Maison LVMH/Arts, Talents, Patrimonie, will be added to Arnault's Museum Empire list, which will be very close to Frank Gehry's Fondation Louis Vuitton-opened in 2014.

The Museum of Arts and Popular Traditions (ATP) was a museum of ethnology, which exposed the French rural and artisan society of the nineteenth century until 1960. In the absence of visitors, it closed its doors in 2005 and its collections integrate the MUCEM in Marseille.

The City of Paris had conceded the use of the building to the State by an agreement signed for thirty years in 1954, renewed once until 2014. The site being classified, the building could not be sold and the nature of the museum- could not be changed either. Bernard Arnault, whose Vuitton neighboring the ATP exceeded expectations of attendance (he planned to attract 600,000 visitors, the million visitors were reached), wanted to find a solution for the building for a long time.

The City of Paris has just given it the green light for a concession of fifty years, on the same model as the Vuitton Foundation. LVMH Arts-Talents-Patrimoine is in line with the Institute of the trades of excellence that the LVMH group has created. It will host a venue for events, exhibitions, artistic workshops, an academy of crafts and crafts, a documentation center and an institute of excellence.

The project is aimed at a large and young public, young, to make him discover these professions. There is also a restaurant on the eighth and top floor. Bernard Arnault again called on Frank Gehry to rehabilitate the building, which will receive a light-colored glass cladding. At the press conference on March 8, he said he was delighted ""to make a new project with Gehry who is always full of ideas.''

He described his project as a ''new cultural and philanthropic start-up.'' The amount of work financed by LVMH is estimated at €158 Million ($166 Million). LVMH will have to pay an annual fee of €150.000 euros to the Paris City Hall, to which will be added a ticket, concert, restaurant and merchandise fees. € 10 million has been allocated to LVMH to do basic construction work, including asbestos removal.

The project will be submitted to the Paris Council at the end of March and will have to be approved by the Site Commission of the Ministry of the Environment because of its proximity to the Bois de Boulogne. Bernard Arnault expressed the wish ''that the project will be completed sooner than the Vuitton Foundation, which took ten years to come.''

Renovations are expected to be complete within five years and the new museum is expected to open in 2022.

De Beers Takes Full Ownership of Eponymous Retail Chain - National Jeweler,"Wed, 22 Mar 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5hdGlvbmFsamV3ZWxlci5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvMzc5NC1kZS1iZWVycy10YWtlcy1mdWxsLW93bmVyc2hpcC1vZi1lcG9ueW1vdXMtcmV0YWlsLWNoYWlu0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"London--The De Beers Group has acquired luxury conglomerate LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton’s 50 percent share in the De Beers Diamond Jewellers retail chain, giving it full ownership of the company.



Terms of the deal were not disclosed.



De Beers Group and LVMH have shared ownership in the venture 50-50 since the retail network was formed in 2001.



The growth and performance of the chain has fluctuated since it launched, particularly in the U.S., where it currently has four locations, according to its website. Last year, the company moved its New York flagship store to a new location on Madison Avenue to complete “the repositioning of the brand in the U.S.”



At the close of 2016, De Beers Diamond Jewellers had 34 stores in 17 markets worldwide.



De Beers Group CEO Bruce Cleaver said that integrating the De Beers Diamond Jewellers brand and store network will help the company deliver an “even more differentiated diamond offering” alongside its Forevermark diamond brand.



Last month, De Beers said that Forevermark had passed 2,000 retail doors across the world, building off of a 14 percent increase in the number of doors in 2016 alone and expansion into Hungary, South Korea and Thailand."

Louis Vuitton shares remain stylish - Times of Malta,"Mon, 27 Mar 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vdGltZXNvZm1hbHRhLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL2xvdWlzLXZ1aXR0b24tc2hhcmVzLXJlbWFpbi1zdHlsaXNoLjY0MzY5M9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"About the company

LVMH is a French multinational luxury goods conglomerate, headquartered in Paris. The company was formed by the 1987 merger of fashion house Louis Vuitton with Moët Hennessy, a company formed after the 1971 merger between the champagne producer Moët & Chandon and Hennessy, the cognac manufacturer.



Investment Thesis

Since the start of the year LVMH shares have outperformed the CAC 40 index by 7%. LVMH are up 11% year-to-date compared to the CAC 40 which is up 3%.

This outperformance came mainly due to the strong results reported by the company and resilient outlook. LVMH is well-positioned to continue to benefit as global growth picks up.

We maintain our overweight stance on LVMH and increase our price target to €210 from €200/share. The main reason for this increase is improved margins going forward, mainly due to a lower capex/sales ratio.

Rationale for our Overweight Recommendation

We remain overweight on LVMH with a price target of €210 per share for the following reasons:

• Well-diversified portfolio of different brands – over 50 brands across 5 sectors

• We expect to continue to see a pick-up in sales of wines and spirits. The Group is no longer going through a destocking phase like in 2015.

• We expect to continue to see Tag Heuer and Bulgari outperform expectations in their respective categories

• We expect to see continued improvement from the fashion and leather goods segment after the launch of new products by Louis Vuitton in the first quarter of this year

• We expect high margins due to lower capex/sales ratio. Having said this, our price target of €210 is assuming constant margins in the years ahead in order not to be too optimistic.

• The pick-up in global growth is favourable for cyclical stocks like LVMH

• The Group is benefitting from emerging market growth

• Political risks are abating in France as Macron seems to be taking the lead in the Presidential race. A positive for French equities

• We expect a stable tax rate of 32% going forward

• LVMH plans to pay a final dividend of €2.6 a share to shareholders on the record as at 20.04.2017 (it goes ex div on 19.04.2017)

Outlook

What interests us most was managements’ positive outlook for 2017 which we believe the Group will be able to achieve. They said the Group is well-equipped to cope with a climate of geopolitical and currency uncertainties and to maintain growth momentum across all business areas in 2017.

Diamond group De Beers buys out retail partner LVMH - Times of Malta,"Thu, 23 Mar 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vdGltZXNvZm1hbHRhLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy92aWV3L0RpYW1vbmQtZ3JvdXAtRGUtQmVlcnMtYnV5cy1vdXQtcmV0YWlsLXBhcnRuZXItTFZNSC42NDMzMDTSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Anglo American’s diamond specialist De Beers has bought the 50 per cent stake held by French luxury goods group LVMH in De Beers Diamond Jewellers for an undisclosed sum, taking full ownership of the retail operation.

Analysts said the joint venture no longer fitted LVMH’s strategy, while Anglo American, which has long dominated global rough diamond sales, has been developing its presence on the high-margin diamond retail market.

LVMH had no comment. De Beers said in a statement that fully integrating De Beers Diamond Jewellers would enable the group to enhance value.

Anglo American, which along with other mining companies has largely recovered from a deep commodities downturn in 2015, has put diamonds, along with copper and platinum, at the heart of its portfolio.

One of the advantages of diamonds is that they are a counter-cyclical luxury product that can generate profits even when bulk industrial commodities are in a downturn.

De Beers Diamond Jewellers’ retail network comprises 32 stores in 17 countries. This includes a growing business in greater China, an established presence in London and Paris, and a new flagship location in New York.

In addition, De Beers’ Forevermark high-end diamond brand has expanded into 2,000 outlets globally and it says it expects the growth to continue this year.

Analysts said LVMH had finally ended a joint venture that dated back to when the group did not have any branded jewellery of its own.

“The situation is very different today, as they own one of the megabrands in this space: Bulgari,” Luca Solca, analyst at Exane BNP Paribas, said.

“It seems appropriate therefore to turn the page on this and relegate it to the ‘experiments that didn’t work’ pile.”"
