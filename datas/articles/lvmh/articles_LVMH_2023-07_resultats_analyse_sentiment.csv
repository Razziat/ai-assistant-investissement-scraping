LVMH earnings suggest luxury spending is suddenly slowing in the U.S. - CNBC,"Tue, 25 Jul 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tLzIwMjMvMDcvMjUvbHZtaC1lYXJuaW5ncy1sdm1oLXNheXMtbHV4dXJ5LWN1c3RvbWVycy1ub3Qtc2hvcHBpbmctYXMtbXVjaC5odG1s0gFmaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY25iYy5jb20vYW1wLzIwMjMvMDcvMjUvbHZtaC1lYXJuaW5ncy1sdm1oLXNheXMtbHV4dXJ5LWN1c3RvbWVycy1ub3Qtc2hvcHBpbmctYXMtbXVjaC5odG1s?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"""If we assume that that group was benefitting from subsidies during COVID, those come to an end at some point,"" he said.

During the LVMH earnings call Tuesday, CFO Jean-Jacques Guiony said sales dropped in the U.S. as aspirational consumers no longer spent on entry-level products. While he said he couldn't explain the exact reason for the drop, he said fading stimulus payments after COVID could have contributed.

Luxury behemoth LVMH on Tuesday reported a surprising drop in U.S. sales in the second quarter, as its chief financial officer said ""aspirational customers are not shopping as much as they used to."" LVMH's U.S. sales slid 1% in the second quarter from the prior-year period. The disappointing results in the U.S. market came after Cartier owner Richemont earlier this month reported a 4% decline in U.S. sales. Richemont shares fell 10% on the news, pressuring other luxury stocks throughout the week as analysts braced for a potential U.S. luxury slowdown.

Guiony said high-priced goods at LVMH's most expensive brands are holding up well in the U.S., presumably due to wealthier shoppers who are less sensitive to inflation, student debt and the economy. The hardest hit segment in the U.S. was wine and spirits — especially cognac. LVMH said it has struggled with inventory issues during and after the pandemic that have made pricing and supply hard to control.

The slowdown also came as Americans vacationed in Europe and bought luxury goods in Paris, Rome or London instead of the U.S., Guiony said. LVMH's sales in Europe increased 18% in the second quarter, and Guiony said tourists accounted for nearly half of that growth.

LVMH reported a similar shift in spending last year, when Americans returned to Europe en masse, partially cannibalizing sales in the U.S.

China offered a major contrast from the U.S. Overall, LVMH reported sales rose 17% in the quarter, helped by a 34% increase in Asia excluding Japan.

Guiony said that despite signs the broader Chinese economy is slowing, luxury spending there is ""strong"" after lockdowns were lifted late last year. The company's Bulgari jewelry brand, which performs well in Asia, had a solid quarter, while Tiffany, which is more reliant on the U.S., was weaker.

He said that while a large share of Chinese luxury purchases used to come in Europe, they are now largely in China and Japan.

""Japanese prices fell quite a lot during the year"" due to the falling yen, he said. ""There are big price differences between China and Japan. But we will see prices in Japan start to rise.""","{'label': 'Negative', 'score': 0.9949978590011597}",negative,0.9949978590011597,-1

Paris, July 25, 2023

LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, the world’s leading high-quality products group, recorded revenue of €42.2 billion in the first half of 2023, up 15%. Organic revenue growth was 17% compared to the same period in 2022. All business groups achieved double-digit organic revenue growth over the half year, except for Wines & Spirits, which faced a particularly high basis of comparison.

In the second quarter, organic revenue growth was 17%, in line with trends seen in the first quarter.

Profit from recurring operations for the first half of 2023 was up 13% at €11 574 million. Operating margin reached 27.4% of revenue. Group share of net profit was up 30% at €8 481 million.

Bernard Arnault, Chairman and CEO of LVMH, said: “LVMH achieved outstanding results during a six-month period of ongoing economic and geopolitical uncertainty. The strong creative momentum and excellent distribution of our Maisons continued to inspire dreams, as demonstrated by the enthusiastic reception given to Pharrell Williams’ first fashion show for Louis Vuitton as well as the reopening of the New York “Landmark” of Tiffany & Co. We continued to see progress relating to our environmental, social and societal commitments, most notably in the recent announcement of an ambitious water sobriety plan intended to reduce our overall water consumption footprint by 30% by 2030. Thanks to the desirability of our brands, we approach the second half of the year with confidence and optimism but will remain vigilant within the current environment and count on the agility and talent of our teams to further strengthen our global leadership position in luxury goods in 2023.”

Highlights of the first half of 2023 include:

An excellent first half despite a disrupted environment,

Significant revenue growth across all business groups except Wines & Spirits, which faced a high basis of comparison,

Strong growth in business in Europe and Asia;

Solid performance by champagne thanks to its value-based strategy, and a contraction in cognac compared to the first half of 2022 which benefited from the significant impact of inventory rebuilding among distributors,

Outstanding performance by the Fashion & Leather Goods business group, in particular Louis Vuitton, Christian Dior, Celine, Loro Piana, Loewe and all the other brands which gained market share worldwide,

Rapid growth in perfume, makeup, and skincare,

Impressive growth in high jewelry, and strong creative momentum among all Watches and Jewelry Maisons, in particular Tiffany, Bulgari, and TAG Heuer,

Exceptional performance by Sephora, confirming its position as world leader in beauty retail,

Return to profit for DFS, which benefited from the recovery in international travel.

Operating free cash flow halved due to major investments in exceptional real estate and in operational inventories, notably in high jewelry.

Wines & Spirits: good half year for the Champagne business; weak demand for Hennessy

The Wines & Spirits business group recorded a slight revenue decline (3% organic) in the first half of 2023, when compared to a particularly strong first half of 2022. Profit from recurring operations was down 9%. The Champagne business recorded an increase in revenue over the half year, driven by its value-based strategy. Hennessy cognac was impacted by the economic environment in the United States and by the continued high stock level of its retailers. Among Provence rosé wines, LVMH acquired the prestigious, world leading domain Minuty, and Château d'Esclans stepped up its international expansion. The Joseph Phelps Vineyard, one of the most renowned wine properties in Napa Valley, California, was included in the first half accounts for the first time. Glenmorangie whisky and Belvedere vodka continued to show strong momentum in innovation.

Fashion & Leather Goods: remarkable performances by Louis Vuitton, Christian Dior, Celine, Loro Piana, Loewe and Marc Jacobs

The Fashion & Leather Goods business group recorded organic revenue growth of 20% in the first half of 2023. Profit from recurring operations was up 14%. Louis Vuitton had an excellent first half, still driven by its exceptional creativity, the quality of its products and its strong links with art and culture. Nicolas Ghesquière's talent for creating a dialogue between fashion and architecture continued to elevate the strong desirability of his Women's collections to the highest level. A new chapter opened with the arrival of Pharrell Williams as Men's Creative Director. Set on the stage of the Pont-Neuf bridge in Paris, his first fashion show was met with huge enthusiasm and more than 1.1 billion views on social media reaching an all-time high. Christian Dior continued to enjoy remarkable growth in all its product categories. Whether in Mumbai, Mexico City or Paris, each of the fashion shows inspired by Maria Grazia Chiuri showcased the exceptional craftsmanship of the Maison. The Lady Dior bag, an icon of the Maison Dior, was also featured in the “Christian Dior, Designer of Dreams” Exhibition at the Tokyo Museum of Contemporary Art. The exceptional Dior Homme designs by Kim Jones and the unique high jewelry creations by Victoire de Castellane elevated the superb craftsmanship of the Maison to an unprecedented new contemporary level. The success of Hedi Slimane's creations and fashion shows has continued to increase the desirability of Celine. Driven by the bold creativity of J.W. Anderson, Loewe continued to strengthen its distribution network, most notably with the opening of Casa Dubaï. Fendi opened new stores in Seoul and Tokyo. Loro Piana, Rimowa, Marc Jacobs and Berluti enjoyed an excellent start to the year.

Perfumes & Cosmetics: strong momentum in perfumes and makeup, supported by a highly selective and high-quality distribution policy

The Perfumes & Cosmetics business group recorded organic revenue growth of 13% in the first half of 2023 thanks to strong momentum achieved through innovation, combined with a highly selective distribution policy. Profit from recurring operations was up 15%. Christian Dior enjoyed a remarkable performance, strengthening its leadership in its strategic markets. Sauvage confirmed its position as the world's leading perfume, while the iconic women's fragrances J'adore and Miss Dior saw continued success. Makeup also contributed to the strong set of results from the Maison, particularly Dior Addict Lip Maximizer and Forever Skin Correct foundation. Finally, skincare had an excellent performance, particularly in the premium segment in Asia with its iconic Prestige range. Guerlain continued to grow, driven notably by the vitality of its Abeille Royale skincare and its high-end perfumery collection l’Art et la Matière, enriched with a new Jasmin Bonheur creation. Givenchy benefited from the excellent reception of its new fragrance Gentleman Society. Benefit successfully expanded its The Porefessional skincare range, while Fenty Beauty's latest creation, Hella Thicc mascara, is already one of the Maison’s bestsellers.

Watches & Jewelry: strong growth in jewelry, sustained innovation in watchmaking

The Watches & Jewelry business group achieved organic revenue growth of 13% in the first half of 2023. Profit from recurring operations was up 10%. In jewelry, Tiffany enjoyed excellent momentum with the exceptional success of the reopening of the “Landmark” in New York; The Landmark has once again become an emblematic venue for New York life. The new Lock collection continued to be rolled out worldwide and the first High Jewelry collection by Artistic Director Nathalie Verdeille was unveiled. Bulgari, which experienced strong growth, celebrated the 75th anniversary of its iconic Serpenti collection. Its high jewelry, with notably the launch of the Mediterranea collection, saw outstanding performance. Chaumet and Fred experienced strong growth over the first half. TAG Heuer celebrated 60 years of its Carrera collection. The LVMH watchmaking Maisons TAG Heuer, Hublot and Zenith unveiled many new products during LVMH Watch Week and the Watches & Wonders trade show.

Selective Retailing: excellent performance by Sephora; DFS growth supported by the recovery in international travel

In Selective Retailing, organic revenue growth was 26% in the first half of 2023. Profit from recurring operations was up 100%. Sephora performed exceptionally well and continued to gain market share thanks to its distinct and innovative product and service offering. Momentum was particularly strong in North America, Europe and the Middle East. Its distribution network continued to expand, particularly in the United Kingdom where its first store opening proved a huge success. DFS benefited from the gradual recovery in international travel and, in particular, from the return of tourists to the flagship destinations of Hong Kong and Macau. In France, the strong performance of La Samaritaine in Paris confirmed its appeal as a destination, within the context of an increasing number of Asian tourists. Le Bon Marché, which is growing strongly, continued to develop innovative concepts and benefit from a loyal French customer base as well as a return of international travelers.

Outlook 2023

In an uncertain geopolitical and economic environment, the Group will maintain a strategy focused on continuously strengthening the desirability of its brands, by relying on the exceptional quality of its products and the excellence of their distribution.

Our strategy of focusing on the highest quality across all of our activities, combined with the energy and unparalleled creativity of our teams, will enable us to reinforce LVMH's global leadership position in luxury goods once again in 2023.

Arnault Touts LVMH’s ‘Outstanding Results’ Despite U.S. Slowdown - Observer,"Wed, 26 Jul 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vb2JzZXJ2ZXIuY29tLzIwMjMvMDcvYmVybmFyZC1hcm5hdWx0LWx2bWhzLW91dHN0YW5kaW5nLXJlc3VsdHMtc2xvd2Rvd24v0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LVMH (LVMHF), one of the world’s wealthiest companies and the luxury conglomerate behind brands like Louis Vuitton, Christian Dior and Tiffany & Co., revealed record revenue yesterday (July 25) for the first half of 2023. Headed by CEO and chairman Bernard Arnault, LVMH brought in 42.2 billion euros ($46.6 billion) over the past six months—a 15 percent increase compared to the previous year.

LVMH, which is headquartered in Paris, saw its sales increase across Europe by 22 percent compared to the same period in 2022. Consumers in Asia, excluding Japan, also contributed to the record-breaking revenues, with sales rising in the region by 23 percent. Besides wine and spirits, sales across the rest of the company’s business sectors rose as well. “LVMH achieved outstanding results during a six-month period of ongoing economic and geopolitical uncertainty,” said Arnault in a statement, adding that the company is approaching “the second half of the year with confidence and optimism.”

But it didn’t fare quite as well in the U.S., where it saw only a 3 percent increase in sales. “We experienced a little bit of pressure with the American customer to varying degrees among brands,” said Jean-Jacques Guiony, chief financial officer at LVMH, during the company’s second-quarter earnings call. The conglomerate is seeing a decline in shopping from “aspirational customers” in the U.S., according to Guiony, who suggested that waning Covid-related benefits may be playing a part. “If we assume that this is coming from a special group of customers that were benefiting from subsidies in the Covid pandemic period, those will come to an end at some point,” he said.

However, the company’s creative momentum in the U.S. has thrived in the past six months, according to Arnault, who noted the “enthusiastic reception” of the Louis Vuitton men’s show in June. Under the helm of its new creative director Pharrell Williams, the fashion event attracted 1.1 billion views across social media.

More renovations for Tiffany boutiques

Earlier this year, LVMH also unveiled its renovated Tiffany flagship store in New York City—something that should be expected from other Tiffany stores in the future, said Guiony, adding that most of the boutiques will be renovated within the next four years. “Not one single store, apart from the few we have already renovated, are up to our standards,” he said. “It will take time and a lot of money to do them.”

The conglomerate’s CFO also discussed the recent real estate buying spree by LVMH, which has spent more than $1 billion on new properties. “It’s quite opportunistic,” he said, adding that the company is purchasing stores in locations like Paris, London, New York and Los Angeles, where rental fees are set to rise substantially over the next few years. “There may be more to come, but it will depend on the quality of the opportunities that we see.”

The company’s successful earnings come on the heels of its recently announced partnership with the Paris 2024 Olympic and Paralympic Games. LVMH’s companies are set to participate in next year’s games, with jeweler Chaumet designing the medals, Moet Hennessy providing wines and spirits and Sephora helping with activations along the route of the Olympic Torch Relay. Meanwhile, its other brands will announce engagements with the sporting events over the next few months.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.991358757019043}",positive,0.991358757019043,1

"LVMH Net Profit Jumps 30% in H1 on Europe, Asia Growth - WWD","Tue, 25 Jul 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3dkLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy1uZXdzL2ZpbmFuY2lhbC9sdm1oLWZpcnN0LWhhbGYtbmV0LXByb2ZpdC1yb3NlLTMwLXBlcmNlbnQtMTIzNTc1MjU4NS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS — Despite a softening in demand in the key U.S. market, LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton is feeling flush, digging deep into its cash reserves to splash out on spectacular shows and unique store locations.

Reporting first-half results on Tuesday, the world’s biggest luxury group said its operating investments soared to 3.6 billion euros during the period, of which 1.5 billion euros was spent on commercial real estate, including a major acquisition on the Avenue des Champs-Élysées in Paris.

As a result, operating free cash flow was down to 1.8 billion euros from 4 billion euros during the same period a year earlier.

French specialized publication CFNews Immo reported in June that LVMH dropped 770 million euros on the Art Deco building housing its Louis Vuitton flagship, but the group declined to comment.

Jean-Jacques Guiony, chief financial officer of LVMH, merely said the conglomerate acquired “an exceptional building” on the famed thoroughfare, as part of its strategy of investing selectively in key locations in Paris, London, New York City’s Fifth Avenue and Rodeo Drive in Los Angeles.

“I would say it’s quite opportunistic. We do not have global strategy of owning our stores,” he said on a webcast with press and analysts. “There may be a little bit more to come, but it will depend on the quality of the opportunities that we see.”

In parallel, LVMH outgunned its competitors with spectacular events including Pharrell Williams’ debut show as creative director of menswear at Louis Vuitton. Staged on the Pont Neuf bridge in central Paris, the event featured a gospel choir and was capped with a live performance by Jay-Z, garnering more than 1.1 billion views online.

The Vuitton show generated $42.6 million in media impact value, leading the ranking for the men’s season in Paris, according to the latest tallies from data research and insights firm Launchmetrics.

Those large-scale investments weighed on the operating margin of LVMH’s key fashion and leather goods (FLG) division, which fell to 40.5 percent in the first six months of the year, from 41.4 percent during the same period last year.

Weak currencies in China and Japan also dented profitability, but Guiony said margins should recover in the second half, with fewer big-ticket events on the cards and price increases in the pipeline in Japan.

“We intend to defend our full-year margins at the level of last year, obviously, barring significant currency movements,” he said.

However, LVMH revealed on Monday it has signed on to become a premium partner of the Paris 2024 Olympic and Paralympic Games, a move that cost it another 150 million euros, according to sources familiar with the matter.

And it plans to continue investing significantly in U.S. jeweler Tiffany & Co. following the inauguration in April of its sprawling new flagship on Fifth Avenue, dubbed the Landmark. That multiyear refurbishment is understood to have cost hundreds of millions of dollars, according to sources, including artworks by Julian Schnabel and Jean-Michel Basquiat.

“It’s doing very well,” Guiony said of the store. “The benefit of the Landmark is not only the business we do there, but the impact it has on the global image of the brand.”

While the U.S. accounts for around 42 percent of its sales, the jeweler is upgrading its stores worldwide, the latest being its renovated flagship in Tokyo’s Ginza district.

“We have to redo basically the whole fleet. I mean, not one single store, apart from the few ones that we have already renovated, are up to our standards, and it will take time and a lot of money to redo them,” Guiony said.

“What we want is within three, four years, max, to have redone most of the network of stores at Tiffany, and that’s a significant capital cost that we have to bear,” he added.

LVMH’s sheer scale puts it in an unparalleled position to invest in its brands. “This doesn’t mean that we are immune to any external shocks, it just means that we have the ability to face more adverse conditions and to emerge from them stronger than ever,” Guiony said.

The group said net profit jumped 30 percent to 8.48 billion euros in the first half, as strong demand in Europe and Asia helped fuel double-digit growth in most divisions.

Profit from recurring operations totaled 11.57 billion euros, representing an increase of 13 percent year-over-year. This was below a FactSet-compiled consensus estimate of 11.75 billion euros.

But several indicators pointed to weakening momentum, with a drop in cognac sales reflecting a slowdown in the U.S. market, according to the figures published after the market close.

Group sales in the three months to June 30 amounted to 21.20 billion euros, broadly in line with analysts’ expectations. This represented a rise of 17 percent at constant exchange rates, in line with the first quarter.

“LVMH achieved outstanding results during a six-month period of ongoing economic and geopolitical uncertainty,” LVMH chairman and chief executive officer Bernard Arnault said in a statement.

“Thanks to the desirability of our brands, we approach the second half of the year with confidence and optimism but will remain vigilant within the current environment and count on the agility and talent of our teams to further strengthen our global leadership position in luxury goods in 2023,” he added.

The FLG division recorded a 21 percent increase in organic sales in the three months to June 30, a quarterly acceleration in line with analysts’ forecasts. The division posted an operating profit of 8.56 billion euros, up 14 percent year-on-year, boosted by star brands Louis Vuitton and Christian Dior.

But sales of wines and spirits fell 8 percent in organic terms during the second quarter, as demand for Hennessy cognac was impacted by the worsening U.S. economic environment and high inventories in the market. This compared with a 3 percent increase in the first quarter, and with forecasts for a 2 percent decline in the second quarter.

Luxury stocks took a hit last week after rival Compagnie Financière Richemont reported a surprise drop in revenue from the Americas in the three months ended June 30, as the region was impacted by a cost of living crisis, rising interest rates and an overall slowdown in luxury spending on the part of the aspirational consumer.

LVMH said sales in the U.S. were down 1 percent in the second quarter, following an 8 percent increase in the first three months of the year.

“We are experiencing drops with entry-price products, with online sales, with second-tier cities, which is a clear sign that the aspirational customers are not shopping as much as they used to, and conversely, the rest of the portfolio is doing pretty well,” Guiony said.

By contrast, sales in Asia, excluding Japan, were up 34 percent in the second quarter, following a 14 percent rise in the first quarter.

Overall sales of watches and jewelry rose 14 percent on an organic basis, up from an 11 percent increase in the first quarter, while perfumes and cosmetics posted a 16 percent rise, versus a 10 percent increase in the prior quarter.

In selective distribution, sales were up 25 percent in the quarter, versus 28 percent in the first three months of the year, reflecting the continued strong performance of Sephora, which opened its first U.K. store in March, and a recovery of its travel retail business DFS, as tourism resumes in hubs such as Hong Kong and Macau.

“Overall, we may see a modest negative share price reaction to this print, given lack of top line beat particularly at fashion & leather, and the slight EBIT miss (although we believe it is a ‘high quality’ miss, given it relates to elevated marketing spend,)” Piral Dadhania, analyst at RBC Capital Markets, said in a research note.

Kering is due to unveil its second-quarter results on Thursday, and Hermès International on Friday.","{'label': 'Negative', 'score': 0.8894056081771851}",negative,0.8894056081771851,-1

The company, which is headquartered in Paris and houses luxury labels including Louis Vuitton, Christian Dior and Tiffany & Co., among others, saw its sales increase by 22% across Europe, compared to the same period last year. Revenues in Asia, excluding Japan, also heavily contributed to LVMH’s sky-high revenue, and overall, the group recorded organic revenue growth of 17% when weighed against the first half of 2022.

In a statement, Bernard Arnault, chairman and CEO of LVMH, said, “LVMH achieved outstanding results during a six-month period of ongoing economic and geopolitical uncertainty. Thanks to the desirability of our brands, we approach the second half of the year with confidence and optimism but will remain vigilant within the current environment and count on the agility and talent of our teams to further strengthen our global leadership position in luxury goods in 2023.”

However, LVMH did not perform as well in the U.S., charting a small 3% increase in sales in the region. “We experienced a little bit of pressure with the American customer to varying degrees among brands,” said Jean-Jacques Guiony, chief financial officer at LVMH. “If we assume that this is coming from a special group of customers that were benefiting from subsidies in the Covid pandemic period, those will come to an end at some point.”

On a global scale, LVMH reported a 20% increase in revenue for fashion and leather goods, while its perfumes and cosmetics sector earned a 13% increase in revenue. Watches and jewelry, meanwhile, recorded organic revenue growth of 13%, and selective retailing saw a 16% increase.

The owner of Louis Vuitton is pouring €150 million ($166 million) into the Olympic and Paralympic games, the biggest sponsorship commitment of any company, according to people familiar with the matter who declined to be named.

The announcement by Europe’s most valuable company ends months of speculation over its participation in the sporting events. LVMH joins a list of premium partners that includes telecoms carrier Orange SA, Air France-KLM and grocer Carrefour SA.

Some LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE brands have been official partners of global competitions, including watchmaker Hublot, which has been the official timekeeper of the football World Cup. But this is the first sponsorship by the luxury conglomerate headed by Bernard Arnault — the world’s second wealthiest person after Elon Musk.

The deal “will contribute to heightening the appeal of France around the world,” Arnault said in a statement. LVMH’s jewelry brand Chaumet will design the games’ medals while wines and spirits produced by Moet Hennessy will be served to hospitality guests.

The Summer Olympics will take place next year between July 26 and Aug. 11, mostly in the French capital although some events will take place in Marseille and Tahiti. They’ll be followed by the Paralympic Games between Aug. 28 and Sept. 8. Other French companies are dashing to secure sponsorship deals as the events near.

Air France struck a deal to become so-called level-2 sponsor, which will help give the brand more visibility and win new customers, group Chief Executive Officer Ben Smith said in a phone interview Monday. He declined to elaborate on cost.

“This is not charity,” Smith said. “It’s a great way for Air France to show the best of itself and to help show the best of France and the best of Paris. We think the risk of a negative return on investment is almost zero.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999834299087524}",neutral,0.9999834299087524,0

The CEO behind brands like Louis Vuitton, dior (CHDRY) and Tiffany & Co has been snapping up commercial real estate properties across Europe and the U.S. in a bid to further expand his empire.

But he’s not the only one. Kering, the luxury conglomerate founded by Francois Pinault that encompasses brands like Gucci, Saint Laurent and Bottega Veneta, is following the French billionaire’s lead. Both LVMH and its primary competitor have spent billions on new properties in recent months, all the while pushing one of the largest feuds in corporate history back into the spotlight.

Arnault, currently the world’s second richest person with an estimated net worth of $236 billion, quietly picked up a $22 million property in East Hampton earlier this year. At 5,000 square feet, the acquisition represented the largest ever price-per-square-foot commercial real estate transaction in the Hamptons, Suffolk County or Nassau County. Located on the busy corner of Newtown Lane and Montauk Highway, the two-story building was previously owned by designer Elie Tahari and later leased by Cartier before it was purchased by LVMH in April, which plans to utilize the space as a Louis Vuitton boutique.

The month prior, an LVMH affiliate also expanded into Beverly Hills. A 14,000-square-foot retail property located at 357 N. Beverly Drive sold for $43 million in March, according to CoStar, which reported an entity tied to Barack Ferrazzano, a real estate firm representing LVMH, as the buyer.

LVMH’s most notable real estate transactions have occurred in Paris, where the luxury behemoth is headquartered. Earlier this month, Arnault reportedly shelled out between 770 million euros ($865 million) and 900 million euros ($1 billion) to purchase the Louis Vuitton flagship store at 101 Avenue des Champs-Elysées. Commissioned in the 1920s by the son of the eponymous founder of Louis Vuitton, the seven-story building totals 101,000 square feet and recently underwent renovations. Three other Parisian properties totaling at 300,00 square feet, located at 22 Avenue Montaigne, 7 Rue de la Paix and 12 Place des Etats-Unis, have also been acquired by LVMH for more than $300 million euros ($337 million), according to a report from real estate consultancy Knight Frank.

Closely following LVMH’s move is Kering, which plans to open a new Gucci flagship store across the road from Louis Vuitton’s Champ-Elysees location. The 25,000-square-foot boutique will reportedly be housed in four new buildings acquired by Kering in February for 300 million euros ($337 million), located at 235 Rue Saint-Honore and 12-14 Rue Castiglione.

Earlier this year, Kering purchased two other Parisian buildings on 35-37 Avenue Montaigne for 1 billion euros ($1.1 billion) from British businessman Adrien Labi. The acquisition once again represents a challenge to LVMH, with one of the properties earmarked to become a Saint Laurent store directly across from the headquarters of Dior.

Why are Bernard Arnault and Francois Pinault rivals?

As the founders of two of the largest names in luxury goods, Arnault, 74, and Pinault, 86, have long been in direct competition with each other beyond real estate properties. Known for his aggressive tactics in the fashion world and nickname of the “wolf in cashmere,” Arnault’s rivalry with Pinault stems back to 1999 when he posed a takeover threat to Gucci.

Arnault had acquired a 34 percent stock in the luxury brand, which at the time was run by Domenico De Sole, and later offered to buy the company for $8.7 billion. To wade off the LVMH head’s threat, De Sole struck a deal with Pinault, giving him 40 percent ownership and diluting Arnault’s stake in the company. Despite embarking on a years-long legal battle over Gucci known as “the war of the sharks,” Arnault eventually agreed to sell his shares, with Pinault later acquiring majority ownership of the brand.

The rivalry between the two luxury tycoons, which was even covered in the HBO Max miniseries “Kingdom of Dreams,” has continued since then, with Arnault and Pinault closely following each other’s business moves. They both own competing wine estates in Bordeaux, which contains both LMVH’s Cheval Blanc and Kering’s Latour. In 2017, Pinault acquired a Burgundy vineyard located next door from one owned by Arnault. The LVMH head even purchased Phillips in 1999 to compete with Pinault’s ownership of Christie’s, although he later sold the auction house in 2003.

The French businessmen also share a love for art. Pinault began ceding his empire to his son Francois-Henri, who is additionally known for his marriage to actress Salma Hayek, in the 2000s in order to focus on bolstering his collection. After his plans to build a museum in Paris were halted over environmental and legal issues, Pinault, the world’s 36th richest person with an estimated net worth of $37.4 billion, opened two galleries in Venice instead.

However, he was later one-upped by Arnault, who in 2014 launched the Louis Vuitton Foundation, a museum housing his private collection in France’s capital. Pinault eventually fought back with the 2021 opening of the Bourse de Commerce, investing 108 million euros ($121 million) to turn a Parisian building into a museum showcasing his thousands of works.

Even philanthropy has become a source of tension between the two billionaires. After the 2019 Notre Dame fire, Pinault pledged $112 million to help reconstruct the French landmark. Hours later, he was overshadowed by Arnault, who doubled his pledge to $224 million.

Despite competing for dominance in the luxury world, Arnault and Pinault have joined forces on occasion. In 2009, the two billionaires reportedly attended the same lunch at the behest of former French president Nicolas Sarkozy. And six years later, LVMH and Kering teamed up to announce a charter providing protections for models. In response to allegations of abuse and unhealthy weight standards, both conglomerates banned models under size 0 and aged 16 or younger from working with any of their brands, in addition to providing psychologists on call for models during working hours.

But that went sour. In a sign that their rift will likely continue on into the next generation, the sons of Arnault and Pinault spoke for their family companies as joint support of the charter crumbled. In 2019, Kering decided to also ban models under age 18 from working with their companies. “We believe that we have a responsibility to put forward the best possible practices in the luxury sector and we hope to create a movement that will encourage others to follow,” said Kering CEO Francois-Henri of the news. Arnault’s son Antoine, then the head of communication at LVMH, quickly made his opposition clear. “We are sticking to our position,” he said at the time. “We will not be following suit.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999966621398926}",neutral,0.9999966621398926,0
LVMH Reports Unexpected Slowdown - PYMNTS.com,"Wed, 26 Jul 2023 14:03:22 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnB5bW50cy5jb20vbmV3cy9yZXRhaWwvMjAyMy9sdm1oLXJlcG9ydHMtdW5leHBlY3RlZC1zbG93ZG93bi_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"During the second quarter of 2023, LVMH’s portfolio brand Loewe secured the top spot on Lyst Index — a quarterly report that considers Lyst shoppers’ behavior, which includes searches on and off the platform, product views, and sales data.

But despite claiming the top spot, and the glimmer of hope Loewe provided, LVMH observed that it did not lead to an increase in spending among U.S. consumers.

Tuesday (July 25), the luxury giant LVMH reported a drop in U.S. sales during the second quarter. The company’s chief financial officer said there has been a decrease in shopping activity among aspirational customers compared to their previous habits.

During the second quarter, U.S. sales fell 1% year over year (YoY). In a similar fashion, earlier in the month, Richemont, the Swiss owner of Cartier, faced an unexpected decline in revenue from the Americas during the three-month period ending in June.

During the earnings call Tuesday, LVMH CFO Jean-Jacques Guiony attributing the U.S. sales decline to a reduction in spending by aspirational consumers on entry-level products. While unable to pinpoint the precise reason for the decline, Guiony hinted that the waning impact of stimulus payments might have contributed to the sales drop.

“If we assume that that group was benefitting from subsidies during COVID, those come to an end at some point,” Guiony said.

Guiony mentioned that LVMH’s high-priced goods are performing well in the U.S., possibly because wealthier shoppers are less affected by inflation, student debt, and economic fluctuations. However, the segment that felt the most significant impact was wine and spirits, particularly cognac.

According to Nielsen IQ data, the decline could be attributed to the surge in nonalcoholic spirit sales, nearly doubling their growth and outpacing the sales increase of nonalcoholic wine and beer.

LVMH also acknowledged encountering challenges with inventory management during and after the pandemic, leading to difficulties in effectively controlling pricing and supply.

According to Guiony, the slowdown in U.S. sales was additionally influenced by Americans opting to vacation in Europe and purchase luxury goods in cities like Paris, Rome, or London instead of the U.S. LVMH sales in Europe grew 18% in the second quarter, with tourists contributing nearly half that growth.

Last year, LVMH observed a similar shift in spending patterns, as Americans traveled to Europe in large numbers, which partially affected sales in the U.S.

On the flip side, China presented a contrast to the U.S., as LVMH reported a 17% increase in sales during the quarter, with a boost of 34% in Asia excluding Japan.

Guiony pointed out that despite signs of a slowdown in the broader Chinese economy, luxury spending in China remains “strong” since the easing of lockdowns late last year. LVMH’s Bulgari jewelry brand, a favorite in Asia, demonstrated robust results. In contrast, Tiffany, which relies more heavily on the U.S. market, had a weaker performance.

Guiony said that in the past, a significant portion of Chinese luxury purchases took place in Europe. However, recently most purchases are made in China and Japan due to the yen falling, causing prices to drop.

“There are big price differences between China and Japan. But we will see prices in Japan start to rise,” Guiony said.

LVMH by the Numbers

For the first half of 2023, LVMH revenue reached €42.2 billion, a 15% increase YoY. The second quarter of 2023 mirrored the trend seen in the first quarter, with organic revenue growth remaining steady at 17%.

Profit from recurring operations for the first half of 2023 rose 13% to €11,574 million, and the operating margin stood at 27.4% of total revenue.

Furthermore, LVMH’s net profit increased by 30% to reach €8,481 million during the first half of 2023.","{'label': 'Negative', 'score': 0.9939309358596802}",negative,0.9939309358596802,-1
LVMH Inks Blockbuster Olympics Deal | BoF - The Business of Fashion,"Mon, 24 Jul 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzb2ZmYXNoaW9uLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy9sdXh1cnkvbHZtaC1pbmtzLWJsb2NrYnVzdGVyLW9seW1waWNzLWRlYWwv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS — If luxury titan Bernard Arnault allowed himself a self-satisfied smirk at last month’s French Open tennis final, now we know why. As the buzz surrounding partnerships between sports and fashion reaches a fever pitch, his company LVMH has sweeping projects in the works to cement its leading position in the space.

At a press conference backdropped by the Eiffel Tower Monday night, luxury’s biggest group announced a historic sponsorship deal with the Paris 2024 Olympic and Paralympic Games. The conglomerate will be a “premium” partner throughout the events, with a handful of its biggest and most French houses also set to roll out brand-specific initiatives: Louis Vuitton, Dior and Berluti will enjoy sponsorship opportunities, including producing uniforms for athletes, while drinks division Möet Hennessy will sponsor and supply champagne for celebrations. High jewellery label Chaumet will produce the competition’s medals.

The announcement came just weeks after the group’s biggest brand, Louis Vuitton, announced its latest brand ambassador: tennis champion Carlos Alcaraz, the 20-year-old Spaniard who went on to win Wimbledon only days later. As the sporting world reveals itself as an increasingly rich terrain for top-end brands, LVMH’s efforts in the space have ramped up group-wide. In the past year, suit- and shoemaker Berluti partnered with Formula One team Alpine while Dior Homme became the elegance partner of football club Paris Saint-Germain. Monday, the group also announced it had also signed an ambassadorship with French swimmer Léon Marchand, who had broken the world record for the 400-metre medley the previous day.

“Just as the Olympic ideal is to push the limits [of athletic achievement], Paris’ beauty inspires us to always go further in the pursuit of beauty,” chairman Arnault, the world’s wealthiest person, said.

LVMH’s big Olympics bet (reportedly as much as 150 million euros, though the group declined to comment on the figure) could be the biggest coup yet for Antoine Arnault, Bernard Arnault’s oldest son, who was named the group’s head of communications and image in 2018.

In recent years, LVMH has sought to shift its corporate image away from that of a secretive, elitist entity puppeteering an armada of over 75 luxury brands, gradually managing to steer the narrative towards its role as a leading employer, taxpayer and booster of “Brand France.” The younger Arnault pledged to “mobilise [the group’s] artisans and ateliers, and put the full force of LVMH behind making the games a success.”

For the group’s brands, sports represent a key front in so-called “cultural” strategies aimed at engaging consumers around affinities beyond fashion alone. In recent years, social-media savvy teams and athletes have learned to use tunnel walks, travel days and other content moments surrounding their sports into opportunities for brand placement beyond the traditional ad spot or step-and-repeat, fuelling increased interest from sponsors.

“You can really see sports becoming more culturally relevant. Sports events are bringing together people from music and cinema more and more. And you see athletes getting interested in fashion, and wearing couture brands in a way they didn’t used to. So sports and fashion start to have more and more in common,” Antoine Arnault said.

While brands as big as Louis Vuitton (which surpassed €20 billion, or $22.1 billion, in annual revenue last year) don’t often limit themselves to communicating on a single national identity, recent months have seen the brand reinforcing its Frenchness with a travel campaign shot at Paris’ Arc de Triomphe and Pharrell’s debut menswear spectacle set on the Pont Neuf crossing the Seine.

The Paris 2024 games have been plagued by construction delays and logistical setbacks, as well as social unrest that put France’s ability to provide a unified, peaceful forum for the competition in question.

Still, organisers aim to produce one of the most telegenic, memorable spectacles in Olympics history: Paris’ first time hosting the games in 100 years is planned to include equestrian events in the gardens of Versailles, fencing under the towering glass ceilings of the Grand Palais (currently under renovation), and cycling around the Buttes Montmartre and open water swimming in the Seine.

A year out from the opening ceremony — which will parade along the banks of the Seine before a finale onlooking the Eiffel Tower — apprehension is starting to give way to excitement for the often fatalistic residents of the French capital. That’s certainly the case at LVMH.

Luxury Stocks Drop After LVMH Results Confirm Weaker U.S. Demand - WWD,"Wed, 26 Jul 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3dkLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy1uZXdzL2ZpbmFuY2lhbC9sdXh1cnktc3RvY2tzLWZhbGwtYWZ0ZXItbHZtaC1yZXN1bHRzLWNvbmZpcm0td2Vha2VyLXUtcy1kZW1hbmQtMTIzNTc1MzQzNi_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS — Luxury stocks took a hit on Wednesday after sector bellwether LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton delivered second-quarter results in line with expectations and confirmed signs of weakening U.S. demand.

The world’s largest luxury group, which routinely beats analysts’ forecasts, said its key fashion and leather good division saw organic sales rise 21 percent in the three months to June 30, a quarterly acceleration in line with analysts’ forecasts. Though Chinese demand recovered as the country reopened in the wake of pandemic shutdowns, U.S. growth slowed, it reported.

Shares in LVMH closed down 5.1 percent, while rival Kering declined 1.8 percent and Hermès International lost 2.3 percent on the Paris Stock Exchange. Compagnie Financière Richemont shares fell 1.5 percent to 136.30 Swiss francs on the Swiss Stock Exchange.

Luca Solca, analyst at Bernstein, said the LVMH figures suggested the sector is entering a period of slightly lower growth.

“Management is satisfied with the results even though they did not beat consensus. This hints at the start of an ‘investment style transition’ for the luxury goods sector, from chasing momentum and positive surprises, to ‘steady state,’ as consumer demand starts to normalize,” he said in a research note.

LVMH said sales in the U.S. were down 1 percent in the second quarter, following an 8 percent increase in the first three months of the year. By contrast, sales in Asia, excluding Japan, were up 34 percent in the second quarter, after a 14 percent rise in the first quarter.

Sales of fashion and leather goods to Chinese consumers were up between 40 percent and 45 percent in the first half of 2023 compared with the same period in 2021, said LVMH chief financial officer Jean-Jacques Guiony, explaining that he did not consider 2022 a reliable basis for comparison because of the widespread disruption caused by COVID-19 lockdowns.

Margins for the division were hit by a rise in spending on advertising and promotions, with marquee events such as Pharrell Williams’ debut show for Louis Vuitton, as well as currency weakness in Japan and China. While the group’s operating profit fell short of consensus expectations, analysts still saw upside for the stock.

“LVMH remains the best-in-class compounder with balanced risk/reward exposure to luxury and premium staples, in our view,” said Piral Dadhania, analyst at RBC Capital Markets.

“Its brand portfolio is arguably the best in the sector, and it benefits from scale advantages (marketing, retail, sourcing, talent development), a strong digital platform, and generates consistent and meaningful free cashflow, supporting its acquisition strategy,” he added.

While revenues for the fashion and leather goods division should normalize, those more exposed to travel retail and wholesale distribution — such as perfumes and cosmetics, and selective retailing — should continue to recover, he predicted. “We expect LVMH to maintain its elevated margin and ROIC [return on invested capital] profile in 2023,” Dadhania said.

Kering is due to unveil its second-quarter results on Thursday, and Hermès on Friday.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.8970250487327576}",positive,0.8970250487327576,1

Revenue in Asia, excluding Japan, rose 23% (pdf) compared to the same period a year ago, as the continent continues to be a lucrative market for the $500 billion company. Sales in the region had already jumped 14% in the first quarter of this year as China emerged from zero-covid restrictions.

Europe also proved a bright spot in LVMH’s results, with sales rising 22% year-on-year. US demand, however, was weaker compared to other regions, increasing just 3% compared to the same period last year. Deutsche Bank analysts noted in May that investors should keep an eye on a drop in US luxury consumption, sparking a selloff that month erased billions from luxury companies’ valuations. LVMH’s stock took a 5% hit at the time, but has since partially recovered.

Stock rout aside, LVMH’s business has proven robust despite soaring inflation, a war in Europe—which caused the company to suspend operations in Russia, with one brand, Sephora, exiting the market altogether—and economic turbulence. Though luxury brands have continued to mark up prices, it has not appeared to impact affluent customers’ appetites for expensive goods.

The majority of LVMH’s business segments, including fashion and leather goods—a core part of the French conglomerate’s sales—saw double digit growth in revenue. A rebound in Asian markets, thanks in part to China’s relaxing of covid restrictions, has also buoyed LVMH’s business growth.

Bernard Arnault is courting the Chinese market

LVMH CEO and chairman Bernard Arnault visited China in June, his first trip to the country since its zero-covid rules were dropped, where he was spotted at a luxury mall in Beijing before making stops in Chengdu, Shanghai, and Hong Kong.

The French billionaire and the world’s second richest person was one of several chief executives making the rounds in China last month, which remains a key market for American and European companies alike. Luxury shoppers in Asia, especially in China, have been the drivers behind LVMH’s surge in sales post-covid.

In June, LVMH opened a sprawling new Sephora in Shanghai, marking another effort to tap into the Chinese market. The so-called “Store of the Future” is part of the company’s “ongoing commitment to deepen…engagement” with China’s beauty community, said Maggie Chan, managing director of Sephora Greater China, in a press release.

Chinese consumers are projected to spend $444.7 billion on luxury goods in 2023, according to market research firm Euromonitor, as reported by the South China Morning Post. LVMH reported that 37% of its revenue came from Asia in 2022.

One more thing: LVMH is a partner of the 2024 Paris Olympics

LVMH confirmed on Monday (July 24) that it will sponsor the Olympic and Paralympic Games held in Paris next year. The group’s brands, including Dior, Louis Vuitton, Chaumet, Moët Hennessy, and Sephora will be directly involved in designing or sponsoring aspects of the event, from refreshments to medals to the Olympic Torch Relay.

The fashion group has committed $166 million (€150 million) towards supporting the games, according to Bloomberg. LVMH also supported the Paris organizing committee’s bid to become host for the 2024 Summer Olympics, providing $2.3 million in backing.

“Sports is a tremendous source of inspiration for our Maisons,” said Arnault in a statement announcing the partnership.

While big spenders are holding up and continuing to purchase statement pieces, aspirational shoppers in the US are spending less on entry-level items, deterred by economic uncertainty.

As LVMH’s Chief Financial Officer Jean-Jacques Guiony said on the July earnings call, “Last year, [LVMH] was pulled up by the United States because China was slowing down. And this year, the United States is slowing down, yes, but we are drawn by Asia. This geographical balance is absolutely fundamental.”

“Last year, [LVMH] was pulled up by the United States because China was slowing down. And this year, the United States is slowing down, yes, but we are drawn by Asia. This geographical balance is absolutely fundamental.”

According to Bain & Co ., the global personal luxury goods market is still set for further growth, projected to swell by 5 to 12 percent this year. Here’s how LVMH and other luxury businesses are leveraging their different regions to navigate these challenging times.

The world’s largest luxury group recorded revenue of €42.2 billion (46.6 billion) in the first half of 2023, up 15 percent year over year.

LVMH Chairman and CEO Bernard Arnault attributed these results to the strong creative momentum of the company's maisons, including the “enthusiastic reception given to Pharrell Williams’ first fashion show for Louis Vuitton and the reopening of the New York ‘Landmark’ of Tiffany & Co.”

Pharrell’s show reached more than 1.1 billion views on social media, LVMH stated, and was well received by Chinese fans at home and in Paris.

As expected, the fashion and leather goods division had an “outstanding performance,” boasting organic revenue growth of 20 percent. This was led by Louis Vuitton, Christian Dior, Loro Piana and Loewe — the latter of which was recently named the hottest fashion brand of Q2 2023 by the Lyst Index .

For the release of its Paula’s Ibiza 2023 collection, Loewe created a castle installation at the Shanghai Strawberry Music Festival and launched a series of rainbow-colored pop-up boutiques around the country, including in Beijing, Shanghai and Xiamen.

The resumption of international travel was also a boon for the business. Returning to profit, DFS benefited in particular from the return of tourists to Hong Kong and Macau, while the La Samaritaine in Paris welcomed an increasing number of Asian visitors.

However, these accomplishments were clouded by a slowdown in the US, where revenues rose just 3 percent — compared to 24 percent over the same period in 2022. On July 26, shares of LVMH fell 5.2 percent in its biggest one-day percentage loss in nearly 17 months while the pan-European STOXX 600 index shed 0.5 percent.

With “aspirational shoppers not spending as much as they used to,” as Guiony described, sales of Cognac took a hit. Recent visits to China by Bernard Aranult this summer suggest a renewed focus on the Asia Pacific market, which may be necessary to balance out the sluggishness in the states.

The world’s second biggest luxury firm also had a solid start to the financial year, posting a 19 percent year-over-year increase in sales to €5.32 billion (5.98 billion) at constant exchange rates in the first quarter ended June 30, 2023.

Richemont’s Asia Pacific region boasted the strongest performance with a 40 percent rebound in sales, thanks to double-digit growth in mainland China and triple-digit growth in Hong Kong and Macau. Europe also performed well, sustained by domestic demand and tourist spending from American, Middle Eastern and, more recently, Chinese clients. These markets helped to offset the 2 percent sales contraction in the Americas.

In terms of business divisions, jewelry maisons Buccellati, Cartier and Van Cleef & Arpels recorded the strongest sales growth, up 24 percent, while specialist watchmakers jumped 10 percent. During the three-month period, Cartier was particularly active on the global stage, hosting its month-long “Into the Wild” exhibition in Guangzhou, backing French photographer and filmmaker Raymond Depardon’s first solo exhibition in Shanghai, and presenting awards to impact-driven entrepreneurs as part of its Cartier Women’s Initiative in Paris.

However, these results did not impress investors as Richemont shares fell 10.4 percent in their sharpest one-day percentage fall in over a year following the earnings announcement on July 17. The Switzerland-based conglomerate did not provide an outlook for the rest of the year but raised concerns that China’s macro economy “could impact both high-end and aspirational consumers” on a call with analysts.

The Italian luxury fashion group reported consolidated revenues of €1.13 billion (1.25 billion) in the six months ended June 30, 2023, up 24 percent year over year at both current and constant exchange rates. This is the first time in the company’s history that group revenues have surpassed the €1 billion mark in the first half of the year.

In Asia, Q2 revenues accelerated 55 percent year over year, thanks to an easy comparable base in the Chinese mainland, which saw one-third of local stores close in April and May of 2022. That doesn’t mean the group wasn’t proactive about expansion: Not only did the Moncler brand open a new location at Shanghai’s Plaza 66 mall and participate in Tmall’s 618 Festival for the first time, it also released a collection with Hiroshi Fujiwara's streetwear label Frgmt.

In contrast, the Americas region declined by 5 percent year over year in the second quarter, largely due to the impact of the conversion of Nordstrom from a wholesale to a hybrid business model. “Excluding the impact of the Nordstrom conversion, growth in the Americas would have been positive in the second quarter,” Moncler Group stated in a press release.

In light of recession risks, the company plans to stay agile and reactive. In 2023, Moncler Group aims to strengthen its flagship brand by embracing new creative talents and launching distinctive events, while helping Stone Island penetrate less mature regions with high potential under the leadership of the latter's newly-appointed CEO.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.6964560151100159}",positive,0.6964560151100159,1

The company—which owns high end brands like Louis Vuitton, Tiffany Christian Dior, and Bulgari—said profits in America fell 1 percent in the second quarter from the prior-year period, CNBC reported. CFO Jean-Jacques Guiony explained that “aspirational customers are not shopping as much as they used to.“

Guiony said high-end goods from LVMH’s highest priced brands remain strong in the U.S., most likely due to wealthier people who are less vulnerable to factors like inflation, student debt, and the greater economy, according to CNBC. The segment that took the biggest hit was wine and spirits, particularly Cognac. The company said that maintaining inventory was difficult during the pandemic, which made pricing and supply difficult to control.

Another reason given for the poor sales in the U.S. was the depletion of stimulus payments amid Covid-19. “If we assume that that group was benefitting from subsidies during Covid, those come to an end at some point,” Guiony said, according to CNBC.

Guiony also speculated that Americans traveled to Europe for vacations and bought their luxury goods in Paris, Rome, or London. Supporting that assertion was the fact that the company’s Europe sales increased 18 percent in the second quarter, with tourists being responsible for nearly half of that amount. Last year, the company saw the same trend of Europe consuming sales in America.

But again, LVMH has been kept in good shape due to Asia’s booming business. China’s sales rose 24 percent in the first half of the year, though it should be noted prior sales were at base levels due to coronavirus lockdowns, The Financial Times reported.

“Last year, the group was pulled up by the United States because China was slowing down. And this year, the United States is slowing down, yes, but we are drawn by Asia,” Guiony said, according to FT. “This geographical balance is absolutely fundamental.”","{'label': 'Negative', 'score': 0.8097140192985535}",negative,0.8097140192985535,-1
EXCLUSIVE: LVMH Announces Major Water Use Reduction Target - WWD,"Mon, 10 Jul 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3dkLmNvbS9zdXN0YWluYWJpbGl0eS9idXNpbmVzcy9sdm1oLWFubm91bmNlcy1tYWpvci13YXRlci11c2UtcmVkdWN0aW9uLXRhcmdldC0xMjM1NzI5Njg4L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS — As France faces an unprecedented drought, LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton is adding a new component to its “Life 360” global environmental targets to tackle water use.

The group has vowed to reduce its overall water consumption footprint by 30 percent by 2030 across its global activities.

“Reducing water consumption has been an integral part of LVMH’s environmental strategy for the past 10 years. In response to growing pressure on this essential resource, the group has set targets for controlling consumption across its entire value chain: as a leader in the luxury goods industry, it is our responsibility to mobilize all stakeholders around the sustainable use of water,” LVMH environmental development director Hélène Valade told WWD.

While water use has been included in its strategy, the current situation has caused the company to take a fresh look. “Given the urgency of the water situation in France, but also in many regions of the world, LVMH is increasing its ambition,” the company said in a statement.

It comes on the heels of the company’s energy sobriety plan, unveiled last September, to reduce its energy use by 10 percent.

“Under the dual pressure of demographic change and the consequences of global warming, water is now a resource under stress. It is subject to restrictions on use and requires the adoption of specific action plans,” the company said, citing the targets announced by French president Emmanuel Macron on March 23.

Macron laid out a strategy for industrial sectors to reduce their water use, including a goal of recycling and reusing 10 percent of water by 2030.

LVMH’s aim is for 30 percent, and looks to some of its current successes in this area for inspiration.

The company will employ pressure indicators and geolocation data to deploy specific action plans in the areas suffering from water stress, use new technologies to reuse treated wastewater and recovering rainwater on the group’s production sites, and will continue to expand the group’s regenerative agriculture program launched in 2021, which improves soil quality and water retention, as some of the methods to reach the target.

In addition, the company will introduce more manufacturing processes that consume less water. LVMH has already introduced these types of systems at its Loro Piana brand. The luxury cashmere clothing and textile maker reduced its water consumption by 25 percent between 2019 and 2022, credited to deploying wastewater recycling equipment in its Italian factory.

Cognac brand Hennessy reduced the water consumption at its distilleries by 26 percent between 2019 and 2020 by altering its manufacturing processes.

Lessons from these cases will be applied across the wider group activities.

While water is most evidently critical to its cognac and Champagne labels, the company is also framing it as a business decision to future-proof many of its core segments, including accessories and beauty.

“Water is also essential to its perfumes and cosmetics, as well as to the raw materials for its fashion and leather goods, it is in fact a strategic resource that contributes directly to the high quality of the products developed by LVMH, and it is therefore its responsibility to act to preserve it,” the company added.

It is the first step in LVMH’s overall water strategy. The company will set qualitative standards for use reduction and discharge, to be validated by the Science Based Targets for Nature group, a coalition of NGOs that helps companies assess their impact on nature. Those are expected to be revealed later this year.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.98911052942276}",neutral,0.98911052942276,0
LVMH Wants to Remodel Every Tiffany Store - JCK,"Fri, 28 Jul 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmpja29ubGluZS5jb20vZWRpdG9yaWFsLWFydGljbGUvbHZtaC1yZW1vZGVsLWV2ZXJ5LXRpZmZhbnktc3RvcmUv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LVMH says that all 300-plus Tiffany stores will have to be remodeled, and it’s planning to make over most of them within the next four years.

“We have to redo basically the whole fleet,” said chief financial officer Jean-Jacques Guiony on a conference call following the release of LVMH’s latest results, according to a SeekingAlpha transcript. “Not one single store, apart from the few ones that we have already renovated, are up to our standards. And it will take time and a lot of money to redo them.

“We won’t do them all in the format of [Tiffany’s remodeled New York City flagship]. We’ll be adapting to the various markets. But at the end of the day, what we want is within three, four years max to have redone most of the network of stores at Tiffany. And that’s a significant capital cost that we have to bear. But frankly what we want to do with the brand cannot be done in the existing network.”

Guiony said that the new Tiffany flagship, which it’s dubbed the Landmark, “is doing very well, if not better than our plans.”

The New York store symbolizes “what we want the brand to become,” he said. “The benefit of the Landmark is not only the business we do there, but the impact it has on the global image of the brand.”

LVMH bought Tiffany in 2021 for $16 billion. Its decision to remodel all its stores contradicts LVMH’s initial post-takeover assertions that it wouldn’t change anything about the way Tiffany did business. While those assurances are not uncommon following a corporate acquisition, LVMH was unusually emphatic about them.

“For a long time, it was not obvious to us what we could do better [at Tiffany],” Guiony said in 2019. “The answer is that we would not do much better or much differently, but we will enable [its] strategy.”

Some veterans have criticized the LVMH makeovers. Tiffany “used to be a very warm, open place,” one former executive told JCK last year. “It’s become more exclusive. When you see the new store design in Boston, you wouldn’t think people would want to spend $200 in there.”

However, on X (formerly Twitter), analyst Paul Zimnisky said the move makes sense. “The acquisition has already been quite financially successful for them,” he wrote. “They are just reinvesting in the business, which is what more jewelers should do.”

Whether this ambitious strategy will pay off is another matter. Pauline Brown, former chair of LVMH North America and a professor at Columbia Business School, told the Financial Times in April she had never seen a jewelry company pour money into a brand “on the scale that LVMH needs it to work to see a return on its investment”

LVMH does not provide detail on the performance of individual retailers, but with its latest financial results, it said Tiffany showed “impressive growth in high jewelry, and strong creative momentum.”

LVMH fashion sales rise 21% in Q2 on Asia rebound as the US dips - Vogue Business,"Tue, 25 Jul 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZvZ3VlYnVzaW5lc3MuY29tL2Zhc2hpb24vbHZtaC1mYXNoaW9uLXNhbGVzLXJpc2UtMjEtaW4tcTItb24tYXNpYS1yZWJvdW5kLWFzLXRoZS11cy1kaXBz0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"To receive the Vogue Business newsletter, sign up here.

LVMH’s fashion and leather goods sales grew 21 per cent in the second quarter to €10.43 billion, the company said Tuesday, roughly in line with consensus expectations of 20.8 per cent. Growth was led by a strong performance in Asia, but the US market remained a laggard.

For the entire group, organic revenue growth was 17 per cent in the quarter to €21.2 billion compared to the same period in 2022. Profits from recurring operations were up 13 per cent in the first half, to €11.6 billion.

“LVMH achieved outstanding results during a six-month period of ongoing economic and geopolitical uncertainty. The strong creative momentum and excellent distribution of our maisons continued to inspire dreams, as demonstrated by the enthusiastic reception given to Pharrell Williams’s first fashion show for Louis Vuitton as well as the reopening of the New York ‘landmark’ of Tiffany & Co,” LVMH chairman and CEO Bernard Arnault said in a statement.

Asia, excluding Japan, and Europe sales rose 34 per cent and 19 per cent, respectively, while sales in the US fell 1 per cent, a deceleration compared to the first quarter when sales in the US were up 8 per cent. By comparison, Richemont’s share price was down 6.5 per cent after the Swiss conglomerate reported sales up 19 per cent in the quarter ending 30 June, below consensus expectations (at 20 per cent) with a 2 per cent fall in revenue from the Americas. Burberry also reported revenue in the US fell 8 per cent. Prada, Moncler, Kering and Hermès are to report their numbers later this week.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9999984502792358}",positive,0.9999984502792358,1
How Badly Does LVMH Want Alessandro? - Puck,"Thu, 06 Jul 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiNmh0dHBzOi8vcHVjay5uZXdzL2hvdy1iYWRseS1kb2VzLWx2bWgtd2FudC1hbGVzc2FuZHJvL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"SHARE

Was that picture of Dakota Johnson wearing a Chanel bag in his Instagram Story supposed to be some sort of Easter egg? Did Bidayat, the investment firm backed by the C.E.O. of Qatari-funded luxury group Mayhoola, really buy dormant Italian label Walter Albini just for him? Is he next in line at Louis Vuitton? The rumors swirling around Alessandro Michele’s next move abound, but the only thing I know for sure is that the former Gucci designer, who spent 20 years at the Kering-owned leather goods house, seven as its star, recently met with LVMH heir and current Dior C.E.O. Delphine Arnault. (A spokesperson for the conglomerate didn’t respond to my request for comment.)

Of course, a meeting between an executive and a designer isn’t unusual, and could mean absolutely nothing, or simply be the familiar mating ritual of money and talent circling one another out of mere curiosity, as is often the case. But Delphine, the eldest child of LVMH C.E.O. and chairman Bernard Arnault, the second-richest person in the world, is also a serious business person and perhaps the most well-positioned and quietly ambitious of the heirs. She has been working at the group since 2000—developing close relationships with many of its designers, including Jonathan Anderson (the creative director of Loewe) and Nicolas Ghesquière (the women’s creative director of Louis Vuitton) along the way. She likes designers, real designers, and even spearheaded the LVMH Prize, the group’s annual competition for young talent that serves as a feeder into the $500 billion company’s ecosystem. And, of course, her still-new position as the C.E.O. of Dior—the first of the Arnault children to be in charge of a brand of that size—adds a certain weight to any interaction.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.999991774559021}",neutral,0.999991774559021,0

Godfrey Deeny Published

Jul 12, 2023

Luxury multi-billionaire has been doing a little shopping again – in real estate not in rags. , where he is chairman and CEO, has acquired a major building that contains the flagship superstore on Champs Élysées.

LVMH acquired the building, located at 101 Champs Elysées on the corner of Avenue George V, from Gecina, a quoted real estate company. Real estate sources told that Arnault paid about €770 million for the Art Déco structure. While one broker suggested the price might even have been €900 million.



The acquisition is the latest deal in a Paris real estate buying spree by both Arnault and his greatest rival , CEO of luxury conglomerate , who between them have spent an estimated €2.4 billion on property in the last nine months.

The building at 101 Champs Elysées comprises around 9.400 square meters – including 4,000 square meters of offices, 3,885 square meters of shops, and a further 1,200 square meters that include a nightclub and archive premises. Meaning the average selling price was over €80,000 per square meter. This seven-story complex, which was overhauled in 2006, is easily spotted thanks to a huge LV logo on its cupola.



Gecina, which has been managed by Beñat Ortega for the past year, has a reputation for regularly rotating its portfolio. Though the sale of this rare site and building is the equivalent of selling a family jewel. Built in the 1920s by architect Charles Henri Besnard, 101 Champs-Élysées was coincidently originally commissioned by Vuitton, the only child of the founder of the luxury brand. Gecina confirmed it had sold the building in a release, though did not name the buyer.



According to CFNews Immo, a well-informed French real estate site, the building generates an annual rent of €16.5 million, suggesting a very thin annual return of just 2%! Average yields for central Paris properties are currently running at around 3.5% However, this most likely did not faze Arnault, who has a well-founded reputation for paying top dollar for unique brands and properties, and making them look like smart deals within a decade.



LVMH declined to comment on any of these real estate deals.



Across Paris, the real estate market is generally soft, due to slow growth in the French economy, high interest rates, widespread working from home and recent ecological regulations that require heavy investment in literally hundreds of office buildings to make them carbon neutral. One real estate investor reckons that the luxury retail prices are now on average 16% higher than pre-covid.



LVMH rival Kering has also been busy. As reported, in February it acquired four buildings at 12-14 rue Castiglione for a new superstore for some €300 million. And it acquired the former Canadian Embassy at 35 avenue . The plan – build a mega boutique right opposite the historic headquarters of the leading fashion brand in LVMH, . Construction is already quite advanced.



Elsewhere, the LVMH conglomerate also snapped up a prime building at 7 rue de la Paix, the main artery of the luxury jewelry industry; and paid some €150 million for the building at 19 François 1er, located inside what is known as the Golden Triangle of Paris, located between avenue Montaigne, avenue des Champs-Elysées and avenue George V.



However, the fattest ticket item was 101 Champs-Élysées, known globally for hosting the biggest flagship of the world’s most profitable luxury brand. Even if the building also houses Raspoutine, a famed late night Parisian nightclub on rue de Bassano known for hosting a dissolute crowd.



As already reported by FashionNetwork.com, for its next move, LVMH is mulling installing Louis Vuitton – and a debut LV hotel - at 103 Champs Elysees, in the former stronghold of owned by the government of Qatar. This building, which is currently covered in Dior logos, was initially planned to be a Dior superstore.



While Dior, LVMH’s most important haute couture house, may instead open a major new superstore at 101 Champs-Élysées, after a complete renovation of the commercial shell.

Zegna taps LVMH exec to lead Tom Ford Fashion - Vogue Business,"Tue, 18 Jul 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZvZ3VlYnVzaW5lc3MuY29tL2NvbXBhbmllcy96ZWduYS10YXBzLWx2bWgtZXhlYy10by1sZWFkLXRvbS1mb3JkLWZhc2hpb27SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"To receive the Vogue Business newsletter, sign up here.

Tom Ford Fashion is shaping up. After naming Peter Hawkings as creative director, Zegna Group on Tuesday announced the appointment of Lelio Gavazza to the newly created position of CEO at Tom Ford Fashion.

Gavazza will report to Ermenegildo Zegna, chairman and CEO of Zegna Group, and will work closely with Tom Ford president and CEO Guillaume Jesel, “ensuring the alignment of fashion with the holistic luxury strategy for the brand”, according to the statement. Gavazza’s appointment is effective 18 September.

Gavazza joins from LVMH Group, where he is currently executive vice president, sales and retail at Bulgari. Prior to his current role, Gavazza held a series of key regional leadership roles at Bulgari, including managing director of Greater China, and managing director, Europe, Middle East and Africa.

Estée Lauder Companies acquired Tom Ford in November in a deal valued at $2.8 billion, with the ready-to-wear produced under licence by Ermenegildo Zegna Group, which also owns Thom Browne.

“Lelio’s track record of strong global leadership brings outstanding luxury expertise to Tom Ford Fashion across retail management, wholesale distribution, marketing, digital and key markets, including China,” Gildo Zegna said in a statement. “I have personally known and appreciated Lelio for many years, and I’m confident that his world-class business acumen, deep international experience, and leadership skills will prove invaluable in the development of the Tom Ford Fashion business globally.”

Hawkings, a longtime collaborator of Ford’s, will present his debut collection at Milan Fashion Week in September, signalling a new direction for the American brand that has mostly shown in New York. “Italian craftsmanship and excellence have been a source of inspiration for our collections and I am delighted to be showing during Milan Fashion Week,” Hawkings said earlier this month.

The luxury goods conglomerate posted total revenue of €42bn in Q2 2023, a 15% increase on the same period in 2022.

Sephora was the star player in the company’s selective retail division, which saw revenue increase 26% to total €8.3bn

The beauty retailer saw an “exceptional” performance in the quarter, according to the company, said to be particularly strong in North America, Europe and the Middle East.

This was buoyed by the company’s first store opening in the UK this March, which was hailed as a “huge success”.

Sephora is set to open a second UK location in London’s Westfield Stratford City shopping mall, set to open its doors this November.

LVMH’s Perfumes & Cosmetics division – which includes the likes of Benefit, Acqua di Parma and Marc Jacobs Beauty – also saw “rapid growth” with a 13% increase in revenue to €4bn, which the group attributed to innovation combined with a selective distribution policy.

Christian Dior was said to achieve a “remarkable” performance, driven by its best selling Sauvage men’s fragrance, which secured Johnny Depp as its face in a reported US$20m deal this May.

The luxury brand also benefited from new make-up launches including its Dior Addict Lip Maximizer and Forever Skin Correct foundation.

Rihanna’s Fenty Beauty was also a strong driver of cosmetics sales, with the brand’s Hella Thicc Mascara said to be among LVMH's bestsellers since its launch in March.

Guerlain and Givenchy also saw an uptick in growth, according to LVMH, thanks to their l’Art et la Matière and Gentleman Society fragrance launches respectively.

“LVMH achieved outstanding results during a six-month period of ongoing economic and geopolitical uncertainty,” said Bernard Arnault, CEO of LVMH, who highlighted the group’s “strong creative momentum and excellent distribution”.

“Thanks to the desirability of our brands, we approach the second half of the year with confidence and optimism but will remain vigilant within the current environment and count on the agility and talent of our teams to further strengthen our global leadership position in luxury goods in 2023.”","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 1.0}",positive,1.0,1
Luxury Group LVMH to Sponsor Paris 2024 Olympic and Paralympic Games - WWD,"Mon, 24 Jul 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3dkLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy1uZXdzL2ZpbmFuY2lhbC9sdm1oLXByZW1pdW0tcGFydG5lci1wYXJpcy0yMDI0LW9seW1waWMtYW5kLXBhcmFseW1waWMtZ2FtZXMtMTIzNTc1MTc1Ny_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS — Capping months of speculation, LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton on Monday signed on to become a premium partner of the Paris 2024 Olympic and Paralympic Games, guaranteeing the world’s biggest luxury group prime visibility during the planetary event, including its eagerly awaited opening ceremony.

While LVMH did not disclose the financial terms of the sponsorship deal, sources with knowledge of the matter said it had put 150 million euros on the table. Organizers are billing the Paris Games as “the biggest event in the world,” expected to draw 4 billion TV viewers, 13 million spectators and 20,000 journalists.

The beauty of Paris invites us to seek beauty and in this quest, to constantly outdo ourselves.” Bernard Arnault, chairman and CEO of LVMH

Several major LVMH houses will play a special role during the Games, with jeweler Chaumet designing the medals, and Louis Vuitton, Dior, Berluti, Sephora and the Moët Hennessy wines and spirits division also taking part, the group said.

In addition, LVMH will sponsor athletes including French swimmer Léon Marchand, who this weekend broke Michael Phelps’ last individual world record. Those relationships will pave the way for sports stars to ink brand ambassador contracts with its houses.

Speaking at a ceremony in Paris on Monday, Bernard Arnault, chairman and chief executive officer of LVMH, said the partnership would help to heighten France’s appeal.

“Our houses carry the image of France worldwide. They fuel its popularity in all cultures and I’ve witnessed it during my travels across the planet. In many respects, our houses are symbols of France, its elegance, its audacity and its style. It’s therefore natural for us to support an event that will highlight France, and in particular Paris, on a global scale,” he said.

“Many sporting events will take place against the backdrop of Paris. What setting could be more beautiful, more desirable, more beloved throughout the world than Paris,” he said, comparing the future spectacle to Pharrell Williams’ debut show as creative director of menswear for Louis Vuitton, staged on the French capital’s Pont Neuf bridge in June.

“The beauty of Paris invites us to seek beauty and in this quest, to constantly outdo ourselves,” he said, speaking on the first floor of the Grand Palais Ephémère, a temporary structure with an expansive view of the Eiffel Tower. “Paris is the city of audacity, innovation and ambition.”

Reflecting the group’s economic might, the luxury mogul and his son Antoine Arnault, head of communication, image and environment at LVMH, were joined onstage by French Sports Minister Amélie Oudéa-Castéra; Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo; Thomas Bach, president of the International Olympic Committee, and Tony Estanguet, president of the Paris 2024 Olympic Committee.

The committee was keen to sign LVMH as it inches closer to its target of 1.4 billion euros in sponsorship deals, out of a total budget of 4.4 billion euros. In an interview with WWD earlier in the day, Antoine Arnault described the talks as a courtship dance that lasted more than a year.

“Such an important and wide-ranging partnership is a first for LVMH, so there were long negotiations, not only with the International Olympic Committee and the Paris 2024 Olympic Committee, but also internally to work out the best way to develop this partnership,” he said at the headquarters of Berluti, where he is CEO.

“It was important for us to be a know-how partner, and a partner that really contributes something to these Olympic and Paralympic Games, and not just a sponsor who signs a check and then completely steps back from the event,” he said. “When you think about the amounts that have been committed, it does not seem disproportionate either in terms of time spent.”

Arnault said the thorny issue of international rights had been resolved. Unlike global partners such as Coca-Cola, Omega or P&G, premium partners earn marketing rights for the country where the event is held. LVMH joins a cohort that includes retailer Carrefour and telecommunications operator Orange.

“These Games take place in France and the visibility will start from France, but we obviously have international rights. We can’t tell you exactly and in detail everything that has been negotiated, but you will find out as the partnership is unveiled,” Arnault said.

While the LVMH logo will appear on sponsorship materials, another sticking point was defining the precise roles of its various brands as purveyors of specialized know-how, under the tag line “Artisan of All Victories.” Arnault said it was important to respect existing partnerships, which explains why none of its watch brands will be taking an active role.

Chaumet will design the medals, due to be unveiled early next year. “It’s the first time that a jeweler has designed medals, in association with the Paris Mint,” Arnault said.

He hinted that Dior would be in the spotlight during the opening ceremony, due to take place on July 26, 2024. For the first time in the history of the Summer Olympic Games, the event — conceived by artistic director Thomas Jolly — will take place not in a stadium but on the Seine River and in key locations in central Paris.

“We are the craftsmanship partner of these Olympic Games, and craftsmanship and know-how being one of the specificities of France, almost a question of national pride, this ceremony across Paris will have different themes and moments, and we hope that one of those moments will spotlight France’s craftsmanship, know-how and creative outlook,” Arnault said.

Moët Hennessy, home to 25 wines and spirits brands including Moët & Chandon Champagne, Hennessy cognac and Château d’Yquem wine, will provide its wares as part of hospitality programs. While French law prohibits the sale of alcohol in the sports stadiums and other venues where Olympic events will be held next summer, there are exceptions for VIP suites.

“There are private hospitality zones across Paris in which Moët Hennessy’s products will be available,” said Arnault, noting these were not limited to competition spaces.

Beauty retailer Sephora will be a partner for the Olympic Torch Relay, set to kick off in the southern French city of Marseille on May 8, and will offer activations for the public all along the relay route, as well as at group locations along the itinerary and at stops.

We have made it through COVID-19, we have overcome worse things than the traffic disruption caused by the Olympic Games.”

While Arnault declined to comment on the role of Vuitton, the world’s biggest luxury brand has a history of sports collaborations, producing trophy cases for partners including the NBA, America’s Cup, the FIFA World Cup and the Rugby World Cup, and extending into esports via a partnership with Riot Games, the maker of the “League of Legends” video game.

The brand is likely to have some involvement with the Olympic medal ceremonies, sources said.

Meanwhile, Arnault said Berluti could dress the French delegation for the opening and closing ceremonies, since these are not covered by French athletic brand Le Coq Sportif’s contract as official supplier of the French Olympic and Paralympic team uniforms, designed by Pigalle Paris founder Stéphane Ashpool.

In addition to Marchand, who set a new record on Saturday in the 400-meter individual medley at the World Aquatics Championships in Japan, LVMH expects to partner with another four or five athletes, Arnault said. They will benefit from financial support and privileged introductions to the group’s houses.

“They will not wear an LVMH logo,” he said. “It’s the start of a relationship and after that, they will be able to forge links more specifically with the houses they’re interested in. They become LVMH athletes and then, gradually, this will spread across the group through their meetings and interactions with the various houses and their leaders.”

Vuitton has been stepping up its partnerships with sports stars. Last year, its campaign featuring soccer stars Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo playing chess went viral, and it recently signed tennis phenomenon Carlos Alcaraz as brand ambassador. Meanwhile, Dior’s current campaign for the Lady 95.22 handbag features champion wheelchair fencer Beatrice “Bebe” Vio.

LVMH is also teaming up with one of its existing partners, French charity Secours populaire français, on an initiative to enable access to sports for 1,000 children and young people aged four to 25 who live in vulnerable situations. The group will provide funding for sports association memberships, training programs and beginner classes.

Estanguet told a press conference last week that the Paris 2024 Olympic Committee had recently crossed the threshold of 1 billion euros in sponsorship deals, and expects to end the year with 92 percent of the partnership budget secured.

He noted that in 2016, LVMH was one of the official sponsors of the French capital’s bid for the 2024 Summer Olympics.

“Today, with the LVMH group, Paris 2024 has taken a decisive step forward,” he said in a statement. “This partnership also sends a powerful signal that France’s leading businesses are behind the Paris 2024 Games, which will let our country shine brightly around the entire world.”

Oudéa-Castéra went even further. “It could be the partnership of all superlatives. I think we’re all aware of this: the biggest sporting event on the planet, the largest luxury group in the world, the most beautiful city in the world,” the minister said. “With LVMH, the Games will be brighter. With LVMH, France will be stronger.”

With revenues of 79.2 billion euros in 2022, LVMH may seem well-placed to support the event, but Arnault emphasized it was a first for the luxury group.

LVMH has been stepping up its efforts to be seen as a good corporate citizen amid mounting anti-rich sentiment in France, which was shaken by a series of violent protests this spring against the government’s pension reform, including a demonstration in April that spilled over into its corporate headquarters on Avenue Montaigne.

“I know we’re the biggest French company, but we never do this kind of huge partnership at group level, simply because our group is like a confederation of houses, so it doesn’t really make sense,” he said.

“We’re doing it for the first time out of a sense of responsibility, because we think it’s important that as ambassadors for France, we are present for these Games which promise to be exceptional in Paris,” he said.

Arnault minimized the potential disruption linked to the organization of the event, which has prompted the Fédération de la Haute Couture et de la Mode, French fashion’s governing body, to move forward the dates of the fall 2024 edition of Paris Couture Week.

“We’ll work around it,” he said. “We have made it through COVID-19, we have overcome worse things than the traffic disruption caused by the Olympic Games.”

He said the group’s 75 houses had already requested tickets for their staff and partners to attend competitions, indicating that despite grousing from Parisians about the cost and impact of the event, there will be strong domestic support for the Games.

“Athletes and craftspeople have a lot of things in common: a passion for perfecting repeated gestures, always wanting to do better,” he noted. “The closer we get to the Olympic and Paralympic Games, the more it feels like it was meant to be.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.999996542930603}",neutral,0.999996542930603,0

Speaking of the growth slowdown on its quarterly earnings call, the group’s chief financial officer Jean-Jacques Guiony said: ""We never said that growing 20% per annum, as we've been doing roughly speaking, is a new normal.​""

The slower growth was attributed to fewer US consumers buying luxury goods, as well as lower-than-expected margins due to high marketing spending.

However, sales to Chinese consumers regained momentum and were stronger than the previous quarter.

Makeup and fragrance continued to be a strong point for LVMH, which it said was: ""supported by a highly selective and high-quality distribution policy.”​

The Perfumes & Cosmetics business group recorded organic revenue growth of 13% in the first half of 2023. Profit from recurring operations was up 15%.

Strong sales for Christian Dior​

Christian Dior had an outstanding quarter and the company said it was “strengthening its leadership in its strategic markets.​”

Men’s fragrance Sauvage confirmed its position as the world’s leading perfume, while women’s scents J’adore ​and Miss Dior both enjoyed continued success.

The house's makeup offering also contributed to the strong results and notable products were its Dior Addict Lip Maximizer and Forever Skin Correct foundation.

Its skin care ranges also enjoyed excellent performance, particularly its Prestige​ range in Asia's premium segment.

During the results call, a special mention was given to Christian Dior’s new sustainability initiative, where it is currently transitioning to producing 45% of its alcohol for fragrance formulations using beetroot. Givenchy and Kenzo are also doing the same.

Other noteworthy fragrance houses were Maison Francis Kurkdjian, which saw continued success with the development of its Baccarat Rouge 540 range.

LVMH revealed the brand had been working with Le Jardin de Parfumeur – a garden in the Trianon estate in the Palace of Versailles – where hundreds of perfume plants are being grown for fragrance production.

The group said Acqua di Parma had also ""increased the exclusivity of its offering"". ​

An exceptional quarter for Sephora ​

LVMH said Guerlain continued to grow, driven by its Abeille Royale skincare range and high-end perfumery collection l’Art et la Matière, which has recently launched a new Jasmin Bonheur creation.

Givenchy benefited from a great reception for its new fragrance Gentleman Society.

Benefit expanded its The Porefessional skincare range and launched a new brow lamination service in store.

Makeup Forever saw good results, especially for is new HD Skin Powder. And Fenty Beauty’s new Hella Thicc mascara is already one of the Maison’s bestsellers.

Sephora had an exceptional performance this quarter, which the company said “confirmed its position as world leader in beauty retail.”​

The retailer continued to gain market share and momentum was particularly strong in North America, Europe and the Middle East. Its distribution network continued to expand, especially in the UK where its first store, which opened in March 2023, has proved a huge success.

The retailer plans to open a second store this November in Westfield Stratford City shopping centre in London.

CEO Bernard Arnault highlighted the group’s “strong creative momentum and excellent distribution​”. He also said: “thanks to the desirability of our brands, we approach the second half of the year with confidence and optimism, but will remain vigilant within the current environment and count on the agility and talent of our teams to further strengthen our global leadership position in luxury goods in 2023.”​

News also broke that LVMH has signed as an official partner for the Paris 2024 Olympic Games. The company didn’t disclose the value of the deal.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 1.0}",positive,1.0,1

This exceptional partnership will enable the artisans across the LVMH Group to contribute their creativity, exceptional know-how and unique sense of French art de vivre to the organization of this unmatched celebration of high-level sports.

Emblematic of France’s creativity and worldwide appeal, LVMH has always been inspired by an exceptional spirit of innovation and an exacting quest for excellence. In all of their activities – from fashion and leather goods to perfumes and cosmetics, and from selecting retailing to wines and spirits – LVMH Maisons cultivate the highest levels of quality and embody everything that is most noble in the realm of exquisite craftsmanship. Over several months, Paris 2024 and creative teams from LVMH and its Maisons have explored a shared desire to make these Olympic and Paralympic Games an unforgettable experience that rewrites established codes. The world leader in luxury, LVMH will play a major role by sharing its creativity and craftsmanship for unforgettable moments of celebration throughout the Paris 2024 Olympic and Paralympic Games.

Paris 2024 will entrust several essential roles to artisans from the LVMH Group. These include the design of the Olympic and Paralympic medals by Chaumet. The ultimate emblems of the quest for victory and surpassing oneself, the medals figure among the iconic symbols and traditions of the Olympic Games. An iconic Paris jeweler with centuries of heritage, Chaumet will apply its savoir-faire to create the design of these exceptional pieces that materialize the ultimate reward for athletes after years of sacrifice and commitment to performance.

Moët Hennessy wines and spirits Maisons will provide their exceptional products as part of hospitality programs during the Olympic and Paralympic Games and will help ensure a superb quality experience for guests. Sephora will be a partner for the Olympic Torch Relay, proposing activations for the public all along the relay route, as well as at Group locations along the itinerary and at stops.

Between now and the opening ceremony, LVMH and its Maisons – in particular Louis Vuitton, Dior and Berluti – will present, with approval from Paris 2024, the different aspects of their engagement, enabling LVMH to become the ‘Artisan of All Victories’. During the Games, LVMH will also provide direct support for certain athletes whose exemplary journeys make them ‘Artisans of All Victories’. The first is swimmer Léon Marchand, who at the age of 21 has already won three world champion titles, is the world record-holder of the 400 meter individual medley, and is a leading medal hope for the French Olympic team.

Lastly, as part of its partnership with Paris 2024, LVMH will expand its commitments to society specifically to sports, which inspires dreams and drives positive impact. To kick off this initiative, LVMH will join French charity Secours populaire français, a longstanding partner, and support a very concrete program to facilitate access to sports for 1,000 children and young people aged 4 to 25 who live in vulnerable situations. The Group will provide funding for sports association memberships, training programs and beginner classes.

“This unprecedented partnership with the Paris 2024 Olympic and Paralympic Games will contribute to heightening the appeal of France around the world. It was only natural that LVMH and its Maisons be part of this exceptional international event. The values of passion, excellence and inclusion championed by high-level sports are cultivated each day by our teams, motivated by an unwavering desire to surpass limits. Sports is a tremendous source of inspiration for our Maisons, which will unite creative excellence and athletic performance by contributing their savoir-faire and bold innovation to this extraordinary celebration.” – Bernard Arnault, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of LVMH.

“From the very outset of our project we have wanted the Paris 2024 Olympic and Paralympic Games to contribute to promoting the image of our country and France’s many remarkable talents. Today, with the LVMH Group, Paris 2024 has taken a decisive step forward. LVMH already supported us during our bid for the Summer Olympics and we are thrilled to have the Group with us 100% for this exciting adventure. With its exceptional know-how, the LVMH Group will bring its immensely creative talent to this project and enable us to benefit from its extensive experience. This partnership also sends a powerful signal that France’s leading businesses are behind the Paris 2024 Games, which will let our country shine brightly around the entire world. We want to thank the LVMH Group and its artisans for their confidence and their active engagement. Together we are going to make the Paris 2024 Games a truly exceptional experience.” – Tony Estanguet, President of the Paris 2024 Olympic Committee.

From the very beginning of the Paris 2024 adventure and before the host city for the Olympic and Paralympic Games was selected, LVMH backed the Paris organizing committee’s bid. A good many LVMH Maisons originated in Paris, and Paris has always been intimately linked to the history and success of the Group, which in turn is deeply attached to the city.

This partnership also continues the active support that LVMH and its Maisons have for many years provided for high-level sports and the most prestigious international competitions. From the creation of numerous trophies to the design of trunks made specially to hold them, LVMH Maisons have long been partners to the world of sports, spanning a wide variety of disciplines, from tennis, rugby and basketball to soccer and automobile racing.

Is Blackpink’s Lisa dating an LVMH heir – and will she end her YG contract? - Style,"Tue, 18 Jul 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMipgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5zY21wLmNvbS9tYWdhemluZXMvc3R5bGUvZW50ZXJ0YWlubWVudC9hcnRpY2xlLzMyMjc5ODUvYmxhY2twaW5rcy1saXNhLWRhdGluZy1sdm1oLWhlaXItcnVtb3Vycy1hcmUtcmlmZS1rLXBvcC1zdGFyLWNvdWxkLWJlLXNlZWluZy10YWctaGV1ZXItY2VvLWZyZWRlcmlj0gGmAWh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLnNjbXAuY29tL21hZ2F6aW5lcy9zdHlsZS9lbnRlcnRhaW5tZW50L2FydGljbGUvMzIyNzk4NS9ibGFja3BpbmtzLWxpc2EtZGF0aW5nLWx2bWgtaGVpci1ydW1vdXJzLWFyZS1yaWZlLWstcG9wLXN0YXItY291bGQtYmUtc2VlaW5nLXRhZy1oZXVlci1jZW8tZnJlZGVyaWM?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Over the past few days though, Lisa has been making waves on the internet for two huge if very different topics: her love life after being spotted on multiple occasions with LVMH heir Frédéric Arnault , and a rumoured termination of her contract with YG Entertainment. Phew!

Hardly a day goes by where Blackpink, the world’s biggest K-pop girl group, isn’t in the headlines. The four-member band – comprising Lisa, Jennie, Rosé and Jisoo – has garnered a devoted worldwide following with its members firmly established themselves as the reigning queens of K-pop since their debut in 2016.

But are these rumours even true – and are they connected in any way? Speculation is rife, but that’s all it is for now – speculation. Here’s what we know so far …

How did Blackpink’s Lisa and LVMH’s Frédéric Arnault meet?

It’s unclear when exactly Lisa and Arnault met, but it’s been suggested that they first bonded at an event.

Arnault, 28, is the third son of billionaire Bernard Arnault, the world’s second richest man and boss of fashion conglomerate LVMH. The young Arnault currently heads Tag Heuer. Blackpink’s members, meanwhile, have worked extensively with LVMH brands, from Louis Vuitton campaigns together to individually becoming ambassadors: Lisa with Bulgari, Rosé with Tiffany & Co., Jisoo with Dior and Jennie often sporting labels like Loewe.

Considering their regular collaborations, it’s no surprise that Lisa, 26, who’s also a Celine rep, eventually crossed paths with one of the LVMH heirs.

The romance rumours

Arnault and Lisa have been seen together on numerous occasions, from cosy dinner dates in Paris to Arnault’s presence at Blackpink’s concerts and Coachella this year, and even attending parties together, as evidenced by widely circulated pictures on the internet. Fans have been quick to jump on lovey-dovey rumours, yet neither member of the would-be couple has addressed the speculation surrounding their potential romance.

What the fans and media are saying

Fans are on the fence about this one. Some have been quick to claim that yes, they must be dating, otherwise YG Entertainment would have denied the claims, while others argue that they must just be good friends supporting one another.

Either way, the duo’s hang-outs have sure drawn plenty of speculation from both fans and the media.

What about the YG contract termination speculation?

Perhaps in even more surprising news, media has reported that Lisa may not be renewing her contract. According to The Korea Times, this change of events could be due to a significant gap between Lisa’s demands and what the company is willing to offer her.

The entertainment company has since released a brief statement saying the matter is still under discussion and the uncertainty was due to Blackpink’s tour schedule and the Thai rapper’s individual schedule. “It has nothing to do with the contract renewal. That is currently under discussion,” the company added.

The source stated, “YG’s contract renewal process with the remaining three members of Blackpink is proceeding relatively smoothly.”

If Lisa were to depart from the popular girl group though, it would undoubtedly have a significant impact on its future trajectory.

In K-pop, there is a phenomenon known as the “seven-year curse” where groups often disband after seven years, typically due to the expiration of contracts as it is the maximum contract period for idols. Lisa, perhaps coincidentally, is reaching her seven-year mark this year.

Who else has Lisa – and Blackpink – dated?

It’s widely known that most K-pop agencies impose strict dating bans on their idols, with those that break the rule getting their contracts terminated. While the specific regulations of each agency remain undisclosed, there have been rumours suggesting that Blackpink’s members are prohibited from engaging in romantic relationships.

Throughout the years, Lisa, the youngest member of the group, has not publicly revealed any romantic involvements. However, in a 2018 interview with Airrang Radio, she did mention a preference for older men.

On the other hand, Jennie has been linked to several artists – from Exo’s Kai and BigBang’s G-Dragon to Harry Styles – although she has never publicly confirmed any partners. Her most recent rumoured lover, V , happens to be part of BTS, K-pop’s biggest boy band.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999932050704956}",neutral,0.9999932050704956,0

A couple of weeks back, I got a tip that Bode was talking to LVMH about a strategic investment. This was before the oh-so-precious New York label, founded by designer Emily Adams Bode Aujla, was the subject of a lengthy feature in New York magazine, but after a separate lengthy feature in GQ that wasn’t really pegged to anything in particular, other than Bode liking GQ and GQ liking Bode.

Oftentimes, when a founder looks to sell a stake in their company to an investor, or the devil, or whomever, they’ll attempt to engineer media coverage that sort of puts them on the market, whether or not bankers or lawyers have actually been contacted behind the scenes. Bode, which is owned by the designer but is sort of co-run by her husband (the furniture designer Aaron Aujla) and his brother (Dev, who is officially the C.E.O.), hasn’t quite positioned itself for a story like that: They prefer not to share financial information, and are regularly mad at a variety of the major news outlets.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999954700469971}",neutral,0.9999954700469971,0
LVMH to sponsor the 2024 Olympic Games in Paris - Vogue Business,"Mon, 24 Jul 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZvZ3VlYnVzaW5lc3MuY29tL2Zhc2hpb24vbHZtaC10by1zcG9uc29yLXRoZS0yMDI0LW9seW1waWMtZ2FtZXMtaW4tcGFyaXPSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"To receive the Vogue Business newsletter, sign up here.

It’s official: after months of discussions, LVMH announced on Monday it is sponsoring the Paris 2024 Olympic and Paralympic Games as a premium partner, the highest level for Paris 2024. LVMH spent €150 million to seal the partnership, according to sources.

The announcement kicks off the one-year lead up to the Games, which will run from 26 July to 11 August. During a conference at Grand Palais Éphémère, LVMH chairman and CEO Bernard Arnault, president of the Paris 2024 Olympic organising committee Tony Estanguet, Paris’s mayor Anne Hidalgo and French minister for sports and the Olympic and Paralympic Games Amélie Oudéa-Castéra came together to discuss the sponsorship.

“As a French group, we felt it was our duty to contribute to an event that is destined to leave its mark on an entire generation. For us, and I'm sure for many others, this partnership is a no-brainer,” said Antoine Arnault, who oversees all of the group’s communications and environmental issues and who was the chief negotiator for the sponsorship.

LVMH is the only luxury player among the premium partners of Paris 2024 (others are French bank BPCE, telecommunications company Orange, French energy group EDF, French hypermarket group Carrefour and French pharma group Sanofi), while worldwide partners at the International Olympic Committee level include Swiss watchmaker Omega and e-commerce giant Alibaba. It’s understood that LVMH negotiated to use its sponsorship rights internationally.

“Over several months, Paris 2024 and creative teams from LVMH and its maisons have explored a shared desire to make these Olympic and Paralympic Games an unforgettable experience that rewrites established codes,” according to a statement from LVMH.

Between now and the opening ceremony, LVMH and its maisons — in particular Louis Vuitton, Dior and Berluti — will present, with approval from the committee, the different aspects of the sponsorship. Berluti will dress the French delegation for the various ceremonies, according to sources. Already confirmed: LVMH-owned jeweller Chaumet will design the Olympic and Paralympic medals; Moët Hennessy wines and spirits maisons will provide their products as part of hospitality programmes during the event; and Sephora will be a partner for the Olympic torch relay, proposing activations for the public. It’s understood that watch brands won’t take part, given Omega – owned by Swatch Group – is the official timekeeper of the event.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999979734420776}",neutral,0.9999979734420776,0

CAC 40: LVMH's First-Half Earnings Came With Slower U.S. Growth - TipRanks.com - TipRanks,"Wed, 26 Jul 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRpcHJhbmtzLmNvbS9uZXdzL2dsb2JhbC1tYXJrZXRzL2NhYy00MC1sdm1ocy1maXJzdC1oYWxmLWVhcm5pbmdzLWNhbWUtd2l0aC1zbG93ZXItdS1zLWdyb3d0aNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"French company LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, or LVMH (FR:MC), yesterday announced its second-quarter and first-half earnings for 2023. The company reported slower growth in the U.S. luxury market, which was balanced out by a rebound in China and other Asian markets.

Shareholders appeared somewhat concerned about the U.S. numbers, leading to a slight decline in the share price of 0.42% yesterday. The company’s stock has delivered a return of 18.8% so far in 2023.

LVMH is a well-known European conglomerate that owns around 75 luxury brands across multiple sectors. The company’s product line includes luggage, watches, cosmetics, wine, perfumes, and more.

LVMH Results

In its first-half earnings, the company posted a jump of 15% in its revenues to €42.2 billion, as compared to the same period last year. For Q2, the revenue growth was 17%, with a performance similar to the company’s first quarter. The revenue was higher in all business segments, except for Wines & Spirits, which encountered a challenging comparison due to a high basis in the previous period. The operating profits grew by 13% to €11.5 billion.

Among the segments, Fashion & Leather Goods posted double-digit revenue growth of 20%, well supported by exceptional performances from Dior, Louis Vuitton, Marc Jacobs, etc. On the other hand, the Wine & Spirits division experienced a decline of 3% in sales and 9% in operating profits. This number was due to lower sales of Hennessy cognac in the U.S. and ongoing high inventory levels among its retailers.

Regional Balance

The main focus of the results was on the U.S. numbers, where sales were down by 1% in the second quarter. In the first half, revenues in the U.S. increased by 3%, as compared to a 24% surge during the same period in 2022. The company stated that customers in the U.S. are refraining from purchasing as many luxury items as before due to economic pressures and mounting inflation.

The company is cautious regarding the slowdown in the region and feels more sales pressure in second-tier cities, where there has been significant growth in recent years.

On the contrary, the company’s performance in Europe and Asia was solid, mainly driven by rebounding activities in China. Europe witnessed an 18% increase in sales in Q2, with tourists contributing to nearly half of that gain.

Is LVMH Stock a Good Buy?

Post-results, RBC Capital analyst Piral Dadhania confirmed his Buy rating on the stock, predicting an upside of 17.3% in the share price.

According to TipRanks’ analyst consensus, MC stock has a Strong Buy rating backed by all 10 Buy recommendations.

The average share price forecast is €976.9, which is 19.5% higher than the current price level.

Noted by BoF, the sporting world has become a “rich terrain for top-end brands” in recent years. Before LVMH secured its partnership with the Olympics and Paralympics Games, the group has been actively broadening its involvement with the sporting sphere — a recent example being young tennis champion, Carlos Alcaraz’s appointment as the new Louis Vuitton house ambassador.

As shared in an official press release, LVMH and its Maisons promise to support athletes during the games, specifically those who live up to the motto of being “Artisans of All Victories.” In line with the group’s “The Art of Crafting Dreams” mission, the first sportsperson confirmed to be backed by LVMH is Léon Marchand, who will be representing France’s swim team in the Olympics.

“This unprecedented partnership with the Paris 2024 Olympic and Paralympic Games will contribute to heightening the appeal of France around the world. It was only natural that LVMH and its Maisons be part of this exceptional international event,” said Bernard Arnault, chairman and CEO of LVMH.

Following months of speculation, the luxury conglomerate officially became a premium partner of the upcoming games on Monday.

Between now and the opening ceremony, Louis Vuitton, Dior, and Berluti will also present different aspects of their engagement.

“Sport is a tremendous source of inspiration for our maisons, which will unite creative excellence and athletic performance by contributing their savoir-faire and bold innovation to this extraordinary celebration,” Arnault adds.

Some LVMH brands have previously sponsored global competitions. Hublot was the official timekeeper of the FIFA World Cup, for example. However, this marks a first for the luxury behemoth itself. As you might expect, other big-name companies are following LVMH’s lead. Air France told Fortune that it had secured its own partnership in a bid to increase brand visibility and generate more business.

“It’s a great way for Air France to show the best of itself and to help show the best of France and the best of Paris,” CEO Ben Smith told the magazine. “We think the risk of a negative return on investment is almost zero.”

The Olympics are scheduled to take place from July 26 to August 11, while the Paralympics will run from August 28 to September 8. The majority of events will be set in the French capital, while other festivities will unfold in Marseille and Tahiti.

“We want to thank the LVMH Group and its artisans for their confidence and their active engagement,” Tony Estanguet, president of the Paris 2024 Olympic Committee, adds. “Together we are going to make the Paris 2024 games a truly exceptional experience.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9998406171798706}",neutral,0.9998406171798706,0
'Weak' Hennessy demand hampers LVMH sales - The Spirits Business,"Wed, 26 Jul 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXNwaXJpdHNidXNpbmVzcy5jb20vMjAyMy8wNy93ZWFrLWhlbm5lc3N5LWRlbWFuZC1oYW1wZXJzLWx2bWgtc2FsZXMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"News

By Nicola Carruthers

The wine and spirits arm of LVMH was the only part of the company to decline during the first half of 2023 due to ‘weak demand’ for Hennessy Cognac in the US.

LVMH’s spirits division reported sales of €1.6 billion (US$1.77bn) for the six months to 30 June 2023, representing an 11% decline. The group’s spirits sales also fell by 5% during the first quarter of this year.

In contrast, Champagne and wines rose by 8% to €1.58bn (US$1.75bn) during the first half of 2023.

Hennessy Cognac’s revenue was down after being ‘hampered’ in the US due to high retailer inventory levels and ‘weak customer demand’.

Furthermore, the group noted that Cognac purchases in China were ‘heavily affected’ by the pandemic during the first quarter.

LVMH highlighted that its travel retail revenue had increased and Hennessy had extended its geographic reach.

The group said the performances of its Scotch whiskies, Glenmorangie and Ardbeg, were mainly driven by the launch of new products, including the limited edition A Tale of the Forest and Ardbeg’s BizarreBQ.

Belvedere vodka also continued to grow, driven by ‘strong momentum’ in the ‘high-energy’ club scene.

American whiskey Woodinville increased in the US after expanding into new states. Volcán de mi Tierra Tequila was lifted by the expansion of its XA ultra-premium line.

Meanwhile, Cuban rum Eminente ‘further consolidated its position in Europe’s ultra-premium market’, LVMH noted.

Outlook remains ‘uncertain’

In total, LVMH’s wine and spirits, which sit under its Moët Hennessy subsidiary, reported an organic sales drop of 3% to €3.18bn (US$3.52bn) for the six-month period. Profit from recurring operations dropped by 9%.

Sales for the same period last year were ‘particularly strong’ due to recovery from the pandemic in the US, the Paris-headquartered group noted.

Second-quarter sales of wine and spirits dropped by 8%. It followed a 3% revenue increase for the subsidiary in the first three months of 2023.

In its outlook for wine and spirits, LVMH said the economic environment remained uncertain, particularly in the US.

The group plans to focus on several areas: balanced geographical coverage, a diversified portfolio, and ‘excellence, reputation and capacity for innovation’ across its houses.

Moët Hennessy highlighted the recent opening of its first cocktail bar, Cravan, in Paris, which is in line with the group’s goal of ‘crafting experiences’.

The rest of LVMH’s divisions, which includes fashion and leather goods, and perfume and cosmetics, reported double-digit revenue increases for the six-month period.

In total, LVMH’s organic sales rose by 17% to €42.2bn (US$46.7bn) for the first half of this year.

The firm’s wine and spirits business saw revenue soar by double digits in 2022.","{'label': 'Negative', 'score': 0.9999097585678101}",negative,0.9999097585678101,-1
LVMH China Rebound Offsets Weakening US Demand - The Business of Fashion,"Tue, 25 Jul 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzb2ZmYXNoaW9uLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy9sdXh1cnkvbHZtaC1xMi1jaGluYS1yZWJvdW5kLW9mZnNldHMtd2Vha2VuaW5nLXVzLWRlbWFuZC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LVMH sales in the second quarter were buoyed by a strong rebound in Chinese spending, helping to offset weakening demand from aspirational customers in the US, the group said Tuesday.

Revenue for the first half rose 17 percent year-on-year to €42.2 billion, with sales in Asia, excluding Japan, up 34 percent year-on-year in the second quarter. Profit in the first half grew 13 percent to €11.6 billion, slightly short of analyst expectations. However, Q2 sales contracted 1 percent in the key US market, where uncertain economic backdrop has dampened demand from entry-level shoppers.

“We have a situation where, by and large, the aspirational customer is suffering a bit,” CFO Jean-Jacques Guiony told investors. “We are experiencing drops with entry price products, with online sales, with second tier cities — which is a clear sign that your aspirational customer is not shopping as much as they used to.”

Sales of fashion and leather goods grew 21 percent in the first half to reach €21.2 billion, in line with analyst expectations. But after consecutive quarters of LVMH consistently beating forecasts, the figures suggest the explosive growth luxury’s strongest players experienced post-pandemic is beginning to temper.

“[The results] hint at a first step to normalisation… as consumer demand normalises after the post-pandemic euphoria,” Bernstein analyst Luca Solca said in a note to clients.

“This transition is likely going to produce some turbulence, as we have seen recently with Richemont,” he said. “But — in the absence of a hard landing recession — the sector should soon find an even keel.”

The strength of the Chinese consumer rebound has been a topic of concern for investors recently, as mixed signals in the Chinese economy are driving an uneven recovery across the broader sector.

For LVMH, spending by Chinese nationals in the first half increased between 40 to 45 percent compared with the same period in 2021, said Guiony, who added Chinese spending remains concentrated at home and among regional tourist destinations, with only a “very small” cluster returning to Europe currently.

“We have no groups, we only have individual travellers and they are only a fraction of the clients we used to have,” he said.

Europe, where revenue was up 22 percent in the second half, was boosted by local spending and increased tourism from wealthy US shoppers and Europeans, Guiony said.

Elsewhere, Sephora performed “exceptionally well” in the first half, while DFS benefitted from the return of Chinese tourism, particularly in Hong Kong and Macau.

LVMH-owned Patou is getting into its groove. What's next? - Vogue Business,"Wed, 05 Jul 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZvZ3VlYnVzaW5lc3MuY29tL2Zhc2hpb24vbHZtaC1vd25lZC1wYXRvdS1pcy1nZXR0aW5nLWludG8taXRzLWdyb292ZS13aGF0cy1uZXh00gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"To receive the Vogue Business newsletter, sign up here.

“Parisian, chic, with a touch of fantasy, couture and humour.” This is how Sophie Brocart describes Patou, the once-sleepy LVMH-owned house whose revival she and artistic director Guillaume Henry have been leading over the past few years. Fresh from showing its Spring/Summer 2024 women’s ready-to-wear collection in Paris, she is ebullient about its prospects in fashion.

“I think down the road Patou can become a big house because of its unique but wearable style and its amazing but little-known heritage,” Brocart tells Vogue Business. Plans include a Paris store, international expansion and doubling down on accessories.

Patou is owned by the world’s largest luxury conglomerate, but it still has to navigate a challenging environment that favours big brands with firepower in marketing and retail. Still, LVMH has made clear its intention to support the smaller brands in its portfolio, not just power players like Louis Vuitton. Sidney Toledano, chairman and CEO of LVMH Fashion Group (which includes Patou, alongside Celine, Loewe, Givenchy, Kenzo, Marc Jacobs, Pucci and Rossimoda) says after the show on Sunday: “When you're in a forest, there are shrubs that can grow alongside big oaks, as long as the soil is fertile.”

“With Guillaume, we studied the brand values: make women beautiful with ease and wearability (he was the first couturier to dress sportswomen), be inspired by culture, be in tune with the times, collaborate with friends,” says Brocart. “He was also the first to put his logo on clothes and we have kept the logo as it was,” she adds. The collection, titled ‘Dancing Diaries’, includes a tangerine crop jacket, skirts made for dancing and lots of rhinestones throughout, taking place on a runway that was like a dance floor with a central DJ booth. “I wanted to explore Patou at a cocktail party and at night. We already showed a lot of daywear,” says Henry backstage after the show at Salle Wagram, a former ballroom in the 17th arrondissement (read the Vogue Runway review here).

“It is a festive and joyful show, just like today’s Patou and also yesterday’s Patou. Jean Patou [who established the house in 1914] invented the modern fashion show as we know it: he gathered all the guests in a single big show that was followed by a party,” says Brocart.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999866485595703}",neutral,0.9999866485595703,0
LVMH and SF Express to build sustainable supply chain - Dao Insights,"Fri, 21 Jul 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vZGFvaW5zaWdodHMuY29tL25ld3MvbHZtaC1hbmQtc2YtZXhwcmVzcy10by1idWlsZC1zdXN0YWluYWJsZS1zdXBwbHktY2hhaW4v0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The luxury conglomerate LVMH Group is teaming up with SF Express, the largest comprehensive express logistics group in China, to launch a sustainable supply chain system.

The announcement was made on July 20th following in-person talks between the long-term collaborators at the SF headquarters last week. Executives from both companies conducted in-depth exchanges on the global supply chain, sustainable development, and the role of technological innovation within these areas.

The partnership between the companies goes back to 2014, when Fendi started working with SF Express. Then in 2019, SF Express and LVMH launched a project to provide brands with premium logistics services, including intra-city express delivery, payment collection, and return of signed orders. SF Express has become the main express service provider for LVMH Group brands, transporting more than 10 million parcels over the past ten years for the luxury giant.

Part of LVMH’s investment in the Chinese market includes a commitment to support the development of local infrastructure. Teaming up with SF Express supports LVMH to delve further into the “sinking market” of China’s Tier-2 and Tier-3 cities, and the new sustainable supply chain will help both companies appeal to Chinese consumers’ rising interest in sustainability.

Product traceability will be key to demonstrating sustainability and maintaining consumers’ trust. These aspects are even more key in luxury, where the high product prices mean shoppers’ expect a premium end-to-end purchasing experience. SF Express has recently seen several cases of luxury goods being damaged or lost en route. One such case aroused widespread concern on social media when the compensation paid to the customer was much lower than the retail value of the lost product.

Doubling down on their cooperation and commitment to sustainability will go some way to amending any damage done to SF Express’ reputation – as well as ensuring LVMH stays well ahead of changing consumer preferences.

The US$6,750 watch features teal and orange accents, a 15-minute countdown clock for sailors to use as they await the start of a race, and a chronograph function for timing.

On July 12, Swiss watchmaker Tag Heuer held a grand opening party for its new flagship on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan. Celebrities including Patrick Dempsey, Kieran Culkin, Natasha Lyonne, Alexandra Daddario and Thomas Doherty turned up for the celebration, which was presided over by Frédéric Arnault, chief executive officer of Tag Heuer, with his father, LVMH CEO Bernard Arnault in the wings.

The day before the launch, we sat down with Frédéric Arnault, 28, to discuss his strategy for the brand. Arnault joined Tag Heuer in 2017, first in a strategy role, and was elevated to CEO in 2020. As we’re seeing with other brands under the LVMH umbrella, including Tiffany and Louis Vuitton, he’s moving many the product lines to more expensive price points while cutting out stores and product models that don’t match an elite vision.

So far, he says, the strategy has been a success in revenue; while LVMH doesn’t release numbers per brand, Arnault cites “double-digit growth” in the past few years, not through selling more watches, but selling more expensive ones.

How important is this store for the brand?

When I joined as CEO, we defined a new retail strategy. We wanted to invest a lot in our mono-brand stores. With mono brands, we can have the full brand experience and develop strong customer relationships. Being present on Fifth Avenue with great visibility was important as a brand statement. We had a flagship already, but it was not strong enough. So it was about elevating the overall experience. This store is more than double the size.

Globally, what have you done in that shift toward mono-brand stores?

We drastically reduced the number of point of sales from 4,000 to 2,300, but we more than doubled the total number of mono-brands. [Tag Heuer has 260 boutiques worldwide.] In many places we had a boutique, but it was not necessarily in the best location or with the best floor arrangements. So we significantly elevated the current network. And we are opening a boutique every week, basically. Either us directly or with partners.

Tell us how Tag has been doing since you took over.

Very well. One of the key objectives for us was brand elevation – growing through value and investing in our icons, especially the Carrera and the Monaco. The last launches we’ve released proved to be very successful: the new Carrera glass box has such an iconic and differentiated look and feel, and the new Monaco skeleton gives a very different flavour to this iconic piece.

We also pushed the boundaries in high-end watchmaking when we introduced the lab-grown diamonds with a totally new, innovative setting [in the Carrera Plasma line].

And also, we are re-entering the world of high horology with high complications; the first expression of that is the Monaco that will be auctioned in the Only Watch auction. For the first time ever, we are doing a split seconds chronograph wristwatch. And then we will re-enter the sports chronograph complication space in high watchmaking.

Has there been a reduction in product lines?

We have fewer individual models than in the past, but in terms of lines, that hasn’t changed. It’s more a strategy of elevation in the existing collections: the Formula One, the Aquaracer, the Carrera and the Monaco mainly.

My own first nice watch was a Tag. I still have it. It was given to me when I graduated from high school, and that’s the case for a lot of people. Is there a plan to move away from that entry-level luxury?

Frédéric Arnault, CEO of Tag Heuer, talks with Stephane Bianchi, CEO Watch and Jewellery of LVMH, during the Watches and Wonders fair in Geneva, Switzerland, on March 27. Photo: Reuters

Definitely not. We believe it’s an amazing strength for the brand. Everybody’s talking in the luxury industry about how to target Gen Z and be desirable to this customer base. And we have this strength already with our positioning. For most people, their first watch is offered as a gift. It’s not something they would buy for themselves. And this tradition of the first watch being Tag Heuer naturally helps us to stay top of mind for this young clientele. We want to then bring them into the brand and make sure that the second one that they would buy for themselves is a Tag Heuer.

Are you planning on raising prices further?

Every year we are raising prices, and we also are introducing products at higher prices than generally they were before. For example, this Monaco skeleton is about US$10,500 when previously, the models were more like US$6,000.

Would you do a certified pre-owned programme?

We are not looking to entering the certified pre-owned space . Maybe longer term. We’re focusing on first-hand watches, first-hand customers.

How many watches are you selling annually these days?

We don’t communicate on the volume, but what I can say is that we are not growing through volume. The volumes are staying what they are. It’s really the value of the pieces we’re selling that’s increasing significantly.

And how are sales in terms of dollars going?

Double-digit growth, healthy in the past few years.

What are the most popular models by direct revenue?

The No 1 line for us is the Carrera, both the chronograph and also the three-hand steel-strap watches. The ones with the day/date complication are really bestsellers. But Monaco is growing very strongly.

What’s the watch – other than the plastic Formula One watch – that everybody wants you to make?

This was one of them [referring to the Skipper on his wrist]. I think what people are waiting for is the re-entry in high complications. And we are doing some small choreograph complications here – the flyback. But collectors, they’ll talk about the Monaco V4 [a concept watch from 2004] and the Mikrograph. They ask when are we going to introduce such exceptional, unique, differentiated complications – and we are coming back on the segments with a very strong proposition.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999823570251465}",neutral,0.9999823570251465,0
LVMH earnings spark uncertainty around the entire luxury sector - XTB,"Wed, 26 Jul 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lnh0Yi5jb20vaW50L21hcmtldC1hbmFseXNpcy9uZXdzLWFuZC1yZXNlYXJjaC9sdm1oLWVhcm5pbmdzLXNwYXJrLXVuY2VydGFpbnR5LWFyb3VuZC10aGUtZW50aXJlLWx1eHVyeS1zZWN0b3LSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Yesterday after the end of the European session, global luxury goods leader Louis Vuitton Moët Hennessy (MC.FR) reported its Q2 results for this year, which brought down the company's shares by 4.3% during today's session and created a fair amount of uncertainty around other companies in the sector. Why did this happen?

The market was spooked by a decline in the company's revenue growth rate in the US market, overshadowing the very good results from China. What is imposing here is the context in which consumers are now reacting to the ongoing monetary tightening in the US, but also in the company's other markets.

The CB consumer confidence data presented yesterday surprised on the upside. The report for July was expected to show an improvement on the June data. Indeed it did - the headline consumer confidence index rose from 109.7 to 117.0! This is a significant increase - the market expected the main index to jump to 112.0. The improvement was mainly due to an increase in the expectations sub-index from 79.3 to 88.3. The current situation sub-index rose from 155.3 to 160.0.Source: XTB

On the other hand, however, the latest retail sales reading surprised on the downside. Of course, we continue to see an increase in sales, but at the same time it shows that consumer strength is somewhat lower. The monthly data came in at 0.2% m/m (expected: 0.5% m/m; previous: 0.3% m/m) and core sales: 0.2% m/m (expected: 0.3% m/m; previous: 0.1% m/m). Source: XTB

The US alone is not all, however, as for the broad luxury goods market the barometer of momentum for many years has proven to be the Asian market. Source: Bloomberg

Looking at regional data, data from the US and Asia (excluding Japan) came in below the average forecasts of analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. On the other hand, comparing the difference between the actual results and the average and comparing this with the standard deviation of the forecasts, it can see that the actual surprise of these readings was negligible. Considering the median, the difference turns out to be even smaller. Source: Bloomberg

Analysing the company's exact performance by sector, we can see that revenue growth has slowed, which has undermined sentiment around the company somewhat. Source: LVMH

Moreover, results from the most profitable part of LVMH's business, namely fashion and leather goods, failed to meet analysts' expectations. Source: LVMH

The luxury sector of the company's business is seeing sharp declines today against the results reported by the company. Kering (KER.FR) will report its results tomorrow. Source: xStation

Leading luxury goods group LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton posted revenue of €42.2 billion in the first half of 2023, up +15% in reported terms and +17% in organic terms year-on-year. Among the highlights was a return to profit in the half for DFS Group (co-owned by LVMH and DFS Co-Founder Robert Miller), as international travel rebounded.

All business groups achieved double-digit organic revenue growth over the half year, except for Wines & Spirits, which faced a particularly high basis of comparison. In the second quarter, organic revenue growth was +17%, in line with trends seen in the first quarter.

In Selective Retailing, organic revenue growth was +26% in the first half with profit from recurring operations doubling.

LVMH said: “DFS benefited from the gradual recovery in international travel and, in particular, from the return of tourists to the flagship destinations of Hong Kong and Macau. In France, the strong performance of La Samaritaine in Paris confirmed its appeal as a destination, within the context of an increasing number of Asian tourists.”

The company said that DFS revenues has progressed though it remains below 2019 levels. While travellers have returned to Hong Kong and Macau, recovery is “more gradual elsewhere”, said LVMH.

The Wines & Spirits business group recorded a slight revenue decline (-3% organic) in the half, when compared to a particularly strong first half in 2022. Profit from recurring operations was down -9%. The Champagne business recorded an increase in revenue over the half year, while Hennessy Cognac was impacted by the economic environment in the US and by the continued high stock level of its retailers.

The Perfumes & Cosmetics business group recorded organic revenue growth of +13% year-on-year in H1, with strong momentum achieved through innovation and a highly selective distribution policy. Profit from recurring operations was up +15%. LVMH cited in particular the performance of Christian Dior (across categories), the growth of Guerlain across skincare and fragrance, along with Benefit and Fenty Beauty.

The Fashion & Leather Goods business group recorded organic revenue growth of +20% in the first half. Profit from recurring operations was up +14%. Louis Vuitton had an excellent first half, said LVMH, which included the arrival of Pharrell Williams as Men’s Creative Director. Set on the stage of the Pont-Neuf bridge in Paris, his first fashion show was met with “huge enthusiasm” and more than 1.1 billion views on social media reaching an all-time high.

Christian Dior continued to post growth in all categories, Celine also grew and Loewe continued to strengthen its distribution network. Loro Piana, Rimowa, Marc Jacobs and Berluti enjoyed an excellent start to the year, said the group.

Watches & Jewelry achieved organic revenue growth of +13%, with profit from recurring operations up +10%. In jewellery, Tiffany, Bulgari, Chaumet and Fred experienced strong growth over the first half. The LVMH watchmaking Maisons TAG Heuer, Hublot and Zenith unveiled many new products during LVMH Watch Week and the Watches & Wonders trade show. Profit from recurring operations for the first half of 2023 was up +13% at €11,574 million. Operating margin reached 27.4% of revenue. Group share of net profit was up +30% at €8,481 million.

Chairman and CEO Bernard Arnault said: “LVMH achieved outstanding results during a six-month period of ongoing economic and geopolitical uncertainty. The strong creative momentum and excellent distribution of our Maisons continued to inspire dreams, as demonstrated by the enthusiastic reception given to Pharrell Williams’ first fashion show for Louis Vuitton as well as the reopening of the New York ‘Landmark’ of Tiffany & Co.

“We continued to see progress relating to our environmental, social and societal commitments, most notably in the recent announcement of an ambitious water sobriety plan intended to reduce our overall water consumption footprint by -30% by 2030.

With its parent company now a Premium Partner for the games, LVMH-owned retailer Sephora will be a partner for the Olympic Torch Relay, proposing activations for the public all along the relay route, as well as at LVMH Group locations along the itinerary and at stops.

Beyond beauty, the group’s jewellery brand Chaumet will design the Olympic and Paralympic medals, while the Moët Hennessy wines and spirits maisons will provide their products as part of the event’s hospitality programmes.

Fashion houses Louis Vuitton and Dior, and luxury men’s footwear brand Berluti will be involved in different, as yet unspecified, engagements between now and the opening ceremony, the company added.

LVMH will also sponsor athletes such as swimmer Léon Marchand, who at the age of 21 is a leading medal hope for the French Olympic team.

On 23 July, Marchand shattered Michael Phelps’ 400m individual medley record during the 2023 World Aquatics Championships.

Finally, the conglomerate will team up with French charity and longstanding partner Secours populaire français, to support a programme facilitating access to sports for 1,000 children and young people aged 4-25 who live in vulnerable situations.

Bernard Arnault, LVMH’s Chairman and CEO called the deal an “unprecedented partnership”, adding: “The values of passion, excellence and inclusion championed by high-level sports are cultivated each day by our teams.”

“With its exceptional know-how, the LVMH Group will bring its immensely creative talent to this project and enable us to benefit from its extensive experience,” added Tony Estanguet, President of the Paris 2024 Olympic Committee.

“This partnership also sends a powerful signal that France’s leading businesses are behind the Paris 2024 Games, which will let our country shine brightly around the entire world.”

LVMH’s Olympics announcement comes amid the 2023 FIFA Women’s World Cup in New Zealand, which boasts Unilever’s personal care brands as the official sponsors.

Unilever will also sponsor the men’s FIFA World Cup 2026 and the esports FIFAe Finals in a deal which will run until 2027.

Adding to the roster of luxury and beauty brand-owning giants backing sporting events in 2023 is Puig, which last month signed on to become a Global Partner of the 37th America’s Cup and be the Official Naming Partner of the inaugural Women’s America’s Cup.

The Spanish company said it hoped to promote “gender equality within the sport of sailing” by partnering with the regatta.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9784125685691833}",neutral,0.9784125685691833,0
LVMH wines and spirits tumble in H1 - Vino Joy News,"Wed, 26 Jul 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vdmluby1qb3kuY29tLzIwMjMvMDcvMjYvbHZtaC13aW5lcy1hbmQtc3Bpcml0cy10dW1ibGUtaW4taDEv0gFIaHR0cHM6Ly92aW5vLWpveS5jb20vMjAyMy8wNy8yNi9sdm1oLXdpbmVzLWFuZC1zcGlyaXRzLXR1bWJsZS1pbi1oMS9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LVMH's wines and spirits business tumbled in H1, affected by economic headwinds and elevated retailer inventory levels in both the US and China.

Luxury conglomerate LVMH experienced robust growth across its various business divisions in the first half of 2023, with the exception of its wines and spirits sector, which faced challenges from economic headwinds and elevated retailer inventory levels in both the US and China.

According to the company’s latest financial report released on Tuesday, revenue for the Wines and Spirits division declined by 4% to €3181 million compared to the same period last year, making it the only segment that exhibited a drop in performance.

Profit from recurring operations for Wines and Spirits during the first half of the year amounted to €1,046 million, representing a 9% decrease from the previous year. The revenue from Champagne and wines contributed €477 million, while cognacs and spirits accounted for €568 million.

Although Champagne and wines saw a promising 5% growth in published figures, primarily driven by European and Japanese markets, the overall performance was dragged down by the sluggishness of the cognacs and spirits segment. Revenue from the latter category decreased by 12% based on published figures and 11% on a constant consolidation scope and currency basis.

LVMH attributed this decline to the unfavorable economic conditions in the US and China, which experienced an adverse impact on the market due to high retailer inventory levels and challenging economic environments during the first half of the year.

The US luxury market saw a notable slowdown in consumer spending on expensive wines, handbags, and jewelry, indicating a cautious approach among luxury shoppers amidst uncertain economic conditions. China, a key growth driver for LVMH before the pandemic, is still in the process of recovering from the effects of the pandemic.

Given the overall macroeconomic uncertainty, LVMH remains cautious about the outlook for the rest of the year. The luxury group warns that the economic environment, particularly in the US, continues to be uncertain, despite sustained high growth levels throughout the pandemic. Consequently, the company approaches the second half of the year with determination and prudence to navigate the challenges ahead.

LVMH: Bernard Arnault has not yet chosen a successor | Luxus Magazine - Luxus Plus Mag,"Mon, 03 Jul 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vbWFnYXppbmUubHV4dXMtcGx1cy5jb20vZW4vbHZtaC1iZXJuYXJkLWFybmF1bHQtaGFzLW5vdC15ZXQtY2hvc2VuLWEtc3VjY2Vzc29yL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The five children of LVMH Chairman and CEO Bernard Arnault are increasingly in the spotlight as they rise through the ranks of the luxury empire. Today, all hold key management positions within the group’s Houses. But while a family succession is partly possible at the head of LVMH, “it’s still too early to decide”, said the CEO of the world’s number one luxury goods group.

In the Arnault family, becoming a captain of industry is a role one is trained for from an early age. Like Logan Roy’s character in the Succession series, the billionaire’s five children followed a demanding educational path, attending prestigious private schools such as Stanislas and Franklin. They then continued their studies in preparatory classes before entering business or engineering schools. The next step was to join the family group, starting with positions in retail and communications, before proving their worth by revitalizing some of the group’s Houses. In the Arnault family, schoolwork, music and sport are revered.

But Bernard Arnault, the 74-year-old CEO at the helm of the luxury conglomerate he began consolidating in 1987, has yet to decide who will succeed him. Yet nothing is left to chance. Especially since the sudden death of Jean-Luc Lagardère, Bernard Arnault’s “best friend”, who left the reins of his empire to an ill-prepared son.

A family business

For the time being, Bernard Arnault has no intention of hanging up. On April 21, 2022, he had LVMH shareholders vote at a general meeting to amend the company’s articles of association to allow him to remain CEO until the age of 80. However, one thing is certain: he wants the group to remain a family business.

“Depending on people’s skills, there may – but this is neither an obligation nor a necessity – be a succession to its management that is also family-owned, but it’s still too early to decide”, explained the CEO of LVMH, crowned the world’s number one fortune in early April by Forbes magazine in its annual ranking for 2023.

“The important thing is that this group retains its family spirit”, he added. “I control the group because I was at the origin of it, it was a start-up at the beginning”.

The age limit for the CEO of LVMH has already been raised from 75 to 80, allowing him to remain at the helm for longer. He can also remain chairman of the Christian Dior SE holding company, which controls the LVMH group, until that venerable age.

Qualified children

Today, all five Arnault children work for the LVMH Group, and the two eldest, Delphine and Antoine, from a first marriage, are also members of the LVMH Board of Directors.

The eldest, Delphine Arnault, 48, has been President and CEO of the Christian Dior Couture fashion brand since February 2023. Previously, she was executive vice-president of Louis Vuitton, responsible for products. She also held the position of Deputy General Manager of Christian Dior Couture and, in addition to the LVMH Board of Directors, is a member of the Group’s Executive Committee. Delphine is a graduate of EDHEC and the London School of Economics.

Antoine Arnault, 46, is Director of Communications, Image and Environment at LVMH, as well as Chairman and CEO of Christian Dior SE, LVMH’s holding company. Since 2012, he has been CEO of high-end clothing and footwear brand Berluti, and since 2013, Chairman of Loro Piana, the Italian cashmere specialist. Previously, he was Communications Director at Louis Vuitton. Antoine is a graduate of INSEAD, a French business school, and HEC Montréal, a Canadian business school.

Alexandre Arnault, 31, is Executive Vice-President in charge of products and communications at Tiffany. He was previously CEO of luggage manufacturer Rimowa, which he led for four years from 2016. Alexandre holds a master’s degree from France’s École Polytechnique.

Frédéric Arnault, 28, is currently CEO of Tag Heuer since 2020. Prior to that, he was head of strategy and digital for the watch brand, which he joined in 2017. Frédéric is a graduate of France’s École Polytechnique.

Jean Arnault, 24, has been director of marketing and development for the watch division at Louis Vuitton since August 2021. He holds a master’s degree in financial mathematics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and a master’s degree in mechanical engineering from Imperial College London.

According to information gathered by Raphaelle Bacqué and Vanessa Schneider in their book “Successions : L’argent, le sang et les larmes“, 75% of LVMH was transferred in bare ownership to the five children, as well as to their two cousins, sons of Bernard Arnault’s deceased sister Dominique. For his part, the current Chairman and CEO and patriarch retains 25% of the shares in the holding company and the usufruct of the whole.

Finally, in order to ensure that no spouse or spare part would undermine his empire, Bernard Arnault discreetly passed a resolution at the Annual General Meeting on April 13, 2017, amending article 9 of the Group’s bylaws. The text thus stipulates that “any transfer of shares, even between shareholders or to a spouse who may or may not be a shareholder, is subject to the prior approval of the general meeting. The transfer of shares in the event of inheritance or the liquidation of community property between spouses is also subject to approval.”

All the more reason to keep the family business going for a long time to come.

Last week The Kering Group made an acquisition bid towards Valentino, announcing that it bought a 30 percent stake in the Italian Maison for €1.7 billion in cash. The move is part of a broader strategic partnership with Qatari investment fund Mayhoola as Gucci — another house under the Kering umbrella — navigates its way during a transitional year towards growth. Gucci, which accounts for nearly half of Kering revenues, is in the midst of a managerial reshuffling having recently found a new creative director in Sabato De Sarno, replacing predecessor Alessandro Michele who had been at the helm of the Italian label since 2015.

Gucci’s New Creative Director Sabato De Sarno

ABC News reports that while Gucci sales “stagnate”, Kering achieved first-half revenues of €10.1 billion for the first half of the fiscal year of 2023, with two percent year-on-year increase both as reported and on a comparable basis. Part of the deal stipulates that Kering will have the option to buy 100 percent of Valentino by 2028. Valentino recorded revenues of €1.4 billion in 2022 perhaps partially due to the stability of Pierpaolo Piccoli’s role as creative director which he has helmed since 2008. News of the acquisition comes after Kering Beauté procured luxury fragrance house Creed from BlackRock Long Term Private Capital Europe in a strategic move that aims to push the company’s future growth in the beauty industry.

Sabato De Sarno will make his debut at Gucci with the women’s Spring 2024 collection at the upcoming Milan Fashion Week in September. In an official statement, François-Henri Pinault, Chairman and CEO of Kering commented: “I am impressed with the evolution of Valentino under Mayhoola ownership…I am very pleased of this first step in our collaboration with Mayhoola to develop Valentino and pursue the very strong strategic journey of brand elevation that Jacopo Venturini will continue to lead.”

While Kering prepares for a potential acquisition, LVMH gears up for a different kind of takeover altogether. LVMH’s Bernard Arnault plans to sponsor the 2024 Summer Olympics in a first-of-its-kind deal that comes with a US$166 million (or approx. €150 million) payout and will include Chaumet medals and Moet Hennessy wine. With Paris being the fashion capital of the world and the home of haute couture, the Summer 2024 games are expected to draw international eyeballs from both sport and sartorial appreciators, something which LVMH aims to leverage for growth in brand awareness and potential affinity by athlete association. It is a move which Arnault aptly says, “will contribute to heightening the appeal of France around the world.”

LVMH plans to go beyond one-dimensional product-placement-style marketing to a commitment to having a holistic part to play from the design of the games’ from medals — by storied Parisian jeweler Chaumet — to the production of wines and spirits by Moet Hennessy that will be served to guests. An official statement released by LVMH states that between now and the opening ceremony, Louis Vuitton, Dior, and Berluti will also present different aspects of their engagement. While the scale may be a first of its kind, LVMH has a history of sponsorships with global sporting events with Hublot previously being the official timekeeper of the 2023 FIFA Women’s World Cup (Hublot’s third time serving in this role after the 2015 and 2019 tournaments). With the streaming of national sports being a multi-billion industry, LVMH aims to position itself in the realm of pop culture.

The partnership is the latest in a longstanding relationship that LVMH has with sports, having previously provided support for high-level sporting showcases and prestigious international competitions including Louis Vuitton designing in-game outfits and a trophy-carrying case for the Riot Game’s League of Legends World Championship in 2020 and the release of Dior x Air Jordan 1 Sneakers during the NBA All-Star weekend in 2020. “From the creation of numerous trophies to the design of trunks made specially to hold them, LVMH Maisons have long been partners to the world of sports, spanning a wide variety of disciplines, from tennis, rugby and basketball to soccer and automobile racing”, an official statement from LVMH’s website reads.

With pieces on loan from institutions like the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Museum of Modern Art and the Whitney Museum of American Art, the temporary show will showcase Rothko’s career through 115 works.

The coming retrospective will include intimate paintings and urban landscapes from Rothko’s early career in the 1930s, opening with the artist’s only self-portrait, painted in 1936. Extending to Rothko’s 1969-1970 Cathedral, the show will also reflect on his foray into abstract expressionism in the 1940s and his well-known and warm-toned works from the 1950s.

Two major loans will star in the show, which will open this October and end in April of next year. The Rothko collection of the Phillips Collection, located in Washington, D.C., will send over its permanent “Rothko Room” to Fondation Louis Vuitton. Created in 1960 with help from the artist himself, the ensemble features works like Rothko’s red and yellow The Ochre (Ochre, Red on Red) from 1954.

A series of Rothko’s Seagram Murals will be loaned by the Tate. While the pieces were originally commissioned in 1958 for a Four Seasons restaurant in New York, Rothko decided to keep the works after he visited the restaurant himself and found the setting too luxurious. He later donated nine of the works to the Tate Gallery, which has since displayed them in its own “Rothko Room.” When the room is emptied, the Tate will reportedly be filling it with Joan Mitchell works loaned by Fondation Louis Vuitton.

In addition to works from numerous art institutions, the retrospective will include pieces loaned by Rothko’s family. The artist’s son Christopher Rothko collaborated on the show, according to head curator Suzanne Page, who in a statement described the “responsibility involved in staging a Rothko exhibition today, and of the difficulty of bringing together rare and extremely fragile works by such an essential artist.”

What else is in Fondation Louis Vuitton?

Arnault, the world’s second richest person with a net worth of $235.2 billion, has long shown an avid interest in the art world through his collaborations with artists like Takashi Murakami, Yayoi Kusama and Richard Prince. His own collection, which started with an auction purchase of a Claude Monet painting, contains pieces from high-profile artists like Damien Hirst, Pablo Picasso, Andy Warhol and Bernard Buffet. The LVMH head has even branched out into the digital realm with a growing collection of non-fungible tokens (NFTs).

He opened Fondation Louis Vuitton in 2014 as a private museum (housing his own collection and that of LVMH) and stages two temporary exhibitions of modern and contemporary artwork annually. Other pieces in the museum, which is currently showing an exhibition highlighting collaborations between Jean-Michel Basquiat and Andy Warhol, include works by Gerhard Richter, Ellsworth Kelly and Thomas Schutte. It also offers music recitals and performances in its auditorium and runs the Open Space program, in which artists are invited to create site-specific pieces.

The museum’s grand building was designed by Frank Gehry, whom Arnault approached with plans to collaborate on the institution in 2001. By 2006, Arnault had publicly revealed his plans for Fondation Louis Vuitton, located in Paris next to the Jardin d’Acclimatation in the Bois de Boulogne, which he has described as “a new space that opens up a dialogue with a wide public and offers artists and intellectuals a platform for debate and reflection.”

Even though Fondation Louis Vuitton is run as a separate entity from LVMH, its relationship to the luxury conglomerate that oversees brands like Louis Vuitton and Christian Dior has led to occasional backlash. Earlier this year, the Joan Mitchell Foundation sent a cease-and-desist letter to Louis Vuitton for allegedly reproducing three of the late artist’s works in an ad campaign without permission. The images were reportedly taken at Fondation Louis Vuitton, with an exhibition of paintings from Mitchell and Monet used as a backdrop. In a case that was later dismissed, a French anti-corruption group in 2018 accused LVMH of committing tax evasion through the museum, claiming it deducted 60 percent of the institution’s construction cost from its taxes. The creation of Fondation Louis Vuitton, which was originally supposed to cost about 100 million euros ($111 million), ended up costing nearly 800 million euros ($890 million).","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999971389770508}",neutral,0.9999971389770508,0

Bloomberg Published

Jul 26, 2023

For the first time, the Spanish leather goods company is the hottest brand in the world, according to rankings compiled by fashion platform .



The house’s logo could not be more appropriate to the luxury market right now. Just as fashionistas must decipher the quadruple letter Ls inside the intricate design, investors must figure out the patterns of spending in the two most important luxury markets: China and the US.





Bloomberg



Loewe’s parent gave us some clues on Tuesday. Unfortunately, they were not the ones investors had been looking for. Shares in LVMH fell as much as 4.5% in early trading on Wednesday, dragging down the whole sector.



LVMH reported organic sales growth of 17% in the three months to June 30, comfortably beating the Bloomberg consensus of analysts estimates of a 15.1% increase. The closely watched measure of fashion and leather goods organic sales rose 21% in the second quarter, also just ahead of expectations of a 20.8% gain.

But this is far from the massive outperformance that LVMH delivered in the first quarter, when both group organic and fashion and leather goods sales came in at almost twice the level anticipated.



First half operating profit, at €11.6 billion ($12.8 billion), slightly missed expectations, as the fashion and leather goods margin fell by 0.9 percentage points to 40.5% after being held back by a high level of investment in the group’s brands, including in ’ first catwalk show for menswear.



LVMH failing to deliver another blockbuster quarter should be a worry for the company controlled by — and the high-end sector as a whole.



LVMH is the world’s biggest luxury group. With a market capitalization of close to $500 billion, it has the resources to reinvest in its brands, led by Louis Vuitton and , as well as operate the most extravagant stores and recruit the best designers and celebrities to steer its houses.



For example, the company said on Monday that it would become a premium sponsor of the 2024 Summer in Paris. It is pouring €150 million into the Olympic and Paralympic games, the biggest sponsorship commitment of any company, Bloomberg News reported on Tuesday.



In short, it can shout louder than all other luxury brands, so that when a consumer decides to buy a handbag, they are more likely to choose or than a rival.



Yet for all of LVMH’s might, there there are some trends that it could not sidestep.



The first is a slowdown in the US. Chief Financial Officer Jean-Jacques Guiony said fashion and leather goods sales to US consumers were slightly negative in the second quarter. The weakness was concentrated on aspirational customers, with a reduction in demand for entry-level products, online sales and in second-tier cities. This also affected cognac revenues and to a lesser extent jewelry.



In contrast, sales to wealthier customers have held up. But -owner Cie Financiere SA, which operates in the high-end jewelry and watch market, last week pointed to deceleration in the US, raising the prospect of a slowdown among this cohort too.



Of course, some of the US weakness reflects a shift in the location of spending, as more Americans travel to Europe. Even so, given the fact that top-end groups, including LVMH, have opened US stores apace over the past couple of years, investors must be on watch.



For the industry to maintain momentum as the US cools, China must pick up the slack — or the bling baton as I like to call it. That is happening, but not at the pace that was expected in April, when LVMH delivered that blowout quarter.



LVMH said fashion and leather goods sales to Chinese consumers in the first half were 40% to 45% higher than two years ago, with Louis Vuitton ahead and Dior slightly behind. But the Chinese economy is slowing. It’s not clear whether the industry can maintain momentum.



And if the bling king is facing headwinds, then the picture is even more worrying for other groups, including -owner SA and SpA, both of which report later this week.



Against this backdrop, those in turnaround mode look the most challenged. This includes Gucci, which last week announced a management shakeup, and Group Plc, which is trying to elevate its products from premium to haute-luxury.



For all of Tuesday’s disappointment, LVMH should continue to outperform, given its scale, top-of-mind brands and product diversification, although it is more exposed to the US than many rivals.





Bloomberg



It should be joined in the winners camp by those companies catering to the truly wealthy, not the merely comfortable, such as International. SpA, whose “stealth wealth” styles are at the forefront of the quiet luxury movement, recently raised its full-year sales guidance for the second time this year.



But across the industry, valuations have escalated since April in anticipation of Chinese shoppers roaring back. Even with recent weakness, the MSCI World Textiles, Apparel and Luxury index is up about 18% from the start of the year through Tuesday’s close. LVMH had risen about 26% over the same period.



Given this run-up and the huge excitement that has built for China’s return, an in-line performance by the most muscular name won’t be enough to keep luxury stocks in fashion.
