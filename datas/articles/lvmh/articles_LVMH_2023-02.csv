LVMH Decides One Top Provençal Rosé Brand is Not Enough - Wine Spectator,"Fri, 24 Feb 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndpbmVzcGVjdGF0b3IuY29tL2FydGljbGVzL2x2bWgtZGVjaWRlcy1vbmUtdG9wLXByb3ZlbmNhbC1yb3NlLWJyYW5kLWlzLW5vdC1lbm91Z2jSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The world of prestige rosé is consolidating. Moët-Hennessy, the wine and spirits division of LVMH, has purchased a majority stake in the fast-growing Provence estate Château Minuty.

Fourth-generation owners Jean-Etienne and François Matton will remain at the helm of the winery their family founded in Saint-Tropez in 1936. Minuty is credited with helping establish the classic pale pink, aromatic style of Provençal rosé that has become the gold standard, and with fueling the explosive popularity of dry pink wine. Today, Minuty is the best-selling premium rosé in France (premium is classified at more than €15 per bottle).

In the Moët Hennessy portfolio of luxury wine labels, Minuty joins rosé winery Château d’Esclans, producer of Whispering Angel. The French conglomerate became the majority owner of that estate back in 2019, joining forces with founder Sacha Lichine, and the alliance has proven highly successful.

“Since we entered into the partnership with Sacha Lichine on Chateau d’Esclans, the business has literally doubled, and we have no doubt that the growth will continue and that we can expand this success to Minuty,” Philippe Schaus, chairman and CEO of Moët Hennessy, told Wine Spectator.

How does Minuty’s Matton family feel about being under the same umbrella as another leading prestige rosé? “We do not see ourselves as direct competitors because we serve different customer bases,” said François Matton. “Château d'Esclans is the leading Provence wine brand in the United States, while Minuty holds the leading position in Europe, the Caribbean, and Dubai.” The wine styles are also different, he explains, with Minuty especially focused on lightness and freshness.

American wine drinkers can expect to see more wines from Minuty, including whites and reds, reports Schaus, as well as an increased focus on the luxury wines from the estate, namely the Château Minuty 281 ($85) and Rosé et Or ($55), a price jump from Minuty’s Prestige ($30) and M ($27) bottlings.

Schaus believes the Côtes de Provence will increasingly become synonymous with the world’s most elite rosé and top producers will continue to see growth. “Provence is increasingly becoming to rosé wines what Champagne is to sparkling wines.” And by leveraging the charms of Provençal lifestyle and heritage, he added, “these wines have found their place not only in the apéritif consumption moment, but also in fine dining and high energy bars and clubs.”

The Champagne comparison is not lost on Matton, either. While Minuty has seen impressive growth, especially in the last five years, he believes the synergies between LVMH’s Champagne brands, including Krug, Veuve Clicquot and Ruinart, will build a wider audience for his rosés. “We share many of the same customers,” he said.

"LVMH is betting big on K-pop, from BTS’ Jimin to G-Dragon – but why? - Style","Thu, 02 Feb 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMioAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5zY21wLmNvbS9tYWdhemluZXMvc3R5bGUvbHV4dXJ5L2FydGljbGUvMzIwODcyNS9sdm1oLWJldHRpbmctYmlnLWstcG9wLXdoeS1hcm5hdWx0LWZhbWlseXMtbHV4dXJ5LWNvbmdsb21lcmF0ZS10YXBwZWQtc2xldy1zb3V0aC1rb3JlYW4taWRvbHMtYmVjb21l0gGgAWh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLnNjbXAuY29tL21hZ2F6aW5lcy9zdHlsZS9sdXh1cnkvYXJ0aWNsZS8zMjA4NzI1L2x2bWgtYmV0dGluZy1iaWctay1wb3Atd2h5LWFybmF1bHQtZmFtaWx5cy1sdXh1cnktY29uZ2xvbWVyYXRlLXRhcHBlZC1zbGV3LXNvdXRoLWtvcmVhbi1pZG9scy1iZWNvbWU?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The singer’s agency, Hybe, directed us to a statement from Dior on Twitter that said Jimin “embodies the spirit and singularity of Dior style”.

On January 11, Delphine Arnault was nominated by her father, luxury magnate Bernard Arnault, to helm Dior. Within days, the fashion house appointed Jimin, one of the seven members of the K-pop supergroup BTS , as the brand’s global ambassador.

Delphine’s move comes over a year after her younger brother Alexandre Arnault, an executive vice-president at Tiffany & Co., signed Blackpink singer Rosé to represent the jewellery house. Rosé now advertises Tiffany’s Hardwear line, a collection of necklaces and bracelets.

And in June, Celine – another brand under the massive umbrella of Arnault’s LVMH – invited BTS member V, Blackpink member Lisa , and South Korean actor Park Bo-gum to the brand’s spring/summer 2023 show in Paris. Lisa also worked with LVMH brand Bulgari, wearing one of its watches in a 2021 campaign.

All of which points at the undeniable – the world’s biggest luxury conglomerate is officially betting big on K-pop.

South Korean idols are no strangers to luxury brands

South Korean celebrities wearing luxury goods are a common sight. There are even Twitter accounts dedicated to documenting every branded item they wear. BTS has repped outfits from LVMH brands at star-studded events: all seven members turned up for the Grammys in Las Vegas in 2022 wearing head-to-toe Louis Vuitton, via Vogue.

It’s not only LVMH: In January, BTS rapper Suga became a brand ambassador for Valentino, per WWD.

And long before BTS, G-Dragon – the leader of BigBang, a K-pop band that dominated South Korea’s pop scene in the 2000s – was one of Chanel’s biggest representatives in Asia. The rapper forged a friendship with the late Karl Lagerfeld, per Hellokpop, and in 2015 attended Chanel’s haute couture show in Paris, according to The Straits Times.

A little aggressive, n’est-ce pas?

The Arnault family appears to be moving aggressively into the South Korean market.

The reason might lie in the math. Beyond the fact that K-pop stars come with legions of fans of their own, South Koreans are now the world’s biggest luxury consumers, CNBC reported, citing figures from Morgan Stanley. The estimated total value of South Korea’s spending on personal luxury goods in 2022 went up by 24 per cent year-on-year.

And the average South Korean person spent at least US$325 on luxury items in 2022 – far exceeding the US$55 per capita spending in China, and the US$280 per capita expenses in the US, according to Morgan Stanley’s report.

Soo Kim, a business professor at Singapore’s Nanyang Business School, said South Korea’s competitive environment and the seemingly insurmountable wealth gap are driving the luxury-spending machine in the country. South Koreans collectively ran up a staggering amount of debt in 2021 that exceeded the country’s GDP by five per cent, but they continue to spend big on luxury goods, reported BNN Bloomberg.

The spending won’t stop because branded items help compensate for “constant threats” to the average South Korean consumer’s “ego”, Kim added. Luxury items also provide a “psychological release” – giving South Korean consumers control over their physical appearance, she said.

“Furthermore, Koreans take great pride in their own citizens excelling in the global arena. Seeing their stars represent these luxury houses would positively impact Koreans’ perception of these brands,” Kim said.

A targeted move to win over the South Korean market

Experts say there’s another big reason LVMH is looking at South Korea: it’s the gateway to Asia.

“If you have South Korea, you have the northeastern Asian market,” Jacob Cooke, the chief executive officer of WPIC, a Beijing-based e-commerce consulting firm, told WWD in January.

There’s also South Korea’s cultural clout, David Dubois, a professor of marketing at Insead Business School, said.

“Fashion trends tend to be created and adopted in South Korea, before being diffused to other markets in Asia,” Dubois said. He added that LVMH’s K-pop promotions are a “continuation” of a long-term strategy to “establish long-lasting footprints” in the South Korean market.

Maybe later China?

And China, for various reasons, might also not be the prime market for LVMH’s products right now.

“With the Covid lockdowns and the recent sentiment against wealth inequality and the overt display of wealth in China, the relationship between luxury houses and the Chinese market is murkier,” Kim said.

Kim said it “makes sense” for LVMH to redistribute resources to places like Japan and Korea. She also said South Korea is “increasingly known” for its K-pop stars, films and shows in the US – which helps with promotions stateside too.

“I’m sure also it doesn’t hurt that Korea receives a great number of Chinese tourists. Once the Covid situation settles, it is possible that Chinese tourists, with their spending power, return to Korea,” Kim said. “The investment in Korea could also serve as an indirect way to target Chinese consumers.”

Representatives at LVMH did not immediately respond to request for comment.

The Daigou Dilemma: LVMH Pushes Back Against China's 'Personal Shoppers' - Jing Daily,"Tue, 21 Feb 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vamluZ2RhaWx5LmNvbS9wb3N0cy9kYWlnb3UtbHZtaC1jaGluYS1wZXJzb25hbC1zaG9wcGVyc9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"“I mean, for your image, there is nothing worse. It’s dreadful” said Bernard Arnault, LVMH’s chairman and CEO, during the company’s 2022 annual earnings call in January referring to the daigou trade in cosmetics.

Over the past three years, the South Korean duty-free market, which heavily relies on Chinese tourism, saw a high volume of sales despite China’s outbound travel restrictions due to COVID-19. Arnault explains “a number of our competitors in need of turnover accept that resellers source their products abroad to resell them at a discount in China. The products never arrived in the shop, but went directly from the store's reserves to the professional seller who resold them himself at a discount in China.”

Due to this, the world’s largest luxury group is determined to reject parallel channels (the cross-border sale of goods outside of where the manufacturer intended for them to be sold) like the Daigou sector in order to preserve its brand capital and allure. Yet, as LVMH’s chief financial officer Jean-Jacques Guiony admits — this has become a costly decision. “I would tend to say that whatever the cost, it's the right decision, and it's the one we have to take over time to preserve the attractiveness of our brands.”

According to the AI and data-driven agency Re-Hub’s report, the size of the Daigou market reached 57 billion (400 billion RMB) in 2020. Though tightening government regulations and the pandemic dealt a blow to its growth, this gray market could see some recovery now that borders have reopened.

Indeed, not everyone agrees with LVMH’s strategy. A2 Milk’s CEO David Bortolussi believes that “the Daigou channel, through one-to-one word of mouth recommendation, is a really powerful form of new user recruitment and communicating our brand messaging through the market more generally. So it’s a really important and effective channel we want to support.”

Let’s take a look at how brands can better navigate this often fraught and uneasy relationship with China’s Daigou.

Daigou mainly shop at duty-free stores to offer better prices to their consumers. “Many people want to use luxury skincare, but the counter retail prices are way too expensive. The offers we get abroad are much cheaper. And we don’t add much margin, so our price is much more competitive than that of the counters,” reveals a Wenzhou-based beauty Daigou (speaking on the condition of anonymity) who has been in the sector for over 10 years to Jing Daily.

""The offers we get abroad are much cheaper. And we don’t add much margin, so our price is much more competitive than that of over the counters.""

In the past, professional resellers used to travel to neighboring countries like South Korea and Japan to purchase tax-free luxury and beauty goods. Others — overseas students and expats — directly shipped products from Europe and the U.S. to China.

When the pandemic outbreak and travel restrictions were imposed, Daigou shifted their focus to the domestic tax-free island of Hainan. According to a report by Bain & Co ., the price of luxury beauty cosmetics in Hainan is 30-55 percent lower than the full retail price. Plus, travel retailers also provide additional promotional discounts of 20-35 percent for some brands. The impressive price gap resulted in a lucrative opportunity for these surrogate shoppers. Although borders have reopened, Hainan remains a top destination for Daigou.

Surrogate shoppers have allowed a broader audience to learn and access high-end skincare and cosmetics. Their core strength is the relationship and trust they have built with their consumers.

“At present, Daigou trade has become one of the common and daily channels for Chinese consumers to purchase beauty products. Even many brands regard this parallel channel as part of their sales strategy. The blow to it is bound to have a significant impact on revenue,” says Danni Liu, founding partner at the Chinese marketing agency iBlue Communications.

That said, Daigou also play a crucial role in raising brand awareness and educating consumers, especially useful for new entrants in China, where word of mouth is key to capitalizing on the market.

However, when it comes to luxury brands whose exclusive aura is built on crafted pricing strategies and limited stocking, Daigou’s presence means diluting that privilege for the few who can afford it. ​​

These professional resellers are often independent individuals circumnavigating the tax system to profit from the price differences. Brands have no control over them and cannot access their consumer data and insights. The potential price confusion they create can have fatal consequences for a brand’s image.

Moreover, the risk of having counterfeits in circulation due to dishonest Daigou could cause reputational damage. “Especially for ready-to-wear and jewelry brands, a tightened control on Daigou trade is essential to preserve the brand capital,” warns Liu.

The Daigou sector faces increasing setbacks as relevant government departments and brands crack down on the gray market. In Hainan, warning signs against reseller agents are everywhere, and more advanced technologies like trackable QR codes have been implemented to detect them. Since 2019, Daigou have been required by law to register as a business and pay taxes, but many choose to declare their imports as personal items to avoid these costs.

Yet, the question to businesses is whether the eradication of Daigou will route local consumers to purchase at the mainland’s counters. The veteran beauty Daigou from Wenzhou doubts it.

“The customer base is very different. Clients who pay attention to service and experience will still buy at the counter. They are generally wealthy ladies. The surplus is indifferent to them. Instead, our customers are mainly white collars and young mums. Even if there won’t be Daigou, they won’t buy from counters but other discounted channels, like livestreaming or group buying outlets,” she says.

In China, demand for Daigou remains high. In July 2020, the Hainan Free Trade Port implemented a series of policy bonuses: The annual tax-free shopping quota per person for Hainan tourists was raised from 4,400 (30,000 RMB) to 15,000 (100,000 RMB). Still, the quota is far from enough for Daigou who purchase in bulk. A Hainan reseller nicknamed Caicai shares that she usually spends 220-300 (1,500-2000 RMB) to buy additional quotas from travelers or locals.

Groups like Estée Lauder are making intensive internal adjustments on duty-free price control to directly take care of their retail travel division (many beauty labels’ duty-free stores are managed by a separate subsidiary). On January 21, Estée Lauder registered Estée Lauder Travel Retail Services (Hainan) Co., Ltd. in Haikou Comprehensive Free Trade Zone.

Meanwhile, brands like Helena Rubenstein are harmonizing their pricing strategy. This year, its duty-free discounts were reduced to a maximum of 20 percent.

“Whether it is to reject Daigou trade or push for price harmonization, brands are just working from a price latitude,” states Liu. “But to attract consumers to purchase at a full-retail price, they should invest in all-round services and user experiences that are irreplaceable by Daigou.” The Wenzhounese Daigou shares, “The counters offer gift boxes, samples, and special treatment. This is something we can’t give to our customers.”

According to the latest Bain report, the top 2 percent of wealthy consumers were responsible for 40 percent of luxury sales worldwide in 2022. Brands should double down on exclusive treatments for their customers to build long-term loyalty. But most importantly, they need to create an aspirational lifestyle for those still purchasing from Daigou, showing them that a real luxury experience can only be had at official stores."
More Than 2400 Designers Applied for This Year's LVMH Prize - WWD,"Thu, 16 Feb 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3dkLmNvbS9mYXNoaW9uLW5ld3MvZGVzaWduZXItbHV4dXJ5L2x2bWgtcHJpemUtc2VtaWZpbmFsaXN0cy0yMDIzLWZhc2hpb24tMTIzNTUyODcxMC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"More budding designers have their eye on the prize than ever.

Marking its 10th anniversary with the 2023 edition, the LVMH Prize for Young Fashion Designers has selected 22 semifinalists from a record number of applicants — more than 2,400.

“It is a source of great pride for all of us to see that the prize is now an essential vehicle for identifying and highlighting creative talent all over the world,” said Delphine Arnault, the force behind the prize initiative and a key talent scout at family-controlled luxury conglomerate LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton.

She noted that the outpouring of interest “confirms the international resonance of the prize.”

Indeed, the semifinalists hail from all over the world: Canada, China, South Korea, Estonia, the U.S., France, India , Italy, Japan, Nigeria, the U.K., Taiwan, Sweden and, for the first time, Brazil and Jamaica.

“We are also very happy to welcome a Ukrainian candidate, Julie Pelipas, with her upcycling brand Bettter, among the 22 semifinalists,” added Arnault, who started earlier this month as chairman and chief executive officer of Christian Dior Couture.

The annual design prize has helped propel the careers of such talents as Marine Serre, Nensi Dojaka, Thebe Magugu, Simon Porte Jacquemus and Grace Wales Bonner.

The main victor receives a 300,000-euro endowment and mentorship by LVMH teams in such areas as sustainability, communications, marketing, legal, production and finance. The winner of the Karl Lagerfeld Prize receives a 150,000-euro allocation plus one year of mentorship from LVMH experts.

To qualify, designers must be between the ages of 18 and 40 and have at least two commercialized womenswear, menswear or genderless collections under their belt.

The semifinalists are to gather at a showroom in Paris on March 2 and 3 during fashion week to present their collections to the press and to the prize’s committee of experts, who will vote to select eight finalists.

“In our profession, nothing replaces being able to meet the candidates in person and to be as close as possible to see, touch and understand their creations,” Arnault remarked. “These meetings and exchanges with the semifinalists and the experts are always moments of great enrichment. We are very happy to gather for this latest edition of the prize to celebrate creativity.”

New experts on the committee include casting director Piergiorgio Del Moro, Vogue editors Tiffany Godoy and Gabriella Karefa-Johnson, stylists Harry Lambert and Law Roach, and Lina Kutsovskaya, founder and creative director of Be Good Studios.

The general public is also invited to discover the designers and vote for their favorite collection on the Lvmhprize.com website.

After a 2022 edition dominated by menswear, no fewer than nine of the 2023 semifinalists create genderless designs.

“For 10 years, the prize has mirrored developments in society, and therefore in our industry. We have seen the emergence of craftsmanship, streetwear, upcycling… and also genderless, a trend that is confirmed,” Arnault told WWD. “It’s true that in the first years, most of the candidates presented womenswear collections. This has changed a lot: Candidate submissions are now split between proposals for womenswear, menwear and genderless collections. Some candidates even present two or three collections. This demonstrates that fashion is in perpetual evolution, and that creativity is alive.

“The prize helps all of us in the luxury industry to think about and reflect on these issues, so relevant for younger generations,” she added.

Arnault also highlighted that eco responsibility is a major priority for semifinalists, many of whom use recycled materials and favor local and ethical production methods.

Many also exalt the culture and craftsmanship of their native lands, and embed values of inclusivity and diversity in their designs and communications. The executive also touted the impressive “creative maturity” of the 22 young semifinalists.

The 2023 LVMH Prize also distinguishes three fashion school graduates. Each will receive 10,000 euros and join the design studio of a house within LVMH, whose fashion brands include Louis Vuitton, Dior, Celine, Givenchy, Fendi, Loewe, Marc Jacobs and Emilio Pucci. Online applications for the student prizes remain open until March 19.

A jury made up of LVMH’s famous creative directors will ultimately select the victors ahead of a prize ceremony later this year.

LVMH is Reportedly Considering Taking Over Richemont - HYPEBEAST,"Sun, 26 Feb 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vaHlwZWJlYXN0LmNvbS8yMDIzLzIvbHZtaC1yZXBvcnRyZWRseS1pbnRlcmVzdGVkLWluLXJpY2hlbW9udC10YWtlb3Zlci1uZXdzLWluZm_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LVMH, the world’s leading luxury group led by the world’s richest man Bernard Arnault, is reportedly considering a takeover of Switzerland-based luxury goods holding company Richemont. The news was first reported by Swiss newspaper Finanz und Wirtschaft, which spoke of whispers behind closed doors.

Arnault reportedly has his target on Cartier, seeing the Richemont jewelry and watch brand as a key to LVMH’s growing jewelry segment which currently includes brands such as Tiffany & Co., Bvlgari, and Chaumet.

Richemont is currently the fourth-largest luxury company in the world by market cap with an expansive portfolio of 26 maisons and businesses including Cartier, Chloé, Montblanc, IWC, A. Lange & Söhne, Van Cleef & Arpels, Jaeger-LeCoultre, Panerai, Piaget and Vacheron Constantin as well as retail platforms under YOOX Net-a-Porter Group.

South African businessman Johann Rupert founded Richemont in 1988, and since then, his family has held a controlling stake in the company. So far, Rupert has been resistant to giving away control of the company, refusing to change the family-controlled boardroom structure last year.

“Our board may be slower and more conservative than others. But its openness and collegiality are exactly its advantage. I will not be blackmailed,” he said in a rare interview.

Stay tuned for more details to emerge in the coming months.

Is LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton Stock a Buy? - The Motley Fool,"Thu, 02 Feb 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIzLzAyLzAyL2lzLWx2bWgtbW9ldC1oZW5uZXNzeS1sb3Vpcy12dWl0dG9uLXN0b2NrLWEtYnV5L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The luxury brand is proving it can weather any storm.

Someone once said, ""I've been poor and I've been rich. Rich is better!"" It's not so much that the rich are immune from the effects of inflation, higher energy costs, and rising interest rates, but rather they just tend to be the last to feel the impact.

Which may be why LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton (LVMUY -1.91%) could be a great stock to buy now. The world's largest luxury brand is riding through this economic rough patch in fine style as the affluent continue to spend through the global malaise.

This is a company with a well-diversified portfolio of brands. There are some 75 ""houses"" holding 60 different brands across wines and spirits, fashion and leather goods, perfumes and cosmetics, watches and jewelry, and what it calls selective retailing. And LVMH is only getting stronger and taking market share from its rivals, while its stock is running well ahead of the S&P 500.

A quality earnings report

The fourth quarter was one of remarkable performance for the luxury-goods maker. Every single segment of its operations saw robust organic growth allowing full-year revenue to reach 79.2 billion euros (about $86.2 billion) and profit from recurring operations to hit 21.1 billion euros, both up 23% from the year ago period.

While LVMH's segment revenue doesn't often rise by double-digit rates, they all managed to do so in the fourth quarter, and some performed significantly better than others. In particular, the fashion and leather division experienced 20% revenue growth, with organic growth representing half of that, on the strength of both Dior and Louis Vuitton, with the latter surpassing 20 billion euros in revenue for the first time ever.

Yet brands Fendi, Loro Piana, Loewe, and Marc Jacobs also reached record levels of revenue and earnings.

The significant growth Louis Vuitton is achieving is causing LVMH to open more manufacturing sites every year for the brand in France, where it already has 110 manufacturing facilities and workshops.

The rich continue to spend

LVMH has been a star performer over the past five years, growing from 46.8 billion euros (about $51 billion) in 2018 to this past year's record performance, even while being forced to recover from the brutal slowdown in 2020 brought on by the coronavirus pandemic.

Management has just as rosy an outlook for 2023. The company said in a statement that it is ""confident in its ability to continue the growth observed in 2022,"" with Chairman and CEO Bernard Arnault telling analysts that after seeing the results so far for January, ""if it continues as it is, it'll be an excellent year.""

There's good reason to be hopeful. The Financial Times notes that although aspirational luxury consumers are reducing spending in the U.S., the uber-wealthy, or the top 2% of global consumers who account for 40% of all luxury spending, continue to open their fine-grain leather wallets even as luxury goods manufacturers raise prices.

Even as prices have risen 20% or more over the past few years on Chanel and Louis Vuitton products, Citi analyst Thomas Chauvet believes they could jump another 15% this year because the falling value of the euro makes luxury goods cheaper.

Other analysts are a little more cautious, though, seeing growth again in 2023, but at a slower rate of just 6% to 8%. Even so, between now and 2030, luxury goods sales are forecast to surge 60% higher as well-heeled consumers in India, Mexico, South Korea, and Southeast Asia increase in number.

China is a huge catalyst for luxury

Even so, the luxury market today is not the same as it was back during the financial-markets crisis of 2009. The consumer base has grown to 400 million people, while the luxury brands themselves have fine-tuned their access to their ultra-wealthy clientele, making the companies much more resilient in a downturn than they once were.

As head of the world's biggest luxury house, Arnault also sees China's reopening as a portent of even better growth to come. He says that even if the casinos of Macao aren't humming with gamblers, LVMH's stores in the city are open and people are buying.

Now, sales haven't returned to their pre-pandemic levels -- CFO Jean-Jacques Guiony estimates they are still down about 40% -- but the start to the new year is encouraging, and LVMH is looking to the back half of 2023 for when growth will pick up the pace.

Indeed, analysts expect Chinese consumers to represent 40% of the global luxury market by 2030, with Bain & Co. believing that China will be ""a fundamental growth driver in the long term.""

A luxury stock without a luxurious price

LVMH seems to have worked out whatever hiccups it's encountered over the past year, and with its target demographic still spending and China's economy reopening, the luxury-goods retailer looks well positioned to capitalize on greater spending on its goods.

The stock also looks reasonably valued at 21 times estimated earnings, and with a decent forward dividend yield of 1.6%, LVMH looks to be a solid stock to buy."
The industry reacts to Pharrell Williams' Louis Vuitton appointment - Glossy,"Fri, 17 Feb 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmdsb3NzeS5jby9mYXNoaW9uL3RoZS1pbmR1c3RyeS1yZWFjdHMtdG8tcGhhcnJlbGwtd2lsbGlhbXMtbG91aXMtdnVpdHRvbi1hcHBvaW50bWVudC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"It took over a year after the untimely death of Virgil Abloh for Louis Vuitton to announce who would be taking over his role as men’s creative director. But the reactions to the announcement on Tuesday that famed musician Pharrell Williams was the pick were instantaneous.

Across the industry, reactions fell predominately into two camps: those who lamented that LVMH’s decision seemed to outweigh celebrity over design acumen, and those who said Williams’ curatorial and collaborative approach is perfectly in-line with what Abloh was doing before his death.

Joey Keefer, a menswear designer and consultant, acknowledged Pharrell’s creativity and talent. But he told Glossy he worries about the precedent of hiring celebrities to major fashion roles.

“Appointing people who are immensely talented, like a Pharrell, into appointments where they’re not necessarily an expert, per se, is challenging to stomach,” Keefer said. “How many other industries operate like this? It’s like appointing Hedi Silmane as the head of A&R at Universal Music Group.”

Keefer’s feelings were echoed by others in the industry, including the Financial Times’ Jo Ellison. In an op-ed, Ellison wrote that aspiring designers may be better off hiring a social media manager rather than getting a degree from a design school like Parsons or Central Saint Martins.

My only gripe with the Pharrell LV appointment is him not being a designer – a lot of CD aren’t – is him being a celebrity.

This shouldn’t be enough for the role. — Chloé 7yay (@mansourbadjoko) February 16, 2023

Shelton Boyd-Griffith, a fashion editor at Essence, echoed the sentiment.

“I’d much rather take a young design grad or in-house designer,” Boyd-Griffith said on Twitter. “All these young talented designers itching for their big chance and you hire a multi millionaire celebrity?”

But there are just as many people who defend Louis Vuitton’s choice. Williams does have years of fashion experience, having founded two successful streetwear brands — Billionaire Boys Club and Ice Cream — and designed or collaborated with several major brands, including Adidas, Uniqlo and, appropriately, Louis Vuitton.

Crazy how when a creative visionary like Pharrell Williams is appointed at a key luxury house everybody is suddenly a creative direction & design traditionalist. The mold is no longer there, there’s room for self expression and fashion is a business with KPIs, get on it. — osa (@osamachabbi) February 15, 2023

Williams is also especially suited to follow Abloh’s specific vision for Louis Vuitton. Pharrell is known mostly as a collaborator and curator of fashion, rather than a designer himself, but those terms describe Abloh’s tenure, as well. When he died, Abloh’s fans noted his eclectic taste and ability to cast a wide net, bringing in diverse collaborators and helping to expose Louis Vuitton to new audiences. Commentators noted that Williams fits with this vision of the brand.

“Pharrell brings with him the kind of clout and buzz only a celebrity can. Nobody can fill Virgil’s shoes but Pharrell Williams comes pretty close when it comes to retaining the same energy Vuitton men’s had under Virgil,” said fashion writer Louis Pisano. “He’s a multidisciplinary creative straddling the worlds of music, fashion, art, and design with an approach and aesthetic similar to Virgil’s. In my opinion it’ll be a seamless transition in which the new menswear clientele that Virgil attracted won’t be found wanting.”

Louis Vuitton is one of the biggest fashion brands in the world — its revenue surpassed $20 billion last year for the first time — and the majority of its revenue comes from leather goods, not its ready-to-wear collections.

And it’s clear that parent company LVMH wanted someone who can act as an ambassador for the brand and tastemaker in the industry, in addition to overseeing new collections.

“I empathize with industry people who think that this will set the wrong precedent going forward that celebrities are fit to be creative directors of traditional fashion houses,” said Clayton Chambers, creator of the fashion newsletter Sprezza. “But Louis Vuitton sees this as a curatorial, dot-connecting role, not a strictly technical, in-the-weeds design role. If what they want is to be at the center of music, art, fashion and entertainment, Pharrell can help bridge that gap.”"

Tony Parker Kicks Off LVMH Recruitment Tour in Paris - WWD,"Wed, 15 Feb 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3dkLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy1uZXdzL2h1bWFuLXJlc291cmNlcy9sdm1oLWtpY2tzLW9mZi1yZWNydWl0bWVudC10b3VyLXRvbnktcGFya2VyLXBhcmlzLTEyMzU1MjkxODkv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS — LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton kicked off its five-city “You and Me” recruitment roadshow to attract young people into the luxury professions, with an opening exposition at Paris’ Palais Brongniart.

For good measure, there was a “rock star” of sorts, with Tony Parker on hand to sign autographs and take selfies with young fans. The basketball star spoke from the main stage and emphasized that the métiers d’art are “not reserved for the elite.”

Parker’s Lyon-based Adequat Academy has long partnered with LVMH to offer alternate career paths to student athletes who excel in their sport but might not make it to the big leagues. Parker frames it as helping kids “create another passion” and have additional opportunities.

“A lot of kids have no idea they can work with Dior, think it’s too high or you have to have a great degree. Knowing that and seeing the kids with stars in their eyes, like, ‘Wow, can I really work at a place like that?’ So that’s our job, to expose them to possibilities and knowledge,” he told WWD.

Students excitedly buzzed around, watching demonstrations from artisans and couturiers representing brands including Celine, Dior, and Louis Vuitton.

The morning recruitment session was focused on students from 13 to 18 years old, and welcomed more than 2,100 people throughout the day-long event.

“It’s a difficult age when you have to face difficult questions about what you want to do in life,” said Chantal Gaemperle, LVMH Group executive vice president of human resources and synergies. “So we believe in bringing concrete solutions, and bringing in people that those young people can relate to, identify with, that can open up their minds and give them a perspective they didn’t have before.”

Inside the fair the company gamified the floor plan to better appeal to the young crowd. QR codes led guests through the different displays, while a quiz could be completed at the end for a spot on the scoreboard. They also used VR headsets in an interactive display to walk potential recruits through a factory floor.

Gaemperle said the biggest challenges of recruitment are that many young people who are growing up with screens haven’t heard of handicrafts and don’t have an understanding of what an artisan is. Another challenge is that students often come in saying they want to be a fashion designer, but don’t understand all the behind-the-scenes work that goes into creating couture or a bag. The program aims to expand their understanding of luxury brands, what Gaemperle calls “awakening vocation.” Students leave with new ideas of what might be possible for them, she added.

More than just a display of luxury brands, there were booths from the French government employment department and a particularly popular section for seminars on how to prepare job applications, as well as one-on-one coaching from counselors on how to prepare a résumé.

This year the company also developed an app so that interested parties can fill out questionnaires, do online tests and help them establish their job profiles.

Gaemperle emphasized that the company recruits from all ages, including older workers looking to retrain in long-term handicraft careers.

“We are looking at a diverse, broad base because what we need is skilled people,” she said. “Basically the success of our group, we often say, is built on the talents first of all and the craftsmanship that we have.”

As luxury continues its unabated growth, LVMH and other houses have plenty of positions to fill. The program has more than doubled its capacity from 1,200 last year to 3,500 positions to recruit in France, particularly in serving those high-end clients. More than 2,000 client-experience slots need to be filled, more than 460 artisans are needed as well as 85 in creative positions. Nine hundred internships are available, including 190 artisans and 150 in creatives.

Filling those client-facing positions is of utmost importance right now, added Gaemperle. These jobs are typically undervalued, she said, and they are working to give a greater focus on these positions, particularly as retail must add customer service in a competitive, omnichannel world.

“In this context, the client-facing jobs become only more and more important,” she said, noting that pandemic changes created a “disaffection” for careers in retail. However, human interaction and brand story are the core of the company.

“If you are a client you want to find the right reason to physically go to a store, you want to live an exceptional experience. We have developed luxury retail [as] the art of welcoming clients and the art of being able to tell a story, to understand the products, origins, how it has been made. So we put a lot of emphasis on these careers.”

For his part, Parker encourages kids to dream big. “If you tell your dream to somebody and they’re not laughing at you, you aren’t dreaming big enough,” he joked. Parker relayed the story of a student who recently said he hopes to be the chief executive officer of Dior one day. “Everyone in the room — like 800 people — was laughing but I was like, great. I hope I can inspire a whole generation of kids who want to be in those positions and dream big.”

The appointment of music artist Pharrell Williams as the new creative director of Louis Vuitton’s men’s division is a great example of dreaming big, Parker said. “It just shows how creative this house is and they’re not afraid to take a risk. You never know what will happen,” he said. “It’s not going to be easy to go after Virgil Abloh, so it’s a pretty big deal.”

Parker is set to open a second academy outside of Paris in 2025. The new school will repurpose facilities built for the 2024 Olympic Games, a situation that will be a win-win for the region as well as the academy. He will be partnering with LVMH again on the project, which will have a complementary curriculum to his school in Lyon. Parker added that he is carefully considering expanding his educational facilities.

“We have propositions in Africa and in China, who want to use our concept and everything that we have created with this academy. We have offers on the table,” he said. “But for me it is about choosing the right partners that can grow and make it last for a lot of years.”

The “You and Me” tour will hit Reims on March 3; Orleans March 7; Clichy-Sous-Bois March 15, and finish in Lyon on March 29.

While not strictly part of the “You and Me” program, LVMH has started similar recruitment in other regions. Gaemperle noted that in the U.S., they integrated the first apprentice classes for Tiffany & Co., which tripled registration in one year. That initiative, as well as others in six countries, are being implemented to support the overall global need to fill 15,200 positions in 2023."
"LVMH Sales Are Slowing Down, But Chairman Bernard Arnault Remains ""Quite Confident"" - HYPEBEAST","Wed, 01 Feb 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vaHlwZWJlYXN0LmNvbS8yMDIzLzIvbHZtaC1ncm91cC1mb3VydGgtcXVhcnRlci1yZXZlbnVlLXJlcG9ydC1zbG93ZWQtZ3Jvd3RoLXJhdGXSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LVMH Group, which owns brands including Louis Vuitton, Dior and Tiffany & Co., reported that its fourth-quarter revenue grew by 9%, marking the first time that the luxury conglomerate’s quarterly growth rate has slowed to single digits since 2020, according to Business of Fashion.

The figure represents a slowdown from a 20% growth rate in the first nine months of 2022, though it still exceeds financial analysts’ estimates of 7% growth. Across the entire year, LVMH Group’s revenue rose 23% to €79.2 billion EUR.

Impacted by regional lockdowns and quarantines in China, LVMH’s organic revenue in Asia fell by 8% in the fourth quarter, and it was flat when compared year-to-year. According to LMVH’s chief financial officer, Jean-Jacques Guiony, foot traffic in China was 85% lower than 2019 levels in December and even 40% below foot traffic in January of last year.

Despite the lowering growth figures, LVMH chairman Bernard Arnault said that he was “quite confident” about 2023. “There’s been an extremely strong start to 2023…If the opening of China is confirmed, if it continues like this it should be a very good year,” Arnault said during LVMH’s first in-person conference in three years. “We will be able to grow, and keep growing our investments.”

In the United States, revenue growth slowed to 7% in the fourth quarter, which Guiony said was due in part to the strength of the U.S. dollar in comparison to the euro, prompting customers to purchase luxury items abroad. In Europe, sales were up 22%, and in Japan, sales rose 29%.

“I’m not at all convinced there is a significant slowdown in U.S. demand. When you look at Sephora in the United States, the fourth quarter was the best of the year, and Sephora is quite a good barometer of what is happening in luxury,” said Guiony via WWD.

While LVMH typically does not share the individual earnings for each brand, Arnault did disclose that Louis Vuitton reported annual sales of €20 billion EUR last year, confirming analysts’ estimates the flagship label would be the first luxury brand to reach that figure. Meanwhile, Celine’s sales have doubled to more than €2 billion EUR since Hedi Slimane became creative director five years ago.

Elsewhere, a Supreme x UNDERCOVER collaboration is expected to arrive soon."
"Weekend Briefing: Tiffany's new direction has drawn criticism, but LVMH is happy - Glossy","Sat, 04 Feb 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmdsb3NzeS5jby9mYXNoaW9uL3dlZWtlbmQtYnJpZWZpbmctdGlmZmFueXMtbmV3LWRpcmVjdGlvbi1oYXMtZHJhd24tY3JpdGljaXNtLWJ1dC1sdm1oLWlzLWhhcHB5L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Tiffany & Co. has been a major success for its new parent company, LVMH. But last week, some of its moves drew criticism. Elsewhere, layoffs continued to hit major fashion retailers, and the Swedish-American brand Blk Dnm announced it’s rebranding as luxury — which may be a dangerous path to tread.

As mentioned in the latest Glossy Week in Review podcast, Tiffany’s executive creative director, Ruba Abu-Nimah, is departing the company, about a year and a half after joining. She was responsible for Tiffany’s advertising and branding, and helped shift the company’s public persona from a proper legacy institution to one more in touch with modern trends.

But the direction Tiffany has taken since its acquisition by LVMH in 2021 has been polarizing. Under Alexandre Arnault, the brand has been criticized by some for trying too hard to appeal to sneakerheads and youth culture, rather than sticking to its heritage. The “Not your grandmother’s Tiffany” messaging has been seen as inauthentic, and other campaigns like one featuring the works of artist Jean-Michel Basquiat were also criticized. But the numbers back up LVMH’s direction for the company: It’s doubled its value since the acquisition and has become a crown jewel for LVMH.

More layoffs at online retailers

Layoffs have continued throughout the fashion industry over the last couple weeks: Secondhand watch marketplace Chrono24 laid off 65 employees and Saks.com laid off 100, while Canadian online luxury retailer Ssense also suffered layoffs. Ssense eliminated 138 roles, or about 7% of the company. In a statement, the company said the move was due to a shift back to pre-pandemic e-commerce shopping levels among consumers.

The decline in e-commerce revenue, particularly compared to the bombastic growth the channel experienced throughout 2021, is a current pain point for many online retailers. Even Farfetch reported its first quarter of declining sales at the end of 2022, after years of massive growth. You can even see the effects of online shopping degrowth on Instagram, where the platform has removed the dedicated Shop tab due to low engagement.

This has led a number of brands to start looking more seriously into brick-and-mortar expansion. Brands including Alexander Wang, Rails and Cult Gaia are all opening new stores.

Blk Dnm is going luxury, but is it a smart move?

The Swedish-American brand Blk Dnm, which was previously a mid-market brand, is rebranding with a new logo, new products and new prices, with the aim of becoming an “entry-luxury brand.” The news was first reported by Women’s Wear Daily.

Its first full collection as a luxury brand will debut at New York Fashion Week. Previously, its prices were in the low-hundreds range for denim and leather goods. But the new collection’s styles will sell for as much as $3,000. Blk Dnm also plans to open a New York flagship store next year.

It’s an interesting move to rebrand upward in price and prestige, especially at a time when the average consumer has less purchasing power than ever. On the one hand, luxury brands like those in the LVMH portfolio have been best able to withstand the pressures of inflation, due to their wealthy, mostly unaffected core customer base. On the other hand, J.Crew made a similar bet during the last big recession in 2008. The higher prices and courting of luxury consumers didn’t pay off, and the company lost much of the prestige it had built up in the years prior."
Pharrell Is One of Hip-Hop's Most Talented Creatives. But Did LVMH Miss the Point? - Complex,"Fri, 17 Feb 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNvbXBsZXguY29tL3N0eWxlL2EvbGVpLXRha2FuYXNoaS9sb3Vpcy12dWl0dG9uLXBoYXJyZWxsLXdpbGxpYW1zLW9waW5pb27SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Without question, hip-hop stars have played an integral role in positioning Louis Vuitton as one of the world’s most recognized fashion labels today. Dapper Dan’s bootleg couture linked luxury house monograms to hip-hop greats like Rakim and LL Cool J a decade before Louis Vuitton hired Marc Jacobs to design its men’s and women’s collections in 1997. And during Jacobs’ own 16-year tenure at Louis Vuitton, he put together popular collaborations not just with artists like Takashi Murakami, but also with contemporary hip-hop superstars like Skateboard P himself. While Kim Jones’ menswear collections steered away from such star-studded team-ups, he built on Jacobs’ collaborative approach by embedding streetwear into the luxury space by merging Louis Vuitton with brands like Supreme—a label whose own designs are deeply indebted to hip-hop fashion and urban culture at large. After flirting with hip-hop for so long, Abloh officially engaged LV with the culture during his eight season arc as the creative director of menswear at Louis Vuitton. Pharrell’s appointment joins these two worlds in holy matrimony, with Louis Vuitton’s new CEO, Pietro Beccari, officiating his first marriage as pastor.

But one wonders if this was the fairy tale ending Abloh envisioned for the house. Although Abloh was a celeb-adjacent fashion designer, his collections were not crutched by his A-list status. While the pull he had with celebs created headlines for Louis Vuitton, that was not his end all be all as a designer. Yes, he normalized positioning celebrity friends like Kid Cudi or ASAP Nast as runway models. But he plotted these stars with nuance and made larger points on celebrating diversity within fashion through this approach. Yasiin Bey (Mos Def) performed during the LV Men’s Fall 2021 presentation, which was inspired by James Baldwin and connected a thread of Black poets that included Saul Williams and Kai-Isaiah Jamal; Abloh’s Spring 2022 collection, partly inspired by old kung fu movies, included an apt “Liquid Swords” performance by GZA of the Wu-Tang Clan. Abloh was less about social media buzz and more about tactfully spotlighting his adolescent hip-hop heroes to bring attention to larger narratives about Black art that have long been marginalized by the traditional fashion industry."
LVMH Shelled Out $47 Million to Keep a Caillebotte Masterpiece in France. So Why Are People Complaining? - artnet News,"Tue, 07 Feb 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vbmV3cy5hcnRuZXQuY29tL21hcmtldC9sdm1oLWNhaWxsZWJvdHRlLW11c2VlLWRvcnNheS0yMjUyNDM00gFNaHR0cHM6Ly9uZXdzLmFydG5ldC5jb20vbWFya2V0L2x2bWgtY2FpbGxlYm90dGUtbXVzZWUtZG9yc2F5LTIyNTI0MzQvYW1wLXBhZ2U?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Luxury goods conglomerate LVMH, which is owned by the French billionaire art collector Bernard Arnault, made headlines around the world last week when it was revealed that the company had shelled out €43 million (nearly $47 million) to acquire Gustave Caillebotte’s famous Impressionist painting The Boating Party for the Musée d’Orsay.

In early 2020, the painting was deemed a national treasure and thus denied an export license. France then had a period of 30 months to come up with the necessary funds to buy the work and keep it in the country. With an annual acquisitions budget of just €3 million, the likelihood that the state-owned Musee d’Orsay could come up with the funds was slim to say the least.

So voilà! LVMH came to the rescue. The painting was unveiled, to much fanfare, at a museum ceremony last week attended by Musée d’Orsay president Christophe Leribault, minister of culture Rima Abdul Malak, and Jean-Paul Claverie, advisor to Bernard Arnault.

“Thanks to the exclusive patronage of LVMH, I am delighted that this masterpiece will enrich the heritage of the nation and can be presented in several cities in France,” said Malak.

“LVMH thus affirms, once again, its commitment to the preservation and promotion of the national artistic and cultural heritage,” said Claverie.

Amid the celebration, some were quick to point out that under French patronage laws, LVMH is entitled to a massive tax break—as much as 90 percent of the purchase price (so long as that amount falls within the limit of 50 percent of the tax due). Does that strip away some of the benevolent luster of such a massive donation? It depends on who you ask.

It's not a ""€43m donation from LVMH"" since the operation allows the conglomerate a 90% tax cut on the 43m: in fact it's almost only the French tax payers who pay for it @garethharr @TheArtNewspaper https://t.co/S7Zf4EJM8K — Magali Lesauvage (@MagLesauvage) January 31, 2023

Journalist Magali Lesauvage tweeted: “It’s not a ‘€43m donation from LVMH’ since the operation allows the conglomerate a 90% tax cut on the 43m: in fact it’s almost only the French tax payers who pay for it.”

“This law on corporate sponsorship in France is widely criticized,” said Paris attorney Beatrice Cohen. “It creates a dichotomy between the essence of sponsorship, i.e. the donation, and the fiscal compensation that is granted to the sponsor, which some consider to be disproportionate, believing that it is more a matter of defiscalization and publicity for the sponsor than a real involvement in cultural sponsorship; private individuals do not benefit from such ‘fiscal advantages.'”

Call it a “friendly tension,” between tax collecting entities and French cultural organizations, said Paris attorney Anne-Sophie Nardon, who specializes in art law.

“The program is very popular, but it’s not popular with the treasury department,” she said, noting that the tax break means a loss of revenue for them. (We reached out to France’s ministry of finance, but a representative directed us to contact the ministry of culture.)

“It seems fair,” Nardon said of the inter-agency tension, “that even if the price is high, the company that is offering/donating money for the purchase of the painting should benefit from the tax deduction. This has been a huge help for the Louvre, for instance, which has been able to acquire several national treasures because of this patronage law.”

Overall, she calls it a “win-win” strategy.

“This law established in French public life the idea that philanthropy was not only useful but necessary and that it was up to it to promote the general interest, alongside of course the public authorities and among others the state,” said Jean-Jacques Aillagon, the former culture minister who spearheaded the now two-decade-old law, and who is an advisor to Francois Pinault. “The results of this law are regularly established by the government but also, for cultural patronage, by private organizations such as Admical. This assessment is positive.”

Aillagon was not involved with any of the recent negotiations for the Caillebotte, but told Artnet News in an email that he was “delighted” to see the painting join the Musée d’Orsay’s collection.

Asked how he responds to critics of the patronage structure, Aillagon said: “There is a misunderstanding here. The 90 percent tax reduction is not a gift to the company that buys a national treasure, but the authorization given to it by the state to allocate part of the tax it owes to an action that the state has declared to be in the general interest, on condition that it adds a sort of voluntary tax, in this case the 10 percent of the price of the work not covered by the reduction.”

“I would like to add that this system allows our museums and libraries to benefit indirectly from an increase in their acquisition budgets, which are often very modest,” he said. “In France, their ability to acquire works of art is also supported by the dation system, which makes it possible to pay inheritance tax by handing over works of art. This is essentially how the collections of the Picasso Museum were built up, first by the estate of Pablo Picasso himself, and then by his heirs.”

Claverie, who advised Arnault on the transaction, also sees the structure as a win-win. He noted that this acquisition is the highest price paid to date to keep a “national treasure” in the country.

It also marks the second-highest price ever publicly recorded for a Caillebotte painting. The record of $53 million was set in November 2021 when Christie’s sold Jeune homme à sa fenêtre (1876), part of the collection of late oil magnate Edwin Cox, to the Getty Museum in Los Angeles.

Claverie noted that Boating Party is one of the last masterpieces in private hands in France, noting that the image is famous and has appeared in dozens of catalogues and art history books, but had rarely been seen in person because it was in private hands. “Now they can come to the Musée d’Orsay and see it in real life. It’s an enrichment but also a discovery and a gift to the people.”

Claverie noted that the work is part of LVMH’s broad philanthropic efforts, which extend to music, medicine, and a variety of other programs. “We were very, very enthusiastic about this acquisition and gift to the national collection.”

According to a report from the Swiss newspaper Finanz und Wirtschaft, LVMH is eyeing a takeover of competitor Richemont. If that’s not possible, LVMH wants to acquire Cartier from Richemont, as a complement to Tiffany & Co. which it bought in 2021, per the story.

Taking ownership of Cartier, best known for its high-end jewelry and Tank watch, would help LVMH grow its jewelry segment to match its dominance in leather goods and bags. According to the report, Johann Rupert, patriarch of the Rupert family which has a controlling stake in Cartier, is averse to the sale and will attempt to resist it.

While Richemont may be one of LVMH’s main competitors along with Kering, the two are quite lopsided in size. LVMH’s annual revenue in 2022 was north of $83 billion, while Richemont’s was $22 billion.

Luxury earnings show China is still an open question

China continues to be a question mark for luxury brands, according to recent earnings reports. After China lifted its zero-Covid policy in December, rising infections in the region disrupted many brands’ plans. On Thursday, MyTheresa’s earnings showed that its sales in China heavily contracted in the last quarter, leading to overall slowed sales and just a 1% increase in overall revenue. Also on Thursday, Farfetch blamed its lower quarterly sales on the loss of business in Russia and low demand in China. Total sales in China across its brands have dropped about 2% since December.

But not every brand operating in China has seen the same problems. Alibaba said that increased demand in China helped boost its business, leading to a 2% rise in revenue.

Farfetch is hoping a turnaround in China is just around the corner. The company also expects the layoffs and office closures it enacted earlier this year will help take $85 million off its expenses. It has goals of increasing its profits by 10% this year and reaching $10 billion in revenue by 2025.

SaksOff5th focuses on e-commerce and loyalty

SaksOff5th hired Julie Mares, an e-commerce veteran who’s worked at UnTuckit and Gucci, in a critical new digital role of svp of e-commerce. The company’s CEO, Paige Thomas, said last week that the hire is part of a reshifting of priorities.

According to Thomas, no one person or department was in charge of SaksOff5th’s e-commerce experience. Mares’ goal will be to oversee every element, from the online store to the app to the digital loyalty program.

SaksOff5th’s investment in e-commerce comes at a time when many brands and retailers are turning their focus back to brick-and-mortar. Online sales across brands had a huge boom in 2021 but slowed by the beginning of 2023. But Thomas sees the company’s digital loyalty program, which has attracted 1.6 million members since its launch less than a year ago, as key to its further growth. And, she said, e-commerce needed to grow that program."
LVMH Partners with Dow on Sustainable Packaging for Cosmetics and Perfume Brands - ESG Today,"Mon, 20 Feb 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVzZ3RvZGF5LmNvbS9sdm1oLXBhcnRuZXJzLXdpdGgtZG93LW9uLXN1c3RhaW5hYmxlLXBhY2thZ2luZy1mb3ItY29zbWV0aWNzLWFuZC1wZXJmdW1lLWJyYW5kcy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Chemicals and materials science giant Dow Inc. announced today the launch of a new collaboration with LVMH Beauty, aimed at accelerating the use of sustainable packaging across LVMH’s perfume and cosmetics product brands, with plans to begin utilizing bio-based and circular plastics on key brands this year.

A division of leading luxury company LVMH, LVMH Beauty’s perfumes & cosmetics brands include Parfums Christian Dior, Parfums Givenchy, Guerlain, Benefit Cosmetics and STELLA by Stella McCartney. LVMH Group’s sustainability commitments include eliminating fossil-based virgin plastic in packaging by 2026, with an interim 2023 goal to strengthen sustainable materials efforts.

Under the new initiative, the companies will work to integrate bio-based and circular plastics for applications including premium perfume caps and cosmetic cream jars. The plastics will be produced using Dow’s sustainable SURLYN Ionomers. The bio-based polymers will use feedstock materials that only include waste residues or by-products from an alternative production process, while the circular SURLYN will utilize hard-to-recycle mixed plastic waste transformed through advanced recycling technologies.

The sustainable packaging initiative will begin with perfume brand GUERLAIN La Petite Robe Noire.

Claude Martinez, Executive President and Managing Director of LVMH Beauty, said:

“At LVMH, with our Life 360 program, we made the decision that our packaging will contain zero plastic from virgin fossil resources in a near future. Collaborating with Dow in developing sustainable SURLYN™ is key as this material is used in some of our iconic perfumes, starting with GUERLAIN La Petite Robe Noire. It is helping LVMH achieve our sustainability targets without any compromise on quality.”

The new collaboration follows the launch by Dow in October of a new business platform, Circular & Renewable Solutions, aligned with the company’s Packaging & Specialty Plastics operating segment, along with a target to commercialize 3 million metric tons of circular and renewable solutions annually by 2030.

LVMH expands Provence rosé offering by acquiring Château Minuty - Decanter.com,"Thu, 16 Feb 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlY2FudGVyLmNvbS93aW5lLW5ld3MvbHZtaC1leHBhbmRzLXByb3ZlbmNlLXJvc2Utb2ZmZXJpbmctYnktYWNxdWlyaW5nLWNoYXRlYXUtbWludXR5LTQ5Nzc5My_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"After years of rumour that Moët-Hennessy, part of the LVMH luxury goods group, was buying Château Minuty – and years of denial – the sale was officially announced on the final day of Wine Paris on Wednesday 15 February, creating a ripple of gossip, speculation and discussion around the fair.

Throughout France, and even globally, Minuty has long been seen as the ultimate expression of Provence rosé. It’s thanks to Minuty’s success that many producers outside of Provence have emulated its style.

Château Minuty is one of the 23 original cru classé estates in the 1955 classification. Today Minuty has 160ha of vines spread across the Saint-Tropez peninsula, the Côtes de Provence’s most expensive area – the average vineyard value is €100,000 (£90,000) per hectare, according to SAFER, an organisation which reports agricultural and viticultural land sales and prices. Since the 1990s, Minuty has also had a highly successful négociant business.

Minuty has belonged to the Farnet family since 1936, (Farnet-Matton since the 1960s). According to a press release, the agreement sees Moët-Hennessy acquiring a majority stake in Minuty, estimated to have cost between €350m and €450m (£312m-£400m), with the family remaining involved in running the estate. Current executives and descendants of the founder, Jean-Etienne and François Matton, will continue to manage the company.

LVMH’s exisiting Provence properties

Moët-Hennessy purchased the cru classé estate Château Galoupet (69ha) in 2019, followed by a majority share in Château d’Esclans and the Caves d’Esclans négociant business (including Whispering Angel), with them set to take over the remaining part of the business in January 2024. (Château d’Esclans also previously purchased neighbouring Domaine des Grands Esclans).

In January 2023 it was announced that Moët-Hennessy had purchased Jas d’Esclans, a cru classé estate adjoining Château d’Esclans. The purchase included the nearby Château de Vaucouleurs (24ha).

Jeany Cronk of Maison Mirabeau, a member of the administrative council of the Conseil Interprofessionnel des Vins de Provence (CIVP), commented: ‘Clearly its [Moët-Hennessy] very considerable investment in the region is a huge vote of confidence for our rosés and their place in the future of wine consumption.’

Although official figures are rarely published, local estimates put production of Esclans’ Whispering Angel at around 14 million bottles, and Minuty’s M de Minuty at eight million bottles. Overall, Minuty’s sales exceed nine million bottles. Moët-Hennessy’s total Provence rosé sales, including estate wines, is likely to comfortably exceed 25 million bottles for the 2023 vintage. The entire appellation of Côtes de Provence produced 101 million bottles of rosé in 2021 .

The businesses purchased by Moët-Hennessy are not in direct competition with each other and will each be run independently, under the one parent company. Château d’Esclans and Caves d’Esclans have a vast distribution in the US market. Minuty is well established in France and Asia, where it has already been distributed by Moët-Hennessy for several years.

Eric Pasterino, president of the CIVP, is in favour of smaller producers grouping together to give value to their production and individuality, to introduce the concept of ‘grower rosé’ akin to grower Champagne. Cronk agrees, noting that ‘work needs to be done to ensure that a healthy balance is achieved between the power of the very big houses and smaller producers, as this diversity is an important aspect in the attractiveness of our wines in the eye of the consumer’.

Swiss Watchmaker Daniel Roth Is Getting Relaunched Under Louis Vuitton - Robb Report,"Thu, 23 Feb 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vcm9iYnJlcG9ydC5jb20vc3R5bGUvd2F0Y2gtY29sbGVjdG9yL2RhbmllbC1yb3RoLXdpbGwtYmUtcmV2aXZlZC11bmRlci1sdm1oLTEyMzQ4MTEyOTkv0gFjaHR0cHM6Ly9yb2JicmVwb3J0LmNvbS9zdHlsZS93YXRjaC1jb2xsZWN0b3IvZGFuaWVsLXJvdGgtd2lsbC1iZS1yZXZpdmVkLXVuZGVyLWx2bWgtMTIzNDgxMTI5OS9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"For the last few years, collectors and dealers have been increasingly interested in acquiring neo-vintage Daniel Roth timepieces. Back in 2021, prominent Malaysian dealer Sean Song, told Robb Report he had the brand on his radar and cited it as “one-to-watch” in the secondary market. A Collected Man has sold more than a few; a platinum-cased Monopusher from the early ’90s sold for $110,000 on the site just last June. And, not surprisingly, LVMH has taken notice. Daniel Roth has been owned by Bulgari since 2000 (it was bought by the Hour Glass in 1994 before being sold to the Italian jeweler), and Bulgari was then purchased by LVMH in 2011. Now, the luxury conglomerate is moving Daniel Roth from underneath Bulgari’s wing to Louis Vuitton’s La Fabrique du Temps manufacturer.

The brand will continue to operate independently but will be run with “guidance and incubation,” according to the press statement from La Fabrique du Temps’s master watchmakers Michel Navas and Enrico Barbasini. You can expect some serious watchmaking to come out of this new direction, with pieces that will likely be highly covetable—if done well.

Daniel Roth Platinum Monopusher A Collected Man

Navas and Barbasini may operate behind-the-scenes working on funkier, more fashion-forward (but still seriously complicated) watches for Louis Vuitton, but they cut their teeth working under some of watchmaking’s greatest names. They spent approximately seven years working for Gerald Genta while he was still at the helm of his company (also purchased by Bulgari in 2000), and the duo was employed by Patek Philippe’s high-complication department, where they handled minute repeaters and other notoriously challenging complications. Navas also had a stint at Audemars Piguet, and both worked at Franck Muller, where they helped created the company’s famous Crazy Hours and Revolution tourbillon watches. Eventually, the duo would go on to found BNB Concept (along with Matthias Buttet) in 2004 working on high complications for Hublot, Bell & Ross, Jacob & Co. and more. Navas and Barbasini eventually left and began working with LV under their newly established workshop, La Fabrique du Temps, in 2007 until the operation was purchased by LVMH in 2011 (the same year the luxury conglomerate purchased Bulgari).

WATCH

Daniel Roth’s namesake, however, is no longer with the company, starting when it was sold to Bulgari, but he remains a living legend in the world of watchmaking. Roth is considered a master watchmaker and rose to prominence alongside the likes of François-Paul Journe and Roger Dubuis. The latter is also no longer involved in his namesake company, which is now 100 percent owned by LVMH’s rival Richemont. The timepieces, however, are a vast departure from those made by its founder and veer more in the direction of an avant-garde high-end streetwear aesthetic versus more traditional Swiss watchmaking codes.

Will Daniel Roth follow the same path now that there is a renewed focus from LVMH? According to the press statement, “Daniel Roth will aim to capture the mechanical and contemporary classicism that defined Roth’s work in its earliest days.” That is good news for collectors that are familiar with and love the brand’s past work. But given the output of just a few 100 pieces per year, not many will get to see one on the wrist. The first watch available for order will be produced in a 20-piece “souscription” series (meaning that clients must “subscribe” by paying before seeing the finished product in the metal). The release of the new timepieces is said to be slated to drop in a few months."

“Observers believe that [LVMH chairman Bernard Arnault] has already tried to put pressure on [his] Swiss competitor in a roundabout way,” it said.

LVMH was said to be particularly interested in Richemont’s best-known jewelry holding, Cartier.

Both LVMH and Richemont did not respond to requests for comment by JCK by the time of publication.

The newspaper was careful to note that the takeover talk is currently “little more than a whisper.”

On Twitter, Simone Stern, the reporter who wrote the story, added: “LVMH will not let up until they’ve acquired Richemont – and Johann Rupert could step down from his position as [Richemont] Chairman as early as this year, some say.”

Influential fashion and luxury newsletter Miss Tweed cast doubt on the report.

“Luxury investors got excited last week after the German-Swiss newspaper Finanz und Wirtschaft published a story suggesting LVMH was interested in buying Richemont,” wrote editor Astrid Wendlandt on LinkedIn. “It turned out to be fake news. The market didn’t take it seriously and Richemont’s shares hardly moved.”

Richemont’s stable of brands includes Cartier, Van Cleef & Arpels, Buccellati, Baume & Mercier, Vacheron Constantin, Panerai, and Jaeger-LeCoultre.

Considering the large footprint LVMH already has, a possible tie-up would likely raise significant antitrust concerns.

“As it is, LVMH’s revenues are more or less the same as the combined revenues of its next six largest competitors,” wrote Bryce Quillin, founder of strategy agency It’s a Working Title, on Twitter.

Richemont-owned Cartier and LVMH-owned Tiffany recently settled a lawsuit over a Tiffany employee’s purported theft of Cartier’s “trade secrets.”

Last September, Richemont shareholders voted down a proposal to add former LVMH exec Francesco Trapani to its board, with Richemont chair Rupert calling him an “inappropriate” candidate given his longtime ties to its rival.

Can Design Holding become the LVMH of home? - Business of Home,"Tue, 21 Feb 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vYnVzaW5lc3NvZmhvbWUuY29tL2FydGljbGVzL2Nhbi1kZXNpZ24taG9sZGluZy1iZWNvbWUtdGhlLWx2bWgtb2YtaG9tZdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"You may have never heard of a company called Design Holding. That’s OK. Even its CEO, European luxury veteran Daniel Lalonde, doesn’t mind. “It’s not important for our end consumer to understand that all our brands are in the same group,” he tells host Dennis Scully on the latest episode of The Business of Home Podcast. What is important? That those brands themselves—a fast-growing group including Flos, B&B Italia, Louis Poulsen, Fendi Casa, Maxalto and Lumens, among others—become, as Lalonde puts it, “big, global, desirable brands.”

Born out of a joint venture between two powerhouse private equity firms, Design Holding began in 2018 with the merging of B&B Italia, Flos and Louis Poulsen under one corporate umbrella. Since then, the group has been on an acquisition tear, snapping up seven brands to reach a total of 10 today. The ultimate goal, says Lalonde, is to become the first truly global portfolio of luxury design brands—something akin to the LVMH of home.

It’ll take a lot of work, and Lalonde describes an aggressive business strategy, ranging from better direct-to-consumer sales to expansion into China and within the U.S., along with a bigger brick-and-mortar fleet (Design Holding has been piloting a retail store that showcases all of its brands under one roof). “I think the high-end design segment will change over time,” he says. “And we as leaders have a responsibility to make that change—get closer to consumers, look at global markets and modern ways to communicate. … But we have a long way to go, and I want to accelerate that.”

Designers, says Lalonde, are a key customer—though he expresses some desire to move away from trade discounts as a default pricing model, and toward one-price-fits-all transparency. “I’d like to go back to my Louis Vuitton playbook where there’s never any discount for anyone anytime. That’s the ultimate luxury brand. You go even further, like Hermès—you’re lucky if you can even get in the line to buy a product they will deliver a year from today,” he says, laughing. “I’m not saying we’re there. There’s no magic solution today, but the ambition we have is to make that whole equation much more transparent and fair than it is potentially today.”

Of all the changes Lalonde is hoping to make, tweaking the portfolio brands is not one of them. Indeed, the entire premise of Design Holding, he says, is to preserve and leverage the heritage of its brands—a quality that can’t be faked or rushed to market. “There need to be stories of the past, a founding act, and you need to build that,” he says. “To create a luxury brand, in my view, takes time.”

Dow to produce new grades of sustainable Surlyn in partnership with LVMH - Premium beauty,"Mon, 06 Feb 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnByZW1pdW1iZWF1dHluZXdzLmNvbS9lbi9kb3ctdG8tcHJvZHVjZS1uZXctZ3JhZGVzLW9mLDIxNDg40gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Dow and LVMH Beauty have announced their intention to collaborate to accelerate the use of sustainable packaging across the LVMH’s portfolio of perfume and cosmetic brands.

Two new Surlyn grades

The collaboration aims to enable both bio-based and circular plastics to be integrated into several of the beauty multinational’s product applications without compromising functionality or quality of the packaging. Dow’s priority is to be able to produce their well-known Surlyn resin in a sustainable way.

Surlyn (a copolymer of ethylene and methacrylic acid) is the first ionomer resin that was placed on the market, back in 1964. It is widely used as a coating and packaging material because of its glass-like transparency. It is precisely this requirement for transparency that makes it difficult to use recycled materials to produce it.

In 2019, in partnership with Premi, Dow had already presented caps made of 40% Surlyn from post-industrial manufacturing scraps. The material was recovered from industrial plastic waste then crushed prior to being integrated into a new production process. Since the large amount of recycled material used to make the caps prevented reaching the high level of transparency characteristic of Surlyn, these caps had been presented in colourful versions.

To overcome this hurdle, Dow turned to an advanced recycling solution in partnership with specialized manufacturers, but also to the use of bio-based feedstock. “We hope to launch two new grades of sustainable Surlyn by the end of the year: a bio-based grade; and a circular grade created from advanced recycling, without compromising on quality,” said Shouhaib Mohamed, Marketing Manager, Cosmetic Packaging EMEA at Dow.

Transparent and sustainable jars and caps

For the production of bio-based Surlyn, Dow plans to use raw materials such as used cooking oil. According to Dow, only waste residues or by-products from an alternative production process will be utilized, these raw feedstock materials will not consume extra land resources nor compete with the food chain.

""We are committed not to compete with food resources for the production of our polymers"", emphasizes Shouhaib Mohamed.

For the circular Surlyn grade, Dow will use advanced recycling technologies to transform mixed plastic wastes that are hard-to-recycle through traditional mechanical processes. These technologies break down waste plastics into their basic chemical elements using heat and pressure, creating raw material that is equivalent to those made from virgin fossil feedstock. This raw material, or circular feedstock, can be used in a wide range of packaging, giving waste that is currently going to landfill or being incinerated a second life.

“We have entered into various partnerships with manufacturers of these recycled materials,” continues Shouhaib Mohamed.

Dow promises these new grades of sustainable Surlyn will deliver similar crystalline transparency and freedom of design expected from the rest of the range. Within 2023, they will be used by LVMH Beauty to lower the carbon footprint of their packaging (mostly perfume caps and cosmetic cream jars).

“At LVMH, with our Life 360 program, we made the decision that our packaging will contain zero plastic from virgin fossil resources in a near future. Collaborating with Dow in developing sustainable Surlyn is key, as this material is used in some of our iconic perfumes, starting with Guerlain La Petite Robe Noire. It is helping LVMH achieve our sustainability targets without any compromise on quality”, said Claude Martinez, Executive President and Managing Director of LVMH Beauty."

It goes to Nona Source, who now has four new young ambassadors.

Nona Source has appointed four new young ambassador designers as part of its “Mindful Creatives” initiative to promote its model of reselling spare fabrics from the massive fashion brand LVMH.

Cecilie Bahnsen, Karoline Vitto, Nensi Dojaka, and Victor Weinsanto are the first ambassadors for Nona Source,the first company to take fabrics and leathers that major fashion houses aren’t using to resell to creative designers.

By working alongside LVMH, Nona Source repurposes enormous amounts of material from the multinational company that incorporates Louis Vuitton, Moët & Chandon, and Hennessy and owns major fashion brands like Tiffany & Co., Christian Dior, Fendi, Givenchy and Marc Jacobs.

Nona Source has been working with LVMH since 2021, first online and then opening physical showrooms in Paris and London.

All four designers will get specialised support from LVMH and a financial endowment to buy fabrics from Nona Source to use in their projects.

Clockwise from top left: Cecilie Bahnsen, Nensi Dojaka, Victor Weinsanto and Karoline Vitto Nona Source

Cecilie Bahnsen is a Danish designer who was the first Dane to be nominated for the LVMH Prize in 2017, who has had her work exhibited in Paris; Brazilian-born and London based Karoline Vitto has founded an eponymous brand that champions inclusivity and responsible resource use; Nensi Dojaka won the LVMH Prize in 2021 and created her own brand last year; and Victor Weinsanto from France opened the Fashion Week last September.

Nona Source is the first company to organise directly with a major fashion house to find a way to repurpose materials that may have gone to waste. But they’re not the only exciting sustainable venture going on in the fashion world right now.

Staying in style sustainably

As the fashion industry is responsible for 4-10% of global greenhouse gases every year, finding ways to make the industry more sustainable is an absolute necessity.

One of the best ways for individuals to live more sustainably while still getting their fix of new clothes is to shop secondhand and vintage.

But if you just have to have new items, then there are better brands to go for. Over on Euronews Green, we spoke to Lucy & Yak co-founder Lucy Greenwood on the ways she’s made her clothes brand sustainable.

Greenwood and her partner Chris started the fashion brand famous for its dungarees after a backpacking trip where they started making tobacco pouches out of old t-shirts.

They now run a company that pays its tailors four times the state wage in India while working in clean, air conditioned factories running on solar power. Greenwood even argues against using the word sustainable around their fabrics without qualifications.

“Yes we’ve got some sustainable fabrics, but anyone who is producing anything new isn’t fully sustainable. I hate using words if we’re not 100% that thing,” she says.

Originally proposed last year, the New York Fashion Act has been recently tweaked to require even more stringent requirements for companies’ chemical use and climate targets.

Currently, the proposed legislation would have companies with revenue of over $100 million disclose at least 50% of their supply chains and the climate impact of their methods. In addition, they will have to disclose their median worker wages. Brands not in compliance with regulations will have fines levied against them."

Bernard Arnault makes moves for the luxury EV market in a new deal with Lotus - Fortune,"Wed, 01 Feb 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vZm9ydHVuZS5jb20vZXVyb3BlLzIwMjMvMDIvMDEvZWxvbi1tdXNrLWJlcm5hcmQtYXJuYXVsdC1sdXh1cnktZWxlY3RyaWMtY2FyLW1hcmtldC10ZXNsYS1sb3R1cy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Bernard Arnault, the world’s richest man, may be taking on Elon Musk, the second richest, to see who will lead the premium electric vehicle market—at least when it comes to exclusivity and brand cachet.

The Frenchman, head of luxury goods group LVMH, plans to help take niche English sports car brand Lotus public through a so-called SPAC deal in the latter half of this year.

In a statement published Tuesday, the Arnault-affiliated “blank check” investment vehicle L Catterton Asia Acquisition Corp said it agreed to a reverse merger with Lotus Technology in a deal that will effectively value the latter at $5.4 billion in combined equity and debt.

The privately held carmaker’s existing shareholders, which include Hangzhou-based Zhejiang Geely Holding, will retain 89.7% of the merged entity assuming no LCAA investors redeem their Nasdaq-listed shares.

“The global EV market is expanding rapidly, with the luxury segment growing at a faster pace than the broader industry,” said Chinta Bhagat, co-CEO of LCAA, in the statement. “Lotus Tech is well positioned to benefit from these dynamics.”

LVMH could not be reached by Fortune for comment.

Although Arnault cobbled together Europe’s most valuable company through decades of methodical acquisitions, it’s extremely unlikely he has any intention of rivaling Elon Musk in his own EV market.

That’s because Lotus, majority-owned by Chinese automotive billionaire Li Shufu via his Geely Holding, is actually quite small—even by niche brand standards.

Lotus has the kind of heritage that appeals to Arnault

In 2021, the final year of production for the Elise, Exige, and Evora car models, the Norfolk-based Lotus company sold just 1,710 new cars—and that was its best result in a decade. All told, Lotus has barely built more than 100,000 vehicles in its history.

By comparison, Tesla sold over 1.3 million vehicles last year, nearly 67,000 of which were its luxury S and X models. Tesla forecasts it could sell 1.8 million in 2023, and potentially even more.

Yet Lotus does feature what appeals to Arnault: a European heritage and luxury cachet it traces back 75 years to when cofounder Colin Chapman built his first car in a London garage.

The brand first achieved prominence in the 1977 film The Spy Who Loved Me, when fictional British secret agent James Bond traded in his Aston Martin DBS for the wedge-shaped Lotus Esprit S1, designed by industry legend Giorgetto Giugaro.

While it has gone through a slew of different owners that failed to translate its previous successes in motorsport into a thriving business, Lotus has still retained a certain mystique.

It was this storied reputation that helped attract the highly respected auto manager Jean-Marc Gales in May 2014 to serve as its CEO for four years. The native Luxembourger stabilized the troubled company and helped it achieve profitability prior to the 2017 sale to Shufu and the latter’s minority partner in the deal, Etika Automotiv of Malaysia.

In addition to the new Lotus Emira that launched in November and the £89,500 ($110,155)-priced Eletre SUV that rolls into markets from the first quarter of this year, the EV carmaker plans to use the funds from the reverse IPO to develop a midsize SUV and a full-size sedan over the next four years.

Important, however, is that it aims to avoid saddling itself with any fixed costs by partnering to have its cars built at Geely’s Wuhan plant in China.

There is one more historic significance to the brand that might appeal to Arnault: Due to Lotus’s longtime focus on engineering lightweight sports cars, the Elise’s chassis served as the underpinnings for the original battery-powered Tesla Roadster.

To this day that fact still irks Musk, who two years ago called it a “super-dumb strategy.”"
Asia Set to Take a Greater Role in LVMH's Growth Moving Forward - LUXUO,"Tue, 21 Feb 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmx1eHVvLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy9idXNpbmVzcy1sdXh1cnkvbHZtaC1maW5hbmNpYWwtcmVzdWx0cy0yMDIyLWFzaWEuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Business / Business of Luxury

Feb 21, 2023 | By Joseph Low

Bernard Arnault

LVMH celebrated another record year in 2022 as the conglomerate announced total revenue of €79.2 billion, which is a 23 per cent increase compared to 2021. The net profit was up 17 per cent, hitting €14.1 billion for the same comparative period. While the growth for the entire year was in double digits, its fourth-quarter sales only grew by 9 per cent, which is the time since 2020 but still above the consensus forecast of a 6 to 7 per cent rise according to analysts.

The owner of the world’s most luxurious brands, like Louis Vuitton, Dior and Tiffany & Co., cited that despite the ongoing economic and geopolitical challenges, it can “create desire”. But looking at the results more deeply, one would notice that the acceleration LVMH used to have has slowed down over the past quarters. Many of its sales are intrinsically linked to China’s economy and policies. Stringent Covid-19 lockdown and quarantine measures have impacted luxury sales across the brands. This is reflected in the drop in organic revenues in Asia — which fell 8 per cent in the three months to 31 December.

Dior Men FW23

LVMH reported that sales in other key markets like Europe, Japan and North America had “strong growth in business” as international travel resumed. In particular, Europe saw a 22 per cent increase while across the Atlantic, the US only grew by 7 per cent. Jean-Jacques Guiony, chief finance officer of LVMH, explained that the stronger US dollar prompted many buyers to flock to Europe, where they make their purchases.

Across the different groups, CEO and Chairman Bernard Arnault made a point to highlight that its fashion and leather group remained to be the core of its business. Louis Vuitton’s revenue surpassed €20 billion for the first time, while Celine doubled to more than €2 billion under creative director Hedi Slimane’s helm. At Dior, its products continue to be popular among buyers and the fashion show presentations are a source of inspiration for many.

At the watches and jewellery maisons, it saw revenue growth of 18 per cent in 2022 while profit from recurring operations was up 20 per cent. At the forefront is Tiffany & Co., which saw its High Jewellery revenue doubled, and other products like the Lock bracelet collection enjoyed great success in the US. Bvlgari’s High Jewellery and High Watchmaking collection continue to be its main drivers, such as the Serpenti line and the record-breaking Octo Finissimo Ultra. Elsewhere, TAG Heuer’s newly launched Carrera Plasma ushered in a new era of watchmaking with the addition of lab-grown diamonds and Hublot was in the spotlight as the official timekeeper for the prestigious 2022 Football World Cup in Qatar.

Change of Guards

The Arnault Family

Aside from the spectacular growth, the LVMH group also underwent several shifts in its management level. Long-time CEO of Louis Vuitton Michael Burke has stepped down to take up the advisor role within the group, while Pietro Beccari, CEO of Dior, will be his successor. In turn, Louis Vuitton’s executive president for product Delphine Arnault, the eldest child of Bernard Arnault, will become CEO at Dior.

The changes within the family-owned conglomerate signal a need for continual renewal, which Bernard Arnault explained, “In a large company, as in any human organisation, you have to evolve. I think it’s very bad to keep a form of organisation [that] leads to a spirit of routine.”

Despite this significant shakeup, Bernard Arnault has shot down the rumours of his stepping down as CEO and Chairman. LVMH’s board of directors had agreed to extend the retirement age to 80 years old — in line with France’s new policy.

A Focus in Asia

Based on the financial results, Asia’s share of sales is one of the smallest but the group is recentring its effort into the region. The world’s largest luxury group announced new brand ambassadors to its Maisons over the past months like BTS’ Jimin at Dior Men, Big Bang’s Taeyang at Givenchy, Park Bogum at Celine, NewJeans’ Hyein at Louis Vuitton, and Lee Minho at Fendi.

These appointments tell of LVMH’s new area of focus — Asia. A report by Morgan Stanley estimated that South Koreans’ total spending on luxury goods grew by 24 per cent to US$16.8 billion. The country has outspent major powerhouses like the US and China, making it the largest consumer of luxury goods. It makes sense that the group is investing more resources into the region, with spin-off shows and special showcases to capture a larger market share. Hence, the spade of new Asian ambassadors at the various Maisons is to capitalise on the rise of Asian idols, particularly South Korean celebrities.

However, one would be remiss to ignore the potential that China holds despite not having the highest appetite for luxury consumption. The Middle Kingdom is the world’s second-largest economy, and many sectors depend on this enormous country for growth. It is an open secret that the Chinese economy has been slowing over the past two years, which could partly be due to the strict zero-Covid policies that the government had been enforcing but it has inevitably hurt the economy.

The Chinese government understands the need to revitalise the country so it has lifted the ban on international travel and scrapped the need for quarantine. With travel now possible, businesses like LVMH hope it would help to make up for the falling sales number from the West as soaring inflation and geopolitical challenges dampen consumer sentiments.

“I’m quite confident that the Chinese leaders being very shrewd, they will surely take advantage of the period that is starting to revitalise Chinese growth. If this is the case — and we’ve seen signs of it in January — then we have every reason to be confident, even optimistic, about the Chinese market,” Bernard Arnault shared with analysts at the release of the 2022 financial results.

In addition, international travellers from China will likely choose destinations nearby the country like Singapore, Thailand and South Korea. Therefore, more emphasis would be made in the region to engage with Chinese customers continuously. Countries in the West will likely see international tourists return in the second half of 2023.

“The Group will pursue its brand development focused strategy, underpinned by continued innovation and investment as well as a constant quest for desirability and quality in its products and their distribution,” the press release for the 2022 financial results concluded.

“Driven by the agility of its teams, their entrepreneurial spirit and its well diversified presence across businesses and geographic areas in which its customers are located, LVMH enters 2023 with confidence and once again, sets an objective of reinforcing its global leadership position in luxury goods.”

Gucci launches ultra-high-end salons to close the gap with Louis Vuitton - Style,"Sat, 18 Feb 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMinAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5zY21wLmNvbS9tYWdhemluZXMvc3R5bGUvbHV4dXJ5L2FydGljbGUvMzIxMDYwMy93aGF0LWFyZS1ndWNjaXMtbmV3LXNhbG9ucy11bHRyYS13ZWFsdGh5LWx2bWgtcml2YWwtbG91aXMtdnVpdHRvbi1hcHBvaW50cy1waGFycmVsbC13aWxsaWFtcy1hbmTSAZwBaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAuc2NtcC5jb20vbWFnYXppbmVzL3N0eWxlL2x1eHVyeS9hcnRpY2xlLzMyMTA2MDMvd2hhdC1hcmUtZ3VjY2lzLW5ldy1zYWxvbnMtdWx0cmEtd2VhbHRoeS1sdm1oLXJpdmFsLWxvdWlzLXZ1aXR0b24tYXBwb2ludHMtcGhhcnJlbGwtd2lsbGlhbXMtYW5k?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Chasing after the ultra-rich whose fortunes are largely immune to economic turbulence, Gucci will stock the new private boutiques with some of its highest-end clothing, furniture and jewellery.

Gucci is banking on new ultra-high-end “salons” offering merchandise priced at up to US$3 million to help narrow a widening gap with rival Louis Vuitton as it waits for its new creative director to arrive.

“Nothing will cost less than US$40,000, and it will go up to as much as US$3 million for high jewellery,” Kering boss François-Henri Pinault said this week.

Filling the gap

Gucci’s focus on its wealthiest clients is a key element of its growth strategy after the brand’s sales fell 14 per cent in the last three months of 2022, dragged down by Covid-19 curbs in China and reduced appetite for its clothes in the United States – particularly among lower-spending shoppers.

New Gucci creative director Sabato De Sarno is set to take the helm in the second quarter and to present his first fashion show in September in Milan . But because De Sarno’s collections won’t hit the stores before next year, Gucci is under pressure to make sure it doesn’t lose more momentum in sales and margins in coming months.

“We are not just waiting for Sabato to arrive,” Pinault said, adding the label would promote an exhibit of its archives on a world tour with a first stop in Shanghai. It will also ramp up its presence on the catwalk – with a show in Milan this month and a cruise collection in Seoul in May.

Some of the new private salons will be within Gucci’s existing stores, while others will be in new boutiques, including on Los Angeles’ Melrose Avenue, opening in April.

Pinault conceded 2022 results for Gucci, which accounts for just over half of group sales and three quarters of its profit, fell short of his expectations. Kering was also hit by controversy over ads featuring children for its Balenciaga brand that dented year-end sales.

Drop in marketing spend

Between 2015-2019, Gucci’s profits increased nearly fourfold as sales almost trebled , lifted by the popularity of the eccentric, gender-fluid designs of Alessandro Michele.

But the brand has lost favour with shoppers since, just as rivals like LVMH’s Louis Vuitton and Hermès maintained strong sales growth despite inflation and economic uncertainty.

Michele departed Gucci abruptly in November after falling out with managers, sources told Reuters at the time.

Luxury insiders say the label – known for its iconic GG belts, crossbody bags and horsebit loafers – has struggled to regain ground since it pulled back on marketing investments during the pandemic. Meanwhile, Vuitton and fellow LVMH brand Dior pushed ahead, gaining prized market share.

Louis Vuitton spent the equivalent of US$946 million on marketing investments in 2021, according to estimates from Bernstein, compared to US$518 million by Gucci.

At Christmas, Dior took over Harrods department store in London and hosted a fashion show in Egypt with the pyramids as a backdrop, while Louis Vuitton’s January catwalk presentation featured a performance from Latin Grammy award winning pop-star Rosalia

LVMH does not break down sales for its brands, but its fashion and leather goods division, which is also home to Fendi and Givenchy, grew sales by 10 per cent in the fourth quarter, though it too suffered from a surge in China’s covid infections.

Meanwhile, at Louis Vuitton …

Louis Vuitton exceeded 20 billion euros in revenue for the first time, almost double that of Gucci in 2022, and the label has just scored a major coup by hiring rapper Pharrell Williams as its new menswear creative director. Gucci, meanwhile, went for the relatively unknown 39-year old De Sarno , previously at Valentino.

Well-known outside the fashion world, Williams’ debut runway show is scheduled for June.

After falling 4 per cent after Kering announced its results on Wednesday, the group’s shares have since recovered to a level not seen in almost a year as Pinault’s commitment to put Gucci back on track reassures investors.

“Investor sentiment is turning less negative and rightly looking ahead to potential improvements at Gucci underpinned by new creative direction,” said RBC Capital Markets analyst Piral Dadhania."
"LVMH Is Rumored to Acquire Cartier's Parent Company, Richemont - Yahoo Sports","Tue, 28 Feb 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vc3BvcnRzLnlhaG9vLmNvbS9sdm1oLXJ1bW9yZWQtYWNxdWlyZS1jYXJ0aWVycy1wYXJlbnQtMTgzMDI1MTI5Lmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"It's been reported that LVMH is looking to acquire Richemont.

The Switzerland-based luxury goods holding company is parent to Cartier, Chloé, Montblanc, IWC, A. Lange & Söhne, Van Cleef & Arpels, Jaeger-LeCoultre, Panerai, Piaget and Vacheron Constantin in addition to retail platforms under YOOX Net-a-Porter Group.

Swiss newspaper Finanz und Wirtschaft, was the first to report on the news, claiming that there were ""whispers behind closed doors.""

LVMH is led by Bernard Arnault. He is reportedly set on adding Cartier to LVMH's growing portfolio as a way to help grow its jewelry segment. In 2021, LVMH acquired Tiffany & Co.

Richemont was founded by South African businessman Johann Rupert in 1988. Since then, his family has held a controlling stake. In a previous interview, Rupert got candid about the dynamic of the company. ""Our board may be slower and more conservative than others. But its openness and collegiality are exactly its advantage.

Daniel Roth Watch Brand To Return Under LVMH's La Fabrique du Temps Swiss Manufacture - aBlogtoWatch,"Thu, 23 Feb 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFibG9ndG93YXRjaC5jb20vZGFuaWVsLXJvdGgtd2F0Y2gtYnJhbmQtdG8tcmV0dXJuLXVuZGVyLWx2bWhzLWxhLWZhYnJpcXVlLWR1LXRlbXBzLXN3aXNzLW1hbnVmYWN0dXJlL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"French LVMH made the surprising announcement today that the world’s biggest luxury group is due to revive the Daniel Roth watchmaking brand in 2023. LVMH is mostly known for acquiring existing companies currently in operation (especially in the horological space), so this news is somewhat surprising — and it’s also exciting for timepiece collectors. LVMH has announced the return of the Daniel Roth brand under the aegis and management of La Fabrique du Temps, a company in Geneva, wholly owned by LVMH, whose main operation continues to be the production of Louis Vuitton-branded timepieces. Daniel Roth himself hasn’t had a relationship with his eponymous brand for some time. Daniel Roth and his family continue to produce small-production batches of timepieces under the Jean Daniel Nicolas brand name.

The Daniel Roth brand was first purchased from Mr. Roth by the company that operates The Hour Glass watch retailers (mostly in Singapore and Asia). It was then later acquired by Bulgari (along with the Gerald Genta brand) in 2010. For a while, Bulgari produced dual-branded watches with the Daniel Roth name on the dial. Bulgari eventually decided to focus entirely on its own brand name, and the Daniel Roth case designs and name were put into hibernation. In 2011, LVMH acquired a controlling share of Bulgari, and this is how it ended up with the Daniel Roth name. The decision to have new Daniel Roth watches produced at La Fabrique du Temps makes perfect sense, as it specializes in exotic high-complication watches and tourbillons. For the time being, it seems that most Daniel Roth watches will be decidedly high-end with a focus on tourbillons and other fancy mechanical animations. LVMH has clarified that no more than “a few hundred watches a year” will be produced under the Daniel Roth name. The first new Daniel Roth watch will be a 20-piece limited edition that will arrive later in 2023.

Advertising Message

No dedicated managers for the Daniel Roth brand have been announced, thus far. For the time being, LVMH has explained that La Fabrique du Temps founders Michel Navas and Enrico Barbasini will oversee operations for the Daniel Roth brand, but they are both busy people who also have to run the larger factory and see to the production of Louis Vuitton watches. I visited the facility in 2022 and can attest to its impressive nature and high degree of professionalism. It seems likely that a dedicated CEO and management team for Daniel Roth will be appointed in the coming months.

What will the new Daniel Roth watches be like? My suspicion is that 2023 Daniel Roth watches will look very similar to previous-generation Daniel Roth watches from before 2010. This includes the distinctive case shape, dial designs, and mechanical complications. We can only guess what future Daniel Roth models will look like, but I think a major emphasis will be to maintain the round/rectangular case shape for the years to come. Going back to his earlier career, Daniel Roth was credited for giving shape to today’s Breguet wristwatch brand. In the 1980s, he was responsible for translating historic Breguet pocket watches into modern wristwatches. Much of what Mr. Roth did in the 1980s still defines the look and feel of Breguet watches today; he is known for both his aptitude as a watchmaker and his skill in artistic design.

LVMH is clearly leaning on Mr. Roth’s status and legacy to help propel interest in the relaunched Daniel Roth brand. Does that mean Mr. Roth himself will have some involvement in the relaunched brand? That is unclear. But it’s evident that LMVH is looking to specifically revive the passion for existing Daniel Roth watch visuals and styles, which requires a look at Mr. Roth himself, his work, and the last 30 or so years of history. I am excited to learn more about what LVMH has in mind for Daniel Roth, and exactly how the very capable people at La Fabrique du Temps will carve out space to run what could be a dynamic name in the brand’s current portfolio of ultra-high-end watchmaking products.

LVMH Hospitality Excellence belongs to the world’s leading luxury group LVMH Moët Hennessy -Louis Vuitton.

The LVMH brand Belmond will manage the Hotel Romazzino, which will open for the 2024 season as the “Romazzino, A Belmond Hotel, Costa Smeralda.”

The Hotel Pitrizza will be managed by the LVMH brand Cheval Blanc. The hotel will continue to operate under its current name until 2026, when it will be rebranded as Cheval Blanc Pitrizza, Costa Smeralda, following the completion of the renovation works.

These changes are part of the Smeralda Holding Group’s long-term strategy to enhance and enrich Costa Smeralda as a best-in-class destination. This plan was launched in 2017 and includes, among others, tourism initiatives, the introduction of major F&B operators such as Nikki Beach, Zuma, Novikov, Beefbar and Matsuhisa and many more, while aligning with the unique character and heritage of the destination.

This new partnership will aim to bring further value to the local community, by bringing increased employment and development opportunities for staff. All employees will remain employed by Sardegna Resorts S.r.l., which will also retain ownership of the hotels’ property and businesses.

Through these agreements, LVMH intends to further strengthen its lead in experiential luxury with two new exceptional destinations in Sardegna that will benefit from all the know-how and expertise of the Belmond and Cheval Blanc brands. The two hotels will benefit from renovations allowing Belmond and Cheval Blanc to offer their future clients two new destinations in the heart of Sardegna, which is renowned for its dynamism, heritage, and exceptional landscapes.

Both hotels are located in the heart of Costa Smeralda and were designed in the 1960s by the architects Luigi Vietti and Michele Busiri Vici – who both contributed to the development of Porto Cervo. They both boast spectacular views facing pristine Mediterranean waters and celebrate the heritage of the region.

(IDEX Online) - The French luxury conglomerate LVMH is reported to be considering a possible takeover of its Swiss rival Richemont, owner of Cartier, the world's second-largest watchmaking brand.







Bernard Arnault, LVMH chairman and CEO - and currently the world's richest person - is eyeing the empire founded by South African businessman Johann Rupert in 1988, according to the Swiss newspaper Finanz und Wirtschaft. Rupert is said to oppose such a deal.





The newspaper says (translated from German): ""It's still little more than a whisper. But in the luxury industry, there is whispered talk that Bernard Arnault â€¦ wants to take over Swiss competitor Richemont.





""More specifically, he is said to be targeting Richemont's industry-leading jewelry brand, Cartier.""





LVMH finally added Tiffany & Co to its list of 75 maisons in January 2021, after protracted negotiations and legal moves. It paid $15.8bn.





Adding Cartier - second only to Rolex - to its portfolio, would increase its dominance in the jewelry sector.





Richemont controls 26 maisons, among them Chloe, Montblanc, IWC, A. Lange & Sohne, Van Cleef & Arpels, Jaeger-LeCoultre, Panerai, Piaget and Vacheron Constantin.

Daigou is a Chinese term for an individual purchasing commodities outside China for consumers at home while making a profit due to the country’s high import tariffs, and has now developed into a booming industry. Since it started in 2005, Daigou has been highly favoured by Chinese consumers, especially when it comes to luxury products and cosmetics goods by foreign brands. The market share of Daigou in China garnered a whopping 75 billion RMB ($11.16 billion) in 2014, representing almost half of the luxury storefront sales nationwide.

According to the 2022 financial results published by LVMH, its total revenue witnessed a 23% yearly increase, with the perfumes and cosmetics sector growing by 17%, becoming the driving force of the conglomerate’s business. China has a great appetite for luxury goods and the demand for Daigou is particularly high in the beauty and cosmetics markets.

This move by LVMH may bring a downturn in its sales, and as such, the Chief Financial Officer of LVMH, Jean Jacques Guiony referred to this decision as “costly and a challenge, while a right move over time will keep our brands attractive.”

There are two explanations as to how this Daigou crackdown has come to be. First and foremost, on China’s e-retailer Taobao, product prices of high-end beauty brands showcased noticeable differences between the boutique display and Daigou’s channel, with the latter being much cheaper.

Additionally, Daigou shoppers have a bad reputation for hoarding and stockpiling goods in large quantities, infuriating local consumers because of the shortage of products. Some surrogate buyers even sell defective cosmetics for profit which largely damages the brand’s image and results in poor user experiences.

Despite the above, Jean Jacques Guiony expressed optimism towards the Chinese market regarding its sales in future and the country’s ongoing retail market rebound. In fact, he believes that slamming Daigou will not actually hit the conglomerate’s sales sharply, “local consumers now have more options to purchase high-end products in mainland China than before”, like the bourgeoning duty-free market in Hainan.

LVMH Kicks Off Recruitment Tour With Tony Parker in Paris - Yahoo! Voices,"Wed, 15 Feb 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnlhaG9vLmNvbS9uZXdzL2x2bWgta2lja3Mtb2ZmLXJlY3J1aXRtZW50LXRvdXItMjAwODIxMTAyLmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS — LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton kicked off its five-city “You and Me” recruitment roadshow to attract young people into the luxury professions, with an opening exposition at Paris’ Palais Brongniart.

For good measure, there was a “rock star” of sorts, with Tony Parker on hand to sign autographs and take selfies with young fans. The basketball star spoke from the main stage and emphasized that the métiers d’art are “not reserved for the elite.”

More from WWD

Parker’s Lyon-based Adequat Academy has long partnered with LVMH to offer alternate career paths to student athletes who excel in their sport but might not make it to the big leagues. Parker frames it as helping kids “create another passion” and have additional opportunities.

“A lot of kids have no idea they can work with Dior, think it’s too high or you have to have a great degree. Knowing that and seeing the kids with stars in their eyes, like, ‘Wow, can I really work at a place like that?’ So that’s our job, to expose them to possibilities and knowledge,” he told WWD.

Students excitedly buzzed around, watching demonstrations from artisans and couturiers representing brands including Celine, Dior, and Louis Vuitton.

The morning recruitment session was focused on students from 13 to 18 years old, and welcomed more than 2,100 people throughout the day-long event.

“It’s a difficult age when you have to face difficult questions about what you want to do in life,” said Chantal Gaemperle, LVMH Group executive vice president of human resources and synergies. “So we believe in bringing concrete solutions, and bringing in people that those young people can relate to, identify with, that can open up their minds and give them a perspective they didn’t have before.”

Inside the fair the company gamified the floor plan to better appeal to the young crowd. QR codes led guests through the different displays, while a quiz could be completed at the end for a spot on the scoreboard. They also used VR headsets in an interactive display to walk potential recruits through a factory floor.

Gaemperle said the biggest challenges of recruitment are that many young people who are growing up with screens haven’t heard of handicrafts and don’t have an understanding of what an artisan is. Another challenge is that students often come in saying they want to be a fashion designer, but don’t understand all the behind-the-scenes work that goes into creating couture or a bag. The program aims to expand their understanding of luxury brands, what Gaemperle calls “awakening vocation.” Students leave with new ideas of what might be possible for them, she added.

More than just a display of luxury brands, there were booths from the French government employment department and a particularly popular section for seminars on how to prepare job applications, as well as one-on-one coaching from counselors on how to prepare a résumé.

This year the company also developed an app so that interested parties can fill out questionnaires, do online tests and help them establish their job profiles.

Gaemperle emphasized that the company recruits from all ages, including older workers looking to retrain in long-term handicraft careers.

“We are looking at a diverse, broad base because what we need is skilled people,” she said. “Basically the success of our group, we often say, is built on the talents first of all and the craftsmanship that we have.”

As luxury continues its unabated growth, LVMH and other houses have plenty of positions to fill. The program has more than doubled its capacity from 1,200 last year to 3,500 positions to recruit in France, particularly in serving those high-end clients. More than 2,000 client-experience slots need to be filled, more than 460 artisans are needed as well as 85 in creative positions. Nine hundred internships are available, including 190 artisans and 150 in creatives.

Filling those client-facing positions is of utmost importance right now, added Gaemperle. These jobs are typically undervalued, she said, and they are working to give a greater focus on these positions, particularly as retail must add customer service in a competitive, omnichannel world.

“In this context, the client-facing jobs become only more and more important,” she said, noting that pandemic changes created a “disaffection” for careers in retail. However, human interaction and brand story are the core of the company.

“If you are a client you want to find the right reason to physically go to a store, you want to live an exceptional experience. We have developed luxury retail [as] the art of welcoming clients and the art of being able to tell a story, to understand the products, origins, how it has been made. So we put a lot of emphasis on these careers.”

For his part, Parker encourages kids to dream big. “If you tell your dream to somebody and they’re not laughing at you, you aren’t dreaming big enough,” he joked. Parker relayed the story of a student who recently said he hopes to be the chief executive officer of Dior one day. “Everyone in the room — like 800 people — was laughing but I was like, great. I hope I can inspire a whole generation of kids who want to be in those positions and dream big.”

The appointment of music artist Pharrell Williams as the new creative director of Louis Vuitton’s men’s division is a great example of dreaming big, Parker said. “It just shows how creative this house is and they’re not afraid to take a risk. You never know what will happen,” he said. “It’s not going to be easy to go after Virgil Abloh, so it’s a pretty big deal.”

Parker is set to open a second academy outside of Paris in 2025. The new school will repurpose facilities built for the 2024 Olympic Games, a situation that will be a win-win for the region as well as the academy. He will be partnering with LVMH again on the project, which will have a complementary curriculum to his school in Lyon. Parker added that he is carefully considering expanding his educational facilities.

“We have propositions in Africa and in China, who want to use our concept and everything that we have created with this academy. We have offers on the table,” he said. “But for me it is about choosing the right partners that can grow and make it last for a lot of years.”

The “You and Me” tour will hit Reims on March 3; Orleans March 7; Clichy-Sous-Bois March 15, and finish in Lyon on March 29.

While not strictly part of the “You and Me” program, LVMH has started similar recruitment in other regions. Gaemperle noted that in the U.S., they integrated the first apprentice classes for Tiffany & Co., which tripled registration in one year. That initiative, as well as others in six countries, are being implemented to support the overall global need to fill 15,200 positions in 2023.

is moving up a gear. 's star house has finally found a successor to Virgil Abloh to head the men's collections, which have been without a creative director since the death of the iconic American designer in November 2021. American pop star Pharrell Williams will take over. With his eclectic profile as a musician, author, performer, producer and stylist, his appointment marks a change of tempo for the house, which is more than ever committed to the lifestyle field. This is a bold move from the new CEO , as he takes the group's powerhouse to its next stage.







The brand reached 20 billion euros in sales - ph Viviane Sassen Louis Vuitton



Succeeding , the Italian manager has just left Dior to take over the reins of Louis Vuitton at the beginning of February. It is, obviously, a well-oiled machine that has inherited. As , the head of LVMH, proudly proclaimed at the end of January when he published the annual results for 2022: ""for the first time, Louis Vuitton will exceed 20 billion euros in turnover"". In just four years, the star brand of the French luxury group has doubled its sales, with record profitability, despite the coronavirus pandemic. Thanks to a well-honed strategy, constant diversification, a vast network of directly operated shops and global communication, it has all the assets in hand to begin a promising new chapter.



According to Bernstein's estimates, the label's sales will be close to 22 billion euros, while its operating profit (Ebit) will rise to more than 10 billion in 2022 with a margin close to 50%. Today, it has 33,000 employees worldwide and plans to recruit 9,000 new staff within three years.

It has 460 shops in around 60 countries, including France, South Korea, Japan and the United States. As for production, it relies on 19 workshops in France and three sites in Italy, including a shoe factory.





""The luxury label par excellence""





The secret of his success? ""It depends largely on the scale of the business. Luxury is a fixed cost business. The bigger a brand is, the more it can spend on doing things right: more beautiful boutiques, more communication, more prestigious initiatives. Success also depends on impeccable price and distribution management, exclusive retail, totally banning outlets, discounts and promotions. The combination of all these variables converge to make Louis Vuitton the luxury brand par excellence,"" summarises , head of the luxury sector for Bernstein.



According to estimates, Louis Vuitton has nearly 90 million customers worldwide. Omnipresent throughout the year with each new campaign and new products, the brand benefits from unrivalled media firepower, as shown by its current operation on all fronts (shops, advertising, social networks, etc.) for the launch of its collaboration with the Japanese artist , including high-impact installations in the main luxury cities. Another example was the concert by Catalan star Rosalia, organised in January in the Cour Carrée of the Louvre in Paris to unveil its men's collection.



""It's a multidimensional brand. The trunk maker was first created around the world of travel, then around the art of living. It is now developed in all segments, and each time it diversifies, it makes a point of being the best in everything"", underlines Yves Hanania, founder of the consultancy firm Lighthouse and co-author of the book 'Le luxe contre-attaque, accélérations et disruptions' (Dunod edition). Starting with its historical reputation and its recognisable logo with the initials LV intertwined, Louis Vuitton has been able to build a coherent universe over time, created step by step, becoming the leading luxury brand in the world.

We tend to forget it, but the diversification of the house founded in 1854 is recent compared to its long history. For example, the company has only just entered the children's clothing market with its very first baby collection, which will be launched in early March. After travel and leather goods, the first real foray into fashion came with ready-to-wear, launched in 1997 by . From then on, the range gradually expanded to include accessories such as watches (2002), eyewear (2005), jewellery (2009) and perfumes made in-house (2016).



Over the years, the brand has extended its universe to lifestyle with its very first furniture collection created in 2012, calling on the most prestigious international designers. This was followed by tableware and lifestyle, stationery, technological objects and more. While cultivating its expertise in travel, also through publications, such as its famous ""City Guides"" initiated in 1998, Louis Vuitton continues to explore new areas. In particular, gastronomy via the restaurants opened in Osaka and Tokyo in Japan between 2020 and 2021, the ones entrusted to starred chefs last year in Saint-Tropez or Seoul, the pop-up tea room tested in its Lille boutique or the ephemeral café and chocolate shop installed in 2022 in the LV Dream space, within its Paris headquarters.



As LVMH CEO Bernard Arnault reminded us last year when the group published its 2021 annual results, Louis Vuitton is ""more than a fashion company"". ""It is a creative cultural company that reaches a very large customer base, from the youngest, with Gen Z, to more mature customers. A culture brand with a global audience, something completely different to what you see in fashion. An image accentuated by the artistic activities of the Louis Vuitton Foundation, created in 2006, and the brand's countless collaborations with the art world.





Creating rarity and controlling distribution





But behind this cultural image and its broad scope, Louis Vuitton is also and above all a war machine with a powerful commercial strategy and logistics. ""Louis Vuitton has a wider and more creative assortment than its competitors, with a very rapid renewal of its collections, but never in large volumes. This requires very precise stock management. They know how to manage rarity. This gives a dynamic and a desirability"", explains Yves Hanania. ""In short, the brand offers more models, but in smaller quantities of products, all of which are aimed at different customer groups with a wide range of prices.""



Another crucial element is the direct sales network, of which Louis Vuitton has full control. ""They have different formats, from flagship stores of impressive size to single-product shops, which cover the different geographical areas of luxury very well, often benefiting from access to the best locations,"" notes the consultant. This of course allows the label to manage its price positioning as closely as possible, activating the lever of increases according to the destinations. ""Beyond the product, the label also offers a service and high-end experiences targeted for each segment by multiplying the points of entry,"" he continues.

Louis Vuitton shops stand out thanks to their ultra-personalized welcome and service. The brand has been a pioneer in customer care, with sophisticated and integrated customer relationship management at the global level.



Speaking of the brand's clientele, Bernard Arnault recalled in January that they were ""largely loyal customers who come back"", and that the company has a habit of ""prioritising customer service"". In particular, Louis Vuitton has been able to manage its local clientele, which has helped it to resist during the pandemic, faced with a decline in tourism, notably rich tourists from Asia and Russia.





Pharrell Williams, Virgil Abloh's successor





For Pietro Beccari the new head of LVMH's flagship house, 2023 will not be without challenges. He has just taken up the first one by appointing Pharrell Williams to head the men's collections. The executive and the rapper have known each other for about ten years. The singer-songwriter, who is also a fashion entrepreneur with two streetwear labels, has collaborated with Louis Vuitton in the past, in 2004 and 2008, notably when the manager was executive vice-president of marketing and communication at Louis Vuitton.



Pharrell Williams was also a close friend of Virgil Abloh and is well known in the luxury world. In fact, he was spotted in January in the front row of the Kenzo show (another LVMH house). Above all, he has multiplied his collaborations in recent years, notably with Adidas, Chanel, Uniqlo and Moncler, of which he will be one of the stars at the Genius event in London on February 20. This appointment marks the first major move on the part of Pietro Beccari, taking the brand resolutely into a new dimension. A decision that could have repercussions on the women's collections, which have been entrusted to the expert hands of for the past ten years. Could it be that Louis Vuitton is taking this time to consider a change of creative direction for the women's ready-to-wear?



For the rest, the new boss will not fail to expand into new areas of work. As his predecessor recently hinted, the next step could well be the opening of a first Louis Vuitton hotel at the address of its Paris offices, opposite the Samaritaine. ""The brand has been shaped over the past decades to accompany the lives of its wealthy customers. So what could be more natural than to think of a hotel and why not a tailor-made travel agency in line with the history of Louis Vuitton?"" suggests Yves Hanania, betting on the house's as yet unspoken potential. ""The power of a brand, when it is well managed and nurtured, has no limits,"" he concludes."
LVMH-backed Private Equity Firm L Catterton in Talks to Acquire APC - WWD,"Fri, 03 Feb 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3dkLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy1uZXdzL21lcmdlcnMtYWNxdWlzaXRpb25zL2x2bWgtbC1jYXR0ZXJ0b24taW4tdGFsa3MtdG8tYWNxdWlyZS1hLXAtYy0xMjM1NTA3NTk5L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS — French American private equity giant L Catterton is in talks to acquire ready-to-wear brand A.P.C., sources confirmed to WWD.

The French denim stalwart founded by Jean Touitou in 1987 enlisted investment bank Rothschild & Co. to seek a buyer back in December.

A.P.C. has 80 corporate-owned stores and is present in 350 multibrand brand doors around the world. In 2021, the company’s turnover was 82 million euros. Based on those turnover numbers, the valuation would be in the $100 million to $150 million range.

The U.S.-headquartered L Catterton was formed in 2016 when consumer specialist Catterton joined forces with LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton chief executive officer Bernard Arnault’s Groupe Arnault. The resulting company bills itself as “the largest, diversified consumer-dedicated private equity firm in the world,” and has its fingers in several fashion pies.

The investment company made a strategic investment in Danish brand Ganni in 2017, which was reported to be on the block for $700 million in June 2022. At the time, the firm hired French bank Lazard to handle the sale process, which was said to attract interest from Chinese buyers. No deal has been announced.

It invested in French outerwear brand Jott in 2021, and in two years doubled the company’s turnover to 150 million euros. It took a majority stake in Italian brand Etro the same year, in a deal valued at 500 million euros.

L Catterton’s fashion investments have included ba&sh, Birkenstock, Charles & Keith, Everlane, Gant, Gentle Monster, Halston Apparel Group Inc., Pepe Jeans, Savage x Fenty, Sandro and Maje parent company SMCP, and more.

L Catterton offloaded its stake in French contemporary brand ba&sh to investment group HLD in March 2022. The investment group had invested in the company in 2015. During that time it embarked upon an aggressive global expansion strategy, adding 200 points of sale in six years.

The private equity giant enlisted Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley to explore an initial public offering with a valuation of $3 billion to $4 billion in February 2022 but the IPO never materialized given the turmoil in global stock markets last year and into 2023."

Nicola Mira Published

Feb 17, 2023

The Prize is celebrating its 10th anniversary, once more confirming its importance in the fashion landscape. The emerging fashion designer competition was launched in 2014 by the world’s number one luxury group and, for its 2023 edition, it received over 2,400 entries from around the world, compared to 1,900 last year, and has selected 22 semi-finalist labels (two more than in previous editions) hailing from 15 countries.







The designers of the 22 semi-finalist labels - Prix LVMH



For the first time, the LVMH Prize’s long-list features a Brazilian designer, London-based Joao Maraschin, as well as a Jamaican designer, Rachel Scott, with her Diotima label. New York-based Scott will be showing her collection at , before joining the other young talents who have been picked for the semi-final in Paris. Their creations will be presented on March 2 and 3 at a physical showroom, and from March 1 to 5 in digital format on the LVMH Prize website, where the public will be given the opportunity, for the third consecutive year, to vote for their favourite candidate. This vote will count for one, and will be added to the votes of some one hundred industry experts.



Several names that have already caught the eye in the world’s fashion capitals feature among the semi-finalists. Like Dominican-American designer Raul Lopez, a rising star on the New York fashion scene with his label Luar and the it-bag Ana, adored by celebrities. Lopez is by no means a rookie: in the 2000s, he co-founded one of the first luxury streetwear labels, . New York-based label Karu Research, founded in 2021 by Indian designer Kartik Kumra, is also quite successful. British designer Charlie Constantinou won the 2022 edition of the prestigious emerging designer competition held in Trieste, Italy. Japanese designer won the Hyères Festival in 2016, while Paolina Russo is a finalist of the 2023 . The Canadian designer launched her eponymous label in 2020, and was joined in 2022 by French stylist Lucile Guilmard.

Giseok Cho, from South Korea, first made a name for himself as an artist-photographer before launching his Kusikohc label. Italian Luca has been showing in Milan since 2019. His compatriot Veronica Leoni, with her label Quira, has also made a name for herself in recent years in Milan and New York. The Marrknull label by Chinese duo Wei Wang and Tian Shi regularly shows in London. Namesake, a Taipei-based label launched by three Taiwanese brothers, Michael, Richard and Steve Hsieh, caught the eye with a few presentations in Paris, as did Korean designer Juntae Kim.



Two French designers have been selected for this edition’s semi-final: Turkey-born Burc Akyol, a former atelier designer at , and Ungaro, and Anne Isabella, born in Denmark and based in Berlin. The semi-final line-up also includes Aaron Esh (UK), Johanna Parv (from Estonia, based in London), Louis Shengtao Chen (China), Bettter by Julie Pelipas (Ukraine), Bloke by Oluwajimi (Nigeria), Setchu by Satoshi Kuwata (Japan), and Stinarand by Stina Randestad (Sweden).





Winner will pocket €300,000





Only eight among the long-list of labels will be selected for the final. Their names will be revealed in March, and the 2023 LVMH Prize will be formally awarded a few months later. The LVMH Prize winner will receive a €300,000 cash prize, and the winner of the special prize will receive €150,000. In both cases, the winners will benefit from a one-year mentoring by the luxury group’s staff. LVMH will also distinguish, as usual, three recent fashion academy graduates. Applications are open for them until March 19, 2023.



“The 22 semi-finalists are all driven by a very innovative vision and also show great creative maturity in their work. Many of them place the culture and craftsmanship of their native country at the heart of their design approach. Eco-responsibility is also a major value for them, as they use innovative or recycled materials and embrace a more localised and ethical production system. The fluidity between menswear and womenswear is another key feature this year, since no fewer than nine designers have created genderless collections,” said , the originator of the LVMH Prize, who is expecting “an exceptional 2023 edition.”"

The goal of the initiative is to raise awareness around the importance of Italian craftsmanship and its preservation; develop media attention to the cause, and offer financial aid to some of its exponents.

The award is reserved for Italian artisans and companies that have been in operation for at least 12 months in sectors encompassing textiles, clothing, footwear, tailoring, eyewear, jewelry and fashion product components. Applications for the awards will open Wednesday on a dedicated website.

Candidates can apply for just one of the three categories available. One is “Maestro Artigiano d’Eccellenza,” dedicated to expert craftsmen and firms with at least five years of experience and that stand out for their quality as well as commitment to develop and pass down their know-how. The “Maestro Artigiano Emergente d’Eccellenza” award is reserved for emerging talents with a promising artisanal project developed at least five years before the application. The third, “Maestro Dell’Innovazione d’Eccellenza,” is aimed at companies and professionals innovating and reinterpreting traditional crafts in a modern way.

Applications can be submitted until May 14, when a jury will start reviewing them and select three finalists for each category over the summer. To be revealed during a special event in September, the final three winners will receive a money prize of 10,000 euros, media coverage and mentoring sessions with Fendi professionals.

The project was teased in November, when LVMH hosted the Show Me event here and said that each year a different group brand will partner with the Italian fashion chamber to acknowledge three master artisans, starting with Fendi.

On Tuesday, Fendi’s president and chief executive officer Serge Brunschwig underscored the importance of the project from a communication point of view, highlighting the need for “publicly acknowledging” these crafts.

This approach is not new for Fendi, as the brand has previously implemented the “Hand in Hand” initiative, among others. First launched in 2020, the project aims to spotlight Italian craftsmanship by tapping local artisans to reinvent the iconic Baguette bag that Fendi’s artistic director for accessories and menswear Silvia Venturini Fendi designed in 1997.

As part of “Hand in Hand,” the company opened the doors of its Roman headquarters Palazzo della Civiltà Italiana to the public for an exhibition showcasing 20 one-of-a-kind Fendi Baguette bags that Venturini Fendi developed in collaboration with 20 ateliers and workshops. Each of these was located in an Italian region, from Trentino Alto Adige and Valle d’Aosta to Calabria and Sicily. Last year, the brand also released a tome further spotlighting the collaborations.

“Craftsmanship must be defended, shown, communicated and we need to ensure it continues too,” said Brunschwig, pointing to the shortage of skilled workers in these fields.

“If companies’ sales grow, that means that the load of work grows as well,” he continued, noting the need not only to replace a generation approaching retirement age but adding new hires. “There isn’t this workforce in Italy, due to low natality levels but also to generations opting for classic education rather than technical ones.”

To this end, Fendi is among the LVMH-controlled brands involved in an initiative aimed at implementing educational programs at middle schools, to inform young students about the career opportunities of artisanal jobs as much as changing their parents’ perception toward these roles.

For example, in a year the French group’s Excellent program geared toward teenagers raised awareness about these jobs among 700 middle school students in Italy thanks to collaborations with brands such as Bulgari, Berluti, Celine, Dior and Loro Piana, in addition to Fendi.

“But what we do is a drop in the ocean. The next step has to be at institutional levels,” Brunschwig said. “We need to see how we can scale up this approach, and not only for the luxury industry. There are plenty of fields here in Italy [that can benefit from it], from automotive to hospitality,” he added.

For example, the CEO said the state-of-the-art accessories plant opened in Bagno a Ripoli, a 30-minute drive from Florence, would have the capacity to accommodate a 700-person workforce but there’s still a vacancy for 300 workers.

“Yet the case of the entire supply chain is even more important compared to our direct employment,” Brunschwig said. He noted that while Fendi and LVMH have the financial and reputational resources to attract people and train them in-house, the case is different for smaller-sized companies that act as the brand’s partners and suppliers and are still pivotal for Fendi. “So the real challenge is to ensure the whole supply chain has skilled workers,” the executive said.

Confartigianato’s president Marco Granelli shared that there will be more than 43,000 worker vacancies this year in the fashion sector alone. Alexandre Boquel, head of development for the LVMH Métiers d’Excellence division, underscored that the French luxury group is looking to hire more than 2,000 workers in Italy by the end of 2024.

Boquel highlighted that the group feels the duty to “enhance what makes this country unique” with a project like the “Maestri d’Eccellenza” award, especially given that the country is home to six of its brands — including Bulgari, Acqua di Parma, Loro Piana, Emilio Pucci and Cova, in addition to Fendi.

In Italy, LVMH employs 13,300 people across these brands, counts more than 250 stores, eight Belmond luxury hotels and 31 manufacturing sites. These add to an ecosystem of partners, involving around 5,000 small to medium-sized companies that employ more than 200,000 people.

Camera della Moda’s president Carlo Capasa also urged the need to attract new talent, especially in light of the industry’s positive performance. According to the preliminary figures, in the first 11 months of 2022 sales of the fashion and related industries (including textiles, clothing, leather goods, footwear, jewelry, eyewear and cosmetics) grew 18 percent to 98.3 billion euros compared to the same period in 2021.

“The recovery of the fashion industry after COVID-19 has been unexpected and important,” noted Capasa, who forecast sales of the overall sector will reach more than 102 billion euros, up 4 percent compared to the previous year.

“These first months of the year are showing that things are going well and fashion is in a healthy shape. We’re growing but there are challenges,” said Capasa, who added that, according to the Italian fashion chamber, vacancies of skilled workers in the industry will reach around 90,000 people in the next three years.

Communication is key for him as well, as Capasa suggested introducing an hour per week at middle schools dedicated to Made in Italy to educate students about the importance of quality and crafts.

“We have to defend the value of creativity,” he urged. “If we switch creativity with marketing, the whole paradigm changes. We shift from ‘creating a dream’ to ‘satisfy a need,’” he concluded."
"LVMH, L'Oréal, Shiseido Eye Stake In Aesop. Can The Clean Beauty Brand Crack China? - Jing Daily","Wed, 01 Feb 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vamluZ2RhaWx5LmNvbS9wb3N0cy9sdm1oLWxvcmVhbC1zaGlzZWlkby1zdGFrZS1pbi1hZXNvcNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"What happened

Brazil’s Natura & Co., parent company of Australian cruelty-free brand Aesop, is working with Bank of America and Morgan Stanley to explore the sale of a stake in the luxury fragrance and bath brand. Notably, a deal could put a value of 2 billion (13.5 billion RMB) on Aesop, according to Bloomberg .

The sought-after premium beauty label has attracted the attention of French conglomerates LVMH and L’Oréal, as well as Japanese group Shiseido, all of which have reportedly bid for a stake in the business. A deal has yet to be reached.

Sao Paulo-based Natura & Co. revealed back in October 2022 that it was assessing options to unlock Aesop’s value, including a potential IPO, or spinoff, to improve company profitability.

The Jing Take

When it first entered China in 2018, ​​the B Corp-certified label experienced a bumpy ride. Due to local regulations on animal testing, Aesop could only sell to China through cross-border e-commerce trade via Tmall. Then, in May 2021, China’s government lifted the animal testing requirements for imported beauty products, which enabled the clean beauty brand to expand offline. In November last year, it opened its first mainland brick-and-mortar store — a 308-square-meter space occupying a two-story building in Shanghai's Dongping Road. Another store in Shanghai is on the way.

Aesop’s rapid expansion is indicative of the vast demand in China for beauty products made from natural ingredients. According to Mintel’s latest study on China’s beauty market, 77 percent of participants believe that healthy or clean products are safer than ordinary versions, and over 60 percent think they are more effective, putting the mainland ahead of other major markets in terms of demand.

With consumer awareness expanding, the comparatively less crowded clean beauty race looks highly promising from a business perspective. No wonder some of the world’s leading cosmetics giants are jostling to take a stake in Aesop.

Such a move would likely be beneficial for both parties. In China, being clean and cruelty-free is not enough to compete against local and international rivals and meet domestic consumers’ sophisticated demands — any new entrant would require the support of experienced teams to navigate China’s unique market dynamics.

Nicola Bulgari Convicted for Insider Trading on LVMH Shares - Yahoo Finance,"Wed, 15 Feb 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9uaWNvbGEtYnVsZ2FyaS1jb252aWN0ZWQtaW5zaWRlci10cmFkaW5nLTE3NTg0OTUxMy5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS — Nicola Bulgari, former executive of Roman luxury house Bulgari, and his asset management firm Tara were convicted on Tuesday of insider trading, according to French news agency AFP.

More from WWD

As part of a prior admission of guilt procedure with the French national financial prosecution service, Bulgari and Tara were sentenced to fines of 1.2 million euros and 5.5 million euros, respectively. The former Bulgari co-owner was also handed a nine-month suspended jail sentence. Both sentences were approved by a judge of Paris’ judicial court.

The Roman jeweler’s former executive and the management company stood accused of benefiting from transactions effected on LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton shares in 2016. The French luxury conglomerate had taken a majority stake in Bulgari from its founding family in 2011, in a cash-and-share transaction with a total value of more than $6 billion.

According to the AFP’s report, Nicola Bulgari and Tara purchased respectively 20,000 and 82,600 shares of the French luxury group between July 6 and 18 of that year, which were then sold on July 27, the day after LVMH announced first-half results that led to a rise in its share price.

The gains had been 292,400 euros for him personally and 1.4 million euros for the asset management company.

The luxury group said it had recorded 17.2 billion euros for the first half of 2016, with a year-over-year organic revenue growth of 4 percent. Over that period, profit from continuing operations was flat at 2.95 billion euros, or $3.3 billion. Net profit increased 8 percent to 1.71 billion euros, or $7.12 billion, WWD reported at the time.

An administrative investigation had been launched in 2017 after the transactions were spotted by France’s Financial Markets Authority, which led to a preliminary inquiry in 2019 by the financial prosecution service.

Story continues

While he initially contested the charges during his December 2021 testimony, Nicola Bulgari told the court at the sentencing hearing that he “had concluded it was time to admit the facts” after discussions with his counsel and “recognized what [he] had done, [feeling] guilty.”

While the investigation was unable to pinpoint the source of the information that led to the transactions, the “timely nature” and “unusual” operations, along with the “absence of convincing explanations” from the former Bulgari executive and “a plausible information transmission circuit” supported the insider trading charges, according to prosecutor Laurent Couderc.

Tara and Nicola Bulgari could not be reached for comment.

This week, fashion received the answer to one of its most talked-about questions, when Louis Vuitton announced that Pharrell Williams would fill Virgil Abloh‘s shoes as the new creative director of Louis Vuitton Men’s. The news, which came on Tuesday, set the internet ablaze with hot takes on what we might be able to expect from this new era at the French fashion house. (More on that, here.)

Elsewhere, the LVMH Prize announced this year’s semifinalists, with a total of 22 up-and-coming designers listed. New York Fashion Week‘s Fall/Winter 2023 shows came to a close, and showgoers jetted off to London for the next slate of presentations. Meanwhile, Supreme debuted its new storefront in Los Angeles’ West Hollywood neighborhood, and KidSuper released his official FW23 comedy show, titled “Funny Business.”

Below, Hypebeast has rounded up the top fashion stories of the week so you can stay up to date on trends in the industry.

On Tuesday, Louis Vuitton named Pharrell Williams its new Men’s creative director. The French fashion house took to Instagram to confirm previous reports, stating that Pharrell’s first collection for Louis Vuitton will be revealed next June during Men’s Fashion Week in Paris.

“Pharrell Williams is a visionary whose creative universes expand from music to art, and to fashion – establishing himself as a cultural global icon over the past twenty years,” the brand wrote on Instagram. “The way in which he breaks boundaries across the various worlds he explores, aligns with Louis Vuitton’s status as a Cultural Maison, reinforcing its values of innovation, pioneer spirit, and entrepreneurship.”

Pietro Beccari, Louis Vuitton’s Chairman and CEO, said, “I am glad to welcome Pharrell back home, after our collaborations in 2004 and 2008 for Louis Vuitton, as our new Men’s Artistic Director. His creative vision beyond fashion will undoubtedly lead Louis Vuitton towards a new and very exciting chapter.”

On Friday, the LVMH Prize revealed its 2023 semifinalists: 22 up-and-coming visionaries spanning womenswear, menswear and genderless design.

There were more than 2,400 candidates for the LVMH Prize this year, according to Arnault. The figure represents a sizable increase from last year’s 1,900, illustrating the increasing competition among emerging designers. The 2023 semifinalists come from countries across the globe, including Ukraine, Brazil, Estonia and Jamaica. Among them, three make menswear, eight do womenswear and 11 design either a blend of menswear and genderless or exclusively genderless clothing.

This year the LVMH Prize will be streamed online. The public will be able to vote alongside industry experts, including Law Roach and Gabriella Karefa-Johnson The designers’ work will be on display in a Paris showroom on March 2 and 3. Public voting will be open from March 1 to 5.

See the list of semifinalists here.

New York Fashion Week’s Fall/Winter 2023 shows officially ended this week, and globe-trotting showgoers have already landed in London for the English city’s turn. With shows and presentations from over 75 designers, spanning mainstays Willy Chavarria, Coach and Eckhaus Latta to newcomers Head of State and AKNVAS, the American leg of the fashion tour had much to showcase for the forthcoming season.

For Fall 2023, New York visionaries formed new boundaries for menswear. Skirts appeared on the runways of Who Decides War, Thom Browne and LUAR, among others, while visionaries Dion Lee and LaQuan Smith made a case for bold cuts on luxury clubwear. Shoulders shot to new heights in a bevy of looks from Chavarria, and Head of State’s Taofeek Abijako subverted traditional tailoring in men’s formalwear. Heron Preston, meanwhile, embraced high and low street styles in a manner that let his signature workwear prevail once again.

See all of Hypebeast’s coverage from the week here.

Supreme said goodbye to its Fairfax Avenue store location, where it served Los Angeles for 19 years, and waved hello to an all-new outpost in the city’s West Hollywood neighborhood.

The space — which was formerly the home of Tower Records’ West Coast flagship — is signature Supreme, with an all-white paint job and three classic box logos. Outerwear is displayed on the left side of the storefront, while T-shirts and headwear are posted up on the back wall. A black checkout counter supplies branded accessories, among art installations from creatives including Mark Gonzales, Nate Lowman, Josh Smith, Fuck This Life and Neckface.

Supreme West Hollywood is located at 8801 West Sunset Blvd., West Hollywood, CA, 90069.

During Paris Fashion Week Men’s in February, KidSuper founder Colm Dillane presented his Fall/Winter collection 2023 inside his very own comedy special, “Funny Business,” at the Casino de Paris. Now, it’s finally available for the public to watch and enjoy.

Just under 40 minutes in length, the comedy show offers a funny take on what a fashion show can become. Hosted by Tyra Banks, the showcase features a high-octane slate of KidSuper’s comedian comrades, including Jeff Ross, Yvonne Orji, Stavros Halkias, FARY and Andrew Schultz.

“We’ll see how it goes,” Dillane said before the show. “It could fully bomb. But that’s also what’s cool about some of the fashion shows I do; they’re risky.”

Gucci revealed its SS23 “Twinsburg” campaign, spotlighting pieces from its double-take-worthy runway in September.

With Art Direction from Christopher Simmonds and photography courtesy of Joanna Piotrowska, the Italian fashion house takes over a massive villa with an army of twins — just like its show. In the sartorial imagery, loafers are made new with heart-shaped toes, tailored suits are copped and double-breasted, and Gizmo from Gremlins is centered on a collegiate-style sweater.

Along with the campaign, Gucci debuted the e-com editorial spotlighting the collection. In it, we see the collection worn in real life on real people.

See Gucci’s full SS23 campaign here, and shop the collection online and in Gucci’s boutiques worldwide now, with more items expected to arrive imminently.

For Spring/Summer 2023, KENZO places an emphasis on “worldliness, inclusivity and individuality.” To do so, creative director NIGO sets the latest collection on a nautical journey around the globe in its campaign.

The campaign stars skateboarder and musician Lil Dre, vocalist Nina Utashiro, and models Moses Battiest, Ama Elsesser, Sunmoon Jung, Lily McMenamy, Omar Sesay, Lulu Tenney and Bomi Youn. Across the images, sailor motifs blend with streetwear styles, while collegiate notes pair with traditional Parisian flairs.

The world’s richest man makes quite an impression - Apollo Magazine,"Sat, 04 Feb 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFwb2xsby1tYWdhemluZS5jb20vYmVybmFyZC1hcm5hdWx0LWx2bWgtY2FpbGxlYm90dGUtcGVuc2lvbi1wcm90ZXN0cy1mcmFuY2Uv0gFfaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYXBvbGxvLW1hZ2F6aW5lLmNvbS9iZXJuYXJkLWFybmF1bHQtbHZtaC1jYWlsbGVib3R0ZS1wZW5zaW9uLXByb3Rlc3RzLWZyYW5jZS8_YW1wPTE?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Introducing Rakewell, Apollo’s wandering eye on the art world. Look out for regular posts taking a rakish perspective on art and museum stories.

The Musée d’Orsay ended January on a high note by putting its new Caillebotte on show. It was in 2020 that the then culture minister, Franck Riester, designated Partie de Bateau (c. 1877–78) as a ‘national treasure’. But it was not until last Monday that a French museum could claim the painting for its own, thanks to the largesse of another national treasure, the luxury-goods conglomerate LVMH, which had bought it for €43m from the descendants of the artist and made a present of it. Something of a coup for the Musée d’Orsay then, which, as Le Monde reports, has an annual acquisitions budget of around €3m. Excellent timing, too, as next year we can expect a raft of exhibitions marking the 150th anniversary of the First Impressionist Exhibition on the rue des Capucines. Caillebotte didn’t take part in that landmark show, but was largely responsible for bankrolling the Second and divided critical opinion with works such as Les Raboteurs de Parquet (1875).

A statement from Rima Abdul Malek, the current minister of culture, made a point of thanking LVMH – and both she and an adviser to Bernard Arnault (president and chief executive of LVMH and notable art collector), were present at the unveiling of the painting in Paris last Monday. What jaded Anglo-Saxon observers might regard as a run-of-the-mill case of private philanthropy leading to some public benefit took a typically French turn just a day later. The announcement of the gift came just after LVMH reported record profits (and a doubling of its dividend) and just before 1.2m aggrieved French workers went on strike. At Tuesday’s protests against the raising of the pension age from 62 to 64, the face of Arnault graced more than one placard, accompanied by slogans suggesting he contribute more to the common good. The world’s richest man is an easily identified source of ire in a country that needs no encouragement to take to the streets. Partie de Bateau is to be shown at various venues in 2024 and Caillebotte will also get a full-scale survey at the Musée d’Orsay in the autumn. While it’s possible that certain members of the nation will feel a touch more grateful next year, Rakewell wouldn’t count on it.

LVMH and Tiffany Team Up for Inclusive Training Program - Rapaport,"Sun, 26 Feb 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQGh0dHBzOi8vcmFwYXBvcnQuY29tL21hZ2F6aW5lLWFydGljbGVzL21ha2luZy1yb29tLWF0LXRoZS1iZW5jaC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Making room at the bench: Collaboration aims to foster diverse community of aspiring jewelry artisans.

In 2022, I attended at least a dozen industry events and half as many committees in the US and abroad. The topic of almost every conversation invariably turned to the shortage of bench jewelers in the US.

Apparently, someone was listening, because LVMH’s Métiers d’Excellence (ME) Institute announced in July that it would be opening its inaugural branch in the United States in partnership with Tiffany & Co.

Tiffany will be the first American house to participate in the program, which was already operating in six other countries. The objective is to train the next generation of jewelry craftspeople, enabling apprentices to learn artisanal, design and retail excellence. In 2020, the program boasted a 97% combined graduation rate at all its branches, with an impressive 78% of graduates getting job placements in the métiers they studied. What is noteworthy about the work/study format is the criteria: No prior qualifications are necessary, and there are no fees to participate.

Opening opportunities

Last July, Tiffany launched its Tiffany Atrium social impact platform, which “focuses on three core pillars: creativity, education and community,” according to Mary Bellai, the company’s chief human-resources officer and global senior vice president. The collaboration with LVMH falls under the “education” pillar.

“Tiffany Atrium aims to increase opportunities for a wide range of communities and individuals with different skill sets, ranging from experienced jewelers to individuals without a formal jewelry background,” Bellai explains. The ME Institute’s minimal application requirements help further that goal. “Essentially, applicants need to have a high school degree and be open to learning.”

The bench-jeweler field “is still largely male-dominated,” Bellai notes. As such, the LVMH application process focused on recruiting professionals — especially women — from historically underrepresented communities. LVMH and Tiffany worked diligently with the New York Department of Labor to register the program, followed by an extensive review and selection process. Tiffany will support a two-year training regimen of jewelry design and fabrication, including rotations throughout its workshops.

The value of inclusion

The work of creating a more inclusive jewelry trade “is not new to our brand,” says Bellai. “We have always been guided by the belief that a successful company has a responsibility to the greater community.”

The company’s efforts have provided a number of opportunities for students and institutions, she adds. Even the Carters have gotten involved — yes, those Carters: Beyoncé and Jay-Z. In 2021, Tiffany announced its partnership with the two music icons via the About Love Scholarship Program.

“We pledged $2 million in scholarship funding for students in the arts and creative fields at historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs) through 2024,” Bellai reports.

With Tiffany trailblazing in the social-impact space, the luxury industry will hopefully see some much-needed diversity and inclusion.

World's richest man Bernard Arnault wary of succession fight among 5 kids: report - New York Post,"Mon, 06 Feb 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vbnlwb3N0LmNvbS8yMDIzLzAyLzA2L3dvcmxkcy1yaWNoZXN0LW1hbi1iZXJuYXJkLWFybmF1bHQtd2FyeS1vZi1zdWNjZXNzaW9uLWZpZ2h0L9IBXmh0dHBzOi8vbnlwb3N0LmNvbS8yMDIzLzAyLzA2L3dvcmxkcy1yaWNoZXN0LW1hbi1iZXJuYXJkLWFybmF1bHQtd2FyeS1vZi1zdWNjZXNzaW9uLWZpZ2h0L2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Bernard Arnault, the richest man in the world, is laying the groundwork for a succession plan that would head off any potential fighting amongst his five children for his $196 billion fortune, according to a report.

Arnault, the 73-year-old CEO of LVMH — the French luxury conglomerate which makes Louis Vuitton handbags and Dom Perignon champagne — has created a new holding company that splits his fortune equally among his kids, according to Bloomberg News.

The new company is key to Arnault’s vision of LVMH remaining under family control, though observers do not know which of his five children — all of whom work in the business — will assume the mantle of LVMH’s chief executive.

Arnault fathered two children — Delphine, 47, and Antoine, 45 — with his first wife and has three children from his current marriage — sons Alexandre, 30; Frederic, 28; and Jean, 24.

In December, Antoine was named CEO of Christian Dior SE. At around the same time, his sister, Delphine, was tapped to head the Christian Dior Couture brand. She had previously been in charge of overseeing products at the Louis Vuitton division of the company.

The promotions ignited speculation within European business circles about Arnault’s future succession plans.

The Post has sought comment from LVMH.

Alexandre runs product and communications at another family property, the jewelry retailer Tiffany & Co., while Frédéric is in charge of Swiss watchmaker Tag Heuer.

Jean has been placed in charge of a new division at Louis Vuitton that will manufacture watches.

The Arnault family controls around 48% of LVMH shares, granting it 64% of the voting rights, according to securities filings.

Most of the shareholding is through the Christian Dior SE holding company.

The Paris-based luxury goods empire, whose shares are traded on the CAC 40 Euronext Paris index, is worth $454.29 billion, making it the most valuable company in Europe.

It owns several well-known brand names including Sephora, Fendi, Givenchy, Stella McCartney, Marc Jacobs and Bulgari.

While other retailers have struggled in recent years, LVMH has continued dominating the luxury goods space. In the fourth quarter of last year, LVMH sales rose 9% year-over year. In 2022, the company boosted its sales by 23% to a record $86 billion.

The strong sales numbers have catapulted Bernard Arnault to the top of the list of world’s richest moguls — dethroning mainstays from recent years such as Tesla boss Elon Musk and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos.

Bernard Arnault molded his empire by successfully merging Moët Hennessy and Louis Vuitton to form LVMH.

While observers wonder about the future of the company, the patriarch doesn’t seem to show any signs of slowing down in the near term.

LVMH to manage two properties belonging to Qatar's Smeralda Holding – Business Traveller - Business Traveller,"Thu, 16 Feb 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5idXNpbmVzc3RyYXZlbGxlci5jb20vYnVzaW5lc3MtdHJhdmVsLzIwMjMvMDIvMTYvbHZtaC10by1tYW5hZ2UtdHdvLXByb3BlcnRpZXMtYmVsb25naW5nLXRvLXFhdGFycy1zbWVyYWxkYS1ob2xkaW5nL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Sardegna Resorts has signed agreements with LVMH Hospitality Excellence for the latter to manage two of its hotels in Costa Smeralda.

Sardegna Resorts is a part of Smeralda Holding which is wholly-owned by the Qatar Investment Authority (QIA). LVMH Hospitality Excellence meanwhile belongs to the luxury group LVMH Moët Hennessy – Louis Vuitton.

The LVMH brand Belmond will manage the Hotel Romazzino, which will open for the 2024 season as the Romazzino, A Belmond Hotel, Costa Smeralda.

The second property, Hotel Pitrizza, will be managed by the LVMH brand Cheval Blanc. The hotel will continue to operate under its current name until 2026, when it will be rebranded as Cheval Blanc Pitrizza, Costa Smeralda, following the completion of a renovation project.

In a statement released by LVMH, it added that all employees will remain employed by Sardegna Resorts, which will also retain ownership of the hotels’ property and businesses.

Both hotels are located in the heart of Costa Smeralda and were designed in the 1960s by the architects Luigi Vietti and Michele Busiri Vici – who both contributed to the development of Porto Cervo.

Smeralda Holding Group’s long-term strategy to enhance Costa Smeralda hospitality offerings was launched in 2017. The plan includes tourism initiatives and the introduction of major F&B operators such as Nikki Beach, Zuma, Novikov, Beefbar and Matsuhisa, among others.

Phoebe Philo Sets Digital-First Debut for September - The Business of Fashion,"Thu, 09 Feb 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzb2ZmYXNoaW9uLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy9sdXh1cnkvcGhvZWJlLXBoaWxvLW5ldy1icmFuZC1sYXVuY2gtbHV4dXJ5LXNlcHRlbWJlci0yMDIzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Phoebe Philo will finally debut her namesake brand in September with what appears to be a digital-first approach. On Thursday, the famously social media-shy design star launched the Instagram account @phoebephilo, announcing plans to unveil her first collection for the brand via phoebephilo.com, which will open for customer registrations in July.

Philo has been largely silent since July 2021, when she announced her return to fashion after a three year hiatus with a start-up brand backed by LVMH, which has a minority stake in the venture.

“Being in my studio and making once again has been both exciting and incredibly fulfilling,” she told BoF at the time. “I am very much looking forward to being back in touch with my audience and people everywhere. To be independent, to govern and experiment on my own terms is hugely significant to me.”

Since then Philo has been building her team, strengthening the design and business sides of the label with key hires, including former Asos executive and McKinsey veteran Patrik Silén, who started as managing director last May. But the brand’s debut has been delayed more than once.

Philo’s understated, minimalist reinvention of LVMH’s Celine label powered a wildly successful growth spurt, pushing annual sales from €200 million in 2008 to more than €700 million in 2017, the year she stepped down.

But launching a luxury start-up, without existing brand awareness and key retail infrastructure, is a difficult proposition, even for star designers like Philo with her fanbase of “Philophiles.” It’s the reason why so few of the industry’s top designers do their own labels.

A Digital-First Approach

The rise of digital distribution has changed the game. It’s far more possible to scale a young brand online than in the physical world, where luxury retail space is expensive and hard to secure.

Building a direct-to-consumer e-commerce business requires greater investment than simply wholesaling to third-parties, but it offers better margins and far greater control over everything from customer data to pricing, making it much easier to rapidly test and optimise a strategy. In a noisy market, going direct also allows young labels to send a much clearer brand signal.

Of course, you still need strong creative content and you need to be fluent with social media to attract and engage an audience.

Under Philo, Celine was a social media hold out, even as e-commerce became one of luxury’s key growth drivers. And landing on a fresh creative vision that pushes beyond the chic sportswear which defined Philo’s Celine and that will resonate online is no doubt a challenge

Still, Philo is one of fashion’s most respected and successful designers, and the industry is likely to get behind the venture. So are her devoted fans.

In the four hours since launch, Philo’s new Instagram account has clocked up over 50,000 followers. And by opening website registrations in July, ahead of a September debut, Philo stands to build a database that will help turn her following of ‘Philophiles’ into loyal customers.

Disclosure: LVMH is part of a group of investors who, together, hold a minority interest in The Business of Fashion. All investors have signed shareholder’s documentation guaranteeing BoF’s complete editorial independence."

On Friday morning, the fashion industry suffered a big loss: Puig confirmed the death of legendary fashion designer Paco Rabanne, stating he had passed at his home in Portsall, France, at the age of 88. With the announcement, the parent company reminded the world of his “enormous influence on contemporary fashion, a spirit that lives on in the house that bears his name” — and the industry has continued to celebrate Rabanne’s impact.

Elsewhere, on the business front, Prada was named the world’s hottest brand in Q4 2022, while LVMH reported slowing sales growth. And in the executive seats, Kering named Sabato De Sarno the new creative director at Gucci, and Ruba Abu-Nimah left her role as Tiffany & Co.’s executive creative director for marketing and communications.

Below, Hypebeast has rounded up the top fashion stories of the week so you can stay up to date on trends in the industry.

Leading Spanish designer Paco Rabanne died at the age of 88 at his home in Portsall, France, on Friday.

Puig, the parent company that owns the visionary’s fashion house and fragrance line, confirmed his death. “Paco Rabanne made transgression magnetic,” said José Manuel Albesa, president of Puig’s fashion and beauty division, in a statement. “Who else could induce fashionable Parisian women to clamor for dresses made of plastic and metal? Who but Paco Rabanne could imagine a fragrance called Calandre – the word means ‘automobile grill,’ you know – and turn it into an icon of modern femininity?”

“That radical, rebellious spirit set him apart: There is only one Rabanne,” he added. “With his passing, we are reminded once again of his enormous influence on contemporary fashion, a spirit that lives on in the house that bears his name.”

The official House of Paco Rabanne Instagram account also shared an official statement regarding the designer’s death. “Among the most seminal fashion figures of the 20th century, his legacy will remain a constant source of inspiration,” the caption reads. “We are grateful to Monsieur Rabanne for establishing our avant-garde heritage and defining a future of limitless possibilities.”

Prada was the world’s hottest brand in the fourth quarter of 2022, according to the latest Lyst Index data. The report, which quarterly ranks the fashion industry’s most-coveted brands and products, revealed that Prada replaced Gucci in the top spot last quarter, closely followed by Moncler, Miu Miu and Valentino.

According to Lyst’s data, searches for Prada’s products increased by 37% between October and December, with the brand’s slingback shoes landing on Lyst’s most-popular products ranking. And Prada had quite the year: in 2022, the brand launched its first fine jewelry collection made from recycled gold, named Charli D’Amelio the face of Prada Linea Rossa FW22 and appointed Andrea Guerra to CEO of Prada Group.

Meanwhile, Moncler received a 76% increase in searches during the holiday months, moving it up an impressive 14 ranks into third place, its highest Lyst Index ranking since Q4 in 2020. Bottega Veneta and Loewe made sizable jumps into the sixth and seventh positions, respectively. Dior ranked eighth in the index, before Dolce & Gabbana and Saint Laurent. After facing allegations of child exploitation, Balenciaga moved down seven places into the 11th rank, marking the brand’s first placement outside of the top 10 since the Lyst Index was created five years ago.

LVMH Group, which owns brands including Louis Vuitton, Dior and Tiffany & Co., reported that its fourth-quarter revenue grew by 9%, marking the first time that the luxury conglomerate’s quarterly growth rate has slowed to single digits since 2020, according to Business of Fashion.

The figure represents a slowdown from a 20% growth rate in the first nine months of 2022, though it still exceeds financial analysts’ estimates of 7% growth. Across the entire year, LVMH Group’s revenue rose 23% to €79.2 billion EUR.

Impacted by regional lockdowns and quarantines in China, LVMH’s organic revenue in Asia fell by 8% in the fourth quarter, and it was flat when compared year-to-year. Despite the lowering growth figures, LVMH chairman Bernard Arnault said that he was “quite confident” about 2023.

“There’s been an extremely strong start to 2023…If the opening of China is confirmed, if it continues like this it should be a very good year,” Arnault said during LVMH’s first in-person conference in three years. “We will be able to grow, and keep growing our investments.”

Earlier this week, Kering officially named Sabato De Sarno the new creative director at Gucci.

De Sarno boasts several years of experience in luxury fashion houses, and he is particularly known as a close associate of Valentino‘s Pierpaolo Piccioli. He joined Valentino’s team in 2009 as fashion director, after holding positions at Prada and Dolce & Gabbana.

In a statement, the designer said, “I am deeply honored to take on the role as Creative Director of Gucci. I am proud to join a House with such an extraordinary history and heritage, that over the years has been able to welcome and cherish values I believe in. I am touched and excited to contribute my creative vision for the brand.”

In a joint statement posted to Instagram, the President and CEO of Gucci, Marco Bizzarri, wrote, “Having worked with a number of Italy’s most renowned luxury fashion houses, he brings with him a vast and relevant experience. I am certain that through Sabato’s deep understanding and appreciation for Gucci’s unique legacy, he will lead our creative teams with a distinctive vision that will help write this exciting next chapter, reinforcing the House’s fashion authority while capitalizing on its rich heritage.”

Ruba Abu-Nimah, Tiffany & Co.’s executive creative director for marketing and communications, exited her role at the brand on Friday.

Abu-Nimah first joined the company in March 2021, operating under Alexandre Arnault, the executive vice president of product and communications after LVMH’s January takeover. Abu-Nimah joined as part of LVMH’s fresh leadership strategy, with the intention of overseeing creative assets, including web design, social media content and advertising campaigns.

Both Tiffany & Co. and Abu-Nimah have not yet commented.

New rumors surfaced regarding a new Supreme x UNDERCOVER collaboration, according to reports from Supreme Drops on Tuesday.

Fiver years following their last partnership, it appears that Jun Takahashi‘s label will reconnect with the box-logo brand for a fourth collaboration. The two imprints previously worked together for capsules inside their Spring/Summer 2015, Fall/Winter 2016 and most recently, Spring/Summer 2018 collections.

No additional information has been released. Stay tuned for more news on the potential collaboration.

LeBron James emerged wearing the new Tiffany & Co. x Nike collaboration at Madison Square Garden on Tuesday, revealing an all-new letterman jacket from the team-up.

The black varsity jacket boasts leather sleeves and dual-iconographic Tiffany & Co. x Nike patchwork. Paying respect to New York City, the silhouette dons a patch relating to the American fashion capital on the front and more traditional branding on its back.

The collaboration is set to release on March 7 on Nike’s SNKRS app, the Tiffany Flagship Next Door, Tiffany & Co. SoHo and select Nike retailers worldwide. The shoe is priced at $400 USD.

ISSEY MIYAKE opened a new, four-story outpost in Ginza, Tokyo.

Titled ISSEY MIYAKE GINZA / 442, the Gasuto District Street shopping destination takes its name from the late visionary’s address. Designed by Tokujin Yoshioka, the store showcases the imprint’s designs across a modular construction with floating aluminum walls, juxtaposed by white walls and an industrial floor.

“Clothes are floating in the air. A strip of aluminum wall pierces through the space. This futuristic space represents Issey Miyake’s innovative approach to clothing and its philosophy,” said Yoshioka. “This space, designed with the elements created by molding ecologically sustainable recycled aluminum using special manufacturing techniques, creates a space that is minimalistic yet formative and futuristic.”"
Nicola Bulgari Convicted for Insider Trading on LVMH Shares - WWD,"Wed, 15 Feb 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vd3dkLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy1uZXdzL2xlZ2FsL25pY29sYS1idWxnYXJpLXRhcmEtYXNzZXQtbWFuYWdlbWVudC1jb252aWN0ZWQtaW5zaWRlci10cmFkaW5nLWx2bWgtc2hhcmVzLTEyMzU1Mjg2Mzgv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS — Nicola Bulgari, former executive of Roman luxury house Bulgari, and his asset management firm Tara were convicted on Tuesday of insider trading, according to French news agency AFP.

As part of a prior admission of guilt procedure with the French national financial prosecution service, Bulgari and Tara were sentenced to fines of 1.2 million euros and 5.5 million euros, respectively. The former Bulgari co-owner was also handed a nine-month suspended jail sentence. Both sentences were approved by a judge of Paris’ judicial court.

The Roman jeweler’s former executive and the management company stood accused of benefiting from transactions effected on LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton shares in 2016. The French luxury conglomerate had taken a majority stake in Bulgari from its founding family in 2011, in a cash-and-share transaction with a total value of more than $6 billion.

According to the AFP’s report, Nicola Bulgari and Tara purchased respectively 20,000 and 82,600 shares of the French luxury group between July 6 and 18 of that year, which were then sold on July 27, the day after LVMH announced first-half results that led to a rise in its share price.

The gains had been 292,400 euros for him personally and 1.4 million euros for the asset management company.

The luxury group said it had recorded 17.2 billion euros for the first half of 2016, with a year-over-year organic revenue growth of 4 percent. Over that period, profit from continuing operations was flat at 2.95 billion euros, or $3.3 billion. Net profit increased 8 percent to 1.71 billion euros, or $7.12 billion, WWD reported at the time.

An administrative investigation had been launched in 2017 after the transactions were spotted by France’s Financial Markets Authority, which led to a preliminary inquiry in 2019 by the financial prosecution service.

While he initially contested the charges during his December 2021 testimony, Nicola Bulgari told the court at the sentencing hearing that he “had concluded it was time to admit the facts” after discussions with his counsel and “recognized what [he] had done, [feeling] guilty.”

While the investigation was unable to pinpoint the source of the information that led to the transactions, the “timely nature” and “unusual” operations, along with the “absence of convincing explanations” from the former Bulgari executive and “a plausible information transmission circuit” supported the insider trading charges, according to prosecutor Laurent Couderc.

Tara and Nicola Bulgari could not be reached for comment."
Joan Mitchell Foundation claims LVMH used American artist's work in ads without permission - Le Monde,"Sat, 25 Feb 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMinwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5sZW1vbmRlLmZyL2VuL2N1bHR1cmUvYXJ0aWNsZS8yMDIzLzAyLzI1L2pvYW4tbWl0Y2hlbGwtZm91bmRhdGlvbi1jbGFpbXMtbHZtaC11c2VkLWFtZXJpY2FuLWFydGlzdC1zLXdvcmstaW4tYWRzLXdpdGhvdXQtcGVybWlzc2lvbl82MDE3MjQyXzMwLmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"This photograph, taken on September 29, 2022, shows a painting by the American artist Joan Mitchell, shown as part of the ""Monet-Mitchell"" exhibition, from October 5, 2022 to February 27, 2023, at the Fondation Louis Vuitton in Paris. JOËL SAGET/AFP

Louis Vuitton's latest international advertising campaign to promote its handbags has sparked a spat with the estate of Joan Mitchell, a leading figure in American abstract expressionism (1925-1992).

In the offending ads, actress Léa Seydoux poses in front of three works, La Grande Vallée XIV (For a Little While) (1983), Quartet II for Betsy Jolas (1976) and Edrita Fried (1981). These paintings are on view at the Fondation Louis Vuitton through February 27, as part of the ""Monet-Mitchell"" exhibition. The Joan Mitchell Foundation (JMF), responsible for the artist's intellectual property rights, regards this campaign as illegal.

On Tuesday, February 21, the Joan Mitchell Foundation sent ""a cease and desist letter to Louis Vuitton Malletier demanding that the company immediately withdraw its print and digital advertising campaign that illegally reproduces and uses at least three works by artist Joan Mitchell for the promotion of its commercial goods.""

At the end of 2022, the luxury brand first asked JMF for permission to use paintings by the artist in a future advertising campaign. In fact, even if two of the paintings belong to the Musée national d'art moderne at the Centre Pompidou – Quatuor II for Betsy Jolas and La Grande Vallée XIV (For a Little While) – the JMF must give its agreement for any commercial use of the works, whether or not they are in its own collection, like Edrita Fried.

Offer declined

However, ""JMF denied this request in writing in accordance with its longstanding policy that images of the artist's work be used only for educational purposes,"" arguing that Joan Mitchell's work had absolutely nothing to do with the trade of a range of handbags sold at a minimum of €5,500 each.

Christa Blatchford, director of the JMF, told the New York Times on February 21 that Jean-Paul Claverie, who advises Bernard Arnault (the CEO of LVMH) on sponsorship matters, had come back to her in January, emailing her that this request came ""from Arnault himself"" and that ""the billionaire was ready to make a donation to the Joan Mitchell Foundation."" Proof that not everything can be bought, Blatchford once again declined this offer.

However, the advertising campaign started on February 12, 2023, without the agreement of the copyright holders. Is it just a coincidence that this is Joan Mitchell's birthday? ""By permitting these works to be photographed for this purpose and in this manner, the Fondation Louis Vuitton is in violation of its agreement with JMF,"" Blatchford criticized. JMF went on to write, ""It is a grave disappointment to JMF that Louis Vuitton has such disregard for the rights of an artist and would exploit her work for financial gain.""

Looks like Pharrell Williams is the new creative director of Louis Vuitton - Dazed,"Tue, 14 Feb 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhemVkZGlnaXRhbC5jb20vZmFzaGlvbi9hcnRpY2xlLzU4MTk0LzEvcGhhcnJlbGwtd2lsbGlhbXMtbG91aXMtdnVpdHRvbi1hcnRpc3RpYy1kaXJlY3Rvci12aXJnaWwtYWJsb2gtbHZtaNIBfmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhemVkZGlnaXRhbC5jb20vZmFzaGlvbi9hcnRpY2xlLzU4MTk0LzEvcGhhcnJlbGwtd2lsbGlhbXMtbG91aXMtdnVpdHRvbi1hcnRpc3RpYy1kaXJlY3Rvci12aXJnaWwtYWJsb2gtbHZtaD9hbXA9MQ?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"This afternoon, heavyweight fashion business publications began to speculate that LVMH was gearing up to announce Pharrell Williams as its next menswear designer. 15 months after the passing of Virgil Abloh, who tragically died from a rare form of heart cancer at the age of 41, the news has now been confirmed by the house, with Pharrell set to make his debut in June later this year.

In the time that has passed since Abloh’s untimely death, fashion pundits have repeated a slew of names back and forth to one another with little consensus, among them Martine Rose, Jonathan Anderson, Grace Wales Bonner, IB Kamara, Maximilian, and Tremaine Emory. The election of Pharrell, however, is not a completely unexpected turn of events. Since founding Billionaire Boys Club in 2013, Pharrell’s creative output has straddled music, architecture, fine art, and beauty, alongside blockbuster collaborations with adidas, Karl Lagerfeld at Chanel, and Moncler. In many ways, his elastic output compounds Abloh’s genre-blending approach to fashion-making.

With the brand bringing in an estimated revenue of €16.7 billion in 2021, Louis Vuitton is at the heart of the LVMH empire and Bernard Arnault, whose own retirement has recently been extended by another five years, is likely to have taken a major role in the selection of candidates. “I am glad to welcome Pharrell back home, after our collaborations in 2004 and 2008 for Louis Vuitton, as our new Men’s Artistic Director,“ Pietro Beccari, Louis Vuitton’s Chairman and CEO said. “His creative vision beyond fashion will undoubtedly lead Louis Vuitton towards a new and very exciting chapter.”"
RL vs. LVMUY: Which Stock Should Value Investors Buy Now? - Yahoo Finance,"Wed, 15 Feb 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9ybC12cy1sdm11eS1zdG9jay12YWx1ZS0xNjQwMDQ1MDYuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Investors interested in Textile - Apparel stocks are likely familiar with Ralph Lauren (RL) and LVMH-Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SA (LVMUY). But which of these two stocks presents investors with the better value opportunity right now? Let's take a closer look.

We have found that the best way to discover great value opportunities is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with a great grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system. The proven Zacks Rank emphasizes companies with positive estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight stocks with specific traits.

Currently, both Ralph Lauren and LVMH-Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SA are holding a Zacks Rank of # 1 (Strong Buy). This means that both companies have witnessed positive earnings estimate revisions, so investors should feel comfortable knowing that both of these stocks have an improving earnings outlook. But this is only part of the picture for value investors.

Value investors are also interested in a number of tried-and-true valuation metrics that help show when a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.

Our Value category highlights undervalued companies by looking at a variety of key metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, as well as the P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that have been used by value investors for years.

RL currently has a forward P/E ratio of 15.16, while LVMUY has a forward P/E of 24.93. We also note that RL has a PEG ratio of 1.61. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. LVMUY currently has a PEG ratio of 1.77.

Another notable valuation metric for RL is its P/B ratio of 3.26. Investors use the P/B ratio to look at a stock's market value versus its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, LVMUY has a P/B of 7.66.

Story continues

Based on these metrics and many more, RL holds a Value grade of B, while LVMUY has a Value grade of F.

Both RL and LVMUY are impressive stocks with solid earnings outlooks, but based on these valuation figures, we feel that RL is the superior value option right now.

Tiffany wants Gen Z.

This was considerably high in comparison to the brand’s other campaigns, such as “Love Yourself in Love” with Beyoncé last October, which reached over $5 million in MIV over a month-long period. Reaction to the Nike tie-up, however, was mixed. While some observers applauded Tiffany for its efforts to engage with a new demographic of consumers, others — particularly sneakerheads — claimed the partnership lacked substance. “Box better than the shoes,” commented American artist DJ Skee, whose sneaker collection was valued at more than $400,000 by streetwear resale site StockX, on Instagram.

“I think the issue is more in the execution than the idea,” says Barbara E Kahn, a marketing professor at The Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania. Mega-brand collaborations work well when the language of both brands build something new, she explains — as in the case of Gucci and Balenciaga or Fendi and Versace, for example. Otherwise, lovers of both brands can be left disappointed. Tiffany declined to comment on the campaign or its wider strategy for this story.

It’s not the first time Tiffany’s creative direction has divided opinion. In July 2021, the “Not your mother’s Tiffany” campaign ditched the brand’s signature blue — a sign marketers took as the beginning of a new chapter. The campaign featured models with messy hair, dressed casually in denim and tank tops, against a plain studio backdrop. There were posters with accompanying slogans such as “this ain’t no old school” and “tell us again silver’s dated… we dare you”, plastered guerilla-style across key US cities like New York and Los Angeles. Some critics questioned whether the brand’s clear attempt to court Gen Z was alienating its longtime fans.

Then, in August 2021, Tiffany featured Beyoncé and Jay-Z in a campaign alongside Jean-Michel Basquiat’s ‘Equals Pi’. Posing in front of the painting, which had rarely been seen in public until it was acquired by Tiffany, Beyoncé wore a 128.54-carat rock around her neck. While the image delighted some fans of the couple — it was the first time Beyoncé and Jay Z had appeared together in an ad — others criticised the singer for wearing the jewel, questioning whether or not it was a “blood diamond”. (On its website, Tiffany states that all of its diamonds are “conflict-free” and that it has taken “rigorous steps” to ensure that conflict diamonds do not enter its inventory.)"
BTS member announced partnership with Louis Vuitton - Euronews,"Fri, 24 Feb 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmV1cm9uZXdzLmNvbS9jdWx0dXJlLzIwMjMvMDIvMjQvYnRzLW1lbWJlci1hbm5vdW5jZWQtcGFydG5lcnNoaXAtd2l0aC1sb3Vpcy12dWl0dG9u0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"By Saskia O'Donoghue

As BTS's hiatus continues due to band members serving in the military, J-Hope announces his latest fashion ambassador role.

Singer J-Hope’s star is on the up and up - and now he’s bagged a partnership with leading fashion house Louis Vuitton.

The K-pop musician and member of hugely popular Korean boy band BTS has been announced as the luxury French brand’s newest ambassador.

It’s not the first time the artist has collaborated with Louis Vuitton; in 2021, he and his fellow band members were collectively named as brand ambassadors in a partnership that’s since expired.

BTS are currently on hiatus and its members have been focusing on solo projects and securing individual deals with fashion houses. The break is mostly due to South Korean laws, which specify that all able-bodied men must complete military service for up to 21 months.

The seven-member group, which comprises RM, Jin, Suga, Jung Kook, Jimin, V and J-Hope, have had an established relationship with Louis Vuitton. At the 2022 Grammy Awards, they all wore custom Vuitton suits on the red carpet.

BTS’ popularity is showing no signs of slowing down. Only this week, they came in at number two in IFPI’s Global Recording Artist Chart. That marked their third consecutive year in the top three, following on from back-to-back wins in 2020 and 2021.

Following the partnership announcement, the house of Louis Vuitton called BTS “21st century pop icons,” and said J-Hope “brings his unique charm and style to this exciting new chapter with the maison.”

The ambassadorship is part of his seemingly unstoppable rise. It comes after the release of a new Disney+ documentary, “J-Hope in the Box”, which goes behind the scenes of his debut solo album and his headlining performance at the Lollapalooza festival last summer.

Vuitton lauded J-Hope, saying, “He is beloved by fans across the world for his upbeat energy, precise choreography and creative musical direction. With a positive on-and-off-stage presence, J-Hope continues to push artistic boundaries and inspire international audiences.”

J-Hope joins an impressive group of brand ambassadors at Louis Vuitton including actors Bradley Cooper and Tahar Rahim and musician Jackson Wang. His BTS bandmate Jimin recently signed with Dior, while Suga is a current brand ambassador for Valentino."
"The World's Richest Person Sold Himself An $84 Million House, This Could Be Why - Yahoo Finance","Tue, 28 Feb 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy93b3JsZHMtcmljaGVzdC1wZXJzb24tc29sZC1oaW1zZWxmLTE3MjE0MzgyNC5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Bernard Arnault, the richest person in the world and owner of luxury brand LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton, reportedly sold one of his Los Angeles properties in late 2021 for a staggering $84.5 million.

While the house was never listed for public sale, grant deeds confirm that the property underwent an ownership transfer. Arnault’s LLC was sold to another LLC set up by his lawyer – meaning the billionaire bought the house from himself.

The circumstances surrounding the sale are unusual as Arnault appears to have been on both sides of the transaction. It is unclear why Arnault would sell a house to himself, however, it was speculated that the property was either transferred to a close family member or held in the extensive Arnault family portfolio of holdings.

Arnault is renowned for his influence in the luxury industry, with his net worth of $206.6 billion making him the richest man in the world. The Beverly Hills mansion, custom-designed by Marmol Radziner, boasts breathtaking views of the Los Angeles skyline, with an infinity-edged swimming pool shaped like a frying pan out back.

Real estate doesn't have to be exclusive to the likes of billionaires — new companies have been democratizing real estate, and have made it possible for the individual investor to enter the market with minimal capital.

While the property was never publicly listed for sale, archived permits reveal that the mansion is likely over 10,000 square feet and was built with only three bedrooms. The property spans nearly two acres, though much of that land is unusable hillside, and there isn’t much landscaping besides a thicket of trees for privacy.

Arnault is a seasoned real estate developer and owns several other properties in the Los Angeles area, including the adjacent property to the recently sold mansion, where he is building another mansion. His extensive Rodeo Drive shopping district holdings also fall under various LVMH holding companies.

The circumstances surrounding the sale of Arnault’s Beverly Hills residence remain shrouded in mystery, but the $84.5 million sale was officially recorded in December 2021.

Confirmed: Pharrell Williams Will Usher in a New Era at Vuitton Men's - The Business of Fashion,"Tue, 14 Feb 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzb2ZmYXNoaW9uLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy9sdXh1cnkvcmVwb3J0LWxvdWlzLXZ1aXR0b24taW4tdGFsa3Mtd2l0aC1waGFycmVsbC13aWxsaWFtcy1sdXh1cnktbHYtbWVucy1kZXNpZ25lci_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Louis Vuitton has hired Pharrell Williams to become its new men’s creative director, opening a new chapter for the brand following the death of star designer Virgil Abloh in November 2021, the brand confirmed Tuesday in an Instagram post.

The appointment is the first big move by new CEO Pietro Beccari, who joined the brand from LVMH stablemate Dior this month, and confirms previous reports in the Wall Street Journal and Le Figaro.

The decision puts an end to months of speculation about who would take one of fashion’s top jobs. Designers Martine Rose, Grace Wales Bonner and Telfar Clemens were said to also be in the running for the role.

But the choice of Williams, a world-famous music producer and streetwear guru with 14.3 million Instagram followers, suggests that Vuitton is banking on celebrity star power and mass appeal to propel its men’s business in the post-Abloh era, a move that stands in contrast to the recent appointment of behind-the-scenes Valentino designer Sabato De Sarno at rival megabrand Gucci.

Last year, Louis Vuitton surpassed €20 billion in annual revenue, and future growth will require new CEO Beccari to extend its appeal still further. Vuitton recently unleashed the latest chapter of its blockbuster collaboration with artist Yayoi Kusama and tapped superstar footballers Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi in the same campaign.

“[Williams’] creative vision beyond fashion will undoubtedly lead Louis Vuitton towards a new and very exciting chapter,” Beccari said in a statement that labeled the brand a “cultural maison.”

The appointment is also a doubling down on the streetwear-inflected sensibility that Abloh brought to Vuitton. With collections that married street culture with high fashion, as well as his natural fluency with social media, Abloh helped broaden the brand’s appeal with a younger, more diverse customer base, creating a halo over the Vuitton mark that continued to pay dividends after his sudden death in 2021.

Williams is best known for his music career, dropping on chart topping hits like “Happy” and “Get Lucky.” Rising to prominence as part of hip-hop group N.E.R.D, Williams went on to produce tracks for A-list stars ranging from Gwen Stefani to Justin Timberlake and Britney Spears.

But he also has long-standing links to the streetwear scene, co-founded pioneering streetwear brand Billionaire Boys Club with Japanese musician and BAPE-founder Nigo in the early naughts. The duo have also launched BBC sub-labels Ice Cream, Bee Line and Billionaire Girls Club.

Williams has collaborated also with a string of major fashion brands, from Chanel and Moncler to Adidas, and even Louis Vuitton: in 2008, he teamed up with then-creative director Marc Jacobs on a jewellery line for the heritage house. In 2016, he became co-owner of denim brand G-Star Raw.

Williams first collection for Louis Vuitton will debut next June in Paris during Men’s Fashion Week, the brand said.

LVMH Is Reopening This Top Caribbean Resort - Caribbean Journal,"Sun, 19 Feb 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNhcmliam91cm5hbC5jb20vMjAyMy8wMi8xOS9sdm1oLWNhcmliYmVhbi1yZXNvcnQtcmVvcGVuaW5nL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LVMH’s Belmond brand is reopening its Riviera Maya luxury resort this spring following a dramatic makeover.

The new-look Maroma, a Belmond Hotel will reopen its doors on May 25, 2023, Caribbean Journal has learned.

Designer Tara Bernerd and her team have led what Belmond is calling an “extensive renovation and redesign” of the longtime Mexican Caribbean resort.

“Maroma offered a rare opportunity to reimagine this iconic hotel, with its rich and storied history,” said Bernerd. “We sought to retain and enhance the original character, working with local artisans, whilst simultaneously incorporating a contemporary elegance, a warmth that also has a sense of home, that speaks to the needs of the Belmond guest for generations to come.”

The Guerlain Spa is set in the jungle.

The project will be headlined by the addition of 10 new waterfront suites, along with a “nature focused” wellness experience with Guerlain, and a new culinary program under Mexican Chef Daniel Camacho.

The wellness destination is be the second Guerlain Spa in the wider Caribbean, joining another LVMH hotel, the Cheval Blanc St Barth Isle de France in St Barth.

The new-look, jungle-set spa will focus on traditional Mayan healing rituals and other treatments centered around the Mayan wellness philosophy. That will include a full slate of daily wellness programming like yoga and meditation.

Chef Camacho’s priority will be on “sustainable provenance,” promising to source 90 percent of all ingr3idnets from Mexico — and nearby half from the Yucatan peninsula itself.

Maroma is keeping its famous beach bar, Freddy’s Bar, which will have live music and DJ sets and a focus on seafood.

It’s the first large-scale redesign of a Belmond resort since LVMH acquired the company in 2018.

The hotel is one of just three Belmond resorts in the Caribbean, along with properties in Anguilla (Cap Juluca) and St Martin (La Samanna).

LVMH’s other Caribbean hotel property is the aforementioned Cheval Blanc St Barth-Isle de France in St Barth, although that is not part of the Belmond portfolio.

KUSIKOHC is Nominated for LVMH PRIZE 2023 - DSCENE MAGAZINE,"Mon, 20 Feb 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlc2lnbnNjZW5lLm5ldC8yMDIzLzAyL2t1c2lrb2hjLWx2bWgtcHJpemUtMjAyMy5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Fashion brand KUSIKOHC is nominated for this year’s LVMH PRIZE, and will present its Fall Winter 2023.24 collection to the jury and industry leaders on March 2nd and 3rd 2023 during Paris Fashion Week. Kusikohc, created by a multidisciplinary artist Cho Giseok, is unapologetic in its approach. For its Fall Winter 2023 Collection, the brand explores the “Right to Fail” concept, and captures individuality at its most authentic level.

I believe challenge and endeavour themselves have the power to change at least small parts of something, even if they get failed. Therefore, we have the Right to Fail. – Cho Giseok

“The ‘Right to Fail’ concept is derived from Kusikohc’s very first collection, and showcases the delicate balance of co-existence in a juxtaposed reality. With narrow visibility back when the first collection launched in 2016, it was important to Giseok to reinvoke this concept again, this time evolving the subtle nuances of the theme and achieving a broader presence. In the end, “Right to Fail” is a promise to himself, with Giseok carrying his personal motto through his creations, but just enough to leave it open to interpretation for anyone who might come across it.” – from Kusikohc

This is the tenth edition of LVMH Prize, over 2,400 candidates applied for the 2023 edition, and 22 young brands were selected for the semi-final. The designers come from 15 countries, including, for the first time, Brazil and Jamaica.
