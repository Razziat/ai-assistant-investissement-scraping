LVMH, the conglomerate behind some of the biggest brands in fashion like Louis Vuitton and Dior, has made significant strides in partnerships this week. Apart from going into talks with the Olympics to add French flair to the 2024 Paris-based event, LVMH has also partnered with one of the biggest names in gaming, Epic Games. The move continues luxury’s relationship with immersive digital experiences and is a good indication of what kinds of partnerships are working for luxury players right now.

The partnership with Epic Games, announced on June 14, is set to create new immersive customer experiences and add new tools to its design pipeline using 3D technologies for all of its brands. These tools include Unreal Engine, a gaming creation tool that was recently used in Puma’s Black Station 2 launch. The tool can be used to create high-definition, realistic gaming experiences, new collections and ad campaigns. It has been on fashion’s radar as of late as the industry considers how to present its visual-heavy brands in digital environments that showcase them in the best light.

LVMH Group’s managing director Toni Belloni said that Epic’s tools will help the company “engage more effectively with younger generations who are very much at ease with these codes and uses.” However, LVMH is targeting more than just younger customers. Taking inspiration from the high net worth collectors in the art world, fashion companies like LVMH are hoping that web3 can help them target those affluent customers as well.

LVMH’s Louis Vuitton has done that through a uniquely expensive NFT project. On June 6, the brand launched digital collectibles through VIA Trunks that allow the brand’s super fans to receive special access to its future projects through a connected digital wallet, where invitations and announcements will be airdropped, as well as unique collections and access to events. The phygital trunks (physical and digital) had a limited launch of less than a hundred units on June 8, with a price tag of $42,000. They sold out within the day, and the company received more demand for the items than expected, according to a person familiar with the proceedings.



“If you look at the reaction that the Treasure Trunks announcement had across the fashion, Web3 and marketing industries, it’s very clear that those industries are closely aligned,” said LVMH Innovation Award winner Samir Addamine, co-founder and CEO of Absolute Labs, the first web3 wallet relationship platform. “Luxury brands are using their considerable influence to demonstrate to others what is possible. Every new campaign, collection or project is providing a framework or playbook for helping other brands embark on a journey into web3 of their own.”

The VIA Trunks launch shows that accessibility doesn’t have to look the same everywhere for a fashion brand – Louis Vuitton has also done mobile games and other experiences aimed at a mass audience. Many other brands within digital environments have tended to lower the price of their digital items to bring more users on board rather than hyper-personalize their offering, like Richard Quinn offering $60 NFTs or Gucci offering its aviators on Roblox for 90 Robux, the equivalent of $7.



LVMH has also been continuously investing in new technology through its Innovation Award since 2017 and its LVMH Pavilion at the Viva Tech conference in Paris, where it exhibits its innovations each year. At the awards, Bernard Arnault, Chairman & CEO of the LVMH group, mentioned that “LVMH was also a startup some years ago.”

It’s this startup mentality, plus a growing responsibility for some of the biggest brands in the world, that makes LVMH’s investment a guide for the rest of the industry.

“Fashion leaders know that blockchain-based technologies, and even AI, represent something groundbreaking but are also being very deliberate in being sure that how they leverage those technologies will reflect well on both their legacies and future,” said Addamine.

Although partnerships with gaming companies and new web3 projects are flashy and could bring in new demographics, LVMH is also continuing to invest in companies that are building out more sustainable customer experiences as well.

Its latest Innovation Award winner is Save Your Wardrobe, a 6-year-old company that offers a connected post-purchase experience for aftercare, including repairs and alterations, is one such company. It was announced as the winner on June 15.



“Save Your Wardrobe perfectly embodies LVMH’s commitment to creative circularity,” said Arnault at the awards ceremony.

“LVMH mentioned that the care put into constructing the garment and creating products is extremely important to them, and that aftercare should be just as outstanding,” said Hasna Kourda, who launched the company in 2017 and the aftercare app in 2020. Its B2B solution came in 2021 with Zalando. The company has since received $3 million in seed funding.

“For luxury brands, it’s important to have a uniform experience across all channels,” she said. LVMH and its award has become a key enabler for technological progress in the fashion space. With the awards support and insight into how to approach the LVMH brands, SYW will apply its platform to high-end jewelry and watches and is considering expansion into the Middle East.

Why All LVMH Employees Will Get 'Climate Training' | TIME - TIME,"Thu, 08 Jun 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiPWh0dHBzOi8vdGltZS5jb20vNjI4NTkzMS9sdm1oLWNsaW1hdGUtY2hhbmdlLWJlcm5hcmQtYXJuYXVsdC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"(To get this story in your inbox, subscribe to the TIME CO2 Leadership Report newsletter here.)

Earlier this year, luxury goods company LVMH made headlines when it became the first European company to top a $500 billion market cap, helping make its founder Bernard Arnault the wealthiest person in the world.

At the same time, and less noticed by the global media, the company has made a wave of climate commitments to rethink how it does business. These caught my eye both because of the fashion industry’s enormous and growing environmental footprint and because of LVMH’s pole position as perhaps the industry’s most recognizable company. So with those factors in mind, a few weeks ago in Paris I sat down with Hélène Valade, who oversees environmental work across all of LVMH’s 75 brands.

At the core of LVMH’s climate efforts is a new program called LIFE360 that lays out a range of climate and biodiversity targets for the company. The goals are extensive: no virgin plastics used in packaging by 2026, a 50% cut in energy-related emissions by 2026 from 2019 levels, and zero deforestation from products in its supply chain by 2025. The company’s regulatory filings lists a range of achievements along those lines, from successful implementation of policies that uncover where they’re sourcing materials to measures that have slashed energy use in stores. “All our products come from nature—no champagne without grapes, no perfumes without forests, no ready-to-wear without cotton,” Valade told me. “It was very important to have an ambitious environmental strategy in mind.”

That strategy cuts to the core of the LVMH business model. The company is evaluating where it sources raw materials, not only to protect biodiversity but also to ensure that its supply chains aren’t vulnerable to rapidly changing climate conditions like desertification. The company is working to grow its repair business to extend the lifespan of its products, and is rolling out traceability tools so customers can understand the source and environmental impact of what they buy. Later this year, customers should be able to scan a QR on products at Sephora, for example, and see the details of its sourcing.

One challenge for diversified firms like LVMH is implementing ambitious company-wide goals across widely varied divisions and departments. LVMH has 75 brands, each of which has a lot of operational independence. Valade said the company is laying out a “common set of goals” around everything from biodiversity to energy consumption with LIFE360 and then giving the brands the tools to implement.

I was most struck by the commitment to give all employees across the globe environmental training. Buyers now need to be concerned with carbon footprints, sales people need to be able to answer environmental questions from customers, and employees that handle logistics need to understand emissions from different modes of transport, says Valade. “The change has to make sense to each employee,” says Valade. “We have to give them the keys to implement the change.”

To that end, the company is opening a training center just outside Paris where European employees will come through to get up to speed on how climate impacts their jobs. The company is looking to conduct similar programs in other locations across the globe.

It can be easy to look at corporate commitments skeptically, but Valade makes the business case convincingly. LVMH needs to attract young talent, and sustainability is a key concern for Gen Z. Customers increasingly care about the issue. (The company’s sustainability focused products—for example, Louis Vuitton’s line of upcycled sneakers—have been some of its best sellers). And, perhaps most importantly, the company’s supply chains are vulnerable to climate change. Valade discussed this point with me, but it’s also evident from a look at the company’s regulatory filings, which devote significant space to the financial risks of climate change.

In recent years, the fashion industry accounted for 4% of global emissions, according to data from McKinsey. And that percentage is poised to grow both as other sectors decarbonize and the global population continues to grow and buy more clothing. In theory, LVMH, with its size and iconic brands, can play a leading role in changing the industry. “We have an important capacity to influence and drive society,” Valade says. “And this influence has to be put in the service of sustainability.” To get there will require all the firms focused on selling cheap products quickly, not just the luxury brands of LVMH, to think a little differently."
LVMH Partners With Epic Games To Produce Immersive Digital Experiences With 3D Technology - HYPEBEAST,"Wed, 14 Jun 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vaHlwZWJlYXN0LmNvbS8yMDIzLzYvbHZtaC1lcGljLWdhbWVzLXBhcnRuZXJzaGlwLWFubm91bmNlbWVudNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton has announced it will expand its partnership with Epic Games, the creator of Fortnite and Unreal Engine, to establish new types of immersive experiences for its high-end fashion houses.

Under the deal, LVMH and its Maisons, which include Louis Vuitton, Celine and Dior, among several others, will tap into Epic’s industry-leading, three-dimensional creation tools to produce virtual fitting rooms and fashion shows, 360-degree product carousels, AR-fueled experiences and digital twins, among other digital-first initiatives. Epic’s toolbox, which houses Reality Capture, Twinmotion and MetaHuman, alongside Unreal, will allow LVMH’s companies to establish stronger identities in the ever-expanding virtual domains.

“The partnership with Epic Games will accelerate our expertise in 3D tools and ecosystems, from the creation of new collections to ad campaigns and to our maisons’ websites. We will also engage more effectively with young generations who are very much at ease with these codes and uses,” said LVMH group managing director Antonio Belloni.

Bill Clifford, vice president of Unreal Engine at Epic Games, added, “With this partnership, we will work with LVMH’s designers to transform physical and digital product creation using Epic’s suite of advanced creator tools. We are excited to accelerate the group’s adoption of Unreal Engine, Reality Capture, Twinmotion and MetaHuman technology, and help LVMH’s global brands engage with customers through immersive digital experiences.”

Several LVMH brands are already utilizing Epic’s suite to create new experiences, including Bulgari, which recently unveiled an all-new metaverse experience inspired by Ancient Rome and produced by Unreal Engine 5.

"The great predator of luxury: this is how Bernard Arnault built his LVMH empire, valued at $500 billion - EL PAÍS USA","Tue, 06 Jun 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMipAFodHRwczovL2VuZ2xpc2guZWxwYWlzLmNvbS9lY29ub215LWFuZC1idXNpbmVzcy8yMDIzLTA2LTA2L3RoZS1ncmVhdC1wcmVkYXRvci1vZi1sdXh1cnktdGhpcy1pcy1ob3ctYmVybmFyZC1hcm5hdWx0LWJ1aWx0LWhpcy1sdm1oLWVtcGlyZS12YWx1ZWQtYXQtNTAwLWJpbGxpb24uaHRtbNIBswFodHRwczovL2VuZ2xpc2guZWxwYWlzLmNvbS9lY29ub215LWFuZC1idXNpbmVzcy8yMDIzLTA2LTA2L3RoZS1ncmVhdC1wcmVkYXRvci1vZi1sdXh1cnktdGhpcy1pcy1ob3ctYmVybmFyZC1hcm5hdWx0LWJ1aWx0LWhpcy1sdm1oLWVtcGlyZS12YWx1ZWQtYXQtNTAwLWJpbGxpb24uaHRtbD9vdXRwdXRUeXBlPWFtcA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Bernard Arnault always wanted to win. As a child, he was the first in class. Later on, he was the one who passed the most difficult exams to enter the most demanding university programs. He learned to play the piano well but they say that, once he realised he wasn’t going to be the best at the instrument, he gave it up.

The piano is now just a hobby for Arnault. He keeps a grand piano in a room next to his office at 22 Avenue de Montaigne, in Paris. Sometimes, he plays a sonata. Either the best compositions, or nothing at all. He is the owner of the best brands — the emperor of luxury. He’s an art collector, a philanthropist and the man who, along with Elon Musk, is in the running for being the richest person in the world.

The ranking fluctuates: this past week — after holding the title for a good part of the year — Arnault lost the throne to the owner of Tesla and Twitter, according to Bloomberg’s Billionaires’ Index. But the fact that the owner of Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton — commonly known as LVHM — has amassed the biggest fortune on the planet makes a lot of sense.

“He was always the first in everything,” says Nadège Forestier, a journalist for Le Figaro, who worked with him regularly during the years of his rise. In 1990, she and Nazanine Ravaï published what is probably the most complete biography of his early life, The Taste of Luxury: Bernard Arnault and the Moet-Hennessy Louis Vuitton Story. “I think he finds it normal to be the richest in the world, since he was always above others.”

The 74-year-old Arnault, who was born in the city of Roubaix, in northern France, is an anomaly of global capitalism. As president of the LVMH group, he presides over a classic, niche and elitist industry — that of luxury products — in the era of Silicon Valley billionaires and technological populism. He’s a Frenchman in a club of very rich people — the likes of Musk and Jeff Bezos — that, in recent history, has been monopolized by Americans and Chinese. He had surpassed all of them by the end of 2022 and has since consolidated his position.

According to Bloomberg’s most recent tally, as of Friday, June 2, his fortune, bolstered by an increase in profits and a rising stock price, now exceeds $200 billion — greater than the annual budget of the European Union. Arnault owns more than 40% of the shares in LVMH, a company that, in the last five years, has appreciated by 166% on the stock market and is now valued at around $500 billion.

“His talent consists of taking a brand that exists and giving it an incredible boost,” says essayist and consultant Alain Minc, who knows Arnault well. You can’t rest on your laurels but it’s actually not the competition that keeps him up at night. LVHM — the owner of brands such as Louis Vuitton, Dior, Tiffany & Co., Moët & Chandon, along with 75 maisons, or houses, in fashion, cosmetics, jewellery and alcoholic beverages — dominates an unstoppable sector. As the number of millionaires increases, so does his fortune. Although his clientele is by no means limited to this elite segment of the global population.

Nor does Arnault lose sleep over being unpopular in his country, although, in the past few months during demonstrations against pension reform, he was one of the favorite recipients of protesters’ slogans. He’s not as hated as President Emmanuel Macron (not even close), but he has appeared as a symbol of social inequalities and injustices. “France is doing badly for different reasons,” says the left-wing François Ruffin, a member of the National Assembly. He is Arnault’s nemesis in the public debate in France. “The republican motto is ‘Liberty, equality, fraternity’ — and I think that, for 40 years, France has taken a hit in equality.”

Five children

If anything preoccupies Arnault these days, it’s something beyond competition and criticism: succession. This is an eternal story. The patriarch has five children between the ages of 24 and 48, two from a first marriage to Anne Dewavrin (Delphine and Antoine) and three from his second marriage to Hélène Mercier (Alexandre, Frédéric and Jean). They all work in the family business. Arnault has said that he will continue leading LVMH until he turns 80 although, on paper, nothing prevents him from postponing his retirement. He will take his time to decide.

“Bernard Arnault has taken pains to maintain a balance between the children, so that there are no battles between them,” explains Le Monde journalist Raphaëlle Bacqué. With Vanesssa Schneider, she co-authored the book Successions: Money, blood and tears. Apparently, everything is going well so far. But Bacqué — who interviewed the patriarch and his children for her book, entering the inner sanctum on Avenue de Montaigne — clarifies that “there are rivalries that are not expressed.”

It all starts in Roubaix — on the Franco-Belgian border — a galaxy far removed from Avenue de Montaigne with its Fendi, Celine, Givenchy, Dior and Louis Vuitton shops. This is the north of France, the old industrial lung of the country. Starting in the 1970s and 1980s, this region suffered the brunt of globalization, with the closures of factories and mines. The labor bastion of the left eventually became one of the main electoral strongholds of the extreme right. The son and grandson of construction businessmen in Roubaix, Arnault belongs to a family from the provincial bourgeoisie. At the age of seven, his grandfather took him to visit the worksites. He developed an obsession for education. When his grandfather died, Arnault placed his report card — in which the teachers congratulated him on his excellent work — inside the coffin. It was his tribute.

There is something very French about Arnault: he is part of what Bacqué calls “the religion of the diploma.” If the National School of Administration trains senior French executives, Arnault opted for another, more demanding path: the École Polytechnique, France’s leading engineering school. Decades later, he would try to get his children to follow the same path, and not always successfully.

“For him, the only thing that counts is the Polytechnique,” says Antoine, the eldest of the sons, who is at the helm of the holding company that controls LVMH. He told Bacqué and Schneider this while being interviewed for Successions. “I immediately understood that I was not made for this [university]. I told him: ‘You mustn’t try to sculpt me in your image and likeness.’”

The devotion to the diploma and to the Polytechnique explain why, in the discussion about succession, the fourth son, Frédéric, 28, responsible for the TAG Heuer watch brand, is sometimes pointed to as the future leader of LVMH. “Not only does everything work out for him, but he’s modest and quite nice,” Bacqué notes, while sitting in a café in Montparnasse. “And he’s a Polytechnique graduate,” she adds, “like Bernard Arnault.”

The eldest son from the second marriage also stands out: Alexandre, 31, is an executive at Tiffany & Co., with a big profile on social media. And one cannot forget the eldest daughter, Delphine, 48, head of Dior, who is married to the French telecommunications businessman Xavier Niel. Or the youngest, Jean, 24, who works in the Louis Vuitton watch division.

Let’s go back to the young Bernard Arnault, who, fresh out of the Polytechnique, returns to the north and joins Ferret-Savinel, the family business. Very quickly, Jean — his father — gives him the reins. But on May 10, 1981, François Mitterrand wins the presidential elections, causing a chill to run through the wealthiest layers of the country. For the first time since 1958, when, in the middle of the Algerian war, General De Gaulle founded the Fifth Republic, a socialist is in the Élysée Palace. And one who is allied with the communists. Just a few days before the elections, a minister of Valéry Giscard d’Estaing — the outgoing president — warned that, if Mitterrand won, Russian tanks would parade down the Champs-Élysées.

Arnault packs his bags and settles with the family in New Rochelle, near New York. He invests in real estate operations in Florida and quietly prepares his next moves. Biographers Forestier and Ravaï write that, one day, while shopping at the Bloomingdale’s department store in New York, Arnault was looking for a nightgown and a suit. He chooses Dior. “And then,” the biographers write, “he thinks: ‘There is no more beautiful name. In the United States, the president of Dior is better known than the president of the French Republic.’” It’s time to return to France.

By 1983, Mitterrand has rectified his economic policies — the climate is better for undertaking business ventures in France. For a small sum, Arnault snaps up Boussac, a textile giant on the verge of bankruptcy. Over the next six years, Arnault will cut 8,000 jobs. What interests him is Boussac’s jewel: Christian Dior. It will be the cornerstone of his empire. “Are there serious risks?” the elder Arnault asked his son at the time of the purchase, according to an account by Jean Arnault (who died in 2010) that was published in the newspaper Les Echos… which is now also owned by LVMH. “Yes,” his son answered. “You don’t do good business without taking risks,” his father proclaimed. “Go for it!” Five years later, Bernard Arnault, who had just turned 40, took over Louis Vuitton Moët Hennessy (LVMH), which was already the world’s leading luxury group.

“Until then, luxury was the heritage of small, very prestigious maisons, without huge turnover,” says Nadège Forestier, Arnault’s biographer, in the living room of her apartment, near the Eiffel Tower. “He saw that there was a population in the whole world of people who could access luxury and who could be made to dream… that there was a potential for wealth in the whole world.”

Forestier adds: “I remember that we were finishing the book and we asked him: ‘What will you do in 20 or 30 years?’ We were convinced that he would dedicate himself to banking, to finance. We never thought that he would continue to lead a group dedicated solely to luxury.”

Bacqué observes that Arnault “returned from the United States with the idea that — being European and being French — France, for the rest of the world, is gastronomy and fashion. And this is exactly what LVMH has built on.”

“What’s interesting is the idea of a luxury that’s not only devoted to the rich, but also to the popular classes, who buy their lipstick or gadgets with the Dior logo. He understood that not only the rich buy [these products], but that the middle classes also want to participate in luxury.”

That France — a country that is permanently anguished by its decline, the egalitarian France that is one of the most redistributive countries on the planet — produces the richest man in the world is one of the paradoxes of the Arnault phenomenon. A mystery, since France is not the most innovative country, nor — if the political and intellectual discourse is taken into account — the one that is most attached to free trade and capitalism. Nor does the country have a powerful industrial sector.

Political advisor Alain Minc explains the paradox with a metaphor: “Look at a world map and imagine, for a moment, that California has been devoured by an earthquake,” he says. “Where in the world are the largest capitalists? In little France! I mean, if you get rid of the tech people, France is the only country that has produced big capitalists in recent years. Arnault at the top, but not only him: also Pinault, Bolloré, Niel… and, furthermore, the families that have inherited companies and made them grow tremendously: Dassault, L’Oréal, Hermès…”

And what is this success attributable to? “These people learned to manage at a time when managing was very difficult, since we were a ‘socializing’ country,” Minc responds. “When you’ve learned to run the 100-meter-dash with a sandbag on your back, the day the sandbag is taken off, you run very well.” This is another way of saying that, while France was not a country for capitalists, something changed about 15 years ago, when Nicholas Sarkozy was elected to the presidency, followed by François Hollande and Emmanuel Macron. These business people were already strong before. Then, they multiplied their force, their punch.

“[Arnault] has always had good relations with presidents since Jacques Chirac… he’s dressed all the first ladies since Bernadette Chirac,” Bacqué laughs. “He lobbies on taxation: inheritance rights, the wealth tax.”

The relationship of many French people with the rich is ambivalent, as it is with luxury: a mixture of hatred and admiration, rejection and pride. On April 13, a few dozen protesters on strike against the pension reform carried flares into the LVMH headquarters. The image went around the world: those below conquering the strength of those above. The symbol isn’t new. National Assembly Deputy François Ruffin dedicated a Michael Moore-style documentary to Arnault in 2015 — Merci, Patron! (Thank you, boss!) — which began with images of abandoned Boussac textile factories and recalled a controversy from 2012, when Arnault asked for Belgian nationality and the newspaper Libération printed a headline that read, “Get out, rich asshole!” Years later, Ruffin denounced that he was the target of surveillance by the former head of the secret services — the shady Bernard Squarcini — who, at the time, worked as a consultant for LVMH.

“I don’t harbor any feelings of revenge towards Bernard Arnault as an individual,” Ruffin says. “I simply believe that this social class must put its feet on the ground and, if it does not do so on its own initiative, it must be forced: in the fiscal, social and ecological fields.”

Arnault — who ultimately renounced his Belgian nationality — usually responds to criticism by recalling that LVMH has some 40,000 employees in France, out of 175,000 worldwide, and more than 100 production centers across the country. He also insists that LVMH is the biggest corporate taxpayer in France. Regarding Ruffin, he stated before the Senate in January of 2022: “Mr. Ruffin is someone very brilliant who is from the extreme left... for him, LVMH has always been a scarecrow.”

‘A big shark’

The appearance before the Senate — during an investigative commission on the subject of monopolies in the media — is one of the few recent public statements made by Arnault, who is “shy, but self-confident, extremely well-educated but very cold, icy,” according to Nadège Forestier. “Physically, he is very particular,” Bacqué notes. “He’s very tall… he seems to glide on the ground. He looks like a big shark.”

Once a month, Arnault has lunch with his children at 22 Avenue de Montaigne. They spend the holidays together. He has placed them in a strategic position: they talk almost every day. “Everything is taken into account.” Bacqué emphasizes. “The ability to run the company, but also the psychological balance, the ability to work. The character.”

“He puts them to the test, puts them in competition… but nothing indicates that the day he chooses one, the others will accept [the decision]” Minc says. “Since all five are in the company and since they’re all good, the decision isn’t clear. Any of the five could succeed him, so it’s going to be complicated. In addition, the five kids come from two different marriages, which further complicates things. So, his only problem is the choice of successor. But otherwise, he’s in top form — he plays tennis every day. He feels that he can continue for many years.”

The paradox of high-end items Bernard Arnault sensed — when he acquired Dior and LVMH in the 1980s — that the luxury sector wasn’t limited to elite minorities and that it could be a fabulous business success. There’s now a boom in the sector, linked to its popularization, but also to an increase in potential clients: the rich. Every day, there are more and more rich people in more and more countries. The Chinese market is particularly decisive, especially following the reopening of the country after the pandemic. Claudia D'Arpizio and Federica Levato, from the consulting firm Bain & Company, have analyzed the recovery of the luxury sector after Covid-19 “The elements that boosted luxury spending in 2022 — as in the current year — were: consumers’ desire to live lost experiences (i.e. the culture of 'you only live once’), the savings accumulated during Covid-19 and the appetite for luxury purchases for investment purposes and resale opportunities. Despite possible bumps along the road, luxury is in an excellent position in the medium-term.” In 2021, there were 62.5 million millionaires in the world, according to a study by Crédit Suisse… 52% more than the previous year. In 2026, it’s expected that there will be 87 million. The number of super-rich people — those who have fortunes that exceed $50 million — was 264,200 in 2021. This population is expected to reach 385,000 by 2026. D'Arpizio and Levato calculate that, in 2030, luxury market value could reach between $580 and $620 billion, 60% more than the value of the market in 2022. Meanwhile, the consumer base could expand to 500 million customers. Exclusivity can be widespread: another key to Arnault's success.

Through the collaboration, LVMH is looking to enhance its design pipeline by integrating advanced 3D technology and capitalizing on the expertise of Epic Games. Their shared objective is to push the boundaries of customer engagement through Epic’s suite of tools, including the real-time 3D creation tool, Unreal Engine, and the 3D modeling technology, Reality Capture.

LVMH will also use Epic’s Twinmotion and MetaHuman technology to develop a range of immersive experiences, including virtual fitting rooms and fashion shows, 360-view product carousels, augmented reality (AR) experiences, and digital twins for physical items.

The announcement was made at the LVMH-sponsored VivaTech trade event, where attendees could embark on a virtual journey through Louis Vuitton’s fall 2023 men’s show that took place in January. Future initiatives may include immersive workshop tours and digital fashion shows.

“The partnership with Epic Games will accelerate our expertise in 3D tools and ecosystems, from the creation of new collections to ad campaigns and to our maisons’ websites. We will also engage more effectively with young generations who are very much at ease with these codes and uses,” said LVMH Group Managing Director Antonio Belloni.

In addition, the company is launching the Asnières immersion experience, a virtual reality tour of the Louis Vuitton universe. Users can engage in the manufacturing process, gaining insights into the craftsmanship.

LVMH also announced Wednesday (June 14) the implementation of contactless payment solutions.

“The introduction of Tap to Pay on iPhone in LVMH U.S. stores will contribute to offering our customers a purchase experience that is fluid, transparent and protected,” said Franck Le Moal, LVMH Group IT director, in a statement.

In the upcoming months, select Louis Vuitton, Christian Dior Couture, Celine, Sephora, and Tiffany stores in the U.S. will introduce contactless payment options, including Apple Pay and other digital wallets compatible with iPhones."

LVMH owner Bernard Arnault visits China after luxury spending rebound - CNN,"Wed, 28 Jun 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vMjAyMy8wNi8yOC9lY29ub215L2NoaW5hLWx2bWgtY2VvLWJlcm5hcmQtYXJuYXVsdC12aXNpdC1pbnRsLWhuay9pbmRleC5odG1s0gFYaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAuY25uLmNvbS9jbm4vMjAyMy8wNi8yOC9lY29ub215L2NoaW5hLWx2bWgtY2VvLWJlcm5hcmQtYXJuYXVsdC12aXNpdC1pbnRsLWhuaw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Hong Kong CNN —

Bernard Arnault, chairman and CEO of LVMH (LVMHF), has arrived in China for his first visit to the country since the end of its strict Covid restrictions, after his company posted a jump in sales driven by a rapid rebound in Chinese spending on luxury goods.

The French billionaire is the latest in a string of prominent business leaders to have visited China, following trips by Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk and JP Morgan (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon last month. Beijing has been wooing global CEOs in an effort to arrest a slump in business confidence and to divide Western businesses from governments on their policy toward China.

Arnault, who has recently been surpassed by Musk as the richest person in the world, was spotted at several shopping malls in downtown Beijing on Tuesday, according to state media reports, citing photos on Chinese social media.

Privately-owned business magazine Caijing said the French entrepreneur inspected several brand stores owned by LVMH, including Christian Dior and Bulgari, in the WF Central and SKP malls, citing photos taken by local residents.

LVMH didn’t immediately respond to a CNN request for comment.

LVMH reported its first-quarter sales surged 17% from a year ago, beating analyst expectations, driven by a rebound in China’s luxury market from the decline it experienced during the pandemic.

The company had registered “some pretty nice pick up in China, which bodes well for the rest of the year,” its chief financial officer Jean-Jacques Guiony told analysts during a quarterly sales call in April.

Consumers were returning to the company’s stores, and online sales were picking up, he said.

“We definitely see a normalization of this market… We are extremely hopeful and should benefit from a strong push from mainland China in 2023.”

Beijing called an end to its stringent and often oppresive zero-Covid policy in December, which resulted in an initial burst in consumer activity following three years of rolling lockdowns. Luxury goods spending bounced back more quickly than any other sector in the first quarter.

Although the economic momentum has lost steam in the past couple of months, growth in luxury goods sales has accelerated.

According to government statistics released this month, retail sales of jewelry, gold and silver surged 19.5% in the first five months of 2023 from a year ago, the biggest jump among all categories for goods.

China was one of the world’s largest luxury goods markets before Covid hit. Bain & Co. estimated earlier this year that Chinese consumer spending accounted for around 17% of the global luxury market in 2022. That represented a decrease from 35% in 2019.

But the momentum is set to resume this year, as local consumer appetite remains strong and China recovers from the impact of Covid, the consulting firm said in a report in February.

“Compared to other emerging markets, China is a behemoth for luxury growth,” it said, adding that the country has a larger number of middle- and high-income consumers.

Charm offensive

Arnault’s visit also comes as Beijing woos global CEOs to appease fears about its unfriendly policies to foreign capital. Business confidence has slumped after Chinese authorities raided several foreign consultancies, leaving Western companies uneasy about their future in the country.

The deteriorating sentiment has exacerbated the country’s economic woes, resulting in a sharp drop in private-sector investment and a rise in unemployment.

Late last month, Musk visited China for the first time in three years and met a string of senior officials, who encouraged him to boost investment and operations in the country.

Top Chinese leaders are also trying to split businesses from governments on their China policy, in order to push back against efforts by Western nations to “de-risk” from the Chinese economy.

On Tuesday, Chinese Premier Li Qiang said at a World Economic Forum event that “de-risking” decisions should be made by companies rather than governments.

“Some people in the West are hyping up so-called concepts of reducing dependency [on China] and de-risking [from China]. I would say these concepts are false propositions,” Li said.

“It is businesses that are the most sensitive [to such risks] and are hence in the best position to assess such risks. They should be left to come to their own conclusion and make their own choice,” he said.

“Governments and relevant organizations should not overreach themselves.”

LVMH Tops $500 Billion Market Cap - Global Finance,"Mon, 05 Jun 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vZ2ZtYWcuY29tL2NhcGl0YWwtcmFpc2luZy1jb3Jwb3JhdGUtZmluYW5jZS9ldS1sdm1oLWhpdHMtNTAwLWJpbGxpb24tbWFya2V0LWNhcC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LVMH, the French luxury empire behind brands such as Louis Vuitton, Christian Dior, Moët & Chandon and jewelers Bulgari and Tiffany, has become the first European company to surpass a $500 billion market valuation. Shares of the Paris-listed conglomerate have surged about 23% this year, making it one of the 10 most valuable companies in the world and catapulting its founder and CEO, Bernard Arnault, into the top position on the Forbes World’s Billionaires list, ahead of Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos.

He might sit there for a very long time.

Despite the Covid-19 pandemic, war and high inflation, luxury goods sales have been on a roll. In April, LVMH reported a 17% year-over-year increase in first-quarter revenues, more than twice what analysts expected, with a major boost coming from the reopening of China after Covid-19 restrictions were lifted. Still, LVMH has proved to be singularly impervious to economic downturns, says Thomaï Serdari, professor of marketing and director of the Fashion and Luxury MBA at the Leonard N. Stern School of Business at New York University.

“LVMH comprises 75 brands across a variety of sectors,” Serdari observes, spanning “wines and spirits, fashion and leather goods, perfume and cosmetics, watches and jewelry, travel and hospitality, retailing and media. Risk is spread out across these sectors, with each following a different life cycle and responding to different macroeconomic pressures.”

Formed in 1987 with the merger of Louis Vuitton and Moët Hennessy, some brands under the LVMH umbrella date back centuries. Yet the company keeps reinventing itself, Serdari notes. “This is an organization that knows how to capitalize on brand power through acquisitions, capital infrastructure projects and innovations in the area of workforce training and development,” she says.

Crucially, the group has mastered the art of turning fashion into entertainment perhaps better than any of its competitors. “Through its portfolio of brands, it can address the wants of consumers from the bottom of the luxury pyramid all the way to the top, including the accessible, aspirational and absolute segments,” says Serdari. That being the case, she adds, it is hard to predict the world event that could put a stop to LVMH’s growth."
LVMH Will Spend $164 Million to Sponsor the 2024 Olympic Games in Paris: Report - Robb Report,"Thu, 15 Jun 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vcm9iYnJlcG9ydC5jb20vbGlmZXN0eWxlL3Nwb3J0cy1sZWlzdXJlL2x2bWgtc3BvbnNvci1wYXJpcy0yMDI0LW9seW1waWNzLTEyMzQ4NTYzOTAv0gFgaHR0cHM6Ly9yb2JicmVwb3J0LmNvbS9saWZlc3R5bGUvc3BvcnRzLWxlaXN1cmUvbHZtaC1zcG9uc29yLXBhcmlzLTIwMjQtb2x5bXBpY3MtMTIzNDg1NjM5MC9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LVMH may be close to signing a deal of athletic proportions.

On Wednesday, reports surfaced that Antoine Arnault, one of LVMH CEO Bernard Arnault’s five children, could soon close on a high-profile agreement that would see the company sponsor the 2024 Paris Olympic games. The 46-year-old is head of image at LVMH and is reportedly negotiating the promotion of the company’s brands, which include Louis Vuitton and Dior, as well as its Champagne offerings. A source familiar with the group’s discussions claims the deal could cost the Arnaults €150 million, or $164 million at current exchange.

The eldest Arnault’s son reportedly wants to use the event to help convey LVMH’s role as a leader of craftsmanship and French heritage. The aim is to do so without excessive brand logo displays that might “cheapen” its image. With that said, LVMH’s involvement in the 2024 Olympics could see high-profile social media and other campaigns for its leading labels. A similar concept was introduced at the FIFA World Cup in Qatar last November, where fans saw soccer champs Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo face off in a game of chess in a Louis Vuitton campaign ad.

Although reports of viewership for the 2022 Beijing Olympics saw an average total audience of just 11.4 million viewers—its lowest U.S. rating ever, according to NPR—Antoine remains hopeful about next year’s games. “It will likely be the most-watched event in the history of television, in the history of the games—a spectacular event,” he told Reuters in an interview. Steve Martin, CEO of Saatchi Sport & Entertainment, also claims that while LVMH is already linked to France, a formal sponsorship would distinguish the company from its peers. “I think it’s a very compelling way to do it—in their own backyard,” he says.

France has recently made headlines for street protests, which some fear could potentially hinder the games. Even LVMH had trouble avoiding pension reform protests this spring, when Bernard’s face appeared on placards and protestors swarmed LVMH’s headquarters as a call to action for the wealthy to help finance the state pension system. “If we get involved it would be to help out,” says LVMH fashion group CEO Sidney Toledano in a statement.

Tony Estanguet, president of the 2024 games chimed in on the event’s potential sponsorship deal with LVMH last week. “It takes time, but we want to make sure this partnership makes sense and is balanced,” he told Business of Fashion. Considering all the possibilities (good and bad), that sounds like a smart idea."

The Louis Vuitton and Dior parent company will utilize Epic’s suite of tools, including its real-time 3D creation tool Unreal Engine, as well as its 3D modelling tech Reality Capture. It will also utilize Epic’s Twinmotion and MetaHuman technology to create virtual fitting rooms and fashion shows, 360-view product carousels, AR experiences and digital twins for physical items.

The partnership will allow the company to create new experiences for its customers in virtual worlds. One of the first will be on display at the LVMH-sponsored VivaTech trade event.

Visitors to the conference will be able to virtually experience Louis Vuitton’s fall 2023 men’s show. Using Epic’s Unreal Engine 5, MetaHuman technology and Reality Capture, the company developed a six-minute immersive experience inside the show that took place in January. Users will be able to journey through the seven rooms of the set designed by director Michel Gondry, and see a selection of looks from the collection created by guest designer Colm Dillane.

The company is also looking to create more experiences like this, and could include more immersive experiences such as workshop tours — key for a company that is keen to put a heavy focus on its hand craftsmanship — or digital fashion shows in the future.

“The partnership with Epic Games will accelerate our expertise in 3D tools and ecosystems, from the creation of new collections to ad campaigns and to our maisons’ websites. We will also engage more effectively with young generations who are very much at ease with these codes and uses,” said LVMH group managing director Antonio Belloni.

“With this partnership, we will work with LVMH’s designers to transform physical and digital product creation using Epic’s suite of advanced creator tools. We are excited to accelerate the group’s adoption of Unreal Engine, Reality Capture, Twinmotion and MetaHuman technology, and help LVMH’s global brands engage with customers through immersive digital experiences,” says Bill Clifford, vice president of Unreal Engine at Epic Games.

The company is also debuting its Asnières immersion experience, a virtual reality tour that allows customers to explore the Louis Vuitton universe. Users will be able to participate in each step of the manufacturing process and observe the materials and finishes of Louis Vuitton products.

Also at VivaTech, LVMH revealed it will roll out contactless payments across iPhones and credit cards in the U.S. later this year. The tech will first be available in Sephora, Christian Dior, Celine, Tiffany & Co. and Louis Vuitton stores.

Adding the popular pay option will create a frictionless payment option for in-store customers, with no payment ceiling, as well as additional personalized product tools. It’s the next step in upgrading its clienteling strategy.

Introducing the new payment tech “will contribute to offering our customers a purchase experience that is fluid, transparent and protected. This solution also reflects the growing demand among our customers for contactless payment and digital wallet transactions,” added LVMH Group IT director Franck Le Moal.

The increasingly high-profile VivaTech will draw the likes of marquee names including French president Emmanuel Macron and Elon Musk to Paris for the four-day tech conference.

VivaTech will also see Dior unveil virutal consultations through augmented reality, through a partnership with Bambuser and Perfect Corp.

LVMH will announce on Thursday the winner of its annual Innovation Award at VivaTech.

During the Viva Technology 2023 in Paris, LVMH and Fortnite creator Epic Games team up to fashion a series of virtual experiences for the brands of the Group’s, including creating virtual fitting rooms, runway shows, 360 product carousels, augmented reality, metaverse experiences, and digital twins. LVMH brands such as Louis Vuitton, Bulgari, FENDI, and Dior are set to be empowered by Epic Games’ 3D creation tools such as Unreal Engine, Reality Capture, Twinmotion, and MetaHuman technology to unlock the Maisons’ gaming and virtual prowess and reach out to a wider audience through 3D and the booming augmented and virtual realities.

During VivaTech, held between June 14th and 17th, 2023 at Paris Expo Porte de Versailles, LVMH has already usurped the chance to showcase what its teaming up with Epic Games could look like. Inside the Dream Box, a 600-square-meter space dedicated to LVMH, the brands of the Group adopt virtual reality and 3D to excite their visitors, such as Louis Vuitton’s VR headset which takes the visitors on a personal tour of the historic workshops and the founder’s family home to Asnières. Fendi does the same using augmented reality and brings ‘omnichannel’ to life by escorting the visitors into the Maison’s headquarters in Rome as they put on the headsets.

LVMH and Epic Games have teamed up before

Even before the announcement at Viva Technology, LVMH has already collaborated with Epic Games for its 3D creation tools. In VivaTech 2022, Epic Games devised a metaverse experience for Bulgari, dubbed ‘Virtual Rome’, using its Unreal Engine 5, resulting in a hyperrealistic, dreamlike city of the Maison in the heart of Rome. In the same year, LVMH also presented Livi, its first virtual ambassador developed and brought to virtual life thanks to Unreal Engine and MetaHuman technology, Epic’s framework for creating highly realistic digital humans.

In 2023, Louis Vuitton spotlights the ‘Digital Show Experience’ at the LVMH Pavilion in VivaTech, designed using Epic’s Unreal Engine 5, MetaHuman technology, and Reality Capture. The show also comes with Louis Vuitton arcade machines created by Flex Arcade for the tech event. It generates a six-minute interactive and immersive experience that allows the visitors to relive the 2023 Fall-Winter Men’s show of the Maison, which took place at the Louvre Cour Carrée in January 2023. Along with the virtual experience, visitors can enjoy the viewing of the Louis Vuitton men’s collection as they virtually journey through the seven rooms in the décor of the show.

Epic’s graphics platform Unreal Engine, for example, can be used for creating “digital twins”, which let clients see how a physical product will look and behave before it’s been manufactured.

French luxury goods group LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE has paired up with Epic Games Inc., creator of Fortnite, to draw in customers with fitting rooms and fashion shows in virtual worlds.

LVMH Group managing director Toni Belloni said Epic’s tools will also help the company “engage more effectively with young generations who are very much at ease with these codes and uses”.

Epic chief executive officer Tim Sweeney has been one of the most enthusiastic supporters of the metaverse, envisioned as an immersive version of the internet, where people interact, play games or complete tasks as a digital avatar. Epic’s Fortnite has rapidly evolved from a popular multiplayer video game into an online space where people socialise and big-name musicians host virtual concerts. The company’s metaverse strategy also includes software tools, which provide the building blocks for virtual design and digital advertisements.

As Epic and rival Roblox Corp. build out their versions of the metaverse, brands have been staking their turf in these virtual worlds where younger audiences congregate. Epic joined with Ferrari two years ago to bring a highly realistic version of a Ferrari 296 GTB to Fortnite, allowing players to zip around their cartoonish world in style.

Meanwhile, Roblox has become a magnet for high-end fashion brands, including Ralph Lauren Corp., which debuted its first digital fashion line on the site in 2021. Tommy Hilfiger and Gucci also have a presence there, and supermodel Karlie Kloss launched a virtual runway on Roblox in 2022 along with five digital pop-up stores to promote her virtual apparel."

Here's Why Momentum in LVMH-Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SA (LVMUY) Should Keep going - Yahoo Finance,"Thu, 29 Jun 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9oZXJlcy13aHktbW9tZW50dW0tbHZtaC1tb2V0LTEyNTAwNzIzNi5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Most of us have heard the dictum ""the trend is your friend."" And this is undeniably the key to success when it comes to short-term investing or trading. But it isn't easy to ensure the sustainability of a trend and profit from it.

Often, the direction of a stock's price movement reverses quickly after taking a position in it, making investors incur a short-term capital loss. So, it's important to ensure that there are enough factors -- such as sound fundamentals, positive earnings estimate revisions, etc. -- that could keep the momentum in the stock going.

Our ""Recent Price Strength"" screen, which is created on a unique short-term trading strategy, could be pretty useful in this regard. This predefined screen makes it really easy to shortlist the stocks that have enough fundamental strength to maintain their recent uptrend. Also, the screen passes only the stocks that are trading in the upper portion of their 52-week high-low range, which is usually an indicator of bullishness.

There are several stocks that passed through the screen and LVMH-Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SA (LVMUY) is one of them. Here are the key reasons why this stock is a solid choice for ""trend"" investing.

A solid price increase over a period of 12 weeks reflects investors' continued willingness to pay more for the potential upside in a stock. LVMUY is quite a good fit in this regard, gaining 0.6% over this period.

However, it's not enough to look at the price change for around three months, as it doesn't reflect any trend reversal that might have happened in a shorter time frame. It's important for a potential winner to maintain the price trend. A price increase of 6.1% over the past four weeks ensures that the trend is still in place for the stock of this company.

Moreover, LVMUY is currently trading at 83.6% of its 52-week High-Low Range, hinting that it can be on the verge of a breakout.

Looking at the fundamentals, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which means it is in the top 20% of more than the 4,000 stocks that we rank based on trends in earnings estimate revisions and EPS surprises -- the key factors that impact a stock's near-term price movements.

Story continues

The Zacks Rank stock-rating system, which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive externally-audited track record, with Zacks Rank #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>

Another factor that confirms the company's fundamental strength is its Average Broker Recommendation of #1 (Strong Buy). This indicates that the brokerage community is highly optimistic about the stock's near-term price performance.

So, the price trend in LVMUY may not reverse anytime soon.

In addition to LVMUY, there are several other stocks that currently pass through our ""Recent Price Strength"" screen. You may consider investing in them and start looking for the newest stocks that fit these criteria.

This is not the only screen that could help you find your next winning stock pick. Based on your personal investing style, you may choose from over 45 Zacks Premium Screens that are strategically created to beat the market.

However, keep in mind that the key to a successful stock-picking strategy is to ensure that it produced profitable results in the past. You could easily do that with the help of the Zacks Research Wizard. In addition to allowing you to backtest the effectiveness of your strategy, the program comes loaded with some of our most successful stock-picking strategies.

LVMH Expands Partnership With Epic Games | BoF - The Business of Fashion,"Wed, 14 Jun 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzb2ZmYXNoaW9uLmNvbS9uZXdzL3RlY2hub2xvZ3kvbHZtaC1leHBhbmRzLXBhcnRuZXJzaGlwLXdpdGgtZXBpYy1nYW1lcy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LVMH is increasing its use of Epic Games’ technology to create new virtual experiences across its brands, such as virtual fitting rooms and fashion shows and digital twins, the luxury conglomerate announced on Wednesday at the Viva Technology conference in Paris.

One of the first rollouts under the strategic partnership is currently happening at Viva Technology. Louis Vuitton is hosting a digital show experience at LVMH’s pavilion, where visitors can rewatch an interactive version of the brand’s fall/winter 2023 fashion show.

LVMH previously worked with Epic Games on similar experiences. At last year’s Viva Technology conference, Bulgari staged a virtual presentation called “Virtual Rome” using Epic’s 3D-creation tool Unreal Engine 5. Louis Vuitton used the same software, along with Epic’s MetaHuman technology, to release a virtual ambassador named Livi during the same time.

In another bid to use technology to engage its customers, LVMH announced on Wednesday that it will introduce contactless payments — including Apple Pay and other digital wallets using iPhones — at select Louis Vuitton, Christian Dior Couture, Celine, Sephora and Tiffany & Co. stores in the US later this year.

How did Bernard Arnault make his money? - Fortune,"Thu, 01 Jun 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vZm9ydHVuZS5jb20vZXVyb3BlLzIwMjMvMDYvMDEvaG93LWRpZC1sdm1oLWJpbGxpb25haXJlLWNlby1iZXJuYXJkLWFybmF1bHQtbWFrZS1oaXMtbW9uZXkv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The founder and CEO of the luxury powerhouse LVMH, Bernard Arnault, has once again lost his crown as the richest person on the planet—but the billionaire is in no need of sympathy.

Tech tycoon Elon Musk dethroned the French businessman from the top spot after shares of the latter’s LVMH tumbled by 2.6% on Wednesday.

Meanwhile Musk, the owner of Tesla and Twitter, saw his wealth jump 40.3% this year after shares of the electric car maker rose by about 24% in May.

According to a Bloomberg Billionaires tally, Musk’s net worth is now about $192 billion, compared to Arnault’s $187 billion.

The two have been playing a game of tug-of-war for the title of world’s richest person for over a year now, so Musk—who lost the prime position in very similar circumstances back in December 2022 when Tesla’s share price dropped—shouldn’t sit too comfortably.

Earlier this year in April, Arnault saw his fortune surpass $200 billion for the first time before losing more than $11 billion in a single day the following month due to a share price bloodbath.

But for the average person—who earns less than £40,000 in the U.K., or around $60,000 in the U.S—the current small dip in Arnault’s fortune is more money than they’ll see in a lifetime.

So how exactly did he become so rich in the first place?

An early taste for entrepreneurialism

In 1971, Arnault kick-started his career by working at his father’s real estate company, where he proved he had an entrepreneurial mind from a young age: A 25-year-old Arnault convinced his father to sell the construction side of the business and shift its focus to property.

He then traveled to the States in the hopes of growing his father’s empire there, but instead was inspired by a taxi driver (who knew French couture, but not the French president) to go back home and forge a name for himself in the luxury sector.

This is where Arnault’s big break becomes a big mystery.

Some reports claim that the then-35-year-old businessman used $15 million from the family business to buy the failing luxury goods company that owned the fashion brand Christian Dior, Boussac Saint-Frères, in 1984.

Strangely, other reports claim that he acquired the near-bankrupt textile company for a ceremonious 1 franc.

However much he paid, Arnault took control of Boussac along with all of its assets—including Christian Dior, the department store Le Bon Marché, the retail shop Conforama, and the nappy manufacturer Peaudouce.

Fortune has reached out to LVMH to clarify the mysterious circumstances surrounding Dior’s acquisition —which now controls 41.4% of LVMH.

Arnault, “the Terminator”

Following Arnault’s buyout of Boussac, the billionaire fired 9,000 people working for the company, sold off most of the group’s assets (except the Dior brand), and earned the nickname “the Terminator.”

But his tough approach worked: By 1987, the company started making profits, reportedly generating $112 million in earnings from a revenue stream of $1.9 billion.

He then set his eyes on Dior’s perfume division, which had been sold to Louis Vuitton Moët Hennessy.

It was then that a series of hostile takeovers and bold moves at the luxury powerhouse began—and saw Arnault come up on top.

But first, let’s rewind to the birth of LVMH: In 1987 Henry Racamier, president of Louis Vuitton, and Alain Chevalier, CEO of Moët Hennessy, teamed up to form the luxury group Louis Vuitton Moët Hennessy.

Within months of the merger Racamier and Chevalier fell out, so by the summer of ’89, Racamier had invited Arnault to invest in LVMH and help oust Moët’s chief.

But after tackling the first order of business, Arnault ousted Racamier too (from his own family business, no less). He spent $2.6 billion buying up shares in order to become the company’s largest shareholder, and by 1989 became its chairman and CEO.

In the years that followed, he continued to buy brands to bring them into the fold, and even secretly acquired a 20% stake in Hermès through its subsidiaries and via equity swaps.

LVMH’s success

Today, LVMH has some 75 luxury brands in its portfolio and, under Arnault’s leadership, has grown to become the largest company by market capitalization in Europe.

Just last month, the Paris-headquartered conglomerate became the first European company ever to cross $500 billion in market valuation.

Its success directly impacts the wallet of Arnault, whose wealth is largely tied to LVMH’s shares, including a 97.5% stake in Dior.

And the 74-year-old businessman shows no signs of reining it in.

Although his five ultrawealthy children—all of whom hold senior roles at LVMH brands—are vying to one day take over, LVMH recently hiked its age limit for chief executives from 75 to 80.

Really, he’s “just getting started.” Reportedly, Arnault told the FT, without a shred of irony, “We’re still small… We are number one, but we can go further.”"
LVMH's Bernard Arnault Makes Surprise Visit to Beijing - WWD,"Tue, 27 Jun 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3dkLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy1uZXdzL2dvdmVybm1lbnQtdHJhZGUvbHZtaHMtYmVybmFyZC1hcm5hdWx0LWJlaWppbmctdmlzaXQtcG9zdC1jb3ZpZC0xMjM1NzE1Njc5L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"SHANGHAI — Bernard Arnault, chairman and chief executive officer of LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, landed in Beijing on Tuesday, visiting key retail locations in the country’s capital city.

For his first post-pandemic China visit, Arnault made stops at SKP Beijing, China World Mall and WF Central in downtown Beijing and conducted store visits at LVMH brands such as Dior, Tiffany & Co., Louis Vuitton, Loro Piana, Fendi and Bulgari.

According to social media posts shared on Xiaohongshu, the social-commerce platform, Arnault was accompanied by his daughter, Delphine Arnault, chairman and CEO of Christian Dior Couture; his youngest son, Jean Arnault, director of marketing and development, Louis Vuitton watches, and other top executives at LVMH.

According to Xiaohongshu, Arnault spent a particular amount of time at Dior boutiques. He also made a quick stop at Hermès‘ SKP Beijing store.

Xiaohongshu

The Arnault entourage also stopped at The Espace Louis Vuitton in Beijing, a cultural and art space adjacent to the China World Mall that opened in 2017.

An LVMH spokesperson declined to comment on Arnault’s China itinerary, but it is believed the LVMH chief will travel to Chengdu, then Shanghai, both key retail hubs for the luxury goods conglomerate in China.

In April, Arnault and senior members of the LVMH management team met with Wang Wentao, China’s Minster of Commerce, in Paris. Arnault revealed that LVMH will participate in the sixth China International Import Expo in Shanghai later this year. Wang expressed his satisfaction with the strength and diversity of the world’s largest luxury group’s commitment to China, praising the “many commercial and cultural contributions” made by various brands under the group.

Arnault’s China visit comes after a series of high-profile trips made by luxury executives to the country in recent months. Last Feburary, François-Henri Pinault, chairman and CEO of Kering, became the first luxury executive to visit China since the country reopened last December.

Arnault’s expected China visit was first reported by Reuters earlier this month.

China’s post-COVID-19 recovery helped lift LVMH’s first-quarter revenue by 17 percent. Asia, excluding Japan, registered 14 percent growth in the first quarter. Despite a swift rebound for the first half of 2023, an impending slowdown in the market meant that luxury players will continue to court big spenders in a bid to sustain the high level of growth seen during the past decade.

Louis Vuitton and Dior, two of the largest brands at LVMH, have been revamping their existing flagships and opening up exclusive salons to better serve super VIPs in China."
LVMH teams up with Epic Games and Nike reveals Fortnite collab: Web3 drops of the week - Jing Daily,"Sun, 25 Jun 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vamluZ2RhaWx5LmNvbS9wb3N0cy9sdm1oLWVwaWMtZ2FtZXMtbmlrZS1mb3J0bml0ZS1jb2xsYWItd2ViMy1kcm9wcy1vZi10aGUtd2Vla9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Epic Games is taking big strides this week, with both the game developer company and its subsidiary platform Fortnite entering into ground-breaking partnerships with LVMH and Nike — two businesses on opposite sides of the fashion spectrum, but equally as influential.

Elsewhere, the iconic Smiley IP is collaborating with metaverse footwear startup Space Runners on a new project. A 50-year-old legend in the offline world, is Smiley on its way to dominating the virtual one, too?

Turning to China, the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) at the expense of the metaverse is gathering pace as more brands invest resources in AI following the technology’s countrywide boom. Bold, the venture capital fund of L’Oréal, the world’s biggest cosmetics business, is the latest to invest in the trend, backing AI-powered, content-creation startup Rembrand in a seed round that closed last week.

But for this week, here's the roundup of the biggest Web3 drops taking over the virtual space right now.

What happened

Luxury fashion conglomerate and parent company of brands including Louis Vuitton, Dior, and Fendi, LVMH has entered into a partnership with none other than game software developer Epic Games.

The collaboration, which was announced on June 14 at Viva Technology Paris, will see the two industry giants join forces to create consumer experiences and implement new tools into LVMH’s design pipeline, including Epic Games’ Unreal Engine, a 3D graphics program that was also recently deployed by Puma to create its Black Station 2 experience.

The verdict

It’s a big step for the metaverse — waning audience interest this year has generated huge speculation about the space’s longevity and its potential decline. LVMH’s investment in the segment couldn’t have arrived at a better time.

LVMH is targeting a vast audience base, from Gen-Z consumers to ultra-wealthy collectors, by adopting different approaches to the metaverse across its divisions. With behemoths like LVMH becoming key enablers in the metaverse fashion landscape, metaverse skeptics are slowly but surely being proved wrong.

What happened

Earlier this week, sportswear behemoth and metaverse pioneer Nike teased its latest digital activation in collaboration with gaming platform Fortnite: an NFT-powered sneaker hunt titled Airphoria. The short promo video went live on June 16 via Nike’s social channels, with the brand stating that the “ultimate Sneakerhunt begins” on June 20.

The reveal caused the Web3 and gaming community to go wild with speculation about what the project might entail. Since its release, the in-game sneaker hunt event has featured Nike-designed NFTs, skins, cosmetics, and special rewards within the online video game Fortnite .

Users didn't need to pay with crypto, pay gas fees, or have a Metamask wallet to participate.

The verdict

Epic Games’ foray into collaborations with franchises like Nike and LVMH heralds a promising future for the metaverse and luxury fashion, as long as it’s executed right. With great exposure comes the pressure to deliver a seamless and carefully considered experience, minus the clunkiness of past Web3 launches. With 250 million active Fortnite players , it's a huge move in the space for Nike.

Nike came under fire last month after its DotSwoosh channel failed to handle the volume of visitors for its OF1 drop. Will tapping a program as established as Fortnite and Unreal Engine eliminate the risk of similar hiccups this time around?

Play! Pop! Go! is foreshadowing a future of merged physical and digital fashion collections. Photo: Play! Pop! Go!

What happened

The brainchild of creative polymath artist Amber Park, digital fashion brand Play! Pop! Go! launched another physical fashion capsule following its release in April, this time for Pre-Fall 2023 on June 21. The Playwear collection connects the digital and physical, encouraging consumers to have a gamified approach to shopping and self-expression.

The verdict

Lil Nas X-approved fashion playground Play! Pop! Go! is one of the leaders in the phygital fashion space. Following on from April's collection already is reflective of its backing from the mainstream fashion press; this marks the next step in its evolution of bringing the metaverse to the IRL world.

As a streetwear collection that is able to be understood even by those who are not familiar with metaverse, Play! Pop! Go! is disrupting what it means to be part of Web 3.0. Having an event at PFW Men's also positions the brand within the luxury space — who knows, perhaps a high-fashion collaboration will be on the way soon."
The LVMH 2023 Prize Goes to Satoshi Kuwata of Setchu - Harper's BAZAAR,"Wed, 07 Jun 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhhcnBlcnNiYXphYXIuY29tL2Zhc2hpb24vZGVzaWduZXJzL2E0NDExNjkwOS9sdm1oLTIwMjMtcHJpemUtd2lubmVycy1pbnRlcnZpZXcv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Today in Paris, when actress Gal Gadot presented Satoshi Kuwata of Setchu with the 2023 LVMH Prize, he said, “I was a really naughty boy and my mom was really worried about me.” He was talking about his childhood, but shortly after, when I spoke to him over Zoom, he mentioned his mother again. She had been waiting up late for his call after the ceremony, and when they finally spoke, he could tell she was about to cry.



The LVMH Prize is the biggest, most prestigious prize in fashion for a young designer. With it comes 400,000 euros (equivalent to $429,000) and a year of mentoring from an LVMH executive. Out of 2,400 applicants, nine finalists were selected this year, which is one more than the eight selected in 2022. To be considered, you must be under the age of 40 and have produced at least two ready-to-wear collections. This year’s group, which included Raul Lopez of the beloved New York line Luar and Rachel Scott of Diotima, the first Jamaican brand to be included in the competition, was considered particularly diverse. Four of the finalists were self-taught. Six were over the age of 35 and launched their brands recently.

Saskia Lawaks Satoshi Kuwata with the LVMH 2023 prize

Kuwata, 39, was born in Japan and worked at Givenchy, Christian Dior, Balenciaga, Jil Sander, and Celine before starting Setchu in Milan in 2020. His best-selling garment, the Origami jacket, looks like a tailored blazer, but with pleats reminiscent of the folds of a kimono.

“It is simply East meets West,” he says of his brand, adding that he never wanted it to be eponymous. “I didn’t name my brand after me because the most important thing in fashion is teamwork.”

The team, he explains, consists of everyone from supporters like his mother to the people in the studio with him every day. Setchu isn’t his name, it’s theirs—and he hopes one day it will be world-famous. “I believe that Setchu will be a heritage company,” he told me. “I didn’t put my name because I want my company to be one of the maisons. I want to be in that group. And that’s my goal. I’m thinking of 20 to 30 years from now.”

Saskia Lawaks Kuwata poses with a model wearing his designs, which mix Saville Row tailoring with Japanese tradition.

Creating a new maison in 2023 is a lofty goal for an emerging designer, but it does feel like something LVMH could do. As the world’s largest luxury conglomerate, with over 75 brands from Loewe to Dior, the company launched the prize in 2014 as a way to bolster new talent in a time when small businesses often falter. Past winners include Simon Porte Jacquemus of Jacquemus, whose clothes encapsulate a French joie de vivre as Instagrammable as the Côte d’Azur itself, and Grace Wales Bonner, the British designer whose recent collaborations with Adidas created a Samba sneaker sellout phenomenon.

Asked about his own inspirations, Kuwata mentions the “all-star” cast of designer judges who selected him. “Nicolas Ghesquière is a genius. He is an artist, not a fashion designer. Maria Grazia Chiuri … well, she designs the clothes that people really want to wear. Silvia Fendi has always made playful creations.” Other members included Jonathan Anderson, Kim Jones, and Stella McCartney—as well as Delphine Arnault, Jean-Paul Claverie, Sidney Toledano, and Nigo, the artistic director of Kenzo.

This year’s Karl Lagerfeld special jury award was given to two designers: Julie Pelipas of Bettter and Luca Magliano of Magliano. The former fashion director of Vogue Ukraine, Pelipas created her label as a response to what she saw as an “all talk, no action” approach to sustainability from the industry. Bettter uses an upcycling system that reworks deadstock garments to make inclusive pieces based on a customer’s body metrics. Over Zoom, she said she views her award as significant statement: “The fact that this prize was given to Bettter means the industry is really ready for this.”

As for Magliano, he’s just excited to be able to create more “fucked-up classics” from his eponymous label, now that he has the means to expand his team from its current three-person framework. He and Pelipas will each receive 200,000 euros (equivalent to $214,000) and a yearlong LVMH mentorship.



Saskia Lawaks Luca Magliano of Magliano stands with a model wearing pieces from his collection, which he describes as “fucked-up classics.”

In a statement following the ceremony, Delphine Arnault said, “Today, I am delighted to celebrate the 10th edition of the LVMH Prize and to honor Setchu, whose designs blend great tailoring and elegance, producing collections that are both streamlined and exquisitely cut. The jury has also decided to award the Karl Lagerfeld Prize both to Bettter, for its cutting-edge upcycled creations, and Magliano, a brand that champions casual and poetic designs.” Whether any future maisons have been crowned is to be determined, but the jury’s selections clearly reflect what they see as the future of fashion."

The sources didn’t give a reason for the trip or say where in the country Arnault was likely to visit.

The planned visit for Arnault comes at a critical time for LVMH’s reboot of US jeweller Tiffany , its largest acquisition ever, which it seeks to expand in China as part of a strategy to catch up with larger rival Cartier.

A rebound in China helped lift LVMH’s first-quarter sales, which grew 17 per cent.

Next week, at long last, Pharrell Williams will debut his first collection as Louis Vuitton’s men’s creative director. Rest assured, people will fly across the world to see Williams’ vision displayed in a closely kept outdoor location, not only to take in the pomp of the world’s largest luxury brand flexing its largesse, but also just to say that they were there. These days, that’s not common with fashion shows, which are live-streamed on crystal-clear video (god willing), and documented by front-row regulars who have become skilled photographers as a matter of course.

But Williams’ appointment at the LVMH-owned leather goods house, which generates more than $20 billion a year in annual sales, demarcates a new era in fashion. When you’re dealing with an entity of that size, the only way to get bigger is to bring in someone who is as famous (or nearly as famous) as the logo itself. Williams, the groundbreaking hip-hop multihyphenate producer-artist-entrepreneur, is one of the few people in entertainment who rises to that level."
Deal of the Week: LVMH acquires majority stake in Nuti Ivo to integrate supply chain - just-style.com,"Wed, 07 Jun 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmp1c3Qtc3R5bGUuY29tL25ld3MvbHZtaC1hY3F1aXJlcy1tYWpvcml0eS1zdGFrZS1pbi1udXRpLWl2by10by1pbnRlZ3JhdGUtc3VwcGx5LWNoYWluL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LVMH has acquired leather manufacturer Conceria Nuti (Nuti Ivo).

Each week, Just Style’s editors select a deal that illustrates the themes driving change in our sector. The deal may not always be the largest in value, or the highest profile. But we select it because of what it tells us about where the leading companies are focusing their efforts, and why. We pick apart the deal itself, and the industry theme behind it. This new, thematic deal coverage is driven by our underlying Disruptor data, which tracks all major deals, patents, company filings, hiring patterns and social media buzz across our sectors.

The LVMH Nutri Ivo deal

LVMH Métiers d’Art, which has a presence in the leather, exotic skins and metal sectors, has assumed majority ownership of the Nuti Ivo SpA Group, an Italian company specialising in leather products. The deal was made for an undisclosed sum.

Nuti Ivo has established itself as one of the most prominent leaders in the international tanning industry. The company has long-standing traditions in the manufacturing sector and joins the select group of international companies that are part of LVMH Métiers d’Art.

Why it matters?

Founded in 2015, in order to protect, develop and ensure long-term access to raw materials and artisanal savoir-faire on a global level for luxury players, LVMH Métiers d’Art ensures constant management over the process of creating goods from start to finish, ensuring the sustainability of its supply chain.

GlobalData analyst Louise Deglise-Favre tells Just Style exclusively LVMH Métiers d’Art acquiring a majority stake in Nuti Ivo, a renowned Italian leather manufacturer, fits with its long tradition of using premium Italian leathers for its luxury goods.

She explains: “With this acquisition, LVMH partially vertically integrates a supplier into its value chain, allowing it more control over manufacturing processes. It will also help LVMH expand its production, which will allow it to match the heightened demand it has experienced for its luxury leather goods in the past few years.”

French Luxury Group LVMH Names New Head of Belmond Hospitality Unit - WWD,"Mon, 05 Jun 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiggFodHRwczovL3d3ZC5jb20vYnVzaW5lc3MtbmV3cy9odW1hbi1yZXNvdXJjZXMvbHZtaC1uYW1lcy1kYW4tcnVmZi1jaGllZi1leGVjdXRpdmUtb2ZmaWNlci1iZWxtb25kLWhvc3BpdGFsaXR5LWRpdmlzaW9uLTEyMzU2NzI2Nzcv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS — LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton has named a new head of its Belmond hospitality division, prized for its fleet of marquee properties in a range of standout destinations, as high-end consumers continue to splurge on travel in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic.

Dan Ruff, who has been chief operations officer of Belmond since 2018, will take over as chief executive officer on July 1, succeeding Roeland Vos, who had been in the post since 2015 and steered Belmond through its acquisition by LVMH in 2018.

Ruff reports to Stéphane Rinderknech, who is chairman and CEO of LVMH Hospitality Excellence, in addition to the group’s Perfumes and Cosmetics division.

“After working for more than 20 years in the hospitality industry, Dan will bring a wealth of operational, commercial and asset management expertise,” Rinderknech said in an internal memo seen by WWD.

“Since he joined Belmond five years ago, he has demonstrated a remarkable ability to lead all properties operations, maneuvering through the shockwaves of the pandemic and the spectacular turnaround since 2021,” he continued. “I have no doubt that he will be a great asset to pursue Belmond’s successful journey and take it to the next level.”

Prior to joining Belmond in 2018, the U.S. native held senior roles at Wyndham Hotel Group and Starwood Hotels & Resorts across operations, asset management, and mergers and acquisitions. He will oversee luxury properties including the Cipriani in Venice and the Copacabana Palace in Rio de Janeiro, in addition to the historic Venice Simplon-Orient-Express train.

Ruff’s appointment comes days after LVMH conceded defeat for its Cheval Blanc hotel proposal on Rodeo Drive, after Beverly Hills voters rejected the project. Hôtels Cheval Blanc is run as a separate division within LVMH Hospitality Excellence.

Rinderknech paid tribute to Vos, who joined Belmond after an 18-year career at Starwood Hotels & Resorts.

“As a global recognized industry expert, a great negotiator with a true sense of luxury hospitality and unique human values, Roeland has played a crucial role in the smooth integration of Belmond within the LVMH Group, with a clear focus on elevating operational excellence and brand desirability,” he said."

LVMH CEO Bernard Arnault Was Hailed as the ‘God of Fortunes’ During His Visit to China - Robb Report,"Fri, 30 Jun 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vcm9iYnJlcG9ydC5jb20vbGlmZXN0eWxlL25ld3MvYmVybmFyZC1hcm5hdWx0LWhhaWxlZC1nb2Qtb2YtZm9ydHVuZXMtY2hpbmEtMTIzNDg2MjUwMy_SAWJodHRwczovL3JvYmJyZXBvcnQuY29tL2xpZmVzdHlsZS9uZXdzL2Jlcm5hcmQtYXJuYXVsdC1oYWlsZWQtZ29kLW9mLWZvcnR1bmVzLWNoaW5hLTEyMzQ4NjI1MDMvYW1wLw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"China sees the CEO of LVMH as far more than a billionaire businessman. Following his appearance at Paris Fashion Week, Bernard Arnault took a trip to the East Asian country and was welcomed as some kind of monetary deity.

The 74-year-old spent Wednesday in Chengdu and Thursday in Shanghai. He was reportedly in town to inspect boutiques owned by his French luxury conglomerate, boost team morale, and reiterate the importance of the region. Unwittingly, he was also there for a mini meet-and-greet.

Customers who caught onto the magnate’s whereabouts began to crowd shopping malls to get a glimpse of him. They even went as far as hailing him “the god of fortunes,” quite fitting given he’s held the “world’s richest person” title two times and is worth an estimated $197 billion.

#LVMH owner #BernardArnault is in #China since Tuesday, visiting key retail locations. In April, Arnault met with Wang Wentao, China’s #MinisterofCommerce in Paris.

“The weather was amazing, the mall was packed, Mr. Bernard Arnault was even more gracious, kinder, and happier than the last time he visited,” Molly Wu, general manager of Sino–Ocean Taikoo Li Chengdu, shared on social commerce platform Xiaohongshu. Videos posted to Twitter this week show Arnault being escorted through crowds as he walked through a mall and around town.

Arnault was accompanied by a number of LVMH execs including his only daughter, Delphine Arnault, chairman and CEO of Christian Dior Couture; his youngest son, Jean Arnault, director of marketing and development for Louis Vuitton watches; Michael Schriver, LVMH group president of North Asia; Charles Delapalme, CEO of Christian Dior Couture; and Pietro Beccari, chairman and CEO of Louis Vuitton. He was also joined by the local retail partners.

“The heads of luxury brands want to be on the ground to obtain more firsthand information that will better inform their decision-making process and management strategy,” Ting Zhou, dean of Yaok Institute, said in a statement. “The move is to tell shoppers and local partners that the company is confident and has high hopes for the future of the China market, especially now that the market is experiencing an uneven economic recovery.”

China continues to be a main driver of growth for LVHM, despite the tumultuous economic environment. In fact, the country helped lift the group’s revenue by 17 percent in the first quarter of 2023. Clearly, Chinese shoppers are a fan of LVMH’s brands and perhaps even of Arnault himself. Sources believe the billionaire—or god of fortune, rather—will arrive in Hong Kong on Friday."
Setchu Wins the 2023 LVMH Prize for Young Designers - WWD,"Wed, 07 Jun 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3dkLmNvbS9mYXNoaW9uLW5ld3MvZmFzaGlvbi1zY29vcHMvc2V0Y2h1LXdpbnMtMjAyMy1sdm1oLXByaXplLWZvci15b3VuZy1kZXNpZ25lcnMtMTIzNTY3NjExNS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS — Setchu by Satoshi Kuwata, an industry veteran who has worked for everyone from a Savile Row tailor to luxury sneakers brand Golden Goose, on Wednesday won the 2023 edition of the LVMH Prize for Young Designers at a star-studded ceremony in Paris marking the 10th anniversary of the award.

Milan-based Kuwata beat some 2,400 applicants from 15 countries to walk away with a grand prize of 400,000 euros, plus a year of coaching from experts at luxury giant LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, parent of brands including Vuitton, Guerlain, Dom Pérignon and Sephora.

“I was a really naughty boy and my mom was really worried about me, and now I can make my mom really happy,” the 39-year-old designer said as he accepted the award.

Israeli actress Gal Gadot revealed the winner at Fondation Louis Vuitton in the presence of a jury featuring star designers Maria Grazia Chiuri, Kim Jones, Nigo, Silvia Venturini Fendi, Stella McCartney, Marc Jacobs, Nicolas Ghesquière and Jonathan Anderson.

Rounding out the group were senior executives Delphine Arnault, the force behind the prize and a key talent scout at LVMH; Sidney Toledano, chairman and chief executive officer of LVMH Fashion Group, and Jean-Paul Claverie, an adviser to LVMH chairman Bernard Arnault and LVMH’s head of corporate philanthropy.

Bettter by Ukrainian designer Julie Pelipas and Italian designer Luca Magliano’s Magliano label were the joint winners of the runner-up Karl Lagerfeld Special Jury Prize, presented by Chinese pop star Xin Liu, who drew a gaggle of screaming fans outside the venue.

Both designers will benefit from a grant of 200,000 euros and a one-year mentorship program from the LVMH Group.

Kuwata, who was born in Kyoto, Japan, and moved to London at the age of 21 to pursue a career in fashion, launched unisex label Setchu in 2020 after cutting his teeth at Huntsman in Savile Row during his studies at Central Saint Martins; Gareth Pugh in London; Kanye West and Givenchy in Paris; Edun in New York City, and Golden Goose in Milan.

“I wanted to do my own label since I was a kid, and it was a journey,” he said after taking a break to phone his parents in Japan to tell them the good news. “I just went different places because I knew I needed to do that to make a 360-degree design.”

His clothes are grounded in a deep knowledge and respect for different cultures and crafts, resulting in the brand’s fusion of Japanese and Western concepts in items like foldable jackets in origami-like constructions.

Kuwata said what makes his brand “unique” is a blend of artisanal fabrications, a modernist approach linked to his Japanese identity, and functional details inspired by his passion for fishing, which takes him to far-flung destinations like Gabon.

“It’s impossible to take a big suitcase and you also need to keep a space for fishing gear, but I don’t want to look like a fisherman wearing nylon garments,” he said, demonstrating how he transforms his ribbed sweater with rows of buttons to wear it three different ways.

Having grown up in an area known as the birthplace of Japanese whisky and for its clean water, he is highly attuned to the environmental impact of his brand and is opposed to runway shows. “It’s not really sustainable,” he objected. “I think it’s time to change.”

However, he has old-fashioned ambitions for Setchu. “I want LVMH to teach me how to make it a heritage company for the future. There will be another part,” he promised.

The designer, who runs his brand solo, plans to hire a team with the ambition of growing his e-commerce activity and launching sneakers, other shoes and handbags. “I used to design a lot and I’m good at it. It just needed money,” he said.

Chiuri said she was so impressed by Kuwata’s presentation that she slipped on one of his jackets, pronouncing it as well-made as an haute couture creation.

“It’s magnificent. It’s light, it fits well,” she said. “Everything was perfect. It’s not only about the clothes, it’s more about — in my point of view — philosophy, what it means for him to have clothes, maintain your heritage but in a modern way, timeless, high quality, thinking about the environment.”

Delphine Arnault, who earlier this year was named chairman and CEO of Christian Dior Couture, said the jury was unanimous. “He did an outstanding presentation,” she opined, noting that Kuwata had almost reached the age limit for applicants, although she added: “Mr. Dior started his brand when he was 42, so it gives him hope.”

The LVMH Prize is open to designers under age 40 who have presented and sold at least two collections of women’s, men’s or unisex ready-to-wear. Arnault said she was proud to see how it’s become an industry reference over the last decade.

“There’s been so many amazing designers who have gone through the prize and who have developed their career in a great way, be it in the group or not,” she said, reeling off names including Simon Porte Jacquemus, Marine Serre, Steven Stokey-Daley and Grace Wales Bonner.

Not only are more people than ever applying for the prize, but it has changed in keeping with the industry’s evolution, reflecting luxury’s move toward genderless creations, streetwear and sustainable designs, Arnault noted.

Asked why LVMH decided to raise the endowment of the main prize to 400,000 euros from 300,000 euros previously, and the Karl Lagerfeld prize to 200,000 euros from 150,000 euros, she ventured: “Because of inflation?” The executive made the surprise announcement during the ceremony.

“It hadn’t been raised in a long time and I think that it really helps,” Arnault said, noting that designers struggle with cash flow issues because they have to advance money for fabrics and production before being paid by wholesale buyers, and also need funds to hire staff and hold runway shows. “Most of them have either one or two employees, or zero employees.”

She said it was doubtful whether the prize could evolve in future to include other categories, such as accessories, noting that it was already very time-consuming. And she admitted to feeling a little nostalgic for the days when the late Lagerfeld took part in jury deliberations around lunch with her father, Bernard Arnault.

“I really miss Karl when I live those moments because he was there since Day One; he was so important to the prize,” Arnault reflected. “He was always very generous with his time and his advice.”

Toledano praised this year’s crop for putting the emphasis on sophisticated, wearable designs.

The 2023 edition’s finalists also included U.S.-based brands Luar by Raul Lopez and Diotima by Jamaican designer Rachel Scott; London-based Aaron Esh, and Paolina Russo by Canadian designer Paolina Russo and French designer Lucile Guilmard; Paris-based designer Burç Akyol, and Italian label Quira by Veronica Leoni.

“We’ve had years when people were more focused on streetwear, but this time we saw the return of silhouettes, elegance and materials,” Toledano said. “Some use recycled materials, others don’t. But globally, they have the potential to be great designers.”

Pelipas said she was grateful for the opportunity to introduce her brand, which is rooted in an upcycling system that reworks secondhand garments and deadstock materials.

Now based in London as a result of the Russian invasion of her country, the former fashion director of Vogue Ukraine is looking to make connections that will allow the label to scale and become a solution for the stock currently clogging brands.

“We have a chance to rebuild our system of production and we have to consider that and not ignore it as we did before,” she told WWD. “I hope with this example, the overall industry will shift toward upcycling.”

She plans to invest the prize money into technology. “Right now, we’re in a place where we have all the necessary data, but we need more investment to put it into software and apply it in all the productions we’re working with.”

Picking up his award, Magliano told the crowd of industry heavy hitters: “It’s a beautiful feeling to be seen.” His meticulous take on downbeat, vintage-looking menswear has been gaining traction on the Milan scene, thanks to the Italian designer’s tailoring and color sense.

He plans to hire people for his studio in his native Bologna. “We want to do womenswear. It’s something that we really want to do, so we need to enlarge ourselves,” he said.

Gadot, wearing a black-and-white Dior outfit with stacks of gold Tiffany & Co. bangles, said she was glad to lend visibility to the young designers’ ambitions. “Whenever I have the opportunity to support the new generation, the future artists, the future talent, I will always be happy to do so,” the “Wonder Woman” star told WWD.

As an actress, Gadot is particularly sensitive to the power of clothes. “Oh, wow, it’s big. It’s like a part of the personality of the character. It helps build up and create who the character is, what’s the world she’s living in,” the Tiffany brand ambassador said. “And then on the red carpet, we really get to have fun.”

The industry’s emissions — which account for roughly 2 percent of the world’s total — are still rising. The billions of new garments it produces each year contribute to deforestation, nature loss and water pollution. Most of those T-shirts, dresses and jeans ultimately end up dumped in landfill in poor countries. Meanwhile, the human toll of the industry’s low-cost, high-impact business model has yet to be fully quantified.

The state of affairs is “absolutely unacceptable,” Europe’s environment commissioner Virginijus Sinkevičius said on the sidelines of the Global Fashion Summit this week, adding that Europe’s regulators are set to take action.

It was a message that reverberated across fashion’s flagship sustainability event, where the presence of high profile policymakers from Europe and the US for the first time leant new momentum to old conversations and LVMH’s Antoine Arnault made a surprise call for a new, luxury-focused sustainability pact.

Read on for key takeaways from this week’s annual gathering of fashion’s sustainability power players.

A Luxury-Only Sustainability Pact

LVMH head of image and environment Antoine Arnault headlined one of the most talked about sessions of the summit, addressing criticism of the French giant’s sustainability engagement, proclaiming luxury “sustainable by nature” and calling for a luxury-only sustainability pact.

“I know we were very much criticised a few years ago when we did not sign the famous Fashion Pact,” Arnault told conference attendees, referring to an industry-wide initiative launched by François-Henri Pinault, the CEO of rival French fashion conglomerate Kering, on the same stage four years earlier. “It was, in our opinion, not the right thing to do at that time to be associated with the actors of fast fashion.”

For many in the audience the message jarred, given LVMH’s historic disengagement with industry sustainability initiatives (LVMH noted it does participate in several groups, including the UN-backed Fashion Charter, which it joined in 2021) and flagship brand Louis Vuitton’s latest fashion show, which leaned into the kind of hype fashion entertainment culture that has seen luxury brands issue new products at a faster and faster pace.

Arnault’s distinction between the interests and impact of luxury and lower-cost retailers also played into an emerging debate over how “fast fashion” should be defined as regulators step up their scrutiny of the industry.

Investors seem to be responding to LVMH’s messaging, with the French luxury giant attracting significant interest from fund managers marketing their portfolios as promoters of environmental and social goals, according to a Bloomberg report this week.

Rising Regulation

For years, fashion has been ignored by regulators. Not any more.

The industry is facing 16 pieces of legislation in Europe alone, as policymakers look to crack down on greenwashing and take on throwaway fast fashion.

Commissioner Sinkevičius and Anna Kelles, the New York State assembly member spearheading the New York Fashion Act — a wide-ranging sustainability bill that would impact any large fashion company operating in the state if passed — were both given prominent billing. But the EU’s looming suite of fashion-focused regulations were the biggest focus for the week.

Europe’s policymakers have said they want to “end fast fashion” and are expected to provide details in the coming months on proposed regulations that would introduce design requirements to make clothes longer-lasting and more repairable – and possibly mandate the use of recycled content – a likely ban on the destruction of unsold goods, requirements for brands to take back old clothes to facilitate more recycling, and labelling rules intended to help consumers make better choices.

“We need to design clothes to serve us longer. And if we are tired of them, if we wear them once or twice and we don’t want to wear them again, there has to be a second life for them,” commissioner Sinkevičius said on the summit’s sidelines. “All these piles of waste, they don’t just disappear. They go somewhere, they pollute somewhere.”

Much of that waste is sent to Ghana, dumped in landfill and strewn across beaches, Sammy Oteng, senior community engagement manager at Ghana-based anti-fashion waste advocacy group the Or Foundation, told audience members.

In one of the most powerful and emotionally charged sessions of the week, Oteng doled out examples of clothes waste brought over from Kantamanto market, the massive secondhand clothing market where The Or Foundation focuses its work.

“It’s very disgusting, but this is our reality,” said Oteng.

The organisation is lobbying to ensure regulation intended to tackle fashion’s waste benefits the communities where it ends up, also powerfully raising a point about representation and who gets a say in rules that are going to reshape the whole industry.

We Need to Talk About Marketing

Sustainability conversations often dwell on fashion’s supply chain (where most of its environmental impact takes place) or the problems created when garments are thrown away, but they rarely look at the more intangible role the industry’s marketing machine plays in stoking the underlying problem of overconsumption.

Unless that changes (and with it the industry’s whole business model), fashion will find it “incredibly difficult” to meet its sustainability targets, the UN said in a provocative call for the industry to use its marketing clout to help deliver on climate goals, instead of encouraging behaviour that flouts them.

The UN laid out exactly what that might look like in a playbook published at the summit and designed to outline what fashion communication should look like in order to align with global climate goals. Though not a formal target, it’s a principle enshrined in the Fashion Charter, whose signatories include Kering, H&M Group and Nike.

Recommendations include using advertising to promote more sustainable behaviours like resale, rental and repair and to reduce the desirability of newness. The idea that fashion subvert its sales engine points to just how drastically the industry still needs to change.

“Currently, we have a narrative that is based around newness, immediacy and disposability and we need one that is based on circularity, equity and care,” said Bettina Heller, textiles lead at UNEP.

Missing the Money

On the sidelines, many conversations focused on what was left unsaid on the main stage, where large brands were often allowed to put an optimistic sheen on slow progress without challenge.

What wasn’t much discussed was the question of money — a critical and divisive issue.

Meeting fashion’s sustainability goal is going to cost billions of dollars and most of that is going to need to be spent in the supply chain. Who should pay and how is a live issue made particularly delicate by the broader gloomy economic climate.

Manufacturers say they are facing an impossible squeeze from brands who are demanding lower prices, while also pressing for major eco-investments. But the subject got little air time at the summit.

Until that question of climate funding is really addressed, it’s hard to see action taking place at scale.

Beverly Hills voters reject hotel from Bernard Arnault - Fortune,"Fri, 02 Jun 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vZm9ydHVuZS5jb20vZXVyb3BlLzIwMjMvMDYvMDIvYmV2ZXJseS1oaWxscy1sdXh1cnktaG90ZWwtdm90ZS1yZWplY3RlZC1sdm1oLWJpbGxpb25haXJlLWJlcm5hcmQtYXJuYXVsdC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Rodeo Drive’s storefront windows display the world’s most expensive labels: Gucci handbags, Prada slingback pumps, Chanel perfumes.

It would seem like the perfect location for Bernard Arnault’s exclusive Cheval Blanc hotel. But a majority of voters in Beverly Hills disagreed.

They rejected two ballot measures needed for final approval of the ultra-luxury boutique hotel by LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE, the firm founded by Arnault, the world’s second-richest man.

The referendums trailed by about 80 ballots, or a 1 percentage point margin, according to a final tally released Friday. LVMH has said it will give up on the project once voters opposed it. Jessica Miller, a spokesperson, declined to provide further comment Friday.

The vote revealed a deep rift in the 6-square-mile community, pitting residents eager for the city to earn more revenue and prestige against those who fear the community is being overrun by development. The results defy the Hollywood image of Beverly Hills as an ultra-rich enclave of opulent mansions and fancy cars.

Darian Bojeaux, a lawyer who headed a group called Residents Against Overdevelopment that opposed the hotel, said Beverly Hills is “misunderstood” and that it actually has a quaint village feel.

“We’re not all a bunch of creeps that are just into diamonds and Gucci bags,” said Bojeaux, a 38-year resident. “A lot of us love the quality of life and the beauty of the city. We put that over a brand.”

Manijeh Messa, manager of Bijan, a men’s appointment-only store on Rodeo Drive, expressed shock at the outcome.

“They live in the best place in the world and drive Bentleys and Rolls Royces and still say no,” Messa said.

Jay Luchs, a commercial real estate agent who leases and sells stores on the strip, called voters “bitter and angry” for opposing the Cheval Blanc, which has only a handful of other locations globally, including in Paris where room rates start at 2,400 euros ($2,573).

“Other cities would’ve died to have this,” Luchs said. “It’s a bad message to send to people who want to do business in Beverly Hills.”

This isn’t the first time Beverly Hills voters rejected a hotel. In 2016, they spurned a proposal for a 26-floor tower next to the fabled Beverly Hilton, which has hosted the Golden Globes ceremony for half a century.

LVMH has been one of the biggest investors and property boosters in Beverly Hills, leasing or owning 15 stores for its collection of brands around Rodeo Drive. The proposed hotel would have generated $800 million in revenue for the city over the next 30 years, according to an analysis for the ballot.

More than half of city revenue comes from sales, hotel and business taxes, supporting police, fire and landscaping that contributes to Beverly Hills’ safe and small-town atmosphere. Property taxes account for a third of the city’s income, where the median home price is $6.4 million, according to Redfin data.

Arnault’s firm spent more than $400 million assembling the 1.28 acre (0.52 hectare) property, according to Luchs. He brokered the biggest piece of the project, LVMH’s $245 million purchase in 2018 of a former Brooks Brothers store at the corner of Rodeo and Santa Monica Boulevard.

The hotel faced opposition from several groups with a variety of grievances. A hospitality workers’ union petitioned for the signatures to put the referendum on the ballot, after the city council approved the hotel 4-1. Unite Here Local 11 said it wanted more affordable housing in the project.

Other critics feared more outsiders and tourists, especially with a new subway stop opening near Rodeo Drive in 2025. And some worried about crime, like the 2021 daytime shooting at a restaurant where robbers took a man’s $500,000 watch.

John Mirisch, the only council member who voted no, penned a full-page editorial for the Beverly Hills Weekly that listed 10 reasons to oppose the project, including traffic congestion.

“It’s a sign that many in our community didn’t allow themselves to be manipulated and that they saw through and rejected the arrogance and self-entitlement that fueled this project,” Mirisch said in an email.

Bojeaux said her main objection was the proposed hotel’s height of nine stories in a low-rise area. It would cast a shadow over Rodeo Drive, she said.

“There were so many reasons to vote no — something for everyone,” she said. “I’m not saying all people in designer clothes are bad.”"
LVMH bets on repair platform Save Your Wardrobe with Innovation Prize - Vogue Business,"Thu, 15 Jun 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZvZ3VlYnVzaW5lc3MuY29tL2NvbXBhbmllcy9sdm1oLWJldHMtb24tcmVwYWlyLXBsYXRmb3JtLXNhdmUteW91ci13YXJkcm9iZS13aXRoLWlubm92YXRpb24tcHJpemXSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"“We are going to increase our repair capabilities; we need it,” says LVMH’s chief information officer Franck Le Moal, adding that it’s a challenge for fast-growing fashion houses to find enough professionals in sewing, shoe repairs and similar artisans to fix items to keep up with the demand. Having vetted partners will help maintain the life of goods and keep them in customers’ closets longer. “It’s not secondhand, it’s durability,” he says. (LVMH has largely stayed away from the secondhand business model, with the exception of Rimowa which has a new programme called ‘Re-crafted’, allowing customers to bring their Rimowa aluminium suitcases to selected stores and receive a gift voucher for a new one. The pre-owned suitcases are refurbished and come with a two-year warranty.)

SYW already works with Zalando and Hugo Boss and has started conversations with LVMH’s Louis Vuitton and Celine.

The LVMH Innovation Prize, now in its seventh edition, recognises the technology companies shaping the future of the luxury and fashion industries and “creates a conduit for creating and accelerating collaborations between LVMH maisons and promising startups”. Last year’s winner, wait-and-try luxury delivery service Toshi today works with seven brands in the group, including Tiffany, Louis Vuitton and Dior.

SYW won in the omnichannel and retail category, as well as scooping the overall prize. More than 1,300 startups applied for the award, up from 950 last year. In the other categories, winning startups included Chatlabs (data and artificial intelligence special mention), Neobrain (employee experience and D&I), Vidmob (image and media for brand desirability), Absolute Labs (immersive digital experiences), LivingPackets (operations excellence) and Woola (sustainability and greentech).

Presenting the awards during the Vivatech conference in Paris on Thursday morning, Arnault said: “The success of a company like LVMH, which was a startup some years ago and which we try to still manage as a startup, is due in part to the family spirit.” He toured LVMH’s conference booth, called ‘Dream Box’, with his eldest son Antoine Arnault, who is LVMH’s head of image, communication and environment as well as CEO of Berluti, chairman of Loro Piana and vice chairman of Christian Dior SE. They checked out innovations by LVMH houses including Rimowa, Louis Vuitton, Tiffany, Bulgari, Christian Dior and Ruinart. Louis Vuitton notably presented the “digital show experience” using Epic Games’s Unreal Engine 5 to build a six-minute immersive experience around the men’s fashion show staged on 19 January 2023, allowing users to discover the seven rooms that composed the set.

Speaking of SYW, Le Moal says: “Not all the houses have their own repair centres and all the houses are looking for people who will take care of the products that we sell to our clients.”

LVMH's Antoine Arnault Calls for Luxury-Focused Sustainability Pact - The Business of Fashion,"Tue, 27 Jun 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzb2ZmYXNoaW9uLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy9zdXN0YWluYWJpbGl0eS9sdm1oLWNsaW1hdGUtbHV4dXJ5LXN1c3RhaW5hYmlsaXR5LWNvYWxpdGlvbi1wYWN0L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Fashion needs a luxury-focused sustainability initiative, LVMH’s head of image and environment Antoine Arnault said Tuesday, addressing criticism over the French luxury giant’s decision not to join existing industry efforts to curb climate impact.

Arnault was speaking at the Global Fashion Summit in Copenhagen, where four years earlier Kering CEO François-Henri Pinault announced plans to form the Fashion Pact, a broad coalition of fashion businesses Arnault dismissed at the time, saying that at LVMH, “we prefer acts to pacts.”

The company has previously justified its lack of participation in the industry’s collective sustainability efforts by pointing to the complexity of its business, which spans wine and spirits and dominates perfume, skincare and cosmetics markets, as well as fashion. Its business model and concerns are also different from the major fast fashion players that play a large role in many of the industry’s existing initiatives, Arnault said Tuesday.

”I know we were very much criticised a few years ago when we did not sign the famous Fashion Pact,” Arnault told conference attendees. “It was, in our opinion, not the right thing to do at that time to be associated with the actors of fast fashion.”

But he added that more collaboration among luxury companies was needed to help the industry meet sustainability goals, noting that LVMH is off track to meet some of its targets.

”What I think is important is that we aggregate the leaders of this industry, the luxury industry, to work together,” Arnault said. “This is a hand that I’m putting to all our competitors to try to find the right standards, the right way of doing business.”

2023 LVMH & Karl Lagerfeld Prize Winners Interview - HYPEBEAST,"Wed, 07 Jun 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vaHlwZWJlYXN0LmNvbS8yMDIzLzYvMjAyMy1sdm1oLXByaXplLXdpbm5lci1pbnRlcnZpZXdzLXNldGNodS1tYWdsaWFuby1iZXR0ZXLSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Alongside fashion weeks and the countless number of shows, other high moments of the fashion calendar include the spread-out awards season – ranging from the LVMH Prize to ANDAM. Announced today at the Fondation Louis Vuitton in Paris, was the winner of this year’s LVMH Prize and the two Karl Lagerfeld Prize winners. Satoshi Kuwata’s Setchu took top honors while Luca Magliano’s Magliano and Julie Pelipas’ Bettter received the runner-up awards. But alongside championing the next wave of fashion talent, this year’s recipients not only represent a knack for revered design skills, but a focus on fostering environmentally equitable practices.

For Kuwata’s Setchu, the brand harbors an east meets west personality as the founder’s experiences as a designer and creative director alongside his international travels have birthed a cosmopolitan design approach. But what’s even more striking about Kuwata’s newfound success is that he essentially runs a one-man show – with no internal team whatsoever, just bits of help from colleagues here and there. “I’m the main crew and I’m doing everything myself, which is impossible to do,” said Kuwata. “The core thing now is setting up online components. After that, the next step will be accessories, sneakers and bags that can have more margins.”

As this year’s main prize recipient, the designer is now setting his sights on developing a team. Albeit a small one, assembling a team will help the designer to expand Setchu and establish a business that is in line with long-term success. “I want this company to be one of the Maisons of the group. I’m thinking of heritage and 30 years down the road.”

With the Karl Lagerfeld Prize, this year followed last year’s pattern and crowned two winners. For Luca Magliano’s Magliano, the designer is now most excited bout the providence of mentorship. Although Magliano and his team have crafted a solid cadence of subverting the classic since 2017, there’s still a great deal of growth that the designer envisions. Magliano looks forward to having another point of view on the brand’s designs and ideas to both expand its perspective alongside continuously refining its craft. “From a design point of view, the passion for classic alongside our contemporary interpretation has been key in propelling the brand.”

Finishing off this year’s winners is Julie Pelipas’ Bettter, whose core focus centers on upcycling and actionable sustainable practices. Pelipas’ brand gets its edge by crafting tailored garments from dead stock garments and utilizing customers’ body metrics for inclusive fits. As Vogue Ukraine’s former Fashion Director, Pelipa often saw that the buzz of “sustainably” remained limited to buzz, with very few actionable efforts. This lack is what led to Bettter’s birth and the multihyphenate creative’s aims to implement new technologies and practices that will drive environmentally equitable practices forward.

“Better winning the prize represents approval toward real actionable change in the industry,” said Pelipas. “Additionally, it means that the industry believes more sustainable technology is needed. I hope this will echo in all other levels of fashion. Not only with production but the perception of products, how we buy, how we communicate about fashion and more.”

Louis Vuitton Is Selling Its Iconic Trunk as a $39k NFT - Observer,"Fri, 09 Jun 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiPmh0dHBzOi8vb2JzZXJ2ZXIuY29tLzIwMjMvMDYvbG91aXMtdnVpdHRvbi1zZWxsaW5nLXRydW5rLW5mdHMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Louis Vuitton is taking a decidedly 21st century approach to its iconic trunk, a nearly 170-year-old design known as the French luxury brand’s most historic product. Fans of the fashion house can now sign up for a chance to purchase a non-fungible token (NFT) of the trunk for $39,000.

Buyers of the virtual “VIA Treasure Trunks” will also receive a physical counterpart. Owners will be able to purchase drops of digital keys throughout the next three years to unlock undisclosed Louis Vuitton collectibles and “privileged experiences,” according to the company.

The project is a “voyage of creation with Web.3” which will take “owners on a journey unlike any other before,” said Louis Vuitton in a statement. Its use of “Via,” which means “road” in Latin, in the NFT collection’s name suggestions the venture is an exciting new voyage for the luxury brand.

Louis Vuitton’s trunks, revolutionary at the time due to their flat tops and signature waterproof coated canvas, were the first products offered by the company when it was established in the 1850s. The brand has since expanded considerably upon their luggage line, with trunks that range in price from $3,150 to $243,000 and double as dog carriers, bar storage and vanities.

Exclusive barriers to entry

The waitlist for the newest iteration of NFT trunks opened yesterday (June 8). Eligible participants must either have a cryptocurrency wallet valued at more than $1 million or that contains a digital collection valued at more than $200,000 or own collectibles from LVMH (LVMHF), other luxury fashion brands or blue-chip digital collections.

Selected participants will be informed later this month, while the first set of digital keys will be unlocked in July alongside the upcoming Louis Vuitton Men’s show from the division’s new director Pharrell Williams.

The Treasure Trunks will be “soul-bound,” according to Louis Vuitton, meaning they are “connected to your identity and cannot be sold or transferred to another person.” The digital collectibles will utilize the Aura Blockchain Consortium, the first-ever luxury blockchain, launched by Louis Vuitton’s parent company LVMH alongside founding partners like Cartier and Mercedes Benz in 2021.

To address issues of authenticity and rampant counterfeit products, Aura matches product IDs to client IDs in addition to providing information on where specific products were made, what materials were used in its manufacturing and how many of the same items were created.

The blockchain creates a “digital twin” for its registered luxury products and can verify authenticity of items through user-uploaded images. As of 2022, Aura is used by more than 20 brands with more than 17 million products registered on the blockchain.

What is LVMH’s history with NFTs?

Bernard Arnault, the billionaire CEO of LVMH, has previously expressed skepticism towards the world of NFTs and the metaverse. “We are not interested in selling a pair of virtual sneakers for 10 euros,” he said during a January earnings call.

But the LVMH head appears to have taken a more liberal approach to Web.3 in recent months and has even begun accumulating his own collection of NFTs.

Before Treasure Trunks, Louis Vuitton experimented with digital collectibles designed by NFT artist Beeple through its mobile game “Louis the Game.” Other LVMH-owned brands like Fendi, which released accessories for a cryptocurrency wallet, and Tiffany & Co, which produced jewelry inspired by the CryptoPunk NFT collection, have also joined in.

Luxury brands are increasingly incorporating aspects of the metaverse or NFTs throughout their products and partnerships, with companies such as Givenchy and Balmain launching digital collections with partners like artist Chito and Barbie manufacturer Mattel. Burberry has ventured into an NFT-based game alongside technology company Mythical Games, while Dolce & Gabbana has been involved with NTFs since 2021, when it sold a collection of nine digital collectibles for nearly $5.7 million."
Beverly Hills Voters Reject LVMH's Cheval Blanc Hotel - The Real Deal,"Fri, 02 Jun 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vdGhlcmVhbGRlYWwuY29tL2xhLzIwMjMvMDYvMDIvbHZtaC10by1zY3JhcC1yb2Rlby1kcml2ZS1ob3RlbC1hZnRlci1iZXZlcmx5LWhpbGxzLWJhbGxvdC1yZWplY3Rpb24v0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LVMH has lost its plan to build its first hotel on Rodeo Drive, after Beverly Hills voters rejected a proposal to build the 109-key Cheval Blanc.

The future of the development at 468 Rodeo Drive was left in the hands of voters, after labor union Unite Here Local 11 gathered enough signatures to trigger a citywide ballot. The ballot asked voters whether the City Council’s approval of a development agreement for the project last year should be overturned.

LVMH, run by the world’s richest person Bernard Arnault, will now scrap the plans for the project and will not contest the election, a spokesperson for LVMH said in an email.

The decision came down to 80 votes, according to data from the Los Angeles County Clerk’s Office. The final tally was 50.6 percent in favor of rejecting both the agreement and the city’s approval.

About 32 percent of registered city voters showed up for the special election, according to the clerk’s office.

Since the Beverly Hills City Council approved the project in September, and passed a development deal two months later, LVMH has been at a standstill, waiting for the results of the special election.

The vote is a blow to both the French luxury retailer and city revenue — the hotel was expected to generate at least $725 million for Beverly Hills over the course of 30 years, according to the agreement. LVMH also agreed to pay at least $28 million in public benefit fees.

“It’s a staggering amount of money,” Beverly Hills Vice Mayor Julian Gold said at a council meeting in November. “There are cities where that is their general fund.”

At the same meeting, a representative for Unite Here Local 11 voiced opposition to the project, saying more needed to be set aside for affordable housing for workers.

Before the vote, Anish Melwani, who runs LVMH’s North American subsidiary, told the L.A. Times that the company has no plans to revisit the project before the council if voters rejected the approvals. Instead, the firm would revert the site into more retail.

“We have no interest in building a hotel in a community that doesn’t want us to be there,” he said.

LVMH already has 15 stores on Rodeo Drive and in the larger Golden Triangle area of Beverly Hills.

And the company could get a second shot at a hotel on Rodeo Drive. In 2021, the firm spent $200 million to buy a recently shuttered 86-key hotel at 449 North Rodeo Drive from Australian hotelier Efram Harkham and his family. No plans have yet been submitted for that property."

Kuwata’s global background – he is a graduate of London’s Central Saint Martins, and has worked on London’s Savile Row and Italy besides his native Japan – reflects the international range of this year’s finalists, who came from countries such as Jamaica, Ukraine and the US.

The LVMH Prize, which this year marks its 10th edition, was the brainchild of Delphine Arnault, the CEO of Christian Dior and the daughter of Bernard Arnault, the founder of luxury group LVMH, the parent company of brands such as Louis Vuitton and Dior.

The largest luxury group in the world, LVMH established the initiative to nurture young talent. Success stories from the last decade include acclaimed creators such as the late Virgil Abloh , Marine Serre and Jacquemus. The judging panel is made of top designers such as Nicolas Ghesquière from Louis Vuitton, Kim Jones from Dior and other creative directors from LVMH’s stable of brands.

The main prize, which this year was increased from US$320,000 to US$428,000 (300,000 euros to 400,000 euros), comes with a mentorship from an LVMH leader.

Minutes before the award ceremony at the Fondation Louis Vuitton in Paris, London-based Steven Stokey-Daley of S.S. Daley, last year’s winner, said that the mentoring was just as valuable, if not more, than the cash prize. “It was amazing,” he says. “It would be a weekly session and very thorough and worth its weight in gold. They mentor you in all corners of the business, from finance to legal, brand positioning and brand building and get you connections with the most exciting people in the industry like creative directors.”

The Karl Lagerfeld special jury award (200,000 euros and a mentorship) – named after the late Chanel and Fendi designer – was given to two candidates this year: London-based, Ukraine-born Julie Pelipas of Bettter and Italian Luca Magliano of Magliano.

Pelipas, a former fashion editor, calls Bettter “a system” rather than a brand. The company uses menswear deadstock fabrics and upcycles them into high-end women’s tailoring. She hopes to one day scale the model into a format that can be used by other labels.

Looking back at a decade of the LVMH Prize, Arnault says that it’s been great to see young, previously little-known designers “having amazing careers and developing their brands thanks to the prize”. She adds that what sets the LVMH Prize apart and propels the success of its winners is the one-year mentorship programme from a dedicated LVMH team.

“The prize reflects what’s happening in fashion [at a specific moment],” she also points out. “Ten years ago you had womenswear on one side and menswear on the other and then we saw more genderless concepts . Sustainability now is not even a question – every brand incorporates it.”

One common thread among this year’s finalists was their years of experience working in the fashion industry. As judge Maria Grazia Chiuri, women’s artistic director at Dior, notes, they are not recent fashion graduates but earned their stripes toiling behind the scenes before establishing their brands, showing true commitment and staying power.

This year’s LVMH Prize had a very international showing, including Jamaican designer Rachel Scott’s brand Diotima. Photo: Handout

“I like that the selection this season is more mature,” she says. “This is very important because that’s when [as a designer] you need more support. It’s the next step. All the collections that we saw are very consistent. The finalists had a lot of experiences and worked for other brands and [gained] expertise. Creativity is important but you also need experience and these finalists are all very strong.”

Kuwata, who only has five collections under his belt and a staff of one, says that he wants to be very wise about how he uses the cash and hopes that his mentors will guide him through the process. He agrees that the money alone will be life changing for a small company like Setchu, but as he plans to expand into new categories such as trainers, he wants to be extremely careful about how to grow the label in a sensible way.

The simple yet emotional speech given after receiving the Karl Lagerfeld Special Jury Prize at the LVMH Prize for Young Fashion Designers last week captured the whole essence of Magliano’s founder Luca Magliano — and a little bit more.

It also encompassed the hopes and ambitions of a large portion of Italian emerging designers, too. Differently from the American Dream, the Italian one isn’t based solely on equality of opportunity, but often requires external validation to succeed or simply be considered and appreciated on national soil.

No wonder Magliano pointed to being seen as the main takeaway of his LVMH Prize experience, describing it as “the most significant achievement one could hope for an author.”

“For me [this acknowledgement] means a big pat on the back but also the public and official promise never to betray myself. I’m convinced the prize is not a magic potion so I’m not hoping for anything miraculous to happen: I just hope it translates into more strength,” he told WWD ahead of his label’s spring 2024 runway show here Sunday.

The brand has been gaining increasing heat on the Milan scene in the last few seasons. Those who felt drawn to it since the beginning or before it landed in front of the jury comprising the likes of Jonathan Anderson, Maria Grazia Chiuri, Nicolas Ghesquière and more didn’t miss the chance to voice their support for Magliano in the final stages of the contest nor to underscore with pride their loyalty after he scooped up the prize.

A fashion design graduate of Bologna’s Libera Università delle Arti, Magliano cut his teeth on Alessandro Dell’Acqua’s team in Milan prior to moving back to Bologna in 2013 to work with designer Manuela Arcari on the Ter et Bantine fashion line. In 2015, he decided to go solo and launched the I Was Naked independent women’s brand, which has since been discontinued. The following year, Arcari, who is also the president of Arcari e Co., offered him the chance to produce his own line under license and the Magliano brand was born.

The winner of the ninth edition of Vogue Italia’s talent contest Who Is on Next? Uomo, he unveiled its fall 2018 collection with a runway show at Florence’s Dogana venue during Pitti Uomo and then joined the official Milan Men’s Fashion Week calendar.

His style and approach to fashion has evolved ever since. What started as bold collections filled with references to the ‘80s, different subcultures, “small-town boys” from his hometown of Bologna and occasional tongue-in-cheek and irreverent prints matured into soulful, vintage-looking menswear imbued with charming tailoring and a sense of color.

The fall 2023 collection paraded in Milan in January struck a particularly emotional chord with its rustic, live-in familiarity and clothes exalting humble fashion archetypes, such as the worker jacket, army-surplus coats and safety footwear. The press notes confirmed the hero of Magliano to be the worker and the collection to be “a tribute to what is most chic: the fatigue, ‘il travaglio,’ as they say in dialect.”

Shining a light on this different dimension of the country, far from the glamorized versions or the usual “La Dolce Vita” postcard-like image is what further contributed to the collection’s appeal and the increasing interest in the brand. Rather than pointing to aspirational clothes and lifestyles, the designer showed the beauty in realism, in an exercise that sort of winked to the quintessentially Italian neorealism film movement.

“At the beginning the design was very loud: we had the need to make ourselves heard. Then we gradually lowered our voice, but trying never to compromise the intensity. Now we have reached a sort of chaotic minimalism that I really like,” said Magliano, who added he is inspired by “many things, especially if they are banal and fragile but suggest a great sense of mystery.”

Asked about the pivotal moment in this creative process and of his career in general, Magliano pointed to the two collections developed during the pandemic. “That traumatic moment for us could not fail to translate into a turning point,” he recalled.

In addition to the LVMH Prize contest that brought international visibility, there was another milestone in the brand’s history. At the end of last year, the company sold a minority stake to fashion business accelerator Underscore District to support the next stage of its growth, as reported.

As a result of the deal, in the first half of 2023 “we opened the online store and revamped [the website], which we want to become an asset of our business strategy,” said Magliano. The brand is positioned in the affordable luxury segment and, in addition to the new e-commerce, is carried by around 60 retailers globally.

With an expanded team, Magliano plans to hire people for his studio in Bologna and venture more into womenswear.

The Karl Lagerfeld Prize’s grant of 200,000 euros and a one-year mentorship program from the LVMH Group will come in handy in the process, which will also include a bigger focus on accessories since these “help give even more complexity to our project.”

In the meantime, Magliano is gearing up to unveil his spring 2024 collection during Milan Men’s Fashion Week. While mum about the details, he said the evocative — and cryptic — brief for the season was “answered prayers.”

A key part of the collection will feature seven T-shirts, “which we call ‘prayers/thanksgiving’, dedicated to simple things that are important to us.”

Although themes will be interpreted in an ironic way, Magliano wanted these items not to seem like merch, opting to craft them in silk jersey. “Their purpose is to say something important in a simple way,” he concluded."
What's Next for Tiffany Under LVMH | BoF - The Business of Fashion,"Tue, 06 Jun 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzb2ZmYXNoaW9uLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy9sdXh1cnkvd2hhdHMtbmV4dC1mb3ItdGlmZmFueS11bmRlci1sdm1oL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"In the two-plus years since acquiring Tiffany in a $16 billion blockbuster deal, LVMH has gradually revealed its plans to remake the brand from the bottom up. There was the Beyoncé and Jay-Z campaign, the “Lock” fine jewellery collection and the recently reopened flagship designed to please window-shopping tourists and high rollers alike.

Now, change has come to the top: The brand on Monday revealed its 2023 “Blue Book”, a series of intricate pieces priced upwards of $100,000 that marks the brand’s first high jewellery collection since bringing on former Cartier designer Nathalie Verdeille as chief artistic officer in 2021, as well as the first collection fully developed under LVMH.

Inspired by the archives of marine life-obsessed former designer Jean Schlumberger — who led Tiffany’s studio during its mid-20th century heyday — the collection includes spiky diamond and ruby creations inspired by sea urchins, sapphire jellyfish and coral rings, and a gemstone-encrusted seashell hiding a 21-carat black opal.

In recent years, high jewellery has evolved into a profitable and fast-growing niche in addition to being a key exercise for top-end brands’ prestige. That’s partly down to its rarity: just a handful of luxury players are able to source exceptional gemstones for these limited-edition lines, where prices typically start in the high five figures and can stretch into the tens of millions.

Stones like the suite of 35 pink diamonds Tiffany recently acquired from the now-closed Argyle Mine are proving irresistible to ultra-high-net-worth customers. Dior and Chanel are also working to expand their high jewellery businesses, staging major events in Como and London this week, respectively.

“A focus on high jewellery is non-negotiable; it’s been very much part of the success of Tiffany,” chief executive officer Anthony Ledru told BoF.

“There has been so much creation of wealth the past 5 to 10 years, and the average age of high jewellery clients dropped a lot, especially in Southeast Asia, China, or Malaysia,” he added. “Then, when you have something unique that the client wants, what’s the price tag?”

As Tiffany leans into high jewellery, it’s hoping to grow the category’s sales as well as taking the rarity and quality of products even higher: The brand decided to phase out all “enhanced” stones, pushing teams to source only an extra-rare grade of sapphires and rubies that have not been heated to intensify colours or dissipate inclusions, or emeralds that haven’t been oiled to fill in pores.

The company entered an agreement to buy two major French workshops for high jewellery, Orest and Abysse, earlier this year, more evidence it sees the segment as a true growth opportunity rather than simply an image play. In addition to one-off pieces in its seasonal “Blue Book” collection (for which the cover of its historic catalogue inspired the brand’s signature blue boxes), Tiffany is ramping up marketing for its “Bird on a Rock” line, an icon of the Schlumberger era in which jewel-incrusted cockatoos are perched on large gemstones.

High jewellery has also become a priority as Tiffany tries to shake a reputation for depending on entry-priced silver trinkets to drive its business — as lines like heart-shaped “Return to Tiffany” charms sometimes drowned out the brand’s legacy for prestigious diamond work. A 2021 campaign featuring Beyoncé wearing the famed “Tiffany diamond” was a first gambit by Alexandre Arnault, the brand’s executive president for product and communications, followed more recently by efforts like a push to dress men on the red carpet with Schlumberger’s bird brooches.

Upmarket Push

Tiffany has grown its high jewellery business by 300 percent since the LVMH acquisition, achieving “hundreds of millions in additional sales”, Ledru said. Silver lines, meanwhile, are now estimated to make up less than 15 percent of sales, compared to around one-fourth of revenues prior to the acquisition, according to HSBC.

“For a brand like Tiffany high jewellery is an opportunity to accelerate the shift in perception,” HSBC analyst Erwan Rambourg explained. “Many people think Tiffany is a gifting brand run by silver, and it’s not.”

High jewellery is just one part of the puzzle. The brand plans to animate classic collections more aggressively in the much-bigger fine jewellery segment, with items earmarked for marketing support and relaunched designs including Schlumberger’s “Jackie” bracelet or Elsa Peretti’s sensual cuffs. Schlumberger’s bird motif also represents a prime opportunity to develop more accessibly-priced declinations in seasons to come, Ledru said.

“The job of Nathalie [Verdeille] is to be a prophet of the past … A designer of Tiffany needs to ask, what would Schlumberger do today?” Ledru said. As a brand founded in 1837, the weight of Tiffany’s heritage “means constraints, it means responsibility but it also means authenticity. There’s no ex nihilo creation at Tiffany, only transformation.”

Previously Cartier’s fine jewellery creative director for 16 years, Verdeille has proved herself as an expert curator of archives, with a knack for “finding something to twist a creation and make it contemporary without changing the essential,” Ledru said.

Polishing the Silver

Tiffany’s approach to silver jewellery is also being revised: the brand is pushing chunkier, more complex (and more expensive) silver designs like its Hardware range to gradually shrink the share of entry-priced silver charms like ”Return to Tiffany”, as well as upgrading the heart-shaped signature line with gemstones and gold-plated details. For the brand’s most recent major fine jewellery release, Lock, it opted not to offer silver at all.

“We’re not ashamed of silver, it’s part of our heritage,” Ledru said. “What we’re not O.K. with is when silver becomes too commodified, or silver that takes the brand down where it’s not supposed to be.” The entry price at Tiffany has roughly doubled to over $500 as part of LVMH’s upscaling push.

In addition to higher-end products, the company is also working to upgrade its retail network in order to grow its market share among top-end buyers, particularly abroad. “The last piece of the puzzle is the retail network, this is where we have the greatest opportunity,” Ledru said.

While Tiffany has long been the biggest jewellery brand in the US, it continues to lag the likes of Cartier and Bulgari in Europe, the Middle East and Asia — which is becoming a higher-stakes market for the luxury industry as investors count on a rebound in China to make up for slowing growth in the US.

Following the reopening of its “Landmark” flagship in New York in April, the brand is working to develop a network of around 15 big (though less big) flagships it will position as “cultural hubs,” mixing products with art, archival jewellery, food and hospitality.

A recent opening in Dubai Mall is set be followed up by renovations and openings including a new location in Tokyo’s trendy Omotesando district.

Ledru declined to comment on reports of a pending LVMH reshuffle on the Champs-Elysées thoroughfare, where the group’s acquisition of the former HSBC headquarters could set off a round of musical chairs among its top brands. He confirmed, however, that in the medium-term Tiffany hoped to upgrade its Paris presence with “very strong flagships” on both the Champs-Elysées and Place Vendôme.

Despite uncertainty for luxury brands in Tiffany’s US stronghold, analysts expect the brand to keep growing at a clip as it follows up splashy marketing campaigns with upgraded products and stores. The brand is on track to increase sales an average of 20 percent per year through 2025 after crossing the threshold of $5 billion in 2022, according to HSBC.

“Jewellery is in a bit of a super-cycle of growth,” Rambourg said. In the mostly unbranded, less competitive sector compared to fashion, the blockbuster acquisition of Tiffany served as a “bit of a wake-up call for the entire industry” causing rival brands to update their marketing and retail efforts alongside LVMH.

Is the Warren Buffett of Luxury a Better Investor Than the Legend Himself? - The Motley Fool,"Mon, 05 Jun 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIzLzA2LzA1L3dhcnJlbi1idWZmZXR0LWx1eHVyeS1sdm1oLWludmVzdG9yLWFybmF1bHQv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"It's a more difficult question to answer than you might expect.

If you think there's been a lot of talk lately about the richest person in the world, you aren't alone. A few years ago, it was Jeff Bezos. Elon Musk recently reclaimed the title. But another man -- Bernard Arnault of LVMH Moët Hennessy (LVMHF -1.57%) -- has been jockeying for the crown over the past year. And he made his fortune in much the same way Warren Buffett did with Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A -1.27%) (BRK.B -1.35%). In fact, you might argue he's an even better investor. With the back story and the numbers, I'll let you be the judge.

Similar but different

Many know the story of Warren Buffett and Berkshire Hathaway. As an investor looking for cheap stocks, he bought shares in a New England textile mill. The investment suffered for a few years until Buffett took a controlling stake and began using cash the company generated to make other investments -- especially in the stock market. Although his strategy has morphed over time, he is a value investor through and through. He is always considering his investment options through the lens of a fair price.

Arnault's path was very similar, although his style and strategy are quite different. Intrigued with luxury, he reportedly used money from his family business to buy the parent of Christian Dior out of bankruptcy. From there, he was invited to invest in the recently merged LVMH as the factions representing Louis Vuitton and Moët Hennessy struggled for power. In short order, Arnault had seized it for himself. He still controls about half of the company. The rest is history. Unlike the friendly grandfather-like persona Buffett has created, Arnault has earned nicknames through the years like ""the terminator"" and ""the wolf in cashmere."" He is, in short, viewed as aggressive and ambitious.

There is certainly reason to be confident. He has systematically bought, cultivated, and reinvigorated luxury brands and created an incredibly formidable conglomerate. Some of the most widely recognized global brands decorate each segment. Brands include Dom Perignon (wine and spirits), namesake Louis Vuitton and Fendi (fashion and leather goods), Christian Dior (perfumes and cosmetics), Tiffany (watches and jewelry), and Starboard Cruises (other activities). It is a well-balanced portfolio of products that consumers around the world aspire to purchase.

Two different ways to trounce the market

Over the past two decades, each man has been opportunistic in making acquisitions. Buffett, famous for timely bets when investors are nervous, has picked up several large industrial names, including railroad Burlington Northern Santa Fe, airplane parts supplier Precision Castparts, stable consumer-focused brands such as Duracell and Kraft Heinz, and chemical and energy companies.

Arnault's strategy for LVMH is very different. As the head a house of brands, he is perpetually cultivating a relationship with the owners of other luxury brands in the hopes of one day tucking them under the LVMH umbrella. Often these are family-owned European brands, with status going back a century or longer. He has grabbed brands including Tiffany, Italian jeweler Bulgari, and leisure company Belmond (formerly Orient Express Hotels). It's produced incredible returns. While Buffett is famous for handily beating the S&P 500 index over a long period, LVMH has crushed them both in the past two decades.

Of course, Buffett started much earlier than Arnault. He gained control of Berkshire in 1965, when it was at only about $20 per share. The returns since are a mind-blowing 3,800,000% -- or 19.8% compounded annually for about 58 years. It's hard to piece together stock returns since Arnault became chairman and CEO of LVMH in early 1989. But his record, while not comparable to Buffett's, is very impressive. The market capitalization of LVMH has grown from $7 billion to $445 billion today. That's more than 6,250% overall and 13% compounded for 34 years. Because issuing and buying back shares will affect the stock price but not the company's market capitalization, a better comparison is Berkshire's market capitalization. It has grown 13,400% since 1989 -- about twice that of LVMH.

One thing is certain: Both Buffett and Arnault are magnificent investors with strategies they have perfected over decades. In a 2017 interview with CNBC, Arnault called the Oracle of Omaha ""the person I admire most in business,"" citing his long-term approach, the quality of his ideas, and his conviction in them. While Buffett does appear to be the better investor, it's hard to argue with Arnault's results. Any comparison must also acknowledge that the two men had different aims. One was trying to grow his investments as much as possible, and the other was trying to establish the largest collection of luxury brands the world had ever known. One thing is undeniable: They both succeeded."
Setchu's Satoshi Kuwata wins the LVMH Prize - Vogue Business,"Wed, 07 Jun 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZvZ3VlYnVzaW5lc3MuY29tL2Zhc2hpb24vc2V0Y2h1cy1zYXRvc2hpLWt1d2F0YS13aW5zLXRoZS1sdm1oLXByaXpl0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"To receive the Vogue Business newsletter, sign up here.

Setchu’s Satoshi Kuwata is the winner of the 2023 LVMH Prize, earning a year of mentorship and a €400,000 cash prize.

The 39-year-old designer impressed the jury with his collection reflecting his multicultural path and experience in the industry. Born in Japan, he worked at Savile Row before studying at Central Saint Martins, and later worked for Givenchy and The North Face, all of which he says amount to a “360 design” perspective. “I have wanted to do my own label since I was a kid. That was a journey.” He created his brand in Milan in 2020. Setchu, which means “compromise”, sees its fashion as a bridge between Japan and the West. Sophie Brocart, Patou CEO and LVMH Prize mentoring director, praised the “cultural dimension” of the brand, and its the clever tailoring (Kuwata’s pattern-making skills are visible in the origami constructions of some of his garments and on his bias-cut dresses).

He received the award, presented by actor Gal Gadot, on stage at the Fondation Louis Vuitton on Wednesday. “I was really a naughty boy and my mum was worried about me and I can make my mum really happy,” he said when receiving the award. With the €400,000 grant, he plans to build his team, focus on his e-commerce website and launch sneakers, shoes, and handbags. “I used to design [accessories] a lot. I am good at it. I just needed money.” He doesn’t plan to stage a fashion show, saying he would prefer a more intimate event setting to show his collections. “We are in 2023. It’s time to change.”

The LVMH Prize was started in 2013 to award emerging designers. This year’s jury was made up of industry leaders Jonathan Anderson, Maria Grazia Chiuri, Nicolas Ghesquière, Marc Jacobs, Kim Jones, Stella McCartney, Delphine Arnault, Jean-Paul Claverie, Sidney Toledano, Nigo and Silvia Venturini Fendi.

Before awarding the winners, Delphine Arnault, CEO of Christian Dior Couture and the force behind the LVMH Prize, said: “The LVMH prize has grown a lot since 2013. It has distinguished 20 designers from all around the world. Today we are looking at the future. It’s my pleasure to announce that we have decided to increase the endowment to €400,000 [up from €300,000] for the winner of the LVMH Prize and €200,000 [up from €150,000] for the winners of the Karl Lagerfeld prize.”"

LVMH and Epic Games will showcase one of their first collaboratively-created experiences at the VivaTech trade event, sponsored by LVMH. Attendees of the conference will have the opportunity to virtually immerse themselves in the fall 2023 men's show by Louis Vuitton.

Using Epic's Unreal Engine 5, MetaHuman technology, and Reality Capture, the company has created a six-minute immersive experience based on a show that took place in January. Users can explore seven rooms of the set designed by director Michel Gondry and view a selection of looks from the collection designed by guest designer Colm Dillane.

"2023 LVMH Prize Winners: Setchu, Magliano, & Bettter Interview - Highsnobiety","Thu, 08 Jun 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhpZ2hzbm9iaWV0eS5jb20vcC9sdm1oLXByaXplLTIwMjMtd2lubmVyLWludGVydmlldy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"After a lengthy process of whittling some 2,400 applicants down to nine overall finalists, on June 7 this year’s LVMH Prize winner was revealed as Milan-based label Setchu.

Founded by Satoshi Kuwata, a former designer at both Givenchy and YEEZY, Setchu gets its name from the Japanese phrase 'wayo setchu', which roughly translates to “a compromise between Japan and the West”.

An apt name for a brand whose garments do exactly that.

Now as an LVMH Prize winner, Kuwata can now finally enjoy success with a label of his own.

“I didn’t name my brand with my name, because fashion is teamwork,” Kuwata tells Highsnobiety in a Zoom call following the announcement.

“You’ve probably interviewed a lot of designers who need money and help, but I’ve always had a really great team around me. I just want to hold them later and thank them.”

Naturally, capital is one of the biggest issues for emerging designers taking their labels to the next level.

However, with the 2023 LVMH Prize reward — €400,000 and a year’s mentorship from LVMH insiders — this won’t be an issue for Setchu. Kuwata already has plans to expand his collection to include accessories, sneakers, and bags.

""I believe in myself,"" he says. ""I want this company to be one of the maisons in this [LVMH] group. I'm thinking about a 20-30 year goal.""

Since its inception back in 2014, the LVMH Prize (which has previously been won by names like Simon Porte Jacquemus, Grace Wales Bonner, and S.S. Daley) has been a holy grail for young aspiring designers.

So too has its runner-up Karl Lagerfeld Prize, which also comes with a lucrative cash sum (€200,000 a piece), as well as a one-year LVMH Group mentorship program. This year, the prize is shared by Luca Magliano’s eponymous label and Ukrainian designer Julie Pelipas' Bettter.

“I can’t wait to have another point of view of my projects from people who do luxury,” says Luca Magliano.

“From the money point of view, I want to hire people. I want to make the structure of Magliano stronger. At this point we have three people working at the brand, which is now becoming quite big. We’re at a good moment of maturity.”

When I ask Magliano how he'll celebrate the win, he laughs. “I’ll be with the other guys of the prize. I’ll get drunk, but not too much. I’ll relax, sure, but in a week we have a show in Milan.”

As for Pelipas (a former Vogue Ukraine editor), she too has big plans for her label, which is fast becoming renowned for its wide-scale upcycling that gives deadstock fabrics new life.

“I dream that this approval of Bettter will bring it to the right place,” she says. “I believe it’s the right time in terms of scalability, in terms of sourcing, upcycling, and selling locally.

“I really truly hope it will help me develop my technology further, and place it and my brand in the right position in the industry.”"
LVMH owner Bernard Arnault visits China after luxury spending rebound - KTVZ,"Tue, 27 Jun 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiQFodHRwczovL2t0dnouY29tL21vbmV5L2Nubi1idXNpbmVzcy1jb25zdW1lci8yMDIzLzA2LzI3L2x2bWgtb3duZXItYmVybmFyZC1hcm5hdWx0LXJlcG9ydGVkbHktdmlzaXRzLWNoaW5hLWFmdGVyLWx1eHVyeS1zcGVuZGluZy1yZWJvdW5kL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"By Laura He, CNN

Hong Kong (CNN) — Bernard Arnault, chairman and CEO of LVMH (LVMHF), has arrived in China for his first visit to the country since the end of its strict Covid restrictions, after his company posted a jump in sales driven by a rapid rebound in Chinese spending on luxury goods.

The French billionaire is the latest in a string of prominent business leaders to have visited China, following trips by Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk and JP Morgan (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon last month. Beijing has been wooing global CEOs in an effort to arrest a slump in business confidence and to divide Western businesses from governments on their policy toward China.

Arnault, who has recently been surpassed by Musk as the richest person in the world, was spotted at several shopping malls in downtown Beijing on Tuesday, according to state media reports, citing photos on Chinese social media.

Privately-owned business magazine Caijing said the French entrepreneur inspected several brand stores owned by LVMH, including Christian Dior and Bulgari, in the WF Central and SKP malls, citing photos taken by local residents.

LVMH didn’t immediately respond to a CNN request for comment.

LVMH reported its first-quarter sales surged 17% from a year ago, beating analyst expectations, driven by a rebound in China’s luxury market from the decline it experienced during the pandemic.

The company had registered “some pretty nice pick up in China, which bodes well for the rest of the year,” its chief financial officer Jean-Jacques Guiony told analysts during a quarterly sales call in April.

Consumers were returning to the company’s stores, and online sales were picking up, he said.

“We definitely see a normalization of this market… We are extremely hopeful and should benefit from a strong push from mainland China in 2023.”

Beijing called an end to its stringent and often oppresive zero-Covid policy in December, which resulted in an initial burst in consumer activity following three years of rolling lockdowns. Luxury goods spending bounced back more quickly than any other sector in the first quarter.

Although the economic momentum has lost steam in the past couple of months, growth in luxury goods sales has accelerated.

According to government statistics released this month, retail sales of jewelry, gold and silver surged 19.5% in the first five months of 2023 from a year ago, the biggest jump among all categories for goods.

China was one of the world’s largest luxury goods markets before Covid hit. Bain & Co. estimated earlier this year that Chinese consumer spending accounted for around 17% of the global luxury market in 2022. That represented a decrease from 35% in 2019.

But the momentum is set to resume this year, as local consumer appetite remains strong and China recovers from the impact of Covid, the consulting firm said in a report in February.

“Compared to other emerging markets, China is a behemoth for luxury growth,” it said, adding that the country has a larger number of middle- and high-income consumers.

Charm offensive

Arnault’s visit also comes as Beijing woos global CEOs to appease fears about its unfriendly policies to foreign capital. Business confidence has slumped after Chinese authorities raided several foreign consultancies, leaving Western companies uneasy about their future in the country.

The deteriorating sentiment has exacerbated the country’s economic woes, resulting in a sharp drop in private-sector investment and a rise in unemployment.

Late last month, Musk visited China for the first time in three years and met a string of senior officials, who encouraged him to boost investment and operations in the country.

Top Chinese leaders are also trying to split businesses from governments on their China policy, in order to push back against efforts by Western nations to “de-risk” from the Chinese economy.

On Tuesday, Chinese Premier Li Qiang said at a World Economic Forum event that “de-risking” decisions should be made by companies rather than governments.

“Some people in the West are hyping up so-called concepts of reducing dependency [on China] and de-risking [from China]. I would say these concepts are false propositions,” Li said.

“It is businesses that are the most sensitive [to such risks] and are hence in the best position to assess such risks. They should be left to come to their own conclusion and make their own choice,” he said.

“Governments and relevant organizations should not overreach themselves.”

LVMH Finalizing Sponsorship Deal Paris 2024 Olympics - HYPEBEAST,"Thu, 15 Jun 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vaHlwZWJlYXN0LmNvbS8yMDIzLzYvbHZtaC1maW5hbGl6aW5nLXNwb25zb3JzaGlwLWRlYWwtcGFyaXMtMjAyNC1vbHltcGljcy1yZXBvcnRz0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Antoine Arnault is reportedly in the final stages of an LVMH sponsorship deal for the 2024 Paris Olympics. Antoine is one of five of CEO Bernard Arnault‘s children and heirs to the LVMH empire. His ability to close the deal with the Olympics is said to be a test of Antoine’s marketing prowess and give the industry a glimpse of how the next generation could handle Bernard’s succession.

In a recent report from Reuters, the publication indicated that the deal is being negotiated by Antoine, who has the most public profile of the five siblings. However, over the years, the other siblings, have all stepped up in the leadership ranks. Antoine’s role often revolves around promotions of the LVMH group, governing its two biggest labels Louis Vuitton and Dior as well as the champagne brand.

The Paris 2024 Olympics Committee is said to be in late-stage negotiations with LVMH. Paris 2024 CEO Tony Estanguet said last week, “It takes time, but we want to make sure that this partnership makes sense and is balanced.” According to Business of Fashion, Antoine has to ensure that the sponsorship deal will see LVMH take on the “role as a purveyor of craftsmanship and French heritage while avoiding overly conspicuous brand logo displays that could cheapen its image.” In a recent LVMH shareholder meeting, Antoine said of the Olympic Games sponsorship, “It will likely be the most-watched event in the history of television, in the history of the games — a spectacular event.” Stay tuned on how the deal unfolds.

Why Pharrell Williams will make LVMH happy - The Spectator World,"Sat, 24 Jun 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vdGhlc3BlY3RhdG9yLmNvbS9saWZlL3BoYXJyZWxsLXdpbGxpYW1zLW1ha2UtbHZtaC1oYXBweS1sb3Vpcy12dWl0dG9uL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Amid the dusk light, there’s hushed, excited chatter. And then drums, lights, and orchestral tones. It’s 10:18 p.m. in Paris, and Pharrell Williams is debuting his first collection as creative director at Louis Vuitton, Spring-Summer 2024. Never mind that it is three quarters of an hour late — fashionably late — nobody cares. This is the biggest fashion event of the year, and we can wait. We’ve been waiting a year and a half already.

Amid the dusk light, there’s hushed, excited chatter. And then drums, lights, and orchestral tones. It’s 10:18 p.m. in Paris, and Pharrell Williams is debuting his first collection as creative director at Louis Vuitton, Spring-Summer 2024. Never mind that it is three quarters of an hour late — fashionably late — nobody cares. This is the biggest fashion event of the year, and we can wait. We’ve been waiting a year and a half already.

This is a big deal. Lous Vuitton’s creative director is the biggest role in menswear, formerly held by the beloved, brilliant Virgil Abloh, who passed away from cancer in November 2021. Though it was his predecessor, Kim Jones, who had brought streetwear aesthetics to Vuitton, Abloh’s contribution expanded this in a more broad, authentic and creative way. It was under his direction that Louis Vuitton introduced jewelry for men, leant hard into sneakers, and realized that classic men’s bags, shrunk down — otherwise known as “handbags” — could be sold to men too. Though his run at Vuitton was less than four years, Abloh’s work for the house is iconic. In a hundred years, his most notable pieces will still draw crowds at museums.

That’s an enormous hole to fill; and, as announced this Valentine’s Day, Pharrell is the man to fill it. This week, we saw what that would look like.

This debit collection consists of two core elements. The first is military inspired looks, with sandy beige, and camouflage coats, taking Vuitton’s signature check “damier” print to its most abstract conclusion. Pharrell coined it “Damouflage,” and the clothes were no more successful than the name. The lux-military blend is drab and somewhat tired at this point. Nobody is stimulated by LV wellington knockoff.

Thankfully, the final two thirds were a splatter-shot set of looks, from overcoats to rugby jerseys, and there was no central theme or shared design motif, but all screamed Pharrell. The accessories were bright, with extensive gold and silver hardware; the clothes had a casual fit but intricate textures, playing with that classic damier check; and taken collectively, this was a bright, bold, dramatic vision of luxury.

That’s not to say it’s new. A pearl-covered checker-board coat is stunning but hardly innovative, and the golden metallic Keepall was also gorgeous, but just a continuation of a Virgil design.

And yet, none of this matters. The show was a hit before it debuted.

Pharrell did exactly what he needed to, and he was hired for a specific reason. He is famous for his excellent, eclectic taste, and has a history in high-fashion — from his “Chanel-Pharrell” Adidas NMD sneakers to his own brand, Billionaire Boys Club — but that mattered little either. He designed the collaborative “Millionaire” sunglasses for Louis Vuitton in 2004, but fashion critics who mention this now, as though it has any relevance to his appointment, do little but betray their own unprofessional naivete.

Above anything else, what matters for Louis Vuitton — and its owners, the Arnault family — is that Pharrell is a hit maker. Whether he’s producing earworms like “Happy,” or luxury items for runways, the man can move product; and that’s what Creative Director is about.

When it came to selecting a successor to Abloh, the fashion press tossed around many potential names, including Bianca Saunders, Daniel Lee, Riccardo Tisci, Haider Ackermann, and Craig Green. They all would have been great artistic choices.

But the role of “creative director” is not about being a fashion curator, given patronage by the good will and social conscious of LVMH. It’s about ensuring a multi-billion-dollar fashion Goliath stays relevant, and keeps growing. And if a fashion industry name were its creative director, Rihanna wouldn’t have been in the audience. Nor would have Jay Z. Pusha T wouldn’t have walked the show, and celebrities wouldn’t have clamored to see the show. It would have been fantastic, artistically, but this is a business baby.

Though LVMH does not separate out the sales of its various brands, it’s widely known that Abloh’s success as creative director was as much commercial as it was artistic. It’s not incidental that those areas that he pushed furthest in and made so iconic — men’s jewelry, bags and sneakers — are the highest margin products in fashion, and have the greatest growth potential in menswear.

Similarly, it is not incidental that bags were such a central focus of the Pharrell show. All but one look had a bag, each distinct, and given careful attention by Louis Vuitton’s cameramen. There were small leather clutches, handbags inspired by the trunks, weekenders with his new “Damoflage” print, a leather shopping bag and backpacks upon backpacks upon backpacks. Most notable are his simpler, more classical leather bags, fitted with repeating LV hardware. They’re not original, but they’re deeply beautiful, and bound to be hits. Hypebeasts and normal luxury purchasers alike will flock to them; and the repeating silver LVs being quite similar to the style of Chrome Hearts bags (one of the most exclusive luxury brands in the world) certainly won’t hurt. Though less attention was paid to them, his new Louis Vuitton sneakers — which look like bolder, bigger, monochrome versions of his beloved mid-2000s Reebok-produced “Icecream” sneakers — will also fly off shelves.

Pharrell, the man behind “Happy,” themed his show around “love.” It was about a love of creativity, of expression, of diverse fashion cultures and sharing and blending of them. For the Arnaults, it was also for the love of monetizing them.

The new LV is the same as the old LV; inspiringly creative, and immensely lucrative. Though Pharrell sang along to the accompanying gospel band, as they cried out “THANK YOU GOD FOR YOUR JOY,” the Arnaults will resonated with a different song by Pharrell. It was released last year. The title, and chorus were “Cash In, Cash Out.” It was a hit. And it was a damn great song."
Satoshi Kuwata's Setchu Wins the 2023 LVMH Prize - The Business of Fashion,"Wed, 07 Jun 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzb2ZmYXNoaW9uLmNvbS9uZXdzL2x1eHVyeS9zYXRvc2hpLWt1d2F0YXMtc2V0Y2h1LXdpbnMtMjAyMy1sdm1oLXByaXplL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS – LVMH named Satoshi Kuwata’s Setchu as the winner of its 2023 Prize for Young Designers Wednesday.

The 39-year-old Japanese creator, who worked selling bespoke suiting to royals at Huntsman & Sons on Savile Row before enrolling at Central Saint Martins, stood out for his vision that includes “not only clothes, but a philosophy,” said jury member Maria Grazia Chiuri, Dior’s creative director for womenswear. After graduating, Kuwata went on to work at Givenchy under Riccardo Tisci and LVMH’s now-defunct Edun label before starting his own brand.

Now in its fifth season, Milan-based Setchu mixes British tailoring techniques with Japanese traditions like origami. Clients are given instructions on how to roll or fold jackets for storage and travel, using techniques inspired by kimono culture that both minimise the space taken up by garments and preserve pleats and creases integrated in the design. “I just believe in detail,” Kuwata said in an interview while awaiting the jury’s decision in Paris Wednesday.

His inspirations reach beyond modern masters like Issey Miyake and John Galliano, looking back to earlier generations of technical innovators who inspired them, like Mariano Fortuny and Madeleine Vionnet, he said. His designs mix form and function: an impassioned fisherman, Kuwata said one jacket was inspired by the desire to have something he could pack up with his nylon gear “and fish all day, then still look like it’s the end of ‘Death in Venice’ at dinner every night.”

LVMH gave its runner-up award, the Karl Lagerfeld Prize, to two brands: Italy’s Magliano, a contemporary menswear concept known for its relaxed suiting and luxe fabrication of grunge-inflected oversized cardigans, and Bettter by Julie Pelipas, a Ukrainian designer based in London who is working to make upcycling chic and scaleable.

To celebrate the prize’s 10th edition, luxury’s biggest group stepped up the awards for its winners. Setchu will receive a grant of €400,000 ($429,000) in addition to a year of mentoring by the group’s executives. Bettter and Magliano will both receive €200,000. The grand prize and Karl Lagerfeld grants were previously set at €300,000 and €100,000 respectively.

Over the last decade, the LVMH Prize has helped to advance the careers of winners like Marine Serre and Grace Wales Bonner, runner-up Simon Porte Jacquemus, and finalists who have included Virgil Abloh, Demna Gvasalia, and Charaf Tajer (the creator of Casablanca).

This year’s laureates pulled ahead in a tough field of finalists populated by more established creatives than previous editions. Designers seen by market sources as early front-runners in the competition included Luar-founder Raul Lopez — a former collaborator of Shayne Oliver’s Hood By Air, and a well-known figure in the New York fashion scene — and Veronica Leoni — the Rome-based creator behind the brand Quira, who has garnered a reputation for refined taste and built relationships with top-notch suppliers while previously designing for The Row. Other finalists included British designer Aaron Esh, France’s Burc Akyol, Jamaica’s Diotima, and Canada’s Paolina Russo.

But over the course of months of showrooms and meetings with judges, as well as a gruelling final day of presentations in the belly of Louis Vuitton’s whale-shaped art foundation outside Paris — Setchu, Magliano, and Bettter pulled ahead.

The choice of Setchu was “pretty unanimous,” said Delphine Arnault, the CEO of Christian Dior who has overseen the prize since its creation. “The entire jury felt he had the talent, the product, the vision — even for the packaging. Everything felt right,” she said.

Julie Pelipas' Bettter is using technology to scale upcycling. The brand won the 2023 Karl Lagerfeld Prize alongside Magliano.

Julie Pelipas’ Bettter set itself apart with an innovative, committed approach to sustainability: the designer uses algorithms to match unsold garments with patterns for new designs, forgoing the blank canvas offered by a roll of fabric. The hope is to reduce waste and make the practice of upcycling rigorous, scalable and desirable.

Luca Magliano stood out for proposing a differentiated, authentic, and ultimately wearable take on “Made in Italy” tailoring and knitwear: His is the biggest business among the candidates, with a concrete vision for the brand’s next steps, judges said.

“The prize really reflects the state of what’s happening in fashion,” Arnault said. “Sustainability is something everyone is incorporating in some way. We also saw a lot of tailoring coming back.”

Setchu and Magliano are both set to present their latest collections during this month’s Milan Menswear Week, while Bettter operates on a drop-based model."
Inside VivaTech with Bernard Arnault and the LVMH Innovation Award - WWD,"Thu, 15 Jun 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3dkLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy1uZXdzL3RlY2hub2xvZ3kvYmVybmFyZC1hcm5hdWx0LXByZXNlbnRzLWx2bWgtaW5ub3ZhdGlvbi1hd2FyZC12aXZhdGVjaC0xMjM1Njg5NTAxL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS — Filled to the brim with bright booths and hosts in vibrant logo-ed T-shirts, VivaTech was buzzing with a combination of acronyms from AI to AR to VR, as companies debuted new retail tech at the Porte de Versailles convention center.

Speaking on the main stage to present the LVMH Innovation Award, LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton chair and chief executive officer Bernard Arnault noted that the event was launched just seven years ago and has since become “one of the most important events in the tech world, attended by some of the most successful leaders.”

He was on hand to present the LVMH Innovation Award Grand Prize, which went to Save Your Wardrobe, a start-up that has worked inside the group’s incubator since last September.

The start-up integrates care and repair options into a brand’s website to make the process of booking and tracking repair seamless, as well as in-store after care. It can also provide a network of locally owned businesses that are specialized in care.

“The idea is to work closely to understand the needs of the maisons to provide an outstanding experience that is at the same standard as the purchasing one,” founder Hasna Kourda told WWD. She said she was initially inspired by witnessing the problem of Western clothing waste being dumped in her home country of Tunisia.

“Our mission is truly to expand the legacy of luxury; we care about clothing, we care about how it makes us feel. Being supported by the group and partnering with the maisons will give us the scale to have a global impact on people and also on the planet,” she said.

In addition to the award, Kourda received a one-of-a-kind varsity jacket designed by Kenzo’s Nigo, naming her the 2023 winner.

LVMH head of communication, image and environment Antoine Arnault said discussions are starting to integrate the Save Your Wardrobe platform into the various LVMH houses. “It is something that we need, it is something that we strive for but it’s very complex to implement — reparability and after sales repair — is always a very difficult and very sensitive topic, so having a third party that is professional on this particular subject is something great for us,” he told WWD.

“We always say that our way of seeing sustainability is we don’t really speak about secondhand but we speak about second life,” he added. “We want our customers to feel they get value for what they buy. It’s another philosophy than when you buy a fashion item for the short term.”

Other projects honored were Woola, which aims to replace plastic bubble wrap packaging with the 200,000 tons of sheep wool that goes to waste each year in Europe; NeoBrain, an AI-powered talent management solution; VidMob, which uses analytics to improve campaigns; Living Packets, which reframes deliveries with reusable packaging, and Absolute Labs, which bridges marketing software in the Web3 space to improve customer relationship management.

Inside VivaTech, Bernard Arnault was a rock star. He toured the LVMH booths surrounded by bodyguards and mobbed by throngs of fans trying to snap photos of him or ask for selfies. He indulged a couple of fans just before his exit.

At the Louis Vuitton booth the brand demonstrated its virtual replication of the fall 2023 men’s show. The show played out on two customized vintage arcade machines — swathed in Louis Vuitton’s iconic monogram canvas, and featuring LV logo-ed buttons — that will only be available at the VivaTech show.

The tech, in partnership with Epic Games, was an internal test to conquer challenges, including conveying craftsmanship in a digital manner, show how to digitize a show in a short time frame, and understand how to work with an internal team instead of outsource to an agency. LVMH director of leather goods and modeling Carole Fuchs took on a small digital design team of just five, which replicated the show in 2.5 months.

In the 2D “game,” of sorts, a user moves around the set with a controller, crosses paths with models and points to items within the show for additional information. There are no plans to roll it out on a wider basis, for now, but the idea behind the tech was to “make it very inclusive,” said Fuchs. “The show is usually very private and we wanted to offer the possibility of the experience potentially to other people,” she said.

Louis Vuitton also demonstrated a VR headset that takes customers on an eight-minute immersive tour of its Paris flagship. So far, the tech is only available at special events and has been utilized in Dubai.

Dior Beauty demonstrated live shopping consultations, designed to take “chat with a sales rep” button to the next level. Partnered with Swedish live streaming company Bambuser, customers can speak directly with a human adviser on fragrance, skin care and beauty products to replicate an in-store experience.

AR try-on received attention, with Zero10 on hand to demonstrate its mirror technology. At its booth, the young start-up demonstrated its tech. Founder George Yashin shared several use cases, including allowing brands to place the mirrors in airports where they have little retail floor space, or in street-level windows to gain attention from passersby.

Zero10 has already partnered with Coach on deploying the technology in display windows. In the Coach case, they had 175,000 try-ons in a one-month span, and their preliminary survey data show that customers said they were three times more likely to purchase an item after the AR try-on.

“It’s like a new language,” said Yashin. “Brands like Coach can talk to a new generation. Guys like 15, 16 years old who wouldn’t normally enter a Coach store, they can interact with the bag and then they will go in the store. It’s a new way to engage interest.”

Zero10 has also worked with Tommy Hilfiger to deploy the mirrors in its Amsterdam wholesale showroom, so buyers could try on items without the brand having to produce physical samples. Zero10 is next partnering with Calvin Klein, also owned by Hilfiger parent PVH Corp., and will also place a mirror in-store at the new Fusalp flagship in Paris when it opens in September.

The hardware solution tech is growing, Yashin said, and reported that they have up to 20 requests a day from brands. Companies can purchase the system or rent it for short-term marketing projects or pop-ups. The 2.5-year-old start-up is expecting to grow to 2.5 million euros in revenue in 2023, up from zero last year.

Tmall Luxury Pavilion demonstrated its AR try-on app, which shows luxury accessories such as jewelry, watches and glasses, with the ability to try on if a customer places their hand, wrist or face in front of a phone’s camera. Items such as Cartier bracelets were rendered in 3D, which move around the screen with the flick of the finger. The app is intended for the Chinese market and only works in the Chinese language for now, a representative said.

Elsewhere, L’Oréal was on a diplomatic mission, and held a ceremony with South Korean Minister of SMEs and Startups Young Lee to sign a memo of understanding agreement. South Korea will join the company’s next round of its Big Bang Beauty Tech Startup Challenge, which was launched in China in 2020 and has so far been limited to competitors from that country.

Opening up to other countries in the region is key, said Fabrice Megarbane, president of L’Oréal North Asia and CEO of L’Oréal China. He added the north Asia zone is the second largest for the group, and accounted for nearly 30 percent of the group’s sales in 2022.

Particular areas of research that the company will engage in in South Korea are skin diagnosis and skin tech, powered by AI, representatives said.

L’Oréal deputy CEO Barbara Lavernos revealed one upcoming innovation that resulted from the group’s work with start-ups, the L’Oréal Professional showerhead that uses 69 percent less water. It will be rolled out to 100,000 hair salons worldwide later this year.

Last year’s hot topic — crypto — seems to have cooled, as talked turned to the latest developments in AI. The trade fair opened Wednesday with French President Emmanuel Macron announcing that the country will invest 500 million euros to develop AI projects.

Elon Musk will be the biggest name of the four-day convention, and is expected to appear on Friday."
EXCLUSIVE: LVMH Partners With Epic Games on 3D Technology for Immersive Experiences - Yahoo Singapore News,"Wed, 14 Jun 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vc2cubmV3cy55YWhvby5jb20vZXhjbHVzaXZlLWx2bWgtcGFydG5lcnMtZXBpYy1nYW1lcy0wOTExMDM1MTYuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS — LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton is teaming up with Fortnite creator Epic Games to create new immersive customer experiences, and add new tools to its design pipeline with 3D tech.

The Louis Vuitton and Dior parent company will utilize Epic’s suite of tools, including its real-time 3D creation tool Unreal Engine, as well as its 3D modelling tech Reality Capture. It will also utilize Epic’s Twinmotion and MetaHuman technology to create virtual fitting rooms and fashion shows, 360-view product carousels, AR experiences and digital twins for physical items.

More from WWD

The partnership will allow the company to create new experiences for its customers in virtual worlds. One of the first will be on display at the LVMH-sponsored VivaTech trade event.

Visitors to the conference will be able to virtually experience Louis Vuitton’s fall 2023 men’s show. Using Epic’s Unreal Engine 5, MetaHuman technology and Reality Capture, the company developed a six-minute immersive experience inside the show that took place in January. Users will be able to journey through the seven rooms of the set designed by director Michel Gondry, and see a selection of looks from the collection created by guest designer Colm Dillane.

The company is also looking to create more experiences like this, and could include more immersive experiences such as workshop tours — key for a company that is keen to put a heavy focus on its hand craftsmanship — or digital fashion shows in the future.

“The partnership with Epic Games will accelerate our expertise in 3D tools and ecosystems, from the creation of new collections to ad campaigns and to our maisons’ websites. We will also engage more effectively with young generations who are very much at ease with these codes and uses,” said LVMH group managing director Antonio Belloni.

“With this partnership, we will work with LVMH’s designers to transform physical and digital product creation using Epic’s suite of advanced creator tools. We are excited to accelerate the group’s adoption of Unreal Engine, Reality Capture, Twinmotion and MetaHuman technology, and help LVMH’s global brands engage with customers through immersive digital experiences,” says Bill Clifford, vice president of Unreal Engine at Epic Games.

The company is also debuting its Asnières immersion experience, a virtual reality tour that allows customers to explore the Louis Vuitton universe. Users will be able to participate in each step of the manufacturing process and observe the materials and finishes of Louis Vuitton products.

Also at VivaTech, LVMH revealed it will roll out contactless payments across iPhones and credit cards in the U.S. later this year. The tech will first be available in Sephora, Christian Dior, Celine, Tiffany & Co. and Louis Vuitton stores.

Adding the popular pay option will create a frictionless payment option for in-store customers, with no payment ceiling, as well as additional personalized product tools. It’s the next step in upgrading its clienteling strategy.

Introducing the new payment tech “will contribute to offering our customers a purchase experience that is fluid, transparent and protected. This solution also reflects the growing demand among our customers for contactless payment and digital wallet transactions,” added LVMH Group IT director Franck Le Moal.

The increasingly high-profile VivaTech will draw the likes of marquee names including French president Emmanuel Macron and Elon Musk to Paris for the four-day tech conference.

VivaTech will also see Dior unveil virutal consultations through augmented reality, through a partnership with Bambuser and Perfect Corp.

LVMH will announce on Thursday the winner of its annual Innovation Award at VivaTech.

Vogue Business and LVMH Thélios event: The power of luxury to elevate eyewear - Vogue Business,"Mon, 05 Jun 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZvZ3VlYnVzaW5lc3MuY29tL2V2ZW50cy92b2d1ZS1idXNpbmVzcy1hbmQtbHZtaC10aGVsaW9zLWV2ZW50LXRoZS1wb3dlci1vZi1sdXh1cnktdG8tZWxldmF0ZS1leWV3ZWFy0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Osculati continued this point, saying, “You can create this magic with the discussion between technical people bringing innovation and the creative team bringing the vision.

Moreover, values that are so deeply embedded in a brand can be challenging yet stimulating to implement in the eyewear category. Osculati alluded to a “ping pong” dynamic in the way Thélios works with its Maisons to deeply understand their DNA, what they stand for and how to translate this into eyewear.

Thinking about other challenges the industry faces, Fendi — in line with other LVMH brands — has remained resilient in spite of economic volatility. Brunschwig puts this down to continuous investment: “I think the most important thing is the long-term approach that we take to everything…building the desirability of the brand in the long term is the main objective. With an objective like this, you are invited to permanently create, invest, improve.” As part of this investment, Fendi built two new factories last year and acquired majority ownership in another manufacturing site in Tuscany. On 15 June, during Pitti Uomo, Fendi will host its showcase inside the factory in celebration of the brand’s craftsmanship and the stewardship of these skills.

Joining the conversation, Solca spoke about post-pandemic relief: “Nobody wanted to be the richest person in the graveyard. We have a higher willingness to spend, which we are seeing across certain categories…people are spending much more on everything…luxury companies are experiencing record growth; we are experiencing a very positive dynamic, especially in the higher end.” Looking at price segments, Solca says that the growth in spend from 2019 to 2022 is higher in the highest price point of consumer goods. This creates a strong justification for multi-brand retail businesses to invest in the luxury segment and focus more resource on selling at this level.

Solca also highlighted the pandemic as a tipping point in the way luxury brands communicate with both customers and stockists, explaining that new digital tools have encouraged a better dialogue throughout this ecosystem. In his view, it has led to improvements in clienteling that have been sustained long after lockdown, with the “double hatting” of sales associates, who play a vital role in maintaining relationships with clients, as well as selling in stores.

Brunschwig added that new omnichannel capabilities have given Fendi a lot more autonomy as a brand, saying it means a limited network of stores has an infinite reach capacity. When asked about how Fendi collaborates with multi-brand partners, he reinforced the point that Osculati made at the beginning of the conversation when talking about the exclusivity of distribution: “When it comes to distribution with department stores or optical stores like those in the room today, let's do it, but let's make sure first to be selective. It's impossible to do it well with an infinite number of [touch]points. It has to be the crème de la crème.” He also stressed the importance of people, as this is what makes the biggest difference compared to self-service online."
"From firing 9,000 people after a buyout and earning the nickname 'The Terminator', this is how LVMH CEO Bernard ... - Yahoo Finance","Thu, 01 Jun 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9iZXJuYXJkLWFybmF1bHQtbWFkZS1tb25leS0xMTUyNTg3NzEuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The founder and CEO of the luxury powerhouse LVMH, Bernard Arnault, has once again lost his crown as the richest person on the planet—but the billionaire is in no need of sympathy.

More from Fortune: 5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from home Looking to make extra cash? This CD has a 5.15% APY right now Buying a house? Here's how much to save This is how much money you need to earn annually to comfortably buy a $600,000 home

Tech tycoon, Elon Musk dethroned the French businessman from the top spot after shares of the latter’s LVMH tumbled by 2.6% on Wednesday.

Meanwhile, Musk the owner of Tesla and Twitter, saw his wealth jump 40.3% this year after shares of the electric car maker rose by about 24% in May.

According to a Bloomberg Billionaires tally, Musk’s net worth is now about $192 billion, compared to Arnault’s $187 billion.

The two have been playing a game of tug-of-war for the title of world’s richest person for over a year now, so Musk—who lost the prime position in very similar circumstances back in December 2022 when Tesla’s share price dropped—shouldn’t sit too comfortably.

Earlier this year in April, Arnault, saw his fortune surpass $200 billion for the first time before losing more than $11 billion in a single day the following month due to a shareprice bloodbath.

But for the average person—who earns less than £40,000 in the UK or around $60,000 in the U.S—the current small dip in Arnault’s fortune, is more money than they’ll see in a lifetime.

So how exactly did he become so rich in the first place?

An early taste for entrepreneurialism

In 1971, Arnault kick-started his career by working at his father’s real estate company, where he proved he had an entrepreneurial mind from a young age: A 25-year-old Arnault convinced his father to sell the construction side of the business and shift its focus to property.

He then traveled to the States in the hopes of growing his father’s empire there but instead was inspired by a taxi driver (who knew French couture, but not the French president) to go back home and forge a name for himself in the luxury sector.

Story continues

This is where Arnault's big break becomes a big mystery.

Some reports claim that the then 35-year-old businessman used $15 million from the family business to buy the failing luxury goods company that owned the fashion brand Christian Dior, Boussac Saint-Frères, in 1984.

Strangely, other reports claim that he acquired the near-bankrupt textile company for a ceremonious one franc.

However much he paid, Arnault took control of Boussac along with all of its assets—including Christian Dior, the department store Le Bon Marché, the retail shop Conforama, and the nappy manufacturer Peaudouce.

Fortune has reached out to LVMH to clarify the mysterious circumstances surrounding Dior’s acquisition —which now controls 41.4% of LVMH.

Arnault “the Terminator”

Following Arnault’s buyout of Boussac, the billionaire fired 9,000 people working for the company, sold off most of the group’s assets (except the Dior brand), and earned the nickname “the Terminator.”

But his tough approach worked: By 1987, the company started making profits, reportedly generating $112 million in earnings from a revenue stream of $1.9 billion.

He then set his eyes on Dior’s perfume division, which had been sold to Louis Vuitton Moët Hennessy.

It was then that a series of hostile takeovers and bold moves at the luxury powerhouse began—and saw Arnault come up on top.

But first, let's rewind to the birth of LVMH: In 1987 Henry Racamier, president of Louis Vuitton and Alain Chevalier, CEO of Moët Hennessy, teamed up to form the luxury group Louis Vuitton Moët Hennessy.

Within months of the merger Racamier and Chevalier fell out, so by the summer of 89, Racamier invited Arnault to invest in LVMH and help oust Moët’s chief.

But after tackling the first order of business, Arnault ousted Racamier too (from his own family business, no less). He spent $2.6 billion buying up shares in order to become the company's largest shareholder and eventually became its chairman and CEO by 1989.

In the years that followed, he continued to buy brands to bring them into the fold, and even secretly acquired a 20% stake in Hermès through its subsidiaries and via equity swaps.

LVMH's success

Today, LVMH has some 75 luxury brands in its portfolio and, under Arnault’s leadership, has grown to become the largest company (by market capitalization) in Europe.

Just last month, the Paris-headquartered conglomerate became the first European company ever to cross $500 billion in market valuation.

Its success directly impacts the wallet of Arnault, whose wealth is largely tied to LVMH’s shares, including a 97.5% stake in Dior.

And the 74-year-old businessman shows no signs of reining it in.

Although his five ultrawealthy children—all of whom hold senior roles at LVMH brands—are vying to one day take over, LVMH recently hiked its age limit for chief executives from 75 to 80.

Really, he's ""just getting started"". Reportedly, without a shred of irony, Arnault told the FT, ""We're still small... We are number one, but we can go further.”

Succession: Why LVMH leadership could hinge on the Paris Olympics - The Drinks Business,"Mon, 19 Jun 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWRyaW5rc2J1c2luZXNzLmNvbS8yMDIzLzA2L3N1Y2Nlc3Npb24td2h5LWx2bWgtbGVhZGVyc2hpcC1jb3VsZC1oaW5nZS1vbi10aGUtcGFyaXMtb2x5bXBpY3Mv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"News

By Ron Emler

Sunday 11 August 2024, the day the Paris summer Olympic Games will close, is being billed by the organisers as the biggest event ever held in France. It may also prove to be pivotal in determining the future leadership of luxury goods empire LVMH.

It could also go down as the day on which effectively Antoine Arnauld becomes the crowned prince of LVMH, chosen to succeed his father Bernard at the top of Europe’s biggest company.

It has been widely speculated that Bernard has been putting his five children into key positions in his US$500 billion luxury goods empire, giving them each the chance to prove themselves both to him and to significant investors that they are ready to step into his shoes when he steps down.

Last year Arnault Pere changed the LVMH articles of association to allow him to remain in the driving seat until his 80th birthday. That is just over five years away but seemingly he wants to ensure a smooth transition for his chosen offspring, a transfer of power that could come before then if he chooses.

Antoine, the oldest son, is vice-chairman of the Christian Dior fashion division and oversees Moët Hennessy. In addition he is in overall command of burnishing the LVMH reputation as the world’s premier purveyor of luxury items from couture and luggage to fine wines, watches and jewellery.

And it is Antoine, 46, who is reportedly about to sign a €164 million deal to put LVMH at the heart of the Paris Olympics.

That sum is just 0.2% of LVMH’s 2022 turnover but make a success of the sponsorship and his hands would be firmly on the levers of power when his father steps aside.

Antoine Arnault recently told shareholders that the Paris Olympics “will be the most watched event in the history of television, in the history of the games – a spectacular event.”

That may be hyperbole – the Beijing Games suffered a viewer decline from Rio in 2016 – but TV is only one element of a media programme and the build up to the 2024 event will make Paris the centre of global attention for much of the year.

The Olympics will provide an unrivalled shop window for LVMH up to the opening on July 26 and during the 350,000 hours of scheduled TV broadcasts around the world the organisers predict.

The deal will not make LVMH a long-term “Olympic Partner”, the group of global giants such as McDonald’s, Coca-Cola and Procter & Gamble, who spend billions on their continuing associations with the International Olympic Committee.

But both the French organisers and the IOC want a French icon to be a figurehead sponsor of the Paris event.

Antoine, it is reported, sees the 16 days of competition as an unrivalled opportunity to further underline to global consumers LVMH’s role as the epitome of French craftmanship and heritage.

One of his problems will be promoting the Moët Hennessy wines and spirits division because of the 1991 Loi Evan, which prohibits advertising and promotion of alcohol on French television and in cinemas.

That includes advertising at sports grounds where broadcast events are taking place.

For that reason, in France the Heineken Cup European Club rugby union competition is known only as the H Cup. Guinness can use its sponsorship of the Six Nations rugby championship only by substituting “Greatness” for its name on ground logos in its iconic black and white and using the familiar typeface.

But French law does not preclude alcohol promotion at events broadcast outside France nor in social media campaigns.

According to insiders, Antione is intent on using the sponsorship to enhance the entire LVMH luxury portfolio “without excessive displays of brand logos that could cheapen the image”.

So while medal winners will not be seen celebrating with bottles of Moët, LVMH’s Champagne stable will undoubtedly be to the fore in venue hospitality suites for the rich, famous and potential big spenders.

And LVMH itself will seek to impress the same guests at Paris hotels and restaurants.

The emphasis will be on non-alcohol brands but Antoine Arnault is set to make Paris 2024 a driver for further growth of LVMH luxury.

Not only that, the group will undoubtedly extend its Olympic involvement to cash in on its €500 million contribution to the rebuilding of Paris’ Notre Dame cathedral five and a half years after it was ravaged by fire. The reopening is scheduled for December 2024.

Add to the prestige of LVMH and the desirability of its stable of 75 global brands in 2024 and Antoine will be pole position among the five siblings to eventually succeed his father."
"LVMH, Eon, Rubi: Everything That Happened at the Global Fashion Summit - WWD","Thu, 29 Jun 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3dkLmNvbS9zdXN0YWluYWJpbGl0eS9zb2NpYWwtaW1wYWN0L2dsb2JhbC1mYXNoaW9uLXN1bW1pdC0yMDIzLWx2bWgtdGFsa3MtZXZlbnQtMTIzNTcxOTI3NC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"COPENHAGEN — Businesses and brands touted their sustainability innovations and also revealed that more green work needs to be done at the annual Global Fashion Summit, which took place here earlier this week.

More than 1,000 attendees and 138 speakers representing 28 countries gathered in Copenhagen at the event, which was called “Ambition to Action.”

Among the speakers was Antoine Arnault, LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton’s head of communication, image and environment. He was in conversation with British fashion designer Jonathan Anderson, creative director of Loewe and JW Anderson.

Nicolaj Reffstrup, founder of Ganni, also spoke, as did Fanny Moizant, cofounder and president of Vestiaire Collective; Aude Vergne, chief sustainability officer at Chloé, and Natasha Franck, chief executive officer and founder of Eon.

Some used the stage to unveil new initiatives.

Twin sisters Neeka and Leila Mashouf, the scientists behind Rubi, revealed their partnership with Danish brand Ganni to create the first yarn made directly from carbon emissions.

“I spent 10 years in tech. I remember when I entered the fashion industry, it always struck me as surprising how little innovation happens inside these big brands. It’s all caught up around the product and the look,” said Reffstrup.

Anders Wøggsborg, senior customer sustainability partner at Maersk, this year’s top sponsor, revealed that next month the shipping and logistics company will roll out six methanol-powered vessel containers.

The Global Fashion Agenda, the nonprofit organizers of the summit, revealed the launch of the Global Textiles Policy Forum, a platform for government and textile industry officials to connect and amplify supply chain efficiency.

The United Nations Environment Program and U.N. Climate Change published their second Sustainable Fashion Communication Playbook, a guide to navigating sustainability in a positive way.

During his conversation with Anderson, Arnault argued that luxury goods are inherently sustainable.

“That’s what makes them so special. They are made from the highest-quality materials, they are durable, they are repairable. That’s what separates us from the rest of the fashion industry,” he said.

He added that when he started at Berluti 10 years ago, the idea of “scratched and scarred leather” was rejected by the teams. He told the industrial teams that he preferred the imperfect leather, which has become the preferred leather of choice for the brand’s customers.

“It shows that there is a change in perception of beauty from the client that is beginning to accept small differences,” said Arnault.

His answers garnered mixed reactions in the lobby after the talk, with some guests criticizing Pharrell Williams‘ gigantic debut show for Louis Vuitton men’s.

Antoine Arnault and Jonathan Anderson Sara Galbiati

Onstage Arnault didn’t shy away from discussing LVMH’s numerous shows a year outside of the ready-to-wear calendar. Three years ago he had anticipated that the pace of shows would slow down.

“They haven’t slowed down. What’s very important is that we do them differently. We used to export an entire show and do another one in L.A., Seoul and Hawaii. Now we use local communities, local productions and local castings,” he said.

“It’s important in terms of creation, and business,” he added.

Rachel Arthur, advocacy lead for sustainable fashion at the United Nations Environment Program, disagreed with Arnault.

“Fashion shows are super important for creativity and business value. They are one of the most successful examples of fashion communication,” she said, explaining that their unsustainable levels of production and consumption means they are significantly contributing to the industry not being able to reach its sustainability targets.

She suggested that consumers and businesses should not only think about carbon footprint, but also about the “brain print,” which refers to the volume of product they directly consume as a result of marketing.

During the in-conversation, Anderson said sustainability concerns are top of mind among the new generation of designers.

He said during hiring processes at Loewe, young fashion school graduates always ask him about the company’s sustainable credentials, something which was not discussed when he was a student at Central Saint Martins.

As an LVMH Prize jury member, he said that 90 percent of the collections he sees have a sustainable angle.

During the summit, Vestiaire’s Moizant, Chloé’s Vergne and Franck of Eon reaffirmed their partnership, and talked about what they believe the future holds. It was revealed in February that Chloé would partner with Vestiaire Collective and technology startup Eon on digitizing their luxury goods for instant resale.

“[Products IDs] will be the future of how brands actually sell to customers. They will know the exact profile of users’ closets,” said Franck, adding that brands will be able to manage and use their products while adding value to them, something she believes has been lost in the traditional shopping process.

Crown Princess Mary of Denmark, patron of Global Fashion Agenda and the summit, kicked off the two-day event with an address urging the audience to “show the world how a complex industry can transform to one that protects the fragility of and conserves our natural world, to one that gives more to people, societies and the economy.”

She added that while progress may be incremental, it is “nevertheless promising, as it demonstrates that scalability has potential,” she added.

The princess also took an opportunity to focus on the positives, such as the 28 percent growth of the secondhand clothing sector in 2022, adding that by 2024, 10 percent of the global apparel market is expected to be made up of secondhand clothing.

“When we are brainstorming, designing or researching potential solutions to achieve a net positive industry by 2030, we are looking at the world we are living in a holistic way, putting humans and society at the center is insufficient,” said the crown princess, who spoke to a 7-year-old activist as she came off the stage.

Guests drew a number of fresh ideas from the two-day event, which wrapped on Wednesday.

Sarah AlHamdan, founder and creative director of the clothing brand Mood of Thought, said having attended the summit, she’s now considering “a take-back program” for her brand.

Mood of Thought was the among the first labels to use LVMH surplus fabrics in the U.K. It also offers a lifetime tailoring service to customers in partnership with Sojo, the London-based clothing alterations app.

“For resale, every care label includes a QR code representing an authenticity stamp of Mood of Thought’s goods. The code also gives access to product materials to support after-care, resale and recycling if needed,” said AlHamdan.

The Global Fashion Summit concluded with a party hosted by Moët Hennessy at The Plant Cph, an old factory that has been transformed into an events space.

Alexandre Capelli, group environment deputy director at LVMH, took to the stage to talk about Château Galoupet Rosé Cru Classe, which is the first rosé wine to be bottled in recycled amber glass.

Dancers walked around dressed as rainforests. They posed for photos with guests on the step and repeat. Halfway through the sit-down dinner, they made an appearance on the stage, dancing with glow sticks to Destiny’s Child’s “Survivor,” and Lorde’s “Greenlight.”

The Copenhagen summit held its first international edition in Singapore last year. They chose the location as Asia Pacific regions account for 75 percent of garment workers worldwide."
Can fashion prizes fix the industry? - Jing Daily,"Mon, 26 Jun 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vamluZ2RhaWx5LmNvbS9wb3N0cy9mYXNoaW9uLXByaXplcy1ndWlkZS0yMDIzLWx2bWgtd29vbG1hcmvSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"It’s not easy setting up a fashion brand these days. Just ask designer Sander Lak, whose beloved, rainbow-hued brand Sies Marjan shuttered amid the Covid-19 pandemic after only five years in business. Or Christopher Kane, whose namesake brand is facing economic collapse . Or Elena Velez and Kerby Jean-Raymond , who have both struggled to pay employees despite celebrity endorsements and critical acclaim.

But the fashion industry can’t survive if young talent can’t successfully develop the next big brand; the vast network of fashion awards attempts to help young designers overcome the logistical and financial hurdles many face.

“Prizes such as the Woolmark Prize have become a lifeline and saving grace for many emerging brands,” says Nigerian designer Adeju Thompson, founder of the Lagos Space Programme and winner of this year’s International Woolmark Prize.

A 2021 LVMH Prize semi-finalist, Thompson is no stranger to the benefits of fashion prizes. The injection of $136,942 (AU$200,000) in funding, access to mentorship and a global retail network as a result of winning the Woolmark Prize gives Thompson the chance to supercharge Lagos Space Programme’s trajectory.

“By virtue of being a Woolmark prize winner, I have been provided access to the same information as the biggest brands in the world have,” Thompson says.

A six-figure prize is nothing to sniff at for designers who may be struggling to pay off debts. But for some, what really makes a fashion prize valuable in the long-term isn’t the money. Fashion programs intended to foster talent have offered up their own propositions for how to make the transition from emerging designer to sustainable brand more achievable.

“There are some things that you cannot buy with money,” says Barbara Franchin, founder of the Trieste, Italy-based incubator International Talent Support (ITS). For 20 years, ITS has staged an annual fashion prize that awards designers both prize money and a week-long collaborative residency in Trieste.

“We don't give 200 or 300,000 euros, because we don't think that the person at this stage can manage this money,” says Franchin. “We give them visibility, we give them confidence. We open a network here.”

Franchin has ensured that prize applications don’t go to waste. In 2023, ITS opened the ITS Arcademy Museum of Art in Fashion in Trieste to showcase the tens of thousands of portfolios it has received over the years as well as the designs created at ITS residencies.

In May 2023, ITS Arcademy - Museum of Art in Fashion, the first museum entirely dedicated to emerging design talent, was inaugurated in Italy. Photo: Courtesy

That long-term support is crucial as fashion brands can fall just as quickly as they rise.

“For emerging design talents, being catapulted onto the global stage can be overwhelming and daunting,” says John Roberts, managing director of The Woolmark Company. “It’s our role to provide solutions to these challenges.”

Fashion prizes are a reflection of the industry’s values. In 2021, Los Angeles designer Mike Amiri launched the Amiri Prize. With backing from OTB Group, which also supports the Andam Prize and Yu Prize, the Amiri Prize offers $100,000 to an up-and-coming designer with the goal of making the industry more inclusive. The inaugural prize went to Black queer designer Lou Badger , who spent years working in the Philadelphia educational system before launching a fashion brand that deploys upcycled materials.

“It was challenging to find opportunities that were open to folks like me who didn't receive a formal education in a creative field, or had a significant and established following,” says Badger. “I was motivated to apply for the Amiri Prize because of the explicit emphasis on inclusion and nurturing talent from nontraditional backgrounds.”

For Badger, coming from a non-fashion background made the mentorship aspect the most valuable part of the Amiri Prize, but each applicant will have their own motivations in seeking out awards. “I would advise emerging designers looking to apply for a prize to conserve their energy by researching, asking questions, and determining the prize that most aligns to their needs and goals,” Badger says.

Fashion prizes aren’t just beneficial for young talents. The powerful companies backing fashion prizes are themselves competing, not for money, but for the more intangible prize of being aligned with the next big thing in fashion.

LVMH established its own namesake award in 2013, which offered early career support to the likes of Virgil Abloh and has grown to become one of fashion’s most illustrious accolades. An LVMH Prize nomination can be a massive boost for young designers, but it’s equally valuable for LVMH to be associated with emerging talent of Grace Wales Bonner or Shayne Oliver. LVMH needs the LVMH Prize, says Franchin.

The fashion prize network is expanding and evolving, with prize bodies offering everything from cash windfalls to valuable fashion week slots. We’ve rounded up a few of the top prizes and what they offer emerging talent.

Suffice to say, the annual prize from the fashion conglomerate that reaps nearly $90 billion in annual revenue offers one of the most talked-about – and financially lucrative – prizes. Conceived by Delphine Arnault, daughter of LVMH CEO Bernard Arnault and current CEO of LVMH property Dior, the prize is open to designers under the age of 40 with at least two collections under their belt. The most recent winner, Japanese designer Satoshi Kuwata of Setchu, was announced earlier this month, chosen by a jury of largely LVMH brand designers, like Nicolas Ghesquière of Louis Vuitton and Kim Jones of Dior and Fendi.

For two decades, International Talent Support has shown an eye for honoring disruptive talent like a pre-Balenciaga and Vetements Demna and Aitor Throup. The prize has expanded in those years too, to cover footwear, jewelry and photography as well as apparel design. But the contest, which is open to emerging designers, is unique in that it offers all nominees a collaborative residency at ITS’ newly opened museum in Trieste, Italy, with their work also displayed at the museum.

With backing from the French Ministry of Culture, the Andam (National Association for the Development of the Fashion Arts) awards recognize young fashion talent who have a business based in France. The jury includes an eclectic mix of fashion business leaders like Balenciaga CEO Cédric Charbit and activists like Quannah Chasinghorse-Potts. This year’s finalists, including Duran Lantink and GmbH, were unveiled in May, with the winners to be announced at the end of this month.

A new arrival, the Amiri Prize was established by Los Angeles-based designer Mike Amiri to help foster inclusivity in fashion. The inaugural award went to the Black, queer and gender-neutral designer Lou Badger. For its second edition, the US-based prize opened up to international applicants and counts the likes of stylist Law Roach and Rocco Liu of GQ China among its jurists.

On naming an 18-year-old Yves Saint Laurent as a winner in 1954, the Woolmark Prize set a high bar for itself when it comes to identifying young talent. But that isn’t really the primary goal of the prize: the Woolmark Company-backed award was first conceived to highlight and promote the use of wool in the fashion industry. The prize has gone through various iterations in its history, with the most recent version launched in 2012 and open to mens and womenswear designers from around the world. Today’s jury is made up of the likes of photographer Tyler Mitchell and footwear designer Salehe Bembury, who last month named Adeju Thompson as winner of the 2023 edition.

Set in the modernist Villa Noailles mansion in the Mediterranean town of Hyères, the Festival d’Hyères might win out for the most idyllic location for a fashion festival and accompanying prize. With numerous backers like Mercedes-Benz, Chanel and LVMH, the prize offers not only monetary awards but visibility at some of fashion’s most influential houses. The festival has added a number of prizes to its ranks since its founding, like the Mercedes-Benz Sustainability Prize in 2021."
Top Fashion Stories of the Week: June 9 - HYPEBEAST,"Fri, 09 Jun 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vaHlwZWJlYXN0LmNvbS8yMDIzLzYvdG9wLWZhc2hpb24tbmV3cy1zYXRvc2hpLWt1d2F0YS1zZXRjaHUtbHZtaC1wcml6ZS1nYWJyaWVsYS1oZWFyc3QtY2hsb2UtcGF0YWdvbmlhLWdhcNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"This week, the fashion industry offered lots to discuss. Among the many headlines, the 2023 LVMH Prize was presented to Setchu by Satoshi Kuwata at the Fondation Louis Vuitton in Paris, marking a huge achievement for the rising designer. Meanwhile, reports surfaced claiming that Gabriela Hearst is preparing to exit the helm of Chloé. Before she does, though, the label will become the first fashion house to collaborate with Angelina Jolie’s newly-established label, Atelier Jolie.

Elsewhere, Patagonia settled its trademark infringement lawsuit with GAP; ENHYPEN was named Prada’s newest brand ambassador, and Jacquemus unveiled its new Portofino pop-up. Below, Hypebeast has rounded up the top fashion stories of the week so you can stay up to date on trends in the industry.

At the Fondation Louis Vuitton in Paris on Wednesday, Setchu by Satoshi Kuwata took home the 2023 LVMH Prize for Young Designers, earning a grand prize of €400,000 EUR and a year-long mentorship from LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton’s experts in sustainability, communications, marketing, legal, production and finance.

Notably, Kuwata beat out roughly 2,400 applicants from 15 countries to win the highly-coveted prize, which has previously been presented to designers including S.S. Daley, Nensi Dojaka, Thebe Magugu, Marine Serre, Grace Wales Bonner and more. For the 2023 edition, he was up against eight impressive finalists, including Luar by Raul Lopez, Diotima by Rachel Scott, Aaron Esh, Paolina Russo, Lucile Guilmard, Burç Akyol and Quira by Veronica Leoni.

Meanwhile, the Karl Lagerfeld Prize was given to two designers: Bettter by Julie Pelipas (Ukraine) and Magliano by Luca Maglliano (Italy). Both labels will receive €200,000 EUR prizes, along with one-year mentorships from LVMH.

Gabriela Hearst is reportedly set to step down as Chloé’s creative director, after a three-year stint at the brand’s helm.

The designer, who is expected to debut her last collection for the label for Spring 2024 during Paris Fashion Week in September, has led the brand through impressive revenue gains throughout her tenure. According to sources close to the brand, Hearst’s exit is “amicable,” and she is expected to focus more closely on her own brand, as well as other various projects.

It is not known who will take over at Chloé, following Hearst’s departure.

Patagonia Inc. officially settled its trademark infringement lawsuit with GAP Inc. earlier this week, marking the end to a saga that began in November, when Patagonia filed a lawsuit against the American clothing brand for allegedly copying its Snap-T pocket design. While details were not released to the public, the judge dismissed the case after both brands agreed to drop their claims.

“The GAP infringements have caused or are likely to cause dilution of Patagonia’s famous and distinctive mark by diminishing its distinctiveness and singular association with Patagonia,” the company said. “Given how derivative the GAP Infringements are of Patagonia’s original designs and logo, there is no question that GAP’s copying has been willful and deliberate.”

The lawsuit followed a slew of similar cases made by Patagonia against brands including Walmart and Robin Ruth in relation to its “P-6” Trout Logo.

After announcing her own fashion house, Atelier Jolie, just a few weeks ago, Angelina Jolie on Tuesday revealed that her consumer-centric label will launch its first collection in collaboration with Chloé.

Choé said that the forthcoming capsule will offer an “exercise in modern with feminity” and celebrate “authentic women-to-women connections. Designed by Chloé’s creative director Gabriela Hearst and Jolie, the line will honor both label’s goals of “improving social and environmental sustainability with greater transparency and accountability.” It will reportedly feature a high percentage of low-impact materials.

More details, including a release date, will be announced at a later time.

Prada named K-pop group ENHYPEN its latest brand ambassador on Friday, in an effort to strengthen its relationship with the burgeoning group and their ever-expanding fanbase.

Notably, members Jungwon, Heeseung, Jay, Jake, Sunghoon, Sunoo and Ni-Ki attended their first Prada show in Milan in January earlier this year. “We’re delighted and honored to be a part of this partnership as new brand ambassadors of Prada,” said ENHYPEN. “The synergy Prada and Enhypen will create is something we’re very excited to witness and greatly looking forward to.”

The boy band only entered the scene in 2020, and it has already attracted a massive fanbase, with almost 13 million followers on Instagram.

After staging a pop-up shop in Lake Como, Jacquemus has opened up a new temporary location in Portofino, Italy. The latest outpost will house the next installment in the brand’s Éte capsule in Via Calata Marconi, the menswear location for multi-brand retailer Modes.

The 1,735-square-foot store features a selection of French Riviera-inspired men’s and women’s ready-to-wear pieces. On social media, the designer teased a selection of items stocked inside the outpost, including his signature straw hats and the Chiquito and Le Bisuo bags, among other quintessential items.

The label also revealed that its next pop-up location will open somewhere in France, but further details are being kept under wraps for now.

Telfarhas scheduled the fifth and final installment of its famous Bag Security sale. From June 16 to 18, consumers will have their last chance to shop Telfar’s full catalog without competition. And this time around, the brand will offer its fastest-ever delivery, with bags beginning to ship within two weeks of the program’s conclusion.

The brand’s decision to drop the unlimited sale strategy comes as it looks to restrategize its business model. In an effort to stray from mainstream social media platforms, Telfar plans to rely more heavily on its own TELFARTV streaming platform and its hotly-anticipated brick-and-mortar outposts (coming in 2024), among other channels, for future growth."
LVMH's Bernard Arnault Makes Surprise Visit to Beijing - Yahoo Canada Finance,"Tue, 27 Jun 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vY2EuZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9sdm1oLWJlcm5hcmQtYXJuYXVsdC1tYWtlcy1zdXJwcmlzZS0xMjQxMjg4NDUuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"SHANGHAI — Bernard Arnault, chairman and chief executive officer of LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, landed in Beijing on Tuesday, visiting key retail locations in the country’s capital city.

For his first post-pandemic China visit, Arnault made stops at SKP Beijing, China World Mall and WF Central in downtown Beijing and conducted store visits at LVMH brands such as Dior, Tiffany & Co., Louis Vuitton, Loro Piana, Fendi and Bulgari.

More from WWD

According to social media posts shared on Xiaohongshu, the social-commerce platform, Arnault was accompanied by his daughter, Delphine Arnault, chairman and CEO of Christian Dior Couture; his youngest son, Jean Arnault, director of marketing and development, Louis Vuitton watches, and other top executives at LVMH.

According to Xiaohongshu, Arnault spent a particular amount of time at Dior boutiques. He also made a quick stop at Hermès‘ SKP Beijing store.

Bernard Arnault and Delphine Arnault were seen leaving a Tiffany & Co. store at WF Central in Beijing Tuesday afternoon.

The Arnault entourage also stopped at The Espace Louis Vuitton in Beijing, a cultural and art space adjacent to the China World Mall that opened in 2017.

An LVMH spokesperson declined to comment on Arnault’s China itinerary, but it is believed the LVMH chief will travel to Chengdu, then Shanghai, both key retail hubs for the luxury goods conglomerate in China.

In April, Arnault and senior members of the LVMH management team met with Wang Wentao, China’s Minster of Commerce, in Paris. Arnault revealed that LVMH will participate in the sixth China International Import Expo in Shanghai later this year. Wang expressed his satisfaction with the strength and diversity of the world’s largest luxury group’s commitment to China, praising the “many commercial and cultural contributions” made by various brands under the group.

Arnault’s China visit comes after a series of high-profile trips made by luxury executives to the country in recent months. Last Feburary, François-Henri Pinault, chairman and CEO of Kering, became the first luxury executive to visit China since the country reopened last December.

Story continues

Arnault’s expected China visit was first reported by Reuters earlier this month.

China’s post-COVID-19 recovery helped lift LVMH’s first-quarter revenue by 17 percent. Asia, excluding Japan, registered 14 percent growth in the first quarter. Despite a swift rebound for the first half of 2023, an impending slowdown in the market meant that luxury players will continue to court big spenders in a bid to sustain the high level of growth seen during the past decade.

Louis Vuitton and Dior, two of the largest brands at LVMH, have been revamping their existing flagships and opening up exclusive salons to better serve super VIPs in China.

From LVMH to Tesla: 8 Best Stocks of Luxury Brands - U.S News & World Report Money,"Mon, 05 Jun 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQGh0dHBzOi8vbW9uZXkudXNuZXdzLmNvbS9pbnZlc3Rpbmcvc2xpZGVzaG93cy9iZXN0LWx1eHVyeS1zdG9ja3PSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"As the rich get richer, stocks of luxury goods companies stand to benefit. The S&P Global Luxury Index is up 12.6% over the last year and 15.2% in 2023 through June 2, riding a once-again rising stock market as fears of a recession fade with better inflation numbers and the abating of the debt-ceiling crisis.

Short version: If it's on for the economy, as evidenced by an 11.5% climb for the S&P 500 after last year's bear market, it's probably on a little bit more for luxury-goods companies and their investors.

""These stocks are relatively resilient,"" says Roxanna Islam, associate director of research at exchange-traded fund research house VettaFi. ""A huge turndown in consumer spending would hurt, but these stocks are outperforming consumer discretionary year to date.""



Consumer-spending growth slowed some on recession fears in recent months, but it did not reach a standstill, Islam says. The near-term future will depend on the state of the U.S. consumer and the often-bumpy path of the post-COVID economy in China, an emerging luxury market, she says.

""People who have money will continue to spend,"" she says. ""Then there's a middle tier of consumer that's aspirational. It's the lower-income consumers and stores that are seeing the most pressure.""

You can see it in the exchange-traded funds that follow luxury indexes and invest in luxury goods. Amundi S&P Global Luxury UCITS ETF (ticker: LUXU), for example, has ridden big bets on companies including Tesla Inc. (TSLA), Compagnie Financière Richemont SA (CFRUY) and LVMH Moët Hennessey Louis Vuitton SE (LVMUY) to track the S&P Global Luxury Index's 15% gain in 2023.

But there aren't many luxury ETFs, meaning that investors who want exposure often go straight to investing in the underlying stocks. So here is a look at some luxury-goods companies that may see big returns if the economy avoids a 2023 downturn. Execution counts, so do your research on the latest movement in luxury brand stocks in general right now:



Luxury stock YTD return as of June 2 Tesla Inc. (TSLA) 73.7% LVMH Moët Hennessey Louis Vuitton SE (LVMUY) 23.8% Toll Brothers Inc. (TOL) 44% Compagnie Financière Richemont SA (CFRUY) 24.2% Kering SA (PPRUY) 9.8% Ferrari NV (RACE) 40.4% Tapestry Inc. (TPR) 12.1% Estée Lauder Cos. Inc. (EL) -23.6%

Tesla Inc. (TSLA)

The Texas-based automaker's shares are up 74% in 2023 as of June 2, after a chaotic 2022 in which CEO Elon Musk led a group that bought Twitter and saw Tesla's stock fall by two-thirds from its peak after September. Tesla still has a long way to go to make up the lost ground, but it has the substantial advantage of having the secular momentum of the long-term shift to electric vehicles behind it.

The company now plans to roll out its delayed Cybertruck pickup in the second half of 2023, and its Model 3 sedan and Model Y crossover are among the 10 best-selling vehicles in America. That's not just among electric cars: It includes gasoline-powered models. In fact, the Model Y is outsold only by pickups, the category Tesla is about to enter, according to Goodcarbadcar.net.

The big stock drop has done a lot to address long-standing complaints that Tesla shares are overvalued, but they're still not cheap. The share price is currently 62 times this year's average earnings estimate of $3.44 a share, but EPS estimates run as high as $4.13. The difference is analysts' assumptions about whether the Cybertruck will be ready and how well it will do.

Thomson Reuters puts the average 2024 Tesla profit estimate at $4.86, but bulls argue that it could be as high as $8.31, putting TSLA at a price-earnings ratio of roughly 25, which is higher than average but not supercharged.

The questions around Tesla are always about new competition and its mercurial CEO. The company's oft-changing pricing strategy and questions about whether Musk is distracted by Twitter and his other companies are likely to keep the debate around the closely watched stock lively. But Wedbush analyst Dan Ives argues that Tesla can bring down production costs, especially on batteries, fast enough to make up for recent price cuts.

""While this innovation is happening to occur in a murkier backdrop, we believe Tesla is set to establish further dominance in this market with battery costs front and center,"" Ives says. ""The near-term margin pain for long-term demand/volume gain is a strategy the Street is mostly on board with.""

LVMH Moët Hennessey Louis Vuitton SE (LVMUY)

LVMH shares have gained 174.3% over the last five years – crushing the 56.6% gain for the S&P 500. They cost 28 times this year's profits over the trailing 12 months and 22 times what analysts expect for next year.

The Paris-based company lives at the intersection of above-average growth and very wide profit margins, a neighborhood as fancy as Moët champagne or Louis Vuitton luggage. LVMH isn't sold on U.S. exchanges, but you can buy over-the-counter, or OTC, shares.

First-quarter sales this year rose 17%, with watches and jewelry matching the 11% gain of perfumes and cosmetics. Leather goods sales climbed 18%, with LVMH's retail unit posting a 30% gain.

Best of all, gross profit margins at LVMH topped 68%, and operating margins last year were nearly 27%. LVMH isn't buying back much of its own stock, implying that management sees ways to use its cash flow to invest in growth.

Toll Brothers Inc. (TOL)

A little less rarefied than Louis Vuitton luggage, perhaps, Toll Brothers is still one of the most high-end public homebuilders in the U.S. – and is benefiting from the scarcity of existing homes on the market, according to CEO Douglas Yearley. Blame higher interest rates, which are making millions of homeowners with cheap loans stay where they are. That pushes trade-up buyers toward new homes and new homebuilders such as Toll Brothers, which offers incentives to make up for near-term interest rate spikes.

Shares are up 44% year to date as of June 2, thanks in part to an average sale price that topped a company-record $1 million in the quarter that ended in April. The company said nearly a quarter of recent buyers pay cash for their homes.

""We saw demand start to improve in January,"" Yearley said in the company's most recent quarterly earnings call. ""The shock of last year's abrupt spike in rates appears to be wearing off, and buyers are moving on with their lives.""

Compagnie Financière Richemont SA (CFRUY)

The owner of Cartier watches and Van Cleef & Arpels jewelry is the world's third-biggest luxury brand, behind LVMH and Estée Lauder Companies Inc. (EL), and has seen its shares climb 44.4% in the past year. That approaches a 60% gain in profit from continuing operations for the fiscal year ending in March 2023. Strength in Japan and across Europe offset COVID-related slowdowns in China and Macao, the company said.

""The United States will not be as buoyant as a year ago,"" Richemont chairman Johnann Rupert said in a remarkable May 12 rant in which he slammed U.S. banking regulators. ""Will it return? Yes. Will it be soon? I actually think we're in for a harder landing than we hope for because we do expect it. Will it affect us? Yes. It will affect everybody. However, we're lucky, as we've said a few years ago, we fly on five engines. One engine has a misfire. We've got four more engines, so at the time that it may slow down, China is picking up.""

Kering SA (PPRUY)

The parent of Gucci, Alexander McQueen and Yves Saint Laurent has underperformed the wider market so far this year, but not egregiously.

Gucci led the way for the company in 2022 with 35% sales growth, Kering said at a May 12 analyst meeting. The first quarter of 2023 saw a big slowdown in growth, but it was rebounding near the end of the quarter, the company said. The company is culling the ranks of its wholesale partners to maintain exclusivity, which sent wholesale sales lower in the first quarter at Gucci, which accounts for more than half of Kering's sales.

With trailing earnings per share of $3.19 this year, Kering trades around 17 times earnings. Earnings growth is expected to rebound by next year, too – whether it does will determine whether the stock was a good bet at today's prices.

Bayerische Motoren Werke AG (BMWYY)

Rival Mercedes-Benz Group AG (MBGYY) is a top-weighted stock in S&P's luxury index, but BMW has been the better performer in the last year, rising nearly 30%. EV sales rose 108% last year, and first-quarter 2023 total revenue climbed 18% while profit before interest and taxes rose 59% to 5.4 billion euros ($5.8 billion).

The company is far enough along on its EV program that it's now letting investment in research and development slide as a percentage of revenues, letting free cash flow reach 11 billion euros ($11.8 billion) last year, the company said in a presentation to investors in May. That's expected to be enough to both fund an ambitious capital-spending plan for EV conversion and buy back 10% of the company's stock by 2027.

Ferrari NV (RACE)

Shares of the Italian sports-car maker have been flying faster than its 296 GTB in the video game Fortnite, rising 40.4% year to date as of June 2. Revenue climbed almost 20% last year, and earnings per share rose 14%.

The hairpin curve here is a stock price that's roughly 43 times this year's projected profits after its surge, with analysts projecting that growth will slow after this year. ""RACE maintained prior 2023 guidance, but we believe the company is just being conservative, setting the stage for a guidance raise later this year,"" CFRA Research analyst Garrett Nelson says. ""Ferrari's decision several years ago to not cap its annual vehicle production around 7,000 to 8,000 units continues to pay off, and we view it as largely protected from broader consumer headwinds.""

Tapestry Inc. (TPR)

The parent of Coach New York, Kate Spade New York and Stuart Weitzman has a different problem than Ferrari: Its stock is up a solid but comparatively pedestrian 12.1% in 2023 as of June 2 and remains cheap. The company intends to use $1 billion for buybacks and dividends this year, which is more than 10% of its current market value.

The company said in May that first-quarter results beat expectations, and it raised its forecast for the rest of the year. But Morgan Stanley analyst Alex Straton said the company's explanation of its results may point to a growth slowdown next year, and rates the stock equal-weight, meaning it will rise or fall about as much as the market.

Estée Lauder Cos. Inc. (EL)

A big name going through a rough patch describes Estée Lauder. The second-largest luxury goods company has seen its shares drop 23.6% in 2023 as of June 2, all since February, on a pair of poorly received earnings reports, hampered by slow emergence from the pandemic in parts of Asia.

Morgan Stanley stock analyst Dara Mohsenian noted big issues in the company's duty-free store sales to travelers, as well as the prestige beauty market in China. But Morgan kept its overweight rating on Estée Lauder, saying ""there should be a strong EPS recovery that eventually plays out as Asia recovers post-COVID."""
