The Business of Fashion website raises £1.3m and backing from LVMH - The Guardian,"Mon, 18 Feb 2013 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9tZWRpYS8yMDEzL2ZlYi8xOC9idXNpbmVzcy1vZi1mYXNoaW9uLXdlYnNpdGUtYmFja2luZ9IBUWh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9tZWRpYS8yMDEzL2ZlYi8xOC9idXNpbmVzcy1vZi1mYXNoaW9uLXdlYnNpdGUtYmFja2luZw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"A fashion business website, spawned from a personal blog of a former management consultant from his flat in Notting Hill, has raised £1.3m in funding from a group of investors.

The Business of Fashion, an online journal started five years ago by Canadian Imran Amed, won the backing from prestigious companies including Louis Vuitton Moet Hennessy.

Also set to take a stake in the website is Index Ventures, which already has a stake in Net-a-Porter and Asos, Samos Investments, which has invested in Ocado and Betfair, and Carmen Busquets, a founding investor in Net-a-Porter.

Tech and media investment firm Novel TMT Ventures and Advancit Capital, an early-stage media and tech fund launched by CBS/Viacom's vice-chairman Shari Redstone, have also taken a stake.

The site, which attracts 150,000 users a month, was started by Amed six years ago from his flat in London. A Harvard MBA graduate, he had worked for McKinsey & Company but says he found his creative ambitions unfulfilled and quit to explore a new career in the media.

""I felt I was only using one side of my brain, so I took a risk and left. I tried music and TV but there was always a clear separation between creative and commercial and in fashion it was just a bit fuzzier,"" he said.

He began posting musings about fashion on a blog and as he became more prolific found he was building a dedicated following and highly engaged community who wanted to track his analysis of fashion trends, economics, and consumer behaviour.

Unlike fashion blogs such as The Sartorialist, which concentrate on style trends, Amed focuses on the business.

His Twitter account has nearly 600,000 followers and a photo of Chanel chief Karl Lagerfeld he posted on Instagram had 1,200 likes. Across all social media the site has 800,000 users.

His success in raising $2.1m (£1.35m) in seed capital will be of interest to bloggers around the world who find it difficult to convert traffic highs into cash.

""I was just writing on a blog and I didn't really imagine that six years later that I would be raising money,"" said Amed.

""What happened is we have started building this community and this community gathers around this website. Now that we have regular engagement from users, that is what the investors have bought into,"" he added.

The site is still being run on a lean budget but he hopes to have hired up to 10 staff, mainly tech and commercial, within the year and get to work on building events and other brand extensions to generate revenue.

"Business Of Fashion Gets $2.1M Seed Funding From Index, LVMH And More For Its No-Nonsense B2B Fashion Blog - TechCrunch","Mon, 18 Feb 2013 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiwFodHRwczovL3RlY2hjcnVuY2guY29tLzIwMTMvMDIvMTgvYnVzaW5lc3Mtb2YtZmFzaGlvbi1nZXRzLTItMW0tc2VlZC1mdW5kaW5nLWZyb20taW5kZXgtbHZtaC1hbmQtbW9yZS1mb3ItaXRzLW5vLW5vbnNlbnNlLWIyYi1mYXNoaW9uLWJsb2cv0gGPAWh0dHBzOi8vdGVjaGNydW5jaC5jb20vMjAxMy8wMi8xOC9idXNpbmVzcy1vZi1mYXNoaW9uLWdldHMtMi0xbS1zZWVkLWZ1bmRpbmctZnJvbS1pbmRleC1sdm1oLWFuZC1tb3JlLWZvci1pdHMtbm8tbm9uc2Vuc2UtYjJiLWZhc2hpb24tYmxvZy9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"We’ve seen a lot of fashion tech and fashion e-commerce startups pick up steam in the form of users, revenues, and venture backing. But because content remains king, less tech-heavy sites, working in the area of amassing intelligent data, are also growing. Business of Fashion, a London-based B2B blog that chronicles the ins and outs of the fashion industry, is today announcing that it is picking up a seed round of $2.1 million.

The funding led by Index Ventures and with participation from a number of movers and shakers in the fashion, online and media industries, including LVMH; Samos Investments (investor in Betfair and online shopping site Ocado); Net-a-Porter investor Carmen Busquets; Novel TMT Ventures; and Advancit Capital, an early stage media, entertainment and tech fund launched by CBS/Viacom’s vice chairman Shari Redstone.

Prior to this, BoF had been bootstrapped by its founder Imran Amed, who tells TechCrunch that he first founded the site six years ago “on my sofa” after deciding to take a break from consulting at McKinsey. “I decided to become a fashion polyglot,” he says. BoF was a natural extension of that knowledge. Today’s announcement, appropriately, is being made as the site relaunches with a new design, and coincides with London Fashion Week.

The funding will be used to further build out the site — until a few weeks ago BoF only had 1.5 employees in addition to a network of blogging contributors worldwide, says Amed; now it has five.

While so far the site’s straight purpose has been to publish analysis and news about the fashion industry, it will also start to explore new business models, including launching events, analytics services and premium content. But it will not delve into affiliate marketing or e-commerce, which Amed calls “low-hanging fruit” that grew out of Fashion 2.0.

Indeed, that is a space that has been explored by a number of others, some successfully and others not so much, so staying away from that moving target, and focusing instead on delivering strong fashion editorial, is perhaps the best way of remaining distinct. Indeed, as a commenter pointed out below, sticking to content is also a route taken in other B2B verticals like travel (eg, Skift.com from my former boss Rafat Ali) where most others are focused on applying technology to different aspects of travel transactions.

This is also what attracted investors like Index.

“At a time when the fashion industry is grappling with the challenges and the opportunities that the digital revolution is presenting, BoF is providing insight and information in a way that is vital in meeting these challenges” said Robin Klein, partner at Index Ventures, in a statement announcing the news. “BoF is founded on the principle that the highest quality information and content is as essential to the business of fashion as to the business of anything. Imran is a fantastic entrepreneur and we are looking forward to working with him as he continues to build this important next generation media company.” Index has invested in a number of other fashion startups including leading a $40 million round in LA’s Nasty Gal.

Of course, there are a number of other fashion blogs out there, both strong offerings from small, lone-gun outfits; and those from major fashion powerhouses like Vogue. BoF has had a number of people approach it for acquisition, Amed admits, but it has so far chosen to keep itself independent.

“Business of Fashion is at such an early stage of its development that selling at such an early stage would be detrimental,” he says. “Part of our success has been to be nimble, but part of being in a large structure is that you’re limited in what you’re able to do. On your own means less resources, but it’s my preference at this stage. My mission is to create something that will be around for a long time.”

That independents goes in another direction, too. Like the strongest blogs covering other industries, BoF’s strength has come from maintaining editorial independence from the companies that it covers. Amed says that will be even more the case with companies like LVMH as backers.

“We’ve been clear on editorial independence being critical to our success. It’s why we’ve been so successful so we maintain it, but having the expertise of LVMH is important because we’ve been looking for investors who know the area that we cover,” he says. Having said that, he adds that LVMH doesn’t have any input into what BoF covers. “We have it enshrined in our company documents and every investor had to sign that,” he says. “The general response is, “of course that makes sense. If we jeapordize that, we jeapordize our investment.'”

Currently BoF’s readership — which is not a scale play at this point, numbering at only in the hundreds of thousands — is about 60% fashion industry people, 30% “affluent prosumers” obsessed with fashion but not directly working in the area, and 10% students — the site features prominently on fashion school reading lists. Amed says he’s looking to build out in all of those areas.

Chuck Hagel’s Fashion Grade: Chuck Hagel may be getting a lot of flack throughout his Secretary of Defense nomination process, but that hasn’t hindered fashion critics from taking a hit at the senator either. WWD gave Hagel’s signature look a B- grade in today’s paper, pointing out his puffy under eyes, his “padded, slopped” suit shoulders, and the “micro polka dots” on his tie. [WWD]

Lindsay Lohan Trashes Dress: Lindsay Lohan has reportedly trashed the $1,750 dress that Charlie Sheen helped her borrow. The actress apparently freaked out when the Theia gown ripped at a fundraiser and asked a bouncer for a pair of scissors so she could shear the hem into a mullet-type silhouette. [HuffPo Style]

Dior CEO Sidney Toledano was reportedly a driving force in the investment, and has been known to favor young French designers in recent years. “this partnership endorsement will allow the house to develop my creative vision internationally,” Simoens said in a statement.

In terms of price, Tag Heuer mobile phones will be positioned at the top end of the market and cost about Rs 2,21,000.

Switzerland-based Louis Vuitton Moet Hennessy (LVMH) group, which owns the brand, has decided to launch the phones in India at the same time as their global launch.

""It will be a very high-end luxury mobile phone and will be available at a starting price of euro 3500 (around Rs 2,21,717),"" Marcus Stadelmann, LVMH Watch & Jewellery president for South East Asia, told Business Standard.

With the launch of Tag Heuer phones, LVMH, which also owns upmarket brands Fendi and Christian Dior, will come head to head against Nokia, whose Vertu lords it over the high-end luxury mobile handset market.

However, Tag Heuer phones will be priced lower than Vertu, whose cheapest model comes for euro 5,000 (Rs 3,15,997).

In India, the Tag Heuer mobile handsets will be available at Tag Heuer boutiques and select multi-brand retail outlets across Mumbai, New Delhi, Bangalore, Chennai, Ahemdabad and Kolkata.

""Such brand extensions are an obvious step in leveraging the equity of a brand... Going by the response Tag Heuer watches have received, we are evaluating more brand extensions,"" said Manishi Sanwal, general manger, LVMH Watch & Jewellery India.

According to Stadelmann, the phone will have all the basic functions of a high-end phone and will be high on quality and looks. After assessing the response, the company will look at introducing more models.

LVMH plans to increase the number of Tag Heuer boutiques from 12 to 30 by 2010. The company has entered into a franchisee agreement for Tag Heuer stores in UB Group's UB City Mall and DLF's Emporio Mall.

LVMH is also poised to introduce its third watch brand, Zenith, in India for which government clearance has come. Tag Heuer and Christian Dior are already here.

The company has lined up an initial investment of Rs 50 crore to market Zenith in the country. It will be positioned a rung above the premium positioning of Christian Dior."
