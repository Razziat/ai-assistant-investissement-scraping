Why layaway payment programs are surging in beauty - Glossy,"Tue, 30 Jun 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmdsb3NzeS5jby9iZWF1dHkvd2h5LWxheWF3YXktcGF5bWVudC1wcm9ncmFtcy1hcmUtc3VyZ2luZy1pbi1iZWF1dHkv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Following consumer spending drops in March and April, U.S. shoppers rallied in May, increasing their spending by 8.2%. But without one-time stimulus checks and with PPP funding drying up, not to mention new cases of Covid-19 surging in Southern states, the economic outlook is tenuous at best.

While there have been some winners in the beauty category — namely utility products like hand sanitizer, soap and self-care products — sales of prestige beauty products in the U.S. saw a 14% decline in sales year-over-year in the first quarter, according to NPD Group. In tandem with a loss of sales, beauty companies, many of which are in the luxury segment, are increasingly getting into bed with buy-now-pay-later services. Sephora, which has seen its e-commerce sales increase during the pandemic, announced in May a partnership with Klarna, bringing payment flexibility to the 290-plus brands it carries. And in the last two weeks, two more Estée Lauder brands, Aveda and its most prestige offering La Mer, teamed up with Afterpay to bring its total count to 10.

In the last two years, indie and digital-savvy brands were first to adopt buy-now-pay-later services. ELC, for its part, only began its relationship with Afterpay last summer with MAC, but Jessica Rotnicki, svp and general manager of e-commerce at the Estée Lauder Companies, said she expects to launch Afterpay on more of the company’s 25-plus brand websites between July and September.

“We want to strike the right balance with our customers, and certain customers today want more control than ever. They want to buy on their own terms and not amass any debt,” she said. Rotnicki reported that, among ELC brands offering Afterpay, 8-9% of e-commerce orders have used the payment provider, and 10% of their online sales can now be attributed to Afterpay. In quarterly earnings in May, ELC reported that sales in the Americas struggled because of store shutdowns, declining to $892 million in net sales, despite growth online.

According to e-commerce payment provider PPRO, 42% of U.S. shoppers don’t complete a purchase if their favorite payment method isn’t available, and 18% of U.S. consumers confidently use alternative payment methods like Klarna or Afterpay, citing friends and family referrals.

Nick Molnar, Afterpay co-founder, told Glossy that the company had seen an increase in new merchant partners as a result of the pandemic. In April, the company had 9,100 partners, and it now has well over 15,000. Afterpay has now been used by 5 million U.S. customers, plus it saw 354% sales growth year-over-year in its fiscal year third quarter. In May, competitor Klarna clocked in 3,700 retail partners in the U.S., but it boasts 12 million U.S. consumers. This month, it launched its own rewards program, Vibe, that allows customers to use Klarna via a Ghost card with non-Klarna partners like Amazon."

"TPG, LVMH-Backed Fund Invest $850 Million in Jio Platforms - Yahoo Finance","Sun, 14 Jun 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy90cGctbHZtaC1iYWNrZWQtZnVuZC1pbnZlc3QtMDIyNjU4NjYwLmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"(Bloomberg) -- A Texas-based private equity firm and a fund backed by luxury retailer LVMH added $850 million to the surge of investment in Jio Platforms Ltd., the telecommunications and digital services business of Reliance Industries Ltd., India’s largest company.

TPG Capital agreed to pay 45.5 billion rupees ($600 million) for a 0.93% stake in Jio Platforms, while L Catterton, the $20 billion consumer-focused private equity firm, took a 0.39% stake for 18.9 billion rupees, Reliance said in separate statements dated June 13.

The deals add to the list of well-known investment firms joining billionaire Mukesh Ambani’s bid to pay down debt at his Reliance flagship, raising the total invested to about $13.7 billion since April. Ambani has also drawn investors with a plan to shift the conglomerate toward growth in e-commerce, online entertainment and digital payments, away from a dependence on revenue from oil refining and petrochemicals.

“I particularly look forward to gaining from L Catterton’s invaluable experience in creating consumer-centric businesses,” Ambani said in the statement dated June 13.

Ambani’s digital unit, whose equity value is now about $65 billion, has sold more than 22% in stakes to buyers including Facebook Inc., KKR & Co., Silver Lake Partners and General Atlantic. Jio is expected to use its roughly 400 million wireless phone subscribers as the cornerstone of an e-commerce and digital services business in the world’s second-biggest country.

The slew of investments have sent Reliance Industries shares soaring more than 80% since late March, and the stock is trading near a record high.

Ambani, Asia’s richest man, has also been plowing more of his own fortune into the company. Reliance Industries concluded its $7 billion rights offering earlier this month.

"LVMH Acquisition of Tiffany Looking Uncertain, Sources Told WWD - WWD","Tue, 02 Jun 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vd3dkLmNvbS9mZWF0dXJlL2x2bWgtdGlmZmFueS1kZWFsLXNlZW4tYXMtdW5jZXJ0YWluLXNvdXJjZXMtMTIwMzY0NTY1MC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Luxury’s biggest deal ever — LVMH’s $16.2-billion offer for Tiffany & Co. — is suddenly looking a lot less certain, WWD has learned.

According to sources, members of the board of LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton called a meeting in Paris Tuesday night specifically to discuss the matter amid a deteriorating situation in the U.S. market, Tiffany’s largest.

It is understood board members of the luxury giant are concerned about the impact of not only the coronavirus pandemic, which has claimed more than 100,000 lives in America and wreaked widespread economic damage, but also the growing social unrest over the death of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis police.

The outpouring of anger over racial injustice in America has prompted widespread demonstrations and also looting and property destruction in many cities, scuttling attempts to get the economy moving again.

In addition, these sources said, LVMH board members voiced concerns about Tiffany’s ability to cover all its debt covenants at the end of the transaction, which was expected to be concluded mid-year.

While no firm decision was made at Tuesday’s meeting, attendees sent a clear message that the acquisition should be reconsidered.

Reached by WWD late Tuesday Paris time, an LVMH spokesman declined to comment.

Tiffany & Co. has been mum on the LVMH takeover – and market conditions in the U.S.

At its annual shareholder meeting Monday, held virtually, the luxury jeweler didn’t mention any specific challenges surrounding the coronavirus, the deal to become part of LVMH, or the peaceful protests and clashes filling the streets of America.

Shares of Tiffany, which closed up 0.2 percent to $128.36 each on Monday, are up more than 42 percent year-over-year, held aloft partly by the prospect of the takeover by LVMH, the largest player in the luxury sector with a proven track record of building brands and business over time with properties such as Dior, Bulgari, Fendi and Louis Vuitton.

LVMH has also said little about the deal, squelching reports in March that it was buying shares on the open market to take advantage of a drop in Tiffany’s share price as the health crisis spooked investors and sent stock markets reeling.

While discussing first-quarter results with analysts and journalists in April, LVMH chief financial officer Jean-Jacques Guiony said only that the deal was still on track. “We will stick to the contract, full stop,” Guiony said at the time.

Last November, LVMH agreed to acquire Tiffany for $135 a share.

“Our goal is to provide Tiffany with the ideal environment to further invest and grow,” LVMH chairman and chief executive officer Bernard Arnault told WWD when the deal was unveiled, noting the delisting would lift the pressure on short-term profitability that comes with being listed in the U.S.

Tiffany shareholders approved the deal in February, with investors holding about 72 percent of the American firm’s shares represented at the meeting. At that time, the deal was still subject to routine regulatory approvals and the details of the merger were described as not fully worked out.

The Tiffany deal, secured before the world was upended by COVID-19, was seen as giving LVMH a tighter grip on the lucrative high-end jewelry segment.

Combining the financial firepower of the world’s largest luxury group with the iconic American house — known globally for its robin’s egg-colored packaging and classic engagement ring settings — was seen as creating a more robust competitor to the leading jewelry label Cartier, which belongs to Compagnie Financière Richemont.

Tiffany’s last indication of its financial performance was for its fourth quarter ended Jan. 31.

The Americas region — which includes the U.S., Canada, Mexico, Brazil and Chile — accounted for 43 percent of Tiffany’s net sales in fiscal 2019, according to the company’s web site. Its next-largest region, Asia-Pacific region, represented 28 percent of revenues last year.

The deal was heralded as something of master stroke by Arnault, who could use the might of LVMH to both seal the deal and supercharge the jeweler’s business, but to also gain a much larger U.S. presence.

But given how much the world has changed since the deal was reached in the fall, it’s little surprise that even the cash-rich Arnault is thinking hard about the acquisition. Other big-time buyers have also gotten cold feet given the state of the economy, including Sycamore Partners, which was on track to buy control of Victoria’s Secret, but then sued to get out of the deal. L Brands, parent to the intimates brand, decided to drop the deal and move forward on its own.

If the LVMH-Tiffany agreement does indeed fall apart, it will mark the unraveling of months of dealmaking.

The negotiations began over a lunch in October, when Antonio Belloni, group managing director of LVMH, broached the idea of a $14.5 billion offer to Tiffany ceo Alessandro Bogliolo.

Tiffany’s chairman Roger Farah picked it up from there and after a long string of meetings with advisers, bankers — a leak to the press — and many long nights and weekend, LVMH was persuaded to raise its price.

Since the deal was signed, Tiffany’s stock has been supported by that $135 a share offer from Arnault. While in normal times the deal would have been seen as nothing less than a sure thing, these are not normal times. And if Tiffany does end up remaining an independent company, it will have to reevaluate — and investors will do the same.

Shares of Tiffany’s stock dropped sharply after WWD reported online Tuesday that the deal was on shaky ground and ended the day down 8.9 percent to $117.03, a discount of 13.3 percent to the deal price.

"Tiffany says same-store sales fell 44%, LVMH deal clearing regulatory hurdles - CNBC","Tue, 09 Jun 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tLzIwMjAvMDYvMDkvdGlmZmFueS10aWYtMXEtMjAyMC1lYXJuaW5ncy5odG1s0gFFaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY25iYy5jb20vYW1wLzIwMjAvMDYvMDkvdGlmZmFueS10aWYtMXEtMjAyMC1lYXJuaW5ncy5odG1s?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"French luxury giant LVMH said on October 28, 2019 it was exploring a takeover of US jewellers Tiffany, most famous for its fine diamonds and luxury wedding and engagement rings.

Tiffany & Co . said its jewelry business is rebounding in China after the coronavirus pandemic and its merger with French luxury retailer LVMH is clearing regulatory hurdles.

The U.S. jewelry maker said Tuesday in an earnings release that its same-store sales were down about 44% in the fiscal first quarter as the pandemic shuttered shopping malls and stores across the globe. Yet CEO Alessandro Bogliolo pointed to China as ""indicative that a robust recovery is underway.""

Here's how Tiffany did during its fiscal first quarter ended April 30:

Loss per share: 53 cents

Revenue: $555.5 million

Tiffany's swung to a net loss of $64.6 million, or 53 cents a share, from earnings of $125 million, or $1.03 a share, a year ago. Revenue fell 45% to $555.5 million.

Analysts surveyed by Refinitiv were expecting Tiffany to earn 3 cents a share on sales of $701 million, but the coronavirus pandemic has made comparisons with estimates difficult to make.

LVMH owns high-end companies from champagne brand, Dom Perignon, to handbag company, Louis Vuitton. The luxury goods group agreed to buy Tiffany in November for $16.2 billion.

The pandemic, however, threw the deal into doubt. As stores temporarily shuttered and many sales evaporated, LVMH CEO Bernard Arnault looked to lower the price of buying the U.S. jewelry chain, according to people familiar with the matter.

Shares of Tiffany have been trading below the companies' agreed-upon price of $135 per share. The stock closed Monday at $122.18. The shares were up more than 2% in trading Tuesday.

The jeweler may face headwinds in the months ahead. As the risk of Covid-19 continues and the public waits for a vaccine, people are throwing fewer parties and skipping events where they'd typically wear a pair of earrings or show off a shiny new bracelet. Many couples have put weddings on hold.

Neil Saunders, managing director of retail consulting firm GlobalData, said that drop in socializing hurts Tiffany. He said the company will also lose business, as fewer tourists travel to major U.S. cities like New York.

He said the resurgence of jewelry sales in China isn't a predictor of how customers will respond in other countries. Even before the pandemic, he said, Chinese customers were getting wealthier and driving double-digit growth of Tiffany sales there.

Bogliolo said in the earnings release that the company — along with other retailers — has been battered by the pandemic, but said its brand is strong. He said the company's focus on expanding sales in China, investing in its websites and expanding its jewelry collection before the pandemic has made it more resilient.

And, he said, antitrust officials in Russia and Mexico recently gave regulatory approval to move forward with the merger. Other key regulatory approvals are still pending.

The company's chief financial officer, Mark Erceg, said Tiffany has ""ample cash on hand"" and is in compliance with debt covenants, as of April 30. It amended some of its debt agreements and pulled back on capital spending as it navigates uncertain times, he said.

Tiffany said its jewelry sales dropped off significantly in the three-month period, while most of its stores were closed. About 70% of its 324 stores were shut as of April 30, when the fiscal first quarter ended.

Engagement jewelry declined by nearly 50%, more than any other category.

In China, same-store sales were down about 85% and 15% during the first and second months of the quarter, but have picked up again in April and May. He said sales jumped by 30% during April and about 90% in May, compared with the same period a year prior.

E-commerce sales grew by 23% across the globe. That was fueled by the U.S. and United Kingdom, where sales were up 14% and 15%, respectively.

Bogliolo said sales of its new collection in rose gold and gold with diamonds have also been a bright spot. It said sales of the new line have kept up with original projections, even as customers couldn't go to stores.

""I am confident that Tiffany's best days remain ahead of us and I am excited we will be taking that journey with LVMH by our side,"" he said."
Rihanna brings LVMH into the Fenty-first century with an influential new partnership - The Hustle,"Tue, 30 Jun 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiMWh0dHBzOi8vdGhlaHVzdGxlLmNvL2x2bWgtZmVudHktcmloYW5uYS1jb3NtZXRpY3PSAT1odHRwczovL3RoZWh1c3RsZS5jby9sdm1oLWZlbnR5LXJpaGFubmEtY29zbWV0aWNzP2hzX2FtcD10cnVl?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Last week, LVMH Möet Hennessy Louis Vuitton added Fenty — Rihanna’s beauty line — to its group of luxury brands. The partnership makes Fenty LVMH’s first new in-house brand to debut since 1987 — and makes Rihanna the first female partner to launch an LVMH brand.

Following in the footsteps of other famous fashionistas like the Kardashian-Jenners, Rihanna’s partnership proves that, in the influencer age, personal brands can become big businesses.

Fenty’s fast and fashionable rise

Rihanna created Fenty with the goal of providing more inclusive cosmetics options, raising $10m from Kendo (LVMH’s cosmetics incubator) to get the business off the ground.

After launching in 2017 with 40 different skin tones, Fenty brought in more than $550m in revenue in its first year.

Fenty’s massive success inspired LVMH to invite outsider Rihanna to launch a new brand under the luxury company’s ultra-exclusive corporate umbrella (ella, ella, eh, eh, eh — sorry).

Rihanna, who will be the first woman of color to run an LVMH line, will own 49.99% of the company.

Buying new followers with old money

The LVMH-Fenty collaboration is a collision of old and new: LVMH has called its brands “maisons” since it fabricated clothes for French aristocrats in their homes (“maisons,” en français); Rihanna has “Thug Life” tattooed on her knuckles.

But, even though LVMH did more than $14B in revenue last quarter, the luxury conglomerate doesn’t have as much influence with young, fashionable consumers as Rihanna — who has 70m Instagram followers.

The evolution of celeb-preneurship

For decades, celebrities — mostly men like Paul Newman or George Clooney — have parlayed newsworthy names into successful side hustles, usually by launching kitschy alternatives to big brands.

But a new generation of celebrities — mostly women like Gwyneth Paltrow, Kylie Jenner, and Kate Hudson — is transforming star power into sales power and building billion-dollar businesses that actually threaten the big brands.

Now, stuffy old companies like LVMH are actively seeking out partnerships with celebrities like Rihanna to capitalize on their influence: When Rihanna recently partnered with Puma for a sneaker collaboration, the company’s footwear sales increased 23%."
Paris-Based LVMH Luxury Conglomerate Appears To No Longer Be Buying New York City-Based Tiffany & Co. - aBlogtoWatch,"Thu, 04 Jun 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFibG9ndG93YXRjaC5jb20vbHZtaC1sdXh1cnktbm8tbG9uZ2VyLWJ1eWluZy10aWZmYW55LWNvL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"In November 2019 aBlogtoWatch broke news that the large luxury conglomerate LVMH has secured a deal to acquire Tiffany & Co. Today on June 4th, 2020, LVMH seems to have canceled the deal. As such, it appears that New York City-based Tiffany & Co. will remain independently owned. Tiffany & Co. had seen falling revenues but the company was still relatively strong with a healthy number of retail doors and a brand with a high level of equity. The LVMH deal would have purchased Tiffany & Co. for $16.2 billion.

In a short statement from the Paris headquarters (and with no mention of LVMH chairman Bernard Arnault), LVMH reports that its board met on June 2nd, 2020 and made the decision to rescind their offer to purchase Tiffany & Co. The reason? LVMH points to “the development of the pandemic and its potential impact on the results and perspectives (they may have meant “prospectives”) of Tiffany & Co.” This is LVMH saying that they believe Tiffany & Co. will not be a good investment given the current world order. That may be true, but investors would also probably point to the fact that LVMH was going to leverage its shares as part of the value of the Tiffany & Co. acquisition, and with share prices and revenues not looking rosy for the next few years, it felt that it could not safely afford to purchase Tiffany & Co as this time.

Advertising Message

In any event, LVMH is apparently planning ahead for a few seasons of lower than hoped-for profits in its sector given luxury market uncertainly around the entire globe. That isn’t actually to suggest there isn’t going to be a resurgence in luxury spending soon, but rather that risk-averse groups who are publicly-traded such as LVMH, can’t make enough sense of global economic data to predict anything they feel is reassuringly positive. Indeed, the near-term future for most markets, namely the luxury market will be highly unpredictable.

Tiffany & Co. currently produces an assortment of wrist watches (I happen to be a big fan of many of them) in addition to its diverse catalog of other products which includes is popular jewelry collections. Tiffany & Co. most recently tried to combat lower awareness among younger buyers by releasing a slew of new product categories (such as home decor – yes, I know they once made lamps) and by releasing internet-first marketing campaigns aimed at female consumers. Tiffany & Co., like many legacy names in luxury, still has a long way to go before being as hip with the kids as the company would like.

With six months of anticipation that they would be purchased, it is challenging to predict how Tiffany & Co. managers responded to the news of the LVMH acquisition deal falling through. If anything, it puts control of the company’s future back in the hands of Americas, and preserves Tiffany & Co. as the last legacy American luxury brand. Before it, in 2013 once-American Harry Winston was purchased by Switzerland’s Swatch Group (who also had a short-lived relationship with Tiffany & Co. to produced wrist watches for them).

Advertising Message

Tiffany & Co. likely had to put a lot of projects on hold while in anticipation of the company acquisition by LVMH. With the uncertainly of a post-pandemic world, and being headquartered in a city currently undergoing serious protests that threaten any near return of high street shopping, Tiffany & Co. is going to have a challenging next few months as it tries to reassert a strategy and finagle the resources to then deploy it.

LVMH may return to acquisition mode when the market returns, but in general I think the luxury market is healthier with more independently-owned (i.e. agile) companies that keep the big groups on their toes. LVMH already owns a number of jewelry and watch brands including (but not limited to) Louis Vuitton, Dior, Chaumet, Hublot, TAG Heuer, Bulgari, and Zenith.

LVMH is generally cash-rich and well-positioned, but I fully expect it (like other luxury groups) to brace for chaotic market conditions and shifting consumer behavior/tastes. Tiffany & Co. for example was highly invested in physical retail locations – something that until recently made it a ripe choice for purchase. In a pandemic world where so much marketing and sales are happening online, Tiffany & Co. is relatively weakly positioned despite high brand awareness with global consumers. LVMH may very well seek less expensive brands to buy who are more closely aligned with digital natives. aBlogtoWatch will continue to monitor the developing relationship between Tiffany & Co. and LVMH, and the next steps of each of the respective companies."
LVMH is Currently in the Middle of a Court Battle Over the Legality of Tax-Related Raid by French Authorities - The Fashion Law,"Thu, 04 Jun 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihAFodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGVmYXNoaW9ubGF3LmNvbS9sdm1oLWlzLWN1cnJlbnRseS1pbi10aGUtbWlkZGxlLW9mLWEtY291cnQtYmF0dGxlLW92ZXItdGhlLWxlZ2FsaXR5LW9mLXJhaWQtYnktZnJlbmNoLXRheC1hdXRob3JpdGllcy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Louis Vuitton’s parent company LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton is at the center of a tax case stemming from regulators’ “suspicions” that the luxury goods conglomerate “was pretending it carried out treasury operations in Belgium to lower its tax bill.” Bloomberg reported on Wednesday that new information in the ongoing case, which saw tax officials raid the Paris-based offices of LVMH in September 2019, “emerged at a court of appeals hearing on Wednesday in the French capital, where the luxury-goods titan was challenging the raids” and the one million-plus emails that French authorities acquired as a result.

At the center of the case is LVMH Finance Belgique, the conglomerate’s 12-year old, Brussels-located subsidiary, which is tasked with providing financial services, such as managing LVMH’s short-term treasury notes program. According to French tax officials, the workings of the Belgian offshoot very well may have been conducted in France, but have been logged in the company’s books as being performed by LVMH Finance Belgique in Brussels in order to benefit from lower tax rates.

In a hearing before the Paris Court of Appeal on Wednesday, counsel for LVMH – which owns more than 70 different luxury brands, from fashion houses and beauty brands to wine and spirits companies, and generated $59.1 billion in revenue in 2019, alone – argued that the raid and seizure of internal correspondences ran afoul of the law. To be exact, Jerome Turot, one of the numerous lawyers who appeared in court this week on behalf of LVMH, argued that the documentation that tax authorities presented to the court in order to get a warrant to raid the LVMH headquarters violated French tax-secrecy and privacy rules, particularly in connection “data concerning the head of [LVMH’s] Belgian unit.”

Delphine Michot, another lawyer representing LVMH, argued that in addition to LVMH – which is the largest luxury goods group in the world – being “one of the largest taxpayers in France,” its Belgian finance arm is hardly a shell company aimed at enabling the luxury giant to rig the tax system. With that in mind, she told the court that the Belgian unit is not just an address for LVMH to reference for tax purposes, and instead, “occupies half a floor in a big tower in Brussels” and employs at least six full-time staffers, Bloomberg reported.

Judge Elisabeth Ienne-Berthelot of the Paris Court of Appeal informed the parties that a ruling on the legality of the raid can be expected in early September.

As Bloomberg notes, this is hardly the first time that LVMH has been taken to task over its dealings in Belgium. The group’s chairman Bernard Arnault sought Belgian citizenship in 2012, right around the time that then-president François Hollande announced a plan to impose a 75 percent income tax rate on the nation’s highest earners. Arnault, who currently holds the title of the second richest person in the world (behind Amazon founder Jeff Bezos), insisted that the move was not aimed at escaping French taxes (including speculation that such citizenship would have allowed his children to avoid paying inheritance taxes in France). He ultimately withdrew the application, but not without facing widespread backlash, including from Hollande.

At the same time, French daily newspaper Libération printed a front-page banner headline dedicated to Arnault’s alleged tax dodge, which read, “Get lost, you rich jerk.”"

Second quarter earnings at the owner of Louis Vuitton and other brands will be hit particularly in Europe and the United States, Chairman Bernard Arnault told a shareholder meeting, conducted online.

""We can only hope at this point for a gradual recovery,"" Arnault told investors, adding that the second half of the year looked better. He flagged some ""quite vigorous"" signs of recovery in June, as virus lockdowns lifted in much of Europe, including in Milan and Paris, two major shopping hubs.

Luxury labels are still suffering from a lack of tourist travel even though consumption is picking up again on a local level as stores reopen, including in China.

Finance chief Jean-Jacques Guiony said the fallout would still be felt in the months to come but that it was not possible to make definite projections.

Asked whether the crisis had changed LVMH's view of its $16 billion purchase of Tiffany — which has yet to close — managing director Antonio Belloni said only that the US jeweller was an ""emblematic brand"" which had its place in the company's portfolio.

Sources told Reuters in early June that Arnault was exploring ways to potentially pressure Tiffany to lower the acquisition price, including by examining its compliance with its debt covenants.

Since then, however, Tiffany has amended some of its debt agreements, removing any immediate threat of hiccups in this regard.

LVMH, which has come under scrutiny from French tax authorities over how and where its activities are reported, said on Tuesday it paid 50 percent of its taxes in France. It declined to give details for other countries.

LVMH Promotes Frédéric Arnault to CEO of TAG Heuer - JCK,"Thu, 04 Jun 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmpja29ubGluZS5jb20vZWRpdG9yaWFsLWFydGljbGUvbHZtaC1wcm9tb3Rlcy1mcmVkZXJpYy1hcm5hdWx0L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"As a part of an ongoing management shuffle within its stable of brands, LVMH announced this morning that it’s appointed Frédéric Arnault the new CEO of watch brand TAG Heuer, effective July 1.

Arnault helmed the design phase of the brand’s latest Connected watch, and the company said in a statement that his new role will be pivotal in “supporting innovation and accelerating the development of TAG Heuer.”

The 25-year-old is the son of Bernard Arnault, chairman and chief executive of LVMH Moët Hennessy and reportedly the richest man in France. The Arnault family controls just less than half of LVMH.

A former student of France’s École Polytechnique, Frédéric began his career at Facebook and went on to work at consulting firm McKinsey. He joined TAG Heuer in 2017 to manage its smartwatch category and was appointed chief strategy and digital officer in October 2018.

Stéphane Bianchi, the current CEO of TAG Heuer, is also getting bumped up—he will move into the role of CEO of LVMH’s Watches and Jewelry division, putting jewelry ateliers Chaumet and Fred, in addition to watch brands TAG Heuer, Hublot and Zenith, under his watch.

Jean-Marc Mansvelt, managing director of Chaumet, and Charles Leung, managing director of Fred, will report to Bianchi in his new role. Jean-Christophe Babin, CEO of Bulgari, will continue to report to Toni Belloni, LVMH group managing director.

“It fills me with pride to see Frédéric succeed me at the helm of TAG Heuer after the key role he has played in its strategic repositioning,” Bianchi said in the same statement. “He has carved out a place for digital at the heart of the company’s aspirations, restored real momentum to the collections, all the while skillfully managing the development and launch of the hugely successful third Connected watch generation. Frédéric is passionate about watchmaking, and I am convinced that he and his management team are best placed to lead this wonderful Maison to the heights of achievement it deserves.”

"With America in Chaos, Will LVMH's Tiffany Acquisition Go Ahead as Planned? - The Business of Fashion","Mon, 08 Jun 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzb2ZmYXNoaW9uLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy9sdXh1cnkvdGhlLWx2bWgtdGlmZmFueS1kZWFsLXdpbGwtaGFwcGVuLWhlcmVzLXdoeS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"NEW YORK, United States — When LVMH announced in November that it was buying American jeweller Tiffany & Co. for $16.2 billion, the deal was positioned in the press as a major win for the world's largest luxury group, allowing it to gain an even stronger foothold in the fine jewellery market, an area of the business once dominated by its rival, Richemont.

It was also decades in the making. LVMH Chairman and Chief Executive Bernard Arnault has been eying Tiffany for years, and came close to purchasing it in 2011, but instead opted for the Italian jeweller Bulgari, which fared better during the 2008 economic downturn. This time, Tiffany's high price — $135 per share — seemed worth it, even as its prospects dwindle in the US, where it relies heavily on falling tourism dollars to fuel its sales. Especially given the brand's global recognition and growing presence in China, the control centre of growth in the sales of personal luxury goods.

But, as the coronavirus pandemic took hold globally, with lockdowns halting commerce in several regions, the industry began to whisper. What would happen to the LVMH-Tiffany partnership, which was set to be formalised by the middle of 2020? In April, Australian financial regulators said they needed more time to review the deal, which had been approved in the US and Europe. Then, in early June, just as the extent of the pandemic's damage to the US economy began to crystalise, civil rights protests swept the US, underscoring that the region's challenges reach far beyond those brought on by the coronavirus.

Along the same timeline, an “an astutely orchestrated ploy” by LVMH to pay less for what it has promised Tiffany has unfolded, illustrating Arnault’s masterful negotiation skills — but hardly dissolving what is still likely to be one of the biggest deals in the history of the luxury market.

Does he want a better price? Yes. Does he want to lose it? I don't think so.""

“Does he want a better price? Yes,” said Elsa Berry, managing director and founder of Vendôme Global Partners. “Does he want to lose it? I don’t think so.”

It all started with a short, detail-scant item in industry trade Women's Wear Daily, which said that at an LVMH board meeting on June 2, members reportedly discussed uncertainty concerning the deal in the context of the global pandemic and particular circumstances in the US. It also raised the question of whether Tiffany would be able to honour its debt covenants, given the significant reduction in cash flow due to pandemic-related store closures.

Tiffany's stock fell 9 percent immediately following the news. Then, on June 4, LVMH released a short statement, declaring that it had no intentions of buying Tiffany shares on the open market, which would allow it to take over the company at a cheaper price than the $135 per share it agreed to in November. (In late March 2020, it released a similar statement, emphasising that the agreement between the two companies prohibited such action.)

In the middle of all of this, Tiffany, which also hosted a board meeting last week, said it would push back its first-quarter earnings report from June 5 to June 9. Sources told Reuters that the company believed its deal with LVMH was ""ironclad,"" and that the American firm would be willing to go to court before walking away.

By the end of the week, Reuters said LVMH was backing off and would not fight the original deal. Yet, over the weekend there was more speculation among current and former employees of both companies that LVMH is indeed looking for a way out, as Tiffany does everything it can to ensure it is not in breach of contract.

Tiffany's Tuesday earnings report, which covers the three months ending May 31, may bring further clarity: sales are down significantly, and the company has not adjusted its product offering in any way to reflect the current state of the world. But unlike disgraced lingerie brand Victoria's Secret, whose deal with private equity firm Sycamore Partners dissolved amid the pandemic, Tiffany is not a business in panic mode, and it should be able to pay its bills. At the end of 2019, Tiffany had $897 million in cash and cash equivalents, and announced in May it would pay a quarterly dividend to shareholders.

The fact remains that there are still many reasons for LVMH to acquire Tiffany, especially if the price can be renegotiated. The deal is mutually beneficial.

For LVMH, Tiffany would help further establish the group’s standing in hard luxury, where it has had success with Bulgari, which it acquired for $5.2 billion in 2011. “LVMH does indeed have strategic reasons to take Tiffany over,” said Bernstein analyst Luca Solca.

While hard luxury has been hit during the lockdowns as a high percentage of sales are still made in physical retail compared to other categories, it's viewed as a long-term investment by consumers. (It's also good for short-term portfolio balancing. In recent years, LVMH has made big investments in hospitality, a category on hold for the near to mid-term future as recreational travel remains taboo.)

“Jewellery is likely to be preferred by consumers concerned by the recession, as it is perceived to be more valuable and longer lasting,” Solca added. “It is also bought by older consumers, who should in theory suffer less of a blow by the economic dislocation.”

Plus, Tiffany is a global name in the highly fragmented, mostly unbranded fine jewellery market. And its business in China, now the centre of luxury consumption, grew by double digits in 2019.

Owning Tiffany would also significantly broaden LVMH's operations in the US. None of its US-based fashion investments — including Donna Karan International and Marc Jacobs — have amounted to great long-term financial success. (Michael Kors, of which it used to own a 33 percent minority stake, became a billion-dollar brand after it left the LVMH fold.) In beauty, it has Sephora's US operations and brand incubator Kendo. But owning an American heritage brand would be different.

""The US is still the US — it’s not disappearing as an important luxury market,"" Berry said. ""People are thinking more local now, and you’ve got to be close to your customers.""

LVMH will also be able to make Tiffany much bigger, using its marketing and branding expertise, as well as its extensive real estate network, to refresh the brand’s image. (For instance, Tiffany's store positioning off the Place Vendôme, the centre of jewellery shopping in Paris, is not ideal. LVMH could change that.) Even at the high price of $16.2 billion, this was true.

It's also unlikely that LVMH would go to court unless it was to save the deal, not dissolve it. ""In the past, LVMH was not shy going to court, but it was to take companies over – Hermès is a case in point, and before that, Gucci,"" Solca said. ""It would be a first that LVMH goes to court not to take a company over – I would consider this scenario unlikely.""

For Tiffany, there’s never been a more advantageous time to join LVMH. As the industry continues to consolidate, the costs associated with maintaining an independent operation becomes more difficult to justify. Recovery, especially in the US, will not be instant, and it’s likely that any sort of deal — even a renegotiated one — will be in the best interest of shareholders.

Short-term, it’s easy to understand why LVMH could be wavering. But Arnault doesn’t play a short-term game. “He’s wanted this brand forever, and he doesn’t like to lose,” Berry said. “He’s extremely smart, he’s rational and this means a lot to him.”

This isn’t over. But the outcome — whether it’s in 10 days, or in a few months — is near-guaranteed to be that Tiffany, a 183-year-old brand, will be a part of LVMH by the end of the year.

LVMH-Backed Private Equity Fund Sees More US Job Growth Coming in June - The Business of Fashion,"Wed, 10 Jun 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzb2ZmYXNoaW9uLmNvbS9uZXdzL2ZpbmFuY2UvbHZtaC1iYWNrZWQtcHJpdmF0ZS1lcXVpdHktZnVuZC1zZWVzLW1vcmUtdXMtam9iLWdyb3d0aC1jb21pbmctaW4tanVuZS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"NEW YORK, United States — L Catterton, a private equity firm backed by LVMH that has invested in companies like Peloton and Restoration Hardware, says the jaw-dropping employment growth in the US last month was no fluke, and it expects more gains in June.

Michael Chu, the co-chief executive officer of the $20 billion fund, said based on what he’s seeing on the ground, job growth this month will probably outpace the rise in May when a record 2.5 million workers were added to payrolls.

“When you open up hotels and you open up restaurants, theme parks, etc. then guess what? — you’re bringing back people who were furloughed and let go back onto the market,” he said in an interview. “You’re going to see bigger job growth in June.”

Stocks around the world rallied after the surprise US jobs report last week, though Chu, whose company specializes in consumer brands, said internal data had clearly shown that many employers were re-hiring.

Investments at the Greenwich, Connecticut-based L Catterton run the gamut from condiment-maker Cholula Hot Sauce and auto sales platform Vroom Inc. to pet cuisine brand Just Food For Dogs, and Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd. The fund is minority owned by LVMH, the Paris-based luxury goods company, and billionaire Bernard Arnault's investment firm.

Even with Chu’s short-term optimism, he agrees that unemployment will likely stay above pre-recession levels for a while, citing expert forecasts of about 10 percent, down from last month’s rate of 13.3 percent.

Non-grocery retail is expected to drop 20 percent this year, according to Forrester Research, with J.C. Penney Co., Neiman Marcus Group Inc. and Pier 1 Imports Inc. among those filing for bankruptcy. The global personal luxury goods market could contract as much as 35 percent in 2020, Bain & Co. estimated.

“The lower-income consumers are absolutely stressed,” with many people just scraping by, he said. “We don’t think we’re going back to 3.5 percent unemployment tomorrow.”

The recession will also change how L Catterton invests, Chu added. Much also depends on whether America is hit by a second wave of Covid-19 infections. The threat of outbreak means tightly packed malls are likely to be less popular, with open-air and street-front retailers that offer more space on the rise, he said.

“The US is over-retailed by some percentage and all that Covid has done is accelerate the laws of Darwin so there’s been more acceleration of poor retail dying,” he said. “In those physical spaces that those stores vacate will be new retail and new concepts, and that doesn’t have to be product — it can be service-oriented, health and wellness or medical.”

Louis Vuitton owner backs down on renegotiating Tiffany deal - New York Post,"Fri, 05 Jun 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vbnlwb3N0LmNvbS8yMDIwLzA2LzA1L2dsYW1vcm91cy1sb3Vpcy12dWl0dG9uLW93bmVyLWJhY2tzLWRvd24tb24tcmVuZWdvdGlhdGluZy1kZWFsLXRvLWJ1eS10aWZmYW55L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"French luxury goods giant LVMH, owner of Louis Vuitton, is not asking to renegotiate its $16.2 billion acquisition of US jewelry chain Tiffany & Co. after deliberating whether to do so, people familiar with the matter said Friday.

LVMH chief executive Bernard Arnault had been in talks with his advisers this week to identify ways to pressure Tiffany to lower the agreed-upon price of $135 per share in cash, Reuters reported Wednesday.

He considered whether he could argue that the New York-based company is in breach of its obligations under the merger agreement, sources said at the time. LVMH also said Thursday that its board had discussed the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on its deal with Tiffany.

LVMH has decided it will not raise the issue of repricing the deal with Tiffany for now, after it considered the legal hurdles involved, the sources said.

The deal has yet to receive some of the necessary regulatory approvals, and it’s unclear whether LVMH will revisit the issue before the deal closes, especially if Tiffany’s financial condition were to deteriorate.

While Tiffany is in compliance with covenants it had agreed to with its creditors, LVMH will be closely monitoring Tiffany’s finances in the coming weeks to see if this remains the case, the sources added.

Were Tiffany to be in breach of the covenants, LVMH could use this as grounds under the merger agreement to call for a renegotiation of the terms, the sources said. For its part, Tiffany has been in discussions with its creditors to make sure it remains in compliance with its debt covenants, the sources added.

The sources asked not to be identified because the deliberations are confidential.

LVMH and Tiffany did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Tiffany shares soared on the news and were trading up nearly 7 percent at $122.37 at noon. This represents a discount to the $135-per-share deal price. LVMH shares were trading up 3.5 percent, at $402.70, in Paris.

Tiffany will give LVMH a bigger share of the lucrative US market and expand its offerings in jewelry, the fastest-growing sector in luxury goods.

Consultancy Bain expects global sales of high-end clothing, handbags, jewelry and cosmetics to fall by up to 35 percent this year, as the coronavirus outbreak forced brands to shut shops across the globe and international travel has ground to a halt.

Several acquirers have abandoned or renegotiated deals in the wake of the pandemic. In the retail sector, buyout firm Sycamore Partners walked away last month from a $525 million deal to acquire a majority stake in L Brands’ Victoria’s Secret."

Kendo, the beauty incubator inside LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton that powers many of the brands sold at Sephora, laid off about 10 percent of its staff on Monday, sources told WWD.

The layoffs — sources estimated roughly 50 of them — were across different levels of the business, sources said. Cuts were made due to the financial impact of the coronavirus, which has wreaked economic havoc globally.

A spokeswoman for Kendo did not confirm the number, but did confirm the business went through layoffs on Monday.

“In light of the COVID-19 health crisis and the resulting impact on business, Kendo made the difficult decision to reduce the size of certain teams. We worked hard to keep the reductions as limited as possible,” said a spokeswoman for Kendo.

Kendo is behind Fenty Beauty, Marc Jacobs Beauty, KVD Beauty, Bite Beauty and Ole Henriksen.

The beauty business broadly has faced declines in 2020 due to store closures during COVID-19 and the reallocation of consumer dollars to essential items, like groceries and toilet paper.

The younger Arnault recently headed up the launch of the updated TAG Heuer Connected smartwatch (aBlogtoWatch hands-on here). His position at CEO technically replaces that of former TAG Heuer CEO Stéphane Bianchi, who will remain at LVMH in a different role.

In 2018, when Jean-Claude Biver left LVMH, Stéphane Bianchi (then-newcomer to LVMH) entered to replace Mr. Biver’s role both as the CEO of TAG Heuer and as the head of the LVMH Watches Division (a collection of some, but not all, of the conglomerate’s watch brands that include TAG Heuer, Zenith, and Hublot).

Mr. Bianchi will remain in his larger advisory role as the CEO of the LVMH Watches and Jewelry Division. In a sense, Frédéric Arnault will continue to report to Mr. Bianchi, as will the heads of both Zenith and Hublot. Other LVMH brands that produce watches, such as Bulgari, will report not to Mr. Bianchi, but rather to LVMH’s Group Managing Director (who is currently Toni Belloni).

In March 2020, I sat down with Frédéric Arnault to discuss the then launch of the new TAG Heuer connected and to get a sense of his plans for the company. Frédéric is among several of father Bernard’s children who run LVMH brands. While it is true that he reports to his father, Arnault senior has seemingly strategically aligned his children to compete with one another in running their various companies. All signs point to the fact that Frédéric Arnault is fully motivated not only for success but also to continue transforming TAG Heuer into a Swiss watchmaker with a broad appeal among younger luxury seekers, while also respecting the brand’s legacy, which began in 1860."

Bernard Arnault, the CEO of the world’s largest conglomerate might have lost as much money as Bezos has gained but he’s continuing his aggressive expansion plans adding potential renegotiation of the Tiffany deal on the table

Jun 04, 2020 | By Jonathan Ho

CEO Bernard Arnault is the world’s foremost trendsetter, overseeing a luxury empire of 70 brands including Louis Vuitton and Bvlgari. In November 2019, LVMH made the biggest luxury brand acquisition deal since their purchase of the Italian jewellery brand. buying American jeweller Tiffany & Co for $16.2 billion. But 2020 is not off to a good start, by March, major economies were closing due to a coronavirus pandemic and Arnault has lost more money than his billionaire peers as a result. That said, the CEO of the luxury goods giant isn’t content to cower and hide, Arnault is making aggressive moves to recover lost ground.

Once the world’s 2nd-richest person, CPP-luxury reported that the coronavirus pandemic has cost Bernard Arnault more than $30 billion, in essence, losing as much money as Amazon Chairman Jeff Bezos has gained. Shares of in LVMH are down more than 17% year to date prompting the billionaire to explore ways to reopen negotiations on his $16.2 billion acquisition of US jewellery chain Tiffany & Co.

LVMH CEO Bernard Arnault is considering renegotiating Tiffany acquisition deal

Insiders speaking to Reuters on condition of confidentiality said that Arnault had conferred with advisers seeking to identify avenues for pressurising Tiffany to lower the agreed acquisition deal at $135 per share.

Acquisition of Tiffany is still a key strategy for LVMH, giving the conglomerate an instant slice of the immense US market while expanding its hard luxury portfolio in jewellery, not only the fastest growing segment of the luxury goods industry but also, as recent high profile auctions have proven: it’s most resilient, after Cartier’s Tutti Frutti bracelet beat expectations even in the current economic climate. That said, it is market conditions which now leads Arnault to believe that he might be overpaying for Tiffany.

According to Bloomberg, LVMH reported its steepest-ever declines with first-half operating profit to fall by half, prompting Arnault to cut capital expenditure by 30%-35% for 2020 while delaying infrastructure projects like renovations and expansion. In its US market, LVMH’s Sephora chain laid off 30% of store staff (over 3,000 people) in early April.

Given current economic conditions, Arnault is seeking a more equitable outcome (in his perspective). That said, there hasn’t been a decided strategy on how to pursue a price cut nor has Arnault reopened negotiations with Tiffany as there has been no legal basis to go down such a path. However, analysts say, forcing Tiffany to the bargaining table in court will result in such acrimony that future acquisitions discussions would be difficult at best.

LVMH expands ahead in adversity, capturing mind share

With global luxury sales expected to fall over 30% as the global pandemic shut international trade and global tourism, New York-based Tiffany and other retailers have had to endure another unexpected development – rioting in the streets following the death of George Floyd as a result of police brutality.

With hospitality decimated, no parties and events, LVMH, maker of 20% of the world’s Champagne hasn’t been selling much of it; Nor has masking up and work-from-home defaults made it necessary to shop at a fashion boutique (online or otherwise) nor apply cosmetics or perfume since commuting is minimal.

According to NPR, retail spending in the United States collapsed in April 2020, dropping a historic 16.4% as people avoided restaurants, bars, stores and malls, double that of the record drop of 8.3% in March with spending in clothing and accessories down an immense 78.8%.

But Arnault is no ordinary CEO, he made an extraordinary career out of astute risk taking. In the early 2000s, he outmanoeuvred Prada Group SpA by acquiring Fendi. Historically, he has invested where others have remained cautious, launching the first luxury e-Commerce emporium where others were hesitant or adversely traditional. Even with uncertainty for international tourism, with IATA expecting a return to usual levels only in 2023, LVMH is still on track to reopen its $1 billion dollar refurbishment of Samaritaine department store in Paris as a duty-free shopping hub and luxury hotel by February 2021. LVMH is also opening luxury hotel Cheval Blanc on Los Angeles’s famed Rodeo Drive stretch. Louis Vuitton is still hiring and expanding, recruiting [] to head up luxury women’s leather accessories, Givenchy is also moving forward with plans to recruit a new designer for a September fashion show even as it remains unseen how such a show will take place with social distancing measures.

Arnault in a nutshell: Big Investments, Big Returns

Pauline Brown, the former chairman of LVMH Americas told Bloomberg that, “You could divide the world’s top billionaires into highly successful risk managers and highly successful risk takers; Arnault is a highly successful risk taker. When he feels momentum and long-term potential, he uses the resources he has to go after it aggressively.”

Indeed, the investors have spoken: Throughout the pandemic, LVMH shares have held steady compared to luxury rivals – Kering Group, owner of Gucci and hard luxury competitor, Richemont, owner of the world’s most prestigious watchmakers, both conglomerates have fallen 25% and 30%, respectively. Arnault’s brands enjoy comfortable margins, and with $9.72 billion in cash reserves, Arnault can ride out the crisis while expanding.

During an April investor call, LVMH Chief Financial Officer Jean-Jacques Guiony said, “We’ve seen very high growth rates in Mainland China. It really shows the appetite of Chinese people after two months of lockdown to come back to their previous pattern of consumption.”

Indeed, Arnault, like other luxury group CEOs are counting on China to be the source of recovery when economies re-open: China has generated more than one-third of luxury sales and two-thirds of the sector’s growth in the last 10 years; and even if the Middle Kingdom’s recovery is not as rosy, Arnault can just “revenge shop”, picking up distressed assets like prime real estate, specialty ateliers and top talents for pennies on the dollar, adding more strategic flexibility to LVMH’s already immense arsenal."
LVMH Names Frédéric Arnault Tag Heuer CEO - WWD,"Thu, 04 Jun 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3dkLmNvbS9mZWF0dXJlL2x2bWgtbmFtZXMtZnJlZGVyaWMtYXJuYXVsdC10YWctaGV1ZXItY2VvLXN0ZXBoYW5lLWJpYW5jaGktZ2FpbnMtamV3ZWxyeS1icmFuZHMtMTIwMzY0NjgwMS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS — A management reshuffle at the top ranks of LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton’s watches and jewelry division has thrust Frédéric Arnault, the youngest executive in the Arnault clan, to the helm of Tag Heuer — and into the spotlight.

It is a role that the 25-year-old math and computer science whiz has been preparing for by bolstering the digital firepower of the historic watchmaker and developing its third generation of connected watches.

The young Arnault, who joined Tag Heuer three years ago, said he was drawn to the label for the entrepreneurial challenge, with several fronts to tackle.

“It is multifaceted — working to bring this historic, 160-year-old label up-to-date, modernizing it, and nudging it beyond its traditional expertise to be a global brand known for its values,” said Arnault, speaking to WWD via Zoom from Switzerland, where he had just returned from his lockdown quarters in Paris for the first time.

The executive has long been accustomed to holding Zoom meetings — he shuttles between Tag Heuer headquarters at Chaux-de-Fonds, Switzerland, and Paris in normal times — but the coronavirus has increased the amount of remote working for the brand’s teams.

“This is the challenge that really drew me, and once I get involved in something, I like to commit myself in the long term,” continued the executive, whose duties as ceo will soon include brand development.

“I have a particular affection for this brand — my first watches were from Tag Heuer,” he added.

Known for its iconic Carrera and Monaco watch models, the watchmaker markets itself as a label that focuses on the avant-garde, innovation and performance.

Arnault — who graduated from the prestigious French École Polytechnique, as did his father, LVMH chairman and chief executive officer Bernard Arnault — started at Tag Heuer as the head of connected technologies before becoming chief strategy and digital officer two years ago.

The young executive oversaw the launch of a new web site for the brand, as well as the development of a new generation of sports-oriented connected watches — including a golf watch released Thursday. It is the second golf watch developed under Arnault’s direction; the first was introduced by him at Baselworld last year.

LVMH unveiled Arnault’s appointment Thursday, as well as the promotion of Stéphane Bianchi, Arnault’s superior who has been serving as ceo of Tag Heuer while also overseeing watch brands Zenith and Hublot — each of which has its own ceo’s. Jewelry labels Chaumet and Fred will be added to Bianchi’s responsibilities.

Bianchi has “given the watchmaking division a new lease on life, strengthening the fundamental principles of each of the brands and exploring promising new avenues,” said Bernard Arnault, adding he expects the executive to apply similar efforts to Chaumet and Fred.

Chaumet ceo Jean-Marc Mansvelt and Fred ceo Charles Leung will report to Bianchi.

Bulgari ceo Jean-Christophe Babin will continue to report to LVMH managing director Antonio Belloni, as does Bianchi.

The appointment of his son, Frédéric Arnault, affirms the young executive’s achievements at Tag Heuer, where he “succeeded in combining innovation, heritage and savoir-faire within this historic brand,” Bernard Arnault continued.

“These two appointments demonstrate our full confidence in the growth potential of these brands. I wish them every success going forward,” said Bernard Arnault.

The promotions of Bianchi and Arnault, which are effective at the start of July, come as the luxury sector grapples with disruption from the coronavirus pandemic, which has prompted the closure of high-end boutiques around the world and brought another key revenue source to a standstill: traveling tourists. The challenging environment has even cast uncertainty on LMVH’s plans to purchase Tiffany, a deal that would be the largest M&A transaction for the group and further consolidate its position as the global leader in luxury.

The Swiss watches business, entered the crisis already weakened by competition from the rise of the Apple watch. According to Strategy Analytics, the tech giant sold 31 million Apple Watches in 2019, outpacing the 21.1 million units sold by Swiss watch brands, figures that highlight the industry’s challenge to gain relevance with new generations of consumers.

McKinsey released a study this week estimating the watches and jewelry segment will be hardest hit segment of the industry for high-end goods, with business likely down between 25 and 45 percent this year, compared with declines in the range of 15 to 35 percent for leather goods and accessories.

While it is too early to get a good measure of the impact of the current crisis on the brand, Frédéric Arnault holds an optimistic view on the outlook for the watchmaker.

“We are following the reopening of all markets, the latest being the U.S. and the U.K. — both are very important for Tag Heuer, but when the global luxury market starts back up again, so will the watches — there is no reason they would be significantly more affected than the rest of luxury,” he said.

For one, the label is not heavily dependent on traveling tourists — a key revenue source for the luxury industry in pre-COVID-19 times, Arnault pointed out.

“Tag Heuer is not so dependent on tourists — the client segment that will take the longest to return — travel retail, and Chinese tourists represented a small part of the business, so we won’t have a loss here in the mid term,” predicted the executive.

Digital sales emerged as a bright patch in business at Tag Heuer during the lockdown periods — another reason for optimism, he noted.

“Sales in e-commerce were up four to five times last year’s levels — as soon as a country reopens, it brings traffic and business picks up well,” said Arnault.

The brand rolled out a new Internet platform in the U.S. in March as it launched the new generation of connected watches — a project spearheaded by the executive, who recruited people with expertise in software engineering for the project and, in start-up fashion, expanded his team of two initially to around 30 people in a short time at the label.

The New York launch event for the watches took place just hours before the city went into lockdown, with a slightly smaller crowd than originally planned, and without the accompanying dinner. The first major, brand event in a while, marked a “promising start,” for the new products, and generated good feedback in the press, said Arnault.

Then countries began shutting their borders, one by one, stores across Europe and the U.S. closed up and people hunkered down in their homes. The New York event was the executive’s last trip abroad before activities ground to a halt.

“It caught everybody by surprise, I didn’t think it would happen so quickly, the lockdown spreading all over,” recalled Arnault.

A week later, the brand had stopped production in Switzerland — the cessation of activity there lasted a month and a half.

“The priority was to ensure the safety of everyone at Tag Heuer,” he said, noting that many projects pursued during the lockdown period were aimed at implementing safe working conditions for staff.

The brand aims to finish up reopening its stores over the summer, and production has resumed but executives are working toward a gradual buildup of activity back to full levels. Some projects planned for the year have been pushed back to 2021, and the brand continues to make adjustments from week to week, given the ongoing lack of visibility, said Arnault.

Among strategic projects the company hopes to maintain this year is the launch of a major Carrera collection as well as a new store concept — starting with a new store in Zurich, he said, declining to provide details about the new format.

Some other store openings planned this year may be postponed until the end of this year or the beginning of next.

“We maintained certain priority projects in the digital realm,” he noted, citing the surge in sales online during the lockdown periods as motivation for sticking with the planned rollout e-commerce platforms in Europe.

In China, where the label has had a smaller presence than in English-speaking countries like the U.S., the U.K. and Australia, which remain its main markets, there are also some key, strategic plans in the works.

“We’ve seen that the connected watch has done well, and we are preparing the future launch of a mechanical watch, with a special focus on China,” said Arnault. Priced at less than $2,000, lower than the average price tag for Tag Heuer watches, which is closer to $3,000, connected watches serve as an entry point to the label for new generations of consumers that could purchase a mechanical watch at a later stage.

Tag Heuer was the first Swiss luxury watch label to enter the connected timepiece business, launching its debut model in 2015, the same year as the first Apple Watch, a move orchestrated by industry veteran Jean-Claude Biver, who headed the group’s watch division until 2018.

As for events and sponsorships, many have been delayed, Arnault added, noting events organized around the Monaco Grand Prix were scuppered by the cancellation of the famous car race.

“We will wait for several months of optimism before resuming a more ambitious program,” noted the executive.

In the meantime, activity has sped up in other areas, he observed.

“What we’ve noticed during this crisis is that there were underlying trends that have been accelerated,” he said, citing a pickup in online commerce as an example.

“Speaking of e-commerce, it was a trend that was already there — in the luxury market and the watch market — also for high-end watches. Today there are people who buy watches for 20,000 or 30,000 euros with a click on their smartphones,” he said.

Asked if the health crisis may have deepened an interest in connected watches, he pointed to their role in measuring sports performance.

“In the beginning, three years ago we wondered if connected watches were just a passing trend, a gadget, and that people would get tired of them. But we are seeing this is really not the case and there is less and less of a debate — we are convinced that they have a real place in the life of our clients who use them — one of the axes is health,” he said.

“We work on the measuring sports performance — running, cycling, golf, and we see a strong demand on these products, and this is accelerating — this is certain — but the trend was already there,” he said.

When it comes to management style, Arnault noted an emphasis on agility and coordination, breaking away from the traditional silo structures with cross-functional teams.

Asked about his younger brother, who is studying business at MIT and shares an interest in watches, Arnault smiled and said Jean Arnault had just sent him a report on his internship at Tag Heuer’s research and development facility."
The pandemic is tightening fashion conglomerates' grip on the industry - Glossy,"Wed, 10 Jun 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmdsb3NzeS5jby9mYXNoaW9uL3RoZS1wYW5kZW1pYy1pcy10aWdodGVuaW5nLWZhc2hpb24tY29uZ2xvbWVyYXRlcy1ncmlwLW9uLXRoZS1pbmR1c3RyeS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The past few years have seen the number of independent luxury brands dwindle as the big groups — LVMH, Kering, Richemont and, to a lesser extent, Capri Holdings — have consolidated their hold over the luxury world. The ongoing pandemic has only increased conglomerates leverage over the industry, putting them in a perfect position to snap up even more struggling independent brands.

In the last five years, independent luxury brands like Versace, Michael Kors, Jimmy Choo, Rimowa, Dior, Fenty, Buccelatti and Ulysse Nardin were all acquired by luxury conglomerates. The vast cash reserves that luxury groups have amassed has made them highly resilient to the pandemic crisis.

“Luxury brand conglomerates benefit from economies of scale, centralization of capabilities, access to capital as well as access to an exclusive network of suppliers,” said Katrin Zimmermann, managing director for the Americas at TLGG Consulting. “As countries around the world recover from Covid-19 at varying speeds, the access to different markets around the globe will further benefit large conglomerates.”

Meanwhile, independent brands like Mulberry and Tiffany & Co have had a rough few months. Mulberry said on Monday that it would be laying off 25% of its staff, nearly 500 people. In the first quarter of 2020, independent brand Salvatore Ferragamo lost $46 million, while it made a profit of $21 million in the same quarter last year. Tiffany saw its same-store sales fall by nearly 50% in the first quarter of 2020.

The conglomerates have fared much better. While Kering has had some loss of revenue, it’s showed much more resilience to the effects of coronavirus. Bottega Veneta, which has become one of Kering’s fastest growing brands, has seen sales increase by nearly 9% since the pandemic began. The group has not instituted any layoffs and has struck up new partnerships, like a June 4 deal to produce eyewear for Chloé, itself a part of another luxury group, Richemont.

LVMH still has a nearly a $200 billion market value and, according to some analysts, it’s poised to survive the pandemic mostly unscathed. These giant conglomerates are behind a vast majority of the revenue in the fashion world. A 2018 study from McKinsey found that, in 2017, 20 fashion companies, including conglomerates LVMH, Kering, Richemont and Inditex, took in 97% of the entire industry’s profits. Their hold on the industry has only gotten stronger since then. LVMH and Kering declined to comment on their acquisition strategy for this story.

“In a crisis, your cash reserves and ability to raise cash is critical,” said Ben Parr, co-founder and president of marketing platform Octane AI. “Even medium-size businesses don’t tend to have a ton of extra cash laying around. They go season by season, and even one quarter of severe disruption can be devastating. But a huge company like LVMH can weather multiple quarters of reduced revenue due to just how much cash they have.”

This leaves the conglomerates in a perfect place to continue their acquisition spree, which can be seen in the ongoing saga of the LVMH-Tiffany deal. The deal was announced in November of 2019 for $16.2 billion, but the pandemic threw a wrench in the initial plans. Tiffany’s vast losses and LVMH’s relative stability prompted LVMH CEO Bernard Arnault to ask for a lower price, which Tiffany has resisted, according to a report from CNBC. This has lead to a standoff.

“Independent brands like Tiffany need the cash that LVMH has right now,” Parr said. “LVMH still wants Tiffany — it’s a good asset and it makes sense — but LVMH has even more leverage now to get a lower price.”

But conglomerates buying up independent brands leaves very little on the table for non-conglomerate brands to gain any significant traction. The McKinsey study also found that the top 20% fashion companies (based on revenue) took 128% of 2017’s total fashion profits.

In other words, the massive concentration of fashion revenue among a small minority at the top is actively suffocating smaller brands at the bottom.

“My theory is that all these bigger companies buying up smaller companies has really made all the focus on numbers,” said fashion designer Anna Sui. “It doesn’t allow for creativity. And I hope there will be more of a turn toward smaller, artisan, hand-crafted brands, like the way the arts and crafts movement was a reaction to the industrial revolution.”

“I strongly believe that if a luxury brand can resist being acquired, they should,” Parr said. “They’ll end up in a better position after this is back to ‘normal.’ Advertising will be cheaper — the cost of customer acquisition during the pandemic has dropped a lot. There are benefits to being part of a conglomerate, but if you have a strong cash flow and you’ve got e-commerce going, you’d be in a good spot.”"

LVMH’s purchase of Tiffany & Co is said to be in doubt, with LVMH board members thought to have recently held a meeting regarding the matter, according to a report by WWD.com.

THE DETAILS The proposed $16.2 billion offer is set to be one of luxury’s biggest deals, however, sources have claimed the sale could be in jeopardy due to the ongoing deterioration of the U.S. market, which is Tiffany’s largest.

According to WWD.com, no final conclusion was reached at the meeting, however, board members were thought to be clear that the purchase should be reviewed.

THE WHY? LVMH is said to be concerned over the future of the buy-out due to multiple factors, including the blow from COVID-19, ongoing social unrest following the death of George Floyd, as well as worries over the jewellery brand’s ability to cover all of its debt covenants by sale close, previously expected to happen in the middle of 2020."
"Matthew Williams' Appointment to Givenchy is a Clear Depiction of LVMH's $60 Billion-Generating ""Luxury"" Model - The Fashion Law","Tue, 16 Jun 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWZhc2hpb25sYXcuY29tL21hdHRoZXctd2lsbGlhbXMtYXBwb2ludG1lbnQtdG8tZ2l2ZW5jaHktaXMtYS1jbGVhci1kZW1vbnN0cmF0aW9uLW9mLWx2bWhzLWx1eHVyeS1tb2RlbC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Atop the Givenchy creative totem pole is a new name. In the place of Clare Waight Keller – the creative director who won industry praise for her thoroughly well-designed garments and who famously dressed Meghan Markle for her wedding day – comes a new designer: Matthew Williams. Unlike some of the chief creatives that have come before him, Williams does “not come from the school of couture,” as the New York Times’ Vanessa Friedman put it on Monday. Instead, the 34-year old founder of upscale streetwear brand 1017 Alyx 9SM “comes from the school of Kanye,” having been one of the rapper’s former creative collaborators.

It says a lot that a 68-year old couture house ousted its former designer, a celebrated creative who reintroduced the house’s handmade offerings (but failed to gain mass traction), for a budding young talent, who is perhaps best known for popularizing a chest rig (aka – a streamlined-and-styled take on a traditional military bag that straps to your chest) that was popularized by Mr. West, himself, as well as rapper A$AP Rocky, basketball mega-star Russell Westbrook, and since-accused serial rapist Ian Connor. (As ACRONYM co-founder Errolson Hugh has since pointed out, the rig, itself, is a dead-ringer for “an original design by Evan Hill of backcountry outfitters Hill People Gear,” making the “it” bag “the result of a practice based in testing, experience, and solid functional principles, not fashion.”)

Williams’ impending tenure – which starts this month and which the California-born creative says will be part of “a new era based on modernity and inclusivity” for Givenchy – is, in fact, noteworthy. But the most interesting element at play here is not really Williams, his plans for the brand or his long list of collaborations and famous friends. It is what his appointment says about Givenchy’s parent company, LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton.

Friedman aptly notes that Williams’ appointment suggests that LVMH is “doubling down on the idea that the future of luxury will have less to do with a designer’s ability to cut a pattern than their ability to amalgamate the broader cultural moment,” and that is true. To a large extent, Givenchy’s new hire is a crystal-clear and very tangible demonstration of the model that is LVMH; it is seemingly the latest signifier that LVMH is no longer – and has not been for quite some time – really dealing in any traditional understanding of luxury, one that shuns mass production, refuses to pander to consumers’ whims, and maintains a steadfast dedication to quality.

More realistically, LVMH is a corporate behemoth with a very-robust bottom line that is the best in the world not at creating luxury goods but at building out (i.e., creating increased tangible and intangible value in) globally-famous brands. In terms of the offerings of many of its brands, this means giving masses of consumers exactly what they want – whether that be coated canvas handbags covered in well-known logos or expensive but not-bank-breaking t-shirts masquerading as high fashion … or particularly as of late, any array of streetwear-centric goods meant to whet the insatiable appetites of millennial spenders.

While at least some have proposed that Williams might struggle to find fans among the house’s couture devotees, the buzzy young creative will likely fit neatly – at least for the increasingly short 2-3 year time period that is the modern-day creative director tenure – within this ecosystem that thrives on marketing and high-margin (and thus, high profit) “it” goods. Under his watch, LVMH will seek to continue to transform Givenchy into a billion dollar brand ideally with hordes of fans willing to shell out for pricey accessories and t-shirts, harkening back to when Waight Keller’s predecessor Riccardo Tisci was at the helm.

In other words, LVMH will continue to mold Givenchy not into a luxury brand in the traditional sense (i.e., one that observes ideals, such as scarcity, the highest quality materials and construction, and a position that eschews fleeting fashion trends), but a blockbuster from a revenue standpoint because that is is LVMH’s model and precisely how it has garnered itself a market capitalization of nearly $200 billion, annual sales of just under $60 billion (the vast majority of which comes from handbags and small leather goods), and the title of the largest luxury goods group in the world.

This is not news, though. The French conglomerate, led by shrewd businessman and billionaire Bernard Arnault, is widely as a luxury goods purveyor. However, while Arnault has built a bona fide empire, with upwards of 70 brands, from Louis Vuitton, Dior, Fendi, Givenchy, and Celine, to wine and spirits companies and retailers like Sephora, under its umbrella, the group has not necessarily rise to the top by manufacturing and selling luxury goods in the traditional sense. That may have been the case when LVMH first acquired brands like Louis Vuitton, Christian Dior, Givenchy, and co. many decades ago, but in the time since then and in furtherance of its efforts to expand these formerly privately held houses, the offerings and the larger mission has evolved.

Now, more realistically, LVMH and its companies operate far more as mass entities (particularly when compared to the likes of Brunello Cuccinelli, Hermes, and co.) that are in the business of helping millions of consumers to conspicuously display their own personal brands – whether that be on Instagram or IRL. They do this by selling them large volumes of accessories and at least some garments (albeit not runway ones) under the guise of luxury thanks to the houses’ origins and decades of marketing efforts that focus, at least in part, on quality, craftsmanship, and the aura of exclusivity.

Look beyond the runways and the stories of fabled ateliers and historic workshops, and in practice, these companies are handbag purveyors with iron-clad arsenals of instantly-recognizable and coveted trademarks (and related goodwill) to trade in. The good news for Givenchy: Chances are, a fancy-buckled chest rig with ties to big-name celebrities just might be the thing that can be neatly packaged and sold to brand-name-happy consumers looking to conspicuously prove their worth and fashionability. And at the end of the day, it just might be the thing to help LVMH give people want they want, and thus, bulk up sales (and profit) at Givenchy … for the time being, at least.

UPDATED (June 16, 2020): This article has been updated to include a comment from Errolson Hugh regarding the potential origins of the Alyx chest rig."
LVMH-Tiffany Deal Faces Uncertainty - Rapaport,"Thu, 04 Jun 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiPmh0dHBzOi8vcmFwYXBvcnQuY29tL25ld3MvbHZtaC10aWZmYW55LWRlYWwtZmFjZXMtdW5jZXJ0YWludHkv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"RAPAPORT… The LVMH board met on Tuesday to discuss its takeover of Tiffany & Co., fueling rumors that the $16.2 billion deal was less certain than before Covid-19.

The panel of directors “focused its attention on the development of the pandemic and its potential impact on the results and perspectives of Tiffany & Co. with respect to the agreement that links the two groups,” LVMH said in a brief statement Thursday.

LVMH agreed in November to buy the New York-based jeweler for $135 per share. However, Tiffany’s stock fell to just under $130 as of June 1, and has since slumped to $114 following a report on Tuesday by Women’s Wear Daily that the deal was under threat.

The European luxury group’s board is worried about the effects of the coronavirus and social unrest on Tiffany’s important US business, according to the report, which cited unnamed sources. Directors also expressed concerns about Tiffany’s ability to cover all its debt covenants by the time the transaction closed, which was due to happen in mid-2020, it continued.

Meanwhile, Bernard Arnault, LVMH’s CEO and chairman, is exploring ways of pressuring Tiffany to lower the selling price, Reuters reported Wednesday.

“We do believe the transaction will occur, but a lower price may or may not be possible,” US investment bank Cowen said in a research note Wednesday. “We remain confident that this is a great long-term transaction and will have many synergies.”

LVMH also said it was not considering buying cheap Tiffany stock on the open market to benefit from the reduced share price.

Mexico overtakes U.S. in daily number of coronavirus deaths for first time

3:20 p.m. (Singapore time) — Mexico reported more daily deaths than the U.S. for the first time on Wednesday. It had a record 1,092 fatalities, while the U.S. reported 1,045 deaths on Wednesday, according to Reuters. That sharp jump in numbers was attributed to improved documenting, the report said, after growing criticism that its limited test rate meant most cases and deaths were not being recorded. — Weizhen Tan

George Floyd had coronavirus, according to medical examiner's autopsy

1:50 p.m. (Singapore time) — George Floyd, a black man who was killed while in police custody in Minneapolis last week, tested positive for coronavirus weeks before his death, according to an autopsy report from the Hennepin County Medical Examiner's Office. NBC News reported that the document showed an April 3 test was positive for the virus' RNA, which can remain in the body weeks after a disease clears. The autopsy said a second positive test after his death likely indicated that Floyd was asymptomatic from an earlier infection when he died May 25, NBC reported. The CDC has previously said that a positive RNA test does not necessarily indicate that the virus is infectious.

It reduces the share of loan money small business have to spend on payroll in order to get the loan forgiven, to 60% from 75%. Recipients have six months to use the money, rather than two. It also extends the June 30 deadline to rehire workers, among other provisions. –Jacob Pramuk

5 p.m. ET — Hydroxychloroquine doesn't prevent infection of the coronavirus, according to results published in the New England Journal of Medicine. The study, led by Dr. David Boulware, an infectious disease researcher at the University of Minnesota, looked at 821 people who were exposed to the virus. About 12% of the people who were given the malaria drug developed Covid-19, compared with 14% who did not receive the drug, according to the study's findings. The study is the first randomized, placebo-controlled trial, which is considered the ""gold standard"" in science. —Berkeley Lovelace Jr.

Walmart says there's still a need for office space, despite rise of work-from-home

3:12 p.m. ET — Many Americans may be working from kitchen tables and home offices during the coronavirus pandemic, but Walmart executives think office space still has a place in the future. The retail giant is building a new headquarters in its hometown of Bentonville, Arkansas. It will span more than 300 acres and have amenities, including fitness centers, hiking trails and a child-care facility. During the company's annual shareholder meeting, which was held virtually, Walmart executives fielded a question about whether the pandemic — and the rise of work-from-home — will change its plans. Dan Bartlett, the company's executive vice president of corporate affairs, said it already planned on a flexible office design. He said it's factoring in evolving work habits during the architectural phase of the project. But CEO Doug McMillon added that offices will remain important, even though employees are productive at home. ""As this crisis has gone on, we've noticed things that we're missing,"" he said. For example, he said it's been hard to onboard new employees, introduce them to people and integrate them into company culture. —Melissa Repko

2:21 p.m. ET — The coronavirus has not mutated in a way that would significantly change how it spreads among humans or how lethal it is, World Health Organization officials said. Scientists and virologists are collecting samples of the virus from all over the world and comparing the genetic sequence found in each sample in order to track whether it is evolving, the WHO said. Scientists have so far found only ""normal changes"" in the virus, Dr. Maria Van Kerkhove, head of WHO's emerging diseases and zoonosis unit, said. ""To date, to my knowledge, we haven't seen any particular signal in the virus' behavior or in its sequence that would lead us to believe the virus is changing in its nature, has changed in its transmission dynamics, or changed in its lethality,"" Dr. Mike Ryan, executive director of the WHO's emergencies program, said. —Will Feuer

Black voters are hit harder by the coronavirus and more worried about the pandemic than others: CNBC/Change Research poll

1:16 p.m. ET — Black voters in six swing states have taken a bigger hit from the coronavirus than other racial groups, and they have more concerns about the pandemic moving forward, according to a new CNBC/Change Research poll. A larger share of black respondents than Hispanic or white voters have been diagnosed with Covid-19 or know someone who has, the poll found. A higher percentage of black voters (42%) than Hispanic (37%) or white (29%) respondents said they or a member of their household have lost their job or been furloughed. The CNBC/Change Research poll surveyed 3,958 likely voters in Arizona, Florida, Michigan, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin from Friday through Sunday and has a margin of error of plus or minus 1.6 percentage points. A larger share of black voters than Hispanic or white respondents said they are worried about themselves or a family member getting sick, the U.S. economy reopening too soon or their job security and health care costs in the next year. The survey, which underscores the disproportionate burden black Americans have borne from the pandemic, comes during a week of nationwide protests against systemic racism following a string of police-involved killings of black men and women. –Jacob Pramuk

Trump to ban Chinese airlines from flying to the U.S.

12:51 p.m. ET — The Trump administration will prohibit Chinese passenger airlines from flying scheduled service to the U.S. this month, as a dispute between the governments of the two largest aviation markets escalates. U.S. airlines suspended service to China earlier this year after demand plunged because of the coronavirus. Delta and United have been trying to return, but Chinese officials haven't yet permitted them to do so. The U.S., in retaliation, won't allow passenger airlines from operating their flights between the two countries starting June 16. ""Our overriding goal is not the perpetuation of this situation, but rather an improved environment wherein the carriers of both parties will be able to exercise fully their bilateral rights,"" said the U.S. Department of Transportation's order. ""Should the [Chinese aviation authority] adjust its policies to bring about the necessary improved situation for U.S. carriers, the Department is fully prepared to revisit the action it has announced in this order."" The measure affects Air China, China Eastern, China Southern and Xiamen. The airlines didn't immediately comment. —Leslie Josephs

The coronavirus crisis could have a lasting impact on the gender wage gap

12 p.m. ET — Even with millions of Americans now working from home, the wage disparity among parents persists, and could likely worsen due to Covid-19. Already, mothers are paid only 70 cents for every dollar paid to fathers, which translates to a loss of $18,000 a year, according to a new analysis of Census data by the National Women's Law Center.



Going forward, the gender wage gap could grow as women disproportionately cut back on work to take care of their children as childcare options remain limited. –Jessica Dickler

As pandemic causes soup sales to soar, Campbell Soup expects higher demand to continue

12 p.m. ET — After sales of Campbell Soup's iconic broths and soared 35% during its fiscal third quarter, the company is expecting to keep seeing elevated demand, even as the weather heats up and states reopen. Campbell CEO Mark Clouse said on ""Squawk on the Street"" that retailers will have to restock their inventories, which will lift demand even if consumers are buying less of those products. Still, Clouse said that he expects that consumers will continue to eat more soup and consume other Campbell's products compared to historic levels. The pandemic has reversed consumers' preference for fresher food options, reviving sales for categories that had been declining in recent years. Shares of the company fell nearly 5% in morning trading despite it raising its 2020 outlook and topping analysts' earnings estimates. —Amelia Lucas

11:25 a.m. ET — Amid nationwide protests over the death of George Floyd and the easing of restrictions across the country, public health specialists warn that Covid-19 threatens to bounce back later this year. Some other countries that were hit hard by the virus, such as Germany and Italy, have driven down the number of daily new infections to just hundreds per day. The U.S. has struggled to do the same with more than 20,000 new cases diagnosed every day. If that number doesn't fall, the country could be in for another major outbreak in the fall, public health specialists who spoke with CNBC said, adding that the protests are likely to spread the virus. ""It's heartbreaking on a number of levels, for sure from the infectious diseases and epidemiology levels,"" Dr. Katie Passaretti said. ""You have big groups coming together and people from far apart places coming together. It's a risk for spread of Covid."" —Will Feuer

Vaccine will be 'seasonal,' Dr. Scott Gottlieb says

7:32 a.m. ET — Any coronavirus vaccine that proves to be safe and effective will still probably only provide immunity for a limited amount of time, maybe ""up to a year,"" former Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb said. His comments come after White House health advisor Dr. Anthony Fauci said Tuesday he worries about the ""durability"" of a potential coronavirus vaccine, saying there's a chance it may not provide long-term immunity. ""This is probably going to be a seasonal vaccine,"" Gottlieb said in an interview with CNBC's ""Squawk Box."" ""It's probably a vaccine that we're going to need to take every year. Dr. Fauci's right, the immunity's not going to be long term in the form of a smallpox vaccine or a polio vaccine where you get the vaccine once and you're protected for the rest of your life or most of your life."" Eventually, people might be asked to take the coronavirus vaccine annually along with the flu vaccine, Gottlieb said. —Will Feuer Disclosure: Scott Gottlieb is a CNBC contributor and is a member of the boards of Pfizer and biotech company Illumina.

The French entrepreneur is one of the richest men in the world and is currently the owner of the Louis Vuitton group. According to Bloomberg, he has assets estimated to be worth $113billion.

There has been widespread speculation that Arnault is interested in purchasing the Rossoneri from American hedge fund Elliott Management.

La Repubblica even went big with a report earlier in the year which stated that that Arnault has tabled a €975m bid to buy Milan, and a number of sources have continued to insist that the Frenchman has a genuine interest, though denials have almost always arrived from those close to Arnault.

According to the latest from TMW, rumours have arisen once again regarding the possible sale of the majority shares of the club on the basis of €500million plus an additional €350million to be paid in under certain conditions.

​​Ariedo Braida could be be brought back as part of the takeover having operated under Silvio Berlusconi’s ownership, and the former director would be more than willing to secure a return to the Rossoneri.

When asked by Tuttomercatoweb, the Elliott Fund did not issue statements but defined the matter as unfounded. LVMH declined to comment on the matter."

Discretionary retailers around the world have faced store closures and a collapse in consumer spending since governments ordered most businesses shut to slow the spread of the virus earlier this year.

Seafolly's move into adminstration points to gaps in various corporate relief packages set up by the Australian government during the shutdown, such as a wage subsidy scheme and a deferral of certain financial reporting obligations to help companies stay afloat.

A month earlier, Australian clothing retailer PAS Group Ltd <PGR.AX> hired administrators citing the pandemic. Local media reported in March that Tigerlily, a swimsuit maker rival of Seafolly, also went into administration.

KordaMentha, Seafolly's administrator, did not give details about the company's decision to hand over control, but did say it would ""immediately commence a sale of business process"".

Seafolly's current owner, L Catterton, a U.S. private equity firm part-owned by LVMH, bought the Australian company in 2014, according to its website.

The Australian label is sold in 1,200 stores across 46 countries at stores, the website said.

Can Tiffany's New Face Fuel Its China Market? - Jing Daily,"Sat, 06 Jun 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vamluZ2RhaWx5LmNvbS9wb3N0cy9jYW4tdGlmZmFueXMtbmV3LWZhY2UtZnVlbHMtaXRzLWNoaW5hLW1hcmtldNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"On June 2, Tiffany & Co. announced that Jackson Yee, the wildly popular singer, dancer, and actor would be the brand ambassador of its iconic Tiffany T collection via the brand’s social accounts on Weibo, WeChat, and Little Red Book. According to the brand’s official statement, Yee represents Tiffany’s brand identity and values — persistence, independence , and confidence. As one of the top-tier Chinese male idols, Yee wields a huge influence among Chinese millennials and Gen Zers, with a whopping 84.6 million Weibo followers. Tiffany’s campaign post has garnered over one million reposts and engagements. While user comments below the post agreed with Yee’s characteristics aligning with Tiffany’s T collection, many also seconded their support by purchasing pieces from this collection.

The Jing Take

Tiffany is not the first luxury jewelry house to bet on a young celebrities’ influence in China’s vast luxury market. Whether Bvlgari hiring Kris Wu as its brand ambassador or Cartier casting Hua Chenyu and Zhang Xueying for its 520 campaign, the brands’ celebrity selections have tended to lean on younger talents. Likewise, Yee’s endorsement for the Tiffany T collection, which was a discerning choice given that Yee’s appearance fits well with the clean, sharp design of the collection.

Though there are debates whether a luxury house resorting to young idols will dilute their brand equity and possibility lose loyal consumers, leveraging celebrity power can optimize digital strategies and help them recover their China business post-COVID-19. In Tiffany’s case, the brand has decided to doubled down on the Chinese market. Chief Executive Officer Alessandro Bogliolo expected double-digit growth in China last December despite the weak economy. The prolonged slump of the luxury sector amid COVID-19 has not only disrupted the company’s ambition, but it also might have affected its deal with LVMH. The luxury conglomerate has confirmed on June 4 that LVMH is “not considering buying Tiffany shares on the market.” Tiffany’s market price has been bumpy since the rumor came out.

Tiffany & Co. and Chewy earnings: What to know in markets Tuesday - Yahoo Canada Finance,"Mon, 08 Jun 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vY2EuZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy90aWZmYW55LWNvLWFuZC1jaGV3eS1lYXJuaW5ncy13aGF0LXRvLWtub3ctaW4tbWFya2V0cy10dWVzZGF5LTIzMTUwMTIwNC5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Earnings season is nearly over, but Tiffany & Co. (TIF) and Chewy (CHWY) earnings Tuesday will be closely watched by investors.

Tiffany has been thrust in the spotlight recently following reports that Louis Vuitton owner LVMH could potentially back down from its planned acquisition of the jewelry retailer. In the latest development, CNBC reported Monday that Tiffany was not open to renegotiating deal terms with LVMH.

LVMH was set to acquire Tiffany & Co. in a $16.2 billion deal; however, LVMH board members met about one week ago to discuss the merger.

“The Board of Directors of LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, met on Tuesday, June 2nd, 2020 and notably focused its attention on the development of the pandemic and its potential impact on the results and perspectives of Tiffany & Co with respect to the agreement that links the two groups,” LVMH said in a press release. “Considering the recent market rumors, LVMH confirms, on this occasion, that it is not considering buying Tiffany shares on the market.”

Tiffany will release first quarter results ahead of the market open Tuesday. The company is expected to report an adjusted loss per share of 27 cents on $611.86 million in revenue, according to analysts polled by Bloomberg. Shares of the jewelry retailer were down about 8% so far in 2020, while the broader market rose roughly 1% in the same time period.

After the closing bell, online pet retailer Chewy is expected to report an adjusted loss per share of 4 cents on $1.53 billion in revenue.

RBC analyst Mark Mahaney believes that Wall Street’s expectations for Chewy’s first quarter and Q2 guidance are reasonable. Though the interest in Chewy might have decelerated from the peak, Google Searches for Chewy suggest brand awareness is high.

“We saw Google Search Trends for Chewy normalizing (tho to a higher level) after an inflection in March. The company continues to exhibit a very consistent upward trend on this metric for the past several years, which we take to suggest its consistent brand awareness gain across the ~90MM pet-owning U.S. Households,” Mahaney wrote in a June 5 note.

Story continues

Shares of Chewy rose 68% this year and have outperformed the broader market.

Other notable earnings reports scheduled for Tuesday include Signet Jewelers (SIG) before market open and GameStop (GME) after market close.

"Frédéric Arnault, Son of LVMH Founder Bernard, Has Been Named CEO of Tag Heuer - Robb Report","Thu, 04 Jun 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vcm9iYnJlcG9ydC5jb20vc3R5bGUvd2F0Y2gtY29sbGVjdG9yL2ZyZWRlcmljLWFybmF1bHQtaGFzLWJlZW4tbmFtZWQtY2VvLW9mLXRhZy1oZXVlci0yOTI2MDk3L9IBamh0dHBzOi8vcm9iYnJlcG9ydC5jb20vc3R5bGUvd2F0Y2gtY29sbGVjdG9yL2ZyZWRlcmljLWFybmF1bHQtaGFzLWJlZW4tbmFtZWQtY2VvLW9mLXRhZy1oZXVlci0yOTI2MDk3L2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"When it comes to business, LVMH likes to keep things in the family.

Frédéric Arnault, son of the luxury conglomerate’s founder Bernard Arnault, was just appointed as the CEO of luxury Swiss watchmaker TAG Heuer. One of the younger members of the Arnault clan, Frédéric joins some of his siblings in taking on more senior roles within the LVMH infrastructure––a critically important strategic move as the family controls just under half of the business.

Beginning on July 1st, the 28-year-old will officially begin his role as the brand’s chief executive; he’s worked at the brand for the past three years in various roles, developing digital strategies as watch brands struggle to engage with a new generation of customers. Though fairly young for his new title, Frédéric spent time at both Facebook and the consulting firm McKinsey before working closely with current TAG CEO Stéphane Bianchi.

In a parallel move, Bianchi, who oversees all watch brands in addition to TAG Heuer, will get an expanded role that also oversees jewelry at LVMH, with the notable exception of Bulgari.

With Frédéric’s ascension to his new position, he’ll become the fourth of Bernard’s five children to hold senior roles within LVMH. Despite being a publicly traded company, the elder Arnault is known to exercise tight control over the houses that operate under his umbrella and it’s been speculated that the roles in which he’s installed his children act as a testing ground for who will replace him at some point––though he shows no sign of slowing.

LVMH has expanded dramatically in recent years, the biggest point of growth being its acquisition of New York City-based jeweler Tiffany & Co. The American heritage brand was purchased for a staggering $16.2 billion––the largest deal in luxury history. However, amid the economic tumult brought on by the coronavirus pandemic and international protests in support of black lives, the company is reportedly questioning that deal."

Hennessy surpassed eight million cases in 2019

The world’s best‐selling Cognac brand, Hennessy, continued its upward sales trajectory in 2019 when it crossed the eight‐million‐case mark for the first time.

The Cognac, owned by French luxury conglomerate LVMH, grew by 2.9% last year. The only other million‐case Cognac in growth in 2019 was Courvoisier, but only by 0.1%. Martell and Rémy Martin declined by 1.1% and 4.4% respectively. It’s a stark contrast to 2018 when all four brands saw volumes grow.

For the fifth consecutive year, Cognac exports improved on the previous year’s performance in terms of both volume and value to reach their highest levels to date, according to the Bureau National Interprofessionnel du Cognac (BNIC).

Exports from 1 August 2018 to 31 July 2019 surpassed 211.1 million bottles – an increase of 2.5% on the previous year. By value, exports reached €3.4 billion (US$3.7bn) – almost 6.9% more than in 2018.

According to LVMH’s 2019 financial results, Hennessy is now the “world’s leading premium spirits brand by value”. The Cognac increased sales on an organic basis by 6% last year, with “solid momentum” in its key markets – the US, China and travel retail.

Michaël Aidan, chief marketing and communications officer at Hennessy, says the brand’s growth was thanks to a “combination of product availability, strong in‐store visibility and impactful communication platforms”.

LVMH noted the brand “continued to extend its lead” in the emerging markets of Africa and the Caribbean, helped by the increase in sales of its flagship VS, VSOP and XO variants.

Aidan says Hennessy has “invested consistently and has always made it its business to remain locally relevant and close to its communities. Each market has been developed with the opposite of a one‐size‐fits‐all approach.” He adds that markets such as South Africa, Nigeria, Russia and the UK are essential to Hennessy’s development.

The brand’s success can perhaps be attributed to its marketing efforts. LVMH said the Hennessy XO – The Seven Worlds marketing campaign, directed by English filmmaker Ridley Scott, of Gladiator and Alien fame, was “one of the luxury industry’s most‐watched digital campaigns”, with more than 120m views in five months. LVMH said it had a “halo effect” on Hennessy. A 60‐second version of the video was aired during a commercial break for the Oscars in February 2019.

Hennessy has also harnessed the power of celebrity to promote its brand. Last year, the company named actor Henry Golding as the official ambassador for the brand’s Prestige range of Cognacs, including its XO variant and the Rare Cognac Collection. In June, the company also unveiled the latest chapter in its VSOP Privilège campaign, and launched its 2019 Very Special Limited Edition Release, designed by Argentine‐Spanish contemporary artist Felipe Pantone.

LVMH is planning to put solid investment behind Hennessy. The brand said it continues to “invest to prepare for the future and ensure a constant level of excellence in its Cognacs”. The firm opened seven wine cellars in 2019 and built a new packaging line at its €100m (US$110m) Pont Neuf site, which opened in 2017.

Frédéric is passionate about watchmaking, and I am convinced that he and his management team are best placed to lead this wonder ful Maison to the heights of achievement it deserves.”

“Since his arrival at LVMH, Stéphane has given the Watchmaking Division a new lease of life, strengthening the fundamental principles of each of the brands and exploring promising new avenues,” says Bernard Arnault, Chairman and Chief Executive officer.

These two appointments demonstrate our full confidence in the growth potential of these brands. I wish them both every success going forward.”

At the start of 2017 he joined TAG Heuer to manage its smartwatch activities. Since being appointed Chief Strategy and Digital Officer in October 2018, he has led an ambitious transformation and digitalisation campaign within the Maison in close collaboration with Stéphane Bianchi, CEO of the Watchmaking Division and TAG Heuer.

Williams as head of the men's and women's ready-to-wear and accessories collections, as well as the haute couture collections.

Sidney Toledano, Chairman and CEO of LVMH Fashion Group and member of the LVMH Executive Committee, said: “I am very happy to see Matthew M. Williams join the LVMH Group. Since he took part in the LVMH Prize, we have had the pleasure of watching him develop into the great talent he is today. I believe his singular vision of modernity will be a great opportunity for Givenchy to write its new chapter with strength and success.”

Matthew M. Williams is a 34-year-old, self-taught designer from Chicago. In 2015, he launched Alyx, named after his eldest daughter, a streetwear label deliciously anchored in contemporary reality. In 2016, he was selected for the LVMH Prize, and continued to develop his men's and women's label, which grew to become 1017 Alyx 9SM.

Givenchy's new creative director is known for advocating authentic values of research, technical innovation and creative reorientation, all of which are qualities that rhyme with the spirit of the House of Givenchy.

“I am extremely honored to join the House of Givenchy. The Maison’s unique position and timeless aura make it an undeniable icon and I am looking forward to working together with its ateliers and teams, to move it into a new era based on modernity and inclusivity,” says the designer, before concluding with the words: “In these unprecedented times for the world, I want to send a message of hope, together with my community and colleagues, and intend to contribute towards positive change.”

Today, the French luxury house announced its new creative director: 1017 ALYX 9SM founder Matthew M Williams.

The 34-year-old Californian will relocate to Paris to take on his first major creative director role at LVMH‘s Givenchy. The rationale behind the selection wasn’t clarified by the house but considering that LVMH dominated headlines with its hiring of Virgil Abloh to Louis Vuitton, it follows that the luxury conglomerate would be keen to add Abloh’s Been Trill co-founder and personal friend Williams to its roster. Williams has also partnered with LVMH-owned Dior for specialty accessories under the supervision of Williams’ colleague, Kim Jones.

Founded in 2015, Williams’ 1017 ALYX 9SM — occasionally shortened to ALYX — is backed by Italian powerhouse Slam Jam and has seen explosive growth in the past several years. After obtaining LVMH Prize finalist status in 2016, ALYX’s menswear line debuted in 2017 and eventually grew to surpass the womenswear line in global stockists. Currently, the brand is offered by some of the industry’s most prized retailers, including Dover Street Market, SSENSE and Selfridges.

1017 ALYX 9SM is perhaps best known for its signature rollercoaster buckle-equipped accessories which have graced Dior runways and become celebrity favorites. The label’s technical, adventure-inspired designs frequently take cues from subcultures as diverse as rock climbing and goth music, fostering collaborations with brands like Nike, ROA and Blackmeans.

“I am extremely honored to join the House of Givenchy,” Williams said in a statement. “I am looking forward to working together with its ateliers and teams, to move it into a new era, based on modernity and inclusivity. In these unprecedented times for the world, I want to send a message of hope, together with my community and colleagues, and intend to contribute towards positive change.”

“I want to warmly welcome Matthew M Williams to the beautiful Maison Givenchy,” continued Renaud de Lesquen, CEO and President of Givenchy. “I am convinced that, with his unapologetic approach to design and creativity and in great collaboration with the Maison’s exceptional ateliers and teams, Matthew will help Givenchy reach its full potential.”

In his new role as creative director, Williams will be responsible for much of the same tasks that Keller set to accomplish as artistic director: overseeing and developing the creative output of the menswear, womenswear and accompanying accessories, plus the brand image. He may also be expected to bring about major growth for the house; as Business of Fashion reported, former Givenchy CEO Philippe Fortunato stated in 2018 that parent company LVMH was aiming to grow Givenchy to Dior-like size, meaning revenue of approximately €2 billion ($2.14 billion) at the time.

LVMH doesn’t release individual revenue reports for most of its brands (Louis Vuitton and Dior excluded), but independent analysis firm Owler currently estimates revenue of $718 million USD.

Williams will show his first collection for Givenchy in October. In the meantime, Williams provided the house with a special voice clip and new portrait shot by famed photographer Paolo Reversi."

LVMH names Frederic Arnault CEO of Tag Heuer as Swiss luxury-watch maker seeks to reinvent itself - AsiaOne,"Mon, 08 Jun 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFzaWFvbmUuY29tL3dvcmxkL2x2bWgtbmFtZXMtZnJlZGVyaWMtYXJuYXVsdC1jZW8tdGFnLWhldWVyLXN3aXNzLWx1eHVyeS13YXRjaC1tYWtlci1zZWVrcy1yZWludmVudC1pdHNlbGbSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LVMH says Frederic Arnault, one of the younger sons of the luxury goods group's billionaire boss, will take over running watch brand Tag Heuer, joining his siblings in taking on bigger roles within the conglomerate.

The Arnault family controls just under half of LVMH, which has vastly expanded through acquisitions under CEO Bernard Arnault, France's richest man, and owns fashion labels such as Louis Vuitton and also champagne and jewellery brands.

Frederic Arnault, 25, will step up at Tag Heuer as of July 1, the company says. He had previously worked at the label, but with a focus on developing its digital activities, at a time when watch brands are struggling to reinvent themselves for a younger clientele and face falling demand.

Four of Bernard Arnault's five children now occupy senior positions within the group, including at Vuitton and at luggage maker Rimowa, the German luggage brand helmed by CEO Alexandre Arnault.

LVMH also said in a statement that Stephane Bianchi, who oversees all watch brands, would expand his remit to take the helm of jewellery brands too, with the exception of Bulgari. Other brands include Chaumet.

LVMH last year agreed to buy US jeweller Tiffany for US$16.2 billion (S$22 billion), vastly expanding its footprint in one of the fastest-growing segments of the luxury market.

Retailers have since been hit hard by the coronavirus crisis, however, and sources have said LVMH is now exploring options to try to lower the purchase price."
