"At $329 Billion, LVMH Is Now the Most Valuable Company in Europe - Robb Report","Tue, 02 Mar 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vcm9iYnJlcG9ydC5jb20vbGlmZXN0eWxlL25ld3MvbHZtaC1pcy1ub3ctdGhlLW1vc3QtdmFsdWFibGUtY29tcGFueS1pbi1ldXJvcGUtMTIzNDU5OTM2OC_SAWVodHRwczovL3JvYmJyZXBvcnQuY29tL2xpZmVzdHlsZS9uZXdzL2x2bWgtaXMtbm93LXRoZS1tb3N0LXZhbHVhYmxlLWNvbXBhbnktaW4tZXVyb3BlLTEyMzQ1OTkzNjgvYW1wLw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LVMH has devoured the largest food and beverage company in the world, Nestle, to become the most valuable company in Europe.

According to the research data analyzed and published by Finaria, the French luxury powerhouse’s market capitalization stood at approximately $319.4 billion (€264.6 billion) as of February 26, 2021. This surge pushed it past Nestle which was valued at roughly $292 billion (€242 billion). As of publication, Bernard Arnault’s ever-expanding empire is sitting at $328.9 billion, putting it a full $20 billion ahead of the Swiss food giant’s $308.7 billion. To put this in context, LVMH now ranks as the 21st most valuable company in the world. Apple sits on top of that list with a market cap of just over $2.1 trillion.

As the world’s largest luxury group, LVMH comprises 75 primary brands across five categories, including leather goods behemoth Louis Vuitton, the champagne and spirits group Moet-Hennessey, and high-end fashion houses Dior, Givenchy and Fendi, to name but a few. The conglomerate also recently acquired storied US jeweler Tiffany & Co. for $15.8 billion in the most expensive deal in the history of the luxury business.

While LVMH shares (and profits) dropped significantly in the first half of 2020 due to the Covid-19 pandemic, by early November they had bounced back and finished the year with a gain of almost 24 percent at $617 (€510). In fact, LVMH’s share price has actually increased nearly 43 percent since this time last year.

Overall, LVMH’s revenue sank by 16 percent to $53 billion (€44.7 billion) in 2020, which is not bad at all given the circumstances. The group’s solid performance is due to two primary factors. Firstly, its steadfast fashion and leather goods division. Throughout 2020, this division’s organic revenue only dropped 3 percent and thus accounted for 86.5 percent of LVMH’s profits for 2020.

Second, LVMH’s resilient sales throughout Asia. The group registered 34 percent of its sales in Asia last year (up 21 percent YoY), compared with 24 percent in the United States. In contrast, sales in Europe fell by 24 percent. The group also managed to boost online sales as visits to brick-and-mortar stores declined.

As for 2021, analysts are projecting an increase of 18 percent in revenue and a 67 percent uptick in earnings for LVMH. The group’s chairman is equally optimistic.

“In a context that remains uncertain, even with the hope of vaccination giving us a glimpse of an end to the pandemic, we are confident that LVMH is in an excellent position to build upon the recovery for which the world wishes in 2021 and to further strengthen our lead in the global luxury market,” Arnault said in a statement."
LVMH's Birkenstock acquisition could mean more for your wardrobe than you realise - British GQ,"Mon, 01 Mar 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdxLW1hZ2F6aW5lLmNvLnVrL2Zhc2hpb24vYXJ0aWNsZS9sdm1oLWFjcXVpc2l0aW9uLWJpcmtlbnN0b2Nr0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"In a deal thought to be worth a cool £3.5 billion, Parisian super-conglomerate LVMH announced on Friday that it had acquired the majority stake in family-owned German sandal brand Birkenstock.

The group, which is owned and overseen by Bernard Arnault, the richest man in France, is best known for transforming legacy luxury brands into global fashion powerhouses. Louis Vuitton, Christian Dior, Celine and Givenchy all exist beneath the ample LVMH umbrella.

And although the acquisition – which saw LVMH fight off a competing bid from Breitling owner CVC Capital Partners – is undoubtedly good news for Birkenstock, not least due to the fact that it will allow the family-run company to rapidly expand production from its Görlitz-based factory, it’s the wider message it sends about the fashion industry’s current direction of travel that is perhaps most intriguing.

Founded by cobbler Johann Adam Birkenstock in 1774, Birkenstock has done much in recent years to shake off its reputation as the world’s premier manufacturer of footwear for Teutonic pensioners and allotment owners. Helped along by a host of smart collaborations with designers ranging from Rick Owens and Valentino to students of Central Saint Martins and Proenza Schouler, the brand has acquired a new sheen of cool in a very short space of time. What's more, the global pandemic gave it a surprise extra shot in the arm.

Indeed, where many fashion brands floundered last year, stymied by reduced production capabilities and limited customer desire, 2020 was Birkenstock’s moment to shine. The brand’s Boston clogs quickly became the unsuspecting poster shoes for the world’s lockdowns (Birkenstock’s CEO, Oliver Reichert, dubbed the footwear produced by his company the “official home-office shoe”) and sales – though not officially reported – were expected to vastly outstrip those in 2019, a year which saw the company shift some 23.8 million pairs of shoes globally.

And though many journalists and trend forecasters have predicted a boom in smarter clothes and shoes that are appropriate for a post-pandemic world in the second half of 2021, the news of the LVMH acquisition would suggest that our current collective preoccupation with comfort isn’t going anywhere any time soon – at least not if Mr Arnault has anything to do with it.

The shift towards a more understated mode of dressing was happening long before the pandemic struck, after all. The burgeoning athleisure sector, for instance, hit a record-breaking value of $414bn in 2019 and many of the world’s major luxury brands (a vast swathe of which Mr Arnault owns) that once made the bulk of their cash from selling expensive suits and slick dress shoes to the world’s well-heeled had started moving in a more laid-back direction. This has been thanks in part to the casualisation of the city, which was, in turn, precipitated by the digital boom of the 2000s and the 2010s.

Personally speaking, I bought two pairs of Birkenstock shoes last year (a shearling-lined pair of caramel-hued mules and some classic sandals in brown nubuck), but I’d be lying if I said I hadn’t already jumped on the dad-sandal train back in 2018, when I wore a pair of black shearling-lined Arizona sandals nearly every day. If you’d told me that that would be the state of things back in 2014, when I was a dyed-in-the-wool-suit-and-lace-up man, I’d have laughed in your face."
"Kering increases investment in resale, while LVMH steers clear - Glossy","Tue, 02 Mar 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmdsb3NzeS5jby9mYXNoaW9uL2tlcmluZy1pbmNyZWFzZXMtaXRzLWludmVzdG1lbnQtaW4tcmVzYWxlLXdoaWxlLWx2bWgtc3RlZXJzLWNsZWFyL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Luxury fashion brands and high-end resale have been circling each other for years now, with luxury alternating between interest in resale and mistrust in the benefits it offers brands. Recent moves from Kering, one of the largest luxury groups in the world, indicate that the company is taking a great interest in working directly with resellers and encouraging the growth of resale in general. Those moves also put Kering in stark contrast with rival LVMH, which, to date, has yet to intermingle with resale companies.

Announced on Monday, Kering led a $216 million funding round in French luxury resale site Vestiaire Collective, a platform increased its revenue by more than 100% in 2020. The round catapults Vestiaire to unicorn status, the company said. It’s the latest resale investment by Kering, which has been been active in the space at various levels over the last year. In January, Groupe Artemis, the parent company of Kering, invested an undisclosed sum in sneaker resale platform GOAT.

While Kering has not invested any money in luxury platform The RealReal, its top revenue-driving brand Gucci has been directly partnering with the platform since October 2020 by curating an exclusive shop of Gucci product on The RealReal’s online store. Stella McCartney is no longer a part of Kering as of the end of 2019, but prior to the split, the brand had an official partnership with The RealReal, as well.

“Pre-owned luxury is now a real and deeply rooted trend, especially among younger customers,” said François-Henri Pinault, CEO of Kering, in a statement emailed to Glossy. “Rather than ignoring it, our wish is to seize this opportunity to enhance the value we offer our customers and influence the future of our industry towards more innovative and more sustainable practices. This fits naturally with our entrepreneurial spirit, our pioneering sustainability strategy and our modern vision of luxury.”

Kering’s eagerness to pour hundreds of millions of dollars into the resale world is contrasted by chief rival LVMH’s unwillingness to dabble in resale at all. In December, LVMH’s head of communication, Antoine Arnault, said the company was only “looking at” resale, in an interview with Vogue Business. “It is still a little early to fully answer this question. It’s an economy that exists, that’s growing in importance, so we’re looking at it carefully,” he said.

But the resale market is increasingly becoming hard to ignore for luxury brands. In 2o2o, investors poured more than $150 million into luxury resale platforms, including $64 million into Vestiaire Collective. The entire secondhand market, which was valued at $28 billion in 2020, is expected to be valued at more than $60 billion in the next four years, according to GlobalData Retail. Max Bittner, CEO of Vestiaire Collective, said that integrating directly with the primary market was one of his main goals when he joined the company in 2019 and that the pandemic made conversations with companies like Kering and brands like Alexander McQueen much smoother. Prior, the company has partnered with brands lincluding Belstaff and By Far.

“The model has clearly demonstrated its ability to continue to thrive during challenging conditions,” Bittner said. “The resale sector as a whole is experiencing rapid growth, especially among millennial and Gen-Z consumers, which will come to shape the retail landscape of the future.”

LVMH is still the top luxury conglomerate in the world, bringing in more than $53 billion in revenue in 2020, 47% of which came from fashion and leather goods. Kering earned more than $15 billion. But by slacking on resale, LVMH gives Kering a head start on staking a significant claim in the expanding resale space."
Why No Other Luxury Company Compares To LVMH - Jing Daily,"Mon, 08 Mar 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vamluZ2RhaWx5LmNvbS9wb3N0cy9sdm1oLWV1cm9wZS1tb3N0LXZhbHVhYmxlLWNvbXBhbnktcmltb3dhLWRpb3LSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"According to data analyzed by Finaria, the French luxury house LVMH reached a staggering 319.4 billion (264.6 billion euros) as of February 26, 2021, surpassing Nestlé, the Swiss food giant, to become Europe’s most valuable company.

Added luxury value is a component resulting from psychological effects that make our brains attribute positive aspects (such as higher attractiveness, more expertise, a better life, and more self-esteem) to a person who buys or showcases a luxury item or brand.

Brands with powerful stories that create desire via ALV can add significant premiums due to the rare value they produce.

Most people are astonished by the size and dynamics of the luxury market. Intuitively, they assume luxury is a niche business — even people who work for luxury brands. But what many underestimate is a luxury brand’s enormous value creation potential.

This year marks a historic moment for the luxury industry. All brands are hoping for better performances than last year and a speedy recovery for the European and North American luxury markets. Both regions fared poorly during the pandemic, with some categories losing 50 percent or more of their market in these areas that many of the world’s most admired luxury brands call home.

With the pandemic still raging across the first quarter of 2021, and most key European markets in strict lockdowns, the news that LVMH just became Europe’s most valuable company might be surprising. According to data analyzed by Finaria, the French luxury house reached a staggering 319.4 billion (264.6 billion euros) as of February 26, 2021, surpassing Nestlé, the Swiss food giant.

What’s driving this all-time-high valuation is how the luxury group used 2020 better than other luxury houses and put itself in the pole position for when the markets come back. In short, their strategy execution is a masterpiece of extreme value creation from which other brands can learn.

What many brands don’t fully understand is that people don’t buy luxury for the product itself but for the brand's exclusive value. I have described this phenomenon, called Added Luxury Value (ALV), several times before in my Future of Luxury column.

Added luxury value is fascinating yet at the same time tricky. It is a value that results from psychological effects that make our brains attribute positive aspects (such as higher attractiveness, more expertise, a better life, and more self-esteem) to a person who buys or showcases a luxury item or brand. In other words, a luxury handbag or luxury watch makes you perceived as smarter, more attractive, and more fun to be with, according to my research.

It is an automatic, archaic response in our brains that we cannot deny. Studies in Europe, China, Japan, and North America confirmed that the ALV effect is universal — regardless of how much we like luxury and independent of age or other factors. Even the product is mostly irrelevant, as this desire is driven primarily by one’s perceived story about the brand.

Hence, brands with powerful stories that create desire via ALV can add significant premiums due to the rare value they produce. If your brand creates high perceived consumer value, you can price for it and achieve profitability far beyond other categories. If brands cannot develop powerful stories, offer consistent experiences, or price their products correctly, ALV either does not develop or collapses completely. And once it’s gone, it rarely returns. That’s why many brands in the luxury sector decline quickly or never take off at all. Managing ALV is a core task in luxury, and few brands spend the proper time on it.

Unsurprisingly, LVMH is a master of storytelling and brand experience creation. Bernard Arnault famously described luxury as the ability to create desire. The greater the lust, the higher the value creation. In turn, more customers flock to the brands with the highest value creation and are willing to pay prices that correspond to that value.

So how is that value achieved? With a combination of the best managers in luxury and uniquely talented creatives like Dior’s Kim Jones and Louis Vuitton’s Virgil Abloh. A good example is the acquisition of Rimowa. Before LVMH controlled the luggage brand, it was without a clear profile or quality brand storytelling, overemphasized heritage, and mistakenly sold their products wholesale (impacting the brand experience significantly). Meanwhile, the brand displayed almost a complete lack of innovation.

Alexandre Arnault cleaned up the brand’s distribution, got rid of wholesalers and promotions, significantly increased prices, and made the brand a disruptive force. Because of Rimowa’s efforts, carry-ons became as desirable as handbags for the first time in history, with seasonal collections that created the urge among wealthy travelers to showcase their newest and latest Rimowa carry-ons. The Off-White x Rimowa transparent trolley quickly became an instant hit. Then, during the pandemic, Rimowa pivoted to backpacks and more practical items that people could use every day. As a result, Rimowa became the perfect example of how a lagging brand can transform into a creative luxury powerhouse with a compelling brand story.

During the pandemic, LVMH acquired the famed jeweler Tiffany's. I expect the company to give the brand a complete transformation similar to Rimowa’s, which will breathe new life and significant growth into the iconic American brand with massive appeal in Asia. With an injection of creativity and experience creation, as well as more coherent pricing and assortment strategies, Tiffany will have enormous growth potential, as I’ve stated before in several columns.

Unlike many other luxury houses, LVMH has refrained from lowering prices or from promoting during the pandemic — a strategy that I suggest to be the best practice for luxury brands. In fact, brands like Dior introduced price increases, reflecting the extreme value its brand creates.

Another of LVMH's strong characteristics is that it isn’t afraid of making tough decisions. One such decision was putting Fenty — the glamorous fashion house it created together with pop singer Rihanna — on hold . Rumors about Fenty’s disappointing results and the high cost of establishing a new brand had led LVMH to shift its focus to more promising and scalable brands for the time being.

In 2020, key LVMH brands like Dior continued to expand digitally by experimenting with newer platforms like Tiktok, while other luxury brands were reluctant and slow to adapt. As such, the Dior x Air Jordan limited edition created one of the highest digital demands ever, with over 5 million people trying to buy the shoes over the website, which boosted resale prices of the limited edition to between 10,000 and 20,000, depending on the platform. That initiative shows the power of ALV.

The ability to consistently manage a complex brand portfolio with the primary focus of creating desire and ALV — and translating that extreme value into higher and higher prices — explains LVMH’s success story and has driven its market valuation to unprecedented heights. The company’s brands have been among the best managed during the pandemic, connecting strongly with their customer groups while always innovating.

LVMH provides a lesson for other luxury brands: If you focus on the excellent execution of a strong brand story, avoid the urge to promote, and digitally engage with your customer base in tough times, then you will be rewarded in customer desire, larger revenues, high profitability, and ultimately, top market capitalization. The current surge behind LVMH reflects that investors believe the company is well-positioned to lead, even in a pandemic. Do people have that kind of faith in your brand?

LVMH-Owned Handbag Maker Moynat Ignites Colorful New Chapter - WWD,"Thu, 11 Mar 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3dkLmNvbS9mYXNoaW9uLW5ld3MvZGVzaWduZXItbHV4dXJ5L21veW5hdC1yZWxhdW5jaC1sdm1oLWtuaWdodGx5LXZ1aXR0b24tMTIzNDc2NDA4MS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Get Nicholas Knightly talking about the use of color in handbags and his passion is palpable.

Moynat‘s new creative director, who joined the brand last July after more than 15 years at Louis Vuitton, has just unveiled his first designs and there’s a mysterious and engrossing peacock blue, a fiery pink that teeters on orange and a vivid green that’s somewhere between mint and kelly — and no black leather in view.

“We really celebrate color and it’s a big, big part of the brand,” Knightly enthused. “You’re seeing a diverse range of colors and the individual clients connect with those individual, beautiful colors and can find that beautiful bag just for them. To me, that’s the highest end of luxury.”

In exclusive interviews, Knightly and chief executive officer Lisa Attia, who joined Moynat a year ago from Sephora, said they leaned into the rich archive of the 19th-century trunk-maker and discovered many “untold stories,” such as its savoir-faire with locks.

They are also projecting the brand further into the modern age with more hands-free carrying options, a new e-commerce site loaded with storytelling, and its first image campaign, which exalts handbags as larger-than-life objects plunked in a range of very Parisian rooms.

The flurry of developments comes almost 10 years after French luxury titan Bernard Arnault revived the almost-forgotten brand, founded in 1849.

Moynat is five years older than Louis Vuitton and was best known for its lightweight, waterproof trunks for automobiles. Arnault set up shop for Moynat in 2011 on the Rue Saint-Honoré steps away from the privately owned Goyard, another 19th-century trunk-maker restored to glory.

With its modest retail footprint and low-key communications, Moynat stands out from the other luxury behemoths in Arnault’s family-controlled empire — which also includes Dior, Fendi, Givenchy and Celine.

Moynat is controlled by the family-owned Groupe Arnault, but Sidney Toledano, chairman and chief executive officer of LVMH Fashion Group, has taken on oversight of the brand, whose popular Mini Réjane handbags retail for about 4,000 euros.

“Artisanal craftsmanship is at the heart of Moynat,” said Toledano, who holds the title of chairman at the elite leather goods firm. “It is the moment to reassert Moynat’s brand notoriety and desirability through new creations and to continue craft preservation. For a brand with such strong heritage and legitimacy, the opportunity here is to widen the craft appreciation to a younger audience and for them to discover the wonder of Moynat.”

While more of a stealth player, Moynat has accrued a loyal following for its artisanal approach based on rare raw materials and haute savoir-faire. Market sources estimate the brand does about 50 million euros in revenues, and is poised for a new growth phase fueled by Knightly’s creativity and Attia’s digital and brand-building prowess.

Attia allowed that 2020 was a challenging year for the brand — France went into hard lockdown a week after she joined Moynat from Sephora — with the second half “above expectations.”

This year will see the brand open four boutiques — in Doha, Qatar, and in three Chinese cities, Nanjing, Wuhan and Shenzhen — adding to a network that already numbers 27 freestanding stores in the world. Attia plans to heighten the uniqueness of each new location with a bespoke product offer, limited editions and exclusive colors.

“To me, this is full of opportunities, and I really believe in in physical retail — when you come, you discover, you experience, you buy something that you will not find anywhere else in the world,” she said, also trumpeting its personalization services.

Moynat employs several full-time artists who meticulously handpaint initials, stripes or other customized motifs on leather or canvas bags. They employ an array of special colors, displayed in a row of jam-sized jars at the brand’s sun-drenched headquarters off the Rue du Mont-Thabor in central Paris.

Knightly’s office is next door, and its most striking feature is a giant board of small leather samples in a staggering array of shades, many in the grained “taurillon” leather for which Moynat is known. He won’t introduce any black bags until later this year.

To date, most of Moynat’s customers hail from Asia, with French and Americans rounding out its top-three. However, during the pandemic, the brand was able to recruit more local customers everywhere in the world, Attia said, noting Parisians took to the “nano” version of its bestselling Réjane bag.

The new e-commerce site, slated to go live on March 19, is seen as a vehicle to reach new generations of customers, portraying the product as the hero and recounting the brand history.

“Digital is the tool to be connected with your community,” she said. “We want to use digital to unlock and to share all those untold stories of Moynat.”

Beyond that, Attia described a will to shed Moynat’s somewhat “institutional” image, reinforced by its ladylike top-handle bags, and emphasize more of a lifestyle attitude, in tune with today’s ideas about mobility. “It’s important that the woman feels free to live, free to move,” she said.

While Moynat has dabbled with men’s products over the years, Knightly and Attia plan to initially focus exclusively on female customers and its leather bags, canvas totes and a new category dubbed “trunks to go,” including a round one based on spare-tire carriers of yore. The unusual minaudière is called La Wheel.

“They’re not just a novelty, they’re actually just the brand adapting to modern times and needs,” Knightly said of the mini trunks, made with the same exacting, hand-wrought methods as large ones.

Noticing all vintage Moynat trunks contained envelopes inside for travel documents, Knightly incorporated small, matching zippered pouches into each of his handbags and trunks to go.

“Heritage is pretty much the greatest asset of the brand. It gives authenticity, and also kind of an authority,” he said in an interview, noting that the leather corners on some bags are stitched the same way as in the 19th century. “A lot of things today are mass produced. I think this inherited savoir-faire becomes more precious and stands out even more.”

Knightly said Moynat’s modest scale and artisanal approach allow more latitude to propose unusual and special colors, compared to larger brands “that are working in a much more marketing-driven way.”

“At the top end, there’s definitely room for spontaneity and some surprises and what’s nice with a brand this size, you can speak to the smaller groups,” he said. “You can actually connect with customers that like the unusual colors and it’s much more individual, and special to them.”

Knightly’s first slate of handbags all incorporate a lock directly inspired by vintage Moynat trunks, including a medallion-shaped push style on Le Baluchon and Voyage models. “Honestly, they’re like little works of art some of them,” he enthused, noting that all locks were “reengineered so they work on soft bags.”

Even his crossbody bags like Le Flori — which give the brand a fresher, younger élan — can be found in the archive. Knightly marveled to see one featured in a Moynat ad circa 1903.

Moynat was one of the rare malletiers of the Belle Époque to be cofounded by a woman, Pauline Moynat, a merchant who teamed with the Coulembier family of artisans, and who was one of the first to set up a boutique at the foot of Avenue de l’Opera, the Champs-Élysées of its time.

Attia described Knightly as “very collaborative” in his approach, which is a big plus for a brand that puts such a premium on craftsmanship, and for one that still has something of a startup mentality.

For example, when he submits a sketch to the Moynat workshops in Aubervilliers, on the northern fringes of Paris, artisans are given free rein to interpret and to propose enhancements.

“Suddenly, everyone feels part of the adventure,” she said. “This way of working, super collaborative, helped us a lot to propose new things, to push the boundaries, to dare.”

The new ad campaign, expected to break in April, was inspired by an architectural drawing of an early Moynat factory. Knightly said it resembled a doll’s house, and plunking a life-size bag inside makes it seem almost like it’s under a magnifying glass, the quality and details in plain view.

“These images explain our point of view and they give you a context, the spirit of the whole direction,” he said. “I really think it’s important to engage with your customers and inspire them, and celebrate what you’re doing.”

Knightly also noted that Moynat employs leathers that might be considered “uncommercial” at some other brands.

“This is also part of the magic of the brand, and a lot of the customers understand these different leathers. It’s a real pleasure for the staff to explain the different characteristics, the subtleties that give each bag a completely different personality,” he explained. “It’s a sort of celebration of quality and savoir-faire. Every single person in the brand just has such high standards.”

In tandem with its new thrust, Moynat hosting launch events in Beijing on Friday and in Shanghai on March 17, to be followed later by ones in Paris, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Seoul. The roving events reflect another “untold story” at Moynat: The “caravan” approach it employed more than a century ago, when it showcased its innovations at world’s fairs and auto shows.

How LVMH grew Fred in a pandemic - Vogue Business,"Mon, 22 Mar 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZvZ3VlYnVzaW5lc3MuY29tL2NvbXBhbmllcy9ob3ctbHZtaC1ncmV3LWZyZWQtaW4tYS1wYW5kZW1pY9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"It was the first jewellery brand acquired by LVMH back in 1996. Now, Fred, founded in Paris in 1936 by Fred Samuel and best known for its Force 10 bracelet with a buckle and cable inspired by sailing, has emerged as an unexpected winner during the pandemic.

As highlighted by the blockbuster acquisition of Tiffany & Co. for $15.8 billion late last year, LVMH has major ambitions in hard luxury. With a portfolio including both Bulgari and Tiffany, LVMH is gaining ground on Richemont, owner of Cartier and Van Cleef & Arpels.

LVMH is also driving forward Fred, a considerably smaller jewellery brand but one that enjoyed growth in the “nice single digits” in 2020, according to chief executive Charles Leung. That’s quite a performance. Jewellery, albeit among the more resilient categories in luxury, was expected to plummet by 15 per cent in 2020, according to a Bain & Altagamma study published in November.

Although LVMH does not disclose numbers for its individual houses, Fred is understood to have generated around €100 million in sales in 2020, according to our sources. Overall, LVMH’s watches and jewellery division ended 2020 down 23 per cent, at €3.36 billion.

“LVMH is focusing on jewellery as a whole,” Leung says. He notes LVMH’s long-time commitment to Fred — Dominique Watine-Arnault, late sister of Bernard Arnault, was president of the brand. Despite its relatively small size, Fred has a significant role to play in a LVMH jewellery portfolio that also includes Chaumet and a majority stake in Repossi. “I think Fred is a very interesting case at LVMH for a lot of tests, to try different things,” Leung says. “Including having an Asian CEO, I guess.”"
LVMH is selling off its deadstock fabrics - Harper's Bazaar UK,"Mon, 29 Mar 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhhcnBlcnNiYXphYXIuY29tL3VrL2Zhc2hpb24vZmFzaGlvbi1uZXdzL2EzNTk2Mzk4MC9sdm1oLWRlYWRzdG9jay1mYWJyaWNzLXN1c3RhaW5hYmlsaXR5L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Luxury conglomerate LVMH - the owner of Louis Vuitton, Dior and Givenchy - is launching an online marketplace for unused fabric and leather.

The initiative is good news for designers who use discarded fabrics, known as ‘deadstock’, as a cheap alternative to high-quality materials for collections.

Such a big-name industry player shifting focus onto upcycling will go a huge way towards helping the industry become more circular and sustainable. France, the home of LVMH, is also looking into the possibility of banning brands from burning or dumping unsold clothing - which would force more brands to consider upcycling and deadstock sale as an option.

Unused fabric costs the industry $120 billion per year, according to online deadstock marketplace Queen of Raw.

“For so long this waste and unused inventory has been going on and nobody was paying attention to it,” Stephanie Benedetto, co-founder of Queen of Raw, told Business of Fashion.

“It doesn’t make sense for people and the planet, but it sure as hell doesn’t make sense for profit.”

In addition to LVMH, online marketplace is launching a collection “upcycled” from old luxury garments.

The ReCollection programme will first drop with 50 pieces that have been donated from much-loved brands like Balenciaga, Dries Van Noten and Stella McCartney.

“This is just the beginning,” Allison Summer, director of initiatives at TheRealReal, explained.

“We saw the disrupted inventory flows that resulted in even more deadstock… that is what showed us this doesn’t need to be a single collection. This should be ongoing.”

"LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton is Now the Most Valuable European Company, Per Finaria - The Fashion Law","Tue, 09 Mar 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWZhc2hpb25sYXcuY29tL2x2bWgtbW9ldC1oZW5uZXNzeS1sb3Vpcy12dWl0dG9uLWlzLW5vdy10aGUtbW9zdC12YWx1YWJsZS1ldXJvcGVhbi1jb21wYW55LXBlci1maW5hcmlhL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Louis Vuitton’s parent company LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton has taken the top spot on the list of the most valuable companies in Europe, after its market cap topped €264 billion ($312.88 billion) in late February, giving it a greater value than other giants, such as Swiss multinational food and drink processing conglomerate Nestlé S.A. (€242 billion), Swiss pharmaceutical giants Roche and Novartis, and Total SA, which is the biggest oil and gas company in France, according to a new report from financial services firm Finaria.

“Trading at around €531 ($629),” Euronext Paris-listed LVMH’s shares have surged by 40.64 percent on a year-over-year basis, according to Finaria’s calculations, and by almost 10 percent over the past three months, alone, driven, in large part, by “investor optimism.” In a recent report on LVMH, which managed to generate sales of 44.7 billion euros ($54.5 billion) for the 2020 fiscal year despite a 17 percent drop, Seeking Alpha noted that the French luxury conglomerate is trading “close to all-time highs with investors seemingly not concerned about the future of the luxury business during and after the pandemic.”

Meanwhile, Bloomberg’s Albertina Torsoli asserted early this year that while “the coronavirus pandemic is still raging throughout large parts of the world and China [was] facing a resurgence of the outbreak, investors keep pushing luxury-goods stocks” – such as those of LVMH, Hermès International, and Kering SA – higher, seemingly “undeterred by near-record valuations.” The “quality of the businesses and their substantial position in the stock market are causing some investors to compare the companies to U.S. technology behemoths,” Torsoli claimed in January, citing Blackrock European Dynamic Fund manager Giles Rothbarth, who said, “We view European luxury companies as the European stock market equivalent of U.S. tech: businesses that are unrivaled in their global dominance.”

As for the fate of the luxury titans going forward, Bernstein analyst Luca Solca noted in connection with Hermès’ full year result last month that luxury brands across the board are subject to multiple risks tied to COVID, including a potential for “a material downward correction to GDP growth and to a sharp decline in consumer demand – and possibly medium-term damage to consumer confidence and propensity to spend.” After all, Solca states, “We are on ‘terra incognita’ in terms of duration, impact and effectiveness of measures” when it comes to COVID, “as this scenario has become worse than 2008.”

He also asserted that additional “uncertainty remains regarding the plummeting oil price, upheavals in Hong Kong and the Sino- American trade confrontation. Luxury is cyclical and would suffer a triple whammy blow in a recession: 1) slower or negative top line growth would cause: 2) operating de-leverage – as luxury is a fixed cost industry,” meaning that “valuation multiples would typically contract in that environment.” And among other things that could weigh down stock prices, he notes that “luxury sales thrive on customers feeling affluent and secure in their wealth,” which means that “a higher interest rate environment would dampen asset prices and cause the richer to feel poorer: this would be a severe blow to luxury.”

Given that “asset price trends are important to support confidence of luxury consumers,” he says that “he Chinese real estate market and the U.S. stock market are the bellwethers,” while at the same time, “higher taxation of upper income brackets, higher property taxes or other government actions … would be a sector headwind.”

Still yet, another potential risk cited by at least some analysts: The chance that a return to some semblance of pre-pandemic normalcy may lead consumers to splash out on things other than luxury goods, i.e., the things they have been unable to enjoy in the midst of sweeping lockdowns and social distancing measures. So much of investors’ optimism when it comes to luxury stocks rests on the booming rebound in China, especially as brands boasted better-than-expected quarterly results in late 2020 and early this year catapulting the likes of LVMH and Hermès’ stock prices. However, some analysts are cautious, with Bloomberg, for instance, noting speculation that COVID-19 restrictions will continue to negatively impact the luxury segment this year, even among luxury-happy Chinese buyers, and ultimately, that when restrictions are lifted, consumers very well may look to spend on “travel and eating out rather than on the latest handbag.”"

AGR

Having freelanced for brands including Yeezy, A-Cold-Wall and Missoni, London designer Alicia Robinson launched her knitwear brand AGR with a party. After creating custom-knitted pieces for a group of friends to wear to the Notting Hill Carnival in 2018, she was contacted by Canadian online retailer Ssense and rolled out the collection with them.

In addition to her signature cotton striped ribs and dyed cargo pants, her fall collection featured hand-sprayed cable-knit jumpers in rainbow hues, patchwork tracksuits and puffer jackets. Robinson studied at the Chelsea College of Art in London.

BIANCA SAUNDERS

Drawing on her British and West Indian background, Bianca Saunders is not afraid to explore the more vulnerable side of men. Her fall collection was influenced by photographer Man Ray, and stretched fabric imagery by Erwin Wurm, and featured her second collaboration with Wrangler.

“My main aim for the brand was to create that balance. You get the really over-masculine guy and effeminate guy existing in the same world. Even the pieces can be seen as slightly more feminine. I think this is how I create the energy that brings something different, and more things to the men’s wear conversation,” the Royal College of Art graduate told WWD recently.

CHARLES DE VILMORIN

Since launching his brand in April 2020 in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic, Charles de Vilmorin has enjoyed a meteoric rise, making his debut at Paris Couture Week in January, and subsequently being named creative director of French fashion house Rochas.

Known for his colorful paintings tinged with darkness, the French designer has made a splash with quilted bomber jackets and sculptural hourglass dresses inspired by the work of artist Niki de Saint Phalle. In line with his genderless aesthetic, he frequently uses makeup and body painting to transform models into avatars for the fantastical creatures he draws.

CHRISTOPHER JOHN ROGERS

The winner of last year’s CFDA American Emerging Designer of the Year award, Christopher John Rogers is best known for dressing celebrities like Cardi B, Rihanna and Lizzo in his colorful creations on the red carpet, although he is equally comfortable designing daywear, such as the purple coat U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris wore on Inauguration Day.

His spring 2021 collection marked his first foray into knitwear, including a rainbow knit dress with target-like concentric circles at the breasts that was featured on the cover of the April edition of British Vogue.

CONNER IVES

American-born designer Conner Ives started garnering attention even before finishing his design degree at Central Saint Martins, after sharing his designs on Instagram and scoring commissions from the likes of Adwoa Aboah, who wore one of his creations to the Met Gala in 2017.

He has produced two capsule collections for British retailer Browns using vintage T-shirts sourced at charity shops, and was part of the design team that launched Rihanna’s since-paused clothing label Fenty. “I always look at American sportswear,” he told WWD in 2018. “I love a humble piece of clothing, I think there’s something really honest about that and the idea that it comes from something preexistent.”

FEDERICO CINA

Federico Cina founded his genderless label in 2019 with the ambition of bringing his brand of romance to the world of tailoring. After studying at Polimoda in Florence, he got a fashion design master’s degree in Osaka, Japan, worked at Brooks Brothers between Italy and New York, and then at Emilio Pucci in Milan.

The Italian designer uses experimental techniques, like turning garments inside out, and sprinkles in cultural references, such as prints inspired by typical tablecloths from his native region of Romagna. For his fall 2021 collection, he reworked tailoring staples with a soft hand and a delicate spirit, showing chic padded blazers and deconstructed field jackets crafted in suiting fabrics, alongside pleated pants cut in generous silhouettes.

KIDSUPER

Brooklyn-based Colm Dillane’s artist collective KidSuper burst onto the Paris scene in July when he made his virtual debut at Paris Men’s Fashion Week with a stop-motion short film made using modified Barbie dolls dressed in miniature versions of his streetwear designs (he even had dolls in the likeness of the Obamas and Queen Elizabeth II in his front row.)

“I was selling T-shirts in a high school cafeteria, then on an ironing board on the street in SoHo, then turned my college dorm room into a store, then moved into a store front with all my friends, then f–ing Paris fashion week,” the designer wrote on his YouTube channel. A collaboration with Puma rapidly followed, and Dillane’s wide-ranging plans include making a film and building a soccer field.

KIKA VARGAS

After studying art at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago and fashion at Istituto Marangoni in Milan, Bogotá-born Kika Vargas worked for Missoni before launching her namesake collection in 2011. Her outfits are made in Colombia, with signature silhouettes including voluminous midi dresses with oversized puff sleeves and romantic ruffles, alongside playful printed co-ords.

Vargas was among the designers selected for Bergdorf Goodman’s BG Radar platform for emerging talent last year, and the brand is also carried by retailers including Matchesfashion.com, Harrods, Nordstrom, Browns and Ssense.

LAGOS SPACE PROGRAMME

As a nonbinary, queer, Yoruba and Black designer, Nigeria-born Adeju Thompson, who goes by the pronouns they/them, conceived Lagos Space Programme as a project-based fashion brand. The fall collection, shown during Milan Men’s Fashion Week in January, was about breaking the rules of normative fashion.

“It really starts with me creating clothes I want to wear. It’s also very important for me to do this via the cultural lens,” Thompson told WWD. The line combines traditional dressing with a contemporary sensibility: floor-length wrap skirts paired with shredded knit vests and deconstructed blazers, or voluminous Bermuda pants layered over apron-style elongated tops with unfinished hems.

LUKHANYO MDINGI

Established in 2015, the Lukhanyo Mdingi women’s and men’s wear brand blends sartorial elegance with artisanal craft. “Our intention is to simply create a body of work that has a sense of soulfulness to it, work that is of substance that is strong and that is solid — something for the forever,” the brand says on its website.

The South African designer has shown at New York Fashion Week and as part of the Pitti Uomo trade show. His latest collection is a tribute to his friend Nicholas Coutts, who died in 2019, incorporating the late designer’s signature handwoven techniques.

MIDORIKAWA OFFICIAL

A graduate of Bunka Fashion College in Tokyo, Taku Midorikawa launched his genderless brand Midorikawa in 2017, melding traditional Japanese techniques and skillful craftsmanship in his striking constructions, frequently accented with raw hems.

The label is distributed mainly in Japan, with stockists including Dover Street Market Ginza, United Arrows & Sons, and department store Isetan in Tokyo’s Shinjuku district.

NENSI DOJAKA

An Albanian women’s wear designer based in London, Nensi Dojaka graduated from Central Saint Martins in 2019. After showcasing her graduate collection, she created a capsule collection with Ssense and was selected to show as part of emerging designer support platform Fashion East.

Dojaka was selected for the first edition of the mentorship program launched last fall by No.21 founder and designer Alessandro Dell’Acqua and Tomorrow London. Her spring collection featured lingerie-inspired slipdresses with graphic cutouts and sensual strap details that have caught the eye of fashion editor Carine Roitfeld, among others.

POST ARCHIVE FACTION

Having studied industrial and spatial design, Dongjoon Lim started out as a user experience designer for fashion companies. Having become a self-trained men’s wear designer, he cofounded Post Archive Faction with Sookyo Jeong in 2018, specializing in avant-garde sportswear and futuristic outerwear.

The brand recently staged an exhibition at Seoul’s Arario Gallery that blurs the distinctions between art, fashion, furniture and design.

RENAISSANCE RENAISSANCE

Cynthia Merhej returned to her native Beirut in 2016 to found Renaissance Renaissance, her women’s wear brand, after studying at the Royal College of Art and Central Saint Martins in London. She is the third of a generation of women to begin her own atelier, following in the footsteps of her great-grandmother and mother.

Characterized by ruching, ruffles and daring volumes, her clothes have a romantic sensibility, drawing on inspirations from Ottoman clothing and her native Beirut, whose purse-shaped bread sold as street food directly inspired her Ka’ak bag.

RIER

Created by Andreas Steiner, Rier offers timeless unisex pieces inspired by his roots in the South Tyrol. The 36-year-old designer studied in Milan and Paris and worked for Prada, Miu Miu and Louis Vuitton before striking out on his own.

A recent lineup featured a range of designs with a miniature floral repeat embroidery inspired by one worn by the men of his village. Steiner blends a raw, minimal aesthetic with a mountain spirit.

RUI

Rui Zhou dressed Dua Lipa for the cover of Rolling Stone; she looks like she was paint bombed with fabric, for Zhou’s intricate, web-like bodysuits and dresses bare as much as they cover. Small knit segments are stretched out and tethered with beads, creating unique geometries of fabric and flesh.

Based in Shanghai, the 27-year-old designer graduated in 2018 from Parsons MFA Fashion Design and Society program. She was a semifinalist for an H&M competition in 2017.

SAUL NASH

A professional choreographer from northeast London, Nash has been developing a unique way of cutting based on body movement. He graduated with a BA in Performance Design from Central Saint Martins in 2015 and attended the MA in men’s wear at the Royal College of Art in 2018.

His clothes fall somewhere between luxury, activewear and streetwear, and are produced as limited-edition styles.

SHUTING QIU

While based in Shanghai, Shuting Qiu graduated from the Royal Academy in Antwerp, and her free-spirited fashions skew closest to the more extroverted members of the original Antwerp Six, Dries Van Noten and Walter Van Beirendonck, with her colorful clash of prints and bold shapes.

Her heroines include Virginia Woolf and Pina Bausch. Qiu won the Special Prize at the BIG Design Award Japan, and was a finalist of the H&M Design Award.

TAAKK

Takuya Morikawa, 39, made his official debut on the Paris schedule in January, showing a fall men’s wear collection incorporating blurred, moody prints and creative tailoring.

The Japanese designer taught himself how to make clothes in high school and went on to study design at Bunka Fashion College. He spent time at Issey Miyake before launching his brand Taakk, and puts an emphasis on fabric development.

WED

Wed is the London-based women’s wear brand founded in 2019 by designers Amy Trinh and Evan Phillips, both 30-year-old Central Saint Martins graduates. The duo’s brand of custom-made Surrealist bridalwear and eveningwear is known for innovative draping, historical references and sustainable practices.

The designers employ deadstock textiles and repurpose forgotten, vintage or heirloom dresses into new creations."

According to the report, the champagne brand — affectionately known as Ace of Spades — is valued over $100 million USD more than what Hov rapped on the Meek Mill collab “What’s Free.” With the $630 million USD estimate, JAY-Z would have received a minimum of $315 million USD in cash payment.

“The multiples for Armand de Brignac—based on the category and volume size of the brand—far outreach brands that don’t have that celebrity ownership,” beverage market analyst Eric Schmidt said.

LVMH acquired 50 percent of Armand de Brignac through its Moët Hennessy wines and spirits division in late February 2021. The details of the deal were not specified, but a statement mentioned that it reflected “a shared vision between Moët Hennessy and Shawn JAY-Z Carter for the future of this iconic Maison.”

“It is a partnership that has felt familiar the entire time,” JAY-Z’s said in his own announcement. “We are confident that the sheer power of the Moët Hennessy global distribution framework, its unparalleled portfolio strength and its long-established track record of excellence in developing luxury brands will give Armand de Brignac the commercial power it needs to grow and flourish even further.”

"Bono's EDUN Brand, LVMH Accused of Racial Discrimination in Recently-Transferred Lawsuit - The Fashion Law","Fri, 12 Mar 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWZhc2hpb25sYXcuY29tL2x2bWgtYm9ub3MtZWR1bi1icmFuZC1hY2N1c2VkLW9mLXJhY2lhbC1kaXNjcmltaW5hdGlvbi1pbi1yZWNlbnRseS10cmFuc2ZlcnJlZC1sYXdzdWl0L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"A $2 million-plus lawsuit accusing EDUN and LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton of racial discrimination and retaliation has landed before the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. The case got its start early this year when former EDUN-Americas sales associate Indigo Brunton filed suit against the now-defunct Ali Hewson and Bono-founded fashion brand and its former minority stakeholder LVMH in a New York state court alleging that during her several-month tenure with the made-in-Africa fashion brand, she faced “race discrimination that resulted, ultimately, in her constructive termination from [EDUN].”

In her January 4 complaint, Brunton, a Black female, asserts that she started working at EDUN’s retail store in January 2018, and almost from the outset was subjected to the “constant … racially offensive and derogatory comments” that EDUN sales advisor Angele Laroq made “to [her], about [her], about customers, and about Black people in general.” Brunton claims that much to her “shock and disgust,” Laroq – who held herself out as Brunton’s supervisor (but was later revealed to be a fellow sales associate) – “repeatedly referenced the N word, referred to Black people as ‘Ghetto,’ accused Black people of ‘trying to act Afro-centric,’ criticized Black people stereotypically, and perpetuated Black stereotypes.”

Despite advising Laroq that “she was uncomfortable with the racially hostile atmosphere and ask[ing] her to stop making racially charged comments,” Brunton claims that Laroq “continued to harass [her] by subjecting her to a racially hostile work environment,” which prompted Brunton to report the alleged discrimination to EDUN manager Sabrina Realas “when she came to the store on February 9, 2018.” While Realas thanked Brunton for confiding in her about Laroq’s behavior and offering to do “anything I can” to help, Brunton alleges that EDUN “failed to implement an investigation” and “did nothing in response to [her] reports of race discrimination,” causing the “race based hostile work environment perpetuated by Laroq [to] continue unabated.”

“Surprised at having not received any follow up to her complaints of discrimination,” Brunton asserts that she raised the issue again in a February 20, 2018 performance review with Realas and EDUN CEO Julian Labat, the latter of whom is named as a defendant. During that performance review (in which she claims that she was informed that “she had brought the store to a ‘new level’ and that there was a noticeable increase in sales”), Brunton alleges that Realas and Labat advised her that “avoiding conversations with Laroq would ‘allow their professional relationship to become amicable.’” More than that, Brunton alleges that Labat told her that “if she did not ‘make things work’ then they would have to ‘discuss’ her leaving [EDUN].”

Having left the performance review without a solution, Brunton claims that several days later, she “again reported the retaliation and discrimination to Realas and asked for assistance in dealing with the uncomfortable and hostile work environment.” Realas told Brunton on March 5 that the company was “reviewing [the matter] very closely and ask that [you] give us some time to address it accordingly,” per Brunton, when claims that Labat echoed this in an email a few days later, telling her that because EDUN did not “have an internal HR department, the investigation is going to be managed by Rachel Cohen, HR Manager at Fendi Americas.”

Brunton claims that while she “was hopeful that the matter would be addressed and resolved,” she was also “concerned about Labat, as she had heard from other employees that he regularly made racially hostile comments such as ‘Black models can’t sell clothes,’ that he had refused to respond to complaints that models were being sexually harassed by the defendants’ financial controller, and that he had made racist comments that caused other employees to quit.”

After meeting with Cohen in mid-March to discuss her complaint, Brunton says that she met with Cohen and Labat a week later, at which point Labat revealed “that they had worked with an attorney from LVMH, and the investigation was ‘complete.’” He alerted Brunton that they “found no incidents of racism or harassment,” and allegedly “explained in a demeaning and clearly annoyed tone that [Brunton] was ‘confused about things’ and informed her that ‘the situation [between herself and Laroq] was caused by a lack of clarity.’” Brunton claims that she was “dumbfounded” by Labat’s remarks and by the fact that they had “decided to promote Laroq because of the great job she is doing.” (Brunton claims that she later learned that “no investigation into her report of discrimination had been conducted and no witnesses were interviewed.”)

During the same meeting, Brunton contends that she informed Cohen and Labat that “she could no longer work there if Laroq was her boss,” allegedly prompting Labat to warn her, “You better watch out. You better be careful.”

The aforementioned “hostile work environment, disparate treatment, and an atmosphere of adverse employment actions and decisions culminated in [her] constructive discharge because of her race and ethnicity in violation of [her] statutory and constitutional rights,” Brunton claims. Moreover, she argues that the defendants, “unlawfully and without cause, retaliated against [her] as a direct result of [her] complaining about the incidents of race and ethnicity discrimination and a hostile work environment.” And still yet, “because she protested the defendants’ unlawful behavior,” Brunton claims that she “was subjected to retaliation throughout the course of her employment,” and that such alleged retaliation “substantially interfered with [her] employment and created an intimidating, offensive, and hostile work environment.”

With the foregoing in mind, Brunton sets forth claims of race discrimination, racially hostile work environment, and retaliation in violation of 42 U.S.C. § 1981, the New York State Human Rights Law and the New York City Human Rights Law against EDUN and LVMH, and is seeking damages “no less than” $2,000,000 in connection with her causes of action. As for why, EDUN’s since-divested minority shareholder LVMH is named as a defendant when EDUN is Brunton’s former employer, chances are, it is a strategic move to target the deeper-pocketed party, and one that is still in operation.

Since Brunton filed suit, LVMH has successfully sought to remove the case from the Supreme Court of the State of New York to a New York federal court on the basis that her “first cause of action for race discrimination and her second cause of action for retaliation are both brought pursuant to the Civil Rights Act of 1866,” a federal statute, and that her other state law claims “are substantially related to, and arise out of the same nucleus of operative facts as, Plaintiff’s claim under the Civil Rights Act of 1866 such that they should all be tried in one action.” The case was transferred to the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York on March 8.

Edun-Americas made headlines in June 2018 when it was revealed that LVMH had divested itself of its 49 percent stake in EDUN, and the brand had decided to formally shutter its U.S. operations. It appears that the brand has since discontinued all operations both in and outside of the U.S.

Why I Won't Ever Wear Birkenstock Sandals - Slide Sandals That Are Not Birkenstocks - Town & Country,"Fri, 05 Mar 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRvd25hbmRjb3VudHJ5bWFnLmNvbS9zdHlsZS9mYXNoaW9uLXRyZW5kcy9hMzU3MDE2MDcvYmlya2Vuc3RvY2tzLWx2bWgtZGVhbC0yMDIxL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Every item on this page was chosen by a Town & Country editor. We may earn commission on some of the items you choose to buy.

In many ways it was inevitable. Sheltered at home with no reason to leave, save for an afternoon walk and maybe the occasional alfresco meet-up with friends, of course function would rule out over form. It was out with the high heels, the handbags (though their absence was short-lived), anything that zips. In with the canvas totes, the sweats, the Birkenstocks.

I will happily succumb to athleisure. But Birkenstocks? I will never be caught dead in them. (Confession: I did buy a pair in high school, wore them once, realized the terrible mistake I had made, and never put them on again.)

Obviously, the popularity of Birkenstocks isn't a novel concept, or even unique to the pandemic, though its circumstances have certainly contributed to their resurgence. They are nothing if not perseverant, a fact that doesn't bode well for haters like me (the family-owned company is older than America—Birkenstock was founded in 1774).

For years I have passively watched, with mild annoyance, at the sandals' constant emergence and ubiquity. After their omnipresence last year, I was hoping that by summer 2021 the trend would return to hibernation once more, what with vaccine news being so promising and the general feeling—confirmed by the recent Fall 2021 shows—that perhaps it's time for us all to put a bit of effort into dressing up again.

Rachpoot/MEGA // Getty Images Models like Kaia Gerber (pictured) and Kendall Jenner have unfortunately validated pairing Birkenstock sandals with socks.

But alas, recent news suggest otherwise. First came the ""Birkinstock,"" an ironic statement on collaboration culture by a Brooklyn-based collective known as MSCHF. They had cut up Birkin bags and used the scraps to strap up Birkenstock soles. Neither brand participated in the creation of the resulting shoes, which come with a $76,000 price tag. MSCHF is no stranger to such gimmicks veiled as social commentary: in 2019 they created the ""Jesus Shoes,"" Nike Air Max sneakers filled with holy water that retailed for $1,425 and ballooned up to $4,000 on the resale market.

Then, Birkenstock announced that it had sold a majority stake to a private equity firm backed by LVMH, valuing the company at $4.85 billion. Even LVMH's billionaire boss Bernard Arnault and his family investment fund were getting in on the deal. In other words, on top of already having been validated by A-list celebrities and the fashion milieu—not to mention the clout afforded by its collaborations with the likes of Valentino, Proenza Schouler, and Rick Owens—Birkenstock had been officially legitimized by the largest and most powerful arbiter of luxury consumption in the world. The upside for LVMH? Appealing to a broader, younger audience. But is it actually good investment? According to one financial analyst, not really. ""It's a seasonal brand, meaning sales potential is limited to half of the year,"" he says. ""It caters to such a niche, specific target—its total addressable market is too small.""

All this is to say that not even a conglomerate like LVMH can turn me around to Birkenstocks. They are unattractive, unflattering, and take the laissez-faire approach just one step too far, veering into laziness. Why bookend a perfectly put-together outfit with a pair of clunky, brown shoes? If it's the ease of a slip-on you're after, why not a pair of Hermès Oran sandals? Or even Jack Rogers, a la Jackie?

Vittoriano Rastelli // Getty Images Jackie Kennedy (in Jack Rogers sandals) and Marella Agnelli on the Amalfi Coast, 1962. Would either style icon have ever worn Birkenstocks?

Well, they are really comfortable, the zealots will declare, and I have no grounds for objection there. For nearly 250 years the company's mission statement has been to create shoes with adequate support using their signature quadruple layer footbed of jute, cork, and suede. But I'm someone who can walk for miles in my minimalist Canfora sandals—maybe this will add up to some karmic orthopedic reckoning later in life but when that time comes, I will resort to more visually savory options.

They have a democratic appeal, might be another argument. That is relatively true. Birkenstocks do not discriminate—they are a beacon of liberalism, for better or worse (see: Howard Dean and his ""Birkenstock liberals""), accessible for everyone from Bernie supporters to the Kardashians. But with a starting price point of $100, can they really be considered the everyman's shoe? (The Valentino collaboration will set you back $510.)

At the end of the day, my strong objection to Birkenstocks is simply stylistic. And this is really all a very meandering way of saying: how about skipping the Birks in favor of these instead?"

Philippe Schaus, CEO of Moet Hennessy, is also on the call, and we’re chatting about everything from bubbly to bitcoin to Jay-Z’s friendship with Jack Dorsey, CEO of Square

I’ve got a million and one questions for Jay-Z, but strangely enough, none of them are about music.

While celebrity is not all bad … it has to be – like everything else in the world – balanced Jay-Z

It’s no longer a hard knock life for hip-hop’s first billionaire, who has confirmed lucrative deals in February and March with two major companies. In addition to selling 50 per cent of his champagne brand to LVMH, Jay-Z sold a majority stake of Tidal to Square. In the span of mere weeks, Jay-Z’s net worth has jumped 40 per cent up to US$1.4 billion.

It would have been understandable for the 51-year-old rapper and businessman, born Shawn Corey Carter, to be high on his recent success, but Jay-Z is remarkably modest about it all, and he’s keen to credit the people with whom he has been collaborating.

“I’m very fortunate. Jack Dorsey, who created Twitter, Square and Cash App, and Philippe [Schaus] and the guys who created LVMH – you couldn’t ask for better partners; they’re the top of the top,” he says. “[Things] usually align like that when people do really great things. You could get into partnerships and people short-change the business for different reasons. These guys don’t cut corners, they try to get it right. It’s about respect.”

The mutual respect is certainly palpable between Schaus and Jay-Z on the call, and it’s clear that a genuine liking has developed between the two businessmen. The two have had “beautiful conversations and beautiful food” over the course of their discussions, paired, of course, with Armand de Brignac.

Jay-Z’s champagne brand, also known as Ace of Spades, sold more than half a million bottles in 2019, not a bad feat for a company launched in 2006, a relative newcomer in a world steeped in centuries-old tradition and maisons.

“We ran this brand from the office with eight or nine people, a really small, scrappy group,” Jay-Z says. “We became very successful and we’ve always looked at LVMH as the pinnacle of what we represent, a group that creates things based on their love of luxury, of getting the details perfectly correct. If I’m going to be in a partnership, especially with a brand that’s so successful, it has to enhance the brand, it can’t hinder it.”

For Moet Hennessy’s part, the champagne’s quality speaks for itself, and the CEO also embraces the thought of two very different traditions and cultures working together.

“There are many players in the world of champagne, but there has been one player which has been standing out in past years, and that has been Armand de Brignac,” he says. “They got very nice marks for their Brut Gold, Blanc de Blancs and Blanc de Noirs, for example. It’s a good product, at a nice price with a very distinguishable bottle, but what we also realised was that the way the team was doing the marketing of the brand was very different from what we had been doing for hundreds of years.”

It would be a safe assumption that this particular marketing strategy would be one that relied heavily on Jay-Z’s fame and popularity, and while that has certainly played its part, the rapper is keen to emphasise that it takes more than fame for people to fall crazy in love with his product.

“This isn’t a celebrity brand, it’s a luxury brand. It’s a brand to be taken seriously and it’s not a rapper’s brand. [There was an element of] fighting against that, the weight of your own celebrity,” he says. “While celebrity is not all bad, in that it can bring a new customer to something they otherwise [wouldn’t have experienced], it has to be – like everything else in the world – balanced.”

Schaus also points out that the brand is playing a key role in helping the world of champagne better reach a wider demographic than before. “Armand de Brignac has a culture, an entire world that’s relevant to my kids, they know that culture,” he emphasises. “Being able to take over that and to leverage it even more is what’s going to make this a huge success.”

Jay-Z likens the meeting of cultures to the evolution that happened to the art world through hip-hop, saying that “when these cross-sections happen, culture happens – and that’s when beautiful things get birthed”.

“Just like with hip-hop and graffiti, for example, we took it outside the art galleries, and people were upset, but we were expressing ourselves. We’ve seen it time and time again, that when two worlds respect each other and what each individual or group brings to the table, it can be a beautiful thing,” he explains. “There are things that we’ve done that are not typically by the books. And you can look at that in two ways – you can look down on it, or you can say, ‘Wait, that’s interesting.’”

This sort of market disruption is nothing new to Jay-Z, and his partnership with Dorsey is testament to that. In addition to the sale of Tidal to Square, he and Dorsey have also set up a fund to develop bitcoin, the details of which he is reluctant to divulge at the moment.

“I don’t want to jump the announcement because Jack and I want to introduce this in a proper way and let people really understand,” he says, before expanding on the world’s changing attitude towards cryptocurrency. “We’re all creatures of habit. There was a time when we all looked at the internet and said, ‘there’s not a chance I’m going to put my credit card on that thing’. We’re all afraid of change, but I think that we are best served as human beings to always keep ourselves open to all possibilities. For me, my belief is in anything that offers more democracy to the people. I want to take a look at anything that allows people, small business owners, to participate in the growing economy without having to go through hoops.”

This sentiment is unsurprising to those familiar with Jay-Z’s cannabis line, Monogram, which launched last December. The company, in addition to selling marijuana as well as luxury weed cigars, also launched a new campaign speaking out against cannabis law and what it means for business entrepreneurs. Its parent company, aptly named The Parent Company, will also identify, fund and nurture the next generation of cannabis leaders.

When these cross-sections happen, culture happens – and that’s when beautiful things get birthed Jay-Z

“In the US in particular, the home of the free, land of the brave – all these ideals that we present as catchy phrases are just not true for a lot of people. And if I can use my position to [level] the playing field, I’m more than happy to, because this is the path that I took,” he says. “I’m from Brooklyn, I’ve been through some tough times. There have been days where I didn’t know how I was going to get to tomorrow, and it’s OK if you take everything that has happened in life as something that has happened for you, as opposed to happening to you.”

His philosophy on equality and opportunity extend to more social and political matters, most notably #BlackLivesMatter – to which he has donated US$1.5 million with Beyoncé and launched a campaign to honour George Floyd – and the recent #StopTheHate movement that targets anti-Asian hate crimes worldwide.

“We as the human race have not advanced past looking at each other based on the colour of our skin. We as a society would benefit from appreciation of life, respect for one another having conversations with one another, to really understand the plight of every individual,” he says. “Part of my mission is to [encourage] more inclusivity for everyone. We’re not here for a long time, we have to figure it out.”

The rapper has led by example, seeking out visionaries whom he values for their innovation and leadership, rather than by background or skin colour.

“I look at the make-up of individuals or a group and say, ‘Hey, wow, that’d be a cool group to hang out with” … It’s a certain decorum that they have, a certain way that they carry themselves and their business, [with] high integrity and passion for what they do,” he says. “I just want to be surrounded by great people.”

That’s certainly what has happened for the billionaire over the years. Jay-Z has leveraged his contacts and business acumen to create a vast array of opportunities to which a more complacent man would not be privy. With his recent deals still fresh in our minds, not to mention an announcement with Dorsey coming up, it wouldn’t be surprising to see Jay-Z continue to dominate headlines in the future for ventures and collaborations that reach far beyond the music industry.

He might have 99 problems but a pitch ain’t one.

"JAY-Z's net worth increases by 40 percent following LVMH and Square, Inc. deals - REVOLT","Tue, 09 Mar 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldm9sdC50di9hcnRpY2xlLzIwMjEtMDMtMDkvMTAwMjk5L2pheS16cy1uZXQtd29ydGgtaW5jcmVhc2VzLWJ5LTQwLXBlcmNlbnQtZm9sbG93aW5nLWx2bWgtYW5kLXNxdWFyZS1pbmMtZGVhbHPSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"JAY-Z’s money-making moves have increased his net worth by 40 percent. According to Forbes, the businessman is now worth $1.4 billion following his recently-announced deals with Square, Inc. and LVMH.

In late February, JAY sold 50 percent of his Armand de Brignac champagne to Moët Hennessy. Forbes valued the brand at approximately $640 million, meaning the Roc Nation mogul earned $320 million from the move.

Days later, the Brooklyn entrepreneur returned to Twitter to announce his partnership with the platform’s cofounder, Jack Dorsey, revealing he sold a majority of TIDAL to Dorsey’s Square, Inc. for a combination of cash and $297 million worth of stock.

Per the terms of the agreement, JAY will continue to serve as a board member at TIDAL, which will now operate alongside Cash App and Seller. He will also join Square’s Board of Directors.

Since getting his start in music, JAY has grown into quite the businessman, expanding into the technology, cognac, fashion and art sectors to name a few. In addition to his lucrative deals with Square and LVMH, Forbes reported that the “Show Me What You Got” emcee earned $140 million USD from his Roc Nation imprint, $120 million USD from his D’Usse cognac brand and $95 million USD from his 300 song-music catalog, for which he owns both the publishing rights and master recordings.

Additonally, JAY’s art collection — which features works by Damian Hirst, David Hammons and Richard Prince — is valued at $70 million USD. The rapper also owns about $50 million USD worth of real estate property and has $425 million USD in cash and investments, including stakes in Uber, Sweetgreen, Ethos and SpaceX.

Though hip hop’s first billionaire already surpassed $1 billion in net worth, the emcee isn’t solely focused on making money. JAY spends a lot of time working to help the Black community via his REFORM Alliance and multiple charitable efforts."

Giovanni Zoppas to Exit LVMH and Marcolin's Joint Venture Thélios - WWD,"Mon, 29 Mar 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd3dkLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy1uZXdzL2h1bWFuLXJlc291cmNlcy9naW92YW5uaS16b3BwYXMtZXhpdC10aGVsaW9zLWx2bWgtbWFyY29saW4tanYtdGVjbmljYS1ncm91cC0xMjM0Nzg5NDkzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"MILAN — Giovanni Zoppas is to exit as chief executive officer of Italian eyewear manufacturer Thélios, a venture between LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, which has a 51 percent stake, and storied Italian eyewear maker Marcolin Group.

Effective in May, Zoppas will be the new CEO and general manager of Tecnica Group, which specializes in outdoor footwear and ski equipment. There he will take over the role previously held on an interim basis by the company’s chairman Alberto Zanatta. Former CEO Antonio Dus exited the firm in December.

Reached for comment on Monday, Thélios said Zoppas will leave at the end of April and that a successor will be named in the coming weeks.

Zoppas’ appointment marks a return for the executive to Tecnica, where he served as general manager of Nordica — one of the brands in the company’s portfolio — from 2003 to 2006. Zoppas is also a member of the firm’s board.

In a statement, Zoppos said he has “always been extremely fond of the group,” keeping “close ties with it after my time at Nordica” and that he shares “Zanatta’s vision of the future objectives and ambitious goals we can achieve, both in terms of business and organizational and managerial solidity.”

Zanatta in the same statement described Zoppas as “a consummate professional who brings with him experience with major international groups and knowledge of our business and local area” and said he expects these qualities to drive the company’s growth and enable it “to embrace new business opportunities and maintain its leadership position in the outdoor footwear and ski equipment sector.”

Founded in 1960 by the Zanatta family, Tecnica is based in Giavera del Montello near Treviso, Italy, and counts 3,150 employees. In 2020, the company had a turnover of 382 million euros, down 9.8 percent compared to 2019.

Along with Nordica and the namesake Tecnica outdoor shoe and ski boot brand, the group’s portfolio includes a range of specialized labels, such as Moon Boot, Blizzard, Lowa and Rollerblade.

In 2017, Italmobiliare SpA, the investment group owned by the Pesenti family, acquired a 40 percent stake in the company for 60 million euros.

A graduate in political economics from Milan’s Bocconi School of Economics, Zoppas was appointed CEO of Thélios in 2017. While the concept of the joint venture between LVMH and Marcolin originated in 2016, the company became operational in 2018. Zoppas oversaw the development of the eyewear specialist, which since its inception has grown to produce and distribute eyewear collections for Celine; Loewe; Kenzo; Fenty; Fred; Berluti; Rimowa and, more recently, Dior and Stella McCartney. As reported, Thélios also unveiled a brand for men called 9.81, a reference to the universal constant of gravity (9.81 Newtons).

At the company, Zoppas relied on years of experience in the sector, as he was previously CEO of Marcolin from 2012 to 2017. Prior to that, other professional experience included not only the one at Nordica but also posts at Benetton Group as well as at Coin Group, where he was chief financial officer and CEO."
Here's how much money JAY-Z reportedly made from his massive Ace of Spades sale - REVOLT,"Wed, 03 Mar 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldm9sdC50di9hcnRpY2xlLzIwMjEtMDMtMDMvNTg1OTIvaGVyZXMtaG93LW11Y2gtbW9uZXktamF5LXotcmVwb3J0ZWRseS1tYWRlLWZyb20taGlzLW1hc3NpdmUtYWNlLW9mLXNwYWRlcy1zYWxl0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Last week, JAY-Z made headlines for his massive Ace of Spades sale to LVMH. The billionaire rapper sold a 50 percent stake in his champagne brand to LVMH’s spirit and wine division Moët Hennessy, making him the latest music mogul to partner with the luxury conglomerate.

At the time, details surrounding JAY’s sale to LVMH were undisclosed. Now, financial estimates have been reported to reveal how much money Hov made from the mega-sale.

According to Forbes, the deal valued JAY’s champagne brand, Armand de Brignac, at over $600 million. Forbes specifically valued the brand at roughly $630 million. This means that with the 50 percent stake sale, JAY raked in at least $315 million from the deal.

Speaking with Yahoo! Finance, JAY said the sale would take Armand de Brignac to “the next level of taste and distribution.”

“We want the brand to outlast all of us… We don’t cut corners or lean on fame to sell the product,” he continued. “We’ve built it through passion and integrity.”

On CNBC’s “Squawk Box,” Hov added that he and LVMH began discussing the potential partnership back in 2019.

“It just started out in a place of respect and built from there pretty quickly,” he explained.

With LVMH taking over the distribution of the champagne, Moët Hennessy CEO Philippe Schaus said the partnership would take the brand “to new heights across the world.”

“What we could bring to the brand, which is already very successful, is the sheer power of our international distribution network,” he added on “Squawk Box.”

Forbes reports that the new valuation of Ace of Spades more than doubled before the sale.

“The multiples for Armand de Brignac — based on the category and volume size of the brand — far outreach brands that don’t have that celebrity ownership,” beverage market analyst Eric Schmidt told the outlet.

“With celebrity association, particularly in the earlier years, the valuation of a company could be higher by three to seven times,” food and beverage marketing consultant Arthur Gallego added. “But I don’t think it works for every celebrity. There’s got to be something authentic about it.”

Forbes also compared JAY’s LVMH deal to sales made by Dr. Dre and Rihanna. In 2014, Dre sold his audio product company Beats to Apple for $3 billion and walked away with $585 million before taxes. In 2017, Rihanna also struck a deal with LVMH to launch Fenty Beauty and later Savage X Fenty, both of which she owns a $530 million stake in."

The 15 largest listed fashion companies are lagging behind when it comes to meeting the social and environmental targets of the Paris climate agreement and UN Sustainable Development Goals, a new report by the Business of Fashion said on Monday.The Business of Fashion, an online publication about the fashion industry , analysed in its report publicly disclosed information from the five biggest companies by revenue in three categories - luxury, sportswear, and high street fashion, including Kering Adidas , H&M and others.The fashion industry is under increasing pressure from consumers and governments to clean up its act. Statistics cited by the World Economic Forum show that the industry is responsible for at least 4% of global greenhouse gas emissions.The Business of Fashion's report scored companies out of 100 in their progress towards meeting sixteen targets which would align their performance with the UN Sustainable Development Goals and Paris Agreement on emissions, waste, workers' rights, water, and materials.It also ranked the companies on transparency, or how much information about a company's practices was currently available.Kering ranked top with 49 points and Under Armour ranked lowest at 9 points. The average score for the companies was 36 points.The report found the companies were more likely to disclose information on targets than concrete actions towards fulfilling them.""Opaque working practices and fuzzy definitions of what constitutes 'good' progress complicate matters further, creating a woolly picture of where the industry is at and what steps are required for it to clean up its act,"" the report said.Kering and Nike performed best on transparency, while PVH Corp, Levi Strauss, and VF Corp ranked highest on their efforts to reduce emissions.Under Armour scored lowest on all rankings except workers' rights, where LVMH ranked one point lower.Scores for Hermes, LVMH and Richemont averaged lower than high street fashion companies H&M, Inditex, Gap and Levi Strauss across the six categories - emissions, waste, workers' rights, materials and transparency.On average overall, the companies performed worst on waste and workers' rights. Uniqlo owner Fast Retailing, Under Armour and Richemont reported the lowest average score across the six targets.Kering sustainability chief Marie-Claire Daveu said the company was proud of the recognition given by Business of Fashion. Asked about the fact that the report highlighted all companies were falling short of targets, she recognised that sustainability was a ""long, never-ending journey.""Adidas said it was working closely with its partners to achieve climate neutrality in its operations by 2025 and throughout its supply chains by 2050.Other companies cited did not immediately respond to a request for comment.A panel of twelve sustainability experts advised on the methodology for the Business of Fashion's report."

Suddenly sturdy and sensible footwear is stealing all the headlines — and stoking investor interest.

On Friday, private equity giant L Catterton and family holding Financière Agache, investment vehicles backed by LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton and luxury titan Bernard Arnault and his family respectively, acquired a majority stake in Birkenstock, with plans to expand in Asia, open more stores and ramp up e-commerce.

The deal followed a bumper initial public offering last month for Dr. Martens, and amid a sale process for Reebok, currently owned by Adidas.

Even Scholl, maker of modest wooden sandals and comfy clogs, is about to relaunch in Europe and beyond.

“Private equity is interested in casual footwear,” said Luca Solca, luxury goods analyst at Bernstein, also citing the recent successful placement of Golden Goose. “COVID-19 has boosted a process toward casual and comfortable that was already under way, both in apparel and in footwear.”

Asked if there were other brands on the horizon that could pique investor interest, Solca said: “There are many footwear brands popping up here and there. Think about Allbirds or Autry, just to name two.”

Pierre Mallevays, co-head of merchant banking at Stanhope Capital Group, said “strong brands are more powerful than ever” in the digital age — and that’s what’s driving transactions.

“Money has never been so plentiful, but investors are generally less tolerant of risk, so successful companies with strong brands are all the more attractive,” he said.

Describing a strong complicity between the Arnault family and the Catterton team, Mallevays noted “both share a unique understanding of successfully managing brands whilst carefully nurturing brand equity.”

Birkenstock has certainly raised its profile in recent years: hosting events during Paris Fashion Week, collaborating with top-tier designers like Rick Owens, and even convincing Manolo Blahnik, the king of delicate heels, to pose in its advertising.

In Mallevays’ view, the new majority owners of Birkenstock will offer “guidance and support in reinforcing its brand positioning and in streamlining and strengthening its distribution channels, which have been the strong suits of the luxury sector.”

The rise of sneaker culture has led investors to explore, and exploit, the potential of other comfortable — and potentially collectible — types of flat footwear. Earlier in February, Permira was tipped as one of Birkenstock’s suitors, and that was not a surprise.

In late January, Permira took Dr. Martens public on the London Stock Exchange at a top-of-the-range price of 3.70 pounds a share. The offer was oversubscribed eight times before it landed on the board, and the shares have been trading at around 5 pounds since then.

Permira purchased Dr. Martens in 2014 for 300 million pounds, and more than tripled the revenues to 672.2 million pounds in fiscal 2019-20. It raised 1.3 billion pounds from the float, and retained a 42.9 percent stake in Docs, convinced the British bootmaker still has miles of growth ahead of it.

Last year Permira added Italian brand Golden Goose to its stable. While its sneakers may have a much higher price tag than Dr. Martens, Permira clearly sees potential in both as women cast off their heels and pivot their spend to cool flat shoes that can be worn every day.

While financial terms were not disclosed on Friday, 250-year-old Birkenstock is believed to be valued at 4 billion euros. The company reported revenues of 720 million euros in 2019 and hinted that it powered ahead last year in spite of the pandemic.

The two remaining relatives of the founder of the company, Christian and Alex Birkenstock, said they entered “this strategic partnership after carefully examining all options.”

They said the sale would “further strong growth in future growth markets such as China and India” and that the new partners would invest in German sites and expand production, logistics and sales operations. “At the same time the company plans to invest in the further development of its direct-to-consumer business and the expansion of its e-commerce platforms,” Birkenstock said in a statement.

Although Birkenstocks’ new connection to Arnault’s LVMH, is indirect — that is, via L Catterton — there is potential for greater collaboration between the luxury giant and the German footwear brand.

A leader in the luxury market, LVMH has a market capitalization of 266 billion euros. Its global presence and stable of brands and companies connect Birkenstock to various possibilities, everything from more of the savvy designer collaborations with the likes of Valentino and Proenza Schouler that have brought the company so much attention over recent years, to a slot in the duty-free sector, thanks to LVMH’s DFS subsidiary.

Birkenstock has also dabbled in other lifestyle products, including a line of signature beds and an array of natural cosmetics.

Market watchers have suggested that Birkenstock may develop the same way German luggage brand Rimowa has since LVMH bought a majority stake from that family-owned brand’s heirs for 640 million euros in 2016. Since then, LVMH has pushed Rimowa toward more designer collaborations, including with streetwear stalwarts like Supreme and Off-White, as well as with LVMH stablemate Dior. LVMH also opened more Rimowa stores, and diversified the product range with new colors and sizes, as well as soft accessories and eyewear.

L Catterton is a partnership between the original U.S. investment firm Catterton and Arnault’s LVMH and Groupe Arnault, formed in 2016. It describes itself as “the largest, diversified consumer-dedicated private equity firm in the world” and has more than $22 billion under management, with stakes in a wide variety of firms, including Everlane, Ba&sh, Intercos Group, Sweaty Betty and more. L Catterton recently snapped up Jott, a French outerwear firm known for its lightweight puffers.

The Birkenstock brothers, who will stay on with the company and hold a minority share, praised their new business partners for “a deep understanding of the details of a manufacturing business that is all about quality and a respect for brands with a long heritage like ours.”

“We truly appreciate brands with this long heritage,” Arnault said in a statement. “Together we will provide support to the business so it can fully realize its significant growth potential.”

In Friday’s statement, Birkenstock said it is “performing better than ever before in its 250-year history and reported “another record year” despite the coronavirus pandemic.

Certainly Birkenstock, which produces around 24 million pairs of shoes a year, has been one of the winners of lockdowns everywhere. Between April and June 2020, searches for the brand’s distinctive sandals rose 225 percent, according to online fashion search engine Lyst.

A Birkenstock spokesperson noted that the brand has grown steadily over the last decade: “Sure, the lockdown and home office have given us a boost. But Birkenstock was beloved before the pandemic, and we believe we will be after the pandemic, too.”

Blahnik certainly gave a lyrical endorsement last year when he appeared in the Birkenstock campaign.

“They are intelligently designed and wonderfully comfortable, with a classical continuity,” he enthused. “I respect that as a brand they have never conformed to trends and have an ethos of creating designs built to last.”

According to Forbes, Jay-Z’s net worth has gone from $1 billion to $1.4 billion just two weeks after he struck deals to sell his music streaming service Tidal and half of his champagne brand Armand de Brignac — better known as Ace of Spades — to elevate his business portfolio.

The outlet broke down the Brooklyn entrepreneur’s net worth to highlight his sales from Roc Nation ($140 million), the other half of Armand de Brignac ($320 million), his D’Usse cognac ($120 million), royalties from his music ($95 million), his art collection ($70 million), real estate ventures he shares with his wife Beyoncé ($50 million), and $425 million in cash and investments from his collection of startups including Ethos — an insurance company — and salad chain Sweetgreen.

Additionally, Jay-Z also has holdings in Uber and SpaceX, as well as shares in Oatmilk company Oatly, which is expected to IPO this year for a $10 billion valuation.

Since he got started in music, Jay-Z has always been two steps ahead thinking of a long-term plan that included turning himself into a self-made business success story and increasing his net worth.

Over the years, the rap legend has explored the business side of several different industries, including art, technology, spirits, fashion, and more.

As Hip-Hop’s first-ever billionaire, he certainly predicted this moment right in his verse from Kanye West’s 2005 song “Diamonds From Sierra Leone (Remix)” when he said, “I’m not a businessman; I’m a business, man!”

LVMH relaunches Moynat with precise distribution and style strategies. But the focal point is certainly craftsmanship, which according to Sidney Toledano is “the heart of Moynat”.

LVMH relaunches Moynat

Moynat was founded in 1849, anticipating Louis Vuitton by five years. In 2011, LVMH decided to reactivate the maison. For this reason, the holding has appointed Lisa Attia as CEO and Nicholas Knightly as creative director. Market sources cited by WWD estimate that Moyant’s turnover is around 50 million euros. Now the brand is ready for a new phase of growth.

The appeal

“It is time to reaffirm the reputation and desirability of the brand and to maintain its craftsmanship” – Toledano, president and CEO of LVMH Fashion Group, as well as president and supervisor of Moynat, tells WWD. “For a brand with such a strong heritage and legitimacy, the opportunity is to expand appreciation for craftsmanship to a younger audience”. In Knightly’s office stands a blackboard made up of small leather samples, reports WWD.

They come in a staggering range of shades – many are in the grained “taurillon” leather that Moynat is known for. Colours are the hallmark of the latest collection, where black bags are banned. “Heritage is the greatest asset of the brand. It gives authenticity, and also a kind of authority – says Knightly, who notes how the leather corners of some bags are sewn in the same way as in the nineteenth century -. Nowadays, as many things are mass-produced, this savoir-faire is more precious”.

The collaboration marked the first time a Black woman designer had helmed her own brand with the backing of a luxury giant — LVMH’s investment in the launch was reported to be to the tune of some $30 million.

Less than two years on, this February, delight turned to despair with the news that Fenty has been shuttered — although LVMH remains committed to Fenty Beauty and Fenty Skin. The fledgeling house of Fenty is one of many fashion businesses devastated by the impact of Covid-19.

A series of Black-owned businesses have been forced to close during the pandemic, including the 12-year-old New York-based Cushnie label helmed by Carly Cushnie, best known for its eveningwear. “The effects of Covid-19 have hurt my business beyond repair,” Cushnie said in a statement released last October.

The shutdowns have rekindled debate about the ongoing challenges facing Black fashion designers looking to develop profitable businesses. Many Black designers struggle to find finance and face an uphill struggle even when they do.

That said, Black designers across the globe are working hard to scale up. Here, designers James Flemons from Los Angeles, Leomie Anderson from London and Adebayo Oke-Lawal from Lagos explain how they’ve grown their businesses over the years and share their strategies for success.

At 19, James Flemons moved from Los Angeles to New York City with a debut spell at Marc by Marc Jacobs behind him and full of hope that he could develop his career. It didn’t work out. As he puts it, “I got burnt and had to move back home.”

Back in LA, Flemons created his label, Phlemuns, starting with one-of-a-kind denim pieces inspired by a love for vintage clothing. Flemons had always struggled to find great denim, so he and his cousin would go thrifting at Goodwill and then upcycle their finds. Creating these one-off denim pieces brought Flemons visibility — soon, people beyond his immediate circle were asking for his pieces."

And according toForbes,the Roc Nation mogul’s move was worth more than the “half a B” he bragged about in Meek Mill’s 2018 Championships single “What’s Free.”

The deal appears to have valued the Armand de Brignac brand at over $600 million, which would land him a cash payment of at least $300 million.

Just a few months prior, Financial Times revealed the family-owned operation had been exploring the possibility an acquisition by CVC – the group which currently retains notable interests in UnitedLex, Formula One Group, as well as Breitling – with the help of bankers from Goldman Sachs. This initial deal was rumoured to be worth around the same value ($6.18 billion).

CVC had ambitions to “grow sales in new markets while capitalising on the brand’s loyal customer base”, due in great part to the fact its executives believe Birkenstock’s popularity is “less likely to fluctuate with fashion” than the likes of Dr Martens (which rival firm Permira owns). But now, it appears that Birkenstock have picked another horse for the race ahead.

“For the next 250 years, we need partners sharing the same strategic and long-term vision as the Birkenstock family,” says Christian and Alex Birkenstock.

“In L Catterton and Financière Agache, we have found those partners. They bring both a deep understanding of the details of a manufacturing business that is all about quality and a respect for brands with a long heritage like ours.”

“We look forward to taking the next steps with our partners and carrying our family business into an even brighter future.”

As previously noted, Birkenstock certainly isn’t the shabbiest of investments by Financière Agache and the LVMH affiliated entity. Filings indicate the company generated €721.5 million (AU$1.13 billion) in revenues and €129 million (AU$202.15 million) in net income in the year to September 2019; that’s a 40% bump in net profit compared to the previous year.

The billionaire rapper’s bubbly deal could be the biggest celebrity booze sell-off since George Clooney sold Casamigos tequila.

Jay-Z announced this week that he was selling his Armand de Brignac champagne brand to the wine and spirits division of luxury goods behemoth LVMH—and personally raked in more than $300 million from the blockbuster bubbly deal, according to Forbes.

The deal appears to have valued the brand, Armand de Brignac, at more than $600 million, which would land him a cash payment of at least $300 million—about $50 million more than he would have made based on the $500 million value he rapped about in Meek Mill’s 2018 song “What’s Free.”



The founder of RocNation sold 50% of the champagne business to LVMH’s Moët Hennessy in a move aimed at “taking the business to new heights across the world,” according to Moet’s CEO Philippe Schaus. LVMH is known to bid competitively, and that certainly appears to have been true for this latest deal.

Jay-Z’s bubbly brand—also known as “Ace of Spades” due to its logo design and references in the rapper’s lyrics hyping it—was estimated to be worth “roughly $630 million” by Forbes, based on conversations with beverage analysts and industry insiders.

The terms of the deal have not been publicly reported by LVMH or Jay-Z, the “first billionaire rapper” whose company will still handle production of Armand de Brignac. But Jay-Z, who recently launched a cannabis line, likely pocketed at least $315 million in the champagne deal.

But as Forbes points out, it’s not the only lucrative celebrity booze deal that caused investors to pop corks in celebration. That lofty title is still held by George Clooney and his partners, who sold Casamigos tequila to British liquor giant Diageo in 2017 for an estimated $1 billion.

Meanwhile, in other Jay-Z mogul news, Square reached a deal with the hip-hop icon to take control of Tidal in an attempt to rejuvenate the struggling music streaming service.

The Jack Dorsey-led financial services firm will pay $297 million in cash and stock for a “significant majority ownership stake” in Tidal, which Jay-Z bought for $56 million in 2015. Jay-Z will also join Square’s board of directors once the deal closes in the second quarter of this year, the company said."
When Will Luxury Brands Take Resale In-House? - Jing Daily,"Fri, 05 Mar 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vamluZ2RhaWx5LmNvbS9wb3N0cy93aGVuLXdpbGwtbHV4dXJ5LWJyYW5kcy10YWtlLXJlc2FsZS1pbi1ob3VzZdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,", resale has become a big business , one that is only becoming more important with younger consumers displaying a preference for archival pieces and sustainable consumption. According to the Boston Consulting Group , the global resale market is valued at as much as $40 billion, and is set to grow at a compound annual rate of 15 to 20% over the next half-decade.

Even in China, where consumers have traditionally been less receptive to used goods, the effective use of content-commerce strategies by domestic platforms such as

,

,

, and

is fueling a surge of interest in secondhand luxury.

Yet globally, resale still represents a tiny share of the luxury market, accounting for an estimated 2% of revenue (in China, its share is larger, at and approximately 5% of the total luxury market). For major resale platforms (and investors), there’s a clear opportunity.

While VCs have been pouring cash into platforms like

,

, and

, luxury brands themselves have, until recently, remained resistant to the idea of endorsing secondhand luxury retail. But now that wariness looks to have evaporated, thanks at least in part to the coronavirus pandemic.

This month,

acquired a 5% stake in Vestiaire Collective (along with a board seat) in the platform’s €178 million ($214 million) fundraising round, while Kering-owned

announced an official partnership with the U.S.-listed The RealReal in October 2020. Rival

is also expected to outline broader plans for resale in 2021, with its group head of image, communications, and environment Antoine Arnault telling Vogue last fall, “We are currently studying the subject [of resale]. It is still a little early to fully answer this question. It's an economy that exists, that's growing in importance, so we're looking at it carefully.”

The clear opportunity in resale — and the fear of missing out — was echoed by Kering digital chief Grégory Boutté, who said, “We recognize that this is a fundamental shift that’s happening in the way clients are relating and engaging with luxury fashion, so we don’t want to close our eyes and pretend it’s not happening.”

At this point, seeing more luxury groups and brands ink official partnerships with resale platforms is no real surprise, given how such deals can help control the spread of counterfeits and maintain brand image. But the trend also brings up the more interesting question of when brands will cut out the middleman by taking resale in-house, and what effect that will ultimately have on the platforms.

A Kering brand could well be among the first to take that step, potentially Gucci, whose CEO, Marco Bizzarri, told Vogue Business , that the brand was “looking into a large offering in its own stores.”

LVMH’s relative silence on the matter also speaks volumes. The group’s focus on sustainability, — reflected in the recent prioritization of upcycling by portfolio brands like

and

— hints at the possibility that the group could take archival or secondhand retail in-house through either a new platform or the evolution of its

e-commerce site.

Even as it lags behind Kering in the race to integrate resale into its broader offerings, LVMH has an opportunity to leapfrog into a stronger position in the “certified pre-owned” space simply by retaining full control for the time being and opting out of working with third parties. As the most valuable company in Europe, LVMH has many resources at its disposal, along with a broad consumer base that spans boomers to Gen Z, an enviable worldwide brick-and-mortar footprint, and at least moderate prowess in the digital space.

The next question is whether LVMH can put its many advantages to use. Will it enter into some sort of partnership with a platform like The RealReal or Vestiaire Collective or take a wait-and-see approach, perhaps learning from any mistakes Kering happens to make in the months ahead?"

In ""The Doers,"" LVMH invites consumers to peer into the passion of the employees behind the brand. Image courtesy of LVMH

French luxury conglomerate LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton has launched a new series highlighting the top employees behind many of its illustrious brands.

“The Doers” takes consumers into the hearts of those who work tirelessly to make LVMH one of the leaders in the luxury business. In the series, employees talk about their passions for their professions and what inspires them day-to-day, especially amid such a challenging landscape.

""I think this series is great for those that are enthusiasts of the brand, but I also think that this speaks to those that like to know about how a business functions,” said Kimmie Smith, cofounder and creative director of Athleisure Mag, New York. “These are personal stories by someone who is in the know and who really has their hand on the pulse on what is going on.

“It’s always interesting to see how iconic brands with significant resources are grappling with universal situations that have been a global issue,” she said. “It provides insight into the brand and also allows others to reflect how they would and have done this is in their own ventures.”

The Doers

The inaugural episode of the series takes consumers to the Louis Vuitton Champs-Elysées. Here, consumers hear from Sophie Aubin, the store director.

The vignette is artfully shot with Ms. Aubin sitting on a taupe file cabinet, discussing her team, the challenges of the pandemic and the passion woven throughout the brand. The vignette vacillates between black-and-white film of Ms. Aubin and full color B-roll.

Sophie Aubin, store director at Louis Vuitton Champs-Elysées, stars in the first episode of the series.

The store director explains how she leads a team of about 300 people. She speaks of the passion and mission of the team.

“This means working in a magical place that has been here for more than 20 years,” Ms. Aubin says in the video. “Where we’re privileged to sell very beautiful products.”

The short also includes photos of the interior and exterior of the store in conjunction with behind-the-scenes shots of Ms. Aubin speaking with the video’s production team.

Within a week of Ms. Aubin beginning her role as store director, she had to close the doors due to the pandemic lockdowns.

“It was a chance for me to begin a new chapter and see things quite differently,” Ms. Aubin said.

The store director the explains that it is her job to make sure that every member of her team is obsessed with and dedicated to ensuring that consumers have the best possible experience. She goes on to highlight the importance of sincerity in her work and how caring is needed to motivate teams and close sales.

Ms. Aubin also speaks of her team rising to the challenge of the COVID-19 pandemic in maintaining flexibility and developing new methods to stay engaged with customers. This included virtual sessions via Zoom and asking sale advisors to act as actors in creating enticing virtual content featuring the store’s products.

One of Ms. Aubin’s primary goals is to start each day with positive energy, stating that she and her team will begin most days singing, dancing and engaging in a round of applause.

The end of the vignette ends with the store director sharing that Bernard Arnault, chairman/CEO of LVMH, visits the store every Saturday to gauge how the week went for the team and that week’s consumers.

As the pandemic has provided challenges, Ms. Aubin continually reverberates the importance of remembering the passion behind the job and brand.

The power of a story

After the pandemic set forth a range of restrictions and the future remains unclear, brands are continuing to develop ways to connect with consumers online through creative content and storytelling.

This includes an emphasis on behind-the-scenes content as well.

French fashion label Chanel is inviting fans to join a dialogue about what it means to wear the brand, highlighting the new spring/summer 2021 haute couture collection. The roundtable ends with a reflection on how good it feels to come together to experience Chanel, whether in person or virtually, while looking forward to future creative gatherings (see story).

In another recent effort, LVMH invited students and young prospective employees to submit questions about pursuing fulfilling careers in luxury. The group assembled a panel of young professionals to share their LVMH experiences and work advice in a video series (see story).

“The Doers,” is yet another example of how luxury groups and brands are illustrating brand values and how they continue to overcome challenges.

“I think that there are so many layers to how the pandemic has changed the simplest of tasks, taking in deliveries, social distancing, going to work remotely et cetera--it’s made all of us think about how we interact in the world,” Ms. Smith said. “The ability to continue to service people at a high standard while being compliant with what they need to do for their personal safety is a new skill that has had to be adopted.”"
Is the '21' Club Really Closing? - The New York Times,"Sat, 13 Mar 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiNWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjEvMDMvMTMvc3R5bGUvMjEtY2x1Yi5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"It should not have, but it came as a shock that the jockeys had vanished. There they’d stood outside the “21” Club on West 52nd Street for decades, 35 of them, with their cast metal arms upraised to grasp the reins of some invisible mount, their silks brightly painted in the colors of storied thoroughbred stables. Suddenly, then, they were gone.

And now so, too, it would seem, is the “21” Club itself.

On March 9, almost a year since the pandemic forced the city to ban indoor dining, the “21” Club moved to terminate 148 employees, the majority unionized, according to a notice filed with the New York Department of Labor. “‘21’ Club has been an iconic part of the New York experience for nearly a century,” a spokeswoman for LVMH, the French luxury goods conglomerate that acquired the restaurant as part of a $2.6 billion 2018 deal for the Belmond Limited hospitality group, said in an emailed statement.

The devastating impact of the pandemic on the restaurant and hospitality industries, the spokeswoman added, had necessitated making “the difficult decision not to reopen ‘21' in its current form,” but rather to reimagine its “distinctive role in the city’s exciting future.”

What that “distinctive” role is remains to be seen. Yet almost certainly it will not include John Papaliberios."
LVMH Is Officially The Most Valuable Company In Europe - Boss Hunting,"Wed, 03 Mar 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJvc3NodW50aW5nLmNvbS5hdS9odXN0bGUvbHZtaC1tb3N0LXZhbHVhYmxlLWNvbXBhbnktZXVyb3BlL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LVMH has been acquiring companies left, right, and centre of late. In the last two weeks alone, the luxury conglomerate has welcomed both Jay-Z’s Armand de Brignac – otherwise known as Ace of Spades champagne – and German footwear brand Birkenstock into the fold. The recent activity hasn’t gone unnoticed, either. With shares sending the market capitalisation soaring to over €265 billion (AU$409 billion), as of now, LVMH is the most valuable company in Europe.

It’s certainly no small feat considering, a) the sheer concentration of share market capital in Europe, and b) the fact that LVMH has overtaken Nestle, the largest food and beverage company in the entire world (€242 billion; AU$374 billion). While it may be a little while before they can compete for the crown against Apple‘s (NASDAQ: AAPL) mind-boggling, multi-trillion dollar market cap, LVMH currently retains a respectable global rank of 21st.

As the largest luxury group in the entire world, LVMH owns a total of 75 primary brands across five key divisions – Wine & Spirits, Fashion & Leather Goods, Perfume & Cosmetics, Watches & Selective Jewellery Retailing, and Other Activities. According to ISN Magazine, Fashion & Leather Goods accounted for 46% of the company’s revenue from Q1 to Q3 in 2020.

Despite the global economic slump instigated by COVID-19, LVMH has recovered from a rather steep decline in share price by early November last year, finishing the year with gains of almost +24%. As of the time of this writing, the share price has increased by nearly +45% (year-to-date).

“LVMH showed remarkable resilience against the unprecedented health crisis the world experienced in 2020,” noted Chairman & CEO Bernard Arnault via press statement.

“Our Maisons have shown great agility and creative energy in continuing to bring to life our customers’ dreams through a unique digital experience, thereby further strengthening their desirability.”

“In a context that remains uncertain, even with the hope of vaccination giving us a glimpse of an end to the pandemic, we are confident that LVMH is in an excellent position to build upon the recovery for which the world wishes in 2021 and to further strengthen our lead in the global luxury market.”"

The entrepreneur was seen taking a solo walk after catching up with a group of her friends at the Parisian-style bistro, Pastis.

Rihanna, 33, wore a sizable blue-and-black snow jacket on top of a matching blue blazer to keep herself warm in the frigid winter temperatures.

Stepping out: On Friday evening, Rihanna was spotted for the first time since LVMH announced that it had parted ways with her Fenty brand

She paired her top with a loose-fitting pair of sweatpants, which she contrasted with a set of white high-heeled shoes.

The songwriter carried a small bag with her during her outing and tied her beautiful black hair back.

Rihanna's outing comes just under a month after the luxury goods corporation LVMH announced that it had ceased production on her Fenty line.

Layering up: The singer wore a sizable snow jacket and a pair of loose-fitting black pants, which she contrasted with a pair of white high-heeled shoes

The songwriter founded the brand in 2017 and officially began offering products two years later.

Fenty is the newest line under LVMH to produce clothing and footwear in over twenty years; the brand was highly successful upon its initial launch.

Rihanna went on to found multiple other businesses featuring the Fenty name, including the wildly popular Fenty x Savage lingerie line.

The hitmaker was often featured in the clothing brand's promotional materials.

Doing her thing: Rihanna founded Fenty in 2017 and officially launched the line two years later

Last month, however, it was announced that production of all Fenty products would be halted; the singer's other lines would not be affected by this decision.

A representative for LVMH issued a statement to Women's Wear Daily and noted that the circumstances of the global pandemic had made production difficult and that no more products from the brand would be offered in the near future.

The statement read, 'Rihanna and LVMH have jointly made the decision to put on hold the ready-to-wear activity, based in Europe, pending better conditions.'

The publication also reported that private equity company L Catterton was investing in the Fenty X Savage line, signaling that the songwriter would not be leaving the fashion industry anytime soon.

Putting an end to things: Last month, LVMH issued a statement where it was noted that the company had put a hold on the production of Fenty products 'pending better conditions'; Rihanna is seen with LVMH CEO Bernard Arnault in May of 2019

Apart from dealing with her various fashion ventures, the Only Girl (In The World) has recently been spending time with fellow musician ASAP Rocky, who was seen arriving at JFK Airport in NYC on Friday.

The 32-year-old rapper was dressed in a striped t-shirt featuring deep blue lines at the bottom of his sleeves and torso.

He also wore a red-and-blue windbreaker and a baseball cap; he eventually removed both articles of clothing.

The Sundress songwriter tied off his outfit with a pair of ripped blue jeans and a set of Adidas Samba sneakers; he wore a facial covering to keep himself protected from COVID-19.

The now-couple maintained a close friendship in the early stages of the rapper's career, and he served as Rihanna's opening act for part of her 2013 Diamonds World Tour.

In January of 2020, the Diamonds singer broke up with her boyfriend of three years, Hassan Jameel, and subsequently began spending more time with the ASAP Forever songwriter.

After months of speculation, an insider confirmed to People that the musicians were officially dating.

Neither Rihanna nor ASAP Rocky have commented on the nature of their relationship as of yet."

The report released on Monday, March 22, publicly disclosed information from the five biggest companies by revenue in three categories - luxury, sportswear and high-street fashion. These included Hermès, Moët Hennessy, Louis Vuitton (LVMH), H&M, Adidas etc. According to The Economic Times, the fashion publication rated companies out of 100 in their attempt towards meeting the 16 targets listed in the UN Sustainable Development Goals and Paris Agreement on emissions, waste, workers' rights, water, and materials.

Twelve sustainability experts advised the online publication on the methodology of the report. The companies were also ranked on their transparency and the amount of information available about a company's practices.

According to the report, the companies were more interested in disclosing information on their targets than concrete actions towards fulfilling them.

""Opaque working practices and fuzzy definitions of what constitutes 'good' progress complicate matters further, creating a woolly picture of where the industry is at and what steps are required for it to clean up its act,"" the report said.

Luxury goods company, Kering, topped the list with 49 points, while sports equipment company Under Armour ranked the lowest with nine points. The average score was 36 points. Kering and Nike performed well on transparency, while PVH Corp, Levi Strauss, and VF Corp ranked highest in their efforts to reduce emissions. Luxury brands like Hermès, LVMH and Richemont scored lower than high street fashion companies H&M, Inditex, Gap and Levi Strauss in all the six categories - emissions, waste, workers' rights, materials and transparency. Retail companies, including Fast Retailing, Richmount, also ranked the lowest in all categories along with Under Armour, except it scored well in workers' rights. According to the report, companies, on average, performed the worst on waste and workers' rights. While other companies have not responded to the report, Adidas said that it worked closely with its partners to attain climate neutrality by 2025 and throughout its supply chain by 2050.

Exotic leather is ethical: LVMH and Richemont explain why - LaConceria | Il portale dell'area pelle - laconceria.it,"Thu, 11 Mar 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxhY29uY2VyaWEuaXQvZW4vc3VzdGFpbmFiaWxpdHkvZXhvdGljLWxlYXRoZXItaXMtZXRoaWNhbC1sdm1oLWFuZC1yaWNoZW1vbnQtZXhwbGFpbi13aHkv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"At some point of the debate, the question becomes very direct: is it ethical to use exotic leather in fashion? The answer is yes. It is, according to the scientists currently working on preserving animal species. It is, according to LVMH and Richemont. Cathelijne Klomp and Matthew Kilgarriff, respectively manager of the Environment Development Department of the French conglomerate and director of the CSR at the Swiss one, are sure. Structuring a safe and certified chain for exotic leather is a guarantee for the animal kingdom, its habitat and local communities working in the segment.

LVMH and Richemont

Arnault’s Holding believes that ethicality for exotic leather is first and foremost a matter of best practices and structural investments. “Animal welfare is one of the main interests for LVMH – explains Klomp, explaining her view during the last LP Sustainability Talks -. We have created many sustainability programs for our brands. We set goals and utilize tools to achieve them. We implemented internal protocols, invested in the supply chain, created an audit program to be sure to maintain open dialogue with our suppliers. We work with associations and even competitors of ours, because our goal is to improve the entire chain”.

Using certain material can, nevertheless, cause hostility at this time, from a small section of the public. “We make efforts to be truly sustainable – answers Klomp -, aware that we have a responsibility towards local communities: our decisions have an impact on their economy. We believe in freedom of choice for our designers and clients”.

Conservation projects

Daniel Natusch, member of the IUCN group (International Union for Conservation of Nature), explains the matter further. “Some say that some materials simply shouldn’t be used, and actually believes that, in that case, the animals are saved.

It’s just the opposite: in doing so even more animals would be dead”. Why? “Because conservation projects are expensive and the species to protect are many – he continues -. Regulations to farm crocodiles and using its byproducts, such as meat and leather, has allowed for the recovery of the population number and the tutelage of the species’ habitat.

The truth is that some people don’t like it, but that’s just how it is”. Anthony Rupert was a philanthropist and founding member of the WWF – reminds Kilgariff -. His family still controls Richemont today and follows his environmentalist approach. Some people underestimate, for example, the importance of wet habitats, such as those for crocodiles and alligators, when fighting climate change. A responsible industry can allow such places to be protected and conserved”.

Louisiana’s success

“Many people see a video on Facebook that puts a negative spin on crocodiles’ farms and that’s enough to make them have a negative and definite opinion – observes Christy Plott, 4th generation tanner now leading American Tanning -. People should read scientific studies to know what they are talking about, but these are often found boring and full of graphs and numerical tables”.

The result is that the public forms an opinion that isn’t exactly built on facts and, based on that, tries to change an industry: “Thanks to local and international regulations – adds Plott -, we have been able to build a safe and traceable chain in the past 10 years. One that includes the freeing of reptiles in nature, protecting their habitat and nests.

The majority of the coast is privately owned, and, with no economic incentives, owners would use it differently, rather than allowing animals to roam freely”. “CITES was organized in the mid-70s – states Mathias Loertscher, head of Species Conservation of the Federal Veterinary Office of CITES -. The international commerce of flora and fauna, at the time not regulated, created sustainability problems. We have now solved them”.

In February, Forbes reported that the star’s lingerie brand, Savage X Fenty, is now worth a whopping $1 billion.

The popular intimates brand recorded revenue growth of more than 200% last year; It also “increased its active VIP member base by more than 150%,” the company told WWD in a statement.

The hefty valuation came only two days after Rihanna announced that she and French luxury conglomerate LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton mutually agreed to pause her Fenty ready-to-wear label to focus on Savage X Fenty.

“LVMH and Rihanna reaffirm their ambition to concentrate on the growth and the long-term development of the Fenty ecosystem focusing on cosmetics, skin care and lingerie,” LVMH and Rihanna said in a statement. This comes after the singer made history by inking a deal with LVMH in May 2019, becoming “the first woman to create an original brand at LVMH and the first woman of color at the top of an LVMH maison.”

While that brand has been put on pause, Savage X Fenty couldn’t be growing any faster. The lingerie company is a favorite among influencers and fans, providing affordable, trendy pieces in inclusive sizes.

“In two short years, Savage X Fenty has achieved remarkable success by disrupting the intimates category,” said Jon Owsley, Co-Managing Partner of L Catterton’s Growth Fund, in a press release. “The brand strikes a unique balance between affordability, fashion, and comfort, stands deeply for inclusivity and diversity, and has differentiated itself by building an extraordinary level of affinity and unmatched customer loyalty.”

He continued, “We believe the opportunities ahead for Savage X Fenty are enormous, and we look forward to leveraging our extensive experience in scaling digitally-native consumer brands and partnering with Rihanna, Christiane, Natalie, and the entire Savage X Fenty team to help the Company realize its full potential.”

Rihanna first debuted her lingerie brand in May 2018. Just last month, she launched a Valentine’s Day campaign, posting a video of herself dancing in some Savage X Fenty lingerie while rocking her new mullet.

With the success of Savage X Fenty along with her other ventures, like Fenty Beauty, it’s no wonder the star isn’t rushing to put out music."

Educated at some of the french capital's most prestigious schools (Lycée Chaptal, Sciences Po Paris), Stéphane Bianchi is a man who knows how to rise to the occasion. Rather than following well-trod paths, he is among those who build their career by seizing opportunities and taking up challenges.

After four years in consulting, Bianchi became Chairman and CEO of Petit Bateau, where he stayed for another four years. The next stage in his career took him to Brazil, where he served as local director for Yves Rocher, before becoming the group’s CEO for 17 years. This broad, worldwide experience prepared him for a move to Switzerland and a new challenge: joining Maus Frères as a member of the board. The historic, family-owned Swiss firm provided Stéphane Bianchi with four more years of experience before putting down deeper roots in Switzerland, by joining LVMH’s watchmaking division as CEO, taking over from Jean-Claude Biver.

In November 2018, he also accepted the position of CEO at TAG Heuer, where he joined Frédéric Arnault, the young son of LVMH’s owner, who had been with the firm since 2017, with a particular focus on digital technologies. For two years, Stéphane Bianchi and Frédéric Arnault worked side by side to enable a gradual handover of the La Chaux-de-Fonds Manufacture to the younger man, completed at the end of June 2020 – whereupon Stéphane Bianchi took on the role of CEO of LVMH’s Watches & Jewelry division.

According to Retail Gazette, Thomas Pink updated its own website last month, saying “We’re excited to announce that we’re returning to our roots with the same team that has helped build Thomas Pink Shirtmakers over the years”.

SimplyBiz Group eyes acquisitions with Fintel rebrand - Money Marketing,"Wed, 10 Mar 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1vbmV5bWFya2V0aW5nLmNvLnVrL25ld3Mvc2ltcGx5Yml6LWdyb3VwLWV5ZXMtYWNxdWlzaXRpb25zLXdpdGgtZmludGVsLXJlYnJhbmQv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"SimplyBiz Group has taken on a new name, Fintel, as part of the company’s plan to create a “house of quality brands” rather than a single house brand.

The move has been on the cards since the group acquired Defaqto in 2019 and forms part of its digital strategy.

Speaking to Money Marketing ahead of this morning’s unveiling of the Fintel brand and logo, joint chief executive Matt Timmins (pictured) revealed the group is on the hunt for more acquisitions.

He says: “A key part of what we will be doing going forward will be to look for new opportunities for growth through acquisition.

“And we also have our strategy which we are unfolding, which is organic growth and digitising many aspects of the business.”

The Fintel name has been coined by combining the three “core elements” of what the business offers: financial services, technology and intelligence.

Timmins describes the rebrand as an “evolution of the strategy of the business”, which is to provide more services to the different component parts of retail financial services.

He says: “We aim to help the market evolve to its greatest potential. We are ingrained in providing support services and fintech in the market and we see our role as helping manufacturers, advisers and consumers.

“We don’t manufacture our own products and we don’t give advice. We see our role as the conduit and the heartbeat at the centre of financial services, helping everyone else do a better job.”

Individual brands which sit within the group will remain the same and maintain their own identities.

Fintel says it wants to give the brands more prominence in “who they are and what they do within their individual markets”.

Timmins explains that the purchase of the research, ratings and fintech business Defaqto, was a “pivotal” moment for the group.

Profile: Ken Davy: If I had my time again, I wouldn’t create the network concept

He says: “Here, you had this fantastic business with an excellent reputation, really strong brand, almost 80 per cent consumer recognition and we were putting Defaqto under a business, the SimplyBiz Group, which was known for doing something completely different.

“I felt at that time that we were not doing justice to the hero brands we had under the group.”

With a background in marketing, Timmins also looked at other businesses that have done similar things with strong brands under their stable. He cited alcohol beverage group Diageo, which has more than 200 brands, and LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton with around 75 luxury brands, as a couple of examples.

“I wanted to see how other businesses in the market have evolved to give prominence to their hero brands but create this kind of house with a real sense of purpose.”

Talking about how the decision was made for the lime green colour scheme of the Fintel branding, Timmins adds: “We wanted to create a modern, fresh and vibrant brand in the world of financial services. There’s plenty of reds and blues when you look around, there’s not many lime greens.

“We also wanted to create a brand that was core to our personalities. I describe this brand to our staff as 80 per cent grounded in reality and 20 per cent aspirational.”

“We talked about the values of excellence and knowledge and being grounded and important personality traits. But then there’s a dose of aspiration in there with what this business is set up to do for the future. I think Fintel gives us the right stable to go out and achieve that.”

Recognising the group’s almost two-decades in the industry, Timmins says the new launch is “not just turning the handle” on the SimplyBiz Group. “It’s new but with a nod to the heritage and history,” he says.

The customer bases of SimplyBiz and Defaqto may be pleased to see the operating brands remain the same, they will just sit beneath a new PLC.

Timmins says that while the group often reviews new businesses, it is not currently in negotiations with any.

But he suggests there are two broad areas of focus – the first is a business likely to add to the customer base and scale of the group’s operation, such as a competitor.

And the second is a business with “unique technology and demonstrated traction and usability”."
