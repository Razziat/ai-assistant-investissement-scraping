"Richemont, LVMH Top List of Biggest Fashion Firms by Market Cap - WWD","Wed, 30 Dec 2015 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3dkLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy1uZXdzL2ZpbmFuY2lhbC9sdm1oLXJpY2hlbW9udC1mYXNoaW9uLWFwcGFyZWwtcmFua2luZy0xMDMwMzM4Mi_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The fashion apparel, accessories and luxury goods segment is big business — really big.

According to an analysis by WWD of the 563 constituent companies that comprise the Standard and Poor’s apparel, accessories and luxury goods segment of global, public companies, the total market capitalization is $639.9 billion, while annual revenues add up to $376 billion.

And the top 25 companies within the segment generate $228 billion in annual sales and have a total market cap of $448 billion. LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton SA, Compagnie Financière Richemont SA and Hermès International Société are the top firms when ranked by market capitalization.

The apparel, accessories and luxury goods segment is a component of the consumer discretionary sector, which is made up of eight segments that also include: specialty apparel retailers; department stores; specialty stores; footwear; general merchandise; catalogue, and Internet retailers. The classifications are determined by the S&P and are based on various factors including industry codes. For example, while Adidas AG is in the apparel, accessories and luxury goods segment, competitor Nike Inc. is listed under footwear.

It’s also important to note that stock values globally in the consumer discretionary sector have performed well for the most part this past year, but many companies within the fashion apparel and accessories segment struggled. Michael Kors Holdings Ltd., for example, came in at number 18 on the list of top 25 companies by market cap with $7.5 billion. But the company has shed nearly 50 percent of its market cap over the past year.

Currently, there are more declining stocks in the sector than there are gainers. A challenging retail environment coupled with a strong dollar and economic woes in China, which has hurt tourism spending abroad, have made it hard for many firms.

Shaping the fashion world of the future with Delphine Arnault and the LVMH Prize. - Document Journal,"Wed, 02 Dec 2015 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRvY3VtZW50am91cm5hbC5jb20vMjAxNS8xMi9zaGFwaW5nLXRoZS1mYXNoaW9uLXdvcmxkLW9mLXRoZS1mdXR1cmUtd2l0aC1kZWxwaGluZS1hcm5hdWx0LWFuZC10aGUtbHZtaC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"One of the most remarkable things about the LVMH Prize is that nothing is asked of the winners by LVMH—they want nothing in return. That Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, the biggest luxury goods conglomerate in the world, with its base of global operations in the historic fashion capital of Paris, simply wants to help young designers from all over the world by recognizing their talent is seen as something of a curve ball. There is no secret ‘hot housing’ scheme to find seedling designers that can be covertly planted at the leviathan luxury group at a later date; there is no requested hand-over of work that the group might find profitable to exploit—and there is certainly no nefarious mimicking of that work; there is no national bias for the choosing of winners with a potential for French flag-waving—the two main prize winners in the two years the competition has been running are Canadian and Portuguese respectively, with both labels based in and staging fashion shows in London. Instead—and this is perhaps so shocking in its straightforwardness—there is simply a desire that the winners do well with their fashion labels, no matter where that might take them.

Thomas Tait, the young Canadian designer and main winner of the inaugural award in 2014, explains: “I had lunch with Delphine Arnault after the announcement that Marques’Almeida was the recipient this year—I had been asked to attend the announcement in Paris too. When I saw Delphine she told me that I wasn’t to think that LVMH would ‘abandon me’, that they would be there for me to call on regardless. I then kind of just came out with it, saying ‘But what do you want from me in all of this?’ And all she said was, ‘For you to be successful and do well in your career.’ That’s it?! I thought that was sort of incredible.” And as Thomas Tait had been given 300,000 euros, as well as dedicated guidance, support, and introduction to manufacturers and producers through the group’s mentorship over that past year—and had his profile elevated immeasurably because of this win—it could indeed be seen as rather an incredible thing.

The instigator and driving force behind the LVMH Prize is the said Delphine Arnault—she is also one of the main reasons there is both an idealistic, instinctive, and beneficent way of thinking behind it. As Director and Executive Vice President of Louis Vuitton, both the powerhouse and jewel in the crown of LVMH, Delphine Arnault is more than au fait with the business of fashion. Besides this role that began in 2013, she has served on the LVMH Management Board since 2003. She is the first woman and the youngest person ever to do so—she was 28 years old at the time of her appointment, and had been working generally within the business structure of LVMH since three years before that. But besides her business chops, what makes Delphine Arnault particularly attuned to the role of mentor to fledgling designers is something a bit more instinctive and human in her make up: she has a simple appreciation, enthusiasm, and respect for creative people and the creative process. And this is something far more rare in the business side of fashion than might at first be thought.

“When you are an entrepreneur working in a big company you also have to be creative in finding solutions to a lot of problems. But when you see really creative people doing things with their hands and with their minds, this is something so impressive and it is with them that we create all of the beautiful products, of course.”

This side of Delphine Arnault really came to my attention when working on a project for Louis Vuitton. It soon became clear that her unwavering enthusiasm for the creative people involved in The Icon And The Iconoclasts Monogram collection had persuaded many of them to be a part of the project in the first place. It certainly was the case for the preeminent architect of our age, Frank Gehry, who, quite frankly, can choose to do whatever the hell he pleases. And despite being rather busy with the completion of the Fondation Louis Vuitton, he still found time to design a handbag—and he really was extensively and almost crazily involved in this handbag, he even imagined what it would be like to sit inside the bag to design the interior. When asked why he was persuaded to venture into such unknown bag territory, he simply replied, “Because I love Delphine.” And this appreciation is a two-way street. When I asked Delphine Arnault why she wanted Frank Gehry involved, she said, “He is so remarkable and special. In a different life I would like to work for Frank Gehry.” And do note, she said ‘for’ not ‘with’—I had never heard somebody in quite such a powerful business position in the fashion industry be so genuinely modest. This is something I remind her of when we talk about the LVMH Prize, in Paris in the run-up to the Fall/Winter 2015 haute couture shows.

“I love Karl as well!” she laughs. “In fact I love all of them, Cindy and Rei are so impressive too…. This was one of my first projects working at Vuitton.” Of course Delphine Arnault is talking about Lagerfeld, Sherman, and Kawakubo respectively, all contributing original work for The Icon and The Iconoclasts project. She continues:

“It is quite fascinating to see people who are so gifted in action, to work with Frank or Karl or Nicolas. I know I am so lucky to be able to work with people like this. When you are an entrepreneur working in a big company, you also have to be creative in finding solutions to a lot of problems. But when you see really creative people doing things with their hands and with their minds, this is something so impressive and it is with them that we create all of the beautiful products of course.”

Such an attitude of respect has stood her in good stead for the LVMH Prize, as it is as much about trusting the judgement of the stellar designers employed at the LVMH group as anything else.

“I had had the idea to create the prize for a couple of years—I was still working at Dior at the time,” explains Arnault, who had previously been Deputy Managing Director at Christian Dior between 2008–2013. “I discussed it with Raf, who pointed out all of the amazing talent that we have here at the group, that we have the best designers in the world; we thought that they should be part of the jury finding the designers of tomorrow. It is such a good idea but nobody had done it before.”

This year Raf Simons, Marc Jacobs, Nicolas Ghesquière, Phoebe Philo, Ricardo Tisci, Humberto Leon and Carol Lim, Jonathan Anderson and, last but not least, Karl Lagerfeld himself, went to make up most of the epic (and rather terrifying) final jury that the short listed contestants of the prize have to face. Here, their final presentation is made and it is something of a nerve-wracking experience.

“I have to say that room is very impressive,” laughs Arnault. “Each time I see the young ones that are being interviewed, you feel the pressure on them; how they really look up to the people who are doing the interviewing, that they have to present to their heroes. It is an amazing opportunity but at the same time there are a lot of emotions; there is a lot of stress for them.” She then adds, quite significantly, and proving that she certainly is no pushover: “But of course as a fashion designer you have to go through a lot of stress. You have to create amazing ready-to-wear with a great personality to it, but you also have to be able to express it and to speak to the press and in turn the world! That is also part of your job.”

The opportunity of talking to and receiving the views and opinions of many of the preeminent designers at work today was certainly a pull for Marques’Almeida’s Marta Marques and Paolo Almeida to enter the prize once again this year. “People were shocked we entered it again,” says Marta Marques. “But we saw it as a really good opportunity to show our work to people we admire. We did not think beyond that. We just thought, this being the second time, we’d see everyone again!” She continues:

“The designers were all very nice—while we tried to be as normal as we could. And they all stressed the abnormality of this situation for them too. One of the things that Phoebe said was that they were looking for passion, for something from the gut. Karl was very insightful—he thought there was something in us being Portuguese and seeing things in a fresh way. We gave everyone a booklet of images, pictures that are important to us and say something about us. Raf and Marc went through it and said it felt like we were doing something in a very authentic way. That was incredible for us, it was so important to have this feedback.”

Of course Marques’Almeida went on to win the prize this year. “It was much more about the honesty, the work and how our minds worked,” says Marques. “It was much more about this rather than numbers and figures related to our business.”

As to why there is such an idealistic approach to the LVMH Prize, Delphine Arnault answers simply, “We think as a leader of our industry it is our responsibility to find the talent and help them grow.” It is also a truly global way of thinking that stresses an ease of entry and a democracy in its approach. “That is why the prize is open to anybody around the world, providing they have made two collections and they are under 40,” says Arnault. “They can be based anywhere, there are no restrictions about the country a designer lives in or the city they show in, and it is really easy to apply on the internet. People can also apply again; the prize is also about rewarding progress. It really is to help without asking anything in exchange; it was an idea of giving back a little bit. After all, the designers give so much to us.”

As she then astutely points out, “The concept of a prize or contest, it is how Karl Lagerfeld started anyway. It was the prize he won with Saint Laurent.” The International Wool Secretariat Prize that both designers won in 1954—Lagerfeld for best coat and Saint Laurent for best dress—brought to attention the designers who essentially shaped the fashion world we live in today. The LVMH Prize might well have a hand in shaping the fashion world we live in tomorrow.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.997359573841095}",neutral,0.997359573841095,0
"Role Call | Faye McLeod, Visual Image Director - The Business of Fashion","Thu, 17 Dec 2015 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzb2ZmYXNoaW9uLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy93b3JrcGxhY2UtdGFsZW50L3JvbGUtY2FsbC1mYXllLW1jbGVvZC12aXN1YWwtaW1hZ2UtZGlyZWN0b3Iv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"There are few sectors of the economy that offer as wide and interesting a range of career opportunities as fashion. Role Call highlights some of the industry’s most interesting jobs and the talented people who do them. For more information about fashion industry roles like this and others, visit BoF Careers.

NEW YORK, United States — Faye McLeod is the visual image director at LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton. Glasgow-born McLeod earned a degree in fashion design at the city's Cardonald College, and, after graduation, swiftly moved into the domain of window and set design, working at Topshop and Selfridges. In 2009, McLeod joined Louis Vuitton as creative director of visual merchandising. Her first major production for the French fashion house was the opening of its New Bond Street maison in 2010, for which she created a 'Cabinet Curiosite' filled with creatures in glass jars.

In 2012, McLeod was promoted to visual image director of LVMH. Today, she oversees the windows for more than 460 stores globally, working with senior designer Ansel Thompson and a team of 23 people, planning the displays for stores such as Louis Vuitton and Dior as far as 12 months in advance.

BoF: Please describe your current role.

ADVERTISEMENT

First and foremost, I’m a dreamer and storyteller. As visual image director at LVMH, windows are how I communicate stories to the world. I aspire to engage people on the other side of the glass in an emotional way. Bringing together diverse groups of people (artists, designers, illustrators, scientists, engineers), I create teams that will research, design, develop and produce these windows.

Within my department, my daily task is to inspire, invent, challenge and break the rules. Within Louis Vuitton, my job is to work with the artistic directors, to support and interpret their vision. It's also essential to work with the CEO and our company's business leaders, to insure that we are supporting their overall business strategies and building the brand. We do not work inside a bubble.

BoF: What attracted you to window-dressing and set design?

Growing up in Glasgow, my mother owned a vintage shop and was always collecting all sorts of things. In retrospect, since a young age, I've been interested in the way objects can be arranged. My father is an engineer, so I've always been fascinated by how things are made and how they function. As I grew older, I learned about fashion designers and stylists, yet still never realised window-dressing was an actual profession. It was only after discovering the work of Linda Fargo at Bergdorf Goodman and Simon Doonan at Barneys, did I see the potential. Their work always had a sense of freedom and fun. Why wouldn't I want to do that?

Never forget that a good window, while innovative in idea, must also be practical and user-friendly.

BoF: What does building a good window installation involve? Where do you begin and what are the important things to consider?

It starts with a good idea, which can come from anyone and anywhere. These ideas are explored through images, sketches and study models (digital and analogue). As ideas are tested, we develop them into digital 3D models and renderings — or even 3D prints — to test the concept within the architecture of our windows. We never forget that a good window, while innovative in idea, must also be practical and user-friendly for the store staff.

These renderings and mock-ups are then presented to our artistic directors and business leaders. Only after many revisions, does the final window begin to take form. The technical aspects of production are also critical. When producing hundreds of windows around the world, which need to be unveiled in concert, it’s easy to lose the importance of quality. Our production team works in harmony with the design team to ensure we stay true to the creative vision.

BoF: What are some of your favourite places to find props and materials for your sets?

ADVERTISEMENT

The Internet! Google is an amazing tool. I have no specfic habits for shopping for props and looking for inspiration. I frequent Tokyu Hands, a massive household goods store in Shibuya, Tokyo; Chelsea furnishings boutique Mantiques Modern; Mokuba on Rue Montmartre; the Venusrox jeweller and Portobello Market in London's Notting Hill; and flea markets in Brooklyn and Paris.

BoF: What is the most exciting product or initiative you have worked on?

We worked on an incredible project with Frank Gehry, who constructed the Louis Vuitton Foundation in Paris and our store windows in New York City. We worked in his studio in Los Angeles, using specialised Gehry software and learning from the master himself. He really has an appreciation for windows, which comes from his father. Yayoi Kusama is another icon I've had the pleasure of working with. She welcomed us into her world and gave us the freedom to create her vision. She allowed us to dip her head in silicon with straws up her nose, so we could create a life-size Kusama for our maison's windows. Kusma spread such love in our windows, bringing with her a sense of humour and passion which we all value very much.

BoF: What advice do you have for people who are interested in doing what you do? What tools should people have?

There is no denying that digital media is changing the retail landscape in all kinds of ways, but this does not change the goal of a good window. What it presents, in fact, is an additional medium in which to do good windows! I like to think of digital screens as windows, with different design constraints and their own set of opportunities. The stories we can tell with this new medium are only limited by our imagination. It’s an exciting time for window-dressing. Discipline is a good way to begin honing your skills. Visit lots of stores and imagine how you could make them better.

LVMH's biggest watch brand Tag Heuer shutting its India office - The Economic Times,"Tue, 01 Dec 2015 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikgFodHRwczovL20uZWNvbm9taWN0aW1lcy5jb20vaW5kdXN0cnkvY29ucy1wcm9kdWN0cy9kdXJhYmxlcy9sdm1ocy1iaWdnZXN0LXdhdGNoLWJyYW5kLXRhZy1oZXVlci1zaHV0dGluZy1pdHMtaW5kaWEtb2ZmaWNlL2FydGljbGVzaG93LzQ5OTg5ODY5LmNtc9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"

NEW DELHI: Luxury group LVMH’s biggest watch brand Tag Heuer is shutting its India office, deciding to leverage its existing partnership with a local agent, two people familiar with the development said. By the end of December, LVMH will hand over distribution of Tag Heuer and Dior, its other watch brand, to a local company. The people cited above said sales at LVMH’s local watch division, LVMH Watch & Jewellery India, are sagging and the company sees its prospects further dimmed by the country’s tax structure.The company has so far been handling marketing, sales and distribution of these brands on its own. The development comes within weeks of the government easing its single-brand retailing policy to attract foreign companies to open their own stores. “After 15 years in the country and on 1st of January, LVMH watches division is closing down their subsidiary in India,” one of the persons said. The headquarters has seen what pictures they have been shown about India and what has been the actual reality.”Amit Chaloo, general manager for LVMH Watch, said the company will “leverage an existing partnership” with a local agent which also sells other watch brands. “The company’s decision to change distribution channel is purely based on dynamic re-deployment to meet ambitious business objectives. It has nothing to do with governments plan to clamp down on black money,” he said. The Tag Heuer office in Delhi will stay open for some time to ensure an orderly transition to the agent and to guarantee proper after sales service, Chaloo said.“Tag Heuer is exploring the best options for its employees. We will try our best to have internal mobility roles within brands in India for our employees,” he said. Entering the distribution model with Tag Heuer and Dior is Corum, another Swiss luxury watchmaker. “The market has not been growing for the past two years as there has been a slowdown,” said Sunil Grover, Corum’s regional director for South Asia.On whether the government’s move to curb black money has impacted business, he said, “People are a little wary whether to buy or not to buy even though the retailers are not asking for PAN cards, but people are generally cautious. They don’t want to be seen.” Indian retailers have been importing Corum watches and the Swiss company will now appoint a local distributor, Grover said, adding that the New Delhi liaison office will conduct functions, including marketing and finances. Only sales will be through the distribution model, he said.Dinaz Madhukar, head of mall Emporio, which houses brands such as Louis Vuitton, Gucci and Armani , said sales at luxury brands at the mall are higher compared with the previous year. “In fact, this year was much better than last year. This Diwali season has been really buoyant. The purchase trends are consistent,” she said. Tag Heuer, which has had actor Shah Rukh Khan as brand ambassador for years now, brought in Ranbir Kapoor last year to bump up appeal. But the company has not been able to arrest its losses in the country.“LVMH has been losing money in India. How long can you do it? Fifteen years is a long time and they don’t see any light at the end of the tunnel,” the person quoted earlier said. A staff at Tag Heuer’s head office at Nehru Place said the company is in the process of shifting its marketing, logistics and other departments, but the service centre will function for another year. Meanwhile, Paris-based luxury pen brand ST Dupont, that sold pens costing up to Rs 7.5 lakh, has shut its lone store in India in Delhi.The company had opened its store last year and was planning to add one in Mumbai. Gurinder Sahni, owner of Jot Impex that retails ST Dupont in India, was not reachable for comment.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999736547470093}",neutral,0.9999736547470093,0
Luxury fashion brands are going green. But why are they keeping it a secret? - The Washington Post,"Tue, 08 Dec 2015 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMitAFodHRwczovL3d3dy53YXNoaW5ndG9ucG9zdC5jb20vbGlmZXN0eWxlL3N0eWxlL2x1eHVyeS1mYXNoaW9uLWJyYW5kcy1hcmUtZ29pbmctZ3JlZW4tYnV0LXdoeS1hcmUtdGhleS1rZWVwaW5nLWl0LWEtc2VjcmV0LzIwMTUvMTIvMDgvZDNkOTM2NzgtOGM4YS0xMWU1LWFjZmYtNjczYWU5MmRkZDJiX3N0b3J5Lmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Gucci is having a renaissance. After years in the doldrums, the 94-year-old fashion house is again the star of glossy magazine spreads, its collections coveted by couture aficionados and celebrities, thanks to the eclectic runway shows masterminded by new creative director Alessandro Michele . Last month, its new boutique opened at CityCenterDC featuring storage units that resemble elegant steamer trunks and expansive tables designed to hold a trove of costly handbags. Lots of handbags. Because at its core, Gucci is an accessories label built on shoes and purses.

And that’s a problem. Not for the company’s bottom line, but for the environment.

Shoes and handbags mostly depend on leather. And cattle ranching consumes mass quantities of natural resources — from land to water. Traditional leather tanning uses heavy metals, most notably chromium, and the resulting waste is a health hazard. And PVC, another favored component in bag-making, is also an environmental contaminant.

So with little fanfare, this nearly $4 billion business has been making changes. The handbags — namely the trendy $2,400 flower-bedecked Dionysus shoulder bags stitched from the signature GG Supreme canvas print — now use polyurethane in their design rather than PVC.

But the marketing doesn’t highlight the switch; only the vaguest reference on the Gucci website notes that it is produced using an “earth-conscious process.”

The new green sensibility of Gucci represents the changing philosophy of its parent company, Kering — one of the largest luxury conglomerates in the world — and the luxury industry in general, including the biggest behemoth of them all, LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton. But Gucci’s reluctance to make that shift evident — let alone exciting or sexy for its consumers — highlights the unsettled relationship between the luxury business and eco-fashion.

The quiet changes at Kering and LVMH are laudable, experts say. But with its rapt audience of tastemakers and innovators — and its unique ability to create markets where none existed — luxury could do so much more.

If top-tier brands buffed, glossed and shared the story of how they responsibly manufacture products, they could even make eco-friendly as covetable as a designer logo — and transform the culture’s entire view of manufacturing that is good for the environment.

Paris — ground zero for luxury fashion — is serving as host to the United Nations Conference on Climate Change. Kering executives are sitting on multiple panels, while LVMH, a corporate sponsor of the conference, is firing off email blasts to its employees on ""green"" lessons learned.

“Sustainability” — maintaining a diverse bio-system while eliminating waste and pollution and decreasing energy consumption — is a hot topic in fashion, from Seventh Avenue to Europe. But it poses conundrums. Is it better for a Paris-based fashion company to use virgin paper produced in France for its runway show invitations? Or recycled paper from China? Can they just skip the fancy card stock and send evites?

Fashion schools are working a keener understanding of carbon footprints into their curriculums. There are green fashion contests challenging designers to make clothes that are both red-carpet glamourous and good for the planet. Countless brands now declare themselves eco-friendly, which can mean anything from using organic cotton in T-shirts to using solar power to heat their headquarters. Most are sportswear labels that lead with their self-declared ""green"" credentials rather than aesthetics; or hardy activewear companies, such as Patagonia, which offer handbooks for repairing — instead of replacing — damaged clothes.

But on the whole, green fashion is typically seen as “other.”

At the top of the fashion pyramid sit the luxury brands. In grand corporate offices, their executives speak of carbon credits, “cradle-to-cradle” supply chains and the exigency of preserving natural capital — the extravagant raw materials such as unmarred leather hides and long-fiber cotton on which their products rely.

These companies have natural eco-advantages over their mass-market rivals. They control more of their supply chain, such as tanneries. They have the resources to develop new production techniques. They tout the heirloom nature of their products, not their disposability. And their customers are less price-sensitive: Who’s counting pennies when spending thousands of dollars on a handbag?

“I honestly think the brands are doing what they’re doing because they think it’s good business” — a way to preserve the quality of the natural resources they rely upon, says Gemma Cranston, of the Cambridge Institute for Sustainability Leadership, which has worked with Kering and Hugo Boss. “They just see it as a step they now need to take to continue to produce high-quality garments.”

The Paris-based LVMH, which controls Louis Vuitton, Céline, Givenchy, Christian Dior and Fendi, among other luxury brands, began to focus on sustainable business practices in 1992 in its wine and spirits division. This fall, LVMH announced the creation of a carbon fund that each brand pays into based on its energy consumption. The approximately $5.3 million fund supports projects such as upgrades from traditional lighting to LED.

In June, Kering released its first Environmental Profit and Loss Report, examining where in its chain of more than 1,000 suppliers in 126 countries lurk the largest and gravest impacts on the environment. Looking at all its labels — from the silk T-shirts and motorcycle jackets of Saint Laurent to the sports gear of Puma — Kering measured water consumption, air pollution, greenhouse gas emissions and land use. It then translated these findings into euros to estimate how much the production of, say, a single leather handbag costs the environment: 11.85 euros last year, or about $12.53.

In 2013, Kering’s luxury goods cost the environment about $817 million. (A similar conglomerate, operating without environmental restraint, would have put a strain of $1.2 billion on the planet, according to PricewaterhouseCoopers.) In 2014, that environmental cost ticked upwards by 2.2 percent to $838 million — while revenue grew by 4.5 percent.

Kering posted this data online so other manufacturers could learn from their lessons. “When you are speaking about sustainability, if you keep it all for you, you won’t change the paradigm,” says Marie-Claire Daveu, Kering’s chief sustainability officer.

The Kering report also revealed that only seven percent of the company’s environmental impact was at its boutiques, headquarters and warehouses. Fifty percent came from the production of raw materials. And 25 percent was from processing those materials. The most significant impact included the greenhouse gases from cattle ranching and the land and water dedicated to traditional sheep farming.

The goal is not to ban wool or leather but to find more environment-friendly ways to produce it. Kering and LVMH, for example, are moving away from traditional tanning methods that use chromium.

But bright candy colors typically cannot be produced without using heavy metals, says Sylvie Bénard, corporate environment director at LVMH. There’s also a concern with color stability. A customer can’t get caught in a rainstorm and find her handbag dripping dye onto her cashmere trousers. Gucci developed an organic tanning technique and in 2013, began using it to produce special-order, bamboo-handled bags. Louis Vuitton’s Gaia Monogram Cerise handbags now use vegetable-tanned leather.

Yet for all the openness expressed at the corporate level — Kering even tied executive bonuses to meeting sustainability goals — fashion is still fashion. It's driven by desire, not environmental awareness or even logic.

Almost none of these brands weave sustainability into the mysterious magic of luxury fashion. Stella McCartney, known for her no-leather stance, is a rare exception. Her eponymous brand, part of Kering, sells fashion wrapped in an environmental sensitivity detailed throughout the company’s marketing.

More common is the situation at Saint Laurent. Corporate executives herald the use of energy-efficient LED lights in its boutiques. Yet when designer Hedi Slimane presented his Saint Laurent collection in Paris in October, he installed a dynamic light display — flashing with a near-blinding intensity — at the top of the runway.

Did he use LED lights, too? And were those lights reused after the show, which lasted barely 15 minutes?

“They are very secret about their fashion shows and would not like to answer any questions,” explains Marie-Laure Vaganay, a corporate spokeswoman.

And after Gucci invested years of research into developing a non-toxic leather tanning process, will examples of that leather be available to customers in its newest store? The answer is murky: Maybe. No. Probably not.

The story of sustainability is not trickling down to the product level, says Robert Burke, founder of the New York retail consultancy that bears his name. “Consumers look at luxury brands for exclusivity, quality and status. I’m not sure where sustainability fits in that pecking order.”

Consumers have been more vocal about labor practices and fair compensation, galvanized by scandals such as the fatal 2013 Rana Plaza factory collapse in Bangladesh. Yet, shoppers still gravitate to impossible bargains. It’s even harder to imagine them getting worked up about contaminated groundwater.

In the calculation to spend $5,490 for a washed-leather Saint Laurent motorcycle jacket, environmental awareness is not a selling point. And luxury brands are not attempting to make it one.

Daveu quotes her boss, Kering chief executive François-Henri Pinault: “We don’t do sustainability to please the customer and sell more bags. We do this because we have no other option. It’s a business and leadership opportunity.”

But if you're going to sell bags anyway, wouldn't promoting your more environmentally-sound bags be both good business and good leadership?

The prevailing image of “green” fashion — with its connotations of nubby fabrics and crunchy-granola styling — muddies the carefully crafted message of luxury fashion. Luxury consumers are drawn by romantic visions of skilled artisans at work over handmade oxfords. They are wooed by the irresistible notion of cool.

Is green fashion cool? Or simply good for you? Listening to someone brag about a new eco-friendly sweater is about as thrilling as a conversation about air filters. The Internet isn’t melting down from a run on sustainable textiles the way it is from the frenzy over shiny Balmain shirts.

But perhaps it could.

High-minded chefs pushed sustainability into the lexicon of every farm-to-table foodie. Toyota made hybrids cool. Tesla made electric cars glamourous.

“The role of luxury brands is to start a conversation and to create desire,” says Kwesi Blair, senior vice president of new business at Robert Burke Associates. “The biggest challenge? How do they want to make this topic — which hasn’t been sexy — sexy?”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999737739562988}",neutral,0.9999737739562988,0

Sound like the dream? For BA&SH it's the trajectory of its business. Founders Barbara Boccara and Sharon Krief (the label takes the first two letters of their names), are naturally counting their blessings, but openly admit that they weren't seeking out a partner before the deal with L Capital - the private-equity subsidiary of LVMH - was made. ""If it was not for L Capital, we would have remained some time without a partner,"" Boccara told us. ""We didn't want anything to change - our DNA, our team and so on. Our balance was, and is, very important to us."" For L Capital, the decision to bring BA&SH into its stable was one driven by the label's ""original fashion content, honest price and selective and highly qualitative distribution"" that it believes is the ""current and future customer expectation"". [GalleryThumbnails##KeepInline] ""BA&SH is a genuine contemporary designer apparel proposition with enormous potential for international development. It's a new and fresh fashion proposition on the contemporary space,"" explained Eduardo Velasco, partner at L Capital, adding that its strategy is to identify brands that are unique and ""help them structure themselves to develop on the long term"" It's a strategy that has been quickly implemented since the acquisition earlier this year, according to Boccara who told us that L Capital has already accelerated the brands international development using its knowledge and expertise. But a global presence doesn't mean following global trends, Krief outlined. ""Since the beginning, we wanted to add to our collections our own vision of fashion and style, without attaching the importance to global trends,"" she told us. ""Moreover, the style signature has evolved around the concept of the ideal wardrobe: everyday pieces made of sumptuous fabrics with the right balance between femininity and sophistication."" It's not just L Capital that have bought into the aesthetic. Bar Refaeli, Charlotte Casaraghi, Melanie Laurent and Constance Jablonski are all fans, and will no doubt be queuing up when BA&SH's line of accessories launches next year - something made possible by the investment. ""We already have the perfect clothing line so we want to evolve out accessories offering,"" enthused Boccara, before Krief chimed in: ""High-end accessories - we're so excited!""

The private equity arm of Louis Vuitton Moët Hennessy ( LVMH ), the world’s largest luxury goods conglomerate, plans to sell its stake in ethnic wear retailer Fabindia Overseas, two people with knowledge of the matter said. L Capital is targeting $100 million (Rs 660 crore) for its 8% holding in the unlisted Indian company, more than four times the investment it made in 2012. “L Capital had approached some advisers about two months back for determining the valuation of its stake in Fabindia. Now they are looking for an exit,” said an adviser who was approached by the PE firm.It has so far contacted at least four potential buyers: Singapore government-owned Temasek, and PE firms Actis, Apax Partners and the Carlyle Group , the second person said. The process has just started and the PE players are looking at it, he said. “It is expected that the negotiations could happen only by late next month.”Apax and Carlyle didn’t respond to emails seeking comment. Spokespeople for Temasek, Actis and Fabindia, as well as L Capital Asia Regional Managing Director Sanjay Gujral said they don’t comment on market speculation.L Capital bought the stake in 2012 from Wolfensohn Capital Partners for Rs 150 crore, at the time valuing the company at Rs 1,875 crore. If L Capital gets the price it is looking for, the deal will value Fabindia at about Rs 8,200 crore.There was a clause in the 2012 deal allowing Fabindia to buy back the stake at a certain performance-based price if L Capital wanted to exit but couldn’t find a buyer, the first person said. “The valuations are pegged as per that,” he said, explaining the reason for the steep jump in the valuation.New Delhi-based Fabindia has more than 200 stores in 79 locations. It has a customer base of 3 million, which it wants to expand to 10 million in threefour years.“In terms of same-store sales and absolute growth, Fabindia has done quite well in the past three-four years. In terms of profitability, it’s among the best retail businesses in the country,” said Arvind Singhal, chairman of consultancy firm Technopak Advisors.“The company has successfully created a strong brand in a largely unorganised market and its sourcing network and loyalty base give it a competitive advantage,” said Abheek Singhi, senior partner at The Boston Consulting Group.Fabindia is the only Indian company where L Capital has an investment. According to the people cited earlier, the PE firm was looking to invest in two other Indian fashion companies as well, but the deals didn’t go through due to valuation issues.ET reported this month that the family-run LVMH, which houses brands such as Louis Vuitton, Christian Dior and Moët Hennessy, will hand over distribution of its watch brands Tag Heuer and Dior in India to a local agent owing to sagging sales. France-based LVMH stated in October that it recorded an 18% increase in global revenue, reaching 25.3 billion euros, for the first nine months of 2015.The company said it would continue with its strategy focused on targetted geographic expansion in the most promising markets in an uncertain economic and financial environment.L Capital invested in Fabindia through its $640-million Asia fund, whose other investments include Pepe Jeans , Princess Yachts and Grant.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.999994158744812}",neutral,0.999994158744812,0
