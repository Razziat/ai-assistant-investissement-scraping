Grace Wales Bonner Takes LVMH Prize - WWD,"Thu, 16 Jun 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3dkLmNvbS9mZWF0dXJlL2dyYWNlLXdhbGVzLWJvbm5lci1sdm1oLXByaXplLTEwNDU3NjI3L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS — Are inflated and noisy street-influenced fashions giving way to something quieter, more introspective?

On Thursday, an all-star jury handed the third annual LVMH Prize to London-based designer Grace Wales Bonner, a maker of calm, soulful – and androgynous — men’s wear.

“It was quite unanimous. I love her vision,” said Nicolas Ghesquière, creative director of women’s collections at Louis Vuitton, who shared jury duty with the likes of Karl Lagerfeld, Marc Jacobs, Givenchy’s Riccardo Tisci and Céline’s Phoebe Philo. “The clothes are really well made also. Her universe is very strong.”

“I think she has something very interesting to say, and it feels like she has a lot more to say,” added Philo, describing clothes that practically narrate Wales Bonner’s upbringing in southeast London, raised by a Jamaican father and an English mother. “I went to school with girls like Grace. You can see she’s figuring that out through her fashion.”

Philo said Wales Bonner, 25, recounted her background and political viewpoints during her 10-minute presentation. The 2014 graduate of Central Saint Martins said her work explores representations of black male sexuality and identity, which she backs up with research spanning critical theory, literature and history.

“Her clothes are great. Everyone felt that women want to wear that stuff and it’s men’s wear,” Philo said of prim tailoring with an empire flare and silky shirts and pants, the collars and waistbands dabbed with crochet.

While her clothes are already carried in stores including Matchesfashion.com, LN-CC, Joyce, 10 Corso Como and Ssence, Wales Bonner operates her business with only one other collaborator.

She is to receive a grant of 300,000 euros, or $336,525 at current exchange rates, plus a year of coaching from executives at LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, the world’s largest luxury group and sponsor of the prize.

The petite designer told WWD she would use the prize money to “build out her team” and use LVMH coaching to “figure out how I can scale the business up.”

Actress Léa Seydoux, poured into a tight black dress with an asymmetric hem, handed Wales Bonner a gold star trophy during a brief ceremony at the Louis Vuitton Foundation, a Frank Gehry-designed art museum on the leafy fringes of Paris now decked out in colorful panels courtesy of artist Daniel Buren.

Behind Seydoux stood Ghesquière, Philo, Lagerfeld, Tisci and the rest of the jury: Jonathan Anderson, Kenzo creative directors Humberto Leon and Carol Lim; Delphine Arnault, second-in-command at Vuitton; Pierre-Yves Roussel, chairman and chief executive officer of LVMH Fashion Group, and Jean-Paul Claverie, an adviser to LVMH chairman Bernard Arnault and LVMH’s head of corporate philanthropy.

Wales Bonner beat out seven finalists. They were Tuomas Merikoski, the Finnish designer behind the women’s wear label Aalto; Glenn Martens, the Belgian behind men’s and women’s collections for Y/Project; Christelle Kocher, a French designer who creates her Koché collections for both genders; Hiromichi Ochiai, based in Tokyo and designing under the Facetasm label; Matthew Williams, whose women’s wear carries the Alyx label; Brandon Maxwell, who has a signature women’s line, and Canadian wunderkind Vejas Kruszewski, 19, who makes collections for women and men under the Vejas label.

Kruszewski was handed a special jury prize, which comes with 150,000 euros, or $168,260, and one year of coaching. Ghesquière noted he and other jurors were dazzled by the youngster’s accomplishments – and steely determination.

Launched in 2013 and spearheaded by Delphine Arnault, a key talent scout at the luxury group her family controls, the international competition is open to designers under age 40 who have presented and sold at least two collections of men’s or women’s ready-to-wear.

About 1,000 designers threw their hats into the ring this year, applying for an honor that has boosted the careers of Thomas Tait and Marta Marques and Paulo Almeida, the Portuguese duo behind the Marques’Almeida label — the first two winners of the grand prize — along with Hood by Air’s Shayne Oliver, Simon Porte Jacquemus and Nikita and Tina Sutradhar for Miuniku, recipients of special prizes from LVMH, parent of fashion houses including Fendi, Givenchy, Berluti, Loro Piana and Kenzo.

Maxwell pointed to a swollen eyelid behind his Céline eyeglasses as an indicator of a high stress level, tinged with excitement. Using frequent-flyer points, he flew in his mother, Pam, from Longview, Tex., and dressed her in one of his sculptural jackets.

“She got her first passport. I’m taking her to the Eiffel Tower later to take her picture in front of it,” he said.

Echoing other finalists who stood by racks of their designs in the museum’s soaring auditorium, Maxwell said the competition brought invaluable exposure to all participants.

“It’s helped us very, very much. Oftentimes when you just start out, it’s hard to get people to look at you,” he said. “I feel like the response has just been great.”

The atmosphere grew increasingly electric as the famous jurors filed in, embracing each other and falling into conversation about the judging task ahead of them.

“We always get into a heated debate over lunch about what the criteria is for giving this prize. I guess it’s just what you like the most in the end,” Jacobs shrugged.

Philo confessed she is often swayed by personality, commending the young talents for making their presentations before the 10-minute buzzer goes off.

“It’s very intimidating,” she said. “I just enjoy hearing them talk.”

“I think the most important thing is originality. I like the ones that are taking a risk. Business? You have all the time to build it,” mused Tisci. “Today, you need to not only sell clothing; you need to sell a dream. You have to forge an identity. It’s different today for designers than even 10 years ago.”

“It has to be an original standpoint – and have a business structure behind it,” countered Anderson, who designs the J.W. Anderson and Loewe labels under the LVMH umbrella. “It’s a balance between creativity and business acumen.”

Asked if he judges the clothes themselves or the concept behind them, Lagerfeld retorted: “A good idea poorly done is worth nothing.”

But like Philo, he said he battles objectivity. “My problem is there are people that I like and I’m influenced by that,” he said.

For example, he knows Kocher well as artistic director of Maison Lemarié, a maker of feathers and flowers owned by Chanel through its subsidiary Paraffection. “She’s a divine person, very gifted,” he said.

“Validation” was a word finalists used repeatedly, lauding the prize for spurring them on in a competitive field.

“It gives a lot of confirmation,” said Martens, standing by a rack of urban basics tinged with Elizabethan grandeur that included a pair of jeans so long that the pant legs coiled on the floor like snakes. He explained the they could be turned up to the hipbone, or scrunched around the calves.

Participating in the prize can also help boost business. “We multiplied the sales by four last season, and we got a lot of exposure in the press,” Kocher smiled.

“The vision is really important,” said Delphine Arnault. “The product needs to be really special, and really stand out because there’s tough competition. It’s also important how they foresee the future.”

The executive stressed most of the participants are hungry for coaching.

“The designers always have so many questions about how to best produce their collections and develop their business,” she said. “It’s one of the big assets of the prize.”

Arnault also handed out 10,000 euro ($11,145) scholarships to three fashion graduates, who each get a one-year post in the design studio of a fashion house at LVMH. Their schools also pocket a like-value grant. The winners are: Francesca Ricchiardi from Accademia Costume & Moda in Rome, Ayo Keys from Parsons The New School of Design in New York and Beth Hall from Westminster University. They will be placed at Fendi, Marc Jacobs and Loewe, respectively.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999828338623047}",neutral,0.9999828338623047,0

The winner was selected from a shortlist of eight brands: Aalto, Alyx, Brandon Maxwell, Facetasm, Koché, Vejas, Wales Bonner and Y/Project. The decision was made by a jury of industry figures, comprising designers Jonathan Anderson, Nicolas Ghesquière, Marc Jacobs, Karl Lagerfeld, Humberto Leon, Carol Lim, Phoebe Philo and Riccardo Tisci, and Delphine Arnault, Jean-Paul Claverie and Pierre-Yves Roussel of LVMH.

A Special Prize was also awarded to Vejas, the Toronto-based label helmed by 19 year-old Canadian designer Vejas Kruszewski, the youngest designer to ever be nominated for the LVMH Prize. He receives a grant of €150,000 and year-long mentorship from the LVMH group.

The LVMH Prize was launched in 2014. The 2014 and 2015 Prizes were both won by London-based designers: Thomas Tait and Marques'Almeida, respectively. This year marks the third time in a row the Prize has been awarded to a London-based label helmed by graduates from Central Saint Martins.

Last year, French designer Jacquemus received a Special Prize, while in 2014 two Special Prizes were awarded to Hood by Air and Miuniku.

Balmain, a mostly wholesale business, was sold to Mayhoola for Investments after having attracted bids from several other private equity funds, including L Capital, an investment firm backed by the European luxury conglomerate LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton.

Mayhoola “will allow the brand to accelerate its development, notably with the opening of new stores abroad,” Bucéphale Finance, the Paris-based boutique mergers and acquisitions firm that advised Balmain shareholders, said in a statement Tuesday evening. The sale will also fund the expansion of Balmain’s accessories business.

“After completing this transaction, Mayhoola for Investments will hold 100 percent of Balmain’s capital,” the statement added.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999610185623169}",neutral,0.9999610185623169,0

First launched in November 2013, the LVMH Prize for Young Fashion Designers is open to any designer under 40 who has created and commercialized at least two ready-to-wear menswear or womenswear collections. For the third edition of the prize, twenty three young designers were longlisted and presented their collection in front of a jury of industry professionals composed, among others, of Emanuelle Alt, editor-in-chief of Vogue Paris, Suzy Menkes, International Vogue Editor, Karlie Kloss and Patrick Demarchelier. The shortlist went on to a final which included Aalto by Tuomas Merikoski, Alyx by Matthew Williams, Brandon Maxwell by Brandon Maxwell, Facetasm by Hiromichi Ochiai, Koché by Christelle Kocher, Vejas by Vejas Kruszewski, Wales Bonner by Grace Wales Bonner and Y/Project by Glenn Martens. Today, the work of the eight finalists was considered by a jury composed of nine creative directors of the LVMH luxury group: J. W. Anderson, Nicolas Ghesquière, Marc Jacobs, Karl Lagerfeld, Humberto Leon, Carol Lim, Phoebe Philo and Riccardo Tisci as well as Delphine Arnault, Jean-Paul Claverie (Bernard Arnault’s advisor and LVMH head of sponsorship) and Pierre-Yves Roussel (CEO and chairman of LVMH). This year, Grace Wales Bonner took away the prestigious prize, which includes a €300,000 grant as well as personalized mentoring for the development of her fashion label from the LVMH group. Runner up Vejas Kruszewski has also received a grant of €100,000 and a year of mentoring for his label Vejas. Grace Wales Bonner recently presented her Spring/Summer 2017 show during London Collections: Men. Her unique fashion vision redefines the codes of black masculinity with an African-inspired aesthetic. Having already bagged the prize for best young menswear designer at the British Fashion Awards, 2016 is certainly set to be big for Grace Wales Bonner.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999991655349731}",neutral,0.9999991655349731,0
Grace Wales Bonner: 'I Want to Focus on Growing the Team' - The Business of Fashion,"Thu, 16 Jun 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiggFodHRwczovL3d3dy5idXNpbmVzc29mZmFzaGlvbi5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvbmV3cy1hbmFseXNpcy9ncmFjZS13YWxlcy1ib25uZXItbHZtaC1wcml6ZS13aW5uZXItaS13YW50LXRvLWZvY3VzLW9uLWdyb3dpbmctdGhlLXRlYW0v0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS, France — Maybe it was a sign of things to come. While getting a closer look at Grace Wales Bonner's collection, Marc Jacobs told her how much he loved the jacket she was wearing, which featured Wales Bonner's signature cowrie shell and crystal embroidery. Delphine Arnault, executive vice president of Louis Vuitton and the woman behind the LVMH Prize, agreed. A few hours later, Bonner became the third winner of the LVMH Prize, receiving €300,000 and a year's worth of mentoring.

Bonner is most prominent in menswear (she has recently started adapting some pieces for women) and her work has aimed to show a soft and sensual vision of blackness, which is often associated with aggressiveness in the wider culture. She is admired for her emotional presentations, her choice of beautiful, black male models and her ability to meld Western tailoring with influences from Africa, India, or — most recently — the Caribbean. Another aspect of her design is what she calls ""hybridity,"" an aspiration to allow different cultures to coexist on their own terms in fashion design, evident in her latest collection for Spring/Summer 2017, which she showed during London Collections: Men. Doing research on Joseph Boulogne, Chevalier de Saint-Georges, an 18th century composer and violinist from Guadeloupe, she was attracted to the idea of creative men like him, who were integrated into European culture but were able to bring something of their original culture into their work — and dress.

On how she plans to use the prize money, Wales Bonner said: “I first want to focus on growing the team and to look after the people that have been working with me out of love. But I don't want to change my path. I had a very clear view of what I do before this, and that's not going to change. I will continue to show in London,” she assured anyone afraid of possible plans for relocation. “I think that there are so many great designers there right now and I want to be a part of that moment.”

While several of the young designers talked about the seal of approval they felt in being shortlisted by the jury — comprising designers Jonathan Anderson, Nicolas Ghesquière, Marc Jacobs, Karl Lagerfeld, Humberto Leon, Carol Lim, Phoebe Philo and Riccardo Tisci, along with Delphine Arnault, Jean-Paul Claverie and Pierre-Yves Roussel of LVMH and a panel of forty additional experts, Bonner explained that she thought ""you have to get validation from yourself and the work itself. For me it's more about the research and a new way of presenting masculinity.""

“Grace Wales Bonner has a unique vision and point of view,” said Arnault. “And the work that she does on the tailoring is very interesting. The way she uses the embroidery, the cuts are perfect. But the jury also thinks that she has a great potential in womenswear.” Bonner is the third Central Saint Martins graduate to win the main LVMH prize, with Arnault acknowledging that London has amazing schools, with many fashion designers in the luxury group have studied in the British capital.

At the announcement, Arnault revealed that this year the jury had also decided to award a Special Prize because of how “intense” the competition was. This went to the 19-year-old, self-taught Vejas Kruszewski, based in Toronto, Canada, who walked off with €150,000 as well as mentoring from LVMH executives. Kruszewski described his off-beat designs as “starting with familiar garments and then twisting them a bit.”

There’s an of-the-moment quality to the slightly unisex garments and Vejas showed a selection of pieces from the last three collections to the jury. “[Jury members] Humberto Leon and Carol Lim are stocking six of the eight finalists, and they said Vejas has amazing sell-through, so he has a unique point of view but also a client — someone is buying the clothes,” said Arnault.

For his part, Kruszewski said the runner-up prize opened up new options for what the brand might do and mentioned wanting to expand into new product categories, but on his mind right after his win was “a nap, then dinner.”

The first LVMH Prize winner in 2014, Thomas Tait, was said to be chosen because of a belief that the money and the coaching would make a big difference to the designer, while the 2015 winners Marques' Almeida already had a business and needed to build more of a team. For both previous winners, though, the prize seems to have spawned a more focused, professional approach. ""[Winning the prize] gave me a chance to see my brand from a bird's eye view,"" Tait explained in a text message. ""Working with LVMH can be a refreshing and highly motivating experience and an insightful view of the corporate side of the industry.""

In a crowded field, the LVMH Prize has quickly established itself as one of the most important fashion awards in the business. Partly, it is because of those four capitalised letters, but at the same time, the fact that the jury consists of the most revered designers of today also gives the prize a certain edge. As well, nearly all the designers in attendance today singled out the mentoring component as the most alluring aspect of the prize.

While Tait’s business has yet to take off, Marta Marques and Pablo Almeida told BoF that the impact of winning the prize last year had been very clear. “Sales doubled and the team grew three times,” the designers said. “It also bought us time to focus on the design.” At the same time the mentoring meant that “boring questions” like “Where do you find a warehouse?” could be discussed with someone with a proper knowledge of the supply chain. (A chat with the mentor and senior vice president of fashion ventures at LVMH, Sophie Brocart, revealed that the designers sometimes ask very specific questions like what kind of coding system to use for garments.)

So according to the winner herself, why did she triumph this year? Grace Wales Bonner, a highly cerebral young designer, said: “I think my work resonates with people and that my kind of emotional dressing translates to them in a broad way.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9998657703399658}",neutral,0.9998657703399658,0

Uday Mehra said in Singapore court documents that he had raised his concerns over alleged behaviour at LVMH’s regional private equity fund, L Capital Asia Advisors, such as raising profit projections for an investment target to generate illegitimate gains in a separate fund. Mehra also alleges that L Capital’s head made an acquisition despite opposition from his investment team and without proper due diligence. Mehra claims that the firm conspired to fire him in a bid to “stifle the embarrassment"" that would have been caused by a full and effective probe into his whistle-blowing.

L Capital, which denies Mehra’s claims, makes average investments of $30 million to $150 million in Asian lifestyle brands and has had other business quarrels play out in court, filings show. The co-founder of Jones the Grocer, a gourmet food retailer, sued an L Capital unit last year, claiming it discriminated against minorities. Last month, a businessman accused the fund and others of stealing his share of profits after selling a club formerly known as Ku De Ta, the 57th-floor bar at the top of Singapore’s Marina Bay Sands hotel. L Capital is defending itself in both the lawsuits, which are ongoing.

‘X-Factor’

Mehra is seeking at least $37.5 million, which he claims is his entitled payout for the share of profits he would have earned at one of the funds if he hadn’t been terminated, according to a lawsuit filed in the Singapore High Court in March. Mehra, who said in court filings that he was described in fundraising documents as a “key resource"" and as the fund’s “X-factor,"" says he reported 11 deals from 2012 to 2014 that gave him serious cause for concern.

Mehra claims his concerns were ignored. Instead, he said he was sidelined from investment meetings and his working relationship with the unit’s head, Ravi Thakran, worsened. Reasons given for his firing, including not attending meetings in Singapore, were “excuses"" and he was being punished for whistle-blowing, Mehra said in court papers.

“I felt extremely shocked and aggrieved as to the manner in which I was treated within L Capital Asia whilst attempting to uphold the interest of our investors and dispense my duties in a professional manner,"" Mehra said through his lawyers at RHTLaw Taylor Wessing Llp.

L Capital denied wrongdoing and said in its defense filed last month that it fired Mehra in June 2015 for misconduct and insubordination. The firm said that Mehra’s complaint was frivolous and that his concerns were independently reviewed and probed by LVMH. Mehra’s alleged whistle-blowing was a red herring and had nothing to do with his termination, L Capital said. The firm said Mehra failed to subscribe for his share of a profit pool and wasn’t entitled to it, according to court papers.

“L Capital takes a serious view of the allegations made by this former employee, whose employment was terminated in 2015. Our clients consider these allegations to be baseless, and intend to vigorously resist his claim in the Singapore Courts to the fullest extent,"" said lawyer Alvin Yeo at WongPartnership Llp, who said he represented both L Capital and Thakran.

Mehra was fired for alleged breach of contract, trust and confidence, L Capital said in court documents. The executive misused confidential information and forwarded e-mails to his personal account, according to court papers.

“The L Capital Asia Group and the LVMH Group takes a serious view on governance issues,"" according to the defense. “No wrongdoing was disclosed.""

"Grace Wales Bonner, LVMH Prize Winner, Inspired From Senegal To Harlem - Harlem World Magazine","Sat, 18 Jun 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhhcmxlbXdvcmxkbWFnYXppbmUuY29tL2dyYWNlLXdhbGVzLWJvbm5lci1sdm1oLXByaXplLXdpbm5lci1pbnNwaXJlZC1mcm9tLXNlbmVnYWwtdG8taGFybGVtL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Grace Wales Bonner was born in London to an English mother and Jamaican father. She attributes much of her Afrofuturist style influence to her roots, exploring black male identity in her collections. She graduated from Central Saint Martins last year with a B.A. in fashion, winning the L’Oreal design award for a collection that mixed “influences of Coco Chanel with blaxploitation films and African craft techniques”, whether it be through research trips to Senegal or exhibits in Harlem.

Wales Bonner is known for her African-inspired pieces, pulling from western and colonial visions, as well as a history of Africans in India, to create her own line of suits and sportswear. Her LVMH winning collection was designed looking to the Emperor of Ethiopia. She drew from Caribbean, East and West African, as well as European influences. She fights against the general white-washing so often overlooked in the fashion industry by weaving her heritage, different histories, and a fresh perspective of black male sexuality and identity into each collection. She even shows her clothes on exclusively black and South Asian models to further the story her different collections are portraying.

Grace Wales Bonner designs contemporary menswear (and some womenswear!) to a long international stock list including Matches and LNCC in London, Opening Ceremony and V Files in New York, as well as Wildstyle and Opening Ceremony in Los Angeles. Each piece is made to order, including a short-sleeved polo as well as button-down, a velvet cardigan, and a Swarovski and cowrie shell skull cap.

Being the first individual female and first menswear designer to win the LVMH award is a big deal, but by no means the first accomplishment for Grace Wales Bonner. Her graduate collection for Central Saint Martins in 2014, called Afrique, won the L’Oréal Professional Talent Award. Her dissertation “Black on Black” was personally commended by the Dean of Central Saint Martins as well. After debuting Ebonics A/W 15 with Fashion East at London Collections: Mens (which received critical acclaim), she was invited to the V&A’s prestigious Fashion in Motion program. In 2015 she received the Emerging Menswear Designer award at the British Fashion Awards.

A view of her pieces are also available on her website, walesbonner.net, for pre-order.
