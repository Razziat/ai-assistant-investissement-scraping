LVMH to invest $80 million into K-pop giant YG Entertainment - Dazed,"Fri, 22 Aug 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhemVkZGlnaXRhbC5jb20vbXVzaWMvYXJ0aWNsZS8yMTM3OC8xL2x2bWgtdG8taW52ZXN0LTgwLW1pbGxpb24taW50by1rLXBvcC1naWFudC15Zy1lbnRlcnRhaW5tZW500gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LVMH is gearing up to enter the K-pop market. The world's largest luxury goods giant – which owns Louis Vuitton, Dior and Fendi – is about to invest $80 million in YG Entertainment, the South Korean hit factory that represents huge stars like 2NE1, BIGBANG and PSY.

According to Reuters, the deal will help YG expand into fashion and the two companies are also considering a strategic partnership. It's just more proof that the South Korean pop culture wave known as hallyu is gathering even more momentum – while there's no doubt that top-tier YG talent like G-Dragon and CL are true style originals, their agency has yet to make a dent in the fashion industry proper.

That look set to change with the LVMH deal. LVMH's private equity branch L. Capital Asia will buy new shares worth $60 million, and is angling to purchase another $20 million of shares from YG founder Yang Hyun-suk. The deal will see the luxury giant become YG's second biggest shareholder.

This isn't the first time LVMH have backed K-pop in a big way – in 2009, Louis Vuitton became the first luxury brand to sponsor a South Korean singer when they partnered up with BIGBANG member G-Dragon for his solo album release.

K-pop fans won't have to wait too long to see what YG Entertainment have in store, though. The business is already set to launch a fashion brand called NONA9ON with Samsung on September 9. Mysterious promo videos haven't revealed much about the label (beyond sending excitable K-pop fans into a frenzy), but early reports say that the line will be inspired by streetwear and hip-hop.

"Delphine Arnault, Fashion's First Daughter, Is Bringing Fresh Talent to LVMH - W Magazine","Fri, 22 Aug 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiNWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndtYWdhemluZS5jb20vc3RvcnkvZGVscGhpbmUtYXJuYXVsdC1sdm1o0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"If the Supreme Court were crossed with Project Runway and transported to the elite fashion world, the result might look something like the scene in the atrium of the LVMH headquarters in Paris on this bright morning in May. Shayne Oliver, the creator of the avant-garde street-wear label Hood by Air, is so nervous that he’s concerned he might faint, while 10 other up-and-comers—finalists in the competition for the first annual LVMH Prize for Young Fashion Designers—are trying to mask their anxiousness, with varying degrees of success. The tension is understandable, given that each of them is about to be cross-examined by a panel of the world’s top fashion designers, all employed by the French luxury conglomerate. Filing in to take their seats at a long Inquisition-style table are Karl Lagerfeld (Fendi), Raf Simons (Dior), Nicolas Ghesquière (Louis Vuitton), Riccardo Tisci (Givenchy), Marc Jacobs (Marc Jacobs), Phoebe Philo (Céline), and Humberto Leon (Kenzo), along with three senior LVMH executives. In a moment, the doors will close and the finalists, having already shown their latest collections to the judges, will get exactly 10 minutes to make a pitch and answer questions; the winner will go home with 300,000 euros, a year’s worth of professional coaching from LVMH, and an invaluable dose of public exposure.

The young designers are not the only ones being judged today, however. At the center of the table, in a white Louis Vuitton dress cinched by a black leather belt, is the woman who dreamed up this competition, Delphine Arnault. Plenty of eyes would be on Arnault regardless of her role in the proceedings—partly because she’s a strikingly poised blonde who stands several inches taller than most everyone around her, and partly because she’s the daughter of Bernard Arnault, the chairman and CEO of LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton and the richest man in France. But this event marks a kind of debut for the reserved Delphine, who, like her father, tends to take the spotlight only when necessary. That is, when it’s good for business.

“It’s hard to know what Delphine is thinking,” says Suno codesigner Erin Beatty, another finalist, before adding hastily, “I think that’s probably a good quality in a businessperson.”

One immediate sign of Arnault’s clout is the presence of the seven star designers in the same room today. “When Delphine tells you to go somewhere, you go,” Lagerfeld quips. In fact, Arnault and her team spent more than a year coordinating schedules and working out the logistics of this affair. Astonishingly, this is the first time ever that LVMH’s top designers have all been together in one room, and some of them hardly know one another. When Philo walks in, Arnault smoothly reintroduces her to Lagerfeld, whom Philo has met only once before. (“We are both former victims of Chloé,” Lagerfeld jokes.) As deputies fret about whether the vases of pink flowers are placed properly and whether all the panelists will show up on time—“Nicolas is three minutes away!” says one, looking up from his smartphone—Arnault stands coolly, greeting the nominees and showing no signs of stress.

Since last year, when she was named executive vice president at Louis Vuitton—a post that gives her oversight of women’s and men’s ready-to-wear, in addition to accessories and jewelry, at LVMH’s most valuable brand—Arnault has been gradually raising her public profile, albeit on her own terms. During our interview on the morning after the prize ceremony, at a photo studio in the 7th arrondissement, she is courteous, pleasant, and unfailingly controlled. (“If you start asking about her personal life, she will shut down,” an associate had warned me beforehand.) Friends say she’s warm and humorous—if not exactly a chatterbox—when she’s with her trusted inner circle.

It’s a circle that more and more young fashion designers would love to be a part of. With Arnault’s help, LVMH has lately been on a major shopping spree, purchasing significant interests in an array of up-and-coming fashion labels, from the British shoe wizard Nicholas Kirkwood and red carpet favorite Maxime Simoens to the Sicilian rising star Marco de Vincenzo and 29-year-old J.W. Anderson, whom the company also put in charge at Loewe. The stakes are high: Luxury fashion and accessories currently generate annual sales of about $300 billion worldwide. LVMH, with its portfolio of more than 60 brands including jewelry and fragrance companies such as Bulgari, Guerlain, and TAG Heuer, has already cornered the largest chunk of the market. But there’s ferocious competition to discover the next great designer, and LVMH’s archrival, Kering SA, has been busy investing in its own prospects, such as Christopher Kane and Joseph Altuzarra. The new yearly prize for under-40 designers seems like a natural outgrowth of LVMH’s never-ending search for fresh blood. “I think it’s really important for the group to know the young talents and to help them,” Arnault says. “I think it’s our responsibility.”

Launching an independent fashion label has always been a high-risk endeavor, requiring equal parts creative talent, business know-how, and plain-old chutzpah. Today, with the calendar increasingly full of live-streaming shows that are critiqued instantly by online audiences, the job requires even deeper reserves of stamina—not to mention a flair for churning out retweetable witticisms and Instagram-ready imagery.

Arnault says the prize, with its team of LVMH advisers, can help guide young designers over the hurdles. “It’s reassuring to have someone with experience advise you on the decisions you have to make almost every day: Where to produce, at what price, and how to choose your distribution? Should you do shoes and handbags, or perfume? Should you create a second line?”

Those are just a few of the pressing questions for Thomas Tait, the Canadian-born, London-based designer whom the judges pick as the winner after their deliberations in a conference room upstairs. (Runner-up prizes go to Shayne Oliver of Hood by Air and Nikita and Tina Sutradhar, two sisters from Mumbai, India, behind the beguilingly original women’s wear label Miuniku.) Tait is teary-eyed when he accepts the prize from Arnault. Even with nine London Fashion Week presentations behind him, he tells me, he faces any number of hindrances, beginning with a cash flow problem: Advance payments from retailers are rarely enough to cover overhead. Then there are endless questions about his barely there website, his e-commerce plans, press relations, etc. “Most young designers, we’ve been to fashion school or art school. We’re not businesspeople by nature, but we run our own businesses,” says Tait, whose label has only one other full-time employee. “You realize very quickly that you’re spending 90 percent of your time working on the business side of things and only 10 percent of your time designing.”

One of Arnault’s strengths is said to be her solid rapport with temperamental créateurs, honed during the 12 years she worked at Dior—first with John Galliano and then with Raf Simons—before moving to Vuitton. She is now perceived as LVMH’s main talent scout, the driving force behind its recent investments. “I’m not alone—we have a team looking for talent,” she says. “It’s in the philosophy of the group, and my father has been doing it for over 20 years. Riccardo Tisci started at Givenchy 10 years ago, when he was 29 and had done only two collections for his own line.”

Although Arnault maintains that there’s no connection between the LVMH prize and the company’s recruitment of the next generation of designers, that possibility has, of course, crossed the mind of the candidates. “As amazing as it would be to win, it would be even more amazing to get an investment from LVMH,” one of them tells me. Arnault counters, “This prize is about generosity. It’s not like we’re taking participation in the company. It’s really to help young talent grow.”

As we speak, Arnault is being made up for the photograph that will accompany this story, and she has to apologize to the makeup artist because she keeps turning away from the mirror to look me in the eye as she answers questions. Her fluent, lightly accented English is a remnant of the three years she spent as a child with her family in suburban New York.

Born in Lille in 1975, Arnault attended the prestigious French business school EDHEC and the London School of Economics before working for two years with the consulting firm McKinsey & Company. In 2001, she joined Dior and eventually became deputy general manager. Even if it wasn’t always a given that she’d join LVMH, Arnault says, the family business was a natural fit. “I’m lucky that it’s about fashion and perfume and cosmetics,” she says. “If my father had owned a tire company, I don’t know what I would have done.” Along with her younger brother, Antoine, now the CEO of the men’s wear label Berluti, she was tested out in several positions at the firm, with Bernard keeping close tabs. “We had to prove a number of things,” she says.

The siblings are now seen as the finalists in their own competition, to succeed their 65-year-old father in what is arguably the fashion world’s most powerful job. Antoine, gregarious and press-friendly, is a poker whiz who’s often photographed with his supermodel partner, Natalia Vodianova. Delphine is more private, methodical, mysterious. Her appointment at Vuitton last year revived chatter that she may have the edge as heir apparent, though her father’s ultimate plans are anybody’s guess.

Arnault, who considers herself “very French,” has plenty of good things to say about Americans—especially their attitudes toward ambition and success. “In the States, entrepreneurs inspire a lot of people and are respected for creating jobs,” Arnault notes. “That makes people dream and feel happy for their country.” Asked whether that’s not the case in France—where cultural sentiment about wealth is far more ambivalent and where the socialist president François Hollande has infuriated business leaders with his tax-the-rich policies—Arnault pauses and laughs. “No comment,” she says.

To an observer, there’s no doubt that Bernard and Delphine are father and daughter: They have the same aura of self-containment, the same enigmatic half-smile, the same nose. Asked what character traits she shares with Papa, Arnault smiles and says, “I think I’m very discreet, like him.” She adds, “It’s hard to compare. He’s a visionary who transformed the fashion industry. He’s very good in finance, and he also has this very creative side. When you show him a collection of handbags, he knows immediately which one is going to sell. And he’s also an amazing pianist. I mean, he’s exceptional.”

Nicolas Ghesquière, whom Delphine championed last year to take over at Vuitton after Marc Jacobs’s departure, believes that she has a rare ability to connect business with the creative front. “Delphine really gets into the details—the closures of bags, the finishings, all the particulars of how it’s made,” Ghesquière says. “I’ve never had someone from management work so closely with me on those aspects.” He sees a similar duality in her focus on young talent—a “headhunter quality” that’s rooted in her knowledge that new ideas are essential for business. As for her reserve, Ghesquière attributes it to a desire to observe and analyze—a kind of drama-free “serenity” that’s often lacking in the fashion world. “With Delphine there’s always reflection,” he says. “No decisions are made unless they are really thought through.”

Part of Arnault’s mandate ____ at Vuitton is to work with Ghesquière and CEO Michael Burke to bring more focus and consistency to the brand. Their pet project for fall is a new set of high-priced limited-edition bags and trunks. Guest designers will use the Louis Vuitton monogram—“the icon of the house,” as Arnault calls it—on pieces of their own design. Positioning them as collectibles rather than just It bags, Vuitton has recruited a team that Arnault calls “six geniuses”: Lagerfeld, Cindy Sherman, Frank Gehry, Rei Kawakubo, Christian Louboutin, and Marc Newson.

Collecting is something the Arnaults do with great gusto, and in late October, Bernard will open the long-awaited Louis Vuitton Foundation, the cultural center conceived by Gehry as a cloud of glass, which will house a permanent contemporary collection and host curated shows and exhibitions. Delphine, steeped in art since childhood, has been quietly assembling her own, much smaller collection. “I think an art collection is a lot like a diary,” she says. “Your taste evolves with time. I try to never sell anything, because it’s part of my journey.” These days, she’s particularly drawn to artists who are part of what she calls Los Angeles’s “amazing scene”—Sterling Ruby, Alex Israel, and Thomas Houseago, all of whom she has visited at their studios.

Arnault’s main priority while off-duty is her family, about which she prefers to say very little. If you must know: She is divorced from Alessandro Vallarino Gancia, the Italian wine heir she married in 2005; her current partner is Xavier Niel, a self-made entrepreneur who is one of a handful of Frenchmen besides Bernard Arnault on the Forbes billionaires list. The couple have a daughter, Elisa, who is 2. Becoming a mother, Arnault says, has transformed her life; it has also possibly tempered her workaholic instincts. “Now, maybe I spend less time at lunch, so I can come home earlier,” she says. “I can do what Americans do: eat at the desk.” Like any mother who works full-time (or more), she struggles to fit everything in, but she says, “I can’t imagine myself not working. And I hope my daughter will work when she’s older.”

When Arnault is asked if she can imagine herself running LVMH someday, she responds with a dodge worthy of Hillary Clinton: “I don’t know—it’s really not on the program,” she says. “My father is very young, and I don’t think he’ll ever stop working.”

One person who has no trouble imagining Arnault in charge someday is Pierre-Yves Roussel, the chairman and CEO of LVMH Fashion Group, who also spearheads the recruitment of new designers. Roussel was Arnault’s supervisor and mentor during her stint at McKinsey, where he worked before joining LVMH. “Of course I think she could do it,” he says. In addition to her natural “left-brain/right-brain” smarts and quiet leadership abilities, Roussel says, “she has put in a lot of work and a lot of time. She’s young, but she has the mileage of someone 15 years older, because she’s been immersed in the industry since childhood.”

Back at the competition, Arnault is preparing to announce the winner to a small crowd of company execs and journalists, when her father walks in. Bernard says a few hellos as he passes the judges, but by the time the presentation starts, he is standing in the back of the room, watching. His expression is benign and inscrutable, just like his daughter’s.

"When to Partner and When to Acquire, Louis Vuitton Style - INSEAD Knowledge","Thu, 28 Aug 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8va25vd2xlZGdlLmluc2VhZC5lZHUvc3RyYXRlZ3kvd2hlbi1wYXJ0bmVyLWFuZC13aGVuLWFjcXVpcmUtbG91aXMtdnVpdHRvbi1zdHlsZdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Yves Carcelle is a humble man with penetrating brown eyes. An INSEAD MBA, he is credited with transforming Louis Vuitton (LV) from an old trunk maker into a luxury powerhouse throughout his 23- year long tenure as CEO. Now he is a self-declared “fixer” for the top management team and Vice President of the LVMH Foundation. His own modest handyman-like image is in stark contrast to the venerable leader he is considered both inside and outside of LVMH.

When he became CEO in the early nineties, he knew that LV had grown very quickly across the world without having all the management resources it needed to maintain global leadership positions. This meant that LV had to form alliances with distributors in most of the countries it operated in. These distributors played an active role in the company’s business operations.

Yet, 100% reliance on global business partners was not Carcelle’s philosophy. One of his earliest initiatives at LV was to take control of 100 percent of the distribution of LV’s products in almost all geographies. “With 100 percent distribution, you can have a good database…every morning you see the sales product-by-product, store-by-store, clientele-by-clientele all over the world,” he told me in a recent interview.

Partnerships and alliances are valuable drivers of competitive advantage, but if everyone in your industry relies on partnerships, there might be opportunities for achieving competitive advantage in a different way, i.e. when you integrate everything under one roof. Carcelle was willing to go against the grain, and now he remains surprised that no other luxury brand considered such a move. Even now most of LV’s competitors have a lot of distribution partnerships worldwide.

But why did LV decide to go against the industry’s majority opinion? During the 1990s, business revolved around the concept of outsourcing and many luxury goods companies moved many of their operations overseas. Carcelle argues that LV’s key source of competitive advantage was its know-how of product making. Success doesn’t always come from “manufacturing everything yourself, but from understanding and controlling the know-how and having your experts in-house,” he explains.

Does vertical integration always make sense?

Over time, LV bought out all of its partners, but there was one exception. “The only partners I decided to keep were our partners in the Middle East. This was not only because their values were the same as ours. Friendship and value-sharing is not enough. [A big reason for keeping them was that] the Middle East is complicated, legally and culturally,” he said.

As I explain in the new book Network Advantage: How to Unlock Value From Your Alliances and Partnerships, LV decided to stick with a Middle Eastern partner - Chalhoub Group. As Yves Carcelle commented, “Decision-makers [in the Middle East] speak Arabic and I decided it was important for us to continue to work with partners that opened doors, be our advisers and we were the first one to organise a joint venture for the whole Middle East market”. However, to still ensure as much consistency across regions as possible, LV decided to work with Chalhoub Group across several Middle Eastern markets, and not to try and find a separate partner for each country.

The lesson from Yves Carcelle’s experience is clear. The more unique your assets are and the greater the control you need to exercise over the value chain to extract competitive advantage from these assets, the more vertical integration makes sense. However, the higher the uncertainty and complexity in your markets, the more you should think about partnerships. LV’s key assets were a unique brand and long term experience in luxury goods. By vertically integrating, LV has ensured a highly consistent image all around the world. If you face a situation when you have unique assets, control over the value chain helps you extract value from them. Yet when you are dealing with complex and uncertain markets, then you need to find a single partner with expertise in most of these markets.

Fashion heirs who inherit family businesses have big shoes to fill - Style,"Thu, 07 Aug 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjbXAuY29tL21hZ2F6aW5lcy9zdHlsZS9hcnRpY2xlLzE1NjI3NTgvZmFzaGlvbi1oZWlycy13aG8taW5oZXJpdC1mYW1pbHktYnVzaW5lc3Nlcy1oYXZlLWJpZy1zaG9lcy1maWxs0gF0aHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAuc2NtcC5jb20vbWFnYXppbmVzL3N0eWxlL2FydGljbGUvMTU2Mjc1OC9mYXNoaW9uLWhlaXJzLXdoby1pbmhlcml0LWZhbWlseS1idXNpbmVzc2VzLWhhdmUtYmlnLXNob2VzLWZpbGw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Arnault's perceived quandary, such that it might be, is one that could be understood by a number of high-powered luxury brands that continue to be controlled - whether creatively, financially or both - by families. Ferragamo, Missoni, Fendi, Zegna, Bulgari, Swarovski, Hermès - some of the most stellar labels in the style universe are now in the hands of descendants of the founder, and these young people are being entrusted with maintaining the aesthetic and legacy of an ancestor's vision.

Fashion watchers interpreted the move as significant: could Arnault, now 65, be pitting his son and daughter against one another to potentially fill his own shoes once he steps down?

A couple of years ago, luxury fashion tycoon Bernard Arnault installed his son Antoine as CEO of menswear brand Berluti, and his daughter Delphine as executive vice-president at Louis Vuitton - both brands, among a prestigious plethora of others, that make up Arnault's LVMH empire.

In a 2011 edition of , the European business publication, Italian management academics posed the question: ""Why are luxury firms often family firms?"" The article surmises that succession from one family member to another works when there is a successful family strategy in business, which researchers describe as ""the four Cs"": continuity, community, connections and command. ""It has been proved that family businesses tend to exist longer than their counterparts, which are more subject to [mergers and acquisitions].""

Members of the Ferragamo family. (Front, from left): Fiamma, Wanda and Fulvia. (Back, from left): Giovanna, Leonardo and Ferruccio.

Certainly, there are storied family firms that have had to become part of a larger machine: Gucci, which was founded in 1921 by Guccio Gucci, fell prey to infighting, and family members ended up selling off their shares. It is now a subsidiary of French conglomerate Kering, helmed by François-Henri Pinault. On the other hand, Pucci, run by the founder Emilio's daughter Laudomia, sold 67 per cent of its brand to LVMH in 2000 - but she retains creative and image control.

For families who have been successful at keeping their luxury brands not just alive but thriving, the term ""inherited legacy"" means everything.

James Ferragamo is the group women's leather director of Salvatore Ferragamo, the Florentine fashion and accessory brand; he is also the grandson of Salvatore and the son of Ferruccio, the company's CEO. He represents a new breed of fashion heirs - smart, accomplished, refreshingly lacking in any air of entitlement - and seems to know what it takes to make stepping into a family business work. ""I would say, stay true to the values of your family, and work hard to bring your own original contribution, because you're not there to reproduce what others did before you, nor to subvert it, but to develop and enhance it,"" he says.

(From left) Jacqueline Beaurang, ex-wife of American artist and filmmaker Julian Schnabel, and their children: poet and actress Stella Schnabel, and painter and filmmaker Lola Montes Schnabel. They participated in the Ferragamo launch campaign for the Fiamma bag.

Indeed, various family members still sit on the board, including Salvatore's other children, Leonardo, Fulvia and Giovanna. And a recent handbag launch was inspired by James' late aunt Fiamma, who died in 1998 and who designed the footwear and leather accessories for the brand for 40 years.

""[It] is dedicated to all the women of our family who have always played central roles in the development of our business,"" Ferragamo says. ""Fiamma embodied our brand at its best.""

Family businesses that have successfully passed the baton from one generation to another need to be savvy enough to choose the best candidate for the job, same last name notwithstanding. Margherita Missoni is known widely as a model, actress and heiress to the brand founded by her grandparents, Ottavio and Rosita Missoni, in 1953.

But the 31-year-old graduate of Columbia University is far more than that: she is in charge of the accessories, beachwear and children's lines while retaining her position as ""brand ambassador"" - a role she stepped into seamlessly when she was 18 and wearing the Missoni label at all the hot spots. ""I began hitting the party scene, and people were seeing this fresh, reborn brand on me,"" she says. ""The clothing and me were well-suited for each other.""

Karl Lagerfeld and Silvia Venturini Fendi, granddaughter of Edoardo and Adele Fendi

Still, Missoni says she struggled somewhat with her heritage in her early years, and decamped to New York for a while to get into acting and modelling.

""Clothing and design have been part of my life since I was born, and I kind of wanted to get away from it to understand who I was,"" she says. ""Now with my responsibilities, I've found that I have more drive than ever before. I respect the family I come from and my job. I know I wouldn't be in the place I am if I hadn't grown up in this family, but this is also the reason why I can be good at this job - I was born into and grew up surrounded by the Missoni vision. So I don't need to adapt my taste to its aesthetic, because I have integrated it into my own self since I was a child.""

The greater challenge would appear to be for a family member to maintain an entrenched aesthetic when new owners take over. Last year, brothers Sergio and Pier Luigi Loro Piana, descendants of Pietro Loro Piana, who established the brand in 1924, sold a majority stake in their company to LVMH while staying on in advisory roles. Pier Luigi says the decision to sell off most of his family's business to the LVMH empire was based on it being ""for the best of the company"".

Margherita Missoni, heiress to Missoni

""Considering the family story was to secure the company's success ... LVMH was the group that has more vision and capacity to develop Loro Piana into the future ... not always [can] the story of the future of the family be exactly the same as [what] is best for the company.""

In the meantime, members of families involved in the business are resigned to the fact that their personal, family and business lives are intertwined - and they do feel the weight of responsibility of maintaining a generations-old reputation.

""On a personal level,"" Ferragamo says, ""it means having the courage and capacity to act with self-assurance and coherence, a passion for my work, pride in belonging to the world of Ferragamo, and a sensibility towards individuals and respect for their needs.""

And so Frank Gehry’s new Fondation Louis Vuitton, in Paris, looks like sails, and it looks like a boat, and it looks like a whale, and it looks like a crystal palace that is in the middle of an explosion. Some of the innards make you think of Piranesi, and as you look up the stair tower, monuments of Russian Constructivism, such as Vladimir Tatlin’s fantastic spiral tower, might flash through your mind, just as you could stand in front and from one angle the façade could make you think of Frank Lloyd Wright’s Beth Sholom Synagogue, his great “Mount Sinai in glass.”

But none of these comparisons matter in the slightest. They’re all correct as far as they go, but they are really only ways of postponing coming to terms with the fact that this building is a whole new thing, a new work of monumental public architecture that is not precisely like anything that anyone, including Frank Gehry, has done before. You could call it a 21st-century take on the Grand Palais, the wildly extravagant Beaux-Arts exhibition hall off the Champs-Élysées, and you could also say that it’s Gehry’s attempt to render his own Guggenheim Bilbao in glass. But even these, which get closer, miss a lot of what makes this building remarkable, just as calling it a descendant of Gehry’s IAC office building, in New York, which is made up of billowing white glass that also always reminds people of sails, only begins to explain what Gehry has wrought on this unlikely site within the Bois de Boulogne at the western edge of Paris.

Gehry, who is now 85, continues to push himself forward, as Picasso and Wright did late in their careers, relentlessly determined that, however important his past work may be, it must serve for him as the foundation for something more than a mere dénouement. He has been experimenting with curving glass for years, twisting and torquing it into lyrical, dancing shapes, and here the long quest that began with the glass panels decorating the cafeteria he designed for the Condé Nast Building in 1999 culminates in enormous glass sails that are pieces of architecture in themselves, sumptuous forms that give shape to an entire building.

Gehry loves the form of the fish as much as he loves sailing and boats, and it is not hard to see this building as the moment when these preoccupations come together into one gargantuan and complex object. Yet another longtime theme in Gehry’s work has been his desire to tear away the façades of his buildings, making the structure—what he calls “the bones”—visible as a way of celebrating the aesthetic hidden within it, and what began decades ago when he started revealing the wooden framing inside the walls of small houses has grown here into exhibiting vast and monumental curves of steel and timber, a framework that seems at once to evoke the Eiffel Tower and an ancient church. This building is muscular, and it is delicate: it is a linebacker with the moves of a ballerina or, if you prefer, it is Moby-Dick with the athleticism of a sailfish.

The reported $143 million Fondation Louis Vuitton, which opens to the public in October, was commissioned by Bernard Arnault, the chairman and C.E.O. of the luxury-goods conglomerate LVMH Moët Hennessey Louis Vuitton, as a contemporary-art museum and cultural center, and it is not only its architecture that is unusual. There are relatively few private museums in France, and in building this one Arnault—himself a major collector—was obviously hoping to reinforce a connection between his company and advanced art and design. But it has the potential to develop a brand even more potent than that of LVMH: that of France itself, and of Paris, where more creative energy surrounded modern art, architecture, and design in the first half of the 20th century than anywhere else. Paris long ago ceded its leadership as a creative center to New York and other cities, and not even the vast investment of the French government in such architecturally ambitious projects as the Centre Pompidou, by Richard Rogers and Renzo Piano, the expanded Louvre, with its glass pyramid, by I. M. Pei, and the Cité de la Musique, by Christian de Portzamparc, has been enough to get it back.

But not until now has there been a significant private investment in a cultural institution, a new entity conceived, designed, constructed, and managed without the heavy hand of French bureaucracy. Gehry’s building—which is his first project in Paris since he completed the American Center, now the Cinémathèque Française, in 1994—is the most compelling work of new architecture the city has seen since the Centre Pompidou opened, almost 40 years ago, and the new museum and cultural center it houses represent the unbridled zeal of the private sector. Paris has never experienced a marriage of cultural ambition and private enterprise of this magnitude, and it may have a shot at making something happen that extends way beyond Gehry’s glass doors.

Its roots go back to 2001, when Jean-Paul Claverie, who joined LVMH as a special adviser to Arnault after working under Jack Lang in the French Ministry of Culture, became so excited about Gehry’s Guggenheim Museum, in Bilbao, that he insisted that Arnault make a trip to Spain to see it. “I wanted him to discover it and share with me the feeling I had standing in front of it,” Claverie said to me. “It wasn’t easy—he canceled twice, but finally we succeeded in November of 2001,” when Arnault, face-to-face with Gehry’s building, Claverie recalls, could say only, “How can a person imagine this architecture?”

Arnault said he had to meet Gehry, who is based in Los Angeles, and the two arranged to have lunch a month later in New York. Arnault told Gehry that he envisioned a building in Paris that would embody his Louis Vuitton Foundation for Creation’s mission to support the arts and education and that he wanted it to be a significant work of architecture."

MCM tries in vain to beat masstige image - koreatimes,"Thu, 28 Aug 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiM2h0dHBzOi8vbS5rb3JlYXRpbWVzLmNvLmtyL3BhZ2VzL2FydGljbGUuYXNwLzE2Mzc3MNIBP2h0dHBzOi8vbS5rb3JlYXRpbWVzLmNvLmtyL3BhZ2VzL2FydGljbGUuYW1wLmFzcD9uZXdzSWR4PTE2Mzc3MA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"By Rachel Lee





Kim Sung-joo, the chairwoman of Sungjoo Group speaks at the press conference at MCM Kunsthalle, a concept store located in Gangnam District in Seoul, Thursday. / Yonhap

Sungjoo Group, a retail group that operates MCM and Marks & Spencer, aims to lead the fashion industry by introducing a new concept of luxury.

Kim Sung-joo, founder of the company, likes to think that her brand should be in the same company with LVMH.

In the news conference Thursday, she boasted that MCM's ""New School of luxury"" concept have appealed to the younger generation since the group acquired the German luxury goods maker in 2005 to rejuvenate the brand.

""These mature consumers of old school of luxury can't break certain stereotypes,"" Kim said. ""They tend to stay with classic, well-known brands like Prada and Gucci, but the younger generation, or what we call ‘millennium generation' likes to show that they are different. They like variety. This generation's wish is to look formal, sporty, and classy and MCM is the brand that helps you achieve such different looks.""

The businesswoman also announced that the fashion group aims to expand its global business by building a design studio in Europe and opening up 21 stores in 10 countries including Maldives, France, Japan and the United States by the end of this year. MCM also plans to reinforce its collaborative work with popular artists and celebrities.

The problem is that the reality falls short of her ambitious statement.

However, her passion concentrated too much on global business, neglecting the Korean market. As opposed to what the chairwoman described, MCM in this country is, without do doubt, regarded as a ""masstige"" brand. Masstige brands are those perceived as prestige but available to the masses.

MCM is known among local people a ""brand designed for Chinese."" The stores in Myeong-dong and Cheongdam-dong, for instance, are full of Chinese tourists snapping up the bags. There are hardly any Korean consumers in the stores.

""I admit that I mainly focused on the global business. But we are trying our best to improve the quality of the products and eventually position MCM as a top luxury brand in Korea,"" the CEO explained.

""We have always focused on building up the brand power to compete with global fashion giants like LVMH. Now, MCM is regarded as one of the coveted brands in the fashion industry. Because we do something unusual from the existing luxury goods,"" Kim said.

Kim also said that women shouldn't ""suffer"" from the usual stereotype anymore, suggesting that with MCM's signature bag rucksack, working women should avoid wearing heels and match the accessory with a pair of sneakers instead.

The irony is that the CEO's suggestion doesn't correspond with the newly introduced concept of the brand: being different and diverse. The aforementioned style is the classic example of a cliché. A backpack with sneakers is too common and boring. Matching heels would rather be a better choice as mix& match breaks what she calls the old stereotype.

MCM will win the hearts of the local consumers only if it can clearly redefine its new concept of luxury."

Among them, they have a total of 10 Council of Fashion Designers of America nominations, six C.F.D.A. wins, and numerous other awards. “It’s incredibly flattering to be in the position that I am in today,” says Altuzarra, “and I am excited for what’s to come.” Perhaps one day they—like Ralph, Donna, and Calvin before them—will achieve worldwide notoriety and be known by the chic shorthand of their first names only. Dao-Yi and Maxwell already sound pretty good, no?"
Axel Dumas: A Man With a Clan - W Magazine,"Tue, 19 Aug 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiNWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndtYWdhemluZS5jb20vc3RvcnkvYXhlbC1kdW1hcy1oZXJtZXMtY2Vv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Plenty of chief executives ____ like to say that their company is one big family, but Axel Dumas is more justified than most in making that claim. Dumas, who took over as CEO of Hermès International in February, is a great-great-great-grandson of the house’s founder, Thierry Hermès, and one of dozens of heirs with a controlling stake. In an era dominated by fashion conglomerates whose “luxury” products are often manufactured at the lowest possible cost, Hermès remains committed to centuries-old techniques. Each Kelly bag is still assembled by a single craftsman over the course of several days in a roomy, light-filled workshop. And even if the artisans aren’t treated to daily finger massages and foie gras lunches, one imagines that they are.

In May, when members of the Hermès family gathered in New York for the brand’s annual executive meeting and an extravagantly theatrical soirée for 700 guests, it was a reminder that the tradition-bound clan fully embraces its eccentric uncles and crazy cousins. Among the amusements dreamed up by Hermès women’s-universe artistic director Bali Barret were a horse racing game, a fortune-teller reading silk scarves, and a “dancing bags” spectacle in which a Brooklyn-based troupe showed off handbags from the fall collection.

The final tab? Not important, Dumas says, adding, “We never make any decision based on cost.” He recalls that in 2007, when the price of gold skyrocketed, some considered reducing the percentage of gold in the handbag closures. Then a senior craftsman told Dumas that in five years the cheaper clasps might not have the same patina as the classic ones. “That was it—we kept things the same,” Dumas says.

This quality-at-all-costs strategy has been especially successful of late. Last year, worldwide revenue hit $5 billion, up nearly eight percent. Still ongoing is Hermès’s tussle with LVMH, following the French luxury group’s aggressive purchases of the company’s public shares over the past several years. The family has since legally consolidated and protected its majority stake—a move, Dumas says, that was meant to send a “very strong message” to LVMH that Hermès “should not be meddled with.”

At the helm with Axel Dumas is another family scion, his cousin Pierre-Alexis Dumas, the house’s artistic director since 2009. His role, as he sees it, is “creating the right conditions for creativity to emerge” from a team that includes Christophe Lemaire (women’s wear), Pierre Hardy (shoes and jewelry), and Véronique Nichanian (men’s wear). A sense of familial duty is evident in both men, who remember playing together as children. Something else that Axel and Pierre-Alexis share is an obsession with continually renewing and refreshing Hermès, no matter how august its history. “I’m always proposing strange new things to them,” Barret says. “And they almost never say no.”

Supermodel Natalia Vodianova's Gilded Present in Paris - Vanity Fair,"Tue, 05 Aug 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZhbml0eWZhaXIuY29tL3N0eWxlLzIwMTQvMDkvbmF0YWxpYS12b2Rpbm92YS1hbnRvaW5lLWFybmF1bHTSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The Girl from Nizhny Novgorod

It did not take long for Natalia to break through to the fashion world big time. The same scout who had spotted her back in Nizhny Novgorod took her under his wing and asked her to accompany him to Viva, the agency whose representative had passed on her in Moscow. Proud, she said, “Oh no, no, no. They’ll think I’m desperate.” The scout prevailed. He was taking another girl there anyway and told Natalia she could just sit quietly in a corner. Not likely. People kept popping their heads around the corner to get another look at the startling, unspoiled beauty. “I thought, My God, they must be wondering what I am doing here,” says Natalia with a laugh. Finally she was called into the office of Cyril Brulé, the president of Viva. Brulé recalls, “This guy had said to me, ‘Cyril, I brought you an incredible girl; your scout did not choose her, but could you see her? Because I think she made a mistake.’ ”

When Brulé looked for himself the deal was done. “Wow, I thought, she has star potential,” he remembers. He’d helped usher in his fair share of fashion stars, including Audrey Marnay, Raquel Zimmermann, and Trish Goff. Brulé apologized that Vodianova had not been picked in Moscow, and said that he hoped she would consider working with Viva one day. “Right then I said, ‘Can I please change right now? I love it here,’ ” remembers Natalia. “I went with my gut. You always hear horrid stories of models being exploited, cheated, and treated badly, but 13 years later that man, Cyril, is still my agent in Paris and is one of my best friends in the world.”

I asked Brulé what went through his mind when Natalia made such an instant decision to join his agency. “I thought, I guess miracles do exist. The interesting thing is that when I asked Natalia a few months later what had happened to make her give us the opportunity to work with her she said that in our office everything was organized and clean and seemed perfect. She told me that she grew up in a family where everything was a mess. Our agency’s order gave her confidence.”

I then asked Brulé what it was he saw in Natalia’s looks that made him so sure she would become a fashion star. He replied, “I kept looking at her. She looked just like a baby Romy Schneider.” In fact the beautiful Austrian-born French actress is a constant reference when people in the business talk about Vodianova. In addition, they often comment on her mutability, her capacity to go from an innocent-looking child/woman—which became a sought-after quality in the 1960s and stuck—to the most sophisticated woman imaginable.

But personality is also key in fashion. Those fittings and shoots involve long days and endless nights, and models who make themselves difficult don’t last long—at least when they’re on the lower rungs of the profession. (Once they are on top they have a much better shot at getting away with diva syndrome.) Brulé says that when Natalia arrived, “it was around the time that the Russian girls were starting to be a big thing. None of them made it like Natalia or became as famous as she did. Most of them had a horrible attitude. They were unfriendly, rude, uncomfortable with the job, and acted like real princesses.” Not her.

Brulé had the opportunity to prove his loyalty to Vodianova early on. About six months after she’d made it to Paris her mother’s situation reached a crisis. A cold front had hit Russia, spoiling her fruit. Larisa had lost everything, and in order to re-start her business she had borrowed from the wrong people, at an enormous, impossible interest rate. “She owed these Mafia people $5,000—more than a year’s salary in the fruit business,” says Natalia. Brulé stepped up to the plate with a loan, so everyone could breathe easier.

Natalia’s career skyrocketed. By 18, she’d even met her Prince Charming: Justin Portman, then 31. These two blue-eyed beauties floated through a world of chic vacation spots, luxury hotels, and the picky pages of Vogue. If ever two people seemed made for each other, it was them. I’d run into them out and about, and I was always impressed by how polite they were, not just to each other but to everyone else. They were self-deprecating and had real (not unctuous) polish—and soon gorgeous children as well. (Natalia had become pregnant with Lucas five months after the couple met.) Instead of derailing her career, childbirth seemed only to render her more exciting, more sensual, more authentic to the arbiters of the industry. When she showed up on fashion runways, shortly after giving birth to Lucas, looking as if she were fresh off a holiday in Tulum, her place in fashion lore was sealed. Neva and Viktor, named after Natalia’s grandfather, soon followed. The joke became: Who is going to win the race? The fashion shows and campaigns she was hired for or the next baby?

When, in 2010, Natalia and Justin separated, it seemed all the more shocking because the romance had been so highly visible and public. I asked her directly about it. “If you try really hard at something and it doesn’t work, then you have to let go because it means it is not the right thing,” she explained very softly. “You have to try really hard to make it work, but at the same time you have to know how to let go of something when it is time.” Now the kids live with Natalia and Arnault in Paris and spend half of their vacations with their father.

Natalia and Antoine Arnault had seen each other around the fashion circuit but didn’t get together until later, when they were both available. She laughs about it now. “He made himself noticed. Men are good at that.” Their first date was in front of the building where they now live. She explains, “We couldn’t go anywhere together, so we just met on a bench and sat and talked. We knew if we go somewhere, in Paris, then the whole world would know.” Natalia is clearly smitten. “When I moved [to be with Arnault] in Paris, the year before last I moved with my children, and my grannie, who stayed for eight months. That tells you a lot about Antoine as a future husband, or as a father or as a partner in life. He’s one of the most patient people. It’s not like we have a big house. We’re all in an apartment together.

“He gets up at eight A.M. and goes to work with a big smile on his face. He loves what he does, loves my children so much, is a great father and stepfather and boyfriend. I guess he is still a boyfriend. I want to call him my husband because it feels right, whether we have the papers or not. He feels like a husband already, although it doesn’t make a difference, does it? I feel blessed. He is everything I love and respect.”

Life Is a Dream

Maybe because of her past, Natalia can dream herself into almost any identity for the camera—sophisticate (Patrick Demarchelier), Alice in Wonderland (Annie Leibovitz), or even Madonna and Child (in this summer’s intimate Instagram image of Natalia breast-feeding Maxim, shot by Paolo Roversi, complete with a public declaration of love to Arnault: the caption read, “Happy birthday baby from Paolo, Maxim and I Love you @antoinearnault”). Her ability to look into the light and communicate yearning reminds me of those unforgettable images taken by the mid-19th-century Scottish photographer Lady Clementina Hawarden, who died of pneumonia at 42, and spent her all too brief adult life recording her eight daughters as they played dress-up with a trunk of clothes, or looked longingly from the windows in their fancy Victorian house, opening out to a world that still had no place for women.

On a more pragmatic level Natalia picked up the tricks of her trade faster than one could say “Nizhny Novgorod.” Here are some of her tips: “It’s really a matter of very little details. Little angles, little tilts of the head. Eyebrows up to make the eyes look bigger. Mouth a little open. Shoulders down for a long neck. It’s a lot like sculpting.” Her grasp of the process and reputation for hard work won her the Gucci campaign in 2002, under Tom Ford’s reign. Suddenly she was everywhere, on billboards, in magazine spreads galore. Other prestigious fashion houses clamored for exclusives with her. Calvin Klein—whose reputation for putting his money where his mouth is and making models global stars, from Brooke Shields to Christy Turlington to Kate Moss, was unparalleled—won. I asked him, Why Natalia? “All I know is that I have to fall in love, and I did with Natalia,” Klein replied. “It’s an emotional thing. She reminded me of someone like Mrs. Onassis, but also she had that thing that Brooke Shields had—an ability to project innocence, also glamour and sensuality. Natalia really is quality and not pretentious. She talked about all kinds of things that had to do with giving back, being grateful for what she had already, and wanting to give to people in need. I mean, how often do we hear that? I just said, We have to get her. And, believe me, I can see the fraud in two minutes.”

For Natalia’s part, the offer from Calvin Klein was a no-brainer. “Very few brands made it to Russia, even once the open economy began,” she explains. “But Levi’s and Calvin did. I could not afford Calvin then, but I remember the logo very well. When I first arrived in New York, Justin and I lived downtown, and I remember Calvin’s incredible billboards. I knew what was cool. You recognize it. You understand it’s what you want to be.”

Her collaboration with Klein himself and with the house in general has lasted until now. There have been a few breaks, and she no longer does the print campaign, but she still does the Euphoria perfume ads. Her bond with Klein is still so strong that after he left the house he had founded and I wrote a story on him for this magazine in 2008, Natalia showed up to give me a private fashion show of some of the highlights of his 40-year career.

But—and this is what separates Vodianova from so many others—all the fame, money (she was listed in Forbes magazine as earning $8.6 million in 2011–12), and success did not make her feel complete. She bought her mother and Oksana a comfortable house in Nizhny Novgorod, saw to it that her grandparents had the best doctors, and placed a younger half-sister, Kristina, who was four years old when Natalia left, in a British boarding school.

Next came good works for others: when she was 22, Natalia started her Naked Heart Foundation, initially inspired by the September 1, 2004, Beslan terrorist attack, when Chechen rebels attacked a school in Beslan, North Ossetia, Russia. Three hundred thirty-four people were killed, including 186 children, and more than 700 people were wounded. Vodianova was in Moscow when the tragedy struck. On the flight back home, she remembers, she could not stop weeping and asking herself how she could help the survivors heal. That inspired her plan to set up play parks for children, including for those with disabilities, across Russia. “I thought about what I was missing from my own life when I was growing up, and it was that I had no play.” (The great psychologist of children Bruno Bettelheim would certainly approve. He wrote, “Play permits the child to resolve in symbolic form unsolved problems of the past and to cope directly or symbolically with present concerns. It is also his most significant tool for preparing himself for the future and its tasks.”) The Naked Heart Foundation has since built 120 full-scale play parks and small playgrounds across Russia and 1 in Ukraine. Perhaps the most emotional moment for Vodianova was when the play center in Beslan was opened."

LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, under whose luxury label umbrella Bvlgari falls, roped in perfumer Daniela Andrier of Givaudan for the task of crafting the scents around gems.

While peridot has reportedly made way for Lilaia, a fresh and woody scent, with touches of mastic, mate peppermint and orange.

Meanwhile, Maravilla, the citrine, is a chypre scent rich in citrus, as well as peach, jasmine, patchouli and acethyvenol, Calaluna channels the moonstone and contains sandalwood, cardamom, ambrette, pear and heliotrope. The last, Noorah, from turquoise, features galbanum, cardamom, iris, benzoin resin, tobacco, oak, patchouli oil and vanilla. The six are slated to hit European and Asian markets in September and reach the American market in February. They’ll be available as a set or separately, with a 100-ml bottle retailing for about $381 (€ 280).

Corruption and cognac: China's crackdown hits luxury - The Globe and Mail,"Wed, 20 Aug 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijQFodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGVnbG9iZWFuZG1haWwuY29tL3JlcG9ydC1vbi1idXNpbmVzcy9pbnRlcm5hdGlvbmFsLWJ1c2luZXNzL2NvcnJ1cHRpb24tYW5kLWNvZ25hYy1jaGluYXMtY3JhY2tkb3duLWhpdHMtbHV4dXJ5L2FydGljbGUyMDE0NjEwNC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Mainland Chinese visitors stand outside a Burberry store at Tsim Sha Tsui shopping district in Hong Kong January 18, 2013.Bobby Yip/Reuters Share

Cognac has become the latest casualty in China's war on corruption, a nationwide crackdown that has squeezed the country's once-plump luxury goods market.

Shipments of the French brandy to Asia, in particular China, have fallen sharply in the past year. Both the volume sold and the total value of shipments dropped around 20 per cent, according to French-based trade group National Interprofessional Bureau of Cognac (BNIC). The Chinese slowdown played a major part in an overall decline in global sales of cognac, with shipments down nearly 7 per cent in the past year and total value falling 10 per cent, the BNIC said. And that came after three years of record sales.

The decrease hasn't been driven by a change in consumer tastes, but rather the Chinese government's efforts to stamp out exorbitant spending by officials.

President Xi Jinping began clamping down last year on the spendthrift ways of the country's government workers, from military officers to politicians and civil servants. The crusade has put the kibosh on giving flashy gifts such as high-priced cognac or leather goods from Louis Vuitton, which had commonly been offered by officials to sweeten deals.

The fallout has slashed the sales growth of many luxury goods to low-single digits, and China is expected to keep this ""lacklustre"" pace of growth for the rest of the year, according to a recent report from Claudia D'Arpizio, a partner at consulting firm Bain & Co.

Ms. D'Arpizio projects the luxury goods market in China will grow by 2 per cent to 4 per cent in 2014, which is in line with Europe and a slower rate than North and South America. It's a major change from China's 20-per-cent increase in market size between 2011 and 2012.

""The corruption crackdown is still reducing sales,"" the report said, noting that the stricter regulations were especially impacting gifting.

It's a tightening spigot that one of the world's largest luxury companies has seen first-hand. In its most recent quarterly results, Paris-based LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SA, maker of Hennessy-branded cognac, cited heavy destocking of French brandy in China. The company attributed this to ""anti-extravaganza measures"" – a term used to describe the Chinese government's limitations on extravagant spending. The company's Louis Vuitton fashion line also saw softer sales in China in the quarter.

The financial results of other cognac-selling companies, such as Rémy Cointreau SA and Pernod Ricard SA, have also shown the Chinese market is a challenge. Fashion house Prada Group, and luxury giant Compagnie Financière Richemont SA, owner of Montblanc, Cartier and Van Cleef & Arpels SA brands, have also been showing similar signs of strain in China.

""This famous gifting issue has impacted our business in China especially for most of our brands, because most of our brands were the most regarded and offered as a gift,"" Richard Lepeu, co-CEO of Richemont, said on a recent earnings call.

It wasn't long ago that China was seen as the future for luxury goods, as incomes there rose while Western shoppers pulled back because of the recession.

But now the region has cooled off and the world's luxury market is entering a more mature phase. Retailers are reshaping their strategies in China from lengthening store hours to offering discounts in order to entice more customers to spend as growth slows down.

Some luxury producers are navigating the headwinds better than others. Burberry Group PLC's past quarterly results showed double-digit sales growth in mainland China and Hong Kong. The company's chief financial officer, Carol Fairweather, attributed this in part to targeting younger consumers and connecting with them digitally. The retailer is still betting on Asia to help drive growth and opened its first flagship store in Shanghai earlier this year.

Even more important than these strategic changes will be maintaining a reputation for quality. ""Consumers are so much more discerning now in China,"" said Milton Pedraza, chief executive officer of research and consulting firm Luxury Institute LLC. Brands such as Hermès, Bottega Veneta, Chanel and top-tier liquors are standing out with the Chinese consumers because they are truly unique and exclusive.

Tariffs and other charges often make luxury goods more expensive in China than abroad, leading many Chinese to buy their leather goods and other luxe products on trips. This is one area Canada benefits, as wealthy tourists flock to Toronto and Vancouver to shop, Bain's report notes.

Unless a housing bubble or debt crisis threaten the Chinese economy, luxury brands may have seen the worst of the slowdown.

""I think by the end of the year we'll be in a different mode. I think the government will have flexed its muscles, it will have made its point,"" Mr. Pedraza said. ""There's a lot of pent-up demand out there.""

The government could risk encouraging a larger black market for goods if its purchasing limitations go on too long or become too stringent, he added.

And industry heavyweights such as LVMH are also betting the government sanctions will ease up in the future. The company is building out its cognac-production capacity in anticipation of future growth. ""This will help the brands be in a good position when the destocking in China subsides, although this is expected to continue through the second half of the year,"" said Chris Hollis, director of financial communication, on a conference call."
