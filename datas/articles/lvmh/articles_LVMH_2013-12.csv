The French luxury conglomerate acquired the brand in July this year, and the new appointment begins the next phase of its development under LVMH's management.

Antoine, who reportedly played a key role in LVMH's investment in Loro Piana, is also ceo of Berluti - while his sister Delphine is second in command of the group's largest and most profitable label, Louis Vuitton. She has been credited with bringing new designers - including JW Anderson and Nicholas Kirkwood, to the luxury stable.

""He's just sort of like everybody else. I don't look at him as Bernard Arnault's son. He's just Antoine, just as he sees me as Marc, not creative director at Louis Vuitton,"" Marc Jacobs told WWD in 2007. ""He's really easy-going, quite nice to be around. He played piano for my 40th birthday with Jennifer Lopez. He just seems like one of your friends.""

Antoine Arnault has been in the headlines recently for reasons not relating to work too, having recently confirmed that he is set to become a father for the first time with his girlfriend Natalia Vodianova."

Are Salma Hayek and her wealthy French husband set to join 'l'exodus'? - Daily Mail,"Sun, 08 Dec 2013 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhaWx5bWFpbC5jby51ay9uZXdzL2FydGljbGUtMjUyMDIyNC9BcmUtU2FsbWEtSGF5ZWstd2VhbHRoeS1GcmVuY2gtaHVzYmFuZC1zZXQtam9pbi1sZXhvZHVzLmh0bWzSAXFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kYWlseW1haWwuY28udWsvbmV3cy9hcnRpY2xlLTI1MjAyMjQvYW1wL0FyZS1TYWxtYS1IYXllay13ZWFsdGh5LUZyZW5jaC1odXNiYW5kLXNldC1qb2luLWxleG9kdXMuaHRtbA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Are Salma Hayek and her billionaire French husband set to join 'l'exodus'?

Speculation rife they could be the latest wealthy people to leave France

But Mr Pinault's firm denies he has any plans to transfer finances to London



Salma Hayek and her billionaire Parisian husband are hunting for a new home in London, sparking suggestions they are set to join 'l'exodus' of wealthy French to countries with lower taxes.

The Hollywood star, 47, and her 51-year-old husband François-Henri Pinault, owner of Gucci and Yves Saint Laurent, are said to be scouring Belgravia, Kensington and Notting Hill for a family home.

Their search comes as a number of French tycoons have indicated they are preparing to leave their home country following a crackdown on high earners by Socialist president François Hollande.

Salma Hayek and Francois-Henri Pinault, pictured last year: The couple are reportedly searching for a family home in London, sparking speculation that they are set to join 'l'exodus' of wealthy French fleeing high taxes

The actor Gérard Depardieu was recently granted Russian citizenship and the fashion tycoon Bernard Arnault has applied for residency in Belgium, although he denies he plans to move his financial affairs to the country.

Likewise Kering, the luxury conglomerate in which Mr Pinault holds a controlling stake, confirmed that the couple intended to rent a house in London but insisted he would still pay tax in France.

Residency has become a sensitive issue in the country after President Hollande proposed a punitive 75 per cent tax on people earning more than €1m (£840,000) a year.

The tax, which has been included in a draft budget for next year and is planned to apply for two years, sent shockwaves through the French business community.

But many of those wealthy individuals who threatened to leave the country have backed down, at least publicly, after a backlash which accused them of a lack of patriotism.

After Gérard Depardieu handed back his French passport and moved to Russia he later said he loved France as much as ever and the controversy over his departure was 'a big misunderstanding', The Times reported.

It came after the actor, who has made more than 150 films, wrote an open letter to France's prime minister Jean-Marc Ayrault last year explaining why he was leaving his native country.

He wrote: ‘I am leaving because you consider that success, creation, talent, anything different, must be punished.’

In August, he said he considered himself a 'citizen of the world' after a Belgian town made him an honorary citizen.

Bernard Arnault, head of luxury goods group LVMH - which includes the brands Louis Vuitton, Christian Dior, Guerlain, Moet & Chandon and Hennessy - officially transferred his assets to Belgium in January.

He had applied for a Belgian passport soon after the Socialists won elections in France last year.

The move involved transferring his 31 per cent stake in Groupe Arnault, the family holding that controls LVMH, to Pilinvest, a Belgian firm that he specifically set up for the purpose.

Family home: Hayek with her daughter Valentina Pinault shortly after her birth in 2007. Eighteen months later she married Mr Pinault, the girl's father

Mr Arnault insisted at the time that he wanted merely to keep the £5.5billion-stake in LVMH in the hands of his five children after he dies.

Belgium has a much more lenient tax regime than France – raising an inheritance tax of three per cent, compared to 11 per cent in France. Unlike France, there is no wealth tax in Belgium either.

Hayek was seen leaving a Claridge's hotel in Mayfair with a leading property agent on Thursday, according to The Sunday Times.

Kering confirmed to the paper that she and Pinault, who have one daughter, intended to rent a house in London 'for personal reasons'.

The company insisted Pinault would remain a tax-paying French citizen. 'Kering is a Euronext Paris-listed group with global operations,' a spokesman told The Sunday Times.



'Its registered headquarters is in Paris and the group plans to move into a new headquarters building in Paris in 2015.'



Mr Pinault was introduced to Hayek, who has been described as the world's most beautiful woman, by a former Gucci executive and married in Paris on Valentine's Day 2009 - 18 months after their daughter was born.

Mr Pinault already had two children by his first wife and a third by Canadian supermodel Linda Evangelista. He took over the running of his father's business empire, then called PPR, ten years ago.

His family also own the auction house Christie's, Chateau Latour, a vineyard in Bordeaux, and French football club Stade Rennais."
Daniel Lalonde Steps Down As President Of Ralph Lauren International - Daily Front Row,"Mon, 09 Dec 2013 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vZmFzaGlvbndlZWtkYWlseS5jb20vZGFuaWVsLWxhbG9uZGUtc3RlcHMtZG93bi1hcy1wcmVzaWRlbnQtb2YtcmFscGgtbGF1cmVuLWludGVybmF0aW9uYWwv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"(NEW YORK) Daniel Lalonde, president of Ralph Lauren International, is bidding adieu to the company. Lalonde joined Ralph Lauren in January 2012 and was previously at LVMH, where he served as president and CEO of Moët & Chandon for three years. Prior to his role at Moët, Lalonde served as president of Louis Vuitton North America from 2006 to 2010.

Lalonde’s decision to leave his post came around the same time the company created an Office of the Chairman role in September, to be held by Ralph Lauren as chairman and CEO. Also that month, Jackwyn Nemerov became president and chief operating officer, succeeding Roger Farah, who became the executive vice chairman. The label’s chief financial officer Christopher Peterson, who works alongside Nemerov and Farah, subsequently took on additional roles as executive vice president and chief administrative officer.

As president of Ralph Lauren International, Lalonde had overseen international growth having spent some of his career in Europe. According to WWD, Lalonde left due to the changes in leadership. While there is no word yet on whether or not he will be replaced, Lalonde is reportedly looking for new opportunities in the luxury goods sphere."
Gokongwei family ventures into cosmetics business - Philstar.com,"Tue, 17 Dec 2013 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBoaWxzdGFyLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy8yMDEzLzEyLzE3LzEyNjg4NTMvZ29rb25nd2VpLWZhbWlseS12ZW50dXJlcy1jb3NtZXRpY3MtYnVzaW5lc3PSAWZodHRwczovL3d3dy5waGlsc3Rhci5jb20vYnVzaW5lc3MvMjAxMy8xMi8xNy8xMjY4ODUzL2dva29uZ3dlaS1mYW1pbHktdmVudHVyZXMtY29zbWV0aWNzLWJ1c2luZXNzL2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Gokongwei family ventures into cosmetics business

MANILA, Philippines - Robinsons Retail Holdings Inc., the multi-format retail chain of the Gokongwei family, is pursuing the cosmetics business for the first time as it acquires the operator of Shiseido and Benefit stores in the Philippines.

â€œRobinsons Retail, through its wholly-owned subsidiary Robinsons Specialty Stores Inc., acquired the assets of Beauty Skinnovations Retail Inc. (BSRI) on Dec. 13,â€ the firm said in a disclosure to the stock exchange.

BSRI is the operator of eight Shiseido branches and two Benefit stores in several malls in Metro Manila, Cebu and Davao.

â€œIn terms of running the cosmetics business, it is the first [foray] but we have cosmetics in our department stores run by concessionaires,â€ said Gina Roa-Dipaling, investor relations officer of Robinsons Retail.

â€œThe acquisition is in line with Robinsons Retailâ€™s strategy of expanding into new retail segments,â€ the firm said, adding that the 10 cosmetics stores will beef up the existing 1,000 branches under its network.

Aside from the stores, the acquisition also involves the right to sell Shiseido and Benefit cosmetics products under a distribution agreement with Luxasia Inc. and L Beauty Luxury Asia Inc.

Luxasia is a distributor of famous fragrance and cosmetics brands in the Philippines while L Beauty markets LVMH beauty brands nationwide.

The acquisition will be completed in February, Roa-Dipaling said, adding that there are plans to expand the business moving forward.

Benefit Cosmetics Llc is a San Francisco, California-based firm initially founded as a beauty boutique that specialized in quick-fix products. It is now a global beauty brand with more than 2,000 counters in over 30 countries.

For its part, hair care and cosmetics manufacturer Shiseido Co. Ltd. is the largest cosmetics firm in Japan and fourth largest worldwide. It has more than 25,000 store outlets worldwide offering a wide array of skin care, makeup and fragrance lines.

The recent deal is the second acquisition of Robinsons Retail since listing in the local bourse last month. The company earlier bought into Tarlac-based EZ Mart and EZ Supermarket chain to expand its presence in Central and Northern Luzon.

Robinsons Retail is the Philippinesâ€™ second largest retail operating under nine formats: Robinsons Supermarket, Robinsons Department Store, Ministop, South Star Drug, Handyman Do it Best, True Value, Howards Storage World, Robinsons Appliances, Toys R Us, Saizen and a selection of international fashion apparel.

The firm aims to increase its store network to approximately 1,400 by end-2014. The company, which started operations in 1980, ended 2012 with 912 stores.

The firm reported a consolidated net income of P2.04 billion in January to September, more than double the P894.5 million last year, while consolidated net sales jumped nearly 20 percent to P47.17 billion from P39.43 billion a year ago.

The retail chain debuted in the local bourse last month through a $621-million initial public offering, with further growth hinged on the continued uptick in the economy and the increasing disposable income of the middle class.

Aside from retail, the Gokongwei family is also into budget airline (Cebu Pacific), banking (Robinsons Bank Corp.), property (Robinsons Land), petrochemicals (JG Summit Petrochemicals Corp.), and snacks and beverage (Universal Robina Corp.)."
