LVMH acquires Les Tanneries Roux - TRBusiness,"Fri, 04 May 2012 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRyYnVzaW5lc3MuY29tL3JlZ2lvbmFsLW5ld3MvaW50ZXJuYXRpb25hbC9sdm1oLWFjcXVpcmVzLWxlcy10YW5uZXJpZXMtcm91eC82ODA5MNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"

LVMH has acquired the prestige leather product manufacturer Les Tanneries Roux for an undisclosed sum and Jean-Claude Ricomard will remain Chairman of the company.





Founded in 1803 and based in Romans-sur-Isère, Les Tanneries Roux makes quality leather products and has partnered with houses such as Louis Vuitton, Christian Dior, Loewe, Céline and Moynat over the last twenty years. LVMH says that it was it was Les Tanneries Roux that developed the smooth and supple calf skins suitable for high-end leather goods products.

LVMH adds that Jean-Claude Ricomard will remain Chairman of the company and it says that this acquisition reflects LVMH’s strategy to develop its expertise as already demonstrated by the creation of ‘Les tanneries de la Comète’ in 2009 and by its recent investment in the crocodile leather tannery Heng Long in October, 2011.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999585151672363}",neutral,0.9999585151672363,0
Louis Vuitton or Hermès? - INSEAD Knowledge,"Thu, 17 May 2012 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8va25vd2xlZGdlLmluc2VhZC5lZHUvZWNvbm9taWNzLWZpbmFuY2UvbG91aXMtdnVpdHRvbi1vci1oZXJtZXPSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"What China can learn

China has become the world's second largest market for luxury goods yet it still can’t really boast its own brands despite markets opening up over the last three decades. Louis Vuitton and Hermès are two of the world’s luxury giants—with annual per capita turnover at 3.35 million euros and 3.25 million euros respectively in 2010— their growth has been stable and sustainable, even in a tough economic environment. What can Chinese companies interested in building a luxury brand learn from them? Looking at the evolution of Louis Vuitton and Hermès, we can identify shared features. First, both companies began with the development and manufacture of classic products that have stood the test of time. These products distinguish themselves on six key traits: high prices; excellent quality; uniqueness and scarcity; aesthetic and emotional value; rich brand history and heritage; and an intangible symbolism from owning the brand. The companies then established a solid business model and rapidly expanded overseas. The international markets proved to be a great platform to showcase the excellent workmanship and to help establish a high-end international brand image. At the same time, the two brands are very different in their management practices. Louis Vuitton is part of the publicly-listed, multi-brand conglomerate Louis Vuitton Moët Hennessy Group [LVMH], while Hermès remains a family-operated independent brand. In terms of strategy, Louis Vuitton is rather progressive; its parent company has expanded and continues to build its multi-brand empire through acquisitions. LVMH has built one of the strongest brand portfolios in the sector, counting 60 top brands among its five divisions and other operations, with Louis Vuitton as its “star of stars”. Its message to markets and investors: each of the brands will likely become Louis Vuitton one day, thereby offering great potential for future growth and value creation for potential investors. On the contrary, Hermès’ strategy is more conservative; it focuses on the brand's heritage and impeccable craftsmanship, building value over time and through quality—they prefer endogenous growth. Even when it is unable to meet market demand for its iconic Kelly bag, Hermès prefers not to expand production. This is almost impossible for a listed company. The Hermès model is the basis of the luxury industry; if a luxury product loses its characteristic uniqueness, it then becomes a mass consumer product and the price cannot be justified. Louis Vuitton, however, did not perform well in a competitive marketplace and was eventually acquired by the Moët Hennessy Group. The capital markets were able to provide a lifeline to the struggling brand and LVMH was able to successfully restructure and revitalise the brand.China’s reforms have opened up the market considerably but the country’s economic and social realities haven’t been able to support the development of a luxury brand. The lack of fundamentals can be explained. 1.Economic: There has been a lack of capital and talent in China’s manufacturing and creative industries because most of the money and talent have rushed into the booming financial market and property sector that are more likely to yield ultra-high returns in the short term. 2.Social: In a society where people mostly are seeking short-term windfall profits, very few are willing to engage in the manufacture of fine products. Fast-moving consumer goods are much more profitable. 3.Cultural: The Cultural Revolution destroyed the country's traditional cultural values, hindering the modernisation of arts and culture. 4.Legal: In a country where intellectual property rights are not effectively protected and where counterfeiters get rich much faster, innovators are giving way to imitators. But, a new round of macroeconomic adjustments, corporate restructuring and cultural reforms is giving China a golden opportunity for the development of its luxury goods industry. The rapid growth of luxury consumers is an additional positive. For new entrants, “a long history of tradition and a legendary brand story” may not be readily available, but they can still succeed by upholding the spirit of fine craftsmanship and exerting great efforts on other features. Coach, for example, has successfully established itself as a leading, local, luxury brand in the U.S. despite existing for only around 60 years. Its success can be attributed to an adherence to exquisite craftsmanship and good quality products. In recent years some Chinese companies have been applying these practices. The Beijing-based Zhaoyicuiwu jewellery brand, for instance, has produced a range of popular jewellery products by rediscovering the long-lost art of filigree mosaic and integrating it with modern innovation. Currently, it isn’t practical for Chinese companies to adopt the development model of the LVMH Group as it first requires the emergence of a large number of competitive local luxury brands. Perhaps to their advantage, Chinese brands are also operating in an economic environment and under market conditions that are very different. Today, for instance, they have faster ways to grow by tapping into capital markets. By learning from the experiences of international luxury brands such as Louis Vuitton and Hermès, and leveraging on favourable timing, Chinese brand builders should continuously upgrade their technologies and improve the value of their products in order to create genuine brands.

Ravi Thakran: L Capital Is Focussed On The Layers Below Luxury - Forbes India,"Thu, 31 May 2012 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmJlc2luZGlhLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL2Nsb3NlLXJhbmdlL3JhdmktdGhha3Jhbi1sLWNhcGl0YWwtaXMtZm9jdXNzZWQtb24tdGhlLWxheWVycy1iZWxvdy1sdXh1cnkvMzMwMDQvMdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Ravi Thakran

Designation: Managing partner of L Capital Asia—the LVMH sponsored private equity fund

Age: 48

Education: MBA from Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad

Career: Worked as group president for South Asia, South East Asia & the Middle East for the LVMH Group and director for Groupe Arnault in Asia. Earlier, he has worked with the Tata Group, Swatch Group and Nike.

Interests: Socialising, travelling, reading, hiking, food and wine with friends, collecting art and public speaking



Q. Tell us about L Capital’s recent purchase of an 8 percent stake (valued at a reported Rs 100-125 crore) in Fabindia. Why is an ethnic wear retail chain important to the private equity fund of a luxury conglomerate?

First of all, it is important to remember that the mandate of L Capital is different [from LVMH]. LVMH’s mandate is to be the global leader and absolute authority in luxury. But at L Capital, we’re not only about luxury, but also aspirational consumption, meaning layers below luxury. We believe that the knowledge we have in building luxury brands, market channels, building innovative products and creative solutions to reach the market is relevant not just to luxury. In Asia, entrepreneurs have learnt very well how to produce good quality products at reasonable prices. What they have not learnt very well is how to build great brands. Can we, with our know-how, help these companies grow faster and become more profitable if we bring this value-add to them?



Secondly, we want to work with companies, which are signature brands in their own countries; those that have the potential to translate internationally. In that space, we found Fabindia to be a fantastic company. I believe Fabindia is a great story of a commercial good marrying a social good, a company that gives livelihood to 40,000-plus artisans without NGO and Aid help or grants is a great enterprise and business model.



Q. What do you see as other growth areas For L Capital’s private equity investments in India?

So far, there haven’t been many companies aimed at kids’ apparel and toys; it’s not an organised sector. There is one company Lilliput: We signed a term sheet on Lilliput, but it has been in the media for the wrong reasons.



Q. To clarify, what exactly is L Capital’s current position in relation to the company?

We are closely studying Lilliput now, so we can say yes, we are looking at Lilliput very seriously. And we need to see how we can ring-fence ourselves from any toxicity that has happened in the past, and still build the company for the future.



Q. Why, despite the controversies surrounding it, do you think Lilliput is still worth considering?

The market category is underleveraged and underpenetrated. But this category is potentially huge and we see a phenomenal secularity in its growth trend. Despite all the controversies, Lilliput is a leader in the category. There is a lot of intellectual property out there, which can be exploited to build it further. Yes, the brand has been damaged in the minds of the financial community and the media, but not really the consumer. Would we still do it? Question mark as of now… if not them, we would invest behind someone else; for sure we would want to invest in kids wear.

Chinese Retailer Bosideng Goes Global While Luxury Brands Seek Acceptance - Jing Daily,"Tue, 29 May 2012 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vamluZ2RhaWx5LmNvbS9wb3N0cy9jaGluZXNlLXJldGFpbGVyLWJvc2lkZW5nLWdvZXMtZ2xvYmFsLXdoaWxlLWx1eHVyeS1icmFuZHMtc2Vlay1hY2NlcHRhbmNl0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"As major international mass-market retailers like Uniqlo, H&M and Zara continue to expand in the China market, some Chinese fast-fashion brands are setting their sights on overseas markets. Taking a different approach than competitors like Ochirly -- into which LVMH invested US$200 million earlier this year -- that focus singularly on the mainland China market, mass-market retailer Bosideng recently announced plans to make its international debut in London. According to a company release, Bosideng, which currently operates over 8,000 retail outlets throughout China, will officially launch a ""premium menswear brand"" at its first overseas flagship on London's South Molton Street on July 26.

According to Drapers , the majority of the products stocked at Bosideng's new London location will be manufactured in Italy, mainland Europe and China, with designs created in collaboration with Nick Holland and Ash Gangotra, who previously worked with former Oasis frontman Liam Gallagher and his label, Pretty Green . Though the company currently has no further European expansion plans, a spokeswoman said this week that a broader roll-out ""is possible."" As Bosideng UK chief executive Wayne Zhu said, “A move into Europe has been a goal of Bosideng for some time and we’re very excited to be launching in such a prominent location in London.”

If there's one surprising aspect to Bosideng's British expansion, it's not that it's happening now but that it's taken so long. As Retail Week writes today , the real story here is that it's interesting (yet understandable) that more Chinese retailers have yet to make their way to international markets like the UK:

[W]hile the general economy may be motoring, China’s retail offer is still relatively undeveloped, meaning most retailers lack the experience to attempt foreign markets.







“The retailers out there simply haven’t got the decades of experience that many of the western brands have got,” says Planet Retail global research director Rob Gregory.







And it’s not just a lack of experience that are putting Chinese retailers off expanding - there’s also the allure of the huge domestic market.

The last point seems to be the most important, particularly for Chinese mass-market brands that have already built a strong presence at home. While international flagships by the likes of Bosideng could widen the consumer base somewhat, increase prestige in the eyes of Chinese consumers, and attract outbound Chinese tourists in London and elsewhere, its unlikely that they'll be very profitable. Unless Bosideng manages to create a truly high-end line that can command premium prices -- a prospect that seems virtually impossible, considering its awkward Western name and lack of visibility in overseas markets -- it will be duking it out with established retailers like Topshop. That's why a truly large-scale expansion effort in Europe is an unlikely possibility for Bosideng. A larger global footprint most likely has the long-term aim of selling the European collection at certain locations within China, for which the brand can charge a premium.

Looking at this effort from a broader perspective, Bosideng's international goals illustrate one of the major challenges facing Chinese brands on the world stage: a struggle for acceptance. The majority of mass-market retailers, of which China has many, won't be able to rationalize the huge cost of maintaining international flagships while eking out minuscule profit margins. For China's upstart luxury brands, however, international expansion could prove more reasonable given it's done correctly. At the moment, some of these brands are plotting overseas moves in earnest while understanding that it'll likely be years before ""made-in-China"" luxury products gain a significant measure of acceptance abroad. As the FT noted this week , though 13 Chinese brands rank among the top 100 in the Global BrandZ list, none are ""true household names with a significant global footprint.""

The challenge of courting luxury shoppers overseas and combating international conceptions of Chinese products as of inferior quality is compounded by the same challenges at home for high-end Chinese brands. In segments like cosmetics, though, some Chinese brands have seen some success at home by promoting either their history and Imperial heritage (in the case of 182-year-old brand

(谢馥春), which was a favorite in the Qing Dynasty court) or their traditional Chinese ingredients (newer brands

and

).

Though popularity in the Qing court in the 1830s, or ingredients like duck egg powder, might not be too exciting to Western consumers, celebrating -- rather than hiding -- ""Chinese-ness"" might be what eventually helps China's home-grown prestige brands crack international markets. In this way, cosmetic brands could teach apparel-focused brands a thing or two about attacking niches. Among the non-cosmetic brands currently looking at overseas expansion is

, the Hermès-supported Shanghai brand led by Jiang Qiong'er (Jing Daily interview).

As the FT points out this week, Shang Xia's strategy of calling back to China's long history and traditional craftsmanship could work internationally, as its goal is to ""resurrect the image of an older China where only the best would do."" Indeed, many are closely watching Shang Xia to gauge the potential for Chinese luxury brands abroad, particularly as the brand plans to open its next location not in Beijing but in Paris, about 200 meters away from the Rue De Sèvres Hermès flagship.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9997825026512146}",neutral,0.9997825026512146,0
"Bordeaux 2011: Latour and Cheval Blanc, similar prices meet with different reactions - Decanter.com","Thu, 24 May 2012 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlY2FudGVyLmNvbS93aW5lLW5ld3MvYm9yZGVhdXgtMjAxMS1sYXRvdXItYW5kLWNoZXZhbC1yZWxlYXNlLWF0LXNpbWlsYXItcHJpY2VzLWJ1dC10by1kaWZmZXJlbnQtcmVhY3Rpb25zLTMxMDgxL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Bordeaux superstars Chateau Latour and Cheval Blanc are the biggest releases of the day – and they have had radically different reactions from the trade.

Cheval Blanc: pricing itself out of the system?



Latour, one of the finest wines of the vintage for many critics, has come out at €450 ex-negociant and is on the market in the UK for around £4,800 a case.

Cheval Blanc, co-owned by LVMH, whose chairman Bernard Arnault is a business rival of Latour’s owner François Pinault, came out at €465, down 48.3%.

It is on the market for around £4,500 a case – merchants are pricing it cheaper than Latour despite it coming out at a higher price.

Merchants are describing Latour as a must-buy – this vintage is the last to be offered en primeur. According to Bordeaux insiders the first allocation is sold out and a second tranche is expected today.

They have different things to say about Cheval Blanc, however.

Charles Lea at Lea & Sandeman joked that the renowned St Emilion property – the 2011 was described by Berry Bros as ‘ethereal’ – had trumped Latour ‘by withdrawing from the primeurs system a year earlier than Latour. Like Figeac yesterday afternoon, it has achieved this by pricing its wine at a level which means that there is no real reason to buy it en primeur.’

Another merchant, Farr Vintners, told its customers that although the 2011 ‘is delicious… at £4500 you can buy the magnificent 1998 vintage from us and for £1000 less we have the 2006, 1995, 2001, 2003, 1999 etc etc. The list goes on.

‘Why on earth they think that our customers will pay more for an en primeur vintage than ready-to-drink vintages of the same quality is beyond us.’

Cheval Blanc’s prices have caused controversy for a number of years. Last year’s €900 a bottle opening price on the 2010 had merchants rebelling: BBR for one said they ‘could not endorse’ such an ‘incredible’ price.

St Emilion’s Chateau Figeac released yesterday at €72, down 57.14% from last year’s €168, a discount that found little favour. Farrs’ Stephen Browett told Decanter.com they have not sold a single case.

Lea agreed. It is ‘way down compared to 2010,’ he said, ‘but then we did not sell a bottle of that, so where’s the real market?’

On the Farr Vintners website Browett said, ‘You can easily find Figeac 2008, 2007, 2006, 2004 and 2002 for sale in the market at under £600 per case so there’s little enthusiasm for buying the 2011 en primeur [at £750].’

Other releases today include Latour’s second wine Forts de Latour at €114, down 29.63%, Cheval Blanc’s second wine Petit Cheval at €112, Chateau Canon at €62.50, down 30.5%, Chateau Pavie at €114, down 49.3% and Bellevue Mondotte €108, down 52%.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999935626983643}",neutral,0.9999935626983643,0
Tequila Avion Spoofs S&M To Make A Point 05/04/2012 - MediaPost Communications,"Fri, 04 May 2012 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1lZGlhcG9zdC5jb20vcHVibGljYXRpb25zL2FydGljbGUvMTczODQ4L3RlcXVpbGEtYXZpb24tc3Bvb2ZzLXNtLXRvLW1ha2UtYS1wb2ludC5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"by Karlene Lukovitz @KLmarketdaily, May 3, 2012

Tequila Avión’s first television ad, being launched on ESPN on May 4, is, well … bound to get attention, given its playful but decidedly naughty, S&M-themed approach.

The spot shows a woman -- played by actress Katie Savoy (who made her bikini-clad debut in a Verizon Wireless campaign) – wowing her man by showing up at his loft garbed from head to toe in black leather. After pouring some melted wax from a candle, she proceeds to blindfold him (his response: “Do we need a safe word?”). Ultimately, however, she just lets him sniff a glass of Tequila Avión Silver, takes a sip herself, and exits, noting: “That’ll do for now.”

On-screen title copy during the spot announces the tagline: “Pain has its place … just not in tequila.” Accompanying copy for the bottle shot at the end: “Choose pleasure.”

advertisement advertisement

The spot, from agency Walton Isaacson, will be aired in 60-, 30- and 15-second versions on national and local networks.

“When people think of tequila, they tend to think of pain -- because when they drink most tequilas, there’s that harsh, biting sensation that more often than not registers on their faces,” says Avión president Jenna Fagnan, formerly a VP at LVMH’s TAG Heuer and business director for Dom Perignon. “This ad turns that perception on its head through the combination of its scenario and tagline, making the point that Avión is a tequila that delivers a smooth, delicious experience.”

The ad also fits with Avión’s “irreverent” brand personality, and is designed to appeal to both men and women, she says. (Women represent half of tequila drinkers, in no small part because of the margarita’s continuing reign as America’s most popular cocktail.)

Fagnan proudly points out that the ultra-premium Avión brand, launched in the U.S. in July 2010, cleaned up at the recent 2012 San Francisco World Spirits Competition (which has high industry cred because of its blind taste-test judging). Tequila Avión won both the “World’s Best Tequila” and “Best White Spirit” awards, while the brand’s other two varieties or expressions, Avión Anejo and Reposado, respectively picked up gold and silver medals.

All three varieties were launched simultaneously, after a lengthy development process by Ken Austin, chairman of Avión Tequila LLC, a former Seagram’s exec and a tequila aficionado. The brand uses agave sourced from Mexico’s best agave-growing highlands, and is distilled by expert agave growers using a proprietary process, notes Fagnan.

The timing of the launch of the Avión company by Austin and Kenny Dichter (previously partners in founding the Marquis Jet private aviation company), with Fagnan on board as president (backed by an initial $5.95 million in equity from 71 seed investors), was dead-on.

Tequila dollar sales have seen 40% growth over the past six years. The overall category’s sales grew nearly 4% in 2011, and premium tequila sales jumped more than 11% in 2011, points out Fagnan. Initially launched in California and New York, the brand’s distribution expanded rapidly, and in July 2011, Avión inked a global distribution deal with Pernod Ricard (now a minority owner). Currently, it’s distributed in all 50 states, plus Canada, according to Fagnan.

By happenstance, the brand gained its widest initial awareness through its exposure on HBO’s “Entourage.” HBO doesn’t allow paid product placements, but the brand’s cost-free inclusion came about because of Dichter’s long friendship with the series’ originator. The exposure proved a somewhat mixed blessing, because it led many consumers to assume that the brand was made up for the series, rather than a real tequila brand.

But that misperception has been overcome, says Fagnan, who reports that the brand has employed all of the usual trade- and retail-oriented promotion/sampling methods common to spirits, along with awareness-building efforts including appearances at events where a tequila brand’s presence is “unexpected”; flying banners over beach areas (“avion” means “airplane” in both Spanish and French); and Austin’s frequent exposure on television and other media as a tequila expert.

Another new twist: On May 4 and 5, Delta Airlines will be offering long-haul-flight passengers free margaritas made with Avión, and thereafter, will sell the custom-made drinks on its flights, reports Fagnan.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999932050704956}",neutral,0.9999932050704956,0

UNESCO honors Jeonju as City of Gastronomy - 코리아타임스,"Fri, 18 May 2012 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmtvcmVhdGltZXMuY28ua3Ivd3d3L25hdGlvbi8yMDI0LzAzLzExM18xMTEyODMuaHRtbNIBP2h0dHBzOi8vbS5rb3JlYXRpbWVzLmNvLmtyL3BhZ2VzL2FydGljbGUuYW1wLmFzcD9uZXdzSWR4PTExMTI4Mw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"By Alexander Ahn



Jeonju, capital of North Jeolla Province, has been named by UNESCO as this year’s City of Gastronomy.



The announcement of the Creative Cities Network’s Gastronomy City winner came Tuesday, as Jeonju is now expected to lead the globalization effort of Korean cuisine. Other Network categories include literature, film, music, crafts & folk art, design and media arts.



This is the first time a Korean city has won in the food department. Previous winners of the culinary division include Papayan, Colombia, in 2005, Chengdu, China in 2010, and Ostersund, Sweden, also in 2010. Jeonju is the fourth winner.



In the past Seoul and Icheon have also won their own Creative Cities Network award. In 2010 they won in the categories of design and crafts, and folk art, respectively.



UNESCO’s Director-General Irina Georgieva Bokova confirmed in an official announcement letter that “Jeonju, as the newest UNESCO City of Gastronomy, has permission to use UNESCO’s logo for worldwide promotion.”



The title was awarded based on various aspects, including food and traditional culture, in which Jeonju received high scores. Jeonju’s homemade food preparation style, which has been passed down for thousands of years, was highly praised.



Jeonju Mayor Song Ha-jin said, “It is very rewarding that our efforts in preserving our traditional culture and food has gotten us recognized by UNESCO.”



Jeonju is well-known for promoting the traditional local dish, bibimbap. It is also home to popular vegetarian restaurants that serve traditional food and pine wine.



UNESCO, as a specialized agency of the United Nations, is responsible for promoting peace and security through international collaboration of education, natural sciences, social and human sciences, culture, and communication and information.

Stuart Vevers and Lisa Montague, the British duo who set Mulberry on the road to global superstardom, have taken their recipe to Loewe, the luxury heritage brand based in Madrid. Will it taste as sweet?

At the apex of any successful global brand there's invariably a binary relationship that combines a distinctive creative point of view with an equally strong commercial one: Yves Saint Laurent and Pierre Bergé; Tom Ford and Domenico del Sole; Miuccia Prada and her husband, Patrizio Bertelli; Burberry's Christopher Bailey has Angela Ahrendts. At Loewe (pronounced Lu-ervay), there's Stuart Vevers and Lisa Montague.

The name may still require some phonetic explanation, but in its native Spain, Loewe inspires the same degree of reverence accorded to Hermès in France or Rolls Royce in the UK. In pre-crisis times, Spanish ministers were presented with a Loewe briefcase when they gained power. Even now, a Loewe printed cashmere scarf is a fail-safe coming-of-age gift. The brand's as Spanish as castanets. And like many national treasures, it's owned by foreigners (the French giant LVMH), and run by Brits - Vevers and Montague.

Vevers and Montague previously worked together at Mulberry, where Vevers collaborated with Katie Hillier and Luella Bartley on the Gisele - the bag, among others he did, that helped propel Mulberry from its horse-and-hound niche towards an international platform. Vevers had also done a stint at Bottega Veneta, the prestigious Italian leather house, so he was hardly an ingénue. And Montague had worked for Cerruti. But while it's practically de rigueur to install Brits in a foreign house nowadays, not many get to head up a label as symbolic as Loewe. Delphine Arnault, daughter of Bernard Arnault, head of LVMH, not only installed the duo, she handed them the keys of the house.

Vevers, a smooth-skinned 38-year-old with an almost Tintin-esque youthfulness, got there first, arriving in Madrid in 2008, a year before Montague. The first thing he did, apart from enrolling in Spanish lessons (""Still not fluent,"" he confesses with a slightly defeated air) was examine its most famous product.

If you were seeking the definition of the quintessential classic, Loewe's Amazona bag would probably do it. First, there's its timeless, deceptively simple boxy proportions - Vevers reckons there are 200 components in all, many painstakingly crafted by hand. But it's the Amazona's evocative social relevance that makes it a rival to Hermès's Kelly bag, Chanel's 2.55 or Vuitton's Speedy. Launched in 1975, when Spain emerged blinking from the dark, patriarchal Franco era, it was the first home-grown luxury bag that offered function and status to newly independent women experiencing the novelty of travelling and working by themselves. They needed a capacious bag to hold all their belongings, one that would remind them and everyone else how well they were doing. The Amazona - discreet, conservative, with unimpeachably logical proportions - was it. And Vevers changed it.

Not completely - he lengthened the handles, refined the hardware, adding curves to the padlock, subtracting some of its bulk by making it marginally longer and slightly smaller, and softening the leather so that it became less rugged and utilitarian, but not so much it felt decadent (""Spanish leather is incredible,"" says Vevers, ""very hardwearing yet amazingly soft""), and added the obligatory mini-sized playful version. It took him six months, but he succeeded. The Amazona mark II is functional, bling-less and quietly luxurious. It's only when you see the old and new versions side by side that you're reminded how much God, and classic status, reside in the details. Vevers's friend, Katie Hillier, calls it ""a classic bag for cool girls"". Yet it was a gamble for Vevers, let alone the brand. ""When I arrived, there was an attitude of: 'Can you design us an It-bag please, to put us on the map?' But I felt it was very important to get away from all that. I consider the Amazona more of an emblem. I wanted a bag that could evolve year after year. It had to be more than something you just chucked a load of bling at.""

It was an astute decision, which plays well to the home crowd. The Amazona accounts for 30 per cent of the brand's annual 200 million euro turnover, which has been growing steadily overall, not only in the Far East, but at home, too. Montague believes that Spain's dire economic situation has made Spaniards appreciate design classics even more, not just for their perceived longevity, but because ""people here are grateful for anyone having success at the moment. The fact that we've expanded our factory in Madrid and are keeping crafts alive is really appreciated.""

The respect for craft is central to Loewe's identity - as it is to Hermès and, increasingly, to brands such as Gucci and Louis Vuitton, which preferred, in the Nineties, to focus on their fashion credentials. While Loewe debuted Vevers's ready-to-wear clothes collection on the catwalk in 2010 (every luxury brand needs a catwalk presence, it seems), last month, the company opened a small, self-styled museum in Barcelona, where archive pictures of Ava Gardner are showcased next to 90-year-old luggage, a hologram of an artisan toiling on a bag and, naturally, current editions.

The company - originally a small leather goods workshop, founded by a collective of Spanish craftsmen in 1846 - was joined by Enrique Roessberg Loewe, an immigrant leather specialist in 1872. A fourth generation Loewe is still involved. Spanish passion and Enrique's precision turned out to be a happy match. It may have acquired a Germanic name, but by 1905 Loewe had won ""Official Supplier to the Spanish Royal Crown"" status, with impeccably constructed box-calf leather luggage and a nascent collection of It-bags and silk scarves. Despite the inconvenience of a civil war and 40 years of fascist dictatorship, Loewe thrived, opening a flamboyant flagship in Madrid in 1939. In the Fifties, it became Ava Gardner's favourite shopping haunt after Ernest Hemingway took her for some retail therapy in Madrid shortly before her break-up with Frank Sinatra. ""In a way, those dour decades helped preserve the craftsmanship,"" says Montague.

There's no resentment, she says, among the staff about being headed by foreigners. ""The bigger issue is about me being a woman. When I first got here I'd walk into a room and everyone would be looking over my shoulder for the man in charge.""

Chauvinism notwithstanding, it's clear that both Vevers and Montague - complete with her journalist husband and two young children - have settled into Madrid and are absorbing Spanish culture. ""Madrid has a reputation for being quite staid, but scratch the surface and there's a vibrant party scene,"" notes Vevers. ""It's like the colours - people think of Spain and they conjure up a moody, Velázquez palette, but there's a lot of dazzling colour, hence all the colours of the Flamenco bag. And, by the way, what Spaniard would have had the gall to call an accessory something as cheesy as the Flamenco? But for us it's cool.""

Sometimes it takes an outsider to get to the essence of what can make the national international. For Montague, it was the discovery that a brand hugely respected in Spain had almost no presence in the US. ""We're still tiny there - that's what makes the potential so great."" For Vevers, it was meeting a Buddhist monk - surely no possessions? - who rhapsodised about a Loewe Papelle bag he owned. ""For me, Loewe's Spanishness is what makes it so unique and intriguing,"" says Vevers. ""The management might be international but the 200 artisans are all Spanish. That shows in everything they do. It's not delicate or light. It's strong and bold. These bags couldn't come out of any other country.""","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9998408555984497}",neutral,0.9998408555984497,0

Position Chief executive, Nicole Farhi

Four months after it bought Nicole Farhi, Kelso Place Asset Management is trying a new chief executive on for size. François Steiner, who had a ten-year period running various bits of LVMH, the luxury conglomerate, replaces Niki Scordi at the fashion chain.

Mr Steiner said that he was “thrilled” to be working with Ms Farhi, who is the company’s creative director. “With the new flagship store and plans for UK and international expansion, this is a very exciting time for the brand,” he added.

The Frenchman, 49, may be forgiven for garlanding praise on his new employer’s designer. He lasted only five months at his previous job after reportedly clashing with the founding family. He left LVMH, owner","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.8603613972663879}",positive,0.8603613972663879,1
