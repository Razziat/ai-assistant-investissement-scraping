LVMH Shares Surge as Fashion Brands Overcome Asian Blues - The Business of Fashion,"Wed, 03 Feb 2016 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzb2ZmYXNoaW9uLmNvbS9uZXdzL2ZpbmFuY2UvbHZtaC1zaGFyZXMtc3VyZ2UtYXMtZmFzaGlvbi1kaXZpc2lvbi1vdmVyY29tZXMtYXNpYW4tYmx1ZXMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS, France — LVMH shares gained the most in a year after results beat estimates on demand for Louis Vuitton bags in Japan and Europe, providing some relief for a beleaguered luxury-goods industry.

The stock rose as much as 7.4 percent to 155.9 euros in early Paris trading, the biggest intraday advance since Feb. 4, 2015.

A better-than-expected fourth-quarter performance in fashion and leather-goods provided a highlight for LVMH, which is benefiting from a broad spread of goods covering Celine dresses, Moet and Chandon champagne and Christian Dior perfumes. That helped compensate for a slowdown in the watches & jewelry unit, where sales were hurt by a slump in Asian demand that caused Swiss rival Swatch Group AG to report earnings that missed estimates.

“When the environment gets tough, the highest-quality companies like LVMH tend to stand out,” Rogerio Fujimori, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, said in a note. “In the present environment, LVMH shares deserve to re-rate versus peers given its relative defensive growth profile.”

Profit from recurring operations advanced 16 percent to 6.61 billion euros ($7.2 billion), Paris-based LVMH said Tuesday after markets closed. Analysts predicted 6.5 billion euros, according to the average of 27 estimates.

‘Strong Progress’

Fourth-quarter revenue rose 5 percent on an organic basis, topping the 3.9 percent estimate, thanks to “strong progress” in Europe, the U.S. and Japan, it said. The company’s flagship label Louis Vuitton is growing again after a revamp and had a “remarkable year,” the company said.

Fashion and leather-goods is LVMH’s largest division, accounting for more than a third of sales and more than half of earnings before interest and tax. Quarterly sales at the unit that includes brands such as Fendi, Celine and Givenchy rose 3 percent, beating estimates for growth of 1 percent. The watches and jewelry division also posted a 3 percent gain, although that was well below the 8 percent expected by analysts.

On a conference call, LVMH Chief Executive Officer Bernard Arnault expressed confidence that the group can continue to outperform its luxury sector peers in the upcoming year, despite an ""uncertain"" business climate.

Singapore's Alexis Horowitz-Burdick sold her cosmetics start-up Luxola to LVMH - CNBC,"Sun, 14 Feb 2016 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tLzIwMTYvMDIvMTQvc2luZ2Fwb3Jlcy1hbGV4aXMtaG9yb3dpdHotYnVyZGljay1zb2xkLWhlci1jb3NtZXRpY3Mtc3RhcnQtdXAtbHV4b2xhLXRvLWx2bWguaHRtbNIBdmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tL2FtcC8yMDE2LzAyLzE0L3NpbmdhcG9yZXMtYWxleGlzLWhvcm93aXR6LWJ1cmRpY2stc29sZC1oZXItY29zbWV0aWNzLXN0YXJ0LXVwLWx1eG9sYS10by1sdm1oLmh0bWw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"watch now

Success for an e-commerce businesses come in many shapes, from building a multi-billion business empire to carving out a small but lucrative niche.

In the case of Singapore-based Alexis Horowitz-Burdick, 34, the niche she carved was so successful that it attracted the eye of French luxury goods giant LVMH, which then bought her beauty and cosmetics retail site Luxola.com for an undisclosed sum.

Horowitz-Burdick started Luxola in the city-state in 2011, and by 2015, expanded into 12 markets in the Asia Pacific region, offering a 4,000-strong product range from 250 high-end brands.

""The first year was very tough,"" she told CNBC's ""Managing Asia"". ""We started in an environment in 2011 when I don't think e-commerce was of course nearly as popular as it is today.""

Horowitz-Burdick said that her small team doubled up on roles and quickly learned the tricks of the trade.

""We had no idea how to do [product delivery],"" she said. ""When we first started getting orders, we hired one person to be our full-time delivery driver in Singapore.""

Alexis Horowitz-Burdick

But with not enough money to provide the various delivery options expected by of e-tailers today, the team at Luxola didn't initially have a backup plan to ensure that deliveries remained speedy during periods of high demand.

""So we would all just get into taxis, and run around, and deliver goods to our customers,"" Horowitz-Burdick recalled.

After its takeover by LVMH in 2015, Luxola.com was rebranded Sephora Digital, becoming the e-commerce arm of the French cosmetics brand in Southeast Asia, with Horowitz-Burdick as managing director.

Some of LVMH's famous luxury brands include Louis Vuitton, Moet & Chandon, De Beers Diamond Jewellers, Dior, and Sephora.

""I couldn't think of a better partner for us,"" she said. ""We have been able to shift our site to the Sephora site in less than five months after acquisition and bring on all of the brands everybody loves from Sephora.""

While she lost the brand name Luxola, the founder says she gained in terms of Sephora's significant international brand recognition.

But Horowitz-Burdick did not hit start-up paydirt without first paying her dues.

Her previous online business, The SweetSpot, a high-end group buying site, failed to take off, so she sold the platform to a multinational corporation.

""But it did introduce me to e-commerce in Singapore, with a view to the broader Southeast Asia region,"" she said. ""What I learnt most was that I was in love with e-commerce.""","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9911201596260071}",positive,0.9911201596260071,1

(IDEX Online News) – Luxury product group LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton announced a 19-percent increase in revenue (8-percent organic growth) for its Watches & Jewelry division in 2015. Revenue increased from €2.78 billion ($3.05 billion) in 2014 to €3.3 billion.

The results were boosted by Bulgari’s strong performance, including the launch of its Diva and Lucea collections. TAG Heuer’s new smartwatch, developed in partnership with Google and Intel performed well, while Hublot’s opening of a second manufacturing facility in Nyon, Switzerland, has strengthened its production capacity.

“The 2015 results confirm the capacity for LVMH to progress and gain market share despite economic and geopolitical uncertainty. Revenue and operating profit reached new record levels,” said Bernard Arnault, LVMH chairman and CEO.

Kanye West and Fashion Investors LVMH - HYPEBEAST,"Thu, 11 Feb 2016 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiPmh0dHBzOi8vaHlwZWJlYXN0LmNvbS8yMDE2LzIva2FueWUtd2VzdC1mYXNoaW9uLWludmVzdG9ycy1sdm1o0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Kanye receives his fair share of slack, and at times, it’s arguably deserving. However just as this documentary explains, Mr. West has been a strong advocate for all artists and the marginalization they often face from wealthy investors and industry pundits. He’s gone on record a number of times to discuss this topic, usually concluding with the question, ‘Who’s going to back me?’

In an interview with Sirius back in 2013, during his promotional tour for YEEZUS, Kanye stated, “I am Warhol. I am the number one most impactful artist of our generation. I am Shakespeare in the flesh. Walt Disney, Nike, Google — now who’s going to be the Medici family and stand up and let me create more, or do you want to marginalize me until I’m out of my moment?”

Kanye’s goals are very much apparent – dominate the fashion, music and design worlds, but we’re also aware that he’s been spending a lot of his own money to reach these mountaintops with his followers in tow. His hunt for proper investors is known, but details are not. However, Page Six has just reported that Kanye “has been reaching out to heavyweights in the fashion business to back his Yeezy clothing line to the tune of $100 million (USD).” This includes “LVMH chairman and CEO Bernard Arnault, Richemont and Chris Burch, who helped launch Tory Burch’s fashion line and later started C. Wonder.”

Page Six doesn’t mention who, if anyone, has invested in ‘Ye’s brand, but with his forthcoming events in mind, we’ll likely hear much more about it.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9998264908790588}",neutral,0.9998264908790588,0
Get to know rising (and LVMH Prize-nominated) Toronto label Vejas - fashionmagazine.com,"Mon, 22 Feb 2016 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiLWh0dHBzOi8vZmFzaGlvbm1hZ2F6aW5lLmNvbS9zdHlsZS9sdm1oLXZlamFzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Get to know rising (and LVMH Prize-nominated) Toronto label Vejas

Anyone who works in the Toronto fashion industry knows that it’s a really small scene. And one that’s fraught with challenges—specifically for local designers trying to make it internationally. So imagine my surprise when I read the list of LVMH Prize-nominated designers this morning, only to find that it included one of the rising talents of New York’s underground fashion scene, who is, incidentally, a Canadian label based out of a studio on Spadina Avenue. “New York was the closest market to us, and where we felt we could reach the biggest audience with our resources at the time,” says Saam Emme, one part of the teeny Vejas team. “We’ve never done anything in Toronto because it’s not an international player yet. The schedule is really off for the market. It doesn’t really make sense from a functional standpoint.”

Vejas, the one-year-old brainchild of 19-year-old Polish/Lithuanian/Canadian designer Vejas Kruszewski, has been bubbling to the surface alongside brands like Eckhaus Latta, Vetements and Gypsy Sport as part of the so-called genderless future of fashion. The label’s first two shows were gender-bendingly cast, featuring male, female and trans models like Hari Nef and Alexandra Marzella. But such a proposition proves a challenge for the designer, who’d rather be appreciated for his fresh take on fashion than riding the coattails of a media-fanned movement. “Shaking things up with our casting wasn’t the intention. Those are just our friends and we were representing our world,” says Emme. “A lot of brands are buying into gender nonconformity as almost a marketing strategy without anything behind it, but you can tell when it’s calculated and when the point of view is genuine.”

So what’s Vejas really about? Fashion, of course. The brand’s aesthetic is somewhere between apocalyptic casual and streetwise comfy. Standout pieces include a kimono-inspired pilot’s jacket, a heftily buckled belt/crop top and belted backpacks currently for sale on its website. “Luxury is really where we’re looking to take our products,” says Emme. “To have funding and mentorship from LVMH, a company at the forefront of luxury, would be huge.”

The prestigious prize, which includes almost half a million dollars in funding and mentorship from some of the most influential design forces in fashion, has previously been awarded to fellow Canadian Thomas Tait.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999197721481323}",neutral,0.9999197721481323,0
LVMH hits record $38bn as DFS 'contains costs' - TRBusiness,"Wed, 03 Feb 2016 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRyYnVzaW5lc3MuY29tL3JlZ2lvbmFsLW5ld3MvaW50ZXJuYXRpb25hbC9sdm1oLWhpdHMtcmVjb3JkLTM4Ym4tYXMtZGZzLWNvbnRhaW5zLWNvc3RzLzEwMDkwONIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton has reported record total revenues of €35.7bn ($38.9bn) for 2015 (+16%) declaring ‘reported increases’ at all five divisions – which all contributed to profits last year, although ‘significant cost containment’ has continued at DFS.

Interestingly, LVMH says one of its priorities for DFS this year (2016) is ‘to open new destinations’ – especially in Europe – pointing to a ‘complex situation in Asia penalizing profitability’, although contrasting with a ‘good performance in Japan’ (primarily at its Okinawa Galleria-Ed].

LVMH also said that DFS continued to benefit from high spending Chinese tourists last year, while 2016 will also see deployment of its new T Galleria Beauty concept and greater momentum with its reinforced loyalty programme known as LoyalT.

RESULTS FROM THE FIVE DIVISIONS:

More broadly, LVMH also reports that its five key divisions in order of sales contributions last year were as follows: Fashion & Leather Goods +14% to €12,369bn ($13,503bn); Selective retailing (Sephora/DFS etc.) +18% to €11,233bn ($12,262bn); Wines & Spirits +16% to €4,603bn ($5,025bn); Perfumes & Cosmetics +15% to €4,517bn ($4,931bn); and Watches & Jewelry +18% to €3,308bn ($3,611bn).

LVMH reports that the group’s divisions performed with ’strong momentum in Europe, the United States and Japan’, although ‘other Asian countries demonstrate contrasting tendencies’, with the fourth quarter achieving a reported revenue increase of 12% which also r=translated into +5% organic growth.

The world’s leading luxurygoods company added that profits from recurring operations reached €6,605m ($7,208m) in 2015 (+16%), ‘to which all business groups contributed’. Group share of net profit was €3,573m ($3,899m). In addition, LVMH said that ‘excluding the capital gain realized in 2014 following the distribution of Hermès shares’, the group share of net profit rose 20%.

Commenting on the results, Bernard Arnault, Chairman and CEO of LVMH, said: “The 2015 results confirm the capacity for LVMH to progress and gain market share despite economic and geopolitical uncertainty.

“Revenue and operating profit reached new record levels. Commitment to excellence, a passion for quality and our capacity to innovate underpin our growth momentum and are all values epitomised by the Fondation Louis Vuitton and its emblematic building that welcomed over one million visitors in 2015. All our Maisons demonstrated outstanding flexibility in 2015.

“By adapting their strategies to global changes and by continuing to evolve, they have shown the creativity and entrepreneurship that drive them forward. In an uncertain economic environment, we can rely on the desirability of our brands and the agility of our teams to further strengthen in 2016 our leadership in the world of high-quality products.”

Apart from record revenue and profits, LVMH said last year’s year highlights included strong progress in Europe, the US and Japan, with a positive impact from exchange rates. It also picked out the ‘good performance of Wines & Spirits in all regions’, noting ‘a progressive normalization’ of the situation in China.

Meanwhile, profits from iconic and new products at Louis Vuitton remained at ‘an exceptional level’, while fashion brands also made progress and here it pointed to Fendi, Céline, Givenchy and Kenzo in particular, plus ‘remarkable momentum’ at Christian Dior where market share increased globally.

In addition, LVMH reported ‘excellent results’ at Bvlgari and success with TAG Heuer’s refocusing strategy, while there was also ‘exceptional progress at Sephora’ which LVMH said ‘strengthened its position in all its markets – including the digital platform.

‘REMARKABLE YEAR’ FOR LOUIS VUITTON…

As mentioned, the results by division were led by Fashion & Leather Goods with organic revenue growth of 4% in 2015 and reported revenue growth of 14%. LVMH said: “Profit from recurring operations increased by 10%. Louis Vuitton had a remarkable year driven by the enthusiastic welcome of both its iconic products as well as the new models created by Nicolas Ghesquière.

“The Cruise Collection shown in Palm Springs and the exhibition at the Grand Palais in Paris retracing the history of the Maison were among the highlights for the year. Fendi recorded exceptional growth with the success of its iconic leather goods and the inauguration of Palazzo Fendi in the centre of Rome.

“Loro Piana continued to invest in its production capacity and launched an exceptional new material combining vicuña wool and baby cashmere. Celine’s growth was driven by all its product categories. Givenchy and Kenzo each had a good year. Donna Karan and Marc Jacobs continued to work on changes to their product lines.”

By contrast, the Selective Retailing division witnessed an ‘excellent performance at Sephora’, although, DFS saw its development ‘impacted by economic changes in Asia’. LVMH commented: “The Selective Retailing business group recorded organic revenue growth of 5%. On a reported basis, revenue growth was 18%. Profit from recurring operations increased by 6%.

“Sephora had an exceptional year in terms of revenue and results and continued to gain market share in all its markets. The omni-channel strategy accelerated with numerous initiatives in several countries.

‘UNCERTAIN ENVIRONMENT IN ASIA…’

“DFS continues to experience an uncertain environment in Asia, as a result of currency and geopolitical changes, while its business in Japan benefited from a boom in Chinese tourism. Significant cost containment efforts were continued at DFS.”

One of the most dynamic divisions at LVMH in recent years has been the Wines & Spirits business group, which is now bigger than the LVMH’s Perfume & Cosmetics division. Last year, Wines & Spirirts recorded an increase in organic revenue of 6% and reported sales growth of 16%, while profit from recurring operations rose by 19%.

LVMH said that Champagne experienced good growth in 2015 with ‘an excellent performance in Europe, the US and Japan’, while Hennessy demonstrated strong momentum in the US across all ranges.

In China, the second half of the year was marked by a rebound in revenue during a year dogged by continued destocking by distributors. Other spirits, Glenmorangie and Belvedere, continued a sustained growth.

Turning to Perfumes & Cosmetics, this market also recorded market share gains, while benefiting from ‘successful innovations’, which led to organic revenue growth of 7% and reported sales progress of 15%.

DIOR TURNS IN STRONG PERFOMANCE

LVMH commented: “Profit from recurring operations increased by 26%. Christian Dior accelerated its growth and increased worldwide market share. The new men’s fragrance Sauvage experienced unprecedented worldwide success.

“The vitality of its iconic perfumes J’adore and Miss Dior – together with the excellent reception of new make-up products – contributed to the Maison’s remarkable performance.

“Guerlain demonstrated profitable growth, notably driven by the progress of L’Homme Idéal and the continued success of the skincare ranges Orchidée Impériale and Abeille Royale. Benefit experienced strong growth driven by the originality of its products. Fresh and Make Up For Ever performed very well.”

Last, but not least, the Watches & Jewelry division also delivered ‘good growth’ in jewelry, but ‘cautious purchasing behaviour’ from multi-brand watch retailers.

This division recorded organic revenue growth of 8% and reported basis sales progress of 19%. Profit from recurring operations increased by 53%. LVMH commented: “Bvlgari had an excellent year driven by its iconic creations and its new Diva and Lvcea collections. Bvlgari’s stores delivered excellent performances”.

The company added: “TAG Heuer launched with enormous success its smartwatch developed in partnership with Google and Intel, while continuing to develop its core offering. Given its strong growth, Hublot strengthened its production capacity with the opening of a second manufacturing facility in Nyon, Switzerland.”

LVMH ‘CONFIDENT’ FOR 2016…

Looking forward, LVMH points to ‘confidence for 2016’, despite a climate of economic, currency and geopolitical uncertainties. The company says it is ‘well-equipped’ to continue its growth momentum across all business groups in 2016. The ultimate test of its outlook is, of course, reflected in its proposed shareholder dividends.

As such, LVMH is to propose a dividend of €3.55 per share (+11%) at the Annual Shareholders’ Meeting on April 14, 2016.

This follows the interim dividend of €1.35 per share which was paid out on December 3 of last year. The balance of €2.20 per share will be paid on April 21, 2016.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9999992847442627}",positive,0.9999992847442627,1

LVMH said today that strength in Europe, the US and Japan helped it buck an unfavourable trend which has seen luxury goods companies suffer as a result of the slowing global economy.

The company, which owns fashion houses Dior and Louis Vuitton, said recorded revenue rose by 16 per cent to €35.7bn (£27bn) in 2015. This beat analysts estimates for €35.1bn, according to Reuters.

Meanwhile, fourth quarter revenue rose 12 per cent, as the company's strength in Europe, US and Japan helped offset weakness in some Asian countries.

Growth in the luxury goods sector has suffered due to a slowdown in the global economy, led by China. Nevertheless, LVMH's broad product offering, which ranges from champagne to shoes, has helped it offset this.

Its fashion and leather division, accounting for the bulk of sales and profits, saw reported revenue rise 14 per cent.

NEW DELHI|MUMBAI: Premji Invest , an existing investor in the Fabindia, has bought exiting L Capital’s 8% stake for around Rs 360 crore. L Capital, the private equity arm of leading luxury goods conglomerate Louis Vuitton Moet Hennessy (LVMH) is exiting Fabindia Overseas with more than 100% returns in about 3 years, people with direct knowledge of the matter told ET.“The deal would value Fabindia at about Rs 4,500 crore,” a person close to the development said. L Capital had bought the 8% stake in Fabindia in 2012 from Wolfensohn Capital Partners for around Rs 150 crore, valuing the company at Rs 1,875 crore at the time. The private equity firm has more than doubled this investment in the company.ET had first reported that L Capital is looking to exit Fabindia on December 31. Premji Invest trumped a couple of other private equity investors in the race to buy the stake. According to the people close to the development, private equity players including Singapore government-owned Temasek, and PE firms Actis, Apax Partners and the Carlyle Group were also in talks for acquiring the stake.L Capital was expecting a valuation close to anywhere around $ 100 million, people close to the development said.In an email response, LVMH stated it doesn’t comment on speculation. Premji Invest declined to comment on the transaction. New Delhibased Fabindia has more than 200 stores in 79 locations. It has a customer base of 3 million, which it wants to expand to 10 million in three to four years.
