Luxury Giants LVMH and Hermès Will Close Stores in Russia Temporarily - The New York Times,"Fri, 04 Mar 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjIvMDMvMDQvYnVzaW5lc3MvbHZtaC1oZXJtZXMtcnVzc2lhLmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The French luxury giants LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton and Hermès each said Friday that they would temporarily close their stores in Russia as the crisis in Ukraine continued to escalate.

LVMH, which is estimated to have more than 120 stores in Russia, said that it would close them effective Sunday “given the current circumstances in the region,” according to a spokesperson. The spokesperson added that the company would continue to pay salary and benefits to its 3,500 employees in the country. Hermès said in a LinkedIn post that it would temporarily close its stores and pause commercial activity in Russia as of Friday evening.

“Deeply concerned by the situation in Europe at this time, it’s with regret that we have taken the decision to temporarily close our stores in Russia and pause all our commercial activities,” Hermès said in the post.

Western retailers like Ikea, H&M Group and Nike have made announcements about halting sales and temporarily closing stores in Russia in recent days and expressed their support for the people of Ukraine. Most have said that they will continue to pay their Russian employees. In addition to the escalating violence in Ukraine, retailers are responding to the broader trade disruption in Russia and the sanctions aimed at financial transactions in the country.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9589065909385681}",neutral,0.9589065909385681,0
"LVMH pledges €5 million to Ukrainian relief, following Kering brands - Vogue Business","Wed, 02 Mar 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZvZ3VlYnVzaW5lc3MuY29tL2Zhc2hpb24vbHZtaC1wbGVkZ2VzLTUtbWlsbGlvbi1ldXJvcy10by11a3JhaW5pYW4tcmVsaWVmLWZvbGxvd2luZy1rZXJpbmctYnJhbmRz0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"To receive the Vogue Business newsletter, sign up here.

LVMH Group has spoken out on the war in Ukraine. On Wednesday evening, the luxury group shared a statement of support for those affected by the war and announced that it would donate €5 million (about $5.5 million) to the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) to help the direct and indirect victims of the war.

The company is also launching a fundraising campaign in support of the ICRC to facilitate the contributions of its employees across the group and its 76 maisons.

“The LVMH Group is closely monitoring the tragic situation in Ukraine and stands alongside all those severely affected by this war. The group’s first concern is the safety of its 150 employees in Ukraine and is providing them with essential financial and operational assistance,” according to a statement from LVMH. The company did not specify whether it was still delivering goods to Russia. Brands including Burberry and Canada Goose, as well as retailers such as Farfetch and Mytheresa, have frozen all trade with the country.

Since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine last Thursday – during Milan Fashion Week, which continued on – leading luxury brands had been quiet. That began to change this week. Earlier, luxury brands including Burberry, Kering-owned Gucci and Balenciaga, and Marni and Diesel-owner OTB Group have sent statements of support and announced fundraising. Paris Fashion Week is now underway, following a call from Fédération de la Haute Couture et de la Mode president Ralph Toledano for attendees to experience the shows with “solemnity”.

LVMH’s crisis committee will continue to track the situation and adapt its measures as needed, the company said, pointing to its internal Heart Fund, which was launched last year to provide financial and psychological support to employees.

Real-life 'Succession': LVMH's billionaire owner Bernard Arnault extends his tenure as CEO with his 5 kids in the ... - Fortune,"Wed, 16 Mar 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vZm9ydHVuZS5jb20vZXVyb3BlLzIwMjIvMDMvMTYvc3VjY2Vzc2lvbi1sdm1oLWJpbGxpb25haXJlLW93bmVyLWJlcm5hcmQtYXJuYXVsdC1leHRlbmRzLWNlby10ZW51cmUtNS1raWRzLWluLXJ1bm5pbmcv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LVMH chief executive and world’s third-richest man Bernard Arnault is changing the rules at his company so he can stay at the helm for a little bit longer.

In a regulatory filing, LVMH said it would seek to raise the age limit for its chief executive officer from 75 to 80 at its next annual general meeting. Arnault, who just celebrated his 73rd birthday this month, has run the company for almost four decades.

Extending his tenure gives Arnault more time to decide on his succession plan, and many analysts predict one of his five children will take over—possibly setting up a family competition akin to HBO’s Succession.

All of Arnault’s children work at LVMH. The eldest, Delphine Arnault, 46, who is widely regarded as the strongest takeover candidate, is executive vice president for Louis Vuitton and the only Arnault child sitting on the company’s executive team.

But Delphine’s siblings are also contenders. Antoine, 44, is head of communication and image at LVMH; Alexandre, 29, works as executive vice president at LVMH’s recently acquired Tiffany; Frédéric, 27, is chief executive of TAG Heuer; and the youngest, Jean, 23, acts as director of marketing and development for Louis Vuitton watches.

Arnault also has a number of colleagues on his executive team who may be in the running. Antonio Belloni, a group managing director responsible for the strategic and operational management of LVMH’s companies, Michael Burke, CEO of Bulgari and Louis Vuitton, and Nicolas Bazire, managing director of Groupe Arnault in charge of development and acquisitions, have all been with LVMH for longer than two decades and could warrant serious consideration.

What the analysts say

“This seems to signal that Bernard Arnault is planning to stay longer at the helm of the group—overall a positive for LVMH, as successor candidates would have more time to mature and gain experience and gravitas,” said Luca Solca, senior research analyst in the global luxury goods group at Bernstein.

When asked if one of Arnault’s kids is positioned to take over, Solca told Fortune, “Yes, I believe this is likely to be the case.”

The proposed change in age limit shows that Arnault is “giving himself a longer time horizon to decide” on his succession plans, Philippe Pele-Clamour, an adjunct professor at business school HEC Paris, told Bloomberg.

The Arnault story

Bernard Arnault, who was born to a wealthy family in Lille, first joined the luxury business by acquiring the bankrupt company Agache-Willot-Boussac—a textile and retail conglomerate that owned Christian Dior—from the French government in 1984.

After acquiring the troubled company, Arnault laid off 9,000 workers in two years, a move that earned him the nickname “The Terminator.” He stripped the company of nearly all of its assets, keeping only the Christian Dior brand and the French luxury department store Le Bon Marché, and by 1987 returned the company to profitability.

Then Arnault began expanding. In July 1988, Arnault invested $1.5 billion in a holding company, formed along with Irish drink company Guinness, to purchase a 25% stake in the Louis Vuitton group, which had merged with Moët Hennessy in 1987. Rumors circulated that LVMH would form a “blocking minority” against Arnault, so Arnault spent $600 million more to buy another 13.5% of the group, making him its largest shareholder. More nicknames followed him, including the “Wolf in Cashmere” and the “Machiavelli of Finance.”

After Arnault took control, more acquisitions ensued. Between 1989 and 2001, LVMH acquired Céline, Berluti, Kenzo, Guerlain, Loewe, Marc Jacobs, Sephora, Thomas Pink, Emilio Pucci, Fendi, DKNY, and others.

After the acquisitions, Arnault put key figures into creative director positions to revitalize the brands. He hired Marc Jacobs as creative director of Louis Vuitton in 1997, and installed John Galliano as head of Givenchy in 1995 and then Dior in 1996. He also named the recently deceased Virgil Abloh as artistic director of Louis Vuitton in 2018.

The acquisitions have continued to the present day. LVMH recently acquired jewelry maker Tiffany, and rumors circulate that Arnault is looking into buying Ralph Lauren.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9993298053741455}",neutral,0.9993298053741455,0
Fashion and Blockchain: How Louis Vuitton and friends are digitising your threads - Euronews,"Mon, 07 Mar 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmV1cm9uZXdzLmNvbS9jdWx0dXJlLzIwMjIvMDIvMTkvZmFzaGlvbi1hbmQtYmxvY2tjaGFpbi1ob3ctbG91aXMtdnVpdHRvbi1hbmQtZnJpZW5kcy1hcmUtZGlnaXRpc2luZy15b3VyLXRocmVhZHPSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"By Olivia Pinnock

Blockchain might feel like just another new buzzword in fashion but what is arguably more interesting than the technology itself, is the culture shift it represents in companies wanting to be more transparent.

The labels in our clothes, like so many other things in our lives, are going digital. In doing so, brands are also hoping the information shared on them will be more trustworthy by encrypting it with blockchain. Fashion is exploring new ways with the data-storing technology behind NFTs and cryptocurrencies to tackle counterfeit goods and be more transparent on their social and environmental efforts.

The next time you’re out shopping, instead of a silky tag that fades in the wash and gives a vague steer on the country of production, you might come across a small badge with a chip inside which you can scan with your phone to access a unique database for that item. This database, which enables multiple parties to add (but not remove) information, could verify the product’s authenticity, tell the story of how it was made, include details of aftercare services available and track if the product is resold or passed on to a new owner.

The use of this tool in the fashion sector is gathering pace.

“If you were to talk to fashion people five years ago, the idea of blockchain was something that was really hard to get their head around. It was very much attached to the financial industry,” says fashion technology consultant Muchaneta Kapfunde. “People need to see case studies and brands showing how it can be used but when one person does that, the rest follow.”

Aura, a blockchain consortium launched last year, has signed up leading names including Prada, Louis Vuitton, OTB and Cartier. It has now created more than 15 million digital tokens that connect luxury products to a data portal.

Daniela Ott, general secretary of Aura, says: “It’s giving more power to the consumer. They can know exactly where every product is coming from, giving them the certificate of ownership, a certificate of authenticity and helping them enter into resale more easily.”

The luxury resale market is expected to grow by 10 to 15% in the next decade according to consulting firm McKinsey. Authenticating secondhand items remains a challenge for resellers, as well as consumers who want to be sure they’re buying the real deal. However, one scan of a chip could now offer a more comprehensive, verified insight into what you’re selling or buying.

While fashion brands are a trustworthy source on authenticating product, their honesty and transparency surrounding the conditions within their supply chain has not, historically, been good.

Having multiple contributors is a key component of its credibility. Currently, supply chain information is communicated solely by the brand. Blockchain services enable suppliers to be a part of this communication too and some involve third-party verification of the information.

Kapfunde explains: “At the moment, how we operate is we always have one person who has all the information and then there’s several other people giving that one person information. They control the information, so how do you know that one person is telling the truth? If we’re living in a society where everybody has the information and if one person changes their information, everyone is aware of it, it makes it a much more open society.”

Blockchain as storyteller

Designer Martina Spetlova has been using blockchain service provider Provenance to share the sustainability credentials behind her woven leather jackets and bags with her customers since 2018.

“I use the blockchain to tell the stories behind the brand, to showcase the suppliers, and one of the most important things is that the client taps into the verification,” Spetlova says. “If I have a new supplier, or want to make new claims through the platform, I have to contact [Provenance] and I send them evidence.”

Data storage and energy concerns

While blockchain can be a useful in proving sustainability credentials, it has environmental implications itself.

“I have some double thoughts about blockchain,” admits Spetlova. “I’m aware of the energy usage. It's something I'm always thinking about.”

Data stored via blockchain consumes more energy than data stored on websites and has been a hot topic in criticising the technology. While designers like Spetlova are only storing a small amount of data with blockchain, if larger brands begin to use the data in more and more products, it could significantly add to the footprint of the industry.

Aura says it is addressing this by running its platform on renewable energy and has a goal to be carbon neutral by 2025.

Blockchain rejected

Knitwear label Sheep Inc. includes scannable chips with its products to share the story of its supply chain, including linking owners to their very own sheep which they’ll receive updates about. The brand originally planned to use blockchain to do this, but changed its mind.

Scannable chip Sheep Inc

Michael Wessely, co-founder of Sheep Inc, explains: “We moved away from blockchain relatively quickly for the simple reason that blockchain is a huge environmental issue, it takes a lot of computer power to run them. We believe blockchain makes sense only if you have a very concrete use case.”

The company is currently building a carbon accounting platform on blockchain for themselves and other brands to be able to track the carbon emissions at each step of the supply chain and be able to compare it to other businesses on the platform.

“We want to make sure that any data that is spun onto the platform is not being able to be falsified, it’s immutable, it’s decentralised: all the great things that the blockchain solution enables us to do,” says Wessely.

Blockchain might feel like just another new buzzword in fashion but what is arguably more interesting than the technology itself, is the culture shift it represents in companies wanting to be more transparent.

“Brands offering up information about their behaviour is a very good thing no matter what the technology. That is absolutely the first step in the right direction,” says Wessely.

Ott adds that fashion and luxury brands are also working together much more than in the past: “[With Aura] you have competitors collaborating for the greater good, which is quite new. It's about working together on a day-to-day basis to share technological solutions.”

Kapfunde is confident that blockchain is here to stay, but says that honest communication from fashion brands is the real trend.

“Transparency is going to be something that is not only demanded by consumers, but it’s going to become the norm. The old way of being a fashion business is rapidly changing thanks to various technologies, one of them being blockchain.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9996919631958008}",neutral,0.9996919631958008,0
Meet the Eight Finalists of the 2022 LVMH Prize for Young Designers - WWD,"Thu, 24 Mar 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vd3dkLmNvbS9mYXNoaW9uLW5ld3MvZmFzaGlvbi1mZWF0dXJlcy93aG8tYXJlLXRoZS1maW5hbGlzdHMtb2YtdGhlLTIwMjItbHZtaC1wcml6ZS1mb3IteW91bmctZGVzaWduZXJzLTEyMzUxNDA3OTQv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS — The LVMH Prize for Young Designers on Thursday unveiled the eight finalists for this year’s award, lauding the designers for their inventiveness, celebration of craftsmanship and commitment to eco responsibility.

While a diverse bunch in terms of nationality, most of finalists are based in Europe and the U.S., with three working out of North America, two out of the U.K., one in Ireland, one in Japan and one in Nigeria.

The collections are split roughly equally between menswear, womenswear and genderless, while the aesthetics range from the familiar to the otherworldly.

The U.S.-based contingent consists of Ashlyn by Ashlynn Park; ERL by Eli Russell Linnetz and Winnie New York by Idris Balogun. They are joined by London-based labels Knwls, cofounded by British designer Charlotte Knowles and Canadian designer Alexandre Arsenault, and S.S. Daley by Steven Stokey-Daley.

Rounding out the group are Dublin-based designer Róisín Pierce; Japanese brand Ryunosukeokazaki by Ryunosuke Okazaki, and Tokyo James by Iniye Tokyo James, which is established in Lagos.

The eight finalists are vying for a grand prize of 300,000 euros, plus a year of coaching from experts at LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, parent of brands including Louis Vuitton, Dior, Fendi, Givenchy, Loewe and Kenzo.

The Karl Lagerfeld Prize comes with 150,000 euros and a year of mentoring, while three students graduating in 2022 are to be awarded 10,000 euros each and a one-year placement in the design studio of an LVMH brand.

“The semifinals highlighted the mature artistic approach of the candidates. These designers consider their brand from a global perspective: sourcing, production, marketing, image,” said Delphine Arnault, the force behind the initiative and a key talent scout at family-controlled luxury conglomerate LVMH.

“I was impressed, naturally, by their creative skill, but also by their awareness of the challenges of our industry and our world. Furthermore, I was delighted to meet them in person, as the showroom had been canceled last year because of the pandemic,” she added.

“I especially enjoyed interacting with each one and I was won over by their inventiveness, their way of celebrating know-how and crafts, as well as their approach to environmental issues,” Arnault remarked.

For the second year running, members of the public were able to choose their favorite designer from among the 19 semifinalists via the prize’s digital platform, with more than 62,000 people casting their vote. Interest was stoked by the presence of “Squid Games” star HoYeon Jung.

“HoYeon, as a supermodel and an actress, is very familiar with the creative process. She is beautiful, talented and determined, and she approaches her career very smartly. She was the obvious choice as ambassador of this semifinal, placing the spotlight on the talented candidates,” Arnault said.

The LVMH Prize is open to designers under age 40 who have presented and sold at least two collections of women’s, men’s or genderless ready-to-wear.

It has previously been awarded to Nensi Dojaka, who won the 2021 edition; Thebe Magugu; Doublet; Marine Serre; Grace Wales Bonner; Marques’ Almeida, and Thomas Tait. It has also boosted the careers of its runner-up special-prize winners, which include Rokh, Jacquemus and Hood by Air.

A jury made up of LVMH’s famous creative directors will ultimately select the victors ahead of a prize ceremony later this year.

South Korean-born womenswear designer Ashlynn Park cut her teeth working as a patternmaker and designer for the likes of Yohji Yamamoto, Alexander Wang and Raf Simons at Calvin Klein, before launching her own womenswear label Ashlyn in 2019 as a selection of made-to-order pieces.

A graduate of Tokyo’s Bunka Fashion College, she melds the conceptual skills she learned in Japan with the pragmatic approach more typical of U.S designers. From button-down shirts to red-carpet gowns, her intricately draped, tailored and sculptural styles are designed with an eye to zero waste.

Since officially presenting her first collection in 2021, she has refined brand signatures such as cutouts, curving seams, back details and detachable bustles — which she calls “bum rolls” — made of scrap fabric.

ERL

Eli Russell Linnetz is more than just a fashion designer: the multihyphenate directs music videos, designs concert stages, shoots editorials and campaigns, and has the likes of Grimes and Kanye West on speed dial.

Based in Venice Beach, his ERL line for men, women and children, shown under the umbrella of Dover Street Market Paris, offers twisted takes on vintage Americana. “Everything is surf, ski and skate. California is the only place where you can do all three in a day, so everything has that in the DNA,” he told WWD.

His fashion designs blend seamlessly into his storytelling practice. Witness A$AP Rocky’s outfit for last year’s Met Gala: a custom tuxedo topped with a patchwork cape that combined a quilt found at a thrift store with Linnetz’s personal mementoes, like a fragment of his dad’s bathrobe.

Knwls

Founded by Charlotte Knowles and Alexandre Arsenault after they graduated from Central Saint Martins in 2017, the Charlotte Knowles label shot to fame for its lingerie-inspired pieces and flair for all things ’90s — catching the eye of every Hadid, Kardashian and Instagram girl looking to make a statement.

The label emerged from the coronavirus pandemic ready for a rebrand, changing its name to Knwls last year. In addition to its signature corset tops and body-framing printed leggings and matching tops, the brand unveiled collaborations with Marco Panconesi for jewelry and Andy Wolf for eyewear.

“With the rise of social media, confidence has shifted back into sexiness for a lot of women. Also, the idea of a strong, dangerous woman appeals to a lot of girls these days. As a Knwls wearer myself, I definitely feel more ‘in control’ and confident when I am wearing a full look,” Knowles explained.

Roisin Pierce

Róisín Pierce is no stranger to prizes. At the Hyères International Festival of Fashion and Photography in 2019, the Irish designer won not only the inaugural Métiers d’Arts Prize in partnership with Chanel, but also the public’s vote for her collection.

Having graduated in textile design from the National College of Art and Design in Dublin, Pierce uses ruching techniques inspired by local craftsmanship to make her zero-waste garments, which are produced in Ireland and available exclusively in white, in a nod to Irish women’s history.

“I’m on the search for newness and freshness through letting the fabric manipulation guide me,” she told WWD. “It really is about a love for the craft, and a revival of the craft and pushing it through to get a new end product.”

Ryunosukeokazaki

Ryunosuke Okazaki made a splash with his inaugural show at Tokyo Fashion Week last September, which featured fantastical dresses reminiscent of colorful insects. “He brought drama and the avant-garde at a time when most brands are focusing on comfort and practicality, neither of which were aspects he seemed particularly concerned with,” WWD wrote.

Okazaki, who was born in Hiroshima and graduated from Tokyo University of the Arts in 2021, does not sketch his creations. Rather, he relies on spiritual guidance to help him shape his sculptural 3D designs made of cotton or polyester knit, he said in his filmed presentation on the LVMH Prize site.

“The theme of my expression is harmony between human and nature and prayer,” he explained. “I don’t imagine the completion of the work, but just pray for it. And sometimes I find a form that I never imagined. I just keep moving my hands. The moment I exceed my imagination, I am very happy.”

S.S. Daley

A self-described working-class boy from Liverpool, Steven Stokey-Daley has captured hearts and minds with his theatrical shows at London Fashion Week that view the British class system through a queer lens, contrasting the feminine nature of elite boys’ school attire with the toxic masculinity they represent.

His first collections were inspired by watching the students at the neighboring Harrow school while studying for his BA in fashion design at the University of Westminster. Soon after, Harry Styles wore his graduate collection in his “Golden” music video, propelling the designer to instant fame.

Signature looks are inspired by the screen adaptations of literary classics like “Brideshead Revisited” and “Maurice” — think wide-legged trousers, argyle-knit wool vests and embroidered shirts made with U.K.-manufactured or deadstock fabrics, accessorized with straw boaters decorated with sprays of wild flowers.

Tokyo James

A former stylist and editor, Nigerian British designer Iniye Tokyo James launched his line in 2015, challenging stereotypes associated with African fashion through edgy tailoring with a London rebel spirit, which has made fans of music stars such as Burna Boy, Naira Marley and Ghetts.

“As a brand, I’m really interested in humanity,” he said ahead of his first physical runway show at Milan Fashion Week in February. “We celebrate too many of our differences, which is not important. We need to look at what brings us together.”

His Lagos-based label blends traditional British tailoring with playful prints and daring embellishments. In a nod to the universal appeal of sportswear, his fall collection featured a partnership with Nike that involved upcycling materials such as high-top uppers, used as patches on a leather biker jacket.

Winnie New York

Nigerian-born, London-raised designer Idris Balogun began his career as a tailoring apprentice at Hardy Amies on London’s Savile Row. After studying at the Fashion Institute of Technology, he held senior menswear posts at Burberry and Tom Ford, before launching his label in New York City in 2018.

He describes his own aesthetic as taking Savile Row suiting to a casual and humble sort of place. Named after his late grandmother, Princess Winifred Dademu, Winnie New York blends classic pieces with edgier creations inspired by the work of artists — most made of deadstock or upcycled fabrics.

For his first official showing on the Paris men’s week calendar in January, the designer staged a presentation where clothes were hanging on raw wood sculptures or draped on cardboard cutouts. “It’s a bit taking the person out of it and appreciating the value of things,” he explained.

Each and every year since 2014, the luxury conglomerate LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton has scouted the best of up-and-comers with the help of a jury that reads like a who’s who of fashion: this year’s members include designers such as Marc Jacobs, Stella McCartney, Kim Jones, Jonathan Anderson, and Maria Grazia Chiuri; critics Tim Blanks and Suzy Menkes; editors Carine Roitfeld and Edward Enninful; and models Karlie Kloss and Bella Hadid. Get to know the eight names they have their eyes on this year, here.

ERL

Designer: Eli Russell Linnetz

Location: United States

Fans: Kim Kardashian, A$AP Rocky, and Lady Gaga

At just 26, Linnetz has done it all: He’s designed sets for Lady Gaga, shot family Polaroids for Kim Kardashian, written songs for Teyana Taylor, directed two music videos for Kanye West... and voiced a character in The Emperor’s New Groove. He created ERL at the suggestion of Adrian Joffe. You’ve no doubt seen at least one of Linnetz’s designs: ERL was behind the viral quilt A$AP Rocky wore to the 2021 Met Gala.

Róisín Pierce

Designer: Róisín Pierce

Location: Ireland

Fans: Natacha Ramsay-Levi (formerly of Chloé) and Chanel.

You know you’re on the right track when your very first collection takes home Chanel’s Métiers d’Art award. Since getting the house’s endorsement in 2019, Pierce has become known for her all-white, multilayered designs that often tie back to her Irish roots. (The aforementioned inaugural collection nodded to the women and children held captive at the infamous Magdalene Laundries from the 18th to late 20th centuries. Through zero-waste construction and deadstock upcycling, Pierce also remains committed to sustainability.

Ryunosukeokazi

Designer: Ryunosuke Okazaki

Location: Tokyo, Japan

Fans: Kiko Mihuzara and Naomi Watanabe.

Born in Hiroshima, Japan in 1995, Okazaki graduated from the Tokyo University of Arts just last year. It only takes one look at his designs to recognize his intricate, avant-garde style. Modern as it looks, he’s actually inspired by Japan’s Jōmon period, which dates back to 4,000 BCE.

KNWLS

Designers: Charlotte Knowles and Alexandre Arsenault

Location: London, England

Fans: Kendall Jenner, Bella Hadid, and Julia Fox.

It’s something of a shock that Knowles and Arsenault haven’t already won the LVMH Prize. KNWLS has become a staple for the Hadids and Jenners for years now, and is also fittingly favored by Beyoncé Knowles (though, no relation). The designers have a knack for reworking lingerie and exploring conventional notions of femininity.

S. S.Daley

Designer: Steven Stokey-Daley

Location: London, United Kingdom

Fans: Anna Wintour and Harry Styles.

The name Harry Styles—who recently tapped Stokey-Daley to outfit Mick Fleetwood for his beauty line Pleasing—says it all. The menswear designer is a newcomer to London Fashion Week, but his runway shows that literally double as theater have made him one of the most exciting names on the scene.

Tokyo James

Designer: Iniye Tokyo James

Location: Lagos, Nigeria

Fans: Burna Boy and Dover Street Market.

It’s no small endorsement for the crew behind London Fashion Week to characterize a label as “at the forefront of a new generation of fashion talent emerging from the content of Africa.” The British-Nigerian designer most recently showcased his expert tailoring at Milan Fashion Week, where he combined sneakers and soccer cleats from his partnership with Nike with fabrics found in deadstock markets in Nigeria.

Winnie New York

Designer: Idris Balogun

Location: United States

Fans: Christopher Bailey and Tom Ford.

Thanks to boldly lying about his age, Balogun learned from the best of the best at London’s Savile Row when he was just 14. It’s no surprise that the Nigerian-born, British-raised designer—who went on to have stints working at Tom Ford and Burberry—places high value in quality; his designs, which are often inspired by the Black disaspora, are constructed to stand the test of time.

An LVMH-Ralph Lauren Acquisition Deal Is Reportedly Unlikely - HYPEBEAST,"Tue, 01 Mar 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vaHlwZWJlYXN0LmNvbS8yMDIyLzMvbHZtaC1yYWxwaC1sYXVyZW4tYWNxdWlzaXRpb24tZGVhbC1yZXBvcnRlZGx5LXVubGlrZWx50gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Just last week, reports indicated that LVMH is currently in talks to acquire Ralph Lauren. While it is not an surprising endeavour for the French luxury house, which recently purchased American jewelry brand Tiffany & Co, additional sources are saying that it is an unlikely deal.

While the story generated ample conversation amongst the fashion world, BOF has noted that fundamentally, Ralph Lauren operates under a different branch of fashion business than LVMH. The publication also indicates that “the company’s 82-year-old executive chairman and chief creative officer, has never communicated a clear succession plan, nor has he ever communicated any interest in selling.” The majority of Ralph Lauren’s products are within the mid-range price point, different from the high-end luxury that LVMH is known for. In comparison, Ralph Lauren’s profit margins are expected to be much lower than that of the French conglomerates’.

Despite Ralph Lauren’s strong reputation as a key American-born brand, the label’s formalwear and suiting and leather luxury goods are not considered in the same regard as those from Louis Vuitton, Dior, Gucci or Saint Laurent. The brand hinges on the positioning that it is a more affordable brand in comparison. This is not the first time Ralph Lauren has found itself in speculative rumors regarding an acquisition deal. LVMH’s rival Kering was also rumored to look into purchasing the company.

So far, LVMH and Ralph Lauren have declined to comment.

LVMH Prize Showroom Returns to Physical Event With Craftsmanship Focus - WWD,"Sun, 06 Mar 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihAFodHRwczovL3d3ZC5jb20vZmFzaGlvbi1uZXdzL2Zhc2hpb24tZmVhdHVyZXMvbHZtaC1wcml6ZS1zaG93cm9vbS1zZW1pZmluYWxpc3RzLWhpZ2hsaWdodC1jcmFmdHNtYW5zaGlwLWxvY2FsLXByb2R1Y3Rpb24tMTIzNTEyNDc1OC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS — The LVMH Prize showroom returned to Paris Fashion Week for its first physical edition since the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic, bringing back the enjoyment of physically touching and feeling clothes in a season with a heightened focus on craftsmanship and local production.

“Seeing the products is essential. It’s very difficult on Zoom to see the volume and the colors of a handbag or clothes, and so it’s great to be able to all meet in person today,” said Delphine Arnault, the force behind the initiative and a key talent scout at family-controlled luxury conglomerate LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton. “It’s always refreshing to feel all this optimism and can-do spirit.”

The 19 finalists gathered at LVMH headquarters on Avenue Montaigne to show their collections to industry experts during the two-day event, which ran from March 4 to 5. Trinidadian-British designer Maximilian Davis withdrew for personal reasons. Members of the public were able to vote online for their favorite designer, in order to help select the eight finalists.

Organizers said in light of the war in Ukraine, the prize would support its three former semifinalists from the country: Anna October, Julie Paskal and Anton Belinskiy. October used the prize’s platform to let buyers know she was showing at the Paper Mache Tiger showroom in Paris until Friday.

“Somehow I made it from Kyiv to Paris to present my work,” she said. “Business is very important for us at the moment because it’s the way to support the team, to support the country.”

In an update earlier in the week, Ukrainian Central Saint Martins graduate Olya Kuryshchuk said Belinskiy joined as a volunteer for the city guards in Kyiv to fight the Russian army, while Paskal was sheltering in a basement with two small children.

This year’s contestants, chosen from among 1,900 applicants, were from the U.S., Sri Lanka, South Korea, France, China, the United Kingdom, Belgium, Italy, Spain, Ireland and Japan.

“It’s highly selective, and just being here today is already a huge win for the designers. It allows them to meet industry experts ranging from editors to makeup artists, photographers, models, stylists and department store buyers. Even if they don’t win, these are people that can further their career and boost their notoriety,” said Arnault.

While the mood at the showroom was slightly more subdued than before the pandemic, a lightning visit by LVMH chairman and chief executive officer Bernard Arnault set hearts aflutter.

“He’s only the most powerful man in fashion, and almost the entire world, full stop. So it was a little stressful, but it’s pretty incredible,” said French designer Victor Weinsanto, who was enjoying the return to IRL events.

“It changes everything. People can put a face to a name. It depends on your personality, but I’m quite shy and embarrassed, but very, very polite. I think it makes people feel well-disposed toward you. I’ve definitely noticed that when I meet buyers in the showroom in person, they buy much more than when it’s just via Zoom or line sheet,” he said.

“The LVMH Prize is an amazing platform that allows you to meet so many people, that when it’s only digital, it’s a little frustrating,” he added.

Weinsanto was showing a collection made with fabrics pulled largely from Nona Source, LVMH’s platform offering deadstock fabrics and leathers from its fashion houses. Carried by 20 retailers, including Nordstrom, Selfridges and H. Lorenzo, his label received a huge boost from dressing actress Philippine Leroy-Beaulieu, aka Sylvie Grateau, in season two of “Emily in Paris.”

Sales of her fitted knit dress have accounted for 15 percent of total turnover on Weinsanto’s e-commerce platform since its launch, and Leroy-Beaulieu made a guest appearance in his fall runway show.

Airei designer Drew Curry, meanwhile, showed his wares to visitors including Anna Wintour, global editorial director of Vogue. “It’s actually been, I would say, the perfect amount of people. It’s not slow and awkward, but it’s not jam-packed. We’ve been able to talk to everybody, but it’s been like a constant flow, which is really great,” he reported.

The Los Angeles-based designer works with fabrics like khadi cotton, which is hand-loomed in India. “The priority of the brand is to highlight the human touch, and so everything has like a hand-knitted or hand-stitched element to it that we do in Los Angeles,” he said.

“I’m making things that hopefully people will want to keep for a lifetime and the quality is definitely there. I spend a lot of time researching these fabrics,” Curry added.

Airei has six retail partners for spring, including Dover Street Market and Ssense, and will grow to 15 for the fall season. “I don’t want this to blow up right away. I’m in it for the longevity and because of the handwork, too, I want to make sure the most amount of effort and time is going into the pieces,” the designer said.

Amesh Wijesekera, meanwhile, is working with artists and communities in Sri Lanka to produce his seasonless, genderless wardrobe, working with recycled yarns and fabrics salvaged from the country’s garment industry, which produces clothes for leading brands such as Tommy Hilfiger, Ann Taylor and Victoria’s Secret.

“It’s giving craft kind of an elevated luxe feel and taking it out of the country, because in Sri Lanka, the way we use craft is very typical, so it’s how do we evolve it and move it forward?” he said. “We have the craft sector, we have the textile, so it’s about how we bring these elements together as everything is on our doorstep, but I think nobody has really appreciated that.”

The designer, who is based between London, Berlin and Colombo, is the first Sri Lankan to make it to the semifinals of the award. “Being here physically, where people can touch and feel the clothes and get the emotional side of things, I think it’s so important, especially for a brand like mine,” he said.

That’s also true for Irish designer Róisín Pierce, who works only in white, using ruching techniques inspired by local craftsmanship to make her zero-waste garments, which are produced in Ireland. The collection is available exclusively in three Nordstrom Space locations.

“My approach is quite maybe unique, in that I don’t actually sketch or have a finished product in mind, but more that I’m on the search for newness and freshness through letting the fabric manipulation guide me,” she continued. “It really is about a love for the craft, and a revival of the craft and pushing it through to get a new end product.”

Faced with a dearth of craftspeople, she has started an initiative to teach Irish crochet to young people to prevent the skill dying off. “My collections today have almost launched all digitally, except for the ones that year where there were showrooms, but it really gets a different reaction when you can see, and almost sense them and touch them,” she said.

Likewise, Shanghai-based designer Chen Peng produces his collection, which is pronounced like Champagne, exclusively in China. He specializes in down material, which he used to make everything from oversized coats to ski-style pants. Peng, who last year collaborated with Moncler on a capsule collection using recycled jackets, is pushing to make the industry more environmentally conscious.

Though he’s equally comfortable making physical outfits and NFTs, he prefers to have meetings in-person. “It’s much better because visitors can feel the designers’ ideas, the concept, in a physical way. They can touch the fabric, they can touch the clothes, they can feel what you are thinking about in a deep way. An online showcase is more like a catalogue,” he said.

Unlike most of the designers in attendance, Eli Russell Linnetz is happy to let clothes take a backseat. Having studied screenwriting at film school, the Los Angeles-based designer is all about storytelling.

“Of course, the clothes matter, but that’s just about having a really good production partner. But for me, if you don’t have a good story to tell, it’s like, why are people gonna care?” he asked. “I’d rather tell a story with no clothes.”

His ERL line for men, women and children is based on his home in Venice Beach. “Everything is surf, ski and skate. California is the only place where you can do all three in a day, so everything has that in the DNA,” he explained.

Linnetz got his start working alongside Virgil Abloh and Matthew Williams for musicians like Kanye West and Lady Gaga, and his new collection is also popular with performers. “A lot of celebrities have worn it just because you stand out when you wear it, so I feel like it has this pop element that people respond to,” he noted.

Still, he acknowledged that no matter how good a collection film is, it’s essential to experience the products in person. “It’s super important for people to touch the clothes and meet the people who are making them. You can only get so much over videos,” he said.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999724626541138}",neutral,0.9999724626541138,0
Is Bernard Arnault ready to stay on at LVMH until he's 80? - Vogue Business,"Wed, 16 Mar 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZvZ3VlYnVzaW5lc3MuY29tL2NvbXBhbmllcy9pcy1iZXJuYXJkLWFybmF1bHQtcmVhZHktdG8tc3RheS1vbi1hdC1sdm1oLXVudGlsLWhlcy04MNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"To receive the Vogue Business newsletter, sign up here.

Next month’s LVMH general meeting is to bring the age limit for serving as LVMH chief executive officer to 80, pending shareholders approval, according to a public filing published on 14 March.

That will increase the age limit from 75 years old, per LVMH bylaws. Shareholders will deliberate on the modified version.

Mr Arnault, who is 73, became the leading shareholder and chairman of LVMH in 1989. He is also the CEO. His five children work for the group: Delphine, 46, executive VP of Louis Vuitton, a member of the LVMH board of directors and on the executive committee; Antoine 44, LVMH’s head of image, communications and environment, CEO of Berluti and a member of the board of directors; Alexandre, 29 who heads up product and communications at Tiffany & Co; Frédéric, 27, CEO of Tag Heuer; and Jean, 23, director of marketing and development of Louis Vuitton Watches.

Read More LVMH’s Arnault is wary of the metaverse “bubble”. Should luxury be? The luxury executive is taking a wait-and-see approach to digital 3D worlds and products, he told analysts during the company’s earnings call on Thursday. We ask the experts for their views.

“I believe investors will be pleased with an extension of the mandate of Bernard in the CEO role,” says Mario Ortelli, managing director of Ortelli & Co. “He brilliantly steers the strategy of a group with a phenomenal management organisation and, over the years, has taken more and more responsibilities. Also, the younger members of the Arnault family are succeeding in their roles within the group paving the foundation for a smooth succession and the long run development of the business.”

“Bernard Arnault has proven to be a visionary and very effective leader. More time for potential successors to mature and consolidate their experience and positions is definitely not going to hurt,” says Bernstein analyst Luca Solca.

The general meeting is set for 21 April at 10.30am (CET) at the Carrousel du Louvre. It marks the return to a physical meeting after two years of pandemic restrictions.

Luxury Conglomerate LVMH Already Has a Metaverse Ambassador - WWD,"Wed, 16 Mar 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3dkLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy1uZXdzL3RlY2hub2xvZ3kvbWV0YXZlcnNlLXZpcnR1YWwtYW1iYXNzYWRvci12aXZhLXRlY2hub2xvZ3ktbHZtaC1pbm5vdmF0aW9uLWF3YXJkLTEyMzUxMzU4MjQv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS — In a sign of the growing pull of the metaverse, LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton has created a virtual ambassador to present its brand innovations at the next edition of the Viva Technology conference, scheduled to run from June 15 to 18 in Paris.

The female avatar, which has gray-blue eyes and a wavy brown bob with white streaks at the front, appeared in the luxury conglomerate’s call for applications from start-ups for the sixth edition of its LVMH Innovation Award, which received a record of more than 950 entries this year, according to a spokesman for the group.

The virtual character, which has yet to be named, will deliver statements about innovation, tech and digital-related topics for LVMH and its 75 brands during VivaTech, which is expecting more than 1,500 exhibitors for this hybrid edition, which will include a physical event at the Porte de Versailles exhibition center.

Although LVMH chairman and chief executive officer Bernard Arnault is officially taking a cautious approach to the metaverse, the world’s biggest luxury group has been exploring the possibilities of the digital environment and its adjacent innovations.

Last year, it partnered with Prada Group and Compagnie Financière Richemont in the Aura Blockchain Consortium, which promotes the use of a single blockchain solution open to all luxury brands worldwide.

And LVMH is no stranger to working with virtual characters. Louis Vuitton, the group’s star brand, enlisted the Final Fantasy character Lightning for its spring 2016 ads, and in 2019, it joined forces with Riot Games, the maker of the popular multiplayer online video game “League of Legends,” creating champion skins for players.

However, LVMH has lacked a high-profile spokesperson for digital innovation since the departure of its chief digital officer Ian Rogers in 2020. His responsibilities are now shared by several executives: chief information officer Franck Le Moal, who is in charge of IT projects like Aura, and chief omnichannel officer Michael David, whose role focuses on usage.

In January, the group appointed former Sephora executive Nelly Mensah as vice president of digital innovation — head of crypto and metaverse. She is expected to divide her time between New York City and Paris as she helps brands to explore the possibilities of virtual reality and augmented reality.

Candidates for the LVMH Innovation Award are also being asked to showcase their solutions for 3D/virtual product experience and the metaverse. It’s one of six categories they can compete in, alongside omnichannel and retail; media and brand awareness; operations and manufacturing excellence; employee experience and corporate social responsibility, and sustainability.

Shortlisted start-ups will have a chance to work with LVMH and its brands, and the winners for each category will be honored at an awards ceremony during VivaTech. A special prize will also be given to a start-up for the most compelling data and artificial intelligence solution. One of the start-ups will be named the winner of the 2022 LVMH Innovation Award.

A spokesperson from the brand confirmed that Davis is no longer taking part in this year’s competition, but declined to share further details.

WWD has reached out to LVMH for a comment.

The designer showcased his most shop-floor-ready collection to date in London last month with Fashion East. The collection was his last with Lulu Kennedy’s young designer support scheme. He offered sharp, tailored pieces inspired by equestrian and Davis’ Catholic school life, sexy little dresses, and luxurious suede trench and nappa cropped jackets.

Davis launched his namesake brand in 2020, after working as a junior designer at Grace Wales Bonner, who was the winner of the LVMH Prize in 2016. He previously worked as a freelance designer for Mowalola, Asai, and Supriya Lele. Davis holds a bachelor’s degree from the London College of Fashion.

His brand is now stocked at leading retailers like Dover Street Market, Matchesfashion, Browns, Net-a-porter, and Ssense.

Davis was supposed to join the rest of the semifinalists at the Paris showroom to meet with industry experts during Paris Fashion Week.

Many of the contenders are already runway regulars in various fashion capitals, including Bluemarble by Anthony Alvarez, Weinsanto by Victor Weinsanto, S.S. Daley by Steven Stokey Daley, and Palomo Spain by Alejandro Gòmez Palomo, who was a semifinalist in the 2017 edition of the LVMH Prize.

Also vying for this year’s honor are Airei by Drew Curry; Amesh by Amesh Wijeskera, the first Sri Lankan designer on the roster; Ashlyn by Ashlynn Park; Chenpeng by Peng Chen; ERL by Eli Russell Linnetz, one of the brands promoted by Dover Street Market Paris; Goomheo by Goom Heo; Knwls by Charlotte Knowles and Alexandre Arsenault; Meryll Rogge; Niccolò Pasqualetti; Paula Canova del Vas; Róisín Pierce; Ryunosukeokazaki by Ryunosuke Okazaki; Tokyo James by Iniye Tokyo James; Winnie New York by Idris Balogun, and Yueqi Qi.

The winner will receive a grand prize of 300,000 euros, plus a year of coaching from experts at LVMH, parent of brands, including Louis Vuitton, Dior, Fendi, Givenchy, Loewe and Kenzo.

The LVMH Prize is open to designers under the age of 40 who have presented and sold at least two collections of women’s, men’s, or genderless ready-to-wear.

It has previously been awarded to Nensi Dojaka, who won the 2021 edition; Thebe Magugu; Doublet; Marine Serre; Grace Wales Bonner; Marques’ Almeida, and Thomas Tait. It has also boosted the careers of its runner-up special-prize winners, which include Rokh, Jacquemus, and Hood by Air.

A jury made up of LVMH’s famous creative directors will ultimately select the victors ahead of a prize ceremony later this year.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999959468841553}",neutral,0.9999959468841553,0

Luxury brands are joining the rapidly growing list of retailers temporarily halting business with Russia following the country’s invasion of Ukraine.

The luxury companies join the several US and European retailers that have ceased business in the region, including Ikea, H&M Group, Adidas and Canada Goose.

Kering, which owns luxury brands including Gucci, Saint Laurent, Bottega Veneta and Balenciaga, on Friday announced in a statement on LinkedIn that it is shuttering stores in Russia “for its houses that the group operates directly in the country”.

The decision comes after the conglomerate announced on Wednesday, March 2, that it would make a “significant donation” to the United Nations Refugees Agency, writing in an Instagram post that the company hopes for a “peaceful resolution of this conflict”.

While LVMH did not immediately respond to request to comment, the company told The New York Times on Friday that it plans to close its more than 120 stores “given the current circumstances in the region”. LVMH owns several high-end brands including Louis Vuitton, Christian Dior, Fendi and Givenchy.

Like Kering, LVMH also announced it would make a first emergency donation of five million euros (the equivalent of US$5.47 million) to the International Committee of the Red Cross. The company announced the donation in an Instagram post on Thursday, March 3, and said it will also set up a fundraising campaign “in support of the ICRC to facilitate the contributions of employees across the Group and its 76 Maisons”.

“The group’s first concern is the safety of its 150 employees in Ukraine and is providing them with essential financial and operational assistance,” LVMH wrote in the post.

Both Chanel and Hermès also took to LinkedIn on Friday to announce their respective closures.

“Deeply concerned by the situation in Europe at this time, it’s with regret that we have taken the decision to temporarily close our stores in Russia and pause all our commercial activities from March the 4th evening,” Hermès wrote on its LinkedIn page. “We will continue to stand by our local team.”

Chanel announced that it will close all boutiques in Russia and has already suspended its e-commerce in the region. Photo: Reuters

Similarly, Chanel shared on LinkedIn that the decision comes amid the “increasing concerns about the situation” and “growing uncertainty to operate”.

“We will no longer deliver into Russia, we will close our boutiques, and we already suspended our e-commerce,” Chanel wrote in the post.

ERL by Eli Russel Linnetz

KNWLS by Charlottes Knowles and Alexandre Arsenault

Graduates of Central Saint Martins, the duo’s signature of mesh, layering, and the innately sexy, have emerged as staples for Bella Hadid, Kardashian-Jenners even being worn by Beyoncé last spring. The label is a social media favorite, the confidence of the printed corset tops and subversive sleeve shapes appealing to both celebrity and Instagram girl alike.

Roisin Pierce by Róisín Pierce

Winning Chanel’s Métiers d’Arts Prize in 2019, the Irish designer has not looked back, having collaborated with the maison in 2020. Focusing on upcycling and recycling, Pierce’s exploration of Irish women’s history and sustainability has led her to emerge as a public favorite.

Ryunosukeokazaki by Rynosuke Ozakazi

Graduate of the Tokyo University of the Arts, Okazaki is not shy to make a grand impression. Colorful and Kafkaesque, his avant-garde style brings back a drama that we are all excited to continue seeing.

S.S. Daley by Steven Stokey-Daley

Offering a detailed lens of a period of “what once was,” Daley’s designs are a closer look into the history of British androgyny and the lines of class. A favorite of Harry Styles, Daley recently outfitted Mick Fleetwood for Styles’ beauty brand Pleasing.

Tokyo James by Iniye Tokyo James

Founded in 2015, James is a blend of British tailoring with Nigerian edge, the Lagos-based label known for its unconventional textile choices while utilizing traditional Saville Row tailoring. A challenge to the stereotypes forced upon African fashion, James’ rebellion has amassed a fanbase that includes Burna Boy.

Winnie New York by Idris Balogun

Balogun – Nigerian-born and British-raised- worked for Burberry and Tom Ford before launching his label. Timeless with edgy twists, Winnie combines the designer’s experience in traditional tailoring (having lied about his age to get an apprenticeship at Saville Row) and his own aesthetic, focusing on authenticity and education.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999985694885254}",neutral,0.9999985694885254,0

Hermès and Richemont, the holding company behind Cartier, Dunhill, and Jaeger-Lecoultre, were the first to annouce the suspensions followed by Chanel, LVMH, and Kering (Gucci, Saint Laurent, Balenciaga, Bottega Veneta, etc.). Other global retailers joining the list include IKEA, H&M, adidas, and Canada Goose.

Sanctions placed on Russia have made it increasingly difficult for international corporations to conduct business in the country with Visa, Mastercard, and Apple Pay recently announcing suspension of services. Russians currently account for approximately $9 billion USD of yearly luxury goods spending according to a Jeffries report.

“Given our increasing concerns about the current situation, the growing uncertainty and the complexity to operate, Chanel decided to temporarily pause its business in Russia. We will no longer deliver into Russia, we will close our boutiques and we already suspended our e-commerce,” the fashion house said in a post.

“Deeply concerned by the situation in Europe at this time, it’s with regret that we have taken the decision to temporarily close our stores in Russia and pause all our commercial activities from March the 4th evening,” Hermès echoed on LinkedIn.

According to Reuters, LVMH, which will be closing 124 boutiques in Russia starting from this weekend, has pledged to continue paying the salaries of its 3,5000 employees, and Kering announced a similar commitment to its 180 employees in the country. Both conglomerates along with Richemont and L’Oreal have promised to provide financial support for Ukrainian refugees.

Reports Now Say Hyped LVMH Ralph Lauren Merger Was Always The Jig - Cassius,"Wed, 02 Mar 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiPWh0dHBzOi8vY2Fzc2l1c2xpZmUuY29tLzU2ODE4My9sdm1oLXJhbHBoLWxhdXJlbi1tZXJnZXItZmFrZS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Cassius Life Featured Video CLOSE

Late last week, there were rumors that luxury retailer Louis Vuitton Moët Hennessy (LVMH) planned to acquire Ralph Lauren, and the story ignited the fashion world with excitement. However, a new article from Business of Fashion suggests it was all bunk and points out reasons why the partnership would be improbable in the first place.

To start, the 82-year-old Ralph Lauren is still the executive chairman, chief creative officer, and majority shareholder of his eponymous brand, and he’s never given any real indication of wanting to sell the company. As a matter of fact, the company raked in $4.4 billion in the fiscal year, and sales across North America (its No.1 market) have risen more than 300% from the year before per BOF.

Another potential source of conflict stems from the fact that each company actually caters to different target sectors, although there is some overlap. LVMH focuses on the high-end market with brands like Givenchy, Christian Dior, and Kenzo, and the $360B conglomerate recently added jeweler Tiffany & Co. to its massive portfolio of luxury labels.

However, except for men’s suits, the sweet spot for Ralph Lauren is the mid-luxury market. Their goods lack the appropriate margin to be profitable to LVMH long-term, and RL doesn’t possess the type of cachet to effectively compete with other established European brands outside of America.

PVH Corp. (formerly known as the Phillips-Van Heusen Corporation) would actually be a better fit for Ralph Lauren, with its American roots and already being home to brands like Calvin Klein, Tommy Hilfiger, and Michael Kors.

For now, RL and LVMH have both declined to offer any official comment — and none of this matters if Ralph Lauren himself doesn’t want to sell the company in the first place.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9995782971382141}",neutral,0.9995782971382141,0
LVMH Prize finalists: Ready for the next level - Vogue Business,"Wed, 30 Mar 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZvZ3VlYnVzaW5lc3MuY29tL2Zhc2hpb24vbHZtaC1wcml6ZS1maW5hbGlzdHMtcmVhZHktZm9yLXRoZS1uZXh0LWxldmVs0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Eight designers have been chosen for the final list for the LVMH Prize, whittled down from a shortlist of 20. The finalists are: Ashlyn, Erl, Knwls, Róisín Pierce, Ryunosukeokazaki, SS Daley, Tokyo James and Winnie New York. Vogue Business spoke to five of them to discuss how the prize might benefit their businesses.

Emerging designers: growing pains

Finalist British-Nigerian designer Tokyo James has found it difficult to amplify his brand and its focus on Nigerian craftsmanship and manufacturing. He felt restricted by luxury’s obsession with the big four fashion cities of London, New York, Paris and Milan. With his bold, modified tailoring, James now hopes the competition will help him show the world the beauty and attention to detail of Made in Africa. Revenue was just under £500,000 for 2021, with stockists including Dover Street Market New York and H Lorenzo. “Everyone wants to be a big luxury house, even if they say they want to be small,” he says. “We want to have a very slow and steady trajectory to becoming that household name across the world that everyone loves and recognises.”

Tokyo James produces samples and small runs at an atelier in Lagos, with bigger orders outsourced to Turkey or Italy. The LVMH Prize money would enable him to build out his Nigerian manufacturing operation, creating jobs in Lagos and supporting the local economy.

Inclusion in the shortlist took some finalists by surprise. “It’s been an interesting moment,” says Winnie New York founder Idris Balogun. “I have been walking around with this idea that the brand was under the radar. Now, to be an LVMH finalist is unfathomable!”

Focused on elevated basics and cool tailoring, Winnie New York developed a close-knit cult following online during the pandemic, Balogun says. Previously, the designer worked on Savile Row and also as menswear director at Burberry and Tom Ford. Winnie New York currently has sales of under £500,000, anticipating a 50 per cent surge this year. Balogun is ready for more: “It’s time to showcase what we’ve been working on the last two years.”

Emerging designers have found the typical stresses and strains of growing their businesses complicated by everything from the pandemic to Brexit. Winnie New York took the decision to shift production from New York to Italy, then struggled to cope with European shipping issues. “When someone’s telling me about taxes or shipping laws or the effects of Brexit, I don't know what's going on!” acknowledges Balogun. “Help with things like that is really, really important,” he says, reflecting how mentorship from LVMH would be the most precious aspect of the Prize. What about the €300,000 grant? While not diminishing its importance he points out that the money can be spent quickly in the luxury world. “You can spend that on a show.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9995718598365784}",neutral,0.9995718598365784,0
DJ D-Nice Collabs With LVMH for the Second Anniversary of 'Club Quarantine' - EBONY,"Thu, 17 Mar 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiMmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVib255LmNvbS9kai1kLW5pY2UtY29sbGFicy13aXRoLWx2bWgv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"During the spring of 2020, at the start of the pandemic, Derrick “D-Nice” Jones launched ‘Club Quarantine’, a virtual DJ set streamed on Instagram live with one goal: to help uplift people’s spirits and promote love, positivity and good vibrations. As an established music legend, this initiative brought thousands of viewers together turning their living room into a dancefloor to enjoy the music and relieve some stress during such a difficult time. It also made a cultural impact and D-Nice was recognized by The White House for his efforts.

Nearly two years later, as mask mandates are lifted and people return to a sense of pre-pandemic normalcy, LVMH (Louis Vuitton Moët Hennessy) is excited to team up with D-Nice for a final three-night Club Quarantine celebration on Instagram Live. The send-off starts this evening, March 17, from 4 - 6pm PST (7 – 9pm EST) and viewers can join D-Nice on Instagram for his epic last performances. It will continue on Friday, March 18 and, Saturday, March 19, 12pm to 2pm PST (3-5pm EST).

Additionally, to commemorate Women’s History Month, Moët Hennessy will donate to Black Girl Ventures Foundation (BGV), with 100% of the donation matched by D-Nice. The non-profit organization addresses the unique challenges Black/Brown women face in accessing social and financial capital to grow their businesses.

Those tuning in to D-Nice's Instagram Live will also get the chance to catch surprise guest drop-ins from some of his closest celebrity friends. To mark the celebration, D-Nice and his crew will be sipping curated cocktails from brands like Hennessy X.O., Krug Champagne and Volcan Tequila. There will even be outfit changes from D-Nice, who will be rocking a sharp rotation of brands including Louis Vuitton, Fendi and Dior. That sounds like a proper send off to us.

In a message of thanks to his Instagram followers he said, ""Happy 2nd anniversary! We changed the world. We danced together. We cried together. We saved lives! Two years of spreading joy with music while building community. Thanks for rocking with me! Be ready to toast it up this evening.

After hosting a two-day showroom semi-final earlier this month with 19 designers (originally 20, but downsized when Maximilian Davis dropped out ahead of accepting his new role as new creative director of Salvatore Ferragamo), eight designers are competing to win the LVMH Prize and the Karl Lagerfeld Prize for Innovation later this spring.

The LVMH Prize was established in 2013 and has become known for spotlighting some of the buzziest names in fashion. Cult favorites like, Simon Porte Jacquemus of Jacquemus and Vetements co-founder and current creative director of Balenciaga, Demna Gvasalia (who now goes by Demna) are among past nominees who have since skyrocketed to become major players in fashion. Past prize winners include Peter Do, Thebe Magugu, and Grace Wales Bonner of their eponymous labels. The most recent winner was Albanian-born, London-based designer, Nensi Dojaka.

This year’s eight finalists span from many different countries around the world, with three designers, Ashlyn by Ashlynn Park, ERL by Eli Russell Linnetz, and Winnie New York by Idris Balogun from the United States. The rest of the competitors consist of British designer Charlotte Knowles of Knwls, Canadian designer Alexandre Arsenault, Irish designer Róisín Pierce, plus Ryunosukeokazaki by Ryunosuke Okazaki from Japan, S.S. Daley by Steven Stokey-Daley from the U.K., and Tokyo James by Iniye Tokyo James from Nigeria.

“The semi-final, which took place both during a showroom and online, allowed us to discover the work of the shortlisted designers,” says Delphine Arnault, the founder of the LVMH Prize and executive vice president of Louis Vuitton in a press release. “I would like to applaud their talent and their enthusiasm, and to congratulate all of them. I especially enjoyed interacting with each one and I was won over by their inventiveness, their way of celebrating know-how and crafts, as well as their approach to environmental issues.”

Ahead, meet the crop of talented individuals, who will be showing their collections at the Foundation Louis Vuitton in Paris to a jury of fashion’s biggest names, including designers Marc Jacobs, Stella McCartney, Kim Jones, Jonathan Anderson, and Maria Grazia Chiuri; critics Tim Blanks and Suzy Menkes; editors Carine Roitfeld and Edward Enninful; and models Karlie Kloss and Bella Hadid.

Ashlyn by Ashlynn Park, New York, womenswear

Ashlynn Park’s career spans two continents and over a decade of experience working for influential brands. Originally from South Korea, Park trained in Seoul before moving to Tokyo to continue her studies. Upon winning Japan’s SO-EN Award in 2008, Park was offered a role as Fashion Designer and Pattern Maker at Yohji Yamamoto. She moved to New York in 2011, working on creative teams for Alexander Wang, Raf at Calvin Klein 205W39NYC, and now is bringing her craft and unique perspective to her eponymous label, Ashlyn. Each piece celebrates femininity and timeless elegance, while the brand works to minimize waste and environmental harm. Above all, Park strives to create enduring wardrobe favorites to delight anyone who wears them.

ERL by Eli Russell Linnetz, United States, womenswear, menswear and genderless collections

Based in Venice Beach, California, Eli Russell Linnetz launched his label ERL in January 2020 with a full menswear collection capturing California’s colorful and laid-back spirit with simple, sensual takes on all-American staples. ERL has since expanded its offerings to include womenswear, suiting, accessories, and childrenswear for ages 4-14. If the label’s distinct aesthetic looks familiar, it may be because you’ve seen a look from ERL’s Fall 2021 menswear collection featured in the Metropolitan Museum of Art’s 2021 Costume Institute “In America: A Lexicon of Fashion.” And A$AP Rocky wore an upcycled ERL quilt with a custom ERL tuxedo to the 2021 Met Gala.

KNWLS by Charlotte Knowles, United Kingdom & Alexandre Arsenault, Canada, womenswear

The South London-based brand launched in 2017 by Charlotte Knowles and Alexandre Arsenault, shortly after they graduated from Central Saint Martins. Since 2017, the eponymous label, named after one of its founders, has been worn by everyone from The Crown’s Emma Corrin to Beyoncé, Dua Lipa, and Bella Hadid. In April, the brand underwent a creative rebirth and debuted its Fall-Winter 2021 collection as KNWLS. The brand strives to embody a disruptive vision of femininity. Best known for experimental bodycon designs that accentuate the silhouette in unexpected ways with bold textures and prints, KNWLS proposes an alternative approach to sensuality, exploring the strength of femininity.

ROISIN PIERCE by Róisín Pierce, Ireland, womenswear

The Dublin-based womenswear designer has been awarded the Chanel Métiers d’Art design accolade as well as the Prix du Public for her premier collection Mná i Bhláth at the International Fashion and Photography Festival, Hyères 34th edition. Subsequently, Róisín collaborated with three Chanel designers in 2020. A mindful and conscious approach to design is top of mind for Pierce, whose brand explores the potential of zero waste cutting and construction techniques, and thoughtful ways of production through deadstock upcycling and material recycling.

RYUNOSUKEOKAZAKI by Ryunosuke Okazaki, Japan, genderless collections

Launched in 2018, Designer Ryunosuke Okazaki, a graduate from with a Design MA from the Tokyo University of the Arts, is inspired by “harmony between people and nature” and “prayer.” Born and raised in Hiroshima, Ryunosuke has been praying for peace since he was a child. Ryunosuke’s approach is to work with the fabric and his hands to create the dress, rather than start with sketching. The brand has received a slew of accolades including the big design award in September 2021, first prize in the Graduation Works Exhibitions in 2021, and winner of the Design MA at Tokyo University of the Arts in 2019.

S.S. DALEY by Steven Stokey Daley, United Kingdom, menswear

Liverpool-born Steven Stokey Daley reinterprets the structural nature of the British upper class through a “homosocial” lens, by creating an overly camp approach to traditionally British elite “uniforms” usually worn to events like rowing regattas and cricket matches. Honing his craft on the menswear teams at Alexander McQueen and Tom Ford, Daley had a range of experiences that prepared him for crafting his own brand identity. In fact, Daley first got noticed from his use of donated McQueen fabrics in his graduate collection.

TOKYO JAMES by Iniye Tokyo James, Nigeria, menswear

Iniye Tokyo James is at the forefront of emerging talent coming out of Nigeria at the moment. Not a traditionally-trained designer, Tokyo James studied mathematics at Queen Mary University, London. Shortly after, he began his career as a young fashion stylist in London, working for various international publications and directing digital campaigns for brands such as Brioni, Issey Miyake, and Puma Black Label. With years of experience under his belt, James launched his digital monthly publication, Rough UK, an authoritative, unapologetic voice with a penchant for strong visual imagery that later expanded to Rough Italia and Rough New York after its successful run in the UK.

WINNIE NEW YORK by Idris Balogun, United States, menswear

A Fashion Institute of Technology graduate, Idris Balogun earned an apprenticeship on London’s prestigious Savile Row at a young age. There he was able to hone and master skills as a cutter and tailor before moving to Burberry, where he helped develop a singular view of the brand under the direction of Christopher Bailey. Shortly after, he began his career with Tom Ford, where he worked as director of menswear and made-to-measure before launching his label.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999650716781616}",neutral,0.9999650716781616,0

It closed in 2019 for a sweeping makeover, which entailed the LVMH-backed maison acquiring six contiguous historic buildings and combining them into a 108,000-square-foot emporium offering a wholly integrated Dior universe designed by luxury retail’s go-to interior architect Peter Marino.

Besides offering womenswear, menswear, accessories, homewares, jewelry, and beauty products imbued with Dior’s savoir faire, the flagship abounds with fanciful details like a luminous sculpture by Paul Cocksedge, suspended in an airy atrium, that mimics Christian Dior’s sketches falling from his desk. An adjoining museum recites the label’s history through the lens of its esteemed creative directors such as Yves Saint Laurent and John Galliano, while the on-site restaurant is helmed by French culinary breakout star Jean Imbert. There’s even a standalone hotel room that allows guests the chance to keep the store open all night for exclusive 24/7 access. “We wanted to build a kind of Luna Park of the senses,” Pietro Beccari, CEO of Dior, tells Business of Fashion. “Someone coming here, if they loved Dior they will love it even more. If they didn’t, they’ll be convinced about the value of this brand.”

LVMH continues to make ambitious forays into experiential retail, which they see as a key strategy for brick-and-mortar businesses to circumvent an evolving retail landscape that’s increasingly pivoting to e-commerce. Expanding its luxury travel portfolio has been a focus, from the expansion of Bulgari-branded properties to Fendi’s pop-up cafes to the acquisition of high-end hotel group Belmond.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999872446060181}",neutral,0.9999872446060181,0

The world's largest luxury players including Chanel, LVMH, Kering, Hermès and Richemont have one by one announced a pause in Russian commercial trading overnight.

The domino effect of store closures means the most high-end jewellery and luxury products from Louis Vuitton to Gucci will not be available on the ground in Russia as the war in Ukraine escalates. Some brands were cautious not to critique Russian President Vladimir Putin or label it a war in their public statements, with many employing staff locally.

Kering said in a statement Friday evening that company stores, which include Gucci, Balenciaga and Saint Laurent, will close temporarily due to “growing concerns regarding the current situation in Europe”. Chanel said Friday it closed its boutiques in Russia and suspended its e-commerce business in the country due to “increasing concerns about the current situation, the growing uncertainty and the complexity to operate”. LVMH also closed stores and paused local operations on Friday, according to WWD.

On Friday, Hermès also shared a statement on LinkedIn that it would close stores and pause all commercial activities in Russia for the foreseeable future. Richemont has closed its stores and suspended business in Russia as of 3 March.

Online stores have paused shipping to the country. E-commerce retailers including Farfetch, Mytheresa and Yoox Net-a-Porter are not sending orders to Russia, and transportation firms DHL and FedEx have halted shipping to the country.

Prior to shuttering operations, some leading luxury companies including Chanel, LVMH and Kering, have donated funds to Ukrainian relief efforts and condemned the ongoing war.

The world’s biggest luxury group LVMH has suspended its business in Russia following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, citing operational challenges and concerns about staff safety.

The group owns 25 wine and spirits brands including Moët & Chandon, Krug, Veuve Clicquot, Hennessy and Château d’Yquem.

The company which owns more than 70 brands including Dior, Louis Vuitton, Fendi in addition to spirits and wines has about 3,500 employees in Russia and operates 120 stores in Russia.

The move however is less likely to cause a big financial impact on the luxury group, as Russia’s luxury market is considered marginal in comparison to the US or China.

Even with sanctions imposed on the country’s oligarchs, UBS estimates UBS reckons that LVMH, Hermès, Kering and Burberry earn less than 1 per cent of revenue in the market even when Russian shoppers buying abroad is taken into account, according to Financial Times.

Many luxury groups including Hermes, Chanel, and major companies such as Apple, Shell and BP have subsequently announced business suspension in Russia.

Last year, LVMH saw significant growth despite the pandemic. It recorded revenue of 64.2 billion euros in 2021, up 44% compared to 2020 and up 20% compared to 2019.

The luxury group’s Wines & Spirits business division recorded organic revenue growth of 26% in 2021 compared to 2020 and 9% compared to pre-pandemic 2019, according to the company’s latest annual report.

Arnault, 73, has run the luxury conglomerate for decades. His net worth is estimated at $155 billion. LVMH includes fashion brands Louis Vuitton and Christian Dior, champagne producer Moët & Chandon, and watch company TAG Heuer.

The CEO could use this time to think about which one of his children will take over, according to a recent Fortune article. The aging patriarch and his five children vying for power closely mirror HBO's series Succession.

Meet Arnault's five talented children who could one day run LVMH.

Delphine Arnault

The French businesswoman is 46 and the VP of Louis Vuitton. She attended the EDHEC Business School in Lille and the London School of Economics.

She began her career at McKinsey in Paris, where she worked as a consultant for two years and learned strategy, according to the Financial Times. She acquired experience in the fashion industry while working at designer John Galliano’s company in 2000, helping develop the brand.

Between 2001 and 2013, she started working at Christian Dior in the shoe department and rose to deputy managing director for the executive committee. During this time, she oversaw one of the label’s most successful periods, steering the growth of leather goods, accessories, and communication strategies.

Since then, she has become executive vice president of Louis Vuitton and is in charge of supervising the brand’s product-related activities. She follows a calm management style and tends to visit stores when they are at their busiest.

The successful businesswoman also sits on boards such as Château Cheval Blanc, The Saint-Emilion Premier Grand Cru, Les Echos, Loewe, Pucci’s, Celine, Christian Dior, 21st Century Fox, and Repossi. Since 2009, she has been a member of the supervisory board of M6, and in 2013 she joined the supervisory board of Havas.

Delphine is also a supporter of the LVMH Prize, which allows young fashion designers to be coached by LVMH professionals. In 2014 she was also named one of Fortune’s 40 under 40.

Antoine Arnault

Antoine, 44, is the head of communications and image at LVMH. He is also the chairman of Loro Piana and chief executive of Berluti. The oldest son got his first chief executive role at Berluti, transforming the luxury shoemaker into a menswear label.

In 2002, when Arnault was 25, he cofounded an internet startup and started working in LVMH’s marketing team. He then got his MBA from Insead and, in 2005, rejoined LVMH in the advertising department.

Two years later, he was made director of communications at Louis Vuitton. Under this role, he launched the “core values” campaigns, which featured international figures like Muhammad Ali, Angelina Jolie, Mikhail Gorbachev, and Bono.

In 2011, he launched Les Journées Particulières, in which members of the public were invited to visit the LVMH ateliers and witness the craftsmanship. This festival takes place across 14 countries and encourages LVMH brands to open their doors to the public. He was appointed chairman of Loro Piana two years later, after his father purchased 80% of the cashmere retailer.

In 2018, he took on his current role at LVMH and was tasked with managing the iconic fashion house's image. A year later, after a personal friend bought Laperouse, a historic Parisian restaurant, Arnault took a minority stake.

Like his sister Delphine and his father, he sits on the board of LVMH. According to the Wall Street Journal, he is married to Natalia Vodianova, a Russian model, and is passionate about golf.

Alexandre Arnault

At 29, Alexandre is fluent in French, English, and German, and the VP at Tiffany.

He graduated from Telecom ParisTech and got a master’s in innovation from École Polytechnique. His digital experience has helped the fashion conglomerate launch 24 Sevres, its e-commerce platform.

In 2017, he was appointed to lead the luxury luggage bag maker Rimowa after LVMH announced that it would acquire an 80% stake in the company. This acquisition was a key move as Rimowa was the last luxury luggage brand left on the market after Samsonite acquired Tumi. The brand influenced LVMH’s digital strategy and collaborations with Supreme, Off-White, and Fendi.

In 2019, he took over his father’s seat on the board of directors at Carrefour, the French supermarket chain. Finally, last year he became executive vice president of product and communications at Tiffany & Co.

In that role, Alexandre has already started shaking things up with his contemporary and modern approach. According to the Wall Street Journal, CEO Anthony Ledru described him as 40% analysis and 60% gut feeling, a go-getter that made things happen sooner rather than later. Thanks to him, Jay-Z and Beyoncé agreed to do the “About Love” campaign for the jewelry company, which featured a Tiffany-blue Basquiat painting.

In 2021 he married Géraldine Guyot, a young designer. The union was first celebrated in Paris and then in Venice. A grand ceremony was held and attended by Roger Federer, Pharrell Williams, the Carters, and Kanye West, who also performed.

Frédéric Arnault

Frédéric, 27, is the chief executive at TAG Heuer, a luxury watch brand. He studied at the École Polytechnique and ran a mobile payment startup with a friend, which they later sold to BNP. He then joined TAG Heuer full-time as the director of strategy and digital.

When Frédéric was 25, he was named CEO of TAG Heuer, making him the second-youngest Arnault to obtain that position after his brother Alexandre. While he puts a lot of focus into connected watches, which now constitutes 15% of all sales, his main focus is e-commerce, which grew 329% in 2020. It was also thanks to him that TAG Heuer got a key partnership with Porsche.

In 2020 he entered the spotlight after he partnered with Ryan Gosling after taking the reins of TAG Heuer. In the beginning, the partnership seemed unusual because the actor had no social media presence and had never endorsed a product before. However, Frédéric saw an opportunity and finally signed a two-year deal with Gosling after a year and a half of negotiations.

Last year, it reported revenues of $7.1 billion from its watch and jewelry sector in the third quarter.

The young businessman’s history with TAG Heuer dates back to when he was 11 and received a TAG Heuer Aquaracer from his father. In 1999 his father bought the brand, and it has become the most significant watch brand in LVMH’s portfolio.

Frédéric is also a man of many talents and plays the piano and tennis, and is fluent in English, Italian, and German.

Jean Arnault

At 23, Jean is the director of marketing and development for Louis Vuitton watches. Louis Vuitton launched its watch factory in 2003.

The youngest Arnault got his master's degrees in mechanical engineering from Imperial College London and financial mathematics from MIT. His interest in the watchmaking industry peaked after his brother Frédéric told him about what he was doing at TAG Heuer, and he studied at the label's watch institute.

Even though he just started in the business world, the future is bright.

Jean told the Financial Times that he sees huge potential in mechanical watches during the digital, connected revolution. The more his generation connects their lives with devices, the more they desire something strictly mechanical.

Luxury Brands in Russia Response to Ukraine Invasion - Town & Country,"Fri, 11 Mar 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRvd25hbmRjb3VudHJ5bWFnLmNvbS9zdHlsZS9mYXNoaW9uLXRyZW5kcy9hMzkzOTcwODAvbHV4dXJ5LWxlYXZlcy1ydXNzaWEtdWtyYWluZS1pbnZhc2lvbi1yZXNwb25zZS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The first free-standing Louis Vuitton store in Russia opened on Moscow’s Stoleshnikov Lane in 2003, part of a retail boom that marked the decades after the end of the Soviet Union. Last week, LVMH, Vuitton's parent company, was at the vanguard again, this time announcing that it was shutting its doors there indefinitely amid the country's devastating invasion of Ukraine.

As the conflict's geopolitical and economic consequences reverberate worldwide, the luxury industry is just beginning to grapple with its response to a sector that represents a fraction of global sales but that it had spent years cultivating.

""Most luxury companies have already 'paused' all operations in Russia, as it’d be practically impossible to maintain a flow of goods and funds,"" said Luca Solca, a senior analyst at the research firm AllianceBernstein, in a note this week, adding that purchases in Russia and Ukraine account for about two to four percent of the market. Brands reached for comment declined to elaborate beyond their initial publicly released statements.

At the consumer level, billionaires—some with ties to President Vladimir Putin's Kremlin— fled to financial safe havens while average luxury shoppers were in a race to buy handbags and designer wares before boutiques formally shuttered. In the day between the Vuitton announcement and the store's closing, shoppers tried on their potential purchases next to the racks instead of wasting time waiting for a changing room, observed Alina Lysova, founder of the Moscow shop Vintage Voyage. Pants and jackets piled in heaps on display counters. High Street staples like Zara and H&M, also winding down business, saw plenty of foot traffic as well.

“We don't know what we can expect [next],” Lysova added. Some customers treated the last shopping sprees as investments as the value of the Russian ruble plummeted. Bulgari, for instance, saw a spike in sales in the first days after the United States and Europe rolled out sanctions, Bloomberg reported.

Design by Michael Stillwell A Twitter account called Russian Oligarch Jets tracks the movements of the elite’s private aircrafts.

The list of businesses that have suspended their Russian operations has only grown longer in the past several weeks. Hermès and LVMH were first out of the gate, followed by Chanel, Kering, Prada, Richemont, and others, joining other major Western consumer brands like Apple, Nike, and McDonald's. E-commerce players like Net-a-Porter and MyTheresa have also stopped shipments. All voiced their support for Ukraine in some form, and cited concern for their Russian employees. LVMH said its employees in the region are eligible for assistance from its Heart Fund, the core of its social responsibility efforts; the group also made a donation of 5 million euros to the International Committee of the Red Cross, according to a message it . Chanel also made a similar donation to relief organizations, writing in its own LinkedIn post, ""Chanel strongly stands for peace and for all people impacted by the war in Ukraine.""

When Fast Retailing chairman Tadashi Yanai declared the Japanese behemoth would stay in Russia, explaining that brands like Uniqlo should not make political comments, the company was widely criticized and a “boycott Uniqlo” hashtag spread online. It has since reversed course.

""It's really easy to post things on social media, you know, 'We stand with fill-in-the-blank' —but what are you going to do about it? And that's what people are now watching for,"" said brand consultant Carineh Martin. ""Luxury purchases in particular are emotionally driven. And thus, brands have to behave in ways that elicit positive emotions from existing and potential clients.""

The actions by the industry are about more than living up to the social values of its customer base. It is far from feasible to operate in Russia at the moment, and the logistics of getting inventory and money in and out will only become more challenging. Several Russian banks have been banned from Swift, the payment network that allows money to travel internationally, and FedEx and UPS have stopped shipments. Visa and Mastercard also suspended their service in the country.

And yet, these decisions were not without their complications. While Russia represents a sliver of the sector, the moves threaten to reverse decades of investment in the market. In recent years, designer labels catered to wealthy Russians who were traveling less because of the pandemic and earlier sanctions by opening stores or expanding their retail accounts, expecting to have brick-and-mortar operations in the region for the foreseeable future.

Now, one likely consequence of the spate of closures is a boost to the grey-market or resale market, exactly the sort of behavior the fashion industry had tried to undermine by expanding globally and standardizing its prices. Affluent Russians are expected to do more of their premium shopping abroad in destinations like Dubai that are still open to them, according to multiple sources with knowledge of the market. And others are likely to call on their personal shoppers for access to the latest collections.

How much this cohort even has left to splurge on status looks and leather goods remains to be seen. As Solca pointed out in his note, consumer confidence writ large could be heavily undercut in 2022 because of continued sanctions against Russia, skyrocketing energy costs and inflation. ""This is particularly relevant for Russian high-net-worth-individuals whose assets are being seized across the world,"" he wrote. On Thursday, the United Kingdom froze the assets of Roman Abramovich, the owner of the soccer club Chelsea FC whose net worth is estimated at north of $12 billion.

By the end of last week, the Bloomberg Billionaires Index published a telling figure: a third of the wealth belonging to Russia’s top 100 billionaires has been wiped out by the economic sanctions, and many are scrambling to sell assets ahead of further restrictions.

On Friday, the Biden administration outlined additional sanctions on Russian bank executives, government officials and their families; downgraded Russia's trade status, effectively banning imports of Russian alcohol, seafood and non-industrial diamonds, and barred exports to Russia of ""high end-watches, luxury vehicles, high-end apparel, high-end alcohol, jewelry, and other goods frequently purchased by Russian elites.""","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9949400424957275}",neutral,0.9949400424957275,0
D-Nice Talks Partnership With LVMH For Club Quarantine Anniversary & CQ Live In Vegas - Vibe,"Fri, 18 Mar 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZpYmUuY29tL211c2ljL211c2ljLW5ld3MvZC1uaWNlLWx2bWgtY2x1Yi1xdWFyYW50aW5lLWxpdmUtbGFzLXZlZ2FzLTEyMzQ2NTE0MzUv0gFgaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudmliZS5jb20vbXVzaWMvbXVzaWMtbmV3cy9kLW5pY2UtbHZtaC1jbHViLXF1YXJhbnRpbmUtbGl2ZS1sYXMtdmVnYXMtMTIzNDY1MTQzNS9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"It’s been nearly two years since D-Nice launched the cultural movement we know as Club Quarantine.

In conjunction with the forthcoming second anniversary of CQ, the famed DJ is partnering with LVMH (Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton) for a special three-night Club Quarantine celebration on Instagram Live. We caught up with the famed DJ and VIBE December 2021/January 2022 cover star while he was in preparation for the event. He spoke about his new partnership, CQ Live in Las Vegas, and showered us with love.

“Before we get into LVMH, I do want to say thank you to the VIBE team because [it was VIBE]. On March 19th [2020], they put the first article out on Club Quarantine when they really believed in it. VIBE definitely plays a major role in the success and in the visibility of Club Quarantine,” he expressed.

“I’ve obviously worked with Moët Hennessy for a long time,” he said about CQ’s new partnership with LVMH. “I had an ambassadorship deal with them for a number of years. And then after that expired, they would hire me for different events.”

Two members of the LVMH team reached out to D-Nice to thank him for what he’s done for the world for the last two years of the global pandemic. They expressed their intent of celebrating him and made a request he nearly refused. He wasn’t initially going to agree to the partnership because, for him, CQ wasn’t about branding.

“It was really about just doing things that kept people going and kept people smiling,” he explained. “What I loved about their response was, ‘This isn’t about our brands. This is truly about you. This is a celebration of you.’ And from that point on, I was with it 100%.”

The dynamic, unifying celebration kicked off on Thursday and will continue on Friday, March 18, and Saturday, March 19, 4-7 p.m. ET.

Virtual CQ attendees will witness D-Nice’s entire three-night set for free ahead of his Las Vegas takeover during Labor Day weekend. Those watching the CQ anniversary shindig will also see surprise in-person guest appearances from some of the DJ’s closest friends as well as one-of-a-kind looks from the fashion house.

Yet, we had to find out why he chose to provide fans a full preview into the next CQ Live as opposed to a series of teasers.

“It’s really about the experience,” he explained. “The thing is I want people to know, when you come to CQ, it’s not just about listening to classics. It’s just about listening to good music and having a good vibe. This is the first time I’m opening up my home to some friends to come over and have a real celebration of CQ while I’m DJing.

“So, that’s what the crew toast is about. This is just my way of saying thank you, two years later. We had an impact on the world; Black music and Black culture saved the world. And it’s just beautiful to celebrate with some of the friends that believed in me in the beginning.”

Comedian Affion Crockett is set to be one of the special guests, with his Club Body Roll set of slow jams.

With the second anniversary of CQ teasing D-Nice’s next live event in Vegas, we learned just how different it will be from CQ: Brooklyn, CQ: Hollywood, and CQ: Atlanta.

“The thing about CQ: Vegas is that I wanted the show to be a true reflection of what CQ is,” shared the 51-year-old. “CQ is community, fun, love, and it’s giving back. So, instead of just doing, like, a concert, I decided on an entire weekend of activities. It’s more than a show. We’ll have the CQ meetup [in addition to] panel discussions on mental health, wellness, financial literacy, and estate planning. We will also have CQ community for business owners.”

Furthermore, CQ: Vegas will have a special CQ After Dark with Tank and El DeBarge plus an all-female takeover pool party featuring female DJs and a performance from Mya.

Tickets for CQ Live in Vegas are now on sale. Be sure to catch the CQ anniversary celebration exclusively on D-Nice’s Instagram.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999785423278809}",neutral,0.9999785423278809,0

Mar 17, 2022

The group will put forward at the next AGM a proposal for pushing back the age limit for its CEO from 75 years to 80 years, allowing current CEO , who is 73, to remain for longer at the helm of the world’s top luxury group.







Bernard Arnault - FNW



At the AGM scheduled on April 21, shareholders will have their say on this proposed amendment to the statutes, deciding whether to set the maximum age for the CEO role at 80, according to the French official bulletin of legal notices, confirming news reported by Capital magazine.



“If the CEO reaches this age in the course of their mandate, they will be considered as having formally resigned at the end of the AGM convened to rule on the financial statement relating to the fiscal year during which such age has been reached,” stated LVMH.

No change is being proposed to the age limit of the president, which remains at 75 years, according to the statutes.



Bernard Arnault has never spoken out about the choice of his successor. His five children are all working for LVMH.



“A change in ownership is unthinkable, and the [Arnault family’s] second generation is responsible for the group's continuity,” said , Bernard’s eldest son, cited in an article on French daily paper Le Monde last July.



In 2021, LVMH set new records for sales and profits, recording a revenue in excess of €64 billion, and a net income of €12 billion.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999897480010986}",neutral,0.9999897480010986,0
NFTs and luxury brands are not the marriage made in heaven some believe - Post Magazine,"Mon, 07 Mar 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjbXAuY29tL21hZ2F6aW5lcy9wb3N0LW1hZ2F6aW5lL2FydGljbGUvMzE2OTM3OC9sdXh1cnktZmFzaGlvbi1oYXMtbm8tYnVzaW5lc3MtaXNzdWluZy1uZnRzLWx2bWhzLWJlcm5hcmTSAXZodHRwczovL2FtcC5zY21wLmNvbS9tYWdhemluZXMvcG9zdC1tYWdhemluZS9hcnRpY2xlLzMxNjkzNzgvbHV4dXJ5LWZhc2hpb24taGFzLW5vLWJ1c2luZXNzLWlzc3VpbmctbmZ0cy1sdm1ocy1iZXJuYXJk?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"When it comes to embracing technology, luxury fashion brands are usually the last in line. It’s often to their own detriment – case in point, their initial unwillingness to sell online. To say that they like to do things the old-fashioned way is an understatement, which is why their obsession with NFTs, or non-fungible tokens, is so perplexing.

NFT is the latest buzzword across multiple industries, from film and finance to art and design. This time around fashion is no exception. The numbers, for one, are rosy. Morgan Stanley estimates that luxury branded NFTs could become a US$56 billion market by 2030. This probably explains why big names have jumped on the bandwagon, from Gucci and Balenciaga to Balmain and Dolce & Gabbana, which recently sold a nine-piece collection of NFTs for a whopping US$6 million.

LVMH head honcho Bernard Arnault, though, is among the few who aren’t sipping the Kool-Aid. Admittedly, he is not the most tech-savvy guy, but we can’t help but think he’s onto something and that the hype, is just, well, hype.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999427795410156}",neutral,0.9999427795410156,0
"‘Stranger, sadder and more surreal’: how the war in Ukraine transformed the fashion shows - The Guardian","Thu, 10 Mar 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9mYXNoaW9uLzIwMjIvbWFyLzEwL3N0cmFuZ2VyLXNhZGRlci1zdXJyZWFsLWNvdmlkLXF1aWV0LWZhc2hpb24tcGFyaXMtbWlsYW4tdWtyYWluZdIBb2h0dHBzOi8vYW1wLnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9mYXNoaW9uLzIwMjIvbWFyLzEwL3N0cmFuZ2VyLXNhZGRlci1zdXJyZWFsLWNvdmlkLXF1aWV0LWZhc2hpb24tcGFyaXMtbWlsYW4tdWtyYWluZQ?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"At the end of London fashion week last month, I wrote about how this season was going to be all about the return of the party dress. People like me hold up fashion to be a kind of divining rod for the coming public mood, so I think it is best to admit that I called that one spectacularly wrong.

Just hours after Milan fashion week began, Russia invaded Ukraine. Coco Chanel once said that “fashion has to do with ideas, the way we live, what is happening”. Great when the world is emerging from a pandemic and life is looking exciting again, and fashion can nurture feelings of hope and optimism by selling delicious new frocks as if they were chicken soup for the soul. Not so great once war breaks out. Military tailoring? I’ll pass, thanks. But it’s fair to say party dresses haven’t been flying off the shelves, either. Which made for a strange mood at fashion week. Tricky to pitch next season’s wardrobe as a fun thing to think about when the immediate future is quite so frightening.

After a slow start, the fashion industry has shown up for Ukraine. From Chanel and Hermès to Zara and H&M, most brands have shuttered stores and paused online operations in Russia. LVMH, which owns Louis Vuitton and Dior, has pledged €5m (£4.2m) to the International Committee of the Red Cross, while Kering, which owns Gucci and Alexander McQueen, pledged an undisclosed “significant” donation to the United Nations Refugee Agency.

The tone of Paris fashion week was, for the most part, sober and businesslike. Many of the collections were already scheduled to be shown in small presentations, because a catwalk show requires months of planning and only deep-pocketed luxury brands were in a position to take that kind of financial risk back in January, when the world was still spooked by Omicron. Paul Smith handed out cups of tea and cheese sandwiches as he explained how the new half-moon shaped shoulder pads he has developed for women’s tailoring offer a wearable take on the dramatic oversized tailoring that was all over the Milan catwalks. “It’s about respecting the female form,” he said. Having spent 16 weeks of 2020 working entirely alone in an office that usually houses hundreds – “just trying to keep the business going, which wasn’t easy, but we did it” – he enjoys the human scale of face-to-face walk-throughs these days. He has been working with stretch gaberdine to make suits more comfortable – which is what everyone wants now – but with construction that maintains the elegant line you get from tailoring.

View image in fullscreen ‘Baggy jeans look like the next Y2K trend to go mainstream.’ Givenchy at Paris fashion week.

Dries van Noten rented a Parisian townhouse of decaying grandeur, with a sweeping staircase that creaked and handpainted wallpaper flaking from the walls, and filled it with vintage mannequins, which he dressed in lean zebra-print skirts over giraffe-striped boots, or quilted coats with shoulders as round as haloes. He wore a kingfisher-blue scarf wrapped around his neck against the chill of a house unoccupied for half a century as he showed his audience around, proudly pointing out tailoring details and embroidery techniques. The clothes were treasures, collectors’ items, but the bones of the looks – skirts over boots, poshed-up puffer coats – were quiet trends that recurred through the week.



Quiet fashion might just be the next big thing. Not quiet as in dressed down and switched off, but quiet as in low-key. Perhaps this was coming anyway. Before this show season was overtaken by world events, the buzz was around the imminent return of Phoebe Philo, the British designer beloved during her time at Celine for her clothes, which were quirky enough to be cult and sophisticated enough to be chic. The likelihood of Philo’s own brand resetting the dial toward something cool-toned and subtle was somewhere in the field of vision of designers as they put together these collections over the winter, even if the sober mood of now was unforeseeable. Philo’s heralded return has not materialised, as yet; I suspect it’s on ice until the world is ready to care about such things again.



What does quiet fashion look like? It’s a slightly too big blazer over a small, vaguely skimpy top – which could be a bra top, but could also be a knit vest, or a lace-trimmed camisole. The big-jacket, small-top look is a “but make it fashion” version of the plain old blazer over a shirt. Quiet fashion is a knee-high boot with a skirt, as I mentioned before, or a quilted coat. It is baggy jeans, which look like the next Y2K trend to go mainstream. It is checks of any kind, and loafers with everything, because preppy is the new streetwear. The colour of the season is the quietest of them all: brown.

“This feels really strange, doesn’t it?” said Stella McCartney, one of the designers who did stage a proper show, backstage at the Pompidou Centre. “Doing a show when Covid was going on felt pretty strange, but this feels even stranger and sadder and more surreal.” Even though it is part of my job, sitting in front of a catwalk feels intensely uneasy right now, in a way that sitting in front of my laptop now does not. For many designers who were staging physical shows, it was their first time doing so since the pandemic began, and they were not minded, for that reason, to cancel, so they groped for some way of reaching across the chasm, to keep faith with the real world, with varying degrees of success. The mood of the show is about more than clothes, which is why many designers altered their soundtracks at the last minute. The Hungarian brand Nanushka played the Ukrainian national anthem; Valentino presaged the show with a voice note by its creative director, Pierpaolo Piccioli, saying that he went ahead with his show – where the venue was painted hot pink, a specific new shade that will be added to Pantone’s official colour scale – because, he said, the collection represented work, and love.



Rick Owens, who had been planning to play music by electronica artist Eprom, switched to the adagietto from Mahler’s Fifth Symphony. He said he would normally think it too sentimental a choice, but felt it was “better suited for the sobriety and search for hope in our current condition”. The inflated, off-kilter jackets and slinky keyholed hooded robes, which were somehow both monastic and a bit S&M, were deeply strange but very beautiful. “During times of heartbreak, beauty can be one of the ways to maintain faith,” Owens said.

Unlike many designers, her goal seemingly is not to innovate, but to uphold the aesthetic that has defined the house since it was founded by her grandfather, Fred Samuel, in 1936.

“My vision is to pursue my family vision,” she said in a recent phone interview.

While Fred operates differently today than it did in the 1930s — it has been owned by LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton since 1995 — the brand’s feeling of breezy but refined luxury with a whiff of the French Riviera remains.

“Our roots and our DNA are still very much relevant today,” Ms. Samuel said. “It’s what I’m enriching, in a way.”

Along those lines, the brand offers updated collections like Force 10, which was originally created by her father, Henri Samuel, in 1966. (He worked for Fred, as did his brother Jean, who died in 1984.) Its distinctive design includes rope-inspired braiding and, often, a curved buckle, both reminiscent of items used for sailing. (Fred Samuel’s sons were championship sailors.)","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999271631240845}",neutral,0.9999271631240845,0
Are fashion brands doing enough amid the Ukraine crisis? - South China Morning Post,"Fri, 04 Mar 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjbXAuY29tL2xpZmVzdHlsZS9mYXNoaW9uLWJlYXV0eS9hcnRpY2xlLzMxNjkyMDEvYW1pZC1ydXNzaWEtdWtyYWluZS13YXItYXJlLWZhc2hpb24tYnJhbmRzLWRvaW5nLWVub3VnaC1obdIBeGh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLnNjbXAuY29tL2xpZmVzdHlsZS9mYXNoaW9uLWJlYXV0eS9hcnRpY2xlLzMxNjkyMDEvYW1pZC1ydXNzaWEtdWtyYWluZS13YXItYXJlLWZhc2hpb24tYnJhbmRzLWRvaW5nLWVub3VnaC1obQ?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Fashion has to tread a difficult line in moments such as these. A multibillion-dollar industry can hardly stop selling and marketing its designs, but the publicity and attention it generates puts brands under pressure to put out a definitive statement as soon as possible.

“I don’t think people understand how surreal this situation is,” she says on the phone from Milan. “Kyiv was a normal European city with a thriving fashion sector. There were a lot of fashion people on that flight and all of us experienced a total disconnect in Milan the next morning – there everyone was talking about clothes and shoes, while we were getting hundreds of messages from relatives about the bombs beginning .”

Ukrainian designer Olha Norba was on one of the last planes out of Kyiv – going, of all places, to fashion week. It was February 23 and she boarded a flight to Milan with a suitcase filled with her wares. The next morning she woke up in the Italian fashion capital to hear her home city was under attack and that her family was fleeing Russian forces.

After a few days of resounding silence, some companies began to speak out. Balenciaga was one of the first, posting a single image of support for Ukraine on an otherwise empty Instagram grid. Ahead of its upcoming Paris Fashion Week show, the brand said it “would open our platforms in the next few days to report and relay the information around the situation in Ukraine”. It also made a donation to the World Food Programme.

Perhaps more importantly, labels including fashion crowd favourite Ganni and Hungarian brand Nanushka said they would no longer send goods to Russia. YNAP – the parent company of Net-a-Porter – followed suit, as did H&M, Nike and British company Asos.

“We have respect for the Russian people and our partners,” said Nanushka’s CEO, Peter Baldaszti, who was sitting in the front row of a Milan Fashion Week show when news of the invasion of Ukraine broke. “We know this is not their decision, but it is impossible to do business with Russia based on our moral values.” He went on to describe it as “a significant financial decision” for the still independent brand.

As the fashion crowd moved on from Milan to Paris, in many ways it was business as usual at first.

Yes, the show music choices were a little more sombre, and yes, most people were keeping their Instagram posts to a minimum, but pressure grew on designers to use the platform generated by their catwalk shows to show solidarity with Ukraine.

Luxury fashion groups, such as Gucci owner Kering, promised to make a significant donation to Ukrainian refugees, but only on March 4 did they announce that they would halt operations in Russia.

Birkin bag maker Hermės and Cartier owner Richemont were the first to announce they planned to temporarily close stores and pause business operations in Russia, followed by LVMH, Kering and Chanel.

Luxury giant LVMH, which owns such brands as Christian Dior, Givenchy, Kenzo, TAG Heuer and Bulgari among others, will close its 124 boutiques in Russia from March 6 but will continue to pay the salaries for its 3,500 employees in the country.

French multinational Kering, whose brands include brands as Gucci, Saint Laurent, Bottega Veneta and Boucheron among others, has two shops and 180 employees, which the company will continue to support.

Richemont, which also owns Dunhill, Jaeger-LeCoultre, Montblanc, Piaget, and Van Cleef & Arpels among other brands, has around a dozen directly operated stores, mostly in Moscow. It said in a statement it had suspended commercial activities in Russia on March 3 after stopping Ukraine operations on February 24. Chanel said it would “temporarily pause its business in Russia”.

Swiss watchmaker Swatch Group, which owns high-end watch and jewellery labels including Harry Winston, said it would continue its operations in Russia, but was putting exports on hold “because of the overall difficult situation”.

“Closing these stores is important, very important in fact,” Norba says. “This war can only be won if Russia changes from the inside. The system and the Russian government have to wake up.

“When the people of Russia find they can’t fly to Paris or buy the clothes they have always bought in the past or use Apple Pay, they will start to wonder what kind of system this is.”

So why were major brands slow to announce they would close their Moscow and St Petersburg stores? There is a lot of money to be made from Russian clients, and the front rows of both Paris and Milan Fashion Weeks had empty spots where groups of well-off Russian women would usually be sitting.

Luxury brands will miss the head-to-toe post-catwalk orders these clients would make – but it won’t cripple them, as data suggests that Russian expenditure on luxury goods is now small compared with China or other Asian countries such as South Korea.

Morgan Stanley, for example, estimates that Russian nationals account for less than 2 per cent of worldwide sales for Kering and Richemont, including Russian spending abroad.

“The importance of Russia and Russian nationals for the luxury goods sector has gone down over the years and is now relatively immaterial,” said Morgan Stanley analyst Édouard Aubin to Vogue Business. “Counter-intuitively, the less homogeneous a society is [in terms of equality], the lower total luxury spend will be, and vice versa.

“Worldwide, the growth of the luxury goods industry is now driven by the middle- to upper-middle class.”

That said, reports are coming out of wealthy Russians spending their savings on luxury goods before the rouble crashes and sanctions take their toll – hence major brands delaying closing their doors as sales of luxury jewellery and watches increased.

While labels grappled with what to do, Paris Fashion Week continued. For now, while borders remain shut and war rages on, Norba and her sister will stay in Milan.

“Of course it’s hard to see people doing all this fashion stuff,” she says. “We want to scream, ‘How could you continue with this nonsense while our world is on fire?’, but of course we did the same when there were conflicts in other parts of the world.

“Life has to continue, even though it will never be the same for us.”

Hermès and Richemont, the holding company behind Cartier, Dunhill and Jaeger-Lecoultre, were the first to announce their commercial suspension in Russia. Then Chanel, LVMH, and Kering, (Gucci, Saint Laurent, Balenciaga, Bottega Veneta, etc.) also joined the blockade. Other brands that have joined the movement include IKEA, H&M, adidas and Canada Goose.

The sanctions imposed on Russia have made it increasingly difficult for international corporations to do business in the country with Visa, Mastercard and Apple Pay recently announcing the suspension of services. Russians currently account for approximately $9 billion in annual spending on luxury goods according to a report by Jeffries.

“Chanel decided to temporarily pause its business in Russia. We will no longer ship to Russia, we will close our boutiques and we have already suspended our e-commerce,” the French maison said. “We regret having taken the decision to temporarily close our boutiques in Russia and pause all our commercial activities as of the evening of 4 March,” echoed Hermès.

LVMH will close 124 boutiques in Russia from this weekend and has pledged to continue to pay the salaries of its 35,000 employees. Kering announced a similar action with its 180 employees in the country. Both conglomerates along with Richemont and L’Oreal have pledged to financially support Ukrainian refugees.

LVMH Hotel Plans On Hold As Fellow Luxe Brands Balk - The Real Deal,"Fri, 04 Mar 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vdGhlcmVhbGRlYWwuY29tL2xhLzIwMjIvMDMvMDQvcm9kZW8tZHJpdmUtZHVzdHVwLXB1dHMtbHZtaHMtcGxhbnMtZm9yLWhvdGVsLW9uLWhvbGQv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"UPDATED, Mar. 8, 2022, 7:46 a.m.: LVMH has hit a roadblock on its planned Cheval Blanc hotel on Rodeo Drive.

The company has asked the city of Beverly Hills to halt its review of the planned 115-key hotel on Rodeo Drive. The request came after a number of luxury retailers voiced objections to the plans, according to the Beverly Hills Planning Commission.

LVMH has asked for the commission to delay hearings to an undetermined date in the future, giving the company more time to provide information on how it can alleviate concerns about the project, according to Masa Alkire, a principal planner with the city.

“We are engaged in detailed studies regarding options for addressing the issues commissioners have identified,” a spokesperson for LVMH said in a statement. “Those studies will take time, and we are therefore requesting continuance of consideration of the project to a future date to be determined.”

The luxury French retailer announced plans to build a Cheval Blanc hotel at 468 Rodeo Drive — formerly occupied by Brooks Brothers. The hotel would also include a 500-person private club and restaurant space. Construction on the project was anticipated to start this year and finish in 2026.

Planning delays will push construction dates back further.

The delay requested by LVMH signals a need for additional time to figure out how it can build its project and take into account concerns brought by Hermès, Armani and Chanel.

Hermès, Giorgio Armani and Chanel were among retailers who had criticized the plans, arguing the hotel would block a shared alley used by the stores to serve their VIP clients.

The high-end retailers also voiced concerns that construction of the project would disrupt their own operations and asked for assurances they would be compensated for any interruptions or damage, according to planning documents.

The companies also asked LVMH to put up $500,000 for the city to hire a third-party construction monitor to “act as an exclusive, fulltime liaison between themselves and the [roject’s construction team.”

“There needs to be good faith negotiation between [LVMH] and its neighbors,” Commissioner Peter Ostroff said in a commission meeting on Feb. 24. “You haven’t done it, it doesn’t feel like you’ve engaged in good faith negotiations.”

City commissioners were also concerned about the increase in traffic the hotel might cause along Santa Monica Boulevard, which already accommodates about 1,400 an hour on a regular day. With the new hotel, that could increase to around 1,635 cars, according to LVMH’s estimates.

Despite opposition from the luxury retailers, many residents wrote to the city’s planning commission in support of the project.

“By adding a luxurious hotel with retail and dining options, we will finally have a strong anchor that will be a draw to tourists and locals alike,” Thomas Blumenthal, the CEO of Gearys, a watch retailer.

The Cheval Blanc isn’t LVMH’s only property on the famed luxury street. In December, the company bought the former 86-room Luxe hotel on Rodeo Drive for $200 million It’s unclear what the retailer plans to do with that property.

"As E-Commerce Sales Surge, a Look at Luxury Giants' Playbooks - The Fashion Law","Fri, 18 Mar 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWZhc2hpb25sYXcuY29tL2FzLWUtY29tbWVyY2Utc2FsZXMtc3VyZ2Utd2hhdC1hcmUtbHV4dXJ5LWdpYW50cy1kb2luZy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"“The pandemic was a consequential moment for e-commerce, Vivek Pandya, a lead analyst at Adobe Digital Insights, stated this week in connection with a report from the data analytics firm, which expects U.S. e-commerce spending to reach $1 trillion this year, up from an estimated $870.8 billion in 2021. Not only did COVID-19 “accelerate e-commerce growth by nearly two years, but it also impacted the types of goods consumers are willing to buy online,” per Adobe. Among those types of goods are, of course, the offerings of luxury goods groups, marking a notable shift among luxury sellers, which have traditionally opted away from e-commerce, and consumers, alike.

“For much of this century, many owners of the leading luxury brands refused to sell online, relying on their physical networks of their own (mainly mono-brand) boutiques and multi-brand third-party retailers,” Deloitte stated in its 2021 Global Powers of Luxury Goods report, pointing to the desire to “retain control over the defining elements of the luxury identity of their brands – exclusivity, craftsmanship and authenticity, customer service and delivery, and consistent luxury consumer experience and messaging,” as well as the “lack of capability to deliver these elements online—both in skills and experience, and in the significant ongoing investment required,” as among a couple of the key reasons for luxury brands’ long-time reliance on models that consisted largely of brick-and-mortar sales.

The onset and enduring impacts of the pandemic paired with the increasing desire for luxury brands to cater to younger consumers, namely, millennials and Gen-Zs, demographics, which are inherently more comfortable purchasing products online than their older counterparts, have seen companies with existing e-commerce and digital marketing capability “respond quickly to pivot to online solutions,” according to Deloitte. The consultancy stated that beginning in 2020, luxury e-commerce “went past the tipping point and became a vital part of the omnichannel distribution strategy for global luxury players” – even if the move to embrace digital is a difficult and resource-intensive one that calls for “sophisticated e-commerce ecosystems” and strategies, localization, etc.

While a few leading luxury companies (notably Rolex and Chanel) “still believe that for some of their categories the final client purchasing experience should always be in a physical store,” luxury brands have made efforts on the e-commerce front and seen significant growth. One need not look further than groups’ FY 2021 reports, the most recent of which (from Prada) was released this week, for indications of this.

The Year in E-Com: Prada, Kering, LVMH & Hermès

In its FY 2021 report, Prada Group revealed that it its online sales were “five times higher” in FY 2021 compared to FY19 and up 61 percent compared to FY20. Online sales now account for 7 percent of its total retail sales, and the group says that it expects to boost investments in its digital footprint in order to enhance consumers’ experience. (A year earlier, Prada stated that the COVID-19 pandemic “accelerated the digital evolution, reinforcing Prada Group’s omnichannel strategy,” prompting e-commerce sales to surge by 200 percent.)

Elsewhere in the market, Kering reported its revenues last month, reflecting on the luxury industry’s embrace of digital and stating that e-commerce broadly was “expected once again to be the fastest-growing distribution channel in 2021 (up 27 percent compared to 2020 but up 89 percent versus 2019).” The proportion of industry revenue generated by online sales – estimated at 12 percent in 2019 – may have reached 22 percent in 2021, per Kering, which noted that “websites directly managed by brands (Brand.com) and e‐concessions (concessions within e-commerce sites) are likely to have seen particularly strong growth, as luxury houses seek to gain greater, or indeed exclusive, control over their distribution.”

In terms of its own e-commerce operations, Kering revealed that as a group, its e-commerce sales topped 2 billion euros in 2021, up 55 percent from the year prior. “The online channel’s penetration rate doubled in two years, and it now accounts for 15 percent of total sales in the retail network,” the Gucci, Balenciaga, Bottega Veneta, and Saint Laurent owner stated, with e-commerce accounting for 23 percent of retail sales in North America, and e-commerce sales tripling compared to 2019. Meanwhile, in Western Europe e-commerce sales accounted for 26 percent of total retail sales, followed by APAC (7 percent) and Japan (5 percent).

Looking at individual brands, Kering confirmed that Saint Laurent, which generated 2.52 billion euros ($2.86 billion) in revenue for the year, saw e-commerce sales “triple compared to 2019.” At Gucci, whose sales rose to 9.73 billion euros ($11.07 billion), e-commerce accounted for almost 16 percent of total retail revenue during the year. “Online sales growth was therefore once again very buoyant, up 55.1 percent relative to 2020,” per Kering, and up 163 percent compared to 2019.

And in a nod to its overarching “focus” on its brand.com sites, Kering stated that Bottega Veneta’s e-commerce business, where sales were four times their 2019 level, “was boosted by the move to bring in-house operations that were previously managed under a joint venture with Yoox.” (Following its move to first internalize e-commerce activities at Gucci, Kering has finalized its other brands in FY21.)

Going forward, Kering asserted that is “investing proactively to develop cross-business growth platforms in the areas of e-commerce, omnichannel distribution, logistics and technological infrastructure, digital expertise and innovative tools.” And as Kering management stated in an earnings call in February, as highlighted by Bernstein, its “low e-commerce penetration in Asia and Japan shows great potential – everything there is done through e-concessions,” such as through Alibaba’s Tmall.

While LVMH provided a bit less insight into its e-commerce operations in its annual report in January, the industry’s largest group did confirm “continued strong growth of online sales alongside gradual return of customers in stores,” and its aim to “pursue further digitalization of our Maisons to enrich customers’ experience online and in stores.” In a nod to the importance of brand.com operations, LVMH states that it made “the choice … to keep [its brands’] distribution highly selective, limit promotional offers and develop online sales through their own websites” in order to “preserve their exceptional image – a key element of their lasting appeal.”

In terms of individual brands, aside from citing success of e-commerce sales for Sephora (which boasted “continued momentum” online, as it “scales up its digital strategy”) and brands within its beauty/fragrance division, LVMH revealed that Loewe “had a record year,” with “online sales growing significantly.” At the same time, LVMH states that “2021 was a year of new energy for Marc Jacobs, with strong growth in the United States and a highly impressive surge in online sales.”

Based on the language of its reports, LVMH’s efforts on the digital front – at least when it comes to its Fashion & Leather Goods brands – appear to be more focused on connecting with consumers and providing them with “high quality” and “compelling digital experiences” first, suggesting that it is still holding on to a preference for in-store sales to some extent, even if its e-commerce transactions are rising.

Finally, Hermès revealed that for FY 2021, it “continued to selectively develop its distribution network and online sales increased worldwide, with the rollout of new services and sustained growth in traffic.” Focusing on omnichannel development, management for Hermes confirmed that e-commerce continues to be a strong performer worldwide, particularly in attracting new customers to the brand. 78 percent of online sales in FY2021 were made by new customers, per Hermès, which does not see online sales acting to cannibalize in-store sales. Hermès asserted that in 2021, digital sales endured despite the reopening of physical stores.

Looking Ahead

Rising e-commerce sales for these groups and their increased emphasis on digital comes consumers proved increasingly willing to purchase these types of products online in 2021, despite consumers traditionally preferring to engage in luxury goods purchasing in-store. “While luxury shopping is very much still an in-person activity,” eMarketer found that as of January 2022, 2 in 5 U.S. adults who had bought luxury items in the past year had done so online.

This consumption trend is expected to continue, with Bain & Co. projecting that as much as one-third of all personal luxury purchases will take place digitally by 2025, putting the impetus on brands, even the likes of Rolex and Chanel, to engage in this space in at least some capacity.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9791042804718018}",neutral,0.9791042804718018,0

Two-Thirds of Tiffany Senior Management Departed in Year After Acquisition - JCK,"Mon, 21 Mar 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmpja29ubGluZS5jb20vZWRpdG9yaWFsLWFydGljbGUvdGlmZmFueS1tYW5hZ2VtZW50LWxlZnQv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"UPDATE: On March 31, a Tiffany spokesperson wrote JCK that Tiffany CEO Anthony Ledru was referring to “senior management” in the WWD interview, not Tiffany’s overall workforce.

A little more than a year after it was acquired by LVMH, about one-third of Tiffany’s senior management consists of “originals” who are still with the famed jeweler, president and CEO Anthony Ledru told WWD in an interview published on Friday.

LVMH veterans comprise about one-third of the jeweler’s current senior management, with the final third coming from outside both companies.

It is extremely common for workers to depart or be fired following an acquisition. Typical attrition rates following takeovers are estimated at being between 20% and 33%. One study concluded that “approximately 50–75% of key managers leave voluntarily within two to three years after a company has been acquired.”

Tiffany’s spokespeople did not return a request from JCK to comment on the reported remarks by the time of publication.

Ledru told WWD that Tiffany particularly looked for workers in the “wider fashion industry,” whom he believed could “bring a faster pace of thinking.”

“We are living in a fast-moving world, and that’s an important skill set for a lot of people coming from the fashion world, where there are a lot of drops and you have to react quickly,” he reportedly said. “That’s what you need in hard luxury now.”

Ledru worked for Tiffany from 2013 to 2014, before moving to Louis Vuitton. He was appointed CEO following the acquisition by LVMH in January 2021.

He also told the publication that he plans to remodel 30–50 stores a year.

“We move quickly,” he said. “I believe that moving with speed and being efficient is not an enemy of success.”

He denied talk that Tiffany will become more of a “European luxury house,” noting the jeweler has always had a “global approach.”

“There is a form of generosity around Tiffany, more so than a traditional European jeweler,” he said. “You come into a Tiffany store, and we really feel like you should leave with a Blue Box because of that broad offering. It’s about, ‘When I come to Tiffany, I feel welcome and at ease.’ That is part of the dream of the brand, that we have this universal approach.”

Prada, Moncler, Hermès, LVMH, Kering, Richemont and Chanel have suspended operations in Russia, while Nike is also temporarily closing all stores in the country, after halting sales via its website and app last week.

Prada, Moncler Suspend Retail Operations in Russia

The luxury labels released statements over the weekend announcing their temporary suspension of retail operations in Russia, joining a growing list of fashion companies that have done the same, including Hermès and LVMH.

Moncler’s store in Moscow is closed as of Saturday, March 5, and its e-commerce services in the country have already been on pause. “In this moment of growing uncertainty and concern, we have decided to temporarily suspend our operations in Russia,” Moncler said in a statement to BoF. “We will continue to stay in close contact with our local teams and their families to ensure full support.”

Prada is also holding off operations in Russia as of March 5. “From today, the Prada Group suspends its retail operations in Russia,” the company said in a statement.

“Our primary concern is for all colleagues and their families affected by the tragedy in Ukraine, and we will continue to support them.”

Kering, Chanel, Inditex and Nike closed their stores in Russia as well.

Hermès Temporarily Closes Russia Stores

French luxury group Hermès said on Friday it would temporarily close its stores in Russia and pause all commercial activities in the country, the first major international luxury group to publicly announce such a move.

“Deeply concerned by the situation in Europe at this time, it is with regret that we have taken the decision to temporarily close our stores in Russia and pause all our commercial activities from the evening of March 4th,” Hermès said in a post on its LinkedIn page. It gave no further details.

Hermès has three stores in Moscow.

Doing business in Russia has become complex following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, which prompted the United States and Europe to impose sweeping sanctions.

While affluent Russians are keen consumers of luxury goods, analysts say the proportion of luxury sales generated from Russian nationals is small compared to the industry’s main growth engines, China and the United States.

According to estimates from Jefferies, Russians account for around $9 billion in annual luxury sales, around 6 percent of Chinese spending and 14 percent of American spending.

L’Oréal, LVMH and Kering have all pledged financial support to organisations assisting Ukrainian refugees.

Swiss watchmaker Swatch Group, which owns high end watches and jewellery labels including Harry Winston, said it would continue its operations in Russia but was putting exports on hold “because of the overall difficult situation.”

The group, which has its headquarters in Paris, took the decision given “the current circumstances in the region,” the spokesperson said.

Doing business in Russia has become complex since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, which prompted the United States, Britain and the Europe Union to impose sweeping sanctions.

The announcement follows similar moves earlier in the day by Birkin bag maker Hermes and Cartier owner Richemont, who were the first major global luxury firms to pause all commercial activities in the country.

The spokesperson added that the group’s 3,500 employees in Russia would continue to receive their salary and benefits.

Swatch Group Halts Exports to Russia But Keeps Stores Open

Swatch Group AG is halting exports to Russia but will keep its stores open to continue selling Omega, Longines and Tissot watches to Russian customers.

“We have put exports to Russia on hold because of the overall difficult situation,” a company spokesman said in an emailed statement. The company’s fully owned Russian affiliate and Russian stores remain operational.

Luxury jewellery and watchmakers have continued to do business in Russia even as brands like Nike and Apple halt sales in response to the invasion of Ukraine. Some luxury brands including LVMH-owned Bulgari have seen a rise in Russian sales as people purchase watches and jewellery in a bid to preserve wealth as the value of the ruble has plummeted.

Swatch’s Russian export halt was first reported by WatchPro, a trade publication.

Nike to temporarily close all stores in Russia

Nike said on Thursday it would temporarily close all its stores in Russia, joining a slew of Western brands that have suspended their businesses in the country following Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine.

The U.S. sportswear maker had made merchandise purchases on its website and app unavailable in Russia earlier this week and directed its customers in the country to brick-and-mortar stores instead.

The latest decision covers both Nike-owned and -operated stores.

The company also said its foundation would be donating $1 million to the United Nations Children’s Fund and the International Rescue Committee to support relief efforts.

Earlier in the day, U.S. off-price chain TJX Cos Inc said it would sell its 25 percent stake in Russian low-cost apparel retailer Familia, with two of its executives also resigning from their director and observer positions.

"Louis Vuitton loses copyright infringement battle, Le Canard Enchaîné reports - Vogue Business","Wed, 23 Mar 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZvZ3VlYnVzaW5lc3MuY29tL2Zhc2hpb24vbG91aXMtdnVpdHRvbi1sb3Nlcy1jb3B5cmlnaHQtaW5mcmluZ2VtZW50LWJhdHRsZS1sZS1jYW5hcmQtZW5jaGFpbmUtcmVwb3J0c9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"To receive the Vogue Business newsletter, sign up here.

Louis Vuitton has been ordered to pay €900,000 in a Paris appeal court over a seven-year-long copyright infringement dispute, French newsweekly Le Canard Enchaîné (or “The Chained Duck”) reports.

The copyright dispute concerns a graphic lock that features on Louis Vuitton’s Twist handbag, wallet and other accessories that independent designer Jocelyne Imbert created. LVMH did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Vogue Business.

Louis Vuitton Malletier will have to pay Imbert €900,000 ($992,709) in compensation, according to an 11 March judgment of the court of appeal, seen by the newspaper and Vogue Business. The judges had previously rejected Imbert’s case in the first court in 2020 in a drawn out case.

Read More Louis Vuitton to increase prices due to higher costs, Reuters says The LVMH owned brand is increasing its prices globally amid increased manufacturing and transportation costs, according to Reuters.

In 1988, Imbert created a lock called “LV tournant” for Louis Vuitton Malletier, the judgment shows. The court found that in 1992, Louis Vuitton Malletier and Imbert signed a special contract on the usage of the lock that agreed that if any new range of bags or a new line of bags uses the lock, Imbert would receive a new payout for around €76,000. Imbert noted that she had discovered in 2014 that LVM had been using the lock in the new Twist line — and subsequently in additional products — and she reached out to the company in writing, according to the court judgment. Attempts were made to settle.

""To summarise Louis Vuitton's position, they claim that the 1992 agreement enables them to exploit my client's creation on every product. Needless to say we strongly disagree with this,"" Imbert's lawyer Jean-Philippe Hugot tells Vogue Business. ""My client has always expected a negotiation with Louis Vuitton,"" he adds.

Louis Vuitton's lawyer did not respond to Le Canard Enchaîné but the newspaper reported they are expected to appeal in Cour de Cassation, the next stage. The company will have to pay €900,000 even in the case of Cour de Cassation, Imbert’s lawyer Jean-Philippe Hugot told Vogue Business.

Doing business in Russia has become complex since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, which prompted the United States, Britain and the Europe Union to impose sweeping sanctions.

“Given our increasing concerns about the current situation, the growing uncertainty and the complexity to operate, Chanel decided to temporarily pause its business in Russia,” the French luxury fashion house said in a LinkedIn post.

Luxury giant LVMH, which owns such brands as Christian Dior, Givenchy, Kenzo, TAG Heuer and Bulgari among others, will close its 124 boutiques in Russia from Sunday but will continue to pay the salaries for its 3,500 employees in the country, a spokesperson told Reuters.

French multinational Kering, whose brands include brands as Gucci, Saint Laurent, Bottega Veneta and Boucheron among others, has two shops and 180 employees, which the company will continue to support.

While affluent Russians are keen consumers of luxury goods, analysts say the proportion of luxury sales generated from Russian nationals is small compared to the industry’s main growth engines, China and the United States.

Richemont, which also owns Dunhill, Jaeger-LeCoultre, Montblanc, Piaget, and Van Cleef & Arpels among other brands, has around a dozen directly operated stores, mostly in Moscow. It said in a statement it had suspended commercial activities in Russia on March 3 after stopping Ukraine operations on Feb. 24, the day Russia launched its invasion.

Rihanna's lingerie IPO could add another billion to her fortune - Quartz,"Sat, 12 Mar 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vcXouY29tLzIxNDA5NjEvcmloYW5uYXMtbGluZ2VyaWUtaXBvLWNvdWxkLWFkZC1hbm90aGVyLWJpbGxpb24tdG8taGVyLWZvcnR1bmXSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"After her cosmetics brand Fenty Beauty made her a billionaire last year, Rihanna’s stands to make just under another billion dollars from her lingerie company Savage by Fenty.

The firm is mulling a $3 billion public listing, which could happen sometime this year according to a Bloomberg report. Rihanna, who founded and serves as creative director and CEO of the brand, holds a 30% stake in the body-positive underwear line.

What she would net from a Savage IPO is not far behind the $1.4 billion she’s already earned from her LVMH-backed cosmetics venture, according to Forbes. She currently ranks 16th on a Forbes list of America’s richest self-made women.

Rihanna’s inclusive and diverse approach has driven her success. Fenty Beauty, for instance, carries over 40 shades in its foundation collection, while Savage X Fenty celebrates bodies of all shapes and sizes. Fans of the Barbadian celebrity have also voiced their desire for her to design a maternity line, after learning in January that she is expecting her first child with rapper A$AP Rocky.

Not all of Rihanna’s ventures have gone according to plan, however. Her designer fashion attempt with LVMH was put on hold indefinitely as it struggled to stand out and spending on trendy fashion slowed down during the pandemic.

Women-led brands shaking up lingerie

For decades, the women’s lingerie space was dominated by Victoria’s Secret. But changing cultural mores spurred by the #MeToo movement and the company’s association to serial sexual predator Jeffrey Epstein has forced the company to revamp itself.

Lingerie in general has been a goldmine for women in business. Sara Blakely became the youngest self-made female billionaire in 2012 with her Spanx underwear line. Meanwhile, Kim Kardashian’s Skims business doubled its valuation to $3.2 billion in January.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9998553991317749}",neutral,0.9998553991317749,0

Luxury fashion house LVMH Japan and Japanese holding company SoftBank Corp. have signed a strategic partnership to enhance customer experience and services for luxury brands by leveraging technology. The fashion house aims to develop and accelerate new customer experiences in stores and online, using a range of SoftBank solutions and know-how.#

VR/5G technologies will enable new experiences and brand stories for customers. Utilising the power of 5G, customers in stores will enjoy real-time communication with artisans in virtual reality spaces and experience the manufacturing process of products and immersion in the Maison’s history and values. LVMH Japan and SoftBank will proceed with consideration for this project concretely to create an innovative customer experience.

LVMH Japan has intensified the digitalisation of customer communication by creating official accounts for some brands on the Line messaging application operated by one of SoftBank’s group companies, Line Corporation. From now on, LVMH’s Maisons will go even further and develop new operational marketing initiatives and data use cases with the support of Official Line Account features.

In 2018, LVMH Japan implemented a payment service application provided by SB Payment Service Corp., a SoftBank group company. This application facilitated China-based QR code payment services and tablet-based payments anywhere within stores, which contributed to luxurious purchase experiences and increased sales. Going forward, LVHM Japan will consider implementing PayPay and other QR Code payment services to provide even more cashless options, thereby facilitating smoother customer service for even more clients, the release added.

Toni Belloni, group managing director, LVMH, stated: “This new, unprecedented and significant partnership with SoftBank is the reflection of our high ambitions: embracing digital technology to offer new services and features that keep customers at the centre. By combining our best-in-class approaches in our respective industries, it will take us forward. The new opportunities offered to our customers are exactly what our talented teams are working for at LVMH: a unique and unforgettable experience.”

Under our ‘Beyond Carrier’ strategy, SoftBank drives DX in various industry sectors, leveraging advanced technologies underpinned by our communications business foundation. With this strategic partnership, we will work closely with LVMH Japan, which runs a number of world-famous luxury brand businesses, to implement a range of measures that enhance customer experiences through technology. As a result, we are anticipating an acceleration of digital transformation in the fashion sector and beyond.”

According to its complaint, Cartier claims that on the day of her interview with Tiffany & Co.’s Vice President of North America Merchandising Katie Liappas in December 2021, Marino, who is named as a defendant in the case, forwarded “very sensitive and valuable” internal company documents to her personal email, including “pricing information and detailed product distribution strategies,” “internal presentations and guidance regarding High Jewelry, marketing and communications,” and “detailed notes of meetings inclusive of planning, real-time ‘to do’ lists and merchandising activities for 2022,” among other things that “she viewed as potentially helpful to her.”

Taken together, this information – which Cartier asserts is “only accessible by a limited number of Cartier employees [and] not known outside of Cartier” – constitutes “Cartier’s strategy for High Jewelry, including enough information to allow a sophisticated competitor to replicate key strategies and, with relative ease, to reverse engineer how Cartier allocates, merchandises, and prices its High Jewelry stock.” Given the proprietary and confidential nature of this information, Cartier claims that it amounts to a trade secret-protected asset.

Cartier v. Tiffany

After being offered the Tiffany job, Cartier alleges that Marino provided her two-week notice, allegedly alerting the company in her exit interview that she was leaving to work in an “entirely new space” and gave her former employer the “distinct impression that she was not going to be working in luxury jewelry,” and as a result, she was permitted to work through her two-week notice period until December 28, 2021.

Fast forward to early January 2022 and Cartier claims that it became aware that Marino had begun working at Tiffany, along with a number of other former Cartier employees, who had similarly jumped ship, including a former Cartier Assistant Vice President who had allegedly commenced work at Tiffany despite being subject to “a non-compete restriction [from Cartier] that prevented her from working for Tiffany for a period of six months.” (During her interview, Liappas allegedly mentioned that “several other Cartier employees had recently left to work at Tiffany […] because they were unhappy about the recent acquisition of Tiffany by LVMH, and that the two brands were “at each other’s throats.”)

While Marino was not required to observe a non-compete period between jobs, she was, however, bound by non-disclosure and non-solicitation agreements that she had previously signed as part of her role at Cartier, which Cartier claims she breached by using confidential Cartier intel, including from the aforementioned documents, to benefit Tiffany. Specifically, Cartier claims that on at least one occasion, and upon the request of Tiffany management, Marino “referenced a [Cartier] Excel spreadsheet” that she had sent to herself while still employed by Cartier that “detailed Cartier’s confidential, High Jewelry assortment information.” Based on that spreadsheet, Cartier alleges that Marino “created a new Excel document, derived entirely from Cartier’s confidential information,” including “the total number of High Jewelry pieces at various Cartier locations in the U.S.”

Beyond that, Cartier asserts that by forwarding herself confidential Cartier information and holding on to it, Marino has run afoul of the provision in her Cartier employment agreement that “immediately upon separation from employment, she would return to [Cartier] any and all documents” that contain any “Confidential Information and Trade Secrets” that she obtained in connection with her employment.

Still yet, Cartier asserts that Marino was in contact with current Cartier employees, who shared confidential information, such as a Cartier “Fall 2021 sales meeting presentation with confidential sales information for FYs 2021 and 2022,” with her, which Marino sent to her bosses at Tiffany. (Among other “particularly urgent or high priority” confidential intel that Marino’s bosses were seeking from her was information about whether Cartier was planning price increases, with Marino’s direct supervisor Liappas allegedly sending a “request that Marino reach out to someone who might know the answer.”)

Given the alleged pattern of Tiffany & Co.’s management “openly asking for highly valuable, detailed confidential information that would foster unfair competition,” Cartier claims in the newly-initiated lawsuit that Tiffany now possesses “a substantial amount of [its] confidential and trade secret information that it obtained from Marino and other former Cartier employees” as a result of their “unlawful taking of Cartier’s valuable confidential information and trade secrets.”

With the foregoing in mind, Cartier sets out claims of breach of contract and breach of loyalty against Marino individually, unfair competition and tortious interference with business relations against Tiffany, and trade secret misappropriation against both of the defendants. Cartier is seeking preliminary and permanent injunctive relief to require Tiffany and Marino to refrain from using the allegedly misappropriated information and return it to Cartier, among other things, as well as a judgment for any “compensatory damages that may be caused by [Tiffany’s] wrongful conduct.”

Making the Case

In what is unlikely to be an open-and-shut case, in order to prevail on its trade secret claim, Cartier will need to show that: (1) the information at issue is, in fact, valuable business information – and that it has kept that information secret; (2) the information is not generally known; and (3) Tiffany & Co. used the “secret” information (i.e., the confidential information that is not generally known to a company’s competitors and that provides the holder with a competitive advantage).

As for defenses, Tiffany & Co. can, at least in theory, push back on all three points, including by arguing that no such proprietary information exists; Cartier did not do enough to ensure that such information was kept secret (which should prove interesting in the age of Zoom and remote work … see Smash Franchise Partners v. Kanda Holdings for more on that); and/or it did not actually use the allegedly misappropriated information, and that any efforts that it did make in regards to its “high jewelry” strategy were the result of use of its own intel or of public information.

Should Cartier successfully establish that it maintains trade secret information that Cartier misappropriated, the case is still hardly a straightforward one, as establishing damages is often particularly challenging in cases like this, as it is relatively difficult to assign a dollar value to trade secret information, such as know-how, manufacturing processes and business practices, in order to compensate the plaintiff for the economic loss allegedly caused by the defendant’s misappropriation. As a result, courts generally have quite a bit of discretion in fashioning damages awards.

A rep for Tiffany & Co. was not immediately available for comment on the Cartier lawsuit.

Not the first high-profile trade secret misappropriation matter, Cartier’s lawsuit against Tiffany comes almost seven years after the Love Bracelet-maker filed a similar suit against a former advertising employee back in 2014, who allegedly plotted to misappropriate Cartier’s trade secrets after joining Tiffany & Co. and attempting to lure another former Cartier employee to a similar position at Tiffany & Co., as well. That case ultimately settled within a year of it being filed.

Tiffany & Co. is currently in the midst of a sweeping revamp since being brought under the LVMH umbrella in a $15.8 billion deal that was completed last year. In its full-year report for 2021, LVMH revealed that Tiffany generated consolidated revenues of 4.31 billion euros and profit from recurring operations of 778 million euros, and stated that the successful consolidation of Tiffany into the group has “reinforced LVMH’s position in high jewelry,” while further “expanding its presence in the U.S.”

LVMH is the big winner for France's Michelin star restaurants - The Straits Times,"Wed, 23 Mar 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN0cmFpdHN0aW1lcy5jb20vbGlmZS9mb29kL2x2bWgtaXMtdGhlLWJpZy13aW5uZXItZm9yLWZyYW5jZXMtbWljaGVsaW4tc3Rhci1yZXN0YXVyYW50c9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS (BLOOMBERG) - Luxury giant LVMH came out the big winner in this year's Michelin guidebook for France with its Plenitude restaurant in Paris garnering three stars less than a year after opening.

The dining room at the Cheval Blanc hotel is backed by billionaire Bernard Arnault, chairman and chief executive officer of LVMH.

Plenitude's chef Arnaud Donckele hails from the brand's St-Tropez outpost La Vague d'Or, which also has three stars. The restaurant's pastry chef, Maxime Frederic, was recognised with an award for patisserie at this year's ceremony.

In an interview with Bloomberg, Plenitude's Donckele said the Paris venue has given him the opportunity to focus on a different menu, especially dishes with sauces; at Saint Tropez, the emphasis is on local ingredients.

""Sauces don't lie,"" he said. ""Our world is so focused on the visual. A sauce doesn't really lend itself to the visual. It's something very genuine.""

Michelin also awarded three stars to La Villa Madie, Cassis, run by chef Dimitri Droisneau. There are now a total of 31 three-star restaurants in France.

The longstanding guidebook announced their star selection for the country at a ceremony in Cognac on Tuesday (March 22).

Unsurprisingly, there has been some upheaval in Paris' fine dining scene over the course of the pandemic.

The perennial three-star Alain Ducasse au Plaza Atenee closed in June after serving luxurious seafood for 21 years.

Earlier this year, Ducasse introduced a dining pop up ADMO, a US$430 (S$583) extravaganza with another world renowned chef Albert Adria, that ran for 100 days at Ducasse's Paris restaurant Les Ombres.

""The impact of the pandemic is still weighing on the sector,"" said Mr Gwendal Poullennec, international director of Guide Michelin, at the ceremony.

He added that food prices are rising and that there are more than 200,000 jobs open in France in restaurants and hotels.

In a separate interview with Bloomberg, Mr Poullennec added: ""This year has been difficult for the restaurant sector following long periods when they were closed because of the pandemic.""","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9998921155929565}",neutral,0.9998921155929565,0
