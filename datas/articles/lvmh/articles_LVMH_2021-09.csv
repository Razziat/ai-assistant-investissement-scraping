Why LVMH Is On a Gen-Z Hiring Spree - The Business of Fashion,"Fri, 24 Sep 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzb2ZmYXNoaW9uLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy93b3JrcGxhY2UtdGFsZW50L3doeS1sdm1oLWlzLW9uLWEtZ2VuLXotaGlyaW5nLXNwcmVlL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Earlier this week, LVMH announced it planned to recruit 25,000 people under the age of 30 by the end of next year.

The hiring binge by the world’s biggest seller of luxury goods signals more than the latest escalation in the global war for talent. As part of the announcement, the company said it is addressing barriers that have historically kept many from joining its training programmes.

“Young people around the world, regardless of their background or training,” according to a company statement, can now qualify for thousands of spots in “Inside LVMH,” a programme that offers training on trades like craftsmanship and coaching from LVMH employees, HR staff and managers.

Whether the company keeps its promise remains to be seen: LVMH did not outline in detail how it would bring in “young people around the world, regardless of their background or training,” and the announcement specified only 5,000 internships and apprenticeship positions globally, plus 2,500 permanent employment contracts in France — well short of 25,000 positions.

But this week’s announcement brings together months of pandemic-borne introspection for the company and reflects broader shifts in how the fashion industry is approaching the problem of finding and retaining new talent. In the wake of last year’s social justice protests, more companies are feeling the pressure to ramp up their efforts to diversify their workforce.

At the same time, many fashion companies are facing a broader labour shortage as their workforce ages and fewer young people are drawn to low-paying, entry-level roles in the industry. European luxury companies like LVMH also need to find a new generation of specialised workers to manufacture their clothes, leather goods and jewellery.

“This is part of our regional strategy to amplify the support to the next generation... what we want to do is have genuine relationships with students and early career professionals and to make sure that we give access to opportunities,” said Karin Raguin, vice president of talent management and corporate responsibility at LVMH North America. “What we want to do at the end of the day is to recruit now, but also to recruit for the long run.”

Companies looking to diversify their workforces are best served by taking steps to “ensure a talent pipeline,” said Caroline Pill, London-based partner at executive placement firm Kirk Palmer Associates.

High-end beauty and fashion purveyors in particular have a history of hiring candidates from well-to-do backgrounds and often with degrees from top-tier universities. This has meant that a certain type of candidate — often white and with family money — has had the greatest opportunity to secure the internships and entry positions that allow them to eventually climb the management ranks.

“Creating a more diverse environment…. it’s not enough to work at the mid- or senior management level,” Pill said. “It needs to start at... entry-level.”

Companies that recruit staffers that are younger and from underrepresented groups are also better able to tap into a treasure trove of profit-generating data about how these groups “think and what they want,” she said.

Creating Opportunities

In order to build a talent pipeline, companies must actually have opportunities for training and advancement that they can offer even their lowest-ranking employees.

Long gone are the days when fashion and beauty firms could use their glamorous facade to lure in bright-eyed interns and junior employees to fetch coffee for executives in exchange for a meagre paycheck and the vague promise of making industry connections. Today’s entry-level candidates aren’t just hoping to have a job; they’re looking for tangible skills that will set them up for long-term success.

Positioning interns and entry-level workers as part of a talent pipeline helps create the impression that these roles are likely to become careers. That can draw a higher calibre of applicants.

“By creating these programs, and showing [younger talent] the craft of it… you’re giving them access to something they can learn while also training them in your own very specific process,” said Lisa Butkus, partner and head of the retail and luxury goods practise at executive search firm Hanold Associates. “It becomes an investment in them [as much as in] the succession plan for your own company.”

External programmes and partnerships can provide the training and skills that might not be readily available at, for instance, a job as a sales associate in a store. In July, Walmart promised to pay for college tuition and books for store associates, and in August, Target said it would offer 340,000 employees learning opportunities in 250 “business-aligned programmes.”

These sort of initiatives meet Gen-Z and Millennials’ demands to “see and feel that a company is investing in them,” said Butkus.

“Down the road, this is saving companies from having to constantly look externally for talent or having to recruit and react in a market like this,” said Butkus. “This is how you end up with a person that started out moving shopping carts in high school and is on the executive team 30 years later — it builds loyalty.”

Earlier this year, LVMH’s North America arm launched LVMH Happiness, bi-monthly developmental programmes focused on wellbeing, including how to manage emotional fatigue, led by LVMH leaders. These sessions are open to all employees, Raguin said.

Fashion firms that promise career development need to quickly prove they plan to follow through. From day one, companies should provide participants with an outline of what they’re expected to accomplish and when. Companies should also make clear the specific job titles young professionals will qualify for and be transparent about the number of available positions.

Managing expectations is key.

“[It’s not] an approach of ‘we’re going to hire all these young people or we’re going to bring them into these programmes and then just hope to develop them,’” said Butkus.

“Our business is experiences. In a way, hospitality is a lab at the service of luxury,” says Lefebvre. (For 72 rooms and suites, four restaurants and a spa, Cheval Blanc Paris employs 400.) “The talent of our teams is to personalise and detect the expectations and desires of our guests in terms of speed of service, level of formality... Training is essential. We have teams from other Cheval Blanc hotels here.”

Cheval Blanc sits in LVMH’s “other activities” division, alongside Cipriani Hotel owner Belmond Last year, Andrea Guerra was appointed CEO of a new entity within the conglomerate, LVMH Hospitality Excellence, which oversees Cheval Blanc and Belmond.

“[Belmond]’s heritage, its innovative services, its excellence in execution and its entrepreneurship resonates well with the values of the group and is complementary to our own Cheval Blanc maisons and the Bulgari hotels activities,” LVMH chairman and CEO Bernard Arnault said when the acquisition was announced in December 2018. (A Bulgari hotel is set to open on Paris’s Avenue George V.)

The rationale for investing in experiential luxury is still relevant despite the difficult tourist landscape according to Mario Ortelli, managing director of Ortelli & Co, a strategy advisory company for luxury goods. This week, the EU recommended to its member states to ban non-essential visitors coming from the US following a rise in the country’s Covid-19 cases. The American clientele is a key market for Cheval Blanc, especially in Saint Barthélemy and St Tropez. It’s betting on the American visitors in Paris, too. “The demand growth for experiential luxury is a secular trend, driven by the new generation. In my view, when the Covid restrictions will go away, the spending will significantly bounce back,” Ortelli says. “We have already seen this summer when restrictions lifted in high end locations, the top hotels sold out with very high net per diem. Bernard Arnault is never betting on the next week. He’s betting on the long term. I believe experiential luxury is a good bet for him and his investors.”

Occupancy rate in Paris’s luxury hotels in the first seven months of 2021 was 14.3 per cent, a steep decline compared to 72.8 per cent in 2019, according to MKG data; July saw an uptick to 43 per cent. August was also strong, according to François Delahaye, general manager of Hotel Plaza Athénée, driven by Middle Easterns and Americans. Tourist flows from the US and the Middle East are expected to fully recover by 2023, according to Anita Balchandani, McKinsey & Company partner EMEA and apparel, fashion & luxury leader. She predicts China, a typically significant tourist region for France, remains a challenge, with flows to and from China expected to recover to 80 per cent of 2019 levels by 2024."
"LVMH Rises in Perception Value as Consumers Seek Pleasure Factor, New Report - WWD","Wed, 01 Sep 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vd3dkLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy1uZXdzL2ZpbmFuY2lhbC9sdm1oLXJpc2UtYnJhbmQtdmFsdWUtY29uc3VtZXJzLXNlZWstcGxlYXN1cmUtZmFjdG9yLWZ1dHVyZWJyYW5kLWluZGV4LTEyMzQ5MDcyODIv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LONDON — Consumers are now seeking the “pleasure factor” by investing in luxury items from the likes of LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, according to the FutureBrand Index 2021 published Wednesday by brand consultancy firm FutureBrand, a subsidiary of the Interpublic Group of Companies.

Unlike other studies, this annual index is not based on consumer research. Instead, it tracks PwC’s Global Top 100 Companies by market capitalization on perception strength rather than financial strength.

It finds that companies providing luxury goods or online shopping have been positively impacted by the pandemic, as consumer priorities and access shifted as a result of lockdowns.

The report said LVMH in particular has benefited from the events of the last 12 months, as it jumped 37 places from 66th to 29th in this year’s perception report. Online shopping giants Amazon and Alibaba also experienced a boost, rising 13 and 12 places, respectively.

Companies associated most strongly with a brick-and-mortar offering have suffered over the last 12 months, with the likes of Walmart Inc. and McDonald’s falling sharply down the index ranking.

At the same time, data shows that business-to-business companies have become household names. Tech and Pharma companies, which were seen lower down the 2020 list, such as ASML and Danaher, have surged forward as behind-the-scenes as society focuses on the innovation that will help the world come out of the pandemic.

Jon Tipple, global chief strategy officer at FutureBrand, said this year’s research has revealed “a huge shift in the way companies work and how they convey their mission to their consumers.”

“Those that look set to thrive in a post-pandemic world are companies prioritizing innovation to consistently impact individual well-being and drive change for good at scale….Consumers are also looking for the ‘feel good’ factor; in a period of 12 months when so much has been taken away from us, luxury brands like Apple and LVMH have done particularly well,” he added.

The top ten brands in the index are ASML Holdings, Apple, Prosus NV, Danaher Corp, NextEra Energy, TSMC, Kweichow Moutai, Ping an Insurance, Reliance Industries and Microsoft."
Why LVMH didn’t buy Brunello’s Banfi wine brand - The Drinks Business,"Mon, 20 Sep 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWRyaW5rc2J1c2luZXNzLmNvbS8yMDIxLzA5L3doeS1sdm1oLWRpZG50LWJ1eS1icnVuZWxsb3MtYmFuZmktd2luZS1icmFuZC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"News

By Patrick Schmitt

It was rumoured last year that LVMH was buying Brunello specialist Banfi wines, but the deal never happened – and we reveal why.

It would have been a brilliant fit for LVMH, a business that is gradually building its top-end wine portfolio and has a no Italian brand, let alone a revered Brunello estate such as Castello Banfi.

Banfi would have been great for LVMH: the Italian wine brand comes with a historic castle – a cornerstone for an authentic, luxury image that LVMH looks for in labels. Plus, Banfi has a vast, sustainably-managed estate – LVMH wants scalable premium brands with strong green credentials – and Banfi has a powerful presence in the US, a market where LVMH is looking to grow its footprint.

But the buyout never happened, and that’s the result of one person’s drive and vision – Banfi president Cristina Mariani-May, the daughter of John Mariani, who co-founded the Banfi wine brand in the 1978 with his brother Harry, following the purchase of the Poggio alle Mura estate in Montalcino, now called Castello Banfi.

Motivated by a desire to keep a major family involvement in the operation, which comprises the largest contiguous estate in Europe with almost 3,000 hectares – one third of which is planted with vines – Cristina decided not to sell Banfi to LVMH.

She admitted during an interview with db earlier this year that there were “discussions” with the luxury wine and spirits group, which, as reported by db back in February 2020, could see LVMH acquire the entire Banfi wine production business – an operation with a 7 million bottle output and a near €70m turnover (2018), which is fuelled by Montalcino’s Castello Banfi, along with estates in the Maremma, Bolgheri, Chianti, Chianti Classico and Piedmont.

Cristina also told db that she was in talks with LVMH because she needed to raise funds, commenting, “They [LVMH] were interested in Italy, and I was looking for capital.”

The reason why Cristina needed money concerned the way Banfi was structured – the company, like many family-owned businesses – had a number of shareholders, with different aims.

“The estate was split up between different family members and some people wanted their cash out, which is how family companies start to break apart,” she said, adding that this tends to start to occur with the third generation, of which she is a part (Banfi in fact began life in 1919 as a wine importer, when Cristina’s grandfather started bringing Italian wines to American consumers).

Moving forward 100 years to talks in 2019, LVMH could have provided the funds needed to buy out those family members who wanted to leave Banfi’s Italian wine making business, but at the same time, it would have seen Cristina and the family lose control of the estate.

As Cristina said, “They [LVMH] would normally take a majority shareholding, and then buy the rest out.”

Continuing, she recalled, “That didn’t sit well with me; I love this business, and I have children, and I want them to come into it.”

Continuing, she said that should LVMH take a stake in Banfi, it would take her away from influencing the strategic direction of the brand. “I didn’t want to be a figurehead, I wanted to be a businessman too, so I found another way out,” she recalled.

This other way out has seen Cristina secure the backing to become “the majority owner” of the Banfi estate, making her the leader of the Italian wine production side of the business (Banfi still has a separate US wine importing operation, Banfi Vintners, as well as two US wine brands: Washington State’s Pacific Rim Riesling and Oregon’s Rainstorm Pinot Noir).

Such a newly-strengthened position for Cristina has allowed her to take a “deeper focus” in the Italian property, which has meant “more investment” in the hospitality side of the business at Castello Banfi, where a 14th century castle houses a boutique hotel that’s now listed with Relais & Châteaux. Meanwhile, its restaurant has gained a Michelin star, and the Montalcino property now hosts an annual jazz festival.

The reason for a focus on tourism centres on Cristina’s belief in the power of experiential marketing for brand building, as well as her urge to educate consumers. She’s also driven by a desire to “give back” to the industry when it comes wine research, and appears especially wedded to Banfi’s foundation Sangue di Jove, which she describes as a “think tank on Sangiovese”.

Overall, such a change in ownership structure has given Cristina the opportunity to concentrate on Castello Banfi as a wine brand, a hospitality business and centre for Sangiovese research.

“We used to be distracted by tertiary brands and building other people’s brands [via the company’s US import business], but now we are more focused on the Banfi brand and getting it out there as the world opens up,” she said.

For this, she adds, “It is very important for me to have it privately held.”

Comparing the situation with fellow Brunello producer Biondi-Santi, which sold a controlling stake in 2017 to EPI, the owners of the Charles and Piper-Heidsieck Champagne brands, Cristina said, “While the family are still at the estate, Biondi-Santi is owned by a private equity group.”

“We have the largest contiguous estate in Europe, and we want to protect it,” she said.

“It’s a conservative approach, but one that’s right for my family,” she concluded.

LVMH Executives Resign From Carrefour Board - Yahoo Finance,"Tue, 07 Sep 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9sdm1oLWV4ZWN1dGl2ZXMtcmVzaWduLWNhcnJlZm91ci1ib2FyZC0xMDM5MDI3NzUuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS — LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton executives Alexandre Arnault and Nicolas Bazire have resigned from the board of Carrefour, following French billionaire Bernard Arnault’s decision to sell his stake in the French retailer, Carrefour said on Tuesday.

Alexandre Arnault, the second-eldest son of the LVMH chairman and chief executive officer, had joined the board in 2019. He has since been appointed as executive vice president of products and communications at U.S. jeweler Tiffany & Co.

Bazire is a member of LVMH’s executive committee, in charge of development and acquisitions. His mandate as an independent board member of Carrefour was renewed earlier this year for three years, despite opposition from some shareholders and union representatives over his jail sentence in the Karachi Affair, which he is appealing.

During its meeting on Tuesday, the Carrefour board co-opted Arthur Sadoun, chairman and CEO of communications firm Publicis Groupe, as an independent member for the remainder of Bazire’s term. The decision will be submitted for ratification at the next Carrefour shareholders’ meeting.

“I would like to warmly thank Alexandre Arnault and Nicolas Bazire for their active contribution to the work of the board and for their essential contribution to the transformation of the group,” Carrefour chairman and CEO Alexandre Bompard said in a statement.

“I am delighted by the addition to the board of Arthur Sadoun, whose international profile, experience in business transformation and digital expertise will be valuable assets to accelerate the execution of our strategic plan,” he added.

Nensi Dojaka Wins the LVMH Prize for Young Designers - WWD,"Tue, 07 Sep 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3dkLmNvbS9mYXNoaW9uLW5ld3MvZmFzaGlvbi1mZWF0dXJlcy9uZW5zaS1kb2pha2Etd2lucy0yMDIxLWx2bWgtcHJpemUteW91bmctZGVzaWduZXJzLTEyMzQ5MTA5Njkv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS — Nensi Dojaka on Tuesday won the 2021 edition of the LVMH Prize for Young Designers at a star-studded ceremony in Paris, marking the physical return of the prestigious award after last year’s final was canceled due to the coronavirus pandemic.

An Albanian women’s wear designer based in London, Dojaka is known for her lingerie-inspired slipdresses with graphic cutouts and sensual strap details, whose fans include Bella Hadid. The Central Saint Martins graduate is preparing to stage her first physical runway show on Sept. 17 during London Fashion Week.

French actress Isabelle Huppert revealed the winner at the Louis Vuitton Foundation in the presence of jury members including Dior’s Kim Jones; Virgil Abloh of Louis Vuitton; Stella McCartney; Marc Jacobs, and Loewe artistic director Jonathan Anderson.

Dior’s Maria Grazia Chiuri took part in the deliberations, but left before the ceremony, while Vuitton women’s wear designer Nicolas Ghesquière was unable to attend.

London-based Dojaka beat some 1,900 applicants from 110 countries to walk away with a grand prize of 300,000 euros, plus a year of coaching from experts at luxury giant LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, parent of brands including Vuitton, Guerlain, Dom Pérignon and Sephora.

“Thank you so much. I wasn’t expecting it at all,” the emotional designer said as she accepted the award.

Jacobs said the jury unanimously voted for Dojaka. “That has never happened as long as I can remember,” said the U.S designer, who has been a member of the jury since the prize’s inception in 2014.

“She did a very good presentation. Her product is very original with a unique point of view,” said Delphine Arnault, the force behind the prize and a key talent scout at family-controlled LVMH. “The quality is extremely good, and she’s very humble. We found her very moving. She’s terrific.”

Jones said he was won over by the sophistication of the line. “You can see the owning of a category, and the development that you could potentially do with that. I don’t know any woman that wouldn’t want to wear her dress and feel good,” he said.

“Her little black dress kind of won us over. It can be a new classic,” Abloh concurred.

McCartney said that as a juror, she was looking for creativity and a sense of sustainable work. “I think that she has both of those elements. For me, it’s very signature, I recognize her work immediately, which I think is very rare in the industry,” she said.

“I love that it’s a woman dressing women, obviously, but I think that she has a massive opportunity ahead of her, and with the platform and the mentoring and the money, I think that her brand really has a future,” McCartney added.

The jury had a harder time deciding the winner of the Karl Lagerfeld Special Jury Prize.

Following a spirited debate over lunch with LVMH chairman and chief executive officer Bernard Arnault – immortalized by McCartney with a selfie – they gave the award to three talents: KidSuper designer Colm Dillane; China’s Rui Zhou, the designer behind the genderless Rui label, and Lukhanyo Mdingi from South Africa.

Brooklyn-based Dillane’s artist collective burst onto the Paris scene last year when he made his virtual debut at Paris Men’s Fashion Week with a stop-motion short film made using modified Barbie dolls dressed in miniature versions of his streetwear designs.

He lugged his collection over to Paris in cardboard boxes that he checked in as excess luggage. “It was hilarious,” he said of his typically improvised arrangement.

Mdingi has shown his women’s and men’s wear at New York Fashion Week and as part of the Pitti Uomo trade show. As part of a partnership with the Ethical Fashion Initiative, he has expanded production to Kenya and Burkina Faso.

“There’s a certain kind of hybrid that we’re trying to create between artisanal craft and something that’s also quite modern and refined,” he said. “You’re providing opportunities for work, but the exchange they give back to our label is a beautiful sense of integrity and honesty that man-made machines don’t always necessarily have.”

Zhou’s intricate, web-like bodysuits and dresses bare as much as they cover. Small knit segments are stretched out and tethered with beads, creating unique geometries of fabric and flesh. Based in Shanghai, the 27-year-old designer graduated in 2018 from Parsons MFA Fashion Design and Society program.

Each will benefit from a grant of 150,000 euros and a one-year mentorship program from the LVMH Group.

“I’ve always believed that the power of a collective is far greater than that of a singular, and I think this prize is testimony to that,” Mdingi said in his acceptance speech. “We actually should start a WhatsApp group,” he suggested to his fellow winners afterward.

Dillane made history by swearing during the ceremony, which was broadcast live on LVMH’s YouTube channel and a dedicated website, lvmhprize.com. “We really are f—king awesome,” he exclaimed.

The most openly competitive of this year’s finalists, the former soccer player said he wasn’t disappointed at having to share the prize.

“It feels good to be a part of it, and I understand the different brands, you know what I mean? Like, I respect each of them, and there’s no competition,” he explained. “I think all of us come from outside Paris Fashion Week and Paris fashion, so just being able to have those conversations is crazy.”

The LVMH Prize is open to designers under age 40 who have presented and sold at least two collections of women’s, men’s or unisex ready-to-wear.

It has previously been awarded to Thebe Magugu — who won the 2019 edition; Doublet, Marine Serre, Grace Wales Bonner, Marques’ Almeida and Thomas Tait. It has also boosted the careers of its runner-up special-prize winners, which include Rokh, Jacquemus and Hood by Air.

Last year, the top prize of 300,000 euros was divided equally among eight finalists.

After taking part in a digital showroom in April, the nine finalists of the 2021 edition were able to travel to Paris to present their collections to the judges in person, with some quarantining for up to 10 days in order to be physically present at the event.

Due to ongoing sanitary restrictions, only a handful of editors were in attendance, stripping the event of some of its usual buzz. Guests had to present proof of vaccination and undergo another COVID-19 test on arrival.

After the ceremony, Abloh rushed over to comfort the five designers who were leaving empty-handed. He recalled that as a finalist of the prize in 2015, he had dealt with a similar sense of disappointment.

“I was here, and I thought everything was riding on winning, right? And no one had told me that you’ve already won. And I’m not saying it as a consolation. Legitimately, you’re recognized by the most passionate people,” he told Bianca Saunders, Charles de Vilmorin, Christopher John Rogers, Conner Ives and Kika Vargas.

“Realize that you’ve won – it doesn’t feel like it – but that your message is heard,” he continued, promising to share his contact details with every participant. “This is a group that supports talent. The prize was for you to come here. This is not the end of the journey.”

Dojaka plans to use the prize money to expand her team, noting she could use help with production as she recently began working with a new factory in Italy and using more sustainable fabrics. “I’m also going to expand a bit the offering that I bring, so I will do more accessories and make the brand a bit more whole,” she said.

“When I started, I had a very young customer base, and now with the collection developing with a bit more tailoring and stronger looks, it’s shifting a bit, so it’s a wider audience and I want to make it a lot more versatile. Now, I will have even more opportunity to develop stuff,” she added.

After showcasing her graduate collection in 2019, Dojaka created a capsule collection with Ssense and was selected to show as part of emerging designer support platform Fashion East.

She was selected for the first edition of the mentorship program launched last fall by No.21 founder and designer Alessandro Dell’Acqua and Tomorrow London, and now has 30 points of sale across the world, including MyTheresa and Matchesfashion.

Though she did not expect to win given this year’s stiff competition, the designer felt her presentation went well. “While doing it, I gained a bit of confidence as well, and that’s because they were so nice. The questions asked were quite thought-provoking as well, so I think it was a good little session,” she reported.

“One of the questions was about, for example, the hanger appeal of the clothes, which is something that I always want to think about and something that is very important for the sales,” she said. “I came from a lingerie background. Because of that, I pay a lot of attention to smaller details, so I think this was the point of difference.”

In town with her father and boyfriend, Dojaka planned to attend a party on Tuesday night with the other prize participants before rushing back to London. “I can’t celebrate because I have to finish the collection for the show. Now I feel even more pressure that it has to be really good,” she said.

The tenure of the Japanese streetwear icon and Bathing Ape and Human Made founder – who will fill the top creative role that was left vacant following Felipe Oliveria Baptista’s departure this spring – coincides with the impending arrival of new CEO Sylvain Blanc. Taken together, the two new appointments will undoubtedly result in a sweeping revamp of the 51-year-old fashion brand that has been itching for a boost of relevance since even-earlier creative directors (and Opening Ceremony founders) Humberto Leon and Carol Lim cemented the modern status of the brand with their trademark $500 tiger-emblazoned sweatshirt that sold like hot cakes and dominated style blogs and street-style photos beginning in 2012.

With Leon and Lim (and their prowess for perfectly tapping into the zeitgeist) out of the picture at Kenzo since mid-2019, LVMH is without-a-doubt looking to Nigo to help reinvent the brand that the late Kenzo Takada launched in 1970 for current consumers. Given LVMH’s overarching push to consistently modernize its brands in order to reach younger consumers, including more recently, those who have a penchant for streetwear and hard-to-get collaborations, the appointment makes sense. Not only does Nigo have a track record of creating products – including Bathing Ape’s shark hoodies, signature camouflage wares, and BAPE STA sneakers – that have enjoyed longtime demand, garnered a cult following of their own, and presumably generated high margins, he has a long list of collaborators, such as Virgil Abloh and Louis Vuitton, adidas, Pharrell, Pepsi, Lil Uzi Vert, and Kanye West, among others.

Beyond that, the appointment makes sense in light of the fact that Kenzo has significant room for revenue growth and is ripe for an overhaul. As of 2019, the brand was reportedly generating less than €400 million ($472 million), making it a smaller entity under the French luxury goods conglomerate’s umbrella. It is unclear how much Kenzo’s sales improved during Mr. Baptista’s two years at the helm, as LVMH does not break out individual figures for its smaller houses. The group did name-check the brand in its 2019 full-year report, stating that Kenzo “continued its growth, strengthened its positioning in ready-to-wear with designs mixing bold prints and high-impact hallmarks, and stood out in accessories with the launch of [Leon and Lim’s] Tali bag.” LVMH made no significant mention of Kenzo in its annual report in 2020 or for the first half of 2021, aside from references to its fragrance offerings.

Chances are, Nigo, who is a bona fide pioneer of modern fashion, is the jolt that the brand needs to grow on the apparel and accessories front (and I will be surprised if he does not venture into the metaverse and virtual fashion realm) in order to reach the level of sales of some other LVMH-owned houses.

“I am proud to have been appointed Artistic Director of KENZO. I was born in the year that Takada Kenzo san opened his first store in Paris. We both graduated from the same fashion school in Tokyo. In 1993, the year that KENZO joined the LVMH Group, I started my career in Fashion,” Nigo said in a statement on Wednesday.

Sidney Toledano, who serves as the Chairman and CEO of Louis Vuitton, hailed the appointment, stating, “The arrival of an extremely talented Japanese designer will allow us to write a new page in the history of the House that Takada Kenzo founded. I am convinced that the creativity and innovation of Nigo, as well as his attachment to the history of the House, will fully express all the potential of KENZO.”

The news comes on the heels of LVMH revealing in July that in addition to taking a 60 percent stake in upscale fashion/streetwear brand Off-White, it has entered into a new “arrangement” with Abloh to “jointly pursue new projects across luxury categories.” LVMH asserted at the time that the new partnership will “leverage the Group’s expertise to launch new brands and partner with existing ones in a variety of sectors beyond the realm of fashion,” with initial discussions already underway, according to the French luxury goods conglomerate.

Nigo’s tenure officially starts on September 20, while new CEO Sylvain Blanc joins Kenzo on October 18."
Miami Design District Shoppers Boost LVMH Earnings - The Real Deal,"Wed, 08 Sep 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vdGhlcmVhbGRlYWwuY29tL21hZ2F6aW5lL25hdGlvbmFsLXNlcHRlbWJlci0yMDIxL21ha2luZy1pdC1yYWluLWluLW1pYW1pcy1kZXNpZ24tZGlzdHJpY3Qv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Bernard Arnault briefly dethroned Amazon’s Jeff Bezos as the richest man in the world last month. The ascent of LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton’s chairman and CEO was propelled by mind-blowing company revenue of $34 billion for the first half of the year, allowing Arnault to climb atop the ranking of the wealthiest billionaires for the third time since 2019 before settling back into third place behind Bezos and Elon Musk.

LVMH’s strong performance — while the world is still in the throes of the pandemic — serves as affirmation that luxury retail shopping is on an upswing, especially for the company’s established brands such as Louis Vuitton, Christian Dior and Fendi — and particularly in Miami.

The Miami Design District is a hotbed of escalating consumer demand for high-end fashion goods. There, the LVMH-backed private equity firm L Catterton and its partners, real estate investment firms Dacra and Brookfield Property Partners, own a significant portfolio of properties that lease storefronts to LVMH brands and other luxury retailers.

When Florida lifted most of its restrictions to curb the spread of Covid last summer, the Design District quickly rebounded. That performance has accelerated Arnault’s and LVMH’s gamble that a neighborhood once known for furniture and interior design showrooms could morph into one of the globe’s top high-end retail streets, according to commercial brokers and the neighborhood’s chief developer, Miami-based Dacra President and CEO Craig Robins.

Robins said he couldn’t comment on specific tenants, but that the Design District’s luxury retailers in general have experienced exponential foot traffic and sales growth over the past 12 months. Some tenants are planning to enlarge their footprint in the district, Robins added.

“A very significant number of our large, successful luxury tenants, and several of our contemporary tenants, have reached out and committed to significant expansions or are negotiating them,” he said. “Even though they already have large global flagships here, they want the ability to have a larger display of their complete offerings.”

Influx of high rollers

The Design District benefited from the influx of wealthy people escaping lockdowns in such states as New York and California, as well as entrepreneurs, executives and workers from across the country who are taking advantage of remote employment, Robins said.

“People in Miami didn’t travel, so they focused their spending here. And then we had an incredible season of people permanently moving to Miami,” he said. “Having a beautiful, spectacular open-air environment lent itself to a perfect solution. By the end of 2020, our traffic and sales were up, and that’s continued through this summer.”

Tony Arellano, co-founder and principal of DWNTWN Realty Advisors, which represents other landlords and developers in the Design District, said the daily lines of customers outside Louis Vuitton, Christian Dior, Fendi and Celine are evidence that those LVMH stores had a meaningful impact on the French conglomerate’s strong performance during the first six months of the year.

“It’s not only in sales revenue,” Arellano said. “The real estate value of the Design District became minted. It is a multibillion-dollar neighborhood at this point. LVMH definitely made revenue from the stores, but its real estate shot to the moon.”

Arellano said asking rents reflect the strong performance of stores in the Design District. “Asking rents for prime locations range from $200 a square foot, triple net, to more than $400 a square foot,” Arellano said. “Those rates could easily double as the neighborhood continues to season and there is less inventory.”

L Catterton, Dacra and Brookfield’s holdings

The L Catterton, Dacra and Brookfield partnership owns close to half a million square feet , consisting of 15 buildings known as Oak Plaza, in the Design District. Debt service and reserve payments that were due in May, June and July on a 10-year, $500 million loan from Bank of America were deferred to allow the landlords to provide Covid-related concessions to Oak Plaza tenants, according to a March 10 report by DBRS Morningstar.

“Oak Plaza is well positioned to return to its strong pre-pandemic performance, given the high-quality, luxury nature of the retail tenancy and targeted clientele, coupled with experienced long-term institutional sponsorship,” the report states. “As of year-end 2019, the property generated over $231 million in total sales, representing over $1,000 per square foot for tenants that report sales.”

Still, Oak Plaza felt the sting of the pandemic, according to DBRS. Since March 2020, eight non-LVMH tenants moved out, increasing the overall vacancy rate to 11.5 percent. And the landlords provided $9.6 million in rent abatements and concessions, the report states. The deferments are scheduled to end later this year and must be repaid by the end of 2023.

“The property is likely to continue to experience stress in the short and medium term until the pandemic fully abates, the economy recovers and international travel resumes,” the report states. “While DBRS Morningstar does not view these issues as an imminent threat to the property’s survival given the luxury nature of its tenancy, the long-term headwinds in the retail sector are likely to persist even after the coronavirus pandemic abates.”

Spokespersons for L Catterton and LVMH did not respond to requests for comment.

Keeping shoppers in Miami

Greg Masin, a senior director in Cushman & Wakefield’s Miami office, said that the Design District has bounced back considerably since the DBRS report came out thanks to more high rollers and big-money spenders who have relocated to South Florida. “The LVMH core customer is present for a greater degree of time in Miami,” Masin said. “The person that came down two, three times a year is now down here for 180 days.”

Arnault and LVMH should be pleased with the Miami Design District’s performance, Masin added. “I would be very surprised if they weren’t happy with the performance of most of their brands,” he said. “In some cases, they are exceeding expectations.”

Dacra’s Robins said he is conservatively optimistic that the Design District’s momentum will continue, even if people who relocated to South Florida return to their home states when the pandemic completely subsides.

“With the amount of new leasing that is taking place and the new businesses that have opened, those are indicators that this growth is long term,” he said. “I’m focused on [enhancing] an appealing environment and [do] not assume that how well we’re doing the past six months will automatically continue.”"
LVMH Prize Jury Sorely Lacks Diversity - Jing Daily,"Mon, 06 Sep 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiOmh0dHBzOi8vamluZ2RhaWx5LmNvbS9wb3N0cy9sdm1oLXByaXplLWtpbS1qb25lcy1kaXZlcnNpdHnSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"What happened

The LVMH Prize 2021 announced artistic director of the women’s collections at Fendi, Kim Jones, as the newest member to join its all-star panel, which already includes Virgil Abloh, Jonathan Anderson, Maria Grazia Chiuri, Marc Jacobs, Stella McCartney, Delphine Arnault, Sidney Toledano, and Jean-Paul Claverie.

Chinese designer Rui Zhou is one of the finalists of the eighth edition of the LVMH Prize for Young Designers alongside Bianca Saunders, Charles de Vilmorin, Conner Ives, Kidsuper, Kika Vargas, Lukhanyo Mdingi, and Nensi Dojaka. The final competition takes place on September 7 at the Louis Vuitton Foundation in Paris, where the winners will be awarded €300,000 (355,6000).

The Jing Take

The LVMH Prize is one of the most anticipated and prestigious competitions in the fashion industry. However, the jurying panel continues to show little diversity or newness. Not only do the members all come from previous editions, but the board also lacks cultural representation. There is no Asian panelist, and only one out of nine jury members is a person of color.

The Prize reveals a deep-rooted issue in fashion circles (a Eurocentric mentality), which won’t go away anytime soon. Yet, some progress has been made. For instance, this was the first year that a Chinese designer made it to the finals. Moreover, the British Fashion Council just announced its new partnership with 50:50 The Equality Project, an initiative launched by the BBC to fairly represent its audience and better reflect the world around us. Efforts from institutions and the rise of voices from non-white communities like the #BlackLivesMatter and #StopAsianHate movements have led to inclusion and diversity improvements in an industry dominated by white people.

That said, more must be done to give global talents equal opportunities to affirm their labels on the international stage. And LVMH, the influential leader in luxury fashion, should be responsible for setting an example.

"French luxury group LVMH seeks 25,000 young staff in recruitment drive - Yahoo Finance","Wed, 22 Sep 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9mcmVuY2gtbHV4dXJ5LWdyb3VwLWx2bWgtc2Vla3MtMTU0NDI5NTQwLmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS (Reuters) - LVMH aims to hire 25,000 people under 30 years of age by the end of 2022, the French luxury behemoth said on Wednesday, as it accelerates recruitment to meet brisk demand for high end goods.

The European luxury sector has seen a fast pace of growth in recent months, as stores reopened following lockdown periods and consumers drew on money saved during periods of confinement to splash out on pricey goods.

LVMH has more than recovered business lost to pandemic disruptions. In July, it reported first half sales grew 11 percent on an organic basis compared to the same period in 2019, before the crisis hit, fuelled by demand for clothing and accessories from its star fashion labels Louis Vuitton and Dior.

The company’s focus on recruiting younger staff comes as it seeks to bolster the popularity of its brands with younger consumers, weaving streetwear styles like cargo pants and sneakers into its luxury fashion collections.

The hiring target for the upcoming year marks an acceleration of around 20 percent compared to previous years, according to Chantal Gaemperle, director of human resources and synergies at LVMH.

The group intends to use various methods to recruit younger staff, including drawing on a company training institute in France and other countries that is focused on design, crafts and sales techniques. It plans to expand training, which covers areas such as pastry baking and vineyard techniques, and further roll out the teaching in countries including Italy, Spain, Germany and Japan.

Seeking to broaden and diversify its recruitment further still, LVMH is opening a public online training platform and says it has forged partnerships in under-privileged areas in France to recruit high school students for apprenticeships. The group said it expects to grant 2,500 long-term contracts in France along with 5,000 internships in the country, but did not provide further details on the expected geographic breakdown of its hiring plan.

LVMH's Kenzo Names Nigo as Its New Designer - The Business of Fashion,"Wed, 15 Sep 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzb2ZmYXNoaW9uLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy9sdXh1cnkvbHZtaHMta2Vuem8tbmFtZXMtbmlnby1hcy1pdHMtbmV3LWRlc2lnbmVyL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Nigo, the Japanese streetwear entrepreneur who founded A Bathing Ape, has been named the new artistic director of Kenzo, parent company LVMH said in a statement Wednesday. He succeeds Felipe Oliveira Baptista, the former Lacoste designer who left the brand in June.

Nigo attended Bunka Fashion College in Tokyo (the same school attended by brand founder Kenzo Takada) and started A Bathing Ape in 1993. Also known as “Bape,” the label became a pioneering force in streetwear — marrying relaxed, graphic styles with the hype factor of hard-to-find limited runs.

After Nigo sold the brand to Hong Kong’s I.T. group in 2011, he went on to launch two labels with singer Pharell (Billionaire Boys Club and Ice Cream), designed Uniqlo’s UT range, and collaborated with Adidas through his more recent label, Human Made. Virgil Abloh tapped Nigo for his first and only collaboration as menswear director of Louis Vuitton.

Nigo “changed the landscape of global street culture,” LVMH’s statement said. “He has innovated new ways for fashion to relate to its audience that have since become industry standards.”

At Kenzo, Nigo will be charged with reviving a brand which has a catchy name and prime retail locations, but whose business, driven by logo tees and tiger-embroidered sweatshirts, has been cooling off.

LVMH has also named a new chief executive, Sylvain Blanc, to work alongside Nigo, according to an internal announcement seen by BoF. Blanc, who has been CEO of French intimates brand Undiz since 2018 and previously worked at The Kooples, is a graduate of two top French engineering schools, including Bernard Arnault’s alma mater, the École Polytechnique.

During his two-year stint at the brand, Nigo’s predecessor Oliveira Baptista attempted to revive the original codes of Kenzo Takada, who died last October of complications following Covid-19. The Japanese-born designer was known for relaxed, colourful creations and nomadic references, and his designs were a fixture of ‘70s and ‘80s nightlife, sported by the likes of Grace Jones and Iman.

But the pandemic was bad timing for the roll-out of a couture-infused repositioning. With the nomination of Nigo, LVMH seems to be looking back to a more recent period of success, when the brand grew steadily for several years fuelled by a streetwear-inspired premium concept under the creative direction of Opening Ceremony’s Humberto Leon and Carol Lim.

While LVMH’s top-end, accessories-driven houses like Christian Dior and Louis Vuitton have seen sales come roaring back above pre-pandemic levels during the last year, Kenzo isn’t the only one of its smaller units under pressure to reposition its design and strategy.

In the past year LVMH’s Fashion Group (the conglomerate’s group of smaller brands overseen by former Dior CEO Sidney Toledano) also named a new designer for Pucci, sold Nicholas Kirkwood shoes and Thomas Pink shirting, and discontinued its Rihanna-helmed Fenty fashion start-up.

From Rocha's new designer Charles de Vilmorin to London's Bianca Saunders to Christopher John Rogers, the jury had a tough task at hand (Jonathan Anderson, Stella McCartney, Kim Jones — basically most of the LVMH creative directors).

The winner turned out to be 27-year-old Nensi Dojaka, whose ultra-feminine design vocabulary of sheer fabrics and asymmetric shapes have cemented her as one to watch over the past year. ""Her sensual and tailored fashion breaks with the conventions of womenswear, combining confidence and style,"" said LVMH's Delphine Arnault of Dojaka's win.

She'll also be a part of luxury retailer MatchesFashion's Innovators Programme, an annual initiative that offers each class year-long support including mentorship, preferential business terms and a £2.2 million investment in marketing support across brands. Read on to learn more about the emerging designer.

She's an Albanian Native and Based in London See on Instagram

Dojaka was born in Tirana, Albania. She moved to the UK for high school in 2009. Growing up, dhe had a love for art but was unable to see any exhibitsor museums that were close to her. So she made her own drawings with abstract puzzle-like shapes that reflect her deconstructed work seen today.

Her Inspiration Comes from Collecting '90s Fashion Magazines See on Instagram

""The minimalist, industrial nature of the '90s felt raw and honest,"" she told Vogue, citing the era's focus on detail, as well as the juxtaposition of feminine and masculine, as constants sources of inspiration. The brand's aesthetic has many mirrors to the minimalism found in Helmut Lang, Ann Demeulemeester, and Alessandro Dell'acqua — all of whom Dojaka cites as designers she admires.

She Started Her Label While Studying at the London College of Fashion See on Instagram

After completing her BA in 2017, Dojaka started the foundation of her collection. She graduated afterwards from the prestigious Central Saint Martins — known to churn out legends such as Alexander McQueen and Riccardo Tisci. She told Forbes that she chose the program because it ""revolves around your identity as a designer and getting to the root of that. It brings out what is unique about your approach.""

SSENSE Was the First Major Retailer to Carry Dojaka’s Work See on Instagram

Her BA graduate collection caught the eye of the Canadian luxury retailer, who gravitated towards her distorted female body exploration and deconstructed attire. Her smartly placed asymmetrical triangular sheer fabric pieces and minuscule straps have become a signature for blurring the lines between lingerie and clothing.

She's Already Dressed Bella Hadid, Emily Ratajkowski and Kaia Gerber See on Instagram

At the 2020 VMAs, Hadid turned heads when she arrived in one of Dojaka's sheer sinuous dresses on the red carpet. The occasion marked Dojaka's foray into tailoring, as she is known to typically drape her looks from scratch onto mannequins. The look immediately sold out on SSENSE soon afterward and helped put the emerging designer on the map. Her black minidress made Lyst's hottest products of 2021."

"Henkel, L'Oréal, LVMH, Natura &Co, Unilever forming consortium for cosmetics environmental impact system - CosmeticsDesign-Europe.com","Mon, 20 Sep 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMinQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jb3NtZXRpY3NkZXNpZ24tZXVyb3BlLmNvbS9BcnRpY2xlLzIwMjEvMDkvMjAvSGVua2VsLUwtT3JlYWwtTFZNSC1OYXR1cmEtQ28tVW5pbGV2ZXItZm9ybWluZy1jb25zb3J0aXVtLWZvci1jb3NtZXRpY3MtZW52aXJvbm1lbnRhbC1pbXBhY3Qtc3lzdGVt0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The group of five international beauty and personal care majors wanted to establish the consortium – open to all cosmetic companies to join – to co-design an industry-wide “brand-agnostic”​ way of assessing and scoring environmental impact, built around a science-based methodology. The aim was to provide consumers “clear, transparent and comparable”​ information that considered a beauty product’s entire life cycle.

A ‘robust and scientific approach’ to environmental impact assessment​

The founding companies said they would pool their respective expertise and experiences to co-create the new voluntary environmental impact system for the global cosmetics industry, alongside the expertise of others that joined as well as that of sustainability consultancy Quantis – “to ensure a robust and scientific approach”​.

The voluntary system would be built around four key principles: a common method for measuring environmental impacts throughout product life cycle; a common database of environmental impacts for standard ingredients and raw materials; a common tool to calculate environmental impact per product; and a harmonised scoring system that enabled easy comparison for consumers.

Importantly, the beauty majors said the methodology, data base, tool and scoring system would be “verified by independent parties” ​and external scientists, academics and NGOs would be consulted throughout the process to “ensure the ongoing integrity of the approach”.​

“…The work developed by the consortium will be published and made accessible on a strictly voluntary basis by both consortium participants and all other interested parties,” ​Henkel, L’Oréal, LVMH, Natura &Co and Unilever said.

‘Growing consumer demand’ for beauty transparency ​

The founding companies said the move to establish such a consortium, and ultimately a new environmental impact system, was particularly timely as consumer interest in sustainability garnered power.

“The new assessment and scoring system will aim to meet growing consumer demand for greater transparency about the environmental impact of cosmetic products – formula, packaging and usage. The objective is to improve the information that is available to consumers and enable them to make more sustainable consumption choices,”​ they said.

Earlier this year, L’Oréal CEO Nicolas Hieronimus said consumers now expected ​“full transparency​ from brands and companies”,​ heightened by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and digital boom. Jenni Middleton, director of beauty at trend forecasting specialist WGSN, agreed and said complete transparency would be “non-negotiable”​ in beauty by 2023​, requiring “progressive transformation” ​from every part of industry.

Speaking in an online webinar in March 2021, WWF senior partnership development manager Daniel Murray said now was certainly the time for beauty brands to ‘galvanise’ rising consumer engagement in sustainability​.

“Consumers really want to be empowered and feel responsible and feel they can have an impact that’s tangible and meaningful. But that needs to be allowed and given to them,” ​Murray said.

Engaging ‘all’ to create a ‘cross-industry pooling of knowledge and expertise’​

Henkel, L’Oréal, LVMH, Natura &Co and Unilever now wanted to onboard as many cosmetics companies worldwide to the consortium as possible, to collectively build the “pursuit” ​towards a global system.

“This global initiative is intended to be open to all cosmetic companies, regardless of their size or resources,” ​they said.

Philippe Osset, expert life cycle assessment consultant for the European Commission and the French Standardization Association AFNOR, said it was certainly possible for the cosmetics sector to build a scientific environmental impact assessment of their products, as had been demonstrated in other sectors already.

“It requires a cross-industry pooling of knowledge and expertise, particularly concerning the environmental impact data; this is exactly what the consortium founding members are embarking on,”​ Osset said.

European trade association Cosmetics Europe had already been actively following the process to build this consortium and other trade associations were being invited to join. Interested companies or associations were being asked to email pbagnpg@rpbornhglfpber-pbafbegvhz.bet​."

The global luxury conglomerate has been steadily expanding its portfolio over the years and recently launched its wildly successful, billion-dollar mall, La Samaritaine. The long-awaited department store opened its doors a few weeks ago and quickly became known as the most luxurious mall in the world housing LVMH’s countless brands. The mall itself is already a huge tourist attraction, but LVMH wants to solidify its presence in the first arrondissement with even grander ventures—a hotel.



Located right next to LVMH’s La Samaritaine is LVMH’s Cheval Blanc Paris, which just opened its doors. The ultra-luxury hotel matches the vibes of the designer stores next door as it costs $1,500 to stay just one night in Paris’ latest posh establishment. The 72-room hotel is the epitome of top-tier hospitality, featuring a 100-foot infinity pool in the lower levels and a 41-foot pool for the VIPs who book the top floor's 11,000 square foot penthouse. Other amenities of the hotel include four five-star restaurants led by some of Paris’ culinary masterminds, and a private hotel elevator leading to the luxury department store next door.

Unlike the growing contemporary trend of Parisian hotels, Cheval Blanc Paris stands by its quintessentially French tastes despite its modern touches. One reason for this is its purely French backers—LVMH and the Arnaults. While more and more hotels in the heart of France are run by the ultra-rich of China and the Middle East, Cheval Blanc Paris bleeds French, from its Parfums Christian Dior beauty amenities to the Tiffany & Co gems lining the windows.

Dripping in six-star luxury, Cheval Blanc Paris pays homage to the city’s ‘20s era with an Art Deco theme accompanied by the priceless art decorating common rooms and hallways.

Like La Samaritaine, Cheval Blanc Paris was decades in the making, with architect Peter Marino hiring almost 600 artisans to bring the building to life.

With all of its glamor, the best thing about Cheval Blanc Paris is something priceless altogether—its coveted location along the Seine that gives almost every room of the hotel a view that its competitors would die for. With the Seine on one side and the Louvre on the other, La Samaritaine and Cheval Blanc Paris are positioning themselves as the new center of luxury in Paris.

Nigo is the first Japanese designer to helm Kenzo since its founder, Kenzo Takada. Best known as the founder of streetwear brand A Bathing Ape, will join the brand on September 20th and will unveil his debut collection in 2022.

“I am proud to have been appointed Artistic Director of Kenzo. I was born in the year that Takada Kenzo san opened his first store in Paris. We both graduated from the same fashion school in Tokyo. In 1993, the year that Kenzo joined the LVMH Group, I started my career in Fashion. Kenzo san’s approach to creating originality was through his understanding of many different cultures. It is also the essence of my own philosophy of creativity. Inheriting the spirit of Kenzo san’s craftsmanship to create a new Kenzo is the greatest challenge of my 30-year career, which I intend to achieve together with the team. Finally, I would like to thank Bernard Arnault and Sidney Toledano for giving me this wonderful opportunity”, says Nigo.

Nigo started his first independent clothing label in Tokyo in 1993 and went on to change the landscape of global street culture. Working simultaneously in the worlds of fashion and music, with acute sensitivity to detail and through frequent collaboration with some of the best known companies and creative individuals in the world, he has innovated new ways for fashion to relate to its audience that have since become industry standards. In 2020, he produced a magnificent capsule with Virgil Abloh for Louis Vuitton.

“I am very happy to welcome Nigo as the Artistic Director of the Maison Kenzo. The arrival of an extremely talented Japanese designer will allow us to write a new page in the history of the House that Takada Kenzo founded. I am convinced that the creativity and innovation of Nigo as well as his attachment to the history of the House will fully express all the potential of Kenzo”, says Sidney Toledano, Chairman and CEO of the LVMH Fashion Group."
Cheval Blanc Paris: Inside LVMH's luxurious new hotel – Luxury London - Luxury London,"Thu, 16 Sep 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vbHV4dXJ5bG9uZG9uLmNvLnVrL3RyYXZlbC9pbnRlcm5hdGlvbmFsL2NoZXZhbC1ibGFuYy1uZXctbHZtaC1ob3RlbC1pbi1wYXJpcy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The luxury travel market is growing – according to Business Wire, it is set to expand by $1.2 billion between 2021 and 2025.

Fashion brands are increasingly looking to get a slice of the pie: Versace, Bulgari, Armani, Christian Lacroix, Ralph Lauren and Dior are just a few examples of many that have put their names to luxury hotels, residences or resorts. The logic behind these investments is a halo effect – if you love the clothes, bags, and jewellery, why wouldn’t you love the deluxe suite?

Always the early adopter, LVMH has been in on the action since 1998 when it launched Cheval Blanc. Named after a vineyard in Saint-Emilion owned by the luxury conglomerate, the first Maison was opened in the upscale ski resort of Courchevel in 2006. Cheval Blanc has since found homes in St Tropez, St-Barth Isle de France, Randheli, and now, Paris.

The first draw of the newest outpost is its enviable location – bang in the middle of the City of Light, facing the Left Bank and a stone’s throw from the Louvre and the Marais. Then there is the building itself: the iconic La Samaritaine, a former department store designed by Henri Sauvage in 1928, and fitting home for a hotel that boasts LVMH sister brands including Christian Dior, Givenchy and Celine.

The interior of this Art Deco bastion has been reimagined by Peter Marino, who has worked on boutiques for Louis Vuitton, Fendi and Chanel among others. His signature flourish of French savoir-faire is detectable in every trim, tile and texture – Marino has integrated French artistry as often as he can, commissioning more than 600 native artists from ceramists and sculptors to painters, textile designers, furniture makers and photographers. Unsurprisingly, LVMH brands are omnipresent, from uniforms designed by Patou to a Dior spa on the ground floor.

The spa is resplendent in textiles and homewares by the LVMH megabrand. Each of the six treatment rooms is individually themed: ‘Sauvage’, for example, has a table covered in alpha-quartz that appears to float. In ‘Bonne Étoile’, you look up at a ceiling adorned with light-up constellations. The spa also features a 30-metre swimming pool and a Rossano Ferretti Salon – we’re already predicting queues out-the-door come Paris Fashion Week.

Cheval Blanc Paris ticks all the requisite boxes when it comes to cuisine, too. There are four restaurants here: brasserie Le Tout-Paris resides on the seventh-floor, while Limbar is the hotel’s most casual eatery. Langosteria, the first to open outside of Milan, offers Italian fine dining. Finally, Plénitude is a crash course in French gastronomy run by three Michelin-starred chef Arnaud Donckele.

This is what is meant when people talk about elegance à la française – luxurious and painstakingly tasteful, yes – but also somehow confidential and exclusive.

LVMH and Kering Announcing New Initiatives at the IUCN World Conservation Congress - WWD,"Fri, 03 Sep 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3dkLmNvbS9mZWF0dXJlL2V4Y2x1c2l2ZS1rZXJpbmdzLXJlZ2VuZXJhdGl2ZS1mdW5kLWZvci1uYXR1cmUtbmFtZXMtZ3JhbnRlZXMtMTIzNDkwODI0NC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS — The IUCN World Conservation Congress, being held in Marseille, France, from Sept. 3 to 11, is uniting leading luxury companies, such as LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton and Kering, in announcing new initiatives.

At the congress, LVMH and UNESCO are joining forces again to protect biodiversity within the scope of the Man and Biosphere intergovernmental program. Antoine Arnault, head of image and environment at the French luxury group, and Audrey Azoulay, director general of UNESCO, will discuss the MAB actions during the opening ceremony and CEO summit, both held on Sept. 3.

Arnault will take part in a panel to discuss the topic “Enabling a Nature-Positive Future” alongside executives such as Alexandre Ricard, chairman and chief executive officer of Pernod Ricard, and Geoffroy Roux de Bézieux, president of the Mouvement des entreprises de France.

LVMH and its houses, along with UNESCO, are hosting a pavilion to present their initiatives at the congress. It’s divided into four areas, which highlight the LVMH-UNESCO partnership, which began in 2019; the work they’ve done to expedite solutions to manage natural resources sustainably; how they are taking concrete steps to ensure sustainable practices and balance biodiversity’s conservation with a sustainable use of resources, and their creation of new tools to conserve the planet and help people to better understand and respect other species.

LVMH is the sole private sector partner of MAB, which beyond the preservation of protected zones, sets out to establish best practices for sustainable development to help reach the U.N. Sustainable Development Goals.

UNESCO aims to enable humans to live in harmony with nature, which is in line with LVMH’s ambition to create a “new luxury” that allies nature and creativity, the company said in a statement on Friday. This includes a joint, five-year initiative, with 5 million euros in funding, to fight deforestation in Amazonia.

Through 2030, LVMH is rolling out regenerative programs for agricultural raw materials, including grapes, cotton, wool and leather. The company is also contributing to efforts to regenerate ecosystems and protect animal and plant species that are endangered — all part of the LVMH Initiatives for the Environment program, which sets targets for 2023, 2026 and 2030.

“Protecting natural ecosystems has always been an essential priority for LVMH, whose activities depend largely on natural raw materials, from flowers, grapes and cotton to leather and precious gemstones. The environmental policy first articulated by LVMH 27 years ago reflects this priority. The ‘ACT for Biodiversity’ partnership with UNESCO is a pillar that allows us to challenge the status quo and have a positive, long-term impact beyond our own supply chain to show that it is indeed possible to reconcile economic development and protecting nature,” said Arnault in the statement.

“We need to create new relationships with other living species. The partnership between UNESCO and LVMH aims to show that it is possible to balance economic development and protection of biodiversity without waiting,” continued Azoulay.

On Sept. 1, Arnault penned an op-ed piece in Les Echos newspaper, in which he wrote: “Every stakeholder, whether institutional or political, will benefit from calculating the natural capital they can borrow without exceeding global limits. To do this, we need to learn new ways to measure impact on biodiversity and soils. This is possible by partnering with recognized leaders in this area, as we have done with AgroParisTech or the WWF, for example — and by applying authoritative frameworks, such as those established by the Science-Based Targets for Nature program or the Global Biodiversity Score of the Caisse des Dépôts Biodiversité.”

He added: “We must be exemplary and lead the way by creating products whose exceptional quality also applies to environmental aspects.”

Arnault wrote: “Protecting biodiversity also requires funding. Philanthropy must target nature, as well, promoting what one might term ‘biosphere-philia.’”

Also on Friday morning, Kering and Conservation International, the American nonprofit environmental organization, revealed the first grantees for the Regenerative Fund for Nature, which the groups jointly launched in January.

Kering’s chief sustainability officer Marie-Claire Daveu was scheduled to talk about the news later in the day during the IUCN World Conservation Congress.

The first funding round concentrates on projects helping the conversion of 1 million hectares of land to regenerative practices in fashion and luxury’s cotton, wool, cashmere and leather supply chains.

Applications for the fund were evaluated on how they sync with the fund’s objectives, important environmental indicators, opportunities to scale the regenerative programs and potential for breaking new ground, Kering and Conservation International explained together in a statement. Scientific analysis led to identifying key focus regions to optimize opportunities for good results concerning climate, nature and livelihoods through the luxury and fashion’s supply chains.

Seventy-three organizations applied from 17 countries. The chosen grantees hailed from South America, Central Asia, India, Europe and Africa.

The fund’s first recipients will initially support more than 840,000 hectares changing over to regenerative approaches that directly benefit 60,000 people involved in small- and larger-scale farming systems.

The seven organizations awarded grants include:

• The Good Growth Company, whose toolkit supports new approaches to building sustainable supply chains and grazing practices. The group partners with cashmere goat herders in Mongolia.

• Organic Cotton Accelerator, which focuses on cotton farmers in India and aiding them to de-risk change through targeted payments. That involves 50,000 smallholder farmers.

• Fundación Solidaridad Latinoamericana, an organization working with indigenous smallholder cattle producers in Argentina’s Gran Chaco biome to better sustainable management of grazing lands and restoring native forests and vegetation.

• Fundación Global Nature, which works with goat shepherds in Spain to reinstate traditional grazing systems and regenerate 17,000 hectares.

• Wildlife Conservation Society and The Wildlife-Friendly Enterprise Network, centered on regenerative grazing and holistic management approaches with wildlife-friendly practices for sheep wool production in Patagonia.

• Epiterre, focused on increasing plant diversity for positive ecological and social changes in Southwestern France. It uses direct payments for small-scale producers.

• Conservation South America, which aims to implement regenerative agricultural practices pertaining to biodiversity in the Maluti Drakensberg Mountains. The group also helps to empower female sheep farmers.

“Global change always begins at the local level, which is why we’re excited to support grassroots conservation efforts on four continents with Kering under the Regenerative Fund for Nature,” said M. Sanjayan, chief executive officer of Conservation International, in the statement. “We know that the path to a sustainable, nature-positive future must include indigenous peoples and local communities, so as we move into the next phase of the fund, progress will be continually monitored together with Kering to ensure that initiatives are delivering measurable outcomes for the environment, and just as critically, for local livelihoods.”

“This next phase of our Regenerative Fund for Nature’s rollout is integral to the attainment of Kering’s goal to have a net positive impact on biodiversity by 2025,” said Daveu, in the statement. “We had a tremendous response, and the first grantees were selected from excellent proposals, showing both the appetite and the opportunity to scale regenerative farming practices globally. We are exploring and leveraging different actions to support further projects under the fund that will maximize a positive impact on biodiversity restoration in luxury and fashion’s supply chains.”

The award that the giant luxury brand holding company gives every year is highly coveted, and Nensi Dojaka rose above around 1,900 applicants from 110 countries to win the 2021 edition. The talents recieve 300,000 euros and one year of expert advice from the company.

“I suppose that the jury liked the fact that I have a very specific and at the same time commercial point of view”, commented the designer after being awarded.

Originally from Albania and based in London. In 2017 Nensi Dojaka launched her eponymous label, a high-end women’s prêt-à-porter brand, while she was still completing her Bachelor’s degree at the London College of Fashion, motivated only by her passion for fashion. Then, she continued her training at Central Saint Martins, and she was convinced that she wanted to keep up with her project after her first successes. In fact, in 2019 when she had just finished her studies, getting a master’s degree in womenswear, Nensi Dojaka started selling her creations on the Ssense platform through a capsule collection.

She broke into the London fashion scene last year with the help of Fashion East, a non-profit new-talent support organization that gives designers the opportunity to stage a runway show at London Fashion Week. Since then, Dojaka has become known for her ’90s-inspired unstructured silhouettes, where layers of sheer fabric and silk come together with asymmetric shapes to result in ultra-feminine pieces, delicate but very bold at the same time.

For the last few months, Dojaka has started to sell her pieces in emblematic places such as Selfridges, My Theresa, Voo store or Luisa Vía Roma, and one of her dresses has reached the top 10 of most sought after garments, according to the Lyst Index’s hottest products of 2021, alongside designs from brands like Bottega Veneta, Prada and Hermès.

She’ll also be a part of luxury retailer MatchesFashion’s Innovators Programme, an annual initiative that offers each class year-long support including mentorship, preferential business terms and a £2.2 million investment in marketing support.

Since its founding in 2014, the LVMH Prize has promised to provide emerging talent from around the world funding and insider connections to boost their careers. Some of the previous editions were won by names well known today such as Jacquemus, Hood by Air, Marine Serre or Grace Wales Bonner

Dojaka was selected by a jury composed by the house’s star designers and industry leaders including Stella McCartney, Jonathan Anderson of Loewe, Marc Jacobs, Kim Jones of Fendi, Virgil Abloh of Louis Vuitton, and Maria Grazia Chiuri of Dior, as well as the group’s most prominent executives: Sidney Toledano, Delphine Arnault and Jean Paul Claverie."

The aim is to co-design an approach that is brand-agnostic, and which provides consumers with clear, transparent and comparable environmental impact information, based on a common science-based methodology. They are inviting other cosmetics companies to join them in this pursuit.

Addressing the demand for greater transparency

The new assessment and scoring system will aim to meet growing consumer demand for greater transparency about the environmental impact of cosmetics products (formula, packaging and usage). The objective is to improve the information that is available to consumers and enable them to make more sustainable consumption choices.

To do this, a consortium will be created that is open to all cosmetics companies wishing to join and contribute to designing a system that allows consumers to compare cosmetics products within the same category. The ambition is for the overall score to inform consumers of the environmental impact of products, taking into account their whole product life cycle.

Co-building a scientific methodology and scoring system

It is proposed that the consortium works with sustainability consultancy Quantis to ensure a robust and scientific approach and that efforts to co-build the voluntary assessment methodology and scoring system are guided by and articulated around:

A common method for measuring environmental impacts throughout the life cycle of products, backed by the principles of the “Product Environmental Footprint” (the European Union’s PEF scientific method for quantifying the environmental footprint of products). A common database of environmental impacts of standard ingredients and raw materials used in formulas and packaging, as well as during product usage. A common tool that enables each brand to calculate the environmental impact of individual products, usable by non-experts. A harmonized scoring system, for example using a score ranging from A to E, that enables the consumer to easily compare products. The methodology, data base, tool and scoring system will be verified by independent parties.

Engaging all players in the cosmetics sector

This global initiative is intended to be open to all cosmetics companies, regardless of their size or resources. Other stakeholders will be informed and consulted throughout the process. The convening five companies will pool their experience and knowledge in developing environmental impact assessment methodologies (as is the case for Henkel, LVMH, Natura &Co, and Unilever) and an environmental and social labelling system (as developed by L’Oréal). All companies will benefit from this pre-existing work and are invited to contribute their own experience. The consortium will also be consulting with external experts, including scientists, academics and NGOs to ensure the ongoing integrity of the approach. The work developed by the consortium will be published and made accessible on a strictly voluntary basis by both consortium participants and all other interested parties.

""It is possible for the cosmetics sector, as has happened in other sectors, to build a scientific environmental impact assessment of their products, based on a full life cycle assessment. It requires a cross-industry pooling of knowledge and expertise, particularly concerning the environmental impact data; this is exactly what the consortium founding members are embarking on."" Philippe Osset, expert in the application of life cycle assessment to eco-design, consultant providing expertise for the European Commission and AFNOR (Association française de normalisation, French Standardization Association).

Cosmetics Europe has been actively following the process; other industry associations are being contacted to join the consortium.

Inside luxury fashion’s long-overdue reckoning with sustainability - Style,"Sun, 12 Sep 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjbXAuY29tL21hZ2F6aW5lcy9zdHlsZS9sdXh1cnkvYXJ0aWNsZS8zMTQ4MzAyL2Zhc2hpb24tcmVhbGx5LWVudGVyaW5nLXN1c3RhaW5hYmlsaXR5LWRlY2FkZS1mYXJmZXRjaNIBcmh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLnNjbXAuY29tL21hZ2F6aW5lcy9zdHlsZS9sdXh1cnkvYXJ0aWNsZS8zMTQ4MzAyL2Zhc2hpb24tcmVhbGx5LWVudGVyaW5nLXN1c3RhaW5hYmlsaXR5LWRlY2FkZS1mYXJmZXRjaA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Stymied by lockdowns and paused social lives, homebound consumers came face-to-face with overstuffed wardrobes and had little use for their most prized accessories. While eco-sentiments were already on the rise, Covid-19 has, along with unwelcome fear and anxiety, laid bare the luxury industry’s penchant for overconsumption and its voracious effect on the environment.

Once upon a time, extravagance, exuberance and exorbitance ruled the luxury landscape. Fashion fanatics would sport their latest luxury acquisitions featuring the most exotic leathers and skins as a form of status.

And so, a new era in luxury retail is under way. Dubbed the “sustainability decade” by consultancy Bain & Company, brands and retailers are pivoting to sustainable offerings and conscious initiatives to cater to an emerging generation of affluent consumers, turning over a new leaf and shifting their consumption from an accumulation of “It” bags to purposeful buying.

At the forefront of this is Farfetch, which is providing a blueprint for what a more responsible luxury experience could look like.

“The pandemic has effectively accelerated trends which were in existence already,” says Thomas Berry, director of sustainable business at Farfetch. “Consumers are looking for products that epitomise either of two things: having better social impact or being more environmentally sound – or both.”

Sandra Sandor says, “Sustainability won’t be a choice, it will be a requirement very soon”. Illustration: Craig Stephens

Farfetch boasts the largest global edit of conscious product, featuring up-and-coming brands such as Bode, Anouki and Nanushka, all of which understand the growing role of mindful consumption – not least because it’s paying off.

Data from Farfetch’s first “Conscious Luxury Report” revealed that conscious product sales grew 3.4 times faster than the Farfetch marketplace average from 2019 to 2020. The conscious proposition is notably resonating with Chinese consumers, with the company recording a 188 per cent year-on-year growth in conscious gross merchandise value in China.

“Sustainability won’t be a choice, it will be a requirement very soon,” says Nanushka’s founder and creative director Sandra Sandor. “Nanushka’s commitment to sustainability is to try to find ways that will have the least amount of impact on the environment while not compromising on our aesthetic and quality.”

Faith Robinson says, “Conscious fashion is incredibly personal, but a lot of consumers don’t know where to start”. Illustration: Craig Stephens

English designer Stella McCartney has long led the industry in sustainable practices. Then there’s Marine Serre, whose Crescent Moon top, made with 50 per cent recycled materials, was one of the most popular ethical choices on Farfetch, with sales surging 662 per cent between 2019 and 2020.

But despite this shift in high-end spending, fashion still rules. “When consumers are buying consciously, they still want the best in modern luxury fashion, which is what they come to Farfetch for,” Berry says. “It’s just that there is an added element of conscious awareness.”

This burgeoning desire to be purposeful is proving to be the latest iteration of status. “There is a certain amount of clout associated with sustainability,” says Faith Robinson, co-founder of CogDis, a creative ethics consultancy.

“It enriches a product with an additional dimension of hierarchy in luxury, which consumers can use to elevate their status.”

Across the fashion industry, the luxury sector is perhaps best positioned to do this, as identity is so often defined by an individual’s personal style and aesthetics. It perhaps explains why there’s been a flurry of ethically sound initiatives. Net-a-Porter launched Net Sustain, a curation of consciously crafted fashion and beauty. Hong Kong’s Lane Crawford stores, often the city’s arbiters-in-chief of high style, proposed a list of sustainable gifts for the holiday season last year.

Even the old guard have thrown their proverbial hats into the responsible fashion ring, introducing limited-edition conscious capsules in conjunction with their seasonal collections. Gucci launched Off The Grid, a line created with organic, bio-based, recycled and sustainably sourced materials. Their Italian counterpart, Prada, has reinvented iconic bag silhouettes in a regenerated nylon, Econyl.

LVMH’s new venture, Nona Source, ensures mindful rarity from the point of creation, weaving purpose into the DNA of its material. The platform repurposes deadstock fabric from the luxury giant’s ateliers, whose high quality standards meet the next generation’s expectations through this conscious sales circle.

“Luxury consumers want quality, durability and exclusivity,” says co-founder, Marie Falguera.

“It’s our goal at Nona Source to underwrite this idea,” highlighting that all the materials sold are certified as LVMH Maisons’ deadstock. Not only does this brand-backed certification negate the stigma of deadstock fabric, it could also signal the next luxury must-have for status seekers – a highly sought-after conscious stamp of approval.

But Robinson argues that luxury players are still not doing enough, confining what is now an urgent societal need to monotonous aesthetics of forests, oceans and muted pastels. “They [luxury brands] have to move marketing budgets away from product and make it more about learning, feeling and experiencing,” she explains. “When you bring ethics and morality into the storytelling, that’s when consumers can embrace the emotions and intimate experience of being responsible.”

Robinson agrees that Farfetch is an outlier in the industry. “The best brands in society right now come with an offer of education,” she affirms.

“Conscious fashion is incredibly personal, but a lot of consumers don’t know where to start,” says Berry, noting the role Farfetch has in enabling the broader community. “It needs to be made easier so we’re giving them [consumers] the tools to do it.”

Educating consumers to make smarter luxury investments, the platform has partnered with Good On You, an ethical rating agency that evaluates how fashion favourites from around the world are measuring up. Farfetch has also released a Fashion Footprint Tool, a calculator that assesses the impact of your fashion choices.

Farfetch is aiming to energise the fashion world with its ethical appeal to consumers, allowing them to maybe, just maybe, imagine living in a responsible world sometime in the future – a feat that a tiny minority have achieved to date.

For the next generation, status and exclusivity will arise from demonstrably meaningful consumption, and that will soon become a baseline consideration, if not an expectation. The new luxury identity will stem from purposeful aspirations and the need for ethical integrity.

Until now, the industry has shown relatively little of that integrity, relying on promises and pledges not always fulfilled. Yet while there’s a long way to go, the next generation of luxury will surely look starkly different from that of today. To quote Berry, “For the sake of the world, it has to be.”"
Luxury's Fur Calculus: To Ban or Not to Ban? - The Business of Fashion,"Fri, 24 Sep 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzb2ZmYXNoaW9uLmNvbS9icmllZmluZ3MvbHV4dXJ5L2x1eHVyeXMtZnVyLWNhbGN1bHVzLXRvLWJhbi1vci1ub3QtdG8tYmFuL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"At Fendi’s Milan show on Wednesday, models sashayed down the runway in ‘70s-disco-inspired glam, punctuated by the decadent furs the LVMH-owned label is known for. Less than 48 hours later, the group’s arch-rival Kering announced it was going fur-free.

While not so long ago, the declaration would have been seen as radical, now the most remarkable thing about it might be how clearly it contrasts with the approach taken by LVMH.

Kering never sold large volumes of fur in the first place and its brands have been gradually removing the materials from their products for years, with cash cow Gucci famously declaring fur passé in 2017. The group’s decision to go fully fur-free (only Saint Laurent and Brioni still sold fur) aligns all its brands with a broader market trend that has seen fur fall from fashion, buffeted by declining consumer interest, animal-rights activism and government action to ban its sale and production in several places. California became the first state to ban fur in 2019, while Israel became the first country to ban the material, with exceptions for religious observances, earlier this year.

The pandemic has only furthered fur’s decline. An outbreak of Covid-19 on mink farms in Denmark resulted in a government-mandated cull that effectively wiped out the industry in the world’s largest producer of mink pelts.

Luxury labels like Prada, Versace, Burberry and Chanel all said they would give fur up years ago, taking a relatively small hit to sales, while scoring plenty of public relations points. But the world’s largest luxury group, LVMH, has been conspicuously silent on the subject. So have many of its brands, which typically operate with a greater degree of independence than Kering’s labels as part of a federation-style model.

Will LVMH ever give up fur?

The calculus for the luxury giant is more complicated than at many other luxury companies. Several LVMH labels don’t use fur, though they rarely advertise that. (A notable exception is famously anti-fur Stella McCartney, in which LVMH acquired a minority stake in 2019). On the other hand, the group’s biggest brands, including powerhouses Dior and Louis Vuitton consistently feature fur in their collections. For Fendi, another major contributor to group revenue which started as a furrier in 1925, the material is at the very core of its heritage and legitimacy as a luxury house.

Meanwhile, public proclamations against fur by other LVMH brands, though they may sell little or no fur, would likely add momentum to calls by advocacy groups to ban the material altogether, just as statements from other luxury players have done, isolating the likes of Dior and Fendi on the issue.

“As long as Fendi is part of that group and Fendi has a close association with fur, it’s going to be a long time before LVMH goes fur-free,” said PJ Smith, director of fashion policy at the Humane Society.

For other companies less intimately linked to the material, the equation is very different. Abandoning the material can lead to a positive public relations coup for brands, particularly among socially conscious young consumers, while having a limited negative on the bottom line.

When Gucci announced it was going fur-free in 2017, the material accounted for around €10 million in sales, or roughly 0.2 percent of revenue. The brand’s Instagram post announcing the news was among its top performing posts at the time, gaining nearly 180,000 likes. Kering declined to provide details of the current value of fur sales across the group.

For Kering, the move is also in line with its wider corporate strategy to define its brand of luxury as “caring” (a key element of its 2013 decision to rebrand from PPR to Kering) and embrace a framework of ethical and environmentally responsible business practices that resonates with an increasingly value-conscious consumer.

“That’s the new definition we need to understand very well,” chief executive François-Henri Pinault said. “Through this lens, some materials have no place in luxury.”

While that’s not a position LVMH is likely to take any time soon, the luxury group has been quietly making adjustments that nod to changing attitudes towards fur. It’s put in place strict sourcing standards for animal welfare and has appointed an external committee of experts to assess efforts to improve. Some brands have tried working with faux fur alternatives.

Fendi rebranded its Couture Week show in 2018 as haute couture, rather than haute fourrure. It’s given the material less prominence on the runway and started experimenting with recycled fur.

But perhaps one of the biggest barriers to any major change in LVMH’s stance on fur is that the debate has not touched its bottom line. The group’s fashion division has come roaring back from the pandemic, powered by sales from fur-selling Louis Vuitton, Dior and Fendi.

Fresh offers up audio-visual digital experience on heels of 30-year anniversary - Glossy,"Mon, 27 Sep 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmdsb3NzeS5jby9iZWF1dHkvZnJlc2gtb2ZmZXJzLXVwLWF1ZGlvLXZpc3VhbC1kaWdpdGFsLWV4cGVyaWVuY2Utb24taGVlbHMtb2YtMzAteWVhci1hbm5pdmVyc2FyeS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"On Wednesday, LVMH-owned skin-care brand Fresh debuted an audio-visual experience dubbed “A Fresh Take.” The goal: to strengthen brand affinity and emotional connection among its customers.

A Fresh Take, hosted on a dedicated micro-site, features short-form audio content by beauty industry guests. The under-15-minute audio episodes are accompanied by a caption about the 30 commitments the brand’s announced throughout the last 12 months via social media. The commitments focus on topics including forwarding diversity and body inclusivity, reducing carbon footprints within the Fresh offices and via packaging changes, and improving corporate culture. Tennille Kopiasz, Fresh CMO, said Fresh’s commitments are based on three pillars: people, planet and product. A 30-second intro to A Fresh Take encourages visitors to apply a Fresh facemask, as they pick and choose to listen to audio snippets that are “timed to your favorite mask.”

“It’s about marketing post-pandemic,” said Kopiasz. “Digital is where consumers are and where they’re buying — over half of our business is done in digital. But it also links to the transparency that people want and want to associate themselves with. By having this audio-visual [experience], it really helps establish that level of trust.”

Kopiasz said Covid-19 has changed both customer and societal values, and that A Fresh Take is about providing a digital respite from the overwhelming world. She added that Fresh experienced a sales lift in its non-skin-care products in 2020, including in its home, fragrance and body categories. She declined to break out specific sales increases.

To build out the experiential element of its audio-visual project, Fresh solicited friends of the brand, brand employees and LVMH executives. For instance, there is Mira Mariah, a tattoo artist and influencer (@GirlKnewYork, 225,000 Instagram followers) who shares her take on diversity in the beauty industry. She’s featured alongside Lara Koritzke, Union for Ethical BioTrade director, who discusses how sourcing ingredients responsibly helps the planet.

“It’s a moment for mindful masking, to escape from our busy lives. The idea for us is to bring a consumer close to us in an authentic way,” said Kopiasz. “[A Fresh Take] gives us [the ability] to share all the work that we were doing across the three pillars and to take consumers along this journey to engage them in our future commitments.”

Kopiasz said that engagement with the microsite and affinity for the brand are the main key performance indicators, but that a broad reach is not the primary focus. Fresh is driving people to the microsite via its own unpaid social media posts using the audio and video snippets. It’s also promoting it on the Fresh e-commerce website, as well as via an Instagram paid ad campaign that runs from Sept. 23-October 31.

“As we celebrate how far we’ve come in 30 years, the key step is to focus on where Fresh needs to be tomorrow,” said Alina Roytberg, Fresh co-founder. “Through the 30 commitments, Fresh pledges to drive the essential evolution of our brand.”"

Kevin Jiang, president of China’s e-commerce giant JD.com, talks to STYLE about the country’s digitisation of shopping for luxury products and on forging a relationship with LVMH.

While the pandemic has hit the global luxury market hard, China is actually seeing rapid growth. In the meantime, we also see trends that luxury consumers are becoming younger, buying more full-price products and sales are gradually reaching the lower-tier markets. During JD’s “618 Grand Promotion”, Gen Z customers buying luxury products increased 231 per cent year-on-year.

The pandemic has revealed just how important e-commerce is to the future of luxury goods. When many stores were forced to close, brands have to transform and focus on digital sales – and often relied on more established platforms like JD.com to reach digital customers, especially in lower-tier cities and in the absence of international travel and shopping.

This year, luxury giant LVMH has inked a series of partnerships with JD for iconic brands including Givenchy, Berluti, Guerlain, Sephora and Zenith, with more on the horizon.

What drove LVMH and JD.com to form a partnership?

Luxury brands have very high requirements and pay extremely close attention to the brand image, while pursuing the ultimate customer experience. Top luxury brands like LVMH, the world’s largest luxury goods conglomerate , focus even more on these aspects. They value their own sales channels such as the brand’s official websites and are cautious about working with third-party platforms. Top brands rarely cooperate with e-commerce companies. With the continuous development of e-commerce, luxury brands also see great potential, especially in the Chinese market.

JD is keen to better understand brands’ needs and also offer more flexible digital solutions to our brand partners, especially the top luxury ones. JD introduced a unique model when Louis Vuitton launched on JD in April 2021. Through the model, consumers can type “LV” in the search bar on the JD app and enter LV’s official mini program to enjoy the brand’s exclusive shopping experience.

Will selling luxury watches and high jewellery online be the next big thing?

As millennials and Gen Z consumers are growing to be the major consumer group for luxury products, and with the pandemic accelerating the development of e-commerce, we’ve seen an increasing online penetration of luxury brands.

In terms of categories, in addition to fashionable leather goods, and beauty and make-up, there will be great potential for the market of watches and jewellery. There will be more lifestyle and cultural trends in the future, and brands will be more focused on content marketing and creating interactive experiences with consumers.

High-end watches and luxury jewellery are also benefiting from the general trend in self-gifting. The Chinese consumer used to buy jewellery for the weight of gold; now they’re buying it because it’s a wonderful way to show their personality. As more and more consumers move online to buy luxury products, watches and jewellery are indispensable choices as gifts.

In China’s highly digitised society, how important are physical stores for luxury retail?

Luxury brands entered China by opening flagship stores in high-end offline department stores and malls in first-tier cities, addressing the store image and shopping experience. Digital transformation, combined with the new shopping habits of the younger generation and the impact of Covid-19, has seen growing online penetration.

Technology and logistics infrastructure enable online platform JD.com to provide similar luxury shopping experiences as offline, through AR/VR and JD Luxury Express for example.

In addition, enormous demand from lower-tier markets cannot be met with limited [numbers of] luxury shops in big cities, so the trend of online and offline synergy is ready to go ahead.

What’s JD’s focus for the next three to five years?

We look forward to providing e-commerce capabilities for more luxury brands and to provide an even more premium e-commerce experience for shoppers, through JD.com’s reliable supply chain and logistics abilities, high-quality consumer base, innovative business models and technology solutions.

From fashion to beauty to footwear, this alphabetical list encompasses those creating change at the highest level, while also addressing the numerous challenges facing all women in a post-pandemic world.

1. Delphine Arnault

Executive Vice President, Louis Vuitton; Board Member and Executive Committee Member, LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton

More from WWD

Power Move: The eldest child and only daughter of luxury titan Bernard Arnault, Delphine Arnault shares her father’s drive. She also has a distinct eye for creative talent, and has been instrumental in recruiting disruptive new designers to several of the firm’s powerhouse brands. With her passion for championing young designers, she is the brainchild behind the LVMH Prize, launched in 2014. Schooled at the EDHEC Business School in Lille, France, and the London School of Economics, Arnault began her career at management consultancy McKinsey & Co., joining the family business in 2000 as a development director at John Galliano. She moved to Dior in 2001, where she learned the ropes behind the scenes before rising to become deputy managing director. In 2013, she was named executive vice president at Louis Vuitton, her current role.

Leadership Advice: “I am very honored and humbled to be on this list alongside women who are real drivers and agents of change in our industry. Even if leadership is genderless, we all have a responsibility to inspire and empower future generations. At LVMH, we created several initiatives to support women in attaining high positions within the group. I am particularly proud of our performance at Louis Vuitton where women hold close to 50 percent of top leadership roles.”

2. Drew Barrymore

Founder, Barrymore Brands

Power Move: Drew Barrymore is so adept at creating a true connection with anyone in her orbit, it’s easy to forget she’s a global superstar whose business interests span the worlds of Hollywood, home, fashion, beauty and, most recently, media — a hit TV show now in its second season and a magazine that launched last year. Her brand is called Flower and no wonder — Barrymore is in full blossom.

Leadership Advice: “If you care about the word power, you better be diligent and take the ego out of it because there’s no room for ego in business and working with other people. It’s alienating and unnecessary. Work from your heart, work from your gut — much better place.”

3. Francesca Bellettini

President and Chief Executive Officer, Yves Saint Laurent

Power Move: Francesca Bellettini began as an investment banker before moving to the Prada group in 1999. She joined the Business Planning and Development division and later became operations manager for Helmut Lang. Joining Kering in 2003 as strategic planning director and associate worldwide merchandising director of Gucci, she joined Bottega Veneta in 2008 and became worldwide merchandising and communications director in 2010. In 2013, she became president and chief executive officer of Yves Saint Laurent.

Leadership Advice: “Leadership is not a title. It does not appear in an organizational chart and cannot come without the respect of others and yourself. A leader must have the ability to decide and guide while avoiding paralyzing others due to the fear of the risks that any decision bears. A leader is aware of the risks but does not let them weaken if they are reasonable to take. And most importantly, the leader is the one who encourages people to work better by identifying and building on their strengths and keeping them moving in the right direction.”

4. Sabina Belli

Chief Executive Officer, Pomellato

Power Move: Sabina Belli joined Kering, which controls Pomellato, in April 2015 as general manager of the Italian jewelry brand and at the end of that year was promoted to chief executive officer. She leverages extensive experience in the luxury sector, built at L’Oréal Luxe and LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, where her roles included international brand director for Christian Dior Parfums, international brand manager for Veuve Clicquot Ponsardin and brand executive vice president of Bulgari. She joined Kering, which controls Pomellato, in April 2015 as general manager of the brand and at the end of that year was promoted to CEO. Belli has long been vocal about empowering women, launching for example the Pomellato For Women campaign in 2017, promoting female leadership. She was instrumental in founding the #PomellatoForWomen platform in 2017 with ambassadors including Jane Fonda and Cate Blanchett, promoting equality and inclusivity, and Belli spearheaded an awareness campaign and crowdfunding initiative to support women victims of domestic violence. The company has for more than a decade supported CADMI, an antiviolence center in Milan, and its parent network D.i.Re.

Leadership Advice: “As a CEO, female empowerment is a strong value for me. Gender or diversity should not be a problem at work and beyond. I encourage and strive to provide equality and equal career opportunities for my employees. As leaders we need to pursue a higher purpose, to create a common vision that moves people to achieve big dreams, to improve the world we live in. As leaders we have to foster hope.”

5. Roberta Benaglia

Founder and CEO, Style Capital

Power Move: Roberta Benaglia has built a solid reputation as a thoroughly prepared and fearless investor. In Milan, she founded Style Capital, the fund that acquired a 32 percent stake in MSGM in 2018, supporting the brand’s founder Massimo Giorgetti, forging distribution partnerships and building a global retail network. Last year, Style Capital became in investor in Australian brand Zimmermann, expanding the fund’s portfolio of investments in the fashion industry, which also includes Forte_Forte and Los Angeles-based company Re/Done. Benaglia is also associated with the success of Golden Goose. Style Capital, which at that time was named DGPA, acquired 38 percent of the luxury sneaker brand in March 2013 and sold it in 2015. During that time, under the lead of Style Capital, Golden Goose’s revenues increased from 21.4 million euros to 76 million euros. In 2015, Golden Goose passed under the control of Ergon Capital Partners III and in 2017 was acquired by Carlyle Europe Partners IV, which last February sold the brand to Permira for 1.2 billion euros.

6. Esi Eggleston Bracey

Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, Beauty and Personal Care, Unilever North America

Power Move: Over the course of her career, Esi Eggleston Bracey has prioritized purpose as much as profit — and with oversight of Unilever’s beauty and personal care businesses in North America, she’s got one of the largest platforms out there. Whether helping to pass antihair discrimination with The Crown Act or overseeing the creation of sustainable brands like Love Beauty and Planet, Bracey has driven impact across all areas of her business.

Leadership Advice: “Invest in yourself and your personal development. Understand how to bring your authentic self to help inspire, focus, and empower people to embrace your leadership mission.”

7. Tory Burch

Executive Chairman and Chief Creative Director, Tory Burch

Power Move: Tory Burch draws inspiration from the worlds of travel, art and interiors and women globally. She has successfully steered her designer lifestyle brand that today does well over $1.5 billion in sales, according to sources. The brand encompasses ready-to-wear, handbags, footwear, accessories, jewelry, home and beauty and empowers women through the Tory Burch Foundation, which advances women’s empowerment and entrepreneurship in the U.S. by providing access to capital, education and digital resources. Burch is known as a creative and entrepreneurial leader who encourages everyone to shine in a highly collaborative environment.

Leadership Advice: “I always tell the entrepreneurs I work with through our Foundation to think about the leaders they have known and the qualities that brought out the best in them. For me, it comes down to the values passed down by my parents and the lessons I have learned throughout my career. When you create a strong and inclusive culture where people are treated with kindness and respect, they do great work. As importantly, they stay with you. There are members of my team who have been with me from the beginning when we were working around my kitchen table. Leaders by definition inspire followers.”

8. Anne Cavassa

President, Saucony

Power Move: Lifted by the running boom, Saucony is racking up product wins — and under Anne Cavassa’s leadership achieved an all-time revenue high in the second quarter.

Leadership Advice: “We have to be nimble and agile, but also very thoughtful and deliberate. What we’ve been doing is rallying around our brand purpose. As a leader, I think it’s been really important to me that my actions are in alignment with both our mission statement as well as my own core values.”

9. Emma Chamberlain

Creative Director and Global Brand Ambassador, Bad Habit

Power Move: YouTube sensation Emma Chamberlain has become a fashion-world favorite (and beauty, too.) Most recently, she made her debut at the Met Ball, dressed in custom Louis Vuitton, a brand she has worked with since 2019. She’s also found success with her Chamberlain Coffee, as well as Bad Habit skin care, for whom she serves as global ambassador and creative director. And with nearly 14 million Instagram followers and over 1 billion views on YouTube, her influence shows no signs of waning.

Leadership Advice: “Prioritize creativity and passion over everything. I constantly ask myself, am I creatively inspired? Why am I creating? Am I proud of what I am doing? If the answer is ever no to one of those questions, that means I am creating for the wrong reasons, or I have gotten too caught up in ‘grind culture.’ You must enjoy the process of creating in order to create things that will reach people’s hearts, while simultaneously enhancing your own life. Many people (myself included) forget that we decide how we want to live our lives every day, and if we want to shift things around and step outside of the box to keep ourselves creatively inspired, we can do that.”

10. Eva Chen

Vice President of Fashion and Shopping Partnerships, Instagram

Power Move: Eva Chen spent seven years at Teen Vogue and earned her degree in journalism from Columbia University. In 2013, she became editor in chief of Lucky. She has also contributed to Vogue, Vogue China, the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal, and has been a contributor to “Good Morning America” and a fashion correspondent for “Entertainment Tonight.” She sits on the board for Net-a-porter and is the author of New York Times bestseller “Juno Valentine and the Magical Shoes.”

11. Angelica Cheung

Venture Partner, Sequoia Capital China

Power Move: Vogue does not define Angelica Cheung. The former longtime editorial director of Vogue China who launched and spearheaded the fashion title’s Chinese edition for 16 years is now a venture partner at Sequoia Capital’s China branch, a strategic adviser for Ermenegildo Zegna to chief executive officer Gildo Zegna for the Asian region, and a board member of luxury e-retailer Ssense. Cheung is now utilizing her insight into the Chinese market to scout and support a new generation of Chinese innovation and international brands in the fashion, lifestyle and entertainment sectors to expand in the market.

12. Maria Grazia Chiuri

Creative Director, Dior

Power Move: Maria Grazia Chiuri has implemented messages of female empowerment into Christian Dior through romantic and artisanal craftsmanship. From the start, she emblazoned T-shirts and decorated runway show sets with powerful slogans to push the message, while upholding the brand’s ongoing popularity through the omnipresent Christian Dior handbags.

Leadership Advice: “It’s such an honor to have been included in this extraordinary group of women. I’m conscious of the responsibility it brings. I believe that, today more than ever, it is essential that women stop setting limits on their goals. We need to get over all our shyness and our fears. We need to get over our feeling of not being enough, which has held us back for years. The challenges we face today to achieve a future that is sustainable in all ways are numerous and critical. Women who were raised to be caretakers must understand that the time has arrived for us to be a united, active group, and we each need to welcome the honor of being a leader in our respective camps.”

13. Sharon Chuter

Founder and CEO, Uoma Beauty; Founder, Pull Up for Change

Power Move: When Sharon Chuter launched her makeup brand, Uoma Beauty, in 2019, her goal was to create a truly inclusive line that transcended foundation shades. After the murder of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis police, Chuter not only doubled down on her original mission, she catalyzed the beauty industry with the creation of Pull Up for Change, challenging companies to share their stats on diversity, equity and inclusivity and set clear goals for change. Chuter may be relatively new to beauty, but her impact belies her years.

Leadership Advice: “Trust in yourself especially in your ‘femininity.’ Lead with tenacity but also lead with empathy if that’s who you are naturally. Don’t feel the need to do things the way men do it or have done it. This is the gift of diversity. There is no right or wrong way so do it your way. Also remember that it’s OK to make mistakes and when you do, don’t beat yourself up too much — women tend to expect perfection from ourselves and that holds us back. Perfection is not the goal — just try, just start. Fail fast and fail forward.”

14. CaSandra Diggs

President, The Council of Fashion Designers of America

Power Move: CaSandra Diggs was appointed president of the CFDA in August 2020 from chief administrative and financial officer, charged with developing strategy and making decisions that further the CFDA’s purpose to champion, educate and support its members and the fashion industry. She is an innovative thinker with a strong understanding of organizational and business operations, and the expansion of her role provided the CFDA with more opportunities to meet the needs of its members in a broad and diverse way.

Leadership Advice: “Let the E.G.O. you lead from always be Empathy, Gratitude and Optimism so that you consistently support, appreciate and inspire the people that follow you.”

15. Muge Erdirik Dogan

President, Amazon Fashion

Power Move: Having served as president of Amazon Fashion since February 2021, Muge Erdirik Dogan is responsible for developing and executing Amazon Fashion’s growth strategy, including enhancing the core flywheel, building technology to continuously invent on behalf of customers, developing new private brands and merchandising and marketing to their customers. Dogan has been with Amazon for 14 years leading category, technology and operations teams, joining in 2007 to build revenue management science models for their advertising business.

Leadership Advice: “We’re focused on creating the future of shopping by merging the worlds of fashion and technology, and I encourage working backward from the customer and inventing for their latent needs. I find the team’s full potential is reached when a culture of unconstrained, out-of-the-box ideation is fostered. I also encourage an environment where every team member feels empowered to present a new idea or a different way of remedying customer challenges. We all have seats at the table.”

16.Chiara Ferragni

Entrepreneur, Brand Ambassador, Influencer

Power Move: Chiara Ferragni has full control of TBS Crew Srl, the company that manages The Blonde Salad online magazine and activities. TBS Crew also operates as a talent agency and digital marketing consultant. Ferragni founded TBS Crew in 2009 and in 2017 the young digital entrepreneur took on the role of president and chief executive officer. She is also the CEO and creative director of Fenice, formerly called Serendipity, which manages her namesake line. She has been expanding her product offer, launching her first total look collection under her namesake brand for fall 2021, underwear and beachwear collections. Ferragni, who has two children, also launched a children’s line. Most recently, she inked an eyewear license collection with Safilo Group. The Chiara Ferragni brand was launched in 2013 as a footwear label, and gradually introduced T-shirts and sweatshirts, developing a network of stores in cities such as Milan; Paris; Cortina, Italy; Hong Kong; Shanghai and Hangzhou, China. She also has a collaboration with Lancôme. Counting 24.9 million followers, Ferragni also continues to have several advertising deals ranging from Pantene to Pomellato. In April, she joined the board of Tod’s. Ferragni has become so influential that when she joined the board of Tod’s, the group’s shares soared on the Italian stock exchange, as did Safilo’s.

17. Chantal Gaemperle

Group Executive Vice President, Human Resources and Synergies, LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton

Power Move: Chantal Gaemperle has held the top human resources role at LVMH since 2007, and is renowned for nurturing internal talent and employee engagement. She is one of only two women on LVMH’s executive committee, alongside Delphine Arnault. Part of her remit has been to improve gender diversity in leadership roles at the company — when she joined LVMH, women held only 23 percent of its leadership positions; that ratio stood at 42 percent last year. Through the EllesVMH network, set up in 2007, she has been instrumental in supporting women’s career development. This June, she helped implement a global employee support fund, driven by what she described as an era that calls for “soft-skills leadership.”

Leadership Advice: “As the saying goes: ‘Be yourself, everybody else is taken!’ Being authentic and staying true to your values is what allows you to fight for your convictions. It is an essential aspect of leadership, one that I deeply believe in and encourage everybody to apply.”

18. Michelle Gass

Chief Executive Officer, Kohl’s

Power Move: Michelle Gass has been a game-changer, recasting the merchandise mix at Kohl’s to concentrate on beauty, activewear, casual and outdoor apparel. Sephora launched on kohls.com in August, in about 200 brick-and-mortar doors this fall, and ultimately is expected to be inside 850 Kohl’s locations. Kohl’s active business has more than doubled in the last five years, and the goal is for the category to represent 30 percent of the retailer’s volume in the future by leaning heavily on Nike, Adidas, Under Armour and the FLX private brand for growth. In outdoor and casual apparel, the offering is focused on brands like Columbia, Lands’ End, and the private Sonoma brand.

Leadership Advice: “For me, leadership is having the courage to lead with empathy and vulnerability. People want to work for leaders they believe in and that they can relate to. Leadership is also about anticipating tomorrow. We are operating in the most dynamic time in retail which demands a completely new way of thinking, a new level of agility and an appetite for bold, disruptive innovation.”

19. Evans Hankey

Vice President of Industrial Design, Apple

Power Move: Evans Hankey is vice president of Industrial Design at Apple, leading the renowned team that designs Apple’s product lineup. Evans joined Apple 21 years ago and has played a critical role in bringing some of the world’s most beloved consumer products to life, including iPod, iPhone, iMac, MacBook, Apple Watch, and AirPods. With a deep understanding of processes and materials and a passion for collaboration across Apple, Evans supports and facilitates every stage of the design process working closely with the team of designers, engineers, prototypers, researchers, digital sculptors and model makers responsible for Apple’s iconic designs.

Leadership Advice: “Many of us at Apple have had the great fortune to learn from Jony Ive and Steve Jobs, two of the most visionary leaders of our time. Foundational lessons for me have been about focus and humility. If we can maintain a tenacious focus on the work, the principles that drive the work, and the people who come together to make it happen, the rest sorts itself out. Doing so creates a culture of curiosity, trust and care, where ambition is not about personal ego but rather a force that unites us to make the very best products possible.”

20. Gabriela Hearst

Founder, Gabriela Hearst; Creative Director, Chloé

Power Move: Gabriela Hearst’s brand of female-first polish and gaucho earthiness is leading the movement toward intelligent, sustainable luxury. Using deadstock fabric and recycled cashmeres, staging carbon neutral runway shows, and collaborating with indigenous artisans, she’s committed to making fashion eco-minded and purposeful. Hearst was named creative director of Chloé at the end of last year, and her first collections have received rave reviews. She dressed Gillian Anderson in the French brand for the 2021 Met Gala and the 2021 Emmy Awards, and has relaunched the Chloé Edith bag to much fanfare.

Leadership Advice: “In the beginning of my career in the schmatta business, I was carrying a lot of shoe samples up the stairs to show a vendor. He said to me, ‘You will make it because you have perseverance. But once you make it, don’t believe the hype.’ That always stays with me to remember to focus on the work and the effort. Perseverance for me in some ways is more important than talent.”

“Another quote I recently heard from a woman I admire tremendously, Isabella Tree, who is a leader in our movement. I asked her, ‘How do you deal with ecological anxiety?’ She gave me a quote I loved by Aldo Leopold, an American author and environmentalist, who said, ‘One of the penalties of an ecological education is one lives alone in a world of wounds.’ That stayed with me. I know the work is difficult, but we must plow ahead.”

21. Helena Helmersson

Chief Executive Officer, H&M Group

Power Move: Helena Helmersson entered the limelight in January last year, when she was named CEO of the fast-fashion giant. Just a couple of months into her tenure, she was charged with steering the Swedish firm, in the midst of a massive business overhaul, through pandemic-related closures and supply chain challenges. After more than 20 years working her way up the corporate ladder in purchasing roles, then as sustainability manager for the company, she is determined that fashion can play a positive role for change, and her background in corporate social responsibility is seen as key to helping the Swedish fast-fashion giant navigate the shift toward a more sustainable, circular model. Her nomination represented a major shift for the firm; she took over from Karl-Johan Persson, whose family founded the company, who was at its helm for a decade.

Leadership Advice: “To me, leadership comes hand in hand with believing in people and the amazing things we can achieve when we unleash everyone’s potential, become creative together and move toward a joint direction. Empowering people is deeply rooted in our culture and values, and I see this as a shared responsibility which sparks creativity and faster decisions. That, linked to being open to constant feedback to be able to develop, is what helps us as leaders to create value and growth.”

22. Lauren Hobart

President & CEO, Dick’s Sporting Goods Inc.

Power Move: As the first female CEO of a major sporting goods retailer, Lauren Hobart is leading the charge at Dick’s at a time when the company is firing on all cylinders, thanks to its athletic and outdoor prowess, major digital growth, new retail concepts and focus on female empowerment initiatives.

Leadership Advice: “I’m a big believer in open communications, and leading with honest dialogue and transparency. It’s so important to connect with our teammates and make sure they are included and engaged. I’m incredibly grateful to our team at Dick’s Sporting Goods for their openness in return. Our people are what make us great, and we win because of them.”

23. Fran Horowitz

Chief Executive Officer, Abercrombie & Fitch Co.

Power Move: As CEO, Fran Horowitz has executed an impressive, multiyear turnaround of Abercrombie & Fitch. Among the maneuvers: aggressive rationalization of the store fleet by reducing the flagship count, increasing the count on smaller stores, which are designed to be more productive, less costly and omnicapable unlike the flagships; sharpening the identity of the brands in the portfolio so they’re more distinct and with less merchandise redundancy; accelerating social media where A&F has become a leader on TikTok and Instagram, and recasting the marketing so it’s more inclusive, diverse and tasteful.

24. Jane Hertzmark Hudis

Executive Group President, The Estée Lauder Companies

Power Move: The first female executive group president in Lauder’s history, Jane Hertzmark Hudis oversees a powerhouse group of brands including Estée Lauder and La Mer, the leaders in the global sales locomotive that is the skin care category. But it’s her vision for championing women, whether signing Amanda Gorman as global changemaker for Lauder or co-creating the company’s Women’s Leadership Network, that has earned her superstar status inside — and outside — of Lauder HQ.

Leadership Advice: “Pursue a career in an industry that you are passionate about. If you love what you do, you are more likely to succeed. It’s also important to find a mentor, one that you deeply trust who can guide you and be a sounding board as you grow and develop professionally. And remember that as you rise in your career, help lift others alongside you. The mark of a great leader is how they empower others.”

25. Denise Incandela

Executive Vice President, Apparel Division, Walmart

Power Move: Denise Incandela’s experience in the retail industry spans more than two decades. Currently, she is executive vice president of apparel and private brands at Walmart U.S., a role she was promoted to in February. In this position, she is in charge of the mass merchant’s apparel offerings in stores and online. She also oversees all private label brands across the entire general merchandise assortment, including in such categories as entertainment, toys, seasonal, home and hardlines. During her tenure at Walmart, which began in late 2017, Incandela has successfully increased the big-box retailer’s apparel presence and e-commerce capabilities, adding Bonobos and Eloquii to the online assortment. The retail executive’s résumé also includes leadership positions at Saks Fifth Avenue, Ralph Lauren and Aerosoles. Incandela currently sits on the board of advisors for The Wharton School’s Baker Retailing Center and the board for the Animal Care Centers of NYC.

26. Aurora James

Creative Director, Brother Vellies; Founder, 15 Percent Pledge

Power Move: After the death of George Floyd in May 2020, Aurora James created the 15 Percent Pledge, demanding that major retailers commit to buying 15 percent of their products from majority Black-owned businesses. Nordstrom, Bloomingdale’s, Macy’s, Hudson’s Bay, Gap, Banana Republic, Sephora, and Crate & Barrel are among those that have taken the pledge. “It’s about asking what kind of economic support they can pledge to help some of these businesses develop,” she told WWD.

Leadership Advice: “Listen and learn from those around you. Every day I’m listening to my team and other Black small business owners, learning how I can best show up, offer resources, and help move our mission forward.”

27. Stella Jean

Designer, Activist

Power Move: A vocal advocate for Black designers in the Italian fashion industry, Stella Jean has promoted inclusivity and diversity as part of her namesake clothing brand since 2011, including creating collections collaboratively with indigenous communities. After joining the Black Lives Matter protests in Italy, Jean founded We Are Made in Italy with Michelle Ngonmo and Edward Buchanan. Working to eliminate racial and cultural discrimination in fashion, WAMI launched the “We Are Made in Italy” presentation, in its third iteration this season, to bring African-born, Italian design talents to the Milan Fashion Week runways.

Leadership Advice: “Fashion is a tool of transmitting information; let’s not forget the power that it holds, power that reaches far beyond aesthetics. We must also remember that power and responsibility are two ways of expressing the same concept. It is now time for us to make our very best effort to transform what has been wielded as a supremacist tool for propaganda for too long into one of education and counter-colonization.”

“And I would add to all independent designers: Do not allow yourselves to be intimidated and don’t be afraid. This revolution started from the bottom, exactly as all the revolutions that changed the world…forever.”

28. Aya Kanai

Head of Content and Creator Partnerships, Pinterest

Power Move: Aya Kanai is head of content and creator partnerships at Pinterest and was previously editor in chief of the U.S. edition of Marie Claire magazine. Before her appointment at Marie Claire, Kanai has been Hearst Magazines’ chief fashion director since 2016, overseeing the fashion content for Cosmopolitan, Women’s Health, Seventeen and more.

Leadership Advice: “It is important to stay curious and always ask questions no matter how senior you become. Share what you may not know and where you think your team’s expertise can fill in those gaps. No one knows it all and that’s exactly how it should be.”

29. Rei Kawakubo

Creative Director, Commes des Garçons; Cofounder, Dover Street Market

Power Move: Since 1973, Rei Kawakubo has been one of the most influential designers of our era. She continues to propel the industry forward through her multiple fashion labels, as well as Dover Street Market stores, which she uses to also introduce new talent to the industry.

30. Alex Keith

Chief Executive Officer, P&G Beauty

Power Move: Occupying the top spot at P&G Beauty, Alex Keith is currently the only female chief executive officer at a top 10 beauty company. It is a position well-earned. During her tenure, Keith has re-energized P&G’s once-bloated beauty business and restored significant growth — the CPG giant was the only top five player to post a sales increase in 2020. She’s also transforming the way it does business, overseeing the creation of the Responsible Beauty platform and catapulting P&G to a leadership position in sustainability initiatives.

Leadership Advice: “My advice for emerging leaders is pretty straight-forward: Know what you want, make it known to key leaders and mentors, and be flexible on the path to get there. Each experience brings with it the opportunity to learn and grow, so every stepping stone on your path to your dream job is a chance to better yourself as a practitioner and leader, regardless of what that stepping stone is. When I look back on my assignments, leading our North American Fabric Care business was not part of my plan, but it ended up being an outstanding experience that has informed my thinking and leadership ever since.”

31. Lin Li

Founder and Creative Director, JNBY

Power Move: In 1994, Hangzhou native Lin Li founded the fashion label JNBY. She later expanded the business into a fashion powerhouse with over a dozen brands and took the company public in Hong Kong in 2016. Her group now operates more than 1,500 stores in China and more than 44 stores across 10 countries. Last year, the group unveiled its 17-building headquarters complex, the OōEli, designed by Renzo Piano in Hangzhou. It comes with an art museum, a boutique hotel, a concept store and China’s first Tsutaya Books store. Li is a lover of art and architecture. She sees fashion as a miniature version of architecture, and she has been a patron at high-profile art institutions like UCCA Beijing.

32. Natalie Massenet

Entrepreneur and Investor; Founder, Net-a-porter; Cofounder, Imaginary Ventures

Power Move: Natalie Massenet pioneered fashion e-commerce with Net-a-porter.

Leadership Advice: “Surround yourself with the best and smartest people, and paint a picture of what success looks like to help your team dream big, and to execute into the right direction. Also paint a picture of failure, so that they know what not to do.”

33. Stella McCartney

Founder and Designer, Stella McCartney; special adviser to LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton chairman and chief executive officer Bernard Arnault, and the executive committee members

Power Move: Stella McCartney refused to work with fur and animal products even when it wasn’t fashionable, and has supported mills, suppliers and manufacturers in developing sustainable materials and processes.

Leadership Advice: “I am incredibly honored to be recognized in this year’s ’50 Most Powerful Women’ alongside so many talented and inspiring female leaders. Frankly, this group is proof that we don’t just deserve a seat at the table — we should be sitting at the head of it. Since Day One with my own brand, I have believed that change requires less talk and more action. I am too accustomed to being the only woman in the room, and I know I am not alone in that.

As leaders, we must commit to putting this next generation of women’s needs first — especially as we go into an uncertain future. Globally, 5 percent of women lost their jobs because of COVID-19 compared to just 3.9 percent of men, costing us $800 billion. The jobs women work often offer low wages, few benefits and no security – all while they are expected to care for children. These factors also mean women are also disproportionately impacted by the climate crisis and, while we did not create this problem, I believe our female perspectives are essential to its solution.

Women are equipped with the strength, compassion and connection to Mother Earth today to protect our better tomorrow. As a mum to both boys and girls, I want them to live in a world where they are treated equally. To get there, we must take action now — together.”

34. Dame Pat McGrath

Makeup Artist and Founder, Pat McGrath Labs

Power Move: Pat McGrath’s creativity is unrivaled. Universally acknowledged to be the best makeup artist in the world, McGrath is also one of the most business-savvy. After spending the early part of her career advising on product development for the likes of Giorgio Armani (the foundation formulas she developed over a decade ago are still bestsellers,) McGrath struck out on her own with an eponymous line that has rewritten the rules of makeup and social media. And as the superlative-loving entrepreneur would say, there is nothing more major than that.

Leadership Advice: “Whenever someone asks me how to ‘make it’ in the fashion and beauty industry, I always tell them to never take anything personally, to work as hard as you possibly can, and never let anyone — or anything — stand in the way of your dreams. I am so fortunate that I’ve spent the last three decades creating products and images that inspire others to unleash their own artistry and manifest their inner beauty on the outside. I always try to remember that my purpose on this earth is to brighten people’s days, create joy, and make it just a little more beautiful. What ultimately keeps me going is the hope that what I’m doing inspires beauty that dares, and emboldens someone to discover their own creativity. Creativity is your best makeup skill, don’t be afraid to experiment.”

35. Virginie Morgon

Chief Executive Officer, Eurazeo

Power Move: One of very few women leaders in the still very masculine world of finance, Virginie Morgon has played a key role in accelerating investment firm Eurazeo’s diversification and growth since she joined its executive board in 2008, before being named chief executive officer in March 2018. Prior to that, she spent 16 years as an investment banker at Lazard, becoming its youngest managing senior partner in Paris in 2001. She is also vice chairman at Moncler — whose rise she helped to chart and where she stayed on after Eurazeo exited the brand in 2019, generating total proceeds of 1.4 billion euros from its investment — as well as an independent board member at L’Oréal. An advocate for diversity in leadership, she is a founding member of the Women’s Forum for Economy and Society, and is also co-chair of the Paris Committee for Human Rights Watch.

Leadership Advice: “We have the right to take risks by innovating, by making mistakes, by starting over, without fearing to fail in order to succeed.”

36. Amina Muaddi

Founder, Designer and CEO, Amina Muaddi

Power Move: Amina Muaddi is unstoppable. Even as the pandemic crippled sales of high heels for many key brands, the designer’s distinctive styles continued to resonate strongly, even while people stayed at home. And though she counts many celebrities as fans, there’s no one more loyal right now than Rihanna, who wore Muaddis’ shoes before, during and after the Met Gala last week.

Leadership Advice: “True leadership has a lot to do with being an inspiring force with a vision that motivates and mentors without necessarily being intimidating. Showing emotion, vulnerability and being honest makes those around you support and appreciate you even harder. When you genuinely love your team and work to create a better environment for them and not just for yourself, they will love you back and will give you their 100 percent every day with passion and commitment. It’s OK not to be in control of everything. You can go through hardship and face many challenges, but make it a point that you won’t give up or allow anyone else to tell you what your limits are or what you can become.”

37. Heidi O’Neill

President, Consumer and Marketplace, Nike Inc.

Power Move: Heidi O’Neill oversees more than $40 billion in revenue and is responsible for Nike’s Direct business, including all stores, e-commerce and apps globally. She also leads the Nike brand’s four geographic operating regions — and more than 40,000 employees globally.

Leadership Advice: “Authentic leadership isn’t a medal stand — it’s about moving away from the org chart and working directly within the team. It’s about knowing yourself — your voice, beliefs, values, strengths, and blind spots — and then tapping into the collective power of your team.”

38. Minjee Park

In-house Stylist, YG Entertainment

Power Move: Minjee Park is the official in-house stylist at YG Entertainment where she spearheads looks for some of K-pop’s biggest acts. Her largest focus in recent years has been on Blackpink, seen as the world’s most famous girl group. Blackpink is known for its cutting-edge fashion, which is entirely overseen by Park — who took over duties from K-pop’s other mega stylist Kyoung Won Choi circa 2018. In dressing Blackpink members Jennie, Jisoo, Lisa and Rosé, Park acts as something of a fashion power broker — helping negotiate visual identities for each girl, along with their major luxury ambassador contracts for brands like Chanel, Celine and Dior. But it’s not only the big brands that Park has her eyes on. The stylist has a quick finger on the pulse — dressing Blackpink’s members in an assortment of up-and-coming brands in between their major fashion house obligations. Dressing the girls in looks by Charles Jeffrey Loverboy, Vaquera and Khaite, among others, continues to help move a crucial needle for independent labels.

39. Anne Pitcher

Managing Director, Selfridges Group

Power Move: Anne Pitcher has redefined department store retail for a digital, experiential and environmentally aware age.

Leadership Advice: “Leading Selfridges Group is about creating joyful experiences for our customers, teams and our local communities. Never has that felt more important, so I am looking forward to building a sustainable future for our teams, our customers and for our business.”

40. Miuccia Prada

Co-Chief Executive Officer and Co-Creative Director, Prada

Power Move: Miuccia Prada has long been considered one of the most intellectual and influential designers in the fashion industry, but her scope has extended to the arts. Setting up the Fondazione Prada with her husband and co-CEO Patrizio Bertelli, she has helped fuel the cultural conversation in Milan and in the foundation’s site in Venice, attracting artists from around the world. She designs to the beat of her own drum, with a distinct aesthetic, while audaciously experimenting with new concepts every season. Prada enjoys the company of her artistic friends, many also hailing from the world of architecture and design, and she was so confident and open-minded that she had no qualms about tapping Raf Simons in 2020 as co-creative director of the Prada brand, saying that she felt the need to reinforce the creativity in her company.

41. Rihanna

Founder and Chief Executive Officer, Fenty Beauty

Power Move: Her Instagram handle may be Badgalriri, but when it comes to matters of fashion, beauty (and music, of course), Rihanna can do no wrong. After creating a foundation revolution, Fenty Beauty continues to break new ground in beauty, most recently introducing skin care. Fashion-wise, the megastar paused her luxury maison with LVMH last year, all the better to focus on her Savage x Fenty lingerie, backed with $115 million in new funding from a panoply of investors including L Catterton, Jay-Z’s Marcy Venture Partners and Sunley House Capital, part of Advent International.

42. Holli Rogers

Chair, Browns; Chief Brand Officer, Farfetch

Power Move: Holli Rogers has married digital with physical retail as head of Browns, and continues to bring them closer together.

Leadership Advice: “I don’t think there’s one piece of advice, but more a mind-set and approach. I’m a big believer in the power of curiosity — the more curious you are, the more you learn — about the business or industry you’re in, about your customer and importantly, about the people who you work with. Curiosity is about openness — to people and new ideas, to change – and seeing it as exciting rather than scary — to sharing your values and aligning with others, and about knowing you don’t have to be an expert in everything — you can always learn more.”

43. Julie Sariñana

Influencer; Founder, Color Dept.

Power Move: One of the original fashion bloggers, Julie Sariñana has amassed more than 6 million followers on Instagram. She has parlayed her social media prowess into a fashion label, collaborations with companies such as Bandier and, most recently, a vegan nail polish brand, Color Dept.

Leadership Advice: “Leadership is believing that you have the power to inspire, create change, and have a positive impact on others. It’s about trusting your instincts, and believing in yourself through the small victories, as well as the milestones. Trust your vision, and continue to believe in your story.”

44. Elizabeth Spaulding

Chief Executive Officer, Stitch Fix

Power Move: Elizabeth Spaulding joined Stitch Fix as president in 2020 to focus on driving the next phase of the company’s growth, including direct buy capabilities and international expansion efforts. Prior to Stitch Fix, Spaulding was global head and founder of the Digital Practice at Bain & Company, where she was a partner and served on the board. During her tenure at Bain, she supported clients in digital transformations, with a particular focus on consumer and technology sectors, and led the firm’s efforts to continually evolve and grow new capabilities through partnerships and M&A. She additionally supported Bain’s pro bono and social impact efforts, a passion she brings to Stitch Fix.

Leadership Advice: “Stay focused on the possibilities and vision of the future. There will be highs and lows, but try to enjoy the journey you’re on with the people you’re on it with. If your optimism is running low, find ways to re-energize yourself. For me, that’s spending more time with the team — visiting our warehouses, talking to our stylists and learning from our tech team members fills me with appreciation and renewed energy, and reminds me that great ideas and innovation are happening in every corner of our business.”

45. Diane Sullivan

Chairman and CEO, Caleres Inc.

Power Move: As the longtime force at the center of Caleres Inc., Diane Sullivan has built a roster of diverse brands from Sam Edelman to Allen Edmonds to Vionic — and she continues to bolster the 60-year-old Famous Footwear chain. The family retailer drove Caleres’ explosive growth in the second quarter as the chain saw its highest level of Q2 sales in its history, at about $454 million.

Leadership Advice: “Don’t think about what you want to change, but think about where you want to go.”

46. Sonia Syngal

Chief Executive Officer, Gap Inc.

Power Move: Since March 2020, Sonia Syngal has led the $16 million business across all geographies and channels overseeing a team of nearly 130,000 employees. She was hired to lead the company into its next chapter. A dynamic leader, Syngal is known for leading with both vision and heart and is an excellent operator who drives innovation and decisive action.

Leadership Advice: “It’s important to eliminate the noise, get rid of the clutter, and avoid getting caught in the headlines. I focus my energy on the possibilities based on the trendline data.”

47. Virginie Viard

Creative Director, Chanel

Power Move: Virginie Viard has continued the legacies of Gabrielle Chanel and Karl Lagerfeld by reimagining the label’s classic take on women’s wear. She has brought the works of female artists and artisans, as well as a youthful and feminine spirit, to the forefront.

48. Karla Welch

Stylist; Founder, Period; Cofounder, Wishi

Power Move: In her nearly 20 years as a stylist, Karla Welch has worked her magic on Hollywood celebrities, Olympic athletes and politicos. At the Met Gala alone, she styled Justin Bieber, Hailey Bieber, Rose from Blackpink, Lorde, Ava DuVernay, Naomi Osaka, Karlie Kloss, Tracee Ellis Ross and Megan Rapinoe. An in-demand collaborator, she’s been tapped by Levi’s, Express and Eddie Bauer, among others, and has made her political voice part of her personal brand.

Leadership Advice: “You can’t do it all. Build a team.”

49. Kim Kardashian West

Founder, Skims, KKW Beauty

Power Move: The latest launch in a career of entertainment and entrepreneurial pursuits, Kim Kardashian West’s inclusive lingerie brand Skims has been a runaway success, racking up $145 million in revenue in 2020 and forecasted to exceed $300 million in 2021. In April, Skims raised $154 million in a Series A funding round from venture capital group Thrive to fuel growth, after receiving a valuation of $1.6 billion. Part of the brand’s success is fueled by Kardashian West’s social media presence; she speaks to 255 million on Instagram and can still shut down a red carpet, as she did at the 2021 Met Gala with her Balenciaga blackout head-to-toe T-shirt look.

Leadership Advice: “Trust your instincts. This is such a key component of all decisions for me — I always evaluate the pros and cons of a situation, but at the end of the day my intuition is the north star.”

50. Wendy Yang

President, Performance Lifestyle Group, Deckers Brands

Power Move: Few athletic brands have seen growth like Hoka One One, where Wendy Yang and her team are eyeing $1 billion in sales. They’re well on their way: Hoka’s overall Q2 revenue increased 95 percent to $213.1 million, and the fast-growing running brand accounted for nearly 40 percent of parent company Deckers’ total revenue.

Daniel Arsham Just Reimagined Tiffany’s Iconic Blue Box For the Release of the American Jewelry Brand’s New Knot Collection - artnet News,"Mon, 13 Sep 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vbmV3cy5hcnRuZXQuY29tL2FydC13b3JsZC90aWZmYW55LWRhbmllbC1hcnNoYW0tMjAwODMyMdIBSGh0dHBzOi8vbmV3cy5hcnRuZXQuY29tL2FydC13b3JsZC90aWZmYW55LWRhbmllbC1hcnNoYW0tMjAwODMyMS9hbXAtcGFnZQ?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Less than a year into his new role as Tiffany’s executive vice president of product and communications, the 29-year-old LVMH scion Alexandre Arnault is already shaking things up in more ways than one.

In the last few months, the 184-year-old American jewelry house has undergone the start of what looks to be an exciting rebrand: rolling out campaigns featuring cross-armed models sporting chunky cuffs from Elsa Perretti’s collection beside bold signage that reads “Not Your Mother’s Tiffany,” securing Beyoncé and Jay-Z as brand ambassadors—and, most recently, debuting a limited-edition bracelet and sculpture for the company’s new Knot collection, conceived by none other than artist Daniel Arsham.

The lattermost news is especially interesting. Tiffany has a long history of collaborating with artists—including Andy Warhol, who created playful Christmas cards for the brand for several years, beginning in 1956, and Robert Rauschenberg, who around the same time teamed up with fellow artist Jasper Johns to adorn the company’s Fifth Avenue flagship windows with enchanting displays—but this is perhaps the first time that Tiffany has given an artist the reigns to design arguably the starriest piece of a new collection.

Not only that, but Arsham was also asked to reinterpret Tiffany’s most recognizable piece of iconography: the Tiffany Blue Box.

The box was originally conceived in 1852 and features that unmistakable robin’s-egg blue, selected as the company’s signature hue because of turquoise jewelry’s popularity in the 19th century. The stone became all the rage following the wedding of Queen Victoria, who gifted her bridal attendants dove-shaped brooches cut from turquoise as mementos.

When Tiffany began to assume popularity itself, the boxes became so popular that the brand had to advertise to the public that they were not, in fact, available for sale on their own, and could only be acquired with an actual purchase. In 1906, a reporter for the New York Sun wrote a cheeky column on the box craze—customers were reportedly walking into Tiffany’s flagship asking for boxes alone, presumably to use to gift other jewelry and objets d’art—and remarked, “Tiffany has one thing in stock that you cannot not buy of him for as much money as you may offer; he will only give it to you. And that is one of his boxes.”

Taking this cultural history into account, Arsham conceived the Bronze Eroded Tiffany Blue Box, a 49-piece sculpture which houses a special-edition white gold bracelet whose knot is covered entirely in diamonds and tsavorite, a green gemstone from Kenya that Tiffany first introduced to the world in 1974.

The box will additionally become part of Arsham’s “Future Relics” series, in which the artist re-contextualizes contemporary objects and signifiers of the present culture through the lens of an imagined future in which they are excavated and preserved as artifacts of the past.

Arsham’s box’s color—sporting patina over the eroded bronze material and the look of wear and tear over many years—has admittedly changed a bit, edging a little closer to Arsham Studio’s signature hue (in one interview, he dubbed it “Tiffany Green”), while also recalling archival images of Tiffany’s earliest boxes which, after years of aging, do appear slightly more green. In many ways, the shift reflects Arsham’s desire to link the brand’s present and future to its past.

“I always gravitate towards items that are immediately culturally recognizable,” Arsham said in a statement. “The Tiffany Blue Box has that power. I wanted to address it in a way different than how it was originally intended by giving it a distressed, aged quality which represents its history, how much of a fixture it is in our world today, and how it will continue to be relevant in decades, even centuries, from now.”

Additionally, at the Tiffany flagship on Fifth Avenue, an interactive, supersize version of the sculpture has been installed and is available for visitors to enter and experience.

"Resellers are helping make Louis Vuitton sustainable, CEO says - Better Life","Thu, 23 Sep 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjbXAuY29tL2xpZmVzdHlsZS9mYXNoaW9uLWJlYXV0eS9hcnRpY2xlLzMxNDkzOTQvY2VvLXdvcmxkcy1sYXJnZXN0LWx1eHVyeS1icmFuZC13aWxsaW5nLXRyYWRlLWdyb3d0aNIBcmh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLnNjbXAuY29tL2xpZmVzdHlsZS9mYXNoaW9uLWJlYXV0eS9hcnRpY2xlLzMxNDkzOTQvY2VvLXdvcmxkcy1sYXJnZXN0LWx1eHVyeS1icmFuZC13aWxsaW5nLXRyYWRlLWdyb3d0aA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Sustainability in fashion is a fraught topic. After all, how can an industry built on the idea of constant newness be sustainable?

A veteran of LVMH with successful stints at brands such as Dior, Fendi and Bulgari, Burke is today focusing on making Louis Vuitton sustainable.

Louis Vuitton – the top brand at LVMH, the largest luxury group in the world – may have fared well during a major global economic disruption caused by the coronavirus pandemic, but chief executive Michael Burke is not resting on his laurels.

When luxury brands release new collections at least six times a year, not to mention “drops” and “capsules” to satisfy ever-hungry customers, it’s easy to fall prey to greenwashing and see sustainability initiatives as PR stunts.

Louis Vuitton has, until now, been very cautious when it comes to making broad statements about sustainability. However, it has just released a report with “meaningful and measurable percentage changes, which we were not able to do before”, as Burke explains in an interview.

The brand has the ambitious goal of cutting carbon emissions by 50 per cent by 2030 through initiatives such as the elimination of single-use plastic in its packaging, and the reuse or recycling of all materials used for events and window displays.

The LV Trainer Upcycling collection is part of a sustainable upcycling strategy aiming to optimise the use of existing materials.

“We’re very cognisant that it is the key subject for the next 20 to 30 years and we also realised that we’re not going to be around to see the returns of this investment in nature, so it’s very different from what we do on our daily basis as a public company, which is to produce results,” says Burke.

“This is a completely different animal. Up until very recently, it was very difficult – if not impossible – to create measurable results that we agree on and that are not biased. We feel very engaged and want to be committed in the long term, and every employee is proud to be involved, so it’s not a PR activity.”

LVMH recorded revenue of €28.7 billion (US$33.6 billion) in the first half of 2021, up 56 per cent compared with the same period in 2020. Organic revenue growth was 53 per cent compared with 2020 and 11 per cent compared with 2019. This was due in no small part to the success of Louis Vuitton and its sister brand Dior, which thanks to strategic price rises and increased spending power among the world’s wealthy have managed to thrive at a time of economic uncertainty.

“Luxury’s primary objective is not top-line growth; that’s a consequence of a luxury strategy,” says Burke when asked about the challenge of balancing growth with sustainability.

“A luxury strategy will generate growth. Why? It’s very simple. It’s based on many people in the world improving their life standards. [Sustainability] may cost us some short-term growth but we’re not interested in [that],” he says, adding that LVMH chairman and chief executive Bernard Arnault has always said he is not concerned with top-line profits in any given year.

“Long-term growth; that’s the rule we live by.”

Like other top luxury brands such as Hermès and Chanel, Louis Vuitton is able to control every step of the supply chain, from “cows grazing in France and alligators in Florida to the final products”, explains Burke.

He says that, unlike 20 years ago, when the life of a Louis Vuitton bag was limited, its lifespan is now much longer thanks to technology such as blockchain and to the sharing economy.

“Today, a Vuitton bag gets resold three times in its lifetime. People buy and then resell ,” says Burke. “Some think it’s horrible, but I think it’s gratifying because it proves that you can have growth and be sustainable.”

The Felt line from Louis Vuitton features bags designed using several eco-responsible materials.

Young consumers in the West have for the most part embraced the sharing economy and sustainability, but what about China, now the largest luxury market in the world and a key driver in consumption of luxury goods – even more so during the pandemic?

“There are different ways to get to the same goal,” says Burke. “In the West, it may start earlier but it’s messier; in the East, it may start later but it’s more organised. We’re going to do [things] differently but we’ll end up in the same place.”

Burke is not a fan of the phrase “revenge shopping”, which describes the pent-up demand that brands have seen from Chinese customers who – unable to travel abroad because of Covid-19 restrictions – have been spending heavily on luxury goods at home.

“I think it’s demeaning to our clients,” says Burke. “It’s a demeaning term that describes amazing growth in purchasing but it’s not because of revenge. Yes, we experienced tremendous growth in Asia but it’s mostly repatriation, on-shoring – and granted, it’s not as sexy as saying ‘revenge shopping’.”

In August 2020, Louis Vuitton hosted its spring/summer 2021 menswear show in Shanghai instead of Paris, a decision that Burke made out of necessity but that also allowed the brand to reduce its carbon footprint.

“It would have generated thousands of people going to Paris,” says Burke, “but the pandemic allowed us to find the silver lining, [which] was that we could create closer engagement with our clients by going to them.

“We didn’t want to cancel the show. We had the props travelling, which was good because they had multiple uses. Nobody from Paris went to China, zero people. The carbon footprint of the show was a fraction of what it would have been years ago.”

Catering to local clients has been a hot topic during the pandemic. Amid travel bans, tourist-driven markets such as Britain, France, Italy, Hong Kong and Singapore, whose luxury stores have always relied on a steady influx of shoppers from China and other emerging markets, have had to pivot to the previously forgotten local customer – but Burke says Louis Vuitton has always paid attention to such customers.

“The tourist client is always local initially; that’s our mantra,” says Burke. “Our business model is to develop a relationship first with our clients in their local environment and only then do we try to satisfy their needs when they’re travelling.”

“People go to Paris, London or Tokyo and see a line outside the Vuitton store and say, ‘Here we go again, all they have to do is open a store and people will wait in line to buy’. They don’t see that we have been engaging with that person for 20-30 years back home.”

Hong Kong, however, is in a tricky spot. The city, long reliant on a constant influx of Chinese tourists, has been significantly affected by the pandemic, leading a number of brands, including Louis Vuitton , to reduce their retail footprint. Burke believes that retail in Hong Kong will remain healthy but has to be the right size, especially amid the growth of nearby locations such as Macau, Sanya and Shenzhen.

“As long as Hong Kong remains different it will remain a very important hub, but if it turns into an average Chinese city, why go to Hong Kong?” says Burke. “It’s that simple. If Beijing maintains a special status for Hong Kong as long as possible, that will generate wealth for everybody. The question is, how do you define special and different looking forward?”

A long-time observer of China, Burke is positive about the future of the country and its global role. He sees fashion as playing a pivotal part in the cultural exchange between China and the rest of the world, as the Fendi show on the Great Wall – which he was responsible for 14 years ago – showed.

Looking back at that landmark event, which happened just ahead of the 2008 Beijing Olympics, he recalls that to make it happen he held countless discussions with officials in Beijing. Ultimately, both sides saw the show as a moment when China would project a new image to the outside world.

“At the end of the day, it’s about sustainable beauty and every consumer relates to that,” says Burke.

“Louis Vuitton has always been the first to go into markets, as we believe commerce is a positive force between cultures and nations. Nations engaging in commerce with each other get along better than those who don’t.”

Is LVMH betting on hip-hop culture? - Retail Gazette,"Mon, 13 Sep 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldGFpbGdhemV0dGUuY28udWsvYmxvZy8yMDIxLzA5L2lzLWx2bWgtYmV0dGluZy1vbi1oaXAtaG9wLWN1bHR1cmUv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"As luxury brands shift focus from older, more financially established consumers to those under 25, many are turning to hip hop icons to earn credibility with their new audience.

It’s becoming more evident that Louis Vuitton and Tiffany & Co owner LVMH is attracted to hip hop culture, particularly after its latest campaign featuring rapper Jay Z and Beyoncé.

Last month, Tiffany revealed a new campaign about modern love featuring the celebrity couple with a Basquiat painting as a backdrop. Titled Equals Pi (1982), the long-unseen turquoise painting is meant to recall the luxury retailer’s signature shade of blue.

In the Tiffany ad, Beyoncé wears an all-black diamond-studded Balmain look inspired by Audrey Hepburn’s dress in the 1961 film Breakfast at Tiffany’s. Jay Z, meanwhile, is outfitted in clothes intended to mimic Basquiat’s outfit when he appeared on the cover of New York Magazine in 1985.

Luxury conglomerate LVMH acquired Tiffany at the start of the year, and restructured the management and creative teams in a revamping of the historic jewellery house.

As part of the collaboration with Beyoncé and Jay Z, Tiffany pledged to give $2 million dollars to fund scholarship and internship programs for Historically Black Colleges and Universities.

Earlier this year, LVMH’s Moet Hennessy bought a 50 per cent stake in Armand de Brignac, a Champagne producer owned by Jay Z, another sign of a close relationship between the luxury industry and hip hop culture.

In July, LVMH bought a 60 per cent stake in luxury streetwear brand Off-White, as it doubled down on the Pied Piper of fashion, Virgil Abloh’s fashion reign.

This investment boosted LVMH deeper into the sportswear markets with ties to its unrivalled roster of brands.

Hip hop is undoubtedly a powerful tool for reaching Generations Y and Z, who are expected to account for 45 per cent of the global luxury spend by 2025, according to Bain & Company.

Despite the Covid-19 pandemic affecting the luxury sector, LVMH has reported revenue of £24.5 billion in the first half of the year, up 56 per cent compared with the same period last year.

The French conglomerate said this was due to accelerated growth in the second quarter of the year, during which organic revenue increase by 14 per cent compared with eight per cent in the first quarter.

Luxury marketplace HushHush founder, Mark Pearson told Retail Gazette that the integration of streetwear and hip hop culture into the luxury industry is not showing any sign of slowing down.

“When LVMH enlisted Virgil Abloh as a creative menswear designer for Louis Vuitton back in 2018, they drew an emblematic line in the sand, giving streetwear brands and designers a seat at the highly monopolised luxury fashion table,” he said.

“This was the first stage of LVMH’s incorporation into ‘hip hop culture’, and since then they’ve continued to invest in this future vision for the company, while still maintaining extremely high levels of success and growth.

“The corporation is certainly betting on hip hop culture to drive growth, but this isn’t a bad bet by any stretch.”

Sophie Hillier, Fashion Business and Promotion lecturer at Birmingham City University argued that celebrity choices for luxury brands are becoming “extremely outdated”.

“Celebrity culture has changed hugely and it doesn’t necessarily have the pull anymore,” she told Retail Gazette.

“I was quite surprised to see Beyoncé and Jay Z as the face of Tiffany recently and thought personally it was a very dated choice.

“Consumers today are demanding brands to be more engaging and relatable and look to other types of ‘influencers’ more than celebrities.

“I believe that major designer brands need to look at updating their marketing strategy and research who their consumers actually want to see wearing their brands.”

Pearson said LVMH needs to be opportunistic in order to become successful as a corporation.

“However, the difficulty many brands face is striking a balance between opportunism, and ensuring they don’t ‘sell out’ and lose integrity and reputation through poor commercial partnerships,” he said.

“This is done through careful collaborations with celebrity ambassadors – the affiliation with Jay-Z makes sense, based on LVMH’s recent strategic decisions.”

Meanwhile, retail expert Nelson Blackley said LVMH and other luxury conglomerates risk losing credibility by relying on hip hop celebrities.

“There is a risk they may lose some credibility with their traditional customer, but LVMH are sensibly looking to ‘future proof’ their brands in a world where it is predicted that younger consumer will account for 45 per cent of global luxury market by 2025,” he said.

“These moves by luxury conglomerates are simply reflecting the shifting attitudes of affluent consumers towards experiences and digital and of course the impact of social media platforms, in particular Instagram.”

It is evident that streetwear culture has become mainstream and many luxury fashion retailers are shifting their framing to accommodate this.

Fashion is very much based on trends and waves, so retailers look to capitalise on these trends and then get out as quickly as possible as to not become dated.

While LVMH is using hip-hop to remain relevant, this doesn’t have a huge impact on it’s economic growth.

Another thing to take into account is that the young Gen Z market grew up on hip-hop being seen as popular culture, so as their spending capabilities come into full fruition, these retailers are going to need to partner and invest in streetwear in order to keep their attention.

"Kenzo taps ex-Bape designer Nigo, with Virgil Abloh's blessing - Vogue Business","Wed, 15 Sep 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZvZ3VlYnVzaW5lc3MuY29tL2NvbXBhbmllcy9rZW56by10YXBzLWV4LWJhcGUtZGVzaWduZXItbmlnby13aXRoLXZpcmdpbC1hYmxvaHMtYmxlc3NpbmfSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"To receive the Vogue Business newsletter, sign up here.

LVMH is reconfiguring Kenzo, with a new CEO pulled from budget lingerie chain Undiz and a new artistic director, Nigo, the Japanese designer and DJ, in the first sign of Virgil Abloh’s impact on the wider LVMH group.



Chief executive Sylvie Colin is exiting the LVMH-owned brand and Sylvain Blanc, who was most recently CEO of mass market lingerie chain Undiz, is succeeding her, according to a statement. Tomoaki Nagao, known as Nigo will start on 21 September, succeeding Felipe Oliveira Baptista who left in June 2021 after just three seasons. The Japanese designer, DJ and entrepreneur founded and sold streetwear brand Bape, co-created the Billionaire Boys Club brand with Pharrell Williams and most recently launched the brand Human Made. Both Abloh and Williams posted on Instagram to congratulate the designer. “Ascend! Ascend! Ascend! Cheers general,” Williams commented. Carol Lim who was at the creative helm of Kenzo together with Humberto Leon prior to Baptista also applauded him via the social media platform.

“The arrival of an extremely talented Japanese designer will allow us to write a new page in the history of the house that Kenzo Takada founded. I am convinced that the creativity and innovation of Nigo as well as his attachment to the history of the house will fully express all the potential of Kenzo,” LVMH fashion group chairman and CEO Sidney Toledano said in a statement.

Nigo has ties to Virgil Abloh, the artistic director of Louis Vuitton men’s who recently took on a much more collaborative and prominent role inside LVMH. The two collaborated on a capsule collection, LV², which also released a pre-Spring 2022 collection. The collection featured a duck festooned with the “LV Made” logo. In July, LVMH announced that it would be deepening its relationship with Abloh, launching new brands and partnering with existing ones. LVMH Toledano said incoming CEO Sylvain Blanc will be tasked with “opening a new chapter” for Kenzo, in an internal memo seen by Vogue Business. The hiring of a CEO from a fast fashion lingerie brand Undiz, known for weekly product drops and collaborations, could offer clues. Kenzo’s emblematic Tiger sweatshirts currently start at £195."

The “Towards a Dream” campaign, which was launched this week, was shot by Dutch artist and frequent Louis Vuitton collaborator Vivian Sassen and aims to highlight and celebrate the art of travel.

“As if in a reverie, silhouettes of children emerge from these richly contrasting landscapes, and one’s imagination takes flight between past, present and future,” the company wrote in a press release.

“Young school children enthusiastically venture into the heart of nature, transforming its grandiosity into a playground of discovery,” the statement continued. “Utterly innocent, they optimistically embody a future where anything is possible.”

The campaign was shot on the Greek island of Milos, which was recently named the best island in the world by Travel & Leisure Magazine, along with Petra and Wadi Rum in Jordan and Mont Saint-Michel in France.

It’s the second major promotion of Greece by a fashion brand belonging to the LVMH Group in just a few months. In June, another LVMH brand, Christian Dior, hosted their 2022 cruise show in Athens at the Panathenaic Stadium.

Sephora makes major investment in Mexico's booming beauty market - Cosmetics Business,"Thu, 16 Sep 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vY29zbWV0aWNzYnVzaW5lc3MuY29tL3NlcGhvcmEtbWFrZXMtbWFqb3ItaW52ZXN0bWVudC1pbi1tZXhpY28tcy1ib29taW5nLWJlYXV0eS1tYXJrZXQtLTE3OTIzNNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Sephora, the LVMH-owned beauty retail giant, is betting on Mexico’s lucrative beauty market with a major investment.

In an interview with Forbes Mexico, Darío Aguilar, the CEO of Sephora’s Mexican business, said that despite the ‘roller coaster’ year it has experienced, the retailer will back expansion in the region with a MX$150m (US$7.5m) investment.

The funds are earmarked for five new stores, expected to open by the end of 2021.

“Mexico is a very competitive market for Sephora in Latin America; along with Brazil, it is one of the most important in beauty, which is why it is very important to continue to have a presence and continue to grow,” he told the publication.

Mexico’s beauty and personal care market, worth US$8.4bn in 2021, is expected to grow annually 5% up to 2025, data from Statista shows, with 12% of total revenues generated through online sales.

Covid-19 has also accelerated Mexico’s e-commerce, according to the Mexican Association of Online Sales, which said the country’s online retail market has advanced a decade since 2020, growing 81% compared with 2019.

And Sephora is capitalising on the digital revolution with online sales representing 30% of sales, up 20% on the year before.

“We not only want to continue entering physical stores but also e-commerce where we have investment plans for 70m pesos,” added Aguilar.

“We have already invested a lot in our platform and what we are doing is promoting updates and in the future we will be incorporating new features, such as augmented reality to test the virtual training products, and we launched our app a week ago in Mexico.”"

The takeover, announced in July, is thought to have valued the pure-play online beauty seller at £132m.

“We are delighted to welcome Feelunique teams within the Sephora family,” said Mark Brok, President and CEO of the retail giant.

“Feelunique is known for their unparalleled customer experience, deep e-commerce expertise and knowledge of the UK consumer.

“We look forward to learning from each other and writing a new chapter together.”

Since its creation in 2005 by tech entrepreneurs Aaron Chatterly and Richard Schiessl, Feelunique has become one the UK’s go-to online retailers for prestige beauty, competing with the likes of The Hut Group’s Cult Beauty and Lookfantastic sites, as well as Beauty Bay.

To date, the platform has more than 1.3 million active users with some 35,000 cosmetic and fragrance products from more than 800 brands, including Chanel, Gucci, Huda Beauty and Pat McGrath Labs.

In its latest financial report, Feelunique is forecast to make sales of £100m this year, following a turbulent 2020, which saw the company make a loss of £5m.

Its CEO Sarah Miles added: “Sephora is an iconic retailer in the prestige beauty space in Europe.

“We are looking forward to working together and leveraging our respective strengths to drive the prestige beauty segment in the UK.”

The takeover marks a major investment in the UK digital beauty market for Sephora, one of the world’s largest bricks-and-mortar retailers, boasting 2,600 stores across 35 countries."
"Designer Nensi Dojaka On Her Spring 2022 Collection, Winning The LVMH Prize, & More - NYLON","Mon, 20 Sep 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55bG9uLmNvbS9mYXNoaW9uL25lbnNpLWRvamFrYS1kZXNpZ25lci1zcHJpbmctMjAyMi1jb2xsZWN0aW9u0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Nensi Dojaka thinks she’s seen pretty much every image from the ’90s now. The London-based Albanian designer has often drawn from the era in the creation of her wispy little party dresses that, beautiful and barely-there, first caught the eye of the fashion industry back in 2019 when they were shown in Central Saint Martins’ MA showcase in London.

“I actually had an image from the ’60s this time, which has nothing to do with my aesthetic,” explains Dojaka the day after her first solo London Fashion Week show, her Spring 2022 collection, which took place on Friday afternoon. “It was super random, but there was this flower detail that I really liked; maybe I should develop this.”

The graphic bloom appeared as a central motif on tights, stockings, and tailoring or as a clever twist of mesh across stomachs and thighs of her draped and deconstructed looks. Dojaka had wanted to expand upon her boudoir-esque offering, which she describes as “minimal but intricate,” adding something more casual and accessible. Tailored jackets provided a contrast to the very feminine and very delicate pieces: dresses pieced together from silk, tulle, organic georgette, organza, and lightweight wools.

Jean Campbell and Lindsey Wixson were among the models who took to the catwalk in the Old Selfridges Hotel show space just off Oxford Street in central London, with Sabrina Elba sitting front row. “[It was] more pressure than I thought after the LVMH Prize, but it was great,” recalls Dojaka of her independent sojourn. Previously, she had shown her collections via the talent incubator program Fashion East, whose alumni include Kim Jones, Simone Rocha, and Wales Bonner.

It was earlier in the month of September when the designer experienced another major career coup: scooping said 2021 LVMH Prize, a prestigious industry accolade — judged by Virgil Abloh, Jonathan Anderson, Maria Grazia Chiuri, Marc Jacobs, Kim Jones, and Stella McCartney, and from which she receives a 300,000-euro endowment. She describes winning as being “unexpected, emotional, a lot of feelings, even now.” And explains: “I’m trying not to be over-excited and, you know, keep my feet on the ground, take one step at a time because it’s very important to… you can fly too quick.”

Dojaka, whose namesake brand boasts such celebrity fans as Rihanna, Dua Lipa, Bella Hadid, and more, didn’t ever intend to become a fashion designer per se. “I was always drawing because my parents were sending me to drawing classes; that meant I was always doing some form of art,” she says. “But then when I did the foundation at Saint Martins, the tutors suggested that I study lingerie because I was always doing these tiny things.” Which is an apt description of her now signature dainty bra dresses.

She next went to London College of Fashion in 2013, where she would learn the technicalities of lingerie. It’s an element that makes her designs stand out, exacting in their fit and elegance. Sensuality, not sexuality, is a key word for Dojaka.

In 2017, she headed to Central Saint Martins for the MA. “They were completely different to be honest,” she says of the two fashion schools, which are both well-known for their own specialisms. It was the combination of the two that worked to provide the perfect grounding for what would become Dojaka’s eponymous label — even though, that too, was never originally on the cards.

“It was not so dreamy at first,” she says of her journey. Meaning it was more pragmatic than it was whimsical. Such was the success of her MA collection that Dojaka received orders from Montreal-based online retailer Ssense. The best way to fulfill them was to launch a label, for which she received support also from the British Fashion Council. “And then it just happened,” she explains. The designer was soon picked up by Fashion East, and her stockist list would continue to grow. “When you start something and you invest your soul in it, you just have to make it happen.” (On Monday, just a few days after her LVMH Prize win and her runway show in London, Ssense announced the release of an exclusive collection by the designer.)

It helps that Dojaka is nothing if not pragmatic herself. When I ask her about the newly revealed Spring 2022 collection, she’s already evaluating how it could be better, what she could improve, and what she’ll do next time. She thinks something was missing, maybe accessories (there would certainly be a huge demand for them). “I’m still taking one step at a time,” she says. “So, next season, maybe I’ll add only one new thing but not everything because it’s better to do it slow and right.”

She has also found a friend and confidante in the designer Alessandro Dell’Acqua, with whom a collaboration was recently announced. Dojaka will create a capsule collection interpreting his No.21 brand’s codes. “He’s just the nicest person,” she says. “I was always looking at his work and I was always following him, and then when he started writing to me, of course it felt really special.”

The pandemic, she says, has made her stronger professionally and personally. “I definitely feel like I’ve changed completely. I was shy, completely not confident, and now, I mean, I got through all of this, I can talk about it.”

That said, like most designers, she’s still not keen on having her picture taken or taking her bow at the end of the show — albeit to a whooping and cheering audience, who very clearly delighted in this debut."
Who Is Fashion Designer Nensi Dojaka? - WWD,"Tue, 07 Sep 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3dkLmNvbS9mYXNoaW9uLW5ld3MvZmFzaGlvbi1zY29vcHMvd2hvLWlzLW5lbnNpLWRvamFrYS1mYXNoaW9uLWRlc2lnbmVyLWx2bWgtcHJpemUtMTIzNDkxMTYyOS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Nensi Dojaka has already become a favorite of many celebrities over the last year, and now the fashion designer is expected to grow even more in popularity thanks to her latest accolade.

The Albanian women’s wear designer is the recipient of the 2021 LVMH Prize for Young Designers, which she was awarded at a star-studded ceremony in Paris on Tuesday. The award was presented by French actress Isabelle Huppert and the prize’s jury members consisted of Dior men’s artistic director Kim Jones; Louis Vuitton men’s artistic director and Off-White designer Virgil Abloh; Stella McCartney; Marc Jacobs, and Loewe artistic director Jonathan Anderson.

Dojaka, who is based in London, is a graduate of Central Saint Martins where she launched her namesake label in 2017. She received her bachelor’s and master’s degrees from the university. During her studies, she interned for designer brands like Peter Pilotto and Fyodor Golan.

After showing her graduate collection two years later, she created a capsule collection with Ssense and was selected to show as part of the emerging designer support platform, Fashion East.

She was also selected for the first edition of the mentorship program launched last fall by fashion designer Alessandro Dell’Acqua and Tomorrow London, which helped her get 30 points of sale across the world.

The designer is known for her lingerie-inspired dresses and cutout pieces that reference ’90s aesthetics. She takes inspiration from designers like Helmut Lang and Ann Demeulemeester for her looks. Her designs have been worn by several major celebrities in the last year, including Emily Ratajkowski, Sophie Turner, Emma Corrin, Carey Mulligan and Bella Hadid, who wore a look from Dojaka’s fall 2020 collection at the MTV Video Music Awards last year.

Dojaka’s pieces are sold at Ssense, Selfridges, Farfetch, LuisaViaRoma, Mytheresa and other retailers and boutiques.

Dojaka beat roughly 1,900 applicants from 110 countries for the award, which comes with a prize of 300,000 euros and a year of coaching from experts at LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton. The designer plans to use the prize money to expand her team and focus on production. She recently started working with a new factory in Italy and is using more sustainable fabrics.

The designer is showing her next collection during the upcoming London fashion week, presenting her first fashion show on Sept. 17.

“When I started, I had a very young customer base, and now with the collection developing with a bit more tailoring and stronger looks, it’s shifting a bit, so it’s a wider audience and I want to make it a lot more versatile,” Dojaka told WWD after winning the prize. “Now, I will have even more opportunity to develop stuff.”

Those waiting with bated breath can now count the hours to the opening of one of Paris’ most luxurious hotels yet. A short distance from Notredame Cathedral and the Arc de Triomphe, and overlooking the river Seine, the LMVH-owned Cheval Blanc will open doors tomorrow (September 7).





The new ‘quintessentially urban resort’ is located by Pont Neuf and is set within the historic premises of La Samaritaine, an iconic building in the city that had remained shut for 16 years and recently reopened after a massive renovation.



The LMVH-backed renovation project cost nearly $1bn welcomed its luxury department store this June and took the top position of the world’s most expensive department stores.

Chaval Blanc Paris brings more exclusivity to this address designed to offer a new level of sophistication to the city, which it hasn’t seen so far.



French architect Edouard François, known for creating environmentally-friendly buildings, worked on the exteriors while American designer Peter Marino designed the interiors.



Marino is no stranger in the fashion industry, having designed several LMVH stores designed the hotel keeping in mind a Parisian apartment.



Opening at a time when tourism is affected in the city, this hotel has already defined its clientele as high-net-worth clients who are keen on ‘experiential luxury.’



Allow us to take you on a visual guide of what will be on offer and sit back to let you be convinced of the exclusivity and grandeur of this spectacular property.

Chaval Blanc Paris will feature around 600 painters, sculptors, furniture makers, lantern makers, ceramic artisans, and textile designers. You will find Sonia Delaunay and Claude Lalanne paintings, sculptures by Philippe Anthonioz, canvases by Vik Muniz, and pieces by Laurence Montano.



A team from Louis Vuitton Foundation (an art museum and cultural center sponsored by the LMVH group.) curated the artwork, and ‘Patou’ artistic director Guillaume Henry has designed the staff uniforms.



The lobby will bedazzle with brands such as Tiffany, Chaumet, Bulgari, and Fendi, Chanel, and Dior. The hotel will also have a Dior-branded spa, done up in pastel classy shades of fawn and beige, with the brand’s perfumes and cosmetics available for purchase.



There will be 72 rooms, with the top floors offering 1,000 sqm suites. Most rooms offer a view of the river Seine as well as impressive city views.



Toiletries are Christian Dior’s Balade Sauvage.



A curved infinity pool designed uniquely with handcrafted mosaic by Michael Mayer of the renowned Mayer of Munich atelier adds appeal.



In addition, there is an exclusive fitness club with a 30-meter pool and a children’s area, Le Carrousel, for families on vacation.



Dining is an emotion at Chaval Blanc Paris, and the essence of this can be felt in its four restaurants, including a fine-dining Italian restaurant, Langosteria.



Three-starred Michelin star Arnaud Donckele and pastry chef Maxime Frédéric overlook the gastronomy offering. The cellars are stocked with rare bottles from Cheval Blanc, Château d’Yquem, Dom Pérignon, and Hennessy.



Prices for the property will start at $1300. Cheval Blanc Paris is one of the five hotels owned by LMVH and its first-ever ‘urban hotel.’ Others in the portfolio include Belmond and White 1921, Cheval Blanc Randheli, Cheval Blanc St. Barth, and Cheval Blanc St. Tropez."

This marks the first time the house will have a Japanese designer at its helm since the late Kenzo Takada resigned from his namesake brand in 1999.

NIGO — who is best known for his brands A Bathing Ape and HUMAN MADE — will succeed Felipe Oliveira Baptista, who departed the brand in June after two years as the brand’s artistic director.

In a recent statement regarding his new role, he made note that he stepped foot into the fashion industry the same year LVMH acquired KENZO and calls his role in the brand the “greatest challenge of [his] 30-year career.”

LVMH fashion group’s CEO Sidney Toledano has welcomed the newly appointed creative helm and shares, “The arrival of an extremely talented Japanese designer will allow us to write a new page in the history of the House that Takada Kenzo founded. I am convinced that the creativity and innovation of Nigo, as well as his attachment to the history of the House, will fully express all the potential of Kenzo.”

NIGO is set to start at the label on September 20, one week before the start of the Spring/Summer 2022 season of Paris Fashion Week.

Fashion and lifestyle leader Sunaina Kwatra advises on changing modes of doing business - The Sunday Guardian Live - The Sunday Guardian,"Sat, 04 Sep 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vc3VuZGF5Z3VhcmRpYW5saXZlLmNvbS9jdWx0dXJlL2Zhc2hpb24tbGlmZXN0eWxlLWxlYWRlci1zdW5haW5hLWt3YXRyYS1hZHZpc2VzLWNoYW5naW5nLW1vZGVzLWJ1c2luZXNz0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"New Delhi: Fashion and lifestyle leader Sunaina Kwatra speaks to NewsX India A-List on a host of issues including doing business during the pandemic, impact of technology in fashion industry and the future of luxury inc.

Sunaina has proven expertise in international retail management, brand positioning, and turnaround execution. She has almost 20 years work experience, the majority of which has been leading fashion brands at the Louis Vuitton Moet Hennesey (LVMH) group in Asia Pacific. Sunaina began her career as an entrepreneur in the homeware and lifestyle industry working with retailers in the United States including Barneys New York and Pottery Barn. She pivoted into luxury fashion brand management after completing her MBA and has held strategic positions to expand and reposition brands within LVMH’s Asia Pacific portfolio.

In her most recent role, Sunaina was the country head of Louis Vuitton in India and legal director for all operations in the country. She was responsible for developing and expanding Louis Vuitton’s omni-channel retail operations, people and brand equity in this high growth market. She successfully led her team to achieve the highest sales, client experience and brand growth that had ever been achieved for Louis Vuitton in India.

Excerpts from the interview:

Q. Congratulations on all you have achieved. Could you tell me more about your background and how your Indian roots brought you back to India?

A. I’m from Thailand. I am ethnically Indian but fourth generation, born and brought up in Thailand. I was very blessed to have an International upbringing. I have worked in five continents, travelled extensively. My last few roles have been within the LVMH group based out of Hong Kong.

My first role within the group was as the Regional Head of Asia Pacific for Emilio Pucci. In this role, I managed the entire scope of the brand’s direct retail business in Hong Kong and China as well as franchise, department store and multi-brand distribution in Asia Pacific. My next role within the LVMH group was as the Commercial Director for Givenchy to identify and execute growth strategies to maximise brand development and repositioning. In my tenure, I oversaw 61 locations, opened 24 stores in-line with brand vision and improved productivity across the network.

When they offered me the position to come back to India to amplify the Louis Vuitton business in India, I was thrilled at the opportunity and I am very proud of all we did to build the business and our team in India.

Q. What are the tools that have allowed you to succeed?

A. Growing up my father always said that travel was the best form of education. I had a very international education in Asia, Australia, and Europe and have worked in 5 continents. This allows me to sensitive to people and cultures while executing different strategies to grow businesses. I am a commercially driven leader and am passionate about people and delivering excellence. My general management and end-to-end experience overseeing teams, networks, finance, logistics, merchandising, client development and marketing allow me to be detail oriented yet see and set the big picture.

Q. What have we learned in retail during the pandemic?

A. The biggest learning is that we have to embrace e-commerce and the online experience. The word ‘omni-channel’ was a buzzword a decade ago. I think successful businesses during Covid had to integrate different methods of shopping available to consumers. You have had to expand the supply chain through localites, fulfillment centers or direct consumers. E-commerce has obviously a key to successful businesses in Covid. Businesses had to agile and responsive to different means of reaching the consumers. The lockdown has also led to less physical interaction with consumers. Brands have had to re-think the consumer experience and how they engage with clients. The big thing is how do we engage with clients in a number of different ways.

Q. How do you think technology will impact the fashion industry in the future?

A. Technology will be a key part of the growth of the fashion industry. Coming out of Covid, sustainable materials are important and a key focus for a lot of brands. Materials, that are not only good for the environment, but good for us being non-toxic and more breathable. We know that there are now going to be ways to bridge e-commerce and successful physical presence of stores. We can have VRs, augmented reality to help you try out clothing; jewelry, fashion and many brands have done it successfully. Just the engagement of technology and digitization is key to the success and the supply chain management. This is an exciting time for us and technology will enable future growth in retail.

Q. What advice would you give business owners in India as we come out of our second Covid wave?

A. I am sitting in the US right now and we are starting to see lines in retail stores again. People really want to embrace human connection. I would just like to say that there is hope and light. I hope that businesses now use this time to strategize and further activate their omni-channels, integrate and improve their e-commerce presence, engage with their communities on social media platforms and really use technology to enhance the supply chain and logistics to better prepare themselves for the future.

Foster + Partners' luxury Mayfair hotel cancelled as developer pulls out - Architect's Journal,"Tue, 21 Sep 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFyY2hpdGVjdHNqb3VybmFsLmNvLnVrL25ld3MvZm9zdGVyLXBhcnRuZXJzLWx1eHVyeS1tYXlmYWlyLWhvdGVsLWNhbmNlbGxlZC1hcy1kZXZlbG9wZXItcHVsbHMtb3V00gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The 84-bed scheme for the upmarket hotel group Cheval Blanc, owned by fashion giant Louis Vuitton Moët Hennessy (LVMH), was approved in 2019 by Westminster Council.

But the developer has now confirmed the project for 8-14 Grafton Street, 22-24 Bruton Lane and 163-164 New Bond Street will not be going ahead.

The plot consists of three predominantly office-use buildings, including 163 New Bond Street, which is a surviving part of architect Robert Taylor’s 18th-century development of Grafton Street, and was granted a certificate of immunity from listing in 2016.

Under the planned scheme, this building and the others on site, owned by property developer O&H Group, would have been demolished to make way for the hotel development, which also included flats and shops.

The John Bruckland-designed 1974 shopfront for Wartski Jewellers in Grafton Street was to be dismantled and reassembled within the Fosters building.

LVMH owns 70 brands across several sectors, including fashion houses Christian Dior, Louis Vuitton and Givenchy, as well as drinks brands Dom Perignon, Hennessy and Moët & Chandon.

The group’s Cheval Blanc hotel chain is described as a ‘collection of one-of-a-kind maisons in exclusive destinations, uncompromising in privacy and experience’.

Fosters’ 17,673m² scheme replaces a previous proposal for a 15,649m² retail, office and residential design by Squire and Partners and Blair Associates, which was approved in April 2016.

Bernard Arnault's Carrefour exit crystallises a rare loss for piano-playing tycoon - Sky News,"Wed, 01 Sep 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vbmV3cy5za3kuY29tL3N0b3J5L2Jlcm5hcmQtYXJuYXVsdHMtY2FycmVmb3VyLWV4aXQtY3J5c3RhbGxpc2VzLWEtcmFyZS1sb3NzLWZvci1waWFuby1wbGF5aW5nLXR5Y29vbi0xMjM5Njc2MdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Sky's Ian King writes that the LVMH billionaire's fortunes won't have been too dented by his Carrefour investment but his pride will have taken a knock.

Not for nothing is Bernard Arnault one of the world's richest people.

Mr Arnault, who runs and controls Louis Vuitton Moet Hennessey (LVMH), the biggest company in the CAC-40 index, has long been one of the world's wiliest traders, someone who loves to haggle.

It was how he parlayed an investment that cost him a symbolic one franc in 1984, for a bankrupt textiles company, into a €316bn giant that is the world's biggest luxury goods business.

Long-standing participants in the UK stock market still recall, 24 years on, how he came close to scuppering the merger between Grand Metropolitan and Guinness to form Diageo, the world's biggest spirits company, extracting £550m from the pair to give the deal his blessing.

Image: Tiffany was snapped up by LVMH in 2020 after Mr Arnault battled to reduce the price

More recently, he was able to beat down the price LVMH paid for the US jewellery company Tiffany, threatening to walk away from the deal following the outbreak of the pandemic.

The 72-year old art collector, whose total wealth is put at nearly $190bn, is also renowned for his patience.

This was never better highlighted than in the inordinate amount of time he took before bringing together the Christian Dior fragrance and couture businesses under the same roof for the first time in 70 years. This was something for which investors had been calling for many years, although Mr Arnault only moved when it suited him to do so, not the wider market.

This patience and ability to price an asset astutely is what makes Mr Arnault's sale of his stake in Carrefour, France's biggest supermarket chain and one of the world's biggest, all the more interesting.

Not least because it represents a rare setback for the piano-playing tycoon.

Mr Arnault first began building a stake in Carrefour, when, in March 2007, he teamed up with Colony Capital, the US private equity firm, to pay €3.4bn for a 9.1% stake in what was then the world's second-biggest supermarket chain after America's Walmart.

Image: Carrefour is the largest supermarket retailer in France

There seemed to be little synergy between luxury brands like Louis Vuitton, Fendi and Dom Perignon and a hypermarket. The assumption was that, rather as bidders have emerged for the UK supermarkets Asda and Morrisons during the last year, Mr Arnault had identified a way to unlock value tied up in Carrefour's property estate.

That was underlined by his partnering with Colony, at the time led by Sebastien Bazin, who has since won plaudits for his turnaround of the French hotels giant Accor. Colony was renowned for its expertise in property trading.

Within weeks, Mr Bazin and Mr Arnault were appointed to the Carrefour board, with the latter suggesting confidently the company was capable of doubling its profits during the next five years.

During the next year, the controlling Halley family had cut most of their ties with the business, while Blue Capital - the joint venture between Mr Arnault and Colony - had raised their stake to 10.7% and, by July 2008, to 12.9%. It eventually peaked at 16%.

Jose Luis Duran, the chief executive, was thrown overboard and Mr Arnault replaced him with the Nestle executive Lars Olofsson.

By then, though, the global financial crisis was battering consumer spending. Carrefour's profits fell by 45% in 2008. The crisis also put paid to hopes of spinning off Carrefour's property assets into a separate company. The following years saw Carrefour, just as Tesco did a few years later, retrenching and exiting a number of key overseas markets such as Thailand and Russia.

But the profit warnings kept on coming as Carrefour, again like Tesco in the UK, found lower-cost rivals nipping away at its market share in its home country. These did not only include the low-cost German pair, Aldi and Lidl, but also unquoted domestic rivals such as Auchan and Leclerc.

Image: Carrefour's challenges included competition from discount rivals

Mr Olofsson made way for Georges Plassat, an experienced retailer, at the beginning of 2012. He in turn was replaced by Alexandre Bompard, a former chief executive of the radio broadcaster Europe 1 and a scion of the family that once ran the football club St Etienne, in July 2017.

The rapid turnover in the boardroom gives an idea of how a turnaround was eluding Carrefour. Mr Arnault's own frustration at the situation became clear when, two years ago, he relinquished his seat on the Carrefour board and allowed his son Alexandre to replace him. By then, Colony had already dumped its shareholding in the retailer and Mr Arnault himself began selling a year ago.

Salvation briefly seemed possible when, earlier this year, a little-known Canadian convenience store and petrol station operator called Couche-Tard made a takeover approach. Its interest evaporated within days after the French government made clear it would block any attempted takeover.

Mr Arnualt's sale of his remaining 5.7% stake in Carrefour, which sent shares of Carrefour down by almost 5% at one point, crystallises a significant loss.

He is reported to have sold at €16 a share compared with the average of €47 per share he paid in 2007 although the scale of the overall loss will have been mitigated, in no small part, by the dividends he has received over the last 14 years.

Moreover, Mr Arnault can wear the loss. His personal wealth is reckoned to have risen by $100bn during the pandemic and, at one point last month following a fall in the share price of Amazon, he was briefly calculated to have leapfrogged the latter's Jeff Bezos to become the world's richest person.

This mistake, as much of a collector's item as some Dior couture, nonetheless shows that even business geniuses are capable of a miscalculation.

And the timing of the sale also suggests this normally most shrewd of investors has no faith in any turnaround at Carrefour."

On September 29, Jisoo and Rosé, both members of the global K-pop act BLACKPINK, became the center of attraction during the 2022 S/S Paris Fashion Week in France.

In particular, aside from K-pop and fashion enthusiasts, prominent personalities in the fashion industry also showed interest in the global ambassadors and idols – drawing attention from internet users.

BLACKPINK Jisoo Takes a Friendly Shot with LVMH Chairman's Son Antoine Arnault

On the 29th, French Businessman Antoine Arnault drew attention as he uploaded a photo along with BLACKPINK Jisoo during Dior's event at the Paris Fashion Week.

The CEO of Berluti and chairman of Loro Piana wrote on his Instagram story, ""So nice to meet you, (Jisoo) welcome to the Dior family.""

In the photo, Jisoo showed her elegance as she smiled gracefully next to Antoine. The two personalities met during Dior's 2022 Spring/Summer Fashion Show in Paris – wherein the fashion star represented the luxury brand as its global ambassador.

As a response, fans who saw the photo commented enthusiastically such as ""Wow, Antoine finally met Jisoo!"" ""Jisoo is the best"" and ""So pretty.""

In the video, Rose heads somewhere as if she saw a familiar face while working on the Saint Laurent fashion show schedule. Later, she met a man and hugged him lightly. The man also took a picture together after Rosé greeted her with joy.

They particularly drew attention for doing ""La Bise,"" a French greeting wherein two people exchange kisses on the cheeks. Although it is common among French, foreigners may feel a little bit flustered over the traditional greetings, particularly Asians. However, Rosé gained praise for pulling it off excellently.

On the other hand, the man is David Sims, a legendary fashion photographer, and has established a relationship with Rosé in past Saint Laurent pictorials. High-end brands such as Givenchy, Proenza Schouler, and Prada are considered the most preferred writers and are considered ""master"" in the industry.

Fans showed high interest in the meeting between the two. In fact, various responses are saying that BLACKPINK's elevated status in the fashion world is realized.
