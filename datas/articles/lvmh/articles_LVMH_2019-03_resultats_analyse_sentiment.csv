LVMH’s Bernard Arnault pledges US$226 million to rebuild Notre Dame - Style,"Wed, 06 Mar 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjbXAuY29tL21hZ2F6aW5lcy9zdHlsZS9wZW9wbGUtZXZlbnRzL2FydGljbGUvMjE4ODY2NC9tZWV0LWx2bWhzLWJlcm5hcmQtYXJuYXVsdC1ldXJvcGVzLWZvdXJ0aC1yaWNoZXN00gF0aHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAuc2NtcC5jb20vbWFnYXppbmVzL3N0eWxlL3Blb3BsZS1ldmVudHMvYXJ0aWNsZS8yMTg4NjY0L21lZXQtbHZtaHMtYmVybmFyZC1hcm5hdWx0LWV1cm9wZXMtZm91cnRoLXJpY2hlc3Q?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"As well as being the richest person in Europe, Arnault recently overtook Warren Buffett to become the third-richest person in the world, after Jeff Bezos and Bill Gates, according to the latest Bloomberg Billionaires Index, published on March 6, 2019.

Collectively, France's superrich have already pledged over US$450 million towards Notre Dame’s repairs.

French businessman Bernard Arnault – the richest person in Europe – has just pledged US$226 million (€200 million) to help rebuild the 800-year-old Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris following a massive blaze that broke out on Monday evening, damaging the famous landmark’s spire and roof.

He’s worth an estimated US$83.1 billion, Bloomberg says.

As the chairman and CEO of LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton, known simply as LVMH, the world’s largest maker of luxury goods, he is also the richest person in the fashion industry.

Bernard Arnault, CEO of LVMH, made US$4.3 billion in a single day in January 2019 after LVMH shares surged 6.9 per cent

LVMH sells products that include Louis Vuitton handbags, Dom Perignon champagne, TAG Heuer watches and Rimowa luxury suitcases.

Arnault is getting richer at an astonishing rate. In January 2019, he made US$4.3 billion in a single day after LVMH shares surged 6.9 per cent.

Between the end of January and February 27, he added another US$3.9 billion to his fortune.

Arnault has never ranked third on the Bloomberg wealth ranking before.

Today four of Arnault's five children are part of the LVMH empire.

His daughter, Delphine, the executive vice-president of Louis Vuitton is, the apparent heiress to LVMH.

Arnault, 69, who has been chairman of the conglomerate since 1989.

He lives in Paris and has a holiday home on the French Riviera, attended one of the most prestigious engineering schools in France and was named CEO of the luxury goods holding company, Financiere Agache, in 1984.

Check out Arnault's career, life and family.

LVMH, which recorded revenue of more than US$53 billion in 2018, is made up of 70 companies, which – apart from its most famous brand, Louis Vuitton – also include the fashion brands Givenchy, Fendi, Dior, Berluti and Céline, champagne maker Krug, watch brands Hublot, Bulgari and Zenith, perfume and cosmetic brands Guerlain and Fenty Beauty by Rihanna and travel retailer DFS.

Arnault comes from the northern French town of Roubaix.

He studied engineering at the École Polytechnique, which counts three former French presidents and three Nobel Prize winners among its alumni.

After graduating, Arnault spent time working for his father’s construction company, Ferret-Savinel, before entering the luxury goods industry.

He became CEO of luxury goods holding company, Financiere Agache, in 1984.

Arnault married Anne Dewavrin in 1973 and they had two children before separating in 1990. He married for a second time to Helene Mercier, a Canadian concert pianist, in 1991.

He reportedly wooed her by playing Chopin and works by other classical composers for her.

The French billionaire and his wife live on Paris’s Left Bank, south of the Seine River – a historic area that includes neighbourhoods such as the Latin Quarter and St Germain-des-Prés.

In their home, Arnault keeps a collection of modern and contemporary art from artists that include Jean-Michel Basquiat, Damien Hirst, Maurizio Cattelan, Andy Warhol and Pablo Picasso.

Arnault has three children with his current wife.

Antoine and Delphine Arnault are his two children from his first marriage.

Delphine, Bernard’s oldest daughter, started her career at American consultancy firm McKinsey & Co in Paris.

In January, Delphine became the youngest member of LVMH’s executive committee, at the age of 43.

Delphine married Italian wine heir Alessandro Vallarino Gancia in 2005 in what Forbes magazine called “France's wedding of the year”. The couple divorced in 2010.

She now reportedly lives with technology billionaire Xavier Niel and has one daughter.

However, Delphine is notoriously private about her personal life. “I’m quite discreet,” she said in 2014. “I think I’d rather focus on my work.”

Delphine's younger brother, Antoine, is chief executive of menswear label, Berluti, and chairman of the cashmere label, Loro Piana, both LVMH brands.

In addition to those roles, Antoine was named head of communication and image for LVMH in June 2018.

His partner is supermodel Natalia Vodianova, whom he reportedly met on a shoot for a 2008 Louis ­Vuitton campaign.

The couple live in Paris with their two children and Vodianova's three children from a previous marriage.

The luggage company he runs brings in annual revenue of more than US$455 million.

Alexandre often travels between Cologne, Germany, where Rimowa luggage is made, London, his hometown of Paris, and Los Angeles, where Rimowa recently opened a new store.

He is reportedly friends with Evan Spiegel, the chief executive of Snap, Snapchat's parent company.

Spiegel says Alexandre is “a really creative guy ... he’s constantly thinking about the brand and how to express that.”

Alexandre's younger brother, Frederic, also has a role at LVMH.

Last year he joined the conglomerate as the strategy and digital director at the Swiss luxury watch company, TAG Heuer, LVMH's largest watch brand.

Frederic graduated from his father’s alma mater, École Polytechnique, and spent time as an intern at Facebook and consulting firm McKinsey before joining LVMH as the temporary head of connected technologies at TAG Heuer in 2017.

Arnault's youngest son, Jean, is the only one of his children not involved at LVMH.

Like many billionaires do, Bernard Arnault travels by private jet.

He owns a sprawling holiday villa in glitzy Saint-Tropez on the French Riviera ...

Arnault has also reportedly spent at least US$96.4 million on homes in Los Angeles, in the Beverly Hills, Trousdale Estates, and Hollywood Hills neighbourhoods.

Arnault has rubbed shoulders with some of the world's most influential figures.

In 2017, he met US President Donald Trump at Trump Tower in New York, right before Trump's inauguration, to discuss expanding LVMH factories in the US.

He was photographed at parties with Lady Diana, Princess of Wales.

Arnault was reportedly friends with the late Apple founder Steve Jobs, who once said to Arnault: “You know Bernard, I don’t know if in 50 years my iPhone will still be a success, but I can tell you, I'm sure everybody will still drink your Dom Pérignon.”

Lloyd Blankfein, the former Goldman Sachs CEO, has described Arnault as “a complete visionary” and someone that “saw the increase of wealth in the world”.

Arnault is close friends with former French president Nicolas Sarkozy and was a witness at the politician’s 2008 wedding to singer-songwriter and model Carla Bruni.

He also considered Karl Lagerfeld, the late German fashion designer and Chanel creative director who died on February 19, as his good friend.

“The death of this dear friend deeply saddens me, my wife and my children,” Arnault said. “We loved and admired him deeply. Fashion and culture has lost a great inspiration.”

Arnault also has a long-standing public rivalry with Francois Pinault, 82, the second-richest man in France, who’s reportedly worth US$34.3 billion.

Pinault is the founder and CEO of French luxury brand Kering, which owns brands including Gucci and Yves St Laurent. The billionaire also owns Christie’s auction house.

Arnault’s LVMH originally tried to acquire a majority stake in the Italian luxury fashion brand, Gucci in 1999, but Pinault ultimately snatched up the brand.

Over the years, Arnault has built LVMH into the largest luxury conglomerate in the world and earned himself an imposing nickname: “The wolf in the cashmere coat”.

He's also behind the creation of Fondation Louis Vuitton, a Frank Gehry-designed contemporary art museum and performance space in Paris, which opened in 2014.

The forthcoming location will fall under the company’s Cheval brand of accommodations, as reported by Business of Fashion.

“The future of luxury will not only be in luxury goods, as it’s been for many years, but also in luxury experiences, and we want to be in both segments,” stated LVMH chief executive officer, Bernard Arnault, to BoF.

In addition to Cheval Blanc, LVMH already operates the chain of Bulgari Hotels. The French luxury conglomerate acquired high-end hospitality company Belmond Ltd in December 2018, further boosting its portfolio in the sector.

The hotel is expected to open in 2022 on Grafton Street in Mayfair, a posh area known for its aristocratic history. There will also be a restaurant, spa and potentially a Celine flagship store housed in the building.

Bella Hadid and Gigi Hadid reunited at the LVMH Prize 2019 Edition Party on March 1 in Paris, France.

The sisters looked elated to be spending time with one another, as they rocked up in coordinating outfits.

Their joint appearance comes after Bella walked the Redemption runway with a 101-degree fever.

Bella Hadid and Gigi Hadid are two of the busiest models on the planet, so whenever they're reunited at work, it's a cause for celebration. Stepping out during Paris Fashion Week for the LVMH Prize 2019 Edition Party, the Hadid sisters had the sweetest reunion in the French capital.

Bella wore a beige trench coat with matching boots, and a pair of . Gigi rocked an all-white boiler suit, with an unusual pair of gloves. Basically, the sisters were twinning in the best way:

A couple of days prior, Gigi and Bella both walked in Virgil Abloh's Off-White show for Paris Fashion Week. Karlie Kloss was also walking, and the trio stood together at the end of the show looking effortlessly chic. Just file this under #squadgoals:

It's also worth noting that Bella closed Redemption and Off-White's shows while seriously sick, and she still somehow managed to look just as flawless as ever. Posting on her Instagram Stories, Bella revealed, ""101 fever is not cute when walking a runway.""

But on the runway, the model looked like a seasoned professional. While the rest of us would've been curled up in bed feeling like the world was about to end, Bella showed up to work in a major way. I am in awe:

LVMH Plans London Hotel and New Flagship in Experiential Push - The Business of Fashion,"Fri, 01 Mar 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzb2ZmYXNoaW9uLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy9uZXdzLWFuYWx5c2lzL2x2bWgtcGxhbnMtbG9uZG9uLWhvdGVsLWFuZC1uZXctZmxhZ3NoaXAtaW4tZXhwZXJpZW50aWFsLXB1c2gv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LONDON, United Kingdom — LVMH is betting that a new Cheval Blanc hotel by 'starchitect' Norman Foster around the corner from its Louis Vuitton mega-store in London's Bond Street will increase dwell time at its nearby retail locations and advance the French group's ambitions in experiential luxury.

The conglomerate is planning a hotel, spa, restaurants and a flagship store that appears intended for Hedi Slimane's Celine on a stretch of Grafton Street that extends from Dover Street to Bond Street, according to a public consultation that opened on Thursday. The development, if it receives permission to proceed from the local council, would neighbour LVMH's new Givenchy store that opened in late 2018. The project was conceived in conjunction with property group O&H and is expected to be completed by the third-quarter of 2022, documents show. The deal could be valued at up to half a billion pounds, one source estimated.

LVMH did not respond to multiple requests for comment.

A looming no-deal Brexit has yet to dent luxury goods consumption in the UK, as international tourists and ultra-high-net-worth Londoners (many of them with foreign wealth) continue to spend. And luxury brands are continuing to open new stores in prime London locations, notably on Bond Street and surrounding locations in Mayfair, as well as the affluent West London district of Chelsea.

The news comes after LVMH signalled its growing ambitions in hospitality when it paid $3.2 billion for Cipriani hotel-owners Belmond late last year. LVMH chairman and chief executive Bernard Arnault said of the deal: ""the future of luxury will not only be in luxury goods, as it's been for many years, but also in luxury experiences, and we want to be in both segments."" According to Bain, luxury hospitality rose 5 percent last year and high-end food and dining gained 6 percent, as affluent consumers continue to shift spending from physical goods to experiences including travel.

But while hotels, food and beverage have long been considered an effective way of extending shopping time, profitability has fallen short of personal luxury goods. LVMH owns Bulgari Hotels as well as the Cheval Blanc hotel chain, where rooms cost from $400 to $1,200 a night. Developed by LVMH in 2006, Cheval Blanc is named after the group’s Bordeaux vineyard, and includes locations in Courchevel, the Maldives, Saint-Barthélemy and Saint-Tropez. Another new location is planned for Paris. Cheval Blanc currently sits under “other activities” on LVMH’s income statement, a bracket which was loss-making in its latest financial year.

The new hotel will sit next door to contemporary art gallery Sprüth Magers, which is housed in a protected Georgian building at 7 Grafton Street that was designed by Sir Robert Taylor. The gallery, with its distinctive, large bay windows, will influence the aesthetic of the Foster & Partners-designed hotel. On the Bond Street end of the new development, there will be a 2-floor flagship retail store space. Celine posters currently appear on the building and the brand could be a contender for the space, given it lacks a store on Bond Street and has a hefty target to more than double revenues to 2 to 3 billion euros ($2.2 to $3.4 billion).

In addition to its Louis Vuitton flagship on Bond Street and the new Givenchy store on Grafton Street, LVMH has several other stores in the neighbourhood, which is ground-zero for luxury retail in London. Bond Street is also home to LVMH-owned Fendi, Loro Piana, Christian Dior and Rimowa stores. Meanwhile, nearby Mount Street is home to Celine, Loewe, Nicholas Kirkwood and Moynat stores. Kenzo is just around the corner from the new development on Bruton Street and Berluti is on adjacent Conduit Street. (Marc Jacobs closed its sole London store on Mount Street last year).

The luxury hotel will mean “dwell time increases massively,” said Anthony Selwyn, head of London & International Retail at Savills, a global real estate firm. “Bond Street is the key location for luxury, so it doesn’t necessarily need a helping hand. The more likely beneficiaries are Albemarle and Dover Streets, linking off Grafton Street, where LVMH will likely put a few brands.”

The Cheval Blanc hotel will have some competition. The Westbury Hotel on Conduit Street is adding a new floor, and the Mandarin Oriental is planning a new hotel on Hanover Square. There's also Browns Hotel on Albemarle Street. And the former American Embassy, a short walk away, is being turning into a large-scale luxury hotel by Rosewood. It is believed that LVMH also bid on this property.

"Half head, half guts: LVMH man's maxim for leadership - Financial Times","Wed, 20 Mar 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZ0LmNvbS9jb250ZW50L2ZhOWVmNmY4LTJlMjYtMTFlOS04MGQyLTdiNjM3YTllMWJhMdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Print this page

As opening gambits go, Stéphane Bianchi’s is one of the more guarded. “I say no to most interviews,” begins the head of the LVMH watches division, which includes TAG Heuer, Hublot and Zenith.

“I don’t want to say anything about strategy because we’re working on it — and anyway, I don’t want to be too precise because it only benefits competitors.”

If that remains his position, Mr Bianchi will cut a very different figure from his predecessor, with whom inevitably he will be compared. In November, the mild-mannered Frenchman took over from industry veteran Jean-Claude Biver, a vocal character known throughout the industry for his candour and showmanship. Mr Biver, who had been suffering from ill health, has since moved into a non-executive role in the division.

Dressed in a modest blue suit and white shirt, Mr Bianchi looks comfortable in the plush surroundings of Geneva’s Kempinski Hotel. While he might come across as more reserved than his predecessor, he appears no less determined.

“I have never looked at the man, I’ve looked at the job,” he says when asked about following in Mr Biver’s footsteps.

“[He] is very famous, but I’ve taken over from many great men and founders, and I’ve never looked at myself taking over from someone else. I’m taking over a brand. It’s completely different.”

Industry observers viewed Mr Bianchi’s appointment as left field.

I’m not here just to manage things as they are. I’m here to grow our brands

He arrived aged 54, with no watch industry experience, typically a prerequisite when taking the reins at the biggest names in watchmaking. His perspective is that he likes “working with family-owned companies — even if that company is huge”. LVMH describes itself as a “family-run group”, with more than 150,000 employees.

Mr Bianchi has form here. In 1994, after a stint with now-defunct accounting firm Arthur Andersen, he joined family-run French cosmetics group Yves Rocher, becoming its chief executive three years later, aged 33. He was tasked by Mr Rocher, the founder who died in 2009, with buying back shares that he had sold in the early 1970s, after he was told by doctors — wrongly as it transpired — that he was dying, according to Mr Bianchi.

At the end of 2012, he says, he had delivered the brief. “That was a good time for me to leave,” he adds — though the family convinced him to stay another three years.

“I wanted to buy my own company,” he explains. “To be alone without anyone looking over my shoulder.” By his own admission, it didn’t work out. “This was a failure because I did not succeed,” is his simple summary. “I could not find a very good brand, a brand I could fall in love with and for a good price.”

So in 2016, he joined the board of Maus Frères, a family-owned Swiss conglomerate that operates sportswear and outdoor brands Lacoste, Gant and Aigle, among others — a position he has retained since joining LVMH.

He had met Bernard Arnault, chairman and chief executive of LVMH, informally a few years before he was approached by him last year to take over from Mr Biver.

LVMH — whose other subsidiaries include Louis Vuitton, Dior and Bulgari — says its watches division contributed €4.1bn to group sales of €46.9bn in 2018. “This division might [be able to] occupy a bigger place within the group, but that’s a real challenge because this is a fashion group,” Mr Bianchi says.

While he holds back on details of the division’s current performance, he says growth is “not far off being in line” with 2018 export figures reported by the Federation of the Swiss Watch Industry, which grew 6.3 per cent year on year.

“I’m not here just to manage things as they are,” he insists. “I’m here to grow our brands and the division as well.”

Alongside his role leading the division, Mr Bianchi, who lives in London with his family, has also become chief executive of TAG Heuer, which is based in the Swiss town of La Chaux-de-Fonds.

He is a longtime watch collector and is enjoying getting under the skin of the division’s three brands, he says. “I’ve been working with brands for years and I need to understand them before launching a strategy,” he says.

“I need to feel them. For me, with brands it’s 50 per cent head and 50 per cent guts.”

TAG Heuer has the highest revenues in the portfolio, he says. He describes its price positioning as “perfect” and the “entry to luxury”. Hublot has the strongest presence of the three in China, he notes, while Zenith and TAG Heuer have “huge work to do” in the Asian market. He believes Zenith, the smallest of the three brands, “deserves to be much bigger than it is now”.

Mr Bianchi admits he still harbours an ambition to have his own company. “Yes, it does remain, but now I want to build something within the division,” he says.

Still, that comes with its own risks. “I’m not paid to establish something wrong,” he says. “I’m paid to succeed.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999816417694092}",neutral,0.9999816417694092,0

"Swatch Group Warns LVMH, Richemont Over Watch Parts - WWD","Thu, 14 Mar 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3dkLmNvbS9mZWF0dXJlL3N3YXRjaC1ncm91cC13YXJucy1sdm1oLXJpY2hlbW9udC1vdmVyLXdhdGNoLXBhcnRzLTEyMDMwODQ5NjEv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"BIEL, Switzerland — Nick Hayek challenged rivals Compagnie Financière Richemont and LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton by warning that Switzerland’s biggest watchmaker would stop supplying crucial movements to its major competitors after the expiry of their current contracts.

The threat, made at Swatch Group’s media conference at the flamboyant new home of its top-selling Swatch brand, marked the latest salvo in the years-long tussle between the watchmaking operations of some of the world’s top luxury goods groups.

Movements are the hearts of mechanical watches, and Swatch Group, through its ETA subsidiary, is by far the dominant Swiss supplier. Swatch tried almost a decade ago to restrict sales to third parties. However, its initiative provoked an investigation by Switzerland’s competition authority, which ascertained ETA’s market dominance and obliged it to maintain sales, albeit at an annually declining rate. That obligation expires at the end of this year.

“We’re not worried at all. We need all the capacity for ourselves. They should be worried, It’s not self-service anymore,” said a combative Hayek, referring to his big rivals.

Like his now deceased father, the current Swatch Group chief executive officer has railed against Richemont and especially LVMH‘s mid-market Tag Heuer brand.

The Hayeks, Swatch Group’s biggest shareholders, have for years argued that their rivals have failed to invest in production capacity, and diverted spending into marketing instead, while preferring to buy movements off the shelf from ETA.

“We sell 510,000 movements a year to third parties and can use all that ourselves,” revealed Hayek. He said some small Swiss brands had renewed their supply contracts, which ETA would honor. But failures to renew by both LVMH and Richemont — which Hayek defined as inexplicable — meant ETA would not be able to supply them with further movements after their current contracts ended.

“We would really encourage them to invest more, but that’s their problem, not ours,” he added.

Richemont, and, to a lesser extent, LVMH has increased spending on essential watch parts and movements. But their focus has been on higher-end products, with movements for both groups’ less exclusive models still often being sourced from ETA. One major reason is ETA’s economies of scale, which make its products relatively cheap compared with the limited number of lower volume rivals, let alone the likely cost for competitor brands to set up production of their own.

Hayek implied he would consider supplying LVMH and Richemont — whose IWC mid-market brand bought at least 45 percent of its movements from ETA, he claimed — in order to support Swiss watchmaking. But he argued both groups had been preoccupied and neglected to think sufficiently ahead.

Tag Heuer was unavailable for comment, while an IWC spokesperson declined to comment on what she said were group matters.

Hayek, speaking for the first time at the new 270 million Swiss franc headquarters for the Swatch brand and an adjoining group conference center, also revealed buoyant sales for the new Swatch Paymodel introduced in Switzerland in January.

The newcomer, available initially in four variants with more to come, allows automatic payment, akin to an existing Swatch watch on sale in China. He said sales would be extended in coming months to Italy, probably in July, the U.K. and Germany.

The new model replaces and enhances the previous Swatch Bellamy, a payment enabled watch launched in Switzerland that failed to take off because of significant barriers and delays with the banks involved. The new WatchPay, by contrast, is much simpler, allowing contactless payment up to 40 Swiss francs and much higher sums thereafter subject to customer verification.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9955706000328064}",neutral,0.9955706000328064,0

In March 2018, LVMH bought a 6,200-square-foot empty retail space at 456 North Rodeo Drive for $110 million. Then, in September, the luxury powerhouse headed by billionaire Bernard Arnault purchased 468 North Rodeo Drive, the massive 22,250-square-foot, multistory building at the corner of Santa Monica Boulevard that was previously occupied by Brooks Brothers, for $245 million from the trust of the family of Margaret J. Anderson, who built the pink stucco Beverly Hills Hotel. In November, LVMH scooped up the 26,523-square-foot Paley Center for Media museum behind the store, at 465 North Beverly Drive, from New York private real estate investment firm Jenel Management for $80 million. Together, the three contiguous parcels create more than 50,000 square feet of real estate on which to build, with frontage on Rodeo Drive, Santa Monica Boulevard and Beverly Drive that could be connected into one hotel property.

A spokesman for LVMH in Paris declined to comment on plans for Beverly Hills, but confirmed the hotel division has tapped Christian Boyens, former manager of the Ritz Paris, to oversee operations of its urban properties throughout the world, including the opening of the first Cheval Blanc hotel in a city — Paris — set for the first half of 2020 as part of the long-delayed renovation of the landmark Paris department store La Samaritaine.

“To have [LVMH] with an upscale hotel would be a big benefit to the street,” said Chuck Dembo, a partner in Dembo Realty in Beverly Hills, which has handled many Rodeo Drive real estate deals, noting that the retail market is tough even on the famous thoroughfare because of changing shopping habits and brands going in and out of favor quickly. “With something like this and such a special brand, they are going to have an easier time getting through the city,” he said of the zoning process.

L.A.’s sprawling commercial real estate market is finicky, with Robertson Boulevard once a hot destination for Ralph Lauren, Tory Burch and Tommy Hilfiger stores, all of which have closed, and Melrose Avenue and Melrose Place emerging in the last decade as a Beverly Hills alternative for Marc Jacobs, Oscar de la Renta, Chloé, Isabel Marant and Balmain.

But in the last five years, Rodeo Drive has seen a renaissance, with Hermès, Chanel and LVMH purchasing their own buildings and “investing for the long haul,” said Jay Luchs, vice chairman at Newmark Knight Frank’s West Los Angeles office, who handled the 468 North Rodeo Drive sale to LVMH but would not comment on the buyer’s intent. “Rodeo Drive is better than it’s ever been,” he said.

“The real estate market is quite strong on Rodeo Drive,” said Kathy Gohari, president of the Rodeo Drive Committee, whose 60 members include retailers, hoteliers, boutique managers and property owners along the two-and-a-half block street. “There continues to be interest from brands and brand-holding companies to purchase their own real estate as well as significant investor evidence. There’s a lot of evidence — real and anecdotal — that business is strong, too, judging by the investments several brands are making, may make and will make.”

In recent years, Alexander McQueen and Balenciaga have both moved from Melrose to Rodeo, Saint Laurent added a second store (one for men and one for women), and Goyard opened a flagship. This week, MCM joins the retail roster with a flagship. Meanwhile, Gucci has an expansion planned, and Chanel, Cartier and Van Cleef & Arpels are all remodeling their stores to keep up with the pace of newness.

“L.A. has become a place everyone has to be, whether its ceo’s, designers or people looking to retire,” said Luchs, noting the convergence of the fashion, entertainment, art and influencer scenes.

There are two existing hotels on Rodeo Drive — the Beverly Wilshire at the intersection of Rodeo Drive and Wilshire Boulevard, and The Luxe Rodeo Drive Hotel at 360 North Rodeo Drive. LVMH is one of the street’s biggest real estate players, owning or leasing spaces for its Louis Vuitton, Dior and Fendi brands in addition to its new acquisitions. In August 2016, it paid $122 million for the House of Bijan at 420 North Rodeo Drive, a purchase at the time considered to be the most expensive on the street, at $19,405 per square foot, which beat out Chanel’s 2015 purchase of a Rodeo Drive store for $13,217 per square foot. Prices have only gone up from there.

The French luxury goods firm opened the first Cheval Blanc hotel in 2006, located in the ski resort of Courchevel in the French Alps. Three other hotels complete the roster: Cheval Blanc St-Barth Isle de France in the Caribbean, Cheval Blanc Randheli in the Maldives and the recently acquired Cheval Blanc St-Tropez, set to open in May. The Cheval Blanc Paris will be the first time the concept is applied to a city.

In December, further signaling its intention to bulk up hospitality operations globally and position itself as much of a leading player in experiential luxury as in fashion, leather goods and prestige wines and spirits, LVMH purchased Belmond Ltd. for $2.6 billion. Established more than 40 years ago with the acquisition of Hotel Cipriani in Venice, Belmond operates in 24 countries with a portfolio of 46 luxury hotel, restaurant, train and river cruise properties, including New York’s 21 Club, the Orient Express and Royal Scotsman trains.

LVMH also owns the six Bulgari hotels, with plans to open three more destinations in Paris in 2020, Moscow in 2021 and Tokyo in 2022. Its newest hotel investment would follow a decade-long trend of luxury brands expanding into the hospitality sector, including the Armani hotels, Ferragamo’s Lugarno brand, Palazzo Versace hotels in the Gold Coast of Australia and Dubai, the Fendi Suites in Rome, and the upcoming Audemars Piguet property opening in Switzerland in 2020. In January, Rick Caruso, the real estate developer behind L.A.’s The Grove and Palisades Village retail destinations, opened his first hotel, the Rosewood Miramar Beach in Montecito, Calif., including a sundries shop from Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop, another brand that has expressed interest in hotels.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.999992847442627}",neutral,0.999992847442627,0

The group’s CEO Bernard Arnault told the publication: ‘The future of luxury will not only be in luxury goods, as it’s been for many years, but also in luxury experiences, and we want to be in both segments.’

The new London hotel will be around the corner of Louis Vuitton’s Bond Street flagship and will join LVMH’s Cheval Blanc network of hotels.

Chinese brand-builders want an LVMH-style luxury conglomerate - Vogue Business,"Tue, 19 Mar 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZvZ3VlYnVzaW5lc3MuY29tL2NvbXBhbmllcy9sdXh1cnktZ29vZHMtY29uZ2xvbWVyYXRlLWNoaW5hLWx2bWjSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"To receive the Vogue Business China Edit, sign up here.

Chinese consumers now represent a third of global luxury spend, and by 2024 the Boston Consulting Group (BCG) expects that figure to grow to 40 per cent. With the country now minting two billionaires per week, it’s no surprise that Asian fashion companies are in acquisition mode.

They’re emulating LVMH, which made its name for deal-making during the 1980s, a decade marked by widespread conspicuous consumption in the US and Japan. LVMH was a $2.1 billion business in 1987, but revenues had nearly quadrupled to $8.66 billion in 1999. Just as the French group targeted newly affluent clients with products that were priced within their reach, Chinese entrepreneurs are getting into the game as the country’s middle class flourishes.

Qiu Yafu, the chairman of Shandong Ruyi, made his ambitions clear last year when he called LVMH a “god-like enterprise” and his firm’s role model. In less than five years, Ruyi has taken control of French group SMCP, which owns Maje and Sandro, as well as Bally, Aquascutum and Gieves & Hawkes. (While Ruyi is one of China’s largest textiles makers, the focus on Western labels reflect how foreign brands are still seen as more desirable.)

Hong Kong billionaire heir Adrian Cheng’s vision is even more ambitious. “We are trying to build a world ecosystem in culture and lifestyle,” he tells Vogue Business. Through investment vehicles like C Ventures, a venture capital fund he co-founded, Cheng has acquired stakes in Western brands like Moda Operandi, Bandier and Dazed Media.

All this takes place as luxury brands are consolidating, and as the US attempts to build its own answer to LVMH. Michael Kors (now Capri Holdings) acquired Jimmy Choo in 2017 and Versace the following year, fuelling talk of America’s first fashion conglomerate. In 2017, LVMH chairman Bernard Arnault’s investment group bought out the shares in Christian Dior that it didn’t already own.

Chinese expertise

Instead of developing domestic brands, the would-be luxury conglomerates of Asia have focused on buying established Western labels. They have then sought to grow those businesses by expanding their reach in China. SMCP said Chinese sales grew by over 20 per cent year-on-year in 2018, the second full year under Ruyi’s control. The company doesn’t break out revenue by country, but it recorded €202.4 million in Asia-Pacific sales last year, up 36 per cent from 2017.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9997230172157288}",neutral,0.9997230172157288,0

Placing third on the list, Arnault’s rivals are Bill Gates in second place with $98.3bn USD and Jeff Bezos in first, with a net worth of $140bn USD. Bloomberg reports Arnault increased his fortune by $14.5bn USD this past year, expected news given LVMH’s record-breaking sales of $53.4bn USD in 2018.

Arnault entered the luxury goods industry in 1984, buying out the bankrupt company which owned Christian Dior – of which he now holds a 96.5% stake in – and sold the company’s other businesses to purchase a majority stake in the LVMH group.

This is the first time Arnault has been in the top three since the Bloomberg Billionaire Index launched in 2012. With only $100,000,000 USD between Arnault and Buffet making or breaking the third spot, only time will tell where LVMH’s sales take Arnault next.

Perfect for high-rollers! Vegas, baby.

The Forum location is Rimowa's 18th store in North America, and they're celebrating the opening with a special artist collaboration.

The pieces, which aren't available quite yet, will be on view during this weekend's opening.

There's already a waitlist for the Rimowa x Alex Israel pieces. It makes sense, given the design world's current infatuation with soothing gradients.

How This Billionaire Luxury Magnate Became One of the World's Richest Men - Maxim,"Sat, 30 Mar 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiMmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1heGltLmNvbS9uZXdzL2Jlcm5hcmQtYXJuYXVsdC0yMDE5LTMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"How This Billionaire Luxury Magnate Became One of the World’s Richest Men

LVMH Chairman & CEO Bernard Arnault made his fortune with luxury brands like Dom Pérignon, Louis Vuitton, TAG Heuer and more.

If you’ve ever sipped a glass of Hennessy or Dom Pérignon, coveted a Louis Vuitton bag or a pair of Berluti shoes, or strapped on a Hublot or TAG Heuer watch, you’ve felt the influence of Bernard Arnault, the billionaire French businessman who has quietly shaped the tastes of the entire world.

A man of exceptional vision who started out as an engineer in his family’s construction firm, in 1989 the Paris-based financier, investor and art collector became the majority shareholder, Chairman and CEO of LVMH, the world’s leading luxury goods company, and has remained so ever since.

With a net worth of nearly $70 billion, he is now the fourth richest man in the world (as of press time) according to Forbes, which calculated his personal fortune increased by over $30 billion in one year alone, thanks to a 13% spike in LVMH’s revenue.

The unprecedented firm is made up of 70 different brands divided into six sectors: wines and spirits, luxury retailing, fashion and leather goods, watches and jewelry, perfume and cosmetics, and hospitality and other holdings including luxury yachts.

His phenomenal wealth, as Lloyd Blankfein, former Chairman and CEO of Goldman Sachs, points out to CNBC, “was accomplished in a single generation,” making it all the more remarkable.

Particularly as just a decade ago many derided the notion that a conglomeration of luxury goods houses—several of them competitors—was even a smart business move.

“In the ’90s [I] had the idea of a luxury group and at the time I was very much criticized for it,” Arnault remarked to CNBC. “I remember people telling me it doesn’t make sense to put together so many brands. And it was a success. [And then] for the last 10 years now, every competitor is trying to imitate, which is very rewarding for us. I think they are not successful but they try.”

Victory, he maintains, has not come as a result of relentless profit-seeking but is due to a “business model… based on creativity, innovation, and quality.”

In 11 years, the market value of LVMH—an acronym for Louis Vuitton Moët Hennessy—multiplied by at least 15, while, simultaneously, sales and profit rose by 500 percent. The company had revenue of upwards of $50 billion in 2017. And much of it is attributable to acquisitions that were seriously called into question at the time.

“He was paying full prices for things that weren’t close to what other people would want,” Blankfein notes, “and other people scoffed that he would ever realize [their] value or earn anything from the prices he was paying.… It takes a certain amount of courage to stand against the tide knowing that you’re going to… outperform the experts and the founders that created those businesses.”

Arnault’s acquisitions include stakes in luxe luggage company Rimowa, Bulgari, Belvedere Vodka, and cosmetics giant Sephora, as well as Dior, Louis Vuitton, Veuve Clicquot, Fendi, and more.

“Typically, within a five-year span — which is very short — with hindsight every single purchase looks like genius,” as Michael Burke, Louis Vuitton Chairman and CEO, told the Financial Times.

The tycoon’s latest investment is the Belmond luxury hotel and travel group, whose holdings include the iconic Hotel Cipriani in Venice and the opulent Venice Simplon-Orient-Express train, for which LVMH is paying $3.2 billion; a move Arnault says is “entirely consistent with our continued investment in the field of experiential luxury.”

“He’s a dreamer,” as Burke explained to CNBC. “He dreams big dreams. And then he has the guts to go after those dreams. Sometimes I try to tell him that the dream is too big. But of course he’s always right.”

His oldest son Antoine Arnault, who overseas luxury fashion brands Loro Piana and Berluti and sits on LVMH’s board of directors, says his father would much rather be dreaming. “People” imagine him in his big tower with his huge Excel spreadsheets with numbers, he comments.

“It’s very far from reality. His real interest is his family. Of course, he’s a workaholic. He works a lot and he loves it, but… he also has fun with it. It’s not as serious as some might think up there…We absolutely take no decisions based on the share price, not for LVMH….What motivates the family is that Louis Vuitton, Loro Piana, Berluti, Dior is on top of their game.”

https://www.instagram.com/p/BvYkOYLF1vg

The latter part is especially important as Arnault runs LVMH like a family business. He has two other children who occupy prominent positions at the company.

“When you are in a family you have two major advantages,” Arnault notes. “One is you can think long term. I see too many companies in which you have changes all the time. And especially in the U.S., you have to be all the time looking at the next quarter’s numbers. What I always say to my team is I am not that much interested by the numbers [for] the next six months. What I am interested in is that the desire for the brand will be the same in 10 years as it is today.”

Steve Jobs, someone Arnault admired greatly, thought that the French tycoon had accomplished his goal, telling him at one point, “You know Bernard, I don’t know if in 50 years my iPhone will still be a success but I can tell you, I’m sure everybody will still drink your Dom Pérignon.”

Arnault puts it all down to talent. “In today’s business, since the ’80s when I bought Christian Dior, it’s the same combination that explains success,” he told CNBC. “You have to work with some of the best inventors, creators, designers and be able to market their products and create with their products, desire in the world.”

Case in point: last year LVMH hired Virgil Abloh, Kanye West’s longtime creative collaborator and founder of coveted fashion brand Off-White, as Louis Vuitton’s artistic director for menswear. And

https://www.instagram.com/p/BuS0gAyorwq

Abloh has already started cross-pollinating in the LVMH universe, having designed a limited edition bottle for Moët & Chandon. His “innate creativity and disruptive approach have made him so relevant,” Burke said of his appointment, “not just in the world of fashion but in popular culture today.”

The typical owner of a storied 165-year-old brand like Vuitton may not want “disruptive” in the mix, but Arnault has guaranteed the famed monogram will find a new generation of fans.

“He has no interest in standing still, he has no interest in repeating himself,” as legendary Vogue editor Anna Wintour puts it. “He has no interest in anything remaining the same. He is a man that is intrigued by what can happen, not by what has happened…. Fashion is an industry that exists on change and he totally and completely understands that.”

Antoine Arnault adds, “A lot of people see him as a great financier, a great strategic mind in terms of how to build an empire. That’s not at all how he thinks, in my opinion. I think his big strength is actually to speak to creative people and to make them thrive under his management. It’s not to create profit or create more revenue or double the size of the business. I know that’s the consequence and that’s usually what happens, but his real talent is with creative minds.”

https://www.instagram.com/p/BtsqSqDF0NO

In 2014 Arnault realized his longtime goal of opening a museum and cultural center in Paris. Already a landmark in a city known for them, the Fondation Louis Vuitton is an LVMH-funded space for exhibition and events, designed by famed architect Frank Gehry.

They met at the Gehry-designed Guggenheim Museum Bilbao 13 years earlier, and spent several years overcoming the technical difficulties and opposition to the edifice, best described as a transparent cloud made up of a dozen massive glass sails.

“He thinks a lot like an artist,” Gehry told CNBC. “I think in his business life and world he has to be careful, conservative. But he’s a delight to work with as a creative person because he’s open to ideas…. He says things just very softly, but I know, when he says it, he means it. And I go for it and then we have fun trying to make it happen.”

https://www.instagram.com/p/BrXt6NyIWt5

Arnault has of course collected a lot of personal and professional honors in the course of his life and career, but the most prestigious are France’s Grand Officier de la Légion d’Honneur and Commandeur des Arts et des Lettres, as well as honorary Knight Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire. No doubt he should save room on his lapel for a few more.

“In terms of where we are in the life of Bernard Arnault and LVMH,” Blankfein opines, “he’s got a lot of runway ahead of him. And he thinks young and he thinks current. I wouldn’t be giving him his lifetime achievement award yet. I would wait a while longer because I think there are still more chapters” to come.

We’ll raise a glass of Dom to that.

Jewels in the Crown

LVMH’s vast luxury holdings include some of the world’s most exclusive, and profitable, brands in the world.

Formed in 1987 with the merger of fashion house Louis Vuitton and spirits icon Moët Hennessy, in just over 30 years LVMH, under Bernard Arnault’s guidance, had built up a market cap approaching €150 billion (about $170 billion) by the summer of 2018.

In 2017 the group had revenues of €42.6 billion, or about $49 billion, an increase of 13% over the previous year. With a portfolio of 70 luxury brands and a retail network of over 4,370 stores worldwide, LVMH has achieved astonishing figures; on the wine and spirits side alone it sold about 66 million bottles of champagne and about 91 million bottles of cognac in 2017, while its fashion and leather goods business brought in €15.47 billion in revenue, or about $18 billion.

Louis Vuitton, the world’s most valuable luxury brand according to Forbes, has a value of $33.6 billion on its own, while, as of press time, those who invested in LVMH shares ten years ago would have made five times their money today.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.8197442889213562}",neutral,0.8197442889213562,0

Mar 7, 2019

is considering spinning off , the luxury Florentine brand, according to several sources in Italian luxury.



The group, however, has denied the reports.







Visuals from the house's Spring/Summer 2019 campaign





Pucci is one of several luxury Italian brands owned by LVMH, the Paris-based conglomerate that has the world’s largest stable of prestige marques. These include Roman furrier , cashmere specialist Loro Piana and high-end jeweller .



However, Pucci has never quite fitted into the long-term strategy of LVMH chairman and key shareholder and his desire to control and build international star brands.

Moreover, the house has been without a creative director for almost two years – a stunning hiatus for a luxury brand. Its most recent designer was of fame, who quit the house in April 2017. It does not currently have a CEO either.



According to an Italian banker and two fashion executives familiar with Pucci, LVMH has quietly sounded out potential buyers for the house.



But, asked about the reports, , the president of LVMH Fashion Group, which oversees Pucci, along with , , , and others, denied that the conglomerate was contemplating any sale.



“This is not the case. I think we all know Bernard Arnault doesn’t like selling assets,” Toledano told .



He underlined that he had recently appointed as general manager to “make an analysis of the company.”



Once that process is completed, Pucci will consider replacements for CEO Mauro Grimaldi, who left last month.



Pucci was founded by the exotic Florentine marquis and champion skier Emilio Pucci in 1947, after his designs for the College ski team caught the attention of senior fashion editors. He went on to create a brand instantly recognizable for its fabulously geometric prints featuring a kaleidoscope of colours, worn by the likes of Sophia Loren, Jackie Kennedy and .



LVMH acquired majority control of Pucci in 2000 for an estimated $12 million, when its annual sales were two-thirds that figure. Atypically, LVMH left management of the house mainly in the hands of the family; to , daughter of founder Emilio.



Throughout its period under LVMH control, Pucci has witnessed a rather rapid turnover of designers: , Stephan Janson, , Julio Espada, , and Giorgetti. A stunning revolving door, even given modern business habits of extending shorter and shorter contracts to designers.



Under , who had the longest run at over six years; Pucci reached its apogee, breaking the 100-million-euro barrier.



However after loggerheads with Laudomia Pucci, and the opinion that Dundas had strayed too far from the luxury resort DNA of Pucci and onto Hollywood’s red carpet, the Norwegian designer exited in 2015.



Pucci is far from being the jewel in the crown of the LVMH stable of over 50 prestige brands, however, the possibility to acquire such a storied label, with incredibly rich archives and a respectable retail network would be certain to attract plenty of bidders.

Over the last few months, there’s been talk of Rihanna launching a new luxury label under Louis Vuitton Moët Hennessy (LVMH) — the conglomerate that owns brands like Celine, Dior, Louis Vuitton, and many others. Last week, Business of Fashion revealed that a secret venture called “Project Loud” — a reference to the singer’s fifth studio album — is actually well underway, with direct ties to both Rihanna and LVMH.

Still, details are vague. According to the article, Project Loud intends to fabricate and distribute products in a range of categories, including clothing for men, women, and children, footwear, eyewear, leather goods, sportswear, “goods linked to lifestyle,” high-tech products, office supplies, and home decor and garden products. So basically, everything.

Wait a minute, though … “Office supplies?” And “garden products?”

Neither LVMH nor Rihanna has confirmed this report, but nothing’s impossible when these two bank accounts are involved. We’d gladly take an office calendar consisting of 365-days of Rihanna outfits.

Bitcoin Daily: Rakuten Secures Crypto Exchange License; LVMH Launches Luxury Retail Blockchain - PYMNTS.com,"Wed, 27 Mar 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnB5bW50cy5jb20vYmxvY2tjaGFpbi9iaXRjb2luLzIwMTkvcmFrdXRlbi1jcnlwdG8tZXhjaGFuZ2UtbGljZW5zZS1sdm1oLWx1eHVyeS1yZXRhaWwtYmxvY2tjaGFpbi_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Louis Vuitton label owner LVMH is reportedly gearing up to roll out a crypto provenance platform that has the code name AURA, CoinDesk reported. AURA is said to come online in May or June with Louis Vuitton, along with Parfums Christian Dior. As it stands, the crypto provenance platform has reportedly been created via a version of the Quorum ethereum blockchain. And the company has reportedly had a blockchain team working full time for more than a year. LVMH counts famous brands such as Hublot and Dior as well as Dom Pérignon. The group reportedly had revenues of $53 billion last year.

And Japan’s Financial Service Agency (FSA) has said that Rakuten’s new digital currency exchange, Rakuten Wallet, is now registered as a virtual currency exchange provider with Kanto Local Financial Bureau under the Payment Service Act, CoinDesk reported. The eCommerce firm had previously acquired the Everybody’s Bitcoin Inc. exchange last year for $2.4 million. It, however, noted that it was concluding the older service. Users, in turn, could sign up for the new Rakuten Wallet. On a similar note, the FSA said it issued DeCurret a license. The exchange reportedly will offer spot trading of four digital currencies in the country.

In other news, DragonEx said on its Telegram channel that it suffered a hack — digital currency that was owned by the exchange and users was “transferred and stolen,” CoinDesk reported. The outlet reported that the exchange took down its platform due to purported system upgrades on Sunday (March 24) and said it was “still working on system maintenance” prior to saying that it had experienced a hack. DragonEx said in a Telegram announcement on Monday (March 25), “Part of the assets were retrieved back, and we will do our best to retrieve back the rest of stolen assets.” The company also said that “all platform services will be closed and the accurate assets loss/recovery situation will be announced in a week.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999701976776123}",neutral,0.9999701976776123,0

Owned by LVMH, the company is expected to open a Cheval Blanc-branded hotel in Grafton Street, Mayfair, by 2022.

LVMH recently attracted attention for its purchase last December of luxury-travel group Belmond for $3.2 billion, but the organisation has had interests in luxury hospitality for some time.

Debuting in Courchevel in 2006, its Cheval Blanc portfolio now also encompases luxury resorts in the Maldives, St Tropez and St Barts; its first hotel in Paris is due to open in spring 2020. LVMH Hotel Management also oversees the Bulgari Hotels & Resorts portfolio in collaboration with Marriott International.

"Arnault, Pinault, Ferrero, Bulgheroni: the super rich in the wine & food world - WineNews","Wed, 06 Mar 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd2luZW5ld3MuaXQvZW4vYXJuYXVsdC1waW5hdWx0LWZlcnJlcm8tYnVsZ2hlcm9uaS10aGUtc3VwZXItcmljaC1pbi10aGUtd2luZS1mb29kLXdvcmxkXzM4NTY5Mi_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"According to the Forbes 2019 ranking, at 131 billion US dollars in assets Jeff Bezos, owner of the giant Amazon, is the richest man in the world, followed by Bill Gates at 96.5 billion US dollars, and Warren Buffett at 82.5 billion US dollars, but there are also names among the richest on the planet, linked to wine and the wine & food worlds. Starting with the fourth richest man in the world, Bernard Arnault, who is head of the LVMH luxury group, and the owner of, besides major fashion brands such as Louis Vuitton or Fendi, the “must” of jewelry Bulgari, as well as some of the most prestigious wine names in the world, such as Chateau d’Yquem, Cheval Blanc, Dom Pérignon, Ruinart, Moet & Chandon and Veuve Cliquot, who has built a personal fortune that Forbes has estimated at 76 billion US dollars.

In position number 30, instead, there is another Frenchman, Francois Pinault, whose patrimony is 32.5 billion US dollars, and is the “head of the family” Artemis, one of the biggest luxury groups in France, which possesses some of the most prestigious wine brands in the world, like Château Latour in Bordeaux and Clos de Tart in Burgundy, to mention just a couple.

Related to food specifically, and in particular to the confectionery industry, are the capitals of Jacquelin Mars and John Mars, (23.9 billion dollars each, at position number 33), who are at the helm of the famous American confectionery industry. Further, in position 35, at 22.8 billion dollars is the beer magnate Jorge Paulo Lemann, at the helm of the giant AB INBEV.

The first of the super rich Italians comes from the food world and, that is, Giovanni Ferrero, leading the great confectionery industry in Alba, who, by way of Nutella and other iconic products in the world, has built a personal fortune of 22.4 billion euros, and holds position number 39 on the ranking of the richest in the world.

Dietrich Mateschitz, co-founder of Red Bull, at 18.9 billion US dollars, is in position number 53 of the top 100 billionaires in the world linked to food & beverage, ahead of Lee Man Tat (number 63), chairman of LLK Group, the world’s largest producer of oyster sauce, at 17.1 billion dollars. Charoen Sirivandhanabhakdi, owner of Thai Beverage, Thailand’s largest brewer, at 14.5 billion dollars(number 87), Emmanuel Besnier, CEO of Lactalis, at 14.3 billion dollars (number 88), and Charlene de Cavalho-Heineken, shareholder of the Heineken beer giant, at 14.2 billion US dollars (number 89).

Additionally, among the names of the richest, the Italian Luca Garavoglia, chairman of the Campari group, whose patrimony is 3.2 billion US dollars (no. 691 in the world). Other personalities also linked to wine, and especially to Italy, are the Argentine oilman Alejandro Bulgheroni, in position number 715 of the richest in the world, whose patrimony amounts to 3.2 billion US dollars, and who is the owner of several estates in the top Tuscan territories, such as the historic Dievole, in Chianti Classico, Tenuta le Colonne and Tenuta Meraviglia in Bolgheri, Poggio Landi, in Montalcino, as well as other wineries in Argentina, Uruguay and Bordeaux, but there is also Andrè Esteves, Brazilian financier and owner of Argiano, one of the historical companies in Montalcino. Plus, among those that are in some way related to wine, there is the designer Renzo Rosso, owner of Diesel and producer at his Diesel Farm in Marostica, in the Vicenza area, who has built a personal wealth amounting to 2.5 billion of euros, making him the 916th richest man in the world.

Explore the inception of luxury Chinese wine Ao Yun - Options The Edge,"Fri, 01 Mar 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm9wdGlvbnN0aGVlZGdlLmNvbS90b3BpYy9mb29kL2V4cGxvcmUtaW5jZXB0aW9uLWx1eHVyeS1jaGluZXNlLXdpbmUtYW8teXVu0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"It took around four years for Moët Hennessy to find the perfect spot for cultivating the grapes that would go on to become the next great red rising out of China — a wine named Ao Yun. “Consumption in China was booming. China has an exceptional terroir, and the ability to make great wines. We knew it, the question was where,” says international director for Estates and Wines Christophe Chauvet at W Hotel’s Chinese restaurant, Yen. Here to introduce Ao Yun’s second vintage, Chauvet tells Options about how the vision for this wine came to fruition. “We went with a team of viticulturists, analysts and consultants from Bordeaux and Australia, and we asked them to search for and find the best terroir in China, to tell us where to make a great wine and tell us where we should be establishing [ourselves],” he explains.

They first looked at Qingdao, but the area was too humid and would put the vines at risk of contracting diseases. Some places in the Eastern region were difficult to explore because of their politics and some places were far too cold, which would mean that they would have to bury the vines in the winter and dig them out in the spring. Finally, they found the perfect spot just north of Yunnan province, where the Yangtze, Salween and Mekong rivers meet. “We are working with two villages, two on the left bank and two on the right bank of the Mekong river. We believed that these four villages could deliver the magical grapes we were dreaming about,” adds Chauvet.

Ao Yun, meaning “flying above the clouds”, is aptly named as it is located at the foothills of the Himalayas with an altitude of 2,200m to 2,600m. Chauvet explains that the company’s expertise from its vineyards in Argentina had prepared it for the dizzying heights. “If you want to grow grapes and make wines, you need altitude. We usually say that 100m in altitude compensates for the latitude you are not on. 100m high will actually make you gain 1° of freshness, so 1,000m will give you 10°C in freshness and wines need water for freshness,” he says.

Other than altitude, winemakers have to deal with the lack of oxygen and odd sunlight hours. “We get three or four hours of sun every day, but it’s strong because we are closer to the sun. The intense UV light and rapid photosynthesis cultivates strong vines but the grapes also take longer to ripen. The ripening period we are talking about is 145 days, but in Bordeaux it is 120 days. Again, it is something we need to learn, to cope with and understand better,” he explains.

Chauvet: ""We are here for 500 years, maybe 1,000 years. We have plenty of time."" (Photo: LVMH)

With subtle tannins, Ao Yun is a unique blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc. When asked about food pairings, Chauvet believes that Ao Yun works best with Szechuan food or any dish that uses a range of spices. He has even tried the wine with beef rendang and says it works well. At Yen, we begin the evening with a delicate starter of wok-fried foie gras, silky beancurd, vintage vinegar pearl and lemon foam. This is followed by a roast Peking duck folded in a wheat pancake with traditional sauces. The sweetness of this dish paired well with the mellow and smooth Ao Yun 2013.

The Ao Yun 2014 was a surprise, as it had a full-bodied and more powerful flavour. Served with a main of wok-fried wagyu beef, golden garlic, black pepper sauce and mashed potatoes, the 2014 worked well with all the spices. It is interesting to see how the robust 2014 compares with the more mellow but equally complex 2013. For the evening’s sweet conclusion we had Chili Magnum Royaltine mousse served with salted caramel popcorn and honeycomb. An odd dessert to be sure, especially the spicy Magnum, but definitely a sweet end to the night. Moët Hennessy has proved that its new luxury wine was worth the risk and is definitely here to stay. “We are here for 500 years, maybe 1,000 years. We have plenty of time. We just want to make sure we make the best wine, a great wine ... We are in a new thing which the world has no idea about, pushing the boundaries of winemaking. Every day is a learning exercise,” adds Chauvet.

The 25-year-old South African fashion designer recently won the top prize at the British Council’s International Fashion Showcase (IFS) during London Fashion Week. Magugu was called ‘a leader of his generation’ by the judging panel that described his installation as ‘not only having a striking visual impact but real clarity.’ The exhibition titled Dawning, had Magugu up against fifteen designers from all over the globe. The womenswear designer presented his collection ‘African Studies’ which he described as ‘a celebration of South Africa’s progress over the past few years. As many know South Africa has one of the most progressive constitutions in the world, almost a complete opposite to the version it was, post ‘94. Despite pushbacks and serious crimes against them, South Africa is also becoming even more women-led, which is incredible for a variety of reasons.’

Image: Instagram/Thebemagugu Another recent and pretty big deal is Magugu being selected as one of twenty finalists for the 2019 LVMH(Louis Vuitton Moët Hennessy) Prize in Paris. The twenty LVMH Prize designers were selected from a field of 1,700 applicants and are representing fifteen countries, two from Africa, our very own Magugu, and Kenneth Izedonmwen from Nigeria. Since its launch in 2013, the Prize has been considered a true enabler for young talent from all over the world. The grand prize includes €300 000 and a year being mentored by the Louis Vuitton designers. Magugu got to present his ‘African studies’ collection to none other than sister-publication Vogue’s Editor-in-Chief, Anna Wintour and Delphine Anrault, the executive vice president of Louis Vuitton and the founder of the Prize.

Shareholders of YG Entertainment are currently unhappy with the company as their stocks have plummeted in value by over 25% since the scandal surrounding Seungri began.

Massive international conglomerates like LVMH have pulled their investment from YG following the outbreak of the scandal. The company has lost just over 55 billion Won ($48.5 million) in investments. Stockholders are now demanding compensation from Yang Hyun Suk and the company for the significant losses they have incurred.

“Measures for People’s Livelihoods”, a civic group, has also gotten involved. They have filed a complaint with the Seoul Central District Prosecutor’s Office against Yang Hyun Suk for negligence involving the scandal. A representative said in a statement:

A public figure who exerts great influence in society shouldn’t be protected when they lack ethics and morality. Companies have been consistent in denying involvement in the event of inappropriate remarks and deviant acts made by celebrities. We need to make it clear that the company is also responsible. – Measures for People’s Livelihoods representative","{'label': 'Negative', 'score': 0.6385490894317627}",negative,0.6385490894317627,-1
