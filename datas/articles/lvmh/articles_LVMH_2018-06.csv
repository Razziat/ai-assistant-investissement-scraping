LVMH's Next Generation Seeks Change | BoF - The Business of Fashion,"Fri, 29 Jun 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzb2ZmYXNoaW9uLmNvbS9uZXdzL2x1eHVyeS9sdm1ocy1uZXh0LWdlbmVyYXRpb24tc2Vla3MtY2hhbmdlL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS, France — At last week's Louis Vuitton menswear show in Paris, newly hired designer Virgil Abloh sent hoodie-clad models down the runway toting duffel bags made from gleaming high-tech plastic, all to the latest Kanye West album. West, who embraced the tearful designer as he took his bows, was joined by his wife, Instagram super-influencer Kim Kardashian. Seated steps away: Bernard Arnault, head of parent company LVMH, and four of his adult children.

The duffels, embossed with the LV logo, were a far cry from the monogrammed brown bags that helped LVMH define and dominate the global luxury industry. They’re just one of the many ways the company is remaking itself as the next generation of Arnaults carves out a greater role. Of Bernard’s five children from two marriages, all but the youngest one hold senior positions at LVMH.

Over the past year, the multipronged group has shaken up its ranks of managers and designers, rolled out new e-commerce platforms and launched a makeup line with the singer Rihanna. It's become a patron of the French technology scene, subsidising workspace at a startup incubator and handing out awards to young entrepreneurs. Such moves contrast with LVMH's long-time modus operandi of acquiring iconic European brands and enhancing their exclusivity.

“Luxury companies are required to engage the consumer in ways they never did before,” said Mario Ortelli, who runs a London-based advisory firm on luxury strategy. “It’s become more of a collaboration” as the response on social media can either boost or sink new collections. The younger Arnaults, Ortelli said, “can look at this market with the eyes of someone who is closer to it” than their 69-year-old father.

Such moves contrast with LVMH's long-time modus operandi of acquiring iconic European brands.

Abloh's hiring illustrates the transformation. A Ghanaian-American streetwear designer, he was a creative consultant to West when he was spotted by Delphine Arnault, 43, Vuitton's executive vice president, and Alexandre Arnault, 26, head of the Rimowa luggage business. Abloh, who studied architecture rather than fashion, has a following of 2.6 million fans on Instagram, many of them willing to pay as much $2,500 for a pair of sneakers from his collaboration with Nike.

“What’s exciting about him is his approach, and the fact that he’s so open to the world,” Alexandre Arnault said before the show, standing on the rainbow-painted runway. In a nod to LVMH’s success with classic fashion, he added: “It’s about redefining the codes of luxury, making it more accessible for young people. The products will stay exclusive even if the approach is inclusive.”

Bernard Arnault doesn’t plan to retire for at least a decade, according to people familiar with his thinking, and there’s no clear front-runner to replace him. But as his children expand their influence, and as the serial deal-maker runs out of companies to buy, LVMH is reshaping the brands it already owns. It’s all with an eye to making them increasingly relevant to a generation of consumers more excited by Instagram posts and sneaker drops than by the editorial pages of Vogue. Arnault, the chief executive officer, declined to be interviewed.

The luxury business ""is not about It bags anymore,"" said Federica Levato, a partner at Bain & Co. in Milan. ""Streetwear, T-shirts, puffy jackets, are becoming an important part of the core collection."" In marketing to these customers, luxury houses have to focus not only on products but also on ""communication, visuals, social media, all the touchpoints.''

The company, 47 percent owned by the Arnault family, posted 43 billion euros ($50 billion) in sales last year, nearly three times the figure of its nearest competitor, Kering. Its portfolio of 70 brands, from Vuitton and Dior to Moet & Chandon Champagne and Tag Heuer watches, turned in robust 13 percent sales growth during the first quarter. Bernard Arnault is the world’s sixth-richest person with a fortune of $73 billion.

While LVMH doesn’t break out sales for individual brands, Louis Vuitton is the world’s largest and most profitable luxury brand, with sales of nearly $11 billion and an operating margin of 45 percent last year, according to HSBC. Shares of the parent company are up about 16 percent this year.

""Bernard Arnault has a sixth sense about what's next"" in luxury trends, said Ron Frasch, a former president of Saks Fifth Avenue who now works in private equity at Castanea Partners in New York.

LVMH can no longer count on acquisitions to supercharge growth.

Still, there are worrisome signs. Gucci, owned by Kering, is outpacing LVMH in the race for younger customers — an urgent concern, as 85 percent of growth in the luxury sector now comes from shoppers under age 38, according to Bain. Designer Alessandro Michele has rebooted Gucci with collections that pile on crystals, embroidered flowers, dragons, and cartoon cats. Gucci, which says 55 percent of its sales are to millennial shoppers, reported revenue up 49 percent in the first quarter of this year. That compares with 16 percent at LVMH's fashion and leather goods division, dominated by Vuitton.

LVMH can no longer count on acquisitions to supercharge growth. Starting in the late 1980s, Arnault snapped up dozens of mostly family-owned companies — fashion houses, watchmakers, champagne growers, and more — scaling them up and finding new markets for their products in the developing world, especially in China.

Nowadays, there are few opportunities for game-changing deals. The family owners of Hermès, the high-end handbag maker, rebuffed Arnault's efforts to build a stake in the company. The owners of privately held Chanel show no interest in selling, either. Arnault's last big acquisition, in 2017, was essentially a bookkeeping exercise: He spent about 12 billion euros to buy out minority shareholders in Christian Dior, which he already controlled, and fold it into LVMH.

Arnault and his team used to be known as “killers’’ who stalked the luxury sector for potential acquisitions, said Gachoucha Kretz, a marketing professor at French business school HEC. Now, “they are taking another path.”

That path includes new management and design talent. LVMH recently replaced the longtime head of Christian Dior with Pietro Beccari, former head of the Fendi unit. Beccari won acclaim there for his e-commerce savvy and for whimsical spectacles that raised awareness of the fur-and-handbags brand. One example: a show in which model and reality-TV star Kendall Jenner appeared to walk on water as she traversed a plexiglass runway over Rome's Trevi Fountain.

And the family has hired Hedi Slimane, the star designer who set the menswear agenda for more than a decade when he brought back skinny jeans and suits at Dior Homme in the early-to-mid-2000s. Slimane is set to show his first collection at Céline in September.

Abloh, whose appointment was announced in March, caught Delphine Arnault’s attention in 2015 when she made him a finalist in an annual competition to spot promising young designers. Delphine has become LVMH’s chief scout when it comes to design talent. She’s also inherited for father’s penchant for quality control, popping in unannounced at some of LVMH’s more than 4,000 stores around the world to make sure they’re up to snuff.

Abloh is ""a completely different generation,"" said Takashi Murakami, who worked with Vuitton on a series of multi-colored handbags in the early 2000s during the brand's first conversion from stuffy trunkmaker to veritable fashion brand under Marc Jacobs. ""When I was collaborating the first time with Marc Jacobs, at this moment the high fashion was the high fashion—-with very few black people. This time it's really with the hip-hop movement.""

As the younger Arnaults make their mark on LVMH, it's likely the company will become more open and transparent.

Chief executive Arnault has fast-tracked the careers of two younger sons from his second marriage. Alexandre helped seal the acquisition of Rimowa in 2016 and now runs the German luggage maker. Frederic, 23, became head of “connected technologies” at Tag Heuer last year after graduating from the elite Ecole Polytechnique, his father’s alma mater. The youngest, Jean, is still in school.

Alexandre Arnault has pushed LVMH to step up its digital efforts and helped persuade his father to bring aboard Ian Rogers, a former Apple executive, as the company's chief digital officer in 2015. ""Alexandre has been a big part of raising the importance of digital,"" Rogers said. ""He's part of start-up culture."" Alexandre also backed Abloh's bid for a top job at LVMH, collaborating with the designer on a collection of transparent suitcases that Rimowa sold for nearly $1,000. And it was Alexandre who accompanied his father on a New York trip to meet with President-elect Donald Trump at Trump Tower in early January 2017.

LVMH’s track record on e-commerce is mixed. Although some businesses, such as Vuitton and Sephora, have successful online boutiques, other efforts have stumbled. ELuxury, an online designer site, shut down in 2009 after failing to gain traction. Last year LVMH launched an online boutique and mobile app called 24 Sèvres, inspired by the group’s Left Bank department store Le Bon Marche. It has struggled to catch up with online luxury leaders such as like Net-a-Porter and Matchesfashion.com.

As the younger Arnaults make their mark on LVMH, it’s likely the company will become more open and transparent — a change that CEO Arnault acknowledged in a company memo naming his 41-year-old son, Antoine, as communications director in early June. “LVMH’s success attracts growing attention from the media, observers, public authorities, as well as the general public,” he wrote. Such openness could give LVMH greater name recognition outside France. Many of its customers have no idea that businesses ranging from Glenmorangie whisky to the Sephora cosmetics chain are owned by the group.

The senior Arnault still dictates strategy. At headquarters on Paris’s swank Avenue Montaigne, “to discuss anything important you have to go to the seventh floor,” where the chief executives’s office is located, said Ashok Som, who teaches luxury management France’s Essec business school. And why shouldn’t he call the shots? Said Som: “He started this whole industry.”

Antoine Arnault to Spearhead Communications at LVMH - WWD,"Mon, 04 Jun 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiQFodHRwczovL3d3ZC5jb20vYnVzaW5lc3MtbmV3cy9odW1hbi1yZXNvdXJjZXMvYW50b2luZS1hcm5hdWx0LW5hbWVkLWhlYWQtY29tbXVuaWNhdGlvbi1pbWFnZS1sdm1oLW1vZXQtaGVubmVzc3ktbG91aXMtdnVpdHRvbi0xMjAyNjg4ODA5L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS — Antoine Arnault has been named head of communication and image for LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, the luxury conglomerate headed by his father Bernard Arnault.

In an internal memo to staff sent on June 1, Bernard Arnault announced the appointment, saying it was a response to increased interest in the parent company of brands including Louis Vuitton, Christian Dior, Fendi, Guerlain, Bulgari and Sephora.

Underlining the success of the group, which last year supplanted petrol-maker Total as the number-one ranked stock by market capitalization on France’s CAC 40 stock market index, Arnault noted LVMH was coming under closer scrutiny from the media, observers, public authorities and the general public, especially on social media.

“In order to address this increased exposure and further enhance the evaluation of the group’s achievements, I have decided to strengthen the organization of our communication,” the chairman and chief executive officer of LVMH said, according to a copy of the memo obtained by WWD. This confirmed a Bloomberg report.

At 41, Antoine Arnault will add the new responsibilities to his existing roles as ceo of high-end men’s wear brand Berluti and chairman of Italian luxury house Loro Piana. “He will oversee all communication agencies working for the group and will promote a global strategy that will benefit everyone,” Bernard Arnault said.

The nomination follows the appointment last year of Jean-Charles Tréhan as external relations director of the group, as part of the ongoing efforts to bolster its internal communications structure. Tréhan will continue to report to Arnault.

The group’s communications officially fall under the remit of Nicolas Bazire, the managing director of Groupe Arnault, the investment firm controlled by the Arnault family. A member of the LVMH board of directors and executive committee, Bazire is in charge of development and acquisitions at the group.

An affable and enthusiastic executive, Antoine Arnault started his career with Internet start-up domainoo.com. He joined Vuitton in 2002, working in its marketing department and overseeing stores in the French provinces. He has been a member of LVMH’s board since 2006.

He was named Vuitton’s communications director in 2007, widening its advertising footprint to television and movie theaters, and expanding its online presence. He was named ceo of Berluti in 2011, while continuing as an adviser to Vuitton on communications.

That year, he also spearheaded an LVMH-wide initiative called Journées Particulières, inviting the public to visit European workshops across the group’s various business divisions, giving a behind-the-scenes insight into how jewelry, leather goods, Champagne and other products are made.

He was made chairman of Loro Piana in 2013, following LVMH’s acquisition earlier that year of an 80 percent stake in the cashmere specialist for 2 billion euros.

The appointment adds to the list of growing responsibilities for the children of Bernard Arnault, 69.

Delphine Arnault, Antoine’s 43-year-old sister, is second-in-command at Louis Vuitton, the largest and most profitable brand in the family-controlled group, and is a key force behind the annual LVMH Prize for Young Designers.

Bernard Arnault also has three younger children with his second wife, Canadian pianist Hélène Mercier. Alexandre Arnault is co-ceo of German luggage maker Rimowa, while Frédéric Arnault joined watchmaker Hublot in September as head of connected technologies."
"LVMH Has Been Working to Revamp its Image After Decades of ""Ruthless Corporate Raids"" - The Fashion Law","Mon, 04 Jun 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWZhc2hpb25sYXcuY29tL2x2bWgtaGFzLWJlZW4td29ya2luZy10by1yZXZhbXAtaXRzLWltYWdlL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Antoine Arnault, the son of LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton scion Bernard Arnault, is taking on a new role. The French multinational luxury goods conglomerate’s chairman, 69-year old Bernard Arnault sent a memo to employees on June 1 announcing Antoine’s new responsibilities in his role as the head of the group’s image and communication. According to Bloomberg, Arnault “stressed the importance of the role, saying his son will be in charge of managing the ‘growing attention’ in the company from the media and public, and pointing to social media as an area of particular focus.”

Antoine Arnault’s appointment is hardly a surprising move. The 40-year-old has been in the family business – alongside sister Delphine Arnault, 43, the executive vice president at Louis Vuitton, and more recently step-brothers Alexandre and Frederic Arnault – for over a decade, starting in the advertising department of marquee brand Louis Vuitton and ultimately moving to CEO of shoes-and-custom suiting brand Berluti and chairman of Italian fine wool specialist Loro Piana.

Even more significant than the family ties at play is the need for attention to the reputation of the corporate giant that is LVMH. The French multinational luxury goods conglomerate – which was formed in 1987 with the merger of fashion house Louis Vuitton with spirits group Moet Hennessy – has thrived under the control of Bernard Arnault. In his time as the group’s chair, Arnault has overseen the acquisitions of Louis Vuitton, Givenchy, Celine, Christian Dior, and Loewe, among 70 or so other fashion and non-fashion brands, and catapulted the group’s revenues to more than $50 billion per year.

It is hardly a secret for LVMH aficionados that the senior-most Arnault has run LVMH in a particular way, one that has seen him described by the press as “ruthless,” “able to exploit,” “famously litigious,” and “a wolf in cashmere clothing.” He is famous for “exploiting family disputes,” as the Financial Times put it; ousting creatives from their eponymous labels; and building up secret stakes in companies – on more than one occasion. You may recall that in the not too distant past, Arnault set his sights on Hermes and Gucci and incited attempts to takeover the two companies without their owners’ knowledge or approval.

These two specific takeover efforts were not ultimately successful, as neither Gucci nor Hermes call LVMH their parent. However, the conglomerate’s business of “aggressively monetizing creative talent” and operating as a “barbarian at the gilded gates” – the New York Times’ choice of words – has worked. Arnault, himself, is the fourth richest man in the world and the richest individual in fashion, thanks to the larger-than-life conglomerate he has built.

His billion-dollar acquisition exploits have not going unnoticed. Media outlets have begun to focus on the activities of fashion’s largest conglomerates with increasing vigor in the age of constant news coverage and social media scandals. Couple this increase in attention with the fact that news reports have found an indelible home on the web, no longer subject to the forgiveness that once came with tossed-away newspapers. This is something that any consumer-facing brand must wrestle with.

In terms of LVMH, this gives rise to the question of just how sustainable it is to engage in notoriously “aggressive corporate raiding.” Can such “ruthless decision-making” tactics be regularly undertaken by a publicly traded company in our inherently connected digital era when consumers have taken to demanding transparency from an increasing number of angles?

One might be able argue that LVMH was only able to secretly – and as a French court would hold, illegally – build up a 23.1 percent stake in Hermes and walk away relatively unscathed in terms of the media largely due to the climate at the time; WWD – which was still very much just a print publication at the time – covered the back-and-forth between LVMH and Hermes, as did financial sections of various mainstream newspapers. Nowadays though, there is simply so much more media attention surrounding LVMH and its corporate exploits … and it is all accessible by way of a simple Google search 24/7.

LVMH knows this. It also appears to understand that if it wants to maintain its level of extraordinary success, it must at least attempt to put forth a good face, after years of simply not operating that way. (To be fair, it didn’t really have to).

Such efforts by LVMH to perform in a way that is pleasing not only to shareholders but to the growing number of demanding consumers are coming on more than one front. For instance, last year, LVMH teamed up with its rival conglomerate Kering to establish a charter for the well-being of models that has been implemented across their rosters of brands. Certainly a show of good faith on behalf of the industry leader. Around the exact same time, LVMH also announced that it would invest more to improve its environmental credentials as fashion businesses seek to reassure shoppers who are increasingly drawn to eco-friendly brands.

Still yet, in March, LVMH vowed to take steps to close the gender gap. Ten years after the Paris-based conglomerate launched EllesVMH, a gender diversity-centric initiative, it announced that it would join a French task force on gender equality. In addition to France being the first European country to join this initiative, which was launched by the World Economic Forum, LVMH was the first French luxury group to announce its alliance with French President Emmanuel Macron’s gender equality task force.

And not to be left on the sidelines in terms of philanthropy and arts initiatives, LVMH funded and built Fondation Louis Vuitton, a gleaming arts museum situated along the western edge of the 16th arrondissement of Paris. Following a 55 year lease, so to speak, ownership of the museum will be transferred to the city of Paris as “a gift.”

Bernard Arnault said the Fondation, which opened in October 2014, is a “showing that we are very good (citizens) and that we are working not only for profit, but also for something that is transcendent.”

LVMH’s efforts are soundly in line with a rise in consumer awareness as to how, where, and by whom their clothing is being made, and the mounting reputational risk that comes with a lack of vigilance in this realm.

This is something that Antoine Arnault spoke to directly at a conference in Brussels last fall, saying: “We need to be more transparent. We can’t do everything in secret anymore.” He added, according to Bloomberg, that “the desire for a more open company was shared among the younger generation at LVMH.”

Taken together, these elements are all part of a broader strategic shift by LVMH. As the New York Times’ Vanessa Friedman wrote in late 2015, LVMH is shifting “from a global sector domination machine to a kinder, friendlier giant, an approach that has been shaped by Delphine Arnault, as well as her brother, Antoine, and one that it increasingly seems may define the group for the future.”

LVMH’s awareness of the “growing attention from the media, observers, public authorities, as well as the general public,” and specifically, the “increased exposure” – as Arnault’s memo worded it – that comes as a result, suggests that the group is well aware of the need to craft its reputation more carefully than it has in the past.

As for whether that means LVMH will not attempt to acquire your family brand right out from under you, that is another matter entirely."
"Label To Know: ROKH, Winner Of The LVMH Prize Special Prize 2018 - ELLE UK","Thu, 07 Jun 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVsbGUuY29tL3VrL2Zhc2hpb24vYTIxMDk1OTY0L2xhYmVsLXRvLWtub3ctcm9raC13aW5uZXItb2YtdGhlLWx2bWgtcHJpemUtc3BlY2lhbC1wcml6ZS0yMDE4L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"You'll no doubt know of Nicolas Ghesquière, the creative director of Louis Vuitton, Clare Waight Keller of Givenchy, and Karl Lagerfeld. Well, know that they're watching Rok Hwang, the man behind womenswear label ROKH, having awarded him this year's LVMH Prize Special Prize.

Coming in second to Japanese designer Masayuki Ino, creative director of streetwear brand, Doublet, Hwang still comes away with a hefty €150,000 (that's half of the winner's €300,000) and the promise of mentoring with a group of industry experts.

Ahead of travelling to Paris, where Hwang, Ino and the other finalists presented their work to Lagerfeld and co, and LVMH Prize ambassadors Emma Stone and Jaden Smith, ELLE met with the London-based designer to find out what makes his pieces so covetable.

‘You’d never guess it was this big from the outside.’ says ROKH designer, Rok Hwang, of his North London studio. In the same way that you wouldn’t guess his insouciant wardrobe staples are so cleverly constructed, concealing design elements that make his pieces fit just so.

It’s an impressive space for such a new brand, functioning as an atelier with separate teams working across production, fabric development and print. A window at the back wall looks out onto a white-walled space (like a record producer looks over a band recording) showing an all female team of all ages: pattern-cutters and machinists, draping and stitching new season samples.

The Korean born designer behind the brand came to fashion through music, moving to the UK from Austin, Texas, where he grew up in a caravan with his economist father. ‘It was exactly like you’d picture in an American movie.' So the split-studio set-up is a fitting home for the label he launched in 2016, with ‘re-editions of the classics’ - double placket shirts with trailing sleeves and popper-fasten tailoring.

‘We might have to move already. Things are growing fast,’ says Rok when we meet just weeks after a stint in Paris, meeting the star designers on the LVMH Prize panel. Familiar faces, having spent three years working with Phoebe Philo at Céline, joining Philo for her first collection in 2010, before leaving to work for Chloe and Louis Vuitton.

Given his experience, it’s no wonder that Rok found himself on the LVMH Prize shortlist - or that it was LVMH that approached him. ‘We’ve been trying to build the brand slowly, so it wasn’t our intention to end up on the shortlist,’ he laughs. ‘But it’s been really rewarding, spending time in the showroom, and having designers like Nicolas Ghesquiere compliment your work.’

Rok’s easy-to-wear tailoring hints at his menswear background, having studied BA Menswear before specialising in womenswear on the MA course at Central Saint Martins, and at Céline. ‘I learnt a lot from Phoebe Philo,’ he says of his time there. She tried everything on, and that’s important.’ So his all-female team are always trying things on, walking the length of the studio to get a real sense of movement. ‘It’s important for me to listen to them and ask if they’d actually wear something, and how they’d style it. We’re always having those conversations.’

You see that in the pieces. There’s something intuitive in the fluidity of ROKH’s style, with choice built into the garments. You can button those trailing sleeves, remove a notched collar, fasten a double-placket shirt to fit tightly or fall loosely around the body to suit multiple moods. ‘You can compliment a woman, even in oversized pieces, when you think about designing for how she feels.’

‘It’s about feeling and function,’ Rok adds. Extending to the practical outerwear, now signature pieces buyers are responding well to, including a woven silk double-breasted car coat, and a gabardine trench. There are bags too, produced in the same factory as Loewe, with functional pouches that can be mixed and matched, just big enough to fit an iPad. He’s got it all wrapped up with something for every category. Just don’t call ROKH androgynous, he says. ‘I’m over that. This is tailoring. And women wear trousers. In every sense,’ he laughs.

This piece originally appeared in ELLE's July 2018 issue, available now.

First to arrive was Mike Eckhaus, one half of New York-based gender-neutral label Eckhaus Latta, who with his partner Zoe Latta already landed in Paris a week ago. ""I'm feeling confident and I'm happy to be here,"" said Eckhaus, while steaming a range of garments from the brand's archive as he mentally prepared for next day's presentation.

The room quickly filled up with the remaining eight finalists which include A-Cold Wall by Samuel Ross; Botter by Rushemy Botter and Lisi Herrebrugh; Charles Jeffrey Loverboy by Charles Jeffrey; Doublet by Masayuki Ino; Eckhaus Latta by Mike Eckhaus and Zoe Latta; Kwaidan Editions by Léa Dickely and Hung La; Rokh by Rok Hwang; Ludovic de Saint Sernin; and Matthew Adams Dolan.

Newly made friends including the designers behind Kwaidan Editions and Eckhaus Latta, as well as Botter and Doublet, quickly greeted each other while they reflected on their labels’ progression since they last saw each other in March during the semi-finals. Despite being in competition for the €300,000 prize, designers portrayed calm in the 24 hours leading up to the big reveal during which the finalists expressed admiration for each other’s work.

""I don't expect to win,"" Masayuki Ino said with a laugh on Tuesday. He said the highlight of the competition was ""when Haider Ackermann saw my collection in the semi-final and told me that John Galliano would be jealous of my materials.""

On Wednesday, Ino was crowned the winner of this year's LVMH Prize. ""I'm very surprised and confused,"" said the designer. The award granted the designer with €300,000 in prize money and a year-long mentorship from executives at the luxury conglomerate, including Sophie Brocart, senior vice president of LVMH's fashion ventures, and chief executive of Nicholas Kirkwood.

The Japanese gender-fluid streetwear label, known for its innovate textile-designs and way of merchandising product, was praised by judges for its approach to texture and its humorous designs. The brand was founded in 2012 and shows during Tokyo Fashion Week. It currently has 25 global stockists including Dover Street Market and 10 Corso Como. Ino himself was born in Gunma province in 1979 and graduated from Tokyo Mode Academy School and has experience working for Miharayasuhiro as shoe and accessory design chief.

""[Ino's work] felt like a modern-day Issey Miyake,"" said Clare Waight Keller, artistic director of Givenchy. ""He pushes the boundaries of textiles and clothes and even though he has a language barrier, he presented his collection very well.""

""I was completely amazed by the modernity of his textures,"" agreed Nicolas Ghesquière, creative director of Louis Vuitton womenswear. ""I've been on this jury for five years and this year I felt it was important to celebrate execution.""

Ino said he didn't know just yet where to allocated the cash injection and mentorship towards.

""I'm really happy a Japanese designer won. It's the first time,"" said Louis Vuitton executive vice president Delphine Arnault, crediting Ino's well developed technical skills and keen eye for unique product.

A runner-up Special Prize was also awarded to Korean-born designer Rok Hwang, whose London-based womenswear label is characterised by elegant, adaptable garments which play with the contrast between femininity and masculinity. The label, now only in its third season, already has over 100 stockists including L'eclaireur, Lane Crawford and KM20.

He received a grant of €150,000 and year-long mentorship from the LVMH group, which the designer said he would use towards ""creating a strong foundation for the company"" by hiring specialised people in fields, as well as invest in ""visual merchandising in order to connect to customers more directly.""

Within five years, the accolade, which was created by Arnault in 2014, has positioned itself as the holy grail of fashion prizes among emerging designers. The award’s prestige stems from the grand sum of prize money offered to its winners, a cast of star designers as jury and a direct affiliation to LVMH, the world’s largest luxury conglomerate.

On the prize itself, the finalists unanimously agreed: it’s the biggest prize for emerging designers in the world. “You can’t compare the quality of the judges and the visibility the prize gives to anything else,” said Léa Dickely while fitting a double-breasted, python-printed coat from Kwaidan Editions’s latest collection on one of her three models.

“The power lies in the well-executed prize itself, as well as the amazing selection of [shortlisted] designers,” agreed Parisian designer Ludovic de Saint Sernin who, only two seasons in, is the group’s youngest finalist. “It’s an amazing opportunity to stand in front of all the creative directors of LVMH and show them your collections, it’s very rewarding.”

This year's nine finalists were selected from over 1,300 applications and 90 countries. The selection, which included three design duos as well as three brands creating gender-neutral fashion, was made by a jury comprised of nine creative directors from LVMH-owned fashion houses including Karl Lagerfeld, Nicolas Ghesquière and Maria Grazia Chiuri, along with Delphine Arnault, Jean-Paul Claverie, Sidney Toledano and Pierre-Yves Roussel of LVMH, as well as a panel of 48 additional fashion experts, including Vogue China editor Angelica Cheung, art director Fabien Baron and Dior face Bella Hadid.

While winning the competition was top of mind for each finalist — most brands admitted that victory would enable them to expand their teams, open mono-brand retail and restructure the communication strategies of their labels — all brands agreed the experience itself had already significantly increased their exposure among international press, buyers and consumers, and to an extent had set up their businesses for future success as a result.

For LVMH, not only is the prize a major PR-moment, as well as a good occasion to align itself with young fashion talent, it mostly serves as the perfect opportunity for the group to boost its talent pipeline by identifying and forging relationships with top emerging designers early on in their careers. It's telling when looking at the track record of past finalists who have grown successful companies of their own or have been appointed by the group. Virgil Abloh, artistic director of Louis Vuitton Men's, was a finalist of the prize in 2015. And most recently, Dior Homme hired 2017 finalist Yoon Ahn as its jewellery designer.

As for Ino and Hwang, the win shouldn't be taken lightly. While the prize has proven to grow the business of many past winners including Marine Serre, Marques' Almeida and Jacquemus, success isn't guaranteed. Since winning the prize in 2014, both Thomas Tait and Hood by Air have discontinued their lines, while 2016 Special Prize winner Vejas Kruszewski recently postponed his label to join Italian leather brand Pihakapi.

The key to sustainable growth, according to last year’s Grand Prize winner Marine Serre, is to be hyper-aware of the speed at which prize money is being spent. “It goes quite quickly,” she said. To which 2016 winners Marques’ Almeida added: “Use the money wisely and face the challenges that get thrown your way.”

But Ino wasn't worried about what’s ahead. “I'm going to take it step by step to ensure sustainable growth. I'm going to grow at my own pace.”

Masayuki Ino's Label Doublet Wins LVMH Prize for Young Designers - WWD,"Wed, 06 Jun 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3dkLmNvbS9mZWF0dXJlL21hc2F5dWtpLWluby1kb3VibGV0LXdpbm5lci0yMDE4LWx2bWgtcHJpemUtZm9yLXlvdW5nLWRlc2lnbmVycy1lbW1hLXN0b25lLTEyMDI2OTM0ODIv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS — Japanese designer Masayuki Ino won the 2018 edition of the LVMH Prize for Young Designers with his streetwear label Doublet, underscoring the appeal of gender-neutral, casual designs for a new generation of consumers keen to shed traditional labels.

Emma Stone, speaking in French, announced the winner on Wednesday at the Fondation Louis Vuitton in Paris in the presence of jury members including Karl Lagerfeld of Fendi, Dior designer Maria Grazia Chiuri, Louis Vuitton’s Nicolas Ghesquière and Givenchy’s Clare Waight Keller.

Ino beat some 1,300 applicants to walk away with a grand prize of 300,000 euros, plus a year of coaching from experts at luxury giant LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, parent of fashion houses including Vuitton, Loewe, Céline, Berluti and Marc Jacobs.

The runner-up special prize, presented by Jaden Smith, went to South Korean designer Rok Hwang’s London-based women’s wear label Rokh.

At 38, Ino was the oldest candidate among the nine finalists of this year’s edition of the prize. A graduate of Tokyo’s Mode Gakuen College of Fashion and Design, he worked as an accessories designer for Miharayasuhiro before launching Doublet in 2012 with a concept he summed up as “daily wear with strangeness.”

His graphic, tongue-in-cheek designs, such as sweatshirts featuring distorted riffs on varsity logos, have been worn by celebrities such as Travis Scott, Kendall Jenner and Liam Payne. The label received a major boost last year when it was one of six brands selected by the Tokyo Fashion Award, which promotes Japanese fashion overseas.

Doublet’s spring collection, stocked at Dover Street Market in London and 10 Corso Como in Shanghai, featured plastic-covered T-shirts. His presentation on Wednesday included lenticular prints, tailored jackets made of selvage Harrisons cloth, and compression T-shirts that expand when soaked in water.

“I want customers to enjoy not only the buying experience, but to continue having fun after shopping. That’s why the packaging is important,” Ino said through an interpreter.

Ghesquière said the jury was won over by the originality of the designs. “He’s unlike anyone else. It’s completely individual, and in his category — which can be loosely defined as sportswear, but in fact is so much more — there’s a quality of execution and a level of technical research that are really impressive,” he said.

“What struck me during his presentation is that it’s one thing when you see his clothes on the hanger, but when you see them in movement, they take on a different life because they’re extremely light, and in that respect, very unique and modern,” Ghesquière added.

Waight Keller, joining LVMH’s star-studded jury for the first time, was impressed by Ino’s passion for fabric development and his plays on product packaging.

“It’s really a kind of 360-degree view he had on that, and it felt fresh and modern — almost like a modern-day Issey Miyake, experimenting, trying new technology and really trying to push the boundaries of how you view textiles and how you interpret it into clothes,” she explained.

“We all loved that passion that he had, and even the fact he has somewhat of a language barrier, he still really tried to communicate his passion and we felt he just presented an idea in a unique way,” she added.

Ino, whose brand is sold in 30 stores in Japan and another 25 worldwide, said he was “very honored” by the Miyake comparison, but hopes to remain grounded. He doesn’t know yet how he will spend the prize money, though he may expand his team, which consists of just four people at present.

“What’s important for me is not spending a lot. I want to stay who I am and keep the environment,” he said.

The past four winners of the main prize are Thomas Tait, Marques’Almeida, Grace Wales Bonner and Marine Serre, and the award has also boosted the careers of its runner-up special-prize winners: Hood by Air, Miuniku, Jacquemus, Vejas and Kozaburo Akasaka.

Hwang, who won a grant of 150,000 euros and a one-year mentorship from the LVMH group, also hopes to hire more staff. The Central Saint Martins graduate, who has worked at Louis Vuitton, Chloé and Céline, launched his label in 2016.

“I’m also looking forward to getting mentorship from LVMH and then to build strong foundations so I can actually operate much more fluidly,” he said.

“In practical terms, I have to be honest, every single moment is a challenge day-to-day. It’s never the same. I am a creative, so to understand the business, admin side of it, or to understand the logistics and deliveries and everything, it’s all new information,” he said.

“Fashion school teaches you everything, but I think it’s a different story when you’re actually starting your own business,” he remarked.

Indeed, the experience of previous winners illustrates the pitfalls awaiting fledgling brands in an increasingly crowded field. Tait and Hood by Air no longer produce collections, while Vejas Kruszewski has put his label on ice to become creative director of Pihakapi, a brand from Italian leather apparel producer Pelle Moda.

Delphine Arnault, the force behind the prize and a key talent scout at LVMH, said failure was always a risk, but that should not deter young designers.

“Just because you fail once, it doesn’t mean you can’t go on to achieve great things. In fact, the best entrepreneurs always say that it’s through failure that they’ve learned the most,” she said. “That’s common wisdom in the tech world, but in France, we don’t really have a culture of failure.”

Arnault can draw on a deep well of entrepreneurial experience: not only is she second-in-command at Louis Vuitton, the largest and most profitable brand in the family-controlled group, but her father is LVMH chairman and chief executive officer Bernard Arnault, and her partner is tech entrepreneur Xavier Niel.

She underlined that for every winner that has struggled, there are success stories such as Serre, who won the main prize last year and dropped by to update the jury on her progress. “She has doubled her number of points of sale and she has done a lot of work on bolstering the production side,” Arnault reported.

Sidney Toledano, who joined the jury this year in his new role as chairman and ceo of LVMH Fashion Group, said he was confident about many of the finalists. “They are start-ups — they’re not just young designers,” he said.

“They want to be creative and stand out, but they’re also aware of issues like production and pricing. When they present their products, they talk about everything: image, distribution points, digital,” he added. “Whether they’re 27 or 39, they all have that vision — that’s what’s terrific.”

He noted that the immediacy of social media has also forced designers to become more pragmatic.

“It cuts out the need for go-betweens, who would sometimes have to explain to designers that something wasn’t working. They would be afraid, because [the designers] were such divas. Nowadays, they see it for themselves. That’s why they’re realistic: because they’re faced with customers’ reactions and opinions,” Toledano said.

He emphasized that this didn’t amount to crowdsourcing design. “They are also creative people because they see what other people are doing and they want to be different, so they’re innovative. They try to offer something else,” he said.

As a result, presentation skills have become more important than ever. “Communication is fundamental in fashion, especially with today’s social networks,” Arnault said. “It’s an integral part of the job of designer. They must both create and communicate.”

The other brands on the short list included gender-neutral designers Matthew Adams Dolan, based in New York; Ludovic de Saint Sernin from Paris; Zoe Latta and Mike Eckhaus of the New York-based label Eckhaus Latta, and Glaswegian designer Charles Jeffrey, whose Charles Jeffrey Loverboy brand extends to a nightclub.

Rounding out the list were A-Cold-Wall, a British men’s wear label designed by Samuel Ross; Kwaidan Editions, a London-based women’s wear brand by Léa Dickely and Hung La, and Antwerp-based men’s wear brand Botter, by Rushemy Botter and Lisi Herrebrugh.

LVMH also rewarded three graduates: Archie M. Alled-Martínez from Central Saint Martins, Maya Chantout from Ecole de la Chambre Syndicale de la Couture Parisienne and Scylia Chevaux from Accademia Costume & Moda. They will join Givenchy, Céline and Louis Vuitton, respectively, for one year."

LVMH, Dior’s parent company, signed a lease “literally a day ago” for a “little over 4,000 square feet,” on the ground floor in “The Great Room” at the Shops & Restaurants at Hudson Yards, according to Webber Hudson, an executive vice president at Related Urban, the mixed-use development division of Related Companies.

Webber said the deal at the building, which sits along 10th Avenue between 10 Hudson Yards and 30 Hudson Yards, was handled by Related’s in-house team.

He declined to provide any deal details, but said the 720,000-square-foot shops and restaurants center is 80 percent leased. Hudson expects to seal deals for another 10 percent by opening day March 14, 2019.

A few newly announced tenants include Van Cleef, Cartier and Piaget. Leases are out with Tiffany & Co. as well as Sergio Rossi and Muji, sources said. (Webber declined to comment on deals that weren’t closed.)

PARIS (Reuters) - Antoine Arnault, one of LVMH (LVMH.PA) Chairman and CEO Bernard Arnault's five children and an executive in charge of several brands at the luxury group, will oversee communications and image issues at the company, according to an internal memo.

LVMH, the world's biggest luxury conglomerate and owner of labels such as Louis Vuitton and Christian Dior, has long been tightly run by the Arnault family and its patriarch, who built up the group through acquisitions.

The latest appointment adds to Antoine Arnault's public profile. Communications had previously fallen under the remit of Nicolas Bazire, in charge of development and acquisitions and managing director of Groupe Arnault, the family holding company that has a 47 percent stake in LVMH.

The group made the change at a time of ""increased exposure"", including from public authorities and on social media, Bernard Arnault said in the internal memo seen by Reuters.

Antoine Arnault, 41 - CEO of LVMH's Berluti, known for its high-end men's shoes, and chairman of luxury cashmere label Loro Piana - was already behind some communications initiatives at the group. They included organizing ""open days"" for the public at some brands.

Most of Bernard Arnault's other children also work at LVMH. Daughter Delphine, 43, is number two at mega-brand Vuitton, the group's biggest revenue driver. Son Alexandre, 26, runs German luggage brand Rimowa, which LVMH bought in 2016, and Frederic, 23, is head of connected technologies at watch brand Tag Heuer.

The youngest son, Jean, is still a student.

Asked on several occasions which of his children was likely to succeed him, Bernard Arnault has always said the job would go to the most capable and the one who could combine business acumen with creative flair, without giving a name.

Luxury firms from LVMH to Cartier-owner Richemont are bolstering their web presence, and high-end jewellery and watches — once thought unlikely to attract online shoppers given their high price tags — are emerging as one key battleground.

Though the market for premium clothing remains much larger, jewellery sales grew faster than any other part of the luxury goods industry last year bar shoes, rising 10 percent at constant currencies €17 billion euros (£14.9 billion), according to consultancy Bain.

24Sèvres, the web retailer launched by LVMH last year listing fashion items from its own labels and competitors like Italy's Valentino, said in a statement it would as of Thursday feature a fine jewellery section, with items from 13 brands.

The site previously only sold earrings, necklaces or rings belonging to the clothing labels listed on the platform like Vuitton, but it will now market items from specialist jewellers like Parisian brand Ofee.

The most affordable pieces will retail at around $90, will prices rising to $2,500.

Yoox Net-a-Porter, one of the online luxury world's most established players and which is coming under the full control of Richemont, said in April it would open a dedicated watch and jewellery section on its platform.

YNAP had already partnered with brands experimenting with online sales in this category, often for one-off runs of a product. In March its men's style site Mr Porter featured its most expensive item yet, a $480,000 watch by French label Bell & Ross.

Since 2014, luxury juggernaut LVMH has organised its annual Prize to highlight and support the work of designers emerging on the international scene. Hot on the heels of Marine Serre last year, Grace Wales Bonner in 2016 and Marques’ Almeida in 2015, the labels Doublet and Rokh were recompensed this year by a jury made up of artistic directors at LVMH houses including Jonathan Anderson (Loewe), Karl Lagerfeld (Fendi), Maria Grazia Chiuri (Dior) and Clare Waight Keller (Givenchy). For this 5th event, Emma Stone awarded the jury’s Grand Prize to Japanese designer Masayuki Ino, founder of the label Doublet, while Jaden Smith awarded the Special Prize to the London-based label Rokh of Korean designer Rok Hwang. “We were impressed by the contemporary ingenuity of the creations by Masayuki Ino for Doublet, an urban vision marked by elegant and fun sportswear. We also rewarded Rok Hwang for Rokh with a Special Prize. We were seduced by his silhouettes that are feminine, sensual and conquering, and by his mastery of complex cuts”, enthused Delphine Arnault. In addition to a year of mentoring, the two labels will receive 300,000 euros and 150,000 euros respectively.

Doublet by Masayuki Ino

Grand Prize: Doublet Established in 2012, the Doublet label is the result of a collaboration between 39-year old Japanese designer Masayuki Ino and the internationally renowned artist Takashi Murakami. A graduate of Tokyo Mode Academy, Masayuki Ino has developed a unisex label that blends oriental and western aesthetics in colourful and deconstructed creations. The designer, who defines his style in three words, “humour, strangeness and comfort”, reinvents sportswear classics with oversize cuts and the appliqueing of multiple patches featuring symbols from popular culture. Influenced by Jeremy Scott, skate and BMX culture, Masayuki Ino imbues his 1990s-accented creations with punky references. A model with neon pink spiky hair sporting his creations on the label’s Instagram account says it all. Already a winner at the Tokyo Fashion Awards in 2017, Masayuki Ino was selected as one of 9 finalists for the LVMH Prize for his sense of innovation and his conceptual approach to packaging. While his t-shirts compressed into a noodle box have to be rehydrated to unfold them, his shirts are pleated and laminated and have to be torn to be worn.

""The founders remain committed to Edun's mission for sustainable fashion,"" a joint statement sent by LVMH said.

LVMH Divests From Edun | BoF - The Business of Fashion,"Thu, 28 Jun 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzb2ZmYXNoaW9uLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy9sdXh1cnkvbHZtaC1kaXZlc3RzLWZyb20tZWR1bi_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"NEW YORK, United States — Edun, the made-in-Africa fashion brand founded in 2004 by Ali Hewson and her husband, U2's Bono, is ceasing its current operations, BoF has learned.

LVMH, which first invested in Edun in 2009 and currently owns a 49 percent stake in the label, is set to transfer its shares back to the founders. Employees were notified in May of the company’s dissolution. The label’s Spring/Summer 2018 collection will be its last to be produced. Edun’s single storefront, on Lafayette Street in Manhattan, closed at the end of May 2018.

The label, founded with the ethically minded mission of bringing awareness — and work — to African artisans and manufacturers, confirmed the separation. It is currently unclear if or how Edun may be revived in the future.

“In light of a joint review of the business, Edun is restructuring its operations in preparation for its next chapter and LVMH will transfer its shares back to the founders,” a representative for Edun said in a statement. “The founders remain committed to Edun’s mission for sustainable fashion and thank LVMH for its support and dedication during this journey together.”

Current chief executive Julien Labat will remain with Edun through the transition.

Edun received early attention — and accolades — for its support of sustainable development in Africa, from agriculture to manufacturing. For instance, it worked for six years with 8,000 farmers in Northwest Uganda on growing cotton. The company also lobbied the US Congress in support of the retention of the African Goals and Opportunities Act (AGOA) — legislation that helped factories across the continent by improving economic relations between the US and Africa — and worked to have it reinstated in Madagascar, where it says 50,000 jobs were lost when it was temporarily revoked.

However, Edun failed to establish a coherent visual identity and pricing strategy. And as with many of its mission-driven peers — including Suno and Maiyet — the challenges of producing consistent product in developing regions created back-end bottlenecks. Today, the industry as a whole is investing more in African manufacturing and production, partially thanks to Edun’s efforts. In many ways, the company suffered from the disadvantages of being a first-mover.

What’s more, while Edun's ethical mission was thought to be a compelling point of differentiation when the company was first founded, it ultimately wasn't enough in the eyes of consumers, who did not see the product as desirable enough.

The brand rotated through several designers, starting with Rogan Gregory, who departed in 2007, then Sharon Wauchob, who stayed on for six seasons. In 2013, Danielle Sherman, a veteran of The Row and Alexander Wang, joined the company. She exited in 2016.

Meanwhile, pricing and distribution changed time and again. In its first iteration, Edun was positioned at the lower end of the contemporary category, sold at specialty retailers like the Urban Outfitters-owned Anthropologie. When Sherman came on, the official launch partner was Barneys New York and prices edged into the designer realm.

Since then, Labat, who made a name for himself at Carven before joining Edun in 2015, has attempted to reposition the brand once again, focusing on direct sales — opening a store in New York’s Soho neighborhood, where the label’s design offices are based — and choosing not to hire a head designer but work with a team instead. However, retailers were confused by yet another shift in strategy, and not confident that the brand would survive much longer. The collection was most recently available in just 15 doors outside of its own directly operated store and e-commerce.

Edun is not the first Hewson-founded brand with which LVMH has parted ways. In 2016, the group sold natural line Nude Skincare to Counter Brands — the parent company of Beautcounter — for an undisclosed sum. Hewson joined the Counter Brands board, and both she and Bono invested in the fast-growing startup.

LVMH Prize winners and where are they now? - VOGUE India,"Sun, 03 Jun 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZvZ3VlLmluL2NvbnRlbnQvbHZtaC1wcml6ZS13aW5uZXJzLXdoZXJlLWFyZS10aGV5LW5vd9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The mythology of the fashion prize is part of the industry's folklore. So it goes that an obscure young designer working away with impecunious inventiveness is discovered by a fabulous fairy godmother and given a fast-track ticket to international acclaim. Off they go, happily ever after. The end.

In reality, it's less of a fairy tale and more of a cautionary tale. For, as every young designer knows, the challenges of establishing an independent label can make it almost impossible to do, even with financial support, chattering buzz and thousands of Instagram likes. One could argue that the seemingly glittering spotlight can even go as far as to be a deterrent to real sustainable growth and brand building. For every success story, there is a defunct label that once showed a promising start.

The LVMH Prize is the brainchild of Louis Vuitton executive vice president Delphine Arnault. It's open to designers under the age of 40 who have produced at least two collections. The winner receives €300,000, plus a year of mentorship from LVMH and its network. It also offers a runner-up Special Prize of €150,000 and similar mentorship opportunities. Thanks to the prominence of its sponsor and the eminence of its jury—a pantheon of the conglomerate's star designers such as Karl Lagerfeld, Nicolas Ghesquière and Marc Jacobs—the Prize has quickly established itself as one of the most prestigious and valuable contests in the world for young fashion designers. This year, more than 1,300 designers representing 90 nationalities applied.

Of its winners, many have gone on to become the most exciting names on fashion-week schedules—Marques Almeida, Wales Bonner, Marine Serre, Jacquemus, to name just a few—and even others who haven't won have gone far. Virgil Abloh, for instance, was merely a finalist in 2015—three years later, he's the new artistic director of menswear for Louis Vuitton.

So what makes this prize so special? “You're being judged by designers,” says Marta Marques, one half Marques Almeida, which won the LVMH Prize in 2015 and has since established itself as a steadily thriving business. “To speak to them about the struggle of creating a brand, and balancing the creative and business sides—you don't get that with any other prizes, and that helped us with cementing where we were going.” Marques points out that what also set the award apart was the mentorship from Sophie Brocart, senior vice president of LVMH's fashion ventures and CEO of Nicholas Kirkwood. “To have that huge level of expertise on the other end of a phone call or email was really precious. We could bring expert knowledge to the fields that weren't our strong point.”"
Inside Rimowa's Off-White Collaboration with Virgil Abloh and Alexandre Arnault - The Business of Fashion,"Tue, 05 Jun 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMipgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5idXNpbmVzc29mZmFzaGlvbi5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvbHV4dXJ5L3doYXQtb2ZmLXdoaXRlcy1yaW1vd2EtY29sbGFib3JhdGlvbi1zYXlzLWFib3V0LXRoZS1mdXR1cmUtb2YtbHV4dXJ5LXN0cmVldHdlYXItdmlyZ2lsLWFibG9oLWFsZXhhbmRyZS1hcm5hdWx0LWx2bWgv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS, France — When Alexandre Arnault became co-chief executive of Rimowa in October 2016, following its sale to LVMH for €640 million, the 26-year-old son of LVMH chairman Bernard Arnault set about pushing the German luggage label, best known for its ribbed aluminium suitcases, into new territories.

First came a collaboration with the Roman fur and leather house Fendi, followed by a partnership with Los Angeles-based Anti Social Social Club. But it was the company’s tie-up with billion-dollar streetwear juggernaut Supreme that really made a splash.

Now, Arnault is about to drop what could be one of Rimowa's biggest product collaborations to date: a pair of transparent polycarbonate suitcases created in partnership with Virgil Abloh's haute streetwear sensation Off-White.

“At LVMH, we have a saying that we like to be between tradition and modernity. Rimowa is a 120-year-old brand and what we’re doing with Virgil is a great example of modernity,” explained Arnault, who first teased the collaboration on his personal Instagram account in September 2017 and will officially debut the resulting product on June 20 at Off-White’s Paris menswear show.

The move comes as more and more luxury brands are tapping the cultural energy and business model of streetwear to stay relevant with millennial customers, who drove 85 percent of luxury growth last year and increasingly demand newness and novelty.

“Maybe there’s a bit of fatigue from customers of traditional brands and they’re excited by fresh products done in a different way and this is something that’s really well embraced by streetwear,” said Arnault. “One collaboration in itself won’t be a key sales driver, but ultimately the social media value of them is extremely important for driving awareness and desirability.”

Rimowa will follow the Off-White initiative with a partnership with Parisian streetwear label NasaSeasons. But Arnault says he isn’t planning to continue product collaborations at this pace. “You’ll see us come with collaborations for sure but not all in the same space or at the same scale every two months. I’m very cautious of one collaboration too many.”

Abloh said suitcase he created for Rimowa is transparent in order to let consumers participate in the design process, much as he has with some of his recent sneaker designs for Nike.

“It’s like 3.0 of personalisation. It’s not just putting your initials on it but allowing another layer to come in play,” he explained. “There’s an emotional component to owning [the suitcase] and you become a performance art piece just by using the thing. It’s like putting your items on display and rethinking the premise of a product.”

Abloh was recently named men's artistic director of Louis Vuitton as part of a series of changes on the men's side of LVMH, including the appointment of Kim Jones at Dior Homme and the appointment of Kris Van Assche at Berluti. Both Jones and Van Assche are known for their modern, streetwear-savvy sensibilities.

But although the worlds of streetwear and luxury are undoubtedly merging as part of a wider generational shift, Arnault is quick to note that quality will remain a long-term marker of authentic luxury goods. “The thing that changed is the way luxury goods are perceived, marketed and distributed,” he explained. “But people are willing to pay a premium if we know a product comes from a trusted brand with quality craftsmanship — that won’t change.”

It's like 3.0 of personalisation. It's not just putting your initials on it but allowing another layer to come in play.

“Heritage, quality, craftsmanship and authenticity from the preceding generation of luxury, that’s valuable. Those things won’t waver,” agreed Abloh, “But being a part of the new era is the halo effect, the cultural attachment and relevance. Married in the right way you have the future of how a brand can be one-part luxury from the preceding generation and coveted by the next generation. That’s the unique fit going forward.”

Abloh’s ability to bring his streetwear-infused aesthetic to a major European luxury house will be put to the test later this month when he shows his debut collection for Louis Vuitton.

“What you’ll see with what Kim and Virgil are doing at Dior Homme and Louis Vuitton isn’t the most streetwear-inspired collection — you’re not walking into a skate shop,” hinted Arnault. “They also have to adapt to codes, quality criteria and brand DNA.”

Editor's Note: This article was revised on June 5, 2018. A previous version of this article misstated that Rimowa's collaboration with Off-White included two suitcases with the words 'PERSONAL' and 'BELONGINGS' emblazoned on them. This is incorrect. These models were first teased on Alexandre Arnault's personal Instagram but will not go into production.

By Park Jae-hyuk



LVMH Cosmetics' Korean affiliate has been ordered to stop selling and recall Dior Nail Glow, which is alleged to contain harmful substances, the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety said Tuesday.



The ministry urged consumers, who bought the cosmetics product, to take the defective item back to the seller.



LVMH Cosmetics is a perfume and cosmetics unit of LVMH, a French multinational luxury goods conglomerate which owns Louis Vuitton, Givenchy, Dior, Fendi, TAG Heuer and Marc Jacobs.



In Korea, LMVH Cosmetics is better known as an importer of luxury cosmetics brands, including Guerlain, Dior, Givenchy, Benefit, Make Up For Ever and Fresh.



Dior Nail Glow has been popular with Korean consumers, who want to make their nails look brighter and ""younger.""



The local affiliate has imported the product from the French-based manufacturer, Parfums Christian Dior.



According to the authorities, the problematic products were found to contain fluorescent brightener 367.



Commonly known as white dye, the chemical compound absorbs light in the ultraviolet and violet region of the electromagnetic spectrum, and re-emits light in the blue region by fluorescence.



The additive is often used to enhance the appearance of the color of fabric and paper, causing a whitening effect.



However, some brighteners can cause allergic reactions when in contact with skin, depending on the individual.



Since concerns over the safety of the compound grew here in 2008, the Korean government has recommended manufacturers not to add the substance to products that can be absorbed into skin.



""Although the United States and Europe have yet to prohibit manufacturers from adding fluorescent brightener to cosmetics, Korea has banned cosmetics manufacturers from using it, as a preemptive measure,"" an official of the ministry said.



Some scientists categorize some types of fluorescent brightener as carcinogens, according to industry officials.



In 2016, Lotte Mart voluntarily recalled its private labeled detergent for fruits and vegetables, after finding out the product containing fluorescent brightener.

The location? The new Gucci ArtLab. The occasion? An investor day for Kering, Gucci’s parent company, with Marco Bizzarri, the chief executive of Gucci, taking on a starring role in front of the assembled crowd. His topic: A master plan to make Gucci the largest luxury brand in the world.

“It’s not a question of if,” he said, “but when.”

The brand had just posted record annual sales of 6.2 billion euros, or about $7.1 billion, in 2017, a 45 percent increase from the prior year. Now it planned to reach €10 billion in annual sales and a 40 percent operating margin by 2019.

To do so, Kering, which has holdings in fine jewelry and watches as well as fashion, confirmed a wider strategy already underway to narrow its focus to five of its premium houses: Gucci, Saint Laurent, Balenciaga, Alexander McQueen and Bottega Veneta."

While Doublet might be less established in Europe than his contemporaries – he only has one stockist in the UK, Dover Street Market – Ino is only just classified as a young designer by the LVMH standards: he is 39 years old (the cut-off is 40); his brand has been going for six years; and he previously worked for seven under Mihara Yasuhiro. His designs combine the staples of Japanese streetwear with the sort of remarkable fabrications only discovered with experience: one souvenir jacket he presented had been decorated with the best holographic tiger I’ve ever seen; the aforementioned slogan Tees expand with the addition of water (“Doublet say hungry?” they read in a crinkled font); a slogan embroidered upon an 80s-style polo wonderfully peeled away into a rainbow fringe. They are funny, too; he describes his work as “fashion with a sense of humour,” which speaks aptly to the placement of an oversized holographic crocodile that riffs on the Japanese fascination with the Lacoste icon, or “your brand name here” emblazoned down the arm of a jumper in allusion to the endurance of logomania. Such meta references will likely become one of this era’s defining trends, and Masayuki speaks to the ever-expanding demand for ironically, self-aware fashion. That being said, “Masuyaki is original,” continued Arnault. “He hasn’t taken his ideas from someone else, or from the past, and his approach is very unique. I’m also very happy that someone from Japan has won the prize for the first time: the competition is totally international, and Japan is such an important country for fashion.” Read more: Everything You Need To Know About The LVMH Prize Finalists

Besides recognising Ino’s innovation, what the decision signified was a conscious choice to expand the Eurocentric confines of these sorts of prizes, alongside a new openness to streetwear as a luxury category (elsewhere, Supreme won a CFDA award this week and Virgil Abloh will show his first collection for Louis Vuitton later this month – it seems the penny has finally dropped). “I really didn’t expect to win,” smiled Ino. “So I don’t know what I will do with the money… but it is an honour to receive the award.”"
Brand Divestitures from Kering Group and LVMH - Christopher Kane and Edun - LUXUO,"Thu, 28 Jun 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmx1eHVvLmNvbS9zdHlsZS9mYXNoaW9uL2JyYW5kLWRpdmVzdGl0dXJlcy1mcm9tLWtlcmluZy1ncm91cC1hbmQtbHZtaC1jaHJpc3RvcGhlci1rYW5lLWFuZC1lZHVuLmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Style / Fashion

Brand Divestitures from Kering and LVMH point to greater competition as the fight for eyes and wallets heats up in the fashion eCommerce arena.

Jun 28, 2018 | By Jonathan Ho

More brand divestitures have been announced by Kering Group and LVMH as competition between the two luxury behemoths heats up. Kering Group is divesting their 51% majority shares of Christoper Kane back to the designer and LVMH is dropping Edun, the socially driven brand founded by Ali Hewson and husband, U2 frontman, Bono.

Brand Divestitures from Kering Group and LVMH – Christopher Kane and Edun

Making his debut in 2006, Christopher Kane shot to popularity for his strong silhouettes and aesthetic textures with strongly feminine elements. By 2013, Kane sold 51% of his brand to Kering Group, setting the young design talent and L’Oreal award winner during his pre-graduate days at Central Saint Martins in London unto a path of global retail and recognition.

Founded in 2004 with an ethical mission in mind, Edun, rode acclaim and accolades for its mission to bring sustainable development in Africa by connecting primary agriculture industry with fashion manufacturing. For years, Hewson and Bono’s Edun worked to connect Northwest Uganda cotton farmers with the associated industry of fashion. By 2009, LVMH acquired a 49% stake in the label.

This week, (June 25th), Kering and LVMH both announced brand divestitures – with Kering in talks to sell its 51% back to its namesake designer; and LVMH, announcing its transfer of its 49% stake back to Hewson and Bono. Privately, Edun employees were aware of the brand’s dissolution since May with its sole Lafayette Street brand boutique in Manhattan, closed, and Edun’s Spring/Summer 2018 collection serving as its last.

Business of Luxury: Brand Divestitures from the conglomerates are a sign of increasing competition and brand focus on eCommerce

Increasingly, Kering has focused on luxury brand Gucci — the group’s undisputed cash cow thanks in part to Alessandro Michele’s exquisite take on streetwear and her ability to ride the hautebeast phenomena as well as the recent success of Balenciaga, a comparatively small brand which has recently captured the cultural and fashion zeitgeist with luxuriously ironic takes of low end bags and their larger than life sneakers. Kering Group recently appointed ex-Céline ready-to-wear director Daniel Lee as the new creative director of Bottega Veneta, replacing Tomas Maier, largely recognised as keeping the brand contemporary and trend-resistant the past 17 years.

In May, LVMH began backing fashion eCommerce giant Lyst. The online fashion giant counting Farfetch and MatchesFashion.com as its direct competitors, with LVMH raising between £50m and £100 million. Before that, LVMH also launched 24 Sevres, its own multi-brand shopping site, with rival luxury group Richemont acquiring rival platform, Yoox Net-A-Porter.

In a statement to UK’s The Guardian by Lyst co-founder and CEO Chris Morton, “Today 60% of our business comes from the US, and we’re planning to expand into Europe and Asia in the next 18 months.”"

From this semi-final, nine finalists were chosen: A-Cold-Wall* by Samuel Ross, BOTTER by Rushemy Botter & Lisi Herrebrugh, Charles Jeffrey Loverboy by Charles Jeffrey, DOUBLET by Masayuki Ino, Eckhaus Latta by Zoe Latta & Mike Eckhaus, KWAIDAN EDITIONS by Léa Dickely & Hung La, Ludovic de Saint Sernin by Ludovic de Saint Sernin, Matthew Adams Dolan by Matthew Adams Dolan and ROKH by Rok Hwang. Today at the Louis Vuitton Foundation, a 12-person jury, joined this year by Clare Waight Keller, creative director at Givenchy and Sidney Toledano, chairman and chief executive of the LVMH fashion group, decided between the finalists. After the presentations, Doublet was revealed as the winner of the LVMH Prize 2018. At the head of the label, Masayuki Ino takes home a €300,000 grant and a specialized LVMH team to help develop her business. Launched in 2012, Doublet is a collaboration between Masayuki Ino, a Japanese designer and graduate from Tokyo Mode Gakuen College of Fashion & Design, and Takashi Murakami (no relation to the artist). The result is a wardrobe that mixes East and West, masculine and feminine, the structured and unstructured, and the avant-garde and pop culture to explore the very fundamentals of clothing so as to better reinvent them. The jury also awarded the Special Prize to ROHK, the label headed by London-based Korean designer Rok Hwang who cut his teeth working for Phoebe Philo at Céline.

Edun, the sustainable fashion brand founded by U2’s Bono and his wife, Ali Hewson, is ceasing operations. Its parent company, LVMH, has decided to divest and is selling the shares back to the founders. Business of Fashion reported the divestment and said that it’s unclear if or when the brand will be revived. However, a statement provided to BoF from Edun seemed hopeful.

“In light of a joint review of the business, Edun is restructuring its operations in preparation for its next chapter and LVMH will transfer its shares back to the founders,” a representative for Edun said in a statement. “The founders remain committed to Edun’s mission for sustainable fashion and thank LVMH for its support and dedication during this journey together.”

Edun was one of the early sustainable fashion brands dedicated to working with African artisans (Brother Vellies and Rosario Dawson’s Studio One Eighty Nine followed in their footsteps). However, they went through many designers and different looks for the brand. It also shifted from a low-market contemporary brand sold at Anthropologie to one with $500 pairs of cotton pants.

The decision follows a spree of divestments by LVMH competitor Kering. Tomas Maier’s eponymous brand ceased operations last week following a decision by Kering. They also spiraled out of Puma, sold back shares to Stella McCartney, and are in talks to leave Christopher Kane in order to focus on the luxurious and trendy trinity of Gucci, Saint Laurent, and Balenciaga."

In this week’s edition, we discuss:

Rimowa to regain the control of its distribution rights in China,

The profiling of WeChat Mini Program users, and

The eighth fully-stocked Victoria's Secret store in Hangzhou.

LVMH-owned luxury luggage label Rimowa is planning to regain the control of its distribution rights in China's first-tier cities, according to a new report by the country's fashion media outlet LadyMax, citing sources who are familiar with the matter.

The report also noted the brand would decrease the number of outlets in major Chinese cities while increasing prices by approximately 20 percent.

After the takeover by luxury conglomerate LVMH in late 2016, Rimowa's new CEO Alexandre Arnault (son of LVMH chairman Bernard Arnault) has spearheaded a rejuvenation of the 120-year-old German brand, making it appealing to millennial consumers. Its collaborations with renowned streetwear labels including Supreme and Off-White have been a hit in China - a country where domestic demand for luxury luggage grew to 62.5 billion in 2017.

As of June 2018, the number of daily active users on WeChat's mini-program has reached 280 million, according to Yecao New Consumption, citing a new report released by mini-program research agency ALD . 53 percent of these users are female and 68 percent of them have a bachelor's degree or above. Over 80 percent of users open a mini-program at least three times a day, and more than half of them spend over 10 minutes on it.

For luxury brands selling to China, mini-programs offer the potential to monetize on WeChat. Since the middle of last year, a slew of brands including Longchamp, Gucci, Michael Kors and Fendi has released mini-programs, testing out the potential of the new sales channel.

The American lingerie brand Victoria's Secret launched a new store in Hangzhou, China on June 26, making it the eighth fully-stocked boutique in the mainland. Shoppers will receive personal shopper services from lingerie experts in the Hangzhou store, following its official opening ceremony.

Though Victoria's Secret is a big-name player in China's lingerie market, they’re facing competition from local brands who have made creative moves to adapt quickly to new millennial consumption codes."

PARIS - 26 June 2018: Young, hip, urban, and male ... meet the fashion world’s new best friend.



Luxury brands are raising their game in menswear, which is expanding at a faster clip than women’s clothing as styles loosen up and streetwear like hoodies find a new audience.



Big fashion houses including French conglomerates LVMH and Kering are among those hiring eye-catching designers and investing in male attire.



LVMH’s Paris-based Louis Vuitton summed up the zeitgeist at the latest run of men’s fashion shows that closed last week with a collection by its new DJ-turned-designer Virgil Abloh.



This mixed casual anoraks, holster-style accessories and sleek trench coats, and drew hip hop royalty.



“It’s more than a buzz. It’s a deeper trend,” Sidney Toledano, head of LVMH’s fashion group, said on the sidelines of a fashion show.



“There’s strong demand across the men’s fashion industry, in all its shapes and forms, and which comes in part from a younger clientele. We see it very clearly in the sales.”



LVMH brands do not detail earnings, though analysts estimate that menswear at top money-spinner Vuitton is 5 to 7 percent of revenue. Vuitton did not respond to a request for comment.



Meanwhile Kering’s fastest-growing brand Balenciaga, a one-time couture house which scored a hit with a line of chunky sneakers, says men are now among its biggest sales drivers along with millennials, or 20 to 35 year olds.



Womenswear still had the biggest share of the broader $1.7 trillion apparel and footwear market in 2017, with menswear less than a quarter, Euromonitor data shows.



Yet the market research firm forecasts men’s lines will outperform women’s between 2017 and 2022, with sales expanding by a compound annual growth rate of 2 percent.



“This is due to men placing a greater emphasis on their appearance, fueled by the rise of social media, and dress codes for men softening globally,” Marguerite Le Rolland, a consultant in beauty and fashion at Euromonitor, said.



WORK TO WEEKEND



Brands are taking note, expanding their reach with Instagram campaigns and famous faces such as ex soccer star David Beckham who is an ambassador for the British Fashion Council.



The growth of casualwear may entail some setbacks, with tailoring - usually items that are more expensive than sportswear - at risk of taking a hit.



Sales of men’s suits fell by $700 million between 2012 and 2017 in western Europe, Euromonitor data showed, contrasting with growth in premium jeans.



LVMH’s Toledano - who oversees LVMH labels like Celine, which is due to launch a men’s line - said tailored styles were still doing well, however, adding that sales growth was spreading to accessories and shoes.



Upstart labels are also keeping big brands on their toes.



“The men’s business has exploded in the last five years,” said Roopal Patel, fashion director of Saks Fifth Avenue, adding that the U.S. department store was bringing in newer menswear-focused labels like France’s Ami, or Off-White, the streetwear brand founded by Vuitton’s Abloh.



“We’ve gone from just category addressing to really designers looking at how they’re going to wardrobe a man’s lifestyle, everything from work to evening to weekend to sport.”"
Standing out in streetwear: Japanese brand Doublet wins LVMH Prize - The National,"Thu, 07 Jun 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZW5hdGlvbmFsbmV3cy5jb20vbGlmZXN0eWxlL2Zhc2hpb24vc3RhbmRpbmctb3V0LWluLXN0cmVldHdlYXItamFwYW5lc2UtYnJhbmQtZG91YmxldC13aW5zLWx2bWgtcHJpemUtMS43Mzc4MTXSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"To describe your approach as “kind of playful” when presenting a clothing collection to a jury that includes the creative forces behind Fendi, Dior, Louis Vuitton and Givenchy, can be a bit of a risk. Fortunately, in Masayuki Iso’s case it paid off.

The designer of Japanese streetwear brand Doublet was named as the winner at the prestigious LVMH Prize ceremony, held in Paris on June 6. The 38-year-old from Tokyo, who is known for his fluid, gender-neutral clothes, took home the grand prize from among 1,300 candidates, nine of whom were shortlisted.

Iso's collection included a T-shirt in a cup, which ""grows"" as you add water; and clear-sleeved baseball jackets and sunset-and-surfer-printed shorts created from PVC. The experimental designs and textile development sat especially well with the panellists, notably Givenchy's Clare Waight Keller, who was a first-time judge. Meanwhile, Louis Vuitton's Nicolas Ghesquière, who's been on the jury for five years, was impressed by the fact that Doublet has ""sportswear, but it doesn't look like sportswear. Showing individuality very quickly is the whole point of the prize,"" said the womenswear designer who recently renewed his contract with LV. Doublet retails on Farfetch.com.

The prize itself entails €300,000 (Dh1.3 million) and a year’s worth of mentoring from the judging committee, which also included Karl Lagerfeld, Maria Grazia Chiuri, Marc Jacobs, Jonathan Anderson, and Kenzo’s Carol Lim and Humbert Leon.

South Korean designer Rok Hwang took home the creative prize for his London-based label Rokh, known for its handbags and pattern-rich apparel.

The LVMH Prize came about in 2013 and is the brainchild of Louis Vuitton’s director and executive vice president Delphine Arnault. The competition runs over five months and has three rounds.

The other brands and creatives that made it to the finals were: A-Cold Wall by Samuel Ross; Botter by Rushemy Botter and Lisi Herrebrugh; Loverboy by Charles Jeffrey; Eckhaus Latta by Mike Eckhaus and Zoe Latte; Kwaidan Editions by Léa Dickely and Hung La; Ludovic de Saint Sernin; and Matthew Adams Dola.

"With $49 Billion in Revenue, Christian Dior SA is the World's Largest Fashion Group - The Fashion Law","Fri, 08 Jun 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWZhc2hpb25sYXcuY29tL3dpdGgtNDktYmlsbGlvbi1pbi1yZXZlbnVlLWNocmlzdGlhbi1kaW9yLWlzLXRoZS13b3JsZHMtbGFyZ2VzdC1mYXNoaW9uLWJyYW5kL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Christian Dior SA is the world’s largest fashion group, according to Forbes’ Global 2000 list. With $49 billion in revenue for 2017, the annual list of “the world’s biggest and most powerful public companies, as measured by a composite score of revenues, profits, assets and market value” puts Christian Dior SA, the company that owns 46 percent of LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton (and that is distinct from the Dior Couture brand which it owns), in the number 150 position, following the likes of financial institutions, big-pharma companies, consumer goods behemoths like P&G and Apple, and Amazon, of course.

While the Forbes list states that it is Christian Dior that brought in $49 billion in revenue for 2017, it is worth noting that “Christian Dior” is being used to denote the Christian Dior SA group, as Dior, the brand, alone, did not sell nearly $50 billion in fragrances, bags, and “We Should All Be Feminists” t-shirts in one year. In fact, in January, LVMH – the parent to Dior Couture, as well as Louis Vuitton, Givenchy, Celine, and Loewe, among nearly 70 other fashion and non-fashion brands – reported record-breaking annual sales of $49 billion for the 2017 fiscal year.

You may recall that Dior made headlines in April 2017 when LVMH chairman Bernard Arnault made a $13 billion bid to bring the long-affiliated but technically separate fashion brand under the umbrella of his luxury goods conglomerate. (To complicate things further, despite Dior Couture being under the LVMH umbrella, Christian Dior SA – which is owned by Groupe Arnault, Bernard Arnault’s family holding company – holds a 46 percent stake in LVMH, making it the entity that appears in the Forbes list).

Arnault, who has expanded LVMH to include dozens of leading luxury brands – from yacht makers and spirits brands to Louis Vuitton, Hermès (Arnault still holds a small stake following the parties’ showdown in 2014), Givenchy, Celine and Loewe – is said to have initiated the deal to “simplify the corporate structure” of Christian Dior Couture and LVMH, including reuniting Christian Dior Couture and Christian Dior Perfumes under one umbrella.

LVMH’s $49 billion revenue figure enabled it to beat out Inditex, the Spanish retail giant behind Zara, for the title of the largest retailer in the apparel, accessories and footwear space. As noted by Forbes, “Shoppers have embraced fast fashion, with its on-trend styles and affordable prices, and sales at Zara climbed 9 percent to 25 billion euros ($29 billion) in 2017,” putting it in second place, followed by Nike, the world’s largest athletic retailer with annual sales of $35 billion.

Meanwhile, further down on the list, LVMH rival Kering, which is parent to Gucci, Balenciaga, Alexander McQueen, and Saint Laurent, among others, landed in the number 349 spot. Discount retailer giant TJX Companies, which occupies the number 445 (of 2000) position, and Richemont – which owns Yoox Net-a-Porter, Chloe, Alaia, and Cartier, is in spot number 487."
Chanel Annual Revenue Report $10 Billion USD 2017 - HYPEBAE,"Fri, 22 Jun 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vaHlwZWJhZS5jb20vMjAxOC82L2NoYW5lbC1sb3Vpcy12dWl0dG9uLWx2bWgtYW5udWFsLXJlc3VsdHMtMjAxNy0yMDE40gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Iconic luxury house Chanel has made headlines for publishing its annual results for the first time ever in its 108-year history. Until now, the brand had kept its finances top-secret, with the public only being able to assume how much revenue it earned from global sales of its clothing, accessories and of course, beauty and fragrance lines.

The numbers showed that Chanel’s sales in 2017 totalled $9.2 billion USD – that’s an 11 percent leap from the previous financial year. This figure meant that the Parisian brand tied with Louis Vuitton – which is also owned by LVMH – and both took the top-spot as the highest-performing luxury brands in the world. In comparison, Gucci, which has seen a rise in both popularity and sales under the helm of Alessandro Michele, reported sales of around $7.2 billion USD. In an interview with Business of Fashion about the decision to publicize the results, Chanel’s chief financial officer, Phillipe Blondiaux stated:

“We realized it was time to put the facts on the table as to exactly who we are: a $10 billion dollar company with very strong financials, plus all the means and ammunition at our disposal to remain independent. We recognize that we are often the subject of much speculation and that people don’t have facts to hand, leading to the circulation of false or misleading information. It was time to let the strength of our balance sheet speak for itself.”

Football’s governing body reports that 3.2 billion television viewers tuned in to follow the matches four years ago (when host country Brazil suffered a crushing 7-1 semi-final defeat against Germany), with one billion people watching the final. Broadcasting rights are a huge part of the crock of gold which the World Cup represents for FIFA, the bulk of whose revenue (around 90%) comes from the four-yearly event. At €4.9 billion in 2014 in Brazil and €4.2 billion in 2010 in South Africa, this is revenue worthy of any major multinational.

As much as Sweden's GDP Not that the World Cup is alone in attracting big money. Vast amounts are at stake in the national leagues too. The transfer in 2017 of Brazilian forward Neymar from FC Barcelona to Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) for an astounding €222 million says it all. And this record could be beaten at the next transfer season, given that Tottenham striker Harry Kane is already “worth” in excess of €200 million. According to a report by Lloyd’s Bank, clubs spent in excess of €4 billion on transfers last year. On top of what they cost to sign, the game’s major players command massive salaries too. Think Lionel Messi (€126 million) Cristiano Ronaldo (€94 million), Neymar (€81.5 million), Gareth Bale (€44 million) or Gérard Piqué (€29 million). Not forgetting the enormous budgets of the big clubs. Paris Saint-Germain, which belongs to Qatar’s sovereign wealth fund, pulled in €486 million in revenues last year. This puts it hot on the boots of richest club Manchester United (€676 million), followed by Real Madrid (€674 million), Barcelona (€648 million) and Bayern Munich (€587 million).

Granted, not all clubs have millions to play with but considering the sport’s ever-increasing popularity (China’s President Xi Jinping has made the development of football a national priority), Christian Karembeu’s declaration to Swiss news magazine Bilan that it is “the world’s third largest economy” isn’t as far-fetched as it may seem. Globally, football is a €400 billion industry – comparable to the GDP of a country such as Sweden, Belgium or Venezuela. It has its stars, with their millions of online followers, and its scandals, including corruption, match-rigging and players behaving badly. It’s a sport floating on money with its army of sponsors, including watchmakers. Or should that be “watchmaker” in the singular? In the world of football, only one group counts and that’s LVMH, with star players Hublot and TAG Heuer, and Jean-Claude Biver coaching from the sidelines.

""We have everything covered"" The Chief Executive of TAG Heuer and President of LVMH’s Watch Division gave a neat summing-up of the situation in an interview to French magazine Paris Match, following a sponsorship deal with the French league: “Football spans every generation, every social class. It’s a fabulous medium for the values we share with this sport: passion, team spirit, emotion and determination.” In another interview, this time to WorldTempus, he even declared that, between them, TAG Heuer and Hublot had the game covered. Without going into a blow-by-blow account of an adventure that began in 2004 between Hublot and the Swiss team, with TAG Heuer getting in on the action since, the two brands are indeed everywhere: alongside stars old (Pelé and Maradona) and new (Mats Hummels and Shinji Kagawa), side by side with some of the greatest coaches (José Mourinho and Marcello Lippi) or hanging out with Manchester United and Benfica. The two brands have also inked partnership deals with the major professional leagues, including in England, France, Germany and China, and snapped up the all-important job of official timekeeper for FIFA and for its European counterpart UEFA.

Since its first footballing venture 12 years ago, Hublot's sales have gone from CHF 30 million to around CHF 500 million."

At last week’s Louis Vuitton menswear show in Paris, newly hired designer Virgil Abloh sent hoodie-clad models down the runway toting duffel bags made from gleaming high-tech plastic, all to the latest Kanye West album. West, who embraced the tearful designer as he took his bows, was joined by his wife, Instagram super-influencer Kim Kardashian. Seated steps away: Bernard Arnault, head of parent company LVMH , and four of his adult children.The duffels, embossed with the LV logo, were a far cry from the monogrammed brown bags that helped LVMH define and dominate the global luxury industry. They’re just one of the many ways the company is remaking itself as the next generation of Arnaults carves out a greater role. Of Bernard’s five children from two marriages, all but the youngest one hold senior positions at LVMH.Over the past year, the multipronged group has shaken up its ranks of managers and designers, rolled out new e-commerce platforms and launched a makeup line with the singer Rihanna. It’s become a patron of the French technology scene, subsidizing workspace at a startup incubator and handing out awards to young entrepreneurs. Such moves contrast with LVMH’s long-time modus operandi of acquiring iconic European brands and enhancing their exclusivity.“Luxury companies are required to engage the consumer in ways they never did before,” said Mario Ortelli, who runs a London-based advisory firm on luxury strategy. “It’s become more of a collaboration” as the response on social media can either boost or sink new collections. The younger Arnaults, Ortelli said, “can look at this market with the eyes of someone who is closer to it” than their 69-year-old father.Abloh’s hiring illustrates the transformation. A Ghanaian-American streetwear designer, he was a creative consultant to West when he was spotted by Delphine Arnault , 43, Vuitton’s executive vice president, and Alexandre Arnault, 26, head of the Rimowa luggage business. Abloh, who studied architecture rather than fashion, has a following of 2.6 million fans on Instagram, many of them willing to pay as much $2,500 for a pair of sneakers from his collaboration with Nike.“What’s exciting about him is his approach, and the fact that he’s so open to the world,” Alexandre Arnault said before the show, standing on the rainbow-painted runway. In a nod to LVMH’s success with classic fashion, he added: “It’s about redefining the codes of luxury, making it more accessible for young people. The products will stay exclusive even if the approach is inclusive.”Bernard Arnault doesn’t plan to retire for at least a decade, according to people familiar with his thinking, and there’s no clear front-runner to replace him. But as his children expand their influence, and as the serial deal-maker runs out of companies to buy, LVMH is reshaping the brands it already owns. It’s all with an eye to making them increasingly relevant to a generation of consumers more excited by Instagram posts and sneaker drops than by the editorial pages of Vogue. Arnault, the chief executive officer, declined to be interviewed.The luxury business “is not about It bags anymore,” said Federica Levato, a partner at Bain & Co. in Milan. “Streetwear, T-shirts, puffy jackets, are becoming an important part of the core collection.” In marketing to these customers, luxury houses have to focus not only on products but also on “communication, visuals, social media, all the touchpoints.’’The company, 47 percent owned by the Arnault family, posted 43 billion euros ($50 billion) in sales last year, nearly three times the figure of its nearest competitor, Kering. Its portfolio of 70 brands, from Vuitton and Dior to Moet & Chandon Champagne and Tag Heuer watches, turned in robust 13 percent sales growth during the first quarter. Bernard Arnault is the world’s sixth-richest person with a fortune of $73 billion.While LVMH doesn’t break out sales for individual brands, Louis Vuitton is the world’s largest and most profitable luxury brand, with sales of nearly $11 billion and an operating margin of 45 percent last year, according to HSBC. Shares of the parent company are up about 16 percent this year.“Bernard Arnault has a sixth sense about what’s next” in luxury trends, said Ron Frasch, a former president of Saks Fifth Avenue who now works in private equity at Castanea Partners in New York.Still, there are worrisome signs. Gucci, owned by Kering, is outpacing LVMH in the race for younger customers -- an urgent concern, as 85 percent of growth in the luxury sector now comes from shoppers under age 38, according to Bain. Designer Alessandro Michele has rebooted Gucci with collections that pile on crystals, embroidered flowers, dragons, and cartoon cats. Gucci, which says 55 percent of its sales are to millennial shoppers, reported revenue up 49 percent in the first quarter of this year. That compares with 16 percent at LVMH’s fashion and leather goods division, dominated by Vuitton.LVMH can no longer count on acquisitions to supercharge growth. Starting in the late 1980s, Arnault snapped up dozens of mostly family-owned companies -- fashion houses, watchmakers, champagne growers, and more -— scaling them up and finding new markets for their products in the developing world, especially in China.Nowadays, there are few opportunities for game-changing deals. The family owners of Hermes, the high-end handbag maker, rebuffed Arnault’s efforts to build a stake in the company. The owners of privately held Chanel show no interest in selling, either. Arnault’s last big acquisition, in 2017, was essentially a bookkeeping exercise: He spent about 12 billion euros to buy out minority shareholders in Christian Dior, which he already controlled, and fold it into LVMH.Arnault and his team used to be known as “killers’’ who stalked the luxury sector for potential acquisitions, said Gachoucha Kretz, a marketing professor at French business school HEC. Now, “they are taking another path.”That path includes new management and design talent. LVMH recently replaced the longtime head of Christian Dior with Pietro Beccari, former head of the Fendi unit. Beccari won acclaim there for his e-commerce savvy and for whimsical spectacles that raised awareness of the fur-and-handbags brand. One example: a show in which model and reality-TV star Kendall Jenner appeared to walk on water as she traversed a plexiglass runway over Rome’s Trevi Fountain.And the family has hired Hedi Slimane, the star designer who set the menswear agenda for more than a decade when he brought back skinny jeans and suits at Dior Homme in the early-to-mid-2000s. Slimane is set to show his first collection at Celine in September.Abloh, whose appointment was announced in March, caught Delphine Arnault’s attention in 2015 when she made him a finalist in an annual competition to spot promising young designers. Delphine has become LVMH’s chief scout when it comes to design talent. She’s also inherited for father’s penchant for quality control, popping in unannounced at some of LVMH’s more than 4,000 stores around the world to make sure they’re up to snuff.Abloh is “a completely different generation,” said Takashi Murakami, who worked with Vuitton on a series of multi-colored handbags in the early 2000s during the brand’s first conversion from stuffy trunkmaker to veritable fashion brand under Marc Jacobs. “When I was collaborating the first time with Marc Jacobs, at this moment the high fashion was the high fashion—-with very few black people. This time it’s really with the hip-hop movement.”CEO Arnault has fast-tracked the careers of two younger sons from his second marriage. Alexandre helped seal the acquisition of Rimowa in 2016 and now runs the German luggage maker. Frederic, 23, became head of “connected technologies” at Tag Heuer last year after graduating from the elite Ecole Polytechnique, his father’s alma mater. The youngest, Jean, is still in school.Alexandre Arnault has pushed LVMH to step up its digital efforts and helped persuade his father to bring aboard Ian Rogers, a former Apple executive, as the company’s chief digital officer in 2015. “Alexandre has been a big part of raising the importance of digital,” Rogers said. “He’s part of start-up culture.” Alexandre also backed Abloh’s bid for a top job at LVMH, collaborating with the designer on a collection of transparent suitcases that Rimowa sold for nearly $1,000. And it was Alexandre who accompanied his father on a New York trip to meet with President-elect Donald Trump at Trump Tower in early January 2017.LVMH’s track record on e-commerce is mixed. Although some businesses, such as Vuitton and Sephora, have successful online boutiques, other efforts have stumbled. ELuxury, an online designer site, shut down in 2009 after failing to gain traction. Last year LVMH launched an online boutique and mobile app called 24 Sevres, inspired by the group’s Left Bank department store Le Bon Marche. It has struggled to catch up with online luxury leaders such as like Net-a-Porter and Matchesfashion.com.As the younger Arnaults make their mark on LVMH, it’s likely the company will become more open and transparent-- a change that CEO Arnault acknowledged in a company memo naming his 41-year-old son, Antoine, as communications director in early June. “LVMH’s success attracts growing attention from the media, observers, public authorities, as well as the general public,” he wrote. Such openness could give LVMH greater name recognition outside France. Many of its customers have no idea that businesses ranging from Glenmorangie whisky to the Sephora cosmetics chain are owned by the group.The senior Arnault still dictates strategy. At headquarters on Paris’s swank Avenue Montaigne, “to discuss anything important you have to go to the seventh floor,” where the CEO’s office is located, said Ashok Som, who teaches luxury management France’s Essec business school. And why shouldn’t he call the shots? Said Som: “He started this whole industry.”"
LVMH Korea ordered to recall dangerous Dior Nail Glow product - GlobalCosmeticsNews,"Thu, 07 Jun 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmdsb2JhbGNvc21ldGljc25ld3MuY29tL2x2bWgta29yZWEtb3JkZXJlZC10by1yZWNhbGwtZGFuZ2Vyb3VzLWRpb3ItbmFpbC1nbG93LXByb2R1Y3Qv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The Korean affiliate of beauty company LVMH has been ordered to recall its Dior Nail Glow product due to the inclusion of hazardous ingredients within the formula.

According to the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety, the company is to cease all sales of the product and to recall those already on the market due to the items thought to include the harmful ingredient fluorescent brightener 367.

The items were imported from the French manufacturer Parfums Christian Dior and sold via the local affiliate.

While the brightener is often used to create a lightening effect due to the chemical compound absorbing light in the ultraviolet and violet region of the electromagnetic spectrum, Korean authorities have become concerned over allergic reactions when in contact with the skin and have since recommended that companies do not include the ingredient in cosmetic products.

According a Ministry of Food and Drug Safety official, “Although the United States and Europe have yet to prohibit manufacturers from adding fluorescent brightener to cosmetics, Korea has banned cosmetics manufacturers from using it, as a preemptive measure.”"
LVMH's Antoine Arnault Takes Up Group Image as Heirs Flex Muscle - BNN Bloomberg,"Mon, 04 Jun 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJubmJsb29tYmVyZy5jYS9sdm1oLXMtYW50b2luZS1hcm5hdWx0LXRha2VzLXVwLWdyb3VwLWltYWdlLWFzLWhlaXJzLWZsZXgtbXVzY2xlLTEuMTA4Njk0ONIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"(Bloomberg) -- By putting his son Antoine in charge of image and communication, Bernard Arnault is sending a powerful message: LVMH, the world’s largest luxury goods maker, needs to make room in its executive ranks for the owner’s family.

Arnault sent a memo to employees on June 1 announcing Antoine’s new responsibilities, a copy of which was seen by Bloomberg News. In it, he stresses the importance of the role, saying his son will be in charge of managing the “growing attention’’ in the company from the media and public, and pointing to social media as an area of particular focus. Communications had previously been the mandate of Nicolas Bazire, a longtime Arnault deputy working on business development and acquisitions.

Arnault became France’s richest man by buying up European heritage brands, often from their founding families, and scaling them up with his team of trusted deputies -- as well as revamping their image with the help of star designers like John Galliano and Marc Jacobs.

When it comes to the future of LVMH, Arnault has made it clear that family comes first: Antoine, who turns 41 Monday, was already CEO of shoes-and-custom suiting brand Berluti and chairman of Italian fine wool specialist Loro Piana, roles he will continue to perform. His sister Delphine, 43, is executive vice president at Louis Vuitton.

Alexandre, Frederic

In late 2016, Arnault’s son Alexandre was named co-CEO of German luggage maker Rimowa at the age of 24, and he’s since become an outspoken champion of improving LMVH’s digital marketing and e-commerce efforts. Younger brother Frederic, 23, became head of “connected technologies” for watchmaker Tag Heuer last year upon graduating from the elite Ecole Polytechnique -- Arnault’s alma mater.

In a deal announced last April, Arnault paid about $13 billion to buy out minority shareholders in his Christian Dior holding company, raising the family’s controlling stake in LVMH to as much as 46 percent. Any movements at the group are closely watched for clues of who will eventually take over from Arnault, who is 69 and both chairman and CEO. LVMH declined to comment on the memo.

Most Valuable

While the group’s stable of 70 high-end brands and retailers are among the world’s most visible -- they include Louis Vuitton fashion, Sephora cosmetics and Moet et Chandon champagne -- parent company LVMH itself has managed to stay in the shadows, and many consumers outside of France have never heard of it. In the social media age, and a year after LVMH surpassed Total SA to become France’s most valuable company by market cap, Arnault sees that changing.

“[LVMH’s] success attracts growing attention from the media, observers, public authorities, as well as the general public,” he wrote in the memo. “To address this increased exposure and further enhance the evaluation of the Group’s achievements, I have decided to strengthen the organization of our communication.”

Over the past year, Antoine has become increasingly visible at the group level by leading discussions that led to a pact with luxury rival Kering to crack down on the use of ultra-thin and underage models, as well as signing on to represent LVMH on a public-private task force on women’s professional equality organized by the French government.

""We need to be more transparent. We can’t do everything in secret anymore,"" Antoine Arnault said at a conference in Brussels last fall, adding that the desire for a more open company was shared among the younger generation at LVMH.

“Mala Bavo, a small bistro on Rue Saint-Denis in Paris, just a few steps away from our studio. We really like its no-nonsense Kurdish-style food – simple, good and not expensive. It’s perfect for quick dinners after work or meetings with a plate of mezes in between.”

VINTAGE HAUNTS

“Most of my favourite vintage pieces are either from the French countryside or Belgium. Clignancourt (a flea market in Paris) and Montreuil (a commune in the suburbs of Paris) are always good options. Of course, there’s always Emmaus (an NGO that organises flea markets among other things).”

CULTURAL RECOMMENDATION



“Just sneak into one of Paris’ few remaining independent movie theatres (such as the 83-year-old Le Balzac cinema, which still shows celluloid films).”

R&R TREAT

“Whenever my boyfriend puts on the records of (early New Wave band) Devo or rockabilly pioneer Gene Vincent.”

Bedside Read



“I’ve had almost no time to read with all that’s been happening over the last year. The last book I read from cover to cover was In Praise of Love by Alain Badiou (in which the French philosopher posits a refreshing take on the true meaning of love). Recommended for everybody.”

SPRING/SUMMER 2018 MUST-HAVES

“In my collection, I’m most proud of the dresses made from repurposed scarves. Repurposing is not new, but we’ve been able to do so (Serre has a team that specialises in sourcing from around the world fabrics and garments that can be upcycled) to create pieces that actually make it into stores. We were quite sure that the critics would like this, but unsure of how retailers would react. It’s worked out very well so far though and I’m extremely proud of this.”

PARIS (Reuters) – Young, hip, urban, and male … meet the fashion world’s new best friend.

Luxury brands are raising their game in menswear, which is expanding at a faster clip than women’s clothing as styles loosen up and streetwear like hoodies find a new audience.

Big fashion houses including French conglomerates LVMH and Kering are among those hiring eye-catching designers and investing in male attire.

LVMH’s Paris-based Louis Vuitton summed up the zeitgeist at the latest run of men’s fashion shows that closed last week with a collection by its new DJ-turned-designer Virgil Abloh.

This mixed casual anoraks, holster-style accessories and sleek trench coats, and drew hip hop royalty.

“It’s more than a buzz. It’s a deeper trend,” Sidney Toledano, head of LVMH’s fashion group, said on the sidelines of a fashion show.

“There’s strong demand across the men’s fashion industry, in all its shapes and forms, and which comes in part from a younger clientele. We see it very clearly in the sales.”

LVMH brands do not detail earnings, though analysts estimate that menswear at top money-spinner Vuitton is 5 to 7 percent of revenue. Vuitton did not respond to a request for comment.

Meanwhile Kering’s fastest-growing brand Balenciaga, a one-time couture house which scored a hit with a line of chunky sneakers, says men are now among its biggest sales drivers along with millennials, or 20 to 35 year olds.

Womenswear still had the biggest share of the broader $1.7 trillion apparel and footwear market in 2017, with menswear less than a quarter, Euromonitor data shows.

Yet the market research firm forecasts men’s lines will outperform women’s between 2017 and 2022, with sales expanding by a compound annual growth rate of 2 percent."
