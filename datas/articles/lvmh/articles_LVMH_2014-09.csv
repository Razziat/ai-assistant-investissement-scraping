Mr. Arnault, France’s richest man, ultimately built his stake to nearly one-quarter of Hermès’s shares. And in so doing, he set off an acrimonious public battle in which the family that controls Hermès tried to force him to sell his shares.

On Wednesday, both sides claimed victory.

Mr. Arnault and Axel Dumas, the Hermès chief executive and a descendant of the founder, said in a joint statement that they had accepted a plan proposed by a Paris commercial court “to bring to an end the conflicts between the two groups and restore a climate of positive relations between them.”

Under the deal, LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, the luxury giant controlled by Mr. Arnault, will spin off its entire Hermès stake to LVMH shareholders. That ends the threat that the French mogul could walk away with the venerable company, although it leaves Mr. Arnault with a residual stake of 8.5 percent. The terms restrict his ability to buy additional Hermès shares for at least five years."
LVMH and Hermès settle long-running dispute over ownership stake - The Guardian,"Wed, 03 Sep 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy8yMDE0L3NlcC8wMy9mcmVuY2gtYnJhbmRzLWx2bWgtaGVybWVzLXNldHRsZS1sb25nLXJ1bm5pbmctZGlzcHV0ZS1vd25lcnNoaXAtc3Rha2XSAXZodHRwczovL2FtcC50aGVndWFyZGlhbi5jb20vYnVzaW5lc3MvMjAxNC9zZXAvMDMvZnJlbmNoLWJyYW5kcy1sdm1oLWhlcm1lcy1zZXR0bGUtbG9uZy1ydW5uaW5nLWRpc3B1dGUtb3duZXJzaGlwLXN0YWtl?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LVMH and Hermès, the French luxury goods makers, have settled their long-running dispute, known as the ""handbag war"", over LVMH's unwelcome stake in its rival.

LVMH, whose upmarket empire includes Louis Vuitton, Moët champagne, Hennessy cognac and fashion labels Christian Dior and Marc Jacobs, revealed it had a 17% stake in Hermès in October 2010. It did so by stealth, using equity derivatives to build the stake over three years instead of buying shares in the open market, causing fury at Hermès.

Bernard Arnault, LVMH's boss, tried to persuade Hermès' controlling families to sell up while increasing the stake to 23.2% but without success.

Under the deal, arrived at in a French court, LVMH agreed to relinquish most of its Hermès stake and not to buy any shares in its bitter rival for the next five years. The shares will be distributed to LVMH's shareholders. Hermès chairman, Axel Dumas, and Arnault ""both express their satisfaction that relations between the two groups, representatives of France's savoir-faire, have now been restored"", LVMH said in a statement.

Hermès, known for its silk scarves and Birkin handbags which can cost up to £100,000, dismissed Arnault as a brash US-style operator who would ruin the 177-year-old company.

While holding the stake, Arnault mostly insisted that LVMH was happy as a minority investor, but in 2011 said he hoped his takeover of Bulgari after 10 years of trying would demonstrate to other families the benefits of joining LVMH.

The descendants of Hermès' founder Emile Hermès pooled their stakes, representing more than 50% of the shares, in a holding company to ward off a takeover and called on Arnault to reduce LVMH's stake to under 10%.

Arnault's acceptance of the deal is the first time he has been defeated in pursuit of a brand during two decades of acquisitions."

French luxury products group LVMH and Internet search engine Google have agreed to work together to fight the sale of counterfeit goods online, the two firms said on Thursday.

The agreement ends nearly 10 years of litigation over complaints by LVMH—owner of top luxury labels in everything from champagne to luggage—that the Google Adwords key words service helped counterfeiters sell their products on the back of LVMH brands.

LVMH is a leading group in the growing, global market for luxury products, but faces the mounting problem of copycat products sold at huge discounts.

The companies said in a joint statement that they would work together ""to develop new ways of engaging consumers online whilst preserving the value of trusted brands and enhancing creativity...""

They said they would use their considerable resources ""to tackle the advertising and sale of counterfeit goods online"".

For Google, the head of the business in southern and eastern Europe, Carlo D'Asaro Biondo, said: ""We are very happy to reach this agreement with LVMH and to work together to tackle the advertising of counterfeit goods online and preserve the value of trusted brands.""

LVMH vice president Pierre Gode said the deal meant that ""brands will be protected both online and offline"".

Google was found guilty in a French court in 2005 of counterfeit activities, unfair competition and providing misleading advertising.

The Internet giant lost an appeal the following year and a superior court then referred the matter to the EU European Court.

In 2010, the European Court of Justice gave a judgement in favour of Google, holding that the search engine did not itself undermine protected brands and trademarks when it allowed them to be used as keywords to trigger the presentation on screen of advertisements.

However, Google could be held responsible once it realised that an advertiser was involved in illicit activities, and if it did not act immediately to withdraw or block the advertiser's content, the court ruled.

The case was then sent to the Court of Appeal in Paris, but has now been settled by the agreement announced on Thursday.

Frank Gehry's Masterful Fondation Louis Vuitton Opens in Paris - Architectural Digest,"Tue, 30 Sep 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFyY2hpdGVjdHVyYWxkaWdlc3QuY29tL3N0b3J5L2ZyYW5rLWdlaHJ5LWZvbmRhdGlvbi1sb3Vpcy12dWl0dG9uLWFydHMtY2VudGVyLWFydGljbGXSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"View Slideshow

For generations, the Jardin d’Acclimatation in Paris’s Bois de Boulogne park has captured imaginations with amusements both nostalgic and novel. Opened in 1860 by Napoléon III and Empress Eugénie, the Jardin, a zoological garden, has, at various points in its history, beckoned visitors with a house of mirrors, an enchanted river ride, a puppet theater, games of every description, and, of course, a merry menagerie. This fall it welcomes its most audacious and fantastical attraction yet: the Fondation Louis Vuitton. A dazzling center for contemporary art and culture, the project is the brainchild of Bernard Arnault, chairman and CEO of the French luxury-goods conglomerate LVMH Moët Hennessy–Louis Vuitton, and was brought to life by that most lyrical of architectural conjurers, Frank Gehry.

With its shiplike exterior of billowing glass sails, the 126,000-square-foot, 2.5-story building suggests an avant-garde update of the Jolly Roger, gracefully piloted by Peter Pan through the Bois’s verdant sea of centuries-old trees with a trail of pixie dust in its wake. Bewitching and majestic, the structure alights in the park with the delicacy of the Winged Victory perched at the head of the Daru staircase in the Louvre. Suffice it to say, it’s the kind of place that invites ecstatic odes and mixed metaphors.

The Fondation’s story began in 2001, when Arnault first met Gehry and proposed creating an institution that would house LVMH’s burgeoning art collection and provide a platform for diverse cultural programs. What was required was a truly visionary building, one that would reflect LVMH’s rich engagement with the arts across a variety of creative fields. Gehry recalls his first trip to the Jardin d’Acclimatation with Arnault as a watershed moment. ""I thought of all the extraordinary people who must have played in the garden as children—first and foremost, Marcel Proust,"" the architect says. ""Tears came to my eyes.""

Conceptual designs began in 2004, and Gehry presented the first models to an enthusiastic Arnault later that year. ""I knew Frank Gehry was perfectly suited to create a buil-ding that would stand for our artistic commitment and would stir the emotions,"" says Arnault, who, reached by e-mail, cited his admiration for the architect’s twin triumphs: the Guggenheim Museum Bilbao and the Walt Disney Concert Hall in Los Angeles.

For this project Gehry found inspiration in soaring glass-and-steel structures of the 19th century, including the Jardin’s own Palmarium, a lavish showcase for exotic trees, plants, and birds that was built on the site in 1893 and demolished in 1934. The center’s design features a number of the hallmarks—voluptuous swirls, dynamic asymmetries, an irrepressible optimism—that characterize Gehry’s earlier groundbreaking works. Only here, glass replaced metal as the defining material. ""The idea of using glass was a positive force in gaining support from the mayor of Paris,"" he says. ""And it was essential in making the Fondation a true Bois de Boulogne building, in the spirit of a children’s park.""

Of course, museums don’t hang paintings on glass walls, so the architect and his team essentially conceived a building within a building. The Fondation’s distinctive shell, which Gehry refers to as the Verrière, consists of a dozen of the monumental glass sail forms, all variously angled and overlapping. Underneath sits an assemblage of irregular volumes, known as the Iceberg, containing 11 galleries for art. The Iceberg is clad in luminous white panels of fiber-reinforced concrete, while the Verrière is held aloft by a network of steel trusses and wood beams in a bravura feat of architectural acrobatics. To observe city-mandated height restrictions, the architects excavated the site and erected the structure below grade, set within a reflecting pool that underscores its nautical air and suffuses the edifice with shimmering light. A terraced waterfall at one end adds a kinetic element."

Arnault has maintained LVMH’s investment was peaceful and that it had no intention of assuming control.

The move rallied descendants of founder Emile Hermes to pool their shares in a holding company to protect against a full takeover and sparked legal action as well as demands that Arnault reduce the shareholding. The distribution of the stake, due to be completed by Dec. 20, will leave the billionaire’s family holding company Groupe Arnault with an 8.5 percent interest, Paris-based LVMH said. According to sources, the resolution will boost the proportion of Hermes shares that are freely traded to more than 20 percent from about 7 percent and reduces “the speculative appeal of Hermes which goes back to being a normally traded company.”

Christian Dior, LVMH’s largest shareholder, will give the stock to its own investors. LVMH, Groupe Arnault and Dior have agreed to buy no more shares in Hermes for the next five years."

A ceasefire has been called on the biggest row in luxury, ending the dispute over French giant LVMH’s 23.2 per cent stake in Hermès.

French rival Hermès, known for its expensive handbags and silk scarves, and LVMH, run by France’s richest man Bernard Arnault, have settled a four year dispute - involving lawsuits and personal attacks - after LVMH had secretly built up the stake in the family-run maker of Birkin handbags.

Now, after conciliation talks brokered by the Commercial Court of Paris, Arnault has agreed to distribute the stake to shareholders in LVMH, Christian Dior and the Arnault family investment firm Groupe Arnault.

The deal, to take place in December, will leave Groupe Arnault controlling only 8.5 per cent of Hermès shares – dashing Arnault’s plan to take it over, for now.

With hopes of a takeover gone – and Arnault’s side promising to not buy any more shares in Hermès for the next five years - Hermès shares tumbled 6 per cent.

Arnault, known as the wolf in the cashmere coat for his shrewd business dealings, will have helped LVMH investors make a profit of around €3 billion from the deal.

The windfall helped LVMH shares jump 3 per cent.

Arnault and his family investment arm Groupe Arnault will be one of the main beneficiaries of the share distribution – likely to be through a special dividend. Through his complex share ownerships he controls around a third of LVMH. Groupe Arnault controls 70.5 per cent of Christian Dior which in turn controls 41 per cent of LVMH.

The deal will also mean the liquidity of Hermès will improve by the end of the year.

Analysts said that although the agreement is a blow to any near-term takeover, the move by Arnault shows he is a pragmatic businessman as a long running court case would have been bad for his image. LVMH was already fined €8 million by France's markets watchdog AMF last year for the secret stake-building.

The LVMH shareholding was a shock to the Hermès family when it was revealed in 2010 and then-chief executive Patrick Thomas criticised Arnault’s tactics and said: “If you want to seduce a beautiful woman, you don't start by raping her from behind.”

A statement today, issued by LVMH, said Hermès chief executive Axel Dumas, who last year took over from Thomas, and Arnault both expressed their “satisfaction that relations between the two groups, representatives of France’s savoir-faire, have now been restored.”"

The agreement ends for five years at least any ambition by LVMH, with vast interests from champagne to luggage, to embrace Hermes, known for silk scarves and high-fashion handbags. LVMH, a leader in the global luxury business, had built up a holding of slightly more than 23.0 percent in smaller rival Hermes, opening hostilities by first acquiring 14.2 percent discreetly in 2010 by means of complex financial instruments. This holding is now worth about 6.8 billion euros ($8.9 billion). The Hermes family, shocked at this initial incursion into their share capital, closed ranks and grouped most of their shares in a holding company. This had the effect of ring-fencing control in the boardroom and closing the door to any takeover by LVMH. Litigation followed, largely over the legal and financial techniques used by either side, to gain the upper hand. Under the deal announced by LVMH on Wednesday, and brokered by the president of the Paris commercial court, LVMH is to distribute all of its shares in Hermes among its own shareholders, and undertakes not to buy any Hermes shares for five years. The immediate effect of this end to prospects of a bidding war for Hermes, pushed down Hermes shares by 9.38 percent to 238.10 euros. Sources close to the matter said that the agreement would generate a capital gain of about 2.8 billion euros for LVMH, and LVMH shares rose by 2.10 percent to 135.85 euros. Since LVMH revealed in October 2010 that it had secretly built up a holding, shares in Hermes had risen by 64 percent to 262.75 euros late on Tuesday. LVMH would therefore have made a profit from the Hermes shares given the sharp rise in the stocks' value. The agreement was structured so as to limit the damage to Hermes shares, since an outright sale of the holding could have hit the price far harder. LVMH was founded by French business tycoon Bernard Arnault, and his own holding company Groupe Arnault, as a shareholder in LVMH and in another Hermes shareholder Dior, will end up with 8.5 percent of Hermes once the shares have been distributed, an operation to be completed by December 20. At brokers Barclays Bourse in Paris, director Franklin Pichard said: ""The speculative premium for Hermes shares has disappeared, hence the plunge in the price this morning. However, investors welcome the distribution to come for shareholders in LVMH and Dior."""

What could bring a chief executive to compare an attempted takeover to rape?

Hermès’s then-chief executive, Patrick Thomas, did just that back in 2010 when it emerged rival French luxury group LVMH had secretly built a stake in the handbag and silk scarf maker.

Mr Thomas was so angry he declared: “If you want to seduce a beautiful woman, you don’t start by raping her from behind.”

The man behind Louis Vuitton and Moët & Chandon owner LVMH is France’s richest man, Bernard Arnault.

He is known as the “wolf in the cashmere coat” for his shrewd business dealings and when it came to light that through contracts for difference and other complex share dealings, that his business had amassed a huge stake in Hermès, Paris was shocked.

Yesterday the luxury-goods groups finally agreed a truce.

After conciliation talks, brokered by the Commercial Court of Paris, the 23.2 per cent stake in Hermès will be distributed to shareholders in LVMH, Christian Dior and the Arnault family investment firm, Groupe Arnault. Mr Arnault also agreed not to buy any shares in Hermès for the next five years.

The deal dashes his plan to take Hermès over, for now, and puts an end to a saga that has rumbled on for nearly four years – as well as enriching Mr Arnault who is a significant shareholder of the beneficiary companies.

When news of the secret stakebuilding first broke in October 2010, Mr Thomas was reported to have heard about LVMH buying a 17 per cent stake when he was on a cycling holiday in rural France. LVMH continued to enter into other deals and eventually acquired 23.2 per cent.

It has been reported that the reason Mr Arnault was able to amass his stake was due to a sell off by one of the Hermès family – Nicolas Puech, although he denies this.

A war of words followed and an investigation ensued. Commentators said Mr Arnault’s deal was clearly the start of an attempted takeover and if other family members could eventually be persuaded to sell he could make his move..

But Hermès’s 52 key family shareholders were not going out without a fight. They created a new ownership structure to stop any future hostile takeover. The 177-year old company has a myriad of family members who are all related to the founder, Thierry Hermès. The new structure gave the families – the Dumases, the Puechs and the Guerrands – control of 50.2 per cent of the shares and voting rights.

When current chief executive Axel Dumas took over from Mr Thomas he continued to swap fighting talk with Mr Arnault, and was quoted as saying the fight would be “the battle of our generation”.

It wasn’t just the Hermès family that was cross. The manner in which LVMH quietly bought the shares also came under the scrutiny of France’s markets watchdog, AMF, and last year it fined the group €8m (£6.3m) for its behaviour.

All the while Mr Arnault continued to say the stake building was merely a straight-forward financial investment and not a secret takeover plan. Now that the shares are being distributed and shareholders are in line for a €3bn capital gain his argument is plausible.

Mr Arnault also realised that to continue owning the controversial stake would be bad publicity for his group. He has already recently courted controversy when he applied for Belgian citizenship in 2012. There was an outcry as people assumed it was for tax reasons and last year he withdrew his application.

The decision to back down on Hermès shows Mr Arnault is a pragmatic businessman.

This isn’t the first time he has known when to call it quits – and made a killing in the process.

Mr Arnault went head to head with France’s other luxury-goods family in the 1990s over a battle for Gucci.

Mr Arnault’s LVMH tried to buy the Italian brand but François Pinault’s PPR (now called Kering) took a stake to prevent a takeover. In 2001, after a three year bitter battle, Mr Pinault eventually won. But Mr Arnault profited around €760m from the bidding war.

He has always spotted ways to take advantage of weaknesses in a company. After beginning his business career in the 1970s at his father’s construction company, and turning it into a property developer, he bought a struggling textile company. The story of how he asset-stripped it to leave him with the star designer brand Christian Dior and department store Le Bon Marché is the stuff of legend in France. In the late 1980s, he exploited a feud between the bosses at Louis Vuitton and Moët & Chandon to build a stake in LVMH and eventually took control. He then set to work creating the sprawling mass of luxury-goods brands and drinks labels that it is today – from New York clothing label Donna Karan to Italy’s jeweller Bulgari.

He is usually happy to play the long game to get what he wants. The recent acquisition of Italian cashmere brand Loro Piana apparently came after years of negotiations.

Those who know Mr Arnault well, say that at the age of 65 he is planning for the next generation to eventually take over his empire. His daughter Delphine Arnault, is second in command at Louis Vuitton, while son Antoine Arnault has board positions at brands Berluti and Loro Piana.

He also has three younger sons – Alexandre, Frédéric and Jean – with his second wife, who may also one day play a part in his sprawling empire.

Yesterday LVMH issued a statement to say that Mr Dumas and Mr Arnault expressed their “satisfaction that relations between the two groups, representatives of France’s savoir-faire, have now been restored”.

But Mr Arnault’s family investment vehicle, Groupe Arnault, retains 8.5 per cent in Hermès.

Perhaps one of Mr Arnault’s wolf cubs may one day decide to disregard all this savoir-faire and instead end yesterday’s entente cordiale."
LVMH agrees to peace deal with Hermes family - CityAM - City A.M.,"Wed, 03 Sep 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiPGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNpdHlhbS5jb20vbHZtaC1hZ3JlZXMtcGVhY2UtZGVhbC1oZXJtZXMtZmFtaWx5L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LVMH agrees to peace deal with Hermes family

FRANCE’S richest man Bernard Arnault yesterday agreed to relinquish most of his $7.5bn (£4.5bn) holding in luxury goods maker Hermes International, bringing to an end a bitter four-year battle.

Arnault’s LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton agreed to distribute most of its 23.2 per cent stake in Hermes among its shareholders and not to acquire any shares in its smaller family-owned group for five years.

Christian Dior, LVMH’s largest shareholder, has also agreed to distribute Hermes’ shares among its shareholders.

The agreement, overseen by a French court, will effectively prevent LVMH from making a full takeover bid for the 177-year-old leather bag maker, Arnault’s holding company owning a 8.5 per cent stake in the business.

Shares in Hermes, which have soared over the past four years on the prospect of a takeover, fell 3.4 per cent yesterday to €253.75 while LVMH’s shares edged 2.9 per cent higher to €136.90.

The row between the two companies erupted in 2010 when it emerged that LVMH had built a 17 per cent stake in Hermes. It made the investment through a series of equity derivatives instead of straightforward share purchases, which prevented it from having to declaring them.

Hermes, led by the sixth-generation member of the family Axel Dumas,, vehemently protested at having its arch-rival as its biggest external shareholder and created a new holding company controlling 52 per cent of Hermes’ shares.

LVMH was fined last year by French markets regulator AMF for failing to properly disclose the stake-building.

The pair said yesterday they had “reacted favourably” to the agreement, which had “brought to an end the conflict, and all related actions” between them."

A quick scan of google stories on the French company draws attention to a number of spats that the luxury goods giant has been involved in. It‘s four year dispute with Hermes has been prominent in the news recently, but this disagreement pales into insignificance when one considers the ten year legal battle between LVMH and Google over the latter‘s alleged advertising of counterfeit products that went all the way to the EU‘s highest court.

Any further news stories will no doubt relate to the latest company being eyed up LVMH for an acquisition, and the sheer quantity of its subsidiary brands is testament to the success of this strategy. Whether it be fine wine, fashion, jewelry or cosmetics, LVMH owns some of the biggest name in every department. From its oldest subsidiary, the 16th century Chateau d‘Yquem, to one of its most recent acquisitions, the purchase of a 50 per cent stake in the Italian jeweler Bulgari for a reported £3.2 billion.

The man behind the commercial machine is Bernard Arnault, chairman of both Christian Dior and LVMH, of which Dior owns more than 40 per cent in shares as well as a 59 per cent majority in terms of voting rights. The Arnault family (led by Bernard) also owns an additional 5 per cent of LVMH‘s shares, held by Groupe Arnault. Arnault‘s journey to the helm of LVMH began in a typically Machiavellian fashion as he exploited divisions between Hennessey and Louis Vuitton in the newly-formed LVMH group. In 1988, Arnault strategically bought shares with the help of Guiness to prevent Louis Vuitton achieving the ‘blocking minority‘ they sought, which would have made managing LVMH impossible.

Since then, Arnault has pursued an ambitious and at times relentless strategy of expansion, multiplying LVMH‘s value by fifteen and increasing sales by 500 per cent in the space of eleven years, making it one of the largest luxury goods companies in the world. The group‘s brand diversity allows those more stable brands to help less-established brands to grow.

Arnault and LVMH do have a soft edge, however. Arnault‘s passion for art has resulted in the group‘s patronage of numerous major exhibitions at the Grand Palais and the Pompidou Centre in Paris. LVMH also recently announced it would sponsor the LVMH Young Fashion Designer Prize, the winner of which would receive â‚¬300,000 and the mentoring of one of the most successful fashion groups in the world. And after all, LVMH is a business and a very successful one at that."
