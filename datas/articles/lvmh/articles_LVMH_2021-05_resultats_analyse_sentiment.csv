French billionaire Bernard Arnault, the chief executive of fashion conglomerate LVMH (LVMHF), Monday dethroned Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos as the world’s wealthiest person after LVMH stock, traded on Euronext Paris, climbed to an all-time high above $155, pushing Arnault’s net worth to $186.3 billion, according to Forbes.

Arnault, 72, has seen his fortune more than double in the past year as LVMH’s global sales boomed despite the COVID-19 pandemic. In the first quarter, revenue at the group’s fashion and leather goods unit surged 52 percent from the same period in 2020 (before COVID-19 was declared a global pandemic).

LVMH shares have grown 20 percent year to date. The French conglomerate owns over 70 luxury fashion houses, including Louis Vuitton, Fendi, Christian Dior, Givenchy and others. In January, the group completed the $16 billion acquisition of Tiffany & Co. The iconic American jeweler is now headed by Louis Vuitton’s U.S. chief Anthony Ledru. Arnault’s son, Alexandre, was also appointed to Tiffany’s leadership team following the merger. The takeover is LVMH’s largest acquisition since its $13 billion merger with the Christian Dior brand in 2017.

The world’s richest person used to be a fairly steady title held by the same man for years. Bill Gates was the man for over two decades until Bezos surpassed him in 2017 and widened the lead every year. However, that changed in early 2019 after the Amazon (AMZN) founder gave away a quarter of his fortune to his ex-wife as part of their divorce settlement.

Since then, the competition has become a close race among a handful of multi-billionaires. Earlier this year, Bezos was briefly toppled by Tesla CEO Elon Musk after Tesla stock skyrocketed over eight-fold in 2020. Currently, Arnault leads Bezos by just a thin margin of just $300 million (in the scale of hundreds of billions, of course). The ranks could shake up again if Amazon stock sees a good day or LVMH trades lower on market trends or company-related news.

Arnault owns about 46 percent of LVMH, including a 6 percent direct stake in the group and a 40 percent stake through Christian Dior, which owns 41 percent of LVMH (Arnault owns 97.4 percent of Dior). He also owns 8.6 percent in French luxury house Hermès and 1.9 percent in French supermarket chain Carrefour Market.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999350309371948}",neutral,0.9999350309371948,0
Jeff Bezos battles with LVMH boss for title of world's richest man - New York Post,"Tue, 25 May 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vbnlwb3N0LmNvbS8yMDIxLzA1LzI1L2plZmYtYmV6b3MtYmF0dGxlcy13aXRoLWx2bWgtYm9zcy1mb3ItdGl0bGUtb2Ytd29ybGRzLXJpY2hlc3QtbWFuL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Jeff Bezos is locked in a tug-of-war with French luxury tycoon Bernard Arnault for the title of world’s richest person, with each of them temporarily grabbing the top spot in recent days.

Arnault — head of LVMH, the luxury empire that owns Louis Vuitton, Tiffany and Dom Perignon — held the title as of midday Tuesday as LVMH’s stock closed 0.7 percent higher on the Paris stock exchange while Amazon shares on the Nasdaq were recently flat, according to Forbes’ real-time billionaires list.

Both Arnault and Bezos currently command fortunes of about $188.3 billion, although Arnault has a slight edge over Bezos, according to Forbes.

Arnault on Monday morning had first overtaken Bezos — who has spent most of the past year in the No. 1 spot, trading it occasionally with Tesla CEO Elon Musk. By Monday afternoon, however, Amazon stock had risen by 1.3 percent compared to LVMH’s 1.2 percent, putting Bezos back on top until early Tuesday.

The pair are followed by Musk, whose net worth is currently pegged at $151.4 billion following a recent drop in Tesla shares; scandal-plagued Microsoft founder Bill Gates, whose net worth of $126.3 billion is sure to shrink following his divorce from wife Melinda; and Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, who is currently worth $118.7 billion, according to Forbes.

Unlike many other modern billionaires, 72-year-old Arnault made his fortune with old-fashioned retail stores rather than online. He formed LVMH by merging luxury fashion house Louis Vuitton and upscale spirit-maker Moët Hennessy in 1987. The firm is now Europe’s most valuable company and controls a slew of brands like Christian Dior, Givenchy, Marc Jacobs and Celine.

In January, LVMH completed its $15.8 billion acquisition of US jeweler Tiffany and installed Arnault’s son Alexandre as executive vice president. And in February, a LVMH-backed fund took a majority stake in German sandal-maker Birkenstock.

Despite pandemic-related pressure on pocketbooks, LVMH reported record revenue of 14 billion Euros in the first quarter of 2021, buoyed by strong demand from Chinese and US shoppers.

Arnault’s family owns 47.5 percent of LVMH, according to the company’s 2020 annual report.

Bezos, meanwhile has seen his wealth balloon as Amazon has grown at a breathtaking pace during the pandemic. The company reported a 44 percent year-over-year increase in sales to $108.5 billion in the first quarter of the year.

Amazon cloud computing head Andy Jassy will replace Bezos as CEO later this year.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999991655349731}",neutral,0.9999991655349731,0
"LVMH Aims to Ensure That All New Products ""Will Result from Eco-Design"" by 2030 - The Fashion Law","Mon, 10 May 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWZhc2hpb25sYXcuY29tL2x2bWgtYWltcy10by1lbnN1cmUtdGhhdC1hbGwtbmV3LXByb2R1Y3RzLXdpbGwtcmVzdWx0LWZyb20tZWNvLWRlc2lnbi1ieS0yMDMwL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"On Monday, LVMH released what it is calling its “first comprehensive social and environmental report,” in which “spotlight[s] its initiatives to support sustainable growth.” According to the Paris-based luxury goods conglomerate, the new 140-page release “provides a clear overview of the Group’s actions” – from its efforts when it comes to diversity and inclusion (Sephora, for instance, became the first retailer to join the “15 Percent Pledge” and commit a minimum of 15 percent of their shelves to Black-owned businesses) and climate change, with the group “aiming to reduce (and/or avoid) scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions per unit of added value by 55 percent by 2030, and halve emissions from energy consumption by 2026” in conjunction with its LIFE 360 venture – while also “facilitating engagement with stakeholders.”

In line with LVMH head of image, communications and environment Antoine Arnault’s recent revelation that the group plans to “stay away from the secondhand market” for the time being (he previously stated that they were “looking at” resale opportunities), it appears that LVMH is, instead, focusing at least some of its efforts on what the Bernard Arnault-run group calls “creative circularity.” In the lengthy “2020 Social and Environmental Responsibility” report, the group states that it intends to “preserv[e] natural resources and avoid waste” in part by doubling-down on its “strong belief that one of the principal characteristics of luxury products is that they should last forever.”

With this in mind, LVMH asserts that “sophisticated repair services, upcycling, reuse of precious raw materials, and efforts to find alternative materials all feed into the Group’s circular economy strategy.” Such a strategy “offers a new source of inspiration and creativity,” per LVMH, which says that it endeavors “to ensure that, by 2030, all new LVMH products will result from eco-design, so as to present a minimal environmental footprint – from raw material extraction to transformation.” All of the group’s businesses, from its Fashion & Leather Goods division to its Selective Retailing arm, “are involved in this drive to improve product composition and define eco-design practices,” the latter of which “acts as an elixir of youth,” the report states, as it “helps give products a second life by repurposing, reusing, or upcycling, and therefore, also provides a solution for unsold items.

At the same time, LVMH – which owns 75 luxury goods brands, such as Louis Vuitton, Dior, Givenchy, and Celine, as well Tiffany & Co., Bulgari, Moet & Chandon, Vueve Clicquot, and Sephora, among others – contends that it is also working to “avoid producing waste with sustainable inventory management,” noting that the “business models of [its] Maisons famously employ very tight, skillful inventory planning right from the design stage, making them very far removed from mass production.”

In terms of specific examples of “creative circularity” that are in play, the report cites the following, among others …

·· In Fashion and Leather Goods, Fendi applied an eco-design policy to its iconic Baguette and Peekaboo bags, which resulted in a Zucca motif fabric woven from recycled polyester and sustainable cotton. Beyond that, for some of the items in its 2020-21 collections, Fendi used previous collection samples, dormant stock and archive pieces.

·· Fashion house Patou has made inventory management one of its corporate purposes — striving to manufacture only what will be sold. That was the reasoning behind “Les Essentiels,” its permanent collection of timeless basics available every season. Group Maisons also have other ways of minimizing the number of unsold items, [while] in 2020, Bvlgari conducted an inventory age-check to ensure that old stock took priority over new and was not destroyed.

·· Other solutions to avoid waste include donations and recycling. For example, Fendi significantly ramped up its circular economy initiatives in Italy in 2020, donating uniforms, leather and rolls of fabric to non-profits. It also implements a range of other practices, such as reusing packaging and other items (including 10 metric tons of clothes hangers) and recycling metallic components and pieces of wool, silk, cotton and denim ready-to-wear clothing, as well as leather goods items through partnerships with a variety of service providers.

·· In France, Louis Vuitton, LVMH’s Perfumes and Cosmetics Maisons, and Sephora all work with the Environmental Center for Ecofriendly Packaging Breakdown and Recycling (“CEDRE”) to deconstruct and recycle unsold or obsolete goods. CEDRE, which will soon double the size of its processing surface area, also develops new recycling streams – after setting up channels for silk and Surlyn in 2019, it created a channel for textiles, to transform polyester and polyamide into felt in 2020.

·· Louis Vuitton’s men’s Spring/Summer 2021 collection designed by Virgil Abloh features items created using pieces from previous collections and surplus materials. For example, the Maison’s designers created the new LV Trainer by upcycling an existing model. The sneaker is made from an older version that has been disassembled by hand and features a new lining and laces. The “LV upcycling” logo is embroidered on the back of the shoe. LVMH states that “the designer” – presumably Abloh – “believes that previous collections should no longer go out of fashion and should instead be transformed into signature items that are reinterpreted from one season to the next.”

·· In 2020, Group Maisons also conducted several trials in the early stages of product design – often teaming up with environmentally minded partners—to ensure that more categories of materials and objects could be repurposed or reused. For example, Celine launched a recycling scheme for its leather scraps and Fendi is now working with Progetto Quid, an ethical fashion brand, to give a second life to discontinued fabrics.

·· Several of the Group’s Maisons also offer specific after-sales services that enhance the use-value of their products. Berluti, for example, maintains and repairs half the leather goods it sells. Its patina care ritual allows customers to change the color and burnish of their shoes, bags and belts, making them uniquely personal as a result. Meanwhile, for several years now, TAG Heuer offers its customers a first-class repair service to ensure products remain in good working order for as long as possible.

The push towards circularity comes as consumers and investors become increasingly aware of – and demand transparency about – the practices of companies on the Environmental, Social, and Corporate Governance (“ESG”) front. Interestingly, LVMH’s growing embrace of upcycling and other, similar initiatives coincides with the passage of a wide-ranging anti-waste law in France, which will ban the disposal (i.e. landfilling/incineration) of any unsold non-food products once it is implemented. The closely-watched new law, which is set to come into effect at the end of 2021/start of 2022, will subject companies to more than 100 new sustainability-centric provisions, including the prohibition on the destruction of an array of different types of unsold goods, including fashion items.

Unsurprisingly, few groups that generate revenue as a result of the large-scale turnover of high-margin goods, either in the premium/luxury space or in a more mass-market segment, have been willing to walk back on their consistent quest for scale, raising questions about whether the push to build multi-billion-dollars businesses can ever really be sustainable. Nonetheless, many have been vocal (often by way of voluntary reports) about efforts aimed at cutting down on waste, setting carbon emissions targets, addressing biodiversity risks, and boosting racial and gender diversity initiatives, among other ESG initiatives.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9990635514259338}",neutral,0.9990635514259338,0
LVMH Believes It Has the Perfect Drink to Toast the End of Lockdown - WWD,"Wed, 12 May 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3dkLmNvbS9leWUvbGlmZXN0eWxlL2NoYW5kb24tZ2FyZGVuLXNwcml0ei1wZXJmZWN0LWRyaW5rLXRvYXN0LWVuZC1vZi1sb2NrZG93bi0xMjM0ODIwMzQ4L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS — Move over, Aperol — there’s a new spritz in town.

Moët Hennessy, the wines and spirits division of luxury conglomerate LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, is planting its flag in the thriving “aperitifs” market with the launch of Chandon Garden Spritz, which hits the market just as many countries are lifting restrictions designed to curb the spread of the coronavirus.

A sparkling wine blended with bitter-orange liqueur, the drink is the brainchild of Ana Paula Bartolucci, the first female winemaker in 60 years at Chandon Argentina, one of six wineries worldwide making sparkling wine under the Chandon label.

“Our inspiration for this product was the Argentinean love for bitterness,” Bartolucci says via Zoom from Mendoza. “We drink maté every day, we drink Fernet and vermouth.”

The drink might well have been called 64, since that is the number of recipes that Bartolucci went through before hitting on the winning formula, which contains no artificial colors or aromas.

“I’m really very proud of this recipe because it’s unique: it’s made only with natural ingredients,” she says. The oranges are grown on a pesticide-free family farm, with dried and fresh rinds going into the blend. The juice is donated to local schoolchildren, while the waste gets used for compost.

“It’s a very artisanal process,” Bartolucci says. “It’s very special for me because it reminds me of my childhood, playing with some herbs and spices in the background while my grandmother’s making limoncello and narancello.”

Whereas other spritzes are made from mixing liqueur and sparkling wine just before serving, Chandon Garden Spritz is blended before bottling, meaning the quality remains the same with every glass — ideally drenched over ice with a sprig of rosemary and a sliver of dried orange.

Sibylle Scherer, president of Chandon, hopes the drink will appeal to a more health-conscious consumer.

“We see this big trend that we care about what we put in our body. We care about how it is made, where it is made, and what we put inside of us. On average, it’s half the sugar in a Garden Spritz that you would generally have with a spritz,” she explains.

Since rival Campari Group energized its Aperol Spritz with a highly successful marketing campaign in 2017, the cocktail has become near-ubiquitous, and fueled a growing trend for sparkling mixology drinks.

“We see a big evolution of consumers looking for new flavor profiles. They are open for tasting new things,” says Scherer. “It opens up a new market for us. I think we’re actually creating a new market with that product, because I don’t think that anything like Garden Spritz exists at the moment.”

The drink is launching in Europe and the U.S., marking Chandon’s first big push on the international market, underscored by a new visual identity with eye-catching vertical labels. Previously, the brand was sold mainly in the countries where it produces sparkling wine: Argentina, Brazil, the United States, India, China and Australia.

“We thought one day it would be nice to be in Europe, to be sold there, but we needed something innovative and different, because Europe doesn’t need another brut,” says Arnaud de Saignes, international director of Chandon.

“It came from a local culture, and it crossed with a global trend of aperitifs around bubbles, and we thought with this there was a unique opportunity, which was to bring to the world of spritz a signature on the sparkling wine,” he adds.

Garden Spritz is made with a dry sparkling wine that blends chardonnay, pinot noir and semillon grapes, while other spritz drinks are usually mixed with sweeter prosecco wines from Italy. Scherer said LVMH was not concerned about denting the existing market for its Moët & Chandon Champagne.

“It’s a very distinctive product that no one could produce in the Champagne region, because there’s a certain appellation and there are certain rules to it. We have the freedom to innovate a little bit, and that’s what we’re doing here, so we’re not afraid of any cannibalization. We think we bring a nice fresh approach that will support everyone in the category,” she explains.

Chandon is introducing the drink with an online and outdoor marketing campaign, starting in cities. It’s positioned at the premium level, with a recommended price of 19.50 euros a bottle in stores, or 8 to 10 euros a glass in a bar. Suggested food pairings include spicy Asian food, sushi, old cheddar, dried exotic fruits and nuts.

It will be served in specially designed ridged glasses, with Chandon’s signature seven-pointed star engraved in the base, that will be also available to buy online from July through LVMH’s wines and spirits e-commerce site Clos 19. Underscoring the positioning of the drink, its cooling bag is made from washable paper, jute and cotton.

Sampling campaigns will be key, since the team behind Garden Spritz is convinced that flavor is its strongest selling point. “The most important thing is for you to taste it and to feel the equilibrium between the sweetness, the bitterness and the acidity. I love to say that it has a tonic effect that makes you want one more sip,” says Bartolucci.

Scherer, who joined Chandon from LVMH’s travel retail business DFS and previously worked at Escada and Jet Set, hopes Garden Spritz will become popular with the fashion set once physical gatherings are authorized again.

“I would love to have us partnering with a couple of fashion brands when they have their fashion shows in the summer seasons, but I think also museums, art exhibitions. I think it’s a perfect association with us,” she says.

In the meantime, she believes it’s the ideal drink to toast the lifting of lockdown restrictions.

“In a way, the naturality of how we come together is what you have in a glass, so I think it’s the perfect drink for de-confinement. It’s the happy drink to drink on a terrace, or in the garden, or at the beach. I think it’s really what we’re all longing for at the moment,” she says.

In a battle of billionaires, Arnault and Bezos have been alternating for the top spot on Forbes real-time billionaire tracker since Monday, but as of now, the LVMH owner holds the spot. His estimated net worth currently stands at $188.0 billion, according to Forbes, nudging him past Bezos’s $187.8 billion in estimated wealth. Earlier this month, Bernard Arnault and LVMH overtook Tesla’s celebrity chief executive Elon Musk to become the world’s second-richest person. Arnault notes on the LVMH site that “[LVMH’s] business model is anchored in a long term vision that builds on the heritage of our Houses and stimulates creativity and excellence. This model drives the success of our Group and ensures its promising future.”

Forbes explained that the pandemic has been kind to LVMH, with his personal wealth gaining an eye-popping $110 billion within the past 14 months. Arnault first got his start in the construction business, but in 1984 acquired the parent company of Dior. He then acquired a controlling stake in LVMH in 1989. Arnault made his name and money from a collection of companies specializing in finely made leather goods, couture fashion, and high-end spirits. Arnault, 72, became a controlling stake of the company in the late 1980s, in a saga that earned him the nickname “the wolf in cashmere.” He was instrumental in forging it into what is today the world’s largest luxury seller.

Earlier this year, LVMH acquired America’s largest jewelry maker Tiffany & Co. for $15.8 million which is the largest deal in the luxury fashion business to date. Bernard Arnault’s LVMH oversees an empire of 70 brands including Givenchy, Guerlain, Marc Jacobs, Sephora, Tiffany & Co., Emilio Pucci, Fendi, Loro Piana, Nicholas Kirkwood, Thomas Pink, R.M Williams, EDUN, Moynat, and Donna Karan, along with a host of jewelry brands, including TAG Heuer, De Beers, and Bvlgari.

What's Next for LVMH's Fashion Group | BoF - The Business of Fashion,"Tue, 11 May 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzb2ZmYXNoaW9uLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy9sdXh1cnkvd2hhdHMtbmV4dC1mb3ItbHZtaHMtZmFzaGlvbi1ncm91cC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Until recently, you could count the number of notable disposals by LVMH on one hand: Christian Lacroix, Donna Karan, Michael Kors (in which it owned a 33 percent stake) and the Edun ethical fashion label founded with singer Bono were among the few projects the luxury giant had scrapped rather than hoarding them in its stable of 75 brands.

But since the pandemic, changes at the French luxury group’s portfolio of smaller labels have been coming at a clip. The group cut loose shoemaker Nicholas Kirkwood last fall, put its Fenty fashion startup with Rihanna on indefinite pause, and ceased operations at shirtmaker Thomas Pink.

“Many of us spent the last year at home cleaning out their cupboards. I think at LVMH it’s a bit the same,” said Pauline Brown, a former chief executive of LVMH Americas and board member of Neiman Marcus Group.

The group also swapped out designers whose efforts to revamp brands failed to take off quickly. Last April, Clare Waight Keller exited Givenchy after 3 years. This spring, Berluti’s designer Kris Van Assche and Kenzo’s Felipe Oliveira Baptista are both on the way out. (Moynat, a small leather goods brand owned separately by LVMH chairman Bernard Arnault’s family holding company Groupe Arnault, also replaced its designer Ramesh Nair with a new creative director hired from Vuitton, Nicolas Knightly.)

The moves come as customers flock to the most famous and well-funded luxury names following the coronavirus crisis, which has widened the gap between so-called “megabrands” and the small and mid-sized labels which had already been struggling to grow before the pandemic. Sales at LVMH’s Louis Vuitton and Dior flagships surged from 2016 through 2019, along with those of rivals like Hermès and Kering’s Gucci, while smaller competitors like Valentino, Chloé or Tod’s saw their market share slipping.

At LVMH, whose annual sales were €45 billion ($55 billion) last year, even brands with dozens of stores and hundreds of millions in sales can fly under the radar, sheltered from financial scrutiny — but also, at times, starved for management attention — as they ride in the wake of giants like Louis Vuitton and Dior. As the biggest brands bounce back rapidly (LVMH’s first-quarter fashion sales were up 37 percent over pre-pandemic levels), investors are less likely to inquire about the group’s underperforming projects.

LVMH’s fashion strategy is still being decided brand-by-brand

Still, some analysts have questioned whether smaller brands still make sense for huge luxury groups. “Bolt-on” acquisitions are tricky to scale and can be seen as a distraction for management, and a money pit for investment capital that might be better spent on growing the group’s more-profitable core businesses. The scale of LVMH’s recent acquisitions, like American jeweller Tiffany (with $4.4 billion in sales in 2019) or hotel group Belmond (whose 2018 revenues were $550 million) suggest the bar is getting higher for how big and illustrious an asset needs to be to win the group’s attention. LVMH is placing bets on early-stage businesses, but rather than buying them outright has started investing though dedicated vehicles like its Luxury Ventures fund, whose structure might turn out to be a better fit for emerging brands like Gabriella Hearst or Madhappy.

The faster pace of disposals and designer changes also underscores that while Arnault has taken a famously long-term approach to investing in brands, the portfolio is still being constantly reviewed. And Sidney Toledano, the fashion executive who has been overseeing most of LVMH’s smaller brands since 2018, is likely eager to show results in his new role after a knockout tenure of more than 20 years scaling up the Christian Dior Couture label and pushing it upmarket. LVMH tapped an executive from Sephora, Guillaume Motte, to serve as Toledano’s deputy starting May 3.

The changes might seem to suggest a broader shift in how the group views smaller fashion businesses. But LVMH’s fashion strategy is still being decided brand-by-brand, sources familiar with the matter said.

LVMH declined to make a spokesperson available for comment.

Bernard Arnault invests “intensely, but selectively,” Brown said. While some acquisitions, like Emilio Pucci, have languished while the group waits to land on the right formula to revive them, others have continued to receive high degrees of investment and support.

A high-budget effort to reboot Celine under star designer Hedi Slimane initially led to a steep decline in sales, but the business is starting to bounce back as sales of a new monogrammed canvas line take off. Despite the rocky start, LVMH sees potential for Slimane’s more commercial vision to appeal to a broader audience than Phoebe Philo’s more intellectual positioning.

Loewe is also rebounding from the pandemic, LVMH has said. The brand, known for high-priced leather goods made in Spain, has been filling in its offer with more accessible items like sunglasses, straw bags, smartphone covers, and tie-dyed t-shirts from its “Paula’s Ibiza” sub-brand.

Givenchy was one of the only major LVMH brands not to be mentioned during the group’s first-quarter results. Its new designer Matthew Williams joined during the pandemic and has yet to stage a full-blown fashion show with a physical audience and the jury is still out on whether his reboot will resonate.

Givenchy’s perfume business performed well even as the fashion business slipped following designer Riccardo Tisci’s departure in 2018. LVMH’s objectives for the brand are unclear, but its commitment to owning it is unlikely to have been shaken by recent sluggishness.

“When Bernard Arnault really believes in a brand, he’s willing to wait, and they have the financial firepower to do so,” said Isabelle Chaboud, director of the MsC program in fashion and luxury at Grenoble Ecole de Management business school.

LVMH isn’t likely to cut loose smaller luxury labels with a storied heritage and craftsmanship, either, even if today’s competitive landscape has made scaling them a challenge. But its framework for managing those brands seems to have become more malleable, with a few brands now planning to deviate from the group’s somewhat one-size-fits-all playbook of appointing a star ready-to-wear designer, opening dozens of retail stores, and refocusing the business on handbags.

Pucci has been operating without a creative director since 2017. While the brand pokes its head into fashion’s spotlight with occasional designer collaborations, its main focus is on repositioning its products and store network with a clearer focus on resort wear. (The brand’s pastel silk dresses and scarves play better in Miami’s design district or Capri than on Paris’s Avenue Montaigne.)

When Bernard Arnault really believes in a brand, he’s willing to wait.

Berluti, where Bernard Arnault’s son Antoine has been chief executive since 2011, has no immediate plans to hire a new creative director, the sources said. As a prestigious maker of custom shoes which also absorbed a top-end Paris suit-maker, Arnys, Berluti has heritage and potential, to be sure. But it’s unclear if runway collections will continue to be the best way to animate the brand.

The right designer might come along for both of those projects, but LVMH isn’t going to rush it.

Kenzo, on the other hand, is actively seeking a new designer, sources said. Felipe Oliveira Baptista’s effort to go back to the house’s founding codes including colourful, bohemian dresses didn’t quite hit the mark, so the group will likely prioritise candidates with a clear vision for premium apparel that could help revive the brand’s more recent success instead. (A line of $200 tiger sweatshirts launched under former designers Humberto Leon and Carol Lim still sells.)

After selling Donna Karan to G-III apparel in 2016, LVMH’s commitment to more accessibly-priced labels like Kenzo has been unclear. But management feels the brand has visibility and potential in the key Asian market.

Another more accessibly-priced label in its stable, Marc Jacobs, is finally showing signs of a turnaround (though it’s still a long way from where it was in 2013, with almost $1 billion in sales and dreams of a splashy IPO). The brand returned to profitability in 2020 after 5 years of losses, LVMH said in a January investor call.

LVMH’s most successful efforts in fashion have been when it acquired labels like Louis Vuitton, Dior and Fendi that were “a bigger brand than a business” Brown points out.

That’s worked for the likes of Givenchy and Celine, too, at times when their designers’ message was in synch with the fashion zeitgeist. They benefitted from periods of intensive financial support, as well as the from company’s expertise in retail and negotiating clout for real estate.

When a brand needs to be built or rebuilt from the ground up, however — as with start-up projects like Fenty — the roadmap is less clear. A bid to revive defunct fashion brand Patou (an acquisition that was partly motivated by Dior’s interest in taking over Patou’s “Joy” perfume trademark) kicked off with a first show by designer Guillaume Henry in March 2020. Despite the debut’s ill-timed debut, the launch has managed to secure some early interest from e-tailers and department stores. But the project is operating at such a small scale that it could be an uphill climb to hold its owner’s attention.

Even brands that never scale up can be of interest for Arnault, however. Owning such a long list of brands provides negotiating leverage: for marketing rates on Instagram and Facebook, or for securing attractive rents and prime spots in new malls. The brands also allow him to offer a variety of opportunities to keep top creative talent in his employ. Hedi Slimane was lured back to the group after a 3 year hiatus from fashion with the promise of having carte blanche to reboot Celine. Menswear designer Kim Jones bounced from Louis Vuitton to Dior, before adding Fendi womenswear to his purview.

“Being highly diversified is one of the big strengths of LVMH,” Chaboud said. The financial power of the group puts them in a position where they can afford to hold onto assets, waiting for the right moment to push.

As of 8am ET on May 25, Forbes estimated his net worth at $188.2 billion, ahead of Arnault’s $187.6 billion.

Bernard Arnault, CEO and majority owner of French luxury group LVMH, has surpassed Amazon founder Jeff Bezos to become the world’s richest person.

His estimated net worth currently stands at $186.3 billion, according to Forbes, nudging him past Bezos’s $186 billion in estimated wealth. Tesla founder Elon Musk stands third, with a net worth of $147 billion.

Whereas Bezos built his fortune as the proprietor of the internet’s “everything store,” Arnault made his name and money from a collection of companies specializing in finely made leather goods, couture fashion, and high-end spirits. LVMH is the parent behind a number of globally known names in luxury, including Louis Vuitton, Dior, Celine, Moët, Hennessy, and now Tiffany. Arnault, 72, maneuvered his way into a controlling stake of the company in the late 1980s, in a saga that earned him the nickname “the wolf in cashmere.” He was instrumental in forging it into what is today the world’s largest luxury seller.

Over the past several months, as LVMH has seen its sales come roaring back from the pandemic, particularly among Chinese and US shoppers, its stock price has soared, and Arnault’s wealth with it. By November, he had become the world’s second-richest person and was gaining ground on Bezos.

At the time, the Arnault family held 47.5% of LVMH’s shares, according to the company’s last annual report (pdf). In recent months, Arnault has spent about $538 million buying up more stock, the price of which keeps growing.

Amazon, meanwhile, has seen its sales surge through the pandemic, but its share price hasn’t grown consistently since the end of last year. Its stock may be hugely undervalued, however, at least according to one analyst. If the market agrees and drives its price up, Bezos could reclaim his throne again.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9956028461456299}",neutral,0.9956028461456299,0
Bernard Arnault Is Now the World's Richest Person. Thanks China? - Jing Daily,"Mon, 24 May 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQWh0dHBzOi8vamluZ2RhaWx5LmNvbS9wb3N0cy9iZXJuYXJkLWFybmF1bHQtd29ybGRzLXJpY2hlc3QtcGVyc29u0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"What happened

Move over, Jeff Bezos; there’s a bigger billionaire in town. On May 24, Forbes named fashion tycoon Bernard Arnault the world’s richest person with an estimated net worth of 186.3 billion, beating out the Amazon founder by 300 million. Tied over the weekend , the chief executive of LVMH saw his personal stake jump more than 600 million after the group’s stock rose 0.4 percent on Monday morning. This, plus strong comebacks from star brands Louis Vuitton and Dior, helped Arnault’s fortune surge over 110 billion since March 2020.

The Jing Take

Although the pecking order has fluctuated wildly during the pandemic, Arnault’s climb to the top reflects not only the resilience of global luxury, but also the strength of European fashion houses in particular. In March, LVMH dethroned food giant Nestlé as the largest company on the European stock market, with a capitalization of around 319 billion as of late February. Meanwhile, robust performances from Kering and Chanel similarly helped owners François Pinault and Alain and Gerard Wertheimer more than double their net worth to 55.1 billion and 35 billion, respectively, in just the past 14 months.

This is not to say, however, that the European market has recovered. In fact, Europe is where many brands reported losses due to store closures, a lack of international tourism, and a slower vaccination campaign. Rather, Arnault and other industry leaders have Chinese consumers to thank for their soaring fortunes. LVMH, for one, surpassed 2019 numbers with a revenue of 16.7 billion in the first quarter, bolstered by an 86 percent sales increase in Asia. And key to this growth has been catering to local clients, from celebrating Lunar New Year and 520 Chinese Valentine’s Day with special collections, to staging appearances for Dior at Shanghai Fashion Week, to scheduling pop-up stores and exhibitions in major Chinese cities.

Of course, it’s unclear how long Arnault will be able to keep his crown, especially with Bezos just a few hundred million behind. However, as the LVMH empire expands through the acquisition of Tiffany & Co., unprecedented partnerships, and more activations in the mainland, the businessman can expect his net worth to remain ridiculously, enviably high.

The person in question reportedly presented himself an an intermediary of Bernard Arnault and his interests. He placed himself in a position where he was considered to be the linchpin of the deal between Elliot and LVMH. The individual brought on a general manager and got him to start assembling a senior management team ready to takeover Milan. Two other people were thereafter involved in the scam as they posed as a business partner and financial adviser to the deal.

Opinion: Luxury fashion still has a long way to go to fix its DE&I problem - Glossy,"Fri, 28 May 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmdsb3NzeS5jby9mYXNoaW9uL29waW5pb24tbHV4dXJ5LWZhc2hpb24tc3RpbGwtaGFzLWEtbG9uZy13YXktdG8tZ28tdG8tZml4LWl0cy1kZWktcHJvYmxlbS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Luxury has long had issues around race. Saks was accused of discriminating against its Black employees in 2018, LVMH only recently named its first Black woman creative director, in 2019, and Salvatore Ferragamo received blowback for showing allegedly inauthentic support of the Black community in 2020.

The raft of diversity and inclusion hires in luxury fashion over the last few years has shown the industry’s slowly shifting viewpoint on the matter. But that’s not to say that there still isn’t a long way to go. The use of DE&I departments has been viewed as the end of a culturally insensitive scandal instead of the beginning of a new system.

This approach has the knock-on effect of creating a system where DE&I exists solely to protect the brand from another scandal rather than truly introducing internal change. So how does luxury fashion work to change this?

According to Renée E. Tirado, who was hired by Gucci in July 2019 before leaving to found her own consultancy in July 2020, there are common issues within the current system. “Major roadblocks are financial investment, holistic implementation and prioritization,” she said, adding that “brand preservation trumps all things.”

A key point that Tirado mentioned is responsibility, saying, “Who is really holding luxury fashion — [or] any industry, for that matter — accountable?” And without true and official accountability, DE&I will be dependent on the companies themselves to provide a supportive environment.

If companies don’t provide this environment, then they’ll be at a disadvantage in establishing DE&I. Tirado said that working within an unsupportive framework makes change “not impossible, but infinitely harder and much slower, and gains are small.”

“In these environments, the wins will be minuscule and [will] mostly serve to provide emotional support and community for diverse employees,” she said. “While important, these are softer wins that do not sufficiently impact culture change.”

Tirado said that one-off events don’t result in meaningful change, though she didn’t mention any one brand specifically. Italian brand recruited the likes of filmmaker Ava DuVernay for a newly created diversity council in 2019, after its storefront scandal of 2018. Soon, after the brand launched Prada Mode, a one-off event curated by Black artist Theaster Gates. However, it was only in October 2020 that the brand hired a chief DE&I officer in Malika Savell, who’d previously worked at LVMH.

Gucci released a statement to Glossy, stating that, since Tirado’s move to consultancy, “DE&I responsibilities at Gucci are now managed by the Gucci Equity Board,” going onto state that Bethann Hardison had also been moved to the brand’s global equity board as an executive adviser for global equity and culture engagement.

Advertising expert Kai Lawson said that, to bring about true change, you have to imprint diversity from the beginning. “Most of us who focus on marketing and inclusion are trying to impress upon people the importance of incorporating inclusive thinking as soon as you have the idea,” she said.

“At the time of a brief, that’s the time to start talking about inclusion,” she said. “Anything after that is too reactive.” For Lawson, this subtle shift is how you end up with only damage limitation instead of internal change. “Instead of having conversations about how to be inclusive, you end up having questions saying, ‘Is this offensive?’ And by that time, it’s too late.”

But that’s not to say that there hasn’t been progress. Tirado said that “the addition of dedicated staff has been hugely impactful.” Previously, the job of DE&I fell upon POC employees, which led to burnout as they worked to fix inclusion on top of their regular roles. But there’s still more that can be done.

Tirado said that a key change for luxury fashion would be to “treat DE&I as a change management agenda.” This would see brands “providing DE&I departments substantive budgets that invest in diverse talent thoughtfully, are tied to metrics and evolve with the business.”

This would also come with education for management. “Leadership needs to have the know-how to manage, develop and grow diverse talent, by knowing how to recognize their inherent biases and how they show up.”

But perhaps the most important shift for luxury fashion would be to fundamentally change how it views DE&I. In its current state, it remains an initiative you’d use to put a Band-Aid over a recent racism scandal. Gucci hired Tirado after being accused of blackface and offending Sikh culture.

“Move away from looking at DE&I as an ‘initiative,’ and treat it as an ongoing business imperative,” said Tirado. “An initiative has a timestamp; the health of the business does not.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9995397329330444}",neutral,0.9995397329330444,0

How LVMH is Setting the Tone for Luxury After the Pandemic - CEO Today,"Fri, 28 May 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNlb3RvZGF5bWFnYXppbmUuY29tLzIwMjEvMDUvaG93LWx2bWgtaXMtc2V0dGluZy10aGUtdG9uZS1mb3ItbHV4dXJ5LWFmdGVyLXRoZS1wYW5kZW1pYy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"How LVMH is Setting the Tone for Luxury After the Pandemic

The collapse in international tourism has only made matters worse. Whether it’s London’s West End or Tokyo’s Ginza, luxury retailers pack together to attract well-heeled travellers both domestic and international.

International tourists can count for as much as 75% of footfall in those locations, and a tendency to buy higher-priced, higher-margin products means their importance to profits is even greater.

Against that background, Louis-Vuitton Moet Hennessy’s (LVMH) results for the first quarter of 2021 were hugely impressive.

Bumper numbers from industry bellwether

We see LVMH, which owns 44 other luxury brands as well as the eponymous three, as a bellwether for the wider luxury good industry. Its markets range from watches to wine, and it operates in 80 countries around the world.

The company reported revenues of €14.0bn in the first quarter of 2021. That’s a 30% increase year-on-year, benefitting from weaker comparisons as the pandemic struck the crucial Chinese market early. However, it’s also an 8% uplift on 2019 numbers – an especially impressive performance given many stores remain shut under coronavirus restriction.

With the exception of ‘Selective Retailing’, where Duty-Free brand DFS has struggled, the group saw year-on-year growth across all its operating divisions. The US and Asia have recovered particularly well, although Europe continues to struggle against significant restrictions on trading and travel.

One interesting feature of the results is the rapid growth in online sales. It’s difficult to see how the traditional luxury boutiques of the Via Monte Napoleone in Milan translate into online outlets – but they have, and they’ve done so spectacularly well.

That’s a testament to the strength of the brands groups like LVMH own. Many have taken decades, even centuries in the case of some wine brands, to build. Despite being stuck at home, wealthy shoppers still want the thrill that goes with buying a Dior bag or TAG Heuer watch. It’s a trend that’s been repeated across the luxury goods sector. Leather goods group Hermès saw first-quarter sales rise 44% year-on-year and 33% on 2019, while Gucci owner Kering saw year-on-year revenues jump 25.8%.

Perhaps that resilience shouldn’t be such a surprise though. Historically wealth has tended to fare better than income during a downturn – and as a result, spending by luxury goods customers fares better than other big-ticket goods.

Vanity or sanity?

But, as the old financial saying goes: “revenues are vanity, profit is sanity”. None of LVMH, Hermès or Kering provided profit numbers alongside first-quarter results and there are reasons to think costs have increased substantially.

Leases on properties still have to be paid, despite the fact they have stood empty for much of the last 12 months. And luxury goods shops are located in some of the most expensive real estate going. Manufacturing costs are likely to have increased as factories are forced to comply with strict COVID precautions. But the biggest burden on the industry is the development of substantial online operations, at very short notice.

Fortunately, the industry is coming from a strong base. Operating margins for luxury goods groups are often in the double digits, with several of the strongest enjoying margins of over 20% prior to the pandemic. That provides a healthy margin for error. While cost headwinds may hold back profitability in the early part of this year, with consequences for shareholders returns, this certainly isn’t an existential crisis for the industry.

It’s in that robust performance which is the industry’s chief appeal lies as an investor.

Luxury goods will enjoy booms and busts, but demand is more stable than some more cyclical parts of the economy. Healthy margins provide an additional level of security. A tradition of founder-owners – including Bernard Arnault at LVMH, Johann Rupert at Richemont and the Hermès family to name just a few– has also meant the industry has historically taken a conservative approach to debt.

Historically wealth has tended to fare better than income during a downturn – and as a result, spending by luxury goods customers fares better than other big-ticket goods.

Quality at a price

Put all that together and you get an attractive, defensive investment.

Unfortunately, the market’s well aware of those attractions, and luxury shares are now almost as expensive as the products they sell.

As of the start of May, the big European luxury goods names all trade on at least 27 times analyst forecast profits for the next 12 months or more. For long-term investors that might not be a deal-breaker for a quality business, but bargains these are not. By way of comparison, you can pick up shares in consumer goods giant Unilever for 19.5 times next year’s profits while Apple shares only trade on 24.6 times earnings.

What does the future hold?

To justify those sorts of price tags the market usually wants more than solid dependability. It wants growth.

Back in January management consultants Bain reckoned total luxury goods spending will return to 2019 level by the end of 2022 or early 2023. We suspect that might prove to be an underestimate given the strength of the first quarter, but longer-term they expect growth of around 10% a year between 2020 and 2025.

Assuming established players maintain their current market shares that would be a very nice tailwind to growth revenues. However, profit could be even stronger, thanks in part to the online sales operations that are currently causing operators such a headache.

Property costs groups like LVMH billions every year, and the vast majority of that relates to stores. Online sales are lower cost, since you don’t need well turned out store assistants and a premium store location. Online stores also make it easy to complete regular transactions – useful when not all your customers live a convenient distance from the nearest luxury shopping quarter.

All-in, while stores will remain a key route to market for luxury groups, a robust online performance could do wonders for margins.

Luxury goods companies have always enjoyed exceptionally high-quality revenues. However, if the industry can grow digital sales without diluting brand image in the years to come, then they could turn out to be 24-carat gold.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9803967475891113}",positive,0.9803967475891113,1

Arnault and his family’s new net worth of $186.3 billion was made official by Forbes on Monday, however, both Arnault and Bezos’ rankings seesawed throughout.

His company, LVMH, was one of several companies that thrived during the coronavirus pandemic.

For several years, Americans have ruled the top three spots in Forbes’ Richest People rankings, from Bezos to Tesla CEO Elon Musk, and Microsoft’s Bill Gates, Forbes reported.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999732971191406}",neutral,0.9999732971191406,0
The future of Tod's - Vogue Business,"Fri, 21 May 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZvZ3VlYnVzaW5lc3MuY29tL2NvbXBhbmllcy90aGUtZnV0dXJlLW9mLXRvZHMtbHZtaNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"To receive the Vogue Business newsletter, sign up here.

The future of Tod’s took a surprising turn this week with chairman Diego Della Valle signalling his intention to stand back from day-to-day management and openness to sell a larger stake to LVMH if he decided to sell.

“If one day I decide [to sell] I believe in people like Bernard [Arnault], but nothing is in the view,” Della Valle told the Financial Times on Wednesday. “No one believes me but I need one year to prepare the team and I am ready to [free up my time] by 60-70 per cent,” Della Valle added in the FT interview, suggesting a change in management to family members.

Della Valle’s comments follow news that LVMH would increase its stake in Tod’s to 10 per cent, up from 3.2 per cent. In a press statement on 22 April, the companies said the transaction reinforces “the 20-year friendship between the Arnault and Della Valle families”, boosting the share price.

“The fact that LVMH bought a small stake recently seemed to indicate that the door was open for a bigger deal. The recent statements of Mr. Della Valle confirm this,” says Bernstein analyst Luca Solca. “If anything, the most recent statements seem to indicate he is putting some pressure on Arnault to step up?”



LVMH declined to comment. Tod’s Group said no bankers have been hired for a potential transaction and the group has not been approached by potential buyers. Industry watchers have speculated LVMH rival Kering, who sold footwear brand Sergio Rossi in 2015 after a failed turnaround, is an unlikely buyer given the 10 per cent stake of LVMH. More likely suitors are Italian groups such as Moncler or Exor, the Agnelli family holding company who recently took a 24 per cent stake in Christian Louboutin and has rumoured ambitions to be an Italian answer to LVMH; Della Valle has, however, made it clear his sights for a (currently hypothetical) sale of an additional stake are set on Arnault.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9998200535774231}",neutral,0.9998200535774231,0

Earlier this month, he had overtaken Tesla’s celebrity chief executive Elon Musk to become the world’s second richest person.

Arnault’s net worth has been estimated at $186.2 billion, according to Forbes. In the last one and half years, Bernard Arnault’s net worth rose by $110 billion taking his overall net worth to $161.2 billion. Louis Vuitton Moet Hennessy is a symbol of luxury and it has reported a 32% yearly surge in the revenue to 14 billion euros in the first quarter of 2021.

LVMH Moët Hennessy — Louis Vuitton is a uniquely diversified group which specialises in luxury products, be it wine, champagne, leather goods, apparel, perfumes, cosmetics, watches, jewellery, etc. Louis Vuitton, Tag Heuer, Bulgari, Givenchy, Marc Jacobs, Christian Dior, Moët & Chandon are some of the notable brands under LVMH Moët Hennessy — Louis Vuitton group.

Earlier this year, LVMH acquired America’s largest jewellery maker Tiffany & Co. for $15.8 million which is the largest deal in the luxury fashion business to date. Bernard Arnault’s LVMH oversees an empire of 70 brands including Givenchy, Guerlain, Marc Jacobs, Sephora, Tiffany & Co., Emilio Pucci, Fendi, Loro Piana, Nicholas Kirkwood, Thomas Pink, R.M Williams, EDUN, Moynat and Donna Karen, along with a host of jewellery brands, including TAG Heuer, De Beers and Bulgari. Arnault owns a 96.5 per cent stake in Christian Dior, which controls 41 per cent of LVMH.

Bernard Arnault dared to be unconventional:

After graduating with an engineering degree in 1971, he joined his father’s company, Ferinel. In 1976, he convinced his father to liquidate the construction division of the company, and change focus to real estate. Developed a speciality in holiday accommodation. Bernard then became CEO in 1977 and succeeded his father as president of the company. In 1984 he used the success of Ferinel to acquire the fledgeling textile company which owned the Christian Dior brand. He sold most of the companies’ assets and kept only the prestigious Christian Dior brand. He was able to leverage the sale of other parts of the company, and the success of the resurgent Christian Dior to buy a controlling interest in LVMH.

In the late 1980s two major brands, Louis Vuitton and Moet Hennessy merged. Moet Hennessy is a reputed champagne producer. Bernard provided $1.5 billion making him LVMH’s largest shareholder. By 1989, Bernard owned 43.5% of the company and was unanimously elected chairman of the executive management board. LVMH was stratospherically successful. Consequently, the share value of LVMH has soared along with Bernard’s net worth helping him knock Bill Gates off the number 2 spot on the global rich list. Bernard’s wealth is now more than 3% of the French economy and is likely to continue growing. Bernard Arnault also invested in Netflix in 1999 and has a large art portfolio.

New Delhi: World's leading fashion luxury goods company Louis Vuitton Moet Hennessey (LMVH) owner Bernard Arnault dethroned Amazon founder Jeff Bezos as the world's richest man. As per Forbes, Arnault claimed the number one spot with a net worth of $186.4 billion beating Bezos whose net worth stands at $186 billion. Arnault has added over $47 billion to his net worth so far in 2021.

Last week, the French billionaire ended the day $800 million richer—with a net worth of $186 billion—after the company’s shares closed nearly half a percent higher in Europe, tying with Bezos for the number one spot. On the other hand, Amazon stock dropped by a little more than 1% on Friday, shaving $2.3 billion from Bezos’ net worth placing both men at the $186 billion-mark.

Arnault oversees an empire of 70 brands including Louis Vuitton and Sephora. He owns a 96.5 per cent stake in Christian Dior, which controls 41 per cent of LVMH. Earlier this year in January, LVMH completed a deal for American jeweler Tiffany & Co for $15.8 billion, believed to be the biggest luxury brand acquisition ever. LVMH spent $3.2 billion in 2019 for luxury hospitality group, Belmond, which owns or manages 46 hotels, trains and river cruises.

Arnault was born on March 5, 1949, in Roubaix, the third-largest city in France. He studied engineering at the Ecole Polytechnique, a prestigious school. For the unversed, Arnault's father made a small fortune in construction. Arnault got his start by putting up $15 million from that business to buy Christian Dior in 1985.

In 1989, Arnault became the majority shareholder of LVMH Moët Hennessy – Louis Vuitton, thereby creating the world’s leading luxury products group. Note that four of Arnault's five children work in corners of the LVMH empire: Frédéric, Delphine, Antoine and Alexandre.

It is worth adding that LVMH posted a record $16.7 billion revenues in the first quarter of 2021. LVMH’s strong recovery from the pandemic’s impact on the fashion industry helped Arnault grow more than $100 billion richer since the depths of the market rout in early March last year. Arnault was worth $76 billion on Forbes’ 2020 billionaires list, which was calculated using stock prices from mid-March 2020.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999891519546509}",neutral,0.9999891519546509,0

No to second hand, yes to products’ duration. Yes to physical fashion shows and no to their frenzy. Yes to sustainability, not to its rankings. Yes to leathers and furs and to greater cooperation between luxury groups. To WWD, the young Arnault describes the next steps of the French giant led by his father Bernard.

Second hand and fashion shows

For the moment, LVMH has no plans to get involved in the second-hand market. Antoine Arnault recognises that it is a thriving business with great prospect, but he observes: “We have durable products, and we repair them. These products should never be thrown away”. Speaking of fashion shows, the young Arnault observes that “physical fashion shows will absolutely continue. We have probably reached the end of a cycle at the beginning of this pandemic, and the end of a system. There has been a kind of frenzy in recent years, and perhaps we have been swept into a vortex for always wanting to offer something extravagant and new”.

Leathers and furs

LVMH leaves full freedom to individual brands when it comes to materials. “The truth is that through the trade in animal leathers and furs, it is possible to contribute to the conservation of the species”, confirms Arnault. The manager stresses that there are economies and people who support themselves with the trade of leathers and furs: “We have made the decision to continue to help these economies and these people”.

Sustainability and collaboration

“We feel very confident that we have taken the right path. I think, in the long run, we are making the correct decision not to be obsessed with this or that sustainability ranking. The methodology underlying these rankings is sometimes not very transparent”. LVMH did not sign the Kering Fashion Pact and Kering did not join the Aura blockchain consortium founded by LVMH. But despite this, Arnault says there is a tendency “to cooperate more than people think with our competitors for the simple reason that we often have the same suppliers. So, we talk often to try to improve practices, create new standards, and I think it’s important to maintain a good relationship”.

The French fashion tycoon’s net worth exceeded Amazon’s Jeff Bezos for a short period of time on Monday morning before Bezos eventually reclaimed the top spot later in the day.

In the early hours of Monday morning, Chairman and CEO of luxury conglomerate LVMH, Bernard Arnault’s net worth rose to US$186.3 billion, surpassing Jeff Bezos’ worth at the time by US$300 million, according to Forbes’ real-time billionaire tracker. This made Arnault the world’s richest person for a few hours before Bezos eventually reclaimed his title after the markets opened in New York, pushing up Amazon’s shares.

While Bernard Arnault and family may not be at the top of the list, the drastic increase in their fortune since March last year has been nothing short of astounding. LVMH’s incredible performance despite the Covid-19 pandemic in the last 14 months played a key role in advancing Arnault’s fortune which rose from US$76 billion in March 2020 to US$186.3 billion on Monday morning.

LVMH is a luxury conglomerate overseeing 75 global luxury brands specialising in a number of different fields including, couture fashion, fine leather goods and alcohols. Some of the most recognised brands under the LVMH umbrella are Louis Vuitton, Moët, Hennessy, Celine, and Dior. In the 1980s, Arnault acquired a controlling stake of the company in one of the fiercest sagas in the history of fashion, earning him the nickname “the wolf in cashmere”. Thereafter he set about expanding the LVMH umbrella, bringing in the world’s top brands and enhancing the conglomerate’s portfolio. In January 2021, LVMH made a significant luxury fashion business deal when it acquired the largest jewellery maker in the US, Tiffany & Co., for US$15.8 million. Needless to say, he was instrumental in building LVMH into what it is today.

In the current climate of lockdowns which saw the closure of many retail and manufacturing locations, LVMH’s sales continued to defiantly rise in the past several months. Fuelled by an increase in consumption in China and the US, LVMH’s stock prices, and by extension, Arnault’s net worth, soared. By November 2020, he had taken over Bill Gates as the second richest person in the world and was gaining ground on Bezos. According to a company annual report, Arnault and his family owned 47.5% of LVMH’s shares at the time, but this continued to increase as Arnault spent around US$538 million buying up stocks in recent months, increasing their ownership and net worth.

In the first quarter of 2021, LVMH recorded a revenue of US$17 billion, an increase of 32% from the first quarter in 2020, further driving the net worth of Arnault and his family.

At the time of writing, Jeff Bezos has reclaimed his throne at the top of Forbes’ list of billionaires with a net worth of US$188.2 billion with Bernard Arnault and family close behind with a marginally lower net worth of US$187.3 billion.

French are big on charity but suspicious of donors who give too much - RFI English,"Fri, 28 May 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMingFodHRwczovL3d3dy5yZmkuZnIvZW4vZnJhbmNlLzIwMjEwNTI4LWZyZW5jaC1hcmUtYmlnLW9uLWNoYXJpdHktYnV0LXN1c3BpY2lvdXMtb2YtZG9ub3JzLXdoby1naXZlLXRvby1tdWNoLWJpbGxpb25haXJlcy1waGlsYW50aHJvcHktbm90cmUtZGFtZS1jYXRoZWRyYWwtbHZtaNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Philanthropy

The French gave 7.5 billion euros to charity in 2020 – a record – but despite their own generosity, people are deeply mistrustful of philanthropic donors who throw big money at a cause. Doing it very publicly is even worse, as shown by the backlash against massive pledges to restore Paris's fire-ravaged Notre-Dame cathedral.

LVMH boss Bernard Arnault (R.), France's richest man, pledged 200 million euros to the Notre Dame restoration fund. At the Dior fashion show, Paris 2014, with actors Sean Penn and Charlize Theron.

Individual donations to French charities jumped by more than 13 percent in last year, according to France Générosités, which collects data on 56 charities.

Five million households gave a total of 1 billion euros, nearly half of which went towards food aid and social housing for disadvantaged families.

“France united,” tweeted President Emmanuel Macron when the figures were published last week.

Overall, people in France gave 7.5 billion euros to charity last year and the bulk was a mixture of corporate and individual philanthropy, largely made through foundations.

A welcome sum, but a fraction of the 400 billion euros Americans contribute to their charitable causes each year.

“In the US people give back to the community,” says Anne Monier, a researcher at the Philanthropy Chair at ESSEC business school, author of Nos chers ""Amis Américains"" (Our Dear American Friends).

“There are a lot of major donors and big philanthropists, so elites give to their universities, churches, cultural institutions.”

In France there's a direct relationship between individuals and the state, Monier explains, and the community is less important. This reflects France's so-called social contract where the state keeps control of public interests.

As a result, French people give mainly to “child protection, medical research and poverty” and rely on the government to fully fund the ""key values of French culture"" namely education, health and the arts.

Spotlight on France, episode 55 © RFI

Listen to the interview with Anne Monier in the Spotlight on France podcast

Tax rebates

Philanthropy is nonetheless growing in France, particularly since the 1980s boosted by what Monier calls ""a lot of liberalisation and privatisations"", along with changing attitudes towards wealth – meaning it’s no longer considered “tacky to talk about money"".

But the biggest boost, Monier says, was in 2003 when a change in law allowed individuals and companies to deduct a percentage of their donations from their tax bill: 66 percent for individuals and 60 percent for companies on donations of up to 5,000 euros or the equivalent of five percent of annual turnover.

“The 2003 Aillagon law was very important,” says Monier. ""It’s easier to make donations with this tax déduction.”

Easier, and for big donors, very profitable. France’s luxury group LVMH made close to 45 billion euros in 2020: a potential tax break of 2.25 billion euros.

The people’s money

The linking of philanthropy to tax breaks has cast big philanthropy in a negative light. Lucas Chancel, an economist specialising in inequality, says the donation system amounts to the “privatisation of income tax”.

That sentiment came to the fore following the Notre-Dame fire in April 2019, when close to 900 million euros was pledged within a few days. The millionaire owners of L’Oreal, Kering, LVMH and others made very public donations of between 100 to 200 million euros each.

While the government, strapped for cash, lauded their generosity, others saw it as a cunning transfer of taxpayer’s money.

“When a big donor gives money, for example to Notre-Dame, the tax deduction is the people’s money and some people don’t agree with that,” Monier explains.

The backlash was considerable, not least because the anti-austerity, anti-government Yellow Vest movement was still in full swing and the issue of increasing social inequality was headline news.

“It was a moment – and that’s still the case today – when there was a huge gap between elites and the people of France, and there was a lot of poverty,” Monier says.

“People saw a lot of money being given to Notre-Dame, while there were also homeless and unemployed people. They were thinking: ‘is this just?’”

Toxic debate

That sense of injustice remains in some parts of the population, and the media tends to fan the flames.

“They only talk about big donors and scandals, whereas philanthropy is way more complex and diverse,” says Monier, referring to both small donors and France's myriad volunteers who donate their time.

And yet the focus remains on the super rich.

“Some people who are really against philanthropy think it’s just rich people giving money to get a good reputation, good image and tax deductions,” Monier says, adding that not everyone sees it that way.

“We shouldn’t think about philanthropy as a dichotomy because there are also good aspects.”

Among the positives, she cites greater flexibility and innovation and the fact private donors can commit to the long term, whereas politicians are limited by their terms in office.

There are also concerns in France that big philanthropy allows companies to side-step democracy and to buy power to influence public policy.

The case of the US-based Gates Foundation, whose multi-billion donations are dictating vaccination campaigns in many under-developed countries, is just one recent example.

“French Sociologist Pierre Bourdieu said philanthropy is an exchange between economic and symbolic capital, so you give money and you get recognition,” Monier, who recently co-authored a book on philanthropy and democracy, explains.

Here in France, a number of American philanthropists are making big donations to French culture in particular, “looking for recognition, but also for power”, she adds.

For the moment, the French system limits the power philanthropists can obtain through their gifts. Neither is it standard practice for big cultural donors to get rooms in museums named after them. Though, says Monier, that is starting to change.

Legion of honour

While big donors may not get much power, they can get a lot of prestige.

The Americans were the largest of the foreign donors to the Notre-Dame restoration fund, which may or may not earn them a front row pew when Mass is finally held. But there are other enticing rewards.

“What is very interesting and specific to France is that, when you give large amounts of money, you can get a decoration: the legion of honour,"" says Monier.

""I met some people who wanted to give to French institutions just to get the decoration ... It’s a very important incentive for Americans because they don’t have the legion of honour in the US.”

Other rewards can include an invitation to dine at the Elysée Palace or Assemblée Nationale. The Ministry of Culture also offers silver and gold donor medals.

“The French still want the state to play a major role in funding because they are afraid that privatisation will lower expectations and also bring a lot of competition between institutions,” says Monier.

“But the state has less and less money, and with the Covid crisis it’s even worse.”

Foreign philanthropy, it appears, is set to grow – if France can keep on minting the medals.

'En Route': a bio-concrete that is sustainable and strengthens over time - STIRworld,"Mon, 10 May 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN0aXJ3b3JsZC5jb20vc2VlLWZlYXR1cmVzLWVuLXJvdXRlLWEtYmlvLWNvbmNyZXRlLXRoYXQtaXMtc3VzdGFpbmFibGUtYW5kLXN0cmVuZ3RoZW5zLW92ZXItdGltZdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"In a world that is still learning the true impact of widespread ecological changes, we are constantly confronted with the consequences of extreme human intervention. We have to now deal with altering biospheres on a variety of different levels. One of these levels is the rising concern of invasive species that are altering habitats and causing ecological and environmental damage. There are growing efforts across farmlands and various landscapes to curtail the effects of these introduced species on the indigenous environment. In the UK, both Japanese Knotweed and the American Signal Crayfish have been at the centre of widespread removable effort. Designer Brigitte Kock and architect Irene Roca Moracia have experimented with a strategy to utilise the by-products of this removal drive to create a range of new bio-concrete tiles. By creating scalable material processes, this innovative new material adds a monetary value to the removal efforts, in order to facilitate the restoration of the natural biodiversity.

The duo speaks with STIR about their experiment and collection, called En Route.

02 mins watch A brief introduction to the En Route collection Video: A Maison/0 graduate project, commissioned by LVMH for LVMH Climate Week 2020

Devanshi Shah (DS): I am curious about the title of your collection, En Route. Please tell us how did you select the name.

Brigitte Kock (BK) and Irene Roca Moracia (IRM): It’s a collection made with the biomaterial of ‘travelling species’, albeit the invasive species have usually been brought by humans initially, they come from far and are spreading wildly in the UK.

DS: What inspired you to use waste from invasive species treatments as one of your raw materials?

BK and IRM: Just before we started the project, Brigitte saw a fish she never thought to see in real life, one that she had only seen in her favourite children's book on deep sea creatures. Whilst trying to find the English term, the Lionfish went from ‘mythical’ to ‘so-overly-abundant-it’s-destroying-the-endemic-species’ in a matter of minutes. The experience left quite the impression, and after sharing the story we made the decision, very early in the project, that we wanted to create a material that had a bigger positive impact – a regenerative material. Of course, working with exotically sourced waste would defeat the purpose of the project, so we instead looked at local invasive species harming the UK environment, since we are both located in London. We soon found out that the UK government spends about £2 billion annually to manage invasive species, roughly £1.6 billion of which goes to the removal of Japanese knotweed alone!

DS: Your project specifies three materials you experimented with, namely concrete, stone and glass. Could you tell us a little bit more about how each one works?

BK and IRM: We started looking into how to incorporate the by-products originated from the removal of the two invasive species into the creation process of an architectural material. We started off by making many different samples of 10x10cm, trying different methods like indeed, making glass, creating stone through compression and water bathing. In the end the samples using ancient Roman concrete techniques worked best, so we continued to make the collection with that method.

The concrete-like material is made from a mix of wood ash and powdered crayfish shells Image: A Maison/0 graduate project, commissioned by LVMH for LVMH Climate Week 2020

DS: You reference using ancient Roman techniques, could you explain that in detail?

BK and IRM: There is no clear recipe that has survived over time but a principle with certain variations according to the use or location of the Roman structures built. At present, there is no way of ascertaining what water/cement ratios the Romans used. Romans used volcanic ash or wood ash as binder in their concrete constructions. We use Japanese knotweed ash and root powder. Their aggregates tended to be much bigger than what we normally use now, they added broken bricks and rocks to the mix, here we use American Signal Crayfish shells. We have followed their principles and created a bio-concrete with different recipes variations. We have played with the ratios to obtain really strong results.

These bio concrete tiles get stronger with time Image: A Maison/0 graduate project, commissioned by LVMH for LVMH Climate Week 2020

The final colour and textures depend on curing times and aggregates chemical reactions with the binder and the water. This part is really close to what Romans did — they knew how to incorporate different elements to the curing process to obtain different results, for example concrete structures that can resist the corrosion caused by sea water. We have submerged Roman structures that have survived. Our modern concrete can’t perform at that level, it deteriorates rapidly in saltwater and over time. Just like the aggregate, our binders have an organic origin, as much of the sands and rocks the Romans used or modern cement, we can’t forget that limestone often contains fossils. So, our bio cement is our own interpretation of what we could achieve following the Roman principles of concrete production.

DS: Have you had the opportunity to test the usability of this product? What potential uses do you foresee?

BK and IRM: In luxurious interiors it would be great if this could replace less sustainable and non-regenerative materials, like concrete or limestone. Having an alternative to the current unsustainable Portland cement can completely change the environmental impact that construction has. A bio-concrete like this one could be used for any kind of finish at the beginning without compromising structural elements until it is properly tested and controlled. But it could be used for many things because we are able to cast it into shape - from tiles to furniture. Since it can be poured into any shape, we would like to try to use the material to create furniture. We would like to experiment with the shapes and thicknesses to understand how the material can work and furniture is a great field to do that without compromising anyone’s safety.

The duo hopes to test the strength of the material to consider other applications of this new technology Image: A Maison/0 graduate project, commissioned by LVMH for LVMH Climate Week 2020

DS: How does this collaboration feed into both your individual practices? Is there an overlap between your individual practice and this project?

BK: My practice revolves around 3D-printing of textile and parametric pattern drafting. Ultimately, I am looking into how we would be able to print our entire wardrobe. Since the current plastic filaments don’t really have the soft feel silk or wool do, I am interested in researching and creating innovative materials. During my MA Material Futures at Central Saint Martins, I was inspired by Carole Collet and Michael Pawlyn to start thinking beyond sustainability. This project has been a great opportunity to combine regenerative design and material innovation.

The duo sees the product as a new luxurious material for interiors that can potentially replace concrete Image: A Maison/0 graduate project, commissioned by LVMH for LVMH Climate Week 2020

IRM: I am an architect and design researcher working with spaces generated by the overproduction crisis. I question the production and consumption of architecture in European countries, from the point of view of sustainability and social inclusion. For over two years at Central Saint Martins, I researched on how these systems of production work. I presented a furniture collection that reintegrates discharged construction materials with a functional purpose. I believe that the scale in which we play with furniture pieces, or in this case with materials, in interiors allows us to test complex ideas around sustainability and social issues in a faster and more dynamic way than architecture. This material is the first step towards regenerative architecture and product design.

DS: Could you share your personal insight or anecdote about the process of creating this collection?

BK and IRM: This project happened during lockdown, so we had to work in Brigitte’s kitchen. As our material samples had to dry in the living room/kitchen, the humidity levels were impossible to control (which during the first 36 hours of the curing process should be stable), we had to build a drying rack outside the apartment with a sign that said ‘Drying Artwork – Don’t touch!’. It’s great to see that there is no need for fancy workshops or tools when you really put your mind to it, inconvenient for sure, but creativity solves most of the ‘problems’ we had encountered.

This project was developed as part of LVMH Material Innovation: A Maison/0 project with design and architecture graduates from Central Saint Martins UAL. Project led by Professor Carole Collet, Director of Maison/0, the Central Saint Martins LVMH Sustainable Innovation Programme.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9982719421386719}",neutral,0.9982719421386719,0

According to Forbes, Arnault, who is the owner of Louis Vuitton Moet Hennessy (LVMH) has a net worth of USD 186.2 billion.

French businessman Bernard Arnault has become the richest man in the world beating Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos. According to Forbes, Arnault, who is the owner of Louis Vuitton Moet Hennessy (LVMH) has a net worth of USD 186.2 billion. It is to be noted that LVMH is world’s leading fashion luxury goods company.

Forbes said that USD 538 million was spent by Arnault in recent months in order to acquire shares of his own French label brand controlled by him and his family. Earlier, Arnault had raced ahead of world’s second richest person and Tesla owner Elon Musk, after reporting a first quarter revenue of GBP 14 billion in 2021.

In January 2021, LVMH acquired America’s largest jewellery maker Tiffany & Co. for USD 15.8 million.

In 2020, LVMH recorded a revenue of GBP 44.7 billion as it sales fell by 17%. The fashion luxury brand also reported a fall in organic revenue by 16% in 2020, as compared to 2019.

Arnault oversees an empire of 70 brands including Louis Vuitton, Sephora, Tiffany & Co, Stella McCartney, Gucci, Christian Dior, Givenchy. These brands are independently managed and operated under the LVMH umbrella.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999991655349731}",neutral,0.9999991655349731,0
Moet’s bubbly Chandon spritz aperitif takes on Aperol - Buenos Aires Times,"Thu, 13 May 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJhdGltZXMuY29tLmFyL25ld3MvY3VsdHVyZS9tb2V0cy1idWJibHktY2hhbmRvbi1zcHJpdHotYXBlcml0aWYtdGFrZXMtb24tYXBlcm9sLnBodG1s0gFmaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmF0aW1lcy5jb20uYXIvbmV3cy9hbXAvY3VsdHVyZS9tb2V0cy1idWJibHktY2hhbmRvbi1zcHJpdHotYXBlcml0aWYtdGFrZXMtb24tYXBlcm9sLnBodG1s?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Moët Hennessy is betting on a new bubbly for those ready to socialise and sip aperitifs on sunny terraces as lockdown restrictions ease.

The drinks maker – part of luxury group LVMH – is launching Chandon Garden Spritz, a sparkling wine made in Argentina that’s set to compete with other brands such as Aperol Spritz.

“We want to make this the drink of the return to the terraces,” Philippe Schaus, chief executive officer of Moët Hennessy, said in an interview. “We do expect a very strong recovery of demand,” he added, as the savings accumulated during lockdowns will be partly spent in restaurants and bars.

“Whenever we reopen, people are just desperate to get out to the terraces,” he said.

Chandon Garden Spritz launched in Europe and the United States on Wednesday.

The pandemic took a toll on drinks consumption last year as celebrations were postponed or cancelled and bars and restaurants were shut for extended periods. Shipments of Champagne slumped 18 percent to 244 million bottles, the lowest since 1993, according to a group representing French producers.

Sales at the wines and spirits division of LVMH – which includes Moët & Chandon – fell 14 percent to 4.76 billion euros (US$5.75 billion) in 2020, but have rebounded in the first quarter of this year. Schaus said his business has benefited as consumers stuck at home started buying better quality and higher-priced wines.

France is gradually exiting its third lockdown. The terraces of cafes and bistros will open on May 19, while indoor eating and drinking with limited capacity is scheduled to resume on June 9. Bars and restaurants in the United Kingdom opened with outdoor seating last month and are set to resume indoor service on May 17.

While demand for most of Moët Hennessy’s drinks has bounced back, the market for vodka remains weaker because it’s often served in nightclubs, which have yet to reopen in many places, Schaus said.

A 75-centilitre bottle of Chandon Garden Spritz sells for 19.90 euros at LVMH’s Grande Epicerie in Paris, cheaper than a bottle of the group’s Ruinart Champagne, which starts at 44.50 euros.

Garden Spritz mixes Argentine sparkling wine with an orange bitter liqueur. It took Chandon four years and 64 trials to create the drink, said Sibylle Scherer, president of Chandon.

Parts of France suffered a severe cold snap last month that followed a warm spell, sending a shudder through wine-producing regions and forcing workers out into the vineyards with anti-frost candles to prevent lasting damage. The abrupt swing in April temperatures was the most drastic since 1947, weather forecaster Meteo France said.

Schaus, however, said the production of Champagne was little affected by the cold, unlike producers of Bordeaux.

The brands owned by Moët Hennessy typically operate with a system of individual reserves for Champagne and cognac production that can be tapped to compensate for potential deficits.

Moët Hennessy made headlines earlier this year when it announced the purchase of half of Jay-Z’s Champagne brand, Armand de Brignac, for an undisclosed sum.

Schaus said stars can bring a “lot of energy and different perspectives,” to the market, adding that he expects more celebrity-endorsed drinks in the future.

The idea is: let’s see if we can do something together, if that’s the case than by all means”, said the president of the Tod’s Group during the Fashion and Sustainability event organized by RCS Academy and Corriere della Sera. The entrepreneur also commented the arrival of Chiara Ferragni on the Board: “Nothing commercial”.

Della Valle spreads clues

“There is a long friendship with LVMH. This was just a way to re-confirm that we want to do something together. It’s been 21 years since I first gave a few shares to Bernard (Arnault) before our IPO. Today’s operation was a symbolic one. The idea is: let’s see if we can do something together, if that’s the case than by all means”. Della Valle chooses to comment the operation that brought LVMH to invest over 74 million euro in Tod’s with the mentioned words.

The French group now owns 10% of the Group’s shares. The move had, of course, once again lit a fire under the rumors that Tod’s was a “designated prey” of the French giant. Della Valle has always quashed any such rumors regarding the sale. Now though, he spreads clues regarding the near future. What does he want to do then, with his friend Mr. Arnault?”.

Nothing commercial

Mr. Della Valle also commented the entrance of Chiara Ferragni in Tod’s BoD. “We have always had a type of communication that focused on clients above 30 years of age. Chiara’s entrance has nothing to do with the commercial side.We needed it to bring her in for new ideas regarding operations tied to solidarity, sustainability and welfare. As well as to speak to individuals under 30. To gain advices and give them a sign that we also want to take care of them. The operation has solely this purpose”.

LVMH Reveals Chandon Rebrand To Celebrate The Sparkling Wine's Global Network - Boss Hunting,"Mon, 17 May 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJvc3NodW50aW5nLmNvbS5hdS9saWZlc3R5bGUvZHJpbmsvY2hhbmRvbi1yZWJyYW5kL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Chandon has long been the sparkling wine empire on which the sun never sets, with the LVMH-owned Maison establishing an extensive network of wineries across the globe – Argentina, California, Brazil, China, India, Australia – to solidify its reputation for reliability. Consistency is clearly a pillar for the 62-year-old company, which why its surprising that a Chandon rebrand has seemingly landed out of nowhere. For the first time in Chandon’s glamorous history, the brand has received a new visual identity.

Why? Let’s unpack.

There are few names in the fine wine business, which isn’t exactly known for changes to iconic branding, as formidable as Chandon and its French sibling Moët. Both separately and together, they have built an image which almost defines the very idea of fine wine. Chandon changing that image seems to reflect the company’s desire to better communicate just how global the brand is, reiterating how its not just tethered to one wine-making region but rather is a true child of globalisation.

The Chandon rebrand now pays tribute to this reach. A bold vertical stripe runs the length of the bottle, while a new seven-pointed star sits at the top. Each point of this star, Chandon has said, represents the six renowned wineries spread across the countries mentioned above. The seventh tip is to represent a “pioneering spirit” which “leads the way” for Chandon’s ongoing evolution.

This new dynamic look is reportedly a permanent change for Chandon, unlike the more recent design collaboration between Moët and Japanese fashion house AMBUSH which facelifted the iconic cuvee in a strictly limited-edition capacity. Not only is it equally eye-catching, currently seen on Chandon Brut Classic and Rose vintages, but the rebranding is better connected to Chandon’s major point of distinction.

“The pioneering spirit has been embedded with the Chandon DNA since the birth of our Argentinian winery in 1959,” said VP Anne Sophie Stock.

“Chandon continues to discover new methods and terroirs to keep our sparkling wines at the top of the category – and this new visual identity is a representation of that. As a connection of global wineries, we are dedicated to this time-honored craft worldwide.”

The new design was crafted in-house, revising the Chandon logo and incorporating the shooting star on the foil to help the hot-stamped logo really pop. Importantly, nothing inside the actual bottle has changed. Although the recent redesign closely aligns with the release of the new Chandon Garden Spritz, an obvious play for the thriving aperitifs market with a spritz-like sparkling wine that’s been blended with bitter-orange liqueur. The rather obvious nod to the Argentinean love of bitter flavours should be a monster competitor to Campari Group’s Aperol, and seems to be a substantial change from Chandon S, which similarly blends Chandon sparkling with hand crafted orange bitters.

“Qualitative research indicates that this new package positions Chandon as a more premium choice than our previous package,” said Chandon Director of Market, Michael Stedman.

“The quality of the wine inside the bottle remains high, evidenced by third party endorsements and high scores. With this clean look on high quality, textured materials, we hope the visual cues on the outside of the bottle will translate into purchase.”

Chandon has itself had a presence in Australia for the past 35 years, with its local footprint stemming from the Domaine Chandon in the Chardonnay-rich region of the Yarra Valley. As such, the Chandon rebrand has already hit the country and is currently available on the Maison’s most well-regarded releases.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.8935293555259705}",neutral,0.8935293555259705,0

Louis Vuitton owner Bernard Arnault has displaced Jeff Bezos as the world’s richest man. Arnault along with his family is now worth $186.3 billion, just ahead of Bezos who’s worth $186 billion. This is the first time that Arnault, 71, has become the richest man in the world. Elon Musk is currently ranked number three on the list.

Bernard Arnault has had an extraordinary year. In March 2020, he was worth just $76 billion, but has added more than a 100 billion dollars to his wealth over the last 15 months. His company, LMVH, had seen its stock price nearly double over the last year, and has caused his personal wealth to balloon as well. LMVH now has a market cap of $320 billion.

LVHM oversees an empire of 70 brands including Louis Vuitton, Sephora, Stella McCartney, Gucci, Christian Dior, Givenchy and others, which are independently managed and operated under the LVMH umbrella. In January this year, LVMH had also acquired America’s largest jewellery maker Tiffany & Co. LVHM is the largest luxury products comapny in the world.

Arnault has had an remarkable journey to becoming the world’s richest man. He was born in 1949 in France, and studied engineering in college. He then took over his father’s construction business, grew it manifold, and eventually started focusing on real estate. With $15 million of his own money, he ended up purchasing a bankrupt textile company that owned the fashion house of Christian Dior, which marked his foray into fashion. In 1987, Arnault invested in LVMH, and had taken control of the company by 1990. He then brought a slew of fashion companies into the LVMH fold, including Christian Lacroix, Givenchy, and Kenzo; the leather goods companies Loewe, Céline, and Berluti; the jeweler Fred Joailler; the DFS group (the world’s biggest duty-free chain); and the beauty retailer Sephora.

Arnault is thought responsible for revitalizing French couture, and has been dubbed the “Pope of Fashion”. Apart from LVMH, he has a slew of other investments, including in French supermarket Carrefour, and had also invested in Netflix all the way back in 1999. Arnault is also an art collector, and owns works by Picasso, Henry Moore, and Andy Warhol.

The twenty first century was thought to be the digital age, with tech titans like Bill Gates and Jeff Bezos dominating the rich lists. But Bernard Arnault ascension to the top shows that no matter how much tech takes over our daily lives, clothing never really goes out of fashion.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999911785125732}",neutral,0.9999911785125732,0

According to Forbes, LVMH CEO Arnault had claimed the title of the richest man on the planet with a net worth of USD 186.3 billion.

Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos has once again claimed the position of the world's richest person dethroning Bernard Arnault, Chief Executive Officer of French luxury conglomerate LVMH. It is to be noted that Arnault became the world's richest person on Monday but he remained on the top position only for a day.

According to Forbes, Arnault had claimed the title of the richest man on the planet with a net worth of USD 186.3 billion. According to Forbes' Real Time Billionaire rankings on Monday, Arnault ended the day with a net wroth of USD 186.3 billion, while Bezos net worth was USD 186 billion. Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk was at third place with USD 147.3 billion.

But things changed on Tuesday as net worth jumped by USD 313 million to USD 189.2 billion, thereby overtaking Arnault who stood at 189.1 billion, an increase of USD 251 million. Musk with a net worth of USD 155.1 billion was at the third place.

Forbes said that USD 538 million was spent by Arnault in recent months in order to acquire shares of his own French label brand controlled by him and his family.

The increase sees Arnault’s personal stake up by more than £424million and valuing LVMH at £226bn, according to Forbes.

This put Arnault’s total net worth at £131.7bn, placing him above Amazon boss Jeff Bezos who is said to be worth £131.4bn, according to the publication.

Arnault only recently pushed Elon Musk, the Tesla boss, down to third place as the company’s shares plunged.

Musk is thought to be worth £104.1bn.

With Arnault, Bezos and Musk’s wealth all tied to stock holdings it means their wealth fluctuates on the changes in the stock market.

In the past 14 months Arnault has seen his fortune increase by more than £77.7m thanks to his company which owns a string of luxury goods brands including Fendi, Christian Dior and Givenchy.

It also acquired Tiffany & Co in January for £11.2m with Arnault promoting his son to head up the US jeweller’s products and communication.

In March last year Arnault was said to have a fortune of £53.7bn. with his firm seemingly largely unaffected by the Covid pandemic.

Musk, 49, saw his fortune plummet by £2.23bn last week to £113.5bn, according to the Bloomberg Billionaire’s Index.

Alexandre Arnault, 29, left his role as boss of Rimowa, which is also owned by LVMH, to become executive president of product and communication at Tiffany’s , working under the chairman and CEO Michael Burke.

Bernard Arnault has given senior LVMH posts to four of his oldest children.

His fifth child, son Jean, 23, is still a student.

Only daughter Delphine, 46, is director and executive vice president of Louis Vuitton; eldest son Antoine, 43, who married Russian model Natalia Vodianova last year, is CEO of Berluti and oversees image, communications and the environment for LVMH; and third son Frédéric, 26, is CEO of Tag Heuer.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.999983549118042}",neutral,0.999983549118042,0

Elon's wealth declined as Tesla's stock dropped by 2.2 per cent. Musk's wealth is very closely linked with the electric car maker's valuation. In 2020, Tesla became the most valuable carmaker.

Musk's fortune is now worth $160.6 billion, only beat by Jeff Bezos, the Amazon founder and Bernard Arnault of LVMH. Chances are that Musk will likely overtake Arnault again considering his bets in Dogecoin, Tesla and SpaceX.

Musk has lost $9.1 billion 2021 based on fluctuating valuations of his companies

The drop also follows bitcoin tumbling 15 per cent in value after Musk's statement on Twitter where he claimed that Tesla would stop accepting the currency.

Musk also indicated that he would sell his Bitcoin holdings but he clarified that his company had not done so. Tesla's stock has generally been surging -- increased more than 750 per cent but its stocks have started to drop because of the global semiconductor shortage which is expected to spill over to 2023.

In 2021, Musk's fortune has dropped by $9.1 billion while the 72-year-old Arnault has seen his fortune increase the most by $47 billion as the sales of LVMH group's luxury items surge in China and other parts of Asia.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9763151407241821}",neutral,0.9763151407241821,0

What brands does LVMH own?

The luxury goods retailer has come a long way since Arnault became a major shareholder of the company in 1989. To date, the LVMH portfolio includes 70 brands. Most of the brands are high-end luxury retail companies.

Many of the LVMH brands are most synonymous with the lifestyles of the rich and famous, including Louis Vuitton, Marc Jacobs, Sephora, Givenchy, Guerlain, Fendi, Donna Karen, and De Beers.

In 2017, LVMH bought fashion brand Christian Dior for $13.1 billion.

In January, the company purchased Tiffany & Co. for $15.8 million, which was one of the largest deals in the history of luxury retail. The acquisition was meant to “deeply transform” LVMH’s watches and jewelry division, which already included De Beers, Tag Heuer, and Bulgari.

“We are committed to supporting Tiffany, a brand that is synonymous with love and whose Blue Box is revered around the world,” Arnault said in a company press release. “We are optimistic about Tiffany’s ability to accelerate its growth, innovate and remain at the forefront of our discerning customers’ most cherished life achievements and memories.”

Arnault’s stake in the company helped boost him in November 2020 to the world’s second-richest person on Forbes’ Real-Time Billionaires List.

LVMH's first-quarter earning beat the projections.

As the world starts to gradually come out of the COVID-19 pandemic, consumers must be spending all of their saved-up vacation money on $39,000 Louis Vuitton bags. LVMH reported record revenues of over $17.1 billion in the first quarter of 2021—an increase of 32 percent over 2020.

LVMH’s fashion and leather goods business led the company’s revenue growth with a 52 percent jump in revenue over 2020.

Its wine and spirits brands, like Hennessy and Moët & Chandon, also saw record growth in the first quarter, up 36 percent over 2020.

The only decline in revenue was in LVMH’s selective retailing group, which is its retail businesses targeted for international travelers and beauty retailer Sephora. The revenue in this group declined 5 percent mainly due to the worldwide travel shutdown amid the COVID-19 pandemic.

Bernard Arnault Just Became Second-Richest Person In The World And Is On Pace To Become #1 - Celebrity Net Worth,"Tue, 18 May 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jZWxlYnJpdHluZXR3b3J0aC5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvYmlsbGlvbmFpcmUtbmV3cy9iZXJuYXJkLWFybmF1bHQtanVzdC1iZWNhbWUtc2Vjb25kLXJpY2hlc3QtcGVyc29uLWluLXRoZS13b3JsZC1hbmQtaXMtb24tcGFjZS10by1iZWNvbWUtMS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Bernard Arnault Just Became Second-Richest Person In The World And Is On Pace To Become #1

As I type this article, French billionaire Bernard Arnault is officially the second-richest person on the planet. Bernard has never ranked this high on our list of the richest people in the world. It's the first time since at least 2016 that someone other than Bill Gates, Elon Musk or Jeff Bezos has held the #2 slot.

Bernard took second place today after his $162 billion net worth topped Elon Musk's $161 billion net worth.

Here's how the top 4 stands right now:

Elon's Fortunes Fade

If you'll recall, Elon Musk had an absolutely stunning net worth gain in 2020. On January 1, 2020, Elon's net worth was $28 billion. He ended 2020 with a net worth of $170 billion.

His net worth continued to explode into the first month of 2021. On January 6, 2021, Elon's $195 billion topped Jeff Bezos, allowing the Tesla/SpaceX tycoon to claim the title of richest person in the world for the first time. He held that title for a few weeks as his net worth topped off at $210 billion.

The last few weeks have been less kind to Elon. His fortune has faded thanks largely to a lagging Tesla stock price.

Tesla's 52 week high of $900 was achieved in late January. On Tuesday Tesla shares closed at $577. That's a 35% drop, peak to trough, in 3.5 months.

With a current net worth of $161 billion, Elon Musk is now $50 billion off his all-time peak.

Bernard's Fortunes Flame

To be clear, Bernard taking the #2 spot wasn't exclusively driven by Elon's fading fortunes.

A year ago, the stock price of Bernard's luxury goods company LVMH was $77. On Tuesday LVMH closed at $151.

Bernard's net worth has increased $47 billion since January 1. No one on earth has gained as much in the same period.

Arnault and his immediate family own more than 47% of LVMH, which is the world's largest maker of luxury goods. The company currently has a market cap of $382 billion.

LVMH is made up of roughly 70 brands, notably Louis Vuitton, Christian Dior, Moët Hennessey, and Dom Perignon.

Could Bernard Top Jeff Bezos?

If you had asked the average person that question a few weeks ago, they probably would have replied, ""Who on earth is Bernard Arnault?"". Today I think the answer is YES, I definitely can foresee a day in the near future when Bernard Arnault tops Jeff Bezos to become the richest person in the world.

Jeff's net worth certainly hasn't been crashing in recent months, but it's has been cooling off. Jeff's fortune is down around $3 billion from where it sat on January 1. For most of 2021 Jeff Bezos' net worth as fluctuated between $185 and $190 billion.

Here's one way to analyze the question –

Amazon's stock exploded as everyone was trapped at home in 2020 ordering absolutely everything off Amazon. How does Amazon revenue perform as people start getting back out in the world? And as the global economy continues to recover and we enter the second coming of the roaring 20s, perhaps people will load up on booze and luxury goods sold by LVMH?

CAVEAT: I own some Amazon stock in a retirement account, so selfishly I hope that's NOT what happens. It's just a hypothetical from a non financial expert.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999206066131592}",neutral,0.9999206066131592,0
