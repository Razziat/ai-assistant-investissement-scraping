'The business of creating desire': An interview with the CEO of LVMH Fashion Group - McKinsey,"Sun, 01 Jun 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5tY2tpbnNleS5jb20vaW5kdXN0cmllcy9yZXRhaWwvb3VyLWluc2lnaHRzL3RoZS1idXNpbmVzcy1vZi1jcmVhdGluZy1kZXNpcmUtYW4taW50ZXJ2aWV3LXdpdGgtdGhlLWNlby1vZi1sdm1oLWZhc2hpb24tZ3JvdXDSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Makers of luxury goods grapple with many of the same challenges as other companies in the consumer-products and retail sectors: keeping customers happy, offering the right products through the right channels, and finding and nurturing the best talent. LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, the multinational conglomerate that owns some of the world’s most successful luxury brands, is no exception. Pierre-Yves Roussel knows this well. As chairman and CEO of the LVMH Fashion Group, he oversees a growing stable of brands including Céline, Givenchy, Kenzo, Loewe, Marc Jacobs, Donna Karan, Pucci, Nicholas Kirkwood, and J.W. Anderson.

In a recent interview with McKinsey’s Olivier Sibony and Thomas Tochtermann in Paris, Roussel talked about some of the decisions he’s made and what he’s learned since becoming a fashion-industry executive a decade ago.

McKinsey: You were new to the fashion world when you first went to work for LVMH. What surprised you most about the company and the industry?

Pierre-Yves Roussel: When I joined LVMH Group, I knew only what most people knew about it: it has a portfolio of prestigious brands, some of them had been around for 150 or even 200 years, it’s a global company, and so on. But what struck me is how central creativity and innovation are to everything we do. For [LVMH chairman and CEO] Bernard Arnault, creativity is the lifeblood of what we do across the entire organization, whether it’s in the traditional fashion houses that are known for their craftsmanship, or in wine and spirits, watches and jewelry, or fragrance. It doesn’t mean we’re frantically changing our products all the time—we have iconic products that have been in our stores for decades—but we apply creativity to always make them relevant. We create special versions, special colors, small adjustments that consumers might not even notice but that are actually quite innovative.

We know that if we stop being creative and innovative, it’s all over—even for the powerful fashion houses that have been here for years—because, in a way, we are in the business of creating desire and happiness. Most of our customers are people who feel they have worked hard and want to treat themselves well, they want to buy something they really enjoy, they want to be seduced. So we have to constantly surprise our customers. We have to come up with exceptional products that make them say, “Wow, this is new, it’s interesting, it’s beautiful. I really want it.” If we don’t do that, they will not come to our stores.

McKinsey: How do you do it? How does a large company like LVMH stay innovative and creative?

Pierre-Yves Roussel: It starts with having a real culture of creativity. We hire people who are, broadly speaking, interested in creativity. They don’t necessarily have to be into fashion. And some people are not creative themselves, but they are fundamentally people who are very curious and open minded, and who like to discover new things.

Bernard Arnault talks about the LVMH management team as people who are “inspired”—meaning they are inspired by the brands. They are inspired and genuinely interested in the work that the creative team does. The creative people we work with—the designers, architects, photographers, winemakers, and perfumers, or “nez”—have to be surrounded by people who look at what they do in a positive way.

Of course, we also have creativity in our ateliers. Whenever we bring in a new designer, our artisans and craftsmen are asked to implement a new vision. But if the designer is respectful of the craftsmanship—and the great designers always are—the craftsmen are thrilled, because they have a passion for learning and for trying new ways of doing things. When a new designer comes in, they get to really challenge themselves and push their skills to a new level.

McKinsey: Where do you find these creative, innovative people?

Pierre-Yves Roussel: We find them through multiple sources. Our talent scouting also involves the creative director of each brand, because great creative leaders have lots of connections and are usually well known, and everybody wants to work with them. A lot of talented designers want to work with [Céline’s creative director] Phoebe Philo or [Givenchy’s creative director] Riccardo Tisci or Marc Jacobs. They are like magnets. People want to work with the best—that’s as true in the creative fields as it is in business.

We also work with design schools. We have many trainees. And many young designers who have their own brands also collaborate with us. So, we have different sources of talent. Just like creativity is a nonlinear process, the recruitment of creative people is a nonlinear process. This year, [Louis Vuitton executive vice president] Delphine Arnault launched, with incredible success, the LVMH Fashion Prize, to help new emerging creative talent from all over the world.

McKinsey: You have more than 200 designers working on a variety of LVMH brands. How do you establish each brand’s unique identity?

Pierre-Yves Roussel: First of all, each fashion house is located in a different place—usually a place that ties into its history. We didn’t relocate them all to one big building on Avenue Montaigne in Paris! For example, Givenchy is still in its historic building on Avenue George V; Pucci is in its historic palazzo in Florence. Being in different places helps them keep their brand identity.

We “frame” each brand by defining what we call its DNA. We’ve been popularizing this concept of DNA, which I think is sometimes misunderstood; it gives the impression of a scientific and very analytical process. But it doesn’t happen like that. I think it’s more about capturing the essence and personality of the brand, the emotion, the aspects that are not necessarily rational, the intangible things that need to be understood about a brand.

To frame a brand, we start with a few “bricks”: visuals, iconic products, places, and a few words. Those bricks are just the beginning of a journey: we have lots of discussions, we work with our creative teams, they propose a direction and a vision. In my first few years at LVMH, I tried to hire designers who I felt perfectly fit the brand—almost as if I was looking to be reassured about their work. But we found that the ideas they came up with were too obvious, and we ran out of steam quite quickly. So now we are more interested in hiring and having a dialogue with someone who we know will take us in a new direction, beyond the obvious, with a strong vision.

McKinsey: So it’s not just the products that evolve; the brands do so as well.

Pierre-Yves Roussel: Yes. Our brands have been around for a long time, and they are very rich. We use different facets of the brand at different times. We take what resonates in today’s environment. Five years or seven years later, we might emphasize another facet of the brand. If you look at the archives of Dior or Givenchy, you will see how many different expressions a single brand can take over time.

McKinsey: There’s a big debate in the industry about how far you can stretch a brand. Some of your brands have expanded into fragrance and jewelry; a few of your competitors now have hotels and cafés. What’s your strategy for brand extensions?

Pierre-Yves Roussel: I think some brands have more potential for expansion than others. At LVMH we do things organically—we expand when we feel it’s the right time for the brand, when there is a sense of excitement about doing it. So we never feel it is forced, or that we have to do it for business reasons.

I look at brands as books, and we write chapters. Each chapter has to connect to the larger story, but it has to be new and interesting. The Marc Jacobs brand is almost 20 years old. We tried to launch a fragrance ten years ago, but it was too early. The brand hadn’t matured enough. We needed the brand to mature over several collections and seasons, because a fragrance crystallizes a chapter of your brand. We tried again four years ago, and it clicked. It’s a massive success.

McKinsey: Let’s talk about the Internet. How has it changed the fashion industry in general and LVMH’s strategy in particular?

Pierre-Yves Roussel: The Internet has increased the visibility of fashion, but I think the fundamentals of the industry haven’t changed. People have talked about and written about fashion for centuries; now it happens through the Internet and social media, but it’s nothing new. Television, fashion magazines, and other media were already global before the Internet.

What was not global was pricing: consumers couldn’t compare prices, so prices were much higher in Japan than in Europe, for example. Some of that was because of differences in taxes and operating costs among countries, of course, but part of it was due to differences in people’s appetite and willingness to pay for luxury goods. Now there are pretty much no real price differentials—that has been one major impact of the Internet. But otherwise the Internet has just amplified and accelerated what had already been taking place.

McKinsey: But half of luxury consumers research products online before buying. How has that aspect of the Internet affected your marketing strategy?

Pierre-Yves Roussel: The Internet is often a consumer’s first window into our brands, so if someone goes online we want to be sure they are actually experiencing our brand, not a counterfeit store. In the nondigital world, nobody but Céline could put an ad in Vogue claiming to be Céline, but on the Internet you can buy keywords or search terms and post something that pretends to be Céline. We’ve invested a tremendous amount of money in owning and protecting our brands, so when you search for Céline, the first thing we want you to see is our trademarked Céline brand—the real one. Just as important, we make sure that no matter where a visitor goes on our site, they get a consistent experience; the entire site has to reflect what the brand is about.

Then there is the question of whether or not we want to sell on the Internet. People certainly buy very expensive things on the Internet, and we do sell some of our brands there. We even offer some services such as customization and monogramming. But we decided that Céline, for example, would not sell any products on the Internet, either directly or through third parties. There isn’t a single Céline product that you can buy online. We made that decision five years ago, and we’ve stuck to it. We have invested so much in creating the best-quality products that we just want people to experience it. So if some people want to buy a Céline bag at midnight on a Sunday, sorry, they cannot. They have to wait until the store opens on Monday. By the way, this bag—they’re going to keep it for 20 years. So it’s worth the wait.

At the end of the day, we don’t sell service—we sell products. We’re a very physical business. You have to smell a fragrance, and you cannot smell it on the Internet. You cannot try on a pair of shoes or a dress on the Internet; you cannot touch the fabrics.

I don’t know whether the Internet will eventually be 10, 20, 30 percent of sales or more—but for sure, 60 or 70 percent of people are doing research online now. So it’s a major window into our brands, and that’s the way we are treating it.

McKinsey: Has the Internet affected the way you think about your physical store network?

Pierre-Yves Roussel: Our customers do their research on the Internet, so by the time they enter the store, they know the collection very well—sizes, colors, everything. They also know what our competitors offer. That means our in-store staff has to be extremely well trained; they have to know everything about our products and our competitors’ products.

The job of the store is to magnify the product and create the most enjoyable experience for the consumer. That’s the essence of retail. It’s not about having a luxury store that has marble everywhere and looks expensive; that’s not the point. People don’t come to buy the store—they come to buy the product. And some people will be in the store for three hours and try on 15 pairs of shoes, while others just want to come in, buy something, and get out. We have to be totally flexible, so that both types of consumers can feel they are in a great environment. We’re obsessed with giving people the best in-store experience.

McKinsey: Aside from this obsession with the customer experience, what do you think are other factors that have led to LVMH’s growth and longevity?

Pierre-Yves Roussel: Bernard Arnault is a unique combination of an incredible entrepreneur who is willing to take risks and an amazing leader with exceptional intuition for all the things we’ve just talked about. He has surrounded himself with people who are experienced, independent, and opinionated, and he gives them full freedom, but he is also able to keep things under tight control. I think our organizational structure is perfectly suited to our industry. We’re able to adjust amazingly fast because we’re not run by consensus; we never put people around a table and say, “Let’s all agree on this or that.” So we can be very agile.

Agility makes a big difference in a fast-changing business. Take travel retail: it used to be a Japanese business, and in the span of about seven years, it became an entirely Chinese business. I don’t know any other business where you lose your entire customer base and get a new one in seven or eight years. We look at the facts, we talk about what works and what doesn’t work, we fix what’s not working, and we adjust quickly. Whatever happens, we’re able to adjust fast.

McKinsey: On a personal level, what motivates you? What are your own sources of inspiration?

Pierre-Yves Roussel: Honestly, I get inspired by coming to the office every day. I work with many brands, and the diversity of projects and people is extremely interesting. I am as passionate about exploring and discovering what our creative people are doing as I am about making a business out of it.

My role involves creative problem solving. The creative people come to me with their vision, and I problem solve with our management teams to figure out whether it fits with what we want to do, whether it’s the right time, and how to make it happen. And we’re constantly reorganizing and restructuring our teams. So there’s the excitement of daily change, but there’s also the fulfilling sense of building something for the very long term—something that will last."
"LVMH executive, former PM Balladur associates in court on arms-sale corruption charges - RFI English","Fri, 13 Jun 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJmaS5mci9lbi9hc2lhLXBhY2lmaWMvMjAxNDA2MTMtbHZtaC1leGVjdXRpdmUtZm9ybWVyLXBtLWJhbGxhZHVyLWFzc29jaWF0ZXMtY291cnQtYXJtcy1zYWxlLWNvcnJ1cHRpb24tY2hhcmdl0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"France - Pakistan - Saudi Arabia

A top executive of luxury group LVMH and other associates of former prime minister Edouard Balladur are to face trial in a French court over a long-running saga of alleged corruption linked to arms sales to Pakistan and Saudi Arabia. Some of the accused are close to ex-president Nicolas Sarkozy.

Nicolas Bazire, who is head of LVMH’s development and acquisitions arm as well as sitting on numerous other boards, including that of supermarket operator Carrefour, is to be tried along with five other people in connection with the “Karachi affair”, a case of alleged bribery and the illegal financing Balladur’s unsuccessful bid to become president in 1995.

His co-defendants are:

Thierry Gaubert , a collaborator of former president Nicolas Sarkozy, accused by his ex-wife of bringing cash of dubious origin to France;

, a collaborator of former president Nicolas Sarkozy, accused by his ex-wife of bringing cash of dubious origin to France; Renaud Donnedieu de Vabres , who was culture minister under Sarkozy;

, a Takkedine associate who lives in Switzerland and has not come to France during the inquiry; Dominique Castellan, the former boss of international operations of France’s naval shipyards.

After a three-year investigation in several countries, judges Renaud van Ruymbeke and Roger Le Loire have concluded that 327 million euros were illegally amassed from the

sale of submarines to Pakistan and frigates to Saudi Arabia.

The money is supposed to have been made from “retrocommissions”, a system of payments to supposed facilitators who would keep part of the money for themselves and pay back some in cash to be funnelled into the Balladur account or into individuals’ pockets.

Payments by what was known as the “K network” are believed to have travelled to France via Switzerland, Ireland, Liechtenstein, the British Virgin Islands, the Bahamas or the Cayman Islands.

After winning the 1995 election, Jacques Chirac ordered the K network to be closed down.

Sarkozy was spokesperson of the Balladur campaign.

A separate inquiry is under way to establish whether a 1996 bombing in Karachi, which killed 15 people, including 11 French engineers working on submarines in the city’s port, were ordered by Pakistani officials angry at not receiving payments.

Balladur and former defence minister François Léotard will not appear in court but may yet be summoned to appear before a special court authorised to judge ministers on crimes alleged to have been committed while they were in office.

Luxury Wars: How Hermès Faced Down its Rival - INSEAD Knowledge,"Tue, 10 Jun 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8va25vd2xlZGdlLmluc2VhZC5lZHUvZmFtaWx5LWJ1c2luZXNzL2x1eHVyeS13YXJzLWhvdy1oZXJtZXMtZmFjZWQtZG93bi1pdHMtcml2YWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"“It’s not a financial fight, because we would lose that. It’s a cultural fight” - Patrick Thomas, former CEO Hermès.

It’s fair to say LVMH’s hostile takeover bid for Hermès came out of the blue. In October 2010, Patrick Thomas, the first outsider to manage the family company, was cycling through France’s rural Auvergne region when his LVMH counterpart, Bernard Arnault, called with a short message: LVMH had acquired a 17 percent stake in Hermès and was planning to buy more – a fact that would be announced to the press in two hours. The first thought that went through my mind, Thomas noted later, was that this was no way to do business in France. It was he insists, “ungentlemanly”.

To the majority of the Hermès family Arnault was an unwanted interloper. He was seen as being ruthlessly aggressive, with a formula for success – mixing glitzy advertising and publicity stunts – entirely unsuited to the Hermès culture.

Arnault rejected suggestions that he posed a threat to Hermès’ autonomy and brand, maintaining his only desire was to make the company more profitable. This lure of enhanced personal wealth was seen as a golden carrot for the upcoming sixth generation of the Hermès family. The only way to oppose Arnault, Thomas reasoned, was by presenting a united family front.

Authenticity, a family legacy

Hermès opened its first store in Paris in 1883 specialising in handmade saddles, bridles, and riding paraphernalia. After securing a two-year exclusive European patent on the zipper in the early 1920s the company expanded its product line to include luggage and ready-made clothes. Every item produced was handled by Hermès artisans, and on completion the product was inspected for quality and stamped bearing the artisans name and date.

This pride in craftsmanship continued as France industrialised, with Hermès resisting pressure to mass manufacture, instead establishing partnerships with secondary schools to ensure a reliable supply of artisans trained in the company’s methods.

Instructed in the Hermès credo “that useful be beautiful” family members were put through an apprenticeship in leadership to honour, sustain and develop the family legacy of authenticity and quality without compromise.

Like many luxury players in the 1980s Hermès acquired stakes in other luxury groups to enhance internal skills and grow revenues but all management was kept in house; outsiders were deemed inauthentic. The uniqueness and mystique of the Hermès brand was based on this tight family control. It was a strategy that worked, ensuring Hermès maintained its position throughout the recent global economic slowdown ahead of luxury brands such as Gucci, LVMH, Burberry and Mercedes Benz.

Transforming a troubled business

The chronicles of Louis Vuitton reflect a very different story. When Henry Racamier took over from his mother-in-law in 1977, the company was struggling through a difficult period. It continued to control design but not always production and had delegated merchandising to specialists, often for a mere licensing fee. Racamier noted it was the retailers who were making the biggest profits and quickly resolved to transform Louis Vuitton into a vertically integrated operation, opening its own retail stores and looking beyond Europe to the burgeoning Asian markets.

By 1984 sales had increased 15-fold to US$143 million, with a 40 percent profit margin – nearly double that of its competitors. To finance global expansion Racamier sold stock in the company and merged with Moet Hennessey to form LVMH which immediately began to acquire other luxury brands including a stake in Hermès.

“Jazzing up” the industry

About this time, Bernard Arnault, who had spent several unsuccessful years in the Florida branch of his family’s real estate development company, returned to Paris and entered the luxury industry. He acquired Boussec, a bankrupt textile company and sold off most of its assets keeping Christian Dior – a fading couture house.

Having studied Racamier’s methods he set about vertically integrating his group, pulling all of the company’s manufacturing licenses and returning the quality of its in-house artisans to luxury standards. He opened Dior shops worldwide and took direct control of marketing, using jazzier designs, huge advertising campaigns and attention grabbing events. His “ruthless” pursuit of talent and acquisitions contravened the industry’s customs as he “stole” designers and aggressively acquired other luxury family-owned firms, firing founders and family members.

In 1988, Arnault began to buy shares in LVMH. After promising to support Racamier in a power struggle he allied himself with rival shareholders gaining enough support to install himself as chairman.

Hermès floated 4 percent of its shares in 1993, increasing the figure to 25 percent. In 2008 Arnault – concealing his actions through financial derivatives – bypassed the legal requirement to declare any ownership above five percent. After the death of former Hermès CEO, Jean-Louis Dumas, in May 2010 the company’s stock value doubled on speculation of takeovers and family dissent. LVMH converted its derivatives, at a roughly 50 percent discount of the actual stock price, adding another 12.1 percent of Hermès shares to the 4.9 percent it already owned.

It was then that Arnault disturbed Patrick Thomas’s country bike ride to inform him of his intent. Thomas responded viscerally. “If you want to seduce a beautiful woman,” he said, “you don’t start by raping her from behind.”

Redesigning the ownership structure

In December 2010 Thomas, supported by 52 key family shareholders, moved to protect the family legacy against any hostile takeover bid by redesigning the ownership structure. He established a holding company that would prevent at least 51 percent of shares from Hermès family members being transferred for the next 20 years. The company would retain the right of “first refusal” in the event any participating family member wished to sell their shares. Most notably, it would limit its voting power regarding the appointment of directors to the Hermès board and top management.

The French stock markets regulator, Autorité des Marchés Financiers (AMF) approved the move which gave 52 family members control of 50.2 percent of the shares and voting rights without having to launch a public tender offer for the whole company. The AMF’s decision was welcomed by Deminor, the leading European company focusing on the rights of minority shareholders, but its French equivalent ADAM (Association de defense des Actionnaires Minoritaires) appealed decrying the ruling as “unjust”. ADAM deemed that because less than 10 percent of shares were now freely floating on the market liquidity was severely reduced, unfairly penalising minority shareholders. It argued all minority shareholders should have the right to a buyout offer.

In the meantime, the price of Hermès stock fluctuated wildly. The day before the ruling on the ADAM appeal the share price closed at an all-time high at €265, up 69 percent from a year earlier. The next day shares dropped seven percent and continued to fall shedding a total of 20 percent over the next three weeks. By late November 2011, when Hermès new holding group, H51, was officially set up, LVMH had increased its stake to 22.3 percent.

Post script

In 2013, AMF fined LVMH €8 million for violating public disclosure requirements. LVMH announced in a company statement that the conglomerate, although disagreeing with the fine, would not pursue legal action. Meanwhile Arnault has continued to increase the company’s total Hermès stake to roughly 23 percent, describing it as a strategic, long-term investment.

When Thomas retired in February 2014 Axel Dupas, a sixth generation of the Hermès family, was announced as his replacement.

Bernard Arnault Announces Opening Of The Fondation Louis Vuitton - Daily Front Row,"Mon, 23 Jun 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vZmFzaGlvbndlZWtkYWlseS5jb20vYmVybmFyZC1hcm5hdWx0LWFubm91bmNlcy1vcGVuaW5nLWx2bWgtbXVzZXVtL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Bernard Arnault, LVMH’s chairman and CEO as well as a well-known art collector, has announced the opening of the Fondation Louis Vuitton, slated for October 27th. The Frank Gehry-designed museum will play host to the luxury conglomerate’s vast corporate art collection. The futuristic glass building will be located in the Jardin d’Acclimatation in Paris’ Bois de Boulogne area. The Fondation Louis Vuitton will focus on 20th and 21st century art in a 126,000 square foot space and contain 11 galleries.

While Arnault’s own art collection is widely known to be extensive, the museum will only feature the company’s corporate collection. Meanwhile, Arnault’s main competitor, François Henri-Pinault, opened the Palazzo Grassi in Venice in 2006, which display’s Pinault’s personal art collection. The French luxury magnate had originally planned to open a Tadao Ando-designed museum in his native country on the Ile Seguin in Paris in 2005, but the project was ultimately halted due to red tape regulations.

In addition to the permanent collection from LVMH, Arnault’s museum will also play host to temporary exhibitions and artist commissions, as well as events. Gehry’s architectural projects for the foundation will be the center of the museum’s inaugural exhibition, which will debut on October 20th, a week prior to the official opening (shortly before Gehry’s October 8th show at the Pompidou museum, the first European retrospective of the architect’s work). The inaugural exhibition will be open to the public for free the first three days by reservation ahead of the opening.

Vuitton also recently tapped Gehry to design a limited-edition handbag in its signature monogram canvas that is to arrive in stores in mid-October, as reported. Also participating in that project, dubbed “The Icon and the Iconoclasts,” are Karl Lagerfeld, Cindy Sherman, Rei Kawakubo, Christian Louboutin and Marc Newson.

$136 million at current exchange, the foundation represents one of LVMH’s biggest gestures of art patronage."
Loro Piana's bright future - Style,"Thu, 05 Jun 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjbXAuY29tL21hZ2F6aW5lcy9zdHlsZS9hcnRpY2xlLzE1MjA0OTQvbG9yby1waWFuYXMtYnJpZ2h0LWZ1dHVyZdIBTmh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLnNjbXAuY29tL21hZ2F6aW5lcy9zdHlsZS9hcnRpY2xlLzE1MjA0OTQvbG9yby1waWFuYXMtYnJpZ2h0LWZ1dHVyZQ?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"We offered the company to them. It was [in the] best interests of the company, thinking to the future. We wanted a company that could help continue and develop Loro Piana, and LVMH was the group that had more vision and capacity to develop Loro Piana for the future. What's important is to take the decisions that create conditions in which the company has the best future. So, we'll put the company first and the family second. What's best for the family may not necessarily be what's best for the company.

The strategy of Loro Piana has always been quite clear and defined, and I think that [new owner] LVMH Group wants to continue to respect that, so I don't see many changes. They say the strategy of change is not to change. [However], that's too restrictive. We are definitely ready to help them to understand more about Loro Piana. Once they do, there will be some changes for sure. The first mission is to manage the change.

Luxury for me is to have the opportunity and possibility to sell or buy something of the highest level of quality. The nature of natural raw materials like wool, cashmere, nylon, cotton, silk represent quality - not by definition but by tradition, by heritage. Our natural qualities are used in small quantities, so I don't see a problem with sustainability. The opposite is true: sometimes you can re-stimulate interest and demand for products. For example, the lotus flower was basically going to disappear, the vicuña were going to disappear, and if a special-quality cashmere from China starts producing low-quality cashmere, sooner or later the demand for cashmere would drop, and then it will disappear.

My father was very much attracted by beauty and quality. There was an economic boom in the 1960s in Italy, and he was part of it. So he already started to supply customers top-quality fabric. We inherited that. Then we started to produce some accessories in order to let people know that the best fabric in the world was Loro Piana. In order to be in touch with final consumers, we put our label there. Little by little, we built a full, nice collection of accessories and vintage products, then we started with the pilot store in New York in 1994, then our first flagship store in Milan in 1999.

Yes. We used the heritage that we got in textiles and aimed the control to the final product. We didn't have to deal with other people in the middle. This is a great product from beginning to end, but then you need the distribution channel. With a few stores, we can show our ideas to the consumers, and this is a great point.

If you tell the truth, you can always manage it; if you tell lies, it builds up. So stay true and get through it when you have problems and difficulties. Go try to find different ways in thinking, then you can get solutions in the same way.

Michael Schriver leaves DFS to join Louis Vuitton - TRBusiness,"Tue, 24 Jun 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRyYnVzaW5lc3MuY29tL3JlZ2lvbmFsLW5ld3MvaW50ZXJuYXRpb25hbC9taWNoYWVsLXNjaHJpdmVyLXRvLWpvaW4tbG91aXMtdnVpdHRvbi82NjgwNtIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"

DFS Group has formally announced today that COO Michael Schriver is leaving after 16 years to become President North Asia at Louis Vuitton.

Schriver – whose knowledge of the business and the industry is simply unrivalled – joined DFS back in 1998 as Vice President, General Merchandise Manager of the company’s Hawaii Division and has since held several leadership roles before being appointed to his current COO position in July 2012.

Paying tribute to his contribution, Philippe Schaus, DFS Chairman and CEO said: “Michael has played a key role and held many leadership positions during his 16 years with the Group. Michael was instrumental in leading the merchandising transition to its current luxury focus and has led the company’s operations through a period of extraordinary growth.

“I am delighted that we are able to make Michael’s invaluable skills available to LVMH Group for this important role.”

DFS said that Schriver will begin working for Louis Vuitton on September 1, 2014 and will continue to head up DFS Group’s operations until then. Schaus’ comments are very apt, with both he and Schriver working well together since he came into DFS as Group President of Merchandising and Marketing in 2011 from Louis Vuitton, where he held the position of Executive Vice President, Louis Vuitton Malletier.

SCHRIVER’S HUGE CONTRIBUTION:

Doug Newhouse writes: Michael Schriver’s contribution to DFS Group over the last 16 years has been tremendous, being right at the forefront of DFS’ ‘reinvention’ as a specialist luxury retailer catering largely to Japanese travellers in the nineties, to the particular expert retailer it has become today with Mainland Chinese – especially in Hong Kong and Macau.

The much respected Schriver has made a huge contribution to the overall business during his time at DFS and never more so than in the years following the relocation of DFS’ HQ to Hong Kong a decade ago under the then visionary Chairman and CEO Ed Brennan.

This move has resulted in huge strides being made in DFS’ relationship with Mainland Chinese customers, along with the creation of ever more luxurious downtown ’T’ Gallerias and some new ground-breaking airport retail executions in Los Angeles, Hong Kong and other locations.

DFS is clearly regarded within the very top tier of luxury retailing by large, medium and small branded suppliers throughout the world and its reputation with airports, landlords and even its rival retailers is largely second to none. TRBusiness would like to acknowledge the huge role that Michael Schriver has played in building DFS Group internally and with suppliers and landlords and we wish him good luck in his new role with Louis Vuitton.

Asked whether the company will be looking for a successor to Schriver, a spokesman today suggested that DFS will be making an organisational announcement at some time in the future."
Hermes doesn't want 'rival' LVMH as main outside shareholder: CEO - AsiaOne,"Wed, 04 Jun 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFzaWFvbmUuY29tL3dvcmxkL2hlcm1lcy1kb2VzbnQtd2FudC1yaXZhbC1sdm1oLW1haW4tb3V0c2lkZS1zaGFyZWhvbGRlci1jZW_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Paris - French luxury goods maker Hermes voiced its frustration at having arch-rival LVMH as its biggest external shareholder at its annual general meeting on Tuesday and once more called on the group to sell its stake.

LVMH, the world's biggest luxury group, which owns 23 per cent of Hermes, was fined 8 million euros by the French market watchdog AMF last year for failing to properly disclose its building of a stake before 2010.

Hermes, the 177-year-old maker of Birkin and Kelly handbags which is more than 70 per cent family-owned, has been vehemently protesting the presence of LVMH in its shareholder capital ever since it learned of its surprise entry in 2010.

""We do not want shareholders that are rivals,"" Hermes Chief Executive Axel Dumas told the company's annual shareholder meeting on Tuesday.

""We want to preserve our independence."" After the meeting, Dumas told Reuters he was ""not aware""whether LVMH would be willing to sell down its stake.

In an interview with Le Figaro newspaper published on Tuesday, Dumas said: ""LVMH is totally free to sell its shares and to be honest, would be welcome to do so.""

LVMH, owner of Louis Vuitton, Dior and Celine fashion brands, has repeatedly said it was ""satisfied"" being Hermes'shareholder and backed its management's strategy. ""But satisfied does not mean friendly,"" Dumas told Le Figaro. And they (LVMH) are not particularly friendly with our management.""

Separately, Dumas said Hermes was considering opening a shop in South Africa in the medium term, preferably in Johannesburg. He said he expected sales in Japan, one of the company's biggest markets where sales rose 6.5 per cent at constant exchange rates in 2013, would be similar this year.

Hermes shares - which have lost nearly 2 per cent since Jan 1 after climbing nearly 17 per cent in 2013 - were barely changed in midday trading at 259.2 euros, valuing the company at 27.4 billion euros.

That makes Hermes the third largest luxury group by market capitalisation behind LVMH and Richemont."
"At London Men's Fashion Week, Designers Fly the Flag for Individuality (Published 2014) - The New York Times","Wed, 18 Jun 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMTQvMDYvMTkvZmFzaGlvbi9hdC1sb25kb24tbWVucy1mYXNoaW9uLXdlZWstZGVzaWduZXJzLWZseS10aGUtZmxhZy1mb3ItaW5kaXZpZHVhbGl0eS5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LONDON — One of the standout shows of London Collections: Men, the city’s three-day men’s fashion “week,” was by a 27-year-old novice named Craig Green. It was all the more astonishing because it was, technically, his first.

Few fashion capitals are as nurturing to its emerging talent as London. Its success is all the more evident now that fashion’s reigning conglomerates have taken note and invested in its rising stars: LVMH in Jonathan Anderson of J. W. Anderson and the shoemaker Nicholas Kirkwood; Kering in Christopher Kane.

But the success stories here are not limited to the headliners who have won corporate backing and plum jobs. (Mr. Anderson’s first collection as the creative director of the LVMH-owned Spanish label Loewe will debut in Paris on June 27.) The city is already offering new case studies of innocence quickly evolving into experience, like that of Mr. Green (who, despite the foregoing statement, still lives at home with his mum)."

Before the shocking news that Professor Louise Wilson, the lightning bolt of Central Saint Martins and its fashion students, had passed away; and before Wendy Dagworthy, the head of fashion at the Royal College of Art, had decided to retire after 16 years, leaving two of the UK’s most important fashion schools rudderless – the writing was already on the studio walls.

Fashion universities in the UK are facing a crisis.

Exactly thirty years since John Galliano graduated from St Martins, the class of 2014 has left college with inventive, imaginative and intriguing work. But also with something much less palatable: a mountain of debt.

Since the law governing tuition fees and student loans changed in 2010, putting English education on a par with the established American system, it is harder than ever to imagine a Lee McQueen, a brilliant, wilful, taxi driver’s son, making it through college today.

Students across the world now find themselves dumped with crippling sums to pay off and under pressure to find a job – any job – or to take out a further loans to try to build a business."
