LVMH Sales Up Due to Supreme x Louis Vuitton - HYPEBEAST,"Thu, 27 Jul 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vaHlwZWJlYXN0LmNvbS8yMDE3LzcvbHZtaC1zYWxlcy11cC0yMDE3LXN1cHJlbWUtbG91aXMtdnVpdHRvbtIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LVMH has amassed an approximate $23 billion USD in earnings for the first half of the year. The luxury conglomerate’s 23% profit increase is partially due to the Supreme x Louis Vuitton collaboration which dropped at the end of the sales period but alongside LV’s partnership with Jeff Koons this past spring season, the Parisian fashion staple has called the Supreme x LV collab a “highlight” in its recovery.

It is also worth noting that these massive earnings are being compared to LVMH’s skimpy sales numbers in Asia and France from last year. According to Fashionista, the poor performance was “due to slow tourism and the Paris attacks.” Nevertheless, LVMH has a profitable future ahead, especially if the imprint continues to churn out hot collaborations like Supreme x LV.","{'label': 'Negative', 'score': 0.9998589754104614}",negative,0.9998589754104614,-1
LVMH Confirms Eric Marechalle as CEO of Marc Jacobs - WWD,"Tue, 18 Jul 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3dkLmNvbS9mYXNoaW9uLW5ld3MvZGVzaWduZXItbHV4dXJ5L2x2bWgtY29uZmlybXMta2Vuem8tZXJpYy1tYXJlY2hhbGxlLWFzLWNlby1vZi1tYXJjLWphY29icy0xMDk0ODI4Ni_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"NEW YORK — LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton has charged Kenzo’s chief executive officer Eric Marechalle with leading the turnaround effort at Marc Jacobs International.

He is to leave Kenzo and become ceo of Marc Jacobs International in the third quarter of the year.

This confirms a report in WWD on June 21 that Marechalle would take over from Sebastian Suhl, who is leaving LVMH “to pursue personal interests.”

Marechalle will continue to report to Pierre-Yves Roussel, ceo of LVMH Fashion Group, which spans a host of brands from Givenchy and Céline to Emilio Pucci, along with Kenzo and Marc Jacobs.

Roussel said Marechalle’s “strong experience in brand management” would “give a new impetus” to Marc Jacobs and “further help us develop it, in collaboration with Marc.”

LVMH reported solid business in the first quarter, with chief financial officer Jean-Jacques Guiony flagging the Jacobs business as “probably one of the few negative performances we have in the group.”

Marechalle’s successor at Kenzo will be announced “shortly,” LVMH noted.

WWD reported on May 26 that Suhl would soon exit Marc Jacobs, which he joined in 2014. It is understood he will remain at the management helm through a transition period. His next move could not immediately be learned.

Under Suhl’s watch watch, the Marc by Marc Jacobs brand, launched in 2000, was eliminated with the intention of unifying both it and the Marc Jacobs Collection under the singular Jacobs label while expanding the range of contemporary offerings and price points.

Marechalle knows that space well, having been charged at Kenzo with refocusing the brand from its designer roots to a more overtly energetic, contemporary perspective. Shortly after his appointment, Opening Ceremony’s Carol Lim and Humberto Leon were hired as co-creative directors, taking over from Antonio Marras.

Kenzo transitioned quickly into one of the most interesting brands in the European contemporary sphere.

Before joining that house in 2011, Marechalle headed the children’s brand Catimini, part of what was then The Zannier Group, now Kidiliz Group. At the time, its other children’s wear licenses included Kenzo Kids and Little Marc Jacobs, the former of which it still produces. Children Worldwide Fashion now holds the license for Little Marc.

Marechalle began his career in 1992 at retailer C&A in France as Haussmann store director before joining Zannier.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999761581420898}",neutral,0.9999761581420898,0
Fake Krug 1947: LVMH claims victory over Acker Merrall - Decanter.com,"Fri, 07 Jul 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlY2FudGVyLmNvbS93aW5lLW5ld3MvZmFrZS1rcnVnLTE5NDctbHZtaC1jbGFpbXMtdmljdG9yeS1hY2tlci1tZXJyYWxsLTM3MjI0My_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Auction house Acker Merrall has admitted infringing on the trademarks of Moët Hennessy after it 'unintentionally' listed a counterfeit bottle of Krug Collection 1947 in a Hong Kong sale catalogue.

The settlement between the two companies in the High Court of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region follows the catalogue listing of a bottle of Krug Collection 1947 by Acker Merrall & Condit (Asia) in September 2012.

As a result, Moët Hennessy brought a court action for trademark infringement and passing off, which resulted in Acker Merrall’s admission of the infringement.

The French company, which is part of LVMH, added that the court settlement also states that the auction house should ‘conduct reasonably appropriate authentication procedures’ to ensure that all products labelled as Krug (or any other Moët Hennessy Champagne trademarks) are genuine.

Acker Merrall & Condit (Asia) said it was ‘pleased’ to have settled the case, but pointed out that the matter did not come to trial, but the parties reached a settlement ‘after years of litigation’.

The auction house added that the infringement of Moët Hennessy trademarks had been ‘wholly unintentional’, and that it or its affiliates had sold tens of thousands of bottles of Krug Champagne.

‘Unfortunately, counterfeits are a reality of life in the fine and rare wine world and, despite robust procedures we have in place to minimise the risk of counterfeit bottles entering the marketplace, those procedures are not infallible,’ Acker Merrall said.

‘In this particular case, Krug was able to conclude that the bottle at issue was counterfeit after subjecting it to review and comparative analysis at the domaine. This review and analysis included access to information and records that were, to our knowledge, in Krug’s sole possession and which were not publicly available.’

Moët Hennessy said the action reflected its ‘dedication to the fight against counterfeiting’, adding: ‘Moët Hennessy is committed to ensuring its consumers the best quality and security, and is extremely vigilant in all distribution channels.’

The world of high fashion finally has its answer to Amazon - Engadget,"Thu, 13 Jul 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVuZ2FkZ2V0LmNvbS8yMDE3LTA3LTEzLWx2bWgtMjQtc2V2cmVzLWludGVydmlldy5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"To give you an idea of the kind of customer LVMH is after, all you need to look at is Louis Vuitton's new $2,900 Android Wear smartwatch. The French company, which owns brands like Dior, Fendi, Givenchy and Marc Jacobs in addition to LV, is the epitome of luxury. And now, with 24 Sèvres, LVMH has what it hopes can become the main online destination for high-fashion shoppers. CEO Eric Goguey says the site is designed to be the web version of Le Bon Marché, an iconic retail space often described as the most selective department store in Paris.

The main idea, he says, is to offer an experience that feels seamless and exclusive. There's even personal shoppers who will video-chat with customers and guide them through their purchases. Contrary to rumors, 24 Sèvres won't just sell products from LVMH-owned brands, of which there are 70. People will also find clothes, footwear and leather goods (bags, backpacks, etc.) from outside designers such as Balenciaga, Gucci, Balmain and Stella McCartney. Others like Nike and Adidas will have a presence on the site as well, but their products won't be general releases -- think limited-edition Cortez shoes, Kanye West's Yeezy collections and more.

Naturally, 24 Sèvres also created an iOS app to complement the desktop experience. A Facebook Messenger Style Bot, meanwhile, is intended to help customers with recommendations and style guidance -- because what the world needs is fewer human customer service agents. ""The ultimate goal is to provide e-commerce as it hasn't been until now, and ensure that it continues to be delivered with a personal touch,"" says Goguey. ""Technology should always be at the service of the human, rather than the other way around. In this vein, we are creating a store for the digital age with a truly luxury experience.""

The arrival of 24 Sèvres comes less than a year after LVMH's Chief Operating Officer, Jean-Jacques Guiony, said ""there is no way"" it could sell any of its products on Amazon, the e-commerce giant that's been trying to push its way into the world of fashion. ""We believe the business of Amazon does not fit with LVMH, full stop, and it does not fit with our brands,"" he said to investors during the company's earnings call last October. While 24 Sèvres isn't a direct clone of Amazon, nor is it supposed to be, it shows that LVMH is serious about keeping its products away from Jeff Bezos' platform. Nike had taken a similar approach up until a few weeks ago, when it finally caved and announced that it would start selling some of its goods directly on Amazon.

When it launched in June, 24 Sèvres was being called LVMH's first foray into the e-commerce space, but that's not actually the case. In 2014, the fashion powerhouse created a site called Moët Hennessy Collection, where it sold fancy liquor and wines such as Dom Perignon, Moët & Chandon, Cloudy Bay, Cape Mentelle and Hennessy. That, however, was abruptly shut down roughly two years later, with the company saying that it was ""a global decision around how we evolve our brand in the digital space."" Goguey wouldn't talk about what lessons, if any, the company learned from that failure, but he sounds confident that the fate of 24 Sèvres will be different.

Marshal Cohen, chief industry analyst at research firm NPD, says one of the reasons LVMH may not want to work with Amazon is brand appearance and exclusivity. ""Somebody who's going to buy LVMH product would almost prefer to go to an LVMH website, unless they're going to be able to get it at such a great discount somewhere else. That doesn't benefit LVMH either, so it makes sense for them to operate on their own,"" he says. It sounds petty, but chances are that 24 Sèvres core customers don't want to get a $4,000 garment from Amazon. ""It's imagery, it's prestige, it's accessibility,"" Cohen says. ""I don't want to buy an expensive luxury item and be one of a million people. I want to be one in a million.""

It's too early to tell whether 24 Sèvres will be a hit, but Goguey says that the response from shoppers so far has been ""incredibly positive"" and that they're ""thrilled"" to have a digital counterpart to the renowned Le Bon Marché retail store. ""Their success is going to depend on the ability to resonate with the consumer,"" Cohen says, ""to help them understand what the essence of the product is, why this is the right product to buy. They're going to have to deliver on that promise and the expectations.""

One thing 24 Sèvres already has going for it is that it looks different than most shopping sites out there right now, thanks to big, beautiful imagery on the home and product pages. Goguey says this is meant to make you feel like you're window-shopping at high-end stores, whether it be in Paris or New York City. And, really, a well-designed site is the least you should expect when you're about to spend thousands of dollars on a handbag.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999692440032959}",neutral,0.9999692440032959,0
Modern Dazed Media Teams Up with Adrian Cheng to Take Nowness Offline in China - Jing Daily,"Thu, 20 Jul 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiNmh0dHBzOi8vamluZ2RhaWx5LmNvbS9wb3N0cy9tb2Rlcm4tZGF6ZWQtbm93bmVzcy1jaGluYdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"As digital platforms play an increasingly influential role in China's luxury market, the country's major industry players are exploring ways to incorporate it into wider consumer experiences. That's one goal media company Modern Dazed had in mind when it acquired a majority stake in Nowness , a digital media platform that has been shaping consumer culture since LVMH founded it in 2010.

Modern Dazed, a new joint venture between Dazed Media and Modern Media, which publishes Modern Weeky, Bloomberg Businessweek, and several other titles, will be working with K11 art mall founder and chairman of Chow Tai Fook, Adrian Cheng, who has been named vice chairman and creative advisor of Nowness in the new venture.

Dazed Media and LVMH had previously been operating Nowness under a joint venture, but now LVMH has a minority stake in the company, while Modern Dazed has big plans for it in China. According to Modern Media, this starts with an official Nowness China launch and more localized content planned for September.

Chinese luxury consumers and creatives have already had exposure to Nowness since it first launched its official WeChat and Weibo accounts in 2012. Modern Media representatives told Jing Daily that this has already formed a foundation for success as it plans to embark on creating a “videozine” concept, leveraging Nowness's well-established expertise in creative video content.

Nowness has a Chinese language site and social media accounts, but Modern Media is working to launch an official Nowness China as soon as September.

“From the number of re-posts [on social media], it’s clear that Nowness films have been very popular in China, so when we shared the news of this new collaboration, it excited many luxury brands and many of our loyal readers,” they said.

Cheng told Jing Daily that Nowness has a ""clear edge"" in creating China-focused content in a luxury industry that's influenced heavily by video and image-sharing.

“Nowness is a breath of fresh air in the congested content industry in China,” he said. “With its creative, art-driven content, it differentiates itself from the pack and that’s exactly what a lot of luxury brands look for.”

In keeping with the growing experiential luxury trend, Modern Dazed also has plans to take Nowness offline through a project with K11.

“As e-commerce continues to grow, brick and mortar shops, as we’ll see, will become a means to provide experiences, and not just shopping experiences, but cultural and educational journeys,” Cheng said. “It is envisioned that Nowness will be more than a multimedia platform, but a channel that offers seamless online and offline content that brings customers closer to different brand experiences. I believe personalized O2O experiences are the future of retail.”

Meanwhile, LVMH turned heads in the industry when it announced in May it was taking retail further online by launching a major, multi-brand e-commerce venture, called Sevres. Modern Media said that they are also exploring ways to link its multi-media creative platform to e-commerce in the future.

For now though, the collaboration opens up possibilities for shaping the consumer before they even think about making purchases—especially China's millennial generation as they increasingly seek out stories and meaning behind the products they consider buying.

“Although China is the fastest growing market in luxury consumption, it is still at an early stage in terms of its exposure to luxury goods,” Cheng said. “I see Nowness as a bridge between online and offline experiences that can also educate Chinese luxury consumers on brand stories, concepts, and heritage. It is China’s window to the etiquette and culture of foreign luxury.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9519733190536499}",neutral,0.9519733190536499,0

Now, it has two hungry American players with which to contend.

Coach and Michael Kors, fashion houses that have thus far catered to the “middle market” of the luxury sector, are looking to transform themselves into leading forces in the field, and they could reshape the industry in the process.

Kors said on Tuesday that it would buy the upmarket London-based shoemaker Jimmy Choo for $1.2 billion. It declared the deal to be the beginning of a makeover that would turn an ailing American single-brand accessories business into a multilabel global fashion and luxury behemoth.

“Acquiring Jimmy Choo is the beginning of a strategy that we have for building a luxury group that really is focused on international fashion brands,” John D. Idol, the chairman and chief executive of Michael Kors Holdings, said in an interview.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.999947190284729}",neutral,0.999947190284729,0
LVMH up 12% to $23.2bn as DFS recovers well in HY1 - TRBusiness,"Thu, 27 Jul 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRyYnVzaW5lc3MuY29tL3JlZ2lvbmFsLW5ld3MvaW50ZXJuYXRpb25hbC9sdm1oLXVwLTEyLXRvLTIzLTJibi1hcy1kZnMtcmVjb3ZlcnMtd2VsbC1pbi1oeTEvMTI0MDc00gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton company has reported that all of its geographic areas ‘continue to progress well’ as it announced 12% revenue growth to €19.7bn ($23.1m) for the first six months.

LVMH said it benefited from a favourable comparison base – ‘particularly in Asia but also in France’, where activity was impacted last year by a decline in tourism.

Underpinning this, the world’s leading luxurygoods company said that group revenue increased by 15% in the second quarter, as organic revenue growth grew by 12%, while profit from recurring operations rose by 23% to €3,640m ($4,281m), the operating margin rose one point to 18.5% and the group share of net profit rose by 24% to €2,119m ($2,492m).

BETTER ASIAN MOMENTUM

Along with other divisions, DFS Group benefited strongly from much better momentum in Asia, with the company’s CFO Jean-Jacques Guinoy confirming the ‘significant sales recovery in Hong Kong, Macau and Japan’, alongside DFS’ newly opened Gallerias in Cambodia and Venice.

[Guinoy’s comments were made at a post-results conference call for analysts yesterday-Ed].

Guinoy also confirmed that DFS has increased its loyalty programme marketing efforts as well as introducing a new travel booking service and he added that the travel retailer is also planning to open two new beauty points of sale in Macau.

In addition, the retailer is also continuing ‘to modernise its store network’ – including outlets in Hong Kong, Auckland and Sydney and Guinoy confirmed that it will benefit at the end of this year from the end of its unprofitable Hong Kong International Airport concession – a business which has proved a big drag on its profitability.

BERNARD ARNAULT: ‘EXCELLENT FIRST HALF’

There was also more positive news from most of LVMH’s other divisions, with Chairman and Ceo Bernard Arnault reflecting this in his positive round-up comments.

He said: “LVMH has enjoyed an excellent first half, to which all our businesses contributed. In the current climate of geopolitical and economic instability, creativity and quality, the founding values of our group, have more than ever become benchmarks for all.

“The increasing digitalization of our activities furthermore reinforces the quality of the experience we bring to our customers. In an environment that remains uncertain, we approach the second half of the year with caution.

“We will remain vigilant and rely on the entrepreneurial spirit and talent of our teams to further increase our leadership in the world of high-quality products in 2017.”

In summary, LVMH listed a number of highlights from the first six months’ trading, before analysing each division’s performances individually.

IMPRESSIVE HIGHLIGHTS

Besides the aforementioned double-digit increases in both revenue and profit from recurring operations, the luxury goods company pointed to good growth for the group as a whole in Europe, Asia and the United States, outstanding momentum and exceptional profitability at Louis Vuitton and LVMH’s planned acquisition of Christian Dior Couture (finalised on 3 July).

It also highlighted the ‘good start to the year for Wines and Spirits’, the integration of premium-class luggage brand Rimowa and the strong performance of new products at Christian Dior.

LVMH also noted the growth at Bvlgari, an ‘excellent response’ to TAG Heuer’s new products and the continued strengthening of Sephora’s omnichannel strategy.

Other highlights included cash from operations before changes in working capital of €4.5bn ($5.2bn) , an increase of 23% and a net debt to equity ratio of 14% at the end of June 2017.

In terms of the results by division, LVMH said wines and spirits had a good start to the year with solid growth in the US market ‘and improved momentum in China’.

WINES & SPIRITS +12%

The company said: “The Wines & Spirits business group recorded organic revenue growth of 10%. On a reported basis, revenue rose 12% and profit from recurring operations increased by 21%.

“The business group reaffirmed its commitment to innovation with many initiatives across the brands. All the Champagne Houses have performed well. Europe and the United States were particularly dynamic.

“Hennessy Cognac continued to show strong growth in the US market, while demand is recovering in China. The second half of the year is expected to experience a slowdown in volume growth, given the existing supply constraints.”

The group also reported ‘good creative momentum’ at Louis Vuitton within the Fashion & Leather Goods business group as a whole, which generated organic revenue growth of 14%. [On a reported basis, revenue rose 17%, with profit from recurring operations up 34%-Ed].

Commenting on the divisional performance, LVMH said: “The momentum at Louis Vuitton, driven by its exceptional creativity, was demonstrated across all its product categories. The Cruise Collection presented at the Miho Museum in Kyoto, Japan, was a great illustration of this.

STRONG LUXURY GROWTH TRENDS

“The launch of new models resulting from the collaboration with the artist Jeff Koons and the cult New York skatewear brand, Supreme, were the highlights of the first half.

“Fendi continued its strong growth and enriched its leather goods lines, notably with the new Kan-I model. Loro Piana strengthened its presence in Asia with several openings.

“Céline, Loewe and Kenzo experienced good growth. Marc Jacobs strengthened its product offering and continued its restructuring. Other brands continued to grow. Rimowa, which joined the LVMH Group, is consolidated for the first time in the first half-year accounts.”

LVMH also pointed to healthy organic growth of 12% for its Perfumes & Cosmetics business group as revenues grew by 14% and profit from recurring operations by plus-7%.

DIOR PERFORMS STRONGLY

“Christian Dior showed strong growth momentum, sustained by the vitality of its iconic fragrances J’adore and Miss Dior, the continued success of Sauvage and the performance of its latest makeup creations,” said LVMH.

“Guerlain enjoyed a successful launch of its new perfume, Mon Guerlain, represented by Angelina Jolie. Parfums Givenchy experienced rapid growth in makeup, especially its line of lipsticks. Benefit continued to roll out its Brow Collection.”

It was also a similarly positive story at the Watches & Jewelry division where the parent company reported a good first half for Bvlgari alongside the continuing successful development of TAG Heuer.

This division recorded organic revenue growth of 13% with revenue up 14% and profit from recurring operations increasing by 14%. Breaking the key performances down, LVMH said that Bvlgari enjoyed ‘an excellent first half’ and continued to gain market share.

DFS GROUP BACK IN GROWTH

The company added: “This dynamic is notable in both jewellery and watchmaking, especially in China and Europe, thanks to the success of the iconic Serpenti and B-Zero 1 lines and the new Octo Finissimo watch.

“TAG Heuer experienced solid revenue growth in a tough watch market. The new products created in its flagship Carrera, Aquaracer and Formula 1 collections were very successful and a new generation of the smart watch was launched. Hublot continued its growth.”

Last, but certainly not least, the Selective Retailing division reported growth at Sephora as well as ‘improved momentum’ at DFS Group in Asia (as mentioned).

SEPHORA CONTINUES ITS STRONG PROGRESS

LVMH reported that this division returned organic revenue growth of 12% over the trading period, with sales up 15% on a reported basis and profit from recurring operations delivering plus-8%.

Commenting on the performance within its results statement, LVMH said: “Sephora continued to make progress and reinforced its omnichannel strategy.

“While increasing its share of online sales, Sephora continued to invest in extending its network and renovating existing stores, particularly in New York and Dubai.

“Le Bon Marché developed anew online shopping experience by launching its digital platform 24 Sèvres. DFS experienced better momentum in Asia, while the T Galleria(s), which opened in 2016 in Cambodia and Italy, continued to develop.”

SUPPLEMENTARY: [Responding to an analysts’ question at the post results announcement conference call yesterday, CFO Jean-Jacques Guiony acknowledged that the Hong Kong market, a vital one for LVMH’s brands and retailers – DFS in particular – is now performing more positively, although he said this needed to be seen in the context where the market’s sales declines have been ’going down two or three years in a row in a double-digit way’. Nevertheless, he said all of the signs are now much better: “The business is growing globally double digit in Hong Kong in the first half of the year – it’s true for most of the brands, including DFS and Vuitton. He said customer traffic ‘is definitely much better’ along with the size of the average purchase ‘in most stores’].

LOOKING FORWARD TO THE FULL YEAR…

Turning to the outlook for the rest of 2017, LVMH management says it will ‘continue to pursue gains in market share through the numerous product launches planned before the end of the year and its geographic expansion in promising markets’, while continuing to manage costs – despite the context of geopolitical and currency uncertainties.

The company concluded: “Our strategy of focusing on quality across all our activities, combined with the dynamism and unparalleled creativity of our teams, will enable us to reinforce, once again in 2017, LVMH’s global leadership position in luxury goods.”

The company added that an interim dividend of €1.60 ($1.87) will be paid to shareholders on December 7th, 2017.

Arnault Family Ups Christian Dior Stake to 94.2 Percent - WWD,"Tue, 04 Jul 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3dkLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy1uZXdzL2ZpbmFuY2lhbC9hcm5hdWx0LWZhbWlseS11cHMtY2hyaXN0aWFuLWRpb3Itc3Rha2UtOTQtMjItcGVyY2VudC0xMDkzODQ0Ni_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS — The Arnault family has upped its stake in Christian Dior SE, which controls LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, to 94.2 percent from 74.3 percent as part of its plan announced in April to simplify LVMH’s ownership structure.

According to a note published Tuesday by France’s market watchdog the Autorité des Marchés Financiers, at the conclusion of the public offer period on June 30, 36.4 million shares in Christian Dior SE had been tendered to Semyrhamis, an Arnault family company.

This means that the family now controls 94.2 percent of Christian Dior SE’s capital and 96.5 percent of its voting rights, the AMF said.

“The offer is a great success,” said a source close to LVMH, adding that there are no plans to launch an additional tender offer and delist Christian Dior’s shares from the Euronext Paris stock exchange for at least a year.

An LVMH spokesman declined to comment.

In parallel, Dior had announced plans to sell Christian Dior Couture, owned 100 percent by Christian Dior SE, to LVMH at an enterprise value of 6.5 billion euros, or $7.4 billion, to bring Dior’s fashion, accessories and beauty activities under one roof. The spokesman confirmed that that deal was concluded on Monday.

What Richemont's Divorce from Shanghai Tang Reveals About These Western-Owned Chinese Luxury Labels - Jing Daily,"Thu, 06 Jul 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vamluZ2RhaWx5LmNvbS9wb3N0cy9zaGFuZ2hhaS10YW5nLXJpY2hlbW9uLXdlc3Qtb3duZWQtY2hpbmVzZS1sdXh1cnktYnJhbmRz0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The Swiss luxury conglomerate Richemont Group has sold the Hong Kong-based luxury brand Shanghai Tang to the Italian investor Alessandro Bastagli and private equity fund Cassia Investments Ltd on July 3, ending its 19-year partnership with the first Chinese luxury brand.

Since its inception in 1994, Shanghai Tang has positioned itself as an international brand that offers its global clientele upscale, high-end goods with an innovative ""Chinese touch."" One such item is the qipao, or traditional body-hugging Chinese dress popular among Shanghai's socialites in the 1920s.

Besides clothing, the company offers a wide range of products from accessories to home furnishings, and has won over a number of Asian markets.

In 1998, Richemont Group took a controlling stake in the company, and did a full takeover in 2008, which coincided with the taking off of the luxury market in China. Shanghai Tang's unique positioning helped Richemont Group move into that market.

The success of the brand in Asia, however, did not translate into a win in major Western markets.

""Shanghai Tang's brand performance is barely satisfactory since the acquisition,"" said Vinchy Chan, the Luxury Consultant at Brand Finance, ""which I think is the main reason for this divorce.""

In 2013 , Shanghai Tang's executive chairman Raphael le Masne de Chermont told the Business of Fashion that the brand's top consumers were from mainland China, while Asians ""as a whole"" represented 51 percent of the consumer base.

The fundamental design concept unfortunately didn't resonate with the rising Chinese millennial consumers who, in recent years, have shown that they clearly prefer Western luxury brands.

""Shanghai Tang is immaterial in the broader CFR portfolio,"" said Luca Solca, the head of luxury goods at Exane BNP Paribas. ""It ended up being a distraction, while the business has been going nowhere.""

Richemont is not the first Western luxury group that has started to sell off brands with strong connections to traditional Chinese culture. This past January, the French luxury group LVMH's wine and spirits business line Moët Hennessy took a similar move when it disposed of Wenjun Distillery, a Chinese premium white spirit company that has a rich history dating back to the ancient Han Dynasty.

LVMH first acquired a 55-percent of stake in Wenjun Distillery in May 2007 from Jiannanchun, according to the official statement by LVMH. Many market analysts saw the investment as a smart move by LVMH to take advantage of China's emerging upper middle class given the popularity of white spirit consumption then.

However, high-end wine and spirit consumption has been hit hard by the anti-corruption campaign launched by the Chinese President Xi Jinping in 2013. Wenjun has had very poor market performance in recent years, which made divestiture a logical step for LVMH.

The sales of Shanghai Tang and Wenjun further spark concern over other similar collaborations between Western and Chinese businesses including Hermès and high-end luxury lifestyle and furnishings brand Shang Xia.

Shang Xia was co-founded by Hermès International and the Chinese designer Jiang Qiong Er back in 2008. The fundamental design concept of Shang Xia is inspired strongly by the ancient and modern Chinese aesthetics and culture.

Positioning itself as a kind of ""slow luxury,"" Hermès' global CEO Patrick Thomas is not rushing to see profits coming from Shang Xia. According to an interview with the Wall Street Journal in 2014, Thomas expected the costs and benefits of the brand to break even in 2016, which was eight years after its foundation.

Even though the patience is much appreciated, Hermès still cannot afford to ignore one question, which is whether the Chinese luxury buyers will someday arrive at a point when they are fond of paying big on a Qing dynasty-inspired wooden chair or bamboo woven bags. Currently, these products are more favored by a group of niche customers who have strong interests in Chinese traditional culture.

""I think for Shang Xia is a little bit different,"" said Vinchy Chan, the Luxury Consultant at the Brand Finance. ""They don't really have a rich brand heritage. I can see they are successfully leveraging the bond with Hermes to build the luxury brand image. Brand positioning is unique, but they need to invest in building up their brand awareness.""

However, Chan also recognizes that ""Being niche is a double-edged sword. It's easy to create a brand premium in terms of price, but this also limits your reach to consumers.""

In May of this year, Shang Xia launched a store on Alibaba's Tmall platform , officially breaking into the e-commerce market and attempting to reach out to a wider consumer group. The move got varied reception from the market with some experts calling the move a signal that Hermès is not happy with the brand's performance. But there is little doubt that Shang Xia is now expected to capture the mass market, which is an unclear path for a niche brand.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.8224939703941345}",positive,0.8224939703941345,1

Hermès: behind the scenes of the French luxury gem - theconversation.com,"Tue, 11 Jul 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vdGhlY29udmVyc2F0aW9uLmNvbS9oZXJtZXMtYmVoaW5kLXRoZS1zY2VuZXMtb2YtdGhlLWZyZW5jaC1sdXh1cnktZ2VtLTgwNTUx0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Hermès is a quintessential French luxury brand. But behind the beauty, refinement and quality of its products, the company is also financially strong. What are the cornerstones of its success?

The group published outstanding figures for the 2016 financial year, recording sales of more than 5 billion euros (up 7.5%). While the two leading companies in the luxury market (LVMH and Richemont, according to a Deloitte study, “Global Powers of Luxury Goods 2017”) far surpass Hermès in turnover (37.6 billion euros for LVMH at the end of December 2016, and 10.6 billion euros for the Swiss company at the end of March 2017), no luxury industry group beats Hermès’ performance. In 2016, the company’s net profit represented 21.1% of sales, far above the industry average of 8.95% and ahead of both LVMH (10.5%) and the Richemont Group (11.36%).

In our opinion, Hermès’ four major strengths are: a real identity, the creativity and skills of its artisans, innovation, and the fact that it remains an independent family company.

A real identity

Founded by Thierry Hermès in Paris, in 1837, the company established its identity through its products. After starting out with horse-riding and carriage accessories, today the group operates in a wide range of sectors (detailed in its 2016 reference document, including clothes and accessories (21% of sales), silk and textiles (10%), perfumes (5%), watches (3%) and other products (4%), including jewelry, lifestyle products and home wares. Accounting for 50% of sales, leather goods and saddlery still make up the backbone of the company.

The group is deeply attached to its French identity: it is not simply “Hermès”, but “Hermès Paris”. The majority of its products are still manufactured in France, with 4,300 craftspeople and 61.4% of its workforce located within the country.

Maintaining a large part of their manufacturing in France is a key element of Hermès strategy. This contrasts with a number of companies in the luxury sector that have looked overseas in a search for short-term profits, a phenomenon decried by Dana Thomas in her book, Deluxe : How Luxury Lost Its Lustre.

The exceptional creativity and skills handed down from generation to generation constitute the second plank of the Hermès strategy.

Wikipedia

Creativity and skills of its artisans

In 2007, Jean Louis Dumas, the group’s iconic chairman from 1978 to 2006, told Vanity Fair: “We don’t have a policy of image; we have a policy of product.”

Hermès would not be Hermès without timeless, iconic models such as “The Kelly bag” (created in 1930, renamed in 1956) and the much larger “The Birkin Bag” (1984).

It takes two years for an artisan to learn how to work leather and six years when it comes to precious leathers. One of Hermès’ core principles is that each bag be made by the same artisan, from start to finish. As Axel Dumas always says, “The rule of one bag, one artisan is part of our DNA”.

At Hermès, the idea of responsibility is very important – the artisan must master all of the different stages of fabrication. Quality begins with the choice of materials. To secure its supply of the highest-quality raw materials, Hermès purchased three Australian crocodile farms at the end of 2012.

The company’s third strength lies in its combination of creativity, invention and innovation.

Sense of innovation

To give just a few examples, Hermès launched Petit h in 2010, under the direction of Pascale Mussard, whose motto is “Don’t throw anything away, we will always find a use for it”. The majority of these pieces are on display in a 1,500-square-meter room at 17, rue de Sèvres, which opened in 2010. Formerly the pool of the hotel Lutetia, the space was listed as a historical monument in 2005. This contrasts with the boutique at 24, rue du Faubourg Saint-Honoré, which has a modern style, vast spaces, and light-colored wood. This makes for a very different, but unmistakably Parisian, atmosphere. The space also includes a florist, tea shop and bookstore.

Petit h shows another side of Hermès luxury, demonstrating how much the group strives to make high-quality products available while meeting clients’ expectations in terms of environmental responsibility and sustainable development. More recently, Hermès worked with Apple to create handcrafted leather bands for the Hermès Apple Watch, released October 2015. While this might seem a minor sales’ contributor (unfortunately, sales figures aren’t available), it created extensive media buzz.

Finally, the last plank of the Hermès strategy is its shareholding and management structures.

An independent family company

The group has been run almost exclusively by the family since its creation in 1837. At present, Axel Dumas (the sixth generation) is the sole manager. Company control has also essentially remained within the family since Hermès entered the Paris stock market in 1993. The only exception occurred between 2010 and 2014, at the time of the so-called “Hermès affair”, which was been laid out in “Hermès vs LVMH : A timeline of the drama”, in The Fashion Law.

By keeping control and capital within the family, Hermès has been able to maintain its independence and its unique long-term model. Between 2007 and 2016 the company’s turnover increased by a factor of 3.2 and their operating income quadrupled. As of July 10, 2017, the share price was valued at 442.40 euros. Hermès market capitalization was above 46.2 billion euros, which is 24 times its EBITDA, or nearly nine times its turnover.

A perfect combination of tradition and modernity, Hermès has been able to evolve while keeping an eye on the upcoming challenges. It has also taken measures towards the vertical integration of its supply chain, controlling its retail network, continuing a policy of no licensing and creating greater geographical and product diversification, to avoid overdependence on saddlery and leather goods.

Yet the company must ensure it does not overly rely on diversification, offering thousands of different products. Some lines could be discontinued, such as watch-making, which is constantly losing market share. Lastly, Hermès needs to embrace the digital revolution and offer an attractive online experience as a complement to their real-world boutiques.

Some 180 years after its birth, Hermès still excites the imagination of potential clients with unparalleled products, while generating profits and cash flows. At end 2016, its cash and cash equivalents amounted to 2.3 billion euros, with hardly any debt.

But what will the next step be? As a publically listed company, Hermès is required to be more forthcoming than it might prefer. Given its impressive war chest, it’s possible that the family – which bought back almost 70% of the company’s capital – may one day delist it to prevent a hostile takeover. Given the stock’s current valuation it would be an extremely costly move, but isn’t out of the question for a family that has always remained true to its roots and vision.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9998437166213989}",positive,0.9998437166213989,1

The world's biggest luxury-goods company said Japan was boosted by promotional activity like staging Louis Vuitton's latest runway show there, while Europe was helped by more favorable comparisons in France after a decline in tourism a year earlier. The Paris-based company sounded a cautious note about the second half, citing ""geopolitical and economic instability.""

LVMH's report Wednesday underlined a luxury industry recovery that began in China after a multiyear slowdown caused in part by a crackdown in corruption. The company's shares are up about 20 percent since the start of the year, as investors have welcomed the improved outlook and a €6.5 billion deal for LMVH to take full control of Christian Dior. In May, LVMH surpassed energy giant Total SA to become France's most valuable company.

""LVMH has enjoyed an excellent first half, to which all our businesses contributed,"" Chief Executive Officer Bernard Arnault said in a statement. ""In an environment that remains uncertain, we approach the second half of the year with caution.""

Profit from recurring operations rose 23 percent to €3.64 billion ($4.23 billion) in the first half, LVMH said. Analysts expected €3.61 billion. Second-quarter sales rose 12 percent on an organic basis, slower than the first quarter's 13 percent jump but above analyst predictions.

While sales gains in the second quarter were led by China, up 17 percent, Japan and Europe showed increases of 11 percent each. Luxury companies have been focusing promotional activity on a new shopping center in Tokyo.

""It's a pretty healthy situation in Japan, particularly the local customers,"" Chief Financial Officer Jean-Jacques Guiony said on a conference call.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9999988079071045}",positive,0.9999988079071045,1

LVMH’s fashion and leather goods category was its strongest performer, seeing revenues increase 17 per cent while profits jumped 34 per cent.

According to the company, this was largely driven by Louis Vuitton‘s introduction of new models and a collaboration with skateboarding brand Supreme.

Louis Vuitton may sell smartwatch - The Peninsula,"Wed, 12 Jul 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vdGhlcGVuaW5zdWxhcWF0YXIuY29tL2FydGljbGUvMTIvMDcvMjAxNy9Mb3Vpcy1WdWl0dG9uLW1heS1zZWxsLXNtYXJ0d2F0Y2jSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Bloomberg

Paris: LVMH wants to sell smartwatches to well-off fashionistas, introducing a techy timepiece under its Louis Vuitton suitcase brand that opens a higher-end front in the luxury conglomerate’s fightback against Apple Inc.

Louis Vuitton’s Tambour Horizon (pictured) starts at $2,450, about eight times the price of an entry-level Apple Watch and significantly more than many other connected devices from European watch and fashion brands, as well as more pedestrian gadgets from Samsung Electronics Co.

“We’ll see more luxury brands break up the smartwatch duopoly between Apple and Samsung,” said John Guy, an analyst at MainFirst Bank AG. “It not only provides consumers with a luxury option, where the aesthetic is more in harmony with technology, but it also provides a springboard for younger consumers to move into traditional Swiss watches at a later stage.”Within two years, Apple has become the world’s second-bestselling watch brand, outranked only by Rolex, disrupting sales of low-end makers and convincing LVMH that it needs to offer alternatives or risk falling behind. While low-end Swiss manufacturers such as Swatch Group AG’s namesake brand have introduced intelligent timepieces, exclusive makers like Rolex and Patek Philippe have largely steered clear for fear of sullying their image.Midrange Swiss labels like Breitling and LVMH’s TAG Heuer, specializing in sports watches, were among the first to recognize the disruptive potential of fitness bands that can monitor heart rates and track the wearer’s activities.

Now fashion brands are getting into wearable devices. Tommy Hilfiger and Hugo Boss each revealed models using Google’s Android platform at this year’s Baselworld watch expo in Switzerland, while Hermes started making leather straps for Apple Watches in 2015.

LVMH rival Richemont also recently dived into the market, offering a smartwatch under the Montblanc brand. Its $890 price tag, like those of connected timepieces from Swiss brands such as Mondaine, is well below that of Louis Vuitton’s Tambour Horizon. Last year Apple discontinued its line of 18-karat gold Apple Watches, which sold for as much as $17,000, moving toward the fitness market and adding health functions.

LVMH, which is France’s biggest company by market value, has tried to speed up the embrace of technology in recent years—bringing in former Apple Music executive Ian Rogers as chief digital officer in 2015 and launching two multibrand e-commerce sites this year for its fashion and beverage brands

Last year, LVMH bought Rimowa, a German suitcase maker whose products include luggage with electronic tags that let their owners know their whereabouts via Bluetooth. Louis Vuitton introduced €800 iPhone cases inspired by its monogrammed trunks last fall.

LVMH got about 9 percent of sales last year from watches and jewelry. Louis Vuitton’s traditional watches are produced in Switzerland.

The smartwatch’s case is assembled in that country and the watch uses technology developed in Silicon Valley, the company said in a statement that does not say where the inner workings are made","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999808073043823}",neutral,0.9999808073043823,0
