LVMH Shuffles Key Execs as Bernard Arnault Defines Succession Plan - WWD,"Thu, 21 Mar 2024 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3dkLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy1uZXdzL2h1bWFuLXJlc291cmNlcy9sdm1oLWV4ZWN1dGl2ZS1jaGFuZ2VzLWJlcm5hcmQtYXJuYXVsdC1zdWNjZXNzaW9uLTEyMzYyNzE2NTAv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS — In the latest chapter of a generational changing of the guard, LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton announced that Toni Belloni, one of Bernard Arnault’s most trusted lieutenants, will relinquish his key duties at the French luxury conglomerate and hand over his responsibilities to Stéphane Bianchi.

After more than 23 years working alongside Arnault, Belloni is to step down as group managing director and chairman of the executive committee of the LVMH group and leave the board of directors following the annual general meeting scheduled for April 18, LVMH said in a statement issued after the market close Thursday.

Bianchi, who has moved swiftly up the ranks since joining the group in 2018, will chair the executive committee and exercise, alongside Arnault, the strategic and operational supervision of the group’s brands, which range from Louis Vuitton and Dior to Tiffany & Co., Sephora and Moët & Chandon.

Previously president of LVMH’s watches and jewelry division, the 59-year-old will also oversee the presidents of the regions and the group’s digital and data transformation, the group said.

Belloni, who is 69, will be in charge of strategic missions for Arnault and will be appointed president of LVMH Italy. “The idea is not at all to stop working. But today, I wanted to have more time for others, and primarily for my family,” Belloni said.

The announcement comes as Arnault, who turned 75 this month, prepares his succession by tightening his family’s grip on the group’s leadership and transitioning some of his most senior executives to advisory roles.

At the AGM next month, LVMH will propose the appointments of his sons Alexandre Arnault and Frédéric Arnault to the board, as reported.

Alexandre Arnault, executive vice president of product and communications at Tiffany, and Frédéric Arnault, chief executive officer of LVMH Watches, will join their siblings Antoine Arnault, head of communication, image and environment at LVMH, and Delphine Arnault, chairman and CEO of Christian Dior Couture, on the board.

Meanwhile, group veteran Michael Burke has succeeded Sidney Toledano, 72, at the head of LVMH Fashion Group. Toledano left the executive committee and became an adviser to Arnault in the handover, which took effect on Feb. 1.

Arnault has shown no indication that he intends to retire. In 2022, LVMH shareholders voted in favor of a resolution to extend to 80 the age limit for him to serve as CEO. Previously, the company’s bylaws fixed 75 as the age limit.

The LVMH boss had hinted at a new role for Bianchi at the press conference in January where the group reported another year of record results.

“Since joining the group, Stéphane Bianchi has demonstrated rare leadership and management qualities while immersing himself in the group’s entrepreneurial and family culture,” Arnault said in Thursday’s statement.

While LVMH is known for growing and grooming executive talent from within, Bianchi spent a large portion of his career at the Yves Rocher Group, where he was CEO from 1998 to 2015, directly managing the Yves Rocher and Petit Bateau brands.

At LVMH, he initially focused on the watch maisons Tag Heuer, Hublot and Zenith, gradually adding the jewelry houses Tiffany, Bulgari, Chaumet, Fred and Repossi to his remit. LVMH did not name anyone to replace him in that position.

“I am delighted by his new role and am convinced that with Stéphane at my side, and with the entire executive committee and the group’s employees, we will take the success of the LVMH Group even further, while respecting our values and commitments,” Arnault said.

He credited Belloni with being instrumental to the growth of LVMH, which last year became the first European company to reach a $500 billion market value.

“Toni has been an essential partner for me and a very important member of the LVMH family. I would like to thank Toni for his exceptional contribution over the last few years,” Arnault said.

“Inspiring, curious and unfailingly loyal, he has participated in all the acquisitions of recent years and has supported the growth of the group and its teams with agility and pragmatism. His vision of luxury, of the markets, and his work with our teams have been considerable assets,” he added.

Belloni joined the French luxury giant in 2001 after a 22-year career at Procter & Gamble. He is widely credited with engineering the strategy that saw LVMH focus resources on star brands, while tailoring new strategies for the individual businesses.

He has also played a key role in dealmaking, including LVMH’s $16.2 billion acquisition of storied American jeweler Tiffany in 2019, its largest purchase to date.

“Never a dull moment!” Belloni said in summing up his tenure at the group.

“As I step down from my current role, I realize how fortunate I have been to play a leadership role at the heart of one of the most extraordinary entrepreneurial ventures of recent decades. I would like to thank Mr. Arnault most sincerely for the opportunity he has given me, and even more so for the trust he has always placed in me,” he added.

“Working alongside him has been a unique, stimulating experience, full of challenges and learning, with exemplarity as my compass,” he said. “We have achieved excellent results, always respecting our values and supporting numerous initiatives for the benefit of the greatest number of people. It is now up to Stéphane to take us even further.”

A graduate of the Institut d’Etudes Politiques de Paris, Bianchi started out as a consultant at Arthur Andersen. He described his first five years with LVMH as “rich, exciting and demanding,” as he pledged to “always and relentlessly” strengthen its success.

“By joining the LVMH group at the end of 2018, I made the choice to join a family group, chaired and led by a visionary man, and carrying values to which I am deeply committed: legacy, long-term vision, timeless desirability of our maisons and products, and a permanent quest for excellence in all our actions,” he said.

LVMH said the board of directors meeting on April 18 would also be asked to appoint Chinese American businesswoman and lawyer Wei Sun Christianson as a director. Christianson has a lengthy career in finance, serving as CEO China and co-CEO, Asia Pacific, for Morgan Stanley, where she worked for close to 20 years.

“Wei Sun Christianson’s financial culture, her understanding of the luxury goods market and above all her in-depth and invaluable knowledge of China will be invaluable assets for the board of directors,” Arnault said."
Glossier & LVMH: A Love Story? - Puck - Puck,"Wed, 27 Mar 2024 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiLWh0dHBzOi8vcHVjay5uZXdzL2dsb3NzaWVyLWx2bWgtYS1sb3ZlLXN0b3J5L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"SHARE

It seems like everyone in the beauty business has a banker these days: After all, Glossier, Rare, Summer Fridays, Merit, and Kosas are all exploring sales to capitalize on strong growth. But the market maker, of course, is Glossier—the once white-hot, once category-defining millennial-ish brand, which I reported last week had hired Morgan Stanley as a financial advisor. Now, I’m reliably told, Glossier is in “deep” conversations with LVMH regarding a potential acquisition. The French conglomerate—owner of Louis Vuitton, Dior, Celine, and Sephora—is particularly interested in Glossier’s expanding fragrance offerings, which includes its popular “You” scent. “It’s part of the hook that they’re presenting to LVMH,” a source said. “They have this number one fragrance––they’re not just selling Cloud Paint. That’s why they’re worth $2 billion.”

Indeed, Glossier You was Sephora’s best-selling scent in 2023, no small feat considering the staggering, almost nauseating amount of Sol de Janeiro body spray the retailer moves—not to mention blockbusters from the usual suspects (Saint Laurent, Valentino, Dior, Chanel, etcetera). Sure, it only costs $72, a steal in a world where Tom Ford Vanilla Sex (not a joke) goes for $395 a bottle. But it also smells really good. Founder Emily Weiss, who doesn’t do anything half-assed, tapped master perfumer Frank Voelkl, the nose behind Le Labo’s Santal 33, to craft the scent."

No name is perhaps more synonymous with the world of luxury goods than Bernard Arnault.

Arnault, the 75-year-old CEO of French luxury conglomerate LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, or just LVMH for short, built his fortune over the span of almost four decades, amassing a luxury-goods empire that includes some of the best-known brands in fashion, jewelry, and alcohol, including Louis Vuitton, TAG Heuer, and Dom Pérignon.

Earlier this week, he reclaimed the title of the world's richest person, and has a net worth of about $201 billion, according to Bloomberg. He, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, and Tesla CEO Elon Musk have traded places on and off over the past year.

Along the way to the top, Arnault has brought his five adult children into the fold, building a family-run business that has resulted in immense wealth and even drawn comparisons to the hit HBO show Succession (which Arnault has dismissed).

Arnault is now in talks to add French magazine, Paris Match, to his growing empire for around $109 million, according to the Wall Street Journal. While the acquisition might be little more than pocket change for the multi-billionaire, Paris Match's value comes from its social influence. The magazine has long been known for chronicling the upper echelons of French society, according to the Journal.

Here's a closer look at how Arnault and his family rose to the top:"

Bianchi will chair the group’s executive committee, and, alongside Bernard Arnault, take up strategic and operational supervision of the group’s labels, the company said.

Bianchi, who joined LVMH in 2018, has moved up quickly through the ranks. He started out as chief executive of watch label Tag Heuer and the watchmaking division of the company. Two years later, his division was enlarged to encompass jewelry, and now includes Tiffany & Co.

LVMH also said that it would nominate Wei Sun Christianson to the board of directors at its annual general meeting on April 18.

Michael Burke Hires a Deputy from Louis Vuitton at LVMH Fashion Group - WWD,"Wed, 06 Mar 2024 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3dkLmNvbS9mYXNoaW9uLW5ld3MvZGVzaWduZXItbHV4dXJ5L2x2bWgtZmFzaGlvbi1ncm91cC1kZXB1dHktYW5nZWxvZ2xvdS1idXJrZS0xMjM2MjQ4NzA3L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS — Making his first major hire as chairman and chief executive officer of fast-growing LVMH Fashion Group, Michael Burke has brought over Louis Vuitton executive Pierre-Emmanuel Angeloglou to become his deputy, WWD has learned.

Executive vice president, strategic missions, at Vuitton since 2022 and a key builder of its menswear business, Angeloglou officially starts Monday as managing director of LVMH Fashion Group, reporting directly to Burke.

Angeloglou is to take over the direct responsibility for Fendi, Kenzo, Marc Jacobs, Pucci, Stella McCartney, Patou and Off-White, while the Fashion Group’s largest and fastest-growing properties, Celine and Loewe, fall directly under Burke.

The executive was spotted not far from Burke’s elbow at several shows during Paris Fashion Week, which wrapped on Tuesday.

“I am delighted to team up again with Pierre-Emmanuel,” Burke said in a statement shared exclusively with WWD, calling Angeloglou a “key player” in Vuitton’s success story.

“His capacity to articulate a compelling vision, coupled with the empowerment vested in his teams, will enable the Fashion Group Division to fully embrace the objective of heightening the magic of these extraordinary maisons, with their amazing capacity for innovation and their unique history and savoir-faire,” Burke commented.

A seasoned L’Oréal executive, Angeloglou was global brand president of L’Oréal Paris, the world’s largest beauty label, when he joined Vuitton in 2019, initially as strategic missions director for fashion and leather goods.

He was handed responsibility for its men’s division in 2020, then exploding under creative director Virgil Abloh. Under Burke’s guidance, Angeloglou built the men’s business up to 5 billion euros, market sources estimate.

Angeloglou took on increasing responsibilities at Vuitton as an executive vice president, also adding women’s accessories, digital innovation, visual merchandising and communication to his remit.

Prior to steering L’Oréal Paris, Angeloglou for three years held the position of general manager of L’Oréal’s Consumer Products Division in North Asia and for four years oversaw that division in Brazil, according to his LinkedIn profile.

Angeloglou was also general manager of Lascad in Paris and global vice president of L’Oréal Paris skin care. He joined L’Oréal in 1996, starting as a product manager in Italy and then France. He holds degrees from HEC Paris and CEMS.

In a major changing of the guard at LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton involving two of the industry’s most accomplished and admired executives, Burke succeeded Sidney Toledano at the head of LVMH Fashion Group last month.

Toledano become an adviser to LVMH chairman and CEO Bernard Arnault, a responsibility he took up alongside roles at the Paris fashion school IFM, French fashion’s governing body, and family commitments.

Last year, Michael Burke bowed out of Vuitton after a stellar 10-year tenure as its chairman and CEO, during which revenues tripled to exceed 21 billion euros, with profitability leaping fourfold, according to market sources."
The Real Reasons LVMH Is Embracing Entertainment - The Business of Fashion,"Fri, 01 Mar 2024 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzb2ZmYXNoaW9uLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy9tYXJrZXRpbmctcHIvdW5wYWNraW5nLWx2bWgtZW50ZXJ0YWlubWVudC12ZW50dXJlL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Last week, when LVMH announced the launch of 22 Montaigne Entertainment, a central platform to connect its 75 maisons with the entertainment industry, the move was about more than trying to capitalise on audiences eager to watch stories about brands from Barbie to Nike.

It was also a survival plan for a world where traditional forms of mass-media advertising are losing their effectiveness.

“Most people now consume their entertainment through various streaming services, and a lot of people, particularly the more affluent people, pay to not have their entertainment interrupted by advertising,” said Anish Melwani, chief executive of LVMH North America. “Of course we’re going to continue with our campaigns and things like that. But it increases the importance of having these amazing stories that are part of the heritage of our brands.”

Viewers are as hungry as ever for entertainment, but how they consume it is changing. Fashion is part of the stream of content they’re gobbling up alongside — and often in connection with — music, art and sport, a state of affairs Louis Vuitton underscored with its appointment of musician Pharrell Williams as men’s artistic director. Some of the industry’s biggest players are now creating more formal ties to the entertainment business. Last April, Saint Laurent announced a film production unit, while in September, Artémis, the holding company of Kering owner François Pinault, bought a majority stake in Hollywood talent agency CAA.

LVMH has been working with studios for years, resulting in projects from the 2014 documentary “Dior and I” to the new Apple TV series “The New Look,” for which Dior provided clothing. But the entertainment industry often didn’t know how to get in touch with LVMH’s maisons, or in some cases that they even were part of LVMH, Melwani said. While the initiative is not actually a new division in the company, what it’s meant to do is create a single point of contact to facilitate these relationships, though approval of any project still lies with LVMH’s individual brands.

For assistance, LVMH has partnered with Superconnector Studios, whose stated mission is to help brands and entertainment “both find new ways to reach consumers and drive revenue in a world where ads have never been less popular.” Its founders are former CAA agent and producer John Kaplan and advertising veteran Jae Goodman, who previously worked with Nike to build Waffle Iron Entertainment, a venture that has yielded sports documentaries and a multiyear deal with Apple that includes three scripted projects.

“Everybody dumped their brand advertising into lower-funnel performance marketing,” Goodman said. “It didn’t really work just going direct-to-consumer on the brand side … We saw these two industries looking at each other saying, ‘It’s very clear we need each other.’”

The challenge for both is to create engaging stories that don’t feel like an ad but bring the benefits of one.

Branded Entertainment

While social media made it easier for brands to connect directly with customers, rather than having to rely on magazines and television to convey much of their messaging, the returns have diminished over the years. Customer-acquisition costs have soared, privacy measures have made it harder to target the right audiences and consumers inundated with ads are tuning out. A 2023 report by marketing data and analytics firm Kantar found 86 percent of viewers took actions to avoid ads across TV, streaming and online.

With that, many companies are putting a renewed emphasis on brand marketing that tries to build deeper emotional connections with consumers — and studies find audiences are more likely to react positively to branded content than traditional advertising. Entertainment offers another channel for this form of brand building, as Goodman and Kaplan see it.

It happens that Hollywood is looking for intellectual property to turn into movies or TV series, and the blockbuster success of last year’s “Barbie” movie further proved there’s commercial appeal in stories about consumer brands.

These projects don’t need to reach “Barbie” levels of success to be worthwhile for brands, however. Though Nike wasn’t behind its making, the 2023 movie “Air” about the company’s signing of Michael Jordan and the creation of its Air Jordan line generated a noticeable amount of buzz around the Nike brand and caused an uptick in its net promoter score, a measure of brand favourability, according to data from intelligence firm Morning Consult. ESPN’s 2020 documentary series “The Last Dance,” about Michael Jordan and the Chicago Bulls, similarly boosted sales of the Jordan 1.

“You aren’t going to see jaw dropping [return on investment] in terms of long-term consumer metrics, but you will see positive movement,” said Joanna Piacenza, head of industry analysis at Morning Consult.

What these entertainment projects also offer is a way for brands to take IP that’s proved successful in one arena and monetise it in others, a strategy entertainment giants like Disney pioneered.

“The media companies have done a great job of developing original IP, putting it on the TV screen or in the movie theatre and then monetising it through theme parks, consumer products, video games, live events,” said John Harrison, media and entertainment leader at EY Americas. “This is almost the opposite of that, where you’ve got IP that’s already monetised through these other channels that consumers have great familiarity with, and then you’re building an original story around that IP.”

In LVMH’s case, most of its brands aren’t household names on the level of Nike or Barbie, which could potentially make it difficult to get audiences to tune in. Entertainment, however, offers a way to get audiences to care, and streaming platforms make it easier for smaller stories that appeal to a niche demographic to be able to find their viewers.

“There’s a huge opportunity for brands that are not as well known to leverage this kind of storytelling to boost brand awareness, especially if the content is compelling,” Piacenza said.

The “Story” in Storytelling

No matter how big or beloved a brand may be, there’s no guarantee audiences will enjoy the resulting product. “The New Look,” for instance, has earned just a 57-percent positive rating on review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes.

LVMH’s Melwani acknowledged there’s a level of risk in letting someone else tell a brand’s story. But luxury is in the business of storytelling, and while LVMH is expert in communicating its maisons’ stories through product, fashion shows and exhibitions, entertainment is not its métier, he said. It needs writers and directors for that. Besides, if a brand isn’t excited by the storytellers’ vision, it doesn’t have to participate.

Of course, even if the brand is on board, a good narrative usually demands conflict and tension, which means the brand’s origins may not always be depicted in the best light.

“Brands need to be smart in terms of how they structure these production deals and whether there’s ultimately some veto [power],” Harrison said. But there is “a fine balance between giving your entertainment partners creative flexibility and also protecting what you’ve built in terms of brand value.”

“You also don’t want to turn off the creative types that you’re working with,” he added.

A giant like LVMH at least has the benefit of numerous brands with interesting backstories. Bernard Arnault has often been attracted to brands with a great history, noted luxury consultant Robert Burke. It’s not hard to imagine a project or series about Tiffany in the future, or perhaps Fendi or even champagne house Dom Pérignon.

“To then be able to offer that viewer the physical experience of the brand [through the product] is really powerful,” Burke said.

The entertainment industry looks to be interested in helping out.

“Our switchboard has lit up with every studio, every talent agency, every A-list production company and, in some cases, specific talent,” said Superconnector’s Kaplan.

The trick now is to tell the right stories.

LVMH Prize Semifinalists Talk Craftsmanship and Inclusivity - WWD,"Fri, 01 Mar 2024 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3dkLmNvbS9mYXNoaW9uLW5ld3MvZmFzaGlvbi1mZWF0dXJlcy9sdm1oLXByaXplLXNlbWlmaW5hbGlzdHMtcGFyaXMtZmFzaGlvbi13ZWVrLXNob3dyb29tLTEyMzYyMzM4MjQv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS — Celebrities and designers turned out Thursday evening to check out the creations of the 20 talents shortlisted for the LVMH Prize for Young Designers.

Dior ambassadors Jennifer Lawrence and Xin Liu were among the first to arrive at the headquarters of luxury conglomerate LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton on Avenue Montaigne, welcomed by cheering fans who waited outside despite the blustery weather.

Inside, Paris Jackson and models Jessica Stam, Coco Rocha and Liya Kebede mingled with designers including Proenza Schouler’s Jack McCollough and Lazaro Hernandez, jeweler Victoire de Castellane and milliner Stephen Jones.

LVMH executives were also out in force, led by Bernard Arnault, chairman and chief executive officer of the French luxury conglomerate; his daughter Delphine Arnault, the force behind the prize and a key talent scout at LVMH, and son Antoine Arnault, the group’s head of communication, image and environment.

Touring the showroom earlier in the day, Delphine Arnault noted the semifinalists were chosen from among more than 2,500 applications and were a good gauge of trends. “It’s already a huge achievement to be here,” she said of the annual event.

“It’s different from seeing it on a screen, as we did not meet with them in person during the selection process. It’s always very interesting to see them here and hear their thoughts, and also to find out how their personality is reflected in the product and how they express their vision,” she added.

The executive, who is also chairman and chief executive officer of Christian Dior Couture, was looking forward to handing out a new award, the Savoir-Faire Prize.

“These are often small companies that are still growing. They do a lot of things by hand, and passing on that know-how is crucial,” Arnault noted. “It’s wonderful to add this new dimension to the prize. It’s important and it also reflects our current concerns.”

“For people to have a view of things in person, up close, it’s a real game-changer for my work especially,” he said. “There are techniques that are developed that you may not see in an image so clearly.”

Irish designer Michael Stewart flipped through a portfolio to show how he crafts the forms that underpin his sculptural jersey creations for his womenswear label Standing Ground.

Stewart does everything himself. “I really love to work with my hands,” the Royal College of Art graduate explained. “I don’t sketch and have someone else. It has to be me from the very beginning.”

Antoine Arnault Dominique Maître for WWD

South Korean designer Jiyong Kim explained how he uses sun bleaching to create the patterns for his menswear designs under the Jiyongkim label. He hangs garments on a fence and then waits.

“This took a month, actually, but it really depends on the weather,” he said of a black raincoat with ghostly markings. “We cannot control the weather, so every piece is unique.”

Kim, who has more than 20 stockists including Browns, Dover Street Market and Ssense, said he would use the prize money to hire more staff and invest in spaces to house the large-scale installations he uses to showcase his work, instead of fashion shows.

Karoline Vitto would spend the cash on R&D and production. The Brazilian designer, known for her size-inclusive creations, sells direct-to-consumer, mostly in the U.S. and Australia.

“Now it’s the time for us to scale and we would love to go into wholesale and have a bit more of a cash predictability,” she said. She offers outfits in U.K. sizes 8 to 28, which is challenging for manufacturers, who usually take orders in up to five sizes.

“All the pattern grading is done in-house manually,” she said. “As we grow, we need to scale that process. In the next collections, we want to go through maybe new product categories that have a little bit of a more simple grading structure where we can do it digitally.”

Vitto hopes her presence will spark interest among larger brands that have yet to embrace a body-positive approach. “There’s a few of us who are small brands that are doing it, so why are the big players not catching up?” she asked.

Simon Porte Jacquemus Dominique Maître for WWD

The LVMH Prize — which last year was won by Setchu by Satoshi Kuwata — has helped propel the careers of such talents as Marine Serre, Nensi Dojaka, Thebe Magugu, Grace Wales Bonner and Simon Porte Jacquemus, who was also in attendance and took his time to check out all the semifinalists.

“Just right now I discovered this New York-based designer,” he said, pointing to Jacques Agbobly, whose booth was located near the entrance.

The Togolese-born designer, who last October received the inaugural WWD Honor for One to Watch, won plaudits for their colorful creations, but also their engaging personality. “[They’re] really charming, [they’re] the one I will remember,” said Jacquemus, who has a cult following on social media and understands the power of charisma.

“I grew up watching a lot of these people on my screen, so it’s been wonderful just to get some face time with them and get to share my world with them,” Agbobly told WWD.

“This year, I’m the only African brand, and it was really important for me to share that Africa is not just this faraway thing, that we deserve to be center stage in the global fashion conversation,” they added.

Tela D’Amore and Everard Best of U.S. brand Who Decides War showed creations including pants made from upcycled motorcycle jackets. “It is redefining Americana through the lens of people of color,” D’Amore explained.

Who Decides War collaborated with Off-White on a 2019 collection, and Best was inspired by the example of that brand’s founder Virgil Abloh, who was a finalist of the 2015 edition of the prize and by 2021 was a member of the jury in his capacity as creative director of menswear at Louis Vuitton.

“We’re just following in his footsteps and just hope one day we could do as much as he did,” he said, noting that Abloh set the template for self-taught designers.

“Basically, my dad’s a tailor, his parents were tailors, and he was able to pass down the trade. Going to design school wasn’t really a thing for me,” Best remarked. “I think now it’s like, OK, you don’t have to go to Parsons or FIT to be a designer, you just have to put the time in.”

The other semifinalists are Aubero by Julian Louie; Campillo by Patricio Campillo; Chiahung Su by Chia Hung Su; Duran Lantink; Elena Velez; Fidan Novruzova; Hodakova by Ellen Hodakova Larsson; Khoki by Koki Abe; Marie Adam-Leenaerdt; Niccolò Pasqualetti; Paolo Carzana; Pauline Dujancourt; Ponder.er by Derek Cheng and Alex Po; Vautrait by Yonathan Carmel and Ya Yi by Yayi Chen Zhou.

Asked if he had any advice for young designers, Jacquemus said: “The best advice is no advice, because everyone will give you their opinion. Follow your heart and at the end you will never be disappointed. It works for life in general. Believe in yourself, and you never make the wrong choice.”

Charles de Vilmorin, a finalist in 2021, said it was important for the contestants to preserve their uniqueness.

“It’s not very original, but for me the most important thing for them is to stay themselves,” he said. “I think the right question to ask to yourself when you create a collection is: ‘Why is it only me who can make this collection and not another one?’”

As she made her rounds, Stam said she hoped to be surprised. “Especially when times are uncertain, we need more creativity and to dive deeper into that,” she opined.

Rocha, on the other, believes there is no such thing as a new shape. “As much as people like to say ‘This is a new idea,’ I have never seen a new idea,” she said. “But I do appreciate when people try to take [something] and spin it.”

The model praised the format of the event. “I know that there’s other programs that do what LVMH is doing right now. However, it’s nice to see [designers] in the room with their work and being able to talk to them. It’s like they have the chance to network all by themselves,” she said. “If you don’t win, you probably get some phone numbers.”"
LVMH managing director Toni Belloni to step down - Vogue Business,"Thu, 21 Mar 2024 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZvZ3VlYnVzaW5lc3MuY29tL3N0b3J5L2NvbXBhbmllcy9sdm1oLW1hbmFnaW5nLWRpcmVjdG9yLXRvbmktYmVsbG9uaS10by1zdGVwLWRvd27SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Sign up to receive the Vogue Business newsletter for the latest luxury news and insights, plus exclusive membership discounts.

LVMH’s management reshuffle continues. Toni Belloni, group managing director of LVMH and chairman of its executive committee, will relinquish his duties and leave the board of directors following its annual general meeting on 18 April, the company announced on Thursday.

Belloni will remain in charge of “strategic missions” for LVMH founder, CEO and chairman Bernard Arnault and will become president of LVMH Italy.

Stéphane Bianchi, who’s currently CEO of the watches and jewellery division, will succeed Belloni, meaning he will chair the group’s executive committee and oversee the presidents of the regions and the group’s digital and data transformation.

Belloni has been a key force in the acquisitions of the group, notably Tiffany and Bulgari. “At my side as group managing director and member of the board of directors for over two decades, Toni has been a major contributor to the success of LVMH. Inspiring, curious and unfailingly loyal, he has participated in all the acquisitions of recent years and has supported the growth of the group and its teams with agility and pragmatism,” Arnault said in a statement. During Belloni’s tenure as group managing director, LVMH’s annual revenue went from €12.2 billion in 2001 to €86.2 billion in 2023.

The change is part of a wider reorganisation of LVMH’s top management. In 2023, Pietro Beccari succeeded Michael Burke as chairman and CEO of Louis Vuitton, and this year, Michael Burke replaced Sidney Toledano at the helm of LVMH Fashion Group."
Citi Sells Investors LVMH Exposure With Rare Exchangeable Bond - Yahoo Finance,"Wed, 27 Mar 2024 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9jaXRpLXNlbGxzLWludmVzdG9ycy1sdm1oLWV4cG9zdXJlLTE3MzAxNDc4My5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"(Bloomberg) -- Citigroup Global Markets Holdings Inc. offered convertible bond investors a chance to get exposure to fashion and fine wine conglomerate LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE with an unusual exchangeable note.

Most Read from Bloomberg

The bank marketed up to €400 million ($433 million) of guaranteed cash-settled exchangeable bonds due April 2029 referable to LVMH ordinary shares, with the final issue size set at €380 million. Under the arrangement, investors don’t actually receive LVMH stock but instead the cash equivalent. The notes carry a 1% coupon and the exchange price was to be set at a 25% premium over the reference share price, according to a statement.

The sale comes after fellow investment bank JPMorgan Chase & Co. attempted a similar transaction last week but decided not to go ahead with it, according to a document seen by Bloomberg.

Exchangeable bonds of this nature are relatively rare in European markets and effectively are a means for banks to sell an upside call on a stock in the publicly syndicated market.

Investment banks typically issue such bonds linked to large, well known stocks such as LVMH, Sanofi and Microsoft Corp. They fill the gap when there is a quiet period for new convertible bonds.

Citi itself issued such a bond last year linked to fashion brand L’Oreal SA, while Barclays Plc sold notes linked to German automaker Daimler in 2022. JPMorgan already has a note linked to LVMH shares in circulation, bonds that come due in June this year.

Citi’s offer was expected to price later on Wednesday.

The company, a subsidiary of LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE, has been making garments out of wool from vicuñas — big-eyed, golden-brown animals native to the Andes — for three decades, selling them for thousands of dollars each.

But a Bloomberg Businessweek report last week detailed how the trade has failed to improve the livelihoods of some of Peru’s poorest citizens, who share territory with the vicuña and shear the animals for Loro Piana.

“This seems to me as clearly exploitation and it is a huge multinational corporation that is owned by some of the wealthiest people in the world,” Congressman Robert Garcia said in an interview. “Seeing no benefit coming down to the immense labour that is happening here I think is really concerning.”

Garcia sent a letter Friday to Loro Piana Chairman Antoine Arnault and chief executive Damien Bertrand demanding the company provide written answers to Congress by the end of April. Arnault is the son of Bernard Arnault, who controls LVMH and is currently the world’s richest person, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.

“Despite the success of Loro Piana, the Indigenous people of this region remain deeply impoverished,” Garcia wrote in the letter, a copy of which was seen by Bloomberg. “This is little evidence the benefits of the return of vicuñas population has trickled down to those it should be benefiting most.”

Asked about the congressman’s letter, Loro Piana noted it has worked to help preserve the vicuña population for three decades. “We have also increased our investments in irrigation, education, and infrastructures in Peru over the past years, and we are committed to dedicating additional resources to benefit local populations going forward,” the company said in an emailed statement.

The comments mark the first time the company has addressed the story since its publication. It has also stopped updating its social media accounts, such as Instagram, where hundreds of users have criticised its practices.

Pierre-Emmanuel Angeloglou, currently executive vice president in charge of strategic missions at Louis Vuitton, will move to the unit overseen by Michael Burke, an LVMH veteran, said people familiar with the move.

Angeloglou, 49, previously reported to Burke when the latter headed Louis Vuitton. Burke, 67, took oversight of the LVMH fashion group earlier this year from Sidney Toledano, another longtime executive at the Paris-based company. The unit also includes brands Marc Jacobs, Givenchy and Fendi.

Louis Vuitton and Christian Dior, the two biggest fashion labels of LVMH, are not part of the unit.

LVMH representatives didn’t immediately respond when asked for comment.

Angeloglou joined Louis Vuitton in 2019 as director for fashion and leather goods, as well as strategic missions, according to his LinkedIn profile. In his role, he’s overseen Louis Vuitton men’s products, women’s accessories, digital innovation as well as communication and events.

He previously spent more than two decades at L’Oréal SA, where his final role was global brand president at L’Oréal Paris. He graduated from business school HEC Paris in 1996.

LVMH, headed by billionaire Bernard Arnault, is seeking to prepare its next generation of leaders as some of the group’s most senior executives near the end of their careers. Arnault’s top lieutenants have also played a role in training his five children, who all work inside the luxury conglomerate.

Arnault turned 75 on Tuesday and the LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE statutes allow him to stay as chief executive officer until he’s 80.

Steve Jobs once asked LVMH boss Bernard Arnault for advice on opening Apple Stores when his peers thought it was ... - Yahoo Finance,"Tue, 05 Mar 2024 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9zdGV2ZS1qb2JzLW9uY2UtYXNrZWQtbHZtaC0xMjAwMDA4MTYuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"A little less Best Buy, a little more Louis Vuitton. While conceptualizing the very first Apple Stores, the late Steve Jobs wanted the iPhone maker’s retail experience to evoke luxury flagship stores—much to his peers’ criticism.

In search of guidance, Jobs turned to the king of luxury (and future richest man in the world, for a time): Bernard Arnault.

Up until the turn of the millennium, Apple products were sold at retailers like Sears and CompUSA. Dissatisfied with the customer experience at the big-box stores, Jobs pushed for Apple to open its own standalone stores. Jobs asked Arnault, the founder and CEO of LVMH, for his advice on opening Apple Stores in the same areas as Louis Vuitton’s prime retail locations.

“Everybody thought it's completely crazy to sell Apple products in a shop,” Arnault said in a 2016 interview at the Oxford Union. “I remember at the time, Michael Dell saying it’s completely crazy, it will never work.”

Arnault himself was unsure about the Apple cofounder’s retail vision—but he didn’t hesitate to give him advice. “I must say, I was myself a little doubtful of selling [iPods in shops,]” said Arnault, who surpassed Elon Musk as richest man in the world back in 2022 but now holds the title of third-richest. “But it was working.”

In the 2016 interview, Arnault praised Jobs’ long-term vision—a mindset shared by the Frenchman in his quest to bring his heritage houses into the future. Over the course of five decades, Arnault turned a struggling clothing manufacturer into a luxury conglomerate comprising over 75 iconic brands, including Louis Vuitton, Dior, and Sephora.

“What I have in mind every morning is that the desirability of a brand should be as strong in 10 years,” Arnault, who has amassed a personal fortune of $199 billion, told Forbes in 2019.

Manufacturing Desire

Part of LVMH’s key to success is capturing something intangible: “The most important word in our business is desire, how to create desire,” Arnault said at the Oxford Union event.

Story continues

And it’s not as simple as just having top-quality $3,000 handbags and $10,000 watches—or iPods or iPhones, for that matter. “When you have the product, then you have to create good environments in the shops, and you have to present it well,” Arnault said. “Good films if it’s a perfume, good advertisements either in magazines or on the internet if it’s a product.”

Similar to the late Jobs, Arnault stressed the importance of customer experience. In 2019, amid negotiations to acquire Tiffany & Co., an executive gave Arnault a tour of the luxury jeweler’s flagship store in New York.

""We got lost in the building,"" Arnault told The Wall Street Journal last year. ""Here is a guy getting lost in his own shop. I said, 'We have some work to do on this.'""

After LVMH completed its $15.8 billion takeover of Tiffany in 2021, Arnault ordered a complete revamp of the flagship Fifth Avenue location. The Journal estimated that the renovation cost $500 million, citing analysts. Arnault did not confirm or deny the figure.

""You cannot dream when you talk numbers,” he told the Journal. “When you create desire, profits are a consequence.""

And the profits are certainly rolling in: LVMH reported revenue of $93.46 billion in 2023—13% organic growth from the previous year. Arnault’s net worth reached an all-time high of $207.8 billion in January, but it has since contracted to $199 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Meanwhile, Forbes lists the Arnault family fortune as the world’s largest, at $228.8 billion.

The Perfect Paradox

Two decades later, Apple Stores revolutionized tech retail as we know it. There are now more than 500 Apple Stores in over 25 countries, each generating between $40 million and $100 million annually, according to Bloomberg.

The Apple of today has much in common with some of LVMH’s flagship brands—long lines, high prices, premium experiences. But according to Arnault, Apple is missing the key “paradox” that defines a luxury brand. “You have to have the combination between modernity and timelessness,” Arnault explained at the Oxford Union.

Arnault remembers asking Jobs a question about the future of Apple: “Do you think, Steve, that your telephone is going to work as successfully in 20 years?” Jobs admitted that he didn’t know, because of the ever-evolving nature of the tech industry.

“That’s the difference between us,” Arnault remembers telling Jobs. “Because my Dom Pérignon, I can guarantee you it will be sold and successful in 20 years.”

LVMH-owned Sephora is proving the ‘lipstick effect’ is real - Fortune,"Tue, 05 Mar 2024 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vZm9ydHVuZS5jb20vZXVyb3BlLzIwMjQvMDMvMDUvbHZtaC1zZXBob3JhLW1ha2V1cC1saXBzdGljay1lZmZlY3QtZ3Jvd3RoLWVjb25vbWljLWRvd250dXJuL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"When budgets get tight, there’s nothing a tube of lipstick can’t solve. Or at least, that’s what economists seem to believe. Even when people are scrambling to save every last penny, the “lipstick effect” has proved time and again that shoppers will indulge in small luxuries as a compromise since they can’t spend on big ones.

Cosmetics giant Sephora couldn’t be happier about it.

The LVMH-owned chain, which performed “exceptionally” in 2023, was the French conglomerate’s fastest-growing segment by sales at a time when luxury spending has been on a roller coaster ride. Sephora contributed to a 76% profit rise in the selective retailing segment, which includes duty-free shops, and raked in €17.9 billion ($19.4 billion) in sales last year.

Now Sephora is eyeing more growth in the coming years as people continue spending on its makeup and skin care products, the company’s CEO Guillaume Motte said.

“I think that Sephora has the potential to reach €20bn in sales…[and] the reality of our 2023 performance confirms this dream, and even tells me that we will undoubtedly reach it sooner rather than later,” Motte told the Financial Times in comments published Tuesday.

The Sephora chief also added that the “lipstick effect,” a term coined in 2001 by Estée Lauder heir Leonard Lauder to describe how people boosted lipstick sales during periods of economic downturn to treat themselves in small ways, had a part to play in Sephora’s heyday.

“We have a product that makes people happy, an accessible product. Are we going to have explosive growth? The answer is no. Am I concerned? The answer is also no,” Motte told the FT. He added that much of 2023’s expansion was driven by in-store sales as people got to experience different brands on display at Sephora stores.

Representatives at Sephora didn’t immediately return Fortune’s request for comment.

LVMH bright spot

Sephora was clearly a bright spot for LVMH through 2023. The French behemoth’s head, Bernard Arnault, described its growth as “remarkable” during an earnings call in January. The beauty chain’s performance is a contrast from the peak pandemic years when low foot traffic in Sephora’s retail locations hurt its revenue and profitability. (Bear in mind, that’s when luxury demand boomed.)

In 2022, as lockdowns were eased and people began venturing out of their homes again, Sephora’s sales rebounded. Interestingly, that’s also the year inflation hit record highs (at least in recent memory) and drove up the cost of living, pointing to the “lipstick effect” in action. Inflation has cooled since, but interest rates remain elevated and consumer confidence is still on shaky ground.

“Being short of money is psychologically daunting for people, and the way to make yourself feel better, even if it’s ever so little, is to purchase something that you think will cheer you up,” Cathrine Jansson-Boyd, associate professor in consumer psychology at Anglia Ruskin University, told the BBC in 2022.

Sephora isn’t alone in the rising tide that is increasing sales of beauty products. Take the company’s American rival Ulta Beauty, for instance. Its sales have soared through 2023 as shoppers are “ready to celebrate” amid a challenging economic environment, CEO Dave Kimbell said.

To be sure, the theory of lipstick sales and economic health being inversely proportional can be hard to break down in the broader beauty category. The economic indicator also didn’t really apply for the Great Recession of 2007–2009, and has had competition with other products like face masks in recent years.

Whether tubes of lipstick will reign supreme in future economic crises remains to be seen. For now, at least, people clearly aren’t shying away from splurging a little on their favorite beauty products."

The para-athlete, who’s known as the “White Cheetah” for his on-track speed and agility, was also revealed as a brand ambassador for Louis Vuitton, the luxury house and its parent group said Tuesday.

Adolphe, who specializes in 60-meter to 400-meter distances, will compete in the T11 categories for the upcoming 100-meter and 400-meter Paralympic events.

A silver medalist at the Paralympic Games in Tokyo in 2021 and the 100 meters and 400-meter world champion in 2019, he holds the world record at 60 meters and the European one for 200 meters.

Named a knight of France’s Ordre National du Mérite in 2021, the French athlete was also bronze medalist in the 100-meter and 400-meter events at last year’s World Para Athletics Championships in Paris.

“By his determination and talent, he conquered the world of sport,” the French luxury house declared. “[He] will bring his contagious energy and his spirit of conquest to this collaboration, [while] his track record illustrates perfectly the values of excellence and daring dear to Louis Vuitton.”

Off the track Adolphe is a keen musician who released his first EP in June 2021, before following it up with a single after his experience at the Tokyo Paralympic Games.

A long-term advocate for better access and autonomy for people with disabilities, he also developed the first inclusive multiplayer video game where sighted and visually impaired gamers can play together. The latter are guided by binaural audio that creates an immersive experience for in-game positioning.

Adolphe joins rugby player Antoine Dupont, swimmer Léon Marchand and fencer Enzo Lefort, who were previously tapped by Vuitton and LVMH.

A premium partner of the Paris 2024 Olympic and Paralympic Games, the luxury conglomerate has extended financial support to a cohort of Olympic and Paralympic athletes that includes gymnast Mélanie de Jesus dos Santos, wheelchair-tennis’ Pauline Déroulède and para-cyclist Marie Patouillet. The three are ambassadors for Dior.

In addition to this, further brands under LVMH’s umbrella are playing roles at the event.

These include Sephora, a partner for the Olympic Torch Relay set to kick off in the southern French city of Marseille on May 8; Chaumet, whose design for the Olympic and Paralympic medals includes a piece of the Eiffel tower, and Berluti, which is set to dress the French teams for the opening ceremonies slated for July 26 for the Olympic Games and Aug. 28 for the Paralympics."

Ideally, a business will show two trends; firstly a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an increasing amount of capital employed. If you see this, it typically means it's a company with a great business model and plenty of profitable reinvestment opportunities. That's why when we briefly looked at LVMH Moët Hennessy - Louis Vuitton Société Européenne's ( ) ROCE trend, we were very happy with what we saw.

What Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?

Just to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for LVMH Moët Hennessy - Louis Vuitton Société Européenne:

Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)

0.21 = €23b ÷ (€144b - €33b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2023).

So, LVMH Moët Hennessy - Louis Vuitton Société Européenne has an ROCE of 21%. While that is an outstanding return, the rest of the Luxury industry generates similar returns, on average.

In the above chart we have measured LVMH Moët Hennessy - Louis Vuitton Société Européenne's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like, you can for free.

What Does the ROCE Trend For LVMH Moët Hennessy - Louis Vuitton Société Européenne Tell Us?

It's hard not to be impressed by LVMH Moët Hennessy - Louis Vuitton Société Européenne's returns on capital. Over the past five years, ROCE has remained relatively flat at around 21% and the business has deployed 92% more capital into its operations. Now considering ROCE is an attractive 21%, this combination is actually pretty appealing because it means the business can consistently put money to work and generate these high returns. If these trends can continue, it wouldn't surprise us if the company became a multi-bagger.

The Bottom Line

LVMH Moët Hennessy - Louis Vuitton Société Européenne has demonstrated its proficiency by generating high returns on increasing amounts of capital employed, which we're thrilled about. And long term investors would be thrilled with the 188% return they've received over the last five years. So while investors seem to be recognizing these promising trends, we still believe the stock deserves further research.

Josèfa Ntjam Makes a Landmark Showing With LVMH So far, 2024 is shaping up to be a banner year for the French multidisciplinary artist Josèfa Ntjam. Earlier this year, she made her U.S. debut with an exhibition of sculpture, film, sound, and digital collage at Fotografiska New York, immersing visitors in a trippy interpretation of “radical liberation” movements pulled from real life and fiction alike. Now, after having spent the entirety of 2023 in residence with LVMH’s Métier d’Art, Ntjam recently wrapped up a major sculpture exhibition with the French luxury conglomerate. During her residency, Ntjam worked from the Portuguese and Parisian workshops of Jade Groupe, which fashions metal hardware for garments produced by LVMH maisons. “Une cosmogonie d’océans” shows an ethereal and regal side to her developing practice. Each of the 12 sculptures are informed by West and Central African diasporic mythology and range in scale from handheld to more than six feet tall. Her followers may be more used to a neon-tinged palette of acid-green, fuchsia and turquoise, but in “Une cosmogonie d’océans,” we’re treated to a slate of regal, ethereal beings who are at once of the moment and redolent of antiquity. —Jenna Adrian-Diaz

The Broad museum taps Diller Scofidio + Renfro for a major $100 million expansion. The Broad museum has announced a $100 million expansion project, increasing gallery space by 70 percent after nearly ten years since its initial opening. Diller Scofidio + Renfro will design the expansion, continuing their “veil and vault” concept. The 55,000-square-foot addition will feature new galleries, open-air courtyards, live programming space, and an enhanced visitor-friendly art storage vault experience. Scheduled for groundbreaking in early 2025, the expansion aims to enrich Downtown L.A.’s contemporary art scene, with a public opening expected before the 2028 Los Angeles Summer Olympics and Paralympics. Bulgari is launching a foundation to protect Italy’s cultural legacy and other ventures. Fondazione Bulgari was recently launched in Rome by the brand’s CEO Jean-Christophe Babin, with a mission to build on Bulgari’s heritage through initiatives including supporting gender equality, equal access to education, and preserving Italy’s cultural heritage. The foundation also aims to promote contemporary art and support emerging talents, demonstrated through partnerships with institutions like the MAXXI Museum and the Whitney Museum. Additionally, the foundation will continue Bulgari’s longstanding partnership with Save the Children and amplify female voices through initiatives like the Aurora award. Key figures like Laura Burdese will play essential roles in the foundation’s activities, which include expanding initiatives like Bulgari’s Jewelry Academy and establishing the training school La Scuola Bulgari.

Elena Velez semifinalist for LVMH Prize for Young Fashion Designers - Milwaukee Journal Sentinel,"Tue, 05 Mar 2024 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5qc29ubGluZS5jb20vc3RvcnkvZW50ZXJ0YWlubWVudC9hcnRzLzIwMjQvMDMvMDUvZWxlbmEtdmVsZXotc2VtaWZpbmFsaXN0LWZvci1sdm1oLXByaXplLWZvci15b3VuZy1mYXNoaW9uLWRlc2lnbmVycy83MjgwOTMyOTAwNy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Milwaukee's Elena Velez, who's designed for Ariana Grande and Halsey, is semifinalist for LVMH Prize, 'the gold standard of fashion awards'

With her heart and soul in Milwaukee and her career in New York, award-winning fashion designer Elena Velez is up for the prestigious LVMH Prize for Young Fashion Designers.

""It's really the gold standard of fashion awards,"" Velez said over the phone as she made her way through Midtown Monday.

The 29-year-old mother of two grew up as the only child of a single mom, a Lake Michigan ship captain, and often joined her mom aboard vessels. Velez's clothing designs are a reflection of those ""very beautiful but bleak"" spaces she grew up in.

""I had kind of a crazy childhood growing up in the very industrial, utilitarian spaces in and around the Milwaukee lakes,"" Velez said. ""The brand was always a little bit of a longing for a version of femininity that I just couldn't ever locate there. So, I had to kind of create it for myself with bits and pieces of that very nontraditional world.""

While riding the choppy waves of the fashion industry, Velez has been written about by esteemed fashion publications, including Vogue, and presented designs to legendary Vogue Editor Anna Wintour. Ariana Grande, Solange Knowles, Julia Fox, Halsey and Emma Chamberlain have all donned her creations.

Now, Velez is one of 20 designers from around the world, aged 18 to 40, who are semifinalists for the LVMH Prize. The public can vote online for the eight they think should make it to the finals until 4:59 p.m. CT Tuesday.

Here's a look at Velez's illustrious, evocative and sometimes provocative career — what the young designer and her mom have sacrificed for it, including Velez's childhood home, and the LVMH Prize.

The story behind Elena Velez's 'paradoxical and contradictory' aesthetic

Velez described her aesthetic as ""very paradoxical and contradictory."" It's about strengths and softness, and a femininity that's complicated and multidimensional.

When Velez's mom, Holly Church, was working on boats in her early 20s, she got frustrated with ""the glass ceiling."" She realized the only way she'd be able to get further in the industry was to get her captain's license.

When Velez was around 3 years old, Church started running construction tugs. With those gigs often lasting a couple of days and Church being a single parent, Velez would sometimes have to tag along.

""Something that I really enjoyed was getting to be with her in these very beautiful but bleak industrial spaces in the Midwest,"" Velez said. ""A lot of my childhood was spent in these very heavy metal spaces, like shipyards and engine rooms.""

Later, when Church ran the Denis Sullivan, the crew would help out with Velez and teach her how to do rigging. When Church started captaining Edelweiss Cruises, Velez would sometimes sit in the pilot house with a kiddie cocktail and coloring book while her mom worked.

When Velez was around 4, Church said, ""she was drawing on everything,"" from napkins and tablecloths to paper and books.

""Anything that she could find that she could get a picture into of a dress or clothing,"" Church said.

For Velez's fifth birthday, a friend gave her a blank sketch book. Velez called it her ""Style Book,"" which she spelled ""Stil,"" and filled it up with designs, Church said. Velez would go on to fill up ""piles and piles and piles"" of notebooks and books with pictures of people in clothing.

""As long as I remember, I was always compelled to collage different shapes and colors on the body,"" said Velez, who attended New Berlin West High School. ""And, I've always loved fashion since before I could see any sort of commercial or economic profession in it.""

After Church's friend gave Velez a sewing machine, Church got her then-12-year-old daughter into sewing lessons.

Velez's first fashion show of sorts was when she was 13 or 14 at the Pritzlaff Building, Church said.

""She's been driven to do this forever,"" said Church, who's now the executive director of the Milwaukee Community Sailing Center and a merchant marine boat captain for Edelweiss. ""There was no alternative. It was something that's she's just had in her blood forever.""

What Elena Velez and her mom have invested into Velez's designing dreams

But, if Velez could choose to love anything else, she ""100% would.""

""There are a lot more sustainably paced, lucrative, healthy vocations for me to apply my skillset and talents,"" Velez said. ""But, there's just always been a divine connection towards this very peculiar thing.""

Historically, to participate in fashion design, designers need a lot of private capital, a network and an entrepreneurial foundation, Velez explained. She started out with none of that.

And, that's something she's been speaking out about since entering the industry. Her brand identity is about ""democratizing who can participate in the creation of the American fashion identity,"" Velez said.

""Historically, that's just been people who are relegated to New York, LA and the very cosmopolitan coasts,"" she said. ""But I have a very Midwestern fashion-centric message and it's a valuable contribution to democratize creative resources and the creative perspective in the United States.""

Late last year, the New York Times documented what the young designer and her mom have put into the pursuit of Velez's dreams: Selling the family home to help pay for Velez's tuition and fees, funds from Church's savings and retirement accounts, and more.

""When a child has a dream that strong, you do what you can to help them get where they've got to go,"" Church said.

Church said her daughter has ""something special"" and has been described by industry folks as ""the one in the million.""

""She has a vision. She has a voice. She has the creativity and the talent,"" Church said.

""All of the accolades and success we've had over the last couple of years have reinforced that there is resonance with the message we're trying to communicate and the aesthetic we're trying to put into the world,"" Velez said. ""We just do whatever it takes to make sure we can make a viable company out of all of these things.""

To become a fashion designer of a certain caliber, Velez said, there's a pretty specific trajectory that one must orient themselves toward.

Often, that process starts in school, she said. She attended Parsons Paris for two years, then interned in Australia. She graduated from the Parsons School of Design in New York City in 2018 and went on to graduate from the Central Saint Martins art school in London in 2020.

""Once you graduate, you move on to the competitions, where hopefully, you've been able to gain the exposure and potentially capitalize on some of the cash prizes,"" Velez explained. ""And, from there, you get to start your own brand, hopefully.""

Velez has an array of impressive accolades. She was named a Teen Vogue Generation Next designer in 2019. In 2022, she was named the Council of Fashion Designers of America's Emerging Designer of the Year and was a Vogue Fashion Fund winner. In 2023, she was the recipient of the Fashion Trust U.S. Sustainability Award and a finalist for the Emerging Latin American Designer/Brand Award by the Latin American Fashion Awards (Velez is of Puerto Rican heritage).

She was also recently named to Dazed 2023's list of 100 trailblazing creatives.

""They all cumulatively speak to all of the different points of interest that are part of the brand's significance,"" Velez said of her accolades. ""There's a focus on sustainability, there's a focus on nontraditional founders of color, there's a focus on cultural impacts. And, just progressively, they paint a portrait of what we're trying to achieve here.""

How Elena Velez became a semifinalist for the LVMH Prize

About six months ago, Velez filled out and submitted her LVMH Prize application. It included her experience in the design industry, education, a couple of short-answer questions and her portfolio of work from the last couple of seasons.

To be considered, applicants must have created at least two womenswear, menswear or genderless collections, according to the LVMH Prize website. Twenty semifinalists were chosen by a selection committee and announced Feb. 9.

""I was really excited,"" Velez said. ""I feel really good about the brand and our message and about our aesthetic. And, I knew that it's a longevity game. And, one season or another we would be in the right place at the right time with the right collection. That happened to be this year. ""

As a part of the contest, the semifinalists presented their collections in Paris during Fashion Week, which started Feb. 26 and runs through March 5.

Last week, the designers had a showroom there with a handful of their ""most iconic brand looks that communicate the commercial trajectory as well as the high concept vision,"" Velez said. She prepared six looks, including a really high-concept one, as well as a couple of collaborative products from this past season, including shoes and bags.

The designers got to communicate the message of the brand to LVMH Prize experts and VIPs that came through. The experts got to ask the designers questions and submitted votes for who they think should be finalists.

According to the LVMH Prize website, after finalists are announced, they will travel to the Louis Vuitton Foundation to meet with Jury members, who audition them and pick winners.

The winner of the the LVMH Prize will be awarded a 300,000-euro endowment and a tailored mentorship by LVMH. The winner of the Karl Lagerfeld Prize will receive 150,000-euro allocation and a one-year mentorship by LVMH teams. Three designers will be selected to join the design studios of LVMH Houses for one year and receive a 10,000-euro allocation.

Elena Velez's creative process is 'very academic' and just as important as the finished product to her

Velez's creative process is ""very academic.""

""I go about the creation of a collection the same way that I would go about a persuasive essay,"" she said.

That includes reading, listening and conducting a lot of primary and secondary research.

Velez translates her general thesis and supporting evidence into ""visual motifs and silhouettes.""

""The process really for me is as important and special as the product,"" she said.

She considers herself a ""method actor"" of sorts when it comes to the way she constructs her garments.

""I really like to put myself into the mentality of the creator, who is centric to the source of inspiration for that season,"" she said.

Elena Velez has previously made headlines for 'Gone with the Wind' salon, muddy runway show

With the brand being ""very much about complicated portraits of femininity and womanhood,"" Velez put on a salon in February themed around the controversial novel and film ""Gone with the Wind"" and ""the feminist parallels between Scarlett O'Hara and the modern-day, contemporary woman.""

""I think it's important to create spaces for open discourse in a place and a culture that can feel critically stifling,"" Velez said. ""It's very rare in today's world we have anywhere else to celebrate or engage in art or culture outside of home and work. So, it's also up to the designer to create these spaces for engagement and to explore the potential for how fashion can really facilitate meaningful cultural engagement.""

The salon — covered by Vogue and The Washington Post — was held at a ""Gilded Age"" $60 million mansion across from the Metropolitan Museum of Art.

Velez had models and VIPs in looks made from scraps and salvaged materials that combined high-level silks with low-level acetates.

""It had a lot to do with a delusional demand for glamor on the precipice of Apocalypse,"" she said. ""It really created a portrait of a complicated and almost obsessively compulsive desire to recreate a space of glamor that made no sense.""

The event included a symposium, hosted by a couple of Velez's ""favorite public intellectuals and podcasters"" Jack Mason of ""The Perfume Nationalist"" and Anna Khachiyan of ""The Red Scare.""

""It was not only about reiterating my commitment to fashion but also building a community of people who can engage with that fashion in various, meaningful ways,"" she said.

Another move Velez made headlines for was her 2023 New York Fashion Week show.

Models trudged into and through a mud pit runway in ""their webby corset dresses and ruched tops and skirts, slipping and sliding,"" according to The Washington Post. It ended in a mud pit fight between a handful of models, Vogue Runway reported.

Velez declined to talk to reporters after the show, but offered up manifesto-style show notes, the Post wrote.

Elena Velez's ultimate goal, what the future holds

Velez's ultimate goal: To be able to continue pursuing her passion and make meaningful works.

""The artist's most sacred dream is to be able to always to continue to support themselves and to continue to explore their own mind through their work into the future,"" she said. ""I don't need to be rich. I don't need to be famous. I just need to continue to create work in a way that feels meaningful to me time after time.""

Velez is in the beginning stages of development and prototyping for her next collection, which will be shown at New York Fashion Week in September. Afterwards, that collection will be taken to market, where wholesalers and retailers will place orders. Then, production to fulfill those orders will begin.

At some point, Velez is considering adding a Midwest manufacturing component to her brand that could fulfill and create inventory for herself, as well as other local contractors. She would want that to also include a makers space for collaborators she works with.

""Just continue to serve as a pipeline to the industry for other nontraditional makers in the Midwest,"" she said.

In the future, Velez aspires to expand into ""adjacent creative industries,"" including interior design, experience performance, sound and more.

On a personal note, Velez — mom to Atlas, 3, and Freja, 1 — and her husband, Andreas Emenius, a painter from Stockholm, recently bought a home in upstate New York, which Velez is looking forward to renovating and decorating.

Luxury Brands Will Fund Harvard Lab's Medicinal Plant Research in 3-Year Agreement | News - Harvard Crimson,"Wed, 06 Mar 2024 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWNyaW1zb24uY29tL2FydGljbGUvMjAyNC8zLzYvTFZNSC1EaW9yLXJlc2VhcmNoLWFncmVlbWVudC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Luxury giants LVMH and Christian Dior will fund the Harvard Davis Lab’s research on the genetic barcoding of nearly 2,000 edible and medicinal plants.

Harvard’s Office of Technology Development organized a three-year research agreement between the Harvard Herbaria’s Davis Lab, the perfume and cosmetics arm of Dior, and the research sector of LVMH — a luxury goods conglomerate that consists of several subsidiary brands.

According to the Harvard Gazette — a University-run publication — the collaboration seeks to use big data techniques to analyze plant species from across the world. The project will produce a publicly accessible database for medicinal plant identification, as well as to help predict species’ response to climate change.

Charles C. Davis, a professor of Organismic and Evolutionary Biology and the lab’s principal investigator, wrote in an emailed statement to The Crimson that the research seeks to “gain insights that can inspire innovative solutions and better protect these species in the face of a changing climate” through the “analysis and digitization of plant species data captured in herbaria.”

According to Harvard Office of Technology Development spokesperson Kirsten Mabry, the researchers will “develop a digital collection and genomic library of nearly 2,000 medicinal and horticulturally important flowering plants.”

“LVMH Recherche and Parfums Christian Dior provide funding to support the advancement of the research project in the Davis Lab at Harvard’s Herbaria,” Mabry wrote.

Harvard Herbaria interim Director and OEB professor Elena M. Kramer said the collaboration came at the initiative of the luxury giants.

“My understanding is that LVMH, Dior had a relationship with a faculty member at the Medical School,” Kramer said. “They were put in touch with Chuck, and then the conversation grew to include the broader herbarium.”

Kramer said LVMH and Dior have both “practical and aspirational goals” for their collaboration with Harvard, including product development and affiliation with the University.

Though the companies cannot use Harvard’s name in product advertising, Kramer said, “they were very keen to have an affiliation with Harvard.”

According to Kramer, LVMH and Dior also stand to benefit from the Davis Lab’s plant research “whether cosmetic or related to human health,” which will make genome sequencing of important medicinal plants more widely available.

Most of the plant samples sequenced will be obtained from the Harvard Herbaria, but according to Kramer, LVMH and Dior also sent a small sample of proprietary roses to the Davis Lab, which will be sequenced and sent back to the companies.

All Harvard Herbaria data will be made public but there is no definite timeline for doing so, according to Kramer.

“I would say it is Harvard policy, but it’s also part of the policy of just the broader academic community,” she said. “It’s just the premise that we all operate on.”

Correction: March 8, 2024

A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that Harvard Herbaria data will be made public on a two-year timeline. In fact, there is no definite timeline for making the data public."
"AI, Outlets, Recycling: Can Luxury Solve Its Billion-Dollar Excess Inventory Problem? - The Business of Fashion","Mon, 04 Mar 2024 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzb2ZmYXNoaW9uLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy9zdXN0YWluYWJpbGl0eS9sdm1oLWtlcmluZy13YXN0ZS1vdmVyc3RvY2stbGVmdG92ZXItYmlsbGlvbi1kb2xsYXItcHJvYmxlbS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"On an industrial site near the French-Belgian border, high-end sneakers, handbags and ready-to-wear garments are routinely dismantled, shredded and granulated in preparation for recycling.

None of these products have ever been used by a consumer. Instead they are a small slice of what has become a billion-dollar challenge for luxury’s biggest businesses: what to do with goods that don’t sell from season to season?

(BoF Team)

Last year, LVMH held €3.2 billion ($3.5 billion) of stock it had written down because of “obsolescence” or lack of sales prospects, up from €2.7 billion in 2022. Gucci-owner Kering recorded a €1.5 billion allowance for its inventory, an increase from €1.3 billion a year earlier. That’s the equivalent of hundreds of thousands, if not millions or products, though these numbers include raw materials and prototypes as well as finished goods.

Such excess is a feature of fashion’s dominant business model, designed to maximise production efficiency and sales prospects in a trend-driven industry where accurately aligning supply and demand has been a perennial challenge. But how companies handle the growing glut is an increasingly complicated question.

ADVERTISEMENT

Luxury brands have long used staff sales, private shopping events and outlets to discreetly sell off old stock. What they couldn’t offload, they destroyed to avoid damaging their pricing power and carefully cultivated perception of exclusivity.

But luxury’s relationship with discounters has always been uneasy — even more so now as slowing sales push up excess inventory levels across the sector. Meanwhile, the practice of burning unsold goods has become a reputational and regulatory hazard that’s already been outright banned in France and will be outlawed across all of the EU soon.

Recycling is one solution, but manually dismantling each product so that its constituent parts can be reprocessed into new materials is costly, time consuming and currently limited in scale. Lower-priced brands, like Nike, have faced criticism for shredding brand new products they couldn’t sell in recycling plants.

“It is a big issue for the industry,” said Claudia D’Arpizio, a partner at consultancy Bain & Company. “If you’re a big brand and you have a lot of inventory, it’s very difficult to find a solution at scale. I would say we’re less than 50 percent of the way [there].”

A Culture of Excess

Luxury brands lean into the idea that their products are inherently more sustainable than cheaper labels because they make smaller quantities and design for longevity. But the reality is that they have always over-produced.

Higher volumes mean better economies of scale during manufacturing. And over-ordering is viewed as cheaper than the risk of missing a sale because stock isn’t available. For luxury apparel, a 50 percent full-price sell-through rate is considered good, according to analysts.

“There is embedded excess in the system,” said D’Arpizio. “Fashion will never have zero leftovers; this is structural.”

As luxury’s biggest players have grown over the last decade, so has the value of their overstock. The cost of impaired inventory held by Kering and LVMH more than doubled between 2014 and 2023.

(BoF Team)

To be sure, gauging the true scale of the issue is tricky. Provisions can be reversed or carried over from year-to-year. Companies don’t disclose details about the volume of products they expect to make a loss on, or what they do with this stock. Luxury trade groups have pushed back against regulation that could require them to do so.

The wide array of products that can be included in these numbers makes analysis and comparisons across companies trickier still. For instance, LVMH’s inventory includes stocks of make-up, perfume, fashion, jewellery and leather goods, as well as the raw materials used to make them. (Wine and spirits are largely excluded from inventory provisions, according to the company’s accounts.) By contrast, Kering’s brands have a stronger focus on ready-to-wear, which has a much worse sell-through rate than more trans-seasonal products like leather goods.

Investors are conditioned to tolerate such waste so long as it doesn’t hurt the bottom line. The value of LVMH’s impaired inventory amounted to just 4 percent of revenue in 2023. The company said products it has written down are still likely to sell during this financial year. Kering’s excess inventory amounted to a larger 8 percent of sales, but that reflects its focus on fast-moving fashion products, analysts said. The company did not provide comment.

A Luxury Problem

In the summer of 2018, Burberry published a routine set of financials containing a figure that would prove explosive: the British luxury house had burned nearly $40 million-worth of goods in the preceding financial year.

The practice was commonplace across the luxury sector at the time, though most companies didn’t talk about it publicly. Burberry had published the figures for years without remark. But something in the zeitgeist had shifted that year, with environmental concerns moving up the agenda and investors questioning how such waste reflected on the British brand’s sluggish turnaround effort. The backlash came swiftly and within months the company had vowed to stop destroying unsold stock.

It took regulators stepping in for other brands to follow suit. Kering announced plans to stop destroying any unsold products globally from 2022, after France passed a law that would ban the practice. Hermès said in its last annual report that the company no longer destroys unsold items in France and will extend this policy to operations around the world between 2025 and 2030.

Large luxury companies are still trying to figure out what to do instead. Of course, lower-cost brands over-produce too, but unlike luxury players, mass fashion businesses are less squeamish about resorting to steep discounts, cut-price retailers and bulk traders.

“This is only pertinent really to luxury; the rest of these brands aren’t that pristine,” said Ken Pucker, professor of practice at the Fletcher School at Tufts University and former chief operating officer at Timberland.

AI, Outlets and Recycling

Luxury is trying to adapt, starting with design and production planning.

Kering has turned to artificial intelligence in a bid to help improve sales forecasts and limit the quantity of unsold goods at the end of each season. It’s succeeded in improving the accuracy of its inventory predictions by upwards of 20 percent, and the results are still getting better, it told The Business of Fashion last year. LVMH entered a partnership with Google in 2021 with a similar goal to improve demand forecasting and inventory optimisation.

“It’s become very important … to adapt production to the level of demand because dealing with leftovers is quite a sensitive topic,” said Charles-Louis Scotti, head of luxury goods research at financial services firm Kepler Chevreux. Large luxury brands “now have super-efficient warehouse centres and can reallocate inventory anywhere in the world, so if demand collapses in Europe they can ship to where demand is still very big.”

But accurately aligning supply and demand remains highly challenging, so luxury brands are also forging relationships with charities and schools to donate and upcycle leftover products. And they’re still discounting, even when they say they aren’t. Top-end brands like Louis Vuitton, Hermès and Chanel host sales for staff, friends and family that can shift significant volumes. Hermès reportedly generates more than €100 million every year from such events. Prada said the company disposes of all its overstock through private sales and outlets.

The off-price sector is booming, boosted by a glut of inventory and rising prices that are pushing consumers to look for deals. In Europe, the segment’s sales amounted to €40 billion in 2021, according to consultancy McKinsey & Co, or 11 percent of the total fashion market. It is expected to grow at five times the rate of full-price sales in the five years to 2030. Today, 13 percent of all luxury goods by value are sold through off-price outlets, according to Bain.

“Outlets will always play a strategic role because there’s always a need for seasonal products,” said D’Arpizio. “It’s a strategic channel.”

But with the value of excess inventory reaching into the billions at some companies, luxury brands are looking for other ways to manage stock without flooding the market. “In the end, the sheer amount of products being created is in a way too much to claim in sales and outlets,” said Francois Souchet, a circular economy and sustainability strategist.

Increasingly, companies are looking at ways to repurpose what they cannot sell. Gucci has worked with a collection of designers, brands and artists on its Continuum project, which incorporates past pieces into new products. LVMH showed a collection in December created by artistic director Kevin Germanier using unsold products and excess fabrics from the group’s maisons.

Both companies are exploring opportunities in recycling, too. LVMH launched a circularity initiative late last year, bringing together different start-ups and industrial partners the company has been working with in the space.

Kering has said all of its brands have developed pilot projects with Revalorem, the company that operates the processing site near France’s border with Belgium. The luxury group discretely invested in the business last year, according to a December presentation.

But the biggest lever for change is not producing too much to begin with. “Eliminating the need to think about unsold products in the first place is the vital starting point,” said Elisa Niemtzow, vice president for consumer sectors at consultancy BSR. “It’s going to take creative and innovative thinking — and maybe thinking about different models of doing business.”

LVMH Broadens Two Perfumes and Cosmetics Executives' Scopes - WWD,"Tue, 19 Mar 2024 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3dkLmNvbS9iZWF1dHktaW5kdXN0cnktbmV3cy9iZWF1dHktZmVhdHVyZXMvbHZtaC1icm9hZGVucy10d28tcGVyZnVtZXMtY29zbWV0aWNzLWV4ZWN1dGl2ZXMtc2NvcGVzLTEyMzYyNjk1Nzcv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS — LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton has broadened the role of two senior executives — Romain Spitzer and Stéphanie Medioni — in its Perfumes and Cosmetics Division.

Spitzer, currently chief executive officer of LVMH Fragrance Brands, leading Parfums Givenchy and Kenzo Parfums, has had the scope of his job extended with the inclusion of new ventures, according to an internal LVMH announcement Monday.

“In this newly expanded role, Romain will support the beauty roadmap from other divisions of the group in their early stages of product innovation and business development by bringing their incubation projects to completion,” the announcement said.

Spitzer reports to Stéphane Rinderknech, CEO of LVMH Perfumes and Cosmetics division — which counts 15 beauty brands, including Parfums Christian Dior and Guerlain — and of LVMH Hospitality Excellence.

Romain Spitzer

“Romain’s deep expertise in fragrances is secret to no one, as is his extensive knowledge of the innovation process in crafting perfumery icons,” Rinderknech said in the statement. “Over the past few years he achieved a substantive work with the brand elevation of Parfums Givenchy, in line with the couture — exemplified in the creation of L’Intérdit or the reinvention of Gentleman.

“I am confident that he will become a key asset to help the group’s most prestigious maison set foot in the beauty industry in a strong and sustainable way,” he added.

Meanwhile, Medioni is also expanding her remit. The LVMH beauty executive president, who heads strategy and development, now leads “the ambition of consolidating transversal functions, including CMI, media, retail and omnichannel,” too, LVMH said in a separate internal announcement. Medioni will be in charge of integrating data and artificial intelligence, and sustainability, as well.

At the same time, Medioni will continue to oversee Aqua di Parma, Parfums Loewe, Maison Francis Kurkdjian, Make Up For Ever, Officine Universelle Buly, Stella McCartney Beauty, Fresh and Benefit.

Rinderknech called hers a “highly strategic role for LVMH Beauty.”

Stéphanie Medioni

“Stéphanie is a key figure in the group with a deep knowledge and expertise of the beauty industry,” he said. “Over the past years, she has contributed tremendously to set the foundations of this division, demonstrating leadership in building strategic vision, organizational capacity while developing great talents around her.”

Rinderknech said he is confident “in her ability to help this division reach the next milestone and achieve our ambitious strategic goals.”

The extended roles at LVMH come at a time when European luxury groups are moving in on beauty like never before. Kering has taken its beauty in-house and Richemont is building a Laboratoire de Haute Parfumerie, for instance.

Rinderknech was named chief of LVMH Perfumes and Cosmetics in March 2023. It’s a role no one had held at the group since 2004. His nomination came amid a number of high-profile changes in the division.

Shape-shifting is happening at a rapid pace. Luxury makers’ homing in on beauty and cosmetics is a sign of the times, as luxury makers’ once red-hot trades in China and in fashion cool, while beauty keeps proving its staying power, despite the ongoing tough geopolitical and macroeconomic climate. Beauty is a lure today for reasons including its growth, resilience, desirability and margins.

Fragrance and cosmetics is a big, fast-developing business, with its products boasting high frequency of use. The category generated sales in 2022 of about $430 billion, according to a McKinsey study that projected those will reach about $580 billion by 2027, representing projected annual growth of 6 percent.

In 2023, LVMH’s Perfumes and Cosmetics division generated sales of 8.27 billion euros, up 7 percent year-on-year.

In the WWD Beauty Inc Top 100 ranking of beauty makers, reflecting 2022 sales — the most recent to date — LVMH ranked sixth, following L’Oréal, Unilever, the Estée Lauder Cos., Procter & Gamble and Shiseido."

LVMH’s plans for the Paris 2024 Olympics are shaping up. On Wednesday, the event’s official partner hosted a cocktail party at Louis Vuitton’s historic home in Asnières, near Paris. The occasion was the unveiling of medals and torch trunks created for this summer’s Olympics and Paralympics Games, which will run from 26 July to 11 August and 28 August to 8 September, respectively.

It comes as anticipation builds in the French capital ahead of the games, which will be an unprecedented coming together of the worlds of luxury and sport. Some 15.3 million visitors are expected in Paris during the event, up from 6.4 million last summer, according to the Paris Tourist Office (11.3 million for the Olympics and 4 million for the Paralympics). Yet nervousness remains about whether the inevitable disruption around the city will be offset by a boost in the city’s attractiveness in the wake of the event, potentially translating into sales in luxury stores in the following months.

“This is the third time after the announcement and the unveiling of the Chaumet medals that we’ve shown something concrete about the creative partnership,” Antoine Arnault, head of LVMH image and environment, told guests on Wednesday. “I realise the strength and power of the Olympics,” he added, paying homage to the organisers, the artisans and athletes."

Since the arrival of Pharrell Williams as creative director of Louis Vuitton’s menswear business and the subsequent announcement of the LVMH-Olympics partnership, the French luxury house has increasingly collaborated with athletes and sporting organisations.

Last month, the brand added French NBA rookie Victor Wembanyama to its fast-growing list of athlete ambassadors. Last year, it also announced French athletes Enzo Lefort, a fencer, and Léon Marchand, a swimmer, as ambassadors.

The statement indicated that further developments of the LVMH-Olympics deal “will be revealed very soon”.

Comprising 12 sculptures exhibited in an abandoned space, Ntjam’s work is a take on Central and West Africa’s mythology and ancestral divinities. The new series of characters was built upon digital works the artist had previously created. Now, Ntjam presents a series of experimental iterations that mimic an ancient future.

Since its establishment in 2015, LVMH Métiers d’Art has striven to forge new links between artists and craftspeople through its artistic residency programme. Providing access to raw materials that are often hard to come by, and guidance throughout each six-month residency encourages an artist to learn techniques, methods and tools specific to LVMH Métiers d’Art.

Ntjam’s artistic development consisted of building upon prior research within science, socio-philosophical concepts, and mythologies, and combining this with new technologies.

During her 2023 residency, Ntjam was based in Jade Groupe workshops in Paris and Portugal, which specialise in metalworking. While the workshop focused on finely detailed metalwork, it didn't deter the artist from envisioning sculptures scaling 2m high. ‘The artisans at Jade made the impossible into reality,’ said the French artist. By challenging production methods and technology, the technicians rethought tools, design, and finishes to help create the sculptural collection.

‘Each residency surprises us with the extent of its impact,’ says Jean Baptiste Voisin, president of LVMH Métiers d’Art. ‘The artist’s passion quickly finds an echo in that of the craftsman. These residencies are also extraordinary from a human perspective. They foster relationships. They bring teams together.’

In previous years, residencies have been undertaken by Thomas Mailaender, Amandine Guruceaga, Mario Verboom, Sabrina Vitali, Raphaël Barontini, Eva Nielsen and Anne-Charlotte Finel. The identity of the artist selected for the 2025 residency will be announced in the next few months.

LVMH Shuffles Top Executives as Bernard Arnault Sharpens Succession Plan - Yahoo Canada Finance,"Thu, 21 Mar 2024 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vY2EuZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9sdm1oLXNodWZmbGVzLXRvcC1leGVjdXRpdmVzLWJlcm5hcmQtMTcwNzA4NTQwLmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS — In the latest chapter of a generational changing of the guard, LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton announced that Toni Belloni, one of Bernard Arnault’s most trusted lieutenants, will relinquish his key duties at the French luxury conglomerate and hand over his responsibilities to Stéphane Bianchi.

After more than 23 years working alongside Arnault, Belloni is to step down as group managing director and chairman of the executive committee of the LVMH group and leave the board of directors following the annual general meeting scheduled for April 18, LVMH said in a statement issued after the market close Thursday.

Bianchi, who has moved swiftly up the ranks since joining the group in 2018, will chair the executive committee and exercise, alongside Arnault, the strategic and operational supervision of the group’s brands, which range from Louis Vuitton and Dior to Tiffany & Co., Sephora and Moët & Chandon.

Previously president of LVMH’s watches and jewelry division, the 59-year-old will also oversee the presidents of the regions and the group’s digital and data transformation, the group said.

Belloni, who is 69, will be in charge of strategic missions for Arnault and will be appointed president of LVMH Italy. “The idea is not at all to stop working. But today, I wanted to have more time for others, and primarily for my family,” Belloni said.

Toni Belloni

The announcement comes as Arnault, who turned 75 this month, prepares his succession by tightening his family’s grip on the group’s leadership and transitioning some of his most senior executives to advisory roles.

At the AGM next month, LVMH will propose the appointments of his sons Alexandre Arnault and Frédéric Arnault to the board, as reported.

Story continues

Alexandre Arnault, executive vice president of product and communications at Tiffany, and Frédéric Arnault, chief executive officer of LVMH Watches, will join their siblings Antoine Arnault, head of communication, image and environment at LVMH, and Delphine Arnault, chairman and CEO of Christian Dior Couture, on the board.

Meanwhile, group veteran Michael Burke has succeeded Sidney Toledano, 72, at the head of LVMH Fashion Group. Toledano left the executive committee and became an adviser to Arnault in the handover, which took effect on Feb. 1.

Arnault has shown no indication that he intends to retire. In 2022, LVMH shareholders voted in favor of a resolution to extend to 80 the age limit for him to serve as CEO. Previously, the company’s bylaws fixed 75 as the age limit.

The LVMH boss had hinted at a new role for Bianchi at the press conference in January where the group reported another year of record results.

“Since joining the group, Stéphane Bianchi has demonstrated rare leadership and management qualities while immersing himself in the group’s entrepreneurial and family culture,” Arnault said in Thursday’s statement.

Stéphane Bianchi

While LVMH is known for growing and grooming executive talent from within, Bianchi spent a large portion of his career at the Yves Rocher Group, where he was CEO from 1998 to 2015, directly managing the Yves Rocher and Petit Bateau brands.

At LVMH, he initially focused on the watch maisons Tag Heuer, Hublot and Zenith, gradually adding the jewelry houses Tiffany, Bulgari, Chaumet, Fred and Repossi to his remit. LVMH did not name anyone to replace him in that position.

“I am delighted by his new role and am convinced that with Stéphane at my side, and with the entire executive committee and the group’s employees, we will take the success of the LVMH Group even further, while respecting our values and commitments,” Arnault said.

He credited Belloni with being instrumental to the growth of LVMH, which last year became the first European company to reach a $500 billion market value.

“Toni has been an essential partner for me and a very important member of the LVMH family. I would like to thank Toni for his exceptional contribution over the last few years,” Arnault said.

“Inspiring, curious and unfailingly loyal, he has participated in all the acquisitions of recent years and has supported the growth of the group and its teams with agility and pragmatism. His vision of luxury, of the markets, and his work with our teams have been considerable assets,” he added.

Belloni joined the French luxury giant in 2001 after a 22-year career at Procter & Gamble. He is widely credited with engineering the strategy that saw LVMH focus resources on star brands, while tailoring new strategies for the individual businesses.

He has also played a key role in dealmaking, including LVMH’s $16.2 billion acquisition of storied American jeweler Tiffany in 2019, its largest purchase to date.

“Never a dull moment!” Belloni said in summing up his tenure at the group.

“As I step down from my current role, I realize how fortunate I have been to play a leadership role at the heart of one of the most extraordinary entrepreneurial ventures of recent decades. I would like to thank Mr. Arnault most sincerely for the opportunity he has given me, and even more so for the trust he has always placed in me,” he added.

“Working alongside him has been a unique, stimulating experience, full of challenges and learning, with exemplarity as my compass,” he said. “We have achieved excellent results, always respecting our values and supporting numerous initiatives for the benefit of the greatest number of people. It is now up to Stéphane to take us even further.”

A graduate of the Institut d’Etudes Politiques de Paris, Bianchi started out as a consultant at Arthur Andersen. He described his first five years with LVMH as “rich, exciting and demanding,” as he pledged to “always and relentlessly” strengthen its success.

“By joining the LVMH group at the end of 2018, I made the choice to join a family group, chaired and led by a visionary man, and carrying values to which I am deeply committed: legacy, long-term vision, timeless desirability of our maisons and products, and a permanent quest for excellence in all our actions,” he said.

LVMH said the board of directors meeting on April 18 would also be asked to appoint Chinese American businesswoman and lawyer Wei Sun Christianson as a director. Christianson has a lengthy career in finance, serving as CEO China and co-CEO, Asia Pacific, for Morgan Stanley, where she worked for close to 20 years.

“Wei Sun Christianson’s financial culture, her understanding of the luxury goods market and above all her in-depth and invaluable knowledge of China will be invaluable assets for the board of directors,” Arnault said.

LVMH racked up record-breaking revenue last year, driven by the popularity of cosmetics giant Sephora, which it owns.

Sephora's CEO, Guillaume Motte, told The FT that its sales success, which is highlighted in LVMH's 2023 annual results, benefited from the ""lipstick effect."" This is a trend where customers still purchase small luxuries even when the economy is tough.

LVMH's ""selective retailing"" division, which includes Sephora, hit 17.9 billion euros, or $19.6 billion, in revenue. Its profits were up 76%. This is a bigger jump than LVMH's fashion or watches & jewelry divisions.

Even Gen Alpha has been jumping on the Sephora hype, much to the chagrin of Gen Zers, who have criticized the presence of young kids at the high-end beauty stores.

LVMH Moët Hennessy - Louis Vuitton Société Européenne (EPA:MC) shareholders have earned a 23% CAGR over the last five years - Simply Wall St,"Fri, 22 Mar 2024 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.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?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"When you buy shares in a company, it's worth keeping in mind the possibility that it could fail, and you could lose your money. But on a lighter note, a good company can see its share price rise well over 100%. For instance, the price of LVMH Moët Hennessy - Louis Vuitton, Société Européenne ( ) stock is up an impressive 162% over the last five years. Also pleasing for shareholders was the 15% gain in the last three months. But this could be related to the strong market, which is up 7.4% in the last three months.

So let's assess the underlying fundamentals over the last 5 years and see if they've moved in lock-step with shareholder returns.

To quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.

Over half a decade, LVMH Moët Hennessy - Louis Vuitton Société Européenne managed to grow its earnings per share at 19% a year. This EPS growth is reasonably close to the 21% average annual increase in the share price. Therefore one could conclude that sentiment towards the shares hasn't morphed very much. In fact, the share price seems to largely reflect the EPS growth.

The graphic below depicts how EPS has changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).

We know that LVMH Moët Hennessy - Louis Vuitton Société Européenne has improved its bottom line over the last three years, but what does the future have in store? You can see how its balance sheet has strengthened (or weakened) over time in this free .

What About Dividends?

When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. We note that for LVMH Moët Hennessy - Louis Vuitton Société Européenne the TSR over the last 5 years was 181%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!

A Different Perspective

LVMH Moët Hennessy - Louis Vuitton Société Européenne shareholders are up 4.9% for the year (even including dividends). But that return falls short of the market. It's probably a good sign that the company has an even better long term track record, having provided shareholders with an annual TSR of 23% over five years. It's quite possible the business continues to execute with prowess, even as the share price gains are slowing.

Exclusive Interview With Design Holding CEO Daniel Lalonde as New York Store Opens - WWD,"Thu, 07 Mar 2024 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3dkLmNvbS9ob21lLWRlc2lnbi9zaG9wLWhvbWUvZGVzaWduLWhvbGRpbmctY2VvLW5ldy1mbGFnc2hpcC1uZXcteW9yay1uby1pcG8tMTIzNjI0MTY1My_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"MILAN — Design Holding’s chief executive officer Daniel Lalonde has been on a mission to build an “LVMH of Home” since 2021, and he’s about to cut the ribbon Thursday on his biggest achievement with the company yet: a new hub where shoppers are able to outfit their homes with some of the best of European design, all under one roof.

Driven by the belief that the same shopper who owns a Tank watch from Cartier or a Birkin bag from Hermès shares similarities with the consumer of B&B Camaleonda sofas and Louis Poulsen Artichoke lamps, Lalonde’s new retail concept has finally come to fruition, just steps away from the Empire State Building.

Heritage Italian furnishing brands B&B Italia, Maxalto and Azucena; lighting brands Flos and Louis Poulsen, and kitchen-maker Arclinea, all under the Design Holding umbrella, will be showcased in a 25,000-square-foot permanent space spanning two floors on 135 Madison Avenue. The second floor of the U.S. hub for these brands was designed by Lissoni & Partners, which was founded by leading Italian architect and B&B artistic director Piero Lissoni.

In an interview with WWD on the eve of the event, Lalonde said it’s the first time luxury European furniture and lighting brands will stand next to each other under the same roof, making it easier for customers to build the home of their dreams.

“We have this incredible portfolio and we are always looking to say ‘How can the sum of the parts be bigger than the individual brands together?’ We are very nurturing on developing each brand within their own space, but I very much believe that we’re stronger together,” the former LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton executive said.

He added that these synergies have come to life elsewhere in contract spaces the company has curated — hospitality, residential, corporate and retail sectors spaces, including the Bulgari Hotel in Paris; the M+ Museum in Hong Kong; residential skyscraper La Bella Vita in Taichung, Taiwan; the Perelman Performing Arts Center (PAC NYC), and the Bourse de Commerce — Pinault Collection in Paris.

Design Holding’s catalogue features iconic objects designed by some of the most famous internationally known designers such as Achille and Pier Giacomo Castiglioni; Tobia Scarpa; Luigi Caccia Dominioni; Poul Henningsen; Arne Jacobsen; Citterio; Gaetano Pesce; Philippe Starck; Piero Lissoni; Konstantin Grcic; Jasper Morrison; Patricia Urquiola; Michael Anastassiades, and many others.

Daniel Lalonde Mattia Zoppellaro for Contrasto

In 2021, the Italian conglomerate inked a joint venture with Fendi to form Fashion Furniture Design, or FF Design, to develop the Fendi Casa business. The line was previously produced and distributed by licensee Luxury Living, operating through Club House Italia.

In recent years, Design Holding has seen the expansion of innovative products and potential future icons like the Thea kitchen by Citterio for Arclinea; Allure O’ table and Flair O’ by Monica Armani for B&B Italia; Borea by Piero Lissoni for B&B Italia Outdoor; the Almendra suspension lamp by Patricia Urquiola, and the Luce Orizzontale by R. & E. Bouroullec for Flos.

Despite all that history, Lalonde admits there is still work to be done in raising brand awareness in the U.S., a nation where Williams Sonoma and RH dominate the aspirational home and furniture market.

“The U.S. market is one in which customers use their designer and architect the most to make decisions. This assisted experience is more prevalent in the U.S. than in other markets in which the architects’ and designers’ influence is, let’s say, a third of all purchases. In the U.S., it’s close to 45 percent,” Lalonde reflected, adding that education will be paramount at the Madison Avenue store, where the team of sales associates will be well-trained to expound on these histories. Storytelling will also be key within the spaces themselves, where consumers will be privy to the lesser known historical facts surrounding brands like Louis Poulsen, for example, the Danish lighting manufacturer that was founded in 1874 as a wine import company and that will fete its 150th anniversary this year.

Design Holding, which first revealed its new store concept to WWD in April, tested the waters with a Boston store housing B&B Italia, Maxalto and Arclinea. This took the place of Montage, which for decades had been regarded by Boston residents as a reference for European style.

During Miami Art Basel, the firm opened B&B Italia’s new flagship positioned in the Design District, with a ground floor that included B&B Italia’s signature products and new releases, the Dambo couch by Lissoni; the Tobi-Ishi table by British designers Edward Barber and Jay Osgerby, and the Camaleonda sofa system by Mario Bellini adorned in a new fabric designed by Stella McCartney with her S-Wave monogram, highlighted with a large installation upon entering the space. Maxalto and Azucena furnishings, Arclinea kitchens and lighting by Flos and Louis Poulsen are also available in the space.

Lalonde disregarded the comparison between a high-end duty free that sells a multitude of brands and products and the new Design Holding space, admitting that it is difficult to find a direct comparison for the new unit.

“The reason I would say no is because we want people spending a lot of time in the store. So the idea is that you come in the store, you discover the brand…you discover the design services that we offer. Architects can spend the afternoon there. They can design and look at different fabrics. They can go do all of their projects just within the parameter of the store,” he explained, insisting he wants any and all who are design curious to feel welcome in the store, spend the day or take a time out for an espresso.

In detail, the first floor will feature a glimpse into high-end living with the Camaleonda sofa, the Tufty-Time seating system by Patricia Urquiola and the Alex table by Citterio on display, as well as items from B&B Italia Outdoor, Azucena and Arclinea.

A special entrance will open up into the Maxalto space, with a collection coordinated by its creative director Antonio Citterio, who celebrates 26 years as the sole designer of the brand’s collections this year. Citterio told WWD last month that Maxalto was poised to benefit from more dedicated showrooms, finally allowing it to emerge from its image as the “quiet” luxury brand in comparison to B&B Italia. B&B Italia founder Piero Ambrogio Busnelli first launched Maxalto in 1975 but abandoned the project. His son Giorgio Busnelli relaunched it in 1993.

On the second floor, Arclinea kitchens and B&B Italia wardrobes will interact with lighting from Flos and Louis Poulsen. The latter will unveil its new space mirrors, as well as new materials and colors. Flos will highlight the latest expansion of the Light Shadow collection, an anti-glare optical solution patented by Flos and Eclectic. A dedicated area will also showcase the most recent outdoor solutions, such as In Vitro by Philippe Starck, Pointbreak by Lissoni, Mile by Citterio and Spine by Vincent Van Duysen. To best serve the A&D community, Flos built a cutting-edge Lighting Design Room onsite for clients to test and experience lighting effects. There will be a dedicated lighting designer onsite to create individualized lighting solutions across decorative, outdoor, architectural and bespoke lighting needs.

Design Holding is expected to release full-year results in April. In 2022, the last year reported, its revenues rose 25.8 percent to 867.6 million euros, compared with 2021, boosted by business in the U.S. and Asia Pacific, as well as its high-end contract business. Contract business, Lalonde said, is expected to drive sales, offsetting losses indirectly due to rising interest rates that have negatively impacted the housing market.

When asked if the group is on track to meet its near term goal of 1 billion euros in sales, Lalonde was confident in business momentum.

“That’s still a goal. And then, I’m gonna ask my team: What does it take to go to two? And I’m very convinced that it’s highly achievable with our brand portfolio today and there’s so much runway ahead,” the executive added, reiterating that a pubic offering is not a priority.

“I’m focused on building stores, like the Madison store and investing in the U.S., the Middle East and APAC. We see tremendous amount of high end projects developing in China. There’s no IPO on the horizon at this time.”"

What a Trademark Loss for Veuve Clicquot Means for Other Brands - The Fashion Law,"Tue, 19 Mar 2024 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWZhc2hpb25sYXcuY29tL3doYXQtYS10cmFkZW1hcmstbG9zcy1mb3ItbHZtaHMtdmV1dmUtY2xpY3F1b3QtbWVhbnMtZm9yLWJyYW5kcy1pbi10aGUtZXUv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"A trademark registered to Veuve Clicquot has been invalidated by a European Court in the latest round of the champagne-maker’s bid to maintain a EU-wide registration for a specific shade of orange. In the latest round of a long-running case over color, the EU General Court sided with Lidl, finding that while the European Union Intellectual Property Office (“EUIPO”)’s Appeal Board previously determined that the color mark had acquired distinctiveness across the 27-member bloc, a lack of evidence that the LVMH-owned champagne company’s mark garnered secondary meaning in at least two EU countries makes it ineligible for registration.

Some Background : On the heels of Veuve Clicquot being granted a registration for the orange trademark for use on champagne in 2006 (following years of back-and-forth over the mark before the EUIPO), Lidl sought to invalidate the registration in 2015, arguing, among other things, that the mark lacks the requisite distinctive character to be registered. This resulted in an August 2022 decision from the EUIPO’s Fourth Board of Appeal, which took the view that the evidence submitted by Veuve Clicquot demonstrated that “a significant proportion of the relevant public was, at the time of the application for registration of trademark, accustomed to the shade of orange [at issue] and that, therefore, there was no doubt that the mark at issue had become distinctive through use made of it … at the time that trade mark was filed.”

Lidl appealed the Fourth Board of Appeal’s decision to the General Court, which demonstrated in its recent decision the notably high bar to proving acquired distinctiveness for certain marks.

On March 6, the General Court sided with Lidl, finding that Veuve Clicquot had failed to provide sufficient evidence that the orange trademark had amassed secondary meaning throughout the entirety of the EU, namely, in Greece and Portugal. (This is significant, as a non-traditional trademark, such as a color mark, may only be registered in the EU if evidence is provided that it has acquired distinctive character in connection with the goods/services at issue through use in “all parts of the European Union.”)

Specifically, the court held that the newspaper excerpts submitted by Veuve Clicquot do not “directly indicate that the mark at issue has become such as to identify the Champagne wines concerned as originating from a particular undertaking” and “do not relate to the perception of the mark at issue by the public of [Greece or Portugal].” In the absence of “direct evidence” for Greece and Portugal, the General Court held that the EUIPO’s Board of Appeal “could not … reach the conclusion that the acquisition of distinctive character through use had been demonstrated to the requisite legal standard as regards those two countries.”

As such, the General Court annulled the earlier decision of the Fourth Board of Appeal and dismissed the remainder of the appeal, thereby, serving to invalidate Veuve Clicquot’s registration for the mark.

THE BIGGER PICTURE : More significant than a case-specific fight over Veuve Clicquot’s signature hue, the judgment from the General Court “shows, once again, the almost impossible nature of proving distinctive character acquired through use at the level of the European Union,” according to Jérôme Tassi, a partner at Paris-based firm AGIL’IT, who notes that “the burden of proof is so heavy that even such renowned brands cannot prove it despite [making] undoubtedly very significant evidentiary investments.”

Not the first case to drive home the message that relying on secondary meaning as a basis for amassing and/or maintaining trademark registrations in the EU is an uphill battle, the registrability of a number of “unconventional” marks has been considered by courts in the EU in recent years, resulting in losses for big-name brands. Taylor Wessing’s Louise Popple noted that a handful of decisions – including those that centered on Louis Vuitton’s checkered Damier Azur pattern, the shape of Dior’s saddle bag, the configuration of Tecnica’s Moonboots, and the shape of EOS’ lip balm packaging, for example – “illustrate that it remains difficult to register non-traditional trademarks, particularly on a pan-EU basis.”

And not merely an issue for new or niche brands, the geographical scope of evidence of distinctive character acquired through use in the European Union continues to be prove a difficult issue for multi-national brands to successfully navigate. It is worth noting, of course, that registrations for shape or other less conventional marks are not impossible to acquire, and cases that centered on Guerlain lipstick packaging and the shape of the Absolut vodka bottle are indicative of the potential for non-traditional marks to be registered in the EU.

In light of the complexities of achieving registration for unconventional marks at an EU level, Crowell & Moring attorneys cite a handful of practical points worth considering …

> Acquired distinctiveness for the purposes must be evidenced throughout the EU. When attempting to demonstrate this, careful planning as regards which Member States will be covered and how to regionalize and/or extrapolate certain Member States, could be key and may become an important consideration for trademark strategy.

> Greater weight seems to be given to direct evidence by the GC, such as sworn statements from chambers of commerce and industry or other professional associations or public authorities, opinion polls/ market studies, and the use of the mark on the internet. As regards the latter, pursuant to settled case law, significance is given to the top-level domain name of the website concerned and its language. In contrast, advertising campaigns, catalogues and brochures are (merely) indications that the trademark has acquired distinctiveness through use.

> It is furthermore paramount for the trademark applicant or -holders to consider the filing and the form of their trademark, as this should correspond with the use they wish to claim. Important questions are: “Will I actually use the sign as registered?” and “for which goods and services is registration sought and will the trademark be genuinely used for such goods and/or services?” Strategizing on these points prior to registration may help companies to avoid headaches later on.

> If acquired distinctiveness can only be proven in a limited number of Member States, it might be advisable to obtain trademark protection either at a national level or using an International Registration with individual designations in key territories.

The case is Lidl Stiftung & Co. KG v. EUIPO, Case T‑652/22."

Then the coronavirus pandemic hit, and pandemic-related shutdowns sank LVMH's stock, sending Arnault's personal net worth down more than $30 billion by May 2020. But as the world opened up again, LVMH's stock recovered, thanks to strong sales in fashion and leather goods and an uptick in alcohol sales, particularly Champagne.

He’s the CEO and chair of the French luxury conglomerate with companies spanning fashion, jewellery, watches, perfume and alcohol, including brands Tiffany & Co and Dom Pérignon.

Jeff Bezos and Bernard Arnault are the world’s two richest people, with a combined net worth of around US$400 billion.

Amazon founder Bezos is ranked second on the index, with a net worth of US$197 billion. Although both billionaires have built their own empires, how the pair acquired wealth is vastly different.

This is how they made their fortunes.

Jeff Bezos’ first job was at a McDonald’s

The billionaire said in a 2001 interview with Fast Company that his job at a McDonald’s restaurant in Miami was “really hard”.

“They wouldn’t let me anywhere near the customers. This was my acned-teenager stage. They were like, ‘Hmm, why don’t you work in the back?’” Bezos recalled.

A book called The Everything Store: Jeff Bezos and the Age of Amazon states that he joined a telecommunications start-up called Fitel after graduating from Princeton. He then quit Fitel and went to work for Bankers Trust as a product manager, where he focused on selling software to pension-fund clients.

After two years at Bankers Trust, he joined the hedge fund D.E. Shaw and became a senior vice-president after only four years.

He left his hedge fund job in 1994 to start what would become Amazon

Bezos decided books were the best products to start selling online. He then started Amazon.com in a garage in Seattle. Amazon sold books to people in all 50 US states and more than 45 countries in the first month of its launch.

Amazon went public in 1997

In March 1997, Amazon had about 80,000 average daily visits, TechCrunch reported. It had only 256 employees that year. In the years that followed, Amazon extended its product range beyond books to include electronics, tools, toys, CDs and more.

Bezos invested US$250,000 in Google in 1998, before its IPO in 2004. Time magazine then named Bezos as its Person of the Year in 1999 after Amazon rapidly grew.

Bezos had the same annual base salary of US$81,840 for decades while he was CEO, but his annual total compensation for many years exceeded US$1 million, owing to costs related to security and business travel.

Bezos founded space tourism company Blue Origin in 2000 and bought The Washington Post for US$250 million in 2013.

He became the world’s richest person for the first time in 2017, briefly overtaking Microsoft’s Bill Gates. That same year, he said he’d sell US$1 billion worth of Amazon stock annually to fund Blue Origin, per Reuters.

After spending 27 years leading the company, Bezos announced he was transitioning to become Amazon’s executive chairman. In 2023, Amazon hit nearly US$575 billion in net sales.

The company has hundreds of fulfilment centres around the world. It sells millions of products, including appliances, clothing, groceries and toiletries, and it also offers cloud computing services.

Bezos reportedly owns a US$500 million megayacht , which set sail last summer. But in 2022, he pledged to give away most of his wealth to charity, CNN reported at the time.

In February, Amazon had a market cap of US$1.8 trillion.

Now, moving onto Bernard Arnault …

The company owned brands like French department store Bon Marché and Christian Dior, The New York Times reported. He renamed the firm Financière Agache and kick-started a turnaround effort, which helped it earn US$1.9 billion in revenue just a few years later, the Times reported.

He bought a chunk of capital of the French luxury fashion house Celine in the late 1980s. Years later, it was integrated into the LVMH group.

He went on to become LVMH’s largest shareholder

Champagne company Dom Pérignon was one of the initial brands part of Moët Hennessy, which later merged with Louis Vuitton to create LVMH in 1987.

Arnault spent US$2.6 billion buying up shares to become the company’s largest shareholder and eventually its chairman and CEO by 1989, per The Times.

Arnault quietly built a 20.2 per cent stake in Hermès in the years that followed through its subsidiaries and equity swaps, Bloomberg reported.

Arnault said in January, when its earnings were released, “Our performance in 2023 illustrates the exceptional appeal of our maisons and their ability to spark desire despite a year affected by economic and geopolitical challenges.”

It seems like Arnault has no plans to slow down. He told The Financial Times in 2019, “We’re just getting started.”"

“An essential partner”





“Toni has been a major contributor to the success of LVMH.

His vision of luxury, of the markets, and his work with our staff have been considerable assets. Toni has been an essential partner for me and a very important member of the LVMH family,” said Arnault.

During the event, more than $1.4 million in scholarships will be awarded to the 130 FSF scholars — which include this year’s Virgil Abloh Post-Modern Scholarship Fund Scholars — and their work will be showcased that evening. Paloma Elsesser, a plus-size model and body advocate, will be the host.

Over the past five years, FSF has increasingly focused its efforts on building equity and inclusion in the fashion industry by selecting talented college students who are underrepresented in the industry. This includes students of color, those who demonstrate financial need, and those who are first-generation college students.

Since 2019, the fund has given more scholarships to underrepresented students. The number of scholars of color has risen from 22 percent to 62 percent. Those who demonstrate financial need have increased from 11 percent to 31 percent, and those who are first-generation college students have increased from 4 percent to 15 percent.

All of the students receiving scholarships will receive from $5,000 to $25,000.

This year’s event will be held at The Glasshouse in New York City and will be a two-hour cocktail party beginning at 6 p.m."

A Seamless Transition at the Helm of Luxury: Ensuring Legacy and Innovation for the Future

In a landmark announcement marking the evolution of its leadership, LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton heralds a new era with a significant shift in its executive ranks. The luxury conglomerate has announced that Toni Belloni, a key figure and trusted advisor to Bernard Arnault, will step down, making way for Stéphane Bianchi to assume a critical leadership role.

Key Takeaways:

Toni Belloni’s departure and Stéphane Bianchi’s appointment underscore a well-planned succession strategy, highlighting LVMH’s commitment to internal talent development and leadership continuity.

Belloni’s tenure at LVMH is marked by strategic acquisitions and global expansion, setting a high standard for his successor. Bianchi’s promise to continue the legacy indicates a seamless transition and a future focused on innovation and excellence.

The executive reshuffle and the inclusion of new board members emphasize LVMH’s dedication to global perspectives and diversity in its leadership, ensuring the group’s enduring success and adaptability in the luxury market.

The appointment of Arnault’s sons to the board reinforces the family’s ongoing involvement and commitment to the conglomerate’s vision and values, promising stable and visionary leadership.

As LVMH enters a new chapter, its leadership is poised to uphold the conglomerate’s legacy of quality, innovation, and market leadership, ensuring its continued dominance in the luxury sector.

With over two decades of significant contributions, Belloni’s departure as Group Managing Director and Chairman of the Executive Committee signifies a pivotal moment for LVMH. His successor, Bianchi, brings a wealth of experience and a strong track record of success within the group, emphasizing Arnault’s strategic vision for succession planning.

This transition showcases Arnault’s commitment to nurturing internal talent, with Bianchi’s rise reflecting his effective leadership and deep engagement with LVMH’s diverse portfolio since joining in 2018. Initially overseeing the prestigious watch division, Bianchi’s responsibilities expanded, demonstrating his ability to align with the group’s entrepreneurial spirit.

Moreover, the executive reshuffle includes Michael Burke taking over from Sidney Toledano as the head of LVMH Fashion Group, further reinforcing the group’s focus on ensuring smooth leadership transitions and maintaining continuity.

Although Belloni’s exit marks the end of an influential chapter, it also represents a strategic shift as he takes on a new role dedicated to strategic missions for Arnault and the presidency of LVMH Italy. Celebrated for leading LVMH through significant acquisitions, such as the acquisition of Tiffany & Co. in 2019, Belloni’s legacy is one of strengthening the conglomerate’s global presence.

In recognition of Belloni’s contributions, Arnault highlights his crucial role in driving LVMH to new heights, exemplifying operational excellence and market relevance. Bianchi, stepping into his new role, commits to preserving LVMH’s tradition of excellence and innovation, driven by a dedication to timeless appeal and core values.

The upcoming Annual General Meeting on April 18 will feature key appointments, including the addition of Arnault’s sons, Alexandre and Frédéric, to the board, reinforcing the family’s leadership. The proposed inclusion of Wei Sun Christianson to the board reflects LVMH’s commitment to a global perspective and diverse governance.

As LVMH navigates this historic transition under Arnault’s strategic guidance, it is poised for a future of innovation, resilience, and growth, solidifying its status as a luxury industry leader and a symbol of excellence worldwide."
L Catterton Receives Green Light to Launch Tender Offer on Tod's Stock - WWD,"Fri, 22 Mar 2024 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vd3dkLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy1uZXdzL21lcmdlcnMtYWNxdWlzaXRpb25zL2wtY2F0dGVydG9uLXJlY2VpdmVzLWdyZWVuLWxpZ2h0LWxhdW5jaC10ZW5kZXItb2ZmZXItdG9kcy1zdG9jay0xMjM2MjcyOTc2L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"MILAN — Italy’s Bourse watchdog Consob has given the green light to the tender offer aimed at delisting the Tod’s Group. The tender offer will kick off on Monday and run until the end of trading on May 8.

As reported earlier this month, Crown Bidco, an L Catterton affiliate, was looking to acquire 36 percent of Tod’s SpA, or almost 13 million shares, at 43 euros a share, for about 512 million euros. L Catterton is backed by LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton. On Friday, it was disclosed that the voluntary tender offer is being launched for 27.9 percent of the group because L Catterton in the meantime has acquired additional shares, raising its stake to 7.9 percent of Tod’s. As a result, the value of the offer is now expected to amount to 398 million euros.

The agreement includes the possibility of a merger if the delisting is not achieved.

Minority shareholder Delphine SAS, a fully owned subsidiary of LVMH, has agreed not to tender its 10 percent of shares on the date of the delisting, and will be granted governance and exit rights. Tod’s chief Diego Della Valle and LVMH chief Bernard Arnault have built a yearslong relationship and the former is a member of the board of LVMH.

In the event of full acceptance, Tod’s will maintain 54 percent of the capital, L Catterton will indirectly own 36 percent and Delphine 10 percent.

Tod’s has said that the delisting is seen as “a precondition to ensure the pursuit of [Tod’s] future growth programs and consolidation,” allowing the group “to pursue its objectives in a market environment and legal framework characterized by greater management and organizational flexibility, with faster decision-making and execution times and also benefiting from reduced management and listing costs.”

This is the second time Della Valle has attempted to delist the group, after a failed tender offer in 2022, which did not fulfill the 90 percent threshold.

The Tod’s Group reported a strong performance in the 12 months ended Dec. 31, with net profit of 50 million euros, compared with 23.1 million euros in 2022, on the back of revenues that rose 11.9 percent to 1.12 billion euros. This compared with 1 billion euros in 2022.

In 2023, sales of the Tod’s brand rose 10.4 percent to 562.9 million euros, and Roger Vivier was up 16.5 percent to 286.7 million euros recording growth while maintaining its exclusive positioning.

Hogan revenues rose 9.3 percent to 214.2 million euros and Fay climbed 13.2 percent to 60.4 million euros.

Shoes, the group’s core category, reported a 10.4 percent increase to 857.8 million euros.

Sales of leather goods and accessories rose 16.6 percent to 187.3 million euros and apparel was up 16.7 percent to 79.1 million euros."
"French tax authorities to reimburse €235,000 to LVMH - us.fashionnetwork.com","Thu, 07 Mar 2024 13:48:23 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vdXMuZmFzaGlvbm5ldHdvcmsuY29tL25ld3MvRnJlbmNoLXRheC1hdXRob3JpdGllcy10by1yZWltYnVyc2UtMjM1LTAwMC10by1sdm1oLDE2MTI2NTIuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"French tax authorities to reimburse €235,000 to LVMH By

French tax authorities claimed additional income tax from following an audit of its subsidiary but, after a legal battle that lasted several years, they will have to repay the world’s number one luxury group a minimum of €235,000, according to a ruling by the Versailles Administrative Court of Appeal.







Bernard Arnault in January - FNW



“The Ministry for the economy, finance and industrial and digital sovereignty is directed to proceed, within two months, to the payment of the principal sum of €235,852.77,” stated the ruling, which was gleaned on Wednesday by the AFP agency, confirming a report by the Informé site.



The sum “includes the interest that has accrued since April 29 2013, and which will continue to accrue until the reimbursement is complete,” stated the Versailles Administrative Court of Appeal.

LVMH “has calculated the default interest at €32,074.65 as of April 30 2022, a figure that will need to be adjusted until the full payment of the amount due,” added the court.



Following a tax audit of Berluti in 2015, the R&D tax credit claimed by the men's luxury footwear label, owned by LVMH since 1993, “was challenged by the administration for the years 2008 and 2010, and additional corporate income tax payments were as a result claimed from the LVMH group,” the court indicated in its ruling.



France’s Directorate General of Public Finance (DGFIP) asked LVMH to pay more than €2 million in additional tax, according to the Informé site.



A legal battle ensued, focused especially on Berluti's made-to measure and ready-to-wear footwear business, which ended with the court ruling of February 29.



Neither LVMH nor DGFIP have responded to AFP's requests for comments.



In 2023, LVMH reported a revenue of €86.2 billion, and a net profit of €15.2 billion.

5 LVMH prize semi-finalists to keep an eye on - nss magazine,"Wed, 13 Mar 2024 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5zc21hZy5jb20vZW4vZmFzaGlvbi8zNjEwNy81LWx2bWgtcHJpemUtc2VtaS1maW5hbGlzdHMtdG8ta2VlcC1hbi1leWUtb27SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"An essential event for young fashion creation, this 11th edition of the LVMH Prize stands out with unique proposals influenced by urban vibes or marked by the return of a sophisticated feminine wardrobe. From February 29 to March 1, the semi-final pitted 20 brands from eighteen countries against each other, under the watchful eye of fashion industry experts. Excitement builds as the names of the 9 finalists are awaited, but already, we've chosen to highlight 5 creators to keep a very close eye on.

Marie Adam-Leenaerdt

At 27 years old, Marie Adam-Leenaerdt has already made her mark in fashion history. With two shows in Paris, a notable presence in the best showcases globally, the distinguished Belgian creator embodies the daring contrast unique to Belgian School. Her creations, both interpretable and narrative, embrace distinctive sensuality. Graduating from La Cambre in Brussels in 2020, Marie shaped her path at giants like Balenciaga while remaining faithful to her unique fashion vision. Her eponymous brand, launched in 2023, breathes timelessness by drawing inspiration from everyday objects. The bold cuts, precise constructions, and luxurious materials give her creations a distinctly striking allure. The world hastened to discover her, with about fifteen points of sale, from the United States to Japan, and a presence online with prestigious retailers like Net-A-Porter and Ssense. Marie, still working solo, weaves collaborations with artisans to enhance her creations, notably in accessory development, bags, and shoes.

Duran Lantink

Revealed by his iconic vagina pants for Janelle Monae in 2018, Duran Lantink is a creator who constantly pushes the boundaries of convention. Based between Amsterdam and Paris, the Dutchman unveiled his second show at Paris Fashion Week last February, reinventing winter wardrobes with astonishing proportions. Merging beloved pieces, unused stocks, and sustainable materials, Lantink creates ever-evolving clothing. His unique approach, based on formal principles of addition and subtraction, offers characteristic silhouettes reminiscent of those by Rei Kawakubo. His 2023 show, combining custom three-dimensional sculpture and traditional craftsmanship, captivated the attention of Vogue UK, Vogue US, Dazed, i-D, and Paper Magazine. His custom collaborations with cultural icons like Beyoncé and Billie Eilish reinforce his position as a visionary creator.

Niccolò Pasqualetti

Niccolò Pasqualetti, a young designer with elegant and avant-garde taste, has emerged as an innovative force in the fashion industry. His brand, recently established in Paris, brilliantly reinterprets classic couture, merging tradition with genderless fashion elements. Trained in Venice, Belgium, and at The Row in New York, Pasqualetti earned a master's degree in women's ready-to-wear at Central Saint Martins before working at Loewe. His androgynous wardrobe, inspired by Italian sartorial codes, rediscovers forgotten elements, creating a new clothing style between classic feminine and masculine. The echo of his creations resonates between Paris and Tuscany, where they come to life alongside local artisans.

Standing Ground

Michael Stewart, hailing from Ireland and graduating from the Royal College of Art in 2017, founded Standing Ground in 2022, dedicating his brand to contemporary evening wear, bespoke clothing, and body adornments. Inspired by geology, his creations revolutionize evening fashion. Standing Ground's practice revolves around body specificity, where draping, sculpting, and artisanal techniques harmonize with individual form. A favorite among celebrities, he graces many red carpets, most recently, Florence Pugh adorned one of his creations during the promotion of Dune 2. His dresses, far from mere garments, are odes to uniqueness and elegance. The proportions and silhouette capture temporal resonances of ancient landscapes, artifacts, and relics, fused with speculative future elements. Stewart, who never sketches his creations but drapes them directly on the body, offers a quality transcending bespoke.

HodaKova

Launched in 2021 by Ellen Hodakova Larson, Hodakova embodies Swedish boldness with an avant-garde approach to sustainability. In her Spring-Summer 2022 collection, she pushes the boundaries of upcycling, affirming her commitment to fully sustainable fashion. A visionary in her field, Ellen Hodakova Larson aspires to create the world's first entirely sustainable fashion house. Her flexible approach to the business model explores creativity while supporting craftsmanship. Working with neglected pieces, she focuses on quality, potential, and craftsmanship to bring creations to life with history and sentimental value. Her latest feat: a completely upcycled handbag in collaboration with Gucci."

3 Beauty Stocks to Buy for Gorgeous Gains - Yahoo Finance,"Thu, 21 Mar 2024 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy8zLWJlYXV0eS1zdG9ja3MtYnV5LWdvcmdlb3VzLTAwMzM0ODM0My5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The beauty industry has been a source of some pretty gorgeous gains lately. As inflation begins to retreat, consumers may finally catch a break, with just a bit more disposable income in their products to spend on those nice-to-have discretionary items that bring them joy.

When you combine luxury brands with beauty products, you may have the secret formula for the type of growth that’s helped mint one of the wealthiest men on the planet: Bernard Arnault, CEO of LVMH (OTCMKTS:LVMUY). The timeless brands backing some of the beautiful luxuries are tough to stack up against. Either way, there is more than one way to profit from the continued rise of beauty stocks.

While LVMH may be a more diversified high-end luxury company, we can’t ignore its skin in the beauty game. When it comes to high-end luxury makeup, fragrances and skin care products, LVMH is really in a league of its own.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

LVMH’s beauty portfolio could contribute a growing share of its overall revenue over the next few years. Dior J’adore Eau de Parfum and Fenty Beauty Gloss Bomb lip luminizer are just a sample of some of the new products that could help LVMH level up its fragrances and cosmetics division. Social media trends — like morning skincare routine videos on TikTok — also stand to bolster demand for such premium products.

With the biggest and best luxury brands in the beauty scene, LVMH stands out as a great way to play that trend. Should consumers with more buying power trade up to high-status luxury beauty products, that trend could even get hotter.

elf Beauty (ELF)

elf Beauty (NYSE:ELF) has been a standout performer in recent years, with a jaw-dropping 156% in gains in just the past year. The $10.6 billion relative lightweight in the beauty market has found a way to really hit the spot with younger consumers.

Story continues

Though the most explosive gains are now behind it, ELF stock still has room to run as it continues to receive viral appeal on social media platforms. Unlike LVMH, elf offers beauty at a reasonable price with products that seem to be a better value among its younger, less-affluent consumers.

It’s not just younger consumers that may be driving consumers toward higher-value cosmetics, though. Inflation and macro headwinds have caused many consumers to be more cost-conscious in recent years.

With that, elf Beauty has been able to gain by offering quality products that don’t break the bank. As elf Beauty continues to keep its foot on the pedal with new products, don’t expect the firm’s growth to dry up anytime soon.

“We can continue this momentum,” CEO Tarang Amin told CNBC.

Estee Lauder (EL)

Estee Lauder (NYSE:EL) is an established player in the beauty scene with a $52 billion market cap. Unlike elf and LMVH, EL stock has been struggling of late, now down 60% from its all-time high hit at the very end of 2021. Estee Lauder stands out as more of a value play as it looks to hit back at its rivals.

For now, the company may continue to be dragged down as its struggles in China, arguably the most important market for Estee Lauder. While the company stands to benefit from many of the same industry tailwinds as its better-performing rivals, it will be tough for EL stock to really turn a corner until the Chinese economy can recover from its epic slowdown.

In any case, the company may have recently hit an “inflection point,” at least according to its CEO, Fabrizio Freda. As the Chinese economy recovers and Estee Lauder continues seizing growth opportunities, it’s hard to view EL stock as dead money. In fact, it may very well be the greatest value opportunity in the space today.
