LVMH Chairman Remains 'Quite Confident' Despite Slowing Growth - The Business of Fashion,"Thu, 26 Jan 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzb2ZmYXNoaW9uLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy9sdXh1cnkvbHZtaC1jaGFpcm1hbi1yZW1haW5zLXF1aXRlLWNvbmZpZGVudC1kZXNwaXRlLXNsb3dpbmctZ3Jvd3RoL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LVMH chairman Bernard Arnault said he remained “quite confident” for 2023 even as growth at luxury’s biggest group sank below double-digits for the first time since 2020.

“There’s been an extremely strong start to 2023…If the reopening of China is confirmed, if it continues like this it should be a very good year,” Arnault said, taking questions from analysts at LVMH’s first in-person results conference in three years. “We will be able to grow, and keep growing our investments,” he added.

LVMH said fourth-quarter sales rose 9 percent on an organic basis — a slowdown compared to the group’s 20 percent growth in the first nine months, but still beating analyst estimates of 7 percent growth. Full-year sales for the group jumped 23 percent year-over-year to €79 billion ($86 billion).

Amid recurring Covid-related lockdowns, sales in LVMH’s “Asia excluding Japan” division (including the key Chinese market) fell 8 percent in the fourth quarter and were flat year-on-year.

Luxury brands are counting on China easing pandemic restrictions and the resumption of its citizens’ travel to fuel growth this year amid a gloomier outlook for the West, where rampant inflation, high energy costs and rising interest rates are dampening economic confidence.

“China needs economic growth, for their people and for the success of the country…I’m fairly confident that the Chinese authorities will use the reopening period to re-dynamise growth,” Arnault said. “I am optimistic for the Chinese market.”

While most Chinese tourists aren’t expected to resume long-haul international travel before the second half of the year, off-shore shopping hub Macau is already enjoying a remarkable rebound, LVMH said.

Meanwhile, growth in North America slowed to 7 percent in the fourth quarter, which LVMH said was largely attributable to the strong dollar prompting American clients to purchase more abroad.

Fourth-quarter sales rose 10 percent at the group’s key fashion and leather goods division, which operates megabrands Louis Vuitton and Dior as well as labels including Celine, Loewe, Givenchy and Kenzo.

While LVMH does not typically break out sales for individual brands, the 73 year-old billionaire confirmed analyst estimates that flagship label Louis Vuitton had over €20 billion in annual sales last year, making it the first luxury brand to ever reach the milestone.

The group’s Celine brand crossed €2 billion in sales, Arnault said, meeting targets set when designer Hedi Slimane was hired to lead the house in 2018. Despite a rocky initial reception from the fashion world, Slimane’s black-and-white branding, monogrammed canvas mini-bags and “Triomphe” crossbodies have won a broad following, particularly among young luxury consumers.

The announcements come as Arnault, who is now the world’s wealthiest person since overtaking Tesla CEO Elon Musk late last year, reshuffles the senior ranks at LVMH as well as his family holding companies. Earlier this month, the group announced that Dior CEO Pietro Beccari would take the reigns of Louis Vuitton as Michael Burke transitions to an advisory role after a decade leading the brand. In turn, Louis Vuitton’s executive vice president for product Delphine Arnault — Arnault’s oldest child — is set to become CEO of Dior with support from a new managing director Charles Delapalme.

It’s the biggest role yet accorded to one of Arnault’s children, and comes amid other changes that suggest the longstanding taboo around discussing the conglomerate’s succession plans is lifting. Last year LVMH raised the age limit for its CEO from 75 to 80, hinting that Arnault has no interest in handing over control soon. But he did convert his private holding company to a joint-stock partnership set to be owned in equal shares by his five children, as well as naming his son Antoine Arnault CEO of the Christian Dior SE financial vehicle through which the family exercises their controlling stake in LVMH. His children’s nominations could signal a broader changing of the guard underway.

Nonetheless, Arnault declined to comment on plans for his succession. “The retirement age seems to be a fashionable question, it’s been extended,” he said, referencing French president Emmanuel Macron’s unpopular push for sweeping reforms to the country’s pension system.

The recent executive shake-ups could have knock-on effects, including a potential creative recasting. A designer has yet to be named to replace Louis Vuitton’s menswear creative director Virgil Abloh, who died in November 2021. The appointment at luxury’s biggest brands could provoke a fresh round of designer musical chairs (Kering flagship Gucci is also searching for a new creative chief.)

LVMH declined to comment on the menswear designer search at Vuitton.

The group’s share of net profit totalled EUR 14.08 billion (up 17%).

Sales of LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton’s luxury goods rose sharply in Europe, the United States and Japan, benefiting from strong demand from local customers and the recovery of international travel. On the other hand, sales in Asia were stable over the year due to developments in the health situation in China.

All business groups achieved significant organic revenue growth over the year. Fashion & Leather Goods notably reached record levels, with organic revenue growth of 20%. Profit from recurring operations stood at EUR 21.1 billion for 2022, up 23%. Operating margin remained at the same level as 2021. Group share of net profit was EUR 14.1 billion, up 17% compared to 2021. Operating free cash flow surpassed EUR 10 billion.

Selective retailing recorded a remarkable rebound, in particular for Sephora, which confirmed its place as world leader in the distribution of beauty products.

While the Perfumes & Cosmetics business group recorded revenue growth of 17% in 2022 (10% on an organic basis), profit from recurring operations was slightly down “as a result of a very selective policy of distribution to assert itself in the prestige universe,” said LVMH in a statement."
LVMH owner Bernard Arnault appoints daughter to run Dior - CNN,"Thu, 12 Jan 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vc3R5bGUvYXJ0aWNsZS9sdm1oLWJlcm5hcmQtYXJuYXVsdC1hcHBvaW50cy1kYXVnaHRlci1kZWxwaGluZS1hcm5hdWx0LWRpb3IvaW5kZXguaHRtbNIBYmh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLmNubi5jb20vY25uL3N0eWxlL2FydGljbGUvbHZtaC1iZXJuYXJkLWFybmF1bHQtYXBwb2ludHMtZGF1Z2h0ZXItZGVscGhpbmUtYXJuYXVsdC1kaW9y?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"CNN —

Luxury group LVMH’s billionaire owner Bernard Arnault, has appointed his daughter Delphine as the new head of Christian Dior, it was announced Wednesday.

The 47-year-old will serve as chair and CEO of the French label from February following a major shakeup at the conglomerate behind brands including Louis Vuitton, Fendi, Givenchy and Tiffany & Co.

Arnault, whose father became the world’s richest man last month, will move from Louis Vuitton, where she joined as executive vice president in 2013. She previously spent over a decade at Dior and has been closely involved in LVMH’s Prize for Young Fashion Designers.

In a press statement, Bernard Arnault described his daughter’s career at the company as “defined by excellence.”

“Under her leadership, the desirability of Louis Vuitton products advanced significantly, enabling the brand to regularly set new sales records,” he is quoted as saying. “Her keen insights and incomparable experience will be decisive assets in driving the ongoing development of Christian Dior.”

She joins the label as it looks to resume the sustained growth it enjoyed before the Covid-19 pandemic. The move also comes as Dior, like the rest of the luxury fashion industry, heads into a busy season of major shows and new collections. In the next two months, the label is set to present new menswear, couture and women’s ready-to-wear lines at upcoming editions of Paris Fashion Week.

Wednesday’s announcement follows a slew of recent changes unveiled by LVMH including a new role for Arnault’s second child, Antoine, who is stepping up to replace long-serving executive Sidney Toledano as CEO of the holding company through which the family owns its controlling stake in LVMH.

It was also announced on Wednesday that Dior’s outgoing boss Pietro Beccari will take over at Louis Vuitton, whose current CEO, Michael Burke, will remain in Arnault’s luxury empire in an undisclosed capacity. The conglomerate’s share price rose following news of the reshuffle.

In a statement, Bernard Arnault commended Beccari, who has been at Dior since 2018, for his “exceptional” work at the house. Along with creative directors Maria Grazia Chiuri and Kim Jones, who head the women’s and men’s divisions respectively, the Italian executive oversaw several important developments at the brand, including a move into beach accessories and a major renovation of the label’s Paris flagship.

Recent years have also seen Dior appoint powerful celebrity ambassadors and collaborators, from Travis Scott to tennis star Emma Raducanu and K-pop star Jisoo. The label has meanwhile staged increasingly ambitious shows — including a dramatic evening spectacle that used the illuminated pyramids of Giza as a backdrop for its Fall 2023 menswear collection — and expanded its presence in Asia. Last year, the fashion house hosted a show in South Korea for the very first time.

Sales at the house grew three-fold, to 6.6 billion euros ($7.1 billion), during Beccari’s four-year tenure, said Reuters, citing estimates from Citi.

Bernard Arnault is widely credited for transforming Dior’s fortunes over the years since first becoming involved with the brand in 1984. The 73-year-old, who is worth an estimated $171 billion, has signaled no intention of stepping down from his role at LVMH, with the company last year raising the maximum age of its CEO from 75 to 80, Reuters reported."
"Tesla share plunge puts market cap behind LVMH, Nvidia, Eli Lilly - Fortune","Wed, 04 Jan 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vZm9ydHVuZS5jb20vZXVyb3BlLzIwMjMvMDEvMDQvdGVzbGEtc2hhcmVzLW1hcmtldC1jYXAtbHZtaC1lbG9uLW11c2stY2VvLWJlcm5hcmQtYXJuYXVsdC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Tesla continues to slip in the rankings of the world’s most valuable companies as its share price plunge continues into 2023.

Tesla shares fell 12.2% on Tuesday, after the electric car company failed to meet expectations on fourth-quarter deliveries. The company’s shares have fallen 72.7% in the past year.

Tesla’s market capitalization is now just $339 billion, putting it behind companies like Walmart, Nvidia, and Eli Lilly.

The share price plunge also puts Tesla behind LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, the world’s largest luxury goods group. As of Wednesday, LVMH’s market capitalization is $389 billion. Unlike Tesla, shares in LVMH have largely held steady, with only a 2.5% drop in the past year after recovering from a slump over the summer.

In October 2021, Tesla became one of a few U.S. companies with a market valuation over $1 trillion, alongside companies like Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon. (Amazon has since also slipped from the $1 trillion club.)

Tesla faces softer demand for its electric vehicles in markets like the U.S. and China, and is reportedly slowing production at its factories. Tesla investors also blame Musk’s simultaneous leadership of Twitter for the fall in share price. Musk, for his part, blames interest rate policy from the U.S. Federal Reserve for Tesla’s share troubles.

Arnault vs. Musk

LVMH co-founder and CEO Arnault replaced Tesla CEO Musk as the world’s richest person in mid-December. The change in rankings was due to the massive slide in Tesla’s shares, which makes up a sizable share of Musk’s net worth.

As of Wednesday, Arnault has a fortune of around $169 billion, compared to Musk’s $128 billion, estimates Bloomberg.

Musk’s fortune, at its peak in November 2021, was worth $338 billion. Arnault at the time was worth $172 billion.

The Tesla CEO’s fortune keeps on dropping, shrinking by just over $9 billion on Tuesday alone. (India’s Gautam Adani, currently the world’s third-richest person, has a fortune of $119 billion, according to Bloomberg.)"

The world’s top luxury group LVMH said on January 26 that its sales and net profit both hit new heights last year, driven by strong demand in Europe, the United States and Japan.

“Europe, the United States and Japan rose sharply, benefiting from strong demand from local customers and the recovery of international travel. Asia was stable over the year due to developments in the health situation in China,” LVMH said in a statement.

“With the month of January having started well and despite an uncertain geopolitical and economic environment, LVMH is confident in its ability to continue the growth observed in 2022.”

LVMH is headed by French billionaire Bernard Arnault, who overtook Tesla and Twitter boss Elon Musk as the world’s richest man late last year.

The maker of champagne, handbags, jewellery and other luxury goods is Europe’s most valuable company, with a market capitalisation that soared to US$430 billion (400 billion euros) last week.

Sales in its flagship division of fashion and leather goods increased 25 per cent, while for watches and jewellery they grew 18 per cent, the group said.

High-end jeweller Tiffany, which was bought by LVMH in 2021, saw a record year, it added without giving a breakdown of its sales.

Wines and spirits also saw strong growth last year.

“We had a very difficult month of December in China,” LVMH chief financial officer Jean-Jacques Guiony told reporters.

He said the situation had improved, although he did not see Chinese tourists returning to Europe “straight away”.

LVMH will pay shareholders a dividend of US$13 (12 euros) per share, up from US$11 (10 euros) the previous year.

“LVMH is the jewel in luxury’s crown. Bernard Arnault’s empire has seen its valuation swell over 200 per cent in the last five years, and momentum doesn’t appear to be running out,” said Sophie Lund-Yates, lead equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown.

Arnault, 73, has reshuffled the company’s leadership in recent months, appointing his children to top jobs as the family tightens its hold on LVMH, a group born from the 1987 merger of trunk-maker Louis Vuitton and the wines and spirits group Moët Hennessy.

His eldest son, Antoine Arnault , was named CEO of holding company Christian Dior SE, which controls LVMH, in December, and also holds other positions within the group.

Earlier this month, he announced that his daughter, Delphine Arnault, would take over as head of the Dior perfume and fashion brand on February 1.

French multinational LVMH, which owns brands like Tiffany’s, Christian Dior, Sephora, and Moët, had a “record year” in 2022, it said in a press release yesterday (Jan. 26). It recorded revenue of €79.2 billion ($86.2 billion) in 2022 and profit from recurring operations of €21.1 billion ($23 billion), both up 23%.

Despite geopolitical headwinds and China’s zero-covid policy, LVMH saw sales rise “sharply” in Europe, the US, and Japan, owing to “strong demand from local customers and the recovery of international travel.” LVMH also exited Russia last year, but that market was a sliver compared to US and China for the luxury behemoth.

Meanwhile, Swedish fast fashion retailer H&M—the second-largest fast fashion retailer after Inditex, the parent company of brands like Zara, Massimo Dutti, and Bershka— wasn’t so resilient. Its net profit for the year ending Nov. 30 fell 68% from the year prior to 3.6 billion Swedish kronor ($349 million).

Pausing sales in February and exiting Russia altogether in July hit H&M’s profits hard, chief executive Helena Helmersson admitted, saying it was “an important and profitable market” whose loss “has had a significant negative impact on our results.”

Helmersson also cited “the hikes in raw materials and freight costs combined with a historically strong US dollar” as reasons for pushing the cost of raw materials up. “On top of this there were increased energy costs as well as a one-time charge for the cost and efficiency programme that was initiated at the end of the year,” she added. A drive to cut costs, including layoffs in November, did little to curtail the damage.

One big number: A €540-580 billion luxury market

The resilient luxury market’s value is set to reach €540-580 billion ($588-631 billion) by 2030, up from €353 billion estimated for 2022—a 60% uptick—according to a November 2022 report by consulting firm Bain & Co. An estimated current 200 million luxury customers are set to grow to 500 million by the end of the decade. The luxury consumer base is both larger and more concentrated, and globally, there’s various opportunities that could help propel the market:

🇨🇳 T he strength of economic recovery in China

🇺🇸🇪🇺 T he ability of the US and Europe to withstand economic headwinds

🇮🇳 India’s luxury market could potentially expand to 3.5 times today’s size by 2030

Quotable: A generational shift among luxury buyers

“In coming years, the spending of Gen Z and ‘Gen Alpha’ is set to grow some three times faster than for other generations until 2030, making up a third of the market. This is, in part, driven by a more precocious attitude towards luxury, with Gen Z consumers starting to buy luxury items some 3 to 5 years earlier than Millennials (at 15 years-old, versus at 18-20), and Gen Alpha expected to behave in a similar way.” -Bain & Co November 2022 luxury study

Company of interest: Inditex

Not all fast fashion retailers struggled. H&M rival Inditex in December posted a 24% jump in profit for the nine months through October as it used price hikes to ward off weakening consumer demand.

“The sales outperformance may reflect the quality of the product design and offering as well as the more attractive price point compared to peers as price increases appear to be less than the wider market,” Deutsche Bank analyst Adam Cochrane told Reuters. The more luxe approach may have helped lure luxury buyers.

Inditex appears to be taking inspiration from retailers like Vancouver-based Aritzia, who slot themselves in the “everyday luxury” category to benefit from a similar approach of designing elevated, longer-lasting garments to slap on somewhat steep price tags.

LVMH posted record results Thursday, and expressed confidence that China’s luxury market would bounce back this year as the country continues to reopen.

The world’s biggest luxury group logged revenue of €79.2 billion ($86.2 billion) and profit of €21.1 billion ($22.9 billion) for 2022, both up 23%.

In a presentation, the company said it was buoyed by the recovery of international travel and strong demand from local customers across Europe, the United States and Japan.

And in the coming months, “we have every reason to [be] confident, indeed optimistic, on the Chinese market,” LVMH (LVMHF) CEO Bernard Arnault said on a conference call.

“There are green shoots in China,” he told analysts. “In Macao, where Chinese can now travel to, the change is quite spectacular. Stores are full. It’s really come back [at a] very strong pace.”

The owner of brands such as Louis Vuitton and Sephora also has various stores in France that are ready to welcome Chinese shoppers as more travel restrictions are rolled back, Arnault said. He predicted, though, that Chinese tourists would not return in large numbers until at least the second half of the year.

China lifted some of the world’s toughest Covid-19 border restrictions this month after nearly three years, scrapping a quarantine requirement for international travelers.

Arnault noted that while LVMH was seeing signs of recovery, it was still “early days.”

“We can’t guarantee it’s going to continue like that,” he said. “[But] if it continues as it is, it will be an excellent year.”

Chief Financial Officer Jean-Jacques Guiony also cautioned that the current level of customer traffic in China was still about 40% below pre-pandemic levels, and that the economic outlook was tough to predict.

But in another sign of optimism, LVMH proposed to hike its 2022 dividend on Thursday, from 10 euros to 12 euros per share. The proposal will be up for approval at the company’s general meeting in April.

LVMH is the latest luxury giant to deliver an upbeat forecast over China’s reopening. Last week, Swatch Group (SWGAF), the owner of Omega and Harry Winston, predicted “a record year in 2023,” based on strong sales growth it had already seen this month in China.

“After the end of Covid measures, consumption quickly recovered, not only in China,” but also in the nearby cities of Hong Kong and Macao, the Swiss watchmaker said in a statement.

The removal of Chinese travel restrictions will likely also boost sales in overseas tourist destinations, the company added.

Burberry (BBRYF), too, has pointed to signs of “a good recovery” in China this month, following a slump caused by the country’s Covid-19 outbreaks and lockdowns in the last quarter.

Sales in mainland China fell 23% in the three months ended December, the British brand said whilst reporting earnings last week.

“While the timing and pace of recovery remains uncertain for the rest of this year, we are confident in the opportunity and the long term prospects of the Chinese market,” Julie Brown, the company’s chief operating and financial officer, told analysts."

The 47-year-old had been an executive vice president at Louis Vuitton, LVMH's biggest brand, since 2013, and will serve as chair and CEO of the French label starting in February, LVMH announced Tuesday.

""The appointment of Delphine Arnault is another milestone in a career journey in fashion and leather goods defined by excellence, first during 12 years at Christian Dior and then at Louis Vuitton for the past decade where she was number two with responsibility for all of the Maison's product activities,"" Bernard Arnault said in a statement.

The Frenchman cofounded the luxury conglomerate in 1987. LVMH also owns brands including Sephora, Fendi, Marc Jacobs, Givenchy, Moët & Chandon, Fenty Beauty, Tiffany & Co, TAG Heuer, and Bulgari. It is Europe's most valuable company.

Arnault praised his daughter in the statement, saying that ""under her leadership, the desirability of Louis Vuitton products advanced significantly, enabling the brand to regularly set new sales records. Her keen insights and incomparable experience will be decisive assets in driving the ongoing development of Christian Dior.""

Pietro Beccari, who has been the head of Dior since 2018, will now be moving to replace long-time Louis Vuitton CEO Michael Burke. Arnault commended Beccari for his ""exceptional"" work at the house. Burke — who is Arnault's longest-serving lieutenant, and has also been chairman of jewellery label Tiffany — will continue to work alongside Bernard Arnault, the statement said.

Bloomberg estimates Arnault's fortune at $178 billion. He overtook Elon Musk in December 2022 as the world's richest man.

Arnault has four other sons, each of which also hold management positions at LVMH and its brands.

Paris, January 26th, 2023

LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, the world’s leading luxury goods group, recorded revenue of €79.2 billion in 2022 and profit from recurring operations of €21.1 billion, both up 23%.

All business groups achieved significant organic revenue growth over the year (see table on page 3). Fashion & Leather Goods notably reached record levels, with organic revenue growth of 20%. Profit from recurring operations stood at €21.1 billion for 2022, up 23%. Operating margin remained at the same level as 2021. Group share of net profit was €14.1 billion, up 17% compared to 2021. Operating free cash flow surpassed €10 billion.

Europe, the United States and Japan rose sharply, benefiting from strong demand from local customers and the recovery of international travel. Asia was stable over the year due to developments in the health situation in China.

Bernard Arnault, Chairman and CEO of LVMH, said: “Our performance in 2022 illustrates the exceptional appeal of our Maisons and their ability to create desire during a year affected by economic and geopolitical challenges. The Group once again recorded significant growth in revenue and earnings. Our growth strategy, based on the complementary nature of our activities, as well as their geographic diversity, encourages innovation and the quality of our creations, the excellence of their distribution, and adds a cultural and historical dimension thanks to the heritage of our Maisons. This was showcased during our hugely successful LVMH Journées Particulières, when we opened our doors to all in fifteen countries in 2022 and saw a record number of visitors come to learn about the know-how of our artisans. We approach 2023 with confidence but remain vigilant due to current uncertainties. We count on the desirability of our Maisons and the agility of our teams to further strengthen our lead in the global luxury market and support France’s prestige throughout the world.”

Wines & Spirits: record level of revenue and earnings

The Wines & Spirits business group recorded revenue growth of 19% in 2022 (11% on an organic basis). Profit from recurring operations was up 16%. Champagne volumes were up 6%, driven by sustained demand leading to growing pressure on supplies. Momentum was particularly strong in Europe, Japan and in emerging markets, particularly in “high energy” channels and gastronomy. Hennessy cognac benefited from its value creation strategy. The dynamic policy of price increases offset the effects of the health situation in China, while the United States was affected at the start of the year by logistical disruptions. Still wines, in particular the Château d’Esclans rosé, achieved an excellent performance. Moët Hennessy strengthened its global portfolio of exceptional wines with the acquisition of the Joseph Phelps vineyard, one of the most renowned wine properties in Napa Valley, California.

Fashion & Leather Goods: exceptional performances by Louis Vuitton, Christian Dior, Celine, Fendi, Loro Piana, Loewe and Marc Jacobs

The Fashion & Leather Goods business group recorded revenue growth of 25% in 2022 (20% on an organic basis). Profit from recurring operations was up 22%. Louis Vuitton had an excellent year, again driven by its exceptional creativity, the quality of its products and its strong ties with art and culture. The women's ready-to-wear fashion shows created by Nicolas Ghesquière were extremely well-received. Many new products were unveiled in leather goods, jewelry and watches. Meanwhile, the new ""LV Dream"" exhibition in Paris pays tribute to 160 years of creative exchanges that fuel Louis Vuitton's spirit of innovation, and a new collaboration with Japanese artist Yayoi Kusama was unveiled, revisiting iconic creations of the Maison. Christian Dior continued its remarkable growth trajectory across all its product lines. After three years of renovations, the Maison’s historic store at 30 avenue Montaigne, which reopened in Paris in early 2022, enjoyed huge success, offering a new experience of the highest refinement. Its fashion shows continued to offer exceptional moments, whether in Seville, Spain, for the women's collections of Maria Grazia Chiuri, or in Egypt at the foot of the Giza pyramids for the men's show imagined by Kim Jones. Celine experienced very strong growth thanks to the success of Hedi Slimane's creations and his extremely modern and precise vision, as did Loewe, driven by the strong creativity of J.W. Anderson. Fendi celebrated the 25th anniversary of its iconic Baguette bag in New York. Loro Piana, Rimowa and Marc Jacobs also had an excellent year.

Perfumes & Cosmetics: strong momentum in perfume and continued selective distribution

The Perfumes & Cosmetics business group recorded revenue growth of 17% in 2022 (10% on an organic basis). Profit from recurring operations was slightly down as a result of a very selective policy of distribution to assert itself in the prestige universe. Christian Dior enjoyed a remarkable performance, strengthening its lead. Sauvage confirmed its position as the world's leading perfume, while the iconic women's fragrances Miss Dior and J'adore, enriched with its latest creation Parfum d'Eau, continued to grow. Dior Addict in make-up and Prestige in skincare also contributed to the rapid growth of the Maison. Guerlain sustained its growth, driven notably by the vitality of its Abeille Royale skincare, its Aqua Allegoria collection and its exceptional perfumes L’Art et la Matière. Parfums Givenchy benefited from the continued success of its fragrances. Fenty Beauty doubled its revenue thanks to the expansion of its distribution network and the success of its launches.

Watches & Jewelry: rapid growth in jewelry and watches

The Watches & Jewelry business group recorded revenue growth of 18% in 2022 (12% on an organic basis). Profit from recurring operations was up 20%. Tiffany & Co. had a record year, driven by its increasing desirability. While its High Jewelry revenue doubled, the new Lock bracelet collection, rolled out in North America, enjoyed great success alongside other iconic lines. The “Vision & Virtuosity” exhibition at the Saatchi Gallery in London showcased 185 years of creativity and know-how of the Maison over the summer. Bvlgari confirmed its strong momentum, particularly in Europe, Japan and the United States. The iconic Serpenti line and the High Jewelry and High Watchmaking collections were the main growth drivers. The Octo Finissimo Ultra watch broke a new record of thinness. Chaumet had a good year and celebrated nature with its “Végétal” exhibition in Paris. Fred showed strong growth and launched its first retrospective exhibition at the Palais de Tokyo in Paris. In the watchmaking sector, TAG Heuer unveiled, among other innovations, the Carrera Plasma, an avant-garde fusion of watchmaking and lab grown diamonds. As official timekeeper, Hublot enjoyed strong visibility during the 2022 Football World Cup. Zenith continued to expand its in-store and online distribution.

Selective Retailing: excellent performance by Sephora; DFS impacted by the health situation in China

Selective Retailing revenue was up 26% in 2022 (17% on an organic basis). Profit from recurring operations was up 48%. With a strong rebound in activity in its stores, Sephora enjoyed a record performance in both revenue and earnings. Momentum was particularly strong in North America, Europe, the Middle East and in most Southeast Asian countries. Further investments were made into Sephora's omnichannel strategy in order to continuously improve its customers’ purchasing experience both online and in-store. The network continued to expand notably due to the partnership with Kohl's in the United States. Sephora’s Russian business was divested. DFS was still affected by the health situation in China. The flagship destinations of Hong Kong and Macau particularly suffered as a result of the suspension of domestic travel and the complete absence of tourists but just reopened in January. Le Bon Marché, which is growing strongly, continued to develop innovative concepts and benefit from the return of loyal French customers and international travellers.

Confidence in 2023

With the month of January having started well and despite an uncertain geopolitical and economic environment, LVMH is confident in its ability to continue the growth observed in 2022. The Group will pursue its brand development focused strategy, underpinned by continued innovation and investment as well as a constant quest for desirability and quality in its products and their distribution.

Driven by the agility of its teams, their entrepreneurial spirit and its well diversified presence across businesses and geographic areas in which its customers are located, LVMH enters 2023 with confidence and once again, sets an objective of reinforcing its global leadership position in luxury goods.

Dividend 2022

At the General Meeting of April 20, 2023, LVMH will propose a dividend of 12 euros per share. An interim dividend of 5 euros per share was paid on December 5 of last year. The balance of 7 euros will be paid on April 27, 2023.

The Board of Directors met on January 26th to approve the financial statements for 2022. Audit procedures have been carried out and the audit report is being issued.

Battle for succession in house of Dior: siblings jostle to seize family crown - The Guardian,"Sat, 14 Jan 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy8yMDIzL2phbi8xNC9zdWNjZXNzaW9uLXN0cnVnZ2xlLXJhZ2VzLWZvci1sdXh1cnktZ2lhbnQtbHZtaC1iZXJuYXJkLWFybmF1bHTSAXBodHRwczovL2FtcC50aGVndWFyZGlhbi5jb20vYnVzaW5lc3MvMjAyMy9qYW4vMTQvc3VjY2Vzc2lvbi1zdHJ1Z2dsZS1yYWdlcy1mb3ItbHV4dXJ5LWdpYW50LWx2bWgtYmVybmFyZC1hcm5hdWx0?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The march of luxury stepped up its pace last week when Bernard Arnault, co-founder, chairman and chief executive of LVMH –AKA “the wolf in cashmere” and the world’s wealthiest man – handed his daughter Delphine the keys to Christian Dior, the Parisian couture house that, in 1947, kickstarted the modern fashion industry with the New Look.

The symbolism of the move was hard to miss: for months, observers have speculated on succession plans within Europe’s most valuable company, a purveyor of fashion, champagne, jewellery and real estate that is at the heart of the global luxury ecosystem.

Many observers pointed to the fictional Roy family in Succession – based on the Murdoch clan. The Roys, they said, had nothing on the Arnaults. Four sons, one daughter, each with roles in the empire, vying for control. And now the eldest daughter, at 47, has been placed at the head of Dior, a brand that is symbolically, if not economically, significant.

The luggage and handbag specialist Louis Vuitton accounts for half the parent company’s profits, but Dior was the first house that Arnault, 73, bought in 1984 after a tip from a New York cab driver. It is therefore, in familial dynastic and emotional terms, at its centre.

The elevation of Delphine, a former student at the London School of Economics and the oldest of Arnault’s children, means that she is the only child to serve both on the board of directors and the executive committee of the parent company LVMH, as well as being charged with the supervision of all product-related activities.

It was Delphine who steered Dior during the creative frenzy of John Galliano, and who serves as envoy to designers on whose creative shoulders the empire depends.

For the next year – at least – that will include a Louis Vuitton product-and-marketing blitz centred on a collaboration with 93-year-old Yayoi Kusama, the Japanese artist known for polka dots, metallic orbs, pumpkins and “infinity mirror rooms” – all likely to pop up anywhere that LVMH’s customers do, which is to say within the Instagrammable districts, resorts, activities and art destinations that form the ecology of global ultra-wealth.

Under the leadership of Delphine, Arnault said, “the desirability of Louis Vuitton products advanced significantly, enabling the brand to regularly set new sales records. Her keen insights and incomparable experience will be decisive assets in driving the ongoing development of Christian Dior.”

Delphine’s promotion came less than a month after her younger brother Antoine was appointed chief executive of holding company Christian Dior SE, which controls LVMH, and vice-chairman of its board.

Some interpreted that as kicking off a succession battle within the $418bn (£340bn) hereditary-oriented company. Just as the Murdoch empire is often thought of as an expression of one man’s drive – and could fall apart without its earthly creator – so it is with Arnault, 18 years Rupert Murdoch’s junior and 10 times wealthier.

“Nothing at LVMH is ever done in a rush,” says Thomas Chauvet, a luxury analyst at Citi. “The demand drivers of this industry have been the same for 20 or 30 years – global economic growth, wealth-effect, global travel, and Chinese consumerism in an industry characterised by high barriers to entry and pricing power Everything is thought through because there is a family ownership, and they probably went through a lot of candidates and decided she is the most competent to run the brand.”

But Arnaut recently wiggled LVMH’s corporate structure to extend his tenure until he reaches 80 or beyond. Last week, he also moved Pietro Beccari, who has led Christian Dior Couture since 2018 and boosted sales fourfold to €8.7bn, to replace Michael Burke, a 40-year veteran, as Louis Vuitton’s next chairman and chief executive.

With estimated sales of €21.8bn last year, Burke turned Louis Vuitton into an economic powerhouse – including a 2017 collaboration with Supreme that kicked off the luxury streetwear category. Louis Vuitton now accounts for more than half of LVMH’s profits.

Crucially, it is Beccari who is overseeing the seamless integration of Tiffany, the US jewellery business that Arnault bought two years ago for $16bn, which is run by the youngest of the clan, 29-year-old Alexandre Arnault.

The announcements came as China, whose avid luxury consumers account for one-third of global luxury sales, announced it is lifting zero-Covid travel restrictions. Retailers are hoping for the kind of spending that came when Covid restrictions were briefly lifted in 2020, and this comes just as US consumers, who have kept luxury spending going over the past three years, are starting to flag.

“We see no clouds on the LVMH horizon,” commented Luca Solca at the luxury goods analyst firm Bernstein, which estimates Chinese luxury spending could rise 35% this year.

But the appointment of Delphine may be significant in other respects. Women are increasingly rising to the top of creative roles in a field typically dominated by men. “Anecdotally, you hear that Dior is flying off the shelves – perhaps because female designers understand what women want to wear and what they’re going to buy,” says fashion journalist Amy Odell.

Dior is only one piece of a puzzle of how LVMH became the world’s biggest luxury-goods conglomerate, with 75 labels ranging from fashion and jewellery, to champagne, hotels and art foundations – and high-end dog food.

Part of LVMH’s success has been to spearhead the development of the luxury industry. Controlling distribution means controlling price, controlling the shopping experience and, often, the surrounding environment, whether that’s in Paris, London, Shanghai, New York, Singapore or Milan.

“The reality is that strategy revolves around Louis Vuitton delivering steady growth year-in and year-out,” Chauvet says. “They can do experimentation, in jewellery or watches or fragrance or collaborations, and some may become new product categories, but the permanent static dogma is no wholesale and no discounts”.

William Middleton, Paris-based fashion writer and author of a forthcoming biography of Karl Lagerfeld, Paradise Now, describes the extraordinary growth of the French fashion and luxury conglomerates over the past three decades. Back in the 90s, he says, the industry in New York or Milan was more sophisticated commercially. The formation of LVMH and Kering (PPR), and the importing of talents, such as Galliano or Alexander McQueen, or buying houses like Gucci, heralded an explosion of growth.

“In the 90s, Chanel had its offices at 31 Rue Cambon, a lovely little building where Karl worked on the top floor. Now, they’ve taken over the whole street and have maybe 1,200 people working there. Chloé had its offices above a shop on Rue Saint-Honoré. Now it has two or three buildings for the archives. Yves Saint Laurent had his two-storey headquarters at 5 Avenue Marceau; it’s now a 140,000 sq ft complex that was the monastery of the Abbaye de Penthemont.

“There’s a French word, démesurée, which means excessive or out of scale,” Middleton adds. As the luxury industry gears up for its autumn-winter ready-to-wear presentations, for the marketing extravaganzas in exotic locations, for the celebrities and handbags, démesurée is a word to keep in mind.

“The scale of these companies, of the business of fashion in Paris, is now just so enormous, and Bernard Arnault is a huge part of that.”

Billionaires and their succession battles

The Murdochs

It has long been assumed that Lachlan Murdoch would take control of Fox Corporation and News Corp on the death of his father, the 91-year-old Australian billionaire Rupert Murdoch. Now a new biography, The Successor: The High-Stakes Life of Lachlan Murdoch, by Paddy Manning, suggests that the media mogul’s oldest son could be ousted in a Succession-style family fallout with his siblings James and Elisabeth Murdoch and half-sister Prudence MacLeod.

Lachlan has led the family business with his father since 2014. In July 2020, Lachlan’s brother James resigned from the board of News Corp, blaming “disagreements over certain editorial content published by the company’s news outlets and certain other strategic decisions”.

The Redstones

Having been made president of National Amusements, the family’s private holding company, Shari Redstone seemed to be her father Sumner M Redstone’s obvious heir. But just as she appeared to be gaining influence in the company, which controlled Viacom and CBS (which later became ViacomCBS and is now known as Paramount Global), the media mogul, then in his 80s, publicly said she wasn’t qualified for the role.

In a case that was later settled, her brother Brent sued their father in 2006, trying to break up the company and claiming he had been overlooked for his sister. In 2015, she reportedly told her son in an email: “Your grandfather says I will be chair over his dead body.”

Amid further fallouts as he entered his final years, also involving other women in his life, father and daughter made peace, and she cared for him in his mansion until his death aged 97. She went on to lead the family empire.

The Rineharts

After her father Lang Hancock’s death in 1992, Gina Rinehart claims to have saved his mining company and built the value of a $5bn family trust. She said her father had warned her she would “rue the day” that her late mother’s shares in Hancock Prospecting were used for her children’s benefit – a prediction that she later found to be true. In 2015, her daughter Bianca was granted control of the trust following a bitter legal battle.

In 2019, the high court granted Rinehart the right for another dispute with her children – over allegations that she wrongfully transferred valuable mining assets away from one trust to another – to be heard privately.

Bernard Arnault's LVMH Becomes First European Company To Break €400 Billion Market Value - Jing Daily,"Fri, 20 Jan 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiOWh0dHBzOi8vamluZ2RhaWx5LmNvbS9wb3N0cy9sdm1oLTQwMC1iaWxsaW9uLW1hcmtldC12YWx1ZdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"What happened

On January 17, LVMH shares rose to a record high, granting the owner of Louis Vuitton, Christian Dior, and Tiffany & Co. a market capitalization of €400 billion (434 billion) for the first time. This solidifies the group’s status as Europe’s most valuable company, after first claiming the title back in 2021 when LVMH eclipsed Nestle with a market capitalization of around €264.6 billion (319.4 billion).

The Jing Take

With news of China reopening its borders and welcoming foreign investment, LVMH isn’t the only one benefiting. Rival luxury house Richemont’s shares were up 1.4 percent upon the reopening announcement, while Burberry’s rose 2.5 percent to their best level since January 2020. Both companies are optimistic about the market’s recovery — despite reporting tanking sales during the quarter ended December 31 — as the Lunar New Year holiday approaches near the end of January.

While the mainland’s relaxation of zero-COVID policies has certainly given luxury names a boost, it’s not the only driver of LVMH’s growth. In October, the French conglomerate beat analyst expectations when its fashion and leather goods division rose 22 percent to €9.69 billion (10.4 billion), driven by new products under Louis Vuitton, the reopening of Christian Dior’s Avenue Montaigne flagship in Paris, and strong progress of ready-to-wear at Celine. On this note, LVMH naturally benefits from its extensive ecosystem of brands — 75 houses in six different sectors — most recently adding jewelry group Pedemonte Group to its roster.

Whether or not LVMH shares will continue to skyrocket at this pace remains to be seen, especially after China fully reopens and revenge shopping tendencies taper out. There are also concerns from analysts that its stock is overbought. Regardless, the luxury titan is not getting comfortable at the top, announcing a major reshuffle of top management earlier this month — including the appointment of LVMH chairman Bernard Arnault’s daughter, Delphine Arnault, and Dior’s Pietro Beccari as the new heads of Christian Dior and Louis Vuitton, respectively — a move that could bring fresh growth for its storied labels.

Although LVMH still falls behind behemoths like Apple (worth over 2.1 trillion) on the list of the world’s most valuable companies, its success further separates it from competitors like Hermès and Richemont, with market caps of 183 billion and 83 billion , respectively. In other words, LVMH’s luxury reign is only beginning.

LVMH billionaire Bernard Arnault appoints daughter to run Dior - The Guardian,"Wed, 11 Jan 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy8yMDIzL2phbi8xMS9iZXJuYXJkLWFybmF1bHQtYXBwb2ludHMtZGF1Z2h0ZXItZGVscGhpbmUtZGlvci1jaGllZi1leGVjdXRpdmUtbHZtaNIBdWh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy8yMDIzL2phbi8xMS9iZXJuYXJkLWFybmF1bHQtYXBwb2ludHMtZGF1Z2h0ZXItZGVscGhpbmUtZGlvci1jaGllZi1leGVjdXRpdmUtbHZtaA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Bernard Arnault, the world’s richest person, has appointed his eldest daughter, Delphine, to run Christian Dior, the second-biggest brand in his €382bn (£337bn) luxury goods empire LVMH.

The reorganisation comes after an extraordinary year for Arnault, in which the 73-year-old’s personal fortune overtook that of the US entrepreneur Elon Musk, while a surge in the LVMH share price nudged the combined value of companies listed in Paris above London.

Arnault is cementing family control over a business he co-founded 35 years ago, in a move seen by many in the fashion industry as setting up a succession battle between Delphine, 47, and her brother Antoine, 45, who was promoted last month to run the holding company that controls LVMH and the $178bn (£147bn) Arnault fortune.

However, the contest could extend to all five of Arnault’s children. Delphine and Antoine, from his first marriage to Anne Dewavrin, now have top roles at LVMH. But all three of his children with his second wife, Hélène Mercier, also have important jobs within the world’s largest luxury goods company, that also includes brands such as Stella McCartney, TAG Heuer, Bulgari and Tiffany.

Alexandre Arnault, 30, is an executive at Tiffany, Frederic Arnault, 28, is chief executive of TAG Heuer, while the youngest child, Jean Arnault, 24, heads marketing and product development for Louis Vuitton’s watches division.

Some analysts have compared the competition between the Arnault children to that of Rupert Murdoch’s offspring or that of the Roys in the hit TV show Succession.

Luca Solca, an analyst at investment firm Bernstein, has said Arnault is creating a “Darwinian contest” to succeed him as chief executive of LVMH, which he co-founded in 1987. The secret of his success, says Solca, was the invention of a paradox: “selling exclusivity by the million”.

The heirs may, however, have some time to wait until taking over the running of the family firm, as it changed the company’s bylaws last year to allow a chief executive to continue running the firm until the age of 80, up from the previous 75.

Arnault announced on Wednesday that Delphine, now the executive vice-president of Louis Vuitton, will become Dior’s chief executive and chair from 1 February.

“Under Delphine’s leadership, the desirability of Louis Vuitton products advanced significantly, enabling the brand to regularly set new sales records,” he said. “Her keen insights and incomparable experience will be decisive assets in driving the ongoing development of Christian Dior.”

Delphine Arnault joined the family business in 2000 after two years at the management consultancy firm McKinsey and studying at the London School of Economics. She joined the LVMH board in 2003 – becoming the first woman and youngest person to serve on it.

The appointment marks a return to the brand Arnault first worked for in 2001, where she started working on shoes before rising to become a deputy general manager and liaising directly with Dior’s then creative director, John Galliano.

She was credited with minimising the fallout from Galliano’s racist and antisemitic rants at people in a Paris bar in 2011 that led to him being sacked and convicted for racism and antisemitism.

Delphine Arnault has said she was not heavily exposed to the family’s brands or extreme wealth as a child, but remembers getting a brown Louis Vuitton Noé bag (now retailing at £1,160) on her 18th birthday and attending her first lavish party when she was 21.

“I remember very well the 100-year ceremony, in 1996. There was a big party and at the top of the room was Naomi Campbell arriving on stage on a giraffe,” she told the Financial Times in 2014.

She is married to Xavier Niel, a French telecoms billionaire and co-owner of daily newspaper Le Monde, whose extensive collection of assets include rights to the song My Way popularised by Frank Sinatra.

Her younger brother Antoine, who graduated from HEC Montreal and holds an MBA from the business school Insead, is said to have been the brains behind a recent Louis Vuitton advertising campaign that featured Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi facing off in a chess game photographed by Annie Leibovitz."
Who is Bernard Arnault? The new world’s richest person admires Buffett and Jobs while running Louis Vuitton and Dior - CNBC,"Thu, 05 Jan 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tLzIwMjMvMDEvMDUvbHZtaC1jZW8tYmVybmFyZC1hcm5hdWx0LXdvcmxkcy1yaWNoZXN0LXBlcnNvbi1hZG1pcmVzLWJ1ZmZldHQtam9icy5odG1s0gFsaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY25iYy5jb20vYW1wLzIwMjMvMDEvMDUvbHZtaC1jZW8tYmVybmFyZC1hcm5hdWx0LXdvcmxkcy1yaWNoZXN0LXBlcnNvbi1hZG1pcmVzLWJ1ZmZldHQtam9icy5odG1s?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LVMH chair Bernard Arnault speaks at the Viva Technology conference in June 2017 in Paris, France

When Elon Musk became the first person in history to lose more than $200 billion in net worth, the door opened for someone new atop the rankings of the world's wealthiest people. That would be France's Bernard Arnault, the 73-year-old co-founder and CEO of LVMH, the luxury goods conglomerate known for operating iconic brands like Louis Vuitton, Tiffany and Christian Dior. Arnault passed Musk to become the world's most wealthy person last month. He still holds that title today, according to estimates from Forbes and Bloomberg. Forbes pegs his net worth at $191 billion, while Bloomberg offers a more conservative estimate of $172 billion, as of Thursday. Either way, he's been a billionaire for years — using strategies gleaned from Steve Jobs and Warren Buffett to build wealth and ascend the rankings.

Who is Arnault?

The French multibillionaire's name should certainly ring some bells. He's been a fixture near the top of the world's wealthiest people rankings for years, even nabbing the top spot from Amazon's Jeff Bezos as recently as 2021 before moving aside for Musk. The son of a construction magnate, Arnault took over his father's firm in the 1970s and eventually pivoted to real estate before moving on to textiles and retail. In 1985, he began building what is now LVMH by taking $15 million from his family business to buy Christian Dior from its bankrupt owners. He still holds a 97.5% stake in the iconic French luxury fashion house.

Over the subsequent three-plus decades, Arnault expanded his luxury retail empire by helping merge Louis Vuitton with spirits company Moët Hennessy and taking a controlling stake in the resulting holding company, called LVMH. Today, he controls roughly half of LVMH, which has a market valuation of nearly $390 billion. It recorded nearly $60 billion in sales over the first 9 months of 2022. Arnault likes to frequently check in on the retail locations of LVMH's brands and their competitors, reportedly visiting up to 25 locations some days. He's also publicly taken pride in maintaining and growing some of France's most iconic brands and designers. ""I see myself as an ambassador of French heritage and French culture,"" he told Forbes in 2010. ""What we create is emblematic.""

How did he become the world's wealthiest person?

Arnault's recent ascension to the top of the billionaire rankings coincides with the rapid evaporation of a huge chunk of Musk's wealth, following the Tesla and SpaceX CEO's takeover of Twitter in October 2022. Amid global market turmoil, Arnault's wealth has held fairly steady in recent months. The vast majority of Arnault's wealth is tied to LVMH's stock, and since 2020, the company's stock price has grown by nearly 65% overall. Correspondingly, Arnault's personal fortune has grown by tens of billions of dollars over that period. Forbes estimates that Arnault's fortune more than doubled to $150 billion last year, up from $76 billion in 2020, as demand for luxury goods rose after an initial pandemic dip.

"Luxury Titan LVMH Is Now Worth $434 Billion, Thanks to Soaring Share Prices - Robb Report","Tue, 17 Jan 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vcm9iYnJlcG9ydC5jb20vbGlmZXN0eWxlL2ZpbmFuY2UvbHZtaC1zb2FyaW5nLXNoYXJlLXByaWNlcy0xMjM0Nzk2MTM4L9IBUmh0dHBzOi8vcm9iYnJlcG9ydC5jb20vbGlmZXN0eWxlL2ZpbmFuY2UvbHZtaC1zb2FyaW5nLXNoYXJlLXByaWNlcy0xMjM0Nzk2MTM4L2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LVMH just reached dizzying new heights of prosperity.

Shares in the world’s largest luxury group climbed as much as 0.4 percent on Tuesday morning to a record high of $860 (€795.7), according to Reuters. As a result, the French conglomerate reached a market capitalization of $434 billion (€400 billion) for the first time in history.

Bernard Arnault’s behemoth, which has brands such as Tiffany & Co., Christian Dior, Louis Vuitton and Givenchy in its 75-strong portfolio, became Europe’s most valuable company back in March 2021 and has now further strengthened that position. In fact, it now ranks as the 14th most valuable company in the world. Apple sits on top of that list, with a market cap of just over $2.1 trillion.

For comparison’s sake, LVMH’s chief rival, Kering, which helms the likes of Gucci, Saint Laurent and Balenciaga, currently has a market cap of $69 billion. The group’s two other main competitors, Richemont and Hermès, have market caps of $84 billion and $175 billion, respectively.

LVMH reported robust sales in Europe, the US and Japan last year due to the ongoing demand of loyal clients and the recovery of international travel. The group has also benefited from the reopening of China this year; the region makes up 21 percent of the world’s $372 billion luxury goods market.

At the same time, LVMH chairman and CEO Bernard Arnault has been reshuffling the C-suite within the various houses and tightening his family’s grip on the luxury empire. He recently named his daughter, Delphine, chairman and CEO of Christian Dior and appointed his son Antoine to run the holding company that controls LVMH and the $178 billion Arnault fortune.

No doubt the entire clan is happy about the booming share prices."

On Thursday, LVMH reported record annual earnings, despite a deceleration of growth in the fourth quarter that LVMH CFO Jean Jacques Guiony attributed to a “soft patch” in China. The world's largest luxury conglomerate reported €79 billion in annual turnover, a 17 per cent increase compared to 2021 when annual sales were €64 billion. Sales in the fourth quarter grew 9 per cent on an organic basis to around €22.7 billion, beating consensus expectations of 6.2 per cent. Asia was down 8 per cent, United States up 9 per cent, Europe up 28 per cent and Japan up 29 per cent. This represents a deceleration for all regions compared to the third quarter.

In the fourth quarter, the fashion and leather goods division grew 10 per cent to €10 billion on an organic basis, led by Louis Vuitton, Dior and Celine. LVMH typically doesn’t break down revenue per brand, but Bernard Arnault, chairman and CEO of LVMH, said that Louis Vuitton surpassed €20 billion in annual sales and Celine sales were above €2 billion, confirming analyst estimates.

“For 2023, I am quite confident. If the early part of the year is confirmed, if the opening of China is confirmed, it’s a bit short but the start is extremely strong. We’ll see, we can’t guarantee that it’s going to continue like that, we can't guarantee that something might not happen. We hadn’t expected the Ukraine issue two years ago. But if it continues as it is, it will be an excellent year. We'll be able to continue to develop our investments and gain market shares,” said Arnault in the auditorium of the LVMH headquarters located on 22 avenue Montaigne."

LVMH’s Bernard Arnault, the world’s richest man, names his daughter CEO of Dior

As the old adage goes – it’s not what you know, but who you know.

Of late, the internet has been asking itself some pretty searching questions regarding “ Nepo Babies ” (short for nepotism baby) – a term that has become popular after New York Magazine used it in a list of people in Hollywood. It refers to those whose careers have benefitted in no small way from family connections and have bagged high-ranking jobs because of them.

The latest figure to shine in a long list of nepo babies is Delphine Arnault, the daughter of Bernard Arnault - the 73-year-old CEO and chair of the €382 billion French luxury fashion and goods giant LVMH, Europe's most valuable company.

Delphine, 47, the eldest of Arnault’s five children, has been tapped to run LVMH’s second-biggest brand, Christian Dior, amid a top management reshuffle, a move that sees Arnault tightening his family's grip on the empire he co-founded 35 years ago.

The decision has stirred further questions about succession.

Bernard Arnault has not publicly named his successor, and many saw Delphine’s brother Antoine, 45, as the frontrunner - especially after his appointment last month as vice chairman of its board of directors, charged with running the holding company that controls LVMH.

Now, Delphine’s new role is seen by the fashion industry as starting an all-out succession battle between her and Antoine.

Not that this is new: analysts have frequently compared the competition between the Arnault children to that of the Roys in the hit TV show Succession.

And for good reason: all five of Bernard Arnault's children hold senior positions in LVMH and its brands (Stella McCartney, TAG Heuer, Bulgari and Tiffany).

Alexandre Arnault, 30, is an executive vice president at Tiffany & Co.; Frédéric Arnault, 28, serves as the CEO of Tag Heuer; and the youngest of the five siblings, Jean Arnault, 24, is the director of watches development and marketing at Louis Vuitton.

But Delphine Arnault has risen higher in the family business than her siblings.

She joined Christian Dior in 2001 and became an executive vice president at Louis Vuitton in 2013, in charge of supervising all of the brand’s product-related activities.

The businesswoman is also a member of the board of directors for Moët Hennessy, Pucci (since 2007), M6 (2009), Céline (since 2011), 21st Century Fox and Havas (both since 2013), amongst others.

In her new role at Dior, she’ll work closely with Charles Delapalme, who now becomes managing director at the brand.

As part of the reshuffle, Arnaud has also promoted now-former Dior CEO Pietro Beccari, who has been the head of Dior since 2018.

Beccari is moving to replace long-time Louis Vuitton CEO Michael Burke, who is Arnault's longest-serving lieutenant and has also been chairman of jewellery label Tiffany. According to a company statement, he will continue to work alongside Bernard Arnault – although no information is currently available regarding his new role.

The announced changes come into effect in February.

The group reported a net profit of €6.5 billion in the first half of 2022, a 23-percent jump from record earnings in the same period the previous year. Sales rose 28 percent to €36.7 billion and shares in LVMH rose as much as 2% to hit new highs, as luxury companies have been boosted recently by the easing of COVID-19 restrictions in the key market: China.

As an added bonus, Arnault recently overtook Elon Musk as the world's richest person, with an estimated net worth of around €149 billion.

There are also no signs indicating that he plans to step back anytime soon.

Luxury retailer LVMH is optimistic as it sees Chinese shoppers and tourists returning - CNBC,"Thu, 26 Jan 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tLzIwMjMvMDEvMjYvbHZtaC1zZWVzLWNoaW5lc2UtbHV4dXJ5LXNob3BwZXJzLXJldHVybmluZy1ib29zdGluZy0yMDIzLXNhbGVzLmh0bWzSAWhodHRwczovL3d3dy5jbmJjLmNvbS9hbXAvMjAyMy8wMS8yNi9sdm1oLXNlZXMtY2hpbmVzZS1sdXh1cnktc2hvcHBlcnMtcmV0dXJuaW5nLWJvb3N0aW5nLTIwMjMtc2FsZXMuaHRtbA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Bernard Arnault, Chairman and CEO of LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton, attends a news conference to present the 2022 annual results of LVMH in Paris, France, January 26, 2023.

Luxury giant LVMH said China's wealthy consumers have started returning to stores after the country's reopening and it remains optimistic about the year ahead.

""We have every reason to be confident, indeed optimistic on China,"" LVMH CEO Bernard Arnault said during the company's earnings presentation. ""In Macao, where the Chinese can now travel, the change is quite spectacular. The stores are full and it's really come back very strong.""

Arnault added that if the ""green shoots"" the company sees in China continue to grow, ""it will be an excellent year.""

LVMH reported its second straight year of record sales and profits, with 2022 revenue up 23% to 79.2 billion euros, or about $86.2 billion. Profits grew 17% to 14 billion euros, or about $15.2 billion.

The return of the Chinese luxury consumer is the key question for the global luxury industry in 2023, as the U.S. and European economies slow. Shares of LVMH, Richemont, Kering and other big luxury names have soared this month on hopes for a rapid bounce back in China's luxury spending, which accounted for a third of all luxury sales before the pandemic shifted consumer spending habits.

LVMH Chief Financial Officer Jean-Jacques Guiony cautioned that while the rebound has been strong in January, ""we're not back to the levels of 2019. We're a long way from that.""

Yet LVMH's cautious optimism echoes positive comments earlier this month from Burberry and Swatch.

Burberry cited ""very promising signs in China"" after a difficult December, while Swatch said its ""sales growth in January in China reinforces the Group's expectation to aim for a record year in 2023.""

Some analysts say China's reopening could mark a ""big bang"" moment for luxury — driving sales in the country as well as in Europe, as Chinese tourists return to Paris, Milan and London this summer and shop for luxury goods.

""If they resume travel and they head for the countries that attract them, they will probably come to France, and we are ready to receive them,"" Arnault said.

Bain & Co estimates that global luxury sales grew 22% in 2022, to over $380 billion, with the U.S. replacing China as the top market. Even if China rebounds, growth in luxury sales is likely to be slower this year. Bain estimates global sales could grow between 3% and 8% in 2023, depending on China's reopening and the U.S.

There are already signs that the U.S. market is slowing. LVMH said revenue grew 7% in the U.S. during the fourth quarter, a sharp deceleration from growth of 26% and 22% in the first two quarters of the year.

Guiony, however, said the declines are largely due to favorable comparisons in the first two quarters and the surge in Americans taking advantage of a strong dollar to buy luxury goods in Europe over the summer. He said sales at Sephora — the beauty retailer owned by LVMH — showed no signs of consumer weakness in the U.S. and had ""high growth in the fourth quarter.""

""We're not concerned,"" Guiony said."
LVMH Tops $430B Market Cap - PYMNTS.com,"Tue, 17 Jan 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnB5bW50cy5jb20vbmV3cy9yZXRhaWwvMjAyMy9sdm1oLXRvcHMtNDMwYi1tYXJrZXQtY2FwL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LVMH’s share price rose to over 800 euros on Tuesday (Jan. 17).

The fashion and luxury goods group, which is listed on the Euronext Paris exchange, briefly traded at over 800 euros (roughly $863) a share, boosting the company’s market capitalization to 400 billion euros ($431.5 billion) for the first time, Reuters reported.

The new record cements LVMH’s position as Europe’s most valuable business and will likely give Bernard Arnault, the firm’s CEO and a significant shareholder in LVMH, an even greater lead as the world’s richest person.

Following Elon Musk’s record-breaking loss of net worth, which has tumbled with the market price of Tesla, Arnault has held the title thanks to his luxury fashion empire that includes LVMH shares and a majority stake in Christian Dior.

As PYMNTS reported in April, luxury retailers proved remarkably resilient in 2022, even as other retail categories suffered declining fortunes. As reflected in Tuesday’s strong stock market performance, a stream of robust sales results has seen the likes of LVMH and Hermes report increasing earnings despite a wider economic slowdown.

LVMH’s latest milestone could well reflect investors’ anticipation of a wave of luxury spending as wealthy Chinese shoppers make their return to international shopping destinations after months of intense domestic lockdowns.

A surge in post-lockdown travel is already showing up in data from Trip.com, which said at the end of last year that outbound bookings from China hit levels not seen since before the pandemic.

On Dec 27, when Chinese authorities announced the decision to reopen the country’s borders, Trip.com reported a 254% increase in mainland China’s outbound flight bookings compared to the previous day.

Flights to Singapore, South Korea, Hong Kong, Japan and Thailand seem to have fueled the travel boom, making them the top five tourist destinations, with bookings for long-haul flights to the U.K, the U.S. and Australia also surging.

While luxury brands like LVMH will certainly enjoy the release of pent-up Chinese spending power for the moment, in the long run, further gains may be harder to achieve. Whether the luxury market can maintain its strong performance is yet to be seen.

LVMH posts record year for revenue and profits; DFS spurred by Macau rebound - The Moodie Davitt Report,"Thu, 26 Jan 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vbW9vZGllZGF2aXR0cmVwb3J0LmNvbS9sdm1oLXBvc3RzLXJlY29yZC15ZWFyLWZvci1yZXZlbnVlLWFuZC1wcm9maXRzLWRmcy1zcHVycmVkLWJ5LW1hY2F1LXJlYm91bmQv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"INTERNATIONAL. Leading luxury goods group LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, recorded revenue of €79.2 billion in 2022 and profit from recurring operations of €21.1 billion, both up +23% year-on-year.

All business groups achieved significant organic revenue growth over the year with Fashion & Leather Goods reaching record levels, with organic revenue growth of +20%. Profit from recurring operations stood at €21.1 billion for 2022, also up +23%. Operating margin remained at the same level as 2021.

Group share of net profit was €14.1 billion, up +17% compared to 2021. Operating free cash flow surpassed €10 billion.

By region, Europe, the USA and Japan rose sharply, benefiting from strong demand from local customers and the recovery of international travel. Asia sales were stable through the year.

By division, Selective Retailing revenue climbed +26% year-on-year in 2022 (+17% on an organic basis). Profit from recurring operations rose +48%.

Within this, DFS Group (owned by LVMH and DFS co-founder Robert Miller) remained affected by the COVID situation in China. LVMH said: “The flagship destinations of Hong Kong and Macau particularly suffered as a result of the suspension of domestic travel and the complete absence of tourists but just reopened in January.”

Commenting on DFS Group’s performance in a post-results call, LVMH Chairman & Chief Executive Officer Bernard Arnault said: “DFS is slightly more challenging. Airports have been deserted up till now so of course it’s difficult to remain out in front… but there are green shoots in China. Macau has started again… in our stores in Macau business is back and the Chinese are buying.”

LVMH Chief Financial Officer Jean-Jacques Guiony added, “DFS had two very different half years. H1 was not outstanding but it was alright. But H2 was a challenging half year because, of course, the local circumstances and the fact that Macau was locked down starting in July – no Chinese visitors and so no sales in Macau from July to December. And as Mr. Arnault pointed out, now things are back in business. Macau is one of the few places where the COVID test is not compulsory for Chinese nationals. But H2 was challenging compared to 2021 where Macau was open.”

The Wines & Spirits business group recorded revenue growth of +19% (+11% on an organic basis) while profit from recurring operations rose +16%. Champagne volumes climbed +6%, driven by sustained demand leading to growing pressure on supplies. Momentum was particularly strong in Europe, Japan and in emerging markets, particularly in “high energy” channels and gastronomy.

Hennessy Cognac benefited from further “value creation” with price increases “offsetting the effects of the health situation in China, while the United States was affected at the start of the year by logistical disruptions”. Still wines, in particular the Château d’Esclans rosé, achieved an “excellent performance”.

The Fashion & Leather Goods business group posted revenue growth of +25% year-on-year (+20% organic). Profit from recurring operations increased by +22%. Louis Vuitton had an “excellent year”, with many new products unveiled in leathergoods, jewellery and watches.

LVMH added: “Christian Dior continued its remarkable growth trajectory across all its product lines. After three years of renovations, the Maison’s historic store at 30 avenue Montaigne, which reopened in Paris in early 2022, enjoyed huge success, offering a new experience of the highest refinement.”

Celine experienced strong growth aided by Hedi Slimane’s creations, as did Loewe, driven by the creativity of J.W. Anderson. Fendi celebrated the 25th anniversary of its Baguette bag while Loro Piana, Rimowa and Marc Jacobs also performed well.

The Perfumes & Cosmetics business group recorded revenue growth of +17% (+10% organic). Profit from recurring operations was slightly down as a result of a selective policy of distribution.

Christian Dior enjoyed “a remarkable performance”, said LVMH, with Sauvage, Miss Dior and J’Adore boosting growth. Dior Addict in make-up and Prestige in skincare also contributed.

Guerlain sustained its growth, driven by the vitality of its Abeille Royale skincare, Aqua Allegoria collection and perfumes range L’Art et la Matière. The group also highlighted the performance of Parfums Givenchy and said that Fenty Beauty doubled its revenue thanks to the expansion of its distribution network and new launches.

The Watches & Jewelry business group posted revenue growth of +18% (+12% organic). Profit from recurring operations climbed by +20%. Tiffany & Co. had a record year, with revenue from its High Jewelry range doubling. Bvlgari showed strong momentum, particularly in Europe, Japan and the USA.

Product innovation and high-profile campaigns boosted the performance of Chaumet and Fred in jewellery and TAG Heuer, Zenith and Hublot in watches.

Arnault said: “Our performance in 2022 illustrates the exceptional appeal of our Maisons and their ability to create desire during a year affected by economic and geopolitical challenges. The group once again recorded significant growth in revenue and earnings.

“Our growth strategy, based on the complementary nature of our activities, as well as their geographic diversity, encourages innovation and the quality of our creations, the excellence of their distribution, and adds a cultural and historical dimension thanks to the heritage of our Maisons.

“This was showcased during our hugely successful LVMH Journées Particulières, when we opened our doors to all in fifteen countries in 2022 and saw a record number of visitors come to learn about the know-how of our artisans. We approach 2023 with confidence but remain vigilant due to current uncertainties. We count on the desirability of our Maisons and the agility of our teams to further strengthen our lead in the global luxury market and support France’s prestige throughout the world.”"

The company's selective retailing business group saw revenue increase 26% to £13 billion (€14.8 billion), driven by a ""remarkable rebound"" from Sephora. This follows the relaunch of Sephora in the UK in October 2022.

Momentum at Sephora was ""particularly strong"" in North America, Europe, the Middle East and in most Southeast Asian countries. During the period, investments were made into the beauty retailer's omnichannel strategy to improve its customers’ purchasing experience both online and in-store.

The perfume and cosmetics business group saw revenues rise 17% to £6.7 billion (€7.7 billion), driven by ""strong"" growth in perfumes. This growth was also attributed to Christian Dior, Guerlain, Givenchy and Fenty Beauty.

Christian Dior boasted a ""remarkable performance"", driven by its Sauvage, Miss Dior and J’adore fragrances. Dior Addict in makeup and Prestige in skincare also contributed to the Maison's growth.

The fashion and leather goods business group saw revenues increase 25% to £33.9 billion (€38.6 billion), with Louis Vuitton revenue surpassing £17.5 billion (€20 billion) for the first time. Growth was also driven by Christian Dior, Celine, Fendi, Loewe and Marc Jacobs.

The watches and jewellery business group recorded revenue growth of 18% to £9.2 billion (€10.5 billion), with ""sustained creative momentum"" from Tiffany & Co, Bulgari and TAG Heuer.

Total revenue in Europe, the US and Japan ""rose sharply"", benefiting from demand from local customers and the recovery of international travel. The Asian market remained “stable” over the year, due to the resurgence of COVID-19 in China.

Profit from recurring operations increased 23% to £18.5 billion (€21.1 billion).

The namesake agency Marquis has partnered with LVMH to consult for brands across the group, as well as taking on external clients, working on celebrity marketing, image and strategic communications.

Working closely with stylists, agents and talent, Marquis has played a key role connecting LVMH with pop singers, influencers and Hollywood stars as celebrity marketing gained importance in the fashion industry.

During 12 years at Givenchy alongside designers Riccardo Tisci and then Clare Waight Keller, Marquis helped the couture house to renew its cultural relevance by dressing stars like Beyoncé, Madonna and Kim Kardashian (becoming the first European luxury brand to embrace the American reality-TV star). The executive remains close with both Tisci and Kardashian.

In 2018, Marquis helped Givenchy score one of the biggest celebrity placements in recent memory: designing the dress for actress Meghan Markle’s wedding to Prince Harry.

As fashion communications director at Louis Vuitton since last year, Marquis has assisted the brand in cutting deals with a fresh crop of A-list ambassadors including Cate Blanchett for jewellery and Bradley Cooper for watches. He also helped the brand to secure talent for a recent campaign featuring rival football superstars Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo, timed to coincide with the FIFA World Cup.

The Arnault family is banking on K-Pop stars to boost the LVMH empire - Business Insider,"Mon, 30 Jan 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vYXJuYXVsdC1mYW1pbHktbHZtaC1rLXBvcC1zdGFycy1ib29zdC1lbXBpcmUtcGFydG5lcnNoaXBzLTIwMjMtMdIBZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vYXJuYXVsdC1mYW1pbHktbHZtaC1rLXBvcC1zdGFycy1ib29zdC1lbXBpcmUtcGFydG5lcnNoaXBzLTIwMjMtMT9hbXA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The Arnault family is betting big on K-Pop stars.

In January, Delphine Arnault's Dior signed BTS star Jimin as the brand's global ambassador.

Experts tell Insider this is a calculated move to tap into the booming South Korean market.

On January 11, Delphine Arnault was nominated by her father, luxury magnate Bernard Arnault, to helm Dior. Within days, the fashion house appointed Jimin, one of the seven members of the K-Pop supergroup BTS, as the brand's global ambassador.

The singer's agency, HYBE, directed Insider to a statement from Dior that said Jimin ""embodies the spirit and singularity of Dior style.""

Delphine Arnault's move comes over a year after her younger brother Alexandre Arnault, an executive vice president at Tiffany & Co., signed BLACKPINK singer Rosé to represent the jewelry house. Rosé now advertises Tiffany's ""Hardwear"" line, a collection of necklaces and bracelets.

And in June, Celine — another brand under the massive umbrella of Arnault's LVMH — invited BTS member V, BLACKPINK member Lisa, and South Korean actor Park Bo-gum to the brand's Spring/Summer 2023 show in Paris. Lisa also worked with LVMH brand Bulgari, wearing one of their watches in a 2021 campaign.

All of which points at the undeniable: The world's biggest luxury conglomerate is officially betting big on K-Pop.

South Korean idols are no strangers to luxury brands

South Korean celebrities wearing luxury goods are a common sight. There are even Twitter accounts dedicated to documenting every branded item they wear. BTS has repped outfits from LVMH brands at star-studded events: all seven members turned up for the Grammys in Las Vegas in 2022 wearing head-to-toe Louis Vuitton.

It's not only LVMH: In January, BTS rapper SUGA became a brand ambassador for Valentino, per WWD.

And long before BTS, G-Dragon — the leader of BIGBANG, a K-Pop band that dominated South Korea's pop scene in the 2000s — was one of Chanel's biggest representatives in Asia. The rapper forged a friendship with the late Karl Lagerfeld, and in 2015 walked in Chanel's haute couture show in Paris.

However, the Arnault family in particular appears to be moving aggressively into the South Korean market.

The reason might lie in the math. Beyond the fact that K-Pop stars come with legions of fans of their own, South Koreans are now the world's biggest luxury consumers, CNBC reported, citing figures from Morgan Stanley. The estimated total value of South Korea's spending on personal luxury goods in 2022 went up by 24% year-on-year. And the average South Korean person spent at least $325 on luxury items in 2022 — far exceeding the $55 per capita spending in China, and the $280 per capita expenses in the US, per Morgan Stanley.

Soo Kim, a business professor at Singapore's Nanyang Business School, told Insider South Korea's competitive environment and the seemingly insurmountable wealth gap are driving the luxury-spending machine in the country. South Koreans collectively ran up a staggering amount of debt in 2021 that exceeded the country's GDP by 5%, but they continue to spend big on luxury goods.

The spending won't stop because branded items help compensate for ""constant threats"" to the average South Korean consumer's ""ego,"" Kim added. Luxury items also provide a ""psychological release"" — giving South Korean consumers control over their physical appearance, she told Insider.

""Furthermore, Koreans take great pride in their own citizens excelling in the global arena. Seeing their stars represent these luxury houses would positively impact Koreans' perception of these brands,"" Kim said.

Experts say there's another big reason LVMH is looking at South Korea: It's the gateway to Asia.

""If you have South Korea, you have the northeastern Asian market,"" Jacob Cooke, the chief executive officer of WPIC, a Beijing-based e-commerce consulting firm, told WWD in January.

There's also South Korea's cultural clout, David Dubois, a professor of marketing at INSEAD, told Insider.

""Fashion trends tend to be created and adopted in South Korea, before being diffused to other markets in Asia,"" Dubois said. He added that LVMH's K-Pop promotions are a ""continuation"" of a long-term strategy to ""establish long-lasting footprints"" in the South Korean market.

And China, for various reasons, might also not be the prime market for LVMH's products right now.

""With the COVID lockdowns and the recent sentiment against wealth inequality and the overt display of wealth in China, the relationship between luxury houses and the Chinese market is murkier,"" Kim, the Nanyang Business School professor, told Insider.

Kim said it ""makes sense"" for LVMH to re-distribute resources to places like Japan and Korea. She also said South Korea is ""increasingly known"" for its K-Pop stars, movies, and shows in the US — which helps with promotions stateside too.

""I'm sure also it doesn't hurt that Korea receives a great number of Chinese tourists. Once the COVID situation settles, it is possible that Chinese tourists, with their spending power, return to Korea,"" Kim said. ""The investment in Korea could also serve as an indirect way to target Chinese consumers.""

Representatives at LVMH did not immediately respond to Insider's request for comment."

Christian Dior Couture’s chief executive Pietro Beccari is set to succeed Michael Burke as CEO of Louis Vuitton, the luxury industry’s largest brand, LVMH said in a statement Wednesday.

Delphine Arnault, LVMH chairman Bernard Arnault’s eldest child and Vuitton’s executive vice president for product for since 2013, will replace Beccari as Dior’s president and CEO. It’s the biggest role yet to be held by a member of the family’s next generation even as all 5 of Bernard Arnault’s children have taken up key roles in the group.

LVMH insiders have long seen Beccari as a potential successor to Burke, aged 65, who has led Louis Vuitton since 2012. The Italian executive rose to prominence in the luxury conglomerate leading Vuitton’s marketing efforts from 2006 to 2012 before taking star turns as CEO of its Fendi and Dior brands.

Since Beccari joined Dior in 2018, the brand’s sales have roughly quadrupled to nearly €9 billion in 2022, according to HSBC estimates. Beccari “accelerated the appeal and success” of Dior, Arnault said in a statement. “Monsieur Dior’s values of elegance and his innovative spirit have been given fresh intensity.”

“Under [Delphine’s] leadership, the desirability of Louis Vuitton products advanced significantly, enabling the brand to regularly set new sales records,” Arnault added.

The executive moves come amid a broader changing of the guard at LVMH, as chairman Bernard Arnault’s children ascend to new roles within the company and as stalwarts of the group’s tight circle of trusted managers approach retirement. In December it was announced that Arnault’s second child, Antoine, would replace veteran executive Sidney Toledano as CEO of the financial holding company through which the family owns its controlling stake in LVMH.

The changes “underline the bench strength and long-term custodian approach at LVMH,” RBC Capital Markets analyst Piral Dadhania said.

Vuitton Bigger Than Ever

Sales at Vuitton have expanded rapidly under Burke, one of Arnault’s most trusted lieutenants, and daughter Delphine Arnault. Working with designers including Nicolas Ghesquière, Kim Jones and Virgil Abloh, Burke and Arnault energised its image and elevated its product offer, reducing a dependence on monogrammed canvas by boosting sales of more sophisticated leather bags like the Capucine and Twist styles.

In 2018, Vuitton became the first luxury fashion brand to surpass €10 billion in annual sales. Since the coronavirus pandemic, revenues have accelerated sharply, reaching an estimated €20.6 billion last year, according to HSBC.

In recent months, the brand has flexed its newfound scale with bigger-than-ever marketing coups: it recently recruited rival football superstars Messi and Ronaldo to appear together in a World Cup campaign, and staged massive installations at flagship stores around the world to celebrate its collaboration with Japanese artist Yayoi Kusama.

That’s not to mention the house’s multidisciplinary tributes to late menswear designer Abloh, which have featured performances by dance troupes, marching bands, chamber orchestras and rap stars Tyler the Creator and Kendrick Lamar.

Burke has “extended Louis Vuitton’s lead over competitors and promoted the heritage of Louis Vuitton while anchoring it in modernity,” Bernard Arnault said in a statement. “The cultural strength of Louis Vuitton has been fully affirmed.”

The pending management shakeup could be one reason the brand has been slow to name a replacement for Abloh, who died suddenly in 2021.

Burke will continue to work for LVMH as an advisor to Arnault, the group’s statement said.

From Vuitton to Fendi to Dior and Back

After leading marketing at Vuitton, Beccari took the reins at Fendi, where he elevated perception of the Roman fur and leather house while retooling its marketing and product offer to appeal to younger consumers. His 2018 move to Dior was part of one of the biggest executive shuffles in the history of LVMH.

As CEO, Beccari worked with designers Maria Grazia Chiuri and Kim Jones to create a more consistent, wearable and youthful Dior, with deft merchandising that saw the business grow to previously unimagined heights. Hit products like the Book tote, Bobby camera bag and relaunched Saddle helped Dior reduced its dependence on the flagship Lady Dior bag. During his tenure, the brand also worked to rebalance geographies, reactivating regions like the US and Europe where its market share had previously slipped while pursuing rapid growth in China.

The executive has a particular flair for creating immersive brand hubs that combine fashion, food, hospitality, art installations and craftsmanship demonstrations, as well as staging memorable marketing spectacles, such as Fendi’s 2016 “haute fourrure” show at the Trevi fountain (where models appeared to walk on water) or Dior’s 2021 recreation of an iconic photoshoot at the Acropolis in Athens.

More Key Appointments

Delphine is the only one of Bernard Arnault’s children to have served on LVMH’s executive committee. In addition to her role at Vuitton, she spearheaded and oversees the LVMH Prize, the group’s fund for young designers.

The group is bringing in top talent to support the executive, aged 47, as she takes on her first CEO role at a much larger Dior than when she started her career in the group at the brand from 2001 to 2013. The group named Charles Delapalme — a seasoned merchant who has led commercial teams at Louis Vuitton, Fendi and Dior — as Dior’s managing director.

“We believe Dior will remain one of the fastest growing brands in the LVMH portfolio in the next 4 to 5 years,” RBC Capital Markets’ Dadhania said, estimating the brand could reach €10 billion in annual sales by 2025.

The group also said it would integrate oversight of its recent Tiffany & Co. acquisition with its broader Watch and Jewellery Division, led by Stéphane Bianchi. Previously, Burke had served as the brand’s non-executive chairman in addition to his role at Louis Vuitton.

LVMH's 'wolf in cashmere' installs daughter as Dior head amid raging succession battle - Fortune,"Wed, 11 Jan 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMingFodHRwczovL2ZvcnR1bmUuY29tL2V1cm9wZS8yMDIzLzAxLzExL2x2bWgtYmVybmFyZC1hcm5hdWx0LXJpY2hlc3QtYmlsbGlvbmFpcmUtd29sZi1pbi1jYXNobWVyZS1kYXVnaHRlci1kZWxwaGluZS1jZW8tY2hyaXN0aWFuLWRpb3ItcmFnaW5nLXN1Y2Nlc3Npb24tYmF0dGxlL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Luxury kingpin Bernard Arnault installed his only daughter as head of the Dior fashion house in a management reshuffle at LVMH.

The 73 year-old “wolf in cashmere,” who recently overtook Tesla’s Elon Musk to become the world’s richest human, is expected to pass leadership of his company on to his children in the next few years.

That succession battle may very well be decided after he appointed on Wednesday Delphine Arnault to succeed Pietro Beccari as chair and CEO of the brand Christian Dior Couture effective February 1.

“Her keen insights and incomparable experience will be decisive assets in driving the ongoing development of Christian Dior,” the LVMH boss said in a statement.

The oldest of his five children at 47, Delphine is the only one to serve both on the board of directors and the executive committee of LVMH. Currently she serves as executive vice president of Louis Vuitton and supervises all product-related activities at the LVMH luxury marque.

Dior is believed to hold a special place in the empire cobbled together by Arnault that spans some 75 brands. It became the cornerstone of his vast wealth when he acquired it in 1984—after the idea was unintentionally planted by a Francophile cab driver in New York.

“He could not name the [French] president but he knew Dior,” Arnault often recalls.

Shares in LVMH, Europe’s most valuable company with a $420 billion market cap, traded 2.5% higher on Wednesday, outpacing moderate gains in France’s broader CAC40 blue chip index.

With its €64 billion ($69 billion) in annual revenue, LVMH is a loosely managed holding company: Fashion houses like Bulgari, Tiffany, and Tag Heuer are the real stars.

‘Don’t worry about profitability’

The number one job of their creative directors isn’t to study troves of marketing data about what needs and wants customers may have and then deliver on that. Rather, the designers are supposed to give their minds free rein in order to create a product people will innately desire no matter the price.

Management then is tasked with laying out a manufacturing process regardless of the materials used, netting the group a staggering 27% operating margin in 2021, the last full year of published results.

Some products flop, but enough succeed, and in the end the brand continuously reinvents itself. If this means his family as 48% controlling shareholders in LVMH are disappointed by the occasional poor quarter, then so be it.

“Money is just a consequence. I always say to my team, don’t worry too much about profitability,” Bernard Arnault told Forbes in 2017. “My real concern is what the brand will be in five or 10 years, not the profitability in the next six months.”

Instead of maximizing short-term results, the French luxury goods patriarch says, he runs his business based around three main pillars: creativity, quality, and entrepreneurship.

While he shares Elon Musk’s emphasis on long-term planning as the bedrock for success, he does not share the Tesla CEO’s professed love of the office. Even before the pandemic made it popular, the French mogul took a dim view of busy cubicle work as a measure of productivity.

“Don’t go to the offices too much. Stay on the ground with the customer or with the designers as they work,” he told the U.S. publication at the time. “I visit stores every week. I always look for the store managers. I want to see them on the ground, not in their offices doing paperwork.”

Delphine Arnault will no doubt have already internalized this message when she steps through the doors of Dior next month."

The luxury titan reported double-digit revenue growth in the fourth quarter and its full year, with each of its business categories also up double digits for the year.



Here are five important takeaways from the company’s most recent earnings report.



LVMH shined in spite of economic and geopolitical struggles.

Bernard Arnault slams duty free daigou trade and expresses optimism in Chinese travelling shopper rebound - The Moodie Davitt Report,"Fri, 27 Jan 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiQFodHRwczovL21vb2RpZWRhdml0dHJlcG9ydC5jb20vYmVybmFyZC1hcm5hdWx0LXNsYW1zLWR1dHktZnJlZS1kYWlnb3UtdHJhZGUtYW5kLWV4cHJlc3Nlcy1vcHRpbWlzbS1pbi1jaGluZXNlLXRyYXZlbGxpbmctc2hvcHBlci1yZWJvdW5kL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"FRANCE. LVMH Chairman & CEO Bernard Arnault has underlined his determination to maintain the allure of the house’s luxury and beauty lines by rejecting the daigou sector that has seen huge volumes of product – mostly from duty free – pouring into the China local market in recent years*.

Speaking at a post-results call yesterday after LVMH posted strong full-year 2022 results, Arnault said: “We’re refusing and we’re fighting against so-called parallel exports. A number of our peers need to generate revenue and don’t hesitate to sell through resellers who buy products abroad and then sell them on at discounted prices in China. But we avoid that.

“Absolutely ditto for cosmetics and the sale of products that we see offered by a certain competitor,” he added. In a clear reference to the South Korean duty free market which has been almost solely reliant on the daigou business into China during the pandemic, Arnault commented: “I mean it’s quite fascinating to see the duty free stores where there’s nobody – because their airports were empty – [and they] were generating huge sales, huge revenues.

“Why? Because the products never arrived on the stand. They went straight from the inventory – the reserve of the seller – to the professional seller who sold them on a discount in China. I mean, for your image, there is nothing worse. It’s dreadful.”

LVMH Chief Financial Officer Jean-Jacques Guiony also referred to the daigou market when assessing the performance of the Perfumes and Cosmetics division. “It’s a more challenging situation because we deliberately decided to contain or indeed delete all parallel channels in travel retail around the world, so as to preserve the brand capital.

“This is a costly decision. This is offset by local, dynamic local markets in Europe and the US but overall this drove down profitability. Even though it comes at a cost, it was the right decision over time that will keep our brands attractive.”

{Note: In the interests of balance, while the Korean daigou sector has been the most visible, several other leading travel retailers, including at one stage DFS, generated significant similar business at varying periods of the pandemic -Ed}

Arnault made his remarks while expanding on Guiony’s comments on the likely future balance of Chinese consumption now that outbound travel is restarting.

“Regarding the breakdown between tourists buying and local domestic buying, it’s difficult to work out exactly,” Guiony said. “But in absolute numbers… it used to be that tourists represented a certain share of business abroad. It will take a long time to get back to the levels of before. Now 90% of the demand is in China itself.

“So now part of that demand will move out offshore when the markets reopen, but it will be a long time before the percentages change. And also, the Chinese market is bigger now than in 2019. There are more customers now than there were in 2019. All the numbers are up. So, for the proportions to change significantly amd to have much more {busiiness} offshore proportionally will take a while.”

Commenting on DFS Group’s performance, Arnault said: “DFS is slightly more challenging [than the rest of Selective Retailing]. Airports have been deserted up till now so of course it’s difficult to remain out in front… but there are green shoots in China. Macau has started again… in our stores in Macau business is back and the Chinese are buying.”

Later Arnault added: “We have every reason to be confident – indeed optimistic – on the Chinese market. In Macau, where [Mainland] Chinese can now travel to, the change is quite spectacular. The stores are full. It’s really come back at a very strong pace.”

Guiony commented, “DFS had two very different half years. H1 was not outstanding but it was alright. But H2 was a challenging half year because of the local circumstances and the fact that Macau was locked down starting in July – no Chinese visitors and so no sales in Macau from July to December.

“As Mr. Arnault pointed out, now things are back in business. Macau is one of the few places where the COVID test is not compulsory for Chinese nationals. But H2 was challenging compared to 2021 where Macau was open.”

*Look out for Martin Moodie’s forthcoming feature on the current challenges to the daigou market in South Korean duty free.

Soundbites: Bernard Arnault on the record

On trading through the crisis: “In difficult times in terms of the macro economy and of political difficulties, LVMH is gaining market share and making progress and this has been the case since 2019.”

On the keys to sustained success: “It’s creativity that enhances the brands’ desirability. And that’s what guides our teams above all. It’s the desirability, be it for our fashion & leathergoods activities or for all the other activities of the group.”

On Louis Vuitton: “We never give the figures of Louis Vuitton but … it’s a major milestone this time so we give it. We said this when we crossed the €10 billion mark [and now] Louis Vuitton has exceeded €20 billion in terms of revenue.”

On Tiffany: “Tiffany for the first time will exceed the €1 billion in profit from recurring operations. We were barely at half that when we acquired the business. Everyone said to me, ‘Why are you buying this business at that price? It’s far too much.’ Well, if the business were to be listed today… it would probably be worth twice as much.”

On Bvlgari: “The high point of this year for Bvlgari will be the opening of the flagship on 5th Avenue on the corner of 57th. But as we’re already doing over €200 million in the provisional store I think we’re going to double or even more the annual sales in this new store, which will be wonderful.”

On LVMH’s national contribution: “This magnificent group that has spectacular results is also a group that has a great economic and social footprint for France. In 2022, we recruited worldwide close to 40,000 young people. In France alone, we recruited over 15,000 people, making the group the leading recruiter in France in 2022. LVMH invested over €200 million for the training of its employees. In France, a job created by LVMH generates four with our partners or suppliers.”

On 2023: “If it continues as it is, it’ll be an excellent year. We’ll be able to continue to develop our investments, gain market share, because even when the situation is somewhat more challenging, [and something] is going to happen from one month to the next, we continue to invest.

“Whereas some of our peers may have tighter financial constraints, they stop investing or they invest less. And so, things are more difficult afterwards. We continue to invest and… it’s been quite successful for us during the difficult times when we weathered the health crisis.”

On leadership changes at Louis Vuitton and Dior: “In a large company, as in any human organisation, one needs to evolve. It’s not a good thing to keep a form of organisation that leads to a routine mindset.

“The executives… must use their management skills by changing. Mustn’t get used to things. But of course, we also need duration. I mean, it’s not like in a government which changes every two years or even more.”

On an online challenge to Sephora: “Someone said to me five years ago, ‘Be careful, be very prudent, Sephora in the US is under threat from Amazon.’ That’s what we were told. But it [Sephora] has never worked so well. I think that there’s a return to physical stores and the experience in a physical store will always be extraordinary as compared to an online purchase.”

On retirement: “I am a friend of Roger Federer and a great fan of tennis. He probably wants me to play a bit more tennis. The last time I played with Roger Federer, I think I won one point in a single set, and maybe I could do a bit better than that. And that would indeed delight me. But as to succession, you may also have noticed that the retirement age, which is very much in vogue, has been extended {from 62 to 64 by 2030 -Ed}.” ✈

"Louis Vuitton Reached €20B Revenue in 2022, LVMH Touts €79B - The Fashion Law","Fri, 27 Jan 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWZhc2hpb25sYXcuY29tL2xvdWlzLXZ1aXR0b24tcmVhY2hlZC1lMjBiLXJldmVudWUtaW4tMjAyMi1hcy1sdm1oLXRvdXRzLWU3OWItZm9yLXRoZS15ZWFyL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LVMH generated 79.2 billion euros ($85.9 billion) in revenue during 2022 and profits from recurring operations reached 21.1 billion euros ($22.9 billion), both up 23 percent from the year before. While all of the French luxury good conglomerate’s business groups achieved “significant organic revenue growth” over the year “despite the geopolitical and economic situation,” it highlighted Fashion & Leather Goods, which reached record levels, as well as the European, United States and Japanese marks, which “rose sharply, benefiting from strong demand from local customers and the recovery of international travel.” Asia was “stable” over the year due, according to LVMH, thanks to developments in the health situation in China.

For Q4, alone, LVMH’s revenue reached 22.7 billion euros ($24.65 billion), marking a 9 percent increase on an organic basis. “That marked a deceleration from the 20 percent growth recorded in the first nine months of the year,” per Reuters, with LVMH CFO Jean-Jacques Guiony attributing the fall wo the fact that China was “sharply down” during the last three months of 2022. “Everybody was sick, it’s as simple as that,” he said, noting that things are already looking up in 2023.

Delving into the full-year results for the Fashion & Leather Goods group, LVMH reported organic revenue growth of 20 percent to 38.6 billion euros ($41.9 billion) – and a profit of 15.7 billion euros (up 22 percent from 12.8 billion euros in 2021). 20 billion euros of the Fashion & Leather Goods group’s total revenue came from Louis Vuitton; this is the first time that the group’s marquee label reached the 20-billion-euro mark. Jefferies analysts said in a note on Thursday that they believe that taken together, Louis Vuitton and Christian Dior account for upwards of 75 percent of Fashion & Leather Goods revenue. Meanwhile, sales for Celine are now above 2 billion euros.

A key takeaway for Fashion & Leather Goods, according to LVMH chairman and CEO Bernard Arnault is global market share, with the individual division – which accounts for nearly 50 percent of LVMH’s total revenue – boasting a 17 percent share of the market, per Jefferies. That is up from an estimated 10 percent in 2018. “Louis Vuitton, Christian Dior, Celine, Fendi, Loro Piana, Loewe, and Marc Jacobs are all gaining market share globally and reaching record levels of revenue and earnings,” Bernstein analyst Luca Solca said in a note on Thursday. (As usual, Givenchy is missing from that list.)

In terms of balancing growth with market saturation, Arnault that the group’s products currently “sell nicely while remaining hard to find.”

Another business segment that is worthy of attention: Watches & Jewelry, which generated 10.6 billion euros ($11.5 billion) in revenue during FY 2022, up 18 percent on a reported basis, and a profit of 2 billion (up 20 percent from 2021). LVMH pointed to Tiffany & Co., which “had a record year, driven by its increasing desirability.” The New York-headquartered jewelry brand now has an EDIT of more than 1 billion euros – which has doubled since LVMH’s $15.8 billion acquisition of the the brand in early 2021. Meanwhile, Bvlgari “confirmed its strong momentum,” per LVMH, particularly in Europe, Japan and the United States, with “the iconic Serpenti line and the High Jewelry and High Watchmaking collections [being] the main growth drivers.”

In the latest indication that it is prioritizing hard luxury, LVMH management touted the group’s position aa “leaders in high jewelry worldwide.”

Looking ahead, LVMH says that it is “confident but vigilant [for FY23] due to current uncertainties,” stating that if the momentum coming out of China so far this year remains, 2023 will be an “excellent” year. In terms of China, LVMH management is “optimistic,” as while January has proven to be “volatile,” there are already indications of “a marked trend reversal” compared to December. Management also says that it expects some Chinese travel to Europe to resume in the second half of the year, but more meaningfully in 2024, which means that a return to FY19 levels will take time."
LVMH to accelerate bio-based and circular plastics switch with Dow - Cosmetics Business,"Mon, 30 Jan 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vY29zbWV0aWNzYnVzaW5lc3MuY29tL2x2bWgtdG8tYWNjZWxlcmF0ZS1iaW8tYmFzZWQtYW5kLWNpcmN1bGFyLXBsYXN0aWNzLXN3aXRjaC13aXRoLWRvdy0yMDY0ODbSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LVMH’s perfume and cosmetics division is teaming up with materials science company Dow to accelerate its use of sustainable packaging.

The collaboration will enable LVMH Beauty to integrate both bio-based and circular plastics into its product applications without compromising on packaging functionality or quality.

Dow said plastics made from bio-based and plastic waste feedstocks, respectively, will be used to make its sustainable Surlyn ionomers, which are used to manufacture premium perfume caps and cosmetic cream jars.

By the end of 2023, a portion of the Parfums Christian Dior and Guerlain-owner’s perfume packaging will include both bio-based Surlyn and circular Surlyn.

The materials are said to deliver the same crystalline transparency and freedom of design offered by the rest of Dow’s Surlyn range at a low carbon footprint.

Feedstocks for the production of bio-based Surlyn include raw materials, such as used cooking oil.

As only waste residues or by-products from an alternative production process are used, these raw feedstock materials do not consume extra land resources or compete with the food chain.

For the plastic waste version, hard-to-recycle mixed plastic waste is transformed into circular Surlyn through advanced recycling technologies, which break down waste plastics into their basic chemical elements using heat and pressure.

“At LVMH, with our Life 360 programme, we made the decision that our packaging will contain zero plastic from virgin fossil resources in a near future,” said Claude Martinez, Executive President and Managing Director of LVMH Beauty.

“Collaborating with Dow in developing sustainable Surlyn is key, as this material is used in some of our iconic perfumes, starting with Guerlain La Petite Robe Noire.

“It is helping LVMH achieve our sustainability targets without any compromise on quality.”

“Creating a circular economy takes every player in the value chain to commit to ambitious goals and challenge the status quo,” added Karen S Carter, President of Packaging & Specialty Plastics at Dow.

“Dow looks forward to supporting the sustainability journey of a leading global luxury brand.”"

In just a few months at Watches & Wonders 2023 there will be more new watches (including Bulgari’s men’s watches for the year), along with other product release points across the year.

2023 is particularly important for TAG Heuer as it marks the 60th anniversary of the Carrera, but many of those celebration models will wait until later. TAG Heuer did however release one of the most robust collections of new watches from all the LVMH brands this January. Best of all TAG Heuer focused on both traditional mechanical watches as well as various forms of modern electronic pieces. Bulgari introduced a series of high-jewelry timepieces mainly for women, and is keeping true to its trend of focusing lavish, Italian-themed aesthetics.

Zenith and Hublot offered strong collections which also remain true to their ongoing product and marketing strategies. Both brands come out with something new, as well as a new twist on something old. Color, bold lines, exotic materials, and skeletonized mechanics are all features of new Zenith and Hublot timepieces. With that said, brands also came out with at least one smaller, simpler model that can be enjoyed on both male and female wrists. Moods at LVMH were great given that global sales are strong despite global economic outlooks, and we looking forward to seeing what they will release next.

Below, check out aBlogtoWatch Editors’ list of their favorite new products from LVMH Watch Week 2023:

In 2023, LVMH continues to focus on making watches that appeal to a broad range of consumers. Whether you’re looking for a high-luxury status watch or a good-looking humble wrist instrument, LMVH brands, from Hublot to TAG Heuer, have something for everyone in the new year. TAG Heuer’s Connected Smartwatches continue to be a growing segment, and it is very positive to see the brand investing as much as possible in the software side of the experience. The Solargraph version of the Aquaracer is also a strong product, even though it will have mostly niche appeal. We also see that, absent any major new model families, the brands continue to impress with a degree of novelty and freshness that we’ve come to expect from LVMH. – Ariel Adams

Zenith Defy Skyline Skeleton

2023 may well be the “Year of the Skeleton” for LVMH. This year’s LVMH Watch Week saw a slew of dynamic cutaway designs from TAG Heuer and Hublot, but the best-executed skeleton of the group is arguably the Zenith Defy Skyline Skeleton. Not only does this build on the white-hot launch of the integrated-bracelet Defy Skyline from 2022, this 41mm-wide design offers a nigh-on perfect balance between legibility and visual spectacle. On the wrist, it’s as easy to read as the standard Defy Skyline, while opening up the design to showcase elements like aggressive blacked-out bridges and a striking iridescent green escape wheel. The skeleton layout itself deftly revives the brand’s classic four-pointed star motif for a balanced, symmetrical feel, and even improves on the symmetry of the standard model by relocating the conversation-starting 10-second subdial to 6 o’clock. In short, this is a bold and sporting design with enough on-wrist presence to truly compete with the hype kings of integrated horology, but an $11,000 USD price tag places it in far more affordable territory than many rivals. – Sean Lorentzen

Hublot Big Bang Tourbillon Automatic Yellow Neon SAXEM

While I enjoyed quite a few of the new releases from this year’s LVMH Watch Week, my hands-down favorite was the Hublot Big Bang Tourbillon Automatic Yellow Neon SAXEM. Up until this release, my all-time favorite Hublot watches were the ones with cases made from yellow sapphire, and this new model is everything that I love about the brand’s yellow sapphire watches, just turned up a notch and taken one step further. Swapping out a chronograph for a tourbillon with a micro-rotor, and opting for SAXEM over synthetic sapphire in order to achieve brighter and more vivid color, this is a watch that simply makes me happy and speaks to my inner child. The neon yellow SAXEM case offers a wild and lurid hue that looks like someone took a highlighter and a glow stick, cracked them open, and then dumped them into an extra large glass of Mountain Dew. I’ve loved this bizarre and unnatural color ever since I was a little kid, and absolutely none of its novelty has worn off now that I am an adult. Additionally, despite being one of Hublot’s most expensive models, the Big Bang Tourbillon Automatic Yellow Neon SAXEM doesn’t have the slightest whiff of precious metals or gemstones anywhere on it, which makes it all the more of an interesting and unusual flex. That said, with an official retail price of $211,000 USD, this is a watch that costs as much as a supercar or even a down payment on a house, and it, therefore, exists purely within the aspirational realm for me. However, just knowing that there are 50 of these insane neon yellow timepieces out there in the wild brings a smile to my face. – Ripley Sellers

TAG Heuer Monza Flyback Chronometer

In my initial news article announcing the TAG Heuer Monza Flyback Chronometer, I mentioned that the Monza name signals a paradigm shift every time it reappears in TAG Heuer’s stable, and that initial assessment stands firm. This is a technically impressive, stylistically wild leap forward for the TAG Heuer brand, with an impressive blend of futuristic spectacle and retro throwback visual cues. As with several other LVMH Watch Week 2023 launches, this is a thoughtfully arranged and impressively legible skeleton design, and the COSC-certified in-house flyback chronograph movement is every bit as dramatic as the exterior. All in all, it’s a technical and aesthetic step forward for TAG Heuer as a whole, but one that pays homage to some of its raciest heritage. At $13,850 USD, it’s certainly near the top of TAG Heuer’s market segment, but this is a far cry from a run-of-the-mill chronograph. – Sean Lorentzen

Hublot Big Bang Unico Time Only Rainbow

Subtle and restrained. These are two words that you will never use to describe Hublot’s Big Bang Integrated Time Only King Gold Rainbow (or its slightly larger, equally bedazzled chronograph sibling). The brand is no stranger to gem-set watches, having created a number of iterations over the last five years. But what stands out about this particular piece is the sheer volume of gemstones on display: 924, to be exact. The luxuriously warm King Gold case of the Time Only is set with 176 gemstones, including sapphire, ruby, amethyst, blue topaz, and tsavorite, with 748 more on the matching bracelet. Even more impressive is how smoothly the gradient of color transitions as you follow the tapered bracelet to the clasp; the jewels cycle through each hue of the rainbow in a gentle, colorful glissando. To set so many stones so precisely, and with such consistency in color, makes this piece more of an exercise in haute joaillerie than anything else, and it’s an audaciously bold one at that. This is not a watch for the meek — but then again, what Hublot is? – Ed Rhee

Zenith Defy Skyline 36mm

Watch industry trends shifts ever so slightly every year, and one of the most popular trends of late has been the integrated bracelet watch. Trickling out of the hype-driven craze around select models from prestigious brands is an insatiable demand for this type of watch. Now it seems every brand has created its own line to get a slice of the pie. While some enthusiasts are tired of the concept, it looks as if the integrated bracelet is here to stay as a staple in many catalogs. However, as these kinds of watches have become increasingly ubiquitous, there have been few that are designed for those with smaller wrists. Most integrated bracelet watches inherently wear larger than their dimensions may indicate due to the bracelet sticking out much further, resulting in a standard size (roughly 40mm) watch being too large for some.

The 36mm Zenith Defy Skyline presents the aggressively futuristic angular design in a compact package that results in a stunning yet unassuming package on the wrist. While most of the debut 36mm options cater to women with sunburst mint and lilac dials (and gem-set bezels), the blue dial is the cream of the crop. Granted, the smaller cases are accompanied by the Elite 670 movement, which is a little less exciting than the larger model. But it forgoes the controversial 1/10th-second subdial and makes it a fantastic everyday watch. While a retail price of $8,500 USD is nothing to scoff at, it is considerably less than other mid-sized integrated bracelet watches available from luxury brands and one of my favorite releases from LVMH Watch Week 2023. – Jake Witkin

TAG Heuer Aquaracer Professional 200 Solargraph

Amidst the sparkling gems of Bulgari, the striking color of Hublot, and the skeleton dials of Zenith, it was the more restrained TAG Heuer Aquaracer 200 Solargraph that stood out for me at this year’s LVMH Watch Week. On top of the rapid-charging solar movement that can run for a day on just two minutes of charge, the watch is made of rugged sandblasted titanium and offered in the ideally sized 40mm Aquaracer case (which I have long considered one of the best dive cases on the market). At $3,050 USD, the new Solargraph isn’t cheap (it’s actually more expensive than the automatic Aquaracer 200), but next to six-figure Hublots and seven-figure Bulgaris, this is a budget pick that offers watch enthusiasts with slightly deeper pockets a truly compelling option for a beater. It’s not without its shortcomings; it lacks a lumed bezel and doesn’t have the newest Aquaracer clasp seen on the 300 models, so I’ll be excited to see how these fare once they start hitting people’s wrists. – Mike Razak"
World's richest man sees LVMH empire post record $86B in sales - New York Post,"Thu, 26 Jan 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vbnlwb3N0LmNvbS8yMDIzLzAxLzI2L2Jlcm5hcmQtYXJuYXVsdHMtbHZtaC1wb3N0cy1yZWNvcmQtc2FsZXMtcHJvZml0LWZvci0yMDIyL9IBW2h0dHBzOi8vbnlwb3N0LmNvbS8yMDIzLzAxLzI2L2Jlcm5hcmQtYXJuYXVsdHMtbHZtaC1wb3N0cy1yZWNvcmQtc2FsZXMtcHJvZml0LWZvci0yMDIyL2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Luxury goods group LVMH’s sales rose 9% in the fourth quarter as shoppers in Europe and the United States splurged over the crucial holiday season, helping partly to offset COVID disruptions in China.

The world’s biggest luxury group, whose brands include Louis Vuitton, Givenchy and TAG Heuer, said 2022 sales soared 23% to a record 79 billion euros ($86 billion), and net profit jumped 17% to 14 billion euros ($15.2 billion), also a record.

Sales reached 22.7 billion euros ($24.65 billion) in the final three months of the year, with the 9% increase on an organic basis a touch above analyst expectations for 7% growth, based on a consensus cited by UBS.

That marked a deceleration from the 20% growth recorded in the first nine months of the year, due to the hit in China from lockdowns and its subsequent exit from a zero-COVID policy, which has spurred a surge of infections in the world’s second-largest economy.

“China was sharply down in the fourth quarter,” the group’s finance chief, Jean-Jacques Guiony, told reporters.

He said the pandemic had “spread like wildfire” after Beijing authorities relaxed travel curbs in December, causing problems in warehouses, stores and distribution networks.

“Everybody was sick, it’s as simple as that” he said. The situation had however markedly improved since the beginning of the year.

LVMH, a conglomerate spanning spirits, jewelry, cosmetics and fashion which is regarded as a bellwether for the wider luxury industry, does not give a breakdown for its brands.

But it said that in 2022 its star designer label Louis Vuitton, by far the world’s biggest, surpassed 20 billion euros in sales for the first time — around a quarter of total group revenues for the year, and double its sales of 2018.

LVMH has gained market share every year since 2019, its boss Bernard Arnault, the world’s richest man, said. He added that if the trends seen since the beginning of 2023 continued, it would have “another very good year.”

“Our products keep selling incredibly well even though they are difficult to find,” he said, highlighting the exclusivity of the group’s luxury fashions and accessories.

The group proposed a dividend of 12 euros per share, up from 10 euros a year ago.

“Louis Vuitton, Christian Dior, Celine, Fendi, Loro Piana, Loewe, and Marc Jacobs are all gaining market share globally and reaching record levels of revenue and earnings,” said Luca Solca, luxury analyst at Bernstein, referring to LVMH’s fashion and leather goods brands.

LVMH’s shares have hit new highs this month, giving the luxury goods group a market capitalisation of 400 billion euros for the first time and cementing its lead as Europe’s most valuable company.

Analysts expect a strong return of Chinese shoppers – the main source of profits for luxury companies before the pandemic – after three years of COVID disruptions to boost the industry this year.

But the sector is likely to still see a slowdown overall after two years of stellar growth, with demand easing in the United States and Europe, where rising prices have prompted some high-end spenders to tighten their purse strings."

Delphine Arnault – the 47-year-old daughter of Bernard Arnault – was promoted to the top job at Christian Dior, the company said Wednesday.

The heiress has worked for the family business for 22 years, and was most recently executive vice president of Louis Vuitton. She had previously been deputy managing director of Dior from 2001 to 2013.

She joins her four brothers in heading up one of LVMH’s companies or divisions, including Frederic who is CEO of Tag Heuer and Alexandre, 30, who was named executive vice president at Tiffany & Co. in 2021.

Of the five, Delpine Arnault has been most involved in fashion, as head of the group’s fashion prize for upcoming designers.

The announced changes, which come into effect in February, follow the recent appointment of Antoine Arnault, Bernard Arnault’s eldest son, to head the family’s holding company.

Bernard Arnault is the chairman and CEO of LVMH, which owns some 75 luxury brands. His latest move to elevate Delphine is seen as tightening the family’s grip on the conglomerate.

Also Wednesday, Pietro Beccari, who’d been head of Dior since 2018, was named the new boss for Louis Vuitton, replacing the long-time CEO, Michael Burke, 65.

“Both [Delphine and Beccari] are well respected; logical promotions within the group,” said Credit Suisse analyst Natasha Brilliant.

Burke, who is Bernard Arnault’s longest-serving lieutenant and has also been chairman of jewelry label Tiffany, will continue to work alongside the wealthy dad, the company said in a statement, without detailing his new role.

Shares in LVMH, Europe’s most valuable company at about 380 billion euros ($408 billion), rose as much as 2% to hit new highs. Shares in luxury companies have been boosted recently by the easing of COVID-19 restrictions in China, a key market.

One of the fashion industry’s most influential executives, Burke oversaw soaring growth at Louis Vuitton, the world’s largest luxury label, playing a key role for example in elevating street styles to the realm of luxury in recent years.

Beccari, meanwhile, who also previously led LVMH-owned label Fendi, increased sales at Christian Dior three-fold to 6.6 billion euros during his tenure, according to estimates from Citi. LVMH does not provide a breakdown of annual sales of its brands.

Beccari pushed the label into new products, including beach accessories such as surfboards and hammocks, bringing them closer to clients by setting up temporary retail outlets in resort locations including Mykonos, Greece, and Santa Barbara, California.

The executive steered a massive overhaul of the label’s historic Avenue Montaigne address in Paris, transforming it into a hulking flagship with restaurants and a museum, reviving foot traffic in the neighborhood.

Dior catwalk presentations in Paris, which are attended by global stars such as K-pop singer Jisoo and Rihanna, draw crowds of screaming fans, and the brand lit up social networks with a show from menswear designer Kim Jones in Egypt last month, with the pyramids serving as a backdrop.

Bernard Arnault is often spotted in the front row, flanked by his children.

“Succession planning in strategic roles has been instrumental to the success of LVMH’s key brands over the past 20 years, hence today’s moves are significant,” said Thomas Chauvet, analyst with Citi.

The tightening of the family’s hold on its empire also comes amid a wave of high-profile successions in other fashion companies in Europe, including at Prada and Zara owner Inditex.

Bernard Arnault, 73, has shown no signs he plans to step down soon and the company last year raised the maximum age of its CEO to 80 from 75.

All of his children hold management positions at brands in the group, carefully groomed by senior executives as they move up the ranks.

Delphine and Antoine, 45, are children from their father’s first marriage.

Alexandre Arnault is in charge of products and communication at Tiffany, while Frederic Arnault, 28, is CEO of another group brand, TAG Heuer. The youngest child, Jean Arnault, 24, heads marketing and product development for Louis Vuitton’s watches division.

As part of the management changes, the company is also folding Tiffany into the watches and jewelry division, under management of Stephane Bianchi."

In a series of unexpected moves, LVMH has reshuffled some of its top executives. Michael Burke, chairman and CEO of Louis Vuitton, will depart his role and take on an as-of-yet unnamed position “reporting directly” to LVMH chairman and CEO Bernard Arnault. Pietro Beccari, the head of Christian Dior Couture, will be replacing Burke as the new CEO and chairman of Louis Vuitton.

Most notably, Bernard Arnault’s daughter Delphine Arnault will now be taking over Beccari’s role as the new chairman and CEO of Christian Dior Couture. Prior to this appointment, Delphine acted as executive vice president of Louis Vuitton since 2013. Burke, Beccari and Delphine will be taking over their new roles starting on February 1, according to a press release from LVMH.

The Jing Take

With a net worth of 178 billion, LVMH head Bernard Arnault recently overtook Elon Musk as the world’s richest person. LVMH saw 56.5 billion in earnings over the first nine months of 2022, according to its Q3 reports.

In China, sales for Louis Vuitton remained “flat” throughout much of 2022 according to reports. However, the country’s recently loosened restrictions and departure from its zero-COVID policy point to a potential recovery for the luxury industry, as domestic consumers flock to Hainan province to take advantage of the newly-opened duty-free shopping outlets, and as Chinese international tourism is anticipated to rebound over the next few months.

In recent years, Arnault has appointed his five children as executives across a host of LVMH brands. His son Antoine heads Christian Dior SE, the holding company of Christian Dior Couture; meanwhile, Antoine’s siblings Alexandre, Frederic and Jean hold roles across Tiffany and Co., Tag Heuer, and Louis Vuitton, respectively.

This latest appointment of Delphine as head of Christian Dior Couture speaks to Arnault’s future plans for his family as well as the group. ""Succession planning in strategic roles has been instrumental to the success of LVMH's key brands over the past 20 years, hence today's moves are significant,"" an analyst at Citi told Reuters.

The big moves and reshuffles at LVMH are taking place amid all the recent debate about “nepotism babies, ” and the privileged lifestyles and successful careers that the children of celebrities and public figures are perceived — and criticized — as having been born into.

From Ivanka Trump’s role as senior advisor to her father former US President Donald Trump, to the rise of billionaire Samsung chairman Jay Y Lee (grandson of the group’s founder) and his 2021 acquittal of charges of bribery, and now the appointment of Delphine Arnault as head of Dior — the roles of children of prominent figures have raised questions about the nature of family empires.

However, according to one PwC report: “One of the main goals of the family business is not the maximization of profits, but its longevity and maintenance of what it stands for.”

The LVMH chairman, currently the world’s richest person with a net worth of $178 billion, appointed his daughter, Delphine, to run Christian Dior Couture on Wednesday. It’s the second-biggest brand in the French luxury conglomerate’s portfolio.

Delphine, who has been the executive VP of Louis Vuitton since 2013, will take over from Pietro Beccari as chairman and CEO of Dior on February 1. Beccari, who has helmed the house since 2018, will now become chairman and CEO of Louis Vuitton.

It’s somewhat of a full-circle moment for Delphine. The 47-year-old worked at Dior for 12 years in the early 2000s, cutting her teeth in the shoe department before rising to become a deputy general manager. She also joined the LVMH board in 2003 and was the first woman and youngest person to serve on it. For the past decade, Delphine has been number two in charge at LV and has been responsible for all of the maison’s product activities.

“Under her leadership, the desirability of Louis Vuitton products advanced significantly, enabling the brand to regularly set new sales records,” Bernard said in a statement. “Her keen insights and incomparable experience will be decisive assets in driving the ongoing development of Christian Dior.”

Delphine’s appointment comes just one month after the billionaire patriarch named his son Antoine as chief executive and chair of Christian Dior SE, the holding company that owns the majority of the family’s stake in luxury conglomerate LVMH. All five of his children now hold senior positions within the French company: Alexandre Arnault is an executive at Tiffany & Co.; Frederic Arnault is chief executive of TAG Heuer; and Jean Arnault takes care of marketing and product development for Louis Vuitton’s watches division.

Bernard appears to be tightening his family’s grip on LVMH, and for good reason: It’s now Europe’s most valuable company, worth about $408 billion. As for which child takes over as chairman of the group, we’ll have to wait and see. LVMH recently changed the maximum age of its CEO from 75 to 80 to give 73-year-old Bernard a few more years in the top spot."
LVMH CEO says Johnny Depp 'working very well' for Dior Sauvage sales - Glossy,"Mon, 30 Jan 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmdsb3NzeS5jby9iZWF1dHkvbHZtaC1jZW8tc2F5cy1qb2hubnktZGVwcC13b3JraW5nLXZlcnktd2VsbC1mb3ItZGlvci1zYXV2YWdlLXNhbGVzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Despite the controversy surrounding Johnny Depp in the past year, LVMH’s CEO said the actor drove major sales for Dior’s fragrance division.

According to LVMH CEO Bernard Arnault during the January 26 presentation for the luxury conglomerate’s 2022 financial report, Dior Sauvage was “a leader in perfume sales” over the course of the year, “achieving remarkable success” that was “driven by the image of Johnny Depp.”

“You’ve probably seen the ads; that’s working very well,” he said.

In the “2022 highlights” section of LVMH’s financial report, Dior Sauvage is the only fragrance listed under “strong growth in perfumes.” The report states that “the continued global success of Dior’s Sauvage, once again world leader in 2022,” was a main point of success. The other beauty-related highlight mentioned was “A remarkable rebound for Sephora, which confirmed its place as world leader in the distribution of beauty products.”

Dior Beauty has kept Depp as the face of Dior Sauvage since the fragrance’s 2015 launch, even after he was dropped by both Disney and Warner Brothers from major film franchises over the controversy surrounding abuse allegations by ex-wife Amber Heard.

Following the start of the highly publicized April 2022 trial in which Depp sued Heard for defamation, the actor was prominently featured in ads for the fragrance. This included a TV commercial that aired in June 2022 with the tagline “Fearless yet human,” as well as Sephora Instagram ads in May. His image also continued to appear on in-store displays of the fragrance, while Dior Beauty last featured him on its Instagram account in a September post showing a clip of the commercial. In August, it posted several videos of him performing at a concert in Paris.

Overall, LVMH’s perfumes and cosmetics division received 17% revenue growth in 2022. While Dior Sauvage was the main fragrance named as a growth driver, other flagship fragrances including Miss Dior and J’adore were highlighted during the earnings presentation, along with the Prestige serum and TikTok-viral Dior Addict lip oil. Guerlain, Parfums Givenchy and Fenty Beauty were also listed as sales drivers.

The sensationalism of the Depp v. Heard trial earned more social engagement at the time than any other news story, according to Axios. Viral posts about the trial leaned in favor of Depp, despite the evidence of abuse presented by Heard’s legal team at the trial. Support for Depp was also amplified online by far-right influencers, while right-wing media outlet The Daily Wire spent tens of thousands of dollars on ads in support of Depp.

Depp is still featured on Dior Beauty’s homepage and reportedly renewed his contract with Dior in 2022. A representative from Dior Beauty was unable to provide details by the time of this story’s publication. The brand’s most recent social posts about Dior Sauvage feature an ad with soccer star Kylian Mbappe, who was named a global ambassador for the fragrance in 2021."
"Real-life 'Succession' story of world's richest man, Bernard Arnault, & his kids - New York Post","Fri, 27 Jan 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vbnlwb3N0LmNvbS8yMDIzLzAxLzI3L3JlYWwtc3VjY2Vzc2lvbi1zdG9yeS1vZi1iZXJuYXJkLWFybmF1bHQtd29ybGRzLXJpY2hlc3Qv0gFaaHR0cHM6Ly9ueXBvc3QuY29tLzIwMjMvMDEvMjcvcmVhbC1zdWNjZXNzaW9uLXN0b3J5LW9mLWJlcm5hcmQtYXJuYXVsdC13b3JsZHMtcmljaGVzdC9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"All eyes were on Delphine Arnault at the Christian Dior runway show last week in Paris, as she took a front-row seat between David Beckham and Robert Pattinson. The 47-year-old was easy to spot among the celebrity guests in a scarlet equestrian-inspired jacket from the house’s latest resort collection, befitting her new brand allegiance.

Only a few weeks earlier, the executive and oldest child of LVMH chairman and chief executive Bernard Arnault — aka the richest man in the world, with a net worth of more than $170 billion — was anointed with a shiny new job. After nearly a decade as a top executive at Louis Vuitton, Delphine will soon become the CEO of Dior, the second-largest brand in her father’s luxury empire. It marks the highest-level operational role ever filled by one of the luxury tycoon’s five children and raises the “Succession”-like question of who will one day take over the family business. Which, in this case, happens to be the world’s largest luxury conglomerate.

In recent years, the next generation of Arnaults has taken on increased roles in the business they were born to dominate. Bernard entered the luxury market in the 1980s and scaled LVMH through aggressive acquisitions and careful brand management. Today, his portfolio includes Louis Vuitton, Christian Dior, Marc Jacobs, Fendi and Givenchy; Tiffany & Co., Bulgari and TAG Heuer; as well as high-end spirits, chains of luxury hotel properties and other lucrative business lines that generate around $70 billion a year in revenue.

“This business is run for the next generation — they think like a family,” Erwan Rambourg, global head of consumer and retail research at HSBC, told The Post. “They think for the next 15 to 20 years.”

Bernard is 73 years old, but he shows no interest in stepping away from his luxury empire nor relinquishing his roles as executive chairman and chief executive. LVMH shareholders recently extended the company’s working age limit to 80, and many expect Bernard will never retire.

He has long made clear in interviews that control of the family business will remain in the family — with responsibilities doled out according to each child’s abilities. But the question of who will inherit his leadership position is said to be an uncouth topic within the business. And despite the recent promotions, industry watchers agree there isn’t a clear successor yet.

A representative for LVMH declined to comment on any succession plans.

The next decade will be a defining test for Bernard’s children in terms of who will emerge as the most capable inheritor of their father’s influence and control. In addition to Delphine, Bernard’s children include sons Antoine, 45; Alexandre, 30; Frédéric, 28; and Jean, 24.

The choice of a successor may also come down to temperament. Delphine and Frédéric have been described as more competitive, while Antoine and Alexandre are more

gregarious. But all the children have been training to succeed in the family business since they were young.

“I feel like I’ve been in an MBA since [I was] born because every lunch or dinner conversation is probably about the business,” said Alexandre during a talk at Oxford University last year. “There is pressure, of course, but it’s also only if I meet the expectations.”

The eldest son, Antoine, cuts a glamorous figure alongside his Russian supermodel wife, Natalia Vodianova. He and Delphine are the children of Bernard and ex-wife Anne Dewavrin. Like his sister, Antoine has worked for the family business since the early to mid-2000s. He is currently the head of the conglomerate’s communications strategy, with a special focus on Louis Vuitton, and a leader at some of its smaller labels, including Berluti and Loro Piana. He is also the face of LVMH’s sustainability efforts and, in December, was named the CEO of one of the family’s holding companies through which it owns LVMH, adding to his varied responsibilities.

The three youngest brothers, children from Bernard’s second marriage to Canadian pianist Hélène Mercier, have followed into the business over the last decade, assuming executive roles at major LVMH brands. And they’ve ascended quickly.

Frédéric is said to be most like his father and is the only one to have followed Bernard’s path to top French science and engineering university École Polytechnique. He was named CEO at TAG Heuer at just 25 years old.

Alexandre, whose wedding to designer Géraldine Guyot in Venice in 2021 was attended by the likes of Beyoncé, Jay-Z and Roger Federer, appears to be the most American of his siblings — fluent in startup language that also befits his position as the first millennial Arnault heir. Two years ago, he moved to New York to become the executive vice president of products and communication at Tiffany & Co., newly acquired after an ugly legal battle over the terms of the deal.

He and Frédéric have embraced crypto, despite their father’s skepticism for the metaverse, and are proud owners of Cryptopunk and Bored Ape NFTs.

Youngest brother Jean has followed Frédéric’s interest in timepieces and is the head of marketing and development of watches at Louis Vuitton since 2021.

Despite the abundance of wealth, power and influence that comes with being the heirs of the richest man in the world, the Arnault siblings have notably avoided scandal and controversy that often plagues families atop business empires. There are no black sheep here.

Once they join the company ranks, their father often pairs them with seasoned executives who mentor and monitor them. For example, former TAG Heuer CEO Stéphane Bianchi told the New York Times he worked closely with Frédéric at the watch brand and advised his father when he was ready to take the top role there in 2020.

Instead of posting pictures of themselves in private jets or private islands on social media, the children’s accounts focus on their latest projects for their various brands and simple family photos. They reveal glimpses of their personal passions (for Alexandre, running in the New York City Marathon; for Antoine, playing golf). Even the youngest, Jean, is in a long-term romantic relationship, with a posh young French woman Zita d’Hauteville.

Bernard’s children have also picked up many of their father’s interests, including high-end art collecting and playing piano (Alexandre and Frédéric are noted for their concert-level talent, probably also encouraged by their mother’s talent). The children share their father’s passion for tennis, too, frequently squaring off against him or sitting together courtside at Roland Garros.

Indeed, a love of competition is in their blood. Their father has a reputation for aggressive dealmaking, having built the LVMH by often leveraging dissent within family-owned businesses — earning him the epithet “the wolf in cashmere clothing.” Famously, he exploited a disagreement between the top two executives at LVMH that allowed him to take control of the group and oust the Louis Vuitton family in 1989.

Growing up, the children frequently joined their father as he visited LVMH brands’ stores on the weekends, and those of competitors, as part of his unwavering obsession with strengthening his empire. Delphine, who was often consulted about the design of upcoming products by her father as a teenager, was gifted her first Louis Vuitton bag, the Noé bucket style, at age 18. The boys had their own version of the privileged coming-of-age milestone: Frédéric and Jean received their first TAG Heuer watch at ages 11 and 15, respectively.

Within this context, something as simple as buying a suitcase from a non-LVMH brand counts as youthful rebellion. Alexandre said his purchase of a suitcase from the German luggage brand Rimowa raised eyebrows from his father but later led to LVMH acquiring the brand in 2017. Through hip product collaborations with the late designer Virgil Abloh and Supreme, Alexandre has led a brand overhaul that positioned Rimowa as the go-to suitcase for the global traveling elite.

Alexandre’s role at Tiffany’s, while not at the CEO level, comes with high stakes: The pressure is on to reinvigorate a business that came with a hefty $15.8 billion acquisition price. Despite early signs of progress, the turnaround is ongoing.

His impact is best seen in Tiffany’s high-profile 2021 campaign with two celebrities he considers longtime friends: Jay-Z and Beyoncé. The advertising stunt drew some controversy because it featured Tiffany’s yellow diamond necklace, worn by Beyoncé, which raised questions about the ethics of the origins of the South African jewel as well as the use of a Basquiat painting in the ad. But the campaign generated ample headlines, and Tiffany’s collaboration with Beyoncé continued in 2022.

Delphine, who spent the last decade in a top role at Louis Vuitton, is described as more guarded than her siblings. She is not public on social media and rarely speaks about her private life or two children with her current partner, the French tech billionaire Xavier Niel. (The approach contrasts with her first wedding, to Italian wine heir Alessandro Vallarino Gancia in 2005, which was heralded by tabloids as the event of the season. They quietly divorced five years later.)

Likewise, Delphine’s tenure at Dior comes at a critical time for the fast-growing luxury house. Its business has transformed in recent years. Its revenue quadrupled since 2018 to more than $9 billion under its most recent CEO, Pietro Beccari, whom Arnault has appointed to lead the group’s largest and most important brand, Louis Vuitton.

But her father has faith.

“[Delphine’s position as CEO of Dior] is an extremely high-pressure role,” said a fashion insider, “and there’s no way he would have put her there if he didn’t think she could handle it.”"

Starting Feb. 1, 47-year-old Delphine Arnault, who has served as the executive vice president of Louis Vuitton since 2013, will take the reins at LVMH’s second-largest brand, the company announced on Jan. 11.

The links in the chain of command at the French luxury conglomerate are all changing with this management shakeup: Delphine succeeds Pietro Beccari, who is moving onto being chairman and CEO of Louis Vuitton after his four-year stint at Dior. Meanwhile, Beccari replaces Michael Burke, who spent a decade leading Louis Vuitton. Burke will take up new responsibilities, reporting directly to Bernard Arnault.

Delphine is a great fit for the Dior role, in her father’s words

“The appointment of Delphine Arnault is another milestone in a career journey in fashion and leather goods defined by excellence, first during 12 years at Christian Dior and then at Louis Vuitton for the past decade where she was number two with responsibility for all of the Maison’s product activities. Under her leadership, the desirability of Louis Vuitton products advanced significantly, enabling the brand to regularly set new sales records. Her keen insights and incomparable experience will be decisive assets in driving the ongoing development of Christian Dior.” -Bernard Arnault

People of interest: Bernard Arnault’s children

Delphine, the oldest of Bernard’s five children, isn’t the only one to hold an executive position at the group. Most of her siblings do, too. And similarly to their sister’s French business school EDHEC and London School of Economics education and tenures at LV and Dior, the Arnault progeny have exceptional educational pedigrees and impressive resumés.

Antoine Arnault, 45, was named CEO of holding company Christian Dior SE—which controls 41% of the capital and 56% of the voting rights in the LVMH group—and vice chairman of its board of directors in early December. He is also the CEO of high-end footwear and apparel label Berluti, and the chairman of Italian label Loro Piana. Antoine has degrees from French business school INSEAD and Canadian business school HEC Montreal.

Alexandre Arnault, 30, is executive vice president, in charge of product and communications at jewelry brand Tiffany. Between 2016 and 2020, he was CEO of LVMH-owned German luggage-maker Rimowa.

Frederic Arnault, 28, has been CEO of watch brand Tag Heuer since 2020. Alexandre got a master’s degree from French university Ecole Polytechnique.

Jean Arnault, the youngest of the lot at 24, has been director of marketing and development of Louis Vuitton’s watches division since August 2021. He’s only joined the group recently, but comes armed with experience at prestigious companies like McLaren and Morgan Stanley.

Who will take over from Bernard Arnault?

Rumor had it that the 73-year-old scion started priming and auditioning his two oldest children for a key job—his own—a decade ago. But as more time passes, the competition is only getting stiffer. All five children from two different marriages seem to be in the running for the corporate throne at the luxury empire.

In mid-2022, the tycoon tweaked the structure of the holding company to ones used by the likes of other French family-owned firms Hermes and Michelin to prevent takeovers and ensure the control stays within the bloodline. Bernard, who has been chairman since 1989, still has time to decide who will replace him as he weighs extending his tenure to the age of 80.

SOPA IMAGES / LIGHTROCKET VIA GETTY IMAGES

""Hello Google. How much is 79.2 billion euros in revenue in dollars?"" At the opening of the LVMH annual results press conference in Paris on Thursday, January 26, the question posed by Robert Williams, a journalist for The Business of Fashion, a US publication devoted to the fashion industry, echoed the astonishment of financial analysts when reading the results of the world's number one luxury goods company.

""A new record year,"" said Bernard Arnault, its CEO. Thanks to a jump in activity of 23%, the group, which owns the brands Louis Vuitton, Dior, Tiffany, and Dom Perignon, is now close to the 80 billion euro mark in revenue. Group operating margin was unchanged at 26.6%, net profit topped €14 billion. ""We are regaining market share, something not seen since 2019,"" observed Arnault, whose group now has the largest market capitalization in Europe, ahead of Shell, after crossing the 400 billion euro mark in mid-January.

LVMH benefited in particular from the results of its fashion brands. For the first time, Louis Vuitton revenue topped €20 billion, while Celine's revenue exceeded €2 billion, thanks to Hedi Slimane's creations. The performance of New York jeweler Tiffany, which LVMH is bringing new momentum to since acquiring it for a record 15.8 billion dollars in 2021, is also ""remarkable,"" Arnault said. With operating income ""over a billion euros,"" Arnault is confident that Tiffany would be worth ""more than twice what it was worth on the stock market"" when it was bought.

Bernard Arnault is 'fairly confident' about 2023

How will the 2023 fiscal year unfold? That's the question that's on the minds of financial analysts. Growth forecasts for the luxury market, valued at €353 billion in 2022, are in the low range compared to usual performances: Bain & Company expects ""+3% to +8%"" this year, compared with +21% last year. Macroeconomic uncertainties lead HSBC analysts to advise ""caution.""

But Arnault is ""quite confident."" He believes that Chinese spending will revive domestically and in Europe and Asia. Specifically, Chinese consumers accounted for one-third of sales of luxury goods in 2019, before the start of the coronavirus pandemic. Tourists will probably return ""as early as this summer,"" Arnault predicted. Tens of thousands of tourists from Hong Kong and mainland China have already flocked to Macau's casinos in January to celebrate the Chinese New Year. ""If the start of the year is confirmed,"" 2023 should be ""a very good year,"" Arnault believes.

Nothing seems to shake the 73-year-old leader – not even questions about his succession. Asked about plans at the post-results press conference, Arnault quipped, ""You will have noticed that the retirement age is being raised."" Since the general meeting of shareholders on 21 April 2022, which decided to raise the age limit for the CEO of LVMH from 75 to 80, several decisions have provoked speculation.

Leadership Shakeup at LVMH Sees Louis Vuitton and Dior Get New CEOs - HYPEBEAST,"Wed, 11 Jan 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vaHlwZWJlYXN0LmNvbS8yMDIzLzEvbHZtaC1uZXctY2Vvcy1sb3Vpcy12dWl0dG9uLXBpZXRyby1iZWNjYXJpLWRpb3ItZGVscGhpbmUtYXJuYXVsdC1hbm5vdW5jZW1lbnTSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LVMH is starting 2023 with major executive shuffles within its fastest-growing flagship houses. In a momentous and unprecedented shakeup, the parent company has named the former head of Dior, Pietro Beccari to become the chairman and CEO of Louis Vuitton. Succeeding him as CEO of Dior is Delphine Arnault, Bernard Arnault‘s eldest child and LV’s executive vice president for the product for nine years. Michael Burke, who has long played a major role at the house, steps down at Louis Vuitton after a decade-long tenure. According to LVMH, Burke will “take up new responsibilities, reporting directly to Bernard Arnault.” Bernard Arnault is currently the chairman and CEO of LVMH, as well as head of the main family holding company, Financière Agache.

To accommodate the C-suite changes, Charles Delapalme has been elevated to managing director of Christian Dior Couture. He has been the executive vice president of Christian Dior’s commercial activities since 2018 and is well-versed in the conduct of the house. In addition, the chairman and CEO of LVMH’s watches and jewelry division, Stéphane Bianchi, will now have Tiffany & Co. and Repossi under his portfolio.

The management shuffle is one of the biggest announcements made amongst Europe’s largest luxury fashion groups. Back in November, Kering announced that Gucci will be parting ways with creative director Alessandro Michele, who had been in the role since 2015. On a management level, Prada saw LVMH’s former executive Andrea Guerra succeed Patrizio Bertelli as CEO after Miuccia Prada steps down as Prada Group CEO alongside her husband. Delphine Arnault’s move to Dior is her first CEO role under the LVMH empire. Up until the announcement, the eldest daughter of Bernard has played a more behind-the-scenes role. However, as the world saw the unveiling of the Yayoi Kusama x Louis Vuitton collaboration, Delphine is now placed in the spotlight as millions follow her upcoming plans for the house of Dior. Bernard categorizes these “significant organizational changes” at Louis Vuitton and Dior as “another milestone in a career journey in fashion and leather goods defined by excellence.”

As for Beccari, the appointment sees the CEO return to Louis Vuitton and the second time he has succeeded Burke. In 2012, Beccari succeeded Burke as chairman and CEO of Fendi. Prior to that, he joined Louis Vuitton in 2006 as the director of strategy and marketing coordination, ultimately rising to executive vice president. Under Burke’s tenure, Louis Vuitton’s revenues tripled and exceeded €21 billion EUR. With many changes happening under LVMH, including the most recent announcement that KidSuper co-creating Louis Vuitton’s upcoming FW23 menswear collection, it appears that LVMH is signaling big changes in vision for their major luxury houses.

The executive changes are said to be effective starting on February 1, 2023.

By Georgie Collins

The wine and spirits business of LVMH has seen revenue soar by double digits in its full-year 2022 results.

The French company recorded a revenue growth of 19% in 2022 to reach €7.09 billion (US$54.9bn) for the full financial year.

Profit from recurring operations rose by 16%, equating to €2.15bn.

Bernard Arnault, chairman and CEO of LVMH, said: “Our performance in 2022 illustrates the exceptional appeal of our Maisons and their ability to create desire during a year affected by economic and geopolitical challenges.”

The luxury goods firm noted that momentum was particularly strong in Europe, Japan and in emerging markets, particularly in ‘high energy’ channels and gastronomy.

LVMH said Hennessy Cognac had benefited from its ‘value creation strategy’, which places priority on organic growth and commits significant resources to develop its Maisons, as well as to encourage and protect creativity.

The company also noted that the dynamic policy of price increases has offset the effects of the ‘health situation’ in China, while the United States was affected at the start of the year by ‘logistical disruptions’.

The company said that 2023 has started well, and despite an uncertain geopolitical and economic environment, it is confident in its ability to continue the growth observed in 2022.

Looking ahead, LVMH will continue to pursue its brand development focused strategy, underpinned by continued innovation and investment, as well as a ‘constant quest for desirability and quality’ in its products and their distribution.

Earlier this month, Hennessy opened its first dedicated store in Paris Charles de Gaulle Airport."

CHRISTIAN HARTMANN / REUTERS

A prestigious engineering university in France was set to have a new center near its campus, led by none other than the prestigious luxury group LVMH. But, in a new blow for the president of the Ecole Polytechnique and the research university system Institut Polytechnique de Paris (IPP), Eric Labaye has failed to land LVMH. On Monday, January 23, the luxury goods group confirmed that it had abandoned its €100 million project to create a research laboratory on the Plateau de Saclay, also known as the European Silicon Valley, near the Ecole Polytechnique, a prestigious engineering school.

In a letter sent on January 13, the CEO of the luxury group Bernard Arnault informed Grégoire de Lasteyrie, the mayor of Palaiseau, and Philippe Van de Maele, Directeur Général de l’Etablissement Public d’Aménagement Paris-Saclay (EPA-PS, Director General of the Paris-Saclay Public Development Establishment), that his choice had fallen on another ""piece of land located outside the Palaiseau-Saclay plateau and the perimeter of the EPA-PS."" LVMH did not specify the address it had finally chosen.

Three months ago, on November 8, despite the opposition of the organization called La Polytechnique N'Est Pas à Vendre! (the Polytechnique is not for sale!), the institution's board of directors had given the green light to the purchase of land belonging to the EPA. The group, with a turnover of €64 billion euros, was to create a 22,500 square-meter research laboratory on the site.

Arnault promised that he wanted to employ 300 researchers there to work on ""sustainable materials, data and artificial intelligence, as well as life sciences."" Polytechnique N'Est Pas à Vendre! filed two appeals to overturn this decision before the Versailles administrative court in December 2022 and January 2023. LVMH stated that its reversal is not linked to the litigation. ""We have found another site that fits in perfectly with our architectural and research project,"" said a spokesperson, without explaining the about-face.

Lack of consistency

The school's management has suffered another setback, almost exactly one year after being abandoned by TotalEnergies. In January 2022, after months of controversy, an unprecedented demonstration by Polytechnique students who are reputedly not very rebellious, and the Parquet National Financier's (National Financial Prosecutor's Office) opening of a preliminary investigation against Patrick Pouyanné, CEO of the oil group and a member of the Polytechnic's board of directors, for possible unlawful conflict of interest, TotalEnergies threw in the towel.

Musée d'Orsay acquires Caillebotte masterpiece thanks to €43m donation from LVMH - Art Newspaper,"Mon, 30 Jan 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWFydG5ld3NwYXBlci5jb20vMjAyMy8wMS8zMC9tdXNlZS1kb3JzYXktYWNxdWlyZXMtY2FpbGxlYm90dGUtbWFzdGVycGllY2UtbHZtaC1kb25hdGlvbtIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The Musée d’Orsay in Paris has acquired a major Impressionist painting by Gustave Caillebotte thanks to luxury goods conglomerate LVMH, which paid €43m ($46.7m) for the work. The canvas, Partie de Bateau (Boating Party, around 1877-78), went on display at the Paris museum today (30 January). The €43m acquisition was confirmed by a museum spokesperson. The Musée d’Orsay’s annual acquisitions budget meanwhile platforms at around €3m, according to Le Monde .

According to The Washington Post , the painting was sold by Caillebotte’s descendants and was one of the last Impressionist masterpieces still in private hands, said Jean-Paul Claverie, an adviser to collector and LVMH chief executive Bernard Arnault.

According to a statement from the French ministry of culture, the work will be shown at several locations across France next year to mark the 150th anniversary of the birth of Impressionism (the first Impressionist exhibition opened in 1874 at 35 Boulevard des Capucines in Paris).

“Impressionist masterpieces from the Musée d’Orsay collection will also be shown in around 20 museums across French territory,” adds the ministry. Meanwhile, a major Caillebotte exhibition is planned for autumn 2024 at the Musée d’Orsay.

The work was classified as a “national treasure” by the former French culture minister Franck Riester in 2020. The current culture minister, Rima Abdul Malak, says in a statement that “thanks to the patronage of LVMH, I am delighted that this masterpiece enriches our heritage and will be shown in several towns across France. It is the first time that such an initiative has been organised for a national treasure.”

The Musée d’Orsay website states that Boating Party shows an unidentified man boating on the Yerres river that flows near a holiday property owned by the Caillebotte family in south-east Paris. “The painter presents an ‘immersive’ framing [technique] that places the viewer in the boat, seeking to abolish the distance between the space of the painting and that of the viewer,” adds the statement."

Families can fall out, split or end up with internal feuds worthy of a Netflix mini-series.

The worlds of fashion and luxury goods have more than their fair share of family-owned and family-run businesses.

Chanel is controlled by lain and Gerard Wertheimer, having been founded by their grandfather, Pierre, and Coco Chanel more than 100 years ago.

The Missoni family still own the Italian knitwear brand of the same name that was set up by Ottavio Missoni in the late 1950s. And, likewise, the US fashion label Ralph Lauren remains under the stewardship of the Lauren family, with Ralph Lauren himself as executive chairman and his son, David, as chief innovation officer and vice chairman on the board.

Family first

But the daddy when it comes to family businesses is LVMH, the French luxury goods giant owned by the Arnault family.

The head of the family, Bernard Arnault, was recently declared the world's richest man with a net worth estimated by Forbes magazine to be $180 billion.

The company the family controls, LVMH, is a luxury goods conglomerate, with brands ranging from Louis Vuitton to Tag Heuer, from Tiffany to Moët and Chandon, from Christian Dior to Bulgari.

Indeed, LVMH has about 75 brands in its stable, more than 5,500 shops and more than 175,000 employees worldwide. In the first nine months of 2022, LVMH made €56.6 billion ($61.07 billion) in revenue, up 28 per cent compared with the first three quarters of 2021.

But the Mr Arnault, 73, is looking to the future. Who will be running Europe's most valuable company when he steps down? In a series of strategic management moves this week, it became clearer what the company will look like after he retires.

Thomas Chauvet, luxury analyst at Citi, told The National: ""Succession planning is very important at LVMH. Decisions are taken with a long-term strategic view. It's a case of having prudent succession, rather than a big bang.""

As part of the reshuffle this week, Mr Arnault's daughter, Delphine, 47, has been promoted to run the fashion brand Dior.

Delphine Arnault, daughter of Bernard Arnault, has been appointed chief executive of Christian Dior Couture. AFP

Delphine Arnault is the eldest of Mr Arnault's five children and for the past 10 years has been the executive vice chairman at Louis Vuitton, which contributes nearly 50 per cent of the group's overall earnings.

Meanwhile, the current head of Dior, Pietro Beccari, is moving to replace long-time Louis Vuitton chief executive Michael Burke.

Delphine Arnault returns to Dior having worked there prior to 2013, and will be keenly watched to see if she can match Mr Beccari's performance, who managed to triple revenues at Dior in just four years.

""Her keen insights and incomparable experience will be decisive assets in driving the ongoing development of Christian Dior,"" Mr Arnault said of his daughter's promotion.

""This is not a coup,"" Thomas Chauvet, luxury analyst at Citi, told The National. ""These are two managers who have been selected to run two very important brands. LVMH has a huge pool of talent.

""Delphine Arnault's promotion is the latest move in what is a very long process of succession at LVMH.""

'Sense of shared purpose'

Ken McCracken and Hakan Hillerstrom are consultants who specialise in family businesses. In their book, Fourteen Steps to Stronger Family Governance, they said: ""The greatest strength in a family business is a clear and strong sense of shared purpose among the owners and the wider family. It can generate a sense of belonging, worth and shared resolve that non-family businesses are unlikely to be able to generate among their owners. This is a competitive advantage that family businesses should try to maximise.""

It's certainly something the fashion company Prada has tried to maximise.

Founded by Mario Prada and his brother Martino in Milan in 1913, the Italian company really came to prominence under Mario's granddaughter Miuccia and her husband Patrizio Bertelli in the early 1980s.

Last month, Patrizio Bertelli and Miuccia Prada, the couple who run the Prada Group, effectively handed the company reins to Andrea Guerra, a luxury industry veteran, on the understanding that the couple's son and great grandson of the Italian firm's founder will become chief executive within a few years.

But feuds and infighting can destroy family businesses. One of the best examples of this was the long-running dispute and legal action involving the members of the Pritzker family, owners of the Hyatt Hotel Group.

When the family patriarch and co-founder of Hyatt Hotels, Jay Pritzker, died in 1999, the business was split between 11 cousins, each of whom eventually walked away with about $1.3 billion.

Happy families?

As far as the Arnault family is concerned, there are no real signs of discontent between the siblings.

Analysts at RBC Capital Markets said the management reshuffle ""reflects ongoing leadership transition within the Arnault family"".

Last month, Bernard's eldest son, Antonie Arnault, 45, was made the chief executive and chair of Christian Dior SE, the holding company that controls 41 per cent of the capital and 56 per cent of the voting rights in the LVMH group.

Perhaps the most important succession move made by the Arnault family in recent years came last summer, when the family's holding company, Financiere Agache, which itself controls Christian Dior SE, turned itself into a French legal entity known as a ""société en commandite"".

Not only does this make it easier to facilitate family control over itself and, by extension LVMH, but it also protects against unwanted takeovers. It is not that common in France, but two of the country's other big family-owned businesses, Hermes and Michelin, have made similar moves.

The other three Arnault children, Alexandre, Frederic and Jean, all hold senior positions in LVMH.

Since 2020, 30-year old Alexandre Arnault has been an executive vice president at the jewellery brand Tiffany. Before that he was the chief executive of the luggage-maker Rimowa.

Frederic Arnault, 28, is chief executive at the watchmaker Tag Heuer and 24-year old Jean is a watch development and marketing director at Louis Vuitton’s watches division.

Some observers believe that all the pieces are in place for Bernard Arnault to step aside and leave the running of LVMH to his children now and later to his grandchildren and further descendants.

Any further hints will be closely analysed when LVMH unveils its 2022 profit numbers, expected in less than two weeks.

However, Bernard Arnault could opt to carry on for a few years. Just last year the company changed its own bylaws to increase the age limit for a chief executive allowed to run the company, from 75 to 80."
France Acquires Caillebotte Painting with $47 M. in Funding from LVMH - ARTnews,"Mon, 30 Jan 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFydG5ld3MuY29tL2FydC1uZXdzL25ld3MvZnJhbmNlLWFjcXVpcmVzLWNhaWxsZWJvdHRlLXBhaW50aW5nLW11c2VlLWRvcnNheS1sdm1oLTEyMzQ2NTU3NzAv0gFsaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYXJ0bmV3cy5jb20vYXJ0LW5ld3MvbmV3cy9mcmFuY2UtYWNxdWlyZXMtY2FpbGxlYm90dGUtcGFpbnRpbmctbXVzZWUtZG9yc2F5LWx2bWgtMTIzNDY1NTc3MC9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Jean-Paul Claverie, an adviser to Bernard Arnault, and French culture minister Rima Abdul-Malak look at the painting Gustave Caillebotte's Boating Party.

The luxury holdings company LVMH has backed France’s acquisition of a valuable painting by Gustave Caillebotte. The painting will now be held by the Musée d’Orsay in Paris.

The work, A Boating Party (1877), features a close-up view of a man rowing a wooden skiff along a river. It’s the latest addition to the Musée d’Orsay’s substantial collection of Impressionist art, which is already substantial. The core of those holdings were established after work from Caillebotte’s estate, which included pieces by Auguste Renoir and Claude Monet, was gifted to the French state upon his death in 1894.

A Boating Party was sold by Caillebotte’s descendants. An adviser to LVMH’s owner, Bernard Arnault, told the Associated Press that the painting was one of the few major works still held privately.

Arnault is a prominent collector who regularly appears on the ARTnews Top 200 Collectors list. His company supplied $47 million for the French state’s purchase of the work.

LVMH has backed previous Musée d’Orsay exhibitions, including a 2012 one about Impressionism and fashion.

This is the second major Caillebotte painting to head to a museum in the past two years. In November 2021, the Getty Museum in Los Angeles acquired Jeune homme à sa fenêtre (Young Man at His Window, 1876) for $53 million when it sold during a sale of Impressionist art from the estate of a Texas oil magnate at Christie’s. The sale set a new record for the artist.

In a statement, the French government’s culture minister, Rima Abdul Malak, called the acquisition and the agency’s move to keep the work in a French museum a “victory.”"
Dior CEO Beccari to lead Louis Vuitton in LVMH management shuffle - Vogue Business,"Thu, 12 Jan 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZvZ3VlYnVzaW5lc3MuY29tL2NvbXBhbmllcy9kaW9yLWNlby1iZWNjYXJpLXRvLWxlYWQtbG91aXMtdnVpdHRvbi1pbi1sdm1oLW1hbmFnZW1lbnQtc2h1ZmZsZdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Beccari, who is 55, previously played professional soccer, worked for consumer goods company Benckiser, dairy and food distributor Parmalat and consumer goods firm Henkel before joining LVMH in 2006 as executive vice president of marketing and communications for Louis Vuitton. He became chairman and CEO of Fendi in 2012, before joining Dior. The former professional athlete tells his teams that the French idiom “l’important c’est de participer”(it’s the taking part that counts”) isn’t quite right. Instead he prefers “l’important, c’est de gagner” (“what matters is to win”).

“Pietro Beccari has done an exceptional job at Christian Dior over the past five years,” Bernard Arnault said. “His leadership has accelerated the appeal and success of this iconic maison. Monsieur Dior’s values of elegance and his innovative spirit have been given fresh intensity, supported by very talented designers. The reinvention of the historical boutique at 30 Montaigne is emblematic of this momentum. I am sure Pietro will lead Louis Vuitton to the next level of success and desirability.”

In his 10-year tenure at Louis Vuitton, Burke, who is 65 and has worked with Arnault for decades, managed to nearly triple the size of the brand. In 2013, sales were €7.1 billion. In 2022, they were €20.6 billion, according to HSBC estimates. Louis Vuitton is the world’s largest luxury house but Burke managed to preserve it from the risk of ubiquity for such a megabrand. His strategy involved a thoughtful segmentation, with a wide offer, from sneakers to €25,000 handbags in exotic skins. He also innovated by hiring two separate designers for women’s and men’s wear, and spotted design talents like Virgil Abloh and most recently KidSuper founder Colm Dillane.

“I want to extend my warmest thanks to Michael Burke, who has led the extraordinary success of Louis Vuitton during the past 10 years,” said Bernard Arnault. “He has done a tremendous job developing this exceptional maison. He has extended Louis Vuitton’s lead over competitors and promoted the heritage of Louis Vuitton while anchoring it in modernity. [...] In addition to Louis Vuitton, he has overseen the successful integration of Tiffany within the LVMH Group.”

Both Beccari and Arnault will have to navigate a challenging environment in the short term, including in the US, which has been a recent driver of growth for luxury. On the US market, HSBC global head of consumer and retail research Erwan Rambourg wrote a note in December: “We see signs that very high-end luxury is resilient (think Chanel), but we see reasons for the aspirational price-point segment of some brands (notably Louis Vuitton) suffering over the short term. Even Dior, a brand that has quadrupled its sales over the past four years, according to our estimates, is likely to see sales start to slow in the US.” Louis Vuitton and Christian Dior Couture represented 26 per cent and 11 per cent of LVMH’s sales in 2022 respectively, according to HSBC estimates. Louis Vuitton accounted for 49 per cent of the group EBIT."
"LVMH names new Louis Vuitton CEO, Arnault taps daughter for Dior | Mint - Mint","Tue, 17 Jan 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxpdmVtaW50LmNvbS9jb21wYW5pZXMvbmV3cy9sdm1oLXNodWZmbGVzLWxlYWRlcnNoaXAtYXQtbG91aXMtdnVpdHRvbi1kaW9yLTExNjczNDQwMjg5ODIwLmh0bWzSAW5odHRwczovL3d3dy5saXZlbWludC5jb20vY29tcGFuaWVzL25ld3MvbHZtaC1zaHVmZmxlcy1sZWFkZXJzaGlwLWF0LWxvdWlzLXZ1aXR0b24tZGlvci9hbXAtMTE2NzM0NDAyODk4MjAuaHRtbA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE, Europe’s most valuable company, is embarking on one of its biggest management shake-ups in years, elevating Pietro Beccari to lead Louis Vuitton and tapping Delphine Arnault, daughter of Chief Executive Bernard Arnault, to run Christian Dior.

The changes announced Wednesday, effective Feb. 1, involve two of the luxury giant’s largest brands and some of its best-known managers. Both Louis Vuitton and Dior have been on a tear, most recently riding a postpandemic boom in luxury spending that so far has shown little sign of easing.

LVMH emerged from the pandemic as Europe’s largest company by market value, far ahead of the continent’s industrial stalwarts such as Shell PLC, Airbus SE and Volkswagen AG. Mr. Arnault, meanwhile, has recently usurped Elon Musk as the world’s richest person.

This year, loosened Covid-19 restrictions in China—one of the luxury industry’s biggest markets—have further boosted LVMH’s shares, which rose as much as 2% on Wednesday to hit a record intraday high, bringing year-to-date gains to 13%.

In taking the helm of Louis Vuitton, Mr. Beccari succeeds Michael Burke, who has led the fashion brand for a decade. Mr. Burke is one of the most trusted lieutenants of Mr. Arnault—LVMH’s CEO and controlling shareholder—having worked with him since the 1980s. LVMH said Mr. Burke, 66 years old, would now assume new duties, reporting directly to Mr. Arnault.

Mr. Beccari currently leads Dior, where he will be succeeded by Delphine Arnault, the eldest of Mr. Arnault’s five children.

The management changes mark a homecoming of sorts for Ms. Arnault, who worked for 12 years at Dior before joining Louis Vuitton as No. 2 in 2013. It is also the first time she takes on a CEO job at one of LVMH’s brands. At Louis Vuitton, Ms. Arnault was in charge of all product-related activities. She was recently responsible for a collaboration between the brand and Japanese artist Yayoi Kusama for a major new collection.

Ms. Arnault’s elevation will be closely watched in Paris business circles, where monitoring the progress of Mr. Arnault’s children with a view to potential succession is a favorite pastime. All of Mr. Arnault’s children have responsibilities at the luxury conglomerate that he has built over decades. Last month, Mr. Arnault named his eldest son, Antoine Arnault, CEO of the family holding company that owns the bulk of the family’s stake in LVMH.

The challenge for both Ms. Arnault and Mr. Beccari will be to keep the growth humming at Louis Vuitton and Dior as the global economy confronts challenges ranging from high inflation to Covid-related disruption in China and the war in Ukraine. In November, consulting firm Bain & Co. forecast that sales of personal luxury goods would rise between 3% and 8% in 2023, a sharp slowdown on last year’s growth that it estimated would be 22%.

The strength of Louis Vuitton and Dior, which in recent years have both proved popular with shoppers regardless of the fashion trends of the day, have been instrumental in helping LVMH become the world’s biggest purveyor of luxury goods, extending its lead over rivals such as Gucci-owner Kering SA and Cie. Financière Richemont SA, which owns Cartier.

In returning to Louis Vuitton, Mr. Beccari rejoins a leather-goods juggernaut that he first joined in 2006. In recent years, the Italian executive has overseen remarkable growth at Dior, where analysts estimate revenue has more than tripled over the past five years. At Dior, Mr. Beccari’s achievements include the opening of a huge new flagship store in Paris’s luxury shopping district that extends over five levels.

Mr. Beccari has also become known for pushing an array of high-visibility projects around the globe. Recent examples include a fashion show last month in front of Egypt’s ancient Giza pyramids as well as a major partnership with Harrod’s, the luxury British department store, for the Christmas season.

Mr. Beccari now takes responsibility for LVMH’s biggest brand. LVMH doesn’t disclose revenue for individual brands, though analysts at Citi estimate that revenue at Louis Vuitton rose to 21.8 billion euros, equivalent to $23.40 billion, last year. “Vuitton has become one of the strongest and most resilient luxury brands,"" they said Wednesday.

That rise has come under the leadership of Mr. Burke, whose tenure at Louis Vuitton included the brand’s much-hyped collaboration with cult streetwear brand Supreme in 2017 as well as tapping the late Virgil Abloh as menswear artistic director the following year.

On Wednesday, Mr. Arnault credited Mr. Burke with extending Louis Vuitton’s lead over its competitors and promoting the brand’s heritage while anchoring it in modernity.

A dual French-U.S. citizen, Mr. Burke has worked for Mr. Arnault since graduating from business school, initially on real-estate investments in the U.S. before taking the helm of Christian Dior USA in 1986.

He also oversaw the integration of U.S. jeweler Tiffany’s into LVMH. As part of the organizational changes announced on Wednesday, Tiffany’s—which LVMH bought for more than $15 billion in 2021—will now be housed in the group’s watches & jewelry division.

Luxury's First €20 Billion Brand | BoF - The Business of Fashion,"Sun, 22 Jan 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzb2ZmYXNoaW9uLmNvbS9icmllZmluZ3MvbHV4dXJ5L2x1eHVyeXMtZmlyc3QtMjAtYmlsbGlvbi1icmFuZC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Since December, LVMH has announced new CEOs for Louis Vuitton, Dior and the family holding company that controls the world’s largest luxury conglomerate itself. It has installed a mix of next-generation Arnaults and industry veterans in key roles. And there may be more change to come, as some of the group’s most trusted managers approach retirement.

The market took this month’s reshuffle in stride. Last week, shares hit a record high.

It’s not hard to see why investors are confident in LVMH’s future. On Thursday, LVMH will report its 2022 results. While it typically doesn’t break out individual brands’ sales, the group’s financials should give analysts confidence to declare LVMH flagship Louis Vuitton luxury’s first brand to record €20 billion in annual sales (HSBC and others have previously estimated 2022 sales crossed that threshold). A looming recession, China’s Covid outbreak and the lack of a permanent menswear designer don’t seem to have hurt the brand much at all (though it’s worth keeping in mind that LVMH shares also started last year at an all-time high, only to tumble amid doubts about whether wealthy consumers would keep up their pandemic-era spending).

For now at least, the challenges facing new Louis Vuitton CEO Pietro Beccari are mainly about how to grow a brand that’s already operating at an unprecedented scale. As BoF’s Robert Williams wrote shortly after his appointment, “shock and awe” marketing tactics helped get Vuitton where it is today, but it’s no longer the only brand staging large-scale travelling shows or tapping renowned artists to create installations for its stores. A €20 billion brand can’t be niche, but going too broad carries risks of its own.

For the first time since the pandemic, LVMH executives will meet financial analysts in person after releasing their earnings. The event has typically served as a forum for Bernard Arnault to articulate his vision for the group in the coming year. If he speaks he’ll have plenty of past accomplishments to brag about, but we’ll be more interested in hearing about what’s coming next.

Pietro Beccari to Become CEO of Louis Vuitton as Part of LVMH Shake-up - WWD,"Wed, 11 Jan 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3dkLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy1uZXdzL2h1bWFuLXJlc291cmNlcy92dWl0dG9uLWNlby1uZXctZGlvci1sdm1oLW1hbmFnZW1lbnQtY2hhbmdlcy0xMjM1NDQ0MzU2L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"“We see no clouds on the LVMH horizon,” a sanguine Luca Solca, senior research analyst, global luxury goods at Bernstein, opined on Wednesday after leadership changes shook the top of Louis Vuitton and Dior, the French luxury group’s flagship fashion houses.

Echoing other observers, Solca characterized the appointment of Dior head Pietro Beccari as chairman and chief executive officer of Louis Vuitton as “very good news,” and Delphine Arnault’s ascension as Beccari’s successor as “a step forward for her.”

“We believe this is just what LV needed, in order to open a new growth chapter,” Solca added.

HSBC analyst Erwan Rambourg, global head of consumer and retail research, lauded Arnault’s “great track record on product at Louis Vuitton” and her history at Dior “so the move seems logical.”

The dynamo behind Dior’s stupendous growth trajectory since 2018, Beccari is to succeed Michael Burke, 66, who is bowing out of Vuitton after a stellar 10-year tenure to “take up new responsibilities, reporting directly to Bernard Arnault,” LVMH said.

Arnault is chairman and CEO of LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, and also head of Financière Agache, the main family holding company.

In addition, Charles Delapalme, executive vice president of Christian Dior Couture in charge of commercial activities since 2018, has been elevated to managing director of Christian Dior Couture.

Finally, LVMH said it would further widen the purview of Stéphane Bianchi, chairman and CEO of the watches and jewelry division, to include Tiffany & Co. and Repossi.

All the changes are effective Feb. 1, and the management shuffle at LVMH could trigger other creative and executive shifts at the vast conglomerate, whose fashion holdings include Fendi, Givenchy, Loewe and Celine, among others.

For starters, Beccari will need to fill Delphine Arnault’s position. She was second-in-command to Burke.

Wednesday’s announcement caps off a flurry of major personnel changes at some of Europe’s largest luxury players in recent months, with Gucci parting ways with its star creative director Alessandro Michele, and Prada bringing on former LVMH executive Andrea Guerra to succeed Patrizio Bertelli as CEO.

It marks a homecoming for Delphine Arnault, who was Dior’s deputy general manager from 2008 until 2013, when she moved over to Vuitton. Arnault, the eldest of Bernard Arnault’s five children, arrived at a time when Burke had initiated an upscaling drive at Vuitton and could leverage her expertise in accessories and high-end leather goods.

It also significantly raises the profile of Arnault, who takes on her first CEO role at one of the most visible and treasured fashion houses in the LVMH empire. Until now, Arnault has been largely a behind-the-scenes power player in her role as Vuitton’s executive vice president in charge of supervising all of its product-related activities.

For example, she orchestrated Vuitton’s mega collaboration with Japanese artist Yayoi Kusama, unfurling throughout the first half of this year and touching all categories of the business.

Commenting on these “significant organizational changes,” Bernard Arnault characterized his daughter’s arrival as chairman and CEO of Christian Dior Couture as “another milestone in a career journey in fashion and leather goods defined by excellence.”

Speaking of her tenure at Vuitton, he said the desirability of products “advanced significantly, enabling the brand to regularly set new sales records. Her keen insights and incomparable experience will be decisive assets in driving the ongoing development of Christian Dior.”

The driving force behind the LVMH Prize, marking its 10th anniversary in 2023, Arnault is known for having a strong rapport with designers and fine artists. Warm in demeanor, but with a steely determination, she delights in nurturing the creative sparks that fuel the industry, following design ideas through multiple steps until they reach the sales floor.

Her promotion comes less than a month after her eldest brother Antoine Arnault was appointed CEO of holding company Christian Dior SE, which controls LVMH, and vice chairman of its board. That move further locked in family control over the luxury empire, with Antoine Arnault taking on the new title in addition to his roles as CEO of Berluti, chairman of Loro Piana and head of communication, image and environment at LVMH.

Both siblings are also on the board of LVMH.

Wednesday’s announcement marks a return to Vuitton for Beccari, who joined the leather goods powerhouse from consumer products giant Henkel in 2006, initially as director of strategy and marketing coordination, ultimately taking on responsibility for business units including ready-to-wear and accessories and rising to executive vice president.

It also marks the second time Beccari has succeeded Burke. In 2012, Beccari became chairman and CEO of Fendi after Burke took the management helm of Bulgari SpA. Delphine Arnault also succeeds Beccari for the second time in her career: She had taken over Beccari’s responsibilities when she arrived at Vuitton, and now takes his place at Dior.

The internal movement is signature LVMH, which stockpiles management talent, promotes from within and grooms future leaders.

“We view these management changes as positive for both the Louis Vuitton and Dior brands, and they underline the bench strength and long-term custodian approach at LVMH which we see as one of the group’s core competitive advantages,” RBC Europe said in a research note Wednesday morning. “It also reflects ongoing leadership transition within the Arnault family.”

Shares in LVMH gained 2.1 percent Wednesday on the news, rising to 772.30 euros on the Paris Bourse.

“Pietro Beccari has done wonders at both Fendi and Dior — if at Louis Vuitton he manages to be only half as successful as he has been in the past 10 years, Louis Vuitton will fly to new and unprecedented heights,” Bernstein’s Solca wrote.

HSBC’s Rambourg estimates that Beccari quadrupled Dior’s sales to 8.8 billion euros — and with only 30 percent space expansion.

“In our view, this is a logical choice to run the largest luxury brand on the planet considering his track record,” the analyst told WWD. “We believe some reinvestments and large projects could be expected.”

He noted the latter could include transforming Vuitton’s Paris headquarters into a “hotel/museum/mega flagship and a lot more,” plus collaborations, and a “product diversification push.”

A man of action, and bold projects, Beccari’s crowning achievement at Dior was the overhaul of its historic Avenue Montaigne boutique, vastly expanded and transformed into a brand temple like no other, spanning a restaurant, pastry café, leafy atriums, a private apartment for VIP clients that gives them the full run of the place, and La Galerie de Dior, the biggest permanent exhibition space dedicated to fashion in the hands of a private house.

A driven, audacious and exacting executive, Beccari also orchestrated high-visibility events around the world for Dior at a blistering pace. In recent weeks alone, the brand unveiled a wondrous gingerbread-wrapped Harrods in London for Christmas, a dramatic men’s show in front of the Great Pyramids of Egypt, and the sprawling “Christian Dior: Designer of Dreams” exhibition at the Museum of Contemporary Art Tokyo. Named WWD’s Newsmaker of the Year in 2022, Beccari is prized for his entrepreneurial daring, marketing savvy and his flair for innovation and grand gestures.

“If you don’t take risks, you have no reward,” he told WWD in an interview last month. “I often say to my teams, ‘If you have everything under control, you’re not going fast enough.’”

In Wednesday’s statement on the management change, Bernard Arnault lauded Beccari for doing “an exceptional job” at Christian Dior over the past five years.

“His leadership has accelerated the appeal and success of this iconic maison. Monsieur Dior’s values of elegance and his innovative spirit have been given fresh intensity, supported by very talented designers. The reinvention of the historical boutique at 30 Montaigne is emblematic of this momentum. I am sure Pietro will lead Louis Vuitton to the next level of success and desirability.”

A native of Parma, Italy, Beccari once played soccer professionally and started his career in international marketing at consumer products giant Reckitt Benckiser in Milan. He went on to work for Parmalat in New York for a couple of years before joining Henkel in Germany, where he worked for 10 years.

Meanwhile, Burke bows out of Vuitton following a peerless, creative and widely admired tenure that lifted the group’s biggest and most profitable brand to new heights. He executed a strategy that brought new verve to multiple product categories, with leather Capucines bags now outselling those in monogram canvas, high jewelry humming, and bespoke trunks selling like hotcakes — and to people who often become the brand’s best customers.

He also built rtw into a multibillion-euro business, and one generating high levels of profitability in the range of 30 percent — flying in the face of assumptions that fashion is a loss-leading image vehicle to sell handbags.

He masterminded a collaboration between Vuitton and Supreme in 2017 that ignited the luxury streetwear trend, overhauled Vuitton’s store network by treating each unit as a bespoke project, and plunged the brand into perfume as an in-house project with a dedicated nose and flower domain.

Burke’s masterstroke was recruiting Virgil Abloh, founder of Off-White, as Vuitton’s artistic director of menswear in 2018, which brought the house buzz, cultural currency and a mold-breaking creative figure whose impact reverberates still. Vuitton has yet to name a successor following Abloh’s death in November 2021 at age 41.

The executive also brought in Francesca Amfitheatrof as Vuitton’s artistic director of watches and jewelry, while nurturing his strong rapport with star designer Nicolas Ghesquière, the brand’s artistic director of women’s collections for the past decade.

According to market sources, Vuitton’s revenues tripled during Burke’s tenure to exceed 21 billion euros, with profitability leaping fourfold.

While most management changes occur when businesses falter or stall, LVMH titan Bernard Arnault dares to shake things up when the going is good, with both LVMH and Dior logging strong growth in recent years.

LVMH’s fashion and leather goods division grew 24 percent in the third quarter of 2022, with Louis Vuitton and Christian Dior Couture continuing to shine.

“I want to extend my warmest thanks to Michael Burke, who has led the extraordinary success of Louis Vuitton during the past 10 years,” Bernard Arnault commented. “He has done a tremendous job developing this exceptional maison. He has extended Louis Vuitton’s lead over competitors and promoted the heritage of Louis Vuitton while anchoring it in modernity. The cultural strength of Louis Vuitton has been fully affirmed. Michael attracted the most outstanding designers and professional teams and helped them [assimilate] to the world of Vuitton.”

Insiders say Burke had an uncanny knack for making businesspeople fall in love with beautiful products — and creative types with business success.

Bernard Arnault also noted that Burke oversaw “the successful integration of Tiffany within the LVMH Group. I am delighted that Michael will continue, by my side, to share his experience and talent for the benefit of our companies.”

It is understood that Burke recognized an ideal moment to relinquish the operational reins at Vuitton, clearing the way for the group to promote younger executives and write new chapters at the heritage houses. Beccari is 55, and Delphine Arnault, 47.

He is expected to remain on the LVMH executive committee.

Born in the French Alps, Burke grew up in the U.S., went to high school in Germany and then enrolled in business school in Lille, France.

After graduating in 1980 with a master of business administration, he moved to the U.S. to work full-time for Arnault, initially on residential real estate at various family holdings before joining Christian Dior in the U.S. in 1986.

A key protégé of Arnault’s, and one of his most trusted deputies, Burke next served as president and CEO of Louis Vuitton North America from 1993 until 1997, when he returned to Paris as Dior’s executive vice president. He would go on to become worldwide managing director of Christian Dior Couture before joining Fendi as CEO in 2003 for nearly a decade.

A charismatic, cerebral and well-rounded executive with a fun-loving streak, Burke is renowned for his impeccable instincts, ability to motivate teams, get the best out of creative types, and manage complexity. He was presented with the WWD Honor for Creative Leadership last year.

Burke also masterminded the 2013 deal that saw LVMH acquire a majority stake in Loro Piana for 2 billion euros, adding a purveyor of luxurious, classic-tinged apparel to the group’s stable of marquee fashion houses.

Delapalme is a 17-year veteran of the group, having joined Vuitton in retail and regional roles before moving over to Fendi with retail, wholesale and operational responsibilities. He has been at Dior since 2018.

Bernard Arnault noted that Delapalme made a “significant contribution” to the growth of the Dior fashion house “thanks to his commercial expertise and remarkable strategic vision. Charles will work closely with Delphine to write a new chapter in the extraordinary history of Maison Christian Dior.”

Bianchi joined LVMH in 2018 from the Yves Rocher Group and his remit has rapidly expanded, with Bulgari added to the brands he oversees in 2021, when he also became a member of the LVMH executive committee.

Arnault called the integration of Tiffany into the watches and jewelry division “a natural step following the company’s successful integration within the LVMH Group. Stéphane Bianchi’s leadership skills, his understanding of products and markets, and his organizational acumen have enabled the maisons in the division to achieve remarkable results under his management. This includes the successful revamping of Tag Heuer, the acceleration of Chaumet, Fred and Zenith, along with continued excellent performance by Hublot and Bulgari. Stéphane will further heighten the unique appeal of each of these maisons while developing effective synergies among them.”

A graduate of EDHEC Business School in Lille, where Burke also studied, and the London School of Economics, Delphine Arnault started her career at consulting firm McKinsey.

She began at LVMH by heading business development at John Galliano for a year before moving over to Dior as commercial director in 2001. She has served as a director for many other group brands, and outside firms, including Dior SE, Gagosian, Ferrari and Phoebe Philo Ltd. Plc.

All of Bernard Arnault’s children now work within the group: Alexandre Arnault as executive vice president, product and communications at Tiffany; Frédéric Arnault as CEO of Tag Heuer, and Jean Arnault as director of marketing and development for Louis Vuitton. Last July, the Financière Agache holding was converted into a limited joint-stock partnership, a move designed to hand control of the entity to his five children. Last April, LVMH shareholders voted 81.6 percent in favor of a resolution to extend to 80 the age limit for its longtime chairman and CEO, Bernard Arnault, who is 73. Previously, the company’s bylaws fixed 75 as the age limit for serving as CEO."
"LVMH names new Louis Vuitton CEO, puts Arnault daughter in charge of Dior - Euronews","Wed, 11 Jan 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiOGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmV1cm9uZXdzLmNvbS9uZXh0LzIwMjMvMDEvMTEvbHZtaC1tYW5hZ2VtZW500gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"By Mimosa Spencer

PARIS - LVMH Chairman and CEO Bernard Arnault has reshuffled top management at his luxury goods empire, tightening his family's grip with the appointment of his daughter Delphine to lead Christian Dior, and naming a new boss for Louis Vuitton.

Pietro Beccari, who has been the head of Dior since 2018, is moving to replace long-time Louis Vuitton CEO Michael Burke, 65.

""Both are well respected; logical promotions within the group,"" said Credit Suisse analyst Natasha Brilliant.

Shares in LVMH, Europe's most valuable company at about 380 billion euros ($408 billion), rose as much as 2% to hit new highs. Shares in luxury companies have been boosted recently by the easing of COVID-19 restrictions in China, a key market.

Delphine Arnault, 47, has worked at Louis Vuitton for the past decade alongside Burke and previously spent a dozen years at Dior.

Burke, who is Bernard Arnault's longest-serving lieutenant and has also been chairman of jewellery label Tiffany, will continue to work alongside the Arnault senior, the company said in a statement, without detailing his new role.

One of the fashion industry's most influential executives, Burke oversaw soaring growth at Louis Vuitton, the world's largest luxury label, playing a key role for example in elevating street styles to the realm of luxury in recent years.

Beccari, meanwhile, who also previously led LVMH-owned label Fendi, increased sales at Christian Dior three-fold to 6.6 billion euros during his tenure, according to estimates from Citi. LVMH does not provide a breakdown of annual sales of its brands.

RESORT STORES, STAR-STUDDED FASHION SHOWS

Beccari pushed the label into new products, including beach accessories such as surfboards and hammocks, bringing them closer to clients by setting up temporary retail outlets in resort locations including Mykonos, Greece, and Santa Barbara, California.

The executive steered a massive overhaul of the label's historic Avenue Montaigne address in Paris, transforming it into a hulking flagship with restaurants and a museum, reviving foot traffic in the neighbourhood.

Dior catwalk presentations in Paris, which are attended by global stars such as K-pop singer Jisoo and Rihanna, draw crowds of screaming fans, and the brand lit up social networks with a show from menswear designer Kim Jones in Egypt last month, with the pyramids serving as a backdrop.

Bernard Arnault is often spotted in the front row, flanked by his children.

""Succession planning in strategic roles has been instrumental to the success of LVMH's key brands over the past 20 years, hence today's moves are significant,"" said Thomas Chauvet, analyst with Citi.

SUCCESSION PLANS

The announced changes, which come into effect in February, follow the recent appointment of Antoine Arnault, Bernard Arnault's eldest son, to head the family's holding company.

The tightening of the family's hold on its empire also comes amid a wave of high-profile successions in other fashion companies in Europe, including at Prada and Zara owner Inditex.

Bernard Arnault, 73, has shown no signs he plans to step down soon and the company last year raised the maximum age of its CEO to 80 from 75.

All of his children hold management positions at brands in the group, carefully groomed by senior executives as they move up the ranks.

Of the five, Delpine Arnault has been most involved in fashion, as head of the group's fashion prize for upcoming designers.

The luxury giant unveiled watches from Tag Heuer, Hublot, Zenith and more.

Hublot/Tag Heuer

Before the world can marvel at the glory of rare, limited-edition timepieces on display at Watches and Wonders Geneva, there’s another event that heralds the start of a new year in horology: LVMH Watch Week, which displays the latest and greatest from the stable of watchmakers owned by the luxury house.

From a sleek Tag Heuer smartwatch to colorful updates of classic Hublot silhouettes, LVMH Watch Week is but one sign of great things to come for watch enthusiasts, collectors and those who simply like to admire stellar designs from afar.

For our money’s worth, these are the coolest watches from LVMH Watch Week 2023–choose wisely.

Hublot Classic Fusion Original

Hublot

A true 1980s original is updated here for today’s modern man, yet retains the soul and innovation that made it, well, an original: A gold case on a rubber strap defies convention. It’s now available in yellow gold, ceramic and titanium. Starting at $8,300

Zenith Defy Skyline Skeleton

Zenith

The Zenith Defy line of watches is nothing if not intricate and boundary-pushing, and this watch is heralded as the centerpiece of Zenith’s releases for LVMH Watch Week. Of note, it boasts a new new El Primero 3620 SK movement for even greater accuracy than one expects from Zenith. $11,000

Tag Heuer Connected Calibre E4 42mm in Black Titanium

Tag Heuer

The world of smartwatches has morphed into yet another sphere for impressive, streamlined luxury design, and Tag Heuer seems to be pushing to the front of the queue, so to speak, in the category. The biggest change here is simple but effective: A slimming-down of the case diameter to 42mm from 45mm in other Connected Calibre editions. Look for it in mid-February. $2,350

Hublot Spirit of Big Bang Carbon Blue

Hublot

Hublot keeps improving upon the much-loved Hublot Big Bang line with an entry that follows on the heels of previous Spirit of Big Bang releases. The eye-catching baby blue rubber strap and intricate white dial are the star of the show, as is the (as-yet-unconfirmed) price tag. About $100,000

Tag Heuer Aquaracer Professional 200 Solargraph

Tag Heuer

For those who favor the sophistication yet rugged appeal of a dive watch as opposed to one of Tag Heuer’s smartwatch releases, keep a close eye on the Aquaracer Solargraph. This watch builds off last year’s Aquaracer Solargraph announcement at Watches and Wonders, boasting a TH50-00 solar movement. $3,050"
"LVMH, L’Oreal and Shiseido Are All Vying to Buy a Stake in Aesop - Robb Report","Mon, 30 Jan 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vcm9iYnJlcG9ydC5jb20vc3R5bGUvZ3Jvb21pbmcvbHZtaC1sb3JlYWwtdG9wLXN1aXRvcnMtYWVzb3Atc3Rha2UtMTIzNDgwMTgyNS_SAVlodHRwczovL3JvYmJyZXBvcnQuY29tL3N0eWxlL2dyb29taW5nL2x2bWgtbG9yZWFsLXRvcC1zdWl0b3JzLWFlc29wLXN0YWtlLTEyMzQ4MDE4MjUvYW1wLw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Looks like luxury skincare is in with deep-pocketed investors.

Fashion heavyweight LMVH and beauty-industry leader L’Oreal are now the two top names looking to potentially acquire a stake in Australian cosmetics company Aesop, Bloomberg reports. The brand, which may be valued at $2 billion or more, is renowned for its luxe skin, body and hair care, as well as home fragrances. Shiseido, a Japanese beauty group, is also weighing placing a bid for the company, according to sources familiar with the matter.

In 2012, Brazilian cosmetics maker Natura & Co. agreed to buy a 65 percent stake in Emeis Holdings, which operates under the Aseop brand name in Australia, Asia, Europe and North America, for a whopping $71.6 million. Natura’s deal to acquire the company was officially completed in 2016. Fast forward to 2022, when Natura began working with Bank of America Corp. and Morgan Stanley to sell a stake in the skincare brand, which seemingly turned heads.

As of Monday, Bloomberg reports that shares in Natura were trading 13 percent higher at 10:23 am in São Paulo, giving the company a high-market value of $3.9 billion (20.1 billion reais). Remaining anyonomous, people familiar with the matter claim deliberations are currently ongoing, with no guarantees that they will result in any offers for a stake in Aesop.

WATCH

Tough markets for new listings in 2022 are part of the reason why Natura leaned toward a stake sale at the time. Bloomberg also reports that the move is being orchestrated by Fabio Barbosa, who took over as Natura CEO last year. According to a company filing in October, the brand aimed to unlock value at Aesop by possibly launching an IPO or a spinoff of the business, among other ideas. According to e-commerce platform Oberlo, the global beauty industry market size is set to be worth a staggering $571.1 billion in 2023.

With that said, selling a stake to LVMH or L’Oreal—both of which manage massive beauty brands from Dior to Maybelline—may do much more than just unlocking Aesop’s potential."
Zenith DEFY Timepieces Release LVMH Watch Week - HYPEBEAST,"Tue, 10 Jan 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vaHlwZWJlYXN0LmNvbS8yMDIzLzEvemVuaXRoLWRlZnktc2t5bGluZS1za2VsZXRvbi1za3lsaW5lLTM2bW0tZXh0cmVtZS1nbGFjaWVyLWx2bWgtd2F0Y2gtd2Vlay1yZWxlYXNlLWluZm_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"This year’s LVMH Watch Week has begun. Taking place in Singapore for the first time ever, a handful of luxury timepieces will be released over the course of the event. To start, Zenith unveils three timepieces from its prominent DEFY series, comprising the DEFY Skyline Skeleton, DEFY Skyline 36mm, and the DEFY Extreme Glacier.

DEFY Skyline Skeleton

As the central launch of LVMH Watch Week, the DEFY Skyline Skeleton is the first of its kind to be fitted with a 1/10th of a second indicator. Its design draws inspiration from modern cityscapes and seamlessly integrates the El Primero automatic open-worked movement with the model’s signature star-shaped open dial. Honoring the robustness and durability of its predecessors, the piece features a 41mm stainless steel case with sharply defined edges, along with a faceted bezel that references early DEFY timepieces. Priced at $11,000 USD, the DEFY Skyline Skeleton comes on a satin-brushed steel bracelet, with additional rubber straps available in blue or black.

DEFY Skyline 36mm

Zenith updates the iconic DEFY Skyline watch in a slimmer 36mm case size, while also retaining the original models’ defining characteristics — from the octagonal steel case, faceted bezel, and sunburst-patterned dial complete with the watchmaker’s emblematic four-pointed star. Available in pink, blue, and green in a regular or diamond-set bezel.

DEFY Extreme Glacier

A brand new iteration of Zenith’s DEFY Extreme model, the Glacier is rendered in an icy palette, incorporated with Chalcedony gemstones that emulate the hues of the boundless Arctic horizon. Given the natures of gemstones, every piece is unique with its own colors and striations, making no two piece the same. Retailing for $26,100 USD, the DEFY Extreme Glacier is powered by the El Primero 21 Calibre, which provides it with 50 hours of power reserve.

All three models will be available at Zenith boutiques and authorized retailers worldwide. For more information, head over to Zenith’s official website.

Elsewhere in watches, Leica’s L1 and L2 timepieces are now available at its Hong Kong Flagship."
LVMH reports record profits following boost to marketing spend - Marketing Week,"Fri, 27 Jan 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hcmtldGluZ3dlZWsuY29tL2x2bWgtcmVjb3JkLXByb2ZpdHMtYm9vc3QtbWFya2V0aW5nL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Viewed by analysts as a bellwether for the luxury market, LVMH’s earnings for 2022 suggest the most affluent consumers are willing to continue spending through inflation.

Luxury goods giant LVMH has reported record revenue and profits for the second year in a row, after increasing advertising and promotional spend by 25%.

Revenue for 2022 reached €79bn (£69.4bn), while profit from recurring operations hit €21bn (£18.5bn), both up 23% compared to 2021. Sales rose 9% in the final three months of the year alone.

Total marketing and selling costs jumped 26% to €28.2m (£24.7m), amounting to 35.6% of revenue. This marks a 0.8 percentage point increase compared to the previous year. According to LVMH, the increase was largely a result of “higher communications investments” and the development of retail networks.

For analysts, LVMH’s earnings are looked at as a bellwether for the luxury market. Louise Deglise-Favre, apparel analyst at GlobalData, says the results “clearly” illustrate that “luxury shoppers’ wallets remain unaffected by high inflation and mounting living costs”.

All business groups within the firm achieved notable revenue growth over the year, with the fashion and leather goods division setting a new record as revenue grew 20%. The business hailed the role marketing played for a number of its key brands, including Berluti and Celine in fashion, Parfums Christian Dior and Parfums Givenchy in perfumes and cosmetics, and Chandon, Hennessy and Belvedere in wines and spirits.

Flagship designer label Louis Vuitton performed especially well, with revenue surpassing €20bn (£17.59bn) for the first time.

Meanwhile, LVMH-owned beauty retailer Sephora also enjoyed a “record performance”. The retailer’s online launch in the UK last year attracted so many visitors that the website crashed, and there are plans to open a physical store in Westfield London within the next few months.

According to chairman and CEO Bernard Arnault, the business’s performance is evidence of the “exceptional appeal” of its brands and their ability to “create desire” amid challenging economic circumstances around the world.

“Our growth strategy, based on the complementary nature of our activities, as well as their geographic diversity, encourages innovation and the quality of our creations, the excellence of their distribution, and adds a cultural and historical dimension thanks to the heritage of our Maisons,” he says.

“We approach 2023 with confidence but remain vigilant due to current uncertainties. We count on the desirability of our Maisons and the agility of our teams to further strengthen our lead in the global luxury market.”‘Welcome to new luxury’: Why Frasers Group is ‘rewriting’ the Flannels brand

For many consumers navigating the ongoing cost of living crisis, luxury purchases will be the last thing on their minds. Kantar data shared with Marketing Week last year revealed luxury to be the category consumers most planned to cut back on.

However, brands in the sector already capture only a small segment of the most affluent consumers, who are more insulated from the storm of the macroeconomic environment. Indeed, experts have warned of a “two-tier” economy emerging as a result of inflation, with the least affluent disproportionately impacted.

According to the most recent forecasts from Retail Economics’ cost of living tracker, produced in collaboration with HyperJar, the discretionary income of the UK’s least affluent households fell by 17.2% (£83) in November 2022 compared to the year prior. Those on middling incomes took a 9.6% hit, averaging at a loss of £104, while the most affluent households actually saw their discretionary incomes increase, up 0.6% (£28)."
