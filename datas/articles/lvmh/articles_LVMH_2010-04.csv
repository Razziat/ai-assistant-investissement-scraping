Luxury goods brand LVMH sees sales soar - The Guardian,"Tue, 13 Apr 2010 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy8yMDEwL2Fwci8xMy9sdXh1cnktZ29vZHMtYnJhbmQtbHZtaC1zYWxlcy1zb2Fy0gFTaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAudGhlZ3VhcmRpYW4uY29tL2J1c2luZXNzLzIwMTAvYXByLzEzL2x1eHVyeS1nb29kcy1icmFuZC1sdm1oLXNhbGVzLXNvYXI?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"A surge in demand for expensive jewellery, clothes, perfume and champagne has sent sales soaring at luxury goods firm LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton.

LVMH saw revenues jump by 11% in the first three months of this year to €4.472bn (£3.9bn). Sales of its jewellery and watch brands, which includes Tag Heuer and Zenith, leapt by 33% compared with a year ago when the economic downturn hit consumer spending.

Wines and spirits, including big name brands such as Krug, and Moët & Chandon, rose by 18%.

The French luxury goods company said the results, which smashed City forecasts, showed that consumer demand in Europe and America had recovered following the financial crisis. Companies which sell LVMH's products have also embraced this wave of optimism, and are restocking their shelves.

""All of the business groups recorded double-digit organic revenue growth. Wines and spirits, and watches and jewellery, benefited from the end of destocking by distributors seen throughout 2009 and from a recovery in final consumer demand,"" said LVMH.

Sales of champagne had been badly hit by the economic downturn, which sated the financial sector's traditional thirst for bubbly. LVMH reported a ""renewal in orders from [champagne] distributors"", and also said there had been ""solid demand"" for its Hennessy cognac in Asia during the Chinese new year.

In perfume, where LVMH sells Christian Dior and Guerlain fragrances, sales were up 12%.

Dennis Weber, analyst at Evolution Securities, said that LVMH's results were much stronger than expected. He pointed out, though, that sales a year ago – when the financial sector was on its knees – were particularly weak.

""While these figures have been helped by easy comparables and re-stocking activity, the performance looks very impressive and of high quality, with final consumer demand picking up and Europe and the US also rebounding strongly, in addition to the continued good growth in Asia ex-Japan,"" Weber said.

LVMH warned, though, that the outlook was still challenging.

""Taking into account the uncertainty of the strength of the economic recovery, LVMH will continue to concentrate all of its efforts on the development of its formidable brands while maintaining strict cost management and selective investments,"" it said.

Shares in LVMH rose by nearly 2% on the Paris stock exchange. In London, drinks-maker Diageo also benefited, with its shares rising 1.8%."

Ultra-luxury hoteliers can expect new competition from French luxury goods company LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton, the Wall Street Journal reports.

LVMH also said it created LVMH Hotel Management to “oversee the group’s activities in the luxury hotel sector” and to “maximise the value of its brands,”.

Two new hotels, named Cheval Blanc after LVMH’s vineyard, are currently being built in Oman and Egypt and are proposed to open in 2012.

The Maison Cheval Blanc in Oman is on the 11 square- kilometer island of Al Sodah and includes 32 private villas, LVMH said.



The development in Egypt is on the private island of Amoun in Aswan and will include about 40 suites overlooking the Nile, the company said.

LVMH added that, “other projects are currently under study in exceptional destinations”.

The first LVMH Cheval Blanc hotel opened in French ski resort Courchevel in 2006, but this move marks the brand’s intentions to expand and develop the hospitality aspect of its business.

LVMH’s hotels will be a showcase for many of its brands. The Cheval Blanc in Courchevel has a Givenchy spa, and visitors can buy its Louis Vuitton and Dior merchandise in the hotel.

Like many top hotel operators, LVMH is limiting its exposure to the volatile hotel industry.

It won’t own the real estate or finance construction, but will instead run the resorts under management contract, a similar model to other high-end chains such as The Ritz-Carlton.
