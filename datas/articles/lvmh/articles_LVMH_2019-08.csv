EXCLUSIVE: LVMH to Establish Karl Lagerfeld Fashion Prize - WWD,"Wed, 28 Aug 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vd3dkLmNvbS9mZWF0dXJlL2x2bWgtdG8tZXN0YWJsaXNoLWthcmwtbGFnZXJmZWxkLWZhc2hpb24tcHJpemUtMTIwMzIyMzE3MS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"His legendary fashion career was ignited by an award. In his twilight years, he acted as a judge for the LVMH Prize for Young Fashion Designers, leaving most contenders starstruck.

And now he will be immortalized with a fashion prize in his name. LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton confirmed exclusively to WWD that its Special Prize will henceforth be named the Karl Lagerfeld Prize.

The first one is to be presented during the sixth edition of the contest on Sept. 4 at the Fondation Louis Vuitton.

“Karl Lagerfeld, creative director of the house of Fendi since 1965, was involved in the prize since its launch,” said Delphine Arnault, the force behind the high-profile design competition. “He was fully committed to it since Day One, transporting us with his enthusiasm and his energy, sharing with everyone, whether other jury members or candidates, his culture and his passion for fashion. We shall always cherish those precious moments.”

A key talent scout at the French luxury conglomerate and the number-two executive at its flagship Louis Vuitton brand, Arnault added that the Karl Lagerfeld Prize “naturally perpetuates the closeness we developed over the years and is a tribute to the man’s unique creative genius, to his ability to turn Paris into the fashion capital of the world.”

The winner of the Karl prize is to receive 150,000 euros and a one-year mentorship program provided by a dedicated LVMH team offering expertise in such areas as intellectual property, sourcing, production, distribution, image, communication and marketing.

Established in 2014 and unique in its online-only application process, the LVMH Prize is open for anyone under age 40 who has produced and sold at least two women’s or men’s ready-to-wear collections. Each year, three graduates from fashion schools are also recognized.

This year’s prize attracted more than 1,700 applicants from 100-plus countries.

The special Karl Lagerfeld Prize is bound to be coveted, given his stature as one of the most accomplished and admired fashion figures of the last century for his work at Chanel, Fendi, Chloé and his signature brand. He died last February at age 85.

Lagerfeld famously won an award from the International Wool Secretariat in 1954, as did Yves Saint Laurent, proving the potential and value of such early recognition.

The finalists for this year’s LVMH Prize — which comes with 300,000 euros plus a year of coaching from experts at family-controlled LVMH — are Anrealage, designed by Kunihiko Morinaga; Bethany Williams; Bode by Emily Adams Bode; Hed Mayner; Kenneth Ize; Phipps by Spencer Phipps; Stefan Cooke by Stefan Cooke and Jake Burt, and Thebe Magugu.

As usual, the jury is stacked with LVMH fashion stars including Dior‘s Maria Grazia Chiuri, Marc Jacobs, Louis Vuitton’s Nicolas Ghesquière, Loewe’s Jonathan Anderson, Berluti’s Kris Van Assche, and Givenchy’s Clare Waight Keller, as well as executives Delphine Arnault, Jean-Paul Claverie and Sidney Toledano.

In the past, the jury has handed special prizes to Hood by Air’s Shayne Oliver, Simon Porte Jacquemus and others. Grand prize winners have included Masayuki Ino of Doublet, Marine Serre, Grace Wales Bonner, and Marta Marques and Paulo Almeida of Marques’Almeida.

Lagerfeld took a grandfatherly approach to the young winners and contenders, most of whom were gobsmacked to interact with the fashion icon.

The inaugural prize went to Canadian designer Thomas Tait, whose submission to the judges included a booklet of delicate, X-ray-like etchings with a superhero undercurrent. “He’s an artist in a way,” Lagerfeld said of Tait at the time. “He sketches very well, and as you know, I like sketches.”

The new Karl prize is the latest LVMH-led tribute to the late designer, who had cultivated a close friendship with LVMH chairman and chief executive officer Bernard Arnault and his wife Helene, an acclaimed pianist. Most recently, LVMH-owned Fendi, where Lagerfeld had designed its furs and rtw since 1965, dedicated its fall 2019 couture show in Rome to him, parading 54 looks, one for each year of his celebrated tenure there, and some inspired by his past collections.

Meanwhile, the Karl Lagerfeld brand has enlisted a host of his famous friends and admirers, from Cara Delevingne and Kate Moss to Lewis Hamilton, to design white shirts that will displayed during Paris Fashion Week in September and then auctioned off for charity."

Just six months after Karl Lagerfeld passed away last winter at the age of 85, the LVMH Prize for Young Fashion Designers is honoring the legendary Chanel and Fendi designer with the Karl Lagerfeld Prize. An all-star jury—comprised of Loewe artistic director Jonathan Anderson, Berluti artistic director Kris Van Assche, Christian Dior Couture artistic director Maria Grazia Chiuri, Louis Vuitton artistic director Nicolas Ghesquière, Givenchy artistic director Clare Waight Keller, Louis Vuitton executive vice president Delphine Arnault, advisor to Bernard Arnault and director of Corporate Sponsorship at LVMH Jean-Paul Claverie, and chairman and chief executive officer of the Fashion Group Sidney Toledano—will select one emerging designer for the prize, which will be announced on September 4. The winner will be rewarded with 150,000 € ($166,282) plus a one-year mentorship provided by LVMH in various fields of expertise like sourcing, production and distribution, communication, image, marketing, and more.

“Karl Lagerfeld, creative director of the House of Fendi since 1965, was involved in the Prize since its launch,” said Arnault in a statement. “He was fully committed to it since day one, transporting us with his enthusiasm and his energy, sharing with everyone, whether other jury members or candidates, his culture and his passion for fashion. We shall always cherish those precious moments. The Karl Lagerfeld Prize naturally perpetuates the closeness we developed over the years and is a tribute to the man’s unique creative genius, to his ability to turn Paris into the fashion capital of the world.”

The prize signals Lagerfeld’s legacy coming full circle with his days as an emerging designer. At the age of 21, Lagerfeld entered the second iteration of the Woolmark Prize in 1954. A panel, which included iconic designers Pierre Balmain and Hubert de Givenchy, awarded 18-year-old Yves Saint Laurent the prize for dress design, while Lagerfeld was named the winner of the coat category. The two would go on to become the most celebrated fashion designers of their time and the rest is fashion history.

Lagerfeld, who served on the jury of the LVMH Prize in his final years, recalled blowing all his prize money on a shopping spree in a 2015 master class at the Hyères International Festival of Fashion and Photography: “It was a worldwide contest organized by the International Woolmark [Secretariat]. They had huge posters in cities saying to send sketches if you aren’t a professional. I sent a few sketches, forgot about it. Later, I got a telegram. I was told I won the first for the prize…It was a lot of money…I went immediately in a place in the passage des Champs-Elysées and spent everything on clothes. It was a happy day. There were a few more.”

The short-listed designers for the 2019 LVMH Prize for Young Fashion Designers, and thus, the Karl Lagerfeld Prize, includes London-based Bethany Williams for her eponymous brand, New York-based designers Emily Adams Bode for BODE and Caroline Hu for HU, and Johannesburg-based Thebe Magugu for his self-named label. Time will tell if one of these designers reach the caliber of Lagerfeld over the next few decades."
"Should You Worry About LVMH Moët Hennessy - Louis Vuitton, Société Européenne's (EPA:MC) CEO Pay Cheque? - Yahoo Finance","Wed, 07 Aug 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy93b3JyeS1sdm1oLW1vLXQtaGVubmVzc3ktMDUzNTQwMDYwLmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Bernard Arnault has been the CEO of LVMH Moët Hennessy - Louis Vuitton, Société Européenne (EPA:MC) since 1989.

According to our data, LVMH Moët Hennessy - Louis Vuitton, Société Européenne has a market capitalization of €176b, and pays its CEO total annual compensation worth €8.2m.

US luxury conglomerates aren't a threat to LVMH and Kering (yet) - Vogue Business,"Mon, 26 Aug 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZvZ3VlYnVzaW5lc3MuY29tL2NvbXBhbmllcy9xMi1sdXh1cnktZWFybmluZ3MtMjAxOS1sdXh1cnktZmFzaGlvbi1sdm1oLWtlcmluZ9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Key takeaways:

Luxury groups posted mixed results for H1 2019 as European companies with tightly controlled global distribution networks thrived.

US companies were hit by poorly performing department stores and price wars.

The Sino-American trade war and sluggish European economies mean the outlook will remain challenging.

Purveyors of luxury goods had a mixed first half of the year. Underperforming department stores, fewer tourist dollars and price wars battered US firms to the extent that positive gains in China proved insufficient to alleviate. Europe-based luxury groups, on the other hand, fared better. Their robust balance sheets place them in a healthier position to withstand what will continue to be a tough operating environment.

Shareholders should brace for further headwinds, as rising geopolitical tensions and the ongoing slide in North America’s wholesale channel cloud the outlook for the remainder of the year.

US wholesale continues to struggle

In the most definitive sign yet that the decline of department stores is accelerating, 96-year old Barneys, once an icon of luxury fashion, filed for bankruptcy in early August. Macy’s recorded stagnant financial sales in the second quarter, and while Nordstrom reported better-than-expected profit figures, fears persist that they came at the expense of “unsustainable cost-cutting”.

Those figures have trickled down to companies with heavy exposure to wholesale channels in the US, with North American companies seeking to replicate the European holding company model facing the biggest obstacles. Credit Suisse estimates that wholesale figures at Michael Kors will drop by double digits as parent company Capri cut revenue expectations for the brand, an indication that department stores are lowering their inventory receipts ahead of the holiday season. “There’s some evidence that the brand got too hot,” says Michael Binetti, an analyst at Credit Suisse in New York."
"Can Cha Ling, a Local Beauty Brand Backed by LVMH, Succeed in China and Beyond? - Jing Daily","Wed, 21 Aug 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vamluZ2RhaWx5LmNvbS9wb3N0cy9jYW4tY2hhLWxpbmctYS1sb2NhbC1iZWF1dHktYnJhbmQtYmFja2VkLWJ5LWx2bWgtc3VjY2VlZC1pbi1jaGluYS1hbmQtYmV5b25k0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Beauty fanatics in the West probably haven’t heard of Cha Ling 'Esprit du Thé , the secretive but highly-praised Chinese brand backed by French luxury conglomerate LVMH, but Chinese beauty connoisseurs have come to love the brand that’s “infusing beauty with the spirit of tea.”

According to an LVMH press release, the Cha Ling beauty line was born following an encounter between Laurent Boillot, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Guerlain, and two passionate environmentalists: German biologist Josef Margraf and his Chinese wife Li Ming Guo. The three gathered with the ambition of trying to protect the natural beauty of the beloved Yunnan province, the territory that produces some of China’s finest teas, including the cherished Pu’ Er tea.

LVMH states that Pu’Er tea is made thanks to the Bulang people “keeping ancestral traditions preserved,” and it takes decades for it to achieve perfection. The tea is a key component for this LVMH-backed cosmetic line because of its powerful anti-aging, moisturizing, and skin-healing attributes. But despite the promising combination of LVMH’s cosmetic expertise and Pu’Er tea’s competence, some beauty professionals are pessimistic that the domestic brand will ever become an international success story.

Despite their concerns, Cha Ling has evolved at the right time and in the right market. According to the Global Cosmetics Market — by Product, Type, Ingredient, Region — market Size, Demand Forecasts, Industry Trends, and Updates (2018-2025) report, the global cosmetic market was valued at $507.75 billion in 2018 and is expected to reach $758.45 billion by 2025, growing at a robust rate of 5.9 percent. Furthermore, Acumen Research and Consulting is projecting that the global skincare products market will reach $184 billion by 2026.

As reported by Acumen Research and Consulting , the Asia-Pacific market is expected to show its highest growth thanks to “the ease of availability of a wide range of skincare products, growing awareness towards health and beauty, and huge demand for various skincare products.” And according to Euromonitor, the total retail sales of skincare products in China accounted for $30 billion (212.2 billion RMB) in 2018, while the total volume of makeup products reached $6 billion (42.8 billion RMB), representing year-on-year growth of 13.2 percent and 24.3 percent, respectively.

As you can see, the cosmetic market is a highly lucrative segment in China, but one that was, for decades, completely conquered by international brands (L'Oréal S.A, The Estée Lauder Companies). Nevertheless, home-grown brands like Cha Ling starting gaining traction when Chinese consumers began seeing them as an appealing option. HKTDC Research emphasizes that the domestic, high-end cosmetic industry has performed impressively, reaching a market share of about 56 percent. That stellar growth is the result of the excellent use of domestic social media platforms, a strong online presence, and expansion into Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities. And the same research mentions that organic cosmeceuticals (Chinese herbal cosmetics) are gaining momentum. Yet, despite all of this, there’s still room for improvement.

“Cosmeceuticals only make up about 20% of the market in the mainland at present,” the HKTDC Research states, “whereas in Europe, the U.S., Japan, and South Korea, cosmeceuticals command a 50-60% share.” At first glance, the market conditions seem favorable for Cha Ling — a brand that merges French savoir-faire with Chinese values — but beauty experts have identified the four following challenges the brand will face in expanding in China and beyond:

1. T

Up until 2013, China was a playground for global brands, and they completely overshadowed the local players. Ubifrance states that international brands owned around 60 percent of a $15.5-billion market: “At the end of 2012, L’Oréal was marketing 20 brands in China, among which are Maybelline and L’Oréal Paris, whose growth was around 12.4 percent per year. Clarins’ online sales increased by 500% between September 2012 and 2013.” Today, the market is friendlier to home-grown brands, but smaller players still find it difficult to challenge the international status quo.

Global players have a variety of competitive advantages like access to financial resources, large talent pools, new technologies, long-term global marketing strategies, and flawless distribution channels. With these selling points, it’s easy to annihilate smaller, domestic players. Fortunately, Cha Ling benefits from LVMH’s help and can take full advantage of the French conglomerate’s distribution channels, know-how, and marketing acumen.

2.

Over the past decades, various consumer safety scandals tainted the “Made in China” label, therefore, Chinese beauty buyers, according to Jing Daily, “still find foreign beauty brands more appealing than their domestic counterparts, believing that Western cosmetics offer higher quality.” Generally speaking, the country’s safety standards have improved, and the government rolled out a marketing strategy aimed at building consumer trust. Meanwhile, younger consumers have enthusiastically received the country’s “buy local” policy, but, despite this new hype, trust isn’t built overnight, and Chinese luxury buyers remain cautious about homegrown brands.

3.

To remain competitive, today’s beauty players need to innovate — and not just in cutting-edge technologies but also avant-garde ideas and new approaches or processes. Global beauty brands are investing in R&D while aggressively promoting technology-backed cosmetics.

According to Jing Daily, “augmented reality, 3D printing, smart beauty devices, and high-tech makeup, are revolutionizing the skincare market” in China. And lastly, Cha Ling must find new ways to incorporate innovation into all their processes and systems. For now, it does a tremendous job at balancing innovation with tradition.

4.

Early-stage businesses require higher funding. That’s because, from the very beginning, the expenses associated with designing a new product line, adjusting the design to market requirements, testing samples, and advertising the final product can kill many startups. Emerging brands allocate the biggest chunk of their budget to marketing and promotional campaigns. Likewise, training high-potential employees and efficient mentoring programs come with a hefty price tag. But startups need to invest in new equipment, software, and servers, too.

In conclusion, for emerging brands like Cha Ling, it will take money to make money."

Aug 05, 2019 | By Jonathan Ho

If you have not heard of LVMH’s latest beauty and wellness brand Cha Ling, it’s not coincidental. It’s the French luxury conglomerate’s first foray into Traditional Chinese Medicine and a doubling down of the conglomerate’s investment on China, launched without fanfare save a single press release on LVMH Group’s corporate site in 2016.

During a private business meeting in June 2019, Citi Group analyst Thomas Chauvet noted that Louis Vuitton Chief Executive Michael Burke expressed that the brand was witnessing “un-heard of” growth rates in the Middle Kingdom on the backs of China’s efforts to reduce “daigou” – the practice of bringing in undeclared luxury goods from outside the country, usually with VAT claimed, for resale on the mainland. While this phenom is related to luxury handbags and accessories, the growing appetites of Chinese consumers is prompting LVMH to entrench themselves in more facets of Chinese lifestyle. Enter Cha Ling.

According to Ubifrance, foreign companies dominated the Chinese cosmetic market up until 2013, owning 60% of a 14-billion-euro market with French brands like L’Oréal Paris, Lancôme, Clarins, and Dior taking the lion’s share of the pie ahead from Japanese and US brands. By 2014, the tide had turned, according to Euromonitor, though sales of beauty products and make-up in China increased from 6.7% and 10.9% between 2014 and 2015 respectively, growing competition from Japanese, South Korean and home-grown Chinese brands had clawed back crucial market share from French dominance.

According to the China Shopper Report 2015, 2014 was also the first year where home grown Chinese labels outperformed foreign brands, contributing to 87% of market growth representing almost 70% of market value in twenty-six product categories. Analysts were quick to point out that Chinese cosmetic brands didn’t get there on their sole marketing efforts alone, the Chinese government had made it a national policy to encourage citizens to “buy local” plus the confluence of growing numbers of Chinese looking to take care of their health and appearance.

The world of beauty was introduced to Cha Ling, l’Esprit du Thé in 2016. A carefully articulated, well executed bet where heritage French savoir-faire ventures deep into the Yunnan Province, specifically the Xishuangbanna region, in a region untouched by pollution and home to an ecosystem producing the world’s oldest variety of Pu’Er leaves.

When a pair of environmental champions, German biologist Josef Margraf and his Chinese wife Li Ming Guo met with Laurent Boillot, Chief Executive Officer of Guerlain, the idea of Cha Ling became the sort of “marriage in heaven”, one where a large luxury conglomerate could leverage their behemoth communications, retail and distribution engine to protect the “green lung” of China by not only promoting but also preserving the ecosystem of the region that produces Pu’Er tea.

The prestige segment of cosmetics is currently dominated by international brands like Procter & Gamble’s SK-II, even then SK-II, given its Japanese roots, has a largely Asian narrative of rice and authentic ingredients. Given this understanding, what Guerlain’s Chief really cottoned onto was the idea of a Sino-French cosmetics house which could neatly fall into the narrative of the government’s “buy local” policy while simultaneously being seen as a champion of sustainable development in China.

Cha Ling might succeed where Shanghai Tang didn’t

After owning the brand since 2008 when luxury demand in China started to peak, Richemont finally divested its stake of Shanghai Tang in 2017. It was a business with potential but one fraught with the unchartered waters requiring astute cultural navigation. Eventually, a combination of off-the-rack cheongsam with out-of-touch pricing (since the cheongsam was traditionally a bespoke fitted garment) and the odd cultural crossroads where you were marketing a brand to a highly nationalistic citizenry where a large number of your clientele are gwai lo 鬼佬 or lao wai 老外 and you begin to have the ingredients for a contradiction of cultural expectations which eventually did them in. Yes, while Shanghai Tang represents an entirely different segment, the lessons are not dissimilar and it appears that Cha Ling largely avoids most of the hazards which typically accompanies what is essentially European adoption of authentically Chinese ingredients.

Cha Ling initially adopted the Euro-centric model of “origin” or provenance story as a core marketing tool which eventually pivoted to the SK-II model of focus on ingredients. Its championing of Pu’Er and with a third of its founding members being an ethnic Chinese woman no less, makes Cha Ling the kind of success story new undergrads will eventually read about in business school. It also helps that Guerlain CEO Boillot is passionate about Chinese culture, making it easy to avoid many of the tone-deaf marketing campaigns which has plagued some Euro-centric brands in China recently.

While international and domestic cosmetics brands alike are both subject to strict government regulation, the prevailing perception is that foreign brands are safer, use higher quality ingredients or simply more effective than their local partners. Hence, Chinese consumers are dawn to them despite higher prices.

For more than three years, Boillot mobilised the power of the LVMH Group to unlock the extraordinary cosmetic properties of Pu’Er leaves. Eventual scientific validation gave Boillot all the confirmation he needed to start Cha Ling. Never mind origin story, the ingredient, a widely recognised product but now specially harvested from an exotic locale, became the key selling point. One of the world’s oldest, most un-touched variety of Pu’Er tea: a powerful antioxidant also acting as an anti-pollutant and anti-ageing substance once matured.

Was it a calculated risk? You bet it was. According to Euromonitor, retail sales of skincare products in China reached 212.2 billion yuan ($30.85 billion) in 2018, representing year-on-year growth of 13.2 percent, with growth predicted to hit 32% by 2023. Cha Ling, a pro-China, French cosmetics label co-owned by a Chinese national with branding where the Chinese proper noun takes precedence? The gamble begins to look more like a sure investment.

Garnier withdrew from China in 2014.

All Cha Ling products are developed in Guerlain’s French lab but using exclusively Chinese ingredients. The Cha Ling line consists of 50 items from hand creams to fragrances, each retailing between €60 to €250. Sold in five Chinese boutiques in mainland metropolitan cities like Shanghai, as well as in Le Bon Marché."

The award – which was previously called the Special Prize – will be renamed in honour of the designer.

""Karl Lagerfeld, creative director of the house of Fendi since 1965, was involved in the prize since its launch,"" Delphine Arnault, director and vice president of Louis Vuitton told WWD. ""He was fully committed to it since day one, transporting us with his enthusiasm and his energy, sharing with everyone, whether other jury members or candidates, his culture and his passion for fashion.

Lagerfeld worked as a member of the jury for the LVMH prize for years, having won a prestigious award in his youth, from the International Wool Secretariat in 1954, which likely led to his enthusiasm for such recognition.

The winner of the Karl Lagerfeld prize will receive a fund and will then be guided by an expert team for a year, who will help inform them in areas such as intellectual property, sourcing, production, distribution, image, communication and marketing."
LVMH's Next Big Beauty Bet: Traditional Chinese Medicine - The Business of Fashion,"Thu, 01 Aug 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzb2ZmYXNoaW9uLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy9iZWF1dHkvbHZtaHMtbmV4dC1iaWctYmVhdXR5LWJldC10cmFkaXRpb25hbC1jaGluZXNlLW1lZGljaW5lL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"SHANGHAI, China — It's the LVMH brand you've probably never heard of. Launched quietly a few years ago, this beauty marque is tapping into unchartered territory for a prestige brand and doubling its revenues every year in the process — and no, it's not following the Fenty Beauty playbook.

Cha Ling is a brand developed by Laurent Boillot, chief executive of Maison Guerlain, inspired by Chinese Pu’er tea and traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) traditions. Though it may seem unusual for a French luxury conglomerate to be tapping into ancient Chinese herbal wisdom, the launch is part of a broader movement of Chinese people re-embracing their own cultural traditions in contemporary ways.

“I can sense the pride in Chinese culture and a longing for connection with that. I hear young women saying, ‘My parents were deprived of their culture, I want to retrieve my culture.’ It’s not only about raising the Chinese flag, that’s not where it’s coming from,” Boillot told BoF on a recent trip to China, a country he has been visiting for the past 15 years.

According to Euromonitor, retail sales of skincare products in China reached 212.2 billion yuan ($30.85 billion) in 2018, representing year-on-year growth of 13.2 percent. Chinese herbal cosmetics have been an important part of that growth, opening up a new sector in the market as young consumers begin to concern themselves more about the ingredients and quality of the products they buy.

Given the colossal size of the opportunity, Asian beauty industry leaders may be surprised to learn just how long it took a big international player to cash in on TCM beauty. But LVMH and others are leading a movement whereby western brands are finally looking beyond Korea and Japan for R&D trends and inspiration around Asia.

Cha Ling, which launched in 2016 and is currently sold through 10 boutiques and spas in Paris, Hong Kong, Hangzhou and Shanghai, believes it has cornered a cross-cultural market niche, with its Chinese-inspired ingredients developed and manufactured by LVMH experts and facilities in France.

I hear young women saying, 'My parents were deprived of their culture, I want to retrieve my culture.'

“China has such a great culture. But when I was visiting China and listening to people, what I was hearing was a lack of self-confidence, that ‘Made in China’ was low-quality, that products from Europe, Japan and Korea were [perceived as better].”

With just three years behind it, the brand's success is far from assured, though Boillot says revenues are ""on track"" with doubling of growth every year. And clearly it represents a drop in the ocean for LVMH revenues. But at the brand's original Mainland China outpost, in Shanghai's Taikoo Hui mall, Boillot claims that Cha Ling is ""among the top-ranking"" stores there. The beauty floor is dotted with names such as Guerlain, Tom Ford, Dior, Fresh and dozens more.

But in a market driven by novelty, why is a brand that taps into a tradition spanning over 2,000 years resonating so strongly with Chinese consumers?

National Pride Meets Government Policy

In recent years, as the Chinese government has tried to roll out universal healthcare to its more than 1.4 billion people, officials from President Xi Jinping down have talked up the benefits of TCM, which costs much less to offer in China and is still popular, especially in rural areas.

TCM ingredients are used in China in the belief that they can treat everything from the common cold to cancer, and even modern, middle-class consumers who might turn to Western medicine to cure serious ailments, will still apply TCM theory to daily life without thinking.

Beauty players have found many ways to incorporate these ingredients. Brightening and UV-blocking ginseng, a variety of mushrooms known for their age-reversing properties, skin nourishing ginko biloba and detoxing mung beans are just a few. Tea is similarly part of TCM — known for its anti-oxidant properties.

For beauty players tapping into TCM, one advantage is that such ingredients and their purported efficacy need less education than other ingredients when they are introduced in products. TCM is familiar to Chinese people of all ages and backgrounds.

“TCM links generations here, it’s not something that is just relevant to the older generations, it’s something young people feel they need in their lives, so it’s very relevant for them,” Baillot explained.

For Baillot and executives like him, the more important point is that TCM appears to be something Chinese consumers are willing to pay a premium for.

For example, data from market research firm Mintel reveals that Chinese beauty consumers are willing to pay more for sheet masks that contain rare TCM, with hero ingredients like rhodiola, ginseng and mushrooms popular among Chinese consumers, whether in food and drink, or beauty and personal care.

Other factors are driving the TCM boom. A growing sense of cultural pride and local manufacturers’ move up the value chain means that attitudes are changing. Fewer Chinese consumers now assume that local ingredients or traditions are inferior in quality or efficacy compared with their Western cousins — especially among the youth demographic.

This rise in national pride — known as guochao — is impacting consumer decisions across categories from home appliances to sportswear brands. But what it means is that Chinese incumbent beauty players, who are deeply entrenched and highly competitive, have a natural advantage.

C-Beauty Rises, Again

Unsurprisingly, Chinese herbal beauty is an area in which domestic brands do rather well. International interlopers have traditionally dominated skincare and beauty in the Chinese market, with European and Japanese brands at the premium end and K-Beauty proving popular for more budget-conscious consumers.

Among Chinese beauty players, Shanghai Jahwa is one of the biggest, with the conglomerate announcing revenues of 1.95 billion yuan (or $283.47 million) for Q1 2019, a 5 percent year-on-year increase for the period.

Though they don’t break down revenues for individual brands, Shanghai Jahwa have been investing heavily in Herborist, a TCM-focused brand launched back in 1998 that has caused something of a sensation among Chinese beauty KOLs (influencers) on Xiaohongshu and Weibo over the past few months. Its Brightening Essence Mask (currently for sale on the brand’s Tmall store for 179 yuan, or $26, for a 12-pack) is a favourite.

“Herborist has attracted more young users, aged 18 to 25 years old, in the first half of this year. Owing to a viral campaign in May and June, [our] new mask became one of the best-selling products of the brand, reaching millions of new consumers,” Marketing Director of Herborist Huang Zhikai told BoF.

Alongside Herborist, Pien Tze Huang and Ma Ying Long are traditional TCM pharmaceutical brands that have transitioned into skincare products in recent years, while Xie Yu Chun a heritage brand from the Qing Dynasty, which first appearing in the market back in the 1830s, is having something of a revival.

Last year's break-out television drama, The Story of Yanxi Palace, which was watched by 700 million Chinese, ignited numerous beauty and make-up trends inspired by imperial China. The success of shows such as these is sure to pave the way for more TCM beauty as a focal point.

An International Influx

Cha Ling isn't the first international conglomerate to try its hand at the TCM game, with Procter & Gamble first launching its Oriental Therapy brand, featuring traditional Asian ingredients, back in 2013, before discontinuing the line. P&G declined to comment for this story.

The intervening years, however, have seen something of a boom in Chinese herbal cosmetics. Perhaps encouraged by these trends, Oriental Therapy was resurrected in June this year. Positioned price-wise between Olay and SK-II, with natural ingredients such as ginseng, green tea, saffron and honeysuckle, Oriental Therapy is part of a years-long rebuilding effort from P&G in Mainland China, where it was slow to adapt to the consumption upgrade of discerning middle-class consumers.

It's promoting Chinese culture, but it's also promoting sustainability.

L’Oréal, meanwhile, acquired its way into the TCM sector, buying the original high-end Chinese TCM brand, Yue-Sai, named after its founder Yue-Sai Kan, in 2004 for a reported $50 million.

The brand spent a few years in the wilderness, as upmarket marketing campaigns fronted by supermodel Du Juan failed to resonate with premium consumers due to a lack of significant differentiation from international brands at the same price point.

But shortly after putting TCM ingredients at the forefront (Yue-Sai advertisements almost always feature their hero ingredients: ganoderma and cordyceps mushrooms), the brand has seen something of a renaissance.

Keen to Be Green

Aside from national pride, the other consumer sentiment Boillot has found encouraging from Cha Ling’s perspective is a broader desire for natural products, which goes hand-in-hand with the trend for TCM. The brand guarantees at least 85 percent natural ingredients in its formulations.

Research from Reuter Communications has found ""clean"" beauty to be a key trend among luxury consumers in China, particularly younger consumers, for whom the term ""natural"" is tied up with sustainability (a hot button issue for young people who have come of age breathing the smog of China's major metropolises), and health and wellness.

“I don’t see this as a surprise, with everything that’s happening in the beauty space in China,” said Reuter Communications Head of Fashion and Beauty, Jerri Ng, of the trend for TCM beauty products.

“It’s promoting Chinese culture, but it’s also promoting sustainability. Chinese people forgot that, when they were caught up in their desire for Western products, some of the best ingredients and the best beauty knowledge was in their own backyard.”

Laurie Du, Senior Beauty Analyst at Mintel Beauty & Personal Care, agrees that TCM is particularly relevant to a younger population. “Despite their unhealthy lifestyle choices, younger consumers still want to adopt a healthy diet, have enough sleep and exercise regularly. This is an aspect that TCM can support,” she said.

A Winning Strategy?

In a diversifying market, it’s likely that much of the consumption, especially from younger consumers, might initially be from mid-priced domestic brands with a reputation for quality, though for high-priced hero products, international brands with their reputation for world-class R&D still have an edge.

Chinese people innately understand the efficacy of TCM, so why not promote that?

For both global and Chinese brands hoping to capitalise on the new trend (or a very old one, depending on your point of view), the most important thing to Chinese consumers remains efficacy and authenticity.

“Understanding and relatability is a key component in terms of beauty and skincare. Chinese people innately understand the efficacy of TCM, so why not promote that?” Jerri Ng asked.

However, global players should approach TCM with caution. A significant segment of Chinese society is growing sceptical of traditional Chinese medicine as an ingredient in beauty products.

In recent years, several high-profile scandals have seen unscrupulous entrepreneurs either make bold, unsubstantiated claims or attempted to sell dangerous products linked to TCM. Such scandals have — arguably unfairly — sullied the reputation of the wider TCM movement for some science-focused Chinese beauty industry leaders and consumers.

Other risks for western brands include accusations of cultural appropriation or tone-deaf marketing. For foreign brands, the authenticity part of this equation might be the harder nut to crack, though Cha Ling’s Laurent Boillot believes they have struck the right balance.

“There’s no pretension from our side about telling Chinese how to do TCM; we are inspired by Chinese traditions. It’s a dialogue and Chinese people appreciate this,” Boillot said.

The inaugural Karl Lagerfeld Prize will be presented during the sixth edition of the contest on September 4 at the Fondation Louis Vuitton. The winner will receive €150,000 (£136,000) and a one-year mentorship scheme under the LVMH team, which has been teaching skills such as sourcing, production, distribution, communication and marketing since the Prize’s inception in 2013. Last year, more than 1,700 applicants from 100-plus countries entered, according to WWD. The rules – it is open for anyone under the age of 40, who has produced and sold at least two women’s or men’s ready-to-wear collections – will remain the same under the Prize’s new moniker.

The Karl Lagerfeld Prize “naturally perpetuates the closeness we developed over the years and is a tribute to the man’s unique creative genius, to his ability to turn Paris into the fashion capital of the world,” continued Arnault. Lagerfeld, himself, won an award from the International Wool Secretariat in 1954, thus reinforcing the value of gaining recognition during the early days of a designer’s career. For 2019’s shortlist of brands – Bethany Williams, Andrealage, Bode, Hed Mayner, Kenneth Ize, Phipps, Stefan Cooke and Thebe Magugu – the initial commendation speaks for itself.

September will also see “The White Shirt Project” come to life, whereby seven of Lagerfeld’s closest friends and collaborators, including Kate Moss, Cara Delevingne, Diane Kruger and Amber Valletta, have reimagined the designer’s signature shirting. Each button-down will be displayed in Lagerfeld’s headquarters on the Rue Saint-Guillaume during Paris Fashion Week, before they are replicated 77 times and sold for €777 (£700) in accordance with Lagerfeld’s favourite number: seven. All proceeds will go to Sauver la Vie’s work at Paris Descartes University, which he supported for several years."
Luxury and fashion group LVMH appoints Publicis Media as its agency in EMEA region - Campaign Middle East,"Mon, 26 Aug 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vY2FtcGFpZ25tZS5jb20vbHV4dXJ5LWFuZC1mYXNoaW9uLWdyb3VwLWx2bWgtaGFzLWFwcG9pbnRlZC1wdWJsaWNpcy1tZWRpYS1hcy1pdHMtYWdlbmN5LWluLXRoZS1lbWVhLXJlZ2lvbi_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"

Publicis Media has won the EMEA media account of LVMH, the luxury-goods and fashion conglomerate, after conducting a competitive review. The pitch covered 15 markets in the EMEA region, including MENA region but excluding the UK and its home market of France. Publicis Media’s Zenith was one of four incumbents, which also included Havas Media, Dentsu Aegis Network and, in MENA, Omnicom’s OMD.

LVMH is one of the world’s biggest fashion and drinks groups and owns many luxury brands including Louis Vuitton, Moët & Chandon, Hennessy, Veuve Clicquot, Bulgari, Dior, Celine and Givenchy. ID Comms ran the pitch – one of a series of regional reviews by LVMH. The consultancy has managed previous LVMH media reviews including North America in 2018, won by Dentsu Aegis Network from Havas, and Asia-Paciﬁc in 2017, won by bespoke Group M agency L’Atelier from Zenith.

It is thought that Publicis Media could create a bespoke unit for LVMH for EMEA. LVMH did not respond to inquiries about its review. Publicis Media and ID Comms would not comment.

The company told investors on its second-quarter earnings call in July that it had made “very heavy

investment in marketing” in the ﬁrst half of this year. Marketing and selling expense rose 15 per cent in line with the company’s revenue growth. Jean-Jacques Guiony, chief ﬁnancial oﬃcer at LVMH, described marketing investment as the group’s largest “discretionary” expense and said it had two beneﬁts because it delivers a “short-term impact” on sales and is “easy to cut” if things slow down. There is a continued “willingness to invest heavily into marketing” as the group faces “competition” and wants to maintain “barriers to entry”, particularly from new insurgents, he added.

LVMH has sought to appeal to younger audiences, recently striking a deal with singer Rihanna to create fashion brand Fenty."

The report further said that the established firm will be engaged in trading of cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin (BTC), bitcoin cash (BCH), ether (ETH) and XRP, litecoin (LTC) and dogecoin (DOGE).

However, later it updated the report saying, “after publication, this message was formally denied by Bernard Arnault.”

Miguel Vargas, responsible for the group in Mexico since 2016 has been promoted as vice president for southeast United States, the executive told Mds.

Graduate in economic sciences in Barcelona, the executive took the lead of Louis Vuitton in the Mexican market in 2016. Vargas joined the French group coming from the Textile Lonia, where he led the brands of the Aztec group for two years and a half. Before that, the executive already worked for LVMH as a responsible for its Latin American division and had several positions in the Middle East division of the group owned by Bernard Arnault.

Reliving him, the group has added Gregorio Jiménez Castillo to run the business in the Mexican, Central America and Caribbean market. In 2012, Jiménez signed as a director for Swarovski in Mexico and in 2017 took control of the Austrian company in the rest of Latin America. Now the executive is based in Mexico, to run Louis Vuitton in the country, as well as in Panama and Aruba.

LVMH, owner of brands like Celine or Chloé, is the biggest luxury group in the world by revenue. In its fiscal year 2018, the holding’s revenue was 46.8 billion euros (52.2 billion dollars), 10% more than the previous year."

Thirty-two companies representing some 150 brands have signed up to the “Fashion Pact”, a Kering-led effort to reduce the industry’s negative impact on climate, biodiversity and the oceans. Details of the commitment will be outlined to world leaders at the Group of Seven summit in Biarritz on August 26, but Kering chief executive François-Henri Pinault – who President Emmanuel Macron tapped to lead the charge in April – will discuss the coalition’s promise at the Elysée Palace today with Burberry CEO, Marco Gobbetti, and president of fashion at Chanel, Bruno Pavlovsky.

“Pinault got his shirt wet,” a Kering spokesperson told Business of Fashion of his achievement enlisting roughly 30 percent of the industry. “Considering the deadline, it was challenging.” Signatories so far include high-street giants H&M and Inditex; luxury houses Chanel, Hermès International, Prada, Salvatore Ferragamo, Giorgio Armani, Burberry, Ralph Lauren, Capri Holdings and PVH; and sportswear labels Adidas and Nike. Although Stella McCartney has pledged her commitment, the designer’s investor and rival Kering conglomerate, LVMH, has chosen not to take part in the united effort. Vogue reports.

The “Fashion Pact” is one of several sustainability initiatives implemented by brands rallying together to create change, but perhaps has more riding on it owing to the gravitas of the G7’s involvement. Not only are the labels answerable to Macron – the pact is part of his 2017-launched One Planet Summit – they will be under scrutiny from the world’s leaders, as well as the ever discerning consumer who is demanding more from fashion.

Before Pinault’s October gathering, attention will be on the international fashion week circuit and the detriment it has on the environment. In London alone, campaigners from Extinction Rebellion are attempting to halt show production in the face of the climate emergency. Time will tell whether the industry is actually listening to the loudening warnings."

The retailer also plans to continue introducing more brands into Hong Kong across all its categories to provide “endless new discoveries” ​for its consumers.

Aside from a plethora of new brands, the store will offer bespoke beauty services at the Sephora Beauty Studio. It will also offer exclusive events and masterclasses to consumers.

Sephora will complete its omnichannel model with an upgraded online store, which the company continue to operate after shutting its brick-and-mortar outlets in 2010 after two years in the market.

The company will also be launching Sephora Virtual Artist, digital makeover app which allows consumers to try on and compare products virtually.

To celebrate the grand opening of its flagship, Sephora will offer complimentary ferry rides between Tsim Sha Tsui and Central on the launch date. Additionally, the first 300 consumers to visit the flagship will receive a goodie bag of product curated by Sephora.

Sephora Hong Kong confirmed it would open eight stores in Hong Kong. The second was scheduled to be launched in the fourth quarter of this year at Windsor House in Causeway Bay. Six more will follow in the next two years.

Hong Kong is not the only stop in Sephora APAC expansion plans.

Additionally, it plans to open five more outlets and an e-commerce platform by 2020. By 2022, it expects to open an additional 13 stores."
