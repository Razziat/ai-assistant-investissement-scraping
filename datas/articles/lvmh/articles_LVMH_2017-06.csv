Marine Serre Wins LVMH Prize for Young Designers (Published 2017) - The New York Times,"Fri, 16 Jun 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMTcvMDYvMTYvZmFzaGlvbi9tYXJpbmUtc2VycmUtd2lucy1sdm1oLXByaXplLWZvci15b3VuZy1kZXNpZ25lcnMuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Ms. Serre said her 2017 fall collection, a fusion of contemporary sports silhouettes and logos with Islamic symbols — like the hijab and crescent moon — was an exploration of ties between the Arab and Western worlds. She had been inspired, she said, in the wake of the terror attacks in Paris and Brussels. Ms. Serre is also a finalist for the Andam Prize, and participated in the Hyères festival earlier this year, another accolade seen as a potential catapult to industry stardom.

The maturity of her approach, and vision for the growth of the business, convinced an judging panel, which included the designers Karl Lagerfeld, J. W. Anderson and Nicolas Ghesquière, and the executive vice president of Louis Vuitton, Delphine Arnault, to award her the prize. This year 1,200 designers applied for the prize, the largest number in the award’s history. It is open to designers under the age of 40 who have produced at least two ready-to-wear collections.

“We found Marine to be very impressive, from her unique point of view to the fact her product is very modern, as well as the confidence she displayed at the age of 25 when walking into a room and talking about her ideas with some of the most established designers in the world,” Ms. Arnault said in a telephone call from Paris after the ceremony. “It is always an incredibly difficult decision to make. All eight finalists had achieved such an accomplishment to get to that stage, given the competition. But I think with Marine we got a very clear sense of what she could and would do with the resources.”

The judges also awarded a special prize to the Japanese designer Kozaburo Akasaka, the creative director of Kozaburo, for what they called “his delicately deconstructed men’s wear.” He will receive a 150,000 euro grant (about $168,000) and 12 months of mentoring from LVMH."
Nest's lead industrial designer is leaving to join luxury behemoth LVMH - Vox.com,"Fri, 23 Jun 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZveC5jb20vMjAxNy82LzIzLzE1ODYyNDkwL25lc3QtbGVhZC1pbmR1c3RyaWFsLWRlc2lnbmVyLXJvY2t5LWphY29iLWxlYXZpbmctbHZtaC1sdWlzLXZ1aXR0b24tcmltb3dh0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Nest’s head of industrial design, Rocky Jacob, is leaving the company to join European luxury goods company LVMH, according to sources.

Nest co-founders Tony Fadell and Matt Rogers hired Jacob as its first industrial designer in 2013, and Jacob built the hardware company’s design team from the ground up. Nest was acquired by Google in 2014.

Before his hire, Nest worked with a design contractor. Jacob was responsible for overseeing design on all of Nest’s products starting with the company’s second-generation smoke alarm and third-generation thermostat.

That includes Nest’s camera line and all new products that have not yet shipped from the company, sources say.

Jacob leaves a company that’s undergone large managerial and cultural changes since being acquired by Google, now Alphabet. Fadell left his role as CEO of Nest a year ago amid staff turmoil. Nest has now become more tightly integrated into Alphabet, and more recently has started incorporating Google software into its devices. Some insiders, however, have chafed over what they see as a big cultural shift that focuses less on design.

Design has been a core focus at Nest since its founding, and has been a core focus of Nest co-founder Fadell going back to his time at Apple where he designed the iPod. Rogers remains at the company as chief product officer.

Jacob has changed his title on his LinkedIn account to “advisor” at Nest, which became its own subsidiary within Alphabet after Google was reorganized into the conglomerate.

He is joining LVMH as chief product officer for the conglomerate’s luxury luggage line, Rimowa, which means he will be in charge of engineering, design and product strategy.

Recode has reached out to Nest and Alphabet for comment."
How the LVMH Prize became one of the most important contests in fashion - Vogue France,"Thu, 15 Jun 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZvZ3VlLmZyL2Zhc2hpb24vZmFzaGlvbi1uZXdzL2RpYXBvcmFtYS9sdm1oLWZhc2hpb24tcHJpemUtY29tcGV0aXRpb24vNDM4OTjSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LVMH fashion prize competition vogue Bertrand Rindoff Petroff

When the inevitable Karl Lagerfeld biopic is made, its narrative will peak first in 1954 — the year his extraordinary life in fashion really began. Lagerfeld, then only 21, was awarded a prize by the International Wool Secretariat for his extraordinary coat designs. The same year, a teenager by the name of Yves Saint Laurent took home the dresses category. Lagerfeld was hired as an assistant to Pierre Balmain — who sat on the prize’s jury — while Saint Laurent found work at the house of Dior. The rest is history.

Today, that competition is known as the Woolmark Prize, and it remains an important launchpad for young designers. A host of similar contests have emerged alongside it, from the ANDAM Fashion Award in Paris to the CFDA/Vogue Fashion Fund in New York City. In 2014, these were joined by the LVMH Prize, a competition sponsored by its namesake luxury conglomerate. The prize — open to anyone under the age of 40 who has produced at least two collections — offers €300,000 to the winner plus a year of mentorship from LVMH and its network. It also offers a runner-up Special Prize that includes €150,000 and similar mentorship opportunities. Thanks to the prominence of its sponsor company and the eminence of its jurors, which include Louis Vuitton’s Nicolas Ghesquière and Lagerfeld himself, the prize has quickly established itself as one of the – if not the – most prestigious contests for young designers working in fashion around the world today. This year, more than 3,000 designers representing 102 nationalities applied."
Introducing LVMH Prize-Nominated Designer Atlein | AnOther - AnOther Magazine,"Thu, 15 Jun 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFub3RoZXJtYWcuY29tL2Zhc2hpb24tYmVhdXR5Lzk5MjkvaW50cm9kdWNpbmctbHZtaC1wcml6ZS1ub21pbmF0ZWQtZGVzaWduZXItYXRsZWlu0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Text Elizabeth Brauders

AnOther has partnered with 1 Granary to create a series of Emerging Talent pieces, celebrating some of the most exciting upcoming creatives working in fashion design today. The images are darkly arresting. A young woman hunched and curved into bold shapes in the light and shade of a disused power plant and the waters of the North Sea as the sun sets. The most noticeable component? Her clothes. A warrior whose aesthetic covers retro, classical, and futuristic in a contemporary mélange. It’s no surprise these campaign images, shot by CG Watkins, and art directed by Sacha Quintin and Éric Diulein from Masses, are so cinematic; they were inspired by Andrei Tarkovsky and Ingmar Bergman and the model was chosen for her Sigourney Weaver-esque look. There’s more than a little of the Ripley about these images, catapulted into the setting of Stalker with a (much) better wardrobe. The designer of these looks and creative director behind the photographs, Antonin Tron, was born in Paris in 1984 and grew up in the world’s fashion capital during the heyday of John Galliano, when fashion was at an apex of glamorous power and celebrity influence. Yet he informs me he was totally un-enthralled by it. “Okay, I was interested in fashion, but in a very distant way,” he concedes. From such beginnings to a place on the coveted shortlist for the LVMH prize, Tron continues to coyly play with the unexpected.

The aesthetic of previous collections, along with this one, is a visual bricolage of references with the requisite amount of understated French sex appeal. Each piece conforms to the cardinal rule of chic: never look as though you’ve tried too hard. An Atlein dress is your look, and you don’t fuck with insouciant perfection. The brand’s aesthetic is undeniably appealing and brings me dangerously close to using the eye-roll inducing term ‘strong woman’. Tron prefers the qualifier ‘modern’ – a word that crops up again and again as we speak. He is disgusted by the appearance of anachronistic corsetry in mainstream fashion, almost disbelieving: “come on, we are in 2017, you don’t have to be restrained by what you wear. [The corset] is a torture object!”

Most of all, the collection feels like an answer for young women who crave a wardrobe with extensive recreational/professional overlap. When streetwear feels too casual and masculine tailoring feels dated or desperate, here is an elegant solution. Atlein promotes an aesthetic that feels natural and fresh, blending an athlete (not an activewear queen) with an ancient Greek goddess, enabling women to define strength in their own terms. It’s a fresh take on clothing that lets you feel in control, or ready to command respect. These are pieces you can work in, dance in, get angry in, or just roundhouse kick an extraterrestrial being in the face in. Above all, Atlein is about women who move. “I design for the idea of the body in motion, quite active and moving around,” explains Tron, an influence visible in the curved lines and accommodating pleats of his pieces.

“I think it’s something that should be celebrated. But I really believe there is no one femininity and there’s no one masculinity. For me, I want to celebrate that woman’s body and a certain idea of femininity” - Antonin Tron Pleasingly, this powerful aesthetic was born of the shapes and movements of a curved feminine figure, not a toughness borrowed from masculine traditions of military or tailoring, as is so often the route to offering women a more commanding appearance. “I think it’s something that should be celebrated. But I really believe there is no one femininity and there’s no one masculinity. For me, I want to celebrate that woman’s body and a certain idea of femininity.” The choice of brand name itself seems a considered move to allow clients the space to personalise their interaction with his clothing. Tron wanted not a label that bears his name, but that creates “the idea of a space, or an entity that people relate to, so it’s not me. Hopefully it will be a place someday where people can physically visit.”

The aesthetic and attitude is uniquely, toughly exquisite, but the brand is technically brilliant too. There is a careful, deliberate philosophy that underpins the designer’s methods. The first collection Tron released was composed solely of jersey, and he has taken the time to master this fabric before slowly expanding his collection. “The choice of the fabric is the heart of everything,” he explains to me, “and then you work around that. The technical aspects are the beautiful thing about what I do.” His producers have been carefully chosen from those he’s worked with for years and with whom he has developed a strong relationship. Tron has a marked preference for family-run businesses that have purposefully cultivated their savoir-faire and passed it down through generations. Despite a considerable talent for creating clothes, his own wardrobe is composed of pieces from Carhartt, another family-run brand.

The ability to create something of quality is clearly hugely important to Tron; the idea that each piece should merit its luxury price tag because of the time and craftsmanship invested in it, from the textile sourcing to the meticulous cut and finish. Yet Tron understands that luxury consumers are searching for more than well-made clothes. “Fashion is not just about an object, it’s about the object granting you access to something else, another world,” he says. Tron’s brand is a complex fantasy of cinematic aesthetics and grandiosity with the elusive Gallic cool factor of everyday Parisian life as presented by Jean-Luc Godard. Despite the huge amount of skill put into getting the cut, textile, and design very particularly made, the clothing as a cultural signifier is also key to the designer’s concept: “it’s not only a product. It carries a culture, a culture of making things, of a certain way of living, something very European I believe.” “Fashion is not just about an object, it’s about the object granting you access to something else, another world” - Antonin Tron

From the beginning of the process to the end, here is a creator who has contemplated every angle of his collection, from raw material to cultural theory. This is perhaps unsurprising considering the young designer first studied literature and cites favourites amongst Jun'ichirō Tanizaki, Lautréamont, and Marguerite Duras. In spite of the creating a brand that has already won the prestigious ANDAM Prix Des Premieres Collection and is currently shortlisted for the LVMH prize, Tron maintains a pleasing aura of humility and serenity. His nomination for the LVMH prize is discussed with a touching practicality as well as an appreciation of the opportunities this recognition would mean: “we’re independent and self-financed with all the difficulties that one encounters, so it [winning] would help a lot…”

With supporters such as Rihanna and Florence Welch, the designer returns to the competition for a second time following his 2015 shortlisting. In advance of the announcement of the 2017 LVMH Prize, Document speaks with Nayal, one of this year’s eight finalists that are changing the way we think of and view fashion.

Document—How did growing up in Syria inform you as an artist?

Nabil Nayal—Ever since I can remember I have been drawn to fabrics. My father ran a textile shop in Aleppo, where I was born. I used to accompany him to the store, which, for me, was a playground of creative possibilities. Customers would come in and unroll meters and meters of fabric, abstractly draping shapes and forms—using their own bodies as living mannequins. They would throw the fabric in the air to assess its qualities; their bodies transformed by endless creative possibilities. It was this confidence in asserting one’s own aesthetic in dramatic Syrian manner—cemented by my mum’s Western contradiction to traditional Syrian—that sparked some kind of moment in me as a young child.

In embracing new technologies, we can disrupt our thinking to arrive at unexpected creative potential.

Document—What led to your research and experimentation with 3-D printing? Do you see this as the future of fashion?

Nabil—I came about 3-D printing by accident. When I was studying at the Royal College of Art in London, the lifts would always break, so I used to have to walk up seven flights of stairs to get to my studio. If I got tired, I would stop and look through the windows over the park. One day, I saw students carefully carrying the most mesmerizingly pure-white objects into the Rapid Prototyping department. I followed them in and, three months later, my MA collection was shown depicting cobweb-like tulle draped over 3-D printed baroque. In embracing new technologies, we can disrupt our thinking to arrive at unexpected creative potential.

Document—What have you learned since your previous participation in the competition?

Nabil—Being part of the LVMH Prize is a tremendous experience. I was fortunate enough to be shortlisted in 2015. That gave me the opportunity to discuss my vision for my brand with so many talented individuals and led to moments that I shall always treasure—the most notable being when Karl Lagerfeld, upon seeing my work, exclaimed “I love it, I love it, I love it” and then proceeded to buy one of our shirt-dresses for Amanda Harlech. I was thrilled to be shortlisted once again this year, and it was great to be able to show the panel how we have grown and evolved following the advice we received [before].

On June 16, 2017, eight next generation designers—Yoon Ahn (Ambush), Kozaburo Akasaka, Cecilie Bahnsen, Nabil Nayal, Molly Goddard, Maria Kazakova (Jahnkoy), Marine Serre, and Antonin Tron (Atlein)—will compete for the 2017 LVMH Prize. The award, juried by the likes of Maria Grazia Chiuri, Nicolas Ghesquiére, Jonathan Anderson, and Delphine Arnault, among others, was born out of the need to find and foster emerging creatives—an invaluable process in the often rigorous terrain of the fashion landscape."

Rihanna wears Chopard to the 2017 LVMH Prize for Young Fashion Designers

Just four days ago, during the afternoon of June 16, Rihanna was in attendance at the Louis Vuitton Foundation in Paris to award the annual LVMH Prize for Young Fashion Designers to the chosen winner. Selected by a Jury of fashion’s who’s who comprising Karl Lagerfeld, Riccardo Tisci and Bernard Arnault, the chairman and CEO of LVMH himself, Rihanna arrived at Fondation Louis Vuitton in Paris dressed in an unimpeachable head-to-toe Dior in a floor-length lace dress with a cleavage flattering plunging neckline and nigh scandalous thigh slit. The stylish ensemble framed her voluptuous figure, accessorised with a brimmed black hat, an oxblood clutch, strappy pointed toe ankle heels and of course, Chopard. How else is one elegantly appointed enough without the help of Chopard haute joallerie when your sole responsibility that Friday afternoon is to crown the fashion industry’s next up and coming young designer?

Rihanna presented the 2017 LVMH Prize for Young Fashion Designers to French-Belgian designer Marine Serre, who beat out seven other finalists. The final eight were themselves, stringently selected from about 1,000 other creative contenders.

Held annually, the LVMH Prize for Young Fashion Designers supports new generations of creators with a grant of 300,000 euros and technical and financial support for a period for a full calendar year."

Godfrey Deeny Published

Jun 15, 2017

Friday will be a big day for , when she unveils the winner of the latest Prize, an award she invented and has developed to considerable acclaim.







Delphine Arnault - LVMH



The winner's name will be read out inside the Franck Gehry-designed Foundation, from a podium upon which the likes of , and will join her.



The LVMH Prize is her brainchild and its top award the richest prize in fashion. Moreover, in four quick years, it's grown to become the most media-attention-winning award as well.

Delphine is the eldest child of the five born to , the chairman and controlling shareholder of LVMH. It is not only the largest single company in France, measured in terms of market capitalization, it is also the owner of a remarkable series of brands, encompassing fashion, luxury, perfumes, fine wines and high-end retailing. If global luxury has a First Family, it is without doubt the Arnaults.



Born in Lille in 1975, Delphine attended French business school EDHEC, the London School of Economics (just JFK and Mick Jagger) and did two years at & Company before joining LVMH. First at Christian , and latterly at Louis Vuitton; while raising her daughter Elisa with her partner, French telecommunications and technology entrepreneur Xavier Niel. Reserved yet blessed with a warm smile, Delphine's experience working with such diverse talents as , , Jacobs and Ghesquière has given her unique insights into how great designers operate. She is seen by many as LVMH's chief scout.



So, we caught up with Delphine, for an exclusive interview on the LVMH Prize and how she skillfully handles career, fame and family.



Fashion Network: What first gave you the idea of the LVMH Prize?



Delphine Arnault: As a leader in our industry, it is our responsibility to identify the talents of tomorrow, and help them to develop. That's the starting point of the prize. And it's been amazing to witness its evolution and see it gain authority. It's a project close to heart.



FNW: Why did you think of having two levels of jury?



DA: We received 1,200 dossiers from designers this year. That's tremendous. And we chose 21 of them for what we call the semi-final. That's where they are judged by a large number of real experts: stylists like and Marie-Amélie Sauvé; fashion editors like , and ; buyers, such as , Linda Fargo and ; makeup artists like Pat McGrath or Peter Phillips; and photographers such as . Different protagonists who can aid young designers in their careers. They meet some 50 key people in our industry that they might not otherwise meet. All within two days!



That helps build their reputation and nourish useful contacts. Perseverance is also an important element in the prize. For example, Jacquemus was chosen one year but did not win; but the following year he came back and won a special prize. Marques' Almeida too. That just shows you that fashion is not a sprint. It's a marathon. That you have to work each day and that success comes from perseverance.



FNW: Why did you chose a second jury of major designers?



DA: I believe that chez LVMH we have the best designers in the world. From Karl (Lagerfeld) to Nicolas (Ghesquière) to Marc (Jacobs) to JW (Anderson) to Humberto (Leon) and Carol (Lim). We have really incredible creators and they are all surrounded by teams of young designers.



Karl, for example, began his career by winning a prize. So, who could be better to evaluate and judge a young designer? It's like when Shchukin (a recent star exhibition in the Foundation Louis Vuitton), discovered the work of Picasso, if you want an example from the art world. Matisse recommended that he look at Picasso, whom he rated as ""vital."" It's the same thing for designers, where their eye allows them to recognize talent. Look at Christian Dior, he had Yves and in his team. They are the best placed to pick out the talents of tomorrow.



FNW: How good a millésime was 2017?



DA: I think they very much reflect the spirit of our times. There are five females among the finalists, which makes us proud. Moreover, there are two Frenchwomen, an Englishwoman and a Syrian. And in terms of creativity, there are creators who design for men, women and unisex.



FNW: So it's very mixed nationality-wise?



DA: The LVMH Prize is a Digital Prize. That's how a young designer applies – online. We started from the principle that everyone today has access to a computer and thus could apply. After that, we wanted the prize to be truly global with multiple nationalities. All you have to do is be between 18 and 40 years old; and have created two commercial collections.



FNW: Tell us about the mentoring that is part of the prize?



DA: The winner of the LVMH Prize gets 300,00 euros. But beyond that, what's really important in my view is that for one year, or even more, a dedicated team from LVMH accompanies them. Responding to all sorts of questions about pricing; production; accounting; developing new lines; protecting their brand name; or launching perfumes, accessories or shoes. Young fashion houses are nearly always tiny teams so the designer cannot do all that.



FNW: Why did fashion need another prize?



DA: It's about reaching out to youth. It's the only prize that is truly international, really global. Which reflects our epoch. It's the only prize where the jury is made of the best designers in the world, who will elect the most promising new creator. And, I think, to meet Karl, Nicolas, Jonathan, Marc, Phoebe, Humberto or Carol is a very exciting moment in their lives, something they will never forget.



FNW: What do you say to people who suggest that the LVMH Prize is also a way for your corporation to discover real talent without hiring a headhunter?



DA: For the moment we haven't hired anyone who reached our finals. Maybe one day that will be different. But right now that is not our goal.



FNW: What are the special talents that you look for in a finalist?



DA: A really unique point of view, style and vision. Ideas in synch with our era. We believe that it is important to express their ideas clearly and to speak about their own house. Each finalist has 10 minutes to present themselves before the jury, accompanied by stockmans, to explain their vision, to convince. After that, there is a lunch with my father (Bernard Arnault) where we discuss each candidate and then we vote.



FNW: You come from one of France's most famous families. Is it always a help, or sometime a hindrance to be so prominent?



DA: I have a great opportunity to work for this group. It's very exciting. I began my career first with Dior, where I worked for 12 years beside . Now I work chez Vuitton. I think that I am very lucky to have known this universe from a very young age and that my father has trusted me so much.



FNW: Many people say that Nicolas Ghesquière was your choice for Louis Vuitton?



Nicolas is incredible. I love working with him. I've known him a long time. In my view, he is one of the most talented designers of our generation. But, I simply offered my opinion, and it was my dad who decided along with (CEO of Vuitton).

Revealed: the Romanian site where Louis Vuitton makes its Italian shoes - The Guardian,"Sat, 17 Jun 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy8yMDE3L2p1bi8xNy9yZXZlYWxlZC10aGUtcm9tYW5pYW4tc2l0ZS13aGVyZS1sb3Vpcy12dWl0dG9uLW1ha2VzLWl0cy1pdGFsaWFuLXNob2Vz0gF3aHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAudGhlZ3VhcmRpYW4uY29tL2J1c2luZXNzLzIwMTcvanVuLzE3L3JldmVhbGVkLXRoZS1yb21hbmlhbi1zaXRlLXdoZXJlLWxvdWlzLXZ1aXR0b24tbWFrZXMtaXRzLWl0YWxpYW4tc2hvZXM?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Louis Vuitton’s Italian shoes are the very height of luxury. Its Venice workshop claims to embody “ancestral savoir-faire” in a region “revered for its fine shoe craftsmanship”.

It is an image burnished by one of the biggest advertising budgets in the world. The Louis Vuitton Moet Hennessy (LVMH) luxury group spent $4.4bn (£3.45bn) last year on marketing its portfolio of top labels, which range from Moet & Chandon champagne to Givenchy, TAG Heuer and Louis Vuitton shoes, adorned with the LV logo that is a global badge of wealth.

This is, however, far from the full picture. Many of the shoes and boots it sells for between £500 and £1,800 a pair and stamped as “made in Italy” are mostly made in Transylvania, a region better known for vampires than any tradition of luxury craftsmanship.

The factories are a well-kept secret, their identity closely guarded. The management says it has taken pains to ensure they do not turn up in a Google search. On the outside there is no mention of the brand – just a shadow of the Louis Vuitton checkerboard print, painted in grey on the factory walls. The name on the gate is Somarest, a little-known LVMH subsidiary.

A French TV documentary team was turned back at these gates in 2014. Anonymous workers said entire shoes were made in Romania before being sent to Italy, where the soles were added. Bernard Arnault, LVMH’s chief executive and France’s richest man, rejected the claim.

Now the Guardian can report from inside the factory for the first time, and can confirm that thousands of Louis Vuitton shoes leave their doors every week, complete in most details apart from the soles.

When first contacting Somarest, the factory’s communications officer hung up at the mention of Louis Vuitton and did not respond to any further attempt to contact her. Emails were forwarded to the head office in Paris. “We don’t open the doors of our workshops due to internal policy,” the company said.

But Louis Vuitton has not been able to prevent clues about its Romanian operation from leaking on to the internet. A painstaking search through Romanian websites, including staff selfies on Facebook, eventually led to the factory door.

Once you pass security and the cypress trees that stand sentry at the door to the Somarest factory in Cisnadie, a small town at the foot of the Southern Carpathian mountains, Louis Vuitton is omnipresent. At the top of the stairs is a glass case holding a pair of heritage leather boots embossed with the LV logo. They retail for $2,000. On the wall behind is a gallery of handbags on glass shelves.

At the centre of the room is a trunk, a piece of the brand’s history. Louis Vuitton made a name for himself creating these trunks for aristocrats in the 1850s. Today they are made to custom order on the outskirts of Paris, and cost upwards of $30,000.

Exclusivity did not, however, make Louis Vuitton the 20th most valuable brand in the world. In the 1980s the company expanded to cater to a growing middle class, and now the brand makes most of its revenue from selling large amounts of product to the middle market.

As a business model, mass-produced luxury has made Louis Vuitton so successful that it has now acquired 70 luxury houses.Just a few weeks ago it took control of Christian Dior.

To keep profits high, the company had to lower production costs. This is what led it to Cisnadie, a pastel-hued town where EU flags fly from the lampposts along the main street. At one end is the kind of fortified church for which Transylvania is famed. At the other end is the Somarest factory.

LVMH established its first plant here in 2002 to make the most of Romania’s low-wage labour. By 2004, it was producing 1,500 pairs of shoe uppers a week, according to the online CV of the company’s director at the time.

Somarest was not willing to discuss how many shoes it currently produces, but the online CV of its operations manager claims production has increased 70% since 2007, which suggests annual output of well over 100,000 pairs. A second factory was built in nearby Avrig in 2009, also to make components for handbags and suitcases.

A spokeswoman for the factory finally agreed to meet to discuss details of its production. Senior managers, she said, are French and the materials used are likewise imported from France. After assembly, she explained, the factory exports the goods to France and Italy, where they are “finished” so that they qualify for a “made in France” or “made in Italy” label in accordance with EU law.

The European parliament voted for compulsory “made in” labels in 2014 to untangle the knotted thread of globalised production. For goods produced in more than one country, the country of origin is the one where the items underwent “the last, substantial, economically justified processing”. Accordingly, the soles of the shoes are always added after they are exported.

The Romanian factory affords visitors both a real and metaphorical window onto the production process, as a glass wall opens up the offices to the factory floor.

Beyond the window, the work environment is clean and bright and the staff work sitting down. “Here in Romania, these are things that the workers appreciate,” the LV spokeswoman said, referring to the poor working conditions elsewhere in the country that have led campaigners to describe Romania’s substantial garment sector as “Europe’s cheap sweatshop”.

“In Europe’s low-wage countries, workers rights and human rights at work are publicly a taboo and not protected at all,” said Bettina Musiolek of the Clean Clothes Campaign, which works to improve conditions in the industry.

Louis Vuitton’s factories give workers weekends off, pay for overtime and use non-toxic chemicals, the spokeswoman said, facts confirmed by the Inspectoratul Teritorial de Munca, the labour inspectorate in nearby Sibiu. Somarest is a point of pride in this community, the inspectorate made clear. “There have been no complaints, ” said Enciu Dumitru.

The factories employ 734 local people who, according to the spokeswoman, are paid average Romanian garment worker wages. According to Clean Clothes Campaign, that is about €133 (£116) a month. At that rate it would take a worker nearly six months to earn enough to buy a single pair of mid-priced Louis Vuitton leather court shoes.

At such wage rates, garment production in Romania is cheaper than elsewhere in the EU, but lower prices do not mean lower quality, according to Ioana Ciolacu, a leading Romanian fashion designer. “Nor should it be mistaken for child labour, sweatshops and all those horror stories we hear now and then happening in let’s say China or Bangladesh,” she said.

The products at Somarest are moulded and stitched by hand, just as they are in Louis Vuitton’s advertisements, but the craft is not handed down through generations. Most of the workers are trained on site.

Ten years ago the brand opened a store in Bucharest . Shoes produced in Romania can therefore be soled and labeled in France or Italy and then sent back to the Romanian capital to be sold as goods made elsewhere.

The start of this process can be seen through the big glass window that overlooks the Somarest factory floor and the hundreds of workers inside.Visitors are closely watched, however, and it was a matter of just a few moments before a senior manager appeared to usher the Guardian away from the glass – and to direct the spokeswoman into an office for a conversation that appeared terse and stern. The factory visit then came to an abrupt end."

Let us count the ways. She knows how to make an entrance. When Rihanna arrived at the Grammys at the least possible moment, she erased practically every other memory from the red carpet that night in this enormous two foot pink from Giambattista Valli Couture. She takes risks. For the Met gala, she arrived in this big yellow cape that drew comparences to Big Bird and and an omelette. But it was striking she choose to showcase the work of Chinese couturier Guo Pei in honor of the museum's exhibition on Asian art and fashion. She's a muse. Tom Ford's entire Spring show [UNKNOWN] fabulous was largely inspired by non other than Rihanna. She returned the favor by wearing his shockingly bejeweled pasties to an art benefit in LA. She dresses up as well as she undresses down. No one will ever forget the see-through crystal dress that Adam Selman made for her last year at the CFDA awards. But she also looks radiant in tailored jackets, often worn with nothing underneath. Her chameleonic nature made her a natural as the celebrity face of Dior. And what else? She's Rihanna, period. [MUSIC]

If you need a style icon, look no further than Rihanna. The singer has become one of the biggest names in the fashion world because of her advanced style sensibilities. So it wasn't too surprising, then, when she arrived at the the LVMH Prize for Young Designers to present the night's biggest honor.

The LVMH Prize is a pretty big deal. It is given to an up-and-coming fashion designer and the prize is massive. Winners take home about $335,000 and a year of mentorship with experts at LVMH, the parent company of Louis Vuitton, Givenchy, and Marc Jacobs, among many others.

The singer attended leaving the ceremony for the 2017 LVMH Prize in a chic summer dress. For the event, Rihanna

wore a white floor-length Dior dress with a black hat and pop-of-color handbag. "" />

For the special occasion, held on Friday at Fondation Louis Vuitton in Paris, Rihanna wore head-to-toe Dior in a floor-length lace dress with a plunging neckline and a thigh-high slit. She capped off the ensemble with an oxblood clutch, pointed-toe ankle-strap heels, and a brimmed black hat worn over a star-print bandana. Because if you're going to be a presenter in a room full of fashion industry insiders, you want to look as chic as humanly possible.

But Rihanna's arrival to crown the winner was just the cherry on top of the festivities. This year's LVMH winner is French-Belgian designer Marine Serre, who beat out about 1,000 other designers for the award according to WWD.

celebrated his 10th anniversary as creative director of Homme with a highly commercial yet always cool collection that trumpeted his own menswear atelier in Paris. This marked the first menswear show by the house since announced plans in April to acquire it for €6.5 billion.

Van Assche’s atelier address, 3 rue Marignan, was seen on every third look, as broad trim of fine ottoman wool jackets, the piping of coats and in his wackiest moment as ribbon fabric made into redingotes.



For spring 2018, Van Assche wants his guys sartorial with a twist. So, for elegant soirées they appear in bias-cut mini tailcoats, while for all-night bashes they don blousons covered in orchid prints or even rusty red images of hooded dudes. Street met chic throughout this show, where most of the cast wore Gothic jewelry.

The designer showed off his tailoring chops with couple of faux toile black suits where the basting stitching was done in contrasting white. All was anchored by sneakers, most memorably by boxing boots with rocker buckles.

Entitled Late Night Paris, the show invitation was even included within the collection on clubbing sweatshirts and wool tank tops - seen in a set where the runway was grass.



“That’s because it’s about the first time you stay out all night. The sky is the limit and you are ready to fall in love. When you first realize that clothes are going to make a difference - to seduce and to please. It’s Post Innocence,” said the designer, posing between half a dozen models.



“This year is the 70th anniversary of Dior, but it’s also my 10th anniversary. So, including my atelier is a little homage to my team,” smiled Van Assche, who presented his first show a decade ago, when he succeeded .



That’s a long reign in today’s high fashion. And a successful one, considering that today Dior Homme boasts some 60 freestanding boutiques, and estimated annual sales in excess of €200 million.

Presented amid considerable security inside the Grand Palais, the Arnault family was out in force. The show was the first since Dior announced a complicated financial maneuver, whereby will be taken over by LVMH.



The fashion house’s CEO declined any comment on the operation, though he was quick to stress that the new ownership structure “will not change anything operationally within Dior.”

""When I acquired Il MAKIAGE a few years ago, I had a clear vision for the future – to build a global, professional, high-end makeup brand,” said Holtzman. “We have invested significant resources to further develop IL MAKIAGE, building a state of the art R&D division, enhancing our product offering, and creating a unique shopping experience in our mono-brand makeup boutiques.

""We are thrilled to partner with L Catterton and are confident that the firm’s unparalleled experience in building premium brands and global expertise make L Catterton the ideal partner for us.

Stints and Christian Dior and Maison Margiela have informed a collection that treads a new line between sportswear and luxury - think full, ballgown skirts with sports mesh tops, and elbow length gloves against Lycra.

The sportswear concept appealed to her as ""when you put on a football shirt, you know that's who you're going to be today"". Dressed in a pink t-shirt, black leather trousers and red boots, French-Belgian Serre’s starting point was the attacks in Paris, she tells The Telegraph, but the result, ‘Radical call for Love’, is nothing if not celebratory.

The LVMH Prize is an annual award and funding boost, given by the heads of the luxury conglomerate to an up-and-coming label that they believe could put their 300,000 Euro investment to good use.

Window shopping: looking into the retail vision of luxury e-commerce portal 24 Sèvres - Wallpaper*,"Thu, 08 Jun 2017 20:39:16 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndhbGxwYXBlci5jb20vZmFzaGlvbi9sdm1oLWxhdW5jaGVzLWx1eHVyeS1lY29tbWVyY2Utc2l0ZS0yNC1zZXZyZXPSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"When it comes to the world of e-commerce, ease and speed may tick certain boxes, but rarely does a website translate the experience of physically shopping in a beautifully designed store. Enter the newly launched online portal 24 Sèvres, the LVMH-owned e-commerce venture named after the street location of renowned Parisian store Le Bon Marché.



The website brings the experience of shopping within Le Bon Marché – the first ever multi brand department store, founded in 1838 and revolutionised by the entrepreneur Aristide Boucicaut in 1852 – to a global audience. While e-commerce platforms traditionally aim to render the tropes of print media on the screen, the homepage of 24 Sèvres’ website and smartphone app is imagined as a digital ‘vitrine’.



In Émile Zola’s novel The Ladies Paradise (1883), the ‘series of perspectives’ found at The Ladies’ Paradise department store (itself inspired by Le Bon Marché) are described as beholding ‘endless’ spectacle. Similarly, by adopting a moving image-focused and copy-light approach, 24 Sèvres has bought the eager anticipation and promise associated with window shopping to its own homepage.

Le Bon Marché was the world's first department store. (Image credit: Franck Laws)

Online visitors, like the model who stands in front of a store window on screen – her blouse fluttering in the breeze – can peer inside to admire the pieces in 24 Sèvres’ debut exclusive capsule collection, created in collaboration with Le Bon Marché. The collection features exclusive pieces from 68 international brands, like a Loewe and M/M Paris bag or a pair of velvet mules from Paul Andrew’s debut footwear collection for Salvatore Ferragamo.



Global reach yes, but the website – which has been masterminded by Ian Rogers, chief digital officer of LVMH – retains a truly Parisian outlook (the original Le Bon Marché store is steeped in French design history: its Rue de Sèvres incarnation, which was built in 1869, was expanded in 1872 by Gustave Eiffel). It is the solo online destination to offer Louis Vuitton and Christian Dior, while its visual identity echoes that of a Left Bank apartment.



Accessories, so often shot for e-commerce against white or muted backgrounds, have been placed on colourful tiled or weaved timber plinths, while models pose next to coffee tables with flower filled vases, or wooden chairs. The product packaging too has a soupçon of French flair: think a white outer box embossed with the word ‘Paris’ and an arrow pointing to the shopper’s personal initials. Its inner flap features an illustration of Le Bon Marché.



Specific topographical attention to detail is also underscored in sketches of the site’s vitrine mock-ups. These feature instructions emphasising that glossy black Parisian bollards and carved stone street signs should be reimagined in 24 Sèvres' digital window designs, in exact 1:1 ratios of their inspiration. Now that’s what we call window dressing.

By Toby Sterling

AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - Bugaboo, the Dutch company that transformed the market for high-end baby buggies after one of its strollers featured on TV show ""Sex and the City,"" is up for sale in a deal that could fetch 200 million euros ($223 million) following a row between its co-owners, people familiar with the matter said.

Long-standing tensions between the company's founders - former brothers-in-law - first became public during a court hearing on March 7.

Businessman Eduard Zanen, who provided seed capital for the company, had become frustrated after co-founder and inventor Max Barenbrug continued to influence strategic direction after agreeing to a design role. Zanen invoked a 2012 agreement that either could trigger the sale of the company to a third party.

That disagreement was settled without a ruling, a spokeswoman for the Amsterdam District Court said. But Het Financieele Dagblad first reported on Thursday that the partners have now agreed to a sale. Zanen and Barenbrug's sister divorced a decade earlier, the paper said.

Founded in 1999, Bugaboo's breakthrough came after one of its strollers was shown on in an episode of hit TV series ""Sex and The City"" in 2002, when the character Miranda had a baby.

The strollers, which can cost more than $1,000, have been snapped up by celebrities including Gwynneth Paltrow, Victoria Beckham, and Elton John.

Designers Viktor & Rolf, Bas Kosters and the Andy Warhol Foundation, among others, have crafted limited edition designs, and the company recently made a foray into luggage.

The company made a pretax profit of 16.8 million euros ($18.75 million)on sales of 95 million euros in 2015, according to its most recent filing with the Dutch Chamber of Commerce.

Jelena Sokolova, analyst at Morningstar, said Bugaboo could be valued against luggage makers Samsonite and Rimowa, recently acquired by LVMH (LVMH.PA), which both trade at 2 times sales.

Rabobank, which has been given the commission to sell the company, will approach both strategic and private equity buyers for Bugaboo.

""Selling is the wisest decision in a situation like this: when the owners start to fight, that can be the beginning of the end for a lifestyle brand,"" said Dutch marketing specialist Paul Moers.

Moers noted that while Bugaboo's image of sturdy quality and versatility has spawned many imitators, its reputation is still solid and the market is fragmented.

""It's not too late for Bugaboo, not by any means,"" he said.

""Find a buyer with knowledge of sales and marketing and the power to invest behind advertising and you can grab market share, become a much bigger player.""

Competitors and possible buyers for Bugaboo include Britax, owned by Nordic Capital, Stokke, owned by Korean investment firm MXMH, Quinny, owned by Canada's Dorel Industries, Graco, owned by U.S. firm Newell Brands, and LVMH, among others.

Bugaboo has 1,200 employees and models are sold in most developed markets.

L Catterton, one of the world's largest consumer investment funds, which manages $14 billion in capital, is partly held by LVMH (Louis Vuitton, Moet Chandon, Hennessy), a subsidiary of Groupe Arnault.

The capital raised will fund penetration of the US by the brand. Il Makiage CEO Oran Holtzman has retained control of the company.

Holtzman said, ""Beyond the prodigious know-how and many connections that the fund brings with it to the table, the LVMH group - the world's largest conglomerate of prestige brands, which owns Louis Vuitton, Dior, and Sephora, among others - is a substantial shareholder in the fund. We are proud that Il Makiage is becoming part of such a strong and influential group.

""Following the acquisition of ownership of the international Il Makiage brand, the current investment constitutes a major milestone in the brand's global expansion plan. I have no doubt that the investment will enable us to realize our vision of positioning Il Makiage as a leading global professional cosmetics brand.""

Holtzman, 33, acquired Il Makiage in 2013 from a receiver for NIS 12 million. The Il Makiage brand was founded more than 40 years ago in New York. In 2015, the Israeli company acquired ownership of the international brand from the founders of the US chain. The company has 41 stores in Israel and five colleges teaching the cosmetics professions. Il Makiage, which offers 800 cosmetics products, does not use animals to test its products.

LVMH is an international French corporation in the life-style products industry. It was founded as a merger between fashion house Louis Vuitton and Moet Hennessy. It has 60 prestigious brand subsidiaries. Holding company Christian Dior owns 41.36% of LVMH's shares and 59.01% of the voting rights in the company.

Supported by the Singapore Economic Development Board (EDB), the new 20,000 square meter automation facility will be built with an investment of S$10 million between Bolloré Logistics and LVMH as part of a long-term partnership to significantly drive productivity and increase space efficiency.

“Automation is the key for Singapore’s logistics sector to cope with emerging patterns globally. The setup will be housed in Bolloré Logistics Green Hub, our high-tech logistic facility in Pioneer Turn, and we are happy to announce that the co-development of this automation has secured a long term commitment from LVMH. Bolloré Logistics strives to be at the forefront of innovation and prides itself in developing advanced supply chains for its customers,” said Cyril Dumon, CEO of Bolloré Logistics Asia Pacific.

“The close partnership between LVMH and Bolloré Logistics has strongly supported the growth of the business in the last 15 years. With the introduction of automation, it further reinforces our connections and emphasizes our expertise on safety, quality, service and efficiency for the next 10 years,” said Guillaume Mechain, Supply Chain Director of LVMH, Asia Pacific.

Collectively designed by Bolloré Logistics, LVMH and Dematic, this combination of multi-shuttle system and picking technology is the first of its kind to be deployed in Singapore and the region. The state-of-the-art facility will bring significant transformation to tackle supply chain operations - from the order preparation process, inbound to final dispatch of the orders, to integrating control checks that ensure greater accuracy.

It also allows Bolloré Logistics to meet new challenges arising from the emergence of e-commerce and increase of future distribution channels globally, by bringing with it the capability to prepare ecommerce orders with a high level of accuracy while reducing the time to market, thus increasing its agility and capacity to absorb peak level of activity. “Working closely together with Bolloré Logistics, we have developed an innovative automated solution that will bring tremendous improvements in productivity, accuracy and space efficiency. This project represents a number of industry firsts both in Singapore and in the Region and we are delighted to be involved with the Bolloré Logistics team in designing, delivering and supporting the project,” said Michael Bradshaw, Director Dematic SEA.

The facility will allow for higher storage density to make efficient use of limited warehouse space in Singapore. In terms of productivity, it will achieve throughput levels up to 10 times as compared to conventional methods, and will improve order lead time while using only half of the existing manpower resources."
