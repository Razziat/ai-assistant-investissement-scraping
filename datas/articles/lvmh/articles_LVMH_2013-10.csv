How LVMH Adapts To China's Evolving Luxury Market - Jing Daily,"Mon, 21 Oct 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vamluZ2RhaWx5LmNvbS9wb3N0cy9ob3ctbHZtaC1hZGFwdHMtdG8tY2hpbmFzLWV2b2x2aW5nLWx1eHVyeS1tYXJrZXTSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Chinese model Liu Wen in an ad for Louis Vuitton's Les Foulards D'Artistes artist scarf design collaboration.

Despite discussion that China’s economic growth may be picking up again after several months in slowdown mode, LVMH still posted lower-than-expected sales growth numbers for the third quarter last week that was due in large part to stagnant China numbers.

“Growth in mainland China for the group in Q3 was about 5 percent in local currency, which is better than what we had in Q2 but which is in line more or less in line with what we had in the first half of the year,” said LVMH CFO Jean-Jacques Guiony in a conference call last week.

Since the start of both slowing economic growth and China President Xi Jinping’s corruption crackdown, luxury brands such as Louis Vuitton have taken a hit in their previously booming China sales. Louis Vuitton's owner, conglomerate LVMH, has been particularly feeling the pain. Its shares have risen only “marginally ” higher since the beginning of 2013, while Cartier, Richemont, Burberry, and Kering have all seen shares rise by 20 percent.

One main reason for this is that a Chinese shift away from ostentatious logos, fueled by both the corruption crackdown as well as a shift in global trends, dented LVMH’s cash cow Louis Vuitton, which is known for its bags emblazoned with its iconic ""LV"" emblem.

The company has been making numerous efforts to respond to this issue. One main strategy has been to cut down on promoting its classic logo-printed leather goods, instead opting to advertise its low-key products, as was apparent in a recent Beijing store opening in which celebrity ambassadors showed up clad head-to-toe in LV, but with very few logos in sight.

This isn't the only move LVMH has made to respond to this issue in recent months, however. In fact, it has undertaken several additional strategies in the China market to reassert its exclusive brand image in China’s changing luxury landscape. Below is a list of some of its new strategies this year:

One major problem facing Louis Vuitton is the prevalence of fake bags readily available in China, which may have contributed to diluting the brand’s image. In order to combat this problem head-on, the company has signed an agreement with Alibaba to prevent the sale of counterfeit Louis Vuitton bags on its Taobao e-commerce site. Alibaba and Louis Vuitton signed a Memorandum of Understanding on October 11, 2013 that will include several preventive measures to stop fakes, such as a takedown system which will shut down the webpages selling them. The measure can’t do anything to stop people from going to the Silk Market, but it’s a start.

Because the shift away from logos is not just a Chinese, but a global phenomenon, Louis Vuitton has been touting a “vintage” image abroad to promote its brand heritage. However, the concept of “vintage” does not necessarily have the same connotations in China as in the United States, which prompted LV to use actress and brand ambassador Fan Bingbing (范冰冰) to promote the idea. ""These pieces are vintage style, and at the same time, very functional. I personally love the vintage style very much,"" said Fan at LV’s Beijing opening .

Although Fan has done a great deal of work for Louis Vuitton as a brand ambassador, the company has not used her as its sole representative in China, where some believe she may convey more of a mass-market than a luxury image. The company also hired Liu Wen (刘雯) for an ad campaign this year promoting its recent Les Foulards D'Artistes artist scarf design collaboration.

In the wake of the logo's decline, niche brands have been doing a lot better in terms of growth numbers than “mega-labels” such as Louis Vuitton, and it has been speculated that LVMH will go on a “buying spree ” to add to its already extensive list of luxury brands.

This has proven true so far in the world of beauty, as LVMH-backed L Capital Asia acquired Chinese beauty brand Marubi this July, with plans to sell its products in LVMH-owned Sephora.

According to Guiony, beauty has remained a bright spot for the conglomerate during the slowdown. He stated that in the third quarter, BeneFit cosmetics “made good progress in Asia, particularly among Chinese consumers.” Meanwhile, Louis Vuitton is planning to launch a perfume at some point in order to tap into the beauty market that has been helpful for companies such as Burberry and Chanel. In addition, the company’s ownership of Hong Kong-based duty-free retailer DFS, which sells a wide range of luxury brands that do not all fall under the LVMH umbrella, allows it to continue to diversify its profit model away from reliance on Louis Vuitton while still benefiting from the widening range of tastes among high-spending Chinese luxury consumers."
Marc Jacobs to Leave Louis Vuitton - The New York Times,"Wed, 02 Oct 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMTMvMTAvMDIvZmFzaGlvbi9tYXJjLWphY29icy10by1sZWF2ZS1sb3Vpcy12dWl0dG9uLmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS — The fashion designer Marc Jacobs is leaving Louis Vuitton after 16 years to concentrate on his namesake line, according to Bernard Arnault, the chairman and chief executive of LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, which has a majority stake in Mr. Jacobs’s company.

“When we started together, Marc Jacobs was a tiny little business of around $20 million,” Mr. Arnault said in an interview Wednesday. “Now the totality of sales is approaching $1 billion. It has been an enormous growth.”

“We left it to Marc and to Robert Duffy to decide when they wanted to concentrate on the brand,” he continued, referring to Mr. Jacobs’s business partner. “Now we have come to an agreement and the object is to assist them with an introduction on the bourse.” Mr. Arnault confirmed that the Marc Jacobs brand was working on an initial public offering.

And so, even as it loses its chief designer, LVMH will be poised to benefit from sharing in that potential billion-dollar payoff from Mr. Jacobs’s stock offering."

PARIS (Reuters) - Neverfull - the name of Louis Vuitton's best-selling handbag - sums up well its parent LVMH: even if it snapped up all of the world's last remaining independent luxury brands, it would still have room for more.

The French group's insatiable appetite for acquisitions has been tolerated by investors while its cash cow Louis Vuitton, which contributes half of group profit, grew revenues at a rate of more than 10 percent in the past two decades.

But this year Vuitton's sales growth halved as it failed to anticipate consumers' move away from logo-branded luxury goods, Chinese demand cooled and it put the brake on expansion. Uncertainty about the brand's future growth heightened further last week when a source close to LVMH said Vuitton's star designer Marc Jacobs was leaving.

With Vuitton in intensive care, investors are taking a harsher look at LVMH's other brands and growing concerned it will take years for them to provide alternative growth.

LVMH, the No.1 luxury goods group with more than 60 brands from Dior to Hennessy cognac, has never built a major brand from scratch and is one of the industry's worst stock market performers.

LVMH stock has nudged up just 5 percent since the start of the year, compared to a 20 percent share rise across the rest of the luxury goods sector. Meanwhile, the analyst consensus for LVMH's expected earnings per share (EPS) growth for 2013 is 6 percent, compared to 15 percent for the sector.

""LVMH has underperformed mainly because of big question marks hanging over the development strategy of Louis Vuitton,"" said Chicuong Dang, fund manager at French asset management firm KBL Richelieu.

Jacobs' departure, to take his eponymous own label public, is part of a series of leadership changes at Vuitton, the most significant in two decades, as it tries to reposition itself as a more exclusive, less ubiquitous brand.

In a sector where expectations of sales rather than earnings growth have tended to drive share performance, LVMH's main problem is that with Vuitton already making 7.3 billion euros in annual sales, it is too big to buy substantial growth.

Story continues

Rival Kering, owner of Gucci, has been able to get a bigger boost than LVMH from its other brands such as Bottega Veneta which makes revenues of around 1 billion euros and Yves Saint Laurent with sales of nearly 500 million euros because Gucci makes half of what Vuitton makes, or 3.6 billion euros.

Comparatively, LVMH's Celine and Fendi are estimated to make around 500 million euros while fast-growing Marc Jacobs makes nearly $1 billion in annual sales including license revenues - and some of those sales would be lost in the event of an IPO.

SLOW RETURNS

LVMH is unlikely to find the answer to faster growth among its smaller fashion brands such as Berluti, Kenzo, Givenchy, Donna Karan and Loewe. Though it is plowing millions of euros into their expansion, it could take a long time for some of them to have an impact on the group's sales growth profile - if ever.

Unlike Kering, LVMH never publishes sales or profit numbers for any of its brands and analysts question the profitability and growth prospects of several of its smaller ones. LVMH has recently started investing in budding fashion labels with the hope that one day they will become global brands.

The group recently gobbled up some of the world's most exclusive luxury names - Roman jeweler Bulgari in 2011 and Italian cashmere maker Loro Piana in July. But analysts say it will have to be patient before it gets a good return on such investments, which should be higher than the 10 percent weighted average cost of capital (WACC) in the luxury sector.

HSBC estimates it could take at least 10 years for LVMH to get proper returns on capital employed from Roman jeweler Bulgari, for which it paid 4.2 billion euros in 2011- 22 times earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) or core earnings, way above the industry average.

Other analysts wonder if LVMH could not have better used the 2 billion euros it spent on 80 percent of Italian cashmere maker Loro Piana - valuing it 19 times core earnings - as the brand will only boost LVMH's EPS by 1 percentage point from 2014.

LVMH declined a request to be interviewed for this report. It has a policy of never commenting on share price performance.

COSMETICS KEY TO GROWTH

Given that LVMH's existing drinks, watch and jewelry businesses are also leaders in their field, there remains only one area in which LVMH could still buy growth: cosmetics.

LVMH has small beauty brands Benefit, Nude and Make Up for Ever and has developed skincare lines for Dior and Guerlain.

But the theory goes that if it bought a top skincare brand, it could leverage its network of Sephora and duty-free shops and tap into China's booming skincare market - the prize for every big cosmetics group - and into rising tourist flows in Asia.

China's premium skincare market is set to nearly double between now and 2017 to reach 6 billion euros, according to data from Euromonitor International.

Hence investors' eagerness to see LVMH piggy-back Chinese cosmetics growth via the purchase of a major cosmetics brand.

""LVMH could create a (cosmetics) brand of its own but it would gain time if it bought an already existing brand,"" said one LVMH associate who declined to be named.

Targets in Europe include French family-owned Clarins, Sisley, Nuxe and Spain's Natura Bissé.

LVMH's Chief Financial Officer Jean-Jacques Guiony told analysts at the group's half-year results: ""Brands like Sisley and Clarins are not on the market, otherwise they could be interesting targets.""

But some observers say a deal could still be on the cards.

""Of course, none of these major cosmetics brands are for sale but in luxury, nothing is ever for sale. Loro Piana also was not for sale and suddenly Arnault bought it,"" said one financial adviser specialized in luxury and retail companies.

While Clarins, which makes annual sales of more than 1.2 billion euros, has stated it is not for sale, its decision this year to merge its perfume business, including Azzaro and Thierry Mugler scents, with its core skincare operations has lit speculation it could be sprucing itself up for a buyer.

""Everybody expects Clarins will be put on the market,"" said Francois Arpels, a managing director at investment bank Bryan, Garnier & Co in Paris. He added the merger between Clarins's two units will improve margins ""which would be good if there was a change in ownership.""

Arpels noted that Clarins still had a relatively small presence in China and the Courtin-Clarins family, who took the business private in 2008, ""have always let people know that eventually, they would be looking for a way to sell out.""

The Courtin-Clarins family declined to comment. ($1 = 0.7358 euros)

Louis Vuitton and Dior parent company sees sales growth lower than forecast - The Guardian,"Wed, 16 Oct 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy8yMDEzL29jdC8xNi9sb3Vpcy12dWl0dG9uLWRpb3Itc2FsZXMtZ3Jvd3RoLWxvd2VyLWx2bWjSAVtodHRwczovL2FtcC50aGVndWFyZGlhbi5jb20vYnVzaW5lc3MvMjAxMy9vY3QvMTYvbG91aXMtdnVpdHRvbi1kaW9yLXNhbGVzLWdyb3d0aC1sb3dlci1sdm1o?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Shares in the world's largest luxury goods group, LVMH, fell sharply on Wednesday as it reported slowing growth in sales of its designer clothes and monogrammed handbags.

The company behind Louis Vuitton and Dior said that sales in its high-profile fashion and leather goods division grew by 4% for the first nine months of the year, compared with 5% during the first half – and some analyst forecasts for growth of 10%.

Fashion sales were €7.1bn (£6bn) for the first nine months of the year out of total revenues of €20.7bn for the whole group, which also includes Guerlain perfume, Tag Heuer watches, Moët champagne and Hennessy cognac.

LVMH's share price dropped 6% on France's CAC 40 index on Wednesday as investors digested the unexpectedly poor performance.

The sales slowdown in fashion comes amid a major shake-up at the top of Louis Vuitton, following the decision of designer Marc Jacobs to leave the group to create his own label. Nicolas Ghesquière, the former creative director of Balenciaga, is rumoured to be replacing him, although the group is insisting that no decisions have been taken. Earlier this year, LVMH's founder and chief executive, Bernard Arnault, promoted his daughter Delphine Arnault, a former managing director at Dior, to be Louis Vuitton's second in command.

The slowdown did not affect demand for champagne: the group reported a strong rebound in champagne sales over the third quarter of the year, driven by a strong appetite for the drink in Asia and America.

The group also reported continued market share gains for its Sephora perfume shops, currently at the centre of a political row in France over the opening hours of its flagship store in Paris. Combined with strong performance from the group's duty free-retail shops, the retail division pulled in €6.3bn revenues, a 19% increase on last year.

Shares in luxury fashion group Burberry continued to fall on Wednesday after news of the departure of chief executive, Angela Ahrendts. In midmorning trading the company's shares were the biggest faller on the FTSE 100, dropping 2.5% to £14.28, after a 6% fall on Tuesday."

Louis Vuitton

LVMH bought the Bulgari space at 319 N. Rodeo for the landmark price of $85 million in 2012, doubling the footprint of the space at neighboring 295 N. Rodeo to 7,100 square feet and becoming one of the largest stores in the world. As for Bulgari, once new owner and landlord LVMH decided to move in, the Italian jeweler decamped two blocks north between Brighton and Santa Monica (401 N. Rodeo, the former DeBeers store).

Breguet

The luxe Swiss watchmaker opened its Beverly Hills store at 280 N. Rodeo in 2006, but on Oct. 3, the brand rolled out a new look. The cobalt blue walls are now all white, oval furniture replaced former heavier pieces, and the store was reformatted to fit more of its classic merchandise.

CH Carolina Herrera

Herrera already has her signature ladylike designer collection boutique on Melrose Place; CH, at 230 N. Rodeo, is her lower-priced line (Amy Adams and Kiernan Shipka are fans, and Sarah Hyland wore CH to the Emmys). “I always wait for the perfect place to open a store,” says Herrera. “So I was excited when this Rodeo Drive location was available. Rodeo epitomizes Beverly Hills: the palm trees, the clean white buildings and luxurious shopping.”

Ermenegildo Zegna

The Italian menswear brand is departing its 18-year-old space at 301 N. Rodeo. It will reopen its new Global Store at 337 N. Rodeo on Nov. 7, when Gildo Zegna and new design head Stefano Pilati (formerly of YSL) will debut Pilati’s first Zegna collection. The new store was designed by Peter Marino (who has created 16 Zegna concept stores around the world), with more than 5,800 square feet of selling space on three floors.

Burberry

The venerable British brand (pictured, left) will decamp from 9560 Wilshire to Zegna’s space at 301 N. Rodeo once it’s vacated and will open in fall 2014. The new space will be designed with creative director Christopher Bailey and include a bespoke experience of being able to create one’s own iconic trench coat. “Relocating to Rodeo has always been of interest to Burberry,” says Andrew Taylor, vp public relations, “and we were very patient to wait for the perfect piece of real estate.”

Tory Burch

Its West Coast global flagship at 366 N. Rodeo opens in November (with a Jan. 14 party to follow). The designer worked on the 4,800-square-foot space with architect Daniel Romualdez (hint: gold-leaf wallpaper, Moroccan mirrors). Red-carpet fans Reese Witherspoon and Mindy Kaling no doubt will like the private VIP room.

Saint Laurent

Creative director Hedi Slimane‘s current reboot of the Rodeo boutique at 326 N. Rodeo likely will suit his signature rock ‘n’ roll image. The fall collection now is being housed at temporary space 469 N. Rodeo (the old Missoni), with 5,000 square feet of black and white interiors by Slimane himself, and will relocate back to 326 in 2014.

Vera Wang

Wang is working with architect Brian Sawyer to create her first Beverly Hills flagship in 5,500 square feet at 428 N. Rodeo (after which she’ll shutter her 8445 Melrose Ave. space). Sofia Vergara and Kaley Cuoco, who wore Wang’s wares to the Emmys, will be happy to hear the store will open in February — just in time for awards season.

Chanel

The four-floor flagship (with VIP room) at 400 N. Rodeo, refreshed by Peter Marino in 2006, is so packed with tourists and locals, the French giant purchased the Lladro building next door at 408 N. Rodeo in May, reportedly paying $117 million for the 13,317-square-foot property — the highest per-square-foot retail sale in L.A. County. When finished, it is sure to welcome brand loyalists like Drew Barrymore. Down the block, French juggernaut Hermes reopened in early September after an 18-month hiatus and a $20 million investment, with swimming-pool blue-tiled floors and interiors designed by Rena Dumas. As for Lladro, the Spanish figurine brand is seeking a new home in Beverly Hills after selling its building to Chanel. Whether it will remain on Rodeo is the question. Either way, the $117 million payday will make that decision easier.

SAVE THE DATE: OCT. 10 to 13

Twenty premier watchmakers gather for three days of new product introductions — including Panerai’s Luminor Submersible model — and exhibitions. The fest, sponsored by The Hollywood Reporter, kicks off with an open house from 6 to 9 p.m. at Rodeo Drive and Brighton Way.

French fashion designer Marc Jacobs announced Wednesday he was leaving Louis Vuitton, owned by parent company LVMH, after a 16-year collaboration. The news coincides with Jacobs’ Louis Vuitton show on the last day of Paris fashion week.

Designer Marc Jacobs is to leave Louis Vuitton to concentrate on his own brand and a future stock exchange flotation, a report said on Wednesday.

The US designer and the chairman of Louis Vuitton parent company LVMH, Bernard Arnault, confirmed the end of his 16-year tenure at the French luxury brand to industry journal Women’s Wear Daily.

The news coincided with Jacobs’ Louis Vuitton show on the last day of Paris fashion week.

It follows contract negotiations between Jacobs, 50, whose contract had been due to expire at the end of the year, and Louis Vuitton and LVMH.

It is understood that the initial public offering (IPO), expected within the next three years, will require Jacobs to be fully focused on his own brand in order to ensure the highest possible valuation.

A successor has not been named but Louis Vuitton is understood to have held talks with former Balenciaga designer Nicolas Ghesquiere about succeeding Jacobs as artistic director, sources told WWD earlier.

It credited Jacobs with transforming Louis Vuitton from a “stodgy luggage house to a global fashion presence”.

Frenchman Ghesquiere parted company with Balenciaga in November 2012 following a 15-year tenure.

Marc Jacobs leaves Louis Vuitton - New York Post,"Wed, 02 Oct 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vbnlwb3N0LmNvbS8yMDEzLzEwLzAyL21hcmMtamFjb2JzLWxlYXZlcy1sb3Vpcy12dWl0dG9uL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS — Marc Jacobs, the star designer who turned Louis Vuitton from a staid luggage-maker into a global fashion brand, is leaving to focus on his own eponymous label, a source close to the French company’s parent LVMH said on Wednesday.

The move follows a series of leadership changes at Louis Vuitton, LVMH’s cash cow and biggest profit- and revenue- contributor, aimed at helping the brand regain some of its lost prestige after a sustained decline in sales over the past year.

“Marc Jacobs is leaving Vuitton and will focus on his own brand,” the source said on condition of anonymity.

LVMH and Marc Jacobs declined to comment.

Jacobs’ departure comes a month after LVMH founder and chief executive Bernard Arnault appointed his daughter Delphine as deputy head of Louis Vuitton and replaced last year longstanding chief Yves Carcelle with group veteran Michael Burke.

Louis Vuitton, which built its name and profitability on its LV-embossed canvas bags, has been suffering from cooling demand in Asia and consumers’ growing preference for no-logo products.

Over the past year, the brand has put brakes on its expansion, contributing to its sales growth halving to around 5 percent and last month, it hired accessories designer Darren Spaziani, ex-Proenza Schouler, to beef up its high-end offering of leather bags.

Nicolas Ghesquiere, a darling of fashion editors, who left Balenciaga last year after having successfully revamped the Kering fashion brand, is seen as a frontrunner to replace Jacobs.

“It would be a positive sign if Ghesquiere joined Louis Vuitton as he is one of the most coveted designers today and he would give a creative jolt to the brand,” said David Da Maia, analyst at brokerage Aurel BGC in Paris.

Arnault has been regularly changing the creative and management teams of his fashion brands to refresh the style and drive expansion.

LVMH’s Celine has been going from strength to strength since award-winning designer Phoebe Philo took its creative helm in 2008 while Riccardo Tisci has brought new vitality to Givenchy since his appointment in 2005.

Jacobs, whose theatrical fashion shows contributed to heightening the brand’s profile, introduced collaborations with artists such as Richard Prince, Takashi Murakami and Stephen Sprouse and recently rapper Kanye West to help make the brand more relevant to fashion followers.

SWAN SONG

Marc Jacobs on Wednesday presented his last collection for Louis Vuitton, an all-black swan song that incorporated elements from his past shows such as the train station he famously reconstituted and the slow-turning white carousel carrying models, including Kate Moss, two years ago.

Today, the Marc Jacobs brand and particularly its more accessible line Marc by Marc Jacobs, are among the most profitable fashion subsidiaries within LVMH, enjoying strong demand in the United States and Japan.

Marc Jacobs also launched a cosmetics products line in August in the United States, with exclusive distribution handled by Sephora, LVMH’s beauty products retail chain.

Media reports said the designer aimed to float his business – which is estimated to generate sales of around 500 million euros – on the New York Stock Exchange within a few years.

Some industry observers suggest Marc Jacobs has been emboldened by the success of Michael Kors, the U.S. brand whose shares and sales have been enjoying stellar growth since the initial public offering late last year.

At the age of 24, Jacobs was the youngest designer to receive the New Fashion Talent award from the Council of Fashion Designers of America. After graduating from the Parsons New School of Design, Jacobs worked for Perry Ellis after the designer passed away and shortly thereafter created his own label in 1984 with partner Robert Duffy.

He became Louis Vuitton’s artistic director in 1997.

When Dior sacked John Galliano two years ago after a video showed him making antisemitic comments in a Paris bar, Jacobs was one of the leading contenders to replace him but according to reports, talks fell through over terms. In the end, Dior took more than a year to appoint Raf Simons as its new designer."

PUNE: French wine and spirits maker Moet-Hennessy will launch its first ‘made in India’ sparkling wine in the next few days, persons familiar with the matter said.Moet-Hennessy is an arm of French luxury group LVMH.In India, it has a short-term contract with Nashik-based York winery and is setting up its own winery at Dindori in Nashik district. Moet Hennessy India did not confirm the launch.“We are under embargo from Paris to talk about the launch,” said its public relations manager. However, York winery director Ravi Gurnani said Moet is using its facility on contract for making sparkling wine. “Our contract with Moet is for a short term,” he added. Industry executives said Moet’s Nashik wine would carry the ‘Chandon’ tag.The company is expected to begin crushing from its Indian winery from the 2014 grapecrushing season, joining the list of foreign winemakers who are tapping the growing demand for international brands in India.Sparkling wine, used in India mostly during celebrations, constitutes less than 10 per cent of the wine consumption in the country.But a growth in the affluent class is pushing up its demand, creating room for more labels besides Sula and Zampa. Overall wine consumption in India is growing at 15-20 per cent per annum. “There is scope for new players in the sparkling wine segment due to its shortage in the country,” said Arjunsinh Mohite Patil, director of Fratelli Wines , an Indian company with two Italian stakeholders.The joint venture launched its first sparkling wine last month. “The launch of Moet’s sparkling wine in India is a prestigious event for the Indian wine industry,” said Rajesh Jadhav, secretary, All India Wine Producers’ Association . “It shows that there is huge scope for growth of wine industry in India and that it has a great future.”"

PARIS: Marc Jacobs has stepped down as the creative designer of Louis Vuitton after 16 years to concentrate on his own label.Jacobs had been working with LVMH, the owner of luxury brands such as Louis Vuitton and Moet & Chandon, and the flamboyant designer now wants to focus on an IPO for his Marc Jacobs brand, reported New York Times from Paris.Bernard Arnault, the chairman of the luxury conglomerate LVMH, said that the company has come to an agreement with Jacobs and that it plans to take the Marc Jacobs company public possibly within the next three years.The Marc Jacobs business has been majority owned by LVMH for the last decade, and a public offering was described as a strategy to separate Jacobs business from LVMH without requiring the designer to raise equity or take on other partners.""When we started together, Marc Jacobs was a tiny little business of around $20 million. Now the totality of sales is approaching $1 billion. It has been an enormous growth,"" Arnault said.Jacobs, 50, and Arnault attended the company's fashion show in Paris on Wednesday morning as the news of Jacobs' departure emerged.It was clear to guests the moment they walked into the show that it was intended as a statement that it was Jacobs' last.Inside a large tent built especially for the show was a stage that included several elements from Jacobs' elaborate shows of seasons past -- a functional carousel on one side, a bubbling fountain on the other, as well as escalators, two antique elevators and a large railway station clock. All of it was painted black.The show was also an exquisite romp through the history of Jacobs' at Vuitton, described by the designer as a tribute ""to the showgirl in all of us"".Jacobs was ebullient, but did not comment on his exit, beyond saying, ""Farewell? I never say farewell.""The company is now reportedly eyeing former Balenciaga designer Nicolas Ghesquiere for the position."
2% of Chinese people consume 1/3 of world's luxury items - China.org,"Tue, 08 Oct 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQGh0dHA6Ly93d3cuY2hpbmEub3JnLmNuL2J1c2luZXNzLzIwMTMtMTAvMDgvY29udGVudF8zMDIyNDY0MC5odG3SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"China's insatiable obsession with high-end luxury items has helped groups like LVMH and Richemont to boom. [Chen Boyuan / China.org.cn]

Some 27 million Chinese people, or two percent of the country's total population, are reportedly consuming one third of the world's luxury items, including cosmetic products, private jets, jewellery, timepieces and leather products.

LVMH, Richemont and Kering are the world's top three luxury groups, which in total control more than half of the global market for luxury items. The rest of the market is occupied by major listed companies, such as Prada, Hermès and Coco Chanel, which have each reported annual sales of 3 billion euros.

These first-tier luxury makers all target China as a fast rising market for future growth, and they are expected to expand their presence in the Asia-Pacific region in the next three to five years, according to predictions by research institutes.

Management consulting company A.T.Kearney's Shanghai office found that brands such as Louis Vuitton and Gucci earn more than 30 percent of their revenues from Chinese customers.

Chinese travellers who often venture abroad will notice that many luxury boutiques have started to accept China UnionPay credit cards, and now employ sales assistants who are fluent in Mandarin.

Thanks to the Chinese craze for luxury goods, LVMH's market value reached 604.9 billion yuan (US$99.16 billion) in late September, even higher than China's leading petrol chemical company Sinopec, which had a value of 514.1 billion yuan. Other top luxury makers also reportedly beat leading Chinese companies in the banking and power generation sectors."

NEW DELHI: The spat between LVMH-owned private equity firm L Capital Asia and Genesis Colors may lead to Sephora , a beauty products retailer owned by the French luxury goods company, finding itself a new franchise partner in India. Sephora is currently in talks with DLF Brands, according to two people with direct knowledge of the situation.Singapore-based L Capital Asia asked Genesis Colors to buy back the 40 per cent stake that the PE firm holds in Genesis Luxury, ET reported on September 25.Sephora is currently sold in India by Genesis. ET had also reported that L Capital asked Genesis Luxury to get its accounts audited by one of the Big Four firms and said that the private equity firm believes that the management of the company is indifferent to its suggestions.Genesis Luxury, founded by former Citibank executive Sanjay Kapoor , markets several top luxury brands in India such as Jimmy Choo and Armani.One of the persons cited above said Sephora is expected to sign a deal with DLF in the coming weeks. Dipak Agarwal, chief executive of DLF Brands, and Karishma M Bedi, country manager for Sephora in India, declined to comment. Genesis did not respond to an e-mailed questionnaire sent on Thursday.Genesis opened the first Sephora store in New Delhi’s Select Citywalk mall last year. Genesis Colors was founded in 2001 and is primarily involved in the marketing of three brands — Satya Paul , Tie Rack, and lingerie brand Bwitch.In 2008, the company began the marketing and distribution of international luxury brands through its unit Genesis Luxury, which currently has either joint ventures or franchisee deals with Armani, Burberry, Bottega Veneta Canali , Furla and Michael Kors among others.The Genesis-L Capital spat is the latest of several such feuds between Indian retailers and PE investors. Last year, PE investors, including TPG Capital and Bain Capital, accused Lilliput Kidswear of financial mismanagement and dragged founder Sanjeev Narula to court.Earlier this year, Catmoss Retail was accused by its investor SAIF Partners of similar wrongdoing.In 2009, ICICI Venture asked the Chennai office of the Registrar of Companies to probe Subhiksha Trading Services, alleging operational as well as financial mismanagement at the defunct discount retailer, in which the PE firm held a 23 per cent stake.image Courtesy: Flickr"
