L Capital Invests $19 Million in Indian Theatrical Chain PVR Ltd. - Hollywood Reporter,"Thu, 02 Aug 2012 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvbGx5d29vZHJlcG9ydGVyLmNvbS9uZXdzL2dlbmVyYWwtbmV3cy9sLWNhcGl0YWwtaW52ZXN0cy0xOS1taWxsaW9uLTM1NzQ3MC_SAVxodHRwczovL3d3dy5ob2xseXdvb2RyZXBvcnRlci5jb20vbmV3cy9nZW5lcmFsLW5ld3MvbC1jYXBpdGFsLWludmVzdHMtMTktbWlsbGlvbi0zNTc0NzAvYW1wLw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"NEW DELHI – L Capital Eco Ltd, a subsidiary of the $ 640-million global private equity (PE) firm L Capital Asia, will invest about $19 million (Rupees 1.08 billion) in exchange for a 10 percent stake in theatrical major PVR Ltd. New Delhi-based PVR opened India’s first multiplex in 1996 and now runs 179 screens across 24 cities. PVR is looking at setting up 500 screens across the country by the end of 2014.

L Capital Asia is backed by Louis Vuitton Moët Hennessy (LVMH) – the world’s biggest luxury goods group – and Group Arnault. This is L Capital’s third investment in India after it picked up an eight percent stake in lifestyle retail chain Fabindia and a 40 percent buyout in two tranches in Genesis Luxury Fashion which has local partnerships for various international brands such as Canali, Paul Smith and Jimmy Choo.

“We are inducting L Capital as a strategic investor to grow our business. The firm will pick up 10 percent stake in PVR Ltd under the preferential allotment route,” said PVR Ltd chairman and MD Ajay Bijli. “Besides, L Capital will enter into a joint-venture agreement and invest in a new subsidiary being set up by PVR to grow footprint in the retail space. L Capital has a strong global reach and has already made introduction to multiple international entertainment, leisure and food and beverage (F&B) concepts. With their active involvement, we expect to bring these concepts to India.”

Under the agreement, L Capital – through an investment of Rupees 577 million – would subscribe to 2.88 million equity shares in PVR at a price of Rupees 200 per equity share (a premium of about 21 percent over the closing stock price of Rupees 165.95 on the National Stock Exchange on July 31).

The joint venture to invest in various in-mall entertainment, gaming, food and leisure formats will see L Capital initially investing Rupees 501 million into a new subsidiary being set up by PVR. The theatre chain’s existing investment in PVR Blu-O Entertainment Ltd (its bowling alley joint venture with Thailand’s Major Cineplex Group) will now be held through this new subsidiary company. The formation of the joint venture is subject to approval by India’s Foreign Investment Promotion Board.



Meanwhile, PVR released its financial results for the quarter ending June 30 reporting that its net profit declined 64.5 percent to Rupees 79.8 million. In the same period last year, PVR reported a net profit of Rupees 224.7 million, a large chunk of which was due to the sale and lease back of PVR’s Phoenix Mills property in Mumbai. “If you compare on a like-to-like basis our net profit has increased from Rupees 50 million to Rupees 79.8 million,” clarified Bijli. Total income from operations increased 51.6 percent to Rupees 1.58 billion against Rupees 1.04 billion a year ago. PVR shares closed at Rupees 185.40 on the Bombay Stock Exchange on Wednesday, 12.6 percent higher than the previous close."
L Capital in talks with top fashion designers to setup LVMH clone in India - The Economic Times,"Mon, 06 Aug 2012 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMitgFodHRwczovL20uZWNvbm9taWN0aW1lcy5jb20vaW5kdXN0cnkvY29ucy1wcm9kdWN0cy9mYXNoaW9uLS8tY29zbWV0aWNzLS8tamV3ZWxsZXJ5L2wtY2FwaXRhbC1pbi10YWxrcy13aXRoLXRvcC1mYXNoaW9uLWRlc2lnbmVycy10by1zZXR1cC1sdm1oLWNsb25lLWluLWluZGlhL2FydGljbGVzaG93LzE1MzY4MDY4LmNtc9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"NEW DELHI: Private equity firm L Capital is in talks with top Indian designers to create an Indian luxury house loosely resembling its parent - the Paris-based world's biggest maker of luxury goods, LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton.



The firm, an inveterate dealmaker in India in the past year, is close to signing up two of the country's top fashion designers - Rohit Bal and Sabyasachi Mukherjee - along with specialist multi-designer retailer Evoluzione for the venture, which, while consolidating their separate labels under a single corporate structure, is aimed at giving each of them a serious shot at scaling up domestically and globally.



L Capital plans to invest close to Rs 200 crore in the venture, which is being planned as a company that will own significant minority stakes in the design houses of these well-known designers and will forge a joint venture with Evoluzione for back-end distribution business, several people familiar with the transaction told ET.



More designers are expected to come into the orbit of the new company in due course, a person involved in the transaction said, requesting anonymity. ""In time, the structure will attract other younger designers and L Capital will integrate them into the platform by taking majority stakes,"" the person said.



Bal and Mukherjee confirmed talks with L Capital, but declined to share details citing non-disclosure agreements. The owner of Evoluzione, Atul Malhotra, also confirmed discussions, but said no deal has been finalised. L Capital's regional managing director, Sanjay Gujral confirmed that they are working on a deal, but declined to share details.



L Capital, which has been involved in a string of minority stake purchases in companies such as Fabindia, PVR and Genesis Luxury in the past year, has previously expressed its keenness to invest in Indian fashion, possibly even taking some Indian brands global. An LVMH-type structure in India is expected to aid in consolidating and projecting Indian fashion to the world, besides helping brands with marketing, retailing and identifying suitable real estate to increase scale, pare costs, improve operating efficiency and boost profits. LVMH is a $29-billion conglomerate of more than 60 subsidiaries handling a galaxy of top brands such as Louis Vuitton, Bvlgari, Givenchy, Dior, Moet Chandon and Tag Heuer, each managed separately and often in competition with each other.



Sourcing from China



The designers in the Indian venture could also benefit from sourcing from markets such as China, where L Capital has recently invested in two large Chinese fashion companies, Xinhe and Trendy International Group.



Evoluzione, with presence in markets such as Delhi, Chennai and Bangalore, will get reliability of supplies and better sharing of margins. For L Capital, a platform such as the one being planned will give the group a significant foothold in the fledgling Indian fashion business, and facilitate its growth in India and abroad.



Indian designers, famed for their intricate patterns, have long had large public profiles relative to the size of their businesses. A couple of decades old, the industry has made some mark on the international fashion scene too, with designers such as Mukherjee, Bal, Ritu Beri and Tarun Tahiliani finding global traction.

Delhi-based Bal, known for his stylish cuts and breathing fabrics, has famously clothed Hollywood actress Uma Thurman and model Cindy Crawford while Kolkatabased Mukherjee is known for blending ethnic patterns with the modern, especially in his saris made for Bollywood celebrities.



However, the size of India’s fashion industry still remains at just around Rs 750-1,000 crore, with most large fashion designers grossing turnovers of between Rs 50 to Rs 150 crore. The Chinese fashion industry in comparison, stood at $63 billion (including luxury and fashion) at the end of 2010 and is expected to triple by 2020, according to figures from the Boston Consulting Group.



“Size of businesses is an issue for sure in the Indian fashion industry and will require significant investment in capital and critical capabilities like sourcing, supply chain, distribution and governance to scale up,” says Neelesh



Hundekari, head, luxury and lifestyle at global consultancy AT Kearney. Although rising affluence among the middle classes has made Indian designers more mainstream, they have not been able to capitalise on this. Most designers, even the more established ones, have just a few stores.



“Indian designers need much more capital than they have right now to expand pan-India. For a long time designers were restricted to Mumbai and Delhi, but given the potential in at least 30 cities of India, there is a need to expand,” said Pradeep Hirani, chairman of Kimaya Fashions, which sold a 20 per cent stake to Franklin Templeton Private Equity Strategy for Rs 60 crore last year. A grouping like the one being put together by L Capital could expand the businesses of these designers in the domestic market, and later even internationally using the LVMH global network.



“This is a great opportunity for the industry as individually it will be difficult for these designers to attract the right quality of capital that can take a longer term view,” says one of the persons involved in the transaction. Besides helping them grow in the upscale segment, synergies and cost savings by being part of such a grouping could help Indian designers go more mainstream.



“Cheaper sourcing from markets like China or elsewhere can bring down the cost for designers, especially for prêt-à-porter (ready-to-wear)” said Sunil Sethi, president of the Fashion Design Council of India."

Ogilvy & Mather is repitching for the account.

Ogilvy & Mather Paris won the global Louis Vuitton account in December 2006 after a pitch against the incumbent, BETC, and TBWA\London.

Louis Vuitton, which is part of the LVMH luxury goods conglomerate, is known for featuring high-profile celebrities in its ad campaigns.

The brand’s latest signing is Michael Phelps, the swimmer and world’s most decorated Olympian, who features in a newly released print ad, shot by Annie Leibovitz.

Ogilvy & Mather created a TV spot for the brand last month featuring Yasiin Bey. In the film, Bey recites some of Muhammad Ali’s famous speeches.

In April last year, Louis Vuitton paid Angelina Jolie more than £6 million to be the face of the label. The amount was thought to be a record for a single ad campaign."

National Tennis Center. The games are expected to bring some 650,000 spectators to Flushing Meadows, Queens, where top-tier sponsors like Moët & Chandon, Mercedes-Benz, Evian, and Heineken are staging activations to promote their products.

Moët & Chandon

After marking its first year as the official champagne for the competition with company tennis matches in its west Chelsea office, Moët & Chandon is building a lounge on the grounds of the tennis center in Queens.

Heineken

The U.S. Open and Heineken partnership goes way back: In 2012 the beer brand marks its 21st year as a sponsor of the event. The theme behind this year is to master the serve—on the tennis court and behind the bar. To kick it off, Heineken hosted an August 21 event at the Penthouse at Dream, where guests were shown how to perfect the four-step pour of the Dutch brew. To add a little healthy competition to the event, Heineken draught master Franck Evers went head-to-head against Bob and Mike Bryan, London Olympic gold medalists and brothers.

Raf Simons Kissed His Models Good Luck Before His First Dior Show - Vanity Fair,"Fri, 24 Aug 2012 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZhbml0eWZhaXIuY29tL3N0eWxlLzIwMTIvMDkvcmFmLXNpbW9ucy1kaW9yLWJhY2tzdGFnZS1jb3V0dXJl0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Of all the couture houses in Paris, the plum is Christian Dior. Perhaps it’s the symbolism, the way the house blossomed from nothing in 1947, in the wake of World War II. Or that its debut line, Corolle, reimagined women as flowers and suddenly the Western world was a garden of bell shapes and full skirts, with women loving the way they looked and felt in Dior’s deep curves formed from yards and yards of silk. It was a profound moment that lasted 10 years—a dec­ade, then, in which Dior was the king of fashion and his business empire accounted for a healthy percentage of France’s export revenue. Since Dior’s death, in 1957, the appointment of every successive house designer has seemed an affair of state—1957: Yves Saint Laurent; 1960: Marc Bohan; 1989: Gianfranco Ferré; 1996: John Galliano; 2012: Raf Simons.

It is said that Monsieur Dior could hear an apple ripen on a tree. Would he ever have guessed that a man who began his career in industrial design would take over the garden of earthly delights that is Dior? Simons left interior design because working alone didn’t suit him—he preferred the esprit de corps of collaboration. In 1995 he began designing men’s wear in his native Belgium, and in 2005 he was hired to re-invigorate Jil Sander. Command, control, process, thought. His shows became famous for their pin-drop quiet and the soft, rapturous rain of cameras clicking. Forget nostalgia, vintage sighs, and postmodern appropriation. Simons is a modernist with a love of the new—and the cultural map to find it. “I never would make direct references,” he has said. No. He produces beautiful clothes that have never been seen before. And now, at 44, he has Dior, along with its imposing archive of archetypes. Bernard Arnault, chairman and C.E.O. of LVMH, has said Simons was the only man for the job. His debut on July 2 took place throughout several rooms of an hôtel particulier wallpapered with a million flowers—roses, delphiniums, peonies, and orchids. The gesture was not lost on the guests: embellishment was on the walls, not the dresses. But glowing, growing from within Simons’s curvilinear gowns and jackets were the rounded volumes of Corolle—so light, so pure, so full of the future."
"De Beers Opens Fourth China Location, Debuts Shanghai Exclusives - Jing Daily","Fri, 31 Aug 2012 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vamluZ2RhaWx5LmNvbS9wb3N0cy9kZS1iZWVycy1vcGVucy1mb3VydGgtY2hpbmEtbG9jYXRpb24tZGVidXRzLXNoYW5naGFpLWV4Y2x1c2l2ZXPSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"With China, India and the Middle East poised to collectively take over the US in diamond purchases by 2015, major diamond miners and jewelers have continued to invest heavily in marketing and expansion, with China becoming a particular point of focus in recent years. Steadily growing middle-class demand, as well as regular bidding at auction on rarer and larger pieces, has enticed most of the world’s major diamond brands to enter the mainland China market or, at least, Hong Kong, creating a retail battleground in cities like Shanghai and Beijing. To set themselves apart from the pack and get in front of Chinese consumers, Van Cleef & Arpels recently launched a Shanghai exhibition of 370 rare pieces from its archives at the Shanghai Museum of Contemporary Art, while Harry Winston flew in “Gossip Girl” stars Leighton Meester and Ed Westwick to inaugurate its first flagship in Shanghai and Hong Kong-based Chow Sang Sang announced plans to open 50 new stores in the Mainland within the next “one to two years.”

Despite broader concerns about discretionary luxury purchases by middle-class Chinese this year, amid an environment of cooler economic growth, global diamond leader De Beers has no intention of falling further behind these and other competitors in China. Recently, De Beers opened its newest China location, its fourth, at Shanghai IFC in the city's Pudong district. Located in the mall's fine jewelry section, the 75 square meter glass-and-light-filled store is designed to dazzle, featuring the Talisman Crown -- designed to celebrate Queen Elizabeth's Diamond Jubilee -- and the Talisman Wonder. To celebrate the opening, De Beers also created a set of eight special-edition Talisman Medals, each made up of rough diamonds arranged within a handcrafted serti-poinçon textured white, yellow or pink gold surrounding a central diamond setting.

As De Beers chief exec François Delage said at the opening, ''We are proud to continue to build the brand in China with the opening of our first store in Shanghai after the successful openings in Beijing, Tianjin and Dalian.''

According to De Beers Group CEO Philippe Mellier, De Beers hopes to open “at least five” new stores in China this year, so it's got four more to go before hitting that goal. As Mellier put it at this year’s Reuters Mining & Metals Summit, ”We are looking at expanding our shops in continental China big time in 2012…We are growing the business where the biggest growth is – in Asia.”

Currently, the Group’s 50/50 LVMH Moet Hennessy joint venture diamond jewelry business has 49 stores around the world, and with sales of US$7 billion a year, De Beers now accounts for 10 percent of the total global diamond industry. In mainland China, however, the brand is still comparatively new, having opened its first location at Beijing’s Shin Kong Place last June . As part of its push to attract more Chinese consumers, De Beers has also indicated that it plans to upgrade its flagship stores in London and New York — regular stops for wealthy outbound Chinese tourist-shoppers. While this, and the brand’s overall China expansion effort, is important, an expected slowdown in the luxury industry growth rate in China this year and an increasingly crowded jewelry market there means De Beers will likely need to kick up its digital marketing efforts and figure out how to court “entry-level” middle-class buyers in Xi’an, Kunming and Harbin as well as ultra-wealthy Beijingers on New York shopping sprees."

The duty free operator opened its first store in 1960 at Hong Kong International Airport and followed that with high street stores on Mody Rd in 1988 and Canton Rd in 1996.

The store called Traveler’s Galleria – or simply T Galleria – is described by DFS as “a tribute to DFS’ understanding of the needs of global travellers”.

The store spans two levels: the first focuses on prestige beauty, offering a new collection of beauty brands through a complete selection of cosmetics, skin care and fragrances.

The second level is characterised by a luxury boutique environment, which houses a tailored selection of 15 brands of watches and jewellery.

“This city is our home, and we really have come full circle with the opening of T Galleria on the island of Hong Kong, only months after also winning three awards in the main Hong Kong International Airport,” said Philippe Schaus, CEO of DFS Group.

Hong Kong-headquartered DFS Group has over 200 stores in 15 countries, mostly in cosmopolitan and resort locations in Asia-Pacific, North America and Middle East.

Mother Earth plans to open more than 100 outlets and focus on apparel, linens and accessories, which will be also sold in multi-branded department stores such as Shoppers Stop and Lifestyle, with an aim to increase its annual sales more than five fold, a top official said. At present, Mother Earth has eight stores selling products in the furniture and handicrafts segment with revenues of less than 100 crore.""The model is kind of a Fabindia 2.0 but with few other product categories too,"" said Neelam Chibber , MD of Mother Earth, which gets half of its merchandise coming from self-help groups that the company incubates internally and the remaining from NGOs and independent artisans.That's exactly the model that Fabindia has been following for more than five decades.""While we launched our first store in 2009, we wanted to get our sourcing and back-end right before expanding aggressively,"" Chibber said.Mother Earth was co-founded over 15 years ago by craft activists Gita Ram and Neelam Chibber to tap into the market of handloom fabrics produced by artisans from rural India. Kishore Biyani's Future Ventures invested in the company in 2009.The company is now remodeling itself on the lines of Fabindia, through newer stores and categories as well as sourcing.Fabindia-in which the world's largest luxury goods group LVMH's private equity arm L Capital has bought an 8% stake-is one of the most profitable retailers in the country with net margins of 8%-10% on revenues of more than 500 crore.""Consumers are even willing to pay extra if then know that products are ethically sourced. So more than demand, its consumer preparedness that is already there in India,"" Shatadru Chattopadhyay, who heads global sustainability advocacy firm Solidaridad, said. ""Fabindia is doing a good job in terms of sourcing...companies need to communicate this to consumers as there is always a business logic in sustainability,"" he said.Artisans from 212 districts supply ethnic garments, furniture and other merchandise stocked in 162 Fabindia stores.Mother Earth works extensively with the government to reach out to over 20,000 women, and they are also working on a special purpose vehicle project with the government in Narsapur with access to over 15,000 crochet artisans to build scale in sourcing.Given the ambitious plans, funds will be a constraint too. Hence, Mother Earth is looking to cash on the rising consumer spend on ethnic apparel and is in talks with private equity firms to raise funds for its expansion.Experts estimate that the market for social and environment-friendly products is more than $6 billion (approx 33,000 crore) each year and India is picking up the trend quite rapidly.""We have found out that over 70% of Indian consumers will buy environment products over other branded merchandise if quality is maintained,"" said Seth Petchers, chief executive officer at Shop For Change - Fair Trade, a body that certify products on ethical standards. ""The opportunity is huge and products are being accepted as consumers are made aware on where these products are available,"" he said.Mother Earth's Neelam said the potential market for such products in India is over 10,000 crore but there is not enough supply to meet such demand. ""With Mother Earth products planning to be retailed at a mass-premium range in most multi-branded outlets and stand-alone stores across India, it should be able to carve out an independent identity,"" said Neelam, an industrial designer from National Institute of Design and alumnus of Social Impact International."
