LVMH CEO sees warnings signs flashing in the luxury sector - CNBC,"Fri, 27 Jan 2017 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tLzIwMTcvMDEvMjcvbHZtaC1jZW8tc2Vlcy13YXJuaW5ncy1zaWducy1mbGFzaGluZy1pbi10aGUtbHV4dXJ5LXNlY3Rvci5odG1s0gFjaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY25iYy5jb20vYW1wLzIwMTcvMDEvMjcvbHZtaC1jZW8tc2Vlcy13YXJuaW5ncy1zaWducy1mbGFzaGluZy1pbi10aGUtbHV4dXJ5LXNlY3Rvci5odG1s?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"When things are going well, companies often tout their accomplishments and expect the fun to never end.

Not LVMH Moet Hennessy Chairman and Chief Executive Bernard Arnault.

In the company's latest earnings call, Arnault sounded the warnings bells that the good times might be over in the luxury sector.

""Over a 10-year period, normally, there are eight good years and two not so good years or even a very bad year. Now, we're coming to the end of the 10-year period,"" Arnault said, noting that the last major crisis dates to 2008.

And it's not just a matter of timing, Arnault cited several situations that could change investor and consumer sentiment. Among them, the likelihood that interest rates will rise, the ""exuberance"" with which stocks are rising and a ""geopolitical situation that's difficult to read.""

The CEO went on to say that he has conveyed to his teams that they should plan the year with great caution and be ""very vigilant.""

""Geopolitical economic events ... might unfold in a way that isn't particularly helpful,"" he said. ""We really need to be prudent.""

Arnault's comments followed a quarter in which the company's net profit in the second half jumped 14 percent from the year-earlier period, boosted by solid sales across its brands, which include luxury labels Louis Vuitton and Fendi, Bulgari jewelry, and cosmetics retailer Sephora.

The positive earnings news sent LVMH shares to an all-time high on Thursday.

Arnault expects the first half of 2017 to be relatively positive as the company faces lower hurdles than in first half of 2016, but the situation could change quickly in the second half of the year."
LVMH CEO: I’m More Concerned About Marc Jacobs Than Trump - Hollywood Reporter,"Thu, 26 Jan 2017 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvbGx5d29vZHJlcG9ydGVyLmNvbS9saWZlc3R5bGUvc3R5bGUvbHZtaC1jZW8taS1tLW1vcmUtY29uY2VybmVkLW1hcmMtamFjb2JzLXRydW1wLTk2OTA0MS_SAWtodHRwczovL3d3dy5ob2xseXdvb2RyZXBvcnRlci5jb20vbGlmZXN0eWxlL3N0eWxlL2x2bWgtY2VvLWktbS1tb3JlLWNvbmNlcm5lZC1tYXJjLWphY29icy10cnVtcC05NjkwNDEvYW1wLw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LVMH CEO Bernard Arnault on Thursday afternoon expressed his concerns about Marc Jacobs, a brand under the LVMH umbrella. Just how worried is he?

“I’m more concerned about Marc Jacobs than the U.S. president,” he said during a conference call to investors, according to Quartz fashion reporter Marc Bain. (Arnault met with Trump two weeks ago at Trump Tower to discuss manufacturing in the U.S.)

“I’m more concerned about Marc Jacobs than the US president.” – LVMH CEO Bernard Arnault on conference call a few minutes ago (MJ is in red) — Marc Bain (@marcbain_) January 26, 2017

While Arnault’s ensuing discussion of LVMH earnings centered more on the future of the luxury conglomerate’s U.S. sales (Louis Vuitton, Dior and Fendi are just a few of the luxury houses under Arnault’s purview), the assertion could shed light on the future of Marc Jacobs, which is currently in the red.

The brand’s rapid expansion, which followed a period of steady growth in the 1990s and early 2000s and included the launch of the Marc by Marc Jacobs line in 2001 as well as cosmetics and fragrances, may have been a bit more than the brand should have bit off. Marc Jacobs International briefly considered an IPO in 2014 after sales were lower than expected. However, the company ultimately stayed with LVMH.

In 2015, the Marc by Marc line was shuttered in what was called a streamlining process. (As seems to be an industrywide trend, however, the beauty collections reported a strong performance in 2016.)

The statement by Arnault — France’s richest man — may be more telling about his confidence in President Trump than his fears about Jacobs. He went on to say that as far as Trump’s leadership is concerned, he’s fairly optimistic about the future — particularly with regards to lowered taxes and deregulation. “I think, as things stand now, things are in our favor,” said Arnault, though he cautioned that the second half of 2017 may be a bit rocky. “Despite the fact that the signals have been fairly positive since the start of the year, I am extremely cautious for 2017. In my opinion, it’s always when things are going well that something unexpected happens.”

LVMH reported record-breaking revenue of $41 billion in 2016, with 9 percent organic growth in the fashion division in the fourth quarter."
"In the name of animal rights, PETA bought a stake in luxury leather brand Louis Vuitton - Quartz","Fri, 13 Jan 2017 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vcXouY29tLzg4NTAyMi9wZXRhLWJvdWdodC1hLXN0YWtlLWluLWx1eHVyeS1sZWF0aGVyLWJyYW5kLWxvdWlzLXZ1aXR0b27SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"A new shareholder wants to change things up at LVMH, the world’s largest luxury conglomerate and parent company of renowned fashion and leather-goods brands such as Louis Vuitton, Loewe, and Céline.

Animal-rights group PETA revealed in a blog post yesterday that it is now a shareholder in LVMH on the Euronext Paris. A PETA spokesperson confirmed to Quartz that the group bought just a single share, but it’s enough to grants PETA shareholder rights, which the group says it will use “to put pressure on the company to stop selling exotic skins merchandise.”

PETA has specifically targeted LVMH’s use of crocodile skins for bags, shoes, and belts. Recently it published a video exposé on crocodile farms in Vietnam that it says supply skins to the luxury company. Filmed in March and April 2016, the video shows crocodiles skinned while still alive, left to suffer for hours until they finally die.

LVMH says it has not purchased crocodile skins from any Vietnamese farms since 2014. “The information that PETA has been sending out about the LVMH group’s relations with crocodile farms in Vietnam is incorrect,” a spokesperson for LVMH said in a statement, adding that PETA was informed of this before publishing its video. “Moreover, the practices described are in total contradiction to the principles and rules of the LVMH group.”

PETA’s single share in LVMH gives it a platform to pressure the company in other ways, entitling it to attend annual shareholder meeting, for instance. “Every shareholder, regardless of the amount of shares owned, has the opportunity to take part in important decisions by voting at the Shareholders’ General Meeting,” the company says in its shareholders guide (pdf). The meeting will put PETA members face-to-face with LVMH management.

Last June, PETA used the tactic to confront luxury brand Hermès over its own use of exotic skins. At the meeting, in front of press and hundreds of shareholders, a PETA France spokeswoman read out allegations of cruelty to animals to Hermès CEO Axel Dumas. “Will Hermès some day stop using exotic skins?” she asked Dumas and other board members. The group has had success turning up at shareholder meetings in the past, as when it pressured Gap’s CEO to agree to stop using angora wool from rabbits.

LVMH’s next meeting of shareholders is in April (pdf), and PETA plans to attend. “We intend to question LVMH executives about why the company continues to use exotic-animal skins for its bags, even though they know of the extreme suffering this causes,” says a PETA spokesperson. “We will also call on the company to stop selling these leather bags, which represent sensitive animals’ short, miserable lives, and violent deaths.”

PETA has its work cut out for it, given that exotic skins can be big sellers for LVMH brands, and the company argues PETA is wrong about its supply chain."
LVMH to Expand Multibrand E-commerce Under Le Bon Marché Banner - WWD,"Tue, 17 Jan 2017 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3dkLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy1uZXdzL3JldGFpbC9sdm1oLXNhaWQtcGxvdHRpbmctZS1jb21tZXJjZS10aHJ1c3QtdmlhLWxlLWJvbi1tYXJjaGUtMTA3NDgyNDUv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS — Bringing a French touch to luxury e-commerce, LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton is planning to significantly ramp up the online scope of its luxury department store Le Bon Marché, WWD has learned.

According to industry sources, a new site is slated to go live around mid-year that will offer a much broader selection of products and expand delivery to more geographic zones.

As luxury firms become increasingly focused on reaching out and selling to clients online, the new site for Le Bon Marché could represent a leap forward for brands in the LVMH stable — as well as those of other luxury players.

Le Bon Marché’s current e-commerce site includes just a fragment of the store’s offer and only delivers within Europe, with many products restricted to delivery in France. A number of LVMH’s own brands — including Céline, Fendi and Louis Vuitton — are not available for sale on the site.

Sources say the expanded e-commerce site, known internally as Project Babylone, would more closely mirror the panorama of luxury products available in Le Bon Marché’s Left Bank flagship in Paris, which includes a comprehensive selection from LVMH’s own brands as well as a broad sweep of other high-end labels.

Spokespeople for LVMH and Le Bon Marché declined to comment.

LVMH brought on former Apple music executive Ian Rogers as chief digital officer in 2015 to craft a new digital strategy for the group, but has kept quiet regarding his plans for the company’s online presence.

Group brands were conspicuously absent from Style.com when the Condé Nast e-commerce initiative launched in the U.K. last September.

Progress on e-commerce has been uneven across LVMH since Vuitton became one of the first luxury brands to begin selling online in 2011. Fendi only launched its web store in March 2015, while Céline still has not launched e-commerce.

Teams from Sephora, which is one of the industry’s most innovative beauty retailers online and has the most extensive e-commerce offer at LVMH, are said to be contributing to the new site for Le Bon Marché.

One challenge LVMH has faced in developing the e-commerce emporium includes finding delivery services that fit with Le Bon Marché’s vision of a luxury experience, as well as differentiating the site from existing online stores, sources said, adding that the site would exalt the retailer’s unique brand mix, and its lively program of themed in-store events.

The department store has in recent years created temporary showcases highlighting products from Paris, Brooklyn and Brazil. The elaborately staged exhibitions have offered exclusive products, such as a special edition of Fendi’s Peekaboo bag in the colors of the French flag, and given clients the chance to discover new brands, which have sometimes entered Le Bon Marché’s selection permanently. Chitose Abe’s Sacai brand, for example, has been sold by the store since its success during a 2014 show of Japanese design.

In addition to Le Bon Marché’s roster of iconic luxury brands, more than 100 smaller labels are available in exclusivity at the store.

Founded in 1852, Le Bon Marché is often considered to be the world’s oldest department store. In its early years, it became a pioneer in distance retailing, mailing out as many as six million catalogues by the late 19th century.

LVMH acquired the department store — which, in addition to fashion, includes a gourmet supermarket called La Grande Épicerie as well as departments for books, homewares and furniture — in 1984.

Prized for its soaring atrium with escalators designed by Andrée Putman, the vast store of nearly 400,000 square feet has been progressively renovated in recent years, with departments including men’s wear, accessories, home goods and jewelry undergoing complete revamps since 2012. In 2015, the store unveiled a new 21,000-square-foot space for women’s shoes."

LVMH's Trump Visit Marks Paralysing Moment for Fashion Industry - The Business of Fashion,"Fri, 13 Jan 2017 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzb2ZmYXNoaW9uLmNvbS9uZXdzL2x1eHVyeS9sdm1ocy10cnVtcC12aXNpdC1tYXJrcy1wYXJhbHlzaW5nLW1vbWVudC1mb3ItZmFzaGlvbi1pbmR1c3RyeS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS, France — When LVMH's chief executive officer was seen striding through the Trump Tower lobby on Monday, the fashion industry held its breath.

Bernard Arnault runs the world's largest luxury-goods company — a sprawling empire that includes Louis Vuitton, Fendi and Dior — and here he was meeting with a president-elect who has threatened to roil the industry with trade restrictions. Following Arnault's sit-down with Trump, LVMH said the French company was considering expanding its production in the US.

The encounter underscores an agonising moment for apparel makers, most of which had written off America as a major source of production. A whopping 97 percent of clothes sold in the US is manufactured in other countries, but Trump has threatened to rip up trade agreements and impose tariffs in a bid to bring domestic jobs back.

That has led many clothing giants to freeze their overseas expansion plans — and at least pay lip service to the idea of making more of their wares in America.

""You're not going to have a big expansion until you know what's going to happen,"" said Julia Hughes, president of a fashion industry association that represents names such as Ralph Lauren Corp. and Under Armour Inc.

LVMH already has a factory in San Dimas, California, where it has made Louis Vuitton products for 25 years. The company is considering expanding that plant, as well as opening another facility in the South or Texas. But the decision has more to do with meeting local demand, said Sonia Fellmann, a Paris-based spokeswoman.

“The success of Louis Vuitton in the American market makes it necessary to increase production capacity,” she said. “The location has not been decided.”

Feeling Nervous

PVH Corp. chief executive officer Manny Chirico, whose company makes Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein clothing, acknowledged in a recent interview that industry executives are nervous. So too are stockholders. Despite a market rally, PVH and Ralph Lauren are both down about 13 percent since Trump's victory — though slow retail sales have contributed to the slump.

“It causes volatility that you have to deal with,” Chirico said. “But on balance you try to do the same thing, try to take a long view.”

The concern is that Trump’s rhetoric and tweet storms will escalate into a trade war with China and other countries. That would leave apparel makers with a dilemma: continue to produce in those countries — and pay margin-squeezing tariffs and other penalties — or attempt to rebuild the US clothing infrastructure.

The early signs from the president-elect point to some kind of confrontation with China. He has hired Peter Navarro, a frequent critic of China’s trade practices, to lead a newly formed White House National Trade Council. He also chose Robert Lighthizer, another China trade critic, to head the US Trade Representative office.

Trump’s Label

Trump’s own history with the apparel industry spotlights the challenges of making clothing domestically. The 70-year-old relied on offshore manufacturing to produce his line of businesswear, which was sold in Macy’s until a split in 2015. And his daughter Ivanka’s clothing line, made by G-III Apparel Group Ltd., comes from China.

In all, the US imported about $82 billion worth of apparel during the 12-month period that ended in September, according to data from the Commerce Department. More than 40 percent of clothing shipped to the US is made in China, with seven of the top 10 importers located in Asia.

Ascena Retail Group Inc., the women’s apparel seller that owns the Lane Bryant and Ann Taylor brands, has been assessing its operations in the wake of Trump’s victory. That includes holding off on expanding overseas sourcing agreements, according to Linda Heasley, chief executive officer of the company’s plus-size division.

“We’ve been positioning ourselves to take advantage of whatever might happen,” Heasley said during a recent interview on Bloomberg Television.

Sticker Shock?

Americans do say they want more domestically manufactured clothing, but they may not be willing to pay the higher prices. Made-in-the-USA products could double retail costs and potentially hurt the economy, said Hughes, president of the Fashion Industry Association.

But domestic-manufacturing advocates are more optimistic. By investing in US factories — and relying on automation — the clothing industry could make 30 percent of its products at home within the next 15 years, said Harry Moser, founder of the Reshoring Initiative. He points to the hidden expenses and hassles of Asian-made clothing, including shipping, duties, extra inventory costs and having to travel across the world to check on suppliers.

Of course, using factory robots would not require an army of workers, but a resurgent US apparel industry could still bring plenty of dollars and jobs, he said.

“We are talking about hundreds of billions of dollars,” said Moser, who consults with Wal-Mart Stores Inc. on its Made-in-the-USA program. “And maybe a million jobs.”

What could happen is that big brands will avoid Asia and shift production to Mexico and Central America, where there is already a robust apparel industry, said Augustine Tantillo, president of the National Council of Textile Organisations.

Textile Jobs

That would still help boost employment at US textile companies, which make the yarn, fabrics and fibers purchased by clothing producers. The American textile industry has 580,000 workers, down from about 1.8 million in the late 1990s when production shifted to Asia, according to the trade group.

Dov Charney knows as much about domestic clothing manufacturing as anyone. He founded American Apparel, which sewed its wares in a Los Angeles factory and touted that fact in a chain of stores nationwide.

Charney was forced out of the company, which then went bankrupt twice, but he is now working on a new LA clothing startup. Apparel production in the US is becoming more feasible because of the advances in automation and technology, he said in an interview.

The US does not offer the same kinds of financial incentives as China, Charney said. But he thinks companies could make a lot more stuff at home if they had the right know-how — and perhaps a bit of a push.

“It’s highly efficient to make clothing here, but a lot of people don’t understand how to do it,” Charney said. “American manufacturing is underrated.”

PETA Bought One Share of Louis Vuitton - The Cut,"Sat, 14 Jan 2017 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWN1dC5jb20vMjAxNy8wMS9wZXRhLWJvdWdodC1vbmUtc2hhcmUtb2YtbG91aXMtdnVpdHRvbi5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Photo: Pascal Le Segretain/Getty Images

Animal-rights organization People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals has purchased one share of LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton in the hopes of pressuring the brand to stop using exotic skin in its products. PETA circulated a video last December showing the mistreatment of crocodiles on a farm allegedly used to supply fashion brands with leather for high-end goods.

PETA made the following statement:

“In the wake of a PETA exposé revealing that reptiles on crocodile farms in Vietnam — including two that have supplied skins to a tannery owned by Louis Vuitton’s parent company, LVMH — are confined to tiny pits and sometimes hacked into while they’re still alive and thrashing, PETA has become a shareholder of LVMH on the Euronext Paris to put pressure on the company to stop selling exotic skins merchandise.”

PETA president Ingrid Newkirk added:

“Every PETA exposé of the exotic-skins industry has found sensitive living beings crammed into filthy pits, hacked apart and left to die … From demonstrating on the street to speaking up in the boardroom, PETA will push LVMH to stop selling any bag, watchband or shoe made from a reptile’s skin.”

A spokesperson for LVMH stated:

“Since 2014, the LVMH group and its suppliers definitively ceased working with the farms mentioned by PETA. The practices referred to by PETA are totally contrary to the principles and rules of the LVMH group. PETA was informed of all these elements prior to diffusing its video.”

PETA has previously snagged shares of Hermès and Prada in similar attempts to confront the brands to change their animal-skinning ways. Last May, a French PETA spokesperson named Isabelle Goetz confronted Hermès CEO Axel Dumas over the company’s use of exotic crocodile and alligator skins for its bags. PETA also hopes to pressure Prada to “help the company pull its head out of the sand” and “end the sale of cruelly produced ostrich-skin purses.”"

Maria Grazia Chiuri, artistic director of women’s collections at Dior, will join an all-star lineup including Karl Lagerfeld, Jonathan Anderson and Nicolas Ghesquière to judge the fourth edition of the contest, which today opens its site to applications from anyone under the age of 40 who has produced and sold at least two women’s or men’s ready-to-wear collections.

Meanwhile, the committee of experts that preselects the eight finalists for the prize, to be awarded in June, is gaining seven members. They are sound designer Michel Gaubert; Anne-Florence Schmitt, editor in chief at Madame Figaro; writer Derek Blasberg; retired Japanese footballer Hidetoshi Nakata; retailer Ikram Goldman; Dennis Freedman, creative director at Barneys New York, and Frédéric Bodenes, art director at Paris department store Le Bon Marché.

They will join 35 other journalists, stylists, buyers, photographers and other fashion professionals on the committee, among them art director Fabien Baron and editors Cathy Horyn and Jefferson Hack.

The winning candidate will walk away with a grand prize of 300,000 euros, or $320,000, plus a year of coaching from experts at luxury giant LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, parent of fashion houses including Louis Vuitton, Loewe, Givenchy, Berluti and Marc Jacobs.

Unique in its online-only application process, the prize usually attracts about 1,000 entries, according to Delphine Arnault, the force behind the initiative and a key talent scout at family-controlled LVMH.

“It’s a very open prize. There are no nationality barriers. We believe that everyone has the means to access a computer and send an application,” she told WWD in an interview. Applicants have until Feb. 5 to enter.

“What we are looking for mainly is creative talent, a fresh and unique point of view, a design vision and product that is different from what is already on the market,” said Arnault, second-in-command at Louis Vuitton, LVMH’s largest and most profitable brand.

The group plans to fly around 25 semifinalists to the French capital to showcase their designs at its headquarters on Avenue Montaigne on March 2 to 3 during Paris Fashion Week for the members of the expert committee and other invited guests to inspect.

“In two days, they will meet many people who can further their careers,” said Arnault, noting that attendees will include stylists, editors, photographers, models, makeup artists and buyers.

In mid-June, the finalists of the 2016 edition are to face the jury. In addition to Arnault, Chiuri, Lagerfeld, Anderson and Ghesquière, it includes Marc Jacobs; Céline’s Phoebe Philo; Givenchy’s couturier Riccardo Tisci; Kenzo designers Humberto Leon and Carol Lim; Jean-Paul Claverie, an adviser to LVMH chairman and chief executive officer Bernard Arnault and the group’s director of sponsorships, and Pierre-Yves Roussel, chairman and ceo of LVMH Fashion Group.

Arnault said a key aspect of the prize was the yearlong mentorship provided by LVMH executives on topics such as pricing, distribution, product development and manufacturing, accounting and legal issues.

“We remain in close contact with them, but it’s with the aim of helping young designers. We don’t require anything from them in exchange,” said Arnault. “We are a leader in our industry and it’s our responsibility to help identify young talents and to help them grow.”

The past three winners are Thomas Tait, Marques’ Almeida and Wales Bonner, and the prize has also boosted the careers of its runner-up special-prize winners: Hood by Air, Jacquemus, Vejas and Miuniku.

Also today, LVMH opens up applications for fashion graduates through May 14. Each year, LVMH awards three winners the chance to join the creative team of one of the group’s houses for a year, as well as a grant of 10,000 euros, or $10,640. Past winners have gone on to be hired by Givenchy and Kenzo.

Prizes for young designers have multiplied in recent years as fashion’s biggest players jockey to do good, and forge relations with potential future recruits.

LVMH also supports the ANDAM Fashion Awards; the International Fashion and Photography Festival in Hyères, France; Central Saint Martins College of Arts and Design in London, and the French Culture Ministry’s credit advance program for young designers."

Peta – which stands for People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals – said it had bought an unspecified number of shares so that it can pressure the firm to stop selling bags and other merchandise made from exotic skins.

The organisation – which is well known for protests – will have access to shareholder meetings and the right to question board members by being an investor.

It previously followed the same policy with another luxury group – Hermès – buying just one share. At the annual shareholders’ meeting in Paris a Peta member questioned the company’s CEO about the use of exotic skins.

LVMH has denied allegations that it had bought skins in recent years from a Vietnamese crocodile farm accused of cruelty."

Animal rights group People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (Peta) has snapped up a stake in French luxury goods retailer Louis Vuitton Moet Hennessy (LVMH), bolstering its efforts to stop makers of high end leather goods and clothes from using exotic animal skins in production.

Peta – known for staging elaborate protests and publicity stunts – confirmed in a statement on its website that it had bought the shares on Thursday. But the group, which owns Louis Vuitton, Christian Dior and Hennessy cognac among other high end brands, did not reveal the size of its holding.

Peta’s stake in the company will give it the right to attend shareholder meetings and question the board.

“Every Peta exposé of the exotic-skins industry has found sensitive living beings crammed into filthy pits, hacked apart, and left to die,” Ingrid Newkirk, the president of Peta, wrote in a statement published on the charity’s website.

“From demonstrating on the street to speaking up in the boardroom, Peta will push LVMH to stop selling any bag, watchband, or shoe made from a reptile’s skin.”

LVMH was not immediately available for comment.

The move by Peta comes in the wake of its investigation into crocodile farms, which have allegedly supplied skins to a tannery owned by LVMH.

The exposé showed the animals are confined to tiny pits and that they are sometimes cut into while still alive.

Last month, Sylvie Bénard, director of environment at LVMH, denied the allegations saying that the group’s tannery in Vietnam had not bought crocodile skins from any Vietnamese farms since 2014.

Orcas are highly intelligent and social mammals who may suffer immensely, both physically and mentally, when they're held in captivity. Getty Where not to visit if you love animals Tiger shows Tigers are forced to live in an unnatural and barren environment and have to endure interactions with a constant stream of tourists. Since tigers never lose their wild instincts, across the world they are reportedly drugged, mutilated and restrained in order to make them “safe” for the public. However, every year, incidents of tiger maulings are reported at this type of tourist attraction.

But it's pure hell for donkeys who are confined to the beach and forced to cart children around on the hot sand. Some donkey-ride operators at beach resorts in the UK even keep the animals chained together at all times.

Unfortunately, people are often unaware that these animals are captured in the wild and torn from their families or traded between different parks around the world.

Most of them will have been bred in captivity and then taken from their mothers to be hand-reared by the cub-petting industry. When they get too big, they may be drugged before they are released into a ""hunting"" enclosure. Because these animals are usually kept in fenced enclosures (ranging in size from just a few square yards to thousands of acres), they never stand a chance of surviving.

The majority of Spaniards reject bullfighting, but tourists are keeping the cruel industry on its last legs.

Zoos breed animals because the presence of babies draws visitors and boosts revenue, yet often, there's nowhere to put the offspring as they grow, and they are killed, as we saw with Marius the giraffe in Denmark. Some zoos have introduced evening events with loud music and alcohol which disrupt the incarcerated animals even further. EPA

PETA has bought a stake in luxury conglomerate LVMH, the parent company to Louis Vuitton, Dior and Givenchy, much like it did with Hermes and Prada in previous years. Having a stake in the company will allow the animal rights activists to attend shareholder meetings and “put pressure on the company to stop selling exotic skins merchandise.”

The decision comes after PETA released a video last month about the crocodile farms in Vietnam, exposing reptiles being killed for their skin. The organization, which noted that the slaughtering was “inhumane,” claimed that two of the farms shown in the clip provide crocodile skins to LVMH.

At the time of the video’s release, LVMH’s director of environment Sylvie Bernard responded to the Financial Times, stating, “We have no knowledge of a partner that would practice the method you referred to… any cruel method involving the suffering of the animal is in clear contradiction with our principles and rules.” Bernard also told the international business newspaper that its tannery Heng Long had not purchased skins from Vietnam farms since 2014.

“Every PETA exposé of the exotic-skins industry has found sensitive living beings crammed into filthy pits, hacked apart, and left to die,” PETA President Ingrid Newkirk stated in a blog post. “From demonstrating on the street to speaking up in the boardroom, PETA will push LVMH to stop selling any bag, watchband, or shoe made from a reptile’s skin.”"

Paralyzing moment for fashion industry - Business - Chinadaily.com.cn - China Daily,"Sat, 14 Jan 2017 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNoaW5hZGFpbHkuY29tLmNuL2J1c2luZXNzLzIwMTctMDEvMTQvY29udGVudF8yNzk1Mjg1Ny5odG3SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Donald Trump speaks to reporters with LVMH Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Bernard Arnault (right) after their meeting at Trump Tower in New York. [Photo/Agencies]

When LVMH's chief executive officer was seen striding through the Trump Tower lobby on Monday, the fashion industry held its breath.

Bernard Arnault runs the world's largest luxury-goods company - a sprawling empire that includes Louis Vuitton, Fendi and Dior - and here he was meeting with a president-elect who has threatened to roil the industry with trade restrictions. Following Arnault's sit-down with Trump, LVMH said the French company was considering expanding its production in the United States.

The encounter underscores an agonizing moment for apparel makers, most of which had written off the US as a major source of production. A whopping 97 percent of clothes sold in the US is manufactured in other countries, but Trump has threatened to rip up trade agreements and impose tariffs in a bid to bring domestic jobs back.

That's led many clothing giants to freeze their overseas expansion plans - and at least pay lip service to the idea of making more of their wares in the US.

""You're not going to have a big expansion until you know what's going to happen,"" said Julia Hughes, president of a fashion industry association that represents names such as Ralph Lauren Corp and Under Armour Inc.

LVMH already has a factory in San Dimas, California, where it has made Louis Vuitton products for 25 years. The company is considering expanding that plant, as well as opening another facility in the South or Texas.

But the decision has more to do with meeting local demand, said Sonia Fellmann, a Paris-based spokeswoman.

On 9th January met Arnault and Chinese businessman , President of e-commerce giant . Both the latter said they are ready to invest more in the USA.



During the meeting, Bernard Arnault mentioned the possibility of ""enlarging"" the workshops, seeing the success met by some of its products currently manufactured in California, by adding output capacity ""either in Carolina or in Texas.""

On Thursday, answering questions at the press conference for the presentation of LVMH's 2016 results, Bernard Arnault stated that ""what is most important is to assess the worldwide impact of the changes taking place in [US] economic policy, which for the time being are very well received in the USA.""



""I think there are many more positive elements than negative ones,"" he said, adding that ""some of the measures that have been taken, such as lowering taxes, streamlining regulations and increasing major public works, are indeed very promising. [What will happen] afterwards, we do not know.""



""Besides, most of the people in charge of economic planning are great professionals, and having top-level bankers in positions such as these should work, this is my opinion,"" he concluded.



The USA are LVMH's main international market: in 2016, 27% of the luxury goods giant's sales were generated there, compared to 26% in Asia (Japan excluded). Last year, LVMH's US revenue grew by 7%.



Donald Trump has made the creation of more manufacturing jobs in the USA one of his leitmotifs, and has notably pledged to penalise US corporations which delocalise abroad."

Animal rights group Peta buys shares in luxury goods group LVMH to protest its use of exotic skins - The Straits Times,"Fri, 13 Jan 2017 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN0cmFpdHN0aW1lcy5jb20vd29ybGQvZXVyb3BlL2FuaW1hbC1yaWdodHMtZ3JvdXAtcGV0YS1idXlzLXNoYXJlcy1pbi1sdXh1cnktZ29vZHMtZ3JvdXAtbHZtaC10by1wcm90ZXN0LWl0cy11c2Utb2bSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Animal rights group Peta has snapped up a stake in French luxury goods retailer Louis Vuitton Moet Hennessy (LVMH) in an effort to stop it selling bags and other products made from exotic animal skins.

According to reports, the stake will give Peta the right to attend shareholder meetings and to question the board in front of other shareholders.

Peta - People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals - confirmed in a statement on its website that it had bought the shares on Thursday (Dec 12).

But it did not say how big a stake it had bought.

LVMH is the group which owns Louis Vuitton, Christian Dior, Fendi, Marc Jacobs and Hennessy cognac, among other high-end brands.

The move by Peta comes in the wake of an investigation by the animal rights group into crocodile farms in Vietnam which allegedly supplied skins to a tannery owned by LVMH.

The probe revealed that reptiles ""are confined to tiny pits and sometimes hacked into while they're still alive and thrashing"", said Peta.

As a result, it said, ""Peta has become a shareholder of LVMH on the Euronext Paris to put pressure on the company to stop selling exotic skins merchandise.""

Said Peta president Ingrid Newkirk: ""Every Peta expose of the exotic-skins industry has found sensitive living beings crammed into filthy pits, hacked apart, and left to die.

""From demonstrating on the street to speaking up in the boardroom, Peta will push LVMH to stop selling any bag, watchband, or shoe made from a reptile's skin.""

Peta's expose has been viewed almost 700,000 times on YouTube."
Sidney Toledano Christian Dior LVMH On Maria Grazia Chiuri Debut | British Vogue - British Vogue,"Tue, 17 Jan 2017 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZvZ3VlLmNvLnVrL2FydGljbGUvc2lkbmV5LXRvbGVkYW5vLWNocmlzdGlhbi1kaW9yLWx2bWgtb24tbWFyaWEtZ3JhemlhLWNoaXVyaS1kZWJ1dNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"""We have to see continuity, but you can’t do the same thing – we are not a museum, it’s just a reference in the silhouette in the colours,"" he said. ""It has to bring something new. When you have an iconic brand and an iconic product like the Bar jacket or the Lady Dior bag, we adapt to the newness. Take the Bar jacket; all of our designers, from Monsieur Dior, to Yves Saint Laurent, John Galliano, Raf Simons - the architecture of the product allows all of our designers to design something new. It’s a part of the heritage, but it’s a heritage you can develop.""

As well as referencing the archives, this development also comes down to intuition, according to Toledano, as well as maturity.

""Sometimes I have young people joining the company and they say, 'Okay, let's launch a new iconic product.' I say, 'If you define it like that you won't do it.' The iconic is something that comes, like a talented baby, and you have to recognise and identify it. This is tuition. You don’t do it through a marketing plan.""

Sidney Toledano Rex

As for his own role in the company, which he joined in the early Nineties, he has a creative analogy as to how it works.

""For the CEO I am like the director of the opera and I need to be sure that the orchestra and conductor are doing well, you have to deal with people and you have to deal with talents,"" he explained. ""With talents, you don’t send them memos to tell them what to do.""

Grazia Chiuri will present her second catwalk show for the house in March during Paris Fashion Week.

"Ce La Vi, Sweaty Betty en-route to Oz through L Catterton Asia - The Australian Financial Review","Fri, 20 Jan 2017 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFmci5jb20vY29tcGFuaWVzL3JldGFpbC9jZS1sYS12aS1zd2VhdHktYmV0dHktZW5yb3V0ZS10by1vei10aHJvdWdoLWwtY2F0dGVydG9uLWFzaWEtMjAxNzAxMTctZ3R0YWF60gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Some of these brands are sold in David Jones or online in Australia consumers, but Mr Thakran sees scope to open standalone stores and take more space in department stores.

At the same time, L Catterton Asia is ramping up expansion plans for its Australian-based investments, RM Williams, Seafolly, 2XU and Jones the Grocer – and searching for new investments in categories such as pet food, health foods and wellness products.

Funds merger

L Catterton was created 12 months ago through the merger of the Catterton and the LVMH and Groupe Arnault private equity funds, including L Capital, and now has about $US16 billion ($21 billion) under investment.

""We are still very bullish on Australia, particularly Australian lifestyle and wellness categories,"" said Mr Thakran, who is also group president of LVMH in south-east Asia and the Middle East.

""The new luxury is looking after oneself and spending time on oneself,"" he said. ""Experiences are becoming more important than products and Australia offers so much to the world.""

He wants to establish a one-stop beachwear chain, similar to LVMH's Sephora, underpinned by Seafolly and selling beach and swim wear ranging from bikinis to sandals, bags and even inflatable toys.

L Capital Asia acquired 70 per cent of Seafolly in 2014 and expects sales to reach $250 million in a few years, from $124 million in 2016, making it the biggest swimwear brand in the world.

L Catterton Asia is in negotiations to buy a high-profile swimwear brand in South America, is in talks to buy Billabong International's Tigerlily brand, which was put up for sale in November, and wants to change the name of Seafolly's Sunburn chain to increase its appeal with sun-shy Asian consumers.

""We'd love to create a Sephora of beachwear, something where we bring the best brands under one roof,"" he said. ""This category deserves to have someone taking the lead.""

Mr Thakran also sees strong growth for bush outfitter RM Williams, revealing plans for a second factory to resolve supply constraints and new stores in Los Angeles, Texas and London's Soho this year and Hong Kong, Singapore and Japan next year.

Mr Thakran conceded, however, that not all L Catterton's investments had gone according to plan.

Largest customer

Jones the Grocer's Australian operations collapsed last year and former owner John Manos sued L Capital, alleging minority oppression. The dispute was settled last month and Mr Manos is finalising plans to open a new food venture, Market Lane NYC, in Westfield's World Trade Centre in New York next month, while new Jones the Grocer stores are set to open in the UAE, Singapore, Cambodia, South Korea, Hong Kong, China, Japan and Myanmar.

The terms of the settlement were not disclosed, but Mr Manos told the AFR he was ""happy with the outcome"".

Performance sportswear brand 2XU (L Capital acquired a 40 per cent stake in 2013) was hit hard in 2015 by the collapse of its largest customer, US-based retailer The Sports Authority, cruelling IPO plans. But sales and earnings rebounded last year and Mr Thakran sees scope for 2XU to move into adjacent sports categories like basketball and new categories such as compression wear for travel and wound healing.

While most private-equity firms exit investments in four or five years, L Catterton Asia's new strategy is to retain investments longer, giving it time to improve performance and eventually deliver superior returns for investors.

""When you are looking at brand building … from a local leader to an international leader, it takes time, particularly when you have to sharpen the products, sharpen the retail. Therefore we now have a bias to staying slightly longer,"" he said.

""More importantly if we go into something we leave it in a better shape,"" he said, citing the group's investments in Asian accessories chain Charles & Keith and Indian cinema chain PVR.

""That's exactly what we want to do with Aussie brands – leave them in pristine shape so they continue to grow and do well."""
Louis Vuitton – Shares with style | Market commentary by Calamatta Cuschieri - MaltaToday,"Mon, 30 Jan 2017 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hbHRhdG9kYXkuY29tLm10L2J1c2luZXNzL2J1c2luZXNzX2NvbW1lbnQvNzM5MTkvbG91aXNfdnVpdHRvbl9zaGFyZXNfd2l0aF9zdHlsZV9jYWxhbWF0dGFfY3VzY2hpZXJp0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"About the company

LVMH is a French multinational luxury goods conglomerate, headquartered in Paris. The company was formed by the 1987 merger of fashion house Louis Vuitton with Moët Hennessy, a company formed after the 1971 merger between the champagne producer Moët & Chandon and Hennessy, the cognac manufacturer.

Investment thesis

We maintain our overweight stance on LVMH with a price target of €200/share. Post the 2016 results, we are confident that the Group delivered and will continue to deliver positive results in the years ahead.

About the results

LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton reported results last week which were above our expectations after the company experienced signs of a strong comeback in the luxury sector. And it’s not just the strong demand for Louis Vuitton and Fendi bags that made 2016 an excellent year for the Group but all categories within the Group were star performers, each pulling their weight.

The Louis Vuitton Brand managed to make a strong comeback thanks to store refurbishments combined with new products. The positive trend and strong demand we saw in 2016 is expected to continue in 2017.

TAG Heuer (another premium brand in the Group) gained market share and benefited from new collections and its connected watch.

LVMH Spirits which account for 34% of sales and 56% of operating profit continued to see expansion in sales, helped by a pick-up in demand from China.

Outlook

What interests us most was managements’ positive outlook for 2017 which we believe the Group will be able to achieve. They said the Group is well-equipped to cope with a climate of geopolitical and currency uncertainties and to maintain growth momentum across all business areas in 2017.

Rationale for our overweight recommendation

We remain overweight on LVMH with a price target of €200 per share for the following reasons:

Well diversified portfolio of different brands – over 50 brands across 5 sectors

We expect to continue to see a pick-up in sales of wines and spirits. The Group is no longer going through a destocking phase like in 2015

We expect to continue to see Tag Heuer and Bulgari outperform expectations in their respective categories

We expect to see continued improvement from the fashion and leather goods segment after the launch of new products by Louis Vuitton in the first quarter of this year

We expect to see stable margins at this stage. Although it would have been better to see an improvement in margins, given the current global risks, we expect margins to come in line with last year

LVMH plans to pay a final dividend of €2.6 a share
