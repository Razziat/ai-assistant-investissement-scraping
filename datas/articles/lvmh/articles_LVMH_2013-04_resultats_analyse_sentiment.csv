Industry Insight: LVMH CEO Surprised About Stake in Hermès - The Fashion Law,"Fri, 19 Apr 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWZhc2hpb25sYXcuY29tL2luZHVzdHJ5LWluc2lnaHQtbHZtaC1jZW8tc3VycHJpc2VkLWFib3V0LXN0YWtlLWluLWhlcm1lcy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton chairman and CEO Bernard Arnault spoke out this week at LVMH’s annual general meeting in Paris regarding the ongoing battle between the company and Hermès. According to WWD, “with LVMH facing scrutiny about whether it respected market rules in amassing a 22.6 percent stake in Hermès, Arnault claims he came into the holding unexpectedly.” Arnault further reiterated that “his intentions toward Hermès were peaceful and he did not plan to increase his stake in the family-controlled firm.”

This is especially interesting, as the two parties are currently involved in rival lawsuits. Last year, Hermès launched a criminal complaint against LVMH, accusing the luxury conglomerate of insider trading, collusion and manipulating stock prices (stemming from LVMH’s purchase of Hermès shares in 2010).

In October 2010, LVMH announced (to much surprise) that it had “amassed a 17.1 percent stake in Hermès via cash-settled equity swaps that allowed it to circumvent the usual regulations requiring firms to declare share purchases.” As of Dec. 31 last year, it had raised its stake to 22.6 percent. In response to Hermès’ suit, LVMH, filed suit against Hermès for slander, blackmail and unfair competition.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9874206185340881}",neutral,0.9874206185340881,0
DFS division of LVMH grows by +17% in Q1 - TRBusiness,"Mon, 15 Apr 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRyYnVzaW5lc3MuY29tL3JlZ2lvbmFsLW5ld3MvaW50ZXJuYXRpb25hbC9kZnMtZGl2aXNpb24tb2YtbHZtaC1ncm93cy1ieS0xNy1pbi1xMS82NzUyOdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The Selective Retailing division of LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, powered past its sister product divisions in the first quarter of 2013 to produce organic revenue growth of +17%.

The rate of growth of Selective Retailing – whose main contributors are duty free and travel retailer DFS and beauty retailer Sephora – was more than double LVMH’s average revenue increase in Q1 of +7%. The growth, if sustainable, means that Selective Retailing could overtake the Fashion & Leather Goods in terms of absolute sales (see table and click to enlarge) very soon.

The French luxury goods conglomerate says: “DFS recorded an excellent performance driven by continued growth in Asian tourism despite a decline in expenditure from Japanese tourists resulting from the weaker yen.” Sephora gained market share in all its regions, according to LVMH, and continued to expand its global store network. Of note was the opening in Shanghai of its largest store in China. Online sales also experienced rapid growth during the period.

Overall, LVMH recorded a +6% increase in Q1 with revenue rising to €6.947bn which, in organic terms (or constant currency basis) was up +7% compared to the same period in 2012.

The group says its performance so far this year is in line with the trends of the second half of 2012 with strong growth in Asia and the US, while Europe “demonstrates good resistance despite a challenging economic environment”.

PRODUCT GROUPS

The Wines & Spirits business group recorded organic growth of +7% in Q1 with Champagne notably robust in Asia and compensating for softer demand in Europe. Hennessy had “a solid performance in the US and rapid growth in China”. Other spirits, including Glenmorangie and Belvedere, experienced a good start to the year says the group.

Fashion & Leather Goods was up just +3% in Q1. Fendi is said to have benefited from continued developments in fur and leather and enlarging its store network as did Céline. Meanwhile Perfumes & Cosmetics’ growth of +5% in Q1 was helped by Christian Dior’s perfumes sales and, in particular, the strength of J’adore, Miss Dior and Dior Homme. The new lipstick Dior Addict and the premium skincare Prestige also contributed to the brand’s growth. Guerlain benefited from the momentum of La Petite Robe Noire and its high-end skincare Orchidée Impériale.

The Watches and Jewellery division was the slowest mover at +2% in Q1 (and -1% reported). LVMH says: “This performance was achieved in a context of prudent buying by multi-brand retailers.” TAG Heuer’s first quarter was marked by the 50th anniversary of its Carrera line and the new partnership with McLaren which was announced at the Geneva Motor Show. Hublot and Zenith are said to have had a good start to the year while in jewellery, Bulgari had success of its Serpenti line and recorded strong revenue growth in its own stores.

In an economic environment which remains uncertain in Europe, LVMH says it will continue to focus its efforts on developing its brands, maintain strict cost controls and target its investments on product innovation and distribution.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9999997615814209}",positive,0.9999997615814209,1
Bernard Arnault Defends LVMH Stake In Hermes - Legal Battle | British Vogue - British Vogue,"Fri, 19 Apr 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZvZ3VlLmNvLnVrL2FydGljbGUvYmVybmFyZC1hcm5hdWx0LWRlZmVuZHMtbHZtaC1zdGFrZS1pbi1oZXJtZXMtbGVnYWwtYmF0dGxl0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"BERNARD ARNAULT defended LVMH's controversial 22.6 per cent stake in Hermès yesterday, describing the acquisition as ""unexpected"". The businessman insisted that his intentions were ""friendly"", and confirmed that there are no plans to increase the percentage of its holding in the label.

LVMH and Hermès are currently in the middle of a legal battle over the investment - with the latter accusing the former of manipulating stock prices and unfair insider trading. LVMH responded by filing a lawsuit in return against Hermès, complaining of false allegations and blackmail.

""We found ourselves owning shares in this company unexpectedly. We had not planned to be shareholders in this firm,"" said Arnault during LVMH's annual general meeting in Paris yesterday. ""We made a financial investment and that financial investment had an outcome that we had not expected.""

LVMH first acquired a 17.1 per cent stake in rival company Hermès in October 2010, which was then increased to 22.3 per cent in December 2011. The original stake was reportedly acquired somewhat controversially via cash-settled equity swaps, which meant that the move did not have to be declared publicly. Fearing a complete takeover, the family-run company questioned LVMH's tactics and branded the move ""an attack"".

""We want to support their policies and people are assigning us motives in a totally unfounded way. We have no intention at all of increasing our stake to play a role in this company,"" said Arnault yesterday. ""We want instead to be friendly supporters of one of France's finest companies - and that's all.""

France's stock market regulator, AMF, will investigate on May 31 whether LVMH respected market rules, reports WWD, with a ruling report to be published later this summer.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9977535605430603}",neutral,0.9977535605430603,0
