LVMH Sidelines China's Middle Class Shoppers - Jing Daily,"Wed, 20 Apr 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiPGh0dHBzOi8vamluZ2RhaWx5LmNvbS9wb3N0cy9sdm1oLXExLWVhcm5pbmdzLWhpZ2gtZW5kLW1hcmtldNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LVMH’s results published on April 12 are still trending with citizens — and for all the wrong reasons. The hashtag #LVMH is betting on the high-end market in the future# is trending on Weibo with 239,000 views as netizens discuss the luxury conglomerate’s courting of ultra-high net worth shoppers.

According to the media publication Fashion Business Daily, the number of LVMH’s ultra-high-net-worth consumers and the purchase quantity of the ultra-rich has increased in the past two years. It seems the company’s main objective was to meet the preferences of these ultra-high-net-worth customers. This has not played well with the billions of spenders in lower-tier cities.

A post from @林登万大人 which outlined its own take on LVMH’s consumer classifications as well as its intentions has been circulating. It stated that, according to the company’s briefing, those with an income below three million yuan are categorized as “non-income” and should be “eliminated.” LVMH has yet to comment on the post.

While it’s logical that LVMH will double down on its highest spenders, is it right to want to alienate — let alone eliminate — shoppers that might spend less?

What happened

Bernard Arnault’s luxury conglomerate LVMH continues to defy expectations, reporting record sales in the first quarter. It cited big flagship names like Louis Vuitton and Dior as having led these. Stablemates Celine, Loewe, Fendi, Marc Jacobs, and Loro Piana also performed strongly. The French company said its fashion and leather goods division, its largest, grew by 30 percent organically.

There is, however, one (pretty major) fly in the ointment. Despite this success, Chief Financial Officer Jean-Jacques Guiony’s comments have indicated LVMH is bracing for future impact due to China’s ongoing zero-COVID policy and the changing situation.

The Jing Take

In sharp contrast to much of the rest of the world, Beijing continues to impose restrictions as it rolls out vaccines. Over the past weeks, the country has seen a spike in cases that are defying earlier, and effective, lockdown strategies. Shanghai set a daily record for the 11th time in 12 days, reporting 26,330 confirmed infections on Wednesday.

The government’s blueprint is unlikely to be reversed — regardless of the cost to its economy — meaning companies will need to pay careful attention to the market. A confident Guiony said that while LVMH was bracing, it was not worried about the long-term implications of this latest wave of quarantines and expected demand to return once the virus was under control. Yet the CFO did note that even cities not currently curtailed have seen slower store traffic and people traveling less.

With top tiers currently saturated, the trouble for brands going forward will be to connect with shoppers outside of these. What’s also new is the environmental issue accompanying this latest lockdown: global downturn and uncertainty, supply chain disruption, courier delays, and, of course, a landmass cut off from the West. More work will have to be done to reach consumers. While it’s clear that the mainland’s ultrarich will never tire of spending (domestic purchases of luxury goods in 2021 were valued at 74 billion), it won't be until the second-quarter results come in that we'll see where that’s been directed.

Luxury retailer LVMH has been accused of collecting facial scans of its customers without their permission, breaching state privacy laws, according to a lawsuit filed Friday in a New York court.

We first saw the news via Bloomberg.

The Louis Vuitton North America unit is accused in the suit of collecting ""detailed and sensitive biometric identifiers and information, including complete facial scans.""

US consumers can use a virtual try-on tool on Louis Vuitton's website that allows them to check out how a pair of glasses or sunglasses looks on their face. A shopper can switch their smartphone or laptop camera on in selfie mode, and the tool digitally overlays the glasses over their face.

According to the suit, the site conducts a facial scan to do this and fails both to ask permission for this data and to explain what it's being used for. The data is translated into code and sent to and stored at an external server, the suit claimed.

The suit points to Illinois biometric privacy law, BIPA, uniquely strict state rules that protect consumers' biometric data. Breaching the regulation can mean fines of up to $5,000 per violation.

Louis Vuitton violates these laws ""each and every time a website visitor based in Illinois uses the Virtual Try-On tool,"" the lawsuit claimed, because it doesn't receive informed consent from shoppers.

Insider approached LVMH for comment.

"LVMH, Fendi open the door to sustainable, plastic-free lab-grown fur - Vogue Business","Thu, 21 Apr 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZvZ3VlYnVzaW5lc3MuY29tL3N1c3RhaW5hYmlsaXR5L2x2bWgtZmVuZGktb3Blbi10aGUtZG9vci10by1zdXN0YWluYWJsZS1wbGFzdGljLWZyZWUtZmF1eC1mdXLSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"To become a Vogue Business Member and receive the Sustainability Edit newsletter, click here.

Fashion is trending away from fur and even major alternatives are made from plastic, which is neither luxe or good for the environment. Now, LVMH, one of the remaining luxury groups still using fur, is attempting to create a new, sustainable option using keratin, the main protein in hair, as the starting point.

In a partnership shared exclusively with Vogue Business, the world’s largest luxury group is working with Imperial College London and Central Saint Martins University of the Arts to develop lab-grown fur fibres for luxury fashion. Fendi, the Italian brand most known for its use of fur among the LVMH brands, is leading the charge. The goal, says group environment development deputy director Alexandre Capelli, is to develop a fur alternative that is animal-free and matches the quality of natural fur without environmental tradeoffs.

Read More Neiman Marcus is swapping fur for apple leather. Can it convince loyal customers? The US retailer is one of many phasing out fur products. CEO Geoffroy van Raemdonck says the future lies in plant-based alternatives.

“The ultimate goal at LVMH is to have these alternative innovative materials but not using plastics,” Capelli says. “Even if the quality of fake fur has improved in the last year, it’s still not at the level of natural fur. We think that with this innovation, we should be able to achieve this level of quality — very close to natural fur.”

LVMH is one of few luxury fashion companies to show no sign of moving away from fur, even as rivals including Gucci-owner Kering make public announcements banning it. LVMH’s interest in a keratin-based alternative could replace the plastic-based faux fur materials it currently uses, but isn’t intended to replace fur all together, says Capelli. Still, the group and its partners see untapped potential in the use of biotechnology to make animal-free fur, with an optimistic outlook about the quality and range of applications it could eventually be used in.

The successful development of a low-impact bio-based alternative to animal fur could be a game-changer for LVMH, and for the entire fashion industry, if it’s used appropriately. As with all innovation for sustainability — whether it’s next-gen materials or new business models, such as resale — it can only improve a brand’s footprint if it replaces whatever the original problem was."
LVMH Creates Virtual Ambassador for the 2022 Innovation Award - Virtual Humans,"Thu, 07 Apr 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZpcnR1YWxodW1hbnMub3JnL2FydGljbGUvbHZtaC1jcmVhdGVzLXZpcnR1YWwtYW1iYXNzYWRvci1mb3ItdGhlLTIwMjItaW5ub3ZhdGlvbi1hd2FyZNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"L

VMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, the most valuable company in Europe as of 2021, created a metaverse ambassador to host their annual Innovation Award competition at the Viva Technology conference. LVMH’s new virtual character is a female avatar with blended blue and grey eyes, distinct freckles, and stylish brown hair. The luxury conglomerate introduced her alongside their call for startups to apply to the innovation competition.

‍

Launched in 2017, the LVMH Innovation Award invites startups from across the globe to pitch solutions capable of accelerating the luxury experience at LVMH Maisons. The award is organized in conjunction with the Viva Technology conference, scheduled to run from June 15 to 18 in Paris this year.

The new virtual ambassador has yet to be given an official name. She will deliver statements about innovation, tech, and digital-related topics for LVMH and their brands during VivaTech. How she will make her appearance remains to be seen, though she is a living testament to a focus on innovation at LVMH through her own existence.

‍

Installing a virtual character function as one’s brand ambassador is a fresh way to represent a company’s vision, values, and connectedness to a tech-enabled future.

‍

Previous winners of LVMH's Innovation Award have also gone on to employ virtual characters in innovative ways. Last year, live shopping platform Bambuser won the Omnichannel & Retail Experience award at the luxury conglomerate's innovation competition. Bambuser helps brands host live shopping sessions online with sales associates for a captive audience just a click away from making a purchase right inside the stream.

‍

In February, Bambuser’s live shopping technology was used to power the launch of Samsung’s new Galaxy S22, a first-of-its-kind event co-hosted by a virtual human named Zero. Zero from Nexus, built and owned by Offbeat, hosted an engaging conversation with TikTok creator Liam Kalevi within the live shopping event, where Zero talked about his favorite features of the new Samsung phone…

During the stream, Zero did something unprecedented—he pulled out a virtual Galaxy S22 and took a selfie with his co-hosts, all from his bunker in the metaverse, in real time.

‍

Innovative events like these showcase the vast creative potential of virtual influencers and the near-infinite possibilities they present to brands.

‍

LVMH’s newly revealed virtual ambassador is bound to bring a new and fresh experience to the 2022 Innovation Award ceremony. In addition, it is an accessible way for LVMH to test the waters of the metaverse. During the conglomerate’s earnings call in January, LVMH chairman and chief executor Bernard Arnault shared their wait-and-see approach to digital 3D worlds and products:



“We have to see what will be the applications of the Metaverse and NFTs. It can undoubtedly have a positive impact—if it is well done—on the activity of the brands, but it is not our objective to sell virtual sneakers at €10. We are not interested in that,” Arnault said.

‍

Virtual influencers could become a catalyst for LVMH to move further in the direction of the metaverse, as they explore the web3 world and employ creative, forward-thinking strategies. For now, the venture starts at the 2022 Innovation Award with an edgy, blue-eyed, freckled metaverse ambassador."

LVMH has signed a multiyear capacity reservation agreement with Origin Materials to buy sustainable, carbon-negative PET (polyethylene terephthalate) for its packaging of perfumes and cosmetics. Origin technology reduces PET’s carbon footprint because it is made from sustainable wood residues, which capture carbon, the release stated.

“At LVMH, with our Life 360 program, we made the decision that our packaging will contain zero plastic from virgin fossil resources in a near future,” said LVMH Beauty Executive President and Managing Director Claude Martinez in the release. “Origin’s bioplastic technologies are playing a crucial role in helping LVMH achieve our sustainability targets without any compromise on quality.”

Origin PET is also “equally recyclable to fossil-based PET within the existing infrastructure, which is critical to creating a circular economy with a significantly reduced carbon footprint,” according to the release. LVMH will use the new packaging across its family of brands, including Christian Dior, Givenchy, Guerlain and others.

“LVMH is a powerhouse of luxury brands, with a high standard of excellence for the environmental performance of its products,” said Origin Materials Co-CEO Rich Riley in the release. “Our mission of enabling the world’s transition to sustainable materials as fast as possible is completely aligned with LVMH’s ambitious environmental initiatives. We look forward to helping LVMH reduce its carbon footprint and achieve its sustainability goals while continuing to deliver superior product experiences to its customers.”

Last week, LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton reported a 29% spike in its 2022 first-quarter revenue, hitting 18 billion euros (about $19.5 billion) for the first three months of the year. Only the company’s Wines and Spirits segment of the business failed to grow by double digits in Q1, with supply chain constraints continuing to hamper that sector.

Overall, the company achieved 23% organic growth for the quarter. The Fashion and Leather Goods business group led the way for LVMH with 30% organic revenue growth in Q1, followed by Selective Retailing at 24%, Watches and Jewelry at 19%, Perfumes and Cosmetics at 17%, and Wines and Spirits at 2%."
Bernard Arnault Can Keep Running LVMH Until He's 80 - WWD,"Thu, 21 Apr 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3dkLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy1uZXdzL2ZpbmFuY2lhbC9iZXJuYXJkLWFybmF1bHQtY2FuLWtlZXAtcnVubmluZy1sdm1oLXVudGlsLWhlcy0xMjM1MTYzMjc3L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Bernard Arnault‘s long-term, family-driven view on luxury extends to himself.

On Thursday, shareholders of LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton voted 81.6 percent in favor of a resolution to extend to 80 the age limit for its longtime chairman and chief executive officer, who is 73. Previously the company’s bylaws fixed 75 as the age limit for serving as CEO.

Dressed in a slim-fitting suit the same shade of blue favored by French President Emmanuel Macron, the luxury titan was in fine form on Thursday morning as he presided over LVMH’s first in-person annual shareholder’s meeting in three years. He touted the group’s “remarkable performance” in 2021, when revenues in its key fashion and leather goods business division vaulted 42 percent versus 2019 — and cracked jokes when the voting machinery got glitchy ahead of resolutions concerning his remuneration.

Arnault also indulged in some of his signature hyperbole, boasting that Christian Dior, one of the crown jewels of the diversified group, is a French name even more famous than Napoleon.

He also noted that LVMH improved its performance to such a degree in 2021 that its operating profits, which came in at 17.2 billion euros, approximate the revenues of other luxury groups — a veiled dig at smaller rival Kering.

Operating profits in 2021 were double those of 2020, and 49 percent higher than in 2019 before the pandemic hit.

Shareholders sat rapt at the Carrousel du Louvre as Arnault extolled his conviction that luxury goods is a long-term play, not a quarterly race, and one best shepherded by family with skin in the game.

Four of his five children — Delphine, Antoine, Frédéric and Jean — sat in the front row of the audience, interspersed with other LVMH brass. (Alexandre Arnault, an executive vice president at Tiffany & Co., is based in New York.)

“You are not shareholders in some anonymous group; therefore, you are part of the family,” he told the room, flashing a warm smile.

He also reiterated that “profits are a consequence of what we do” rather than a goal in itself, extolling the four key values of the group: creativity; an entrepreneurial spirt; excellence in products and retail experiences, and a commitment to doing good for the environment and society.

Shares in LVMH have gained about 25 percent since Jan. 1, but it’s not a point of pride for Arnault. “I never look at the stock exchange,” he asserted.

He reiterated his skepticism about the metaverse, even questioning Facebook’s name change to Meta. “There’s no need to rush. We should be prudent,” he said, suggesting that digital fashions for avatars is not in LVMH’s DNA. “We want to sell real products.”

While some brands are hawking virtual sneakers, Arnault touted the record-breaking auction last February that saw 200 pairs of Louis Vuitton and Nike “Air Force 1” sneakers by Virgil Abloh sell for a total $25.3 million, all to benefit the Virgil Abloh “Post-Modern” scholarship fund.

Arnault also paid tribute to Abloh, founder of the Off-White label and creative director of Vuitton menswear until his death last November at the age of 41, inviting shareholders to view the “Coming of Age” exhibition dedicated to him at the Fondation Louis Vuitton until April 27.

The executive trumpeted that Tiffany, which LVMH acquired last year, is “developing better than expected” and that its Fifth Avenue flagship in New York City, currently under renovation, should be ready by the end of the year.

LVMH conscripted French economist Nicolas Bouzou to delve into LVMH’s wider impact on the French economy. The study found that LVMH is responsible for generating some 145,000 jobs in France and adds a total of 36.6 billion euros to the economy.

The luxury conglomerate, which owns 75 brands including Fendi, Loewe, Bulgari, Dom Perignon, Sephora and Guerlain, exports 75 percent of what it produces, an amount bigger than the pharmaceutical industry, according to Bouzou’s study.

In a lively presentation, Antoine Arnault, head of image and environment at LVMH, detailed the group’s eco progress, plucking from under the podium a pair of colorful upcycled Vuitton sneakers and then a Loewe bag woven from strips of discarded leather that is currently out of stock.

He highlighted that 57 percent of the group’s boutiques are fully LED, while 81 percent of leathers used are certified LWG and 61 percent of cotton is certified, up from 74 percent and 51 percent versus a year ago, respectively.

He said the group is aiming to have 100 percent of its products eco conceived by 2030, and to reduce emissions by 55 percent in the same time frame.

Chantal Gaemperle, executive vice president of human resources and synergies at LVMH, described progress in diversity and inclusion, noting that women now occupy 44 percent of key posts at LVMH, versus only 23 percent in 2017.

The group also continues its policy of grooming and promoting talent from within. Last year, 75 percent of key posts were filled internally, with a total of 5,580 employees getting promotions.

As part of the partnership, LVMH Beauty will purchase Origin Materials’ polyethylene terephthalate — more commonly known as PET — which Origin purports is more carbon-negative than other PET alternatives.

With the multi-year deal, LVMH hopes to create more eco-friendly packaging for its beauty brands, which include Fresh, Fenty Beauty and Make Up For Ever, and get closer to reaching its own sustainability targets, which it aims to hit by 2030.

LVMH is shrugging off record-high inflation and war - Quartz,"Tue, 12 Apr 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vcXouY29tLzIxNTM5ODkvbHZtaC1pcy1zaHJ1Z2dpbmctb2ZmLXJlY29yZC1oaWdoLWluZmxhdGlvbi1hbmQtd2Fy0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"US inflation may be the highest it’s been in decades, and Europe in the midst of a bloody conflict, while in China, tens of millions of people remain in lockdown. But for LVMH, the purveyor of Dior bags and fine cognac, business is booming.

The French company reported strong first quarter results, beating estimates on Apr. 12. Its revenue totaled 18 billion euros, up 29% compared to the same time last year. Growth continued to be led by its star brands Louis Vuitton and Dior, although management noted that most of its labels (with the exception of its duty free arm, DFS) were doing well.

Here’s why the luxury conglomerate has remained mostly unscathed:

How is Russia’s Ukraine invasion affecting the luxury industry?

LVMH’s business has largely escaped the effects from the conflict, mainly because both Ukraine and Russia are tiny markets for its brands. Russia only accounts for around 1% of its global business, per Morgan Stanley luxury analyst Edouard Aubin.

And although Russia supplies much of the world’s rough diamonds, the company said it hasn’t had any problems finding other sources for its jewelry brands like Bvlgari.

“It’s perfectly doable in a reasonably short time frame,” said LVMH Group CEO Jean-Jacque Guiony on the earnings call.

How LVMH is handling inflation

As inflation rates climb around the world, the company has been making its goods more expensive “in a fairly meaningful way”, said Guiony. LVMH upped prices for most of its brands, including most recently at Louis Vuitton, by the mid-single digits, he added. The company expects to implement more hikes in the coming months too.

This is in step with price multiple increases at Chanel and a big jump at Kering-owned Bottega Veneta, both of which now sell bags at around the $10,000 mark, a distinction that had mainly been reserved for Hermès.

Despite LVMH’s higher prices, Guiony noted that its affluent customer base hasn’t pushed back. “We have not noticed any meaningful price elasticity when increasing prices. It’s not something that you can observe in a very scientific way, but we think there is no particular price elasticity,” he said.

China covid lockdowns

While it’s still too early to assess the full impact of lockdowns in China, particularly in Shanghai, the company isn’t worried about it in the long term. LVMH said sales will take a hit in the second quarter, but it expects people to start shopping again once the lockdown lifts. If early pandemic 2020 performance was any indication, its brands could even see another bout of “revenge spending“, management said."

Despite “continued disruption from the health crisis and the dramatic events in Ukraine,” the French luxury goods conglomerate revealed that all of its business groups – from Fashion & Leather Goods to Selective Retailing – achieved double-digit revenue growth, except for Wines & Spirits, which continued to see supply constraints.

Delving into its biggest division, LVMH stated on Tuesday that Fashion & Leather Goods, which is responsible for just upwards of 50 percent of the group’s total revenues, recorded revenues of 9.12 billion euros for the first three months of the year. The group pointed to Louis Vuitton, which had “an excellent start to the year,” Dior, which “enjoyed another remarkable performance,” Fendi’s “solid growth, driven in particular by the success of Kim Jones’ collections,” and Celine, which achieved “very strong growth thanks to the remarkable success of its ready-to-wear and leather goods lines designed by Hedi Slimane.” Loro Piana, Loewe, and Marc Jacobs “all had a very good quarter,” per LVMH.

A standout in terms of growth within the Fashion & Leather Goods division is Dior, with Bernstein analyst Luca Solca stating in a note on Wednesday that the brand is doing “somewhat better” than the others within the division. As for Louis Vuitton, he states that management does not intend to be overwhelmed by demand,” as they have a lot of initiatives in place for supply to keep up with demand, like the two new precious leather workshops in Vendôme, France.” At the same time, “The strategy remains that of controlling volumes.”

In a call on Tuesday, LVMH Chief Financial Officer Jean-Jacques Guiony specifically cited the strength of Dior, noting that Dior and Celine grew faster than other labels. Although, top-earner Louis Vuitton “is never very far from the average for the division.”

Within the realm of Watches & Jewelry, which recorded organic revenue growth of 19 percent year-over-year, with revenues reaching 2.34 billion euros, Tiffany & Co. had “an excellent start to the year, still driven by strong growth in the United States.” The new Knot collection was particularly successful, according to LVMH, which is currently in the midst of a major youth-focused overhaul at Tiffany & Co. under the watch of EVP of Product and Communications, Alexandre Arnault. Bulgari was another standout, thanks to strong demand – for both it and Tiffany & Co. – in the U.S. and Europe, as well as Singapore and Korea.

LVMH noted “strong growth of perfume and makeup, robust progress in the U.S. and a rebound in Europe,” with the division generating 1.91 billion euros, up from 1.55 billion euros for the same quarter last year.

Elsewhere under the LVMH umbrella, the Selective Retailing division, which is home to the likes of beauty retailer Sephora and duty-free chain DFS, among others, generated 3.04 billion euros in revenue, up 30 percent compared to Q1 2021. Specifically, LVMH cited strong performance from Sephora, which demonstrated a “solid performance in stores, especially in North America, France and Middle East,” driven in large part by fragrance sales and the “recovery of makeup.” At the same time, DFS – which has been hit significantly in the wake of the pandemic and limited international travel, saw revenue increase but “at a lower level” amid the continued impact of the pandemic on travel.

Geographically speaking, LVMH revealed that the United States up 26 percent), Europe (up 45 percent), and Japan (up 30 percent) achieved double-digit revenue growth, while Asia (up 8 percent) continued to grow over the quarter even in the wake of tightening health restrictions in China in March. The group pointed to a “balanced geographic revenue mix,” with 37 percent of Q1 sales coming from the Asian market (excluding Japan), 24 percent coming from the U.S. and 14 percent coming from Europe (excluding France), followed by sales in “Other Markets” (12 percent), Japan (7 percent), and France (6 percent).

Solca emphasized the importance of the U.S. market, which is “the largest country in terms of percentage revenue for LVMH – even more so than Mainland China.” He further states that this U.S. market is currently “less dependent on cosmetics than several years ago, as makeup has seen some slowdown in the past years and has been replaced by other categories under cosmetics and Fashion & Leather Goods.”

In terms of e-commerce, LVMH reported that it continued to see “strong momentum of online revenue and omnichannel developments” in Q1, with e-commerce sales in the U.S., for instance, remaining above 2019 levels even though they are slowly normalizing in favor of brick-and-mortar sales.

And finally, in a brief note on the metaverse, LVMH management stated that it is difficult to comment on this as of now, but confirmed that the group is eyeing the space “very carefully,” and stated that the group “will be part of whatever the future holds for the metaverse.”"
Inside LVMH's biggest sustainability plan yet - Vogue Business,"Thu, 14 Apr 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZvZ3VlYnVzaW5lc3MuY29tL3N1c3RhaW5hYmlsaXR5L2luc2lkZS1sdm1ocy1iaWdnZXN0LXN1c3RhaW5hYmlsaXR5LXBsYW4teWV00gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"To become a Vogue Business Member and receive the Sustainability Edit newsletter, click here.

LVMH, the world’s biggest luxury company, has been slower than the rest of the industry to embrace sustainability. One year into implementing a new plan to overhaul its supply chain, the company’s position is changing: it now has potential to become a leader on sustainability in fashion.

It took until last November for LVMH, which owns luxury brands Louis Vuitton, Dior, Celine, Givenchy and Tiffany among others, to join the UN Fashion Charter; and it only released its first comprehensive social and environmental report, including a new sustainability plan, called Life 360, in May 2021. By that point, many other companies, from H&M and Inditex to LVMH’s main competitor and Gucci-owner Kering, had released major sustainability initiatives and filled out their sustainability teams internally.

Life 360 could make up for lost time. By recognising the need to slow volume growth and focusing on actions rather than claims of progress, Life 360 embodies a holistic approach to sustainability, across LVMH brands and the full supply chain. It also lays out a plan to address the company’s total impact, as opposed to just at product-level. Both are often missing from fashion’s approach to sustainability.

In an interview with Vogue Business, group environment development deputy director Alexandre Capelli shed light on how some of these efforts are starting to take shape. The group is looking at ways to utilise waste from its champagne business and repurpose it to replace harmful substances in the fashion supply chain, and has a goal for 25 per cent of profits to be generated by circular services — instead of new products — by 2030. LVMH is embracing regenerative agriculture, a growing focus for the industry broadly, and Capelli says they’re taking the concept beyond farming to include a product’s full lifecycle, from product design to end-of-life: “Regenerative design means regenerative materials, regenerative processes — and it’s not easy to define, or even to find regenerative processes for each material — and also circular design. If you have all of that, then maybe we can start to talk about regenerative design,” he says.

The plan would bring LVMH up to speed with some of its rivals. Kering has “reimagined” its brands to become more sustainable and inclusive, according to Edited market analyst Kayla Marci, through various initiatives and by overhauling materials, “including phasing out fur across all labels, something LVMH have not yet done”. With the comprehensive Life 360 plan, LVMH has a chance to lead, rather than follow, as sustainability becomes an increasingly competitive advantage for luxury companies."
Origin Materials and LVMH Beauty partner for sustainable packaging solution - Packaging Gateway,"Wed, 20 Apr 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBhY2thZ2luZy1nYXRld2F5LmNvbS9uZXdzL29yaWdpbi1tYXRlcmlhbHMtbHZtaC1iZWF1dHkv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Origin Materials has entered into a strategic partnership with LVMH Beauty, a division of LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, to develop sustainable, low-carbon footprint packaging solutions.

The partners signed a multi-year capacity reservation agreement, through which LVMH Beauty will purchase sustainable, carbon-negative polyethylene terephthalate (PET) from Origin Materials for perfumes and cosmetics products.

Origin Materials’ PET is made from sustainable wood residues, which capture carbon and offers similar functionality to petroleum-based PET, but with a reduced carbon footprint.

In addition, it can be recycled in the same way as fossil-based PET within the existing infrastructure.

LVMH Beauty executive president and managing director Claude Martinez said: “At LVMH, with our Life 360 programme, we made the decision that our packaging will contain zero plastic from virgin fossil resources in [the] near future.

“Origin’s bioplastic technologies are playing a crucial role in helping LVMH achieve our sustainability targets, without any compromise on quality. LVMH Beauty is happy to collaborate with Origin, supporting innovative technologies.”

LVMH’s Selective Retailing unit witnessed a 24% increase in organic revenue during the three-month period from a year prior.

Its Wines and Spirits business group reported the weakest performance, with organic growth of 2% during the quarter, amid supply chain issues.

These results were despite the resurgence of Covid-19 disruptions in the Chinese market, as well as economic disruption caused by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

In a statement, LVMH said: “LVMH had a good start to the year against a backdrop of continued disruption from the health crisis and marked by the dramatic events in Ukraine.

“The LVMH Group is closely monitoring developments in Ukraine and the region.

“Its first priority was to ensure the safety of its employees in Ukraine and to provide them with all the necessary financial and operational assistance.”

Last month, LVMH temporarily closed all 124 of its stores in Russia in response to the country’s invasion of Ukraine."
LVMH fashion sales rise 30% as it braces for impact of China lockdowns - Vogue Business,"Tue, 12 Apr 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZvZ3VlYnVzaW5lc3MuY29tL2NvbXBhbmllcy9sdm1oLWZhc2hpb24tc2FsZXMtcmlzZS0zMC1wZXItY2VudC1hcy1pdC1icmFjZXMtZm9yLWltcGFjdC1vZi1jaGluYS1sb2NrZG93bnPSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"To receive the Vogue Business newsletter, sign up here.

LVMH said its fashion and leather goods business grew sales by 30 per cent in the first quarter of 2022, but the company warned about a short-term impact as lockdowns in China continue.

Asia, not including Japan, reported the slowest growth by region for the quarter, increasing by 8 per cent. The United States, Japan and Europe saw sales climb by double-digit percentages.

“The only thing that I can confirm is that we will be impacted by that,” LVMH CFO Jean Jacques Guiony told analysts and reporters on Tuesday, referring to the Covid resurgence in China. “The situation is changing pretty fast, and what is true today may be wrong tomorrow. Obviously, we are subject to some lockdowns in some cities, including Shanghai [and] to a lesser extent, Shenzhen. Despite some cities not being locked down, the traffic is on the way down. So, obviously, this is adding some impact.”

Analysts expected the fashion division to grow by 23 per cent. Louis Vuitton and Dior, LVMH’s biggest brands, led the sales jump, while the company also recognised Fendi, Celine, Loro Piana, Loewe and Marc Jacobs for strong performances. Organic growth increased 23 per cent compared to the same period last year, to €18 billion.

“LVMH produced another material beat to consensus expectations,” writes Bernstein analyst Luca Solca, who notes that the perfume and cosmetics division was also ahead. “The year starts on a high note. All eyes and questions are most probably on China and the effect of the pandemic.”

Read More LVMH, Kering and Richemont shares fall amid Covid reemergence in Asia Cases in China and Korea are spiking. Luxury was ready before. What does it mean this time?

China reinstated lockdowns in cities including Shanghai as Covid cases began to rise again, stemming business activity in the key luxury region. Luxury companies, many of which reported rebounding growth in 2021 earlier this year, braced for impact. Analysts predicted that the lockdowns, which hurt sales as well as the supply chain, would hurt brands going into the beginning of the financial year, but that large companies should be better prepared this time around.

Guiony likened the situation in China to two years ago and said the company is not worried about long-term impacts. “Chinese authorities have demonstrated an ability to take very energetic and broad-reaching measures to contain the pandemic in a fairly short period of time. So one could be hopeful that they will do the same again,” he told investors on Tuesday. As of this week, some lockdown measures were beginning to lift in Shanghai, but China has not backed away from its zero-Covid policy. The second takeaway from 2020 experiences [is] that, although this could have an impact short term, it has no impact whatsoever on the strength of demand. And once the whole thing is under control and is over, we see demand coming back to our stores exactly the same way as it was prior to the lockdowns.”"

He predicted Shanghai’s lockdowns will ease “relatively soon”.

In a call on Tuesday, Chief Financial Officer Jean-Jacques Guiony told analysts he is confident about medium to long-term demand in China once the situation gets back to normal.

LVMH warned it was currently seeing a negative impact on demand for luxury products due to lockdowns in China - a potential early warning for the rest of the industry.

Earlier, LVMH reported that first-quarter sales advanced 23 per cent on an organic basis to €18 billion (US$19.5 billion). Analysts had expected a gain of 17 per cent. The company was led by its biggest unit, fashion and leather goods, the Paris-based company said in a statement Tuesday.

Led by billionaire founder Bernard Arnault, LVMH is the first European luxury-goods maker to publish revenue for the period, so its results may indicate how other companies have fared.

LVMH’s organic revenue in the US and Europe grew at 26 per cent and 45 per cent, respectively, in the quarter. That compares with an 8 per cent gain for Asia, excluding Japan, a region that represented 37 per cent of revenue. The US, meanwhile, generated about a quarter of the company’s revenue.

The wine and spirits unit was the only division not to grow at double digits due to supply constraints, notably for its Hennessy cognac, where volume decreased 18 per cent during the period.

LVMH partially offset the drop in volume with price increases, said Chris Hollis, who oversees investor relations, during the call. Hollis warned against extrapolating the muted performance for this unit, given the first quarter tends to be volatile and a less important period following the holiday shopping season.

The luxury industry has been relying on price increases to offset inflation. Louis Vuitton raised prices by around 6 per cent in the first quarter, according to Stifel estimates.

Guiony said most group brands have increased prices in “a meaningful way” during the period.

LVMH closed its stores in Russia on March 6 following the invasion of Ukraine, a conflict that could dent consumers’ “feel-good factor” when it comes to luxury purchases, according to Telsey Advisory Group. Russian nationals are estimated to account for less than 1.5 per cent of LVMH’s sales, according to Morgan Stanley.

Revenue at LVMH’s fashion and leather goods unit, which houses Louis Vuitton and Dior, soared 30 per cent, beating analysts’ forecast for a gain of 23 per cent.

As part of the agreement, LVMH has signed a multi-year capacity reservation agreement with Origin Materials to purchase sustainable, carbon-negative polyethylene terephthalate (PET) for use in packaging for the Beauty division. PET produced using Origin technology is functionally identical to petroleum-based PET, but with a dramatically lower carbon footprint since it is made from sustainable wood residues that capture carbon, according to Origin. In addition, Origin PET is equally recyclable to fossil-based PET within the existing infrastructure, which is critical to creating a circular economy with a significantly reduced carbon footprint.

Origin aims to continue to work with LVMH Beauty on sustainable packaging solutions across its family of brands, which includes Parfums Christian Dior, Parfums Givenchy and Guerlain. Origin’s technology can help LVMH Beauty brands reduce the carbon impact of their products while maintaining the premium aesthetics and zero-compromise performance that luxury customers expect.

“At LVMH, with our Life 360 program, we made the decision that our packaging will contain zero plastic from virgin fossil resources in a near future,” said Claude Martinez, executive president and managing director, LVMH Beauty. “Origin’s bioplastic technologies are playing a crucial role in helping LVMH achieve our sustainability targets without any compromise on quality. LVMH Beauty is happy to collaborate with Origin, supporting innovative technologies.”

Origin said its patented technology platform can help revolutionize the production of a wide range of end products, including clothing, textiles, plastics, packaging, car parts, tires, carpeting and toys, with an estimated $1 trillion addressable market. In addition, Origin’s technology platform is expected to provide stable pricing largely decoupled from the petroleum supply chain, which is exposed to more volatility than supply chains based on sustainable wood residues.

Origin Materials co-CEO Rich Riley said the company’s mission of “enabling the world’s transition to sustainable materials as fast as possible” aligns with LVMH’s ambitious environmental initiatives.

“We look forward to helping LVMH reduce its carbon footprint and achieve its sustainability goals while continuing to deliver superior product experiences to its customers,” Riley said.

Headquartered in West Sacramento, Calif., Origin Materials has developed a platform for turning the carbon found in inexpensive, plentiful, non-food biomass such as sustainable wood residues into useful materials while capturing carbon in the process. Origin’s patented drop-in core technology, economics and carbon impact are supported by a growing list of major global customers and investors.

In February, Origin said it plans to build its first world-scale manufacturing facility, dubbed Origin 2, in Geismar, La. The facility would produce carbon-negative materials used to make PET plastic, which is used in packaging, textiles, apparel and other applications, as well as hydrothermal carbon that can be used in fuel pellets, as activated carbon, and as a replacement for carbon black.

The plant would convert an estimated 1 million dry metric tons of wood residues each year into products for a wide range of end markets. The company expects construction to begin in mid-2023 and for the plant to be mechanically completed and operational by mid-2025."

LVMH, which counts blockbuster scents such as Guerlain’s Shalimar, Christian Dior’s J’Adore, and Maison Francis Kurkdjian’s Baccarat Rouge 540 (since the house’s acquisition in 2017) to its product portfolio, has agreed to a multiyear capacity reservation agreement with carbon-negative materials company Origin Materials. The aim of the partnership is to develop carbon-negative PET packaging, derived from sustainable wood residues and just as recyclable as its fossil-based counterpart, for the conglomerate’s perfumes and cosmetics.



The material is also easily processable using existing recycling infrastructures, an important aspect given the fact that recyclable PET needs specific facilities for processing which are not easily accessible to all consumers. “At LVMH, with our Life 360 program, we made the decision that our packaging will contain zero plastic from virgin fossil resources in a near future. Origin’s bioplastic technologies are playing a crucial role in helping LVMH achieve our sustainability targets without any compromise on quality,” says Executive President & Managing Director at LVMH Beauty, Claude Martinez.



Origin Materials, founded in 2008, already produces recycled, plant-based PET bottles for the likes of Nestlé Waters, Danone, and PepsiCo, with applications of its product materials produced from non-food biomass in the toy, clothing, textiles, and car parts markets. This initiative presents the next chapter of its efforts in the luxury cosmetics realm. “Our mission of enabling the world’s transition to sustainable materials as fast as possible is completely aligned with LVMH’s ambitious environmental initiatives,” comments Origin Materials co-CEO Rich Riley. “We look forward to helping LVMH reduce its carbon footprint and achieve its sustainability goals while continuing to deliver superior product experiences to its customers.”"
The 3 Best Stocks to Set You Up for Early Retirement - The Motley Fool,"Tue, 05 Apr 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIyLzA0LzA1L3RoZS0zLWJlc3Qtc3RvY2tzLXRvLXNldC15b3UtdXAtZm9yLWVhcmx5LXJldGlyZW1lL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LVMH, L'Oréal, and Lululemon are all solid retirement plays.

For many investors, the ultimate goal of investing is to enjoy a comfortable retirement. The basics seem deceptively simple: Buy some shares of well-run companies, reinvest their dividends, and ignore the near-term volatility.

However, it can be surprisingly difficult to find stocks that can be reliably held for the next few decades. Even the best companies can run out of room to grow, get disrupted by aggressive newcomers, become complacent under weak management, and fail to survive economic downturns.

In my opinion, the best stocks for an early retirement share four qualities: an evergreen brand, a wide moat, clear plans for the future, and a history of generating consistent returns for at least the past ten years. These three companies check all four boxes: LVMH Moët Hennessy (LVMUY -1.91%), L'Oréal (LRLCY -1.48%), and Lululemon Athletica (LULU -2.38%).

1. LVMH Moët Hennessy

LVMH is the world's largest luxury company. The French conglomerate was established 34 years ago and owns 75 houses across five main markets: wines & spirits, fashion & leather goods, perfumes & cosmetics, watches & jewelry, and selective retailing. Its most well-known brands include Louis Vuitton, Dior, Fendi, Loewe, Bvlgari, Tiffany & Co., Hennessy, and Sephora.

Between 2011 and 2021, LVMH grew its annual revenue at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 10.5%, even as it endured a series of financial crises in Europe and the temporary closures of its stores throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. Its net profit grew at a CAGR of 14.7%.

LVMH remains such a resilient investment for two simple reasons. First, the company targets affluent consumers who can afford to keep spending money throughout economic downturns. Second, it's so well-diversified that it can easily offset a temporary slowdown in one sector with the growth of its other businesses. That flexibility and resilience make it an evergreen investment.

LVMH's stock has nearly doubled over the past three years, but it still looks reasonably valued at 26 times forward earnings and pays a decent forward yield of 1.5%. Its rival Hermès (HESAY -1.47%), which mainly focuses on the growth of its namesake brand instead of acquisitions, trades at 50 times forward earnings and pays a much lower forward dividend yield of 0.6%.

2. L'Oréal

L'Oréal is the world's largest cosmetics company. The 112-year-old French company operates four main business segments: Professional Products, Consumer Products (mid-range brands), L'Oréal Luxe (higher-end brands), and Active Cosmetics (skincare products). Its top brands include L'Oréal, Lancôme, Maybelline, NYX Cosmetics, and Garnier.

Between 2011 and 2021, L'Oréal's revenue increased at a CAGR of 4.7% as its earnings per share (EPS) grew at a CAGR of 7.4%. Those growth rates aren't as impressive as LVMH's, but L'Oréal also targets higher-end consumers. Cosmetics are also generally resistant to economic downturns because they're considered essential consumer staples.

Therefore, L'Oréal's ability to straddle the luxury and consumer staple markets -- which are both resistant to inflation -- makes it an attractive long-term investment. That's why its shares have risen more than 50% over the past three years.

L'Oréal's stock is a bit pricey today at 36 times forward earnings, and its growing dependence on China might worry some investors. However, I believe L'Oréal will remain an evergreen investment as it locks in customers with its brand appeal and continues to acquire smaller brands to expand its portfolio. The stock also pays a decent forward yield of 1.3%.

3. Lululemon Athletica

Lululemon Athletica carved out a high-growth niche in the yoga apparel, activewear, and athleisure apparel markets over the past two decades. The Canadian retailer differentiated itself from other athletic apparel retailers by aggressively targeting female shoppers, providing free yoga classes, and building a reputation as a higher-end brand with pricier products.

Lululemon's annual revenue rose from $1 billion in 2011 to $6.3 billion in 2021, representing an impressive CAGR of 20.2%. Its EPS grew at a CAGR of 19.4%. During that decade, it more than tripled its number of stores from 174 to 574, and continued to open new locations throughout the pandemic.

Back in 2019, Lululemon claimed it could generate double-digit annual revenue growth through the end of 2023 by doubling its men's revenue, doubling its digital revenue, and quadrupling its international revenue.

The pandemic initially cast some doubts on those plans, but Lululemon surpassed its men's and digital targets in 2021 and plans to quadruple its international sales ahead of schedule in 2022. For 2022, it expects its revenue to grow 20%-22% and for its adjusted EPS to rise 17%-20%.

Lululemon's stock has rallied 120% over the past three years, and it doesn't look cheap at 40 times forward earnings. However, I'd argue that it deserves that premium valuation because it's also a luxury brand that can weather future economic downturns like LVMH and L'Oréal."

First-quarter sales advanced 23% on an organic basis to 18 billion euros ($19.5 billion), led by LVMH’s biggest unit, fashion and leather goods, the Paris-based company said late Tuesday. Analysts had expected a gain of 17%.

Led by billionaire founder Bernard Arnault, LVMH is the first European luxury-goods maker to publish revenue for the period. The owner of Louis Vuitton and Dior was buoyed by resilient demand in the U.S. and Europe.

”The stellar 1Q highlights their geographical and business reach and lack of reliance on any one group, considering the disruption to current trading in China,” wrote Swetha Ramachandran, who manages GAM’s Luxury Brand Equity Fund, in response to a Bloomberg query.

The wine and spirits unit was the only division not to grow at double digits due to supply constraints, notably for its Hennessy cognac, where volume decreased 18% during the period. LVMH partially offset the drop in volume with price increases, said Chris Hollis, who oversees investor relations, during the call.

Hollis said the first quarter tends to be volatile and a less important period following the holiday shopping season.

The luxury industry has been relying on price increases to offset inflation, and Guiony said most LVMH brands have increased prices in “a meaningful way” during the period. Louis Vuitton raised prices by around 6% in the first quarter, according to Stifel estimates.

LVMH’s organic revenue in the U.S. and Europe grew at 26% and 45%, respectively, in the quarter. That compares with an 8% gain for Asia, excluding Japan, a region that represented 37% of revenue. The U.S., meanwhile, generated about a quarter of the company’s revenue.

Revenue at LVMH’s fashion and leather goods unit soared 30%, beating analysts’ forecast for a gain of 23%.

China Effect

Still, the company said it’s currently seeing a negative impact on demand for luxury products due to lockdowns in China.

On a call Tuesday, Chief Financial Officer Jean-Jacques Guiony told analysts he’s confident about medium to long-term demand in China once the situation gets back to normal. He added that Chinese authorities have shown their ability to quickly contain the pandemic before — especially in 2020 — and he doesn’t believe the current situation is worse than it was then. He predicted Shanghai’s lockdowns will ease “relatively soon.”

”Investors are digesting the very strong 1Q performance, but also the uncertain outlook for China,” Bernstein analyst Luca Solca said.

Russia Stores

LVMH closed its stores in Russia on March 6 following the invasion of Ukraine, a conflict that could dent consumers’ “feel-good factor” when it comes to luxury purchases, according to Telsey Advisory Group.

Russian nationals are estimated to account for less than 1.5% of LVMH’s sales, according to Morgan Stanley.

Hospitality Executive Andrea Guerra Is Leaving LVMH in May - WWD,"Thu, 28 Apr 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3dkLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy1uZXdzL2h1bWFuLXJlc291cmNlcy9sdm15LWhvc3BpdGFsaXR5LWNlby1ndWVycmEtbGVhdmluZy0xMjM1MTY4MjQ0L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Andrea Guerra, conscripted in early 2020 as chief executive officer of the newly created LVMH Hospitality Excellence division, is leaving the French luxury group “to pursue other interests.”

An internal announcement at LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, seen by WWD, noted that Guerra will remain in his role until the end of May, and he will then become a strategic and development senior adviser.

Bernard Arnault, chairman and CEO of LVMH Group, thanked Guerra for his “leadership contribution” and noted he “played an instrumental role in raising the ambition of the recently acquired Belmond toward excellence, and ensuring Thélios to become a successful global player in eyewear. He also steered Fendi and Loro Piana with a steady hand and strong results in a period of great uncertainty.

“I am glad he will continue to work with me and the group as an adviser,” Arnault added.

According to market sources, among potential successors for Guerra is Stéphane Rinderknech, who last February exited as CEO of L’Oréal in the U.S. Rinderknech had a 20-year career at the French beauty giant and was seen as a rising star in the industry. Speculation has been rife on both sides of the Atlantic that he will join LVMH in some capacity.

The LVMH internal memo said Guerra’s successor “will be appointed promptly.”

Guerra, a former CEO of eyewear group Luxottica and onetime strategic adviser to former Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi, joined LVMH from Italian high-end food emporium Eataly, where he had been executive chairman since 2015.

At LVMH, he took over an entity that encompasses Hôtels Cheval Blanc and the Belmond Hotels & Luxury Trains and also became a member of the luxury conglomerate’s executive committee. Ultimately, his purview was widened to include oversight of the Fendi and Loro Piana businesses, as well as Thélios, the Italian eyewear firm that LVMH took full control of last year.

LVMH’s surprise $2.6 billion acquisition of Belmond in 2018 was aimed at bulking up the group’s hospitality operations globally and position it as much of a leading player in experiential luxury as it is in fashion, leather goods and prestige wines and spirits. Belmond operates in 24 countries with a portfolio of 46 luxury hotel, restaurant, train and river cruise properties.

However, sources suggested Guerra ultimately was “not a good fit” for the diverse role.

For his part, Guerra said in the LVMH memo that he was “inspired by the group’s culture to succeed through the light of excellence. The maisons I led faced different challenges, and I put my energy and determination to drive them forward. It has been an intense couple of years. I now wish to pursue new entrepreneurial projects.”

A graduate of the University of Rome, Guerra started his career in 1989 with hotel group Marriott International. He has also worked in a variety of executive roles at Merloni Elettrodomestici, an Italian maker of household appliances now known as Indesit Co.

Luxury goods group LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton posted revenue of €18 billion in the first quarter of 2022, up +29% compared to the same period in 2021. Organic revenue growth was +23%.

All business groups achieved double-digit revenue growth, except for wines & spirits, which continued to see supply constraints. By region, the US and Europe achieved double-digit revenue growth; Asia continued to grow over the quarter despite the impact of a tightening of health restrictions in China in March.

In the Selective Retailing division, which includes DFS Group (co-owned by LVMH and DFS Co-Founder Robert Miller) and Starboard Cruise Services, organic revenue growth was up +24%. DFS’s revenue rose in the quarter, reported LVMH, but at a lower level “due to the persistent weakness of international travel”.

Wines & Spirits recorded +2% organic growth year-on-year. Volumes rose sharply in the Champagne business, particularly in Europe and Japan. Maison Armand de Brignac, which has been 50% owned by LVMH since May 2021, is included for the first time in the first quarter accounts. Hennessy Cognac saw volumes decrease compared to the first quarter of 2021 due to supply and logistical constraints at the beginning of the year. Glenmorangie whisky and Belvedere vodka recorded strong growth, said LVMH.

The Fashion & Leather Goods business group recorded organic revenue growth of +30% in Q1 2022, led by Louis Vuitton, while Christian Dior had a “remarkable performance” stated the company. Fendi recorded solid growth, Celine was buoyed by its ready-to-wear and leather goods lines designed by Hedi Slimane and Loro Piana, Loewe with J.W. Anderson, and Marc Jacobs all had good quarters.

In Perfumes & Cosmetics, organic revenue growth was +17% year-on-year, aided by sustained growth in perfume and makeup, particularly in the US. Strong performances from Dior, Guerlain Parfums Givenchy and Francis Kurkdjian contributed.

The Watches & Jewelry business group recorded organic revenue growth of +19%, with Tiffany & Co. buoyed by strong growth in the US. At Bulgari, the Serpenti line, high jewellery and watch collections, including the new Octo Finissimo Ultra watch, were the main drivers of growth. Chaumet and Fred had “excellent performances” in the quarter. The group’s watchmaking houses unveiled new products at the Watches & Wonders Exhibition, with watch innovations from TAG Heuer, Hublot and Zenith."

The two-year research initiative will develop new lab-grown fur fibers for luxury fashion. For the first time, keratin will be the focus of a study to develop a fiber capable of mimicking a range of luxury materials, including fur, LVMH noted.

The collaborators said to sustain and regenerate the environment, it is essential to learn from the biological world and explore new ways of working with micro-organisms and living systems. LVMH, including Fendi, and Central Saint Martins, have made a commitment to develop research in regenerative luxury through their partnership.

The new collaboration with Imperial College London brings together the expertise of its Professor Tom Ellis in synthetic biology and Central Saint Martins’ Professor Carole Collet in biodesign to grow novel functional biomaterials for luxury.

“The LVMH Life 360 environmental strategy integrates a research and innovation program dedicated to sustainable luxury,” said Hélène Valade, environmental development director for LVMH, which owns labels including Christian Dior, Stella McCartney, which has already explored bio-based fur alternatives, and Givenchy. “Inventing new materials, new regenerative practices and new technologies will enable our maisons to achieve their climate and biodiversity ambitions. We are pleased that the Central Saint Martins-LVMH program dedicated to regenerative luxury, Maison/0, set up in 2017, leads to concrete results such as this initiative.”

Carole Collet, professor in design for sustainable futures at Central Saint Martins and director of Maison/0, the Central Saint Martins-LVMH creative platform for regenerative luxury, said biodesign research is a means to explore alternative futures and transition to new models of production informed by how biology works.

“Learning from Nature, and working at the intersection of design and biotechnology research, is key to the exploration of such future-facing innovation,” Collet said. “I am, therefore, delighted to collaborate with our Maison/0 partner, LVMH, as well as Fendi and Professor Tom Ellis at Imperial College London to prototype a like-for-like alternative lab-grown fur fiber for luxury.”

Imperial College London’s Ellis said the industry’s understanding of biological materials and how they are made by nature has increased dramatically in the past decade.

“It is now the perfect time to initiate the idea of designing fibers for fashion made sustainably from microbes,” he said. “It’s exciting to begin this new collaboration with luxury leader LVMH and globally recognized fashion brand Fendi, and a world-leading expert in biodesign, Professor Carole Collet at Central Saint Martins.”

As part of the Life 360 initiative, last week LVMH Beauty and Origin Materials Inc. created a strategic partnership to develop sustainable low-carbon footprint packaging for the perfumes and cosmetics industry, with potential applications from apparel to toys.

The agreement calls for LVMH to purchase sustainable, carbon-negative polyethylene terephthalate (PET) from Origin Materials for use in packaging for the Beauty division. PET produced using Origin technology is functionally identical to petroleum-based PET, but with a dramatically lower carbon footprint since it is made from sustainable wood residues that capture carbon, according to Origin."

LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, the world’s largest luxury conglomerate, has had a great start to 2022. Its first quarter financial results recorded revenue of €18 billion, a 29 per cent increase compared to the same period in 2021. Organic revenue was 23 per cent. The group revealed that all its business groups achieved double-digit growth, except its Wines & Spirits division, which continued to face supply constraints.

Geographically, the US and Europe both logged double-digit revenue growth, dispelling concerns about the impact of the war in Ukraine on its sales. While in Asia (excluding Japan), demand continued to increase despite the effects of a tightening of health restrictions in Mainland China. Chief financial offer Jean-Jacques Guiony shared that between 15 per cent to 25 per cent of its stores in the country had to be closed since 15 March. However, Guiony is confident that the Chinese market luxury will bounce back as it has in the past.

“The Chinese authorities have demonstrated an ability to take very energetic and broad-reaching measures to contain the pandemic in a fairly short period of time, so one could be hopeful that they will do the same again,” he said.

The various global events in the first quarter of 2022 definitely altered the outlook for the luxury conglomerate. Strong sales in the US, which was up 26 per cent, overtook China to be the group’s largest market. Europe grew by 45 per cent and Japan by 30 per cent.

In the Fashion & Leather goods division, it posted organic revenue growth of 30 per cent in Q1. This is mainly due to its two star brands: Louis Vuitton and Dior. The former presented the late Virgil Abloh’s final Autumn/Winter 2022 menswear collection earlier in February, while Nicolas Ghesquière unveiled the women’s collection at the Musée d’Orsay in Paris — a first for the brand. At Dior, the Maison reopened its historic flagship at 30 Avenue Montaigne, a symbol of the couture house’s exceptional savoir-faire and a holistic experience of Dior’s world.

Other brands under the division like Fendi, also posted “solid growth” under the direction of Kim Jones, while Celine achieved stunning success for its ready-to-wear and leather goods lines designed by Hedi Slimane.

At the Watches & Jewellery division, LVMH announced its organic sales grew by 17 per cent compared to the same period last year. The group shared that Tiffany & Co. had a solid start to the year with healthy demand from the US market. It noted that the new Knot collection was particularly successful. For Bvlgari, the main attractions would be its Serpenti line as well as its high jewellery and watch collection, especially the Octo Finissimo Ultra watch, which holds the title of the world’s thinnest mechanical watch.

For watchmaking houses, brands continued to showcase exceptional pieces. They had done so at the recently concluded Watches & Wonders Geneva 2022 fair. TAG Heuer, Zenith and Hublot all displayed new products to cement itself to be one of the top watch brands in the world.

For the other divisions, its Perfumes & Cosmetics sales saw a 17 per cent increase. In Selective Retailing, organic revenue growth was up 24 per cent, with Sephora leading the charge.

“In the current geopolitical context and in light of the ongoing impact of the pandemic, LVMH remains both vigilant and confident at the beginning of this year. The Group will continue to pursue its strategy focused on the development of its brands, driven by strong innovation and investment as well as a constant quest for quality in its products and their distribution,” said the group in a release.

“LVMH relies on the talent and motivation of its teams, the diversity of its businesses and the geographical balance of its revenues to further strengthen its global leadership position in luxury goods in 2022.”

The wine and spirits arm of LVMH was the only sector that did not record double-digit growth during the company’s first quarter.

Wine and spirits experienced organic revenue growth of 2% during the first quarter of 2022, compared with the same period last year.

Sales during Q1 reached €1.638 billion (US$1.775bn), up from €1.510bn (US$1.636bn) in 2021.

Hennessy Cognac saw sales decrease over the three-month period because of supply and logistical constraints at the start of the year.

However, this was offset by ‘strong growth’ from Glenmorangie whisky and Belvedere vodka, the firm said.

In its financial statement, LVMH said: “In the current geopolitical context and in light of the ongoing impact of the pandemic, LVMH remains both vigilant and confident at the beginning of this year.

“The group will continue to pursue its strategy focused on the development of its brands, driven by strong innovation and investment, as well as a constant quest for quality in its products and their distribution.”

LVMH noted a ‘good start’ overall to its 2022 financial year despite the ongoing pandemic and the war in Ukraine.

Total sales in the US and Europe rose by double digits. Asia also continued to grow despite fresh lockdown measures in China in March.

LVMH said it was ‘closely monitoring’ developments in Ukraine and the region, and would prioritise the safety of its employees in Ukraine.

Beauty, the French luxury group's fragrances and cosmetics division, which includes brands like and , has signed a multi-year partnership deal with Origin Materials, a US company specialised in manufacturing carbon-negative materials. LVMH is looking to buy carbon-negative PET for producing the packaging of its perfumes and beauty products.







LVMH has boosted its sustainability efforts by partnering with Origin Materials - Parfums Christian Dior



“PET produced using Origin’s technology is functionally identical to petroleum-based PET, but has a significantly lower carbon footprint, since it is manufactured from wood residue that absorbs carbon. Origin’s PET is also as recyclable as fossil-based PET within the existing infrastructure, which is critical to creating a circular economy with a significantly reduced carbon footprint,” said Origin Materials which, according to US media, is soon expected to make an investment of approximately $750 million in a plant for transforming wood residue into bio-sourced materials, located in Louisiana, USA.



By joining forces with Origin Materials, the LVMH group, one of the first members of EcoBeautyScore, a consortium that aims to develop an industry-wide environmental impact assessment and scoring system for beauty products, has strengthened its commitment to increased sustainability. Claude Martinez, executive president and CEO of LVMH Beauty, said in a press release: “At LVMH, with our Life 360 programme, we made the decision that our packaging will contain zero plastic from virgin fossil resources in a near future. Origin’s bioplastic technologies are playing a crucial role in helping LVMH achieve our sustainability targets without any compromise on quality.”

LVMH, the world's number one luxury group, generated sales worth €18 billion in Q1 of the 2022 fiscal year, equivalent to a 29% increase over the same quarter last year. Sales for the group’s perfumes and cosmetics division increased by 23%, reaching €1.9 billion.

UPDATE May 11, 2022: Esplanade owner: Louis Vuitton store will remain open in Palm Beach after renewing lease

Original story:

Louis Vuitton, ranked as the world’s most valuable luxury brand, is closing its store in The Esplanade at 150 Worth Ave. in Palm Beach, on May 31 and leaving the island.

Louis Vuitton is part of Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, commonly referred to LVMH Group. The French luxury goods conglomerate headquartered in Paris consists of 60 subsidiaries with 75 brands sold in 80 countries, according to LVMH’s annual report. It has more than 5,000 stores around the world.

The departure marks the end of the store’s 40-year run in Palm Beach. It opened on Nov. 18, 1982, at 251 Worth Ave., and in 2000 moved to the Esplanade.

The Palm Beach Daily News covered the 1982 opening with photos and an article headlined “Party Has Trans-Atlantic Flavor.”

Francois Poirel, who was the company’s vice president at the time, said, “We’re basically luggage people. There’s nothing trendy about us. Our designs are timeless, elegant and durable.”

Why is Louis Vuitton store on Worth Avenue in Palm Beach closing?

Yvonne Jones, director of property management of O’Connor Capital Partners, which manages the Esplanade, confirmed the store is closing but did not comment on why it is leaving. A company representative said Thursday that she could not confirm or deny any information about the store.

Louis Vuitton, known for its signature monogrammed handbags, luggage and more, has a shop at The Gardens Mall in Palm Beach Gardens where the stores are open seven days a week and the hours are longer than on Worth Avenue. That store is expected to remain open, commercial real estate brokers say.

Retail observers speculated the retailer is seeking a broader customer base and that the brand is no longer exclusive enough for Worth Avenue shoppers. A new Louis Vuitton handbag can be purchased on the company’s website starting at $2,030, and its luxury goods are available at in-store buying areas at stores such as Nordstrom, Bloomingdale’s and Neiman Marcus. However, brands such as Chanel, Hermes and Lana Marks start at a higher price point.

Louis Vuitton is known for never discounting its goods, and no going-out-of-business sale is expected at the Worth Avenue store. If a consumer finds marked-down Louis Vuitton merchandise online, it is most likely fake.

In 2021, LMVH Group ranked as the world’s most valuable luxury brand with a value of $75.7 billion, according to Kantar BrandZ. It ranked 21st among all companies, but first in the consumer products category. Its stock is listed on the Euronext Paris Eurolist.

Interbrand’s 2021 Top Global Brands report placed Louis Vuitton at number 13, ahead of Chanel and Hermes at 22 and 23. Apple, Amazon and Microsoft took the top three spots.

In addition to Louis Vuitton, LVMH’s best-known brands in fashion and leather goods include Christian Dior Couture, Celine, Emilio Pucci, Fendi, Givenchy and Marc Jacobs. In the perfume and cosmetics category, it owns Christian Dior, Guerlain, Givenchy, Benefit and others. Moët Chandon, Dom Pérignon and Hennessy are among its wine and spirits holdings. It also owns beauty store Sephora, which it acquired in 1997.

Louis Vuitton founded the company in Paris in 1854 with the introduction of a flat, rectangular canvas trunk. This was revolutionary, because unlike the trunks with rounded tops that were the standard, the trunks could be stacked. His designs were popular, and like they are today, were copied. That led him to put beige and brown stripes on his products."
LVMH hits €18bn in Q1 while DFS revenue increases at 'lower level' - TRBusiness,"Wed, 13 Apr 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRyYnVzaW5lc3MuY29tL3JlZ2lvbmFsLW5ld3MvaW50ZXJuYXRpb25hbC9sdm1oLWhpdHMtZTE4Ym4taW4tcTEtd2hpbGUtZGZzLXJldmVudWUtaW5jcmVhc2VzLWF0LWxvd2VyLWxldmVsLzIxNzc4NtIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Luxury goods giant, LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, recorded revenue of €18 billion/US$19.5bn in the first quarter of 2022, up 29% compared to the same period in 2021, while the group reported organic revenue growth of 23%.

Its luxury travel retail subsidiary, DFS Group continued to be challenged by the pandemic and its impact on international travel, however, LVMH did report that revenue had increased, albeit at a ‘lower level’.

LVMH pointed out that DFS had developed several digital initiatives for more effective interaction with customers and that its La Samaritaine Paris Pont-Neuf store, which finally opened in June 2021 after numerous delays due to the pandemic, had been well received by local clientele.

The Selective Retailing division, which houses DFS Group, Starboard Cruise Services and Sephora, registered organic revenue growth of 24% in the first quarter of 2022 compared to the same period of 2021. Sephora achieved ‘excellent performance in the quarter’ with a strong rebound in the activity in its own store network, which had been partly closed at the beginning of 2021.

STRONG MOMENTUM IN NORTH AMERICA, FRANCE & MIDDLE EAST

LVMH said momentum was particularly strong in North America, France and the Middle East, driven notably by perfume.

LVMH said the group overall enjoyed a ‘good start to the year against a backdrop of continued disruption from the health crisis and marked by the dramatic events in Ukraine’. All business groups achieved double-digit revenue growth, except for Wines & Spirits, which continued to suffer from ‘supply constraints’.

The United States and Europe also achieved double-digit revenue growth; Asia continued to grow over the quarter despite the impact of a tightening of health restrictions in China in March.

‘CLOSELY MONITORING DEVELOPMENTS IN UKRAINE’

“The LVMH Group is closely monitoring developments in Ukraine and the region,” said the group in a statement. “Its first priority was to ensure the safety of its employees in Ukraine and to provide them with all the necessary financial and operational assistance.”

The Wines & Spirits business group recorded organic revenue growth of 2% in the first quarter of 2022 compared to the same period of 2021. The Champagne business had an excellent start to the year, with volumes rising sharply, particularly in Europe and Japan, and a firm price increase policy.

Maison Armand de Brignac, which has been 50% owned by LVMH since May 2021, is included for the first time in the first quarter accounts. Hennessy cognac saw its volumes decrease compared to the first quarter of 2021 due to supply and logistical constraints at the beginning of the year. Glenmorangie whisky and Belvedere vodka recorded strong growth.

The Fashion & Leather Goods business group recorded organic revenue growth of 30% in the first quarter of 2022, while Louis Vuitton ‘had an excellent start to the year, driven as always by its strong creativity’ said LVMH.

Fendi recorded solid growth, driven in particular by the success of Kim Jones’ collections. Celine achieved very strong growth thanks to the remarkable success of its ready-to-wear and leather goods lines designed by Hedi Slimane. Loro Piana, Loewe with J.W. Anderson, and Marc Jacobs all had a very good quarter.

PERFUME AND COSMETICS ORGANIC GROWTH +17%

In Perfumes & Cosmetics, organic revenue growth was 17% in the first quarter of 2022 compared to the same period of 2021. The business group enjoyed excellent momentum thanks to sustained growth in perfume and makeup, particularly in the United States.

Christian Dior achieved remarkable growth and gained market share, benefiting from the progress of its iconic fragrances Sauvage, Miss Dior and J’Adore, and its makeup. Guerlain successfully rolled out its Aqua Allegoria line and its new collection of fine perfumery l’Art et la Matière. Its Abeille Royale skincare line also contributed to the performance of the Maison. Parfums Givenchy unveiled its new eau de toilette Fraîche Irresistible. Maison Francis Kurkdjian continued to see rapid growth.

In the first quarter of 2022, the Watches & Jewellery business group recorded organic revenue growth of 19% compared to the same period of 2021. In jewellery, Tiffany & Co. had an excellent start to the year, still driven by strong growth in the United States. The new Knot collection was particularly successful.

At Bulgari, the Serpenti line, high jewellery and watch collections, including the new Octo Finissimo Ultra watch, were the main drivers of growth. Chaumet and Fred had an excellent performance in the quarter. All of LVMH’s watchmaking Maisons continued to see strong momentum and unveiled numerous new products at the Watches & Wonders Exhibition, with watch innovations from TAG Heuer, Hublot and Zenith.

“In the current geopolitical context and in light of the ongoing impact of the pandemic, LVMH remains both vigilant and confident at the beginning of this year,” said LVMH in a statement.

“The Group will continue to pursue its strategy focused on the development of its brands, driven by strong innovation and investment as well as a constant quest for quality in its products and their distribution.”"
What's Next for Luxury Brands and Blockchain - The Business of Fashion,"Thu, 14 Apr 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzb2ZmYXNoaW9uLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy9sdXh1cnkvd2hhdHMtbmV4dC1mb3ItbHV4dXJ5LWJyYW5kcy1hbmQtYmxvY2tjaGFpbi_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Last year, in a rare example of luxury rivals joining forces, LVMH, Cartier and Prada united to form Aura, a consortium dedicated to mounting shared solutions for brands to leverage emerging blockchain technologies. The group hopes that blockchain’s tamper-proof and decentralised database will help brands fight counterfeits, reassure consumers and create a more sustainable industry by making it easier to track products and materials.

A year after the consortium was formed, the platform is now expanding its remit to help brands get in on the non-fungible token (NFT) craze.

Aura has built an NFT gifting solution that will help its member brands issue unique digital “twins” to consumers alongside the physical products they sell, the group’s general secretary Daniela Ott said. Aura has also developed a white-label service for brands to help them issue NFTs through their e-commerce flagships.

At a dinner hosted by Aura in Paris Tuesday, executives of member brands spoke about where they saw the role of blockchain and NFTs headed in the luxury industry.

“We see NFTs as a tool ... that can generate interest, can generate a new ecosystem, and also, of course, some extra revenues for our brands,” said Stefano Rosso, board member at Diesel- and Margiela-owner OTB, which became a partner in the consortium last October. Rosso has since founded a unit within OTB dedicated to fashion in the metaverse, called BVX.

Aura’s expansion into NFT shows the consortium keeping up with the technology zeitgeist, as awareness for digital artworks and collectibles linked to blockchains has exploded in the past year.

The group’s members also pointed to progress on Aura’s original mandate of using blockchain to ensure authenticity of luxury items in a market rife with counterfeits. By the end of April, all products from Prada and its sister brand Miu Miu will be embedded with NFC or RFID tags linking them to Aura’s platform, Lorenzo Bertelli, group marketing director and head of CSR, said.

Maison Margiela is now using the system to allow consumers’ to authenticate certain handbags, with OTB stablemates Jil Sander and Marni also set to roll out the technology soon.

Cartier has piloted using Aura’s system in its aftercare program, allowing customers to opt in for the brand to permanently log information about maintenance for their jewellery and watches on the blockchain’s decentralised database ― creating a record of whether its valuable products have been properly cared for.

As luxury resale booms, efforts like these have become more important for brands and platforms, as well as individual buyers and sellers, to be able to guarantee the authenticity and condition of products being sold.

“This adds a layer of trust [and] transparency,” said Angela Au-Yeung, Cartier’s international innovation director.

Overall, the platform says it created digital identities for tens of millions of products on the blockchain in the last year.

Some members said they were now exploring adding a richer variety of content to the blockchain, which could include information about brand heritage or the design and manufacturing process rather than simply logging an item’s chain of custody. “It’s a fantastic opportunity to tell a story about our products,” said Franck Le Moal, LVMH’s chief information officer.

Getting all of the luxury industry onboard onto the same platform would be advantageous, as suppliers and consumers would get a standardised system to work with. Aura says it’s open for all brands to join, and is still onboarding new members: Swiss jeweller Chopard became the latest brand to join the consortium this month. Yet major players like Kering, Chanel and Hermès remain to be convinced.

The nascent technology still faces some challenges and limitations. The blockchain’s records may be incorruptible, but are only as good as the information entered into it, Bertelli pointed out. A blockchain ledger wouldn’t prevent a supplier from falsely cataloguing its raw materials as being ethically sourced, for example.

Still, the industry remains at the very beginning of its journey with blockchain, according to LVMH’s former chief digital officer Ian Rogers, who is now chief experience officer at the cryptocurrency security company Ledger. But brands that are experimenting now will be able better compete using blockchain and NFTs as the technologies’ importance grows, he said.

“For a 20-year-old kid who trades sneakers, a physical good plus a digital good has more perceived value than a physical good alone,” Rogers said. “So what happens when a brand website sells the physical good, plus the digital good? And the retailer website, who bought from wholesale, sells the physical good only?.”

“[Aura] makes so much sense, because you’re figuring out how to industrialise that,” he added.

Origin’s PET is made from sustainable wood residues which capture carbon and offers similar functionality to petroleum-based PET, but with a reduced carbon footprint. Additionally, it can also be recycled in the same way as fossil-based PET within the existing infrastructure to support a circular economy.

The company will also continue to develop sustainable packaging solutions for LVMH Beauty brands, including Parfums Christian Dior, Parfums Givenchy and Guerlain.

Claude Martinez, Executive President and Managing Director at LVMH Beauty said: ""At LVMH, with our Life 360 program, we made the decision that our packaging will contain zero plastic from virgin fossil resources in the near future.

""Origin's bioplastic technologies are playing a crucial role in helping LVMH achieve our sustainability targets, without any compromise on quality. LVMH Beauty is happy to collaborate with Origin, supporting innovative technologies.""

Rich Riley, co-CEO of Origin Materials added: ""Our mission of enabling the world’s transition to sustainable materials as fast as possible is completely aligned with LVMH’s ambitious environmental initiatives.

He has a staggering net worth that stands at USD 172 billion, as on 15 December 2022. This makes one wonder how the business magnate spends his wealth and what the most expensive things owned by Bernard Arnault are. We take a look.

The French fashion mogul surpassed Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk to grab the apex position on the billionaires’ index. While Musk’s net worth plummeted by USD 107 billion in 2022 due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the Twitter row, Arnault, too, suffered a dip — but a mild one — of USD 7 billion, CNN reported.

The current richest person on the planet has many luxe assets and a lifestyle that defines grandeur and opulence at every turn.

Here are some of the most expensive things owned by Bernard Arnault

Luxury purchases portfolio

He started his journey to the top in the 1980s when he first ventured into fashion with USD 15 million from his father’s construction business. He got the rest of USD 65 million financed from Lazard to buy Boussac – the then-parent company of Christian Dior – in 1985. Since then, Arnault has been acquiring luxury brands and earned nicknames like “the wolf in the cashmere coat” in French media.

In 1987, the conglomerate LVMH came into existence with the merger of Moët & Chandon and Hennessy, the world’s largest champagne and cognac producers, respectively. Bernard Arnault then went on to conquer leading European luxury brands, including couture-brand Givenchy (1988), French perfume, makeup and skincare giant Guerlain (1994), French leather luxury goods brand Céline (1996), the Italian jewellery brand Bvlgari (2011), Paris-based couture house Christian Dior (2017), American luxury jewellery and accessory brand Tiffany & Co. (2020) and Italian luxury label Off-White (2021), bringing the total to 75 stellar brands.

Apart from luxury brands, Bernard Arnault has taken the helm of other pursuits such as hotels, artwork, yachts and culture.

Superyachts

The year 2008 marks Arnault’s passion for yachts when he first acquired the luxury Dutch yacht building firm Royal Van Lent and famed British yacht manufacturer Princess Yachts International in a consortium for over EUR 300 million and EUR 200 million, respectively.

The luxury yacht named Symphony, owned by Arnault, is among the world’s top 100 superyachts and the largest Feadship. Symphony can accommodate 36 passengers and is the first Feadship to cross the 100-metre mark and measures 101.5 metres or about 333 feet.

Designed by Tim Heywood Design, Symphony is an eco-friendly yacht, featuring six decks, an aluminium structure, a gross tonnage of nearly 3,000 GT and a helicopter pad. The interior of the yacht, by Zuretti Interior Design, exudes luxury with a jacuzzi, sauna, lounge and dining area to accommodate 20 people. One of the decks includes a private office and study, beach club, cinema, golf area and wellness centre.

The French yacht enthusiast also owned Amadeus, a superyacht built in 1969, which was given a luxury makeover to host many prominent personalities such as former UK Prime Minister Tony Blair and renowned rockstar Bono. It was later sold in 2015.

Wines and spirits

LVMH’s 23 houses strive together to craft high-end cognacs, wines and champagnes around the world. The key brands include Moët & Chandon, Hennessy, Krug and Château d’Yquem.

Private Island

Bernard Arnault reportedly owns Indigo Island, a 135-acre private island located in the Bahamas that offers retreats for the affluent at a whopping price of approximately USD 300,000 per week.

Artwork

Known for his collection of world-class artworks, the French entrepreneur’s extensive collection of contemporary artwork includes paintings by Picasso, Andy Warhol and Henry Moore. His proximity to art and culture can be established by the fact that LVMH has ventured into many artistic pursuits, including the inception of the idea of the Foundation Louis Vuitton in 2001 — which opened for the public in 2014.

According to Bloomberg, Arnault keeps a collection of the most famous artists in his Paris house.

Luxury hotels

Cheval Blanc and Belmond Hotel are owned by LVMH, which offer extravagance like no other. Cheval Blanc is a luxury hotel with 72 rooms and suites. The hotel also features on-site LV and Dior boutiques for luxury shopping.

LVMH has over 46 Belmond hotel properties across 24 countries and counting.

Saint-Tropez mansion

Bernard Arnault’s house is exactly what you’d expect the house of the richest man in the world to look like. He owns a massive chateau-style waterfront mansion in Saint-Tropez, France, featuring multiple bedrooms, an outdoor swimming pool, a tennis court, a movie theatre and separate quarters for staff.

Private jets

View this post on Instagram A post shared by Bombardier (@bombardier_jets)

Bernard Arnault reportedly splashed USD40 million on his private jet, Dassault Falcon 7X. Previously, he owned a Bombardier Global Express 6000. He also owns an ultra-long-range business jet Bombardier Global 7500 which can accommodate up to 19 passengers.

What is Bernard Arnault’s net worth?

Considered to be the richest man in the world, Bernard Arnault’s net worth, as of April 2023, stands at a whopping USD 228.2 billion dollars.

Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton (LVMH SE)’s revenue growth surpassed estimates as the world’s largest seller of luxury goods defied disruptions from the war in Ukraine and the resurgence of Covid-19 in China.

First-quarter sales advanced 23% on an organic basis to 18 billion euros ($19.5 billion), led by LVMH’s biggest unit, fashion and leather goods, the Paris-based company said in a statement Tuesday. Analysts had expected a gain of 17%.

Led by billionaire founder Bernard Arnault, LVMH is the first European luxury-goods maker to publish revenue for the period, kicking off the reporting season on a positive note. The company said that it remains “vigilant and confident,” in the context of the current geopolitical and global health situation. The U.S. and Europe both recorded double-digit sales increases in the quarter.

LVMH closed its stores in Russia on March 6 following the invasion of Ukraine, a conflict that could dent consumers’ “feel-good factor” when it comes to luxury purchases, according to Telsey Advisory Group. The global shift in mood brought on by the war will probably affect high-end consumption more than a drop in spending from Russian nationals, who are estimated to account for less than 1.5% of LVMH’s sales, according to Morgan Stanley.

The company has also faced lockdowns in Shanghai as the coronavirus spread in parts of China, leading to worsening prospects for the economy and potentially for luxury sales.

Still, revenue at LVMH’s fashion and leather goods unit, which houses Louis Vuitton and Dior, soared 30%, beating analysts’ forecast for a gain of 23%.

The luxury industry has been relying on price increases to offset inflation pressures. Louis Vuitton raised prices by around 6% in the first quarter, according to Stifel estimates.

Chief Financial Officer Jean-Jacques Guiony will speak to the press later Tuesday, and his remarks will by scrutinized, especially on recent demand trends in China.

It is now the perfect time to initiate the idea of designing fibres for fashion made sustainably from microbes. It’s exciting to begin this new collaboration with luxury leader LVMH and globally recognised fashion brand Fendi, and a world-leading expert in biodesign, Professor Carole Collet at Central Saint Martins."""
Bulgari South Asia Pacific regional managing director Jeffrey Hang recaps his 27 years with LVMH - Options The Edge,"Mon, 18 Apr 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiggFodHRwczovL3d3dy5vcHRpb25zdGhlZWRnZS5jb20vdG9waWMvcGVvcGxlL2J1bGdhcmktc291dGgtYXNpYS1wYWNpZmljLXJlZ2lvbmFsLW1hbmFnaW5nLWRpcmVjdG9yLWplZmZyZXktaGFuZy1yZWNhcHMtaGlzLTI3LXllYXJz0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"“Believe it or not, before I joined, I had every Bulgari book,” says Jeffrey Hang, regional managing director of Bulgari South Asia Pacific covering Southeast Asia, India and Oceania. Hang immediately adds that his collection of books numbers an astounding 14,858.

“I bury myself in books. My interests vary from jewellery to equestrian pursuits, not that I am an equestrian but it’s more about the imagery. I guess you can call them coffee table books, but when I travel it is a must that I carve out some time to find a book,” he says.

Considering that Hang has worked all over the world — his 27 years at LVMH have taken him from North America and France to China, Macau and Southeast Asia — it is no wonder that his collection has grown to this incredible number. “I’ve been very privileged. One thing that LVMH does, if you’re willing, is give you opportunities that abound. With more than 70 brands represented on every continent, if you want something, just reach out and tell somebody and you’re going to get that opportunity. With each move, I have covered every single segment of the business, from cosmetics and fashion to watches and jewellery,” he explains.

Born in Singapore and having migrated to the US at a young age, Hang dreamt early on of teaching English literature, which explains his extensive personal library. Although his social nature led him to retail, Hang says, his passion for storytelling still comes through with each new role he takes on. “Just by virtue of that kind of bicultural upbringing, there was a big part of me trying to discover myself while growing up. And the best way I knew to actualise this was by being very social. I knew that whatever I did had to involve people and interacting with them constantly. To be honest, falling into retail was actually that: I fell into it; I didn’t choose it. But here I am, 29 years later, still doing it.”

One of Hang’s career highlights was being appointed senior vice-president and CEO of Louis Vuitton China, a position he held before his current one. “I spent 15 years in China. In 2006, when the group sent me there, we had seven stores and were barely making €2 million a year. When I left at 2019 end, we had 38 stores, and I think [the figure is now] 51 stores. We exceeded expectations as well; China represented almost 30% of the global business for the brand [in 2019]. So, that evolution was tremendous.”

Based in Singapore again — his third professional stint in the city he calls home — this is the first time since joining Bulgari that Hang has been able to travel, and he has brought along a new collection of high jewellery pieces to tour the region. Malaysia is the first stop. For the interview, we are seated in the Bulgari boutique in Pavilion Kuala Lumpur, surrounded by furnishings in soft orange shades and vibrant bouquets. There is an energy that is unique to the Italian luxury brand, represented by the colour and sparkle of its high jewellery pieces and the passion of its people.

According to Hang, this energy emanates throughout the entire business. “It’s the warmth of this organisation, in terms of the products and the whole spirit of being Italian and Roman, and you really see it in the people,” he says. “Compared to my previous experiences, this is the first organisation I’ve been in where everyone lives and breathes Bulgari in a very sincere way. They’re not there because it is the right thing to do, but because they feel passionate about it.”

Quick to laugh and with an easy smile, Hang exudes an excitement over Bulgari’s pieces that is quite infectious. Drawn to Serpenti designs that feature the Tubogas construction and the stories about Elizabeth Taylor commissioning a Serpenti piece for the movie Cleopatra, he expresses his adoration for Bulgari’s expertise with colour. “What Bulgari does with coloured stones is what we’re all about. It is the identity of the brand, but that’s also the spirit; and when you see the coloured gems, especially when they’re in a combination of multiple colours on a single piece, it is powerful. No one else is able to duplicate that and create this harmony in the colours.”

Bulgari’s high jewellery pieces speaks of the jeweller’s rich history in exquisite craftsmanship and vibrant designs. While its legacy is in jewellery, the maison has also made a name for itself in the high watchmaking world. Competing with storied names and having achieved world records, Bulgari is slowly expanding its market. In Singapore, the brand has even been approached by a large watch retailer who wants to stock its pieces. “The clients trust these sorts of establishments; so, to be in that environment is something that’s complimentary for us. It’s not really competition because these clients wouldn’t necessarily walk into our boutiques,” explains Hang.

When it comes to his leadership style, Hang has a succinct analogy. “I hold a very long and loose leash,” he says. “The leash is there, [but] it’s up to the individual to tug a bit harder if they want to let me know they need help. I see my duty as being at the helm to set the direction.”

With his wealth of experience, Hang has learnt quite a few key lessons that guide his management style. “Coming into general management, I’ve found that it’s not about being a generalist and knowing everything, but it’s how you manage your team,” he says. Managing his team also means paying attention to what they are saying, which was especially important during lockdowns. “Over the course of the last year, I’ve had to listen to each of the teams in the markets and there was no way that we could manage or even lead remotely without listening to what was going on out there. And, now, as we’re able to go back out, it’s even more. There’s a tremendous level of trust in the local teams. And we’re seeing this across the board, especially within LVMH. There’s much more emphasis placed on what local teams and clients are telling the company.”

Covid-19 and the current state of the world have transformed all industries, and the luxury sector is no exception. Hang explains it quite simply: “Luxury is evolving. Twenty-five years ago, luxury was for mature, elite profiles; today, it’s much more democratic. It’s about aspiration and creating relationships and, obviously, for a lot of our clients, to feel the best they can about themselves through products and also the relationships we establish with them. The challenge is that people are always changing.”

Not only are individuals constantly in motion but, he says, in South Asia Pacific, every market is also drastically different. Before Covid-19 wreaked havoc, tourists were the main buyers in much of the luxury sector. Once lockdowns were in place, Bulgari — like most retailers — had to turn its attention to the local markets. Hang explains: “All brands have pivoted to focus foremost on locals. Eventually, the tourists will return and, of course, that’s a welcome part of what we’re doing, but it’s not what we are aiming for. It’s going to be the cherry on the cake as opposed to a slice [of the cake], if you will.”

He talks about how the company went all out to host a special event exclusively for Bulgari’s Malaysian clients. “We transformed The Estate on Federal Hill, which is magnificent in terms of its vantage point of Kuala Lumpur. We staged a showcase of the new pieces with models. We had Datuk Syafinaz Selamat singing for the clients, and a spectacular French-inspired meal that was truly interactive. This was all for about 40 of our best clients. The experience culminated in fireworks.” After the festivities, clients were, naturally, eager to touch, feel and buy some of the stunning Bulgari jewellery.

This event is a great example of Bulgari’s focus on listening to local clients in each sector. Hang notes that each client is different and it is difficult to generalise each of their needs; so, finding individual preferences has been paramount. “But therein lies, again, what we call the challenge or the opportunity. And what I found fascinating was [clients’] stories about how they’re connected to Bulgari. For some, it’s a movie they’d seen or music they’d heard, or there is something about the piece that resonates [with them]. If you were simply selling a product you would never know these touch points. There is beauty in the jewellery, especially high jewellery. Yes, these are beautiful pieces to behold, but if they don’t touch an individual in a certain way, people are not going to be shelling out thousands, if not millions, of dollars, right?”

In addition to the personal connection, Bulgari also aims to understand how customers want to connect with the brand. Hang intends to bring together brick-and-mortar stores and e-commerce in a cohesive way, focusing on individual wants and preferences. “The answer is in listening to the client in terms of how they want to transact with us. And we have truly gone into that mode of not calling it omnichannel but channel-less,” he says.

Another key lesson learnt from the pandemic is being adaptable. Referring again to the event for its Malaysian clients, Hang recalls how the skies suddenly opened up, forcing the team to immediately alter its plans — and they did it so seamlessly that the guests were none the wiser. The pandemic has taught everyone that plans, while useful and important, do not always pan out. Therefore, it is paramount to be open to change.

Hang discloses that another exciting event is in the works, one that — if Covid-19 permits — will be an unforgettable experience. “The big thing coming up in Asia is an exhibition that will be staged in the Palace Museum, in the Forbidden City in Beijing, from the end of August. The collaboration is not just for Bulgari but is between the Italian and Chinese governments, which will embody the partnership of two countries. It will be the largest collection of vintage heritage pieces that Bulgari has ever put together. It’s almost 1,000 Bulgari pieces and will be in the context of Chinese culture and Imperial China.”

We conclude our interview with a closer look at Bulgari’s high jewellery range which will be touring the region with Hang. From the dazzling Serpenti watches to the elaborate Colour Treasures necklaces, each piece tells an incredible story using carefully chosen flawless gems as words. Considering how highly sought after they are, having a chance to touch and feel them is a true honour, and one can only hope to be in the presence of such magnificence again in the future.

How Fred's 'joy amid Covid' approach paid off - The Peak Singapore,"Thu, 14 Apr 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXBlYWttYWdhemluZS5jb20uc2cvZmFzaGlvbi13YXRjaGVzL2pld2VsbHJ5LWZyZWQtdW5pcXVlLWJvbGQtZGFyaW5nLWx2bWgtY2FydGllci1jaGF1bWV0L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"There is unconventional wisdom in Charles Leung’s strategies. When minds and headlines were crowded with dread during a terrifyingly unfamiliar pandemic, the CEO of Parisian jewellery maison Fred pushed forth with the launch of the audaciously upbeat Colour Crush bracelet buckle in April 2020.

Never mind that garden-party ensembles had been replaced by drab lockdown garb — each rainbow-hued piece, encrusted with rubies, spessartite garnets, yellow sapphires, tsavorites, aquamarines, blue sapphires and amethysts, loudly sang a tune different from the sentiments of the times.

Two months later in June, amid widespread gloom, Leung splashed out on a summer campaign. Around Paris and on social media, evocative pictures reminded one of the joys of living; images that brought to mind picnics under the sun, a languid day by the pool, or a frolic in the gardens.

“There was fear of going back to lockdown again, and few brands were advertising during that time. Everywhere, marketing budgets were cut and product launches were postponed. Yet, here we were, doing just the opposite,” recalls Leung.

The trend-bucking moves paid off. The year 2020 turned out to be a bumper year for Fred, with sales surpassing that of 2019 for the jewellery house—the first to be acquired by LVMH in 1996. Impressive, considering that the overall luxury market shrank by 20 to 22 per cent in the same time frame, according to a Bain & Company report.

Last year proved even stronger, with a wave of 10 Fred openings in locations such as Beijing, Dubai and Singapore, each serving as a launch pad for the region. This year will see an expansion of the number of boutiques in China and South Korea. Leung’s bets are appearing very well-placed.

His boldness and flamboyance have been apparent since his 2018 appointment as CEO. One of the Hong Konger’s first moves was to blow up Force 10 — a key line for Fred since 1966, comprising a braided sailing cable bracelet and a gold buckle — to XL size.

“Men are already spending on fast cars and oversized, complex watches. So, I said, ‘Let them wear their jewellery! Give them another way to express their individualism!’ It took three years to redesign it in the right proportions, and to construct the exact same interchangeable mechanism in an enlarged format,” details Leung, remembering the efforts it took to realise his vision. When they finally appeared in stores last March, the XL pieces flew off the shelves.

Leong, who has passed through the doors of Cartier and Chaumet, is focused on elevating the brand’s positioning. He is excited to spotlight high jewellery pieces in the boutiques. Additionally, a travelling retrospective exhibition, which debuts in Paris this autumn, will travel to Asia next year. It will further showcase exceptional pieces made for royalty and celebrities.

Meanwhile, he has also democratised Fred jewellery by making it the only LVMH-owned jewellery brand available on Alibaba Group’s Tmall Luxury Pavilion—a move that has contributed significantly to Fred’s sales, with Tmall becoming one of Fred’s top five stores in China within a year.

Twenty-five years in the jewellery industry has certainly shaped Leung’s strategies, unconventional or not. Fred’s history was his biggest guiding force to help the company through difficult times. “At the height of the pandemic, I feared contracting the disease and dying alone, far away from my family,” says the Paris-based CEO, looking back on the dark days of grappling with personal and professional life.

“Then I asked myself: What would Fred Samuel, our founder, have done? World War II broke out soon after the maison was created, and he enthusiastically joined the French resistance. Regardless of the circumstances, he always acted with courage and determination, and with a positive outlook. This made me refocus our brand communications on the little joys in life. We are, after all, a brand built on the riviera spirit, on happiness.”

“Fred is what has been missing in the jewellery world: It isn’t about selling you something that will transform you. It is about being relaxed and happy with who you are, and celebrating that,” adds Leung.
