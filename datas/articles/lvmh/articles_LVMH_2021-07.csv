LVMH Sees No Shift Away From Luxury Goods as Markets Reopen - Yahoo Finance,"Mon, 26 Jul 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9sdm1oLXNlZXMtbm8tc2hpZnQtYXdheS0yMTExMTMzMTUuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS — Consumers still appear willing to spend lavishly on luxury clothes and accessories, even as markets reopen and other activities like restaurants and travel compete for their discretionary dollars, LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton said on Monday.

The world’s biggest luxury group, which owns 75 brands ranging from Dom Pérignon Champagne to Bulgari jewelry, said its fashion and leather goods, or FLG, division was once again the star performer in the second quarter, helping to fuel a better-than-expected rise in overall revenues during the period.

The FLG activities posted sales of 7.13 billion euros in the three months to June 30, up 40 percent on an organic basis versus the same quarter in 2019, reflecting the resilience of star brands Louis Vuitton and Dior.

Vuitton alone is expected to account for more than half of LVMH’s total profits in 2021.

But executives said other brands, including Fendi, Loewe, Celine and Marc Jacobs, also gained market share and improved their profit margins, even as the group’s travel retail and hotel businesses continued to suffer from a dearth of international travel.

Commenting on the risk of so-called “wallet shift,” Jean-Jacques Guiony, chief financial officer of LVMH, said the company has been observing trends in China, where the situation normalized much earlier than in other markets.

“We have not seen demand slowing down and a shift from luxury renminbis into other categories, including experiences. So for what it’s worth, this gives us some hope that when other experiences, such as weekend vacations and so forth, become available, this will not come at the expense of luxury spending,” he said.

The company saw sustained growth in Asia and the U.S. and a gradual recovery in Europe, where local customers have partly compensated for a lack of overseas visitors.

“We’ve seen no signs of a change of pattern in the behavior of Chinese consumers and the business is really moving from strength to strength in all categories, not only fashion and leather,” he said, noting that LVMH was not growing more reliant on its Chinese customers.

Story continues

“Despite the fact that we are doing very, very good business with the Chinese clients, the share of the Chinese clientele is not increasing, particularly at Vuitton and Dior. The growth with the Chinese is very strong, but it’s commensurate with the global growth of the brands,” Guiony said on a conference call with analysts.

Reporting first-half results after the market close, LVMH posted a net profit of 5.29 billion euros in the first half, up 62 percent versus the same period in 2019, and 10 times the level recorded last year at the height of the coronavirus pandemic.

Profit from recurring operations totaled 7.63 billion euros, representing an increase of 44 percent versus the same period in 2019, with fashion and leather goods accounting for 5.66 billion euros, up 74 percent.

Buoyed by the better profitability of its fashion brands, LVMH is ready to reinvest in the second half of 2021 after a year of drastic cost-cutting designed to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 lockdowns.

“Finding out the good marketing strategies and developing true distribution strategies is of the essence, and 2020 and the pandemic, hopefully, was just a pause in that,” Guiony said. “The current level of growth that we are experiencing allows for a significant increase in cost without incurring major impact on margins.”

And while he reiterated that LVMH was not ready to make another major acquisition, after completing its $15.8 billion purchase of Tiffany & Co. in January, it will take an “opportunistic” approach to smaller investments — as evidenced by the flurry of activity over the last few months.

Since April, the group has increased its stake in Tod’s Group to 10 percent; taken full control of Emilio Pucci; acquired a minority stake in Phoebe Philo’s new independent, namesake house, and raised its stake in Virgil Abloh’s luxury streetwear label Off-White to 60 percent.

The deal with Abloh also gives the designer leeway to launch brands and seal partnerships across the full range of the luxury conglomerate’s activities.

Beyond the fashion division, beauty retailer Sephora said last week it was buying British online beauty retailer Feelunique, while the Moët Hennessy wines and spirits division recently teamed up with Campari to launch a joint venture e-commerce business to sell premium wines and spirits across Europe.

Guiony made clear that LVMH’s priority was to secure Abloh’s continued presence at the helm of the men’s business at Vuitton, where since 2018 he has ushered in a new inclusive definition of luxury, and recently unveiled a line of sneakers codesigned with Nike.

“Over the years, he helped us define a very precise and compelling style at Vuitton, and I think the Vuitton men’s business, before him and with him, are very different and much better today,” Guiony said.

“We’ve been able to experience, particularly at Vuitton, the immense talents of Virgil, and if there are collaborations that could generate brand enhancement, or nice products, or anything with him, we would obviously consider it as we speak,” he added.

The group detailed some of the initiatives it has planned across its divisions in the second half. Dior is gearing up for the reopening of its historic headquarters on Avenue Montaigne in Paris in an innovative format that will include a restaurant, while Tiffany will launch a new gold jewelry collection.

Sephora is due to open 200 locations in the U.S. this fall as part of its partnership with Kohl’s Corp., while travel-retail business DFS is preparing openings in 2022 in Brisbane, Australia, and Queenstown, New Zealand. Guerlain is gearing up for a major launch in high-end perfumery, and Fenty Beauty will introduce new powders.

Bernard Arnault, chairman and chief executive officer of LVMH, said l highlights of the first half included the reopening of the La Samaritaine department store in Paris, for which he was joined by French President Emmanuel Macron.

“Within the current context, as we emerge from the health crisis and see a recovery in the global economy, I believe that LVMH is in an excellent position to continue to grow and further strengthen our lead in the global luxury market in 2021,” he said in a statement.

Group sales rose 89 percent year-on-year on a reported basis to 14.7 billion euros in the second quarter, following a 32 percent jump in the first quarter. In organic terms, sales were up 84 percent, beating the Bloomberg consensus forecast for a 72 percent increase.

Compared with 2019, group sales increased 14 percent in like-for-like terms during the quarter. Sales of wines and spirits were up 7 percent, while watches and jewelry posted a 9 percent increase. Perfumes and cosmetics were down 1 percent, and selective retailing fell 19 percent.

Guiony said DFS and luxury travel operator Belmond would struggle to break even. “The season is likely to be too short. We see a concentration of good business only on a few days in a week, and a few weeks in a month, or a few months in a year, basically, so it’s not sufficient, probably, to absorb all the cost base,” he said.

This means that for now, items like Vuitton’s Capucines handbag and Dior’s Dioriviera summer capsule will continue to power the group as it leads the luxury sector back to recovery.

L Catterton, the private equity firm backed by French luxury retailer LVMH , agreed to buy a majority stake in Italian fashion house Etro SPA.

Financial terms weren’t disclosed. Italian newspaper Il Sole 24 Ore had reported L Catterton will buy a 60 per cent stake, which would value Etro at about €500 million (US$590 million).

L Catterton in February bought sandal maker Birkenstock . LVMH also boosted its stake in Italian shoemaker Tod’s SPA to 10 per cent in April. Etro plans to grow its customer base by attracting younger consumers, and look to expand in Asia, it said.

Rothschild & Co. advised Etro on the deal, while Bain & Company and PWC advised L Catterton. The transaction is expected to close by the end of the year.

Earlier this month, the conglomerate also announced backing for British fashion designer Phoebe Philo in launching her own eponymous fashion label. Known for her minimalist fashion and tenure at LVMH-owned brand Celine – which is now under the helm of Hedi Slimane, the brand born from the LVMH partnership will focus on “clothing and accessories rooted in exceptional quality and design”.

"Phoebe Philo to Launch Eponymous Label, With LVMH Backing - The Fashion Law","Mon, 12 Jul 2021 11:51:16 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWZhc2hpb25sYXcuY29tL2Zvcm1lci1jZWxpbmUtY3JlYXRpdmUtcGhvZWJlLXBoaWxvLXRvLWxhdW5jaC1oZXItb3duLWxhYmVsLXdpdGgtbHZtaC1pbnZlc3RtZW50L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Three and a half years after leaving LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton-owned Celine, where Hedi Slimane now holds the top spot, Phoebe Philo is launching a new label under her own name. The news, which was confirmed by the soon-to-launch brand in a release on Monday, follows from months of mounting rumors that Ms. Philo was reportedly building a team in London for a new venture after remaining largely out of the industry since her departure from Celine in December 2017. “Being in my studio and making once again has been both exciting and incredibly fulfilling,” Philo, 48, said in the announcement. “I am very much looking forward to being back in touch with my audience and people everywhere.”

Details about the new label are relatively scarce but what has been made clear: Philo has backing from LVMH, which has taken a minority stake in the company for an undisclosed sum. “I have had a very constructive and creative working relationship with LVMH for many years,” the cult-followed designer said. “So, it is a natural progression for us to reconnect on this new project. I have greatly appreciated discussing new ideas with Bernard Arnault and Delphine Arnault, and I am delighted to be embarking on this adventure with their support.” Despite having LVMH’s money and muscle in fray, the brand will be “independent” from the luxury goods titan, with Philo saying that being “independent [and] to govern and experiment on my own terms is hugely significant to me.”

Mr. Arnault called Philo “one of the most talented designers of our time” in a statement on Monday, and said, “We have known her and appreciated her for a long time. Phoebe contributed to the success of the group through her magnificent creations over several years. With this in mind, I am very happy to partner with Phoebe on her entrepreneurial adventure and wish her great success.”

Phoebe Philo, who captivated women by way of her work at Richemont-owned Chloé and during her 10-year tenure at Celine, where she was known for her modern luxury apparel and “it” bags, as well as her opposition to social media and e-commerce, revealed that more information about the brand will come early next year. Until then, Philophiles – the name given the die-hard fans of the esteemed designer – will have to wait and presumably, save given the brand’s plans to root its cloth

After all, in addition to being known for the thoroughly coveted nature of her Celine offerings, Philo’s wares were notorious for their eye-watering price tags."
LVMH's Fashion Division Is Roaring Out of the Pandemic - The Business of Fashion,"Mon, 26 Jul 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzb2ZmYXNoaW9uLmNvbS9uZXdzL2x1eHVyeS9sdm1ocy1mYXNoaW9uLWRpdmlzaW9uLWlzLXJvYXJpbmctb3V0LW9mLXRoZS1wYW5kZW1pYy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Surging sales of fashion lines and handbags by Dior, Fendi and Louis Vuitton powered LVMH’s revenues in the second quarter as coronavirus restrictions eased around the world and the luxury goods group edged out some rivals to grow its market share.

The luxury goods industry is recovering from the health crisis, which shut down global travel and temporarily closed stores. The end of COVID-19 lockdowns across much of Europe is reviving demand in the region after a strong Chinese rebound.

LVMH, the world’s biggest luxury goods group, has benefited more than most, using its heft to spend on marketing and social media campaigns when some of its smaller rivals are still struggling to get back on their feet.

The conglomerate said on Monday that its biggest revenue driver, Vuitton, as well as fashion brands Dior, Fendi, Loewe and Celine had posted record sales and profitability in the first half of 2021 and increased their market share.

Dior, for example, ramped the number of “pop-up” temporary shops in resorts, which travellers are returning to, the company said.

Overall sales at the LVMH, which also owns champagne and cosmetics labels, rose by 84 percent year-on-year in the second quarter on a like-for-like basis, which strips out currency swings, and stood at 14.7 billion euros ($17.36 billion).

That beat an analyst consensus forecast for 69 percent growth cited by UBS but in line with HSBC estimates. It was also 14 percent above pre-pandemic, 2019 levels.

Operating profit in the first six months of this year more than quadrupled compared with a year ago, beating expectations among analysts polled by Refinitiv.

Shares in LVMH have surged by more than 70 percent since June last year, making the group the biggest European company by market value and allowing boss Bernard Arnault to briefly overtake Amazon founder Jeff Bezos as the richest man in the world.

Fresh from its $15.8 billion acquisition of US jeweller Tiffany, completed in January, LVMH has also made the most of its crisis comeback to invest in labels.

Last week, LVMH said it would buy a 60 percent stake in Off-White, a streetwear label founded by Vuitton menswear designer Virgil Abloh, while expanding Abloh’s role within the group to launch new brands.

LVMH also took a minority stake in a new clothing and accessories label being launched by the former Celine star designer Phoebe Philo, and raised its holding in Italian shoemaker Tod’s to 10 percent.

Revenues had dropped 16 percent last year, when the pandemic triggered global lockdowns and international travel ground to a halt.

LVMH’s retailing division, which includes beauty chain Sephora and also duty free group DFS, has suffered more than its other businesses, although it clawed back some ground in the second quarter.

LVMH Expands Virgil Abloh's Role Beyond Fashion - WWD,"Tue, 20 Jul 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd3dkLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy1uZXdzL21lcmdlcnMtYWNxdWlzaXRpb25zL2x2bWgtd2lkZW5zLXZpcmdpbC1hYmxvaC1yb2xlLWJleW9uZC1mYXNoaW9uLW9mZi13aGl0ZS0xMjM0ODg0Nzg5L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS — In a major show of confidence, LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton is bolstering its relationship with Virgil Abloh with a deal that will give the designer leeway to launch brands and seal partnerships across the full range of the luxury conglomerate’s activities, beyond just the fashion division.

As part of the agreement, LVMH will raise its stake in Off-White LLC, the trademark owner of Abloh’s Off-White brand, to 60 percent. Abloh will retain a 40 percent interest and continue as creative director of the label, which he founded in 2014. Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed.

Italian holding company New Guards Group will stay on as the licensee for Off-White. Meanwhile, Abloh will remain artistic director of men’s wear collections at Louis Vuitton, a post he has held since March 2018, both parties said in a joint statement on Tuesday.

Bernard Arnault, chairman and chief executive officer of LVMH, said the group was “thrilled” to expand its partnership with the 40-year-old American designer, who is known for his wide-ranging collaborations with brands including Nike, Mercedes-Benz, Evian, Ikea, Vitra and Braun, among others.

“We look forward to supporting Virgil and the team both in driving the growth of Off-White and in working together with Virgil to bring his unique sensibility to a broader range of luxury categories,” Arnault said in the statement.

Having emerged as one of the winners of the coronavirus pandemic in the luxury segment, LVMH is keen to capitalize on the momentum to anticipate changes in consumer tastes and behaviors. Shares in the group, which is due to release second-quarter results on July 26, are up 28 percent so far this year.

In a joint interview with WWD, Abloh and Michael Burke, chairman and CEO of Louis Vuitton, said Tuesday’s deal marked a new type of relationship between a creative director and a conglomerate like LVMH, which owns 75 brands ranging from Vuitton and Dior to beauty retailer Sephora, jeweler Tiffany & Co. and Hennessy cognac.

“I’m completely honored. There’s a long trajectory of creative directors partnering with a house, but this is something completely new, and I commend Mr. Arnault and Michael Burke for seeing my talent across spectrums and incubating me to a place where I can suggest different things that don’t fall in the realm of a runway show,” Abloh said.

“There’s areas within the spirits side of the business that are attractive to me; there’s areas within the hospitality, the hotels side; jewelry — you know, more minutiae within the fashion segment. My eyes have always been wide in terms of fashion, arts and culture and how they can merge together. So the announcement is leaning on that, that now there’s an opportunity to grow new segments and root myself within LVMH, the group,” he added.

Burke said the new venture would launch once LVMH’s investment in Off-White clears regulatory hurdles, a process it expects to be completed within 60 days. But he was coy about lifting the lid on any additional details.

“It’s not like LVMH is playing a standard role, or Virgil is playing a standard scripted role. We’re both going into this knowing that we’re going to be inventing new business models as we go. It’s going to depend on the industry, the product, what exists, what remains to be invented, so we’re not going into it with a cookie-cutter recipe,” he said.

“We have many old-line businesses at LVMH, and they’re very successful. But one day, most of them will reawaken to something quite different, and we don’t know what that is. But we sure know that by putting extreme creative talent with extreme provenance, sparks will happen,” the executive added.

Burke noted his relationship with Abloh stretches back to his days as CEO of Fendi, when the designer joined Kanye West on an internship at the Roman house.

“We instantly hit it off,” Burke said. “From Day One, it was clear that we were going to work together, and that it was going to progressively become a deeper and deeper relationship. Things absolutely fell into place here at Louis Vuitton with men’s wear. The results are in, and they’re very, very good, and so it’s a good time to expand upon it.”

The strategy comes as LVMH deepens its foothold in experiential luxury — with the recent opening of a Cipriani restaurant in Saint-Tropez, and a Cheval Blanc hotel set to bow in Paris in September — and luxury brands like Vuitton expand their partnerships into the worlds of sports, music and gaming.

“We’re at a moment where the opportunities are just immense, because the various areas where LVMH and Virgil are involved in are becoming limitless,” Burke said. “We’ve taken all these major sociological moments in our lives, and we’re weaving them together. That has not happened before. So I wouldn’t try to describe it, because we’re going to invent it as we go.”

Abloh said the deal also allows him to envision a long-term future for Off-White, having grown the brand “from one screen printed T-shirt, to now having stores all over the world. I want to see that become a generational brand. So without hesitation, and with due diligence on my part, Michael and I crafted the scenario for those entities to come under an umbrella that we can see for years to come.”

While Burke confirmed that LVMH previously held a minority stake in Off-White’s trademark entity, he declined to say when the investment was made and how big the stake was. WWD reported in 2019 that LVMH was also mulling an investment in New Guards Group, though this was never confirmed. The Milan-based holding company was sold to Farfetch in 2019 for $675 million.

Burke signaled his confidence in Off-White’s operating partner.

“Virgil brought New Guards to us. We’re absolutely happy and, at times, positively surprised at how they have taken Virgil’s then-brand and then turned it into a very, very successful business. There are very, very few that have achieved what they have achieved. So we wouldn’t be doing this deal if we thought the first thing we needed to do was changing a key partner,” he said.

“Andrea Grilli and Davide De Giglio, my partners in starting Off-White, they fostered this exact vision for it to advance to this stage, so they’re an integral part of the team that is Off-White,” Abloh concurred.

Off-White operates 56 stand-alone stores worldwide, and more are on the way. In Paris, the brand recently opened a flagship at the intersection of Rue de Castiglione and Rue du Mont Thabor that includes a café operated with boutique Japanese coffee company % Arabica.

Burke declined to specify the duration of Abloh’s contract at Vuitton, though by the sounds of it, the designer won’t have to hunt for another job soon.

“He’s shown that he has the pulse of the fashion world, but he’s also very design-driven. In other words, he has a very long-term view of beauty and designing beauty. So the time’s right now to do things on a different level within LVMH,” the executive said.

Abloh, who last year raised $1 million for a scholarship fund for Black fashion students, said he was committed to keeping the door open for diverse talent. “Today just marks a day where I’m given a seat at the table for us to do more, and not be limited by the past,” he concluded.

Luxury conglomerate LVMH has acquired a 60 percent stake in Off-White, the streetwear label founded by American designer Virgil Abloh. The move should bolster Mr. Abloh’s standing inside the luxury group and further enhance his global visibility.

According to a press release , Mr. Abloh will remain in his role as artistic director of Louis Vuitton's menswear collection while also working with the luxury conglomerate to launch new brands and partner with existing ones outside the fashion sector.

“For nearly a decade, we’ve been building Off-White to be a brand designed to empower our generation and challenge the status quo,” said Virgil Abloh. “LVMH brings to the table the additional firepower and scale to accelerate our momentum and evolve Off-White into a truly multi-line luxury brand.”

The Jing Take

The acquisition is a brilliant move by LVMH and proves that it knows how to stay ahead of the competition.

Many luxury customers today are teenagers and young adults who favor digitization and the radical democratization of luxury. Therefore, investing in a streetwear brand with global resonance is a strategic move. Moreover, the acquisition could expand the Group’s influence in the Asia Pacific — a market that, in recent years, has surpassed all expectations by generating strong sales for the French conglomerate.

In China, Gen Zers have pushed gender-neutral streetwear labels like Off-White and Supreme into the spotlight. Against this backdrop, LVMH has decided to improve its cultural credibility with the burgeoning streetwear-loving crowd by taking a bigger space in the inclusive world of streetwear fashion.

At the same time, Off-White could gain access to LVMH’s resources and profit from its global positioning and reputation. We expect Off-White’s association with the French conglomerate to boost its market recognition, increase its market share, and generate higher sales and profits.

Since Philo’s 2017 exit from Celine, where she delivered a highly successful reboot for owners LVMH, industry insiders have speculated about her next move, citing possible creative directorships at Chanel or Alaïa. But the designer has maintained a low profile, quietly building the Phoebe Philo Studio from her London base. The company was incorporated on July 9th, 2021, according to a filing with Companies House. Philo and her husband Max Wigram were named as the sole directors.

“Being in my studio and making once again has been both exciting and incredibly fulfilling,” said Philo in a short statement shared with The Business of Fashion. “I am very much looking forward to being back in touch with my audience and people everywhere. To be independent, to govern and experiment on my own terms is hugely significant to me.”

“I have had a very constructive and creative working relationship with LVMH for many years. So, it is a natural progression for us to reconnect on this new project,” Philo added. LVMH chairman and chief executive Bernard Arnault described Philo as “one of the most talented designers of our time,” adding: “I am very happy to partner with Phoebe on her entrepreneurial adventure and wish her great success.”

A Celine Success

Philo’s understated, minimalist reinvention of Celine, the chic Parisian label first established in 1945 by Céline Vipiana as a made-to-measure children’s shoe brand, was perfectly timed. Following its 2008 relaunch, Philo emerged as the leader of a quiet luxury fashion movement that gained traction in the wake of the Great Recession, turning Celine into one of the most influential labels in the luxury industry.

She started by wiping the then-dormant brand’s slate clean, slowly introducing a wardrobe of foundational classics including bag lines like the Luggage and Classic. Philo’s collections were an instant hit with fashion editors, who were regularly documented wearing Celine by early street style bloggers like Scott Schuman and Tommy Ton just as digital media was beginning to transform fashion communications in earnest.

But Philos’ devotees, known as the ‘Philophiles,’ extended well beyond editors and other industry insiders to a wide-ranging group of women (and men, notably Kanye West) who adopted her chic sportswear as a de facto uniform. For some, Celine’s refined charm and avoidance of overtly sexy looks also made it a symbol of women’s empowerment. Soon, Philo’s influence could be seen everywhere, from fast fashion to the boom in popularity of Adidas’ Stan Smith sneakers, part of her own pared-back uniform.

The designer declined to say when the Phoebe Philo label will debut, only that more details would be made available in January 2022. (Phoebe Philo)

The Celine business grew significantly during Philo’s tenure. LVMH does not break out the results for individual brands, but according to market analysts, the designer’s collections lifted annual sales from €200 million to more than €700 million by 2017, when she stepped back from her role and out of the industry spotlight.

A wave of designers has targeted the aesthetic gap she left behind, including Bottega Veneta’s Daniel Lee and the designers Peter Do and Rokh Hwang, all of whom previously worked under Philo at Celine.

Fellow star designer Hedi Slimane took over at the LVMH label in 2018 and executed his own creative overhaul that the group still hopes will generate €3 billion in annual revenue. Under Slimane, most elements of Philo’s creative vision were erased (except for the successful Luggage and Classic lines which are still produced in a wide array of options), driving up the prices of Philo-era pieces on luxury resale sites.

Launch Date Unknown

Philo declined to say when her new label will debut, only that more details would be made available in January 2022, meaning the Phoebe Philo brand is likely to launch amid another pivotal post-crisis moment that could change the currents of fashion.

Her proven ability to set the creative agenda could accelerate a shift away from the maximalism and luxury streetwear focus that has dominated the fashion market in recent years, propelled by the likes of Alessandro Michele’s Gucci and Demna Gvasalia’s Balenciaga, both owned by LVMH rival Kering.

But Philo has her work cut out for her. Luxury fashion is a vastly more digital industry than it was when the famously anti-technology designer left Celine. Bold, logo-heavy looks resonate more powerfully than minimalism on social media. And customer expectations for a fashion brand’s digital presence are higher than ever.

Building a new brand from scratch is also a risky and expensive proposition. Challenges range from the massive marketing expenditure required to generate awareness with consumers to the scarcity of prime real estate for retail stores.

While it remains to be seen exactly what she will do (some have speculated the line will have an eco-friendly angle), there’s no doubt Phoebe Philo’s new brand will be one of the most highly-anticipated fashion launches of the post-pandemic era. It also brings Philo back into the LVMH fold (and out of the hands of rivals), alongside fellow British designer Stella McCartney, in whose label the group also has a minority stake.

The investment brings another name with deep sportswear ties to LVMH’s unrivaled roster of brands.

Off-White, created by Louis Vuitton men’s artistic director Virgil Abloh, has a line of extremely popular sneakers with Nike. The two brands also teamed up to produce athletic apparel, including a collaboration with Manchester United forward Marcus Rashford.

Abloh designed the uniform Serena Williams wore while playing in the 2018 U.S. Open, as well.

Many other LVMH brands have high-profile sports tie-ins. Dior released its own Air Jordan sneaker, Hennessy partners with the NBA, and TAG Heuer sponsors Porsche’s racing team and athletes including Naomi Osaka.

Off-White is just the latest major acquisition for LVMH.

In January, LVMH purchased Tiffany for $15.8 billion.

In February, it bought 50% of Jay-Z’s Armand de Brignac champagne.

It assumed full ownership of designer line Emilio Pucci in June.

LVMH’s investment vehicle, L Catterton, bought 60% of Italian brand Etro earlier this week and Birkenstock for $4.8 billion earlier this year. The private equity group is exploring options to go public.

LVMH recently surpassed Nestlé in March to become the largest company in Europe — it has a market cap of $382 billion. Its founder, Bernard Arnault, is worth $182.1 billion."
LVMH Celebrates Its First Half 2021 Earnings. But Can Growth Continue? - Jing Daily,"Mon, 26 Jul 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vamluZ2RhaWx5LmNvbS9wb3N0cy9sdm1oLWZpcnN0LWhhbGYtMjAyMS1lYXJuaW5ncy1sb3Vpcy12dWl0dG9u0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"While Louis Vuitton has been embroiled in its ex-ambassador Kris Wu’s scandal (for alleged predatory behavior towards underage girls) its parent company LVMH has delivered outstanding results for its first half 2021, beating analysts' expectations.

On July 27, the French Group released its first half 2021 earnings report, with a remarkable 53 percent revenue increase compared to 2020, jumping to 33.9 billion. This was due to the strong performance of its fashion and leather goods division, as well as its hard luxury sector. Indeed, Louis Vuitton and Dior have both continued to perform strongly, followed by Fendi and Celine, which also delivered brilliant results. And now, with the addition of Tiffany & Co., its watches and jewelry category also soared, up 122 percent.

Asia, especially China, continues to drive LVMH’s major growth, accounting for nearly 40 percent of the group’s revenue; the market reported a jump of 30 percent compared to 2020 and 70 percent in 2021.

Moreover, the conglomerate’s efforts in leveraging K-pop stars is now paying off on the mainland, suggesting that the Korean wave is on the mend. Three out of the four popular Blackpink band members are endorsing the company’s brands (Lisa for Céline, Rosé for Tiffany, and Jisoo for Dior), while Louis Vuitton recently announced boy super group BTS as its in-house ambassadors.

The question remains, when international travel resumes, will sales in China decline? According to Bernard Arnault, Chairman and CEO of LVMH, the answer is no. “Within the current context, as we emerge from the health crisis and see a recovery in the global economy, I believe that LVMH is in an excellent position to continue to grow and further strengthen our lead in the global luxury market in 2021,” Arnault said on the earnings call.

However, this time LVMH’s cash cow Louis Vuitton may be in a bit of trouble; its late response to the Kris Wu scandal has raised the ire of many Chinese netizens, who are accusing the brand of standing by sexual predators. But even if by some chance Louis Vuitton under performs in the second half 2021, LVMH’s bullpen is still loaded with giants like Dior, Celine, and Tiffany. Given this, the group’s diverse, resilient portfolio should help it mitigate any possible future declines in any one category or brand — in China or the world beyond."

Following the transaction, the luxury streetwear brand’s founder Virgil Abloh will retain a 40 percent interest in the company and continue in his roles as creative director of the brand, as well as menswear artistic director of Louis Vuitton.

Farfetch-owned New Guards Group, the Milan-based fashion group which founded the brand with Abloh in 2014, will continue to operate the label including production, marketing, and distribution through a licensing agreement that’s set to last until at least 2026.

Under New Guards Group’s management, Off-White has become a global brand with 56 boutiques selling hoodies, keychains, blankets and umbrella stands featuring Abloh’s signature self-referential graphics and crossed-arrow logo.

LVMH and Abloh also announced they planned to expand their partnership, with plans to work together to launch new brands and energise existing ones, including through collaborations that would extend beyond the group’s fashion holdings. The conglomerate’s portfolio includes more than 70 brands ranging from wine and spirits to hotels, perfume, cosmetics and jewellery.

After training as an architect, Abloh broke into the fashion industry as the longtime creative collaborator for Kanye West. His approach blurs the lines between designer and savvy community builder, rallying fans to hype his own brand, as well as limited-edition products ranging from Nike sneakers to Ikea rugs and Evian water bottles.

The strategy has proven timely as social media’s influence in the fashion space climbed, and belonging to a consumer tribe became a key driver for young fashion shoppers.

Financial terms of the transaction were not disclosed.

The 10-point document lays out measures to ensure the protection and growth of the group’s so-called Métiers d’Excellence, with an emphasis on passing on know-how from one generation to the next. It also pledges to push for diversity, and support solidarity initiatives through partnerships with nonprofits, institutions and schools.

To mark the signing of the Worldwide Engagements for Métiers d’Excellence, or “WE for ME,” manifesto at the Louis Vuitton Foundation in June, LVMH staged photo shoots in several locations that paired brand CEOs with members of their teams, known as virtuosos, to shine a light on their talents.

It plans to honor its skilled workforce with celebrations in Paris on Oct. 19 and Florence on Nov. 8.

It’s part of ongoing efforts by the world’s biggest luxury group to promote these jobs among the public to ensure that they are preserved. Founded in 2014, LVMH’s Institut des Métiers d’Excellence has trained around 1,000 people in France, Switzerland, Italy, Spain and Japan.

“The luxury industry could not continue to thrive without savoir-faire rooted in excellence,” Arnault said in a statement.

Chantal Gaemperle, executive vice president, human resources and synergies, added: “LVMH counts over 200 Métiers d’Excellence around the world represented by a community of people with a passion and commitment to passing them on to new generations. We have a responsibility to support them and help develop this community.”

Among the initiatives planned in the coming months is an acceleration of the “Excellent!” program in France and elsewhere to change the way these jobs are perceived by young people and inspire vocations. LVMH will also launch a new program to develop the competencies of its employees and accelerate innovation.

In parallel, Antoine Arnault, head of communication and image of LVMH, launched the Journées Particulières open-doors event in 2011 to give members of the public a glimpse behind the scenes and stimulate interest in craftsmanship. The last edition, held in 2018, drew a record 180,000 visitors.

With huge popularity and name recognition in China, as well as success on platforms like TikTok and Douyin, K-pop stars carry strong influence among younger millennial and Gen Z consumers.

Going forward more brands may turn to C-pop stars as brand ambassadors for China to complement K-pop partnerships, but risks remain.

Over the past decade, the massive success of K-pop has enticed a growing number of luxury brands to enlist its stars as spokespersons and brand ambassadors. From Jennie of Blackpink (Chanel ) to Seulgi of Red Velvet (ambassador for Salvatore Ferragamo) and quartet Aespa (Givenchy ), K-pop performers offer brands a highly polished, generally (but not always) uncontroversial, and globally popular route to gain attention from younger millennial and Gen Z shoppers worldwide.

This has been a particularly successful strategy for brands in China, where K-pop and K-dramas remain hugely popular and influential despite the occasional boycott or backlash . And now, the role of K-pop stars has expanded beyond serving as representatives for individual brands to becoming a new marketing cornerstone for luxury groups.

Luxury powerhouse LVMH has arguably been the most effective at leveraging the K-pop wave across its portfolio, announcing a slate of brand ambassadorships in 2021. Louis Vuitton, one of the group’s most important brands, announced a wide-ranging partnership with BTS and Christian Dior enlisted Blackpink member Jisoo as its global brand ambassador. Its recently acquired Tiffany & Co. (which is in the midst of a major Asia-facing branding effort) joined forces with another Blackpink member, Rosé, in a bold move to get in front of younger consumers.

LVMH-owned Loewe’s most recent ambassadorship offers another glimpse at how the conglomerate may see its K-pop strategy roll out across other brands. This month, the Spanish luxury house announced singer-songwriter HyunA (Kim Hyun-ah) as its newest global brand ambassador, joining other young celebrities who are a little off the beaten path compared to the household-name superstars enlisted by Louis Vuitton or Dior. (Another example would be The Crown star Josh O’Connor, ambassador for the Eye Loewe Nature outdoor line and fellow LVMH brand Bulgari .)

Known for a somewhat edgier aesthetic than the likes of BTS or Blackpink, HyunA has achieved much of her success through viral TikTok dance challenges . Her seventh EP, “I’m Not Cool ,” released earlier this year, topped charts of streaming platforms in South Korea while the hashtag #imnotcool racked up more than 850 million views on TikTok.

But HyunA’s new gig as Loewe brand ambassador may have the greatest impact in China, a market that is relatively new to the brand yet increasingly important. HyunA’s latest EP reportedly sold more than 200,000 copies on QQ Music, while her videos garnered 1.4 billion views on Douyin. As Loewe makes a strong global effort to promote its new Goya bag, the choice of HyunA could help the brand maintain some of the momentum it built up in China this earlier year via its nostalgia-fueled Totoro collection. And depending on HyunA's ability to drum up interest in Loewe and the new Goya in China, she could be the first of more relatively niche Korean stars to be recruited as global ambassadors.

Who will LVMH tap as the next brand ambassadors for its dozens of other brands? Aside from niche K-pop performers, C-pop stars and idols very well may see greater interest, with actor and singer Jackson Yee already announced as a Tiffany brand ambassador in 2020 and Liu Yifei as the China representative for Louis Vuitton earlier this year.

While less well-known outside of China, Chinese celebrities offer the advantage of instant name recognition among millions of potential consumers and plenty of opportunities for collaboration across the content spectrum. However, they’re not without risks for LVMH or any other group. Just this week, a major scandal is unfolding as top C-pop star Kris Wu — brand ambassador for Louis Vuitton and Bulgari, and many others like Porsche and L’Oréal — was accused of infidelity and predatory behavior on Chinese social media, leading to a flurry of PR crisis management among the brands that work with him."
"LVMH is Firing on All Cylinders, According to Q2 + First Half Numbers - Sourcing Journal","Tue, 27 Jul 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vc291cmNpbmdqb3VybmFsLmNvbS90b3BpY3MvcmV0YWlsL2x2bWgtMjAyMS1sb3Vpcy12dWl0dG9uLW9mZndoaXRlLXZpcmdpbC1hYmxvaC1mYXNoaW9uLWx1eHVyeS1jaGluYS0yOTI1NTYv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Strong global luxury sales at Louis Vuitton and Christian Dior powered first half results for LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton.

In a Nutshell: Fashion and leather goods were behind the French conglomerate’s strong second quarter and first half results.

According to LVMH, the fashion and leather goods division recorded 81 percent organic revenue growth in the first half of 2021 compared to the same period in 2020. Profit from recurring operations rose 74 percent when compared to the first half of 2019, which was also up three times over 2020 levels. The result follow first quarter trends, when the division also drove quarterly sales gains. In a conference call, LVMH chief financial officer (CFO) Jean-Jacques Guiony noted that the company made “some significant improvements” in its fashion and leather margins, citing Dior, Fendi, Marc Jacobs, Veuve and Celine as notable performers.

“The first half of this year marks a return to strong growth momentum after a severely disrupted year in 2020 resulting from the global pandemic,” LVMH said on Monday. “The United States and Asia are up sharply since the start of the year while Europe is experiencing a gradual recovery.”

Louis Vuitton delivered a “remarkable performance” and maintained its “profitability at an exceptional level,” LVMH said, noting the growing wait list for many of the brand’s coveted products. Christian Dior put in a strong showing with local customers, it added.

LVMH’s watches and jewelry group saw a strong rebound in stores, while the company continued integrating Tiffany after last year’s acquisition. In addition, the wines and spirits group recorded organic revenue growth of 44 percent for the half, with champagne (up 10 percent) and Hennessy cognac (up 6 percent) leading the way.

While luxury sales in the U.S. and Asia have been on the rise, the company noted that its duty-free DFS shops are struggling with the lack of international tourism.

And while much of the growth in luxury turnover came from Americans, Guiony said Europeans were spending too. “And particularly as Vuitton, we see very, very good advances with European clients, in excess of 50 percent,” he said. Although the European customer base is much smaller, Guiony said spending has allowed LVMH to keep stores open, even if doing so hasn’t quite offset the effects of a tourism slump. As for the Chinese consumer, growth is constant versus last year and to 2019 levels, Guiony added.

“Our aim for DFS is to break even, but frankly, it will not be easy,” the financial chief said, noting improvements in Macao as tourists and gamblers have returned. Although “the numbers are pretty good,” he continued, “it’s probably not sufficient to offset the fact that other geographies and particularly, Hong Kong, are seeing no light at the end of the tunnel.”

Based on spending trends in China, LVMH hasn’t seen luxury goods demand decline as consumers shift to other categories, including experiences, Guiony said, offering a glimmer of hope that this pattern will continue as other markets rebound.

Net Sales: For the second quarter, revenue more than doubled to 7.13 billion euros ($8.41 billion) from 3.35 billion euros ($3.95 billion), a 40 percent increase over the same 2019 period.

First half results from January through June saw a 74 percent increase in revenue in the fashion and leather goods division to 13.86 billion euros ($16.37 billion) from 7.99 billion euros ($9.43 billion) a year ago, a 38 percent rise from 2019 revenue.

“This business group is clearly delivering a very strong performance by both Louis Vuitton and Christian Dior with very good performances elsewhere, too,” Chris Hollis, director of financial communications, said of the fashion and luxury division during the conference call. “Performance at Louis Vuitton specifically is, as always, driven by the unique combination of exceptional creativity and a commitment to unparalleled craftsmanship that is endured into brand’s founding.”

Louis Vuitton opened new stores in Paris and Tokyo, which “will be a further draw for visitors to these important cities,” Hollis added.

Christian Dior Couture had outstanding growth across product categories, with its new Caro bag incorporating the iconic Dior caning pattern, Hollis said. The launch of the new summer capsule collection, Dior Riviera, has also performed well. The brand’s New York store on 57th St. will undergo a major renovation, and a temporary store has opened on Fifth Ave.

The Fendi store on 57 St. has reopened with nearly 7,000 square feet in time for the debut of Kim Jones’ new collection. Hollis said the performance of Fendi continues to be strong, driven by its iconic products and newness, touting the success of Jones’ inaugural and the summer Vertigo capsule collection.

Other brands in the group also did well. At Celine, the ready-to-wear collection designed by Hedi Slimane continues to perform well and the Triomphe line remains highly sought after, Hollister said. And at Loewe, with Jonathan Anderson, Hollis said the brand “continues to bring newness and excitement to the Maison with new digital concepts for its shows, such as Show-on-the-Wall and the recent success of its new Goya bag.” At Givenchy, Matthew Williams’ first collection has arrived in stores, and is off to a good start, Hollis said. Also showing signs of strength was the Marc Jacobs brand.

Hollis touched on LVMH’s new majority ownership of Virgil Abloh-founded Off-White, noting that the company looks forward to further elevating the premium streetwear label while the designer straddles his roles with both Louis Vuitton and his original endeavor.

Looking ahead, LVMH plans to keep its brands top of mind with luxury shoppers. “Our strategy of focusing on the highest quality across all our activities, combined with the dynamism and unparalleled creativity of our teams, will enable us to reinforce LVMH’s global leadership position in luxury goods once again in 2021,” it said.

CEO’s Take: “LVMH has enjoyed an excellent half-year and is reaping the benefits of having continued to innovate and invest in its businesses throughout the pandemic despite being in the midst of a global crisis. The creativity, the high-quality and enduring nature of our products and the sense of responsibility that drives us, have been critical in enabling us to successfully withstand the effects of the pandemic; they will remain firmly embedded in all our Maisons, thereby ensuring their continued desirability,” Bernard Arnault, chairman and CEO, said. “I believe that LVMH is in an excellent position to continue to grow and further strengthen our lead in the global luxury market in 2021.”"
LVMH to Open Research Center for Sustainable Luxury - WWD,"Thu, 01 Jul 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3dkLmNvbS9zdXN0YWluYWJpbGl0eS9idXNpbmVzcy9sdm1oLXN1c3RhaW5hYmlsaXR5LWx1eHVyeS1yZXNlYXJjaC0xMjM0ODY5NDgzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Eager to spread solutions for more sustainable and digital luxury throughout its various business divisions, LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton plans to build a new research and innovation center in France.

Housing about 300 employees — including scientists, researchers and start-ups in co-working spaces — the new facility is slated to open toward the end of 2024 or mid-2025 in Saclay, a government-designated hub on the fringes of Paris for schools, labs and research facilities.

“It will be a big facility, but we are not sure of the exact size,” said Jean Baptiste Voisin, chief strategy officer at LVMH, who noted that the group’s chairman and chief executive officer Bernard Arnault is fast-tracking the project, and that a roadmap is already in place for the recruitment of teams and the scope of the center’s work.

The initial focus will be on new materials, bio-technologies and digital and data solutions that lead to greater sustainability.

“We want the research and development center to be extremely product- and solutions-driven,” Voisin said, explaining that a big focus would be on making actual prototypes. “Getting rid of plastics is at the core.”

He stressed that researchers are essential for fully evaluating the environmental impact of new materials and methodologies considering such factors as energy consumption, carbon-dioxide emissions, plastic content and the extent of recycled or waste materials employed.

For example, a host of start-ups recently brought LVMH new materials that could be used as a substitute for leather. After evaluating 15 of the proposals, LVMH officials found that “90 percent were plastic plus something else,” highlighting the need for expert analysis, Voisin said. “It is very easy to find a solution to improve one dimension. It’s very hard to prove you are really improving the full ecosystem.”

Once the center opens, LVMH will have nearly 1,000 employees dedicated to research and development. This includes about 400 workers at an R&D center for perfumes and cosmetics in Saint-Jean-de-Braye, near Orléans, France.

The rest are spread across the group’s various brands and business divisions, which range from Louis Vuitton, Fendi and Dior in fashion and leather goods; Krug and Ruinart in wines and spirits; Guerlain and Fenty Beauty by Rihanna in perfumes and cosmetics; Sephora, DFS and Samaritaine in selective retailing, and Bulgari and Tag Heuer in watches and jewelry.

The forthcoming site in Saclay will benefit from its proximity to an “very dynamic research ecosystem bringing together the world’s best expertise while maintaining a close connection with education and research,” according to LVMH.

It is understood there are about 70,000 professionals concentrated in Saclay, including many of France’s top schools for engineering, science and agriculture.

Voisin declined to say the size of the investment to build the center, however, sources suggest it could range from 30 million to 75 million euros, depending on the ultimate size.

LVMH noted that the forthcoming research and innovation hub in line with environmental initiatives structured a program baptized “Life 360,” with objectives set for three-, six- and 10-year time frames.

Creating new personalized customer experiences

In particular, the group aims to enhance demand forecasting and inventory optimization, as well as elevate customer experiences through personalization - while meeting very strict privacy and security requirements to protect the privacy of its customers’ data.

LVMH will also get Google Cloud’s support in enhancing its culture of innovation, including the creation of dedicated, inclusive upskilling and certification programs for Maisons’ teams.

Virgil Abloh's Off-White Label Gets Acquired by LVMH - EBONY,"Wed, 21 Jul 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiPmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVib255LmNvbS92aXJnaWwtYWJsb2gtb2ZmLXdoaXRlLWFjcXVpcmVkLWJ5LWx2bWgv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Off-White, an Italian luxury label founded by American designer Virgil Abloh, has entered into another rarefied space in the fashion world. The French retail empire LVMH has just announced that it is set to acquire a majority stake in the company, making Abloh, a Black designer and creative from Rockford, Illinois, into a new-age Karl Lagerfeld.



While LVMH has not purchased the day-to-day operations of Off-White, it has been rumored to have spent a Brinks truck-worth of money to obtain a 60 percent stake in the brain of Off-White. Abloh will maintain 40 percent interest in the company while keeping his current role. Additionally, New Guards Group will stay on board as the label’s operating partner, having worked with the 40-year-old artistic director since the company’s birth.



Abloh will continue to oversee Louis Vuitton’s menswear collection, following the immense success the company has had since his appointment in March 2018.



In less than a decade, Off-White has become one of the most influential luxury streetwear brands in the world. With coveted drops including hoodies, bags, and sneakers, the label has collaborated with brands, such as Nike, IKEA, Byredo, Jimmy Choo, and more.

The news comes as LVMH looks to grow its already stocked portfolio, working with the designer to create opportunities for Off-White to expand into categories including Wine and Spirits and Hospitality, as well."
LVMH sales gain as Europe shows “gradual recovery” - Vogue Business,"Tue, 27 Jul 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZvZ3VlYnVzaW5lc3MuY29tL2NvbXBhbmllcy9sdm1oLXNhbGVzLWdhaW4tYXMtZXVyb3BlLXNob3dzLWdyYWR1YWwtcmVjb3ZlcnnSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"To receive the Vogue Business newsletter, sign up here.

Europe is beginning to show signs of a rebound for LVMH in the second quarter, after the fashion industry saw slower recovery here from the Covid-19 pandemic compared to other regions.

LVMH, which owns Louis Vuitton and Dior among others, has seen fashion and leather goods sales continue to accelerate ahead of pre-pandemic levels in its second-quarter earnings results on Monday. The category was up 40 per cent compared to the second quarter of 2019, driven by the two powerhouses, but also Celine, Loewe, Fendi and Marc Jacobs.

The group’s total revenue for the first half of the year was €28.7 billion, up 14 per cent compared to the same period in 2019, and 56 per cent compared to the same period in 2020. Profits hit €7.6 billion, up 44 per cent compared to the first half of 2019 and more than four times higher than 2020. Sales in Europe were down 15 per cent in Q2 compared with 2019, an improvement from the first quarter’s 18 per cent decline. The “gradual recovery” in Europe is driven by northern countries, which are less reliant on tourist spend, according to LVMH chief financial officer Jean-Jacques Guiony. In France, a severe lockdown over the past few months and a higher exposure to stemmed tourist flows than other countries impacted sales. Spain and Italy were also affected."

By Arabella Mileham

French luxury good company LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton saw growth in its wine and spirits division in the first half of the year on the back of demand in China and sustained growth in the USA.

The wine and spirits division rose 44% in organic growth to Euro 2,705 million, up from Euro 1,985million in the same period in 2020, an increase of 12% on 2019. Profit from its reoccuring business across wines and spirits was up 68% compared to the first half of 2020, or up 20% compared to the pre-pandemic year of 2019.

There was good volume growth across its Champagne brands, with volumes rose 10% compared to the first half of 2019, driven by the momentum in Europe and the United States. However supply constraints for Hennessy cognac limited volumes growth to only 6% on the 2019 figures.

The company saw a strong rebound in China, which was the first market to have been impacted by the pandemic in early 2020, while demand in the United States remained stable.

LVMH took a 50% equity stake in the Champagne Maison Armand de Brignac.

The luxury goods company, whose brands include Moët, Dom Pérignon champagne and Hennessy cognac, as well as fashion brands Louis Vuitton, Christian Dior, Fendi and Tiffany’s, said that momentum had returned, with accelerated growth in the second quarter of 2021. However the figures show that wines and spirits were the exception to this, showing moderatly more growth in the first quarter, of Euro 1,510 million compared to 1,195 million in the second quarter.

Total revenue rose 56% over the first half of 2021, compared to the first half of 2020 to €28.66bn and 14% compared to the first half of 2019 (organic revenue growth was reportedly up 53% on 2020 and 11% compared to 2019), Organic revenue increase by 14% compared to 8% in the first quarter.

As a result, net profit was €5.29bn, ten times higher than in the first half of 2020 and 62% higher than the first half of 2019.

CEO and chairman Bernard Arnault said it had been an excellent half-year.

“LVMH… is reaping the benefits of having continued to innovate and invest in its businesses throughout the pandemic despite being in the midst of a global crisis,” he said.

“Within the current context, as we emerge from the health crisis and see a recovery in the global economy, I believe that LVMH is in an excellent position to continue to grow and further strengthen our lead in the global luxury market in 2021.”

The company reported strong sales growth in Asia and the US, notably in its fashion and luggage portfolio and a gradual recovery in Europe – despite there being an large-scale return to international travel."
"LVMH's Landmark Virgil Abloh Alliance, Explained | BoF - The Business of Fashion","Fri, 23 Jul 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzb2ZmYXNoaW9uLmNvbS9icmllZmluZ3MvbHV4dXJ5L2x2bWhzLWxhbmRtYXJrLXZpcmdpbC1hYmxvaC1hbGxpYW5jZS1leHBsYWluZWQv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"There has been no shortage of palace intrigue at the world’s largest luxury company. Soon after backing Phoebe Philo’s new venture, LVMH said this week it was acquiring a majority stake in the entity through which Virgil Abloh owns Off-White’s intellectual property.

Farfetch-owned New Guards Group, which founded Off-White with the polymathic creative director in 2014, will continue to operate the hot-but-cooling haute streetwear brand through a licensing agreement, though Abloh said the deal would bring “additional firepower and scale to accelerate our momentum and evolve Off-White into a truly multi-line luxury brand.”

For LVMH, however, the alliance is likely less about Off-White and more about solidifying its link to Abloh, a rare creative talent whose contract as men’s artistic director of Louis Vuitton has an expiry date and who has surely been approached by competitors in Europe and the US.

Abloh is highly unique at LVMH and in the luxury industry at large. “I’m not a designer,” he said back in 2018 soon after his debut show for Vuitton.

Of course, Abloh was a pioneer in bringing streetwear aesthetics to the luxury market, adding an architectural edge along the way. More Hedi Slimane than Raf Simons, he may not have invented the look, though he certainly helped to popularise it.

But Abloh also reinvented the role of a creative director, injecting it with hip-hop’s penchant for sampling and remixing, skateboarding’s sense of community and a desire for social progress just as a new generation of fashion consumers were acquiring greater purchasing power and looking not just for cool-looking clothes, but something to believe in and belong to.

Critically, Abloh has always engaged directly with his followers, making them feel like upstream participants welcome in his world, not just downstream consumers of his vision. His fans didn’t flock to his drops just to shop. They came to hang out. And he offered them not just product but process: “cheat codes” and “trails of information” for how to launch brands of their own. “You can do it too” read the caption under his first Instagram post after his Vuitton debut.

The result was marketing magic: a novel approach to luxury branding that was more open-source than ivory tower, no matter the high price points.

“Ask a kid on the street, the face of the future, about Louis Vuitton, and I guarantee they think of Virgil first,” said Highsnobiety co-founder Jeff Carvalho. “He has changed the rules of how you market product forever. For LVMH, he’s lightning in a bottle.”

Abloh is also a cross-generational figure who understands the youth, but can work with the likes of Louis Vuitton chief Michael Burke, who has called Abloh the Karl Lagerfeld of his time, a multi-tasking creative genius with business savvy and almost superhuman energy.

It’s no surprise LVMH wanted to keep Abloh close beyond his current Vuitton contract. And the group seems to have spotted an opportunity: when New Guards Group sold to Farfetch for $675 million in 2019, Abloh did not see a return, despite having co-founded its most successful brand.

Now, LVMH appears to have found a way to offer Abloh an overdue payday, while tying him to the group long-term, using more or less the same mechanism it used to attract and retain top talents like John Galliano, Marc Jacobs and Jonathan Anderson, each of whom effectively got financial support for their own brands in exchange for longtime service at one of the group’s heritage houses: Galliano at Dior, Jacobs at Vuitton and Anderson at Loewe.

ADVERTISEMENT

But without a suitable vacancy at a major LVMH brand, it seems Abloh will have another, more horizontal mission, at least for now: “leverage together the group’s expertise to launch new brands and partner with existing ones in a variety of sectors beyond the realm of fashion.”

Abloh has certainly proven that he can bring significant buzz to brands across a wide range of categories, having worked with everyone from Nike and Ikea to Evian and Rimowa, and can surely help to re-energise some of the group’s more stagnant brands, perhaps taking advantage of his rare horizontal role to break down silos and cross-pollinate the portfolio. His background as a DJ on the nightlife circuit could also come in handy with some of the spirits labels.

Launching new brands may be a more difficult task. LVMH has a poor track record with start-ups and it remains to be seen whether the conglomerate can successfully build its own equivalent to New Guards Group. But if anyone can help them do it, it’s Abloh. Not only does he have a strong instinct for making brands sticky. He also has an unparalleled network of next-generation creators and a community full of aspirants, giving the group a de facto talent pipeline.

Of course, Off-White’s agreement with New Guards Group runs through 2035 but can be renegotiated or terminated in 2026, at which point LVMH may choose to take on the operation of the label, too, embedding it at the core of the brand accelerator that Abloh seems set to build.

Virgil Abloh lands his dream job at LVMH - Quartz,"Tue, 20 Jul 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vcXouY29tLzIwMzU5MDUvdmlyZ2lsLWFibG9oLWxhbmRzLWhpcy1kcmVhbS1qb2ItYXQtbHZtaNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LVMH, the French luxury conglomerate whose portfolio of brands ranges from Louis Vuitton to Moët to Tiffany, is giving American designer Virgil Abloh license to get creative across its businesses.

The company announced today it is expanding its relationship with Abloh, the founder of fashion label Off-White who LVMH hired as artistic director of Louis Vuitton menswear in 2018. LVMH will buy a controlling stake in Off-White LLC and team with Abloh to launch new brands and “partner with existing ones in a variety of sectors beyond the realm of fashion.”

That means Abloh will get to branch out beyond fashion to LVMH’s other segments, which include liquor, watches, and leather goods. “There’s areas within the spirits side of the business that are attractive to me; there’s areas within the hospitality, the hotels side; jewelry—you know, more minutiae within the fashion segment,” Abloh told fashion trade outlet WWD (paywall). “My eyes have always been wide in terms of fashion, arts and culture and how they can merge together.”

Virgil Abloh, fashion’s master collaborator

What, exactly, Abloh’s role will be is a bit vague. LVMH has not provided further details, and Michael Burke, CEO of Louis Vuitton, told WWD neither LVMH nor Abloh would be playing a traditional role seen before in the luxury industry.

But Abloh, a 40-year-old from Chicago, is widely known as fashion‘s most prolific collaborator, regularly working with brands in a variety of industries. He has made home goods with IKEA, a water bottle with Evian, sneakers with Nike, a chair with Vitra, denim with Levi’s, women’s shoes with Jimmy Choo, sunglasses with Warby Parker, and more. He’s worked on items with LVMH brands, too, including a transparent suitcase for its high-end luggage line, Rimowa, and bottles for Moët’s Nectar Imperial Rosé.

In some cases the collaboration is essentially a tweak of one—or 10—of a company’s established designs, maybe emblazoned with a word or phrase in quotation marks, an Abloh signature. He has talked often about his “three percent approach,” altering an existing item by just 3% to make it new. Wholly original or not, products with Abloh’s name attached tend to generate attention.

In addition to working on similar projects across LVMH’s portfolio, Abloh’s company, Off-White, will get the resources to expand into other product lines, while Abloh will help launch new brands from a diverse array of designers. In the announcement of the deal, Abloh said he would use the partnership “to expand opportunities for diverse individuals and foster greater equity and inclusion.”

LVMH looks to the future

One question is why LVMH is undertaking the project now. The company has emerged from the pandemic as one of luxury’s strongest performers and appears to be using the moment to position itself for the future. This year it completed its acquisition of Tiffany. Recently it announced it will back a new fashion company from Phoebe Philo, former creative director of its Celine brand.

It seems it wants to reenergize its existing brands too—before they get tired. “We have many old-line businesses at LVMH, and they’re very successful,” Burke told WWD. “But one day, most of them will reawaken to something quite different, and we don’t know what that is. But we sure know that by putting extreme creative talent with extreme provenance, sparks will happen.”"

LVMH acquires a majority stake in Virgil Abloh’s ubiquitous streetwear brand Off-White. The LVMH group continues to expand its fashion federation. The luxury group recently purchased a 60 percent stake in the streetwear brand Off-White, onboarding its founder Virgil Abloh in hopes of rumbling the status quo. In addition to his role as the artistic director of Louis Vuitton’s menswear, Abloh’s larger position within the luxury giant documents his cross-pollination between their Hospitality and Wine and Spirits categories, with an equal stake in each of his projects. The combination between the deal and LVMH’s tradition of owning a minority stake in personal brands of their designers positions Off-White to expand into arenas such as cosmetics and homeware, a process Abloh coins “generational growth,” and stations himself as one of the most powerful Black executives within a global luxury firepower. Denver will designate the country’s first historic district honoring the Chicano Movement. After the Denver Landmark Preservation Commission voted unanimously to advance a proposal for the creation of the La Alma Lincoln Park Historic Cultural District earlier this month, it appears the city is poised to make it official in August. When completed, it will mark the first historic district to pay tribute to Chicano movement and will offer protections for the neighborhood’s single-family homes and community buildings, as well as the Denver Inner City Parish and the recreation center in La Alma Lincoln Park, which both have two heritage murals. “It is definitely a nod and acknowledgment to all of that history that came with this neighborhood; it really helped create a lot of the influence that you see today for the Latino community for cultural marks, for murals, for politics,” council member Jamie Torres, who represents the area, told The Denver Post in May. “There are roots right there in that neighborhood.”

“Spike” by Banksy …

An artwork by Banksy has gone up for auction as an NFT without his knowledge. Italian tenor Vittorio Grigolo plans to sell a digital version of his Banksy piece, Spike, as an NFT on the platform he co-founded, ValuArt. There’s only one problem: there’s no proof he owns it. The artwork in question is a section of wall from the barrier between Palestine and Israel, which was supposedly part of a treasure hunt Banksy launched in 2005 in Palestinian territory, promising a certificate of authenticity to anyone who could find it. It remains unclear how it ended up in Grigolo’s possession. Says Pest Control Office, the non-profit company officially in charge of selling and authenticating Banksy’s works: “Neither Banksy or Pest Control license the artist’s images to third parties. Please do not use Banksy’s images for any commercial purpose, including launching a range of merchandise or tricking people into thinking something is made or endorsed by the artist when it isn’t.” The embattled Humboldt Forum opens in Berlin after years of delays and controversy. After years of delays and controversy, the Humboldt Forum opened to the public in Berlin’s former Palast der Republik earlier this week. The embattled museum will soon host six exhibitions, notably “Terrible Beauty: Elephant. Human.

Its opening arrives at a time when awareness about Europe’s fraught history of illicit acquisitions of art and artifacts has attracted mainstream attention, with much of the attention focusing on how such objects arrived in the museum’s collections.

Disney has announced plans to build a sprawling regional campus in central Florida, where at least 2,000 professional employees working in digital technology, finance, and product development will relocate from Southern California. “Florida is known for its rich culture of hospitality and active lifestyle as well as a lower cost of living with no state income tax,” Disney Parks chairman Josh D’Amaro said in an open letter to employees. The new Disney campus will be located about 20 miles to the east of Disney World, which is roughly the size of the city of San Francisco.

French luxury conglomerate LVMH said Tuesday it intends to take a majority stake in the luxury streetwear label Off-White created by Virgil Abloh, the first black American creative director of a top French fashion house.



LVMH will take a 60 percent stake in Off-White for an undisclosed sum, according to a statement.



Abloh will retain 40 percent and remain creative director for the men's collections of LVMH's Louis Vuitton fashion house.



The Italian group New Guards, which currently owns a majority of Off-White, will remain a partner to the brand via a licencing agreement after the deal, which is subject to regulatory approvals, is finalised.



The deal marks an expansion of Abloh's collaboration with LVMH, the world's top luxury group, and he said he envisaged potential partnerships with its non-fashion brands as well as starting new ones of his own.



""For nearly a decade, we've been building Off-White to be a brand designed to empower our generation and challenge the status quo,"" Abloh said in a statement.



""LVMH brings to the table the additional firepower and scale to accelerate our momentum and evolve Off-White into a truly multi-line luxury brand,"" he added.



Abloh has addressed both environmental and social issues in his work with Louis Vuitton, with anti-racist and anti-homophobia messages at his January show in Paris.



He said he plans to use his partnership with LVMH ""to expand opportunities for diverse individuals and foster greater equity and inclusion in the industries we serve"".

The Logic Behind LVMH's Phoebe Philo Deal - The Business of Fashion,"Fri, 16 Jul 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzb2ZmYXNoaW9uLmNvbS9icmllZmluZ3MvbHV4dXJ5L3RoZS1sb2dpYy1iZWhpbmQtbHZtaHMtcGhvZWJlLXBoaWxvLWRlYWwv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"This week, news of Phoebe Philo’s return to fashion with her own label after a more than three-year hiatus thrilled the industry. But the chic minimalism she brought to former employer Celine — where she delivered a successful reboot for owners LVMH, growing annual revenue from €200 million to more than €700 million by the time she stepped down at the end of 2017 — has earned her a loyal fanbase of “Philophiles” that extends well beyond fashion insiders.

LVMH is backing Philo’s new venture in return for a minority stake in the brand, named simply Phoebe Philo. But the group that skilfully manages giants like Louis Vuitton and Dior has a poor track record with start-ups. Earlier this year, LVMH announced the shuttering of the Fenty fashion label it developed with pop star Rihanna less than two years after launch.

Can Philo’s new brand grow into a business that will move the needle for the world’s largest luxury group with a market capitalisation of almost $400 billion?

Smaller labels often struggle within conglomerates like LVMH for a few reasons. For a start, they are slapped with heavy corporate charges without really benefiting from many of the synergies that can come from being part of a group as their founders struggle to navigate internal politics and bureaucracy. But most of all, smaller labels are starved for attention from senior management, who are naturally focused on the big brands that dominate their portfolios.

For LVMH chief Bernard Arnault, successfully integrating Tiffany, the American jeweller the group recently acquired for $15.8 billion, is rightly top of mind and he is unlikely to have much headspace for the Phoebe Philo label.

At the same time, launching a new fashion brand with a star designer can be a very expensive and risky proposition. There is inherent risk in building a brand around a single individual. Plus, designers like Phoebe Philo come with big expectations, multi-million-dollar salaries, large creative teams and associated sampling and development costs.

Then, there’s the massive marketing expenditure required to generate awareness for a new brand. Even a superstar designer like Hedi Slimane, who has attracted a global following of “Slimaniacs,” is relatively unknown to mainstream consumers. Ditto Philo.

Factor in the capital expenditure associated with high-gloss physical stores — still critical to the luxury business model — and the scarcity of appropriate retail real estate on the world’s most prestigious shopping streets and, all told, the investment required to launch a new luxury brand in the first few years alone can easily add up to $50 million or more.

Without an existing platform like Celine, which had 120 stores and €200 million in sales when Philo joined in 2008, realising a return on that investment can take a very long time.

Could this time be different?

The rise of digital distribution is a key variable. It’s far more possible to quickly scale a young brand online than in the physical world. The digital-first Fenty misadventure suggests that it’s not easy. But what ultimately sunk the Rihanna label was a misalignment between the pop star’s fan base and Fenty’s prices. Poorly executed product only deepened the problem.

By contrast, the Phoebe Philo brand, positioned at the luxury end of the market, is a better fit for LVMH’s playbook and may be a safer place for the group to experiment with a digital-first business model. Philo’s famously anti-technology stance could prove a stumbling block, but time away from the industry may also have provided the designer with some new perspective and her strategy for the label could bypass the traditional fashion system and focus on digital channels.

Of course, LVMH may also have other motives for re-aligning itself with Philo. Whether or not the new brand scales, the investment is a smart defensive play. LVMH was surely eager to keep such a talented designer close and out of the hands of rivals. Backing her label may ultimately be a small price to pay for keeping her away from the likes of Chanel, Kering and Richemont, where she could one day prove a threat.

Keeping Philo close also leaves open the possibility that she could help LVMH with a bigger project in the future, energising ultra-luxury cashmere house Lora Piana, which recently launched its first major handbag, for example, or even bringing fresh ideas to one of LVMH’s biggest brands when a creative director vacancy opens up down the road.

Philo has thus far resisted taking on another job as big as Celine — and not for lack of offers. Plus, designing a major brand while simultaneously growing a new label demands almost superhuman, Karl Lagerfeld-like energy and pace that very few in the business have come close to matching. But keeping Phoebe Philo in its orbit offers LVMH unmistakable optionality.

“Keeping her within LVMH is a great move in itself,” said Bernstein analyst Luca Solca. “Having her to contribute to one of the major brands down the road would be a home run.”

Fenty, Rihanna’s fashion brand, backed by LVMH, was put on indefinite hold in February, while in 2005 LVMH sold off Christian Lacroix, a brand Arnault founded in 1987. Now, the company is betting that, with Abloh in charge, upcoming new ventures will take off thanks to his cultural relevance outside of luxury. The designer’s reach could extend beyond fashion into other LVMH categories including, potentially, hotels, champagnes, spirits, beauty, fragrance and jewellery.

Abloh has been widely lauded as leading the next generation of creative directors, and is a multi-hyphenated talent, working as an artist, engineer and DJ in addition to fashion design. He has pushed the boundaries of collaborations: Abloh, who counts over 6 million Instagram followers (plus over 10 million on Off-White’s account), has teamed up with brands from Evian to Ikea and Mercedes-Benz, representing luxury’s shift toward cultural relevance. His strong ties to hip-hop culture, including stints with Kanye West, see Abloh referenced personally in hit songs from rappers like AJ Tracey and Dave, building his cachet with younger shoppers.

“This is an incredible new platform to take the disruption we’ve achieved together to a whole new level,” Abloh said. “I’m also honoured to use this partnership to deepen my longstanding commitment to expand opportunities for diverse individuals and foster greater equity and inclusion in the industries we serve.”

A modern-day Karl Lagerfeld

Given LVMH has a broad reach in luxury hotels, champagne and fine wines, could a Hennessy collaboration be on the cards to sell the cognac to a new customer? It’s not unlikely, analysts say, with his impact likely to reverberate through other categories in the company. Abloh has already designed a limited edition bottle for Moët & Chandon, while his protege Samuel Ross collaborated with watch brand Hublot.

“Beyond fashion, LVMH could well reach out to Abloh to infuse coolness into other assets of its own from hospitality to fragrance and cosmetics to spirits,” says Erwan Rambourg, author of Future Luxe. “What Virgil Abloh has infused in both [Off-White and Louis Vuitton] has a major halo effect. It’s about capturing the zeitgeist. [Abloh] is a modern-day Karl Lagerfeld, with a similar Midas touch.” That said, it’s not clear the extent of Abloh’s new position at LVMH, and whether or not he will act as an advisor to new brands or be more hands-on."

The move will give Abloh the opportunity to launch brands and partnerships in other areas of LVMH, not just the fashion division, which is a fairly unique proposition.

""I’m completely honoured,"" Abloh told WWD. ""There’s a long trajectory of creative directors partnering with a house, but this is something completely new, and I commend Mr. Arnault and Michael Burke for seeing my talent across spectrums and incubating me to a place where I can suggest different things that don’t fall in the realm of a runway show.""

Abloh gave some clues into the markets he was hoping to move into with the label, explaining that he wants to see fashion, art and culture merge together.

""There’s areas within the spirits side of the business that are attractive to me; there’s areas within the hospitality, the hotels side; jewellery — you know, more minutiae within the fashion segment. My eyes have always been wide in terms of fashion, arts and culture and how they can merge together. So the announcement is leaning on that, that now there’s an opportunity to grow new segments and root myself within LVMH, the group.""

Meanwhile, Michael Burke, chairman and CEO of Louis Vuitton, praised Abloh's creative eye and expressed excitement at this new and unique partnership.

""He’s shown that he has the pulse of the fashion world, but he’s also very design-driven,"" he said. ""In other words, he has a very long-term view of beauty and designing beauty. So the time’s right now to do things on a different level within LVMH.""

Luxury’s recovery is getting stronger for the larger conglomerates. Both LVMH and Gucci-owner Kering posted accelerating second-quarter sales performances from Asia-Pacific and North America, as well as signalled Europe is on a gradual rebound despite store closures.

Kering’s performance in the second quarter beat expectations, though not at the same magnitude as LVMH, with an 11 per cent revenue increase versus the second quarter of 2019, and a 95 per cent increase compared to the same period in 2020, to €4.2 billion. “All our houses contributed to a sharp rebound in total revenue, which comfortably exceeded its 2019 level, with a remarkable acceleration in the second quarter,” Kering chairman and CEO François-Henri Pinault stated. Sales at its biggest brand Gucci rose 4 per cent, Saint Laurent rose 15 per cent, Bottega Veneta 30 per cent and the other houses category (including Balenciaga and Alexander McQueen) climbed 20 per cent.

LVMH also said its fashion and leather goods unit climbed ahead of pre-pandemic levels in its second-quarter earnings, up 40 per cent compared to the second quarter of 2019, driven by its two powerhouse brands Dior and Louis Vuitton as well as Celine, Loewe, Fendi and Marc Jacobs. Watches and jewellery division rose 9 per cent in Q2 versus 2019 (excluding Tiffany), an acceleration on Q1’s 1 per cent uptick. The group’s total revenue for the first half climbed 14 percent to €28.7 billion versus 2019 and 56 per cent compared to the same period in 2020.

The US and China drove the bulk of spending growth for both houses, but Europe is looking promising after a prolonged pandemic downturn. For LVMH, Northern Europe countries showed strong local sales growth as more tourist-reliant countries including France, Spain and Italy lagged. For both companies, local clients are playing a critical role in driving Europe’s gradual rebound. Gucci noted double-digit growth among local clientele compared to 2019 both online and off, according to Kering group managing director Jean Francois Palus.

“Overall, Kering is reporting a more moderate rebound than what we have seen at LVMH fashion and leather goods division,” says Bernstein analyst Luca Solca, who notes that LVMH reported its strongest first-half ever on Monday. “But this was in a way known when one looks at traffic and social media traction analyses. The update is probably a touch short of buyside expectations as the growth gap between Gucci and LVMH fashion and leather goods widens.” Solca adds that new Gucci collections hitting the market combined with the release of the House of Gucci film could give the brand a boost in the second half of the year."
"Will Alexandre Arnault run LVMH when his father, Bernard, retires? - South China Morning Post","Fri, 16 Jul 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjbXAuY29tL2xpZmVzdHlsZS9mYXNoaW9uLWJlYXV0eS9hcnRpY2xlLzMxNDExMDAvd2lsbC1hbGV4YW5kcmUtYXJuYXVsdC1zdWNjZWVkLWJlcm5hcmQtYXJuYXVsdC1sdm1oLXdvcmxkc9IBeGh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLnNjbXAuY29tL2xpZmVzdHlsZS9mYXNoaW9uLWJlYXV0eS9hcnRpY2xlLzMxNDExMDAvd2lsbC1hbGV4YW5kcmUtYXJuYXVsdC1zdWNjZWVkLWJlcm5hcmQtYXJuYXVsdC1sdm1oLXdvcmxkcw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"On the day of the party, transport workers were on strike in the city, leaving many employees to travel to the venue on foot. The former IT employee said he rented a bike and cycled to the party.

Held in December 2019 in Paris, the celebration would be at a ritzy venue overlooking the hilltop district of Montmartre. Employees would compete in games to win Rimowa suitcases as prizes. A former IT employee said the boss urged everyone to go “in their best outfits”.

For weeks, Alexandre Arnault, the CEO of the premium luggage brand Rimowa, was hyping up the company’s ski-themed holiday party.

At the last minute, Alexandre – then 27 – decided he wasn’t going, citing the strikes as an excuse.

“He just sent a message like an hour before saying that he’s not going to come,” the IT employee said. “It was so weird that he didn’t come, because it was one of the biggest events for employees in Paris, and they were happy to go even though it was during the strikes.”

A former administrative employee who attended the party said: “People were disappointed, that’s for sure.”

Alexandre’s failure to materialise that evening was a letdown to employees who were eager to get to know the son of the world’s third-richest man and potential heir to the largest luxury empire. His father, Bernard Arnault, runs LVMH, which owns brands including Louis Vuitton, Dom Pérignon and Dior . Bernard Arnault’s US$170 billion fortune puts him behind only Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk in personal wealth.

At 72, Bernard is showing no signs that he’s ready to retire. But as he gets older and richer, and as the LVMH empire continues to expand (it bought the iconic jewellery house Tiffany & Co. last year for US$15.8 billion), the question of who will one day succeed him is timelier than ever. Locked in an unspoken competition for that very position are the four of Bernard’s five adult children who hold leadership roles in the group, luxury analysts said.

“My view is that the father is basically testing all of them: seeing how they behave, how they act, how successful they can be, how good they can be in what they do,” a luxury-industry veteran who knows the family said. “And then when the time comes, he’ll decide who is going to be the chosen one.”

Alexandre’s audition comes in the form of a leadership role at Tiffany’s. In January 2021, the 29-year-old was appointed the company’s executive vice-president. The role has positioned him as a strong contender to head up the conglomerate, but he now faces his biggest and most visible challenge yet: transforming Tiffany from an iconic yet languishing brand into a global powerhouse.

His four years at Rimowa have left no doubt that Alexandre has the vision to modernise a stiff legacy brand. He’s been described as a leader who is talented at capturing the zeitgeist, and adept at leveraging the elite connections – think Jay-Z and Snap boss Evan Spiegel – of the world he was born into.

However, some former Rimowa employees said he was stand-offish, inexperienced and failed to build trust with his team. What remains to be seen is how much his youth and lack of extensive leadership experience will affect his ability to successfully helm Tiffany and Co. and potentially one day LVMH.

We spoke with 25 people, including individuals who’ve worked with Alexandre and luxury industry analysts, to better understand how well the executive is prepared for the challenge ahead of him. Alexandre and the rest of the Arnault family declined to be interviewed for this story.

An LVMH representative said Bernard has not yet considered when he will retire or who will be his successor. His children “are all focused on their current position to grow their business and contribute to the group”, the representative said.

To understand Alexandre, you first must understand the power of the Arnaults. One way to measure that power is to look at how many – or how few – people are willing to cross them. Many people I contacted for this story ignored me, while others said they weren’t comfortable speaking about the Arnaults because of the family’s obsession with discretion.

The expansive LVMH empire employs 150,000 people, and the group’s shining star, Louis Vuitton , is the most valuable luxury brand in the world.

“He has built a conglomerate that has no equivalent at all in the luxury industry,” the luxury industry veteran said of Bernard. “By far, LVMH is more powerful and has more resources than any other group or any single brand that you can think of in the luxury industry.”

Bernard took control of LVMH in 1989 and grew the conglomerate from nine maisons to 75 brands and a high of nearly US$60 billion in revenue in 2019 . The chairman and CEO, who today holds a 47.5 per cent stake in LVMH, has been nicknamed “the wolf in the cashmere coat” for his aggressive business tactics and demeanour.

At least some of this appears to have rubbed off on Alexandre. Anthony Ledru, Tiffany’s CEO, who joined the company from Louis Vuitton in January, described Alexandre as a risk-taker who is motivated by winning and, above all, by creating change.

“That’s what I think motivates him: avoiding the status quo,” Ledru said.

Bernard Arnault’s wealth has grown at an astonishing rate, even by billionaire standards. Since January 2019, he has more than doubled his net worth and surpassed business magnate Bill Gates and Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg to become the world’s third-richest person.

It’s the kind of wealth that can buy a private island in the Bahamas, a jet, homes in Paris, the French Riviera and Los Angeles, and an art collection with pieces by Jean-Michel Basquiat and Pablo Picasso.

Alexandre is Bernard’s third child, and his first with his second wife, the concert pianist Hélène Mercier-Arnault. Like his mother, Alexandre is an accomplished pianist: his Instagram bio link shows him performing a Chopin concerto alongside an ensemble orchestra. And like his dad, he has a taste for spending when the occasion calls for it. For Valentine’s Day this year, Alexandre booked out a Michelin-starred Manhattan restaurant, Carbone , for dinner with his wife, the fashion designer Geraldine Guyot.

Growing up, Alexandre would spend his Saturdays in LVMH brand stores, he told a French news outlet in 2017: “My holidays often included visits to stores in other countries.”

This proximity to the business empire has extended well into adulthood. Bernard’s children are a who’s who of LVMH power players.

His oldest child, Delphine, 46, is an executive vice-president of Louis Vuitton. The second oldest, Antoine , 44, is the CEO of Berluti, chairman of Loro Piana and head of image, communications and environment for LVMH. Alexandre’s younger brother, Frederic , 26, was last year named CEO of Tag Heuer. And finally, there’s 23-year-old Jean, who’s still a student and hasn’t joined the group – yet.

Most industry watchers have no doubt that the next leader of LVMH will be one of the Arnault children.

“Bernard Arnault lives and breathes luxury,” said Erwan Rambourg, the author of Future Luxe. “He’s obsessed – in a good way. I don’t think he’s a man that will say, ‘Oh, I’ll take a bit of distance’ and leave it to a CEO who is not part of the family.”

In a 2013 documentary, Bernard himself said of his children: “At least one of them will show themselves capable of taking over.”

When asked if Bernard stood by this comment, the LVMH representative said: “As said by Mr Arnault in the book Les Grands Fauves: ‘I put my children in the bath. At the moment I observe their way of swimming.’”

With a life that has revolved around LVMH, Alexandre grew up rubbing shoulders with celebrities and business moguls. And with an impeccably groomed six-foot (183cm) frame and a penchant for stylish, understated suits, he blends into these crowds.

At a Louis Vuitton fashion show in Paris in January 2018, Alexandre sat in the front row with David Beckham . At another show in June, he was sandwiched between Rihanna and Bella Hadid. Proving that wealth really does increase proximity to other wealth, he’s met Jeff Bezos – whom he called one of his idols – and US businessman Warren Buffett.

Alexandre is well connected to leaders in the tech world, like media company Snap founder and CEO Evan Spiegel, who met the Arnault family through Delphine’s partner, the French tech billionaire Xavier Niel. Spiegel, 31, said it’s not necessarily charisma that helps Alexandre cultivate his business relationships.

“He’s very good at building trust with people because he communicates and operates in a really honest way,” Spiegel said on a recent phone call. “And I think that’s really valued in the business world.”

Among the ultrarich, a well-maintained friendship can be the basis of a lucrative business deal – and vice versa. “He knows everyone,” Rambourg said. “So he’ll call up Pharrell Williams or Jay-Z or whoever. That’s the crowd he hangs out with.”

And, as evidenced by at least one recent high-profile deal, he seems to be adept at leveraging this impressive roster of friends in business transactions. Earlier this year, LVMH announced it was buying half of Jay-Z’s Champagne brand, Armand de Brignac, for an undisclosed amount. Alexandre brokered the deal.

He does not accept the traditional luxury way of looking at things Hugues Bonnet-Masimbert, CEO of Rimowa

The two met several years ago when Jay-Z was in Paris with Kanye West, according to The Wall Street Journal, and they talk on the phone at least once a month, the rapper told The New York Times in February, adding that Alexandre “always keeps his word” and is “very punctual”.

Josh Udashkin, Rimowa’s former managing director for North America, said of Alexandre: “He is networking and networking nonstop.” Alexandre’s talent for leveraging celebrity also came through in his four years at the helm of Rimowa.

After famously persuading his father to acquire Rimowa for US$717 million in 2016 , Alexandre came on board at 24 as co-CEO alongside Dieter Morszeck. At the time, Alexandre’s only work experience outside LVMH was two summers in 2014 and 2015, when he worked in New York at the consulting firm McKinsey and then at the investment firm KKR.

His youth did not go unnoticed. “When you come and work for a 26-year-old CEO, obviously you have to ask yourself the question how it’s going to go,” said Hugues Bonnet-Masimbert, Rimowa’s former executive vice-president, who was appointed CEO when Alexandre left in January. But Bonnet-Masimbert also said Alexandre’s youth was one of his biggest strengths: “He does not accept the traditional luxury way of looking at things.”

Tom Nelson, a former executive vice-president and North America managing director for Rimowa, said Alexandre “picked up his father’s sophistication”. “Brilliant young kid, very well schooled, well heeled,” Nelson added. “You wouldn’t have thought he was 25 when you met him.”

Under Alexandre’s leadership, the brand raised prices by an average of 20 per cent, launched a line of sunglasses and backpacks, and opened boutiques in places like Soho in New York and Berlin in Germany. But its biggest buzz was generated by collaborations, one of which started as an Instagram DM between Alexandre and Virgil Abloh , the founder of fashion house Off-White.

The resulting Off-White x Rimowa collection, which included a US$1,200 transparent cabin suitcase, sold out within a week of its launch in 2018. That same year, people lined up around the block to get their hands on the red-and-white suitcases designed in collaboration with the streetwear brand Supreme

By the time Alexandre moved on from his post as CEO of Rimowa, an outsider might have had the impression the German luggage company was a nimble start-up, not 123 years old.

“Rimowa was always a brand that people saw as being premium, very practical and functional, but it wasn’t necessarily culturally relevant until it started making relevant associations with other brands from a collaborative perspective,” which brand strategist Michael Miraflor said.

“The legacy is you move from a relatively dull, little known, high-quality German luggage manufacturer to a pretty hip, sexy, collab-driven diversified company,” Rambourg said.

But his time there was not without criticism. In his revamp of Rimowa, Alexandre cut loose several members of the leadership team and replaced them with a mix of long-time LVMH executives and luxury outsiders. The circumstances surrounding the departure of the former CEO, Morszeck, the grandson of Rimowa’s founder who ran the company for 45 years before the acquisition, are murky.

The LVMH representative said Morszeck and Alexandre led Rimowa as co-CEOs until January 2020, when Alexandre became the sole CEO following a “smooth” transition that began in January 2019. One former Rimowa executive, however, said Morszeck had expected to stay at the company long-term but was gradually pushed out of his role before 2019 because LVMH was not happy with his performance. (LVMH declined to comment on this allegation.)

I truly believe he understands the fundamentals of luxury, which is the importance of history, the heritage, the formation Anthony Ledru, Tiffany & Co. CEO

Morszeck once said he thought of Alexandre as a son, but their relationship soured over disagreements about how to run the company, the former executive said. (The LVMH representative said this was “unfounded”.) Since the acquisition, countless news articles about Rimowa have referred to Alexandre as the sole CEO with Morszeck described as the former chief executive or not mentioned at all. Morszeck did not respond to requests for comment.

The former IT employee, who has worked for other LVMH brands, said that Rimowa employees felt intense pressure to cut expenses. “This is something that I never saw in any other maison,” he said. “You don’t look at the expenses when you are working for Louis Vuitton or Christian Dior. Of course there’s a budget, but if you need more money because a product needs to be improved, they don’t care.”

The LVMH representative denied this claim: “Alexandre’s priorities were clear: no compromise on quality and an obsession for continuous improvement.”

Like many celebrities, millionaires and businesspeople, Alexandre carefully controls his image.

He’s given his 126,000 Instagram followers glimpses into his life with photos with his younger brothers on holidays in Greece and Sicily, and of his wife – Alexandre married Guyot this summer – wearing a US$13,000 Tiffany necklace. But when I interviewed him last November for a different story, questions about his family were strictly off limits. Even questions about book recommendations were deemed too personal.

And while the executive is said to be able to turn on the charm when he wants to make a deal, he didn’t always bother when it came to his own employees, some former Rimowa staffers said.

At Rimowa, some saw the young CEO as stand-offish, a perception reinforced when he failed to show up to the 2019 holiday party. (The LVMH representative said Alexandre “always tried his best” to attend Rimowa’s social events and couldn’t attend the holiday party due to unforeseen circumstances.) Alexandre, who split his time between Rimowa’s headquarters in Cologne and its offices in Paris, didn’t bother to make small talk with employees at the office or at company events, some said.

Some felt that at company happy hours at various bars in Paris, Alexandre seemed to exist in an insular orbit. He would talk only to Bonnet-Masimbert, according to the former IT employee. And when the employee passed by Alexandre in the office, he said Alexandre would never wave or say hello even though they frequently spoke in meetings.

“Sometimes I see videos of him in interviews and he’s really good at outside communication like this,” the former IT employee said. “But in regular social interaction, I think he has a lot of improvement to do.”

It was a similar story in the Cologne office in Germany, where the former executive said Alexandre spoke only to “guys he knew from Paris or from the LVMH group”. The former administrative employee in Paris said she got the sense that Alexandre didn’t know how to act around his employees.

“He came into the job so young – he didn’t have any experience of managing,” she said, adding: “I don’t know if he had the time to try to figure out his management style and how to act with his employees.”

The LVMH representative said Alexandre is “an approachable leader, with his door always open. He spent time with employees in both factories and stores, and made numerous visits across the company”.

Tiffany is LVMH’s biggest acquisition ever and the largest deal ever made in the luxury industry. Alexandre’s appointment as the brand’s executive vice-president is an indication of just how important the jeweller is to his father, luxury analyst Rambourg said.

“From a very cynical point of view, he was put there as a sign that his father considers that this is a very, very important asset for the group,” Rambourg said of Alexandre. “And so you want to have some family skin in the game.”

Tiffany is where LVMH plans to devote all its resources, the group’s chief financial officer, Jean-Jacques Guiony, said in April according to fashion industry trade journal WWD.

It could also be viewed as a pain point – and a test of Alexandre. In 2017, The Wall Street Journal referred to Tiffany as a “brand with a midlife crisis”. In 2016, 45 per cent of Tiffany’s sales came from jewellery categories with an average price of under US$530, which luxury experts said was hurting the jeweller’s air of exclusivity, the newspaper said.

“Everyone knows Tiffany, but everyone knows the sort of stale Tiffany, where you walk into a store and it’s pretty cold and it’s white and blue and dull, and you have old white men like me standing behind the counter hoping that you’ll push the door,” Rambourg said. “It’s not exactly a super-exciting experience, given the prices you’re paying.”

Six months into his role as Tiffany’s head of product and communications, Alexandre’s touch on the brand has started to show up in the types of celebrities the company has signed and a distinct new playfulness.

“Alexandre brings this youthful approach, the connection with the young generation, very inclusive, very modern, very contemporary,” the industry veteran said.

At the Golden Globes in March, major Hollywood stars Gal Gadot of Wonder Woman and Anya Taylor-Joy of The Queen’s Gambit were adorned in Tiffany jewels. On April Fools’ Day, the jewellery house pranked its customers on social media by pretending that it was changing the brand’s signature colour from Tiffany blue to bright yellow.

“It’s completely quirky, but it’s hilarious,” Rambourg said. “The amount of buzz they had on that was off the charts.”

Alexandre also appears to be driving the jeweller to reinvent its digital strategy.

In March, Alexandre hired former Revlon creative director Ruba Abu-Nimah as Tiffany’s new creative director, which Miraflor described as a savvy move. “She has the experience, the network, and a finger on the pulse of what modern consumers desire,” Miraflor said.

Four months after Arnault came on board, Tiffany cancelled its daily print ad in The New York Times after 30 years and put its money towards digital ads at the paper, WWD reported.

In June, Tiffany launched a sultry new ad campaign featuring skin-baring models and taglines like “Big Drip” and “Swagged Out”. A clear departure from Tiffany’s demure, traditional campaigns before the LVMH acquisition, the ads were “provocative, sexy” and did not feature Tiffany’s signature blue anywhere, Miraflor pointed out.

Ledru, Tiffany’s CEO, said it’s not just youth and being a “digital whizz” that makes Alexandre a successful luxury executive.

“I truly believe he understands the fundamentals of luxury, which is the importance of history, the heritage, the formation,” Ledru said. “He’s been exposed to the business for quite a long time and he started a bit earlier than most of us.”

Alexandre has a following. Millennials and Gen Z, they know who he is Brand strategist Michael Miraflor

In the potential battle for succession of the world’s largest luxury empire, Alexandre could be seen as an underdog. He’s younger and less experienced than his siblings Delphine and Antoine, and he doesn’t sit on LVMH’s board, which they joined at age 28 and 27.

But one luxury expert said that he would bet on Alexandre being the front-runner, with the next-most-likely heir being his younger brother, Frederic. Bernard’s choice will depend on whether he wants to replace himself with his “mirror image”, or a more extroverted version of himself, the luxury expert said.

“If he wants the future to be run by someone who’s a sort of lookalike in terms of personality, that’ll be Frederic,” he said. “If he wants to shake things up a bit and have someone who’s a bit bolder and a bit louder and a bit more visible, that’ll be Alexandre.”

Alexandre’s ability to sense what is culturally relevant makes him LVMH’s not-so-secret weapon, Miraflor said. And it doesn’t hurt that he’s traditionally handsome enough to make it on to lists like “hot heirs of fashion dynasties”.

“Alexandre has a following,” Miraflor said. “Millennials and Gen Z, they know who he is.”

Alexandre’s appointment at Tiffany, LVMH’s biggest ever purchase, may be the biggest sign that he has his father’s trust, but it’s not the only sign. Of all his children, Bernard chose Alexandre to accompany him to New York to meet then US president-elect Donald Trump in January, 2017. In 2019, Alexandre took over his father’s board seat at Carrefour, the French grocery market chain that’s the eighth-largest retailer in the world.

As for Alexandre’s own ambition, he may stay silent on the topic, and many others, but hints of his auspicious future were there all along. When Alexandre was six years old, he attended an event at a Paris museum with his mother.

“What does he want to do when he grows up?” Mercier-Arnault told a reporter from Le Figaro newspaper. “Sailor or big boss, like papa.”"
Phoebe Philo Comes Back to Fashion Launching Her Own Brand - WWD,"Mon, 12 Jul 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vd3dkLmNvbS9mZWF0dXJlL3Bob2ViZS1waGlsby1uZXctZmFzaGlvbi1icmFuZC1jb21lYmFjay1sdm1oLTEyMzQ4NTQyMDYv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Phoebe Philo is returning to fashion with an independent, namesake house — and with LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton as a minority investor.

The acclaimed British designer told WWD she would create clothing and accessories “rooted in exceptional quality and design,” and would divulge more details about her new brand in January 2022.

WWD broke the news in February 2020 that Philo had started planning a new collection and interviewing designers. According to market sources, she has had a small team working in London since late last year.

One of the most revered — and bankable — designers of her generation, Philo most recently engineered a spectacular brand rejuvenation during a 10-year tenure at Celine, one of about 75 brands controlled by LVMH. Season after season, she minted womanly, modernist clothing and distinctive handbags, accruing an intensely loyal fan base.

“Being in my studio and making once again has been both exciting and incredibly fulfilling,” Philo said in a brief statement. “I am very much looking forward to being back in touch with my audience and people everywhere. To be independent, to govern and experiment on my own terms is hugely significant to me.”

However, she has brought on a powerful silent partner in LVMH. The size of the French group’s minority stake could not immediately be learned, and financial terms were not disclosed.

It is understood Philo is the only other shareholder in the venture.

“I have had a very constructive and creative working relationship with LVMH for many years. So it is a natural progression for us to reconnect on this new project. I have greatly appreciated discussing new ideas with Bernard Arnault and Delphine Arnault and I am delighted to be embarking on this adventure with their support,” she added.

Bernard Arnault, chairman and chief executive officer of LVMH, called Philo “one of the most talented designers of our time.”

“We have known her and appreciated her for a long time. Phoebe contributed to the success of the group through her magnificent creations over several years,” he said. “With this in mind, I am very happy to partner with Phoebe on her entrepreneurial adventure and wish her great success.”

Given Philo’s cult-like following, her return to designing collections and launching a new brand is bound to have specialty retailers salivating — and some designers fretting. Many brands big and small have tried to seize her crown, and recruit her devotees, with varying degrees of success.

The designer has been keeping a low profile since exiting Celine at the end of 2017. In one of her first public projects, she signed on to be a juror for the 2021 ANDAM awards, which were presented in Paris earlier this month. (Philo did her duties via video conferencing from London due to ongoing travel restrictions related to the pandemic.)

It is unusual, though not unprecedented, for LVMH to back a new brand. Its core expertise lies in animating heritage brands like Louis Vuitton, Dior and Fendi with buzzy designers, celebrity ambassadors, retail razzmatazz and spectacular press and client events.

In 2019, it launched a fashion brand for Rihanna, following the blockbuster success of Fenty by Rihanna beauty products. The start-up came up against the coronavirus crisis and LVMH and the pop star paused the luxury maison last February, while roaring ahead with Savage x Fenty lingerie. Prior to that, LVMH famously set up a couture house for Christian Lacroix in 1987, and sold it to Falic Group in 2005.

Minority stakes are not usually the norm either for the French luxury giant, though that’s the case with Jonathan Anderson’s London-based fashion house JW Anderson, for example. LVMH took a 46 percent stake in 2013 in tandem with hiring the designer as creative director of Spanish leather goods house Loewe.

It is understood Philo has kept in close contact with the Arnault family, particularly Delphine, and will continue to have access to the group’s brain trust and real-estate muscle as she develops her indie venture.

The distribution plan and other details could not immediately be learned, though Philo had long shunned online commerce, preferring boutiques filled with marble plinths and large plants when she was at Celine. She also worked with prestigious specialty retailers, including Le Bon Marché, Selfridges and Dover Street Market

A graduate of London’s Central Saint Martins fashion school, Philo was classmates with Stella McCartney and worked with her when McCartney launched her own collection after graduation. Philo followed McCartney to Chloé in 1997 and took the top job in 2001 when McCartney left to set up her own fashion house in a joint venture with Gucci Group.

With her striking personal style, Philo succeeded in accelerating Chloé’s rejuvenation and catapulting it into the high-margin leather goods business. She became known for fashions that deftly blended masculine elements like trousers and such feminine fare as frilly blouses. During her tenure, Chloé’s look was widely emulated by fast-fashion chains and she created hit handbags like the Paddington and Silverado.

She resigned from Chloé in 2006 for personal reasons, citing a wish to spend more time with her young children.

Three years later, after lengthy discussions with LVMH about launching a namesake brand, Philo wound up at the helm of Céline, which offered an immediate platform for her designs, since the brand had boutiques in top locations around the world and factories for leather goods.

Philo debuted a more fashion-forward, minimalist aesthetic at Céline, tinged with artsy touches, and her collections exceeded all revenue expectations and won wide acclaim, despite her reticence about e-commerce and an arms-length policy with the press.

She was succeeded at Celine by Hedi Slimane, who dropped the accent in the label’s name and reoriented the brand toward retro-tinged, bourgeois French chic.

"LVMH Italia, Covivio Sign Pre-letting Agreement for Offices in Milan - WWD","Thu, 15 Jul 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3dkLmNvbS9mZWF0dXJlL2x2bWgtaXRhbGlhLW5ldy1vZmZpY2VzLWNvdml2aW8tc3ltYmlvc2lzLWZvbmRhemlvbmUtcHJhZGEtMTIzNDg4MjQ5NC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"MILAN — It looks like Prada is going to have new neighbors soon.

LVMH Italia has signed a pre-letting agreement with real estate company Covivio for a 10-year lease of offices in the Symbiosis business district, which is located next to Fondazione Prada in the southern part of Milan.

The deal is for offices and large terraces covering a total surface of 43,055 square feet across two floors in Building D of the Symbiosis multitenant complex. The building is slated to be completed by the end of the year and will host LVMH Italia’s headquarters and 170 employees starting in early 2022.

Financial details of the operation have not been disclosed.

With the addition of this new leasing deal, 72 percent of the building is pre-let. The structure will host the offices of other firms hailing from different industries, including leading pharmaceutical player Boehringer Ingelheim and several companies of the Mars-Royal Canin Italia group operating animal care services.

“We are very proud that another large international company such as LVMH has chosen Symbiosis, which is once again confirmed as an attractive, strategic business district for the entire city of Milan,” said Covivio Italy’s chief executive officer Alexei Dal Pastro, who also underscored that the goal of the real estate player is to “to support companies in rising to the challenge of redesigning the working experience of their employees.”

Designed by the architectural firm Antonio Citterio Patricia Viel, the Symbiosis business district revamped a 1.3 million-square-foot site, combining offices and co-working spaces with green areas, with a heightened attention on environmental performance through implementations aimed at reducing electricity consumption and minimizing maintenance costs.

Building D includes two structures covering a total surface of 193,750 square feet, additionally showcasing dining services and a 6,458-square-foot auditorium.

But Symbiosis is not the only project Covivio has implemented in the area. As reported, last year the company teamed up with real estate firm Coima SGR and Prada Holding SpA — which controls the Prada fashion group — to acquire the Scalo Porta Romana former railway yard with an offer of 180 million euros.

Also located next to Fondazione Prada, the strategic area covering 20 hectares — or almost 50 acres — is to undergo a major revamp that will potentially include a highline crossing the area from west to east.

Presented earlier this year, the winning master plan for the project will combine green areas, residential buildings, offices, social and student housing and community services, in addition to accommodations for the Olympic and Paralympic athletes competing in the 2026 Winter Olympic Games to be held in Milan and Cortina d’Ampezzo. After the Games, the village will be reconverted into social housing structures and accommodation for university students.

While mainly overseeing the re-qualification of a public park, Prada Holding will also establish a building housing laboratories and offices to extend its existing activities in this part of the city, which under its influence has been experiencing a significant relaunch.

The opening of Fondazione Prada in 2015 paved the way not only for real estate construction and co-working venues but also exhibition spaces, restaurants and music events, which helped rev up the district and draw locals and tourists in what was once known for being an industrial zone. The addition of LVMH Italia’s headquarters adds critical mass and might now encourage other fashion players to join the flux and head South, too.

LVMH Backs French Business School Campus for Entrepreneurs - WWD,"Fri, 09 Jul 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3dkLmNvbS9mZWF0dXJlL2x2bWgtZWRoZWMtZnJlbmNoLWJ1c2luZXNzLXNjaG9vbC1jYW1wdXMtZW50cmVwcmVuZXVycy0xMjM0ODc4NTAyL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS — LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton has partnered with business school EDHEC and a vocational training program headed by French First Lady Brigitte Macron to inaugurate a campus in the northern city of Roubaix aimed at promoting entrepreneurship.

Bernard Arnault, chairman and chief executive officer of LVMH, inaugurated the space, named after his father Jean Arnault, alongside Macron and Bruno de Pampelonne, chairman of EDHEC, in a ceremony Friday.

Located in the former offices of the construction company founded by Arnault’s grandfather, just a few hundred yards from EDHEC’s main site in Roubaix, it will be home to the school’s incubator for entrepreneurs, which will provide support to start-ups, with an emphasis on responsible practices.

The campus is expected to host some 250 students and entrepreneurs from fall 2021. It will also welcome the first local intake of L’Institut des Vocations pour l’Emploi (LIVE), which is chaired by Macron. Participants will follow a six-month program designed to help them articulate and pursue fresh career paths.

“The Jean Arnault Campus pays tribute to my father and to our entrepreneurial roots in Roubaix. This is where my grandfather and my father laid the foundations of what has become one of Europe’s most prominent groups,” Arnault said in a statement.

“With the creation of this campus in partnership with EDHEC and LIVE I want to honor the values of hard work, bold thinking and perseverance that have long motivated the entrepreneurial families of this region in northern France. I hope that the future generations who study here at the Jean Arnault Campus will find inspiration in our creative adventure to innovate and pursue their own entrepreneurial success,” he added.

The main building, designed by Jean Arnault in 1971, has been restored and modernized by Lille-based architect Frank Longueval.

“Today, Bernard Arnault entrusts us with a building steeped in history, enabling our students and future entrepreneurs to benefit from the best possible learning environment as they invent the business models and companies of tomorrow,” said Pampelonne.

“We look forward to addressing the many challenges of a world experiencing vast transformations as we strive to have a positive impact on society,” he added.

Abloh, who founded the brand, will retain 40 percent ownership in the company following the deal. The designer is set to keep his overarching creative director role for the brand, while New Guards Group who birthed Off-White™ with Abloh will still be the brand’s operating partner.

Reports stated that with a 60 percent stake, LVMH plans to work alongside Abloh to develop, create and grow new and existing brands that go beyond the fashion realm. With a partner like LVMH, Off-White™ will have a slew of tools readily available to help it expand its own brand portfolio. The French luxury conglomerate has an extensive and broad range of investments in fashion, cosmetics, jewellery, fragrances and even wines and spirits. The announcement does not affect Virgil Abloh’s role at Louis Vuitton, where he is currently still the artistic director of the menswear line.

"LVMH, Campari Partner In European Alcohol Market - PYMNTS.com","Tue, 13 Jul 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnB5bW50cy5jb20vbmV3cy9yZXRhaWwvMjAyMS9sdm1oLWNhbXBhcmktcGFydG5lci1pbi1ldXJvcGVhbi1vbmxpbmUtYWxjb2hvbC1tYXJrZXQv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Europe’s wine and spirits space is about to get a major new eCommerce player. Moët Hennessy, the wine and spirits division of luxury goods company LVMH, and spirits company Campari Group, the brand behind Campari as well as Aperol, SKYY vodka and Wild Turkey bourbon, among others, announced on Monday (July 12) that they are partnering to create an eCommerce platform in a 50/50 joint venture.

The platform will be led by Marco Magnocavallo, the current CEO of the wine and spirits eCommerce company Tannico, in which Campari holds a minority stake that it is contributing to the joint venture. The goal is to create a platform that will have a presence all across Europe.

“This partnership represents a significant step forward in our global eCommerce development strategy. While eCommerce was already a growing channel for wines and spirits, the global pandemic has triggered a significant acceleration,” Moët Hennessy President and CEO Philippe Schaus said in a statement.

Sure enough, PYMNTS research finds that almost half of all consumers purchased alcohol online more during the pandemic than before its start, and that the majority of these shoppers continue to maintain this behavior going forward. In the United States, the eCommerce wine and spirits sector already had a major sector, with Uber’s $1.1 billion acquisition of Drizly bringing same-day alcohol delivery into the mainstream. Now, this joint venture could play a similar role in Europe, disrupting the continent’s alcohol eCommerce market.

“With the joint backing of Moët Hennessy and Campari, Tannico will have the firepower to consolidate the fragmented European eCommerce sector and offer a qualitative, sizeable and integrated route to market option catering to the needs of all its wines and spirits suppliers,” Magnocavallo, CEO of Tannico, said in a statement.

This new eCommerce platform presents an opportunity for both wine and spirits companies to earn the spending of younger consumers who might not otherwise seek out luxury wine and spirits. PYMNTS research finds that the consumers ordering alcohol online most often, whether for delivery in the future or the same day, are millennials. Additionally, a significant portion of those ordering for delivery on a later date are Generation Z-ers, meaning that both wine and spirits companies have the opportunity to win the lifelong loyalty of young consumers who are new to the alcohol market.

Earlier this year, online wine marketplace Vivino raised $155 million, bringing its total funding to $221 million, to support its expansion in markets in the U.S., U.K., Germany, Portugal and Japan. And last November, digital delivery service Gopuff acquired eCommerce alcohol platform BevMo in a $350 million deal. Overall, one analysis found, online alcohol sales grew 33 percent in 2020, with France, one of the top contributors to this growth, seeing its market increase 43 percent by volume.

In 2020, LVMH’s organic revenue from its wine and spirits sales fell 14 percent. Meanwhile, in February, Campari CEO Bob Kunze-Concewitz stated that the company’s eCommerce mix grew 90 percent year over year in 2020. “Net in net, we’re adapting very well and very quickly to the new normal, particularly eCommerce, and will bear the benefits of that in the years to come,” he added.

LVMH Buys a Controlling Stake in Virgil Abloh’s Streetwear Brand Off-White - Robb Report,"Tue, 20 Jul 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vcm9iYnJlcG9ydC5jb20vc3R5bGUvZmFzaGlvbi92aXJnaWwtYWJsb2gtbHZtaC1tYWpvcml0eS1zdGFrZS1vZmYtd2hpdGUtMTIzNDYyNTUwNC_SAV9odHRwczovL3JvYmJyZXBvcnQuY29tL3N0eWxlL2Zhc2hpb24vdmlyZ2lsLWFibG9oLWx2bWgtbWFqb3JpdHktc3Rha2Utb2ZmLXdoaXRlLTEyMzQ2MjU1MDQvYW1wLw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LVMH and Virgil Abloh are ready to take their relationship to the next level.

The luxury conglomerate has just announced plans to acquire a 60 percent stake in Off-White, the streetwear brand the fashion designer founded in 2013. But don’t mistake this for a simple acquisition; it also means that Abloh’s sphere of influence at the world’s largest luxury conglomerate is expanding significantly.

As part of the deal, which is expected to be completed in the next 60 days, subject to regulatory approval, Abloh will retain a 40 percent stake in Off-White and remain its creative director, according to a press release. He will also continue as Men’s Artistic Director at Louis Vuitton, a role he has held since the spring of 2018.

The agreement has implications beyond LVMH’s acquisition of a buzzy label (even if it is its second major American acquisition of the last year). As Abloh told The New York Times, “I’m getting a seat at the table.” The designer now becomes the most powerful Black executive at the global conglomerate. LVMH said it plans to partner with the Abloh to launch new brands and collaborate with existing ones in a variety of sectors beyond fashion. In addition to renowned houses like Louis Vuitton, Fendi and Givenchy, LVMH also owns or has a controlling stake in a wide swath of luxury brands ranging from Dom Pérignon and Veuve Clicquot to Tiffany & Co. and Tag Heuer.

“I’m incredibly excited to work together with LVMH on other possible collaborations—an evolution of the great relationship I have had with LVMH, Bernard Arnault, Michael Burke at Louis Vuitton and others,” Abloh said in a statement. “I’m also honored to use this partnership to deepen my longstanding commitment to expand opportunities for diverse individuals and foster greater equity and inclusion in the industries we serve. This is an incredible new platform to take the disruption we’ve achieved together to a whole new level.”

WATCH

Only time will tell what that “new level” looks like, but one thing is certain: Abloh’s star isn’t done ascending."

Alexandre Arnault, 29, the second oldest son of LVMH chairman and CEO Bernard Arnault, wed Géraldine Guyot, founder of French accessories brand D’Estrëe, in Paris on Saturday.

The newlyweds, who announced their engagement at the start of the year, both shared photos of the intimate ceremony on social media, with Alexandre writing: 'It started in 1998 now it's oui pour vie [yes for life].'

Alexandre is the executive vice president of LVMH brand Tiffany & Co., having previously served as CEO of Rimowa. In May his father Bernard overtook Jeff Bezos to become the world's richest man after his net worth climbed to $186 billion.

Alexandre Arnault, 29, the second oldest son of LVMH chairman and CEO Bernard, wed Géraldine Guyot, founder of French accessories brand D’Estrëe, in Paris on Saturday

The newlyweds, who announced their engagement at the start of the year, both shared photos of the intimate ceremony on social media, with Alexandre writing: 'It started in 1998 now it's oui pour vie [yes for life]'

Following the trend of low-key, high society weddings, the couple chose to keep the day out of the spotlight.

Géraldine, who was named to Forbes' 30 Under 30 list for retail and e-commerce last year, looked elegant in a simple, vintage-inspired dress by JW Anderson featuring a high collar, long sleeves, puffed shoulders, and subtle floral embroidery.

The bride changed into a second number for the evening reception, with Alexandre sharing a photo of their romantic first dance on Instagram.

The couple have been dating since at least August 2019 and became engaged shortly before Christmas after a romantic proposal in Paris.

Bernard Arnault, who has five children from two marriages, has given senior LVMH roles to his four oldest children. Youngest son Jean is still a student.

Alexandre shared this touching caption alongside his wedding photos, saying it's 'yes for life'

Only daughter Delphine, 45, is director and executive vice president of Louis Vuitton; eldest son Antoine, 43, who married Russian supermodel Natalia Vodianova last year, is CEO of Berluti and oversees image, communications and the environment for LVMH; and third son Frédéric, 26, is CEO of Tag Heuer.

Alexandre trained as an engineer, graduating from France’s Ecole Telecom ParisTech and Ecole Polytechnique. He held jobs at McKinsey & Company and KKR before joining the family business with a position at Fendi.

He was appointed to Rimowa in 2017 after he played a crucial role in LVMH's decision to buy an 80 percent stake in the high-tech luggage maker for 640 million euros ($716 million), its first acquisition in Germany.

Alexandre also shared a snap of his wedding ring on his finger in the days after the wedding

Under Alexandre's four-year tenure, Rimowa paired up with sportwear brand Supreme for a collaboration and made a big social media push to draw in younger, trendier shoppers and influencers.

Analysts expect Tiffany & Co. will be given a makeover in a bid to do similar, as well as attract Asian customers.

Alexandre will work under Michael Burke, chairman and CEO at Louis Vuitton, the group's biggest money spinner, who will now also chair Tiffany & Co. Anthony Ledru, head of Louis Vuitton in the US, will take over as CEO of the jeweller.

For her part, Géraldine studied at Central Saint Martins in London before returning to Paris in 2015 to found D’ESTRËE, which creates 'high-end fashion accessories', including hats and jewellery.

Beyoncé is among her celebrity fans and the brand is sold at 100 retailers around the world.

According to Financial Times, the French luxury group will increase its shareholding to 60 percent, while Abloh will keep 40 percent.

In addition to the acquisition, Abloh’s role at LVMH has been expanded and will work across categories like wine and spirits, as well as hospitality. With this new deal, Abloh predicts that Off-White™ will be seen as a “truly multi-line luxury brand” and has shared that he plans on expanding his network of stores.

“I look for people with an immigrant mentality, who are strangers in an industry or strangers in a country, and they’re very hungry, they want to learn, want to be different inside an industry that requires new ideas all the time,” Louis Vuitton‘s chief executive Michael Burke commented on Abloh’s new role. “We are trying to disrupt a number of businesses [at LVMH], so we thought this is the right moment to take [our partnership with Virgil] to the next level.”

While LVMH will be in charge of Off-White™’s trademarks, Farfetch-owned New Guards Group will continue its licensing agreement with the label."

The decision fined Luxottica €125 million, referencing all Luxottica brands, including Chanel, Ray-Ban, Oakley, Prada, Burberry, Blugari, Dolce & Gabbana, Armani, Armani, Michael Kors, Miu Miu, Ralph Lauren. The authority also fined LVMH €500,000 for the Tag Heuer brand. Logo was also sanctioned, but not fined because the company has gone into liquidation. Chanel was fined €130,000.In its own statement yesterday, EssilorLuxottica acknowledged the FCA’s fine and stated that the fine “closes an investigation initiated in 2005 which was considered insufficient by the FCA in 2017.” EssilorLuxottica plans to challenge the fine.EssilorLuxottica said, “EssilorLuxottica firmly believes it has always conducted business according to the highest standard of compliance, always supporting customers, partners as well as the entire market. As such, the company strongly disagrees with the Authority’s decision and considers the sanction highly disproportionate and groundless. The company will appeal the decision, confident that it will successfully demonstrate that the decision is wrong both from a factual and a legal perspective.”The FCA's statement said that Luxottica provided retailers with recommended prices for its licensed brands between 2005 and 2014, and also prevented them from running discounts or promotions. In addition, the FCA stated that “opticians who persist in ignoring Luxottica's messages have seen retaliatory measures applied: delay or suspension of deliveries to their stores, withdrawal of the authorization necessary for the distribution of some of its brands or even blocking of accounts for them.”In regard to LVMH, the FCA said LVMH and Logo separately fixed prices for Tag Heuer-branded eyewear between 1999 and 2015. LVMH did not contest the allegations, so it received a lower fine, Yahoo News reported In its statement, the FCA said , “These practices, anticompetitive by their very object, are serious. In particular, they involved the implementation of surveillance and retaliatory mechanisms. They have, moreover, affected end consumers who are partly captive and vulnerable, the equipment in prescription glasses, such as, in certain cases, sunglasses, being a necessity.""They also caused a certain damage to the economy, insofar as they related to well-known brands, affected intra-brand competition (price competition for the same product within different networks) for a period of time, long term, and concerned a significant proportion of distributors, including major national brands such as Alain Afflelou, Krys, GrandVision or Optical Center.” Safilo Group was involved in the initial 2005 investigation, but was not fined yesterday. In a statement, Safilo Group said, “Safilo is pleased with the decision issued today by the French Competition Authority dismissing all the charges which had been raised against it and which Safilo has vigorously challenged with its internal and external legal team, led by François Brunet and Céline Verney of the law firm Hogan Lovells.”The full press release from the FCA is available online in both French and English here"

The conglomerate led by Bernard Arnault is preparing to open a new office in Milan, in the Porta Romana district, following the agreement with Convivio, the company that last November, together with Prada Holding, had taken over the space of the former Scalo di Porta Romana.

Convivio, an Italian-French group, is currently working on the development of various projects in an area close to that of the former railway, with the construction of the Symbios building. Within this facility, LVMH secured two office floors with large terraces, where 170 Italian employees are expected to move in early 2022. LVMH has reportedly signed a lease for at least the next ten years. Built by the ACPV-Antonio Citterio Patricia Viel architecture and design studio, Symbios expands for 18,000 square meters, includes catering spaces, and involves the construction of a 600 square meter auditorium. The offices, designed as flexible spaces, have been built with a green perspective and will host common areas for teamwork and to increase creativity and productivity.

The arrival of LMVH confirms the great growth and interest surrounding the Porta Romana district, reborn thanks to the creation of the Fondazione Prada, which also includes the construction of a High Line similar to that of New York, and where the 2026 Milan-Cortina Winter Olympics Village will be built."
"Waiting Lists at Louis Vuitton, Demand for Dior Helps LVMH Generate $33.9 Billion in First-Half Revenue - The Fashion Law","Mon, 26 Jul 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWZhc2hpb25sYXcuY29tL3dhaXQtbGlzdHMtYXQtbG91aXMtdnVpdHRvbi1kZW1hbmQtZm9yLWRpb3ItcHJvbXB0cy1yZWNvcmRzLWgxLXJlc3VsdHMtZm9yLWx2bWgv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Sales at LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton were up for the first half of the year, signaling a turnaround in the luxury goods segment following “severely disrupted” revenues as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. On Monday, the Paris-based luxury goods titan reported revenues of 28.7 billion euros ($33.9 billion) for the first half of 2021, which ended on June 30, up 56 percent compared to the same period in 2020, with such gains driven particularly by “accelerated growth” in the second quarter of 2021. LVMH revealed that the Fashion & Leather Goods division, which is its largest business group, achieved record levels of revenue with organic growth of 81 percent compared to 2020, and 38 percent compared to 2019, with sales in the U.S. and Asia “up sharply since the start of the year.”

Specifically addressing its Fashion & Leather Goods division, which generated 13.86 billion euros ($16.37 billion) in revenue for the half of the year, and 7.13 billion euros ($8.42 billion) during Q2, LVMH stated that its “largest brands” fared especially well. For instance, its marquee label Louis Vuitton “delivered a remarkable performance and maintained its profitability at an exceptional level,” noting that “due to the desirability of its iconic designs, purchases of many are subject to a waiting list.” The group says that it plans to “maintain strong creative momentum at Louis Vuitton, further extend product offer in all categories, [and] continue to deliver unique experiences across store network and digital universe.”

At the same time, the group stated that Christian Dior, another big player on its roster, had “an excellent first half with strong growth among local customers across all its product categories.” For the rest of the year, LVMH os looking to “pursue strong growth in all markets” for Dior. Elsewhere in the division, Hedi Slimane’s ready-to-wear and leather goods collections for Celine “were hugely successful,” while Fendi and Loewe joined the aforementioned brands in terms of performing well. Not listed among the names that LVMH said were doing particularly well in terms of “gaining market share across all geographies and achieving record levels of revenue and profitability”? The Matthew Williams-led Givenchy, for one, which “reached a key milestone with the arrival in stores of Williams’ first collection,” and Marc Jacobs. LVMH did, however, reveal that Jacobs “performed very well over the period.”

Finally, LVMH highlighted the “successful integration of Tiffany, which has performed extremely well since its acquisition” late last year. The New York-based brand, whose business was consolidated for the first time in the first half, “has benefited from the new team’s focus on its iconic products,” per LVMH, helping it to achieve “an excellent half-year,” driven by particularly strong momentum in Asia and the United States. “Tiffany will aim to maintain the pace of its growth in the second half of the year,” according to LVMH, drawing in particular on “an acceleration in China, and the launch of a new collection of gold jewelry, premiering in the U.S.”

Reflecting on Watches and Jewelry as a whole, LVMH stated that with the arrival of the prestigious Maison Tiffany, the division is entering “a new phase of its long-term development … as a major player in a highly promising business segment, with numerous strengths and a powerful appeal.”

In terms of revenues by business group, LVMH stated that the breakdown “changed appreciably” during the first half of the year, with “contributions of Watches and Jewelry, and Fashion and Leather Goods increasing by 7 points (entirely due to the consolidation of Tiffany) and 5 points, respectively, to 14 percent and 48 percent, while the contributions of Selective Retailing, Perfumes and Cosmetics, and Wines and Spirits decreased by 9 points, 2 points and 1 point, respectively, to 18 percent, 11 percent, and 9 percent.”

As for revenue by region, “the U.S. and Asia delivered an excellent performance” for the first half of the year, as brick-and-mortar stores have reopened en mass and vaccination campaigns have reached a significant amounts of the population. The Asia region excluding Japan accounted for 38 percent of revenue for the first half of the year, followed by the U.S., which represented 25 percent of the group’s revenues. LVMH CFO Jean Jacques Guiony stated in a corresponding conference call on Monday that demand in China, in particular, shows no sign of slowing across any of its divisions, as the Chinese market remains on track to become the biggest luxury market by 2025. Meanwhile, Europe and Japan “recorded more limited growth.”

Reflecting on the first half of the year and looking ahead, LVMH chairman and CEO Bernard Arnault stated that the conglomerate “has enjoyed an excellent half-year and is reaping the benefits of having continued to innovate and invest in its businesses throughout the pandemic despite being in the midst of a global crisis. The creativity, the high-quality and enduring nature of our products and the sense of responsibility that drives us, have been critical in enabling us to successfully withstand the effects of the pandemic.”

Finally, on the topic of future mergers and acquisitions, a particularly relevant one in light of the larger trend of consolidations in the upper echelon of the industry, in a call with analysts on Monday, Guiony stated that the group does not have anything big in the works right now. “We have to absorb Tiffany,” he said. “So, there is no large acquisition on the table.” It appears that LVMH is focusing for the time being on smaller-scale investments and acquisitions, such as the newly-announced minority stake that it is taking in former Celine creative director Phoebe Philo’s soon-to-launch eponymous label, and its headline-making 60 percent stake in Off-White, which was announced last week."

3 Mins Read

LVMH, the luxury fashion group behind Louis Vuitton and Christian Dior, wants to build a new facility dedicated to sustainability. Slated to open in late 2024, the new R&D centre will focus on new materials and digital solutions. But its main goal is “getting rid of plastics”.

LVMH says it’s now going to build a new R&D centre in France to develop sustainable luxury fashion solutions. The site will be located near Paris in Saclay, and will be open in late 2024 or mid-2025.

While plans are still being finalised, LVMH says the facility is going to be anything but small. It estimates that as many as 300 employees will be based in the centre.

“It will be a big facility,” Jean Baptiste Voisin, LVMH’s chief strategy officer told WWD. “We are [still] not sure of the exact size.”

Sustainability a priority

For LVMH, this latest project is going to be among the top of its priorities. Voisin said that the group’s chairman and CEO Bernard Arnaut is “fast-tracking” the facility and pushing ahead with recruitment.

In terms of what teams will be working on, the focus will mainly be on materials, biotechnology, and digital solutions. These target areas will seek to reduce the environmental footprint of products, from the manufacturing process to end-of-life.

Voisin explained that it would be “extremely product and solutions driven”. He added that “getting rid of plastics is at the core”.

Scientific approach

Researchers at LVMH’s Saclay hub will be taking a scientific approach when it comes to figuring out how to make luxury fashion more sustainable. They will evaluate the impact of novel materials, for instance, taking into account recycled content, emissions, and energy consumption.

That way, the company will be able to find which solutions are “really improving the full ecosystem,” said Voisin.

These solutions won’t just be applied to LVMH’s list of luxury fashion brands, among them Fendi and Marc Jacobs, but also the group’s beauty, cosmetics and jewellery labels. These include Guerlain, Bulgari, and Rihanna’s Fenty Beauty.

Conscious consumerism on the rise

The decision to invest in a brand new sustainability R&D facility is a sign that brands are no longer able to ignore the strong demand from consumers. While LVMH did not disclose the finances behind the project, WWD reported sources estimating a range from €30 million to €75 million.

Consumers, especially younger Gen Zs, are now prioritising value-led branding more than ever before. Latest polls show that shoppers are factoring in businesses’ social and environmental impact in their purchases.

It’s one of the reasons why fashion giants like LVMH are now doubling down on things like novel material innovation. Rival group Kering is also jumping on the trend, having backed the mushroom vegan leather startup Bolt Threads next to Stella McCartney and Adidas.

According to a recent analysis, the demand for more sustainable materials will see the “next-gen” material sector become a US$2.2 billion global market.

LVMH to acquire majority stake in Off-White - TFR,"Wed, 21 Jul 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vdGZyLm5ld3MvbmV3cy8yMDIxLzcvMjEvbHZtaC10by1hY3F1aXJlLW1ham9yaXR5LXN0YWtlLWluLW9mZi13aGl0ZdIBVmh0dHBzOi8vdGZyLm5ld3MvbmV3cy8yMDIxLzcvMjEvbHZtaC10by1hY3F1aXJlLW1ham9yaXR5LXN0YWtlLWluLW9mZi13aGl0ZT9mb3JtYXQ9YW1w?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LVMH on Tuesday (20 July) announced that it has agreed to purchase a 60% stake in Off-White. Off-White founder and CEO Virgil Abloh will retain a 40% ownership in the company as well as his position as the brand’s creative director. He will also stay on board as the artistic director of Louis Vuitton's menswear collection. New Guards Group, which established the label with Abloh in 2012, will also maintain its role as the brand’s operating partner.

As reported by BoF, under the deal, LVMH plans to work closely with Abloh to develop and launch new brands while ‘energising’ the existing ones. Abloh will be working across new categories other than fashion, including wine and spirits as well as hospitality. By partnering with LVMH, Off-White will have readily available tools to help the brand expand its portfolio. Details of the transaction have not been made public at the time of writing.

This acquisition came after Phoebe Philo announced that she will be launching her own luxury brand under LVMH, showing that the luxury conglomerate continues to innovate and grow by partnering with the big names in the fashion industry."
Virgil Abloh Got a Powerful New Gig - The Cut,"Tue, 20 Jul 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWN1dC5jb20vMjAyMS8wNy92aXJnaWwtYWJsb2gtZ290LWEtcG93ZXJmdWwtbmV3LWdpZy5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Photo: Getty Images

On Tuesday, the most powerful luxury-goods conglomerate in the world announced that it is giving a seat to one of the most prominent Black designers and executives in fashion. LVMH is becoming a majority investor in Off-White, the high-end streetwear brand founded by Virgil Abloh in 2013 in Milan.

As part of the agreement, LVMH is purchasing a majority stake of 60 percent in Off-White LLC, the trademark owner of Abloh’s Off-White brand. Milanese company New Guards Group, which is owned by Farfetch, will continue to operate the business since it owns the license for the brand. Meanwhile, Abloh will retain a 40 percent ownership and will also continue as creative director at Off-White, as well as at Louis Vuitton as artistic director of the French fashion house’s menswear collections.

Abloh’s relationship with LVMH stretches back to 2007, when he interned at Fendi. At the time, Kanye West hired Abloh as creative director to help launch some projects outside of music. He founded Off-White in 2012, and three years later became a finalist for the LVMH prize for young designers. In 2018, he was named menswear designer of Louis Vuitton.

Now, LVMH and Abloh are both agreeing to jointly pursue new projects. Bernard Arnault, chairman and CEO of LVMH, said that he’s looking forward to “working together with Virgil to bring his unique sensibility to a broader range of luxury categories” in a statement released Tuesday morning. And it makes sense that Abloh would be the guy to help with this venture, given his wide-ranging collaborations with brands including Nike, Mercedes-Benz, Ikea, Evian, Vitra, and Braun — just to name a few.

In the grand scheme of things, taking a majority stake in Off-White is just another day for LMVH. Last year, it bought Tiffany & Co.; last week, it announced it was taking a minority stake in Phoebe Philo’s new namesake label; and according to WWD, it has deepened its foothold in experiential luxury by opening hotels and restaurants around the world.

Abloh told the New York Times that “the partnership would be used to expand Off-White into categories like cosmetics and homewares, as well as to grow the leather-goods side of the business.” In a statement, he said, “For nearly a decade, we’ve been building Off-White to be a brand designed to empower our generation and challenge the status quo. LVMH brings to the table the additional firepower and scale to accelerate our momentum and evolve Off-White into a truly multi-line luxury brand.”

This is also a historic moment on the long, white history of the fashion industry. Abloh is a first-generation Ghanian American, making Off-White one of the rare LVMH properties that isn’t rooted in European heritage. The French conglomerate touts its commitments to DE&I but still has an entirely white board and executive committee; it paused Fenty, Rihanna’s luxury fashion label, last year. While this is a step in the right direction, it’s a reminder that large strides are still to be made."
"LVMH posts record first-half results, travel retail held back by limited recovery - The Moodie Davitt Report","Mon, 26 Jul 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vbW9vZGllZGF2aXR0cmVwb3J0LmNvbS9sdm1oLXBvc3RzLXJlY29yZC1maXJzdC1oYWxmLXJlc3VsdHMtdHJhdmVsLXJldGFpbC1oZWxkLWJhY2stYnktbGltaXRlZC1yZWNvdmVyeS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"FRANCE/INTERNATIONAL. Luxury goods group LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton today reported revenue of €28.7 billion in the first half of 2021, up by +56% compared to the same period in 2020. Profit from recurring operations was €7,632 million for the half, up by +44% compared to the first half of 2019 and more than four times higher than in the same period in 2020.

Organic revenue growth was up +53% compared to 2020 and +11% compared to the same period in 2019. The performance reflected accelerated growth in Q2, which saw organic revenue increase by +14% compared to +8% in the first quarter.

The company said that the half marked “a return to strong growth momentum after a severely disrupted year in 2020 resulting from the global pandemic”.

The Selective Retailing division, which includes DFS – the company jointly held by LVMH and Robert Miller (the company’s Co-Founder) – along with Sephora and Starboard Cruise Services, reported a +12% rise in organic revenue year-on-year, but the figure was down -25% compared to 2019.

LVMH said: “DFS continued to be impacted by the lack of recovery in international travel to most destinations. Following an ambitious renovation programme, faithful to the history of this flagship store and maintaining high environmental standards, the reopening of La Samaritaine on June 23 was an historic success.” [A special report on the opening of La Samaritaine will follow soon; see below].

Highlights of the period included surging growth for the Fashion & Leathergoods division, which reported organic revenue growth of +81% in the first half compared to the same period in 2020. Organic revenue growth compared to the first half of 2019 was +38%. Profit from recurring operations was up +74% compared to the first half of 2019 and represents more than three times that of 2020.

Louis Vuitton delivered a “remarkable performance” and maintained its profitability at an “exceptional level”. Christian Dior, Celine, Fendi, Marc Jacobs and Loewe also performed well.

The Wines & Spirits business group recorded organic revenue growth of +44% year-on-year, while profit from recurring operations was up +20%. Champagne volumes rose +10% compared to the first half of 2019, driven by momentum in Europe and the US. Hennessy Cognac volumes increased by +6% compared to 2019, limited by supply constraints. China, which was the first market to have been impacted by the pandemic in early 2020, experienced a strong rebound in the first half while demand in the US held up well.

The Perfumes & Cosmetics business group recorded organic revenue growth of +37% year-on-year in the first half. Organic revenue was down -3% compared to the first half of 2019. Profit from recurring operations was up +1% compared to the first half of 2019.

The group noted that its major brands “maintained a policy of selective distribution, unlike many competitors who have increased their proportion of discounted sales or sales in parallel networks, as a means of supporting their revenues”.

LVMH said its beauty brands are benefiting from online sales, partially offsetting the impact of the suspension of international travel. Parfums Christian Dior enjoyed “a strong acceleration” in its business with local customers, extending the recovery that began at the end of 2020. Guerlain showed “very positive momentum, driven by skincare”. Parfums Givenchy has gained market share while Fresh confirmed its presence in ultra-premium skincare, noted LVMH. Maison Francis Kurkdjian continues to post “remarkable growth”, added the company.

The Watches & Jewelry business group recorded organic revenue growth of +71% in the first half and +5% compared to the same period in 2019 (excluding Tiffany). Profit from recurring operations was up +122% compared to the first half of 2019 and +27% excluding the effect of the integration of Tiffany. The first half saw the integration of Tiffany, while Bvlgari saw “good growth in jewellery”.

Group Chairman and CEO Bernard Arnault said: “LVMH has enjoyed an excellent half-year and is reaping the benefits of having continued to innovate and invest in its businesses throughout the pandemic despite being in the midst of a global crisis. The creativity, the high-quality and enduring nature of our products and the sense of responsibility that drives us, have been critical in enabling us to successfully withstand the effects of the pandemic; they will remain firmly embedded in all our Maisons, thereby ensuring their continued desirability.

“Highlights from the first half include the integration of the Maison Tiffany and the inauguration of La Samaritaine after an ambitious renovation programme. Within the current context, as we emerge from the health crisis and see a recovery in the global economy, I believe that LVMH is in an excellent position to continue to grow and further strengthen our lead in the global luxury market in 2021. As France is the principal recruitment area and the country of origin of many of our products, the growth of LVMH benefits the country today, and even more tomorrow, with all our Maisons being proud to make their contributions.”

LVMH Buys Majority Stake In Virgil Abloh's OFF-WHITE - Bossip,"Tue, 20 Jul 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiggFodHRwczovL2Jvc3NpcC5jb20vMjAzMjQxMS9tby1tb25leS1sdm1oLWJ1eXMtbWFqb3JpdHktc3Rha2UtaW4tdmlyZ2lsLWFibG9ocy1vZmYtd2hpdGUtd2lsbC1leHBhbmQtaGlzLXJvbGUtYmV5b25kLWxvdWlzLXZ1aXR0b24v0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Bossip Video

Virgil Abloh levels up yet again with LVMH expanding his role in the fashion house and buying a majority stake in his brand, OFF-WHITE.

Virgil Abloh has been shaking up the fashion world from the second he printed his first custom t-shirt. Virgil, who started out under the wing of Kanye West, has proven that design is his thing and no matter the project, he can bring a fresh touch to anything while remaining simple.

When he branched out and turned his first line, Pyrex, into OFF-WHITE, he immediately had streetwear in a chokehold. He would go on to make history, becoming the first black designer for Louis Vuitton when he was hired to oversee menswear. Virgil had broken down doors that many thought would remain closed forever, no matter how much it seemed the world was changing.

Now, according to The Wall Street Journal, Virgil and LVHM are expanding their partnership to make even more history and give Virgil a seat at the table.

PARIS—LVMH Möet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE is taking a 60% stake in Off-White, the brand founded by American designer Virgil Abloh, deepening the French conglomerate’s ties to a leading proponent of hip hop and streetwear in luxury fashion. Mr. Abloh, 40 years old, is already the creative director of menswear for Louis Vuitton, LVMH’s core brand and the world’s top-selling luxury fashion label. In addition to taking the stake in Off-White, LVMH said it and Mr. Abloh would collaborate on other products beyond luxury fashion. The partnership comes as the luxury industry embraces prominent Black artists, designers and hip-hop stars, seeking the cultural clout that can draw younger shoppers to their brands. Mr. Abloh is perhaps the most prominent Black executive in luxury fashion.

The partnership is very promising for both sides as we will see Virgil’s take on other LVMH brands and properties. We had a small glimpse into what could be when Virgil designed a bottle for Moët & Chandon, which simply stated “DO NOT DROP” down the side of the bottle. This partnership is the first of its kind and makes Virgil one–of if not the–highest-ranking Black members of fashion."

Virgil Abloh will remain the owner of the remaining 40% while the New Guards Group will remain in the role of operating partner and licensee while the role of Virgil Abloh will expand beyond the creative direction and the only Fashion division of the group, to include the launch of new brands and partnerships through all the various activities of LVMH that include 75 different brands including luxury wine and liquors, perfumes and cosmetics, watchmaking and jewellery, luxury retail but also activities such as the Belmond and Cheval Blanc hotels, the yachts of Royal Van Lent Shipyard and even the Milanese pastry shop Cova.

Abloh has already proven to be much more than just a cross-sectoral designer: his recent collaborations have in fact included very different brands such as Nike, Mercedes-Benz, Evian, Ikea, Vitra and Braun, to name a few, and have been received with great success. It is natural that the LVMH group, known for its policy of cultivating its talents internally and then using them in the most strategic moments and sectors, has decided to enter into this agreement with the designer to enhance its commercial categories outside of fashion and bring the lucky ""branding"" of Abloh even beyond pure fashion or design. Bernard Arnault explained:

We look forward to supporting Virgil and the team both in driving the growth of Off-White and in working together with Virgil to bring his unique sensibility to a broader range of luxury categories.

After overcoming the pandemic with positive results, LVMH group shares rose 28% in the first quarter of the year while data for the second quarter will be published at the end of this week. With the partnership, the group wants to take advantage of the momentum gained in recent months – also opening up to agreements with unconventional terms like this, as Michael Burke, CEO of Louis Vuitton, who had met Abloh at the time of his internship at Fendi, pointed out:"

Abloh will retain the other 40 percent, while the Farfetch-owned New Guards Group will continue operation through an existing licensing deal set to last until at least 2026.

Abloh’s titles will remain the same: artistic director for Louis Vuitton’s menswear and creative director for the brand he founded in 2013. LVMH says it will also work with Abloh to launch new brands and partner with existing ones “beyond the realm of fashion.”

“For nearly a decade, we’ve been building Off-White to be a brand designed to empower our generation and challenge the status quo,” Abloh said in a press release. “LVMH brings to the table the additional firepower and scale to accelerate our momentum and evolve Off-White into a truly multi-line luxury brand.”

What was the payday? — Financial terms were not announced for the deal, but New Guards Group was previously acquired by Farfetch for $675 million in 2019. The group’s roster of brands includes Palm Angels, Marcelo Burton County of Milan, Heron Preston, Ambush, and Opening Ceremony — but it only licenses the trademark for Off-White.

LVMH acquired its majority stake from Off-White LLC, the previous owner of Off-White’s trademark. Now, Off-White joins the standard cabal of conglomerates that presides over the majority of luxury fashion. LVMH, Kering, Richemont dominate the space — and the clearest path forward for success is to be acquired by one of them. Consolidation has become the norm in recent decades, with Chanel, Hermès, and Rolex remaining as the few top brands to remain independent.

Off-White, with Abloh’s origins in architecture instead of fashion, has indeed challenged the status quo in what the world’s top brands look like — but its acquisition shows that joining the rank-and-file conglomerates is still the best bet for the future."

In a statement on Monday, the two groups said Campari would transfer its stake in online wines and spirits company Tannico into a newly set up joint venture.

The deal, subject to regulatory clearance, envisages the sale of half the JV's equity capital by Campari to Moët Hennessy for 25.6 million euros ($30 million) in cash, they said.

""While e-commerce was already a growing channel for wines and spirits, the global pandemic has triggered a significant acceleration,"" Moët Hennessy CEO Philippe Schaus said.

The new venture will be headed by current Tannico CEO Marco Magnocavallo who will remain a key minority shareholder in the business.

Tannico, whose business is 90% B2C, also owns a majority stake in Ventealapropriete.com, an e-commerce platform selling premium wines and spirits in France.

Tannico and Ventealapropriete.com generated pro-forma combined sales of more than 70 million euros last year.

"In the Wake of that Headline-Making Legal Scuffle, Tiffany & Co. is Performing ""Extremely Well"" for LVMH - The Fashion Law","Tue, 27 Jul 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWZhc2hpb25sYXcuY29tL2luLXRoZS13YWtlLW9mLWEtaGVhZGxpbmUtbWFraW5nLWxlZ2FsLXNjdWZmbGUtdGlmZmFueS1jby1pcy1wZXJmb3JtaW5nLWV4dHJlbWVseS13ZWxsLWZvci1sdm1oL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"When LVMH reported its first-half results on Monday, it revealed that Tiffany & Co. is faring well as the newest name under its ownership umbrella. The New York-based jewelry stalwart generated revenue of 1.9 billion euros ($2.25 billion), an increase from pre-pandemic levels in 2019, and saw a boost in margins and profits, as well. In other words, “Tiffany appears to be off to a good start,” Reuters’ Lisa Jucca asserted on Tuesday, noting that Tiffany’s success makes LVMH chairman and CEO Bernard Arnault’s quest to fight the original terms of his deal to acquire the famed jewelry company “look all the more contrived,” while also serving as “a reminder of his financial ruthlessness when pursuing targets.”

Tiffany & Co.’s latest results follow from a strong third quarter for the brand that spoke “volumes about the enduring strength of the Tiffany brand,” former Chief Executive Officer Alessandro Bogliolo said in a statement at the time, and Q4 revenues that grew by 3 percent on a year-over-year basis, raising questions (for me at least) about the merit of the arguments behind LVMH’s attempt to pull out of its $16 billion-plus deal to acquire Tiffany & Co., namely, its arguments that the jewelry company’s management and its Board of Directors mishandled the company in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic and that Tiffany’s business was thoroughly “devastated” as a result.

LVMH’s September 2020 attempt to back out of the $16.2 billion deal that it reached with Tiffany in November 2019 swiftly prompted Tiffany to file suit, with the jeweler seeking an order from a Delaware Chancery Court judge requiring LVMH to “abide by its contractual obligation under the merger agreement to complete the transaction on the agreed terms.” LVMH responded by threatening – and then filing – litigation of its own on the grounds that its board “had the opportunity to examine the current economic situation of Tiffany and its management of the crisis,” and found that “the first half results and its perspectives for 2020 are very disappointing, and significantly inferior to those of comparable LVMH Group [brands] during this period.”

The Arnault-run conglomerate further asserted that Tiffany had failed to “follow an ordinary course of business, notably in distributing substantial dividends when the company was loss making,” while also claiming that “the operation and organization of [Tiffany] are not substantially intact,” thereby, invoking the Material Adverse Effect (“MAE”) clause in the parties’ merger agreement, which they signed-off on in November 2019, ahead of the onset of COVID.

In the complaint that it did eventually file (and then ultimately settle), LVMH argued, among other things, that Tiffany “hemorrhaged cash for the first time in a quarter century, with no end to its problems in sight,” and asserted that “Tiffany’s performance will continue to be poor,” at least in part because its “retail strategy” is “particularly ill-suited for the challenges ahead” and will “have a significant long-term detrimental impact on the company.” With that in mind, and given “the decision by two sophisticated parties, represented by sophisticated advisers, to omit a pandemic carve,” LVMH stated the pandemic has, in fact, “caused an MAE that allows LVMH to terminate.”

From the outset, Tiffany characterized LVMH’s MAE allegations as lacking in “factual, contractual or legal support,” and argued that “nothing alleged by LVMH has come close to meeting the MAE definition in the merger agreement, which excludes all ‘changes or conditions generally affecting the industries in which [Tiffany] operate[s]’ and ‘general economic or political conditions.’”

While LVMH did, in fact, get Tiffany & Co. for a lower price than the parties initially agreed to ($131.50 per share instead of the original $135 per share), the settlement was not entirely one-sided. A close read suggests that the renegotiated price was not necessarily the result of MAE-esque financial turmoil on the part of Tiffany that made it an outlier compared to other industry players in the wake of COVID. In reality, it was a trade off, with Tiffany getting “real value” in exchange for that 2 percent, Brian JM Quinn, a professor at Boston College Law School, told TFL at the time. “The deal that Tiffany got for giving up 2 percent basically included no walkaway rights for LVMH.” Tiffany’s executives “basically said, ‘Sure, we will give you 2 percent off, but if we have to go back to the Chancery Court to try to enforce this deal, the price that will be used by the court for determining damages is not $131.50 but $135, the original price.”

Put another way, if the deal did not get done, Tiffany would, nonetheless, have gotten “full price” for it.

An underreported term that was added to the amended merger agreement, set this out, stating that “in the event that [Tiffany] brings any claim, litigation, or other similar proceeding to enforce the terms of the amended merger agreement or for money damages, the ‘Per Share Merger Consideration’ will be deemed, for all purposes in such proceeding, including any award of specific performance or damages, to be $135.00 in cash … as was in the original merger agreement.”

Beyond that, Tiffany also benefitted from the removal of two conditions that were previously included in the original merger agreement: one that conditions the closing of the deal on “the absence of a law or order in effect that enjoins, prevents or otherwise prohibits the consummation of the merger issued by a governmental entity,” such as if the French government had sent LVMH another letter formally requesting that it delay the deal, and another that mandated that the deal could not close if there is a material adverse effect in play.

As the amended merger agreement removed those “conditions to the consummation of the merger,” thereby, giving LVMH far less room to potentially wriggle out of the deal.

These new terms were hardly unimportant, according to Quinn, who said that they took away “all the conditionality” and gave Tiffany “a lot of certainty” in connection with the newly-fashioned deal, which is valuable in dealmaking, especially given the history between the parties to this transaction. At the same time, the language of the amended merger gave Tiffany “the ability to jam Arnault if [he] tries to go back” on the deal for a second time.

While such terms never came into play, Jucca notes that the clash paired with the recently-released Tiffany results, nonetheless, mean that any other luxury brands that end up on the opposite side of a deal with Arnault and his luxury goods empire in furtherance of the larger consolidation trend “will be all the more determined to make sure he pays up.”

In its release on Monday, LVMH touted the “successful integration of Tiffany,” which it says “has performed extremely well since its acquisition.” The brand is currently in the midst of a major marketing overhaul under the watch of product and communications EVP Alexandre Arnault, as well as a new focus on “its iconic products.” LVMH revealed on Monday that “Tiffany will aim to maintain the pace of its growth in the second half of the year,” drawing in particular on “an acceleration in China, and the launch of a new collection of gold jewelry, premiering in the U.S.”"

The sale doesn’t come as much of a surprise to fans because Abloh is already the creative director for Louis Vuitton. Abloh has already achieved icon status because his Ghananian heritage makes him one of the most prominent African-American designers in the luxury fashion industry. In a feature in The New York Times, Vanessa Friedman pointed out his success this isn’t just a big deal economically but also of major cultural significance as this deal makes Abloh, “the most powerful Black executive at the most powerful luxury goods group in the world.”

The French luxury conglomerate LVMH Möet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE has survived the economic recession due to COVID-19 much better than other luxury companies due to the brand’s diversified portfolio. While other brands have been scaling back, the company’s stock has rallied 55% in the past year and as of January 2021, they acquired the mega-brand jewelry Tiffany & Co. This newest purchase is estimated to have put the second-richest man in the world, Bernard Arnault, back quite a few million with Off-White’s estimated net worth to be around $170 million USD.

This acquisition is exciting as Mr. Abloh has almost single-handedly transformed streetwear into high fashion. In 2013, Off-White was launched in Milan serving sneakers, hats, oversized jackets, and baggy pants on the runway. Shocking those used only to seeing couture and gowns gracing the runways of Europe it is safe to say that Off-White is now a staple in the fashion world. All of the details of this acquisition have not been released but we do know that Virgil Abloh will remain in his current role at the creative helm of Off-White and maintain a 40% share of his brand."
Britain’s Phoebe Philo reveals own-brand fashion comeback - The Guardian,"Mon, 12 Jul 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9mYXNoaW9uLzIwMjEvanVsLzEyL3Bob2ViZS1waGlsby1mYXNoaW9uLWNvbWViYWNrLW93bi1icmFuZC1sdm1oLWJhY2tlctIBY2h0dHBzOi8vYW1wLnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9mYXNoaW9uLzIwMjEvanVsLzEyL3Bob2ViZS1waGlsby1mYXNoaW9uLWNvbWViYWNrLW93bi1icmFuZC1sdm1oLWJhY2tlcg?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Phoebe Philo, the British designer who became a cult hero in fashion for her intelligent and grown-up womenswear at the French fashion house of Céline, is to return to the industry with a new label next year.



After a three-year absence, Philo released a statement announcing that her first eponymous brand will sell “clothing and accessories rooted in exceptional quality and design”.

The designer said she was “very much looking forward to being back in touch with my audience and people everywhere”. The luxury giant LVMH is Philo’s financial backer, but holds a minority stake, an arrangement which Philo flagged in her statement, saying that “to be independent, to govern and experiment on my own terms is hugely significant to me”. It is thought the brand will be based in London, where Philo lives with her family.



Sixty years after Christian Dior revolutionised how women dressed with his New Look, Phoebe Philo did the same with the Female Gaze. Her upmarket but understated Céline collections appealed to women who cared about design but did not see themselves as decorative.

She pioneered the casting of older models in her shows and hired Joan Didion to star in an advertising campaign. Like every great fashion designer, she had an uncanny knack of tapping into emotion with her clothes.

Her oversized polo necks, long hemlines, louche silk shirts and quirky shoes seemed to characterise a new era of women dressing for themselves, instead of to comply with a vision of femininity rooted in patriarchal values. Seasonal trends were largely ignored in favour of a coherent, timeless wardrobe, and the long, loose silhouette Philo put on her Paris fashion week catwalks came to reverberate around high street shop floors all over the world.



Her departure from Céline was greeted by her fashion devotees as the loss of a spiritual leader – a fervour which was underscored when her successor, Hedi Slimane, unveiled a new vision for the house which riffed on retro codes of bourgeois French femininity. Her name has been linked with every major vacancy in fashion of recent years, including the Chanel job in the wake of Karl Lagerfeld’s death.



Given the buzz around Philo’s new venture, at a moment when the fashion industry is searching for a post-pandemic identity, her partnership with LVMH is a coup for the luxury giant.

Bernard Arnault, LVMH chairman and CEO, said: “Phoebe Philo is one of the most talented designers of our time … I am very happy to partner with Phoebe on her entrepreneurial adventure.”"
The most expensive (and glittering) feud in history - The New European,"Tue, 27 Jul 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZW5ld2V1cm9wZWFuLmNvLnVrL3RoZS1tb3N0LWV4cGVuc2l2ZS1hbmQtZ2xpdHRlcmluZy1mZXVkLWluLWhpc3Rvcnkv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"François Pinault (the businessman behind Gucci, Christie’s and Yves Saint Laurent) has given himself the luxury of a public victory in his 22-year long private war with Bernard Arnault (Louis Vuitton, Christian Dior, Bulgari, Givenchy and scores of others).

It all began with a fight over handbags, but the glittering feud between France’s richest men has now entered a spectacular new phase.

This summer, Pinault, 85, opened a home for his art collection in an exquisitely restored 18th century building in the heart of Paris – giving the French capital a modest equivalent to the Frick Collection in New York or the Getty Museum in Los Angeles.

The two men, once friends, fell out in 1999 in a battle for the ownership of the Italian leather goods company Gucci. They pursued their multi-billion pounds in recent years by competing to build collections of the best contemporary artists, from Jeffs Koons to Damien Hurst to Mark Rothko.

The rivalry has now escalated from works of art to private art galleries. Arnault, creator of Louis Vuitton Moët Hennessy (LVMH), the world’s largest luxury goods empire, outflanked Pinault in 2014 by opening his own “foundation” in the Bois de Boulogne on the western fringes of Paris.

Pinault was furious. He had long dreamed of having a gallery in the capital to show off his collection of contemporary art – said to include more than 10,000 works by 380 artists.

In 2005 he abandoned an attempt to build a private museum on the Ile Seguin, an island in the river Seine just outside the French capital once entirely occupied by a Renault car factory. He complained at the time that the French art establishment detested any challenge to the state and municipal domination of the museum industry.

The Breton billionaire, who turned a small timber business into the world’s second-biggest luxury goods conglomerate, was obliged to console himself with two private Pinault galleries in Venice.

No longer. François Pinault (a football fan and owner of his home-region club Ligue 1 club Stade Rennais) has not only scored the equaliser in his contest with Arnault. He has taken the lead.

He has invested 108m euros on the restoration of a beautiful but long-neglected, late 18th century circular building close to the Louvre and the Centre Pompidou in the centre of Paris. The Bourse du Commerce, once the place where French wheat and barley were traded, has been turned by the Japanese architect Tadao Ando into ten flexible light-drenched spaces for displaying art – 6,800 square metres in all.

The inaugural exhibition contains the work of 32 different artists from Pinault’s collection, including 30 works by the African-American artist, David Hammons.

The centre-piece is a giant candle – a wax reproduction by the Swiss artist Urs Fischer of a 16th century statue of the capture of the Sabine women. The “candle-statue” will burn to nothing in the coming weeks. Since Pinault is the owner of Christie’s auction house and one of the world’s most prolific art buyers, this is a surprising and subtle commentary on the permanence and value of art.

The seven-year-old Louis Vuitton foundation in the Bois de Boulogne is double the size of the new Pinault museum – 13,500 square metres. It is a work of art in itself, a “deconstructionist” tangle of a dozen glass domes by the Canadian architect Frank Gehry.

The foundation has been a reasonable success. It is, however, far from the centre of Paris and not easily reached by public transport. Louis Vuitton provides a free shuttle of tiny electric buses to carry visitors from a private bus stop near the Arc de Triomphe.

The new Pinault exhibition space is a short stroll from the Louvre, Les Halles, Notre Dame and the Marais. Location, location, location. When tourists return to Paris post-Covid, the Pinault exhibition will almost certainly overshadow Arnault’s foundation out in the woods.

Officially, the feud between two of France’s richest men (and the world’s 2nd and 32nd richest) ended more than a decade ago. Nicolas Sarkozy, when president, brokered a lunch meeting between the pair in 2009.

When the Louis Vuitton foundation opened, Pinault was given an advance private viewing. He returned the favour last month by inviting Arnault to preview his resurrected Bourse de Commerce.

Were these friendly invitations or acts of passive-aggressive one-upmanship between hyper-wealthy ex-friends? “Would you like to take my new custom-made sports car for a spin? Would you like to visit my personal art gallery?”

The men have similar life stories but very different personalities. Arnault is an urbane socialite and talented pianist. Pinault is reclusive, speaks with a rural Breton accent – but has a genuine and voracious knowledge of contemporary art.

Both men are provincials from outside the established French tribes of old wealth and influence, Pinault from the south-eastern corner of Brittany, Arnault from Roubaix on the Belgian border. Both turned deeply unglamorous family businesses – road repairs in the case of Arnault; timber-trading and farming in the case of Pinault – into luxury goods empires.

Both stumbled into the luxury business almost by accident. Arnault bought the Christian Dior brand as part of a fire sale of a struggling French textile giant in 1984 when he was 35. He controversially closed down or sold off the textile-making parts of the business and used Dior as the first building block in a luxury empire which now employs more than 120,000 people around the world, including 22,000 in France.

In the Forbes ‘real time’ global rich list, Arnault and family come second to Jeff Bezos of Amazon with an estimated fortune of $187.5bn. So much for France being an unenterprising country where it is impossible to grow rich.

Pinault is from an even more modest background. Arnault went to the Polytechnique engineering school, one of the breeding grounds of the French elite. Pinault left school at 16 to work in his father’s wood business.

He married ten years later into another much bigger wood company which he turned into one of the powerful in Europe before moving into retail and mail order (Printemps, Conforama, FNAC).

In the Forbes list, Pinault and family come 32nd with a fortune of $59bn, half that of Arnault. In France, he is usually third, just after Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers and family, owners of the cosmetics giant, L’Oréal.

The two billionaires were once friends and attended each others’ children’s weddings. They even lived in the same building in Paris.

That all changed in March 1999 when leading figures in Gucci, including its American designer Tom Ford, grew suspicious of the large, minority shareholding which had been acquired by Arnault and LVMH.

They increased Gucci’s capital and invited Pinault to buy up all the new shares, diluting Arnault’s holdings but also those of other shareholders. A two-year legal battle followed, settled in court, but Gucci remained under Pinault’s control.

He used the Italian-based company as the foundation of a new luxury conglomerate called Kering to rival LVMH. The pursuit of luxury brands by rival Arnault and Pinault empires in the last two decades is said to have pushed up the asking price of their targets by hundreds of millions of euros.

Something similar has happened in the art market. Pinault and Arnaud are far from the only super-wealthy collectors but their public rivalry has increased the price of works by artists like Koons, Hirst, Takachi Murakami, Subodh Gupta, Maurizio Cattelan and Richard Serra.

Art experts compare their competition to the inflationary bidding war for art in the 1960s between the Greek shipping billionaires Aristotle Onassis and Stavros Niarchos.

Opinions on Pinault’s motives as an art buyer differ. Despite his age and reclusive habits, he flies around the globe to visit artists and bombard them with well-informed questions. He also sells at a profit when the time is right. He bought Robert Rauschenberg’s celebrated painting Rebus in 1992 for $8m and sold it to the New York Museum of Modern Art for $30m in 2005.

“He is a hunter,” says the art expert Marc Blondeau, a frequent Pinault adviser. “Building up a mausoleum collection has no interest for him.”

Arnault, by comparison, is said to follow the opinions of his advisers. His collection is mostly the property of LVMH. It is often used to promote the image of the company and its individual brands.

What next in the war of the French billionaires? Pinault has seized the initiative. The clock is ticking on Arnault’s riposte.

Maybe the expensive candle burning in Pinault’s Bourse du Commerce is meant as a joke on his rival."

Mom and dad Bieber?!

Justin Bieber’s latest Instagram caption has us all thinking the same thing: is a baby Bieber on the way? With the singer’s world tour lined up and his supermodel wife Hailey’s career equally in full swing, a baby might seem unlikely—though his “mom and dad” caption has the world guessing! Nonetheless, Hailey took to the comments section to clarify. “I think u should maybe change this caption to *Dog Mom and Dad* before anyone gets it twisted,” she wrote. While exciting, the pregnancy rumors for the Bieber clan are nothing new, as Bieber posted a photo of his wife and a faux baby scan in 2019 as an April Fools prank.

Dior is sprucing up Fifth Ave. with a temporary pop-up…

And a two-story 6,480 square-foot one at that! Dior has opened up a new Paris-inspired space on 59th Street, where it will remain for two years. The space mimics similar elements on display in Dior’s Champs-Élysées Paris flagship, featuring its signature Cannage pattern imprinted on a high dome ceiling, backlit-panel displays, and regal upholstered furniture. While the house’s current Midtown Manhattan location on 57th Street undergoes renovations, the new boutique will offer the same ABCDior monogramming services, as well as a selection of women’s and men’s ready to wear, leather goods, footwear, accessories, and fine jewelry. The store’s most sought-after offering, though, is Dior’s Fall 2021 collection, which exclusively hit the Fifth Avenue racks yesterday. Though it just opened, the location already has a jam-packed calendar—citing pop-ups, exclusive capsule drops, and a celebration of the forthcoming “Christian Dior: Designer of Dreams” exhibit, which is scheduled to open at the Brooklyn Museum on September 10, in its near future.

Victoria’s Secret has tapped singer-songwriter Madison Beer to front its latest fragrance campaign. For the fragrance—dubbed Tease Crème Cloud—Beer is lensed by photographer Mario Sorrenti while posing in an angelic, ruffle-adorned frock. The location? Cloud nine! The campaign not only marks Beer’s latest venture into the beauty industry, but nods to her own brand—specifically, her recently released “Reckless” single and music video, which also appeared to be filmed in the clouds. Retailing from $58 to $78, the fragrance features notes of vanilla meringue, santal flower, and sheer amber.

Madewell teams with thredUP for a resale-driven collaboration

Madewell has teamed up with resale company thredUP for a resale venture of its own—and its name is a nod to the sustainability of the business model. The platform, “Madewell Forever,” will allow customers to shop pre-loved and secondhand Madewell denim—both in stores and online—as well as allow the label work towards its goal of creating quality denim that’s made to last. Launching as part of thredUP’s Resale-as-a-Service (RaaS) technology and logistics platform, “Madewell Forever” will become the first RaaS partner to launch a fully circular model. The resale venture isn’t the brand’s first sustainable initiative, though. Its previous “Do Well” series has already delivered on similar projects—namely, diverting nearly 550 tons of denim waste from landfills, saving over 1.6 million liters of water, to date. The partnership, which already has a collaborative history under its belt, aims to collect 1 million pairs of jeans by 2023 and double the life of each recirculated garment. To participate, customers can bring any pair of jeans to a Madwell location and earn $20 towards a full-price pair. Shoppable today, price tags—of over 3,000 pre-loved pairs—boast an affordable $35-$50 range.

Are your favourite fashion brands using forced labour? - Al Jazeera English,"Wed, 14 Jul 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFsamF6ZWVyYS5jb20vZWNvbm9teS8yMDIxLzcvMTQvYXJlLXlvdXItZmF2b3VyaXRlLWZhc2hpb24tYnJhbmRzLXVzaW5nLWZvcmNlZC1sYWJvdXLSAWVodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbGphemVlcmEuY29tL2FtcC9lY29ub215LzIwMjEvNy8xNC9hcmUteW91ci1mYXZvdXJpdGUtZmFzaGlvbi1icmFuZHMtdXNpbmctZm9yY2VkLWxhYm91cg?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"‘Labour abuse is baked into the supply-chain model championed by apparel giants,’ one labour rights researcher said, and a recent report found luxury brands are among the worst offenders.

The global fashion and retail industry’s reliance on producing quick-turnaround goods at a low cost through outsourcing and complex, globalised supply chains has allowed forced labour to thrive, workers’ rights advocates warn, claiming that major fashion brands profiting from the model seem reluctant to change.

The apparel sector employs over 60 million workers worldwide, according to the World Bank Group. And while 97 percent of fashion and retail brands have codes of conduct and corporate social responsibility (CSR) standards, such policies are neither effective in preventing forced labour nor in ensuring remedy outcomes for workers, according to advocacy group KnowTheChain.

KnowTheChain’s 2021 Apparel and Footwear Benchmark Report (PDF) recently ranked 37 of the world’s biggest fashion companies on a scale of 0 to 100 on their efforts to fight forced labour, with 100 representing the best practices.

The group identified allegations of forced labour in the supply chains of 54 percent of companies it examined.

“What stood out to us is that the average score for the sector was 41 out of 100, which constitutes a significant failure to address risks,” Felicitas Weber, project director at KnowTheChain, told Al Jazeera.

The report also found that the world’s largest luxury brands are among the worst offenders in addressing the worse forms of exploitation in their supply chains, with an average score of 31 out of 100.

French luxury goods company Kering (owner of the Alexander McQueen and Gucci labels) scored 41 out of 100, while LVMH (owner of the Christian Dior and Louis Vuitton labels) scored 19 out of 100. Tapestry (owner of the Coach and Kate Spade labels), assessed for the first time this year, scored 16 out of 100.

Kering, LVMH and Tapestry did not respond to Al Jazeera’s requests for comment.

Italian luxury fashion house Prada ranked at a mere 5 out of 100 on KnowTheChain’s benchmark, and its score has worsened over time.

But in a statement to Al Jazeera, Prada Group said it strives to push its standards higher and challenged KnowTheChain’s methodology.

Prada claims KnowTheChain does not take into account the fact that most of Prada’s factories are located in Italy, which allows it to closely monitor and address any misconduct or violations.

While KnowTheChain’s findings are striking, they aren’t surprising to workers’ rights advocates.

“Labour abuse is baked into the supply-chain model championed by apparel giants,” Penelope Kyritsis, research director at the Worker Rights Consortium, a labour rights monitoring organisation, told Al Jazeera.

By continually demanding shorter turnaround times and lower prices from their suppliers and fuelling competition among supplier factories, fashion and retail brands make it difficult for factory owners to adhere to labour laws and standards, she explained.

“This dynamic has been exacerbated by the coronavirus pandemic, when apparel brands sought to minimise their economic fallout by abruptly cancelling orders from their supplier factories, which led to mass layoffs, pushing workers towards the brink of destitution,” Kyritsis said.

For example, in Bangladesh, the second-largest employer of garment workers after China, more than one million garment workers – mostly women – were fired or temporarily let go when fashion brands cancelled orders during the height of last year’s pandemic shutdowns, according to research (PDF) conducted by Penn State University’s Center for Global Workers’ Rights.

Vulnerable migrants

While it is unclear exactly how many migrant workers and refugees are employed in the garment sector, they do make up much of the workforce across all regions, KnowTheChain told Al Jazeera.

For example, garment factories in Malaysia, Thailand and Taiwan heavily rely on workers from neighbouring countries, according to the Clean Clothes Campaign.

Jordan’s garment industry is estimated to employ nearly 70,000 workers, 53,000 of whom are migrants, the IndustriALL Global Union found in 2019. And Brazil’s Sao Paulo textile sector is known to employ an estimated 300,000 Bolivian workers, according to nongovernmental organisations cited in a report by the Business & Human Rights Resource Centre.

Migrants are often more vulnerable to abuse and exploitation, as they are often employed under informal agreements, are undocumented or lack adequate protection under the law.

“Migrants sometimes have to pay up to a year of their salary just as a fee to get the job, so really [it’s] quite extortionate,” KnowTheChain’s Weber explained. “We’ve seen more companies that reimburse these fees, but we need companies to step up significantly and not just take a baby step each year.”

Of the 28 retail and fashion companies disclosing migrant worker policies in the KnowTheChain report, just two companies provided examples of practical changes they take to address worker grievances. Those grievances can include withholding wages, abusive working and living conditions, intimidation, sexual harassment and threats.

While the ability to organise and challenge exploitative working conditions is crucial, thousands of unionised garment workers were reportedly targeted for dismissal due to union membership and organising during the pandemic, according to KnowTheChain.

‘Know and show’ supply chains

More broadly, companies in the industry need to be able to “know and show” their supply chains – and that means mapping and publishing the names of the suppliers they are working with at all levels, Weber said.

Exploitative working conditions thrive in countries where labour laws and enforcement are weak, but many fashion brands based in Europe and the United States continue to try and evade responsibility for what happens further down their supply chain, Chloe Cranston, business and human rights manager at Anti-Slavery International, told Al Jazeera.

Cranston cited the example of goods made using forced labour from members of the Uighur Muslim minority in China’s Xinjiang region.

A recent Amnesty International report documented the mass imprisonment and systemic torture of Uighur Muslims living in China, including through first-hand accounts. Some of those accounts detail forced labour and Uighurs being “required to live and work in a factory”.

“Almost the entire fashion industry is implicated in Uighur forced labour, through yarn or cotton sourcing, for example,” Cranston said.

On Tuesday, the United States issued an updated business advisory warning companies doing business in Xinjiang that they faced a heightened risk of falling afoul of US law due to the “growing evidence” of forced labour in the region, as well as other human rights abuses and “intrusive” surveillance.

The administration of former US President Donald Trump banned all cotton products from Western China’s Xinjiang region over allegations that they are made with forced labour from detained Uighur Muslims. The US, Canada, European Union and United Kingdom have also sanctioned Chinese nationals over the abuse allegations.

“We’ve seen some progress around this in the past year, yet the sad reality remains that the fashion industry still has a long way to go to ensure it is not complicit in the crimes against humanity suffered by Uighurs,” Cranston said.

Fashion and retail companies have significant corporate power, she stressed, and they have a responsibility to ensure that the way they work with suppliers, trade unions and labourers allows for decent working conditions for people up and down their supply chains – from those harvesting raw materials like cotton to those spinning them into fabric in factories.

“It shouldn’t be the burden of a consumer to try and guarantee a slavery-free purchase,” Cranston said."
