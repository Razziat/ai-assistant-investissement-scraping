Jay-Z Sells Half of Ace of Spades Champagne Brand to LVMH - The New York Times,"Mon, 22 Feb 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjEvMDIvMjIvc3R5bGUvamF5LXotbHZtaC1hY2Utb2Ytc3BhZGVzLWNoYW1wYWduZS5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"When Jay-Z clicked into a video call last week with Philippe Schaus, the chief executive of LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton’s drinks business, the Zoom backgrounds told the story.

Jay-Z spoke from a partly covered terrace of his Los Angeles home, wearing a casual sweater, accessorized by the outdoor living room and greenery around him. Mr. Schaus was in his office in Paris, wearing a suit, accessorized by shelves of elaborate drinks bottles behind him.

The topic: the news that LVMH would acquire half of Armand de Brignac, Jay-Z’s bubbly brand. (Most people call it Ace of Spades, after its bottle’s branding.)

The deal gives Jay-Z the organizational support and distribution power of a global drinks “machine,” as Mr. Schaus called it, while LVMH gets the cool clout and lifestyle marketing savvy of a pace-setting Black cultural leader at a time when the luxury sector’s racism is under particular scrutiny.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999823570251465}",neutral,0.9999823570251465,0
German sandal maker Birkenstock taken over by LVMH-backed group - The Guardian,"Fri, 26 Feb 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy8yMDIxL2ZlYi8yNi9nZXJtYW4tc2FuZGFsLW1ha2VyLWJpcmtlbnN0b2NrLXRha2VuLW92ZXItYnktbHZtaC1iYWNrZWQtZ3JvdXDSAXBodHRwczovL2FtcC50aGVndWFyZGlhbi5jb20vYnVzaW5lc3MvMjAyMS9mZWIvMjYvZ2VybWFuLXNhbmRhbC1tYWtlci1iaXJrZW5zdG9jay10YWtlbi1vdmVyLWJ5LWx2bWgtYmFja2VkLWdyb3Vw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The French family behind Louis Vuitton and Christian Dior is to take control of the German sandal maker Birkenstock in a deal thought to be worth €4bn (£3.5bn).

Financière Agache, the family investment firm of Bernard Arnault, the French billionaire who controls the designer brand conglomerate LVMH, and L Catterton, a private equity firm part-owned by LVMH, has bought a majority stake in the family-owned footwear brand. The value of the deal has yet to be confirmed.

Arnault fought off a competing bid from the private equity group CVC Capital Partners, which owns dozens of companies including Moto motorway services and the luxury watchmaker Breitling.

Birkenstock said the investment would help it expand in China and India, and fund the development of its website and the expansion of its main German factory in Görlitz.

Founded in 1774 in Langen-Bergheim by Johann Adam Birkenstock, a cobbler, the company set up its first factory in 1925. It will remain partly owned by the descendants of its founder – the brothers Alex and Christian Birkenstock – who will continue to oversee production of its footwear in Germany.

Arnault’s experience in taking brands to Asia, and L Catterton’s ownership of fashion brands such as Ganni, Seafolly and Pepe Jeans are thought to have swung the bid in their favour.

Christian and Alex Birkenstock said: “For the next 250 years we need partners sharing the same strategic and long-term vision as the Birkenstock family. In L Catterton and Financière Agache, we have found those partners. They bring both a deep understanding of the details of a manufacturing business that is all about quality and a respect for brands with a long heritage like ours. We look forward to taking the next steps with our partners and carrying our family business into an even brighter future.”

Arnault said his investment would help the sandal maker “fully realise its significant growth potential”, adding: “Birkenstock was founded nearly 250 years ago and has grown to become one of the few iconic brands in the footwear industry. We truly appreciate brands with this long heritage.”

Interest in comfortable heritage brands has soared during the coronavirus pandemic, helping the bootmaker Dr Martens to launch on the London stock market with a valuation of £3.7bn last month. Sandal makers Crocs and Tevas, and the bootmaker Ugg have also enjoyed booming sales as the world switched to working from home and took to outdoor walks.

Birkenstock’s sales increased 11% to €721.5m in 2019, when almost 24m pairs of its sandals were sold worldwide. The brand’s sales are thought to have surged again in 2020 as its footwear became a lockdown hit in many countries, including the UK.

Luca Solca, a luxury goods analyst at the investment management firm Bernstein, said the investment in Birkenstock was in sync with the direction of the footwear and fashion market. He said the deal followed on logically from the Dr Martens flotation and the private equity firm Permira’s €1.3bn buyout of the Italian trainer brand Golden Goose.

“Previously the focus was on elegant footwear like Jimmy Choo but the pandemic has accelerated a structural shift that was already moving towards casual and informal being the preferred option for consumers. This is not just in footwear but also other areas as well,” Solca said.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9994780421257019}",neutral,0.9994780421257019,0
Rihanna and LVMH Are Pausing the Fenty Fashion House - WWD,"Wed, 10 Feb 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3dkLmNvbS9mZWF0dXJlL3JpaGFubmEtbHZtaC1jbG9zZS1mZW50eS1mYXNoaW9uLWhvdXNlLTEyMzQ3MjU2Nzcv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Rihanna roiled the fashion scene on Wednesday, revealing that she is pausing her luxury maison with LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton while roaring ahead with her Savage x Fenty lingerie, backed with $115 million in new funding.

The twin developments highlighted the challenges dressy fashion brands have faced amid the pandemic — even megastars aren’t immune — and pointed to more explosive growth in categories like innerwear and beauty.

WWD broke the news that Rihanna and LVMH mutually agreed to pause the Fenty fashion maison, less than two years after the launch.

The brand stopped posting on its Instagram account on Jan. 1, and the last collection drop on Fenty.com dates back to November 2020: nail-heeled footwear in collaboration with one of Rihanna’s favorite shoe designers, Amina Muaddi. It is understood the e-commerce site — the main distribution channel for Fenty fashions — is to go dark by the end of February or early March.

LVMH confirmed the development exclusively to WWD via a brief statement saying: “Rihanna and LVMH have jointly made the decision to put on hold the ready-to-wear activity, based in Europe, pending better conditions.”

According to sources, a skeleton staff remains at the Paris headquarters of Fenty fashions to wind down remaining operations.

Meanwhile, signaling its strong belief in Rihanna and her growing Fenty product universe, LVMH now plans to concentrate on Fenty Beauty and Fenty Skin — and get involved in her successful lingerie venture.

Separately on Wednesday, Savage x Fenty said private equity giant L Catterton, in which LVMH has a stake, led a $115 million Series B fundraising round to support its growth and upcoming expansion into retail.

Launched in 2018 with California-based TechStyle Fashion Group, Rihanna’s lingerie brand posted revenue growth of more than 200 percent last year, and “increased its active VIP member base by more than 150 percent,” Savage x Fenty said in a statement.

The fundraising round also garnered “significant participation” from existing investors such as Marcy Venture Partners, which was cofounded by Jay Z, and Avenir. Savage also mentioned a “number of new investors,” including Sunley House Capital, part of Advent International.

“Savage x Fenty has achieved remarkable success by disrupting the intimates category,” Jon Owsley, co-managing partner of L Catterton’s Growth Fund, said in a statement. “The brand strikes a unique balance between affordability, fashion and comfort, stands deeply for inclusivity and diversity, and has differentiated itself by building an extraordinary level of affinity and unmatched customer loyalty. We believe the opportunities ahead for Savage x Fenty are enormous.”

The 2017 launch of Fenty Beauty included an unprecedented 40 shades of foundation, while her lingerie brand has an extended size offering, including bras from 30A to 42H and panties and sleepwear ranging from XS to 3X. Savage x Fenty has also recently expanded to include men’s basics.

“LVMH and Rihanna reaffirm their ambition to concentrate on the growth and the long-term development of the Fenty ecosystem focusing on cosmetics, skin care and lingerie,” LVMH and Rihanna added in its statement to WWD.

Late last year, Rihanna was said to be looking for investors to expand Savage x Fenty, running a selective process with Goldman Sachs. On Wednesday, Savage clarified that Goldman acted as exclusive placement agent for the Series B financing, with Rothschild & Co. serving as financial adviser to Savage x Fenty joint venture partners.

Rihanna is said to be “sad” about having to put her Fenty fashion house on ice, but excited about her brand’s potential in other categories.

The fashion start-up came up against the coronavirus crisis, which kept the music star grounded in Los Angeles, allowing her to be hands-on with Font Beauty and the launch last July of Fenty Skin, both based in California, but estranged from design and development teams in Paris, and production sites in Italy. Rihanna was known to jump on a plane to visit important fabric suppliers and educate herself about garment production.

It is understood that Rihanna and LVMH ultimately decided to “make priorities” and focus on Fenty’s high-flying U.S.-based businesses, with sources describing the launch of Fenty Skin as a “home run.”

Sources told WWD the pop star and the luxury group have other projects in the pipeline.

Market sources estimate Fenty Skin racked up sales of $30 million in less than four months on its e-store. The brand debuted in Sephora locations this month, and it is also available at Harvey Nichols and Boots in the U.K.

The Fenty fashion house is said to have enjoyed encouraging sales of eyewear, shoes and denim, and found some initial traction in department stores. It is understood Rihanna’s first drop of shoes with Muaddi last July sold out within five days.

But the challenges of creating eight rtw collections a year and running a start-up remotely proved too onerous.

By all accounts, Rihanna’s popularity remains robust, despite the fact that she has not released a new album since 2016 or had many red-carpet opportunities lately. Her personal Instagram account boasts 90.8 million followers.

The Instagram account for Fenty fashion had 1 million followers versus 3.9 million for Savage x Fenty by Rihanna and 10.5 million for Fenty Beauty by Rihanna. Fenty Skin’s platform on Instagram has north of 800,000 followers.

WWD broke the news in January 2019 that Rihanna, already a wunderkind in color cosmetics via her beauty partnership with LVMH, would enter the fashion arena with her own brand following a stint as Puma’s creative director.

Announced officially in May of that year, LVMH said the Fenty house would be “centered on Rihanna, developed by her and takes shape with her vision in terms of rtw, shoes and accessories, including commerciality and communication of the brand.”

It marked the first time LVMH — whose forte is modernizing legacy brands such as Dior, Louis Vuitton, Givenchy and Bulgari — had launched a fashion brand from scratch since it set up a couture house for Christian Lacroix in 1987.

The project was also uncharacteristically low-key for a group known for lavish fashion shows and splashy advertising campaigns. While there were pop-up events in such marquee stores as Bergdorf Goodman and Galeries Lafayette Champs-Élysées, product launches were quiet affairs announced on Fenty fashion’s website and on social media.

Last fall, LVMH brought in a new managing director who seemed poised to tweak the positioning of Rihanna’s luxury maison. Bastien Renard, who worked for 19 years at Nike in Europe and in the U.S., succeeded Véronique Gebel, a long-standing Louis Vuitton executive from its rtw department conscripted for the launch. It is understood Renard is managing the winding down, and will take up a new assignment within LVMH.

LVMH had hinted things were less than rosy at Fenty when it disclosed third-quarter last October.

“On Fenty fashion, we are obviously still in a launching phase and we have to figure out exactly what is the right offer. It’s not something that is easy. We were starting entirely from scratch,” chief financial officer Jean-Jacques Guiony said at the time. “Obviously, we have the great help from Rihanna on this, but I would say it’s still a work in progress when it comes to really defining what the offer will be. We have successes, we have things that have worked less well, so we have to sort in between the two and really decide what should be the core strengths of the offer in the years to come.”

Robyn Rihanna Fenty holds the titles of founder, chief executive officer and artistic director of Fenty. Jean Baptiste Voisin, chief strategy officer at LVMH, oversaw the launch of the luxury fashion house, whose remaining offerings include $300 hoodies to $900 gladiator sandals.

Most of Rihanna’s fashions, sold principally online at Fenty.com via see-now-buy-now drops, have skewed more to the dressy and designer end of the spectrum.

It is understood that LVMH and Rihanna haven’t ruled out taking a second run at a luxury maison in the future, encouraged by the fact that it was able to attract repeat customers, mostly professional, high-net-worth women who also frequent other luxury brands.

Others are skeptical.

“I have the impression that celebrity-originated brands can be very popular very quickly, but that their staying power is questionable,” said Luca Solca, a luxury goods analyst at Bernstein.

He noted that the LVMH business is built on heritage brands with staying power, evident in the strong recent performance of Louis Vuitton and Dior.

“The idea of using LVMH as a platform to incubate and launch smaller brands is in theory fascinating, but is seemingly not working in practice, at least this time,” he said, noting the pandemic certainly hasn’t helped. “Beauty can be a different story, as Sephora has successfully worked as a mother ship for smaller beauty brands to launch and develop. Beauty would also entail lower fixed costs to operate than a fully fledged fashion maison.”

Rihanna has demonstrated a serious interest in, and influence on, fashion — along with formidable design chops and acute instincts — with her three-year stint as the creative director of Puma, energizing the German activewear brand with her Fenty by Puma project, and following it up with successful forays into beauty and lingerie — the former with LVMH-controlled Kendo.

Kendo, which functions as an incubator making products that end up being retailed by LVMH’s Sephora perfumery chain and other outposts, signed on Rihanna in 2016. Her Fenty Beauty products racked up sales north of $100 million in a matter of weeks, and was hailed as a transformative brand.

Rihanna’s proximity to LVMH stretches back to at least 2015. After attending shows for Christian Dior, one of Arnault’s most treasured fashion properties, she appeared in “Secret Garden IV,” a campaign and short film shot by Steven Klein inside Versailles. It featured her in Dior sunglasses, carrying the brand’s bags and wearing looks from the Esprit Dior collection.

A year later, she created a range of futuristic sunglasses in collaboration with Dior as part of her brand ambassadorship.

Rihanna’s talent and beauty have made her a favorite of fashion designers worldwide. The Barbados native has previously modeled for Gucci, Emporio Armani and Balmain.

She made her debut in design in 2013 with British high-street brand River Island, creating a collection of clothing and accessories.

LVMH buys 50% of rapper Jay-Z’s champagne brand Armand de Brignac - Al Jazeera English,"Mon, 22 Feb 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFsamF6ZWVyYS5jb20vZWNvbm9teS8yMDIxLzIvMjIvbHZtaC1idXlzLTUwLW9mLXJhcHBlcmpheS16cy1jaGFtcGFnbmUtYnJhbmQtYXJtYW5kLWRlLWJyaWduYWPSAW5odHRwczovL3d3dy5hbGphemVlcmEuY29tL2FtcC9lY29ub215LzIwMjEvMi8yMi9sdm1oLWJ1eXMtNTAtb2YtcmFwcGVyamF5LXpzLWNoYW1wYWduZS1icmFuZC1hcm1hbmQtZGUtYnJpZ25hYw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Armand de Brignac sold more than half a million bottles, prices of which run $300 and up, in 2019.

LVMH’s Moet Hennessy has bought a 50% stake in Armand de Brignac, a Champagne producer owned by rapper Jay-Z, another sign of a close relationship between the luxury industry and hip-hop culture.

No financial terms were disclosed for Monday’s transaction. Armand de Brignac sold more than half a million bottles in 2019, prices of which run $300 and up.

The rap star has been an investor in the brand since 2006, when he touted the brand, known for its Ace of Spades logo on a metallic silver bottle, in a video for “Show Me What You Got.” Jay-Z bought out Sovereign Brands’s stake in the company in 2014.

“Armand de Brignac breaks barriers and reflects contemporary luxury, while preserving the tradition of the Champagne terroirs,” Philippe Schaus, chief executive officer of LVMH’s Moet Hennessy drinks unit, said in a statement.

The brand is set to gain from the luxury-marketing expertise and distribution network of LVMH just as the Champagne industry reels from the pandemic. The market shrank by a fifth last year amid delays and cancellations to weddings and other celebrations. LVMH, whose brands include Moet & Chandon Champagne and Hennessy Cognac, outperformed, with wine and spirit sales dropping 14%.

The deal is the fruit of connections between Jay-Z and Alexandre Arnault, the 28-year old son of LVMH’s billionaire founder, Bernard Arnault. Alexandre has been taking a bigger role at the conglomerate, recently being named to help run Tiffany & Co., which became part of LVMH last month. He previously ran Rimowa after persuading LVMH to acquire the German suitcase brand.

The rapper threw an Oscars party last year where guests like Kanye West and Jack Dorsey could sip his Armand de Brignac Champagne.

LVMH’s bet on global celebrities hasn’t always paid off. The luxury conglomerate announced earlier this month it was suspending its collaboration with Rihanna for the Fenty fashion brand, less than two years into that venture.

Why Rihanna's luxury collaboration with LVMH failed - Quartz,"Wed, 10 Feb 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vcXouY29tLzE5NzEyODcvd2h5LXJpaGFubmFzLWx1eHVyeS1jb2xsYWJvcmF0aW9uLXdpdGgtbHZtaC1mYWlsZWTSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"It was big news in 2019 when LVMH announced it was teaming with Rihanna to create a full-fledged fashion line called Fenty. A clear sign of the times, it was the first instance of the luxury powerhouse partnering with a celebrity, or a woman of color, to launch a brand from scratch. Rihanna, of course, would bring her megawatt style and stardom. LVMH would provide the know-how it accumulated from decades of building brands such as Louis Vuitton and Dior.

Not quite two years later, LVMH and Rihanna told trade outlet WWD (paywall) they’re putting the clothing line on pause “pending better conditions.” LVMH confirmed the news in a statement to Quartz.

Despite the success of Rihanna’s previous forays into makeup and lingerie, the fashion line never generated the same excitement or quite found its place in the market. Fenty Beauty, her cosmetics brand, attracted customers by catering to a wide range of skin tones. Savage x Fenty, her lingerie line, created body-positive spectacles that celebrated women of all shapes with its bras and underwear while market leader Victoria’s Secret was still pushing its narrow, skinny ideal. But the fashion line, rather than trying to rewrite the rules of luxury, struggled to distinguish itself with a clear identity. The attempts by Rihanna and her design team have spanned items such as a $700 satin shirt dress, $300 hoodies, a padded denim jacket for nearly $1,000, and footwear like $910 hot pink heels.

Jean Jacques Guiony, LVMH’s CFO, acknowledged the problem on an earnings call in October. “I would say it’s still work in progress when it comes to really defining what the offer would be,” he said. “We have success. We have things that have worked less well. So we have to sort in between the two and really decide what should be the core strengths of the offer in the years to come.”

The prices have evidently been an issue too. Business of Fashion reports (paywall) that even before the line’s launch, Rihanna was concerned the price tags might put off fans, who have otherwise happily lined up to buy items like her $22 Fenty Beauty lipstick. Though priced lower than other LVMH brands, the clothing was still expensive. Fashion lines centered on a celebrity tend to perform better at accessible prices in the mass market, often with the help of large partners such as department stores or big-box retailers like Target. When celebrity-founded luxury companies have succeeded, as in the case of The Row by Ashley and Mary-Kate Olsen, it’s been through a focus on product and not so much the fame of the founders.

The pandemic has not been an ideal moment to build a new brand either. Leading names such as Louis Vuitton and Dior have proved resilient, but smaller companies without so large and loyal an audience have suffered.

It’s possible the Fenty line could return. In its statement, LVMH didn’t elaborate on what “better conditions” might mean, but it’s likely they would entail Covid-19 being better contained.

In the meantime, LVMH is signaling its confidence in Rihanna’s lingerie line. L Catterton, the private-equity firm in which LVMH is a partner, led a $115 million funding round that will help Savage x Fenty continue its growth and expand into retail. In a statement, it touted the line’s “remarkable success by disrupting the intimates category.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9790546894073486}",neutral,0.9790546894073486,0

It was announced today, via The New York Times, that the best-selling rapper has sold 50 percent of his champagne brand, Armand de Brignac, also known as Ace of Spades, to the French conglomerate.

Though the financial terms of the new partnership haven't been released to the public, the Times reported that in 2018, half of Armand de Brignac was valued at a cool $250 million, per Jay-Z's verse in his track with Meek Mill, ""What's Free.""

""I'm 50 percent of D'Ussé and it's debt-free / 100 percent of Ace of Spades, worth half a B,"" rapped the mogul at the time. D'Ussé is the brand of cognac Jay-Z owns along with Bacardi.

Per the NYT, the partnership between the hip-hop mogul and the luxury company happened ""very naturally,"" and the two parties are eager to see how they can grow the brand's notoriety along the other luxe champagnes, including Dom Pérignon, Moët & Chandon, Ruinart, Krug, and Veuve Clicquot. Their business deal also comes at a challenging time for the champagne industry, which saw sales of the drink fall by a fifth due to a decline in events, celebrations, and the shattering of the restaurant industry amid the COVID-19 pandemic, per WWD.

""We had been following its success over the last few years and we thought, this is crazy. Most Champagne brands see very modest growth, and he was just shooting up through the ranks. We tasted the Champagne and we said, yes, there is something to be done together,"" said Philippe Schaus, chief executive officer of Moët Hennessy, in an interview with WWD. ""We are already global leaders with our prestige Champagne brands—Dom Pérignon, Krug and the prestige cuvées of Veuve Clicquot and Ruinart—but Armand de Brignac has created another niche and in some respects revolutionized the prestige category, so we wanted to be part of that. They opened Champagne to a new clientele, so in that sense, it's a great complement to our portfolio.""","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9900296330451965}",neutral,0.9900296330451965,0

German footwear brand Birkenstock is selling a majority stake to L Catterton, a private equity firm backed by Bernard Arnault’s LVMH (LVMHF).

The company said in a statement on Friday that L Catterton affiliates including Arnault’s family investment company, Financière Agache, will also invest in the maker of the iconic flat sandals. Arnault is Europe’s richest person, with an estimated net worth of $117 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.

“In L Catterton and Financière Agache we have found not just shareholders, but also partners for achieving our global growth ambitions,” said CEO Oliver Reichert, who is one of the company’s first leaders to come from outside the Birkenstock family.

Brothers Christian and Alex Birkenstock will keep a minority stake, according to the Financial Times, which reported that the deal valued the company at €4 billion ($4.8 billion). Birkenstock declined to comment on the financial details of the transaction.

The company traces its roots to 1774 and is the largest employer in the German shoe industry, according to its website. Its sandals have long been a staple of celebrities and fashion icons, such as Heidi Klum, Kendall Jenner and Alexa Chung.

Last July, British Vogue declared Birkenstock the official sandals of 2020 and they were one of the most sought after items of clothing during the pandemic, according to online fashion retailer Lyst.

In the statement on Friday, Birkenstock said it is “performing better than ever before.” Under its new owners, it plans to grow in markets such as China and India and expand production in Germany. It will also invest in e-commerce platforms and its direct-to-consumer business.

L Catterton was formed in 2016 when LVMH and Groupe Arnault joined forces with US private equity firm Catterton.

“Birkenstock was founded nearly 250 years ago and has grown to become one the few iconic brands in the footwear industry. We truly appreciate brands with this long heritage,” Arnault said in a statement.

Birkenstock has 4,300 employees worldwide.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999849796295166}",neutral,0.9999849796295166,0
"Fenty fashion faltered, but LVMH sees growth for lingerie and beauty - Vogue Business","Wed, 10 Feb 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZvZ3VlYnVzaW5lc3MuY29tL2NvbXBhbmllcy9mZW50eS1mYXNoaW9uLWZhbHRlcmVkLWx2bWgtZ3Jvd3RoLXNhdmFnZS1saW5nZXJpZS1iZWF1dHnSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Less than two years after its debut, LVMH and Rihanna’s fashion brand, Fenty, is on ice. “Rihanna and LVMH have jointly made the decision to put on hold the ready-to-wear activity based in Europe, pending better conditions,” LVMH said in a statement on Wednesday.

While the Fenty fashion house has faltered, the Rihanna-led Fenty beauty and lingerie lines have proven that other brand avenues are fruitful partnerships. The announcement coincided with the completion of a $115 million funding round for Rihanna’s lingerie line Savage X Fenty, led by L Catterton, the private equity firm backed by LVMH. “LVMH and Rihanna reaffirm their ambition to concentrate on the growth and long-term development of the Fenty ecosystem focusing on cosmetics, skincare and lingerie,” LVMH stated. While Fenty Beauty is backed by LVMH’s beauty incubator Kendo, Savage X Fenty was launched as a joint venture between Rihanna and TechStyle Fashion Group.

The move to focus on lower price point categories (i.e. beauty and lingerie) is evidence of the paramount challenge in creating a luxury brand from scratch, even for the world’s largest luxury conglomerate and a global celebrity who counts 90.8 million Instagram followers.

“We have to figure out what the right offer is and it’s not something easy,” LVMH chief financial officer Jean-Jacques Guiony told analysts in October 2020, regarding the future of Fenty. “It’s still a work in progress.”

LVMH, which invested €30 million in the brand at launch, controls 50.01 per cent of Fenty compared to Rihanna’s 49.99 per cent, according to public filings. The brand sold direct-to-consumer online and wasn’t following a wholesale model (it popped up in concessions in Bergdorf Goodman, The Webster, Galeries Lafayette Champs Élysées and Selfridges). It specialised in aspirational luxury goods like sunglasses as well as streetwear-inspired and sophisticated fashion items. Prices ranged from €120 for a T-shirt to €1,500 for a coat with embellishments. Eyewear sold for between €250 and €400 and the core of the collection retailed between €200 and €700.

“It wasn’t the right formula to go to the market in this peculiar moment,” says Mario Ortelli, managing partner of luxury advisors firm Ortelli & Co., citing the price point that put Fenty in direct competition with the fashion brands with an established cachet and the calendar of drops that accelerated too much, reducing the specificity of each drop.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999738931655884}",neutral,0.9999738931655884,0

Feb. 10 (UPI) -- Rihanna and French luxury group LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton are putting the singer's Fenty fashion house ""on hold."" WWD reported Wednesday that Rihanna, and LVMH have suspended the Fenty fashion brand, less than two years after its launch. Advertisement

""Rihanna and LVMH have jointly made the decision to put on hold the RTW activity, based in Europe, pending better conditions,"" LVMH said in a statement.

Fenty released its most recent collection, a collaboration with shoe designer Amina Muaddi, in November and last posted on its Instagram account Jan. 1. The e-commerce site is expected to close down in the coming weeks.

Bloomberg confirmed the news and said the COVID-19 pandemic has reduced demand for clothing.

LVMH will now concentrate on Fenty Beauty and Fenty Skin, Rihanna's line of makeup and skin products. In addition, L Catterton, in which LVMH has a stake, led a $115 million Series B funding into Savage X Fenty, Rihanna's lingerie line.

""Following the completion of a fundraising round where L Catterton has taken a stake into Savage X Fenty, LVMH and Rihanna reaffirm their ambition to concentrate on the growth and the long-term development of Fenty ecosystem focusing on cosmetics, skincare and lingerie,"" LVMH and Rihanna said.

Rihanna launched her Fenty X Puma clothing line in 2016 and announced her partnership with LVMH in May 2019. She is the first woman to create an original brand at LVMH and the first woman of color to head an LVMH maison.

Birkenstock has agreed to sell a majority stake to LVMH -backed private equity firm L Catterton, it said on Friday, in a deal that brings the maker of comfy, blocky sandals in the orbit of the French luxury powerhouse.

The family-owned German company did not disclose financial details of a deal it said would help it to grow in China and India as well as expand its online business.

Sources close to the matter said the transaction values the company at about 4 billion euros ($4.85 billion).

Financiere Agache, the family office of French billionaire and LVMH boss Bernard Arnault, is also taking part in the purchase alongside L Catterton, the previous investments of which include Pepe Jeans, online retailer Everlane and workout gear brand Sweaty Betty.

""Birkenstock was founded nearly 250 years ago and has grown to become one of the few iconic brands in the footwear industry. We truly appreciate brands with this long heritage,"" Arnault said in a statement.

Birkenstock, which traces its roots to 1774 and sells sandals in 100 countries, said it had a ""record year"" in 2020 despite the COVID-19 pandemic and is expanding production capacity in Germany. The company, which has yet to publish 2020 results, had revenue of 721.5 million euros in the year to Sept 30, 2019.

L Catterton was created in 2016 as a joint venture between consumer-foused private equity firm Catterton, LVMH and Groupe Arnault, Arnault's family holding company. It now manages 23 billion dollars in assets.

Louis Vuitton and Christian Dior owner LVMH, the world's biggest luxury goods group, has been courting younger customers through collaborations with streetwear labels and tie-ups with celebrities.

The maker of Moet Hennessy this week bought a 50% stake in rap star Jay-Z's Armand de Brignac champagne brand, and though LVMH last month put its Fenty fashion venture with pop star Rihanna on hold, L Catterton took a stake in the R&B singer's lingerie line.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999836683273315}",neutral,0.9999836683273315,0

Armand de Brignac’s ‘entry-level’ Champagne, Ace of Spades Gold Brut, retails for about £250 a bottle. The range also includes a Brut Rosé, Demi-Sec and ultra-prestige expressions Blanc de Blancs and Blanc de Noirs.

Launched in 2006 and made by Champagne Cattier at Chigny-les-Roses on the Montagne de Reims, the brand sold more than 500,000 bottles in 2019, with a strong presence in bars and nightclubs.

According to a spokesperson for Moët Hennessy – by far the largest producer of Champagne with brands such as Moët et Chandon, Veuve Clicquot and Dom Pérignon – the Cattier family will continue to make Armand de Brignac Champagnes in the future.

Jay-Z, whose real name is Shawn Carter, said he was ‘proud’ to announce the joint venture with Moët Hennessy, adding: ‘It is a partnership that has felt familiar the entire time.

‘We are confident that the sheer power of the Moët Hennessy global distribution framework, its unparalleled portfolio strength and its long-established track record of excellence in developing luxury brands will give Armand de Brignac the commercial power it needs to grow and flourish even further.’

Philippe Schaus, president and CEO of Moët Hennessy, said the new partnership would allow the company to take Armand de Brignac ‘to new heights across the world’.

He added: ‘For years we have been following the fantastic success of Armand de Brignac and admiring their ability to challenge some of the rules of the Champagne category.’

Jay-Z’s involvement with Armand de Brignac began in 2006, with his boycotting of former favourite luxury Champagne Cristal, eventually buying it outright in November 2014, acquiring the remaining stake in the business held by New York-based Sovereign Brands.

Jay-Z and luxury goods giant LVMH have a reason to break out the bubbly.

LVMH, which owns Dom Pérignon and Moët & Chandon, has taken a 50% stake in Jay-Z’s Champagne brand Armand de Brignac, also known as “Ace of Spades.” The terms of the deal were not disclosed.

The partnership comes at a time when LVMH is working to appeal to a more diverse clientele. The luxury sector has long been criticized for cultural appropriation, high-profile racist gaffes and a lack of runway diversity.

LVMH recently revealed tennis champion Naomi Osaka as its new brand ambassador. During the US open, Osaka was praised for supporting the Black Lives Matter protests that started over the summer. It has also collaborated with skateboarder Lucien Clark on apparel and a skate shoe.

And a few years ago, it partnered with singer Rihanna on Fenty Fashion House, making her the first Black woman to lead an original brand with LVMH. Fenty Fashion House was recently discontinued. But LVMH said it will continue to support other elements of the Fenty empire, concentrating on “the growth and long-term development” of beauty and skincare lines Fenty Beauty and Fenty Skin, as well as lingerie line Savage X Fenty, which just raised $115 million to help it expand into retail.

“LVMH is a brand that has quite a wide appeal. It serves lots of different markets,” said Neil Saunders, retail industry analyst and managing director of GlobalData. By diversifying its marketing efforts and expanding its portfolio, it can help reach “audiences that are very important, but perhaps have been traditionally underrepresented in luxury,” he said. The partnership with Jay-Z “certainly helps as part of that effort.”

The deal comes in the wake of a difficult year for Champagne, as sales fell due to canceled celebrations and restrictions on indoor dining during the coronavirus pandemic. Shipments of Champagne fell 18% in 2020 compared to 2019, according to CIVC, a Champagne trade group. At LVMH, Champagne volumes fell 19% in 2020, the company said in January.

“For years we have been following the fantastic success of Armand de Brignac and admiring their ability to challenge some of the rules of the Champagne category,” said Philippe Schaus, president and CEO of Moet Hennessy, in a release Monday. “Armand de Brignac breaks barriers and reflects contemporary luxury.”

Shawn Carter, who goes by Jay-Z, has long had an interest in Champagne. He used to champion Cristal, but began a boycott of the brand in 2006 after the head of the company that makes that Champagne, Frederic Rouzaud, made disparaging remarks about its popularity in the hip-hop community. “What can we do? We can’t forbid people from buying it,” Rouzaud told The Economist at the time.

Instead of Cristal, Jay-Z turned his attention to Armand de Brignac. He featured the signature “Ace of Spades” bottle in a 2006 music video. Five years later, the beverage was the “Champagne toast of choice” at Kim Kardashian’s wedding to Kris Humphries. Jay-Z acquired the brand in 2014.

LVMH’s distribution strength and experience developing luxury brands “will give Armand de Brignac the commercial power it needs to grow and flourish even further,” said Jay-Z in a statement Monday.

Jay-Z said during CNBC's ""Squawk Box"" on Monday that he started having conversations about a deal with LVMH in 2019.

""It just started out in a place of respect and built from there pretty quickly,"" he said.

A bottle of Armand de Brignac Brut Gold retails for $300. A 30-liter bottle, which weighs about 100 pounds, can sell for around $275,000, according to Eater.

""What we could bring to the brand, which is already very successful, is the sheer power of our international distribution network,"" Moet Hennessy CEO Philippe Schaus told CNBC.

The news comes just two years after its launch.

Fenty was the first fashion house since Christian Lacroix in 1987, to have started from scratch under the LVMH name. Known for its high-end prices, the LVMH-backed brand was unable to appeal to Rihanna’s broad fan base. The luxury house and singer reportedly came to a mutual decision to end the brand, as confirmed in a released statement from LVMH, “Rihanna and LVMH have jointly made the decision to put on hold the RTW activity, based in Europe, pending better conditions.”

The Fenty Instagram has been inactive since January 1, 2021, and it is expected that its e-commerce site will go dark in the coming weeks. The focus will now shift towards Rihanna’s growing Fenty Beauty empire, as well as Fenty Skin and her highly successful Savage x Fenty lingerie line.

L Catterton, a private equity company LVMH currently has stakes in, has reportedly continued to invest in the other Fenty brands. LVMH recently said, “LVMH and Rihanna reaffirm their ambition to concentrate on the growth and the long-term development of Fenty ecosystem focusing on cosmetics, skincare and lingerie.”

The Fenty makeup line brought in around half a million dollars in sales in its first year and is expected to grow exponentially in the long-term. Both Fenty Beauty and Fenty Skin have set the benchmark for beauty brands throughout the industry, stepping away from the limited shade ranges and the lack of diversity in its campaigns.

LVMH and Rihanna have not yet ruled out the possibility of restarting Fenty again down the line.

NEW YORK — LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, the world’s largest luxury group, has put Rihanna’s Fenty fashion collection on hold.

The move, confirmed by LVMH Wednesday, comes nearly two years after the fashion conglomerate announced the collaboration with the pop artist and business mogul.

Rihanna became the first Black woman to head a luxury house with LVMH, which owns such labels as Christian Dior, Givenchy and Louis Vuitton.

“Rihanna and LVMH have jointly made the decision to put on hold the RTW activity, based in Europe, pending better conditions,” according to the statement by LVMH emailed to The Associated Press.

A representative for Rihanna couldn’t immediately be reached.

LVMH said that the Paris-based company and Rihanna will focus their efforts on the growth and long-term development of Fenty on cosmetics, skincare and lingerie.

WWD first reported the news on LVMH’s pause of Fenty fashion collection.

Despite one venture coming to a halt, Rihanna has her hands full with her other multibillion-dollar businesses, including Fenty Beauty, Savage X Fenty and her highly anticipated ninth album.

On Wednesday, Savage X Fenty announced its lingerie brand completed a $115 million fundraising round to expand into retail and further invest in customer acquisition.

""LVMH and Rihanna reaffirm their ambition to concentrate on the growth and the long-term development of Fenty ecosystem focusing on cosmetics, skincare and lingerie,"" the luxury goods company said in a statement on Wednesday.

In 2019, Rihanna made history at the first woman and person of color to launch a line with the French retail giant, and the brand's first collection, ""Release 5-19,"" featured a wide range of outerwear, dresses, accessories and more.

French investment firm Tikehau Capital SCA is sponsoring the SPAC alongside Mustier, Financiere Agache, a group belonging to Arnault, as well as banker Diego De Giorgi, formerly of UniCredit and Bank of America Merrill Lynch.

The four of them will be equal partners in the venture, sources familiar with the situation said. The SPAC will be listed in Amsterdam, and is the first of several being planned by this group.

“We see SPACs as a natural extension of our toolbox now. We plan for repeated issuance and not just a one-off opportunistic one,” said one of the sources.

A SPAC is a shell company that raises money in an initial public offering (IPO) to merge with a privately held company, that then becomes publicly traded as a result.

SPACs have emerged as a popular IPO alternative for companies, especially in the United States, providing a path to going public with less regulatory scrutiny and more certainty over the valuation that will be attained and funds raised.

Overall, 144 SPACs have raised $45.7 billion so far this year, based on data from SPAC Research, with backers including high-profile investors, politicians and sports personalities.

The huge roster of deals there has meant that there have been concerns over a saturation of that market, which helped fuel the decision to list in Europe instead.

“We looked at the US market and decided to do it in Amsterdam instead. We thought our proposal was differentiated by taking it to Europe, particularly when we are looking to target European companies,” said the source.

“But we have looked to replicate a US structure so global investors understand it, and Amsterdam seemed best suited for that. You may have also seen that Amsterdam has taken over London in terms of (stock market) flows,” he added.

Bankers agreed that Amsterdam is emerging as the destination of choice in Europe, as regulations there are closest to the United States, where protections for SPAC investors are better than in many jurisdictions.

For example, Dutch regulations allow investors to redeem their investment if the target eventually identified is not to their liking.

In the financial services arena, other big name sponsors are also emerging. Former Credit Suisse CEO Tidjane Thiam is also launching a SPAC that will list in New York and focus on financial services, while Martin Blessing, a former chief executive officer of Commerzbank AG, is planning one listed in the Netherlands.

The Tikehau SPAC will target areas such as financial technology or fintech, fund management, insurance and other diversified financial services.

This follows the first one launched in France in December by Xavier Niel, former Lazard banker Matthieu Pigasse and entrepreneur Moez-Alexandre Zouari, aimed at deals in the health and food industries.

Mustier, who also had a spell running French bank Societe Generale’s investment banking arm, left UniCredit this month.

In nearly five years at the helm, Mustier rebuilt UniCredit’s capital reserves and cleaned up its balance sheet, but failed to find sustained profit drivers or lift the bank’s depressed stock price.

Arnault is best known as the founder of luxury goods group and Louis Vuitton owner LVMH. His personal holding company, Financiere Agache, is a long-standing investor in Tikehau, the investment firm said.

The French fashion giant said Wednesday it would cease operations at the brand while continuing its relationship with the superstar through Fenty Beauty, as well as a new investment in her lingerie business via LVMH-backed private equity firm L Catterton.

The launch of the celebrity tie-up stoked headlines, not only for its superstar creative director but also because it was the first fashion brand LVMH had started from scratch since its chairman Bernard Arnault backed designer Christian Lacroix in 1987. The French fashion conglomerate’s bet helped to spotlight innovation at the company, while banking on Rihanna’s power as a style icon and spokesperson to help rapidly build market share for the new luxury house.

Emboldened by the runaway success of its partnership with Rihanna on her Fenty makeup line (which brought in around half a million dollars in sales in its first year), LVMH had positioned Fenty as a long-term initiative when the label launched to much fanfare in spring 2019.

But the brand struggled to gain traction. The difficult trading environment created by the pandemic less than a year after launch certainly bears some of the blame, but the brand’s brief lifespan also points to a long-standing challenge for the Paris-based luxury group: when it comes to launching new businesses versus acquiring established names, LVMH still struggles.

The move to discontinue Fenty is the latest instance of LVMH pulling the plug on underperformers as the pandemic continues to hammer luxury sales. The group announced it would unwind its partnership with the British shoe designer Nicholas Kirkwood last fall, and is reportedly seeking bidders for shirtmaker Thomas Pink, which suspended e-commerce in December and closed its remaining stores in London and New York.

Fenty’s launch coincided with a broader push to boost LVMH’s reputation for innovation. The group started a luxury e-commerce emporium, 24S, which has yet to take significant share from the likes of Farfetch and Net-a-Porter, as well as sponsoring a start-up accelerator aimed at fast-tracking early-stage fashion tech companies.

With its star-power and halo of innovation, Fenty might have been different. At launch, the brand adopted the buzzy strategies of the fashion moment. It focused on direct-to-consumer online sales and frequent “drops” of limited-edition products took the place of seasonal collections, trying to build on that format without the foundation of glitzy stores or an established brand image built up over decades.

As one of social media’s most influential style voices — with a tossed-together aesthetic that made avant-garde dressing look almost easy, and the rarefied allure of a bona fide, Grammy-winning pop princess — Rihanna’s “Navy” of 91 million Instagram followers were the key audience.

But their impassioned embrace of her $35 matte foundation didn’t extend to $600 button-up shirts and $950 jean jackets.

Even before Fenty’s 2019 launch, Rihanna had expressed concern that the label’s high prices could alienate her sprawling fanbase, sources close to the project said. LVMH agreed to price items at a lower markup than for its luxury ready-to-wear brands like Givenchy, but they remained a stretch for the vast majority of her audience.

At the same time, the concern over pricing caused the brand to favour simple construction and materials, resulting in items that were cheaper than Dior, but hardly as desirable.

While demand for some items, like $200 geometric sunglasses or strappy stilettos by shoe designer Amina Muaddi, had been encouraging, the response was far more muted than the singer’s other ventures.

Meanwhile, the cohort of luxury shoppers who had emulated Rihanna’s trademark style — mixing Dior and Saint Laurent with Off-White, Y/Project and Jacquemus — kept on buying from those brands. Wanting to wear the same things as Rihanna and buying them from Rihanna, it turned out, were just not the same thing.

After the project struggled to take off, the brand switched up its design team and brought on a new managing director, Bastien Renard, who joined last year.

But the push to reposition Fenty stalled, as the pandemic pounded fashion sales and threw up logistical challenges for Rihanna and her team. With travelling for in-person meetings increasingly difficult, and the star’s more successful makeup and lingerie businesses based in the US, finding a way forward for Paris-based Fenty fashion made less and less sense.

LVMH too, found that it made more sense to focus its investment on Rihanna’s powers to shift the US mass-market: LVMH-backed private equity firm L Catterton led a $115 million investment round in Rihanna’s lingerie brand, Savage X Fenty, the brand said Wednesday.

Rihanna had teamed up with Goldman Sachs to seek investment in growing the fast-fashion lingerie line, whose body-positive, live-streamed runway shows have received accolades and powered sales. Offering LVMH some exposure to the action at Savage X Fenty allows the luxury group to redirect its investment in Rihanna — as well as having the potential to prevent possible standoffs between duelling fashion ventures should Savage expand into new categories.

While the move to cease operations at Fenty after less than two years was unusually fast — LVMH has a reputation for being patient with stragglers, supporting the likes of loss-making Lacroix for nearly two decades — the group said it remained committed to the “Fenty ecosystem” through beauty and lingerie, and is leaving the door open to potentially reviving Fenty fashion in the future.

The ready-to-wear line is on hold “pending better conditions,” its statement said.

LVMH acquires a 50 percent ownership stake in Jay-Z’s champagne brand Ace of Spades. LVMH Moët Hennessy has acquired a 50 percent ownership stake in Armand de Brignac, the champagne brand owned by Jay-Z that’s otherwise known as “Ace of Spades” due to its logo. Neither Jay-Z or LVMH disclosed financial terms of the transaction, but according to a Jay-Z verse on Meek Mill’s 2018 track “What’s Free,” the company is worth “half a B,” thus valuing LVMH’s stake at $250 million. “I’m proud to welcome the Arnault family into ours,” Jay-Z said in a statement. “It’s a partnership that has felt familiar the entire time. We’re confident that the sheer power of the Moët Hennessy global distribution framework, its unparalleled portfolio strength, and its long-established track record of excellence in developing luxury brands will give Armand de Brignac the commercial power it needs to grow and flourish even further.” The deal shortly follows the launch of Jay-Z’s first marijuana line, called Monogram, that was borne out of a partnership with the California-based cannabis company Caliva. Thomas P. Campbell, former Met CEO, pens a pointed op-ed against museum deaccessioning. In the past few months, a handful of art museums have sold works to raise funds for operating costs. This kind of transaction would have previously been prohibited by the industry watchdog Association of Art Museums Directors (AAMD). Due to the pandemic, however, the AAMD temporarily lifted its jurisdiction for two years, which yielded a recent deaccessioning spree. Last month, for example, the Metropolitan Museum of Art—the largest and arguably most influential institution in the U.S—announced that it was considering selling works to fund maintenance costs of its permanent collection. Thomas B. Campbell, former CEO of the Met and current director of the De Young Museum in San Francisco, penned an op-ed that raises several concerns about the practice. First, he questions whether the AAMD has created circumstances that will eventually normalize deaccessioning. The post-pandemic economic fallout will be felt for years, and it’ll be difficult for the AAMD to halt the practice when museums are still struggling. Second, it remains uncertain how funds will be used for “collection care,” a loosely defined term. Third, it begs donors to question what institutions are doing with their gifts if deaccessioning becomes the norm. Many art-world figures fear that museums will continue to monetize their most valuable works with dire consequences for the communities they serve.

House of One concept in Berlin …

Berlin’s latest place of worship will bring Christians, Jews, and Muslims under one roof. In East Berlin, a new place of worship seeks to bring Christians, Jews, and Muslims under one roof. The House of One will incorporate a church, mosque, and synagogue linked to a central meeting space, and people of other faiths and denominations (or those of no faith) will be invited to attend events anyway. “The idea is pretty simple,” Roland Stolte, a Christian theologian who helped start the project, told The Guardian. “We wanted to build a house of prayer and learning, where these three religions could co-exist while each retaining their own identity. This is not a club for monotheistic religions—we want others to join us.” Designed by Berlin architects Kuehn Malvezzi, the $57 million building will rise on the site of St. Peter’s church in Petriplatz, which was damaged during WWII and demolished in 1964 by GDR authorities. The new interfaith facility has already been dubbed a “churmosquagogue.” Arturo Di Modica, the artist of Manhattan’s famous Charging Bull sculpture dies at 80. Arturo Di Modica, known for sculpting one of the most photogenic works in America, Charging Bull in Lower Manhattan, died after a battle with intestinal cancer at the age of 80. Intended as a present to the country after Black Monday, the day in 1987 the stock market plummeted 20 percent, the Sicilian artist first dropped the 3.5-ton bronze statue near the Stock Exchange illegally in the middle of the night. After paying a fine, Di Modica was allowed to move “Charging Bull” to its current home on a traffic island at the foot of Broadway, where it has drawn millions of tourists. He said at the time that the work symbolized “the future“ and the “strength and determination” of the American people. Di Modica died on Friday at his home in Vittoria, Italy. An artistic interpretation of the Nyan Cat meme sparks a cryptocurrency bidding war. Ten years ago, Chris Torres created Nyan Cat, an animated flying cat with a Pop-Tart body leaving a trail of rainbows. The adorable meme took the internet by storm and has been viewed hundreds of millions of times. Last week, Torres put a one-of-a-kind version of Nyan Cat up for sale on Foundation, a website for selling and buying digital goods. During the sale’s final 60 minutes, a bidding war broke out and Nyan Cat was sold for roughly $580,000 to a user only identified by a cryptocurrency wallet number. The sale marks a new pinnacle in the fast-growing market in the ownership or licensing of digital artworks, ephemera, and media called NFTs or “non-fungible tokens.”

Asbury Beach Club …

Asbury Park, New Jersey, is getting a stylish new beach club inspired by sea caves. The Jersey Shore will welcome a new beach club outfitted with sandy concrete canopies inspired by sea caves. The project brings together a talented cast: Mexican studios Rojkind Arquitectos, Esrawe Studio, and Cadena Concept Design teamed up with American firms Anda Andrei Design and Slade Architecture on the design. “When water, wind, sand, and rocks interact, they alter the morphology of the earth to create niches, cavities, and semi-open spaces interconnecting land and sea,” said Esrawe Studio. Located in the seaside town of Asbury Park, which has experienced a renaissance in recent years, the club will include an elevated pool deck, restaurant, sleek cabanas, an outdoor sand gym, and public amenities such as showers, changing rooms, and restrooms. Tiffany will vacate a giant Trump-owned storefront in Midtown Manhattan next year. Manhattan has been struggling with empty storefronts due to pandemic-induced declines in tourism and foot traffic. Now, the Trump Organization is facing the difficult prospect of filling a major vacancy: a 74,000-square-foot retail space that occupies the first five floors of 6 E. 57th Street, a stone’s throw from Trump Tower. Tiffany & Co temporarily relocated to the space during renovations of its nearby flagship, but plans to move back next year when the revamp wraps up. Wharton Properties and SL Green Realty, the companies that hold the lease at the Trump building, don’t plan to extend it. “Leasing any retail or office space at this point in New York is difficult,” Ruth Colp-Haber, president and CEO of brokerage Wharton Property Advisors, told Crain’s New York. “The building itself, the spaces are really nice. It’s a lot of glass and steel. They’re extremely nice spaces, but for some users there’s definitely a stigma.” That’s putting it nicely: the former president won a mere 12 percent of the Manhattan vote in the 2020 election, and New York City said it would cancel management contracts with the Trump Organization after he was impeached a second time for his role in inciting a deadly riot at the Capitol in January.

The Paris-based luxury goods group revealed on Wednesday that it will shutter its joint venture with Rihanna, at least for the time being, telling WWD, “Rihanna and LVMH have jointly made the decision to put on hold the ready-to-wear activity, pending better conditions.” The announcement comes less than two years after LVMH confirmed growing chatter that it had partnered with the multi-Grammy Award winner and beauty mogul for a luxury-level fashion collection.

The parties are not going their separate ways, though. L Catterton – the LVMH-affiliated private equity firm with stakes in companies like Ganni, Everlane, Giuseppe Zanotti, Third Love, Honest Company, and Equinox, among others – led a recent Series B fundraising round for Savage x Fenty, the 3-year old lingerie label that Rihanna maintains with TechStyle Fashion Group. “Following the completion of a fundraising round where L Catterton has taken a stake into Savage X Fenty, LVMH and Rihanna reaffirm their ambition to concentrate on the growth and the long-term development of Fenty ecosystem focusing on cosmetics, skincare and lingerie,” LVMH and Rihanna stated.

At the same time, LVMH and Rihanna are keeping their Fenty Beauty venture intact, which Rihanna launched with Kendo, LVMH’s incubator for new beauty brands, in September 2017, as well as the subsequently-launched Fenty Skin.

To date, LVMH had failed to make any mention of its ready-to-wear venture with Rihanna in any of its revenue reports, raising questions about the progress of the ambitious tie-up. However, on the heels of reports that LVMH had enlisted former Nike executive Bastien Renard to join its newest fashion brand, LVMH chief financial officer Jean-Jacque Guiony shed some light on the status of the growing fashion brand, saying in October that Fenty was still “work-in-progress.” All the while, LVMH has frequency touted the “exceptional success” of its more than 3-year-old beauty brand with Rihanna, noting in its annual report last month , for instance, that “the new skincare brand Fenty Skin, developed by Rihanna, is off to a very promising start.”

Prior to LVMH’s confirmation of the launch of the Fenty label in May 2019, rumors had been swirling that LVMH and Rihanna were set to expand their partnership beyond her hot-selling Fenty Beauty, which is a joint venture with LVMH, to include a full-fledged fashion line, with the luxury goods group and the multi-hyphenate Grammy winner having engaged in “secret discussions to launch a luxury house under her name” since early that year. In launching the collection, Rihanna became “the first woman to create an original brand at LVMH [and] the first woman of color at the top of an LVMH maison,” the New York Times’ Vanessa Friedman reported at the time.

As for Savage x Fenty, which is a joint venture between Rihanna and Techstyle, the retail group that owns Kate Hudson’s Fabletics and ShoeDazzle, the latest funding rounding comes after the brand raised a reported $50 million in funding in August 2019, which “brought the total amount invested in the company to roughly $70 million,” according to the Wall Street Journal. Thanks to its modern offerings, including a wide range of sizes, the Savage venture has been touted as readily stealing market share from established names like Victoria’s Secret, helping it to bring it sales that, as of 2019, were approaching $150 million and growing.

The new funding will go towards Savage’s next phase of growth in light of an “explosive” rise in revenue over the past year, per LVMH.

LVMH and Rihanna’s Fenty venture, which was slated to “disrupt” the luxury space by way of its regular drops as opposed to adhering to the seasonal approach to fashion, is seemingly a testament to the difficulty that comes with launching a label from scratch, as opposed to acquiring an established name, the latter of which is far more within the wheelhouse of LVMH. As the Times’ stated in connection with its launch in 2019, Fenty was “the first new house created by [LVMH] since Christian Lacroix in 1987,” with LVMH selling off the seemingly underperforming Lacroix label in 2005 in furtherance of what it called its “strategy of focusing on those leading brands with the highest growth potential.”

Instead of founding new brands, LVMH has captured the title of the world’s largest luxury goods group by aggressively acquiring luxury names, dating back to 1984 when LVMH chairman Bernard Arnault purchased Boussac in a quest to get his hands on Christian Dior, which was owned by the ailing textile company. The outlier here appears to be Rihanna’s Fenty Beauty (and maybe the newly-launched Fenty Skincare brand). The brands and their well-priced and effectively-targeted products have flourished, likely due to enduring demand for cosmetics – as opposed to apparel – in light of the pandemic, as well as the more accessible nature of cosmetics, which has likely helped the Fenty brands find favor among younger consumers that are not yet ready to shell out on pricey luxury goods.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9973549842834473}",neutral,0.9973549842834473,0

Per reports from both Women’s Wear Daily and Business of Fashion on Wednesday, LVMH and Rihanna have come to an agreement in which the Fenty maison will be closed. In a statement to WWD, an LVMH rep said the luxury conglomerate and the proven multi-hyphenate “have jointly made the decision to put on hold the RTW activity, based in Europe, pending better conditions.”

While that statement implies a temporary nature to the decision, Wednesday’s reports point to this development as a definitive halt for the luxury Fenty house, though it’s also mentioned that both LVMH and Rihanna “haven’t ruled out taking a second run” at a luxury maison in the future.

Complex has reached out to a rep for LVMH and will update this post accordingly.

LVMH and Rihanna first unveiled the luxury maison in 2019. At the time, Rihanna called designing the inaugural line “an incredibly special moment” for the team.

“Mr. Arnault has given me a unique opportunity to develop a fashion house in the luxury sector, with no artistic limits,” she said in May of that year. “I couldn’t imagine a better partner both creatively and business-wise, and I’m ready for the world to see what we have built together.”

The historic Fenty house was the first one LVMH had launched from scratch since way back in 1987 with Christian Lacroix.

LVMH, per this report, will focus further on Rihanna’s Fenty Beauty and Fenty Skin elements, as well as get involved with Savage X Fenty. Meanwhile, L Catterton—in which LVMH, notably, has a stake—is now the leading investor in the latter as part of a push for retail expansion.

A Fast Company exclusive report, meanwhile, adds that Savage X Fenty has bagged $115 million in Series B funding from L Catterton, which effectively brings the brand’s valuation to more than $1 billion.

The billionaire multi-hyphenate has entered a deal with luxury giant LVMH in a bid to take his high-end Champagne global.

The 51-year-old, whose given name is Shawn Carter, announced Monday that he had sold a 50 percent stake in Armand de Brignac to LVMH’s Moët Hennessy for an undisclosed sum. The partnership will capitalize on Moët Hennessy’s vast international network, as well as its resources within the Champagne region.

“We are confident that the sheer power of the Moët Hennessy global distribution framework, its unparalleled portfolio strength and its long-established track record of excellence in developing luxury brands will give Armand de Brignac the commercial power it needs to grow and flourish even further,” Carter said in a statement.

Established in 2006, the Armand de Brignac maison, often referred to as the “Ace of Spades,” is one of the youngest in the storied sparkling wine region. It’s known for its glitzy gold bottles of upscale sparkling which are typically priced between $300 and $950. Some rare vintages can net up to $100,000 apiece.

The “99 Problems” emcee has been with Armand de Brignac since the beginning and debuted its signature gold bottles in his “Show Me What You Got” music video in 2006. He started with a 50 percent stake in the Champagne house before acquiring it fully in 2014. Since then, Armand de Brignac has enjoyed a great deal of success. In 2019, it sold more than half a million bottles and has also developed a strong presence in North America, Asia and Europe.

Still, the president and CEO of Moët Hennessy, Philippe Schaus, says the partnership will “take the business to new heights across the world.” Indeed, LVMH is the world’s biggest producer of Champagne and currently oversees a spate of legendary houses, including Veuve Clicquot, Dom Pérignon, Mercier, Ruinart and Moët Hennessy to name but a few. And even as LVMH’s wines and spirits sales fell 15 percent in 2020 due to the Covid-19 pandemic, its 23 houses still managed to collectively pull in about €4.8 billion (or $5.8 billion) in revenue last year.

WATCH

The move comes on the heels of LVMH’s recent collaboration with Rhianna for the cosmetics line Fenty Beauty and is another example of how billionaire CEO Bernard Arnault is looking for ways to expand and diversify his portfolio to appeal to a wider clientele.

The 50-50 partnership between Jay-Z and Moët Hennessy is designed to ensure that each partner is represented equally.

“We are going into this partnership on equal terms together with Jay-Z and his family and with the same conviction that we are only at the beginning of a wonderful story,” adds Schaus. “Together, we will lay a strong path forward to firmly cement Armand de Brignac as a luxury icon for current and future generations of customers.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9785309433937073}",neutral,0.9785309433937073,0
Rihanna and LVMH Pause Fenty Fashion House - PEOPLE,"Wed, 10 Feb 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vcGVvcGxlLmNvbS9zdHlsZS9yaWhhbm5hLWFuZC1sdm1oLXBhdXNlLWZlbnR5LWZhc2hpb24taG91c2Uv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Rihanna and French luxury conglomerate LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton have mutually agreed to pause the singer and entrepreneur's Fenty ready-to-wear label, according to multiple reports.

LVMH confirmed the news in a statement to WWD: ""Rihanna and LVMH have jointly made the decision to put on hold the RTW activity, based in Europe, pending better conditions.""

According to the outlet's sources, a small staff are wrapping things up at Fenty's headquarters in Paris.

The news comes on the same day as the announcement that Rihanna's lingerie line, Savage X Fenty, has ""completed a $115 million Series B fundraising round"" led by L Catterton (the largest global consumer-focused private equity firm) to ""support the company's rapid growth and upcoming expansion into retail,"" a press release states.

""In two short years, Savage X Fenty has achieved remarkable success by disrupting the intimates category,"" Jon Owsley, Co-Managing Partner of L Catterton's Growth Fund, said in the release. ""The brand strikes a unique balance between affordability, fashion, and comfort, stands deeply for inclusivity and diversity, and has differentiated itself by building an extraordinary level of affinity and unmatched customer loyalty. We believe the opportunities ahead for Savage X Fenty are enormous, and we look forward to leveraging our extensive experience in scaling digitally-native consumer brands and partnering with Rihanna, Christiane, Natalie, and the entire Savage X Fenty team to help the Company realize its full potential.""

The singer turned fashion and beauty mogul, 32, made history when she inked a deal with LVMH in May 2019, becoming ""the first woman to create an original brand at LVMH and the first woman of color at the top of an LVMH maison,"" according to the The New York Times reported.

Rihanna's successful Fenty line joined their powerhouse lineup of brands which include Céline, Dior, Givenchy and Fendi among many more.

""Designing a line like this with LVMH is an incredibly special moment for us,"" the star said in the statement. ""Mr. Arnault has given me a unique opportunity to develop a fashion house in the luxury sector, with no artistic limits. I couldn't imagine a better partner both creatively and business-wise, and I'm ready for the world to see what we have built together.""

Rihanna reflected on this major career achievement in a touching Tweet posted this morning, writing, ""big day for the culture. thank you Mr. Arnault for believing in this little girl from the left side of an island, and for giving me the opportunity to grow with you at @LVMH.""

After the success of their first collaborative project Fenty Beauty (which sent shock waves through the makeup world by releasing 40 inclusive shades of foundation in 2017), LVMH Chairman Bernard Arnault said in a statement, ""Everybody knows Rihanna as a wonderful singer, but through our partnership at Fenty Beauty, I discovered a true entrepreneur, a real C.E.O. and a terrific leader.""

He added, ""She naturally finds her full place within LVMH. To support Rihanna to start up the Fenty Maison, we have built a talented and multicultural team supported by the Group resources.""","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9971011281013489}",positive,0.9971011281013489,1
Birkenstock Sells Majority Stake to LVMH-Affiliated Investors - WWD,"Fri, 26 Feb 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3dkLmNvbS9mZWF0dXJlL2JpcmtlbnN0b2NrLXNlbGxzLW1ham9yaXR5LXN0YWtlLXRvLWx2bWgtYWZmaWxpYXRlZC1pbnZlc3RvcnMtMTIzNDc1MTg5Ny_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"One of Germany’s best-known footwear brands, Birkenstock, is selling a majority stake to the American-French private equity firm L Catterton and an affiliated firm, Financière Agache, Bernard Arnault’s family investment company.

Financial terms were not disclosed. WWD had reported Feb. 8 that Birkenstock was in exclusive talks with L Catterton for a deal valuing the firm at 4 billion euros.

The two remaining relatives of the founder of the company, Christian and Alex Birkenstock, said they entered “this strategic partnership after carefully examining all options.”

They said the sale would “further strong growth in future growth markets such as China and India” and that the new partners would invest in German sites and expand production, logistics and sales operations. “At the same time, the company plans to invest in the further development of its direct-to-consumer business and the expansion of its e-commerce platforms,” Birkenstock said in a statement.

Although Birkenstocks’ new connection to Arnault’s LVMH, is indirect — that is, via L Catterton — there is potential for greater collaboration between the luxury giant and the German footwear brand.

A leader in the luxury market, LVMH has a market capitalization of 266 billion euros. Its global presence and stable of brands and companies connect Birkenstock to various possibilities, everything from more of the savvy designer collaborations with the likes of Valentino, Rick Owens and Proenza Schouler that have brought the company so much attention over recent years, to a slot in the duty-free sector, thanks to LVMH’s DFS subsidiary.

Birkenstock has also dabbled in other lifestyle products, including a line of signature beds and a range of natural cosmetics.

Market watchers have suggested that Birkenstock may develop the same way German luggage brand Rimowa has since LVMH bought a majority stake from that family-owned brand’s heirs for 640 million euros in 2016. Since then, LVMH has pushed Rimowa toward more designer collaborations, including with streetwear stalwarts such as Supreme and Off-White, as well as with LVMH stablemate Dior, and opened more Rimowa stores.

L Catterton is a partnership between the original U.S. investment firm Catterton and Arnault’s LVMH and Groupe Arnault, formed in 2016. It describes itself as “the largest, diversified consumer-dedicated private equity firm in the world” and has more than $22 billion under management, with stakes in a wide variety of firms, including Everlane, Ba&sh, Intercos Group, Sweaty Betty and more. L Catterton recently snapped up JOTT, a French maker of puffer jackets.

The Birkenstock brothers, who will stay on with the company and hold a minority share, praised their new business partners for “a deep understanding of the details of a manufacturing business that is all about quality and a respect for brands with a long heritage like ours.”

“We truly appreciate brands with this long heritage,” Arnault said in a statement. “Together we will provide support to the business so it can fully realize its significant growth potential.”

Birkenstock reported revenues of 720 million euros in 2019. In Friday’s statement, Birkenstock said it is “performing better than ever before in its 250-year history and reported “another record year” despite the coronavirus pandemic.

Certainly Birkenstock, which produces around 24 million pairs of shoes per year, has been one of the winners of lockdowns everywhere. Between April and June in 2020, searches for the brand’s distinctive sandals rose 225 percent, according to online fashion search engine Lyst.

A Birkenstock spokesperson noted that the brand has grown steadily over the last decade: “Sure, the lockdown and home office has given us a boost. But Birkenstock was beloved before the pandemic, and we believe we will be after the pandemic, too.”

Birkenstock on Friday said it will sell a majority stake in its business to L Catteron, a private equity firm backed by LVMH, owner of high-end fashion brands like Louis Vuitton and Christian Dior.

French billionaire and LVMH boss Bernard Arnault is also taking part in the deal, as is his family investment fund Financiere Agache. Terms of the sale weren’t disclosed, but it reportedly values the German family-owned footwear business at $4.85 billion.

While the maker of clunky sandals may not seem an obvious fit for LVMH, the investment comes as the luxe goods maker has been looking to increase its appeal among young people.

The owner of Moet Hennessy this week said it scooped up a 50-percent stake in Jay Z’s Armand de Brignac champagne brand.

And while its put its 2019 deal with Rihanna to create fashion for Fenty on hold “pending better conditions,” L Catterton has taken a stake in the pop singer’s lingerie line.

Birkenstock has a huge built in following that has only grown over the past year, in which it generated record sales, the company said.

The deal is aimed at helping Birkenstock expand into China and India as well as expand its e-commerce business, the company said in a statement.

Relatives of the founding family, brothers Alex and Christian Birkenstock, will remain with the company along with the Birkenstock management, the company said.

“Birkenstock was founded nearly 250 years ago and has grown to become one of the few iconic brands in the footwear industry. We truly appreciate brands with this long heritage,” Arnault said in a statement.

Birkenstock “is a brand that defines a category and is the classic, iconic brand for it,” Richard Kestenbaum, a partner at Triangle Capital told The Post. “That has to be appealing to LVMH and the way they think about brands even it’s not strictly luxury as its generally defined.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9998921155929565}",neutral,0.9998921155929565,0
Rihanna & LVMH Are Shutting Down Fenty - Highsnobiety,"Wed, 10 Feb 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiOGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhpZ2hzbm9iaWV0eS5jb20vcC9yaWhhbm5hLWZlbnR5LWx2bWgtY2xvc2Uv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Rihanna and LVMH are shutting down Fenty, the singer's luxury Maison. ""Rihanna and LVMH have jointly made the decision to put on hold the RTW activity, based in Europe, pending better conditions,"" an LVMH statement confirmed to WWD.

The e-commerce site will close down in a few weeks, while some staff will remain at the Paris headquarters to shut down the rest of the business. The move comes during the pandemic, which kept Rihanna from the Fenty team in Europe, but enabled her to remain close with the U.S.-based Fenty brands; Fenty Beauty, Fenty Skin, and Savage x Fenty.

It'll be interesting to see whether the Fenty RTW brand will ever reopen, or whether Rihanna would ever re-launch without LVMH — after all, she is the real brand here. Rihanna has 90 million Instagram followers, she can do whatever the fuck she wants. She has more than enough global clout to work with whoever she wants, whenever she wants. She could even completely go it alone, should she so desire.

Rihanna is still working with LVMH though — now the partnership is prioritizing Fenty Beauty and Fenty Skin, as well as working on new projects. Savage x Fenty is also expanding, after a $115 million Series B fundraising round to expand its retail operations. The move also marks LVMH’s first involvement with the lingerie brand, after investments by L Catterton (LVMH's private equity arm).

Launched in May 2019, Fenty was the first luxury group to be built from scratch since launching Christian Lacroix in 1987. It was also the first time a woman launched an original label at LVMH, as well as the first time a black woman led an LVMH fashion house.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999803304672241}",neutral,0.9999803304672241,0

The luxury conglomerate announced the collaboration with the music superstar and business mogul in 2019, subsequently introducing seasonal sportswear collections to great fanfare. But, according to reports, sales for the high-end line did not match the buzz.

“Rihanna and LVMH have jointly made the decision to put on hold the RTW activity, based in Europe, pending better conditions,” reads a statement by LVMH, per WWD.

The news of Fenty’s closure, however, isn’t the end of LVMH’s partnership with Rihanna. The company has seen strong sales with Fenty Beauty and Fenty Skin, which is operated under LVMH’s Kendo Holdings, Inc. Rihanna’s lingerie label, Savage x Fenty, which was launched with TechStyle Fashion Group in 2018, has also performed well in the market. Most recently, the intimates brand received $115 million in Series B from equity firm L Catterton, which has ties to LVMH.

“Lingerie is about celebrating your body and that’s what Savage is all about,” said Rihanna in a statement about the investment. “Savage to me is such a powerful word. It’s about being confident, in charge, and taking ownership of our choices. This brand is a home, a hub and a safe space for everyone—regardless of shape, size, ethnicity, gender identity or sexual orientation. It is a representation of all and a validation that everyone is beautiful no matter what.”

The Fenty fashion collection largely consisted of oversized jumpers, matching trousers, hoodies, leather skirts, sweater and shirtdresses, denim, and eyewear, and was sold primarily on the brand’s website, along with pop-ups at Bergdorf Goodman, Galeries Lafayette Champs-Élysées, and Selfridges. Celebrities, including Bella Hadid and Cara Delevingne, were regularly seen in pieces from the collection. It also launched a shoe line with designer Amina Muaddi in November 2020. But as of January 2021, Fenty’s Instagram account ceased updates, and the e-commerce platform is said to follow in the coming weeks.

This wasn’t the launch of just any celebrity fashion line; the last time the world’s largest luxury conglomerate, which is home to Dior, Louis Vuitton, and Celine, launched a major brand from scratch was in 1987, with the namesake label of the legendary couturier Christian Lacroix. What’s more, Rihanna became the first woman to create an original LVMH brand, and the first-ever woman of color to ever helm one of its maisons.

Now, less than two years later, Rihanna is moving on. She and LVMH have agreed to put things at Fenty on pause. “Rihanna and LVMH have jointly made the decision to put on hold the RTW activity, based in Europe, pending better conditions,” the latter told WWD in a statement on Wednesday. While it didn’t offer any reasons, fans have been disappointed in the label’s high price range since its first drop, which ranged from $200 to $1,500.

Rihanna has had so much going on—Fenty Beauty, Fenty Skin, Savage x Fenty, and soon even a cookbook—that few spotted the warning signs. Whereas Fenty drops once seemed to happen almost constantly, the last one was in November of 2020, and was as simple as a footwear collaboration with Amina Muaddi. The skeleton staff at Fenty’s headquarters in Paris will continue to phase out, and the e-commerce site that’s served as Fenty’s hub is expected to shutter within the next few weeks. As for the rest of its online presence, well, the official Fenty Instagram account hasn’t posted since January 1, 2021.

There’s a good chance that some of Rihanna’s loyal fanbase may consider the news a boon. Her plate may still be full to the brim, but one less project on the docket means just a tad more availability to work on and release new music—something the singer hasn’t done since her beloved album Anti in 2016. In fact, the singer had recently signaled that more music, which she’s “always working on,” may be on its way: This year 2021 “is a little unknown for everybody, and nobody is sure what restrictions there are going to be,” she told the tabloid Closer in December. “My creativity is within my control though, and I want to take my music and my brands to a different level.”

Still, the Navy may not want to get their hopes too high just yet. WWD reports that LVMH now plans to concentrate on Fenty Beauty and Fenty Skin, which it also owns. And then there’s Savage x Fenty: The mega private equity company L Catteron (which LVMH has a stake in) just put $115 million into a retail expansion of the lingerie line that Rihanna launched in 2018.

Rihanna pauses her Fenty line with LVMH while refocusing on Savage x Fenty lingerie. Less than two years after Rihanna debuted Fenty, her luxury maison backed by LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, the popstar-turned-designer announced she will pause the label while doubling down on her Savage x Fenty lingerie line that recently secured $115 million in new funding. LVMH confirmed the news with a brief statement: “Rihanna and LVMH have jointly made the decision to put on hold the ready-to-wear activity, based in Europe, pending better conditions.” According to sources, a small staff remains at Fenty’s Paris headquarters to wind down operations, and the e-commerce site will go dark by the end of February. LVMH plans to concentrate instead on Fenty Beauty, Fenty Skin, and her successful lingerie venture, which experienced 200 percent revenue growth last year alone. The decision may be informed by the coronavirus: lockdown grounded Rihanna in Los Angeles, where her beauty and skin operations are located, but distanced from her fashion venture in Europe. LVMH and Rihanna haven’t ruled out reviving the maison in the future since it attracted repeat customers—predominantly professional, high-net-worth women—in its two-year lifespan, but others remain skeptical. “I have the impression that celebrity-originated brands can be very popular very quickly,” Luca Solca, a luxury goods analyst at Bernstein, tells WWD, “but that their staying power is questionable.” The Frick Collection will open in Marcel Breuer’s modernist landmark on March 18. The Frick Collection is preparing to open in the Breuer building as the Frick Madison while its 1914 Gilded Age mansion on Fifth Avenue undergoes renovation. The brutalist Upper East Side building—formerly the site of the Met Breuer and the Whitney Museum of American Art—will open at 25 percent capacity Thursday through Sundays starting on March 18. The permanent collection will be organized chronologically by region across three floors, showcasing works gathered by the industrialist Henry Clay Frick, and featuring paintings and sculptures by Bellini, Goya, Rembrandt, and Velázquez, among others. While specific details have yet to be announced, programming will include the decorative arts, 17th-century Mughal carpets, and Jean-Honoré Fragonard’s series “The Progress of Love,” with the original four panels created for Madame du Barry. Back at home, Annabelle Selldorf’s renovation, which was approved in 2018 after much controversy, is expected to be completed in 2023.

National Assembly of Benin by Kéré Architecture …

Kéré Architecture shares a palaver tree–inspired design for the National Assembly of Benin. Initial visuals of the forthcoming National Assembly of Benin have been unveiled by Kéré Architecture, a Berlin-based firm known for its sustainable and cultural work in remote locations. Situated in Porto-Novo, the capital of the West African nation of Benin, the building pays homage to the tradition of gathering under the native tree and is meant to symbolize the country’s current democratic values. The orthogonal structure’s courtyard layout includes loggia-like pavilions, a communal green space, roof terrace, and an assembly hall. “The Benin National Assembly marks an important next step for our studio,” says principal Francis Kéré. “This project gives shape to our ideas about community gathering, the importance of indigenous forms of governance, and what contemporary African architecture can be on a national scale. I’m honored by the trust that has been placed in us, and am grateful that together we can build a new house of democracy for the Republic of Benin.” The project is slated for completion in 2023. Simone Leigh and six other artists will create works that address the idea of public monuments. Seven artists were asked to make works on the subject of monumentality for this year’s edition of Prospect New Orleans. The contemporary art triennial, which emphasizes site-specificity and collaborative partnerships, is slated to open in October after being postponed from last fall. A $2 million grant from the Mellon Foundation will sponsor the seven works—by Simone Leigh, Adriana Corral, EJ Hill, Glenn Ligon, Dave McKenzie, Anastasia Pelias, and Nari Ward—to be featured in a new curatorial exhibition, “Monuments: A Proposal.” Taking its name from Leigh’s project, it’s meant to provoke thought about the mutability of monuments, something the director of Prospect’s fifth edition, Nick Stillman, hopes the exhibition can do overarchingly. “Maybe monuments shouldn’t be fixed. Maybe they are things that need to be ephemeral because we’re such a rapidly changing society,” Stillman tells Artnet News. “I don’t think that feeling is going to go away anytime soon.” Full details have yet to be announced, but Stillman disclosed a few hints: Ward will devise a mobile artwork with a police siren, McKenzie plans to build a memorial for his late father, and Hill’s ambitious project repurposes a local ferris wheel for a performance piece.

Prosthetic hand by John Amanam …

The Nigerian artist John Amanam is pioneering prosthetic limbs for darker skin tones. For amputees of color, the reality of living with a limb or body part in an opposite tone to their natural skin is very real. Until recently, the BIPOC community has been almost altogether sidelined by international prosthetics markets that primarily cater to white patients. That is until recently, when the 33-year-old sculptor and former movie special effects artist John Amanam who hails from the Uyo, Nigeria, set out to change this inequality three years ago and quickly became a pioneer in designing hyper-realistic Black prosthesis. Spanning prosthetic hands, fingers, legs, toes, ears, noses, and breasts, his awe-inspiring work was so rare that he was able to file a patent of his innovations in Nigeria last year. Amanam attributes his dedication to his work after his brother lost his hand in an accident, and, at that time, Black prosthetics were not available in Nigeria. “I quickly discovered that I was the only one around making Black prostheses; not only in Nigeria but in the whole region,” he says. A new initiative aims to increase the percentage of Black real estate agents and homeowners. A new program aims to diversify the real estate industry, which is fewer than six percent Black and only nine percent Hispanic, compared to nearly 75 percent white. National Association of Real Estate Brokers (NAREB) is seeking to change that by launching a new partnership with real estate platform HomeLight to increase the number of Black real estate agents in the United States. The initiative will provide financial and educational support to aspiring agents, with the goal of closing the income and racial gap while increasing Black homeownership rates. “In July 2019, the reported Black American homeownership rate of 40.6 percent hit a historic low in the United States; a Black homeownership rate nearly mirroring the rate at the time of the passage of the Fair Housing Act in 1968,” says Antoine Thompson, NAREB’s executive director. “In comparison, the rate reported for non-Hispanic White Americans for the same period in 2019 was reported at 73.1 percent—a more than 30 percentage wealth gap.” The Indian activist Amar Singh will donate $5 million of art by minorities to museums by 2025. In his short but illustrious career, the activist Amar Singh has already helped legalize homosexuality in India, champion women’s rights through his namesake art gallery, and landed on Forbes’ 30 Under 30 list for his contributions to art and culture. Now, Singh has pledged to donate more than $5 million worth of art by female, LGBTQ+, and other minority artists to museums by 2025. “Museums are safe-keepers of culture and humanity,” Singh tells Vanity Fair, “but the reality is that they’ve historically failed us. They have not represented humanity across the board.” Already backing up his words with actions, Singh recently gave a Mario Berrio painting to LACMA and a portrait of the Inauguration poet Amanda Gorman by the artist Raphael Adjetey Adjey Maybe to the permanent collection of Harvard University’s Hutchins Centre for African & African American Research. Adds Singh: “Art matters and museums need patrons who aren’t just going to donate dots by Damien Hirst.”

LVMH Enters 50-50 Partnership With Jay-Z on Ace of Spades Champagne - WWD,"Mon, 22 Feb 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiQFodHRwczovL3d3ZC5jb20vYnVzaW5lc3MtbmV3cy9tZXJnZXJzLWFjcXVpc2l0aW9ucy9sdm1oLWJ1eXMtNTAtcGVyY2VudC1qYXktei1jaGFtcGFnbmUtYnJhbmQtYXJtYW5kLWRlLWJyaWduYWMtYWNlLW9mLXNwYWRlcy0xMjM0NzQxNTE0L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS — It seems that Jay-Z is having the last laugh in the Champagne battles.

Fifteen years after founding his Armand de Brignac prestige range following a public spat with the owner of Cristal Champagne, the entertainment mogul has sold a 50 percent stake in the company to LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, joining a portfolio of prestigious brands including Dom Pérignon, Moët & Chandon, Ruinart, Krug and Veuve Clicquot.

With the partnership, which includes a global distribution agreement, LVMH is cementing its ties with the entertainment industry, and extending its reach into the high end of the Champagne market, after a year in which sales of French bubbly fell by a fifth due to the coronavirus pandemic. Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed.

The deal represents the ultimate seal of approval from a traditionally conservative and insular milieu, where Shawn “Jay-Z” Carter made waves with his striking gold bottles decorated with pewter Ace of Spades labels, appealing to a global and diverse customer base.

Philippe Schaus, chief executive officer of Moët Hennessy, the wines and spirits division of LVMH, said the luxury conglomerate headed by mega-billionaire Bernard Arnault was impressed by Armand de Brignac’s ability to challenge the rules of the Champagne category.

“We had been following its success over the last few years and we thought, this is crazy. Most Champagne brands see very modest growth, and he was just shooting up through the ranks,” he told WWD in an interview in Moët Hennessy’s new offices located above the LVMH-owned department store Le Bon Marché.

Following an introduction from Arnault’s son Alexandre, who was recently named head of product and communications at U.S. jeweler Tiffany & Co., Bernard Arnault and Schaus met with Carter at his $88 million mansion in Los Angeles.

“We tasted the Champagne and we said, yes, there is something to be done together, because obviously he doesn’t have the same distribution network as Moët Hennessy,” Schaus recalled.

“We are already global leaders with our prestige Champagne brands — Dom Pérignon, Krug and the prestige cuvées of Veuve Clicquot and Ruinart — but Armand de Brignac has created another niche and in some respects revolutionized the prestige category, so we wanted to be part of that,” he added. “They opened Champagne to a new clientele, so in that sense, it’s a great complement to our portfolio.”

In an internal video aimed at Moët Hennessy’s teams, Carter said the partnership felt like a natural next step.

“I couldn’t think of anyone else or a better partner for this brand, Armand, that we built from scratch,” he said. “When we started this, the only goal was to build something that would last longer than us, stand the test of time, build something of the utmost class and taste, so you guys are perfect partners.”

Under the 50-50 structure of the deal, Carter and Moët Hennessy will have equal say in future decision-making.

“We’re super excited to take this brand to the next level, as well as other ideas,” Carter said. “We’re excited and can’t wait to meet you guys in person, and looking forward to learning and hopefully bringing some new energy into the building as well. Partnership, you know, works both ways.”

In addition to his career as a rapper, producer and head of entertainment firm Roc Nation, Carter has business interests in sectors ranging from clothing to sports and cannabis products, among others. Though he was widely reported to have purchased Armand de Brignac in 2014, he has been an investor in the brand since its inception.

It all started after Frédéric Rouzaud, managing director of Louis Roederer Champagne, was asked in an interview with The Economist in 2006 whether the popularity of its Cristal brand among rappers could hurt the image of the drink. “That’s a good question, but what can we do? We can’t forbid people from buying it. I’m sure Dom Pérignon or Krug would be delighted to have their business,” he said.

Carter responded by banning Cristal from his 40/40 Club sports bar in New York City. “I view his comments as racist and will no longer support any of his products through any of my various brands,” he was reported as saying at the time. To emphasize the point, that year’s video for “Show Me What You Got” showed Carter sending away a bottle of Cristal, as an assistant proffers a bottle of Armand de Brignac.

Carter never appeared in ads for the brand, instead opting for organic placements — like his appearance with his wife Beyoncé at the Golden Globes last year, when his bodyguard carried several bottles of its signature Brut Gold, which retails for $320 a bottle. Ironically, Moët & Chandon is a longtime official sponsor of the event.

“Jay-Z never put himself forward. In fact, the majority of consumers are not aware that Jay-Z is the owner of the brand,” Schaus said. “He operates behind the scenes. He really orchestrated the brand, he developed it. He made sure it was in the right places at the right time.”

On Instagram, Armand de Brignac markets itself as the #DrinkofChampions, and is pictured in the hands of sports stars like LeBron James, celebrating the Los Angeles Lakers’ 2020 NBA championship win, and Megan Rapinoe, toasting the 2019 World Cup victory of the U.S. women’s national soccer team.

“Jay-Z likes to say that the Champagne itself is like a winner’s cup,” Schaus said.

There are four other cuvées in the range — a Rosé, a Demi Sec, a Blanc de Blancs and a Blanc de Noirs — with prices going up to $800, making it twice as expensive on average as Dom Pérignon, the market leader in the prestige Champagne segment, according to Schaus. Armand de Brignac also produces the world’s largest bottle of Champagne, the 30-liter Midas, weighing almost 100 pounds.

Unlike Dom Pérignon, which produces millésimes for particular years, Armand de Brignac is made using a blend of three different grape varieties from several years. Production is in the hands of Cattier, a Champagne house run by the same family for 13 generations.

“Each bottle is finished by hand with the application of French pewter labels and hand polishing. A small and highly skilled team of just 18 people touch a bottle from pressing the fruit to departure from the cellars in France,” the brand said in a joint statement with Moët Hennessy.

The label sells 500,000 bottles a year worldwide. North America and Asia account for around a third each, with Europe representing a little less. By comparison, LVMH sold 64.7 million bottles in 2019. Schaus declined to give a figure for 2020, but said Moët Hennessy performed slightly better than the Champagne sector as a whole, which saw sales fall by 20 percent.

“Every market was down except for the United States, but significantly less than one might have expected,” he said, noting that people switched to drinking at home. Organic revenues in LVMH’s wines and spirits division declined by 14 percent last year to 4.7 billion euros, while profit from recurring operations was down 20 percent to 1.4 billion euros.

The group’s partnership with Carter comes as a growing number of celebrities launch their own alcoholic beverages. Cameron Diaz, Post Malone, Snoop Dogg and Kylie Minogue are among those who have entered the wine business, while Kendall Jenner, Nick Jonas and Dwayne Johnson recently launched tequila brands in the hopes of emulating the success of George Clooney, and Cindy Crawford’s husband Rande Gerber, who sold their Casamigos brand to drinks giant Diageo in 2017 for $1 billion.

LVMH has also sought to add some celebrity glitz to its operations in recent years, temporarily appointing Lenny Kravitz as creative director of Dom Pérignon in 2018 — not to mention its partnership with Rihanna on a cosmetics range and a clothing line, though the latter has since been paused. Schaus said the growing involvement of celebrities was “super positive” for the category.

“The wines and spirits market is increasingly cool, whereas before, it was seen as somewhat dusty and conventional,” he remarked. “The fact that all these people are taking an interest in the sector is terrific. Through their investment and the energy they are putting into it, they are giving visibility to the category. That’s also very positive. Having said that, not everyone is pursuing the same degree of excellence.”

While it was initially distributed mainly through nightclubs, Armand de Brignac is now available in selected restaurants and wine stores, and has received positive reviews from industry publications, the executive noted.

“They have very good ratings, they are respected as winemakers,” he said, countering those who have caricatured Ace of Spades as the hip-hop Champagne.

“It’s much more than that. It’s a Champagne that represents success, power, high energy and celebrating life. We’ve had many discussions with Jay-Z about the fact that for him, it represents success, in particular his success as a self-made man. He’s always wanted the best of everything. He wants the best cars, the best watches, the best houses — and naturally, the best Champagne,” Schaus said.

“He never thought it would become such a big brand. He didn’t create this brand to make money. He did it because he loves Champagne and he wanted to develop a brand that reflected his pursuit of excellence,” he added, popping the cork on a bottle of Brut Gold. “You can’t talk about Champagne without tasting it, as I’m sure you will agree. It would be just absurd,” he said with a smile.

Since LVMH will only be able to ramp up physical production gradually, given the minimum aging period of three years for the Champagne, its focus initially will be on ensuring Armand de Brignac is available in all the right places — including, presumably, the properties of its luxury travel division Belmond, which include the Venice Simplon-Orient-Express train and hotels such as the Copacabana Palace in Rio de Janeiro.

“Our dream customers are high-net-worth individuals who will choose Armand de Brignac to treat themselves, to celebrate and to express themselves through the daring choice of an exceptional bottle of Champagne,” he said. “It’s unique. No other bottle in the entire wines and spirits sector looks like it, so when you take a picture of yourself with Armand de Brignac, you’re sure to be recognized as discerning.”

The deal is set to reverberate beyond the company’s Champagne division.

“We are extremely pleased with this partnership. It is intellectually enriching and will help us understand different ways to market and develop a brand. What Jay-Z and his teams have done is absolutely exceptional and breaks the mold for marketing wines and spirits,” Schaus said. “Beyond the project itself, it also injects modernity and energy into Moët Hennessy and LVMH.”

How Did Birkenstock Become a Luxury Brand? - InsideHook,"Fri, 26 Feb 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmluc2lkZWhvb2suY29tL3N0eWxlL2JpcmtlbnN0b2NrLWFjcXVpcmVkLWJlcm5hcmQtYXJuYXVsdC1sdm1o0gFOaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuaW5zaWRlaG9vay5jb20vc3R5bGUvYmlya2Vuc3RvY2stYWNxdWlyZWQtYmVybmFyZC1hcm5hdWx0LWx2bWgvYW1w?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Once looked down upon by the fashion elite, German sandal maker Birkenstock now finds itself in the company of Louis Vuitton and Givenchy, as a majority stake of the brand estimated at some $4.87 billion has been acquired by Bernard Arnault, the man behind the luxury behemoth LVMH. Owners Christian and Alex Birkenstock sold more than half the firm to Financière Agache, the Arnault family’s holding company, and L Catterton, the private-equity formed co-owned by Arnault.

The acquisition speaks to the often fickle nature of the fashion industry, and how an item once all but shunned can quickly become “in.” It wasn’t long ago that the Birkenstock was worn almost exclusively by outdoorsy and granola types, derided by the industry as decidedly ugly. The tides eventually turned when the “ugliness” of the shoe was deemed chic, and designers began offering their own high-end interpretations of the sandal.

In recent years the brand has collaborated with a range of luxury designers and streetwear brands, including Rick Owens, Valentino and Stüssy, further cementing the shoes as a fashion darling. Couple this popularity with the surge in searches the brand has experienced as a result of the coronavirus and it’s no wonder the investment proved so alluring not only to Arnault but private equity group CVC Capital, who also made a competing bid.

According to an article from The Wall Street Journal, Birkenstock made the deal with the belief that it would allow the brand’s business to grow in places like India and China, as well as further expand its breadth of products that extend beyond shoes and includes everything from skincare to mattresses. The effects of the brand’s newfound proximity to luxury remains to be seen, but it’s suffice to say that Birks are officially en vogue.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9998834133148193}",neutral,0.9998834133148193,0
Why Rihanna's luxury collaboration with LVMH failed - Yahoo Finance,"Wed, 10 Feb 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy93aHktcmloYW5uYS1sdXh1cnktY29sbGFib3JhdGlvbi1sdm1oLTE4NTEwNjk5OS5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Pop superstar Rihanna poses in a pop-up store to present her first collection with LVMH for the new label, Fenty, in 2019

It was big news in 2019 when LVMH announced it was teaming with Rihanna to create a full-fledged fashion line called Fenty. A clear sign of the times, it was the first instance of the luxury powerhouse partnering with a celebrity, or a woman of color, to launch a brand from scratch. Rihanna, of course, would bring her megawatt style and stardom. LVMH would provide the know-how it accumulated from decades of building brands such as Louis Vuitton and Dior.

Not quite two years later, LVMH and Rihanna told trade outlet WWD (paywall) they’re putting the clothing line on pause “pending better conditions.” LVMH confirmed the news in a statement to Quartz.

Despite the success of Rihanna’s previous forays into makeup and lingerie, the fashion line never generated the same excitement or quite found its place in the market. Fenty Beauty, her cosmetics brand, attracted customers by catering to a wide range of skin tones. Savage x Fenty, her lingerie line, created body-positive spectacles that celebrated women of all shapes with its bras and underwear while market leader Victoria’s Secret was still pushing its narrow, skinny ideal. But the fashion line, rather than trying to rewrite the rules of luxury, struggled to distinguish itself with a clear identity. The attempts by Rihanna and her design team have spanned items such as a $700 satin shirt dress, $300 hoodies, a padded denim jacket for nearly $1,000, and footwear like $910 hot pink heels.

Jean Jacques Guiony, LVMH’s CFO, acknowledged the problem on an earnings call in October. “I would say it’s still work in progress when it comes to really defining what the offer would be,” he said. “We have success. We have things that have worked less well. So we have to sort in between the two and really decide what should be the core strengths of the offer in the years to come.”

The prices have evidently been an issue too. Business of Fashion reports (paywall) that even before the line’s launch, Rihanna was concerned the price tags might put off fans, who have otherwise happily lined up to buy items like her $22 Fenty Beauty lipstick. Though priced lower than other LVMH brands, the clothing was still expensive. Fashion lines centered on a celebrity tend to perform better at accessible prices in the mass market, often with the help of large partners such as department stores or big-box retailers like Target. When celebrity-founded luxury companies have succeeded, as in the case of The Row by Ashley and Mary-Kate Olsen, it’s been through a focus on product and not so much the fame of the founders.

Story continues

The pandemic has not been an ideal moment to build a new brand either. Leading names such as Louis Vuitton and Dior have proved resilient, but smaller companies without so large and loyal an audience have suffered.

It’s possible the Fenty line could return. In its statement, LVMH didn’t elaborate on what “better conditions” might mean, but it’s likely they would entail Covid-19 being better contained.

In the meantime, LVMH is signaling its confidence in Rihanna’s lingerie line. L Catterton, the private-equity firm in which LVMH is a partner, led a $115 million funding round that will help Savage x Fenty continue its growth and expand into retail. In a statement, it touted the line’s “remarkable success by disrupting the intimates category.”

Rihanna's Luxury Brand Fenty Is Shuttering - Rihanna and LVMH to Shut Down Fenty Luxury Brand - ELLE,"Wed, 10 Feb 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVsbGUuY29tL2Zhc2hpb24vc2hvcHBpbmcvYTM1NDY5NzI4L3JpaGFubmEtbHZtaC1mZW50eS1zaHV0LWRvd24v0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"It's the end of an era. Nearly two years after debuting her clothing brand Fenty, housed under luxury conglomerate LVMH, Rihanna and LVMH are officially shutting down operations.

Fenty marked the first luxury brand LVMH launched from the ground up since launching Christian Lacroix in 1987. But according to WWD, Fenty's demise is due largely to the ongoing pandemic and the challenges that arise operating a brand remotely, a luxury one that's produced in Paris and Italy at that. ""Rihanna and LVMH have jointly made the decision to put on hold the RTW activity, based in Europe, pending better conditions,"" LVMH shared in a statement to WWD. Travel bans kept the singer stateside, which allowed her to prioritize Fenty Beauty and Fenty Skin as they're both based in Los Angeles. WWD reports that LVMH views Fenty Skin as a ""home run""—which sources predicted pulled in $30 million in e-commerce sales in just four months—and will shift its focus to strengthening Rihanna's other ventures. The Fenty site will likely go ghost in the next few weeks.

Business of Fashion reports that another disconnect Fenty faced was securing loyal customers. The luxury line launched as an extension of Rihanna's own personal style but the brand's higher-priced items ($300 sunglasses or $800 heels, for example) didn't pique the interest of fans who are regular shoppers at Rihanna's Fenty Beauty, Fenty Skin, and Savage X.

That's not to say LVMH and Rihanna won't try their hand at another luxury brand in the future. If they did it once, they can do it again.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9891088008880615}",neutral,0.9891088008880615,0
LVMH signs champagne deal with rap star Jay-Z - Financial Times,"Mon, 22 Feb 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZ0LmNvbS9jb250ZW50Lzg0MDgyNmU4LWE3MGUtNGYxZC04MmE0LTFiODM4OTVlY2VkNdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Print this page

Roula Khalaf, Editor of the FT, selects her favourite stories in this weekly newsletter.

Luxury giant LVMH has teamed up with Jay-Z to expand the champagne house he owns in a bet that the maker of Veuve Clicquot and Krug can help the rapper’s high-end bubbly Armand de Brignac go global.

The 51-year-old musician and entrepreneur announced on Monday that he had sold half of his champagne company to Moët Hennessy for an undisclosed price.

The deal caps a successful run for the rapper with Armand de Brignac, who touted its “gold bottles of that Ace of Spade” in a 2006 music video before acquiring the company in 2014. Through savvy marketing tinged with hip-hop glitz, the brand grew to sell 500,000 bottles in 2019, which are usually priced from $300 to $950 with specially made vintages costing $100,000.

Jay-Z, whose given name is Shawn Carter, said Moët Hennessy was the “natural partner” to take Armand de Brignac to “the next level of taste and distribution”.

“We want the brand to outlast all of us,” said the 22-time Grammy winner in an interview over Zoom from his California home.

The tie-up is the latest in a string of deals between celebrities and spirits and wine companies eager to exploit the higher-priced, “prestige” end of the market. Diageo bought Canadian actor Ryan Reynolds’ minority-owned Aviation Gin brand and three other spirits for $610m last year, and in 2017 it bought George Clooney’s Casamigos tequila for $1bn.

Rapper Sean Combs has also backed Cîroc vodka and jointly invested in premium tequila brand DeLeón with Diageo.

Jay-Z disputed the idea that Armand de Brignac was a “celebrity-helmed brand”, saying the company had patiently built its fan base through word of mouth, brand ambassadors, and social media. “If this was a celebrity brand, I’d have been on billboards,” he said. “We don’t cut corners or lean on fame to sell the product. We’ve built it through passion and integrity.”

For LVMH, the partnership with Jay-Z is another example of how the group controlled by billionaire Bernard Arnault is searching for ways to expand the audience for luxury goods from Louis Vuitton handbags to premium Hennessy cognac. It recently stepped back from a partnership with pop star Rihanna on ready-to-wear clothing, but will continue to back her cosmetics and lingerie lines.

Philippe Schaus, chief executive of Moët Hennessy, said Jay-Z’s champagne brand could still grow further without losing its exclusive edge. “In the coming years, we can increase the volumes given Moët Hennessy’s 1,600 hectares of vineyards to supply grapes in the Champagne region.”

Schaus said Jay-Z’s involvement had helped broaden the appeal of champagne. “They have disrupted the category and opened it up to a new market,” he added.

The agreement comes as champagne sales contracted sharply last year after Covid-19 shut down nightclubs and restaurants globally. Volumes were down 18 per cent to 245m bottles in 2020, while revenue contracted almost a quarter to €4bn, according to the trade group, Comité interprofessionnel du vin de Champagne.

LVMH’s wines and spirits sales fell 15 per cent to €4.8bn in 2020, while operating profit declined 20 per cent to €1.4bn.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999125003814697}",neutral,0.9999125003814697,0
Birkenstock has been bought by a LVMH-backed private equity fund - Quartz,"Fri, 26 Feb 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vcXouY29tLzE5Nzc5NTMvYmlya2Vuc3RvY2staGFzLWJlZW4tYm91Z2h0LWJ5LWEtbHZtaC1iYWNrZWQtcHJpdmF0ZS1lcXVpdHktZnVuZNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Birkenstock, maker of what is affectionately deemed the original ugly sandal, has a luxurious new owner.

The German company has been acquired by private equity firm L Catterton, it said in an announcement today.

While Birkenstock dates back to at least 1774, L Catterton’s history is a bit shorter, beginning in 2016 when three partners joined forces: LVMH, the luxury giant that owns Louis Vuitton; Groupe Arnault, the family holding company of LVMH boss Bernard Arnault; and Catterton, which was a private equity firm focused on consumer products. Also acquiring a stake in Birkenstock is Financière Agache, Arnault’s family investment company.

Though Birkenstock didn’t reveal the price of its acquisition in the announcement, citing confidentiality agreements, Bloomberg reported earlier this month that the family owners of the company wanted a valuation of €4 billion to €4.5 billion ($4.8 billion to $5.4 billion) including debt. It attributed the information to people with knowledge of the talks.

A company whose foundation is the supportive, contoured cork footbeds of its footwear might seem an unusual target for investors entrenched in luxury fashion, even if recent years have seen Birkenstocks’ fashion cachet surging. But the company possesses qualities that have previously attracted the attention of Arnault and LVMH—namely, brand heritage, proven longevity, and a hold in the marketplace that makes it more resistant to swings in taste. “Fashion trends tend to roll over us,” Oliver Reichert, one of Birkenstock’s two CEOs, told the Wall Street Journal in 2015.

In its announcement, Birkenstock said its new owners will help the company expand into growing markets such as China and India, where it only introduced sales last year. Birkenstock will also devote some of the investment to the German factories where it makes its footwear, as well as to its logistics and sales operations. The company also plans to keep developing its direct-to-consumer business, including its online sales.

Business overall has been good for Birkenstock lately. In 2012, when Reichert and Markus Bensberg took over the top executive roles at the company, they were its first leaders from outside the Birkenstock family. The company’s sales have grown steadily since, a trend even the pandemic hasn’t squelched, despite temporarily hampering production.

Like Crocs, another maker of shoes known more for their comfort than beauty, Birkenstock said it had a record 2020. The acquisition, it said in its release, comes at a moment when Birkenstock “is performing better than ever before in its 250-year history.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999700784683228}",neutral,0.9999700784683228,0
Rihanna’s Fenty fashion brand to close down - CNN,"Wed, 10 Feb 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vc3R5bGUvYXJ0aWNsZS9yaWhhbm5hLWZlbnR5LWZhc2hpb24tY2xvc2UtZG93bi9pbmRleC5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"CNN —

Rihanna’s clothing line, “Fenty Fashion House,” is being suspended indefinitely, luxury conglomerate LVMH announced today.

The label was launched less than two years ago with the French company, which is home to high-end fashion houses Louis Vuitton and Dior, among others.

In a statement to CNN Style, LVMH said the pause was a joint decision with Rihanna “pending better conditions,” and LVMH will continue to support other elements of the Fenty empire, concentrating on “the growth and long-term development” of her beauty and skincare lines Fenty Beauty and Fenty Skin, as well as lingerie line Savage X Fenty.

While LVMH did not elaborate further on the decision, it’s no secret that the challenges of the Covid-19 pandemic have put unprecedented pressure on the global fashion industry and many individual players within it. A market report by consulting firm McKinsey found that fashion sales dipped dramatically in 2020.

The Fenty news comes off the heels of a successful $115 million fundraising round for Savage X Fenty’s expansion into retail. L Catterton, a private equity firm backed by LVMH, announced the funding in a press release today.

Savage X Fenty, like the singer’s other Fenty brands, has been applauded for its body-positivity and inclusive practices. The lingerie line offers underwear for a wide range of skin tones and body types – a message that carries through to its runway shows and ad campaigns. Last fall, a campaign for a special capsule collection featured Black breast cancer survivors.

Rihanna was the first Black woman to head an original brand with LVMH when Fenty Fashion House launched in 2019, though it was not the star’s first clothing venture. In 2014, she became the creative director of Puma and has also created collections for British store River Island.

When Fenty Fashion House was first announced, Rihanna praised the creative control she was given to lead its direction. She said at the time: “Designing a line like this with LVMH is an incredibly special moment for us. (Bernard) Arnault has given me a unique opportunity to develop a fashion house in the luxury sector, with no artistic limits.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999121427536011}",neutral,0.9999121427536011,0

In concise briefings—with wristwatches as the rightful centerpiece—LVMH Watch Week took place online last week. As with the inaugural iteration in 2020, three of the luxury conglomerate’s brands presented novelties (a term used to reference new or updated timepieces for the current year). Though there was much to love for fans of Hublot, Zenith and Bulgari, the three models we selected stand apart for their uncompromising design and technical aptitude (and carry a price to match). As we celebrate their ingenuity, we eagerly await announcements from Tag Heuer, another in the LVMH suite, as well.

Zenith Chronomaster Sport

Accuracy is epitomized in Zenith’s Chronomaster Sport ($10,000) which features a black ceramic bezel that legibly marks the passing of time to the 10th of a second. At the heart of this column-wheel chronograph is the El Primero 3600 caliber, an evolution from Zenith’s original movement from 1969. This sleek 41mm stainless steel wristwatch features the brand’s iconic tri-color subdials, too.

Bulgari Octo Roma Carillon Tourbillon

Though Bulgari announced another stunning addition to their Octo Finissimo line, it’s the super-complication within the Octo Roma Carillon Tourbillon ($259,000) that steals the show. Expectations should run high with such a price point—and with the watch limited to 15 pieces. Perhaps surprisingly, it’s because of its tourbillon, the atypical material used and the music it makes. This particular timepiece features a repeater striking the Chimes Of Westminster tune on three gongs in spectacular fashion. The 44mm watch case is composed of black DLC-coated titanium—and a maximalist design falls within.

Hublot Classic Fusion Takashi Murakami All Black

Announced the week of LVMH Watch Week, but independent of the events, Hublot’s Classic Fusion Takashi Murakami All Black ($27,300) is a pop-art timepiece that channels the joyful aesthetic of the Japanese artist into an elegant, monochromatic automatic wristwatch. The aesthetic centerpiece—Murakami’s smiling flower—is composed of black diamonds (456 for the petals, 107 for the face). Hublot’s ball-bearing system sets the petals in motion. Beating at the heart of the watch is the brand’s manufacture Unico calibre movement. This release will be limited to 200 pieces.

Rihanna is getting out of the high fashion world—for now, at least.

The ""Work"" singer, who launched the Fenty fashion house with French luxury group LVMH in 2019, is now hitting the brakes. Per a statement from LVMH to The New York Times, Rihanna and the luxury group, which also owns Louis Vuitton, Dior and Celine, decided together to put the endeavor on hold ""pending better conditions.""

This means that while the Fenty fashion house has no plans to release collections at this moment, they are not shutting down completely and may return to high-end couture down the line.

The news doesn't come completely out of nowhere. As NYT reported, Jean-Jacques Guiony, LVMH chief financial officer, shared that Fenty was still a ""work in progress"" during an October 2020 call about the group's earnings.

""On Fenty fashion, we are obviously still in a launching phase and we have to figure out exactly what is the right offer. It's not something that is easy. We were starting entirely from scratch,"" he said. ""Obviously, we have the great help from Rihanna on this, but I would say it's still a work in progress when it comes to really defining what the offer will be.""","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9996961355209351}",neutral,0.9996961355209351,0
"Jay-Z And LVMH Pop The Cork On Champagne Deal, Addresses Global Market - Yahoo Finance","Mon, 22 Feb 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQWh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9qYXktei1sdm1oLXBvcC1jb3JrLTE4MzcwNjY1NS5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Global luxury conglomerate and Moet & Chandon parent company LVMH (OTC: LVMUY) bought a 50% stake in rival high-end champagne company, Armand de Brignac, The Wall Street Journal reported.

What Happened: Armand is owned by rapper and mogul Shawn ""Jay-Z"" Carter. It's among the youngest champagne brands and best known for its iconic metallic bottles that sell for hundreds of dollars each. A combination with LVMH will help Armand realize superior growth by tapping LVMH's existing global distribution networks.

Jay-Z invested in Armand in 2014 and later on bought out his partner, spirits company Sovereign Brands.

Jay-Z told WSJ his brand has been growing faster than expected and it was a challenge to maintain the brand. The youth of his company may have also played a role in accepting an investment from LVMH.

""We'd been in this 15 years, not a hundred,"" Carter said.

Financial terms of the transaction were not disclosed. The combination may have started several years ago when Jay-Z met LVMH CEO Bernard Arnault's son, Alexandre, in Paris.

Why It's Important: The investment could also be due to the COVID-19 pandemic as a surge in canceled weddings and other celebrations resulted in a 20% decrease in champagne sales in 2020.

But to say the brand or industry is in peril might be a mistake.

""We're connecting with things that are well made, and things that survive,"" Jay-Z said.

What's Next: Jay-Z said he will likely collaborate with LVMH on other projects in the future.

LVMH Just Bought Half of Jay-Z's Champagne Brand - Highsnobiety,"Mon, 22 Feb 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhpZ2hzbm9iaWV0eS5jb20vcC9sdm1oLWpheS16LWFybWFuZC1kZS1icmlnbmFjLWNoYW1wYWduZS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LVMH has acquired a 50 percent stake in JAY-Z's Armand de Brignac champagne brand. The partnership will see the ""Ace of Spades"" French bubbly join Dom Pérignon, Moët & Chandon, Ruinart, Krug, and Veuve Clicquot among the company's prestigious portfolio of spirits.

Hov famously bought the Armand de Brignac champagne brand in 2014 following a public fall out with the owner of Cristal Champagne. In his memoir, JAY-Z recounted how he would be drinking Cristal in clubs in 1994 – before it was cool. But in 2006, after Frederic Rouzaud (the managing director of the company that makes Cristal) commented on hip-hop's negative association with the brand, JAY swore he would never drink or promote Cristal again.

Soon after Rouzand's comments, JAY-Z placed Armand de Brignac in a music video for his single “Show Me What You Got,” and continued to promote the French sparkling wine until he acquired it six years later in 2014. In doing so, he challenged the rules of the Champagne category and upset the insular industry. The $225 bottle arrives in gold bottles (just like Cristal did) but unlike its counterpart, Armand de Brignac appealed to a diverse audience.

LVMH

“We had been following its success over the last few years and we thought, this is crazy. Most Champagne brands see very modest growth, and he was just shooting up through the ranks,” Philippe Schaus, chief executive officer of Moët Hennessy, the wines and spirits division of LVMH, told WWD.

“We are already global leaders with our prestige Champagne brands – Dom Pérignon, Krug and the prestige cuvées of Veuve Clicquot and Ruinart – but Armand de Brignac has created another niche and in some respects revolutionized the prestige category, so we wanted to be part of that,” Schaus explained. “They opened Champagne to a new clientele, so in that sense, it’s a great complement to our portfolio.”

For JAY-Z, whose fortune exceeds $1 billion, the acquisition was a natural progression for the label. “I couldn’t think of anyone else or a better partner for this brand, Armand, that we built from scratch,” he said. “When we started this, the only goal was to build something that would last longer than us, stand the test of time, build something of the utmost class and taste, so you guys are perfect partners.”

The partnership includes a global distribution agreement and Carter and Moët Hennessy will have equal say in future decision-making. The financial terms of the deal have not been made public but on his feature on Meek Mill's “What’s Free” he raps, ""I’m 50 percent of D’Ussé and it’s debt-free, 100 percent of Ace of Spades, worth half a B,” suggesting he could stand to gain $250,000 million in the deal.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9996070265769958}",neutral,0.9996070265769958,0
LVMH Has Announced The Closure Of Rihanna's Fashion Brand Fenty - ELLE UK,"Wed, 10 Feb 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiOGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVsbGUuY29tL3VrL2Zhc2hpb24vYTI3NTI3MTUyL3JpaGFubmEtZmVudHkv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Update 10/02/201: Rihanna's Fenty: LVMH Announces Closure Of Rihanna's Fashion Brand Fenty

Just under two years since its unveiling, LVMH is reportedly closing Rihanna's fashion house Fenty's doors.

The french luxury goods company confirmed the shutdown in a statement to WWD which reads: 'Rihanna and LVMH have jointly made the decision to put on hold the RTW activity, based in Europe, pending better conditions.'

While LVMH is calling this a 'hold', WWD's sources report that Fenty's 'e-commerce site – the main distribution channel for Fenty fashions – will go dark in the next few weeks' and 'a skeleton staff remains at the Paris headquarters of Fenty fashions to wind down remaining operations'.

Fenty's Instagram page has been inactive since January 1, while the last collection dropped was a shoe collaboration with Amina Muaddi in November.

Rihanna is reportedly 'sad' about the situation, which appears to be the result of the pandemic preventing her from being hands on at her Europe-based brand.

Thankfully, this 'hold' on Fenty's RTW collection isn't all bad news, since LVMH reportedly plans to redirect their funds to Rihanna's Fenty Beauty, Fenty Skin and Savage X Fenty, which may be expanding into activewear in the near future.

15/10/20: Rihanna Unveils Fenty's Latest Pop-Up In London

After fashion collaborations with River Island and Puma (as well as her own beauty and lingerie brands Fenty Beauty and Fenty Savage) Rihanna has taken the plunge with LVMH to create her own fashion label.

On 22nd May the multi-hyphenate launched the brand at a pop-up store in Paris wearing one of the coveted mini dresses from her collection.

'This is a moment in history,' she told journalists at the store opening. 'It’s a big deal for me and my entire generation.'

Here's everything you need to know about Fenty.



Fenty's London Pop-Up

In-between launching a visual autobiography and prepping for a baby (say what?), Rihanna has also launched Fenty's first pop-up in London.

Hosted at mega-store and London landmark , the pop-up will run from 14th-27th October.

Only in store, you'll have to make the trip to be able to get your hands on pieces from the brands three most recent drops: ‘5-19: Buy Black’, ‘8-19: Street Encounters’ and ‘9-19: Take Up Space’.

Fenty's Paris Pop-Up

As we bid farewell to London Fashion Week and gear up for Milan’s later this week, we can’t help but find ourselves counting down the hours until we jump across the Channel to visit the City of Love.

Why? Well, apart from the ethereal runway and epic stage installations that the likes of Chanel and CELINE will undoubtedly serve up, Rihanna’s Fenty luxury house is descending on the Avenue des Champs-Elysées.

WWD reports that the luxury fashion house launched by the Barbadian singer and LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton will take over Paris’ famous Galeries Lafayette department store from 23rd September to 12th October.

The pop-up – which will feature a tunnel-like entrance and staircase customised in Fenty blue (yep, it’s a colour) – will show off a selection of items from the brand’s first three collections drops as well as its fourth collection, which is scheduled to be released around the same time.

Fenty's New York Pop-Up

On Tuesday night Rihanna welcomed the New York fashion crowd to The Webster SOHO for her second pop-up, a month after her first Paris pop-up.

Wearing a slinky, hot pink mini dress, accessorised with matching heels and turquoise earrings, the 31 year-old looked fierce for her new store and drop of clothing.

According to Billboard the pop-up heralds a new collection of clothing for summer, that will include, 'strappy snakeskin heels, oversize denim, brightly coloured bodycon dresses, the glitziest jewellery and fluorescent sunglasses ...[and]even a line of graphic T-shirts.'

Where Can I Buy Fenty?

You can buy Fenty online on the e-commerce shop.

As well as the online shop, Fenty will host pop-up stores around the world.

After the launch in Paris from the 24 May (for two weeks) the brand has announced New York is its next destination.

'FENTY will take over the first two floors of the iconic Cast Iron building at 29 Greene Street in Soho,' the press release states, 'with a unique installation and retail experience designed for The Webster.'

The New York pop-up will be open from 19-30 June 2019.

When Is Fenty Launching?

Gird your loins ladies, because the first official look at Rihanna's Fenty fashion brand is here and it looks epic.

The brand has released, via Instagram, a campaign video for the launch.

The brand with launch on 29th May online and on 24th May in a pop-up store in Paris.

The video release comes hours after Rihanna gave the world a first look at the collection.

Modelled by none other than the singer-songwriter, make-up mogul, clothing and lingerie designer, actor and now brand founder, Robyn Rihanna Fenty, three images have been released showing the hotly-anticipated pieces of clothing and accessories.

Shot for T Magazine's first digital cover, the pictures show the multi-hyphenate with her hair in sculptural ponytails wearing three different ensembles.

In the cover shot the 31-year-old is wearing a beige, oversized two-piece suit. The tailoring has been accessorised with plenty of chunky necklaces, a bum bag and some peach, pointed, naked stilettos.

The second image shows the 'Work' singer in a dark wash denim mini dress, with the same necklaces as before, alongside the same shape of shoe in a beige colour, as well as some dominating orange sunglasses.

Lastly, the Ocean's 8 star can be seen in a white shirt, with the same sunglasses as before, but in a yellow hue, with a collection on gold and crystal earrings.

How excited have these images made us? Tremendously excited is the answer.

What is Fenty?

Rihanna is making history with the launch of her eponymous (Fenty is her last name) fashion brand under LVMH, the group that owns Louis Vuitton and Dior amongst other fashion houses. Why? Well, she's the first black female to take the helm of a major fashion house.

Speaking to T Magazine the philanthropist said:

You’re going to be black wherever you go. And I don’t know if it’s unfortunate or fortunate, because I love being black. So, sorry for those who don’t like it — that’s the first thing you see before you even hear my voice. There are also other factors: I’m young. I’m new to the family. I’m a woman.



Those factors do come into play, but I will not apologise for them, and I will not back down from being a woman, from being black, from having an opinion. I’m running a company and that’s exactly what I came here to do. I don’t know if it makes people uncomfortable or not, but that’s not even my business, you know? I do know that the reason I’m here is not because I’m black. It’s because of what I have to offer. That’s what they’re invested in. And the fact that I’m black is just that: a fact.

Fenty is the first brand LVMH has launched since Christian Lacroix in 1987.

Fenty

'Everybody knows Rihanna as a wonderful singer, but through our partnership at Fenty Beauty, I discovered a true entrepreneur, a real CEO and a terrific leader,' said Bernard Arnault, chairman and CEO of LVMH. 'To support Rihanna to start up the Fenty Maison, we have built a talented and multicultural team supported by the group resources.'

Rihanna added: 'Designing a line like this with LVMH is an incredibly special moment for us. Mr. Arnault has given me a unique opportunity to develop a fashion house in the luxury sector, with no artistic limits. I couldn’t imagine a better partner both creatively and business-wise, and I’m ready for the world to see what we have built together.'

Rihanna revealed in a new interview exactly why she used her last name, and not her stage name, for her non-musical projects.

'I used to be afraid to step into the whole celebrity makeup world. I saw brands like Hilary Duff and Hannah Montana have so much success [in the aughts], but it got to a place where they were so oversaturated in the market that it diluted their personal brands,' the brand founder told the New York Times.

'It made me think, 'I’m not going to do this, because you lose your respect and credibility,' and so every collaboration I did outside of music, I used Fenty so that you didn’t have to hear the word 'Rihanna' every time you saw something that I did. So Rihanna stayed the music, the person. But these other brands are called Fenty.'

What Does Fenty Look Like?

The first Fenty drop is officially here. Inspired by Rihanna's own personal style, the collection consists of block colour ensembles. Think top-to-toe camel suits with matchin bum bags, pastel pink oversized blazers, white cotton gypsy tops and the best pair of dark wash jeans you'll ever own.

Rihanna and LVMH are reportedly bringing the Paris-based luxury maison known as Fenty to a close.

Per reports from both Women’s Wear Daily and Business of Fashion on Wednesday, LVMH and Rihanna have come to an agreement in which the Fenty maison will be closed. In a statement to WWD, an LVMH rep said the luxury conglomerate and the proven multi-hyphenate “have jointly made the decision to put on hold the RTW activity, based in Europe, pending better conditions.”

While that statement implies a temporary nature to the decision, Wednesday’s reports point to this development as a definitive halt for the luxury Fenty house, though it’s also mentioned that both LVMH and Rihanna “haven’t ruled out taking a second run” at a luxury maison in the future.

Complex has reached out to a rep for LVMH and will update this post accordingly.

LVMH and Rihanna first unveiled the luxury maison in 2019. At the time, Rihanna called designing the inaugural line “an incredibly special moment” for the team.

“Mr. Arnault has given me a unique opportunity to develop a fashion house in the luxury sector, with no artistic limits,” she said in May of that year. “I couldn’t imagine a better partner both creatively and business-wise, and I’m ready for the world to see what we have built together.”

The historic Fenty house was the first one LVMH had launched from scratch since way back in 1987 with Christian Lacroix.

LVMH, per this report, will focus further on Rihanna’s Fenty Beauty and Fenty Skin elements, as well as get involved with Savage X Fenty. Meanwhile, L Catterton—in which LVMH, notably, has a stake—is now the leading investor in the latter as part of a push for retail expansion.

On Monday (Feb. 22), it was announced that Hov sold half of his Armand de Brignac champagne brand to LVMH’s wine and spirits division, Moët Hennessy.

On Instagram, Dre congratulated his fellow hip hop mogul.

“Congratulations Jay Z!! Dope AF!!” Dre captioned a photo of himself posted up with a box of Ace of Spades. “That’s Black Excellence.”

According to CNBC, LVMH will now take over the distribution of the champagne. Speaking with Yahoo! Finance, JAY said the luxury giant’s Moët was a “natural partner” and would take his Armand de Brignac to “the next level of taste and distribution.”

Many in the hip hop community praised JAY’s money-making move yesterday. From purchasing a 50 percent stake in the champagne brand in 2006 and buying the rest of the company eight years later, the serial-entrepreneur has gone on to add immense value to the brand. CNBC reports that in 2019, Armand de Brignac sold half a million bottles of champagne.

Dr. Dre wasn’t the only one to congratulate Hov for the successful venture. Tina Knowles-Lawson, Beyoncé’s mother, commended her son-in-law’s business savvy on Instagram.

“… JAY I salute you and your latest venture in selling 50 [percent] of your Champagne Co to LVHM. You are a badass brother and I hope that you continue to pave the way for others like you have in the past!!” she wrote. “And I have seen such extreme kindness and generosity so many times that people don’t even know anything about! You are a true man who has admitted publicly when you’ve made mistakes in a very brave and classy way!”

Knowles-Lawson also applauded JAY’s other entrepreneurial efforts, including Roc Nation’s production partnership with the NFL.

“You have in turn influenced the culture of Young Black Men,” she concluded. “You are a Bad Ass brother. I love you so much!!”

Jay-Z Turns Over 50% of Ace of Spades to Luxury Powerhouse LVMH - Rolling Stone,"Mon, 22 Feb 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJvbGxpbmdzdG9uZS5jb20vcHJvL25ld3MvamF5LXotYWNlLW9mLXNwYWRlcy1jaGFtcGFnbmUtbHZtaC0xMTMxMzY1L9IBVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJvbGxpbmdzdG9uZS5jb20vcHJvL25ld3MvamF5LXotYWNlLW9mLXNwYWRlcy1jaGFtcGFnbmUtbHZtaC0xMTMxMzY1L2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Luxury beverage giant LVMH Moët Hennessy has acquired a 50% stake in Jay-Z’s champagne brand, Armand de Brignac.

Armand de Brignac — which is widely known as “Ace of Spades” due to its logo — was launched by French Champagne company, Cattier, in 2006, then purchased by a company led by Jay-Z in 2014. A press release touted the brand as a “worldwide success” that sold over 500,000 bottles in 2019.

The new deal with Moët Hennesy (which is itself one-half of the gigantic French luxury conglomerate LVMH) involves a 50-50 ownership split as well as a global distribution agreement. Moët Hennessy also looks after other well-known champagne brands including Dom Pérignon and Krug.

While neither Jay-Z’s team nor LVMH disclosed financial terms of the transaction, The New York Times pointed out that some clues may be found in the rapper’s own lyrics: According to a Jay-Z verse on Meek Mill’s 2018 “What’s Free,” Ace of Spades is worth “half a B,” which would value a 50% stake at $250 million.

“I’m proud to welcome the Arnault family into ours through this partnership that began with Alexandre Arnault and continued with his father [LVMH CEO] Bernard Arnault and Philippe Schaus, at my home in Los Angeles,” Jay-Z said in a statement. “It is a partnership that has felt familiar the entire time. We are confident that the sheer power of the Moët Hennessy global distribution framework, its unparalleled portfolio strength and its long-established track record of excellence in developing luxury brands will give Armand de Brignac the commercial power it needs to grow and flourish even further.”

“We are going into this partnership on equal terms together with Jay-Z and his family and with the same conviction that we are only at the beginning of a wonderful story,” said Schaus, president and CEO of Moët Hennessy. “Together, we will lay a strong path forward to firmly cement Armand de Brignac as a luxury icon for current and future generations of customers.”

The Armand de Brignac deal is the latest in a long line of non-musical ventures that Jay-Z has been focused on in recent months. Back in December, the rapper’s Roc Nation announced a partnership with Random House to launch a new publishing imprint, Roc Lit 101, that will publish its first titles later this year. And last October, Jay-Z launched his first marijuana line, Monogram, which was borne out of a partnership with the California-based cannabis company, Caliva.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9998878240585327}",neutral,0.9998878240585327,0

As of today, 50 percent of his Champagne brand Armand de Brignac has been purchased by Moët Hennessey, the wine and spirits division of the luxury conglomerate LVMH.

The brand is commonly known by its nickname “Ace of Spades,” a moniker popularized by its frequent mentions in the realm of hip-hop culture. In fact, Jay-Z purchased Armand de Brignac in 2014, effectively ending his endorsement of Cristal after an executive of Roederer ridiculed the Champagne’s role in the hip-hop world. LVMH, in contrast, seems to be incentivized by Ace of Spades’ hip-hop clout. According to Phillipe Schaus, a chief officer of LVMH, while the merger offers Jay-Z the distribution power of a global Champagne giant, LVMH will benefit from partnership with a Black cultural leader — especially during a moment when the luxury sector is under fire for its racist history.

It might seem like an inopportune time to invest in Champagne, considering the bubbly industry has taken an estimated $1.2 billion hit since the start of the pandemic. But according to Armand de Brignac’s press release, this partnership is the catalyst for something greater to come —reflecting a “shared vision […] for the future of this iconic Maison.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9997095465660095}",neutral,0.9997095465660095,0

The French luxury giant has stated that “Rihanna and LVMH have jointly made the decision to put on hold the RTW activity, based in Europe, pending better conditions”. Since the pandemic hit Europe, Rihanna has been unable to visit her Parisian team, in order to develop her brand. On January 1st, Fenty’s Instagram stopped posting, and in just a few weeks their website will reportedly go dark.

Rihanna’s efforts will now be focused on the other components of the Fenty universe, which includes the successful Fenty Beauty, Fenty Skin as well as the lingerie line Fenty X Savage. LVMH further reports that they and “Rihanna reaffirm their ambition to concentrate on the growth and the long-term development of [the] Fenty ecosystem focusing on cosmetics, skincare and lingerie”.

While the future of Fenty is very much unknown, neither LVMH nor Rihanna have commented on its possible re-launch. We’re all happy to wait for an update, just like we’ve been waiting on the long-anticipated album.

Moet Hennessy is acquiring a 50% stake in rapper and entrepreneur Jay-Z’s champagne brand in an effort to up its cool factor and expand distribution.

Terms of the deal, which was announced Monday, weren’t released.

Armand de Brignac, known familiarly as Ace of Spades because of its distinctive label, is produced in France’s Champagne region by a father and son who are 12th and 13th generation wine growers.

Jay-Z, whose real name is Shawn Carter, gave the brand a boost in 2006 when he featured one of their bottles in a music video after a public fallout with Cristal, a rival brand. Carter accused Cristal of racism after an executive for the brand mused in an interview about whether partnering with a rapper would harm its image.

In 2014, Carter bought Armand de Brignac for an undisclosed sum. The brand sold more than 500,000 bottles worldwide in 2019.

Moet Hennessy President and CEO Philippe Schaus said Armand de Brignac breaks barriers and reflects contemporary ideas of luxury, even as it supports historic Champagne-making traditions.

“We are incredibly proud to be partnering with them,” Schaus said.

Carter said the partnership will help Armand de Brignac grow and flourish, noting Moet Hennessy’s track record of developing luxury brands like Dom Perignon and Veuve Clicquot. Moet Hennessy is the wine and spirits division of luxury goods company LVMH.

“It is a partnership that has felt familiar the entire time,” Carter said.

Carter is one of several celebrities to profit from a partnership with an alcohol brand.

Actor George Clooney co-founded Casamigos, a tequila brand, in 2013. It was purchased by beverage giant Diageo in 2017 for $700 million. Last year, Diageo also scooped up Aviation American Gin, a brand co-owned by actor Ryan Reynolds, for $610 million.

Actor Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson recently released a tequila brand called Teramana. Singer John Legend has his own wine label, LVE. And in 2018, singer Bob Dylan launched the Heaven’s Door whiskey brand.

Rihanna and LVMH hit pause on Fenty - TFR,"Tue, 16 Feb 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vdGZyLm5ld3MvbmV3cy8yMDIxLzIvMTYvcmloYW5uYS1hbmQtbHZtaC1oaXQtcGF1c2Utb24tZmVudHnSAVlodHRwczovL3Rmci5uZXdzL25ld3MvMjAyMS8yLzE2L3JpaGFubmEtYW5kLWx2bWgtaGl0LXBhdXNlLW9uLWZlbnR5P3JxPXJpaGFubmEmZm9ybWF0PWFtcA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"In 2019, Rihanna announced the launch of her luxury fashion label Fenty. She worked together with LVMH to build the brand from scratch. She made history as the first black woman to have a brand of her own with LVMH. However, after a short period, it faced significant challenges trying to stay afloat during the pandemic. Rihanna and LVMH came to an agreement to pause the fashion label. A statement by LVMH had been announced that the brand would be ""put on hold…pending better conditions"" while they continue to focus on the growth of Rihanna's lingerie brand Savage x Fenty and FentySkin.

It is said that through private equity company L Catterton, in which LVMH holds a stake, Rihanna’s lingerie brand raised$115 million to support its expansion and future retail ventures. Savage x Fenty posted revenue growth of over 200% last year and ""increased its active VIP member base by more than 150%,"" Savage x Fenty said in a statement.

The brand is a visual representation of Rihanna, but the partnership shows very little result. It never got a chance to gain momentum. Giving a celebrity a platform to collaborate on an entirely new brand built from scratch has its own risks. Fenty was far from Rihanna’s lingerie line Savage X Fenty or her makeup line Fenty Beauty. By partnering with LVMH, Fenty set the precedence that it has established itself as a luxury brand.

Fenty released eight drops of collection, which all revolved around Rihanna's taste and style in fashion. Rihanna, the creative director, has the final say during the creation process of each collection. Some of the pieces are denim corset dresses, oversized suits with shoulder paddings, laced-up high heels, as well as an array of statement jewelry and sunglasses. The price ranges from $200 to $91, making it clear that it is not a brand made for her fans.

The price was too high, which led to the brand struggling to make a breakthrough as there was not enough support from her fanbase. It is safe to say that the brand would better cater to those who are in a similar financial bracket with Rihanna. An $800 dress is considered pricey by most. These prices have made the products inaccessible to many, and if Rihanna built Fenty as a brand for her fans, she needs to understand their target market and the financial bracket they are in.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9057856798171997}",neutral,0.9057856798171997,0

Backed by the French luxury conglomerate Louis Vuitton Moet Hennessy (LVMH), the singer announced in 2019 that she would head up and oversee the fashion line. However, now it seems that dream is being put on ice, for the time being.

Speaking to WWD, LVMH announced that, ""Rihanna and LVMH have jointly made the decision to put on hold the RTW activity, based in Europe, pending better conditions.""

While a future re-opening has not been ruled out, it seems that the present situation in Europe, as it battles to keep Covid-19 numbers under control, means that for the time being, it will cease trading.

With many countries facing repeated lockdowns, the impact on retailers has been heavy, Rihanna's company just one of many casualties.

In recent months, the Fenty ready-to-wear line has been keeping a low profile. It has not posted on social media since the start of 2021, and its last collaboration was with shoe designer Amina Muaddi in November 2020.

While the fashion line is being paused, it seems that more investment is being put into Rihanna's other ventures, Fenty Beauty and Fenty Skin, and her lingerie line, Savage X Fenty that launched in 2018.

Financial terms were not disclosed. WWD had reported Feb. 8 that Birkenstock was in exclusive talks with L Catterton.

More from WWD

The two remaining relatives of the founder of the company, Christian and Alex Birkenstock, said they entered “this strategic partnership after carefully examining all options.”

They said the sale would “further strong growth in future growth markets such as China and India” and the new partners would invest in German sites and expand production, logistics and sales operations. “At the same time the company plans to invest in the further development of its direct-to-consumer business and the expansion of its e-commerce platforms,” Birkenstock said in a statement.

L Catterton is a partnership between the original U.S. investment firm Catterton and Arnault’s LVMH and Groupe Arnault. It describes itself as “the largest, diversified consumer-dedicated private equity firm in the world”.

The Birkenstock brothers, who will stay on with the company and hold a minority share, praised their new business partners for “a deep understanding of the details of a manufacturing business that is all about quality and a respect for brands with a long heritage like ours.”

“We truly appreciate brands with this long heritage,” Arnault said in a statement. “Together we will provide support to the business so it can fully realize its significant growth potential.”

Birkenstock reported revenues of 720 million euros in 2019.

In Fridays statement, Birkenstock said it is “performing better than ever before in its 250-year history and reported “another record year” despite the coronavirus pandemic.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9857437014579773}",neutral,0.9857437014579773,0

Full story below…

WWD report that the star and the iconic fashion giant have “mutually agreed” to put an indefinite pause on the production of the luxury line.

In a statement, LVMH confirmed the development saying:

“Rihanna and LVMH have jointly made the decision to put on hold the RTW activity, based in Europe, pending better conditions.”

First announced in May 2019, the establishment of the line was a game-changer given that Fenty was the first fashion brand launched from the ground up by LVMH since Christian Lacroix was founded in 1987.

Despite the development, LVMH is said to be doubling down on its broader commitment to the Fenty empire – with plans to support Fenty Beauty and Fenty Skin.

Per WWD, the luxury juggernaut is keen to join forces with Rih’s lingerie line.

Private equity firm L Catterton (in which LVMH has a stake), led a $115 million funding round to support the upcoming expansion into retail of Savage x Fenty.

On Monday, February 22, Moët Hennessy announced a partnership with Shawn Jay-Z Carter via the acquisition of 50% of his high-end Champagne Armand de Brignac — or Ace of Spades as the rapper refers to it because of the gold bottle.

“For years we have been following the fantastic success of Armand de Brignac and admiring their ability to challenge some of the rules of the Champagne category,” Philippe Schaus, President & CEO of Moët Hennessy, said in a release posted on the champagne’s website. “Often referred to as ‘Ace of Spades,’ Armand de Brignac breaks barriers and reflects contemporary luxury, while preserving the traditions of the Champagne terroirs,” he continued. “Today, we are incredibly proud to be partnering with them and believe that the combination of our Champagne experience and international network coupled with Shawn JAY-Z Carter’s vision, the strength of the Armand de Brignac brand and quality of its range of prestige cuvées will allow us to take the business to new heights across the world.”

The New York Times reports “the deal gives Jay-Z the organisational support and distribution power of a global drinks “machine,” as Schaus called it, while LVMH gets the cool clout and lifestyle marketing savvy of a pace-setting Black cultural leader at a time when the luxury sector’s racism is under particular scrutiny.”

This isn’t LVMH’s first foray into Roc Nation’s roster. Rihanna (who is also signed to Jay-Z’s Roc Nation label) became the first Black woman at the helm of a LVMH Maison and the first woman, Black or otherwise, to launch an original brand at the conglomerate in 2019, though her Fenty clothing brand is now paused.

As the Times points out, “the investment from LVMH, which has an all-white leadership team, gives Jay-Z an increased presence in an old, elite, European industry.” But it’s been a long time coming. In 2006, Carter purchased Ace of Spades with a partner after an executive from Cristal’s parent company made disparaging remarks about its Black clientele (rappers like Carter elevated the champagne to aspirational affluence). He purchased the remainder of the brand in 2014.

The gold bottle with its spade branding has made appearances in Carter’s “Show Me What You Got” video in 2006, in the music video for “Mood4EVA” from Beyoncé’s Black Is King, and at the 2020 Golden Globes where the Carters skipped the red carpet but showed up to the Moet-sponsored event with two bottles. They even shared it with Reese Witherspoon and Jennifer Aniston asked the Carters for a spin of their champagne, later sending them each a case.

Schaus summed up the partnership for the Times, saying: “In your understanding of the world of tomorrow, we believe you created a new consumer for champagne.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9634833335876465}",neutral,0.9634833335876465,0
