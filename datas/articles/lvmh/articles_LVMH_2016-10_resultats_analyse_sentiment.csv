LVMH to Take 80% Stake in German Luggage Brand Rimowa (Published 2016) - The New York Times,"Tue, 04 Oct 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMTYvMTAvMDUvYnVzaW5lc3MvZGVhbGJvb2svbHZtaC1yaW1vd2EtbHV4dXJ5LWx1Z2dhZ2UuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The transaction would be LVMH’s first acquisition of a German purveyor of luxury goods.

“Rimowa is a brand with a unique heritage,” Bernard Arnault, the LVMH chairman and chief executive, said in a news release. “We share with Dieter Morszeck the same passion for innovation and a common desire to offer very high-quality products derived from a European tradition of craftsmanship.”

The transaction is subject to regulatory approval and is expected to be completed in January.

Founded in Cologne in 1898, Rimowa manufactures luggage and small leather accessories for men and women. It is best known for its aluminum, grooved suitcases. The company expects to report revenue of more than €400 million in 2016, LVMH said.

In a note to investors, Luca Solca, head of luxury goods analysis at Exane BNP Paribas, said the deal made sense for the French company.

“While not a widely expected acquisition, it gives LVMH greater exposure to the continuing development of tourism and the traveling consumer,” Mr. Solca wrote. “Rimowa is the only high-end brand remaining in the market, after the acquisition of Tumi by Samsonite.”

The appointment of Alexandre Arnault as co-chief executive also marks the latest scion of the Arnault family to take a senior leadership role within LVMH since Bernard Arnault became chief executive, chairman and majority shareholder of the conglomerate in 1989.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999548196792603}",neutral,0.9999548196792603,0
LVMH says no way will do business with Amazon - Business Insider,"Tue, 11 Oct 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vci1sdm1oLXNheXMtbm8td2F5LXdpbGwtZG8tYnVzaW5lc3Mtd2l0aC1hbWF6b24tMjAxNi0xMNIBW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vci1sdm1oLXNheXMtbm8td2F5LXdpbGwtZG8tYnVzaW5lc3Mtd2l0aC1hbWF6b24tMjAxNi0xMD9hbXA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"By Astrid Wendlandt

(Reuters) - Luxury goods group LVMH said there was ""no way"" it would do business with Amazon even though the Internet retailer was keen to take on more high-end brands.

Amazon currently sells mostly so-called ""accessible luxury"" brands such as Michael Kors, Calvin Klein and Kate Spade, but LVMH said it did not think it was an appropriate platform for its luxury brands.

""We believe the business of Amazon does not fit with LVMH full stop and it does not fit with our brands,"" LVMH Chief Financial Officer Jean-Jacques Guiony told investors in a conference call on Tuesday, after the group announced unexpectedly robust quarterly sales.

""There is no way we can do business with them for the time being.""

Amazon has been growing its fashion, jewelry and watch retailing in recent years but failed to attract heavyweight luxury brands as they are concerned the U.S. retailer's product presentation and discounts could damage their image.

LVMH and other luxury goods groups such as Chanel and Richemont fought hard to obtain the right from the European Commission in 2010 to refuse partnering with certain websites, citing worries about pricing and counterfeits.

LVMH's shares jumped by as much as 5.7 percent on Tuesday after the group reported much higher than expected third-quarter sales late on Monday, driven by strong trading at its flagship Louis Vuitton brand and revived demand from Chinese customers at home and abroad.

LVMH's sales figures boosted investor sentiment toward the luxury sector, which has been relatively bearish in recent months, and lifted shares of peers such as Richemont, which gained more than 3 percent on Tuesday, and Kering , up 2 percent.

There is concern that tourists will stay away from major European luxury markets in the near future following recent attacks, while an uncertain global economic outlook could also keep demand subdued.

However, the group behind fashion brands Fendi, Dior and Guerlain perfume, said sales in mainland China had improved to ""mid teens"" in the third quarter from ""mid single digits"" in the first half. ""The Chinese customer (who represents one third of LVMH sales) is doing very well,"" Guiony told investors.

Without the negative impact of phasing out the Donna Karan brand, organic growth at the group's all-important fashion and leather unit would have been more than 7 percent, rather than the 5 percent reported, Guiony told investors.

LVMH's leading jewelry brand Bulgari had seen growth slow down as 2015 had been a bumper year, he said.

LVMH shares, which have now risen more than 14 percent this year, closed 4.5 percent higher valuing the group at 80.2 billion euros.

The appointment gave digital a seat at the top table of the world’s largest luxury conglomerate for the first time.

Prior to joining LVMH, Rogers carved out an impressive career in the music tech industry, helping music businesses make the transition to online. He began whilst still a computer student at Indiana University in 1993, when he was tapped to run the website for hip-hop group The Beastie Boys. In the early 2000s, Rogers spent nearly five years running a music service owned by Yahoo, before being named chief executive of Topspin Media — a platform that connected artists directly to their fans via the internet — in 2008.

In 2013, he joined music streaming service Beats Music as chief executive. Rogers arrived at Apple in 2014 after the company’s $3 billion acquisition of Beats Music and headphone maker Beats Electronics. As senior director of Apple Music, Rogers spearheaded Apple’s foray into music streaming services and was also instrumental in the creation of online radio station Beats 1, which poached former BBC Radio One DJ Zane Lowe and famously featured Elton John, Dr. Dre and Pharrell Williams as guest announcers. However, Rogers departed Apple just two months after the launch of Apple Music, announcing his new position at LVMH shortly after.

Rogers jumped ship to LVMH with the intention of developing the conglomerate’s online retail presence — a move many competing luxury players have interpreted as a signal to step up their own digital and e-commerce strategies. In a statement made at the time, LVMH chairman and chief executive Bernard Arnault said he hoped Rogers would help “explore new opportunities for the group in the digital sphere” — a space high fashion brands have been notoriously slow to tap.

In July 2018, Rogers spearheaded the LVMH Lab at Paris’ new Viva Technology show, bringing together almost 50 start-ups to the luxury sector.

In October 2020, Rogers left his position as chief digital officer at LVMH after 5 years. He remained as an advisor at LVMH and continues to host their innovation prize. He joined French crypotocurrency start-up, Ledger.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999819993972778}",neutral,0.9999819993972778,0
LVMH Buys Rimowa Luggage Brand - WWD,"Tue, 04 Oct 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3dkLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy1uZXdzL21lcmdlcnMtYWNxdWlzaXRpb25zL2x2bWgtYnV5cy1zdGFrZS1yaW1vd2EtMTA2MTc2MTMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS — Artist collaborations, digital features and a push into the U.S. are among probable new growth avenues for elite luggage maker Rimowa in the wake of its acquisition by LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton.

Investors smiled on the deal, which values the German firm at 640 million euros, or $719 million. Shares in LVMH, which took an 80 percent stake in the family-controlled luggage firm, rose 3 percent on Tuesday to close at 156.60 euros, or $175.39.

The deal thrusts LVMH into the robust travel sector — and LVMH chairman and chief executive officer Bernard Arnault’s 24-year-old son Alexandre into his first executive role.

He is to move to Cologne and become co-chief executive officer alongside Dieter Morszeck upon completion of the deal, expected in January.

“It has all the values of LVMH — a strong link to craftsmanship, quality and a strong link to innovation,” Alexandre Arnault said. “We have the exact same DNA, the same values and the same spirit.”

An engineering student, Arnault recently completed his studies, including a master’s degree in innovation at the elite Paris school Polytechnique. He also studied computer science at Télécom ParisTech.

He spent half his time getting acclimated to the family business, devoted mainly to missions alongside Ian Rogers, LVMH’s chief digital officer. Earlier this year, he spent six months at Fendi with its ceo, Pietro Beccari.

The luxury scion recounted how his personal appreciation for Rimowa prompted him to write to Morszeck, grandson of the founder, about two years ago, just to introduce himself.

An invitation to tour Rimowa’s headquarters — and production facilities in Germany, Czech Republic and Canada — followed, and was reciprocated as Arnault guided Morszeck through Louis Vuitton’s leather workshops in Asnières-sur-Seine, near Paris, and in the Drôme region.

Not long after, Morszeck proposed that LVMH invest in the company, telling Arnault he had earned his trust and considered the French luxury group the best partner to help Rimowa reach its full potential.

The transaction mirrors LVMH’s 2013 investment in Loro Piana, another family-controlled firm.

Arnault related that his father and other members of his family shared his enthusiasm for Rimowa, renowned for its sleek and lightweight suitcases and a string of innovations and patents.

“I’m very passionate about the product itself, and I’m attracted to the fact that Rimowa, like LVMH, is an entrepreneurial business,” he explained.

Founded in 1898, Rimowa is credited with launching the first suitcases in aluminum and polycarbonate, in 1937 and 2000, respectively. Four-wheel designs and waterproofing are other breakthroughs.

More recently it introduced a case with an electronic tag that links it to a smartphone via Bluetooth, simplifying the check-in process.

Arnault said further digital innovations, collaborations and new materials would fan Rimowa’s leadership.

While acknowledging the brand’s popularity among the fashion crowd — as anyone who’s waited at an airport carousel during fashion weeks in Europe can attest — he said “we are not going to become a fashion company. But we see this trend and we’re going to capitalize on it.”

Well-known in Germany and Asia and identifiable by its grooved sides, Rimowa still harbors “a lot of potential in the U.S. and the rest of Europe,” Arnault said.

For example, the brand operates only four stores in America: New York, Miami, Boston and Los Angeles.

In June, it opened a unit on New Bond Street in London opposite Louis Vuitton, and later this year it will open a boutique on Rue du Faubourg Saint-Honoré in Paris facing the Bristol hotel.

Rimowa counts about 150 stores and is expected to generate revenues this year of more than 400 million euros, or $450 million. In 1980, Rimowa’s revenues were estimated at 3 million euros. It is understood the brand has outperformed the luggage market over the last decade.

It is the first German company to be acquired by LVMH, parent of such brands as Fendi, Marc Jacobs, Givenchy, Kenzo, Bulgari, Tag Heuer, Guerlain, Dom Perignon and Sephora.

“By entrusting this family venture to the LVMH Group, we are guaranteeing a promising future to all Rimowa employees,” said Morszeck, who has been with the company 44 years.

He expressed confidence in Alexandre Arnault’s ability “to accelerate the development of the business by my side.”

The company employs about 3,000 people worldwide and produces mainly in Germany, where artisans manually hammer into shape the aluminum cases.

According to LVMH, the global luggage market has been growing about 5 percent a year for five years, fueled by the surge in Asian travelers.

The number of Chinese outbound travelers is expected to increase by almost 50 percent over the next four years, according to the World Travel & Tourism Council.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999945163726807}",neutral,0.9999945163726807,0

Luxury goods conglomerate LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton has agreed to purchase an 80% stake in German suitcase maker Rimowa for €640 million, or about $717 million, according to a press release.

Rimowa, famous for its ribbed aluminum suitcases, is a favorite of celebrities around the world, including Martha Stewart, Kanye West, Kim Kardashian, Will.i.am, Gwyneth Paltrow, and Kate Upton.

Started in Cologne, Germany, it created the first aluminum case in 1937 and the first lightweight polycarbonate case in 2000, according to the BBC.

""Rimowa is a brand with a unique heritage,"" Bernard Arnault, CEO and chairman of LVMH, said in the release. ""We share with [Rimowa CEO] Dieter Morszeck the same passion for innovation and a common desire to offer very high-quality products derived from a European tradition of craftsmanship.""

The cheapest of Rimowa's offerings cost about $400, but larger cases can reach over $1,000, which is still significantly less than a comparably sized Louis Vuitton-branded case. The polycarbonate suitcases come in a range of colors from dark green to bright red, while the aluminum models come in different shades of silver and beige. Recent models of the bags are equipped with Bluetooth connections and electronic tags that let travelers check in their bags at home, then skip the line once they get to the airport.

A LVMH spokesperson told The New York Times that it expects to hit about $450 million in revenue this year. Rimowa now has 140 stores around the world.

Arnault is installing Alexandre, his 24-year-old son, as co-CEO of the brand along with Morszeck, the grandson of Rimowa's original founder. Morszeck will keep the remaining 20% stake in the company, according to the Times. Rimowa will be added to LVMH's stable of luxury brands, which includes Tag Heuer, Givenchy, Dior, Moët & Chandon, Marc Jacobs, and Sephora.

This solidifies LVMH as the second-largest luggage maker, with about 6.5% of the global market, according to Euromonitor via Bloomberg. Samsonite, which acquired luxury brand Tumi earlier in 2016, still has the lion's share with about 17%.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999988079071045}",neutral,0.9999988079071045,0

New fragrance Kenzo World was also said to be a success.

In retail, Sephora has gained market share in all of its markets and recorded double-digit revenue growth. This was helped by online sales which increased in all regions and new stores.

Sales in Asia improved significantly, aside from in Japan. The company also performed well in Europe and the US, with the exception of France where reduced levels of tourism have dented sales this year.

Two companies are about to control a quarter of the world's luggage market - Yahoo Finance,"Tue, 04 Oct 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUGh0dHA6Ly9maW5hbmNlLnlhaG9vLmNvbS9uZXdzL3R3by1jb21wYW5pZXMtY29udHJvbC1xdWFydGVyLXdvcmxkLTE4MTgyNDUwOS5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Red or blue?

The world of luggage-making is getting smaller.

French luxury-brand conglomerate LVMH said on Oct. 4 that it will buy a majority stake in Rimowa, the 118-year-old German luggage manufacturer known for its grooved, aluminum suitcases, for €640 euros ($718 million).

It’s the second large deal in the premium luggage market this year. The world’s largest luggage maker, Samsonite, agreed to buy its smaller, upscale rival Tumi for $1.8 billion (pdf) in March.

Rimowa said it expects the deal to be completed in January 2017 after a review by regulators. If all goes according to plan, Samsonite and LVMH, the parent of Louis Vuitton, will control roughly 25% of the world’s luggage market, based on data from market-research firm Euromonitor International. (Even before the acquisition of Tumi, Samsonite’s market share dwarfed that of LVMH, it’s closest rival, which had a 5% share last year.)

Both deals will give the companies a stronger presence in the coveted Asian luggage market, the world’s largest and fastest growing.

Travel accessories companies have reason to be optimistic about industry growth. Worldwide, international tourist arrivals rose 4% in the first half of 2016, according to the United Nations World Tourism Organization. That’s 561 million tourists hopscotching the globe.

The tricky part will be getting all those tourists to keep stocking up on luggage, when a new suitcase isn’t something you need to buy every year.

More details emerge of rumoured LVMH Pinarello deal - road.cc,"Wed, 19 Oct 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vcm9hZC5jYy9jb250ZW50L25ld3MvMjA4NjM3LW1vcmUtZGV0YWlscy1lbWVyZ2UtcnVtb3VyZWQtbHZtaC1waW5hcmVsbG8tZGVhbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The rumoured frontrunner to buy Italian bike brand Pinarello is not Louis Vuitton owner LVMH, contrary to reports earlier this week, but rather a private equity firm based in the United States that earlier this year entered a partnership with the luxury goods giant.

It may be a subtle distinction, but it’s an important one that perhaps provides a stronger rationale for a deal that, if initial reports were to be believed, would have seen the Italian bike manufacturer sit alongside the likes of Louis Vuitton, Bulgari and Veuve Clicquot in the LVMH brand line-up.

> Louis Vuitton owner LVMH reportedly set to buy Pinarello

According to a Bloomberg report citing “people familiar with the matter” – American journalese for insiders who do not want to go on the record – Greenwich, Connecticut-based firm L Catterton is the favourite to acquire a stake in the Veneto-based bike brand, founded in 1952.

The private equity house was created earlier this year when LVMH, together with CEO Bernard Arnault’s family holding company, took a stake in Catterton.

The latter was established in 1989, is said to retain a 60 per cent holding in the venture, and has made investments in more than 150 mid-market companies around the world.

Those include yacht-builder Princess, activewear brand Sweaty Betty, and pet food manufacturer Lily’s Kitchen.

Current L Catterton investments within the sports industry include compression clothing maker 2XU, the Peloton at-home fitness bike, sports drinks and supplements manufacturer X2 Performance, and the 360fly action camera brand.

It’s not difficult to see Pinarello, which has a reported turnover of some €50 million, slotting in there. Moreover, LVMH’s tie-up with the private equity firm allows it to invest in growing businesses that might otherwise seem a strange fit with its stable of brands in five distinct sectors – fashion and leather goods, wines and spirits, perfumes and cosmetics, watches and jewellery, and selective retailing.

Yesterday, Pinarello issued a statement which managed to steer a fine line between neither confirming nor denying that a private equity deal which would raise funds for growth by selling part of the family’s shareholding might be on the table.

“With reference to press leaks, the Pinarello family confirms that they have been evaluating, since a few years, different assets reinforcement options with a strong industrial base, in order to further strengthen the Pinarello brand in the world,” the statement read.

It added: “The Pinarello family is not considering to exit the business and will continue to follow the company in its future growth, as it has always done and with the same passion.”

According to Bloomberg’s sources, the family is indeed looking to sell a majority stake and is “in talks with several private equity funds” – a normal part of the process where a corporate finance house acting for owners of a business is looking for buyers.

It adds, in line with previous reports, that Fausto Pinarello would remain as CEO, which strongly suggests the family would retain a stake, and would be consistent with their assertion they are not planning to “exit the business"" – or not entirely, at least.

Pinarello bikes have been ridden to 12 Tour de France victories - the three most recent by Chris Froome - and 2012 Tour winner Sir Bradley Wiggins used a custom track bike from the Italian manufacturer when he set the UCI Hour Record at Lea Valley VeloPark last year.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999443292617798}",neutral,0.9999443292617798,0
Should high-end brands avoid Amazon? - RetailWire,"Fri, 21 Oct 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vcmV0YWlsd2lyZS5jb20vZGlzY3Vzc2lvbi9zaG91bGQtaGlnaC1lbmQtYnJhbmRzLWF2b2lkLWFtYXpvbi_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"While Amazon seeks to add more luxury brands on its path to become the largest U.S. apparel seller by 2017, LVMH last week asserted it had no plans to start selling on the giant e-commerce site.

“We believe the business of Amazon does not fit with LVMH full stop and it does not fit with our brands,” LVMH CFO Jean-Jacques Guiony told investors on the company’s third-quarter conference call. “There is no way we can do business with them for the time being.”

The French company owns Louis Vuitton, Givenchy, Céline and a controlling stake in Dior, as well as number of high-end liquor, jewelry and watch brands.

The comments reflect a general apprehension by many high-end brands about e-commerce. These include concerns over pricing and counterfeits and whether online selling diminishes luxury’s cachet and exclusivity.

At the same time, Mr. Guiony’s statement speaks to sentiments that selling directly to Amazon is similar to selling to Walmart.

“For now, I think it is a smart move for LVMH to stay away from Amazon,” Jared Wiesel, partner at Revenue Analytics, told MarketWatch. “These two brands are polar opposites when it comes to what they stand for — Amazon is about access to everyday products at affordable prices for the masses, LVMH is about exclusivity and luxury.”

W Magazine notes that Amazon is gaining access to some designer brands such as Michael Kors and Kate Spade, but only entry-level goods and a limited selection.

Some feel Amazon must enhance its experience to support luxury selling. Yoox’s and Net-A-Porter’s luxury sites, for example, are filled with motivational content rather than deals.

Oliver Chen, the analyst at Cowen & Co. who asked the question on the conference call, however, believes LVMH has no choice but to consider Amazon or another dynamic online alternative given that luxury spending is bound to shift to online sales in the future.

He wrote in a research note, “Time is the new luxury and LVMH will need to look for omnichannel ways to add luxurious convenience and personalization to the selling and brand experience.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999682903289795}",neutral,0.9999682903289795,0

NEW DELHI: Sephora , a cosmetics company owned by LVMH , has dragged a local company to court for registering its name as a trademark and selling Sephora-branded footwear.LVMH, the parent of several luxury brands including Louis Vuitton , has filed half a dozen cases in India against companies and individuals for selling counterfeit products and for trademark infringement.German premium fashion brand Hugo Boss is suing a Mumbai-based firm for selling bags and accessories branded ‘Boss Bag Boss’.A host of global fashion and luxury goods companies are currently locked in court cases in India, seeking to stop trademark infringement and prevent the sale of counterfeit items.In its lawsuit against Kanishk Gupta in August, Sephora said it operates more than 2,000 outlets in 32 countries and the French company has registered the Sephora brand as a trademark in countries including India. The company said it had registered its local unit, Sephora Cosmetics Private Ltd, in 2007 and subsequently its internet domain name, Sephora.in. Lawyers representing Sephora and Gupta said both parties are settling the case. “They would give up the trademark,” said Kamal Sharma , lawyer for Sephora. After changing a few hands, Sephora has tied up with Arvind Lifestyle Brands and it runs nine outlets in India.Similarly, Hugo Boss has filed an infringement case against Mumbai businessman Rafique Haroon Kudia in July for selling Boss Bag Boss-branded baggage items. Kudia had filed to register Boss Bag Boss as a trademark in 2013, which the German company objected to. “Our monogram, style are different and not matching at all with Hugo Boss,” said Kudia. “I have no idea what is their problem.”Kripa Pandit, a lawyer for Hugo Boss, said the case is sub judice and declined to comment.Louis Vuitton has filed at least half a dozen cases in the Delhi HC this year alleging trademark violations and sales of counterfeit items by local firms and individuals, according to the court’s website.“On a perusal of the documents and the plaint, I am satisfied that the plaintiff has made out a prima facie case for grant of ex-parte ad-interim orders of injunction,” the court said, granting an interim injunction to Louis Vuitton in February in a case against Tarundeep Singh and others.The defendants were restrained from infringing the plaintiff ’s mark and from selling, advertising or dealing in products bearing the trademark Louis Vuitton, the LV logo, the Toile monogram pattern, the Damier pattern and the LV Flower pattern, the court said.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9968242645263672}",neutral,0.9968242645263672,0

LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE, better known as LVMH Group, is set to purchase the Italian bike brand Pinarello, according to a report on Tuttobiciweb.it. The European multinational luxury goods conglomerate headed by Bernard Arnault is looking to branch out into the sports and wellness markets.

LVMH Group is best known for its high-end brands Louis Vuitton fashion and handbags, Moet & Chandon champagnes, along with a wide range of luxury brands in the clothing, cosmetics, fashion accessories, jewellery, perfumes, spirits, watches and wines arena. However, according to the report, LVMH Group is interested in expanding into the sports, wellness and leisure markets with cycling's prominent brand Pinarello as its primary purchase objective.

The Pinarello brand was founded by Nani Pinarello, whose son Fausto Pinarello has been president since 1977. The company currently manufactures bicycles for the road, track and cyclo-cross, but its prized product is the F8 Dogma that ranges from €10,000 to €12,000. Pinarello is also involved in tourism and owns prime holiday real-estate along with luxury holiday and travel brand Pinarello Travel and the Pinarello Granfondo 'La Pina'.

LVMH Group was also attracted by the bike brands presence in professional cycling based on its equipment sponsorship of Team Sky, team of Tour de France winner Chris Froome. In July, Pinarello and Team Sky extended its partnership for a further four years.

Negotiations for the purchase began several months ago by a firm in Milan between the Treviso-based Pinarello and LVMH Group, and what needs to be settled on is only the final sale price, however, the deal could be complete soon. If the transaction becomes official, Fausto Pinarello will remain the CEO of the brand.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999978542327881}",neutral,0.9999978542327881,0

The deal will see LVMH acquire ownership of the Pinarello brand, but should see no change to the overall structure of Pinarello, with current CEO Fausto Pinarello remaining in his position, and no change to the direction of the company or any of its businesses away from building bikes, such as its travel business Pinarello Travel, or the Pinarello Granfondo.

LVMH has apparently also been attracted to Pinarello by the company's association with Team Sky, with the British team riding Pinarello bikes since its inception in 2010, and continuing to do so until at least 2020.

Negotiations towards the deal have been in progress for the last few months and seem to have been moving swiftly, with the final purchasing price being the only major detail yet to be agreed upon.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999961853027344}",neutral,0.9999961853027344,0
Louis Vuitton's e-commerce antipathy - an unsustainable mindset in a world of Amazon retail? - diginomica,"Thu, 13 Oct 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vZGlnaW5vbWljYS5jb20vbG91aXMtdnVpdHRvbnMtZS1jb21tZXJjZS1hbnRpcGF0aHktYW4tdW5zdXN0YWluYWJsZS1taW5kc2V0LWluLWEtd29ybGQtb2YtYW1hem9uLXJldGFpbNIBc2h0dHBzOi8vZGlnaW5vbWljYS5jb20vbG91aXMtdnVpdHRvbnMtZS1jb21tZXJjZS1hbnRpcGF0aHktYW4tdW5zdXN0YWluYWJsZS1taW5kc2V0LWluLWEtd29ybGQtb2YtYW1hem9uLXJldGFpbD9hbXA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"In fact at times it seems that there’s active resistance to the market-levelling potential of online retail. Consider the comments from LVMH Moet Hennessey Louis Vuitton CFO Jean-Jacques Guiony this week, when he declared that the firm’s various brands - which includes Moet, Christian Dior and Louis Vuitton - do not view e-commerce as a “big opportunity”, more a necessary evil:

E-commerce is obviously something we need to have. We need to offer the feature to our clients, but in itself we don’t expect these to become a big, big channel otherwise it would have be the case already I would say.

He added:

We believe very much in the digital content of the selling experience having in mind that more or less all our clients before shopping within our stores grow on the website of the brand before. So basically we have to make a breach between the website and the store in a stronger way. So that's what we have in mind and we also believe a lot in e-marketing particularly on the full network. Two years ago, it was not clear what we could do there, but now it becomes much clear.

The other thing that Guiony is certain of is that his conglomerate’s offerings are too high-end for the likes of Amazon:

We believe that the existing business of Amazon doesn’t fit with our luxury full stop, but also doesn’t fit with our brands. If they change the business model, I don’t know, but with the existing business model, there is no way we can do business with them for the time being.

Guiony is not alone in his apparent distaste for online retail. Earlier this year, Chanel’s president Bruno Palovsky told Vogue: .

We need to not forget in this world where everything is digital, that keeping this exclusivity is an important way to engage with customers… e-commerce is more about buying something and if you don’t like it then you send it back, which is difficult to do with what we are doing, so we try to keep something back.

How much longer?

Is this a sustainable stance? Clearly a large part of the retail customer experience when it comes to luxury brands is the visit to the store and the ‘touch it’ element of the purchase. But at the same time, this limits sales opportunities to those customers who can actually make it into those retail outlets.

According to research earlier this year by Contactlab in conjunction with Exane BNP Paribas - Digital Frontier 2016: Digital luxury is turning mainstream - luxury retailers need to do more to integrate e-commerce and offline activities. By ignoring online channels through which they can engage anywhere with customers, brands miss out on an accurate image of their customers’ profile, behaviour, and preferences.

Massimo Fubini, CEO of Contactlab, warned:



Luxury brands need to shift their perception and open their eyes to the mutual benefits of engaging with digital customers. Digital contact with customers is transforming the luxury industry and with the rise of e-commerce and digital engagement tools, luxury brands are gifted with information from customers’ online activity, allowing them to know 80% of their in-store customers by name. A luxury brand’s success is based on its ability to leverage customers’ digital profiles and purchasing decisions in order to tailor engagement.

There are some signs that cracks are beginning to show in the luxury sector’s resistance to e-commerce. Despite Palovsky’s comments to Vogue, Chanel has been expanding its e-commerce interests, launching a US site to sell sunglasses, albeit its entry-level pricing sunglasses. This follows a deal with Net-a-Porter last year to sell Chanel capsule jewelery online.

Meanwhile as of July, Net-a-Porter began carrying Prada merchandise in Europe, a shift away from its policy of not selling its ready-to-wear merchandise online. That’s a policy that’s coming under extreme pressure, with the firm’s turnover down nearly 15% and profits down 24% in the first six months of this year.

The solution to address this decline? A commitment to double e-commerce sales in each of the next three years, as well as increasing the number of categories of products that it is prepared to sell online. To put that in perspective, online sales only account for two percent of total turnover at present.

So with ContactLab pointing out that luxury e-commerce accounts for virtually all of the sector’s growth in 2016 and predicting that online market share is set to double to 15% by 2020, how much longer can LVMH Moet Hennessey Louis Vuitton hold back the tide?

A research note from Oliver Chen at analyst firm Cowen & Co suggests the answer to that is not long. While understanding Guiony’s attitude to Amazon, there’s a need to consider the potential that a tie-up would open up for the luxury retailer:



LVMH Moet Hennessey Louis Vuitton’s heritage of direct to consumer control on the selling experience, superior and innovative brand management, and conflicts with existing channels of distribution do not appear synergistic with Amazon.

The note adds:

We believe luxury customers continue to value the sense of trust they get from buying luxury items direct from the brand, vs. buying through Amazon. However, we acknowledge Amazon’s ’s recent partnership with Moda Operandi, which could be a step in the right direction regarding building trust and connecting directly with luxury customers.

Cowan & Co’s recommendation is straightforward:

We believe LVMH Moet Hennessey Louis Vuitton should consider pursuing an integrated luxury online department store of the future which is able to leverage a fast delivery supply chain, advanced mobile phone shopping innovation, and multi-brand traffic in order to compete differently from Amazon if the company does not pursue a direct partnership. This will be increasingly important and is a long-term risk factor as social media becomes more broadly pervasive and as younger customers reach sweet spots in luxury consumption ages & wealth profiles. Time is the new luxury and LVMH Moet Hennessey Louis Vuitton will need to look for omni-channel ways to add luxurious convenience and personalization to the selling and brand experience.

My take

I’m not a target customer of Louis Vuitton, Prada or Chanel, so I can’t particularly comment from personal knowledge on the experience of shopping in store. But I do know people for whom getting up close and personal with the hugely expensive handbag is all part of that experience. That said, it's hard to see how much longer luxury brand providers can look askance at the omni-channel world.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9990829229354858}",neutral,0.9990829229354858,0
Celebrities love this aluminum suitcase maker that luxury goods giant LVMH just bought for $717 million - Yahoo Singapore News,"Tue, 04 Oct 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vc2cubmV3cy55YWhvby5jb20vY2VsZWJyaXRpZXMtbG92ZS1hbHVtaW51bS1zdWl0Y2FzZS1tYWtlci0xNzQ4NDcyMDUuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Rinowa

Luxury goods conglomerate LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton has agreed to purchase an 80% stake in German suitcase maker Rimowa for €640 million, or about $717 million, according to a press release.

Rimowa, famous for its ribbed aluminum suitcases, is a favorite of celebrities around the world, including Martha Stewart, Kanye West, Kim Kardashian, Will.i.am, Gwyneth Paltrow, and Kate Upton.

Started in Cologne, Germany, it created the first aluminum case in 1937 and the first lightweight polycarbonate case in 2000, according to the BBC.

""Rimowa is a brand with a unique heritage,"" Bernard Arnault, CEO and chairman of LVMH, said in the release. ""We share with [Rimowa CEO] Dieter Morszeck the same passion for innovation and a common desire to offer very high-quality products derived from a European tradition of craftsmanship.""

The cheapest of Rimowa's offerings cost about $400, but larger cases can reach over $1,000, which is still significantly less than a comparably sized Louis Vuitton-branded case. The polycarbonate suitcases come in a range of colors from dark green to bright red, while the aluminum models come in different shades of silver and beige. Recent models of the bags are equipped with Bluetooth connections and electronic tags that let travelers check in their bags at home, then skip the line once they get to the airport.

A LVMH spokesperson told The New York Times that it expects to hit about $450 million in revenue this year. Rimowa now has 140 stores around the world.

Arnault is installing Alexandre, his 24-year-old son, as co-CEO of the brand along with Morszeck, the grandson of Rimowa's original founder. Morszeck will keep the remaining 20% stake in the company, according to the Times. Rimowa will be added to LVMH's stable of luxury brands, which includes Tag Heuer, Givenchy, Dior, Moët & Chandon, Marc Jacobs, and Sephora.

This solidifies LVMH as the second-largest luggage maker, with about 6.5% of the global market, according to Euromonitor via Bloomberg. Samsonite, which acquired luxury brand Tumi earlier in 2016, still has the lion's share with about 17%.

According to Tuttobici, the Treviso-based brand founded by Nani Pinarello in 1952 has been in talks with LVMH for several months now, with the price tag on the business the principal issue still to be resolved.

It is understood that Fausto Pinarello, who took over the running of the business from his father in 1977, would remain as CEO.

LVMH, whose head office is just off the Champs-Elysées, is said to have targeted Pinarello partly due to its high-profile success with Team Sky at the Tour de France. Sir Bradley Wiggins in 2012 and subsequently Chris Froome in three of the past four editions have ridden the brand to victory in Paris.

The mayor of Treviso, Giovanni Manildo, told La Tribuna di Treviso: “Pinarello is world class, I’m not surprised it’s attracted the attention of one of the best known companies in the world, which is something our city should take pride in.”

The city is located in the Veneto, the heartland of the Italian cycling industry with brands including Castelli, Pinarello and Sidi based there, and the newspaper says there are rumours that LVMH may be eyeing up other brands.

The newspaper, which says US and UK-based investors have also been interested in the business, notes that LVMH has been active in the region recently.

Its subsidiary DFS – whose main business is operating high-end duty free stores worldwide, and is nothing to do with the sofa people – last year opened a store at the restored 13th century Fondaco dei Tedeschi building next to the Rialto bridge in Venice.

Other brands currently owned by LVMH include the Champagne marque Veuve Clicquot, fashion houses Dior and Marc Jacobs, the perfumier Guerlain and the jewellers Bulgari and De Beers.

It also owns Swiss watchmaker TAG Heuer, whose logo will appear on BMC Racing’s kit next season under a partnership announced last week.

Should the deal with LVMH go through, that does open up opportunities for some interesting paintjobs on future Pinarello models - with some suggestions being made already on social media.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999841451644897}",neutral,0.9999841451644897,0
"In Stagnant Luxury Market, Luggage Brands Roll On - The Business of Fashion","Fri, 14 Oct 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzb2ZmYXNoaW9uLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy9sdXh1cnkvbHV4dXJ5LWx1Z2dhZ2UtdHJhdmVsLXJldGFpbC1vcHBvcnR1bml0eS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LONDON, United Kingdom — In the first four months after it launched, luggage brand Raden made around $2 million worth of sales from its website and Manhattan showroom.

The company, which sells just two sizes of luggage in a range of different colours, is on track to meet its target of $12 million in sales for its first full year, according to founder and chief executive Josh Udashkin — a former lawyer and director of international development for shoe retailer Aldo.

“We are growing [at such a fast pace] that we can’t keep our products in stock, which is a good problem to have as a young company,” he tells BoF. “I think people are really attracted to the simplicity of the purchase experience.”

Its two products, simply named “Carry” and “Check,” retail for $295 and $395 respectively, both feature glossy exterior shells, as well as built-in chargers, an integrated weighing scale and sensors that allow users to check their bag’s location via an app.

Raden is just one of many luggage brands tapping into the opportunity in the high-end travel goods market, where sleek, lightweight designs and “smart” technology features are targeting a growing base of well–travelled and digitally savvy customers.

While growth in personal luxury goods is slowing — the global personal luxury goods market grew by just 1 percent in 2015 on the previous year in real growth terms, according to a report by Bain & Company — travel and tourism is on the rise, particularly amongst the growing middle class in China.

Chinese citizens made over 100 million trips overseas in 2014. In the first half of 2015, this number grew by 10 percent and could reach 200 million trips by 2020. Chinese consumers have been driving almost a third of global luxury sales volume in 2016, with 80 percent of their spending taking place abroad.

The luxury luggage sector stands to benefit from this, particularly as consumers focus their spending on experiences like travel, and is helped by encouraging signs that demand for high-end luggage remains high at a time of sluggish growth for the overall luxury sector. Data from Euromonitor estimates the value of the global luxury travel goods market to reach $4.3 billion in 2016 and predicts it to grow by 16 percent over the next four years to around $5 billion.

“The luggage industry has enjoyed a steady continued annual growth rate of 3.7 percent compared to other categories, such as bags and watches, which only see a continued annual growth rate of 2 percent and 1.2 percent respectively,” says Jasmine Seng, personal accessories associate at Euromonitor.

The opportunity for growth in the sector was made even more apparent after LVMH’s announcement last week that it has purchased an 80 percent stake in suitcase maker Rimowa for $640 million. It was the second significant investment in the luxury travel goods sector this year (following Samsonite’s $1.8 billion acquisition of Tumi in August), highlighting the growing interest in a market where there are a few players but many opportunities for growth.

LVMH has acquired one of the few iconic brands with high-end positioning in the growing segment of premium luggage.

Earlier this summer, Samsonite bought luxury luggage company Tumi for $1.8 billion as part of a strategy to strengthen its position as the world’s largest branded-luggage maker by entering into the high-end travel baggage and accessories market.

""LVMH has acquired one of the few iconic brands with high-end positioning in the growing segment of premium luggage, which is boosted by the development of luxury tourism in both developed and emerging markets,"" says Mario Ortelli, head of the luxury sector at Sanford C. Bernstein.

Indeed, many luxury brands are keen to take advantage of the promising outlook in the luggage market, using it to diversify their portfolios against the wider downturn. Chanel's airport-themed Spring/Summer 2016 show tapped into the zeitgeist for luxury travel, and in July, Louis Vuitton launched a new contemporary collection of roller luggage — in mini, cabin and maxi sizes — a first for the French heritage brand, which traditionally makes monogrammed trunks.

It makes sense then, that LVMH invested in Rimowa, particularly given that the German brand recently launched its own “smart” suitcase with an electronic tag embedded inside that can communicate with the user’s smartphone via Bluetooth, an area with potential synergies for the Louis Vuitton luggage range.

""Even though brands are struggling to understand this complex picture with currency fluctuations and everything else changing the luxury shopping map, the big picture overall is that the market is still increasing,"" said Claudia D'Arpizio, senior partner at Bain & Company in a previous interview with BoF.

The sector is also seeing a host of new players emerging. In addition to Raden, luggage brands Arlo Skye and Away have also launched in the past two years.

“People are travelling more than ever,” says Steph Korey, co-founder of Away. “Certainly in the last five years, there has been a major shift into people focusing on experiences and investing their money into experience more than goods, products or apparel.”

Companies have come to realise that the consumer is looking for a better product, experience and price point, adds Korey, who previously worked at direct-to-consumer eyewear brand Warby Parker as head of supply chain.

It’s a view shared by Mayur Bhatnagar, the co-founder and chief executive of luxury luggage brand Arlo Skye. “Traditional luxury is stagnating,” Bhatnagar tells BoF. “It’s very wholesale driven and … there’s an very uninspiring shopping experience when you purchase luggage in [most] stores.”

Bhatnagar, who previously worked for LVMH before setting up Arlo Skye with Tumi’s former head of design Denielle Wolfe, says the brand’s customer feedback, particularly on social media platforms like Instagram, was integral to helping the company understand the needs of its consumer.

“You end up getting a better view on who your customer is, even though you have never met them, because it’s an online purchase, but because of social you are learning faster on who your customer is and how to engage with them directly.”

Editor's Note: A previous version of this article stated Raden was on track to meet its target of $12 million for the first nine months. This has been amended to its first financial year.

"For luxury brands like Louis Vuitton (LVMHF), Amazon (AMZN) is a little too inclusive - Quartz","Thu, 13 Oct 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQmh0dHBzOi8vcXouY29tLzgwNzQxOS9pcy1pdC1ldmVuLXBvc3NpYmxlLXRvLXNlbGwtbHV4dXJ5LW9uLWFtYXpvbtIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"While much of Amazon’s sales volume is in diapers, blenders, and other unglamorous products, the e-commerce behemoth is also a fashion giant. Next year it’s expected to become the biggest apparel seller in the US, and it boasts an enviable customer base for higher-end brands: Penetration of its “Prime” membership program is greatest among upper-income households, and they are incredibly loyal repeat customers who like to shop for clothes.

And yet high-end luxury labels aren’t biting. Jean-Jacques Guiony, CFO of LVMH, which owns Louis Vuitton and other luxury labels, told analysts on an earnings call on Oct. 11 that there is “no way” it would do business with Amazon.

“We believe that the existing business of Amazon doesn’t fit with our—doesn’t fit our luxury, full stop, but also doesn’t fit with our brands,” he said. ”If they change the business model, I don’t know, but with the existing business model, there is no way we can do business with them for the time being.”

What is so unappealing about Amazon’s business model? Guiony didn’t elaborate on the call, but for any company premised on keeping its high-end goods restricted to a select few and its brand image tightly controlled, e-commerce presents a conundrum. How do you stick to that premise while also trying to tap the broad, eager audience the internet courts? Can luxury reside just clicks away from fast fashion without losing some of its sheen? It’s a clash between exclusivity and inclusivity.

Several of the more affordable designer brands—”accessible luxury” labels such as Kate Spade—have started selling on Amazon (paywall). But for years, higher-end luxury brands have avoided selling online. Those brands also face a logistical problem: The whole point of luxury is the customer experience—from the physical feel of the products to the environment brands create in their stores—and that’s a tactile sensation that’s difficult to replicate online.

Now, some of the staunchest holdouts are being pulled, like it or not, into the digital world. Prada began selling its ready-to-wear online for the first time in July, and Chanel is planning to launch e-commerce by the end of the year.

As they try to maintain their brand images, they face a tricky balancing act. ”I’m not for everyone, yet I’m opening my doors to everyone,” is how Marie Audier D’Alessandris, head of global and North American marketing at Coach, framed the situation at an Oct. 6 panel of industry professionals about luxury in the digital age. The panel was hosted by New York’s French-American Chamber of Commerce, whose members include Cartier, Coach, and Tiffany & Co.

Coach has seen the pitfalls of making its products too ubiquitous. Its brand image took a hit when it was too widely available on discount in its own shops and in department stores. To combat the problem, it cut way back on promotions, and worked to elevate itself. It has seen strong results, including rising sales for its more expensive handbags.

Coach does apparently sell some products on Amazon—but only some. While there are many Coach bags available on the site, most are through independent sellers. Currently there are also a few bags available through Amazon.com directly, and they’re not among Coach’s more expensive or unique products. We’ve reached out to Coach to verify whether it is selling these products to Amazon directly and will update this post with any new information.

It’s a strategy other brands are using. Michael Kors, for instance, only sells watches, jewelry, and wearable products through the site. Amazon is directly selling a few Michael Kors bags as well, but a spokesperson for Michael Kors says the brand does not sell bags to Amazon and has not authorized anyone to sell to Amazon.

Kate Spade, which has a large number of bags available on the site, still puts only its mid-range products up for sale. Its most expensive bag on Amazon is currently $452. It has many bags on its own site that cost more, reaching up to about $800.

Clearly brands still worry that Amazon diminishes the air of exclusivity they seek to project. Does true “luxury” have a place on the site? For now the consensus seems to be no. But Amazon may still become an important way to reach customers entering the luxury market, just as fragrances are. The site can offer a less-expensive gateway to a brand—a point of inclusion to entice new customers into the exclusive world the brand is selling.

This story has been updated with clarification from Michael Kors that even though Amazon is selling a few of its handbags directly, Michael Kors has not authorized Amazon or any third-party to sell its bags on the site.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9870140552520752}",neutral,0.9870140552520752,0
MACAU DAILY TIMES 澳門每日時報LVMH to add Rimowa suitcases in USD716m German foray - Macau Daily Times,"Wed, 05 Oct 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vbWFjYXVkYWlseXRpbWVzLmNvbS5tby9sdm1oLWFkZC1yaW1vd2Etc3VpdGNhc2VzLXVzZDcxNm0tZ2VybWFuLWZvcmF5Lmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"

LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE agreed to take over suitcase maker Rimowa for 640 million euros (USD716 million) and will put Alexandre Arnault in charge of the group’s first German asset, a sign that Bernard Arnault is expanding the family’s role in his luxury empire.

The world’s largest luxury-goods maker is buying an 80 percent stake from Dieter Morszeck, grandson of Rimowa’s founder, LVMH said yesterday. Morszeck will run the Cologne-based business alongside 24-year-old Alexandre Arnault, who gets his first big job at his father’s group.

Rimowa’s grooved aluminum suitcases have become a common sight in airport security lines, owned by celebrities including Will.i.am and Gwyneth Paltrow. Selling for as little as $400, the cases are less of a luxury than LVMH’s Louis Vuitton, whose trunks typically cost thousands of dollars. Founded in 1898, Rimowa’s growth has outpaced the broader luggage market’s 5 percent expansion over the past five years, an LVMH spokesman said.

“LVMH is looking for brands that have heritage and a unique position,” said Mario Ortelli, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein. “They know that when they acquire these brands they can accelerate their development.”

As part of LVMH, Rimowa will find it easier to get top locations in shopping malls and benefit from discounted advertising, Ortelli said. For LVMH, the acquisition is its first of a German company and will add annual revenue of about 400 million euros. Rimowa – whose designs are based on the fuselage of the first metallic aircraft – has grown sales at a pace of 20 percent per annum over the past two years, RBC Europe analysts estimate. Bloomberg
