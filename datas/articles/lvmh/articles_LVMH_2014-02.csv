LVMH Moët Hennessy, the French conglomerate behind haute brands such as vintner Moët & Chandon and fashion house Louis Vuitton, is taking new office digs at 130 Fifth Avenue in the Flatiron District, The Real Deal has learned.

LVMH will occupy about 26,600 square feet of space – the top two floors – of the 11-story, 145,000-square-foot Olnick Organization-owned building, located on the corner of 18th Street and Fifth Avenue. It will pay rents starting in the low-$60s per square foot over a ten-year period, according to data from CompStak.

Olnick was represented in-house by Seth Schochet and by Newmark Grubb Knight Frank’s Eric Cagner, David Falk and Kyle Ciminelli. LVMH was represented by their colleagues Stephen Gordon and Jon Zuckerman. None of the brokers could be reached for comment. But a source familiar with the deal said LVMH was not the tenant.

Multiple sources said that LVMH was indeed the tenant.

A Jones LangLaSalle team was previously marketing the space. A representative for Olnick declined to comment.

Cagner also represented residential brokerage Brown Harris Stevens in its 13,000-square-foot deal at the building last month, as The Real Deal reported.

LVMH enjoyed a strong fourth quarter in 2013, reaping the benefits of sales growth in the fashion and leather goods industries. The company’s headquarters remain at 19 East 57th Street. A spokesperson for the company couldn’t be reached by press time."

Story highlights Louis Vuitton started as a trunk maker for the French elite, including Empress Eugenie, wife of Napoleon III The company has always had a spirit of adventure at its core Today, it is one of the most valuable luxury brands in the world

CNN —

On a breezy spring day in 1835, a 13-year-old boy from the Jura region of eastern France set out for the glittering metropolis of Paris to seek his fortune.

He traveled the 292 mile road on foot, sleeping wherever he could find shelter and taking odd jobs to survive. It took him two years to reach the city, where he promptly became an apprentice to a box maker, and ultimately opened his own chest-making workshop.

His name was Louis Vuitton.

A century and a half later, the eponymous company he founded is among the most recognizable luxury brands in the world and, according to Forbes, is worth nearly $30 billion.

It’s part of the LVMH consortium whose CEO (and France’s richest man), Bernard Arnault, spoke exclusively to CNN about the firm’s heritage, and the spirit of adventure which, he says, defined it from the start: “The history of Louis Vuitton is linked to travel. We created luggage for explorers, and during the 20th century our products gradually evolved to reflect the lifestyle of the customer.”

Louis Vuitton was one of the first luxury retailers to open boutiques in China and Mongolia and now the label is seeking new frontiers – looking towards unexplored markets in Indonesia and South America.

“When I went to China in 1991 for the opening of the first Louis Vuitton shop, you hardly saw any cars on the streets of Beijing, only bicycles. In spite of that we opened a luxury boutique, and now we have more than 20 across the country” says Arnault.

The company is ever keen to trumpet its craftsmanship ethos. Indeed, many items are still hand-made in its French factories - with some workers being trained between 18 months and two years. Mr Arnault credits this attention to detail with Louis Vuitton’s longevity on the luxury market.

Paris vs New York: Who wins in clash of the culture capitals?

The brand’s well-known LV monogram was introduced in 1896 in an effort to combat counterfeits, but Arnault says that it doesn’t take a logo to recognize the company’s signature handicraft: “What made Louis Vuitton famous was the quality. We don’t do marketing, we just create products which are exceptional in their design and craftsmanship.”

Flamboyant flair

In 1997 the company hired Marc Jacobs as the creative director, initiating a long-standing and successful partnership that come to an end in 2013. Jacobs designed Louis Vuitton’s first ready-to-wear clothing line which premiered at Paris Fashion Week to both critical and commercial success, and the brand has since become known for its theatrical and flamboyant fashion shows.

“It’s very important that when you have a designer like Marc Jacobs, who is a genius, you give him complete freedom. So what you see as theatrical scenery is in fact his creativity poured into the fashion show” says Arnault.

Staging a runway presentation remains crucial when it comes to capturing the imagination of customers and the media, even if some of the more outlandish designs don’t make it from the catwalk to the stores: “Fashion week is a moment in which designers can show their ideas to the world. On the catwalk you see pieces which are innovative and trigger the desire of the customer. From these ideas you can then create products which follow that direction, but in a more accessible way.”

Spirit of entrepreneurship

Louis Vuitton’s parent company LVMH also owns French luxury giants Christian Dior, Givenchy and Dom Perignon, and Arnault travels the world at the helm of the consortium much like an ambassador of Gallic style.

Is Paris still cool? Hell yeah! (But not for the reasons you think)

However, he also looks beyond the world of traditional, large companies, and is eager to apply the entrepreneurial spirit of Silicon Valley to fashion establishments in Paris and London.

“Today everybody, including myself, is interested in internet start-ups. But you also have start-ups in the designer world, and it’s fascinating to see how we can transform a small company into something very successful on a global scale” he says.

And when it comes to his goals for the future? “We want Louis Vuitton to still be the number one brand in ten years. In our business, the most important word is desire, so we want to continue creating desire.”

LVMH to drop French legal status - TRBusiness,"Tue, 18 Feb 2014 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRyYnVzaW5lc3MuY29tL25ld3MtaW4tYnJpZWYvbHZtaC10by1kcm9wLWZyZW5jaC1sZWdhbC1zdGF0dXMvNzM1ODbSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"French luxury goods conglomerate LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton plans to alter its legal status from that of a French public limited company (‘société anonyme’) to that of a European company.

The decision was made at a board meeting on 30 January 2014 and the proposed statutory change will be submitted to shareholders at the annual general meeting on 10 April.

The company – which had sales of €29.1bn ($39.4bn) last year – says that this transition has already been made by some other major European groups. It adds that European status “better reflects the European and international scope of the LVMH Group”, given that the number of non-French brands in its portfolio has significantly increased in recent years.

After Loewe, Fendi, Pucci, Acqua di Parma, Tag Heuer and Zenith, the group welcomed Hublot in 2008, Bulgari in 2011 and Loro Piana in 2013. According to LVMH, the transformation into a European company will have no impact on governance, head office domicile or stock market listing, and no consequences for shareholders."
L Capital remains committed to investment in Genesis: Sanjay Kapoor - The Economic Times,"Wed, 19 Feb 2014 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiigFodHRwczovL20uZWNvbm9taWN0aW1lcy5jb20vb3Bpbmlvbi9pbnRlcnZpZXdzL2wtY2FwaXRhbC1yZW1haW5zLWNvbW1pdHRlZC10by1pbnZlc3RtZW50LWluLWdlbmVzaXMtc2FuamF5LWthcG9vci9hcnRpY2xlc2hvdy8zMDY0MTUxNS5jbXPSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Genesis Luxury founder and MD Sanjay Kapoor says the luxury retailer has resolved its conflict with LVMH Group-owned private equity firm L Capital Asia and that the latter is now committed with its 40% holding in the Rs 200-crore firm. Genesis Luxury, which retails several marquee brands including Armani Canali and Furla in India, is close to deals with two more global brands, Kapoor told ET in an interview. Edited excerpts:L Capital had certain issues with one of our franchisee brands — Sephora. Now that we have sold the Sephora business to DLF Brands at the end of last year, the conflict between L Capital and Genesis Luxury is over. L Capital remains committed with its investment in the company. A big four firm, KPMG, has been auditing Genesis Luxury accounts for the last seven years. We don’t need to raise fresh capital since there are sufficient funds to meet our expansion plans.I am sorry; I won’t be able to comment on that.Every year we would be bringing in one or two new global brands in our board and let go of one brand. This type of churn is good and catalyses growth. We are about to sign deals with two global brands, one operates in casual wear and the other in footwear. One will be a joint venture deal and the other will be a franchisee agreement. These would materialise ise in next fiscal.Business is growing, though there has been a marginal drop in growth rate. This fiscal year, our same-store sales growth has been 15% on a like-to-like basis as compared to 18% last year. This is for matured stores, which are more than two years old. We are still not selling to the uber rich but to new money consumers, such as wealthy professionals and first-generation entrepreneurs who want to feel and look good. Our group revenue too will jump to Rs 360 crore this fiscal from Rs 270 crore last year.We would be opening anywhere between 10-15 stores every year. This year, the focus will be expanding with 14 stores in the Quest mall in Kolkata where we have 35,000 sq ft. That’s how we expand, setting up multiple stores of our brands in a single mall. However, infrastructure availability is a challenge. This year, apart from Quest, no more luxury malls are coming up. However, two new projects in New Delhi and one in Mumbai will be operational in 2015-17. The market for luxury brands is still limited in the top 7-8 cities in India.Women accessories and men’s formal wear are the fastest growing segments in luxury retailing. Our biggest brand is parent firm Genesis Colors-owned Satya Paul, which has 40 stores, while Armani is the largest in Genesis Luxury portfolio with nine stores. Across all the brands, we have 110 stores."
