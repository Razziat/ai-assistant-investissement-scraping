Bernard Arnault Goes to Washington - WWD,"Mon, 11 Apr 2011 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3dkLmNvbS9mZWF0dXJlL2FybmF1bHRzLWNhcGl0b2wtYWZmYWlyLTM1Nzg4MTQtOTA2Mjc4L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"WASHINGTON — Bernard Arnault hit the nation’s capital Thursday like a politician on the campaign trail.

The chairman of LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton first met President Obama at the White House — where they discussed everything from globalization to employment — and then that night received the Corporate Citizenship award from the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars. The night was filled with the Arnault Admirers Club, a diverse group of power elites who circulated around Arnault like electrons around a nucleus. The event drew the likes of Secretary of State Hillary Clinton; former British Prime Minister Tony Blair; J.C. Penney chief executive officer Myron E. “Mike” Ullman 3rd; Mark Weber, ceo of LVMH Inc. and chairman and ceo of Donna Karan International; Kevin Burke, president and ceo of American Apparel & Footwear Association, and Diane von Furstenberg and husband Barry Diller, as well as Donna Karan, Marc Jacobs and a slew of other LVMH-ites.

Also on hand was architect Frank Gehry, who has collaborated with LVMH on designs for the Louis Vuitton Foundation for Creation. Slated to bow in Paris in 2012, it will showcase LVMH’s art collection and provide a forum for young artists.

Obama took time away from battling with Congress over the stalemate of the federal budget that has been consuming Washington. With the President’s ear, Arnault said he discussed LVMH’s commitment to job creation in the U.S. and the importance of globalization.

“I think he is really committed to creating jobs in America, and I explained to him that we have created jobs in California with one of our ateliers, and also in Napa Valley, where we are producing wine in America,” Arnault told WWD.

Fair and sustainable trade was also a theme in Arnault’s acceptance speech later that night at the Four Seasons hotel in Georgetown. He received the institute’s Corporate Citizenship award for his leadership in a broad array of social responsibility and philanthropic initiatives. Fellow Frenchman Jacques Attali, founder and president of PlaNet Finance, received the center’s award for public service for the group’s initiatives in restoring historic monuments, supporting major art exhibits and an extensive corporate social responsibility and sustainability program.

Arnault, who assumed control of LVMH in 1989 and subsequently built a multibillion-dollar luxury empire with more than 60 brands, revealed the business acumen that has driven the company to new heights and also made it a socially responsible player on the world stage.

“To receive this award tonight in your presence is not only an honor but also a very happy, powerful and poignant occasion for me,” he said. “Tonight, you do not just honor me. What you honor with this special award is a commitment of more than 80,000 people with a unique ambition to delight the world, to beautify our universe and to inspire the spirit of our times.

“While I have always been profoundly French, I have a deep and abiding admiration for these characteristics, which are among those that have made America great,” Arnault continued. “Included in these today is the idea that corporations are also citizens with social responsibilities, a concept that I think of as distinctly American. I’m proud to say that we have adopted this principle at LVMH and we apply it not just at home in France, but around the world.”

He also stressed LVMH’s dedication to a “moral code that is nonnegotiable, even if this sometimes means taking very difficult and public decisions because they are simply the right thing to do, whatever the impact on our business,” an apparent reference to the company’s firing of disgraced Dior designer John Galliano.

The “right rules to avoid unfair competition” were also a key point for Arnault, who pointed to the global fight against counterfeiting, an endeavor LVMH has spent millions of dollars on in protecting its brands. And he called for guidelines “that make it possible for companies to operate on the Internet with fair ground rules and for consumers to feel confident that what they are buying is genuine, whether it is a pharmaceutical or luxury product.”

While LVMH may not manufacture trains, cars or rockets, or produce energy, what it does do is important, Arnault said.

“You can tell time, dress beautifully or wear makeup produced by one of our brands anywhere in the world, regardless of your nationality, your beliefs or your culture,” he said. “By bringing to emerging countries the very same products that we sell everywhere else in the world, I’d like to believe that, in our own modest way, LVMH contributes to bringing people of the world closer to each other.”

Arnault won praise from an array of heavyweights on Thursday night. Blair jokingly explained how difficult it was for a “Brit” to praise two “true Frenchmen.”

“The Corporate Citizenship award is not about making an outstanding balance sheet, although Bernard has certainly done that,” said Blair. “It is about making an outstanding contribution, and that he has certainly done as well.”

Calling both honorees “radicals,” Blair said they “took traditional concepts of business and academic life and changed them.”

“LVMH, under Bernard’s leadership, broke new ground in terms of fashion and brands and marketing, and tonight I’m not even going to concentrate on any of those things,” said Blair. “What I want to concentrate on is how he changed our ideas of corporate responsibility.”

He praised LVMH for being one of the first companies to create an entire department dedicated to improving the environment, citing the company’s establishment in 2001 of an “environment charter,” committed to sustainability and reducing its footprint on the global environment.

Marc Jacobs said in a video tribute to Arnault that also featured U2 lead singer Bono and other luminaries, “We all work hard to win his approval.”

In an interview before the dinner, Jacobs said Arnault “is a great supporter of all art forms — from good wine to beautiful interiors to great art to great fashion. I just think he’s a great businessman and a great appreciator of the art of living.”"
"Dior taking it's time replacing designer John Galliano; Riccardo Tisci, Phoebe Philo & Peter Copping - New York Daily News","Mon, 04 Apr 2011 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5ueWRhaWx5bmV3cy5jb20vMjAxMS8wNC8wNC9kaW9yLXRha2luZy1pdHMtdGltZS1yZXBsYWNpbmctZGVzaWduZXItam9obi1nYWxsaWFuby1yaWNjYXJkby10aXNjaS1waG9lYmUtcGhpbG8tcGV0ZXItY29wcGluZy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Fahion house Christian Dior is in no hurry to replace disgraced designer John Galliano as it relies on existing teams for new collections, its head said on Thursday.

Dior, one of the biggest brands within luxury goods group LVMH, sacked Galliano earlier this month following publicity over a video of him shouting abuse in a Paris bar and saying he loved Hitler.

Dior Chairman and Chief Executive Sidney Toledano said the company was studying possible replacements and the brand’s creative development had not been interrupted.

Fashion magazine Elle reported this week that Dior might not announce Galliano’s replacement before the autumn.

“(The announcement) could come at any time, after (the autumn) or before,” Toledano told Reuters after LVMH’s annual shareholder meeting in Paris.

“It requires a period of study of various projects. As our internal teams are working perfectly well, we have time.”

Toledano said the brand’s teams were working on a new cruise collection and that there would be a Dior haute couture show in early July as planned.

“There is no interruption at all,” he said. “No blanks in the calendar of creations.”

It is not clear, however, what will happen to the John Galliano brand of which Dior owns 92 percent. Toledano said it was for Dior to decide its future but he declined to elaborate.

Fashion critics said Galliano, known for his theatrical and dramatic styles, had grown out of touch with minimalist, sober and conservative designs favored after the financial crisis.

Possible contenders to replace Galliano include Peter Copping at Nina Ricci and, within the LVMH group, Riccardo Tisci at Givenchy and Phoebe Philo at Celine.

Oscar-winning actress Nathalie Portman, now promoting Miss Dior Cherie perfume, publicly condemned Galliano for his comments and said she no longer wanted anything to do with him.

LVMH, the world’s biggest luxury group, this month agreed to buy Roman jeweller Bulgari for 3.7 billion euros, its biggest acquisition in a decade.

The group, which makes 9 percent of its sales in Japan, on Thursday said the nuclear crisis in the country had only affected trading in the east and north of the country.

But overall, LVMH Chief Executive Bernard Arnault said: “The impact should be quite limited, despite everything.”

Arnault said the group had made a donation of 500 million yen ($6.03 million) to help rebuild Japan."
"Dior Will Replace Galliano Whenever They Darn Well Please, All Right? - The Cut","Fri, 01 Apr 2011 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWN1dC5jb20vMjAxMS8wNC9kaW9yX3dpbGxfcmVwbGFjZV9nYWxsaWFub193aGUuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Galliano’s replacement, for now.

It’s Riccardo Tisci! Wait, it’s Jean Paul Gaultier? Or Olivier Theyskens? Oh my God, when will they announce the replacement so we can rest easy that Dior will still be carried in stores and photographed in magazines?!

Of course, the label is doing just fine. At a shareholders’ meeting for Dior yesterday, LVMH chief Bernard Arnault announced that Dior’s large design team is functioning smoothly without a creative leader for now, and that they’ll name Galliano’s successor when they feel like it. As evidenced by the label’s fall collection, which walked at its scheduled time without a hitch and received perfectly decent reviews, there’s a large and capable group of people behind the Dior label who can steer the ship. Also, Dior’s revenues were up a solid 15 percent in the year 2010, so people are obviously still buying the label.

Over a month after John Galliano was sacked, the ultimate shortlist for one of the most coveted jobs in the fashion industry is revealed, and there's only one woman in the running.

Riccardo Tisci, Tom Ford, Hedi Slimane, Olivier Theyskens, Nicholas Ghesquière, Alber Elbaz, Haider Ackermann, Prabal Gurung and Sarah Burton are all reportedly on the list compiled by advisers to LVMH boss Bernard Arnault, say WWD.

While officials at Dior are apparently in no hurry to name a successor, rumours are still circulating in Paris as to who will replace John Galliano, who was fired from his 15 year-long position as creative director after he was arrested for allegedly making anti-Semitic remarks to a couple at a Paris café in February.

Mr Arnault, chairman of the board at Dior, will no doubt share the decision-making with his daughter Delphine, who is the label's deputy managing director, along with Sidney Toledano, chief executive officer of the iconic French fashion house.

Delphine Arnault is said to be championing Italian designer Riccardo Tisci, who is currently at the helm of LVMH-owned couture house Givenchy. But if Sarah Burton of Alexander McQueen were to be revealed as Kate Middleton's wedding dress designer, her chances are thought to be greatly improved, as Bernard Arnault is ""transfixed by royalty"", claim WWD.

Whoever is chosen to head up the legendary label, we're in for a long wait to see their debut. Bill Gaytten, who worked alongside John Galliano in the Eighties, is currently heading up the design studio at the headquarters on the Avenue Montaigne, and is said to be preparing the cruise collection, as well as thinking ahead to the autumn/winter 2011 couture offerings for July.
