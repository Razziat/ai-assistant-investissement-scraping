LVMH Celebrates Cultural Exchange at CIIE in Shanghai - WWD,"Tue, 07 Nov 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vd3dkLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy1uZXdzL2dvdmVybm1lbnQtdHJhZGUvbHZtaC1jaWllLTEyMzU5MTgxMDcv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton’s participation in the sixth edition of the China International Import Expo, the first since COVID-19 restrictions lifted, was a coming together of its key maisons and a team of high-level executives.

Members of the LVMH CIIE delegation include Bernard Arnault’s CIIE representative Ludovic Watine-Arnault, who serves as the general manager for Northern Europe and e-commerce director of EMEA at Christian Dior Couture; Marc-Antoine Jamet, secretary general of LVMH; Andrew Wu, president of LVMH Greater China; Michael Schriver, group president for Louis Vuitton North Asia; Karin Raguin, senior vice president of human resources at LVMH China; Jean-Christophe Babin, chief executive officer of Bulgari, and Laurent Boillot, CEO of Hennessy.

During CIIE‘s opening day on Sunday, LVMH delegates met with Wang Wentao, China’s commerce minister, and hosted a series of talks focused on topics including strengthening ties with China and retaining local talent.

LVMH’s 6,600-square-foot pavilion, inspired by the iconic pyramid entrance at the Louvre, featured dedicated booths for its 13 maisons and brands, including Louis Vuitton, Dior, Fendi, Bulgari, Tag Heuer, Tiffany & Co., Chaumet, Guerlain, Hennessy, Cha Ling and Sephora. Celine and Loewe joined the expo for the first time.

“CIIE is a very strong symbol of openness and international cooperation. It is also a unique opportunity for LVMH to strengthen bonds with China, our Chinese friends, and customers,” Watine-Arnault said. “The history of the group here is a long one because several of our houses have been present here since the beginning of the 1990s, so our presence at CIIE comes very naturally for this industry.

“We want to use this platform to display the creativity and craftsmanship of our products to the broader Chinese markets, it’s also important for us to think about what will be the next phase of development with our Chinese partners here,” Watine-Arnault added.

“It’s a very important salute to China’s open-door policy. We are here to celebrate internationalization. The world needs China and China needs the world,” Wu said of the fair.

Wu said the luxury conglomerate’s participation at the CIIE, in its fourth iteration, also aims to show that the company is “beyond just luxury.”

“We have customers getting younger and younger, so we are the representation of youth energy. We are here to play a bigger role by working with young people, benefiting the young people,” Wu said.

“We are thinking of what we will do in 100 years. We are not looking at quarterly performances, which we share with China,” added Hennessy’s Boillot. “I’m often asked what’s after China, I always say after China, it’s China. We want to reconnect with China and the speed that the country is moving at.”

With 2024 being the 60th anniversary of Sino-French diplomatic relations, Wu added that the CIIE is a form of “warming up” toward a year that “needs to be celebrated by people working for international companies and people working in China.”

For Bulgari’s Babin, offering a fresh take on cultural exchanges through the arts is a key message he wants to promote during CIIE. “In the future, it is art that will bind people from different cultures, sensibilities and nations together more than anything else,” Babin said. “Art is the ultimate expression of human genius, and being a jeweler, we are crafting art.”

To pave the way for deeper business ties, Bulgari inked an agreement with the Haikou Comprehensive Bonded Zone Management Committee on Monday that will integrate the jeweler’s travel retail supply chain and customer service center into the Hainan Free Trade Port, which has become a duty-free shopping mecca for luxury players at the southern tip of China.

This year’s CIIE is being held at Shanghai’s National Exhibition and Convention Center in Shanghai and runs until Friday. The expo attracted 3,400 exhibitors, including 289 Fortune 500 companies, from more than 154 countries and regions."
"LVMH, Puma, Patagonia, Nike, Adidas: Winners + Losers on ESG Sentiment - Sourcing Journal","Fri, 10 Nov 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiigFodHRwczovL3NvdXJjaW5nam91cm5hbC5jb20vdG9waWNzL2J1c2luZXNzLW5ld3MvbmlrZS1ndWNjaS1hZGlkYXMtbHZtaC1iYWxlbmNpYWdhLWhlcm1lcy1ib29ob28tYXNpY3MtcGF0YWdvbmlhLXBlcm11dGFibGUtYWktZXNnLTQ2NTYzMC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Luxury company LVMH, which owns Louis Vuitton, Fendi, Givenchy and a number of other brands, has been named the top fashion brand by sentiment in a recent study done by Permutable AI.

The artificial intelligence startup uses natural language processing models to track market sentiments, headlines, environmental, social and governance (ESG) markers and more.

For this report, Permutable AI used its software to extract news from a variety of sources pertaining to ESG and the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDG). Then, a natural language processing model determined whether the articles pertained to a specific company and its actions. From there, AI-powered sentiment analysis ascertained whether the articles portrayed the company in a positive, negative or neutral light.

The Louis Vuitton owner, though it has had issues with animal cruelty allegations this year, received high marks on sentiment where climate action, profit, diversity, equity and inclusion (DE&I) and clean energy are concerned. It did considerably worse when considering lawsuits, intellectual property, negligence and protests against it.

Meanwhile, Adidas took the cake as the worst-ranked fashion brand by sentiment. Just like LVMH, Adidas has struggled against animal rights activists, specifically related to kangaroo cleats.

The ex-Yeezy partner received high marks for sustainability-related news. It recently announced a partnership with DyeCoo, which allows it to use cleaner dyes in its products, releasing less CO 2 , and has worked to use deforestation-free leather in its product assortment.

But those initiatives alone couldn’t save the Rheon partner from a harsh truth: the industry and consumers alike are paying attention to its actions around labor and ethics. Its last-place position comes as a result of negative sentiments around labor standards, intellectual property, business ethics, hostility, lawsuits and other considerations.

This year alone, protestors have shut down a handful of events, targeting the Ivy Park partner after wage theft accusations.

The report notes that sentiment around Adidas was completed on Oct. 10. Late last month, the athletic wear giant called for a wage hike for Bangladeshi garment workers, alongside Puma and Patagonia, which took the second and third-place slots, respectively, for positive sentiment around ESG.

Only a month prior to that announcement, Adidas, Nike and Puma were slammed for allowing Cambodian garment workers to “languish” below the poverty line.

Nike joined Adidas in the worst-ranked fashion companies by sentiment.

The world’s most valuable brand earned the fifth-worst fashion ranking by sentiment award from Permutable AI. Similar to its competitor Adidas, Nike took harsh marks when considering labor standards, human rights, ethics, corruption and legal issues.

The Canadian government opened an investigation into alleged ties between Nike and Uyghur labor in China earlier this year. The sneaker giant, which has recently been the target of a number of thefts, also faced scrutiny from U.S. lawmakers over forced labor.

The other three lowest-ranked fashion brands were Balenciaga, Hermès and Boohoo.

Companies that have been long-heralded as ESG offenders, like Shein and Temu, are not part of Permutable AI’s index. The data it released in this report covers 207 fashion brands that it regularly tracks and measures sentiment on.

Despite Balenciaga’s effort to use more sustainable materials and its breakup with Ye, sentiment is still near rock bottom after a dicey advertising campaign in 2022, which featured children holding BDSM teddy bear bags. Permutable AI’s report notes that this was the main reason the Kering-owned luxury brand ended up as the second-worst fashion brand by sentiment this year.

Hermès, another luxury player, found itself garnering negative sentiment around corruption, lawsuits, hostility and corporate behavior, landing it at the fourth-worst fashion brand by sentiment this year.

PETA has repeatedly urged the brand to halt its use of exotic skins in its products. And though it has incorporated some mycelium leather alternatives, it has not completely stopped its use of animal-skin products.

Boohoo, the fast-fashion brand based in England, is the outlier among the brands generating the worst sentiments. Coming in as the third-worst this year, several of the gripes that landed the company there are specifically related to its lack of attention to the environment and DE&I.

The Frasers-backed brand has been on the receiving end of accusations about greenwashing and “unconscionable” work demands in its facilities. Despite its shortcomings, Boohoo Group signed the Pakistan Accord last month, which other large peers have still failed to do.

As those brands struggle with their reputation and sentiments, Puma, Patagonia, Gucci and Asics join LVMH in the top five fashion brands with the best ESG sentiments this year.

Puma, which came in at No. 2, received high marks for corporate governance, DE&I and environmental considerations. The Rihanna partner has worked on recyclable materials, phased out its use of kangaroo leather and has worked to slash its carbon emissions.

Meanwhile, Patagonia nabbed the No. 3 spot, with its reputation as an ethical B Corp. It received shining marks on labor standards, activism and environmental impact. The brand’s repair and resell program, Worn Wear, has gained traction, and its focus on eco-friendly materials has led it incorporate a planet-friendly odor-fighting textile technology.

Gucci came in fourth place, with positive sentiment surrounding clean energy, DE&I and environmental consideration, such as cooking up an animal-free material innovation. The Kering-owned luxury brand recently earned a circularity award at Milan Fashion Week.

Footwear brand Asics clinched the No. 5 spot, beating out competitors Nike and Adidas by a long shot. The company has recently been recognized for its actions related to the climate, and that showed in its sentiment analysis. The brand has a track record for using recycled materials in its assortment. It came away from the analysis with only one minor scratch on its record: a defamation lawsuit."
"Is There Now An Opportunity In LVMH Moët Hennessy - Louis Vuitton, Société Européenne (EPA:MC)? - Simply Wall St","Thu, 16 Nov 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMitwFodHRwczovL3NpbXBseXdhbGwuc3Qvc3RvY2tzL2ZyL2NvbnN1bWVyLWR1cmFibGVzL2VwYS1tYy9sdm1oLW1vZXQtaGVubmVzc3ktbG91aXMtdnVpdHRvbi1zb2NpZXRlLWV1cm9wZWVubmUtc2hhcmVzL25ld3MvaXMtdGhlcmUtbm93LWFuLW9wcG9ydHVuaXR5LWluLWx2bWgtbW90LWhlbm5lc3N5LWxvdWlzLXZ1aXR0LTHSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Today we're going to take a look at the well-established LVMH Moët Hennessy - Louis Vuitton, Société Européenne ( ). The company's stock saw significant share price movement during recent months on the ENXTPA, rising to highs of €835 and falling to the lows of €661. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether LVMH Moët Hennessy - Louis Vuitton Société Européenne's current trading price of €719 reflective of the actual value of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at LVMH Moët Hennessy - Louis Vuitton Société Européenne’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change.

Is LVMH Moët Hennessy - Louis Vuitton Société Européenne Still Cheap?

The stock seems fairly valued at the moment according to my valuation model. It’s trading around 19.20% above my intrinsic value, which means if you buy LVMH Moët Hennessy - Louis Vuitton Société Européenne today, you’d be paying a relatively fair price for it. And if you believe the company’s true value is €603.20, then there isn’t really any room for the share price grow beyond what it’s currently trading. So, is there another chance to buy low in the future? Given that LVMH Moët Hennessy - Louis Vuitton Société Européenne’s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us an opportunity to buy later on. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility.

What does the future of LVMH Moët Hennessy - Louis Vuitton Société Européenne look like?

Future outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. LVMH Moët Hennessy - Louis Vuitton Société Européenne's earnings over the next few years are expected to increase by 22%, indicating a highly optimistic future ahead. This should lead to more robust cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.

What This Means For You

Are you a shareholder? It seems like the market has already priced in MC’s positive outlook, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the financial strength of the company. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough conviction to buy should the price fluctuates below the true value?

Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on MC, now may not be the most advantageous time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. However, the optimistic prospect is encouraging for the company, which means it’s worth diving deeper into other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.

They include executives who took their companies into new, competitive categories, industry newcomers who disrupted age-old processes, dealmakers who led groundbreaking partnerships and creatives whose work managed to cut through the noise. More from the series →

The Innovators: These thought leaders advanced their respective industries with groundbreaking products or ideas.

Bruno Bavouzet, evp of research and development at LVMH, says his two passions are innovation and people.

These two passions came together when Dior Beauty announced the creation of an International Reverse Aging Scientific Advisory Board in March. It’s comprised of 600 researchers and 18 experts, and led by Bavouzet from the LVMH side. The idea is to better understand the 12 signs of aging, including genomic instability, epigenetic changes, stem cell fatigue and chronic inflammation. Weaving that knowledge into skin-care product innovations to reverse these signs is the next step, said Bavouzet.

Bavouzet has been at LVMH for 10 years, having previously worked at L’Oréal Group. He oversees all beauty R&D for LVMH brands including Givenchy, Fresh and Benefit Cosmetics. A scientist by training, Bavouzet has a Ph.D. in physical chemistry.

“Sometimes you can create new bridges between one domain and another,” he said, describing how breakthroughs in science regularly occur. “This is often the way to inspire innovation: through [exposure to] a new approach or a different way of thinking,”.

As a result of Board discussions, Dior is already set to debut new product technology as early as 2025. In the meantime, the Board will collate the hallmarks of aging and its own research approach into a paper that can then be submitted to an academic journal.

Bavouzet said it is important that he be both ambitious in his goals and humble in his approach. In addition, he hopes that Dior’s advisory board will inspire younger people to consider a career in scientific research.

Bernard Arnault's LVMH Gives the Louvre a $16M Boost to Acquire a Chardin Masterpiece - Observer,"Wed, 08 Nov 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQWh0dHBzOi8vb2JzZXJ2ZXIuY29tLzIwMjMvMTEvYmVybmFyZC1hcm5hdWx0LWx2bWgtbG91dnJlLWNoYXJkaW4v0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"For over a year, the Louvre has fought to acquire an 18th-century painting by Jean Siméon Chardin for its national collection. Now, the museum is receiving help in the form of 15 million euros ($16 million) from LVMH (LVMHF), the luxury conglomerate led by French billionaire Bernard Arnault.

LVMH’s donation will cover a portion of the purchase price for Basket of Wild Strawberries, a 1761 work that set auction records for Chardin when Paris-based auction house Artcurial sold it for 24.4 million euros ($26 million) last March.

In the days following the auction, the export of the work, purchased by the Kimbell Art Museum in Fort Worth, Texas, was halted when the Louvre declared the painting should be classified as a national treasure. “We are fully mobilized to bring it into the national collections,” said Laurence des Cars, the museum’s president and director, in an interview withLe Figaro.

Under the painting’s new classification, the Louvre has two and a half years to secure funding for the acquisition. A portion of the money will be raised through “All Patrons,” an annual fundraising campaign for the Louvre that runs through February of 2024. The campaign, which appeals to the public for contributions towards priority projects at the museum, has been in effect since 2010.

The Louvre will display the Chardin throughout the campaign, during which it hopes to raise 1.3 million euros ($1.4 million) from the public. Corporate donations and funds from the museum’s acquisition budget will cover the rest of the purchase price. LVMH is financially covering two-thirds of the cost, while another private company is donating 1 million euros ($1.1 million), and the patrons group Société des Amis du Louvre will provide 500,000 euros ($535,000).

“Chardin is the French Vermeer, and the Basket of Wild Strawberries is probably the last work of this quality still in private hands,” Jean-Paul Claverie, advisor to Arnault, told Observer. “We are delighted to support its acquisition by the Louvre.”

Arnault has long contributed to the art scene in France. A significant art collector with an estimated net worth of $186.3 billion, the LVMH CEO in 2014 launched Fondation Louis Vuitton. The private art museum, currently hosting a major Mark Rothko retrospective, houses the Arnault and LVMH collections.

The billionaire’s company has also supported more than 60 major art exhibitions in France and across the globe, in addition to supporting various renovations at the Château de Versailles. LVMH has long been involved in the Louvre’s annual public fundraisers, contributing to causes like its 2011 restoration of the Tuileries Garden.

LVMH’s involvement with the purchases of national treasures

LVMH’s most significant involvement in art patronage has centered on acquiring national treasures. “This is the 7th national treasure that we are contributing to buy for public collections,” Claverie said. Such support is a win-win for both museums and the company, which is entitled to up to a 90 percent tax break on purchase prices under French patronage laws.

The conglomerate made headlines earlier this year when it put up 43 million euros ($46 million) to acquire Gustave Caillebotte’s 1877 A Boating Party for the Musée d’Orsay, with the painting classified as a national treasure in 2020. At the Louvre, LVMH helped contribute to the 1998 and 2017 acquisitions of a Jacques-Louis David portrait and the Book of Hours of King Francois I. Between 2000 and 2013, it also helped with the purchase of national treasures at the Musée Guimet and Château de Versailles."

LVMH Prize Announces New Craftsmanship Award - WWD,"Wed, 08 Nov 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3dkLmNvbS9mYXNoaW9uLW5ld3MvZGVzaWduZXItbHV4dXJ5L2x2bWgtcHJpemUtYW5ub3VuY2VzLW5ldy1jcmFmdHNtYW5zaGlwLWF3YXJkLTEyMzU5MTkyMzUv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS — LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton is extending its commitment to craftsmanship to its annual search for emerging fashion talents.

The 2024 edition of the LVMH Prize for Young Designers will feature a new award, the Savoir-Faire Prize, the luxury conglomerate said on Wednesday as it opened applications. Entries must be submitted on the prize web site, lvmhprize.com, by Jan. 7.

Aimed at promoting the transmission of skills, the new prize will distinguish a young brand selected among the finalists of the award and will come with a grant of 200,000 euros and a one-year mentorship program from the LVMH Group.

“The prize is launching its 11th edition and this year I am delighted to honor our attachment to a core value of creation, savoir-faire. The LVMH Savoir-Faire Prize celebrates excellence in craftsmanship, innovation in design and production, and a more sustainable approach to fashion,” said Delphine Arnault, the force behind the prize and a key talent scout at LVMH.

The announcement comes after the world’s largest luxury group said last month it would open a dedicated space for craftsmanship in Paris.

Set to open in 2025, the Maison des Métiers d’Excellence will allow visitors to touch and feel the breadth of the 280 skilled trades represented across its 75 brands, which range from Louis Vuitton to Dom Pérignon, Tiffany & Co. and Sephora.

It will also provide a physical home for LVMH’s vocational training initiatives, in a move calculated to give the group a competitive edge amid a shortage of skilled workers.

In tandem with Wednesday’s announcement, organizers posted a behind-the-scenes documentary about the award’s 10th anniversary, directed by Loïc Prigent, on the LVMH Prize’s YouTube channel.

The competition now includes three prizes. The overall winner receives a grand prize of 400,000 euros and mentorship by LVMH teams in such areas as sustainable development, communication, copyright and corporate legal aspects, marketing, manufacturing and the financial management of a brand.

The runner-up Karl Lagerfeld Prize comes with a 200,000-euro endowment and also enjoys a one-year mentorship. The contest is open to fashion designers from all over the world aged between 18 and 40 who have created at least two womenswear, menswear or genderless ready-to-wear collections.

The annual prize has helped propel the careers of such talents as Marine Serre, Nensi Dojaka, Thebe Magugu, Simon Porte Jacquemus and Grace Wales Bonner. Last year’s winner was Setchu by Satoshi Kuwata, a designer who has worked for everyone from a Savile Row tailor to luxury sneakers brand Golden Goose.

LVMH succession: Bernard Arnault's eldest son Antoine steps down as CEO of Berluti - Fortune,"Wed, 22 Nov 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vZm9ydHVuZS5jb20vZXVyb3BlLzIwMjMvMTEvMjIvbHZtaC1zdWNjZXNzaW9uLWJlcm5hcmQtYXJuYXVsdC1zb24tYW50b2luZS1iZXJsdXRpL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Antoine Arnault is stepping down as chief executive officer of Berluti, the shoemaker that’s part of LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton, amid an executive reshuffle that’s set to trigger questions over succession at the world’s biggest luxury group.

The eldest son of billionaire Bernard Arnault will stay on as chairman of the Parisian brand but will be succeeded as CEO by Jean-Marc Mansvelt, who’s transferring from LVMH jewelry brand Chaumet, according to a statement Wednesday. The changes are effective as of Jan. 1.

The announcement will likely renew speculation over succession at the luxury company, which is currently headed by 74-year-old Bernard Arnault, the world’s second-wealthiest person according to the Bloomberg Billionaires index.

Antoine Arnault, who’s been CEO of Berluti since 2011, will also keep his role as chairman at cashmere specialist Loro Piana, as well as oversight responsibilities for image and environment at LVMH. The 46-year old is also vice chairman and CEO of Christian Dior SE, the holding company through which the Arnault family controls LVMH.

Raising Age Limit

Despite the recent maneuvering, there’s no indication that Bernard Arnault is going anywhere anytime soon. LVMH last year lifted the age limit for its chief executive officer, a move that will allow the family patriarch to stay at the helm until he’s 80.

LVMH owns 75 brands but Berluti isn’t in the top 10, according to estimates by HSBC. LVMH doesn’t break down revenue by label. Berluti sales are on track to come in at around €300 million ($327 million) this year, a person familiar with the company said. LVMH declined to comment.

The Parisian maker of footwear once worn by actor Marcello Mastroianni and artist Andy Warhol is known for its €2,090 leather monk shoes as well as custom-made models. Berluti also offers menswear, as well as accessories and suitcases.

Last week, the company announced it will dress the French team for the opening ceremonies of the summer Olympic and Paralympic games in Paris. LVMH will spend €150 million as an official sponsor.

Antoine Arnault’s sister Delphine, 48, the eldest of the five siblings, heads Dior, LVMH’s second-biggest fashion brand after Louis Vuitton. Alexandre Arnault, 31, is in charge of product and communications at Tiffany & Co, while brother Frederic, 29, is chief executive officer of watch brand Tag Heuer. Jean Arnault, 25, is in charge of developing Louis Vuitton’s watch category.

As part of Wednesday’s reshuffle, Mansvelt will be replaced by Charles Leung, the current chief executive officer of LVMH jewelry label Fred. A successor for Leung will be announced in due course, LVMH said."
LVMH set to buy Barton Perreira amid luxury slump - Fortune,"Mon, 06 Nov 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vZm9ydHVuZS5jb20vZXVyb3BlLzIwMjMvMTEvMDYvbHZtaC1zdW5nbGFzc2VzLXRoZWxpb3MtZW50cnktbGV2ZWwtc2hvcHBlcnMtbHV4dXJ5LXNwZW5kaW5nLXNsb3dkb3duL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"When the world’s biggest luxury brand reported a slowdown in sales growth, it marked a reversal in the boom seen in recent years in spending for high-end products. The company is now eyeing (literally) a deal that could get it closer to entry-level shoppers to diversify away from purely luxury brands.

LVMH, the French conglomerate behind Louis Vuitton, Tiffany & Co and Dior, is buying American sunglass brand Barton Perreira to help the luxury giant expand into the mass-market, The Wall Street Journal reported Sunday.

The deal is valued at roughly $80 million, sources familiar with the matter told the outlet, and would add to the long list of brands LVMH has under its belt, including some in eyewear. It underscores the Bernard Arnault-owned company’s move to invest in brands that can reach a different breed of shoppers from the ultra-rich that its luxury brands typically cater to.

“We are beyond thrilled to announce that Thélios, the eyewear division of LVMH, has acquired Barton Perreira. For us to find the perfect partner to take our collection into the future is a dream come true!” a Barton Perreira spokesperson said in a statement to Fortune. “Their resources will open up a whole new world for our brand.”

Barton Perreira was founded in 2007 by Billy Barton and Patty Pereira, both of whom had worked at eyewear company Oliver Peoples. For its part, the brand counts the likes of Sandra Bullock and Ryan Gosling among its fans, and has stores across the U.S.

The deal would aim to expand Barton Perreira beyond America and into Europe and Asia, where LVMH has a big presence through its luxury brands.

“The brand is well-known and well-established in the U.S., but we see massive opportunity to expand it,” Alessandro Zanardo, CEO of Thélios, LVMH’s eyewear division, told the WSJ. “The goal is to really dignify eyewear into the sphere of luxury.”

LVMH didn’t immediately return Fortune’s request for comment.

Eyes on eyewear

LVMH has taken an interest in eyewear for several years now. Thelios was launched as a joint venture with Italian group Marcolin in 2017, and a few years later, LVMH bought a 49% stake in the brand to fully integrate it into the luxury conglomerate’s operations. In September, it acquired Vuarnet, a luxury outdoor sunglass brand, to become part of Thélios.

“It is Thélios first brand acquisition, which marks an important milestone in the development of the LVMH eyewear company, expanding its presence in the luxury eyewear industry through this proprietary brand,” LVMH said in a statement announcing the acquisition.

Thélios has managed to double its sales in the last two years by venturing into new markets and buying licenses for the LVMH brand, WSJ reported. The moves also hint at the popularity of eyewear in recent times as consumers splurge on it. The market for eyewear is set to grow 8.5% annually between 2023 and 2030, according to ResearchAndMarkets.com.

Legacy luxury brands have looked to products like eyewear and perfumes to help reach wider audiences. For instance, luxury behemoth Kering’s Gucci acquired the perfume-maker Creed earlier this year to make inroads into the fragrance business while expanding Creed’s market in China and elsewhere.

Battling the luxury spending slump

LVMH reported a slower pace of sales growth in the third quarter—9% compared to 17% in the previous quarter. The French group, widely seen as the luxury industry’s bellwether, attributed the results to a normalization following the boom during the COVID-19 pandemic, helped by pent-up savings from lockdowns, and macroeconomic volatility.

Other luxury brands like Kering subsequently reported results pointing to a slowdown in consumer demand for luxury goods.

Despite the seeming slump, the companies seem confident about the direction of the industry. It also helps that Hermès, the maker of Birkin bags, was an outlier as it reported strong third-quarter sales ahead of analyst estimates.

“In an uncertain economic and geopolitical environment, the Group is confident in the continuation of its growth,” LVMH said in a statement announcing its earnings.

Bernard Arnault, 74, last year raised the company’s leadership age limit from 75 to 80. While he has not announced plans to step down from LVMH, any hints of his succession plans have been closely monitored. His five children, who all currently hold executive roles at the conglomerate, have for years been integrating into the LVMH group with the expectation that one of them will take over.

Antoine’s departure from Berluti is an opportunity for the 46-year-old to take on an additional role in the family business. He will step down by January and be replaced by Jean-Marc Mansvelt, who has been CEO of jeweler Chaumet, another LVMH company, since 2014.

“I am very happy and quite emotional to welcome Jean-Marc as the new CEO of the exceptional Maison Berluti, building on values of elegance, audacity and unique savoir-faire,” said Antoine in a statement. He noted in an internal memo that “new adventures await me, to be announced shortly,” as reported by Vogue Business.

Succeeding Mansvelt at Chaumet will be Charles Leung, who has headed the jewelry brand FRED since 2018. A search is currently underway for a replacement for Leung, according to LVMH.

What is Antoine Arnault’s involvement in LVMH?

Stepping down from Berluti marks the end of an era for the luxury footwear company, which has been helmed by Antoine for more than a decade. “Under the leadership of Antoine, it has emerged from the pandemic with a great positioning and remarkable revenue and profit growth,” said Toni Belloni, group managing director of LVMH, in a statement. Shortly taking over, Arnault’s son oversaw a rise in annual revenue to $130 million from $45 million.

He has also been recognized for negotiating LVMH’s 150 million euro ($163 million) sponsorship deal with the Paris Olympics in 2024. Alongside participation from other LVMH companies, Berluti will dress the French team for the Opening Ceremonies of the upcoming Olympic and Paralympic games.

Antoine will stay on as chairman of Berluti while maintaining his concurrent positions as chairman of cashmere brand Loro Piana and head of image and environment for LVMH. Initially joining his father’s business in 2005 as head of marketing for Louis Vuitton, Antoine spearheaded the company’s successful “core values’ campaign, which saw cultural icons like Keith Richards and Muhammad Ali pose with handbags in photographs taken by Annie Leibovitz. In December 2022, he was announced as CEO and chair of Christian Dior SE, the holding company owning the majority of the Arnault stake in LVMH.

Despite his dominant role in the family business, Antoine isn’t the only Arnault child poised to become a CEO. Bernard Arnault, who has an estimated net worth of $193.2 billion, in December of 2022 appointed his daughter Delphine as CEO and chair of Christian Dior, the conglomerate’s second-largest brand. Meanwhile, his three youngest sons all hold roles in family-owned companies. Alexandre is the executive vice president of Tiffany & Co, while Frederic heads watchmaker TAG Heuer and Jean is director of marketing and development in Louis Vuitton’s watch department."

LVMH buys eyewear brand Barton Perreira as it looks to rebound from luxury slowdown - CNBC,"Mon, 06 Nov 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tLzIwMjMvMTEvMDYvbHZtaC1idXlzLWV5ZXdlYXItYnJhbmQtYmFydG9uLXBlcnJlaXJhLmh0bWzSAVBodHRwczovL3d3dy5jbmJjLmNvbS9hbXAvMjAyMy8xMS8wNi9sdm1oLWJ1eXMtZXlld2Vhci1icmFuZC1iYXJ0b24tcGVycmVpcmEuaHRtbA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Barton Perreira sunglasses are displayed during 'A Good Time At Goodman's' held at Goodman's Men's Store in New York City.

LVMH is buying luxury eyewear brand Barton Perreira, famed for making James Bond's shades, as it taps into the fast-growing designer sunglass market.

LVMH's Thelios eyewear division agreed to acquire Irvine, California-based Barton Perreira for an undisclosed sum. The deal is Thelio's second big acquisition in two months, after it bought French Alpine brand Vuarnet in September.

Luxury eyewear, which includes sunglasses and optical eyewear, is growing rapidly across the world. Luxury houses see eyewear as a lower-priced entry point to their brands for younger consumers, and now make a wider array of stylish, higher-quality frames. Sunglasses are becoming more popular in Asia, while demand for optical frames is growing as people spend more time on their computer and phone screens, analysts say.

Global eyewear sales topped $107 billion in 2022, according to EssilorLuxottica, with growth expected to be in the mid single digits in the coming years.

""For the maisons of luxury, eyewear is in many cases the first contact point with consumers,"" said Alessandro Zanardo, CEO of Thelios. ""There has also been a shift in the relevance of this category in the whole universe of the maisons. The product is not just something that is made in a factory, to put a logo on and sell. It is something that is really created and designed in the maison environment. The quality is really increasing so customers are developing a sensibility for what luxury eyewear is.""

The deal for Barton Perreira highlights the growing importance of eyewear for LVMH and the luxury industry. LVMH launched Thelios in 2017 to produce eyewear for LVMH's in-house brands, including Louis Vuitton, Celine, Loewe and Berluti. Zanardo said that as Thelios developed its own design, manufacturing and distribution expertise, it decided to acquire outside brands that it could further develop, starting with Vuarnet.

Barton Perreira has a cult-like following among Hollywood stars and collectors of high-end sunglasses and frames. Its models typically retail for $500 or $600, and its limited edition designs, made in small quantities, are especially coveted. Daniel Craig wore a pair of Barton Perreira ""Joe"" sunglasses in ""No Time to Die,"" and Demi Lovato, Sandra Bullock and Ryan Gosling are also reported to be fans.

Zanardo said Barton Perreira was an ideal fit for LVMH because of its commitment to quality.

""Barton Perreira has a very strong founding principle, which is design and quality without compromise,"" he said.

Since Barton Perriera only has a handful of stores in the U.S., LVMH can use its global reach to take the brand overseas, with better distribution in Europe and Asia, Zanardo said.

Barton Perreira was founded in 2007 by Bill Barton and Patty Perreira, after they left Oliver Peoples when it was acquired by Oakley. Zanardo said the two founders will stay at the company after the acquisition and ""make sure the DNA of the brand remains in tact.""

LVMH's acquisition shows that despite a global slowdown in the luxury business, the company is seeking acquisition targets that fit its long-term ambitions. LVMH's stock price is down 20% over the past six months as its growth slows, especially in the U.S. wine and spirits market. LVMH executives often say downturns offer an opportunity to gain market share and make acquisitions, as competitors cut spending and valuations become more attractive.

For now, Thelios said it will focus more on integrating Vuarnet, Barton Perreira and a recently acquired manufacturing facility in Italy, rather than making more deals.

""This year has been very intense for us,"" Zanardo said. ""I think this is a moment for us to focus on what we have added to our organization, and start the path together.""

"Retailers Must Delight and Surprise, Argues LVMH's Chris de Lapuente - WWD","Thu, 02 Nov 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3dkLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy1uZXdzL3JldGFpbC9sdm1oLWxhcHVlbnRlLXJldGFpbC1zdHJhdGVneS1zdW1taXQtMTIzNTg4OTg1NC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Today’s consumers have become so demanding, premium and luxury retailers must surprise and “delight them more than anyone else.”

So says Chris de Lapuente, chairman and chief executive officer of the selective retailing division of LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, which clocked gains of 26 percent last year and in the most recent quarter.

Generating around 15 billion euros in revenues annually, it’s the second-largest division at the French luxury group after fashion and leather goods, comprising Sephora, which has grown fivefold over the last dozen years; travel retail specialist DFS; cruise-ship retailer Starboard; website 24S; grocery retailer La Grande Épicerie de Paris, and department stores Samaritaine Paris and Le Bon Marché.

“We are expecting a fourth quarter of double-digit growth as well,” de Lapuente predicted.

But all retailers have to work harder than ever to keep consumers coming back.

“You come to the store not just to buy your product, but you come to experience, you come to discover things that you might have not expected, the elements of surprise, the wow, the stories, the relationship,” he told the WWD Apparel & Retail CEO Summit in New York City on Oct. 24. “We believe the role of stores is changing. Boring retail may be dead, but exciting retail is alive and kicking.

“Stores are going to have to work harder and harder to excite the customers and make the effort to delight them,” he said.

De Lapuente made a compelling case for “retail entertainment,” roaming the stage and flashing slides showing how Le Bon Marché in Paris is sparking curiosity with storewide displays, like a recent invasion of strange pink figures by iconoclastic French artist Philippe Katerine.

The Left Bank department store is now in the habit of clearing away the beauty stands in its vast nave to make way for immersive evening theater performances, for which customers pay 75 euros. The executive noted that 17,000 people attended a dramatic interpretation of Émile Zola’s “Au Bonheur des Dames” earlier this year, and a fall spectacle, “Cirque le Roux,” has already sold more than 10,000 tickets in less than two months.

“This delights our customers and they feel they’re living a special experience,” he said.

Likewise, some 4,200 beauty enthusiasts recently paid between $120 and $370 to attend a New York engagement for Sephoria, the beauty festival hosted by Sephora that debuted in Los Angeles in 2018. De Lapuente noted some 90,000 people joined the Manhattan event via the internet, suggesting customers appreciate such “insider” opportunities.

“The dream and ambition would be to do this in most of the major cities,” he said of the fairs, which have also been staged in Paris and Shanghai recently. “It will be the place where you go to discover what is hot, exciting and trendy in the world of prestige beauty.”

De Lapuente also touted the art of curation and the need to take brand partnerships to the highest levels. Of about 2,200 brands carried at Le Bon Marché, roughly one-third are exclusive, including fashion line Sézane and jewelry-maker Maria Tash.

Dior’s takeover of Harrods in London last holiday, with a gingerbread-palooza encompassing the entire store, was “truly remarkable,” exemplifying “fantastic storytelling,” he argued.

Meanwhile, aboard cruise ships destined for Alaska, Starboard teams created a bespoke store of exclusive, unique products that travelers could purchase as authentic souvenirs.

The executive also trumpeted the need for retailers to build communities, noting that Sephora boasts 60 million regular customers, and that Le Bon Marché employs a dozen personal shoppers. “I would like to have 100,” he said. “This has to be a major area of focus.”

In a similar vein, he noted the department store boasts 50 stations where various products can be personalized — a number he would like to double.

Finally, he stressed the need to put “people and culture” at the heart of the business.

Echoing other speakers at the WWD event, de Lapuente cited the growing challenge of staff retention in retail, especially after the pandemic, which prompted widespread questioning about the “work-life balance” and popularized remote working on — simply not possible in retail, when evenings and weekend shifts are the norm.

“We need to focus on better retention, better career development,” he said. “Post-COVID-19, the challenges are even greater than before.…We are gradually introducing more flexible work arrangements.”

On the diversity front, de Lapuente said his division has made major strides. When he arrived, about 70 percent of the top 100 executives at Sephora were men. “Ten years later, we flipped it,” he said, flashing a slide of Artemis Patrick, the first female leader of Sephora North America in 25 years.

He noted Patrick is on track to be the first female CEO of the prestige beauty retailer’s North American arm when current president and CEO Jean-André Rougeot retires next year.

“Across the whole of selective retailing, about 65 percent of our top leaders are female,” he said, noting “it’s not something that’s happened in five minutes: It’s taken us 10 years to get there.”

“We need to be braver, and more courageous managing the careers of young people,” he added.

Sephora is also seeking more diverse suppliers, identifying promising beauty entrepreneurs of color under its Accelerate program.

“You can keep on waiting and waiting for another Rihanna to come along. Alternatively, you can go out and look for young, promising founders, and you work with them in the kitchen coaching, helping them develop,” he said.

During a question-and-answer session, de Lapuente trumpeted the Sephora at Kohl’s initiative, initiated in 2021 with the opening of 200 shops-in-shop and expanded since. He cited “zero cannibalization” and “all incremental” business.

“There are others who have tried to follow our example, and it often doesn’t feel like prestige,” he opined. “We do $1 billion at Kohl’s and we think we can double it.”"
Innovator Interviews: LVMH Chandon's Cécile Artigalas - Brand Innovators,"Tue, 28 Nov 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJyYW5kLWlubm92YXRvcnMuY29tL25ld3MvaW5ub3ZhdG9yLWludGVydmlld3MtbHZtaC1jaGFuZG9ucy1jZWNpbGUtYXJ0aWdhbGFzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LVMH’s Chandon sparkling wine brand is turning 50 and to celebrate the brand has redesigned its tasting room in Napa and created a new bottle of sparkling wine.

“We wanted to commemorate over five decades of sparkling wine making in California with a reimagined Chandon home,” says Cécile Artigalas, chief marketing officer of LVMH’s Chandon.

“Our California home has been a destination for exceptional sparkling wine in Napa since 1973, and is the first of our six homes around the world to undergo this exciting transformation. Additionally, to toast to Chandon’s golden anniversary year, we created the very special 50th Anniversary Cuvée Winemaker’s Blend.”

To create the anniversary bottle, director of winemaking Pauline Lhote reunited with former Chandon winemakers Dawnine Dyer, Wayne Donaldson and Tom Tiburzi to begin trials. “It has been an amazing project to create this limited release cuvée as a true celebration of Chandon’s winemaking legacy in Napa Valley,” adds Artigalas.

Brand Innovators caught up with Artigalas to talk about the milestone anniversary and discuss the new space. This interview has been edited for length and clarity.

What is the inspiration behind the new space?

The vision for Chandon’s California home is a space that allows one to feel at home and be stimulated in a multi-sensory way. Each element that Taalman Architecture added reflects the alchemical processes of winemaking and the hybrid methods of the winemakers in their traditional and pioneering techniques. Earthen textures and materials bring in the terroir and simultaneously add warmth and form. Water and air elements highlight the important microclimate of the region and bring light, reflection and transparency, using glass, mirror, metallic and reflective materials.

The new building design sees spaces seamlessly connected via a series of ramps that echo a Californian hillside path. Wine is a natural product, and we love to taste it as close to nature and our terroirs as possible, so the new space beautifully blurs the lines, the line between indoors and outdoors.

How does this new space help support your brand’s mission?

Our Chandon Homes are our 6 pioneering wineries implemented in unexpected destinations from Argentina to Brazil, Australia, China, India and of course California. We chose the name deliberately because our wineries are much more than a production site. It’s where our roots are, where we’re most at home. It’s a showcase of our craft, and an expression of who we are and our mission. Our California home has been a destination for exceptional sparkling wine in Napa since 1973, and it is one of the first of our six homes to throw open its doors. We are hosts at heart, and our Home is the place where we get to extend our warm hospitality.

Who are your customers and how does this kind of offering appeal to them?

At CHANDON, everyone is welcome at our Home and table. We welcome wine lovers and culinary aficionados alike to enjoy our meaningful sensory experiences and events, as we offer a range of exclusive options that suit every mood. Our new Home will continue to host individuals, groups, families and more serving those 21+, though we certainly re-imagined some of our offerings to bring new energy, edutainment, elevated experiences, and visually appealing elements to life that we feel cater to a wide range of guests.

How are you thinking about customer experience?

When we revitalized this home here in Napa, there was one overarching goal: to welcome visitors and Club Chandon members alike and have a place for all to experience our home’s warm hospitality. We wanted to create a warm and inviting community hub, or ‘home,’ for all where we can showcase our hospitality and exceptional wines – everyone is welcome at our table here at Chandon. We offer a wide range of experiences that cater to a multitude of consumers to ensure their experiences feel very elevated yet approachable.

How are you thinking about innovation?

Since being founded in 1959, Chandon has continuously been a community of pioneers and innovators. As one of the 6 Chandon wineries, we’ve created the world’s largest estate dedicated solely to sparkling winemaking. From our female-lead winemaking team, to our prioritized sustainability practices in our vineyards, gardens and newly renovated spaces, here at Chandon, we are innovators at heart and look to continue that legacy for years to come.

How are you showing up in culture?

At Chandon, our goal was to create a place that reveals our care and deep respect for its land and people. We are a diverse community of a little bit more than 800 employees speaking more than 30 languages worldwide. 16 winemakers of seven different nationalities craft our outstanding creative sparkling wines with the expression of their unique 6 terroirs.

We’ve built the Chandon culture and community around its people and continue to share our message of hospitality and home in hopes others continue along this journey with us. We love to support like-minded organizations and partners across a variety of landscapes – beauty, art, culinary, celebrations and beyond."

"Wheelchair Tennis' Déroulède Is Dior, LVMH's Latest Paris 2024 Pick - WWD","Thu, 02 Nov 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigQFodHRwczovL3d3ZC5jb20vZmFzaGlvbi1uZXdzL2Zhc2hpb24tc2Nvb3BzL2Rpb3ItbHZtaC10YXAtd2hlZWxjaGFpci10ZW5uaXMtY2hhbXBpb24tcGF1bGluZS1kZXJvdWxlZGUtcGFyaXMtb2x5bXBpY3MtMTIzNTkwODU1MS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"WINNING SET: Wheelchair tennis player Pauline Déroulède has become the fourth athlete sponsored by LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton ahead of Paris 2024.

The 32-year-old athlete has also been tapped by Dior as its brand ambassador at the Paralympic Games in Paris next year, the French luxury house and its parent group said Thursday.

Currently number 13 in the IFT’s ranking, the French player reached the quarterfinals at this year’s 2023 Roland-Garros tournament, becoming the first French player to reach that stage in wheelchair tennis since 2010.

Dior, which counts a number of athletes among its ambassadors, said in a statement it shared “ambition and commitment” with Déroulède, who is “now focused on her dream [of] conquering Paralympic gold” in Paris next year.

Participating in the international competition in her home city was the challenge the wheelchair tennis champion set down for herself after she was hit by a car whose driver had lost control in 2018, a life-changing accident that saw her left leg amputated.

Already a keen tennis player before that, she began her professional career in 2019 and by 2021, was officially selected for the French national team. She won the French wheelchair tennis championship that year and again in 2022 and 2023.

In addition to her athletic track, Déroulède is a keen advocate for road safety and is lobbying lawmakers to update French laws to account for driving aptitude, as the country remains one of the few in Europe where a license is acquired for life without any medical checks.

With her Dior appointment, the French wheelchair tennis player joins Mélanie de Jesus dos Santos, who was also tapped by the French house and its parent group ahead of Paris 2024. Their compatriots, fencer Enzo Lefort and swimmer Léon Marchand, will also receive the group’s support and have become ambassadors for Louis Vuitton.

A premium partner of the Paris 2024 Olympic and Paralympic Games, LVMH reiterated its commitment to supporting athletes “whose exemplary careers make them artisans of all victories” in the run-up to the Paris 2024 Olympic and Paralympic Games.

The group has also been reinforcing its sports connections, announcing its return as title partner of the America’s Cup, sailing’s biggest and most prestigious race, as well as creating the travel cases for the Webb Ellis Cup and the Ballon d’Or award for the best soccer player, awarded to Lionel Messi on Monday night in Paris."
Burberry joins LVMH and Gucci in the luxury slump as brand says it may miss its revenue target for the year - Fortune,"Thu, 16 Nov 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vZm9ydHVuZS5jb20vZXVyb3BlLzIwMjMvMTEvMTYvYnVyYmVycnlzLXJldmVudWUtdGFyZ2V0LXVuZGVyLXRocmVhdC1zYWxlcy1ncm93dGgtbHV4dXJ5LWRvd250dXJuLXNsdW1wL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Luxury spending was booming during the COVID-19 pandemic, but the tide has since turned. One of Europe’s hottest industries is seeing sales fall, one big brand after another—and British brand Burberry is the latest of them.

The company said Thursday it might fall short on its sales target for the current financial year as demand for high-end goods contracts. In six months to the end of September, Burberry clocked in a sales growth of 4% to £1.4 billion (about $1.7 billion). However, the coat-maker’s operating profit plunged 15% for the same period. Store sales were sharply down in the Americas, while it stayed strong in the Asia Pacific region.

Given the slowdown in its business, Burberry noted that it was “unlikely to achieve” its earlier guidance for full-year earnings figures and that its operating profit would be on the lower end of the target range.

“The slowdown in luxury demand globally is having an impact on current trading. If the weaker demand continues, we are unlikely to achieve our previously stated revenue guidance for FY24,” the company said in its earnings release.

Burberry’s shares fell over 9% as of 11 a.m. GMT on Thursday following the announcement.

The luxury label’s CEO Jonathan Akeroyd pointed to inflation and elevated cost of living as the reasons for why shoppers are pulling back on spending, according to the Financial Times.

“This challenging macro environment is coming across from all regions. I think this has been something that is quite unique because historically, you get softness in one region, you’ll be able to pick it up in the other,” Akeroyd said during a press call.

Burberry’s lackluster sales follow a slew of luxury brands that have seen their sales growth either fall or ease in recent months as macroeconomic volatility weighs heavy on shoppers. Its European rivals, including French behemoths LVMH and Kering, have watched sales disappoint for the last quarter, underscoring the weakness in spending amid rich shoppers.

It isn’t just apparel or bag that people are buying less of—high-end watch brands like Richemont’s Cartier have also taken a hit in the recent quarter.

“Traditionally the wealthy clientele which shop for expensive clothes and accessories are seen as being insulated from the impact of higher borrowing costs and rising prices but apparently they are feeling some of the pain,” said AJ Bell’s investment director Russ Mould in a note sent to Fortune.

As the luxury slump intensifies, only a few players have escaped unscathed so far, such as Birkin bag-maker Hermès.

Burberry’s ‘Britishness’

The brand’s iconic “Burberry Check”—which it has used to design bags, coats and more—has been its signature print from the 1960s onwards. When Akeroyd became CEO last year, the group’s strategy was to channelize its “Britishness” as a way to grow its business and eventually hit £5 billion in sales. Burberry hired British designer Daniel Lee, who recently unveiled his first collection for the brand, as part of the strategy.

The company has had its share of hurdles beyond slowing global sales. Burberry’s chairman Gerry Murphy criticized Prime Minister Rishi Sunak for making Britain the “least attractive” destination for shopping in Europe, after Sunak struck down VAT refunds for tourists.

But that hasn’t let Burberry shift its gaze from its bigger target. Akeroyd said even with macroeconomic uncertainty, he remains confident about Burberry’s path forward.

“We made good progress against our strategic goals, executing our priorities at pace,” he said in a statement. “While the macroeconomic environment has become more challenging recently, we are confident in our strategy to realise our potential as the modern British luxury brand, and we remain committed to achieving our medium and long-term targets.”

Burberry didn’t immediately return Fortune’s request for comment."
Q&A: LVMH's CIO on Giving Luxury Retail a Digital Makeover - Alizila,"Tue, 28 Nov 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFsaXppbGEuY29tL3FhLWx2bWhzLWNpby1vbi1naXZpbmctbHV4dXJ5LXJldGFpbC1hLWRpZ2l0YWwtbWFrZW92ZXIv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Franck le Moal, Group IT Director and CIO of LVMH

|

LVMH is marrying technology and luxury to bring global luxury consumers an omnichannel and immersive customer experience, from digital showrooms, live video purchasing to 360° product presentations.

The French luxury house has partnered with Alibaba Cloud since 2019 to reshape online luxury retail with digital intelligence and AI at all stages of the customer journey, and inject greater agility and resilience into the supply chain.

We caught up with Franck le Moal, Group IT Director and CIO of LVMH, to hear how LVMH embraces technology-enhanced retail.

Stay updated on the digital economy by signing up for our free weekly newsletter

The following Q&A has been edited for brevity and clarity

Q: How does LVMH combine luxury fashion with technology?

A: LVMH has always been a pioneer and most of our Maisons are also pioneers since a long time ago. We place a strong focus on innovation and creativity.

First, we see technology as a strong enabler to enhance our exchange, our relationship, with our customers. For LVMH Maisons, having this strong intimacy and strong interaction with customers to invent a personalized experience is absolutely critical. We believe that technology is able to bring us this unique opportunity.

This is why we continue to invest in omnichannel. We continue to invest in virtual and augmented reality, because we believe that those types of features are a really strong opportunity for our Maisons and the Group to craft a personal experience with our customers.

The second key focus is to enhance the capability of our internal departments. We believe that technology, especially a data-driven AI platform and cloud solution, is a strong enabler for the performance of our manufacturing, supply chain, and omnichannel marketing.

And last but not least, in the world we are living in now, we definitely believe that technology is a strong enabler to help our employees better achieve their objectives and manage their performance.

Q: Are there any brands already using AI or technology where you see the benefit?

A: Let’s say wine & spirits. I think it’s a fantastic use case, especially on the manufacturing side using image analysis.

We are really able to provide great uses for manufacturing, especially in the same Louis Vuitton factory.

We are using data from the supply chain and from various markets in order to finetune the level of products we need to produce in multiple use cases: in fashion, wine & spirits, or perfume divisions.

Q: Why have you worked with Alibaba Cloud since 2019? Is there any benefit we provide that is unique?

A: First of all, and I think it’s important to mention, we have a full hybrid strategy. So, we don’t want to rely on only one cloud provider or one hyperscaler.

We selected Alibaba Cloud in China because we know that China is becoming a specific world within the world of technology. So, that was the reason why we started to engage with Alibaba Cloud four years ago, to create a strong and unique ecosystem in China.

And we believe that if we want to develop ourselves in China, we need to work with the best. And we believe that Alibaba Cloud is one of the best in China. [Alibaba Cloud is part of Alibaba Group.] So this is why we started our partnership in 2019. It has been a great journey because if you look now, four years later, we are using the power of Alibaba and Alibaba Cloud a lot.

We need to work with the best. And we believe that Alibaba Cloud is one of the best in China – Franck le Moal, Group IT Director and CIO of LVMH

We have more than 30 Maisons today using Alibaba Cloud, and the journey starts in China. We expanded our business with Alibaba Cloud in Southeast Asia especially to support Sephora and DFS in Southeast Asia. And why? Because those two brands are also very close to the China ecosystem. So, having the China ecosystem in China, and the power of the Chinese ecosystem and technology ecosystem close to China, is super important.

So, we are also investing in PAI [Platform for Artificial Intelligence] and we believe that PAI will bring us value on the AI side. We are also starting to invest with Tongyi Qianwen on the generative AI side.

But more than that, we see Alibaba Cloud as a global partner. And I want to mention it because you know that we are a big customer of Salesforce, and we are very happy to see the solid, ongoing partnership between Salesforce and Alibaba Cloud.

And we will probably be the one to adopt Salesforce on Alibaba Cloud in China, especially to cover everything related to clienteling [shorthand for catering to clients], CRM and customer services.

So, the capability for Alibaba Cloud to act locally but also to act globally and to have a strategic partnership with our main partner from the U.S. is a great story. It’s a strong partnership and a strong consolidation between two tech giants who are really playing a big part in our technology ecosystem.

Why is LVMH going big with its tiny terroirs? - Wine - Financial Times,"Thu, 23 Nov 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZ0LmNvbS9jb250ZW50L2U2ZDJhMGRjLThjMDMtNDUwYi05MTNlLTVhODk1NzQ2ZDZhYdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Print this page

At the heart of Domaine des Lambrays, Bernard Arnault’s Grand Cru domaine in the Burgundy village of Morey-St Denis, stands a Lebanese cedar that was planted in 1637. It is a magnificent specimen – but it’s still a youngster by the standards of the Domaine, which has monastic roots going at least as far back as the 14th century.

Arnault acquired Lambrays in 2014 and has since been refreshing it. The soon-to-be-released 2022 vintage has already been hailed as a bright new chapter in its history. Lambrays is part of an elite gang of wineries LVMH calls the Vins d’Exception – the other three are Cheval Blanc in Bordeaux, Colgin Cellars in Napa and Sauternes’ fabled Château d’Yquem. All are either wholly or partially owned by LVMH. While most of these need no introduction, they have historically been publicity-shy – but for the first time this month they will go out into the world as an official Vins d’Exception quartet, with their own dedicated website.

LVMH has many exceptional wine producers in its wider portfolio: Cloudy Bay, Dom Pérignon, Krug. So what makes these four different? “Moët Hennessy wines are based on brands and style,” explains Arnault. “Vins d’Exception wines are based on terroirs. Within Vins d’Exception, the focus cannot be on growth or on economic contribution, it must be on preservation, valorisation, and transmission to the next generations of some of the most precious terroirs in the world.”

Few patches of terroir are more precious than Domaine des Lambrays’ historic “clos” – an ancient walled vineyard that runs up the hill behind the limestone winery, undulating like the sea. “Wherever you are in the vineyard, part of it is always hidden,” says winemaker Jacques Devauges. “That variation produces the diverse aromatic profile, the delicacy and grace, that is the personality of Clos des Lambrays.”

We plough and pick by hand – we farm it like a garden

LVMH owns 99.5 per cent of this vineyard – the remaining 428sq m is owned by a neighbour who, despite the might of LVMH, has so far refused to sell. Until he does, the Clos can’t enjoy the distinction of being a fully fledged “monopole” [a vineyard under single ownership].

Devauges and I walk up through the vines in the sunshine, past almond, walnut and cherry trees. A dog barks down in the village; a cock crows; there’s a peal of church bells. “This is our luxury, to be in a situation like they were in the old days, being able to devote ourselves to every last square metre,” he says. “We plough and pick by hand – we farm it like a garden.”

The volume of wine the Vins d’Exception produce is tiny – together, they account for less than 0.1 per cent of LVMH’s total revenue. Every year demand for all four wines far outstrips supply. The real problem for wines of such rarity is getting people to actually pull the cork on them. This is a particular issue, I’m told, for the famously long-lived Château d’Yquem. The cachet attached to owning a vertical of old Yquem vintages is so great that increasing amounts of this sweet golden wine are now languishing un-drunk in private cellars.

In a bid to reassert Yquem’s relevance, the château has created the LightHouse programme, which gives 50 restaurants around the world a preview of the new vintage. Chefs are invited to pair it with any dish (except pudding) and are then free to sell or offer it, on the house, to VIPs. Over the summer, the fairytale-pretty château also hosted a series of Massimo Bottura dinners for enthusiasts and collectors – they will be back with more in 2024.

The no-less bijou Château Cheval Blanc also continues to seduce – it’s said the St Émilion estate’s wines were what got Bernard Arnault interested in fine wine in the first place. Under MD Pierre-Olivier Clouet it has doubled down on sustainability in recent years – it’s been a trailblazer in Bordeaux for permaculture and polycultural practices. Meanwhile, Colgin Cellars, founded in 1992, is the baby of the bunch – but even so, its elegant Cabernet Sauvignon blends give many Bordeaux greats a run for their money.

Might there be room for a grower champagne in the family? “Never say never,” says Arnault’s son, Alexandre, who oversees the project in addition to being a senior executive at Tiffany & Co.

Back in Lambrays, in the shade of the cedar tree, I join the small winemaking team for the daily tasting of the nascent 2023 vintage. “When Monsieur Arnault visited Lambrays he was fascinated by this cedar,” says Devauges. “He couldn’t take his eyes off it.” Perhaps the luxury tycoon was wondering what his own 400-year legacy will be.

The Paris-based company is teaming up with Fairly Made, a French startup that evaluates and scores supply chains based on advanced traceability analysis.

Fairly Made 360°, a Software as a Service (SaaS) platform, develops ratings based on four criteria including transparency, environmental impact, social performance and recyclability. The platform allows brands to assess the sustainability of each garment in a collection, tracing its movement through the value chain to pinpoint areas of impact.

According to LVMH, Fairly Made has so far evaluated 64 products across Patou’s Les Essentiels line of wardrobe staples, including white tank tops, jeans, denim jackets and pants. This will help Patou “set new standards for sustainability and transparency while remaining faithful to its heritage,” LVMH said. Five years ago, the brand launched “The Patou Way,” a sustainability strategy centered on using lower-impact materials such as organic cotton and upcycled leather. Patou is the first of LVMH’s more than 70 brands to use Fairly Made.

The label joins more than 150 other brands, fashion firms and retailers that have already signed up with Fairly Made, including Sandro, Maje and Claudie Pierlot owner SMCP Group, Galeries Lafayette, Ba&sh, Maison Kitsune, Balzac Paris, Asphalte, Aubade, The Kooples and Rossignol.

Following its launch in 2018, Fairly Made became a part of the LVMH Maison des Startups accelerator program. Hosted at the Station F startup campus, a coworking space in Paris that is home to more than 1,000 young companies, the program promotes the co-creation of next generation services and solutions to serve the fashion and luxury sectors.

Founded by LVMH in 2017, the Maison des Startups takes on 50 international upstarts each year, helping them to bring innovative products to market. Beyond the collaborative workspace, accelerator participants receive LVMH staff coaching through workshops and mentoring sessions. It also serves as a conduit between LVMH’s maisons and new technologies that could enhance their operations.

Entrepreneurs in the program gain access to brands in fashion, leather goods, fragrance, watches, jewelry, wine and spirits and owned retail such as Sephora and Le Bon Marché Rive Gauche, and can pitch their solutions to brands in the LVMH portfolio.

Earlier this month, artificial intelligence platform Permutable AI named the Louis Vuitton, Givenchy and Fendi owner the top fashion firm in a study of consumer sentiment on ESG performance."

French luxury house LVMH has collaborated with Alibaba Cloud to transform the online luxury retail landscape. This partnership focused on utilising digital intelligence and AI throughout the customer journey, aiming to enhance agility and resilience in the supply chain.

Franck le Moal, Group IT Director and CIO of LVMH, discussed the partnership’s impact: “We see Alibaba Cloud as a global partner. And I want to mention it because you know that we are a big customer of Salesforce, and we are very happy to see the solid, ongoing partnership between Salesforce and Alibaba Cloud.

“The capability for Alibaba Cloud to act locally but also to act globally and to have a strategic partnership with our main partner from the US is a great story.”

Under this partnership, over 30 LVMH Maisons have adopted Alibaba Cloud’s products and services to redefine luxury retail in the AI era.

Additionally, LVMH is expanding this collaboration into Southeast Asia, supporting brands such as Sephora and DFS. The companies are also exploring innovative applications of generative AI using Alibaba’s proprietary large language model, Tongyi Qianwen.

LVMH’s strategy involves integrating technology into luxury fashion, enhancing customer interaction and creating personalised experiences. This approach includes investments in omnichannel, virtual and augmented reality, and AI-driven platforms for internal departments like manufacturing, supply chain, and marketing.

When asked about brands already benefiting from AI, Franck le Moal highlighted: “Let’s say wine and spirits.

Scroll down to use Glossy+ Comments, giving the Glossy+ community the opportunity to join discussions around industry topics.

The latest acquisition by LVMH’s Thélios, of California-based eyewear brand Barton Perreira, reflects a focus on gateway luxury products, growing luxury categories, “quiet luxury” and differentiation via product quality.

On November 6, LVMH announced that its 6-year-old eyewear arm, Thélios, had acquired Barton Perreira, for a reported $80 million. Thélios, which started as a joint venture between LVMH and eyewear group Marcolin, has been solely owned by LVMH since 2021. The company designs, manufactures and distributes sunglasses and optical frames for LVMH’s fashion brands, including Dior, Loewe, Fendi and Celine. Prior to Barton Perreira, Thélios acquired the French outdoor eyewear brand Vuarnet and the Longarone-based manufacturing facility of Italian eyewear company Safilo Group, both in September.

Barton Perreira was founded in 2007 by Bill Barton and Patty Perreira, who formerly worked for Oliver Peoples as CEO and head designer, respectively. Both left the company following its acquisition by Oakley in 2006. The following year, Luxottica Group bought Oakley for a reported $2.1 billion. For 2022, eyewear leader EssilorLuxottica reported sales of €24.5 billion, or around $26.8 billion, marking an annual increase of 14%. EssilorLuxottica owns or licenses eyewear for more than 150 brands, including Ray-Ban, Chanel and Prada. Thélios CEO Alessandro Zanardo is a Luxottica alum.

“We believed we could elevate what we were doing [at Oliver Peoples],” said Bill Barton, CEO of Barton Perreira, explaining the impetus for the brand’s initial launch. “We’ve always believed in doing product at an incredibly high level, and we made a commitment when we launched that we weren’t going to compromise on product, in any way.”

The brand’s product-first focus is fueled by both the design prowess of Perreira and its 100% Japan-based production, Barton said. He added that his relationships with Japanese manufacturers date back to 1988. Barton Perreira makes glasses in limited runs, with most selling for $400-$500. It’s collaborated with brands including Fear of God and “James Bond,” and its repeat and young shopper bases are growing, Barton said.

Along with Barton Perreira’s Japanese manufacturing, key selling points for Thélios included its growth opportunities in new and current markets. Barton Perreira now sells in the U.S., Canada and Europe, but not yet in Asia. For Barton Perreira, Thélios’s commitments related to marketing and “amazing products” reflecting the brand’s heritage, as well as its plan to soon open new Barton Perreira stores in the U.S. and Europe, were enticing. And, of course, there was the security factor.

“We were a small company, but we’re now getting magnified,” Barton said. “And it’s good to know that the brand will still be a big deal long after I’m [retired].” The roles of Barton, Perreira and their team members are set to remain unchanged post-acquisition. The announced deal was also finalized this month.

In the U.S., Barton Perreia operates five stores, in cities including New York, Aspen and Kansas City, Barton’s hometown. But a majority of its sales are via wholesale partners. Also based on Barton’s long-established relationships, the brand was scooped up by buyers at Barneys, Neiman Marcus, Saks Fifth Avenue and Bergdorf Goodman out of the gate.

“That [adoption] by non-optical accounts is unheard of for independent brands, because you’re going up against Chanel and Dior,” Barton said. “But those retail partners have been [crucial to] our success.”

Largely, however, the brand’s sales are optical frames sold by opticians, optometrists and ophthalmologists.

Several LVMH brands, including Loro Piana and Berluti, are decidedly “quiet luxury,” a classification that’s caught on over the last couple of years. Likewise, Barton Perreira fits the bill.

“Our frames don’t feature a lot of bells and whistles,” Barton said, referencing the brand’s intentional avoidance of trends. “We [focus on] product fit and balance, and Patty designs for the face. We love the purity of what she does. … We have our own internal direction, and we have to listen to and trust that.” In spring, the brand launched rimless frames, a category it’s since expanded.

Thélios’s priorities are aligned. “They’re really focused on luxury — having beautiful luxury brands and maximizing their potential,” Barton said. “They’re not looking for Barton Perreira to be a Ray-Ban. Our frames are never going to be mass-produced.”

For independent eyewear brands, EssilorLuxottica’s scale has made for a challenging retail environment. For example, in 2021, Garrett Leight, son of Oliver Peoples founder Larry Leight, sold a majority stake in his then-11-year-old Garrett Leight California Optical company, citing the need for growth capital.

“We’re more attainable than many brands, but you get the same quality of product,” Garrett Leight said on a Glossy Podcast episode earlier this month. “Some of the luxury design houses, or household names — Chanel, Prada, Gucci — are selling glasses for $200 more than ours. And they’re more mass-produced.”

Meanwhile, since 2021, Kering’s Kering Eyewear, established in 2014, has acquired Danish eyewear brand Lindberg and U.S.-based brand Maui Jim, as well as the French eyewear manufacturer UNT.

In its latest quarterly earnings statement, in October, LVMH reported slowed growth, with revenue increasing 9% year-over-year, falling short of analyst expectations. Its shares subsequently fell to their lowest level of the year.

The global eyewear market was reportedly worth $107 billion in 2022, and it’s expected to see consistent single-digit growth to reach $323.8 billion by 2030.

Before Thélios, Barton Perreira had four owners. In addition to Barton and Perreira, they included the brand’s CFO-COO, Robert Fiddler, and former in-house marketer Tim Cadiente."
LVMH Moët Hennessy - Louis Vuitton Société Européenne (EPA:MC) Could Be A Buy For Its Upcoming Dividend - Simply Wall St,"Wed, 29 Nov 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMitAFodHRwczovL3NpbXBseXdhbGwuc3Qvc3RvY2tzL2ZyL2NvbnN1bWVyLWR1cmFibGVzL2VwYS1tYy9sdm1oLW1vZXQtaGVubmVzc3ktbG91aXMtdnVpdHRvbi1zb2NpZXRlLWV1cm9wZWVubmUtc2hhcmVzL25ld3MvbHZtaC1tb3QtaGVubmVzc3ktbG91aXMtdnVpdHRvbi1zb2NpdC1ldXJvcGVubmUtZXBhbWMtY291bGTSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LVMH Moët Hennessy - Louis Vuitton, Société Européenne ( ) is about to trade ex-dividend in the next 4 days. The ex-dividend date is one business day before a company's record date, which is the date on which the company determines which shareholders are entitled to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is an important date to be aware of as any purchase of the stock made on or after this date might mean a late settlement that doesn't show on the record date. Thus, you can purchase LVMH Moët Hennessy - Louis Vuitton Société Européenne's shares before the 4th of December in order to receive the dividend, which the company will pay on the 6th of December.

The company's next dividend payment will be €5.50 per share, on the back of last year when the company paid a total of €12.00 to shareholders. Based on the last year's worth of payments, LVMH Moët Hennessy - Louis Vuitton Société Européenne has a trailing yield of 1.8% on the current stock price of €684.5. We love seeing companies pay a dividend, but it's also important to be sure that laying the golden eggs isn't going to kill our golden goose! So we need to check whether the dividend payments are covered, and if earnings are growing.

Dividends are typically paid from company earnings. If a company pays more in dividends than it earned in profit, then the dividend could be unsustainable. LVMH Moët Hennessy - Louis Vuitton Société Européenne paid out a comfortable 39% of its profit last year. Yet cash flow is typically more important than profit for assessing dividend sustainability, so we should always check if the company generated enough cash to afford its dividend. Dividends consumed 57% of the company's free cash flow last year, which is within a normal range for most dividend-paying organisations.

It's positive to see that LVMH Moët Hennessy - Louis Vuitton Société Européenne's dividend is covered by both profits and cash flow, since this is generally a sign that the dividend is sustainable, and a lower payout ratio usually suggests a greater margin of safety before the dividend gets cut.

Have Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?

Stocks in companies that generate sustainable earnings growth often make the best dividend prospects, as it is easier to lift the dividend when earnings are rising. If earnings fall far enough, the company could be forced to cut its dividend. That's why it's comforting to see LVMH Moët Hennessy - Louis Vuitton Société Européenne's earnings have been skyrocketing, up 25% per annum for the past five years.

Another key way to measure a company's dividend prospects is by measuring its historical rate of dividend growth. Since the start of our data, 10 years ago, LVMH Moët Hennessy - Louis Vuitton Société Européenne has lifted its dividend by approximately 15% a year on average. It's great to see earnings per share growing rapidly over several years, and dividends per share growing right along with it.

To Sum It Up

From a dividend perspective, should investors buy or avoid LVMH Moët Hennessy - Louis Vuitton Société Européenne? Earnings per share have grown at a nice rate in recent times and over the last year, LVMH Moët Hennessy - Louis Vuitton Société Européenne paid out less than half its earnings and a bit over half its free cash flow.

EXCLUSIVE: Louis Vuitton Extends Contract of Nicolas Ghesquière - WWD,"Tue, 14 Nov 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3dkLmNvbS9mYXNoaW9uLW5ld3MvZGVzaWduZXItbHV4dXJ5L2xvdWlzLXZ1aXR0b24tbmljb2xhcy1naGVzcXVpZXJlLWNvbnRyYWN0LTEyMzU5MTY1MjQv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"In a sign of continuity at the world’s biggest luxury brand — and recognition of his significant contribution to its impressive growth trajectory — Louis Vuitton has renewed the contract of Nicolas Ghesquière for another five years, WWD has learned.

The development comes as the designer marks his 10th anniversary as the brand’s artistic director of women’s collections.

“I’m very happy, and also very honored for this trust,” Ghesquière said, confirming the contract extension in an exclusive interview. “Of course, it’s very fulfilling to see the achievement of 10 years being transformed into a new chapter.”

It marks the second big decision for Vuitton’s new chairman and chief executive officer Pietro Beccari, who shortly after assuming the management helm last February named U.S. musician and entrepreneur Pharrell Williams as creative director of Vuitton’s menswear division.

“I think Nicolas is one of the best talents in terms of creative direction,” Beccari enthused in an interview. “He is very directional, able to anticipate the future, to understand trends and to create trends, which I think a market leader should have. And on the other side, he has a deep knowledge of the brand — of its icons, of its history.”

Beccari also touted Ghesquière’s proven track record of creating hit leather goods, from the Petite Malle he introduced with his debut show for fall 2014 in the Louvre’s Cour Carrée to the recently relaunched GO-14, a shoulder jewel he first designed back in 2014 and remastered for the fall 2023 runway last March.

The GO-14 is prominently featured on the shoulders of “Squid Game” star HoYeon Jung and actress Deepika Padukone in Vuitton’s latest ad campaign. A tribute to the maison’s master trunk-makers, the quilted bag reprises the cross-hatched “malletage” technique found inside the lids of archival trunks.

While French luxury giant LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton does not provide revenue breakdowns for its galaxy of more than 70 brands, it is understood that revenues at Vuitton have tripled since Ghesquière joined in 2013 after a 15-year career catapulting Balenciaga to the forefront of the Paris fashion agenda.

According to market sources, under Ghesquière’s creative leadership and the management of Beccari’s predecessor Michael Burke and Burke’s second-in-command Delphine Arnault, annual sales of women’s ready-to-wear multiplied by more than five.

The same sources estimated that annual sales of shoes and leather goods from Ghesquière’s runway collections have grown fourfold, with half of the top-10 sellers in footwear hailing from the wardrobe the designer has been building.

Known for his exacting, couture-like approach, and an experimental zeal rare among designers at Europe’s largest luxury brands, Ghesquière has unleashed a host of accessories that have become permanent products.

Among the bags are the Twist, Petite Boîte Chapeau, Palm Springs, Cannes, Dauphine, Coussin, Loop, Side Trunk, Camera Box and Atlantis models, while recurrent footwear styles include Archlight sneakers, Beaubourg ankle boots, Star Trail ankle boots and puffy Pillow boots.

In the interview, which took place in a hushed suite at the Ritz hotel, Ghesquière noted that he conceives handbags and shoes as integral elements of his fashion silhouette, recognizable by such items as patchwork leather jackets, varsity jackets and unique trouser styles. “It’s not separate elements that are styled together,” he stressed. “In terms of designing, we think about it all together; we make everything with the same intention and the same passion.”

Beccari described Ghesquière as a true designer and couturier who sketches everything by hand. “There are not many that are able to do that,” he said. “Also, he’s French and embedded in the French culture, like Louis Vuitton is.”

Indeed, Ghesquière has long been the go-to designer for style icon Brigitte Macron, the first lady of France, and he also created the costumes for a new production of 1970s French rock opera “Starmania” — arguably the most famous and successful French musical of all time. Its second Paris engagement kicks off Tuesday at La Seine Musicale and runs through Jan. 28.

Meanwhile, Beccari described Williams as a quick study in fashion with a “great sense of trend, and a great sense of aesthetics… but not a couturier.”

“So I think the mix of the two [talents] is an explosive one,” he said. “I am very proud of having this incredible couple of creative directors, and I’m happy to do another five years with Nicolas and show the world what we can do together.”

To be sure, Beccari wasted little time expanding Ghesquière’s remit and adding a pre-fall destination runway show, the first unfurling at a monumental event staged on the Jamsugyo bridge in Seoul last April.

“That’s one of the genius things about Pietro — to think outside the box,” Ghesquière said, recounting that when Beccari discovered his pre-collection in the studio, he decided on the spot that it deserved a huge spotlight.

“For me, it was a very exciting experience,” the designer related. “It made me feel good because those pre-collections are not less than other collections. They just didn’t make it to the catwalk.”

Beccari lauded Ghesquière’s ability to “put things on the catwalk that may not be immediately understood because they are too soon, but then they become a trend.”

As an example, he mentioned how Vuitton’s cruise 2017 show in Rio de Janeiro anticipated the convergence of sport and athletic elements in women’s fashion.

Beccari also touted Ghesquière’s sense of detail, which he compared to that possessed by the late, great Karl Lagerfeld, with whom he worked when he was CEO of Fendi in Rome from 2012 to 2018.

“Nicolas is very detail oriented and almost a maniac of perfection,” he said, also mentioning his “deep knowledge of materials and textiles.”

Asked if he put any creative or business imperatives before Ghesquière as the designer enters his second decade designing for Vuitton, Beccari said, “What I’ve learned is that creative people should be put in conditions that allow them to give their very best. If there’s one thing I think I do well is to create such conditions, ensuring good vibes and good energy to let free their creativity.

“That’s our role, to make them feel at ease, to feel supported, trusted and able to express their creativity,” he continued, describing commercial success as a shared responsibility. “For me, the creative director is a partner in a very important adventure because we are carrying the weight of the biggest maison of the group.

“We are very ambitious for Louis Vuitton women’s. We are both full of great hope, and great ambition,” Beccari added.

The executive, who previously put Dior on a stupendous growth trajectory, described himself as a “very present CEO” who meets with each of Vuitton’s creative directors at least three times a month.

Ghesquière described their rapport as “very direct, and very easy as he is one floor above me. He can show up in my office, I can show up in his — it’s as simple as that. So the communication is really constructive and creative… His demands are really inspiring, and interesting.”

“I am a team player and an orchestra director, and I like people to contribute and to be happy for the success of the business,” Beccari said. “I’m happy to have secured the greatest talents for Louis Vuitton and I’m quite optimistic about our success for the future.”

Over an hour-long conversation, Ghesquière reflected on his first decade at the brand, and stressed the value of a long tenure in an industry prone to musical chairs. (A recent WWD analysis of designer appointments showed that half the creative directors at roughly 40 houses have been in their positions for five years or less.)

“I think it takes time to build codes, to build an aesthetic — to solidify a style beyond fashion,” Ghesquière told WWD. “That’s certainly what makes the difference at Vuitton, those values, that vision from the group management to make sure we are hitting the season with great fashion shows and a great presentation, but more than everything building longevity — in the trust of the clients, in the trust of everyone… It’s great that we are sharing this commitment of working together long-term.”

In his view, Vuitton remains “full of possibilities” as its fashion history is relatively short, allowing him to “participate in writing a new aesthetic.”

Ghesquière is only the second designer to lead Vuitton’s womenswear after Marc Jacobs, the American designer conscripted in 1997 to bring the company into the modern fashion age and introduce ready-to-wear, shoes, fashion jewelry and eyewear to a brand that had been known primarily for luggage and handbags.

“The world of Vuitton is very rich,” Ghesquière said of the house, established in 1854 and famous for its monogram canvas and legacy of creating products for travel as it evolved from steamships to cars and jets.

The designer said he often mines the archives of Vuitton, and fashion history, too, as he imagines new directions for fashion.

“To build great fashion for the future, you have to look at the past very carefully,” he said, stressing the need to understand how social transformations were reflected in how people lived and dressed.

Asked about his proudest achievements at Vuitton so far, Ghesquière mentioned initiating destination cruise shows, the first in 2014 at Palace du Palais, Monaco.

“The brand has so much credibility in traveling with collections,” said Ghesquière, who has orchestrated each cruise show around an architectural marvel — buildings by John Lautner, Oscar Niemeyer, I.M. Pei, Joseph Lluis Sert, and Eero Saarinen, to name a few — or a stunning garden.

Ghesquière also said he’s proud that the silhouette he’s developed at Vuitton is now very recognizable.

“It’s an interesting achievement that we will improve, develop and make even stronger for the next year,” he said. “There is a strong intention to develop what we did for the last decade — to consolidate and develop the new elements and the new codes that we created.”

The designer paid tribute to the “strong team” around him, most of its members having also logged a decade or more at the house. “That shows a lot that I’m not the only one to be committed in that mission, that we really share that that passion for the house and for creating new elements for the house.”

Hailing from the small French town of Loudun and without any formal fashion training, Ghesquière got his start in fashion by filing, photocopying and cataloguing fabrics at Jean Paul Gaultier, ultimately landing at Balenciaga and designing lowly licensed lines, including office uniforms, bridal gowns and widows’ dresses for Japan.

Once promoted to the helm of Balenciaga’s main rtw line in 1997, he quickly won acclaim for sculpted designs straddling futuristic and Parisian chic. For three seasons he also designed collections for the Milan-based house of Callaghan.

In the interview, Ghesquière said he recognized very early in his career that fashion stood at the crossroads of many creative realms, including fine art, film, music and theater. Hence his freewheeling artistic collaborations during his first decade at Vuitton, including ones with artist Phillipe Parreno, fashion editor Grace Coddington, costume designer Milena Canonero, filmmaker Hwang Dong-hyuk and musicians Woodkid and Sophie.

The designer stressed that the job of creative director has changed dramatically since he first started, now requiring him to not only create new fashions but also an atmosphere, moment and narrative that can carry through into store windows and environments, client experiences, communication campaigns and the culture at large.

A good example of the latter would be his fall 2020 show for Vuitton, titled “If the Past Could Look at Us” and staged against a tableau of 200 characters dressed in costumes spanning five centuries. It foreshadowed a Vuitton-sponsored exhibition at the Costume Institute at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, “About Time: Fashion and Duration,” that elaborated on the theme of temporality.

“It’s very impressive because you become — with great help — a bit of a director, a bit of a producer of entertainment, a bit of a writer, a bit of a musical expert,” Ghesquière mused. “It’s great, because I’ve learned so much beyond designing clothes, bags and shoes and other things about how to deliver a message through this special moment.

“What is exciting and rewarding for me is that constant quest to make a relevant proposition,” he added. “You have to take risks.”

In case you were wondering, the gong that sounds outside of each of Ghesquière’s Vuitton shows is meant to signal the start of the “experience,” functioning as a countdown to a unique live performance. “I love this idea that the fashion show is something very unique in a very precise moment,” he said.

By now, Ghesquière is known for his inventive mixture of historical designs and futuristic, science-fiction elements that he likes to call “time clash.” A famous example was when he paired 18th-century embroidered redingotes with athletic shorts and sneakers for Vuitton’s spring 2018 collection.

The designer has also assembled an eclectic cast of Vuitton ambassadors, which reflect his pluralistic approach to womenswear and his belief in continuity and loyalty, considering the likes of Jennifer Connolly and Emma Stone have been associated with him for ages.

It’s his conviction that celebrities choose Vuitton as much as the brand chooses them. “I also love all the dialogue we have together about their projects, or projects together like when Alicia Vikander asked me to design the clothes for ‘Irma Vep,’ for example,” he said. “LV is also a big house. So it’s beautiful to have a multiple representation of people.

“A sense of individuality is very important for our ambassadors. They’re not all the same, and they don’t look all the same, and we don’t dress them all the same,” he added. “I think it’s more sophisticated for LV to make individuality shine, while keeping a very strong style. It’s easier said than done.”

When the designer joined the house back in 2013, LVMH chairman and CEO Bernard Arnault made clear that one of his missions was to create new bags and fashion elements that could become “part of the modern patrimony of LV.”

Ghesquière recalled showing Arnault his sketch for the Petite Malle, a miniature version of Vuitton’s iconic trunk with similar hardware and savoir-faire, and explaining the concept behind it.

Immediately Arnault envisioned a wall with multiple shelves devoted to displaying the little trunks in different colors, telling Ghesquière, “We’ll make it something very iconic for the future of Louis Vuitton.”

“That says a lot, because for everything — creating campaigns, creating products, creating shows — he’s always there to listen, to share and, of course, give his opinion. And that is something that I appreciate, his respect for the designer,” Ghesquière marveled. “His love for art, and his love for creation, it’s truly incredible. He has a vision that is very intuitive, and very forward-thinking, sometimes beyond your own vision, which is very stimulating.”

Asked if he finds intimidating the scale of Vuitton and its importance to the group’s fortunes, the designer acknowledged that the pressure of expectation is strong.

Yet after returning from a swing through China, and witnessing the passion and dedication of store teams, he feels heartened. “It is intimidating, but I don’t feel alone in that situation. I feel responsible, but there are hundreds of talents around me.

“But you know, I would say that it’s also good to be intimidated,” he mused. “It’s great to have your heart pounding before your show is starting, feeling the excitement and the adrenaline that goes with this responsibility. I love it.”"

Jean-Marc Mansvelt, who has led Chaumet since 2014, will become the CEO of the French luxury conglomerate’s Berluti brand, which carries men’s fashion, jewelry and accessories, LVMH said last week. He will succeed LVMH-owner Bernard Arnault’s son, Antoine Arnault, who will carry on as chairman of the brand.

“With the exceptional transformation [at Chaumet] led by Jean-Marc, the important structural projects he drove, and the strong team he built, Chaumet is now fully ready to enter its next chapter,” said Stéphane Bianchi, CEO of LVMH’s watches and jewelry division.

Meanwhile, Mansvelt’s role at Chaumet will be filled by Charles Leung, who has been the CEO of Fred for the past five years. The move is a return for Leung, who spent 12 years at Chaumet from 2006 until 2018, first as managing director of Asia-Pacific, and then as vice president of international sales and distribution. LVMH is currently searching for a replacement to lead Fred, it noted.

“Under [Leung’s] leadership, Fred consolidated its unique positioning within LVMH jewelry brands and experienced a strong and healthy growth, opening new markets,” Bianchi added. “After these last five years with Fred, I am very pleased to see Charles coming back to Chaumet. I am convinced that with his strong drive and business acumen, his understanding of the jewelry industry and of the different markets, he will take Chaumet to greater heights.”

Created back in 2013, the LVMH Prize for Young Fashion Designers is open to fashion designers from around the world aged 18 to 40 who have designed at least two ready-to-wear collections feminine, masculine or unisex.

“The Prize is entering its 11th edition and, this year, I am delighted to mark our attachment to an essential value of creation, know-how.

The Savoir Faire Prize marks the first time LVMH will reward excellence in craftsmanship, technical innovation in the service of creativity, and sustainability. Designed to celebrate exceptional craftsmanship, this new prize aims to also promote the transmission skills.



The existing two prizes have a distinct jury system, with a semi-final composed of several score of industry experts; and a final made up of a group of LVMH creative directors, and a handful of LVMH executives.



The Savoir Faire Prize is designed to distinguish a young brand selected from among the finalists. It will be judged by a new group of experts, to be revealed soon.



“Their appointment will reflect this quest of artisanal excellence,” LVMH added.



All three prizes are rich ones. The winner of the LVMH Prize for Young Fashion Designers will receive an endowment of €400,000 and personalized mentoring by the LVMH teams. The winner of the Karl Lagerfeld Prize receives €200,000 and a year of LVMH mentoring. The Savoir-Faire Prize is worth €200,000 plus mentoring.



The LVMH prizes have developed a pretty impressive track record of unearthing young talent. The top award has been nabbed by the likes of S.S. Daley, Nensi Dojaka, and . While the second recognition – whose exact name had evolved - has been awarded to designers like Jacquemus, and .

This marks the 11th edition of the LVMH Prize. Candidates, which number into their thousands, will have until January 7, 2024, to register their dossier on lvmhprize.com. The semi-final will take place between February 29 and March 1, during the next for women’s ready-to-wear.



Curiously, LVMH did not announce the date of the prize’s final, though in recent years this has often been in early June.



A LVMH-paid-for documentary by the noted fashion cineaste covering the first decade of the prize will be unveiled on YouTube on November 8, 2023.

PARIS (Reuters) -Antoine Arnault, one of Bernard Arnault's five children, will step back from the day-to-day management of upmarket menswear label Berluti in January, LVMH said on Wednesday, fuelling speculation about his next role.

All the LVMH CEO's children hold important positions in the luxury goods group and are closely watched for any signs that one could become favourite to succeed the 74-year-old, who has not indicated he plans to step down.

Although Antoine, 46, has the highest profile, the others are stepping more into the public eye as they move up the LVMH ranks, including his older sister Delphine, who became CEO of the its second-biggest fashion label Dior in February.

Antoine is also in charge of image and environment at LVMH, and credited with negotiating a high-profile deal for the company to sponsor next summer's Paris Olympic Games. He will remain chairman of Berluti, which he has managed since 2012, as well as fashion brand Loro Piana.

""From its heritage as a shoe specialist, Berluti has come a long way to become a full-fledged Maison for men,"" said Toni Belloni, LVMH group managing director, citing ""remarkable"" revenue and profit growth at the label.

LVMH does not give financial figures for individual brands.

""Contrary to Loro Piana, which is booming, I believe Berluti has yet to find a winning formula,"" said Luca Solca, analyst with Bernstein.

Berluti will design the Olympics and Paralympics opening ceremony uniforms for the French teams, raising the profile of the brand known for its buffed leather shoes and tailored suits.

Jean-Marc Mansvelt, CEO of historic jewellery label Chaumet, will become CEO of Berluti, while Charles Leung, CEO of jewellery label Fred, will become CEO of Chaumet.

LVMH said it will seek a successor for Leung, who recently created a buzz by introducing high-end jewellery featuring lab-created diamonds.

She has spent recent years developing new sustainable fabrics such as Econyl, a 100% recycled and recyclable nylon, and luxury leather substitutes made from plants. McCartney is also a founding investor in Collab SOS, a $200 million fund to support the development of circular materials.

What is the single most important action you think the public, or a specific company or government, needs to take in the next year to advance the climate agenda?

Since day one, in my personal life as well as in my business, animals and their welfare have driven me and my vision. When I connected this ethos with the impact animal agriculture has on the environment after learning from Livestock’s Long Shadow report 17 years ago, it all clicked. Over 1 billion animals are killed to supply leather to the fashion industry every year, so for me the single most important thing for the public, businesses, and governments is to focus on animal agriculture and how it impacts our industry.

Fashion is one of the most harmful industries to the planet. Animal agriculture accounts for approximately 14.5% of the world’s greenhouse gas emissions, which is about equal to the transport industry at 14%. This is where leather comes from. Not only is leather driving the destruction of our rainforests, but it is also releasing toxic chemicals into the environment which are also entering local water systems. It needs to be tanned with carcinogenic chemicals that are drastically shortening the lives of factory workers, often in the most impoverished nations. It is cruel on every level.

Businesses need to transition away from these conventional, harmful materials and methods that hurt workers and animals. We need to get creative and innovative with alternatives, moving beyond the limited materials that the industry has been working with traditionally. If we work collaboratively with these goals, we can actually begin doing business in a way that regenerates our planet instead of only taking from it.

The public too has an integral role to play by demanding transparency and accountability from brands and governments. Meanwhile, governments need to create incentives for fashion businesses to work in a more sustainable way. This is a direct result of the leather industry’s lobbying and is counter-productive to our shared goals of fighting the climate crisis and protecting our planet for future generations.

What sustainability effort do you hope will gain popularity with the general public this year, and why?

Since the shift away from animal products and byproducts is one of many efforts that I’m most passionate about, alternative material innovation is the sustainability effort I have always championed.

I’m so proud that here at Stella McCartney we have been leather- and fur-free since I founded my brand in 2001, and I’ve invested in these animal-free alternatives for decades. Through the sustainable investment fund I co-founded, SOS Fund, we have helped to further advancements in the next generation of material innovation and technology. There is now an incredibly wide range of eco-friendly materials for both companies and consumers to choose from, from plant-based leather to infinitely recyclable fabrics.

I am incredibly proud to craft accessories from MIRUM by NFW, which is a plant-based, plastic-free alternative to animal leather that requires no water or tanning. We were the first fashion house to send this pioneering material down a runway and are using it in more pieces every season.

In my recent Summer 2024 runway show, we worked with the visionaries at Keel Labs on a seaweed-based yarn, Kelsun, grown from renewable and regenerative kelp that uses the ocean’s resources to protect it. This could also offer a planet-friendly alternative to cotton, which accounts for 2.5% of the world’s arable land and 16% of all pesticide use. Kelsun uses 70 times less water than conventional cotton, and 100% less land and pesticide use. This is the future of fashion.

Innovators need investment. Without, they cannot scale—or survive. An example that I am heartbroken over is Bolt Threads, who innovated the Mylo, which was a mycelium-based alternative to leather. We had been working with them for over five years to pioneer and perfect this material but without enough industry and consumer support, they had to stall production indefinitely.

Part of my role as special advisor on sustainability to LVMH CEO Monsieur Arnault is introducing these innovators not only to LVMH Maisons but the wider industry so that they can get the support they need, and this never happens again.

What is a climate technology that isn’t getting the attention or funding it deserves?

We all know that sustainability has become a bit of a buzzword, which I hate. What does it even mean? For me, this is so much more than a trend and a marketing ploy. It is something that I feel so deeply in my heart that we must do to protect our fellow creatures, our planet, and our children’s futures.

At the end of the day, this is not only good for our collective wellbeing, but is also good business. The equivalent of a truck-full of clothing goes to landfill or incinerators every second. This is a huge opportunity for any company willing to be brave and bold enough to tackle it.

Circularity is a technology that deserves not only further corporate investment, but legislation from our leaders. By forcing companies to reuse and repurpose what we already have, we can help to limit the amount of virgin natural materials we extract from the planet and reduce our impacts.

Two that really excite me at the moment are innovative textile recycling and the ability to create new materials through direct air capture of greenhouse gasses.

We are seeing the development of technologies capable of breaking down used garments into their basic fibers, which can then be reused to create new, high-quality fabrics—such as Protein Evolution, which I am already investing in both through my brand and SOS Fund. Further examples include new initiatives that are able to create materials from greenhouse gasses, which is so exciting to me and we’re working with a number of innovators across this space too.

These kinds of circular approaches can not only dramatically reduce waste and the demand for virgin materials, but also ultimately lead to a new form of sustainable business that is integral to our survival.

Nov 3, 2023

is currently ubiquitous in major sporting events, from the Rugby to the America’s Cup and the Ballon d’Or Award, alongside football stars and Olympic champions. In the last few weeks, the luxury giant has announced several new sport sponsorship deals made by its leading labels, seeking to maximise their visibility in the sporting world ahead of the Paris 2024 Olympic and Paralympic Games, of which LVMH is a premium partner. And with the goal of strengthening the group’s image as a winner in all arenas.

LVMH has for a long time been a key sponsorship partner to the sporting world, notably supplying trophy cases for some of the most prestigious sporting competitions, made by trunk-maker , but also with classic kit sponsorship deals for various top teams, and above all individual football and basketball stars, who have replaced celebrities among runway show guests. But this autumn, LVMH’s sponsorship announcements are coming thick and fast, like never before. The latest deal, announced on Thursday November 2, is between Christian and French wheelchair tennis player Pauline Déroulède, chosen by the label as its brand ambassador for the Paris 2024 Olympic and Paralympic Games.



In July, LVMH announced it had become one of the Paris Games’ premium partners. The value of the sponsorship was not disclosed, though it is estimated to be in the region of €150 million. LVMH is one of the event’s seven premium French partners, alongside Accor, the BPCE group, , EDF, Orange and Sanofi. The luxury giant is keen to maximise the sponsorship’s returns, tapping the event’s global resonance, especially the opening ceremony’s, which for the first time might not be held inside a stadium but along the river Seine's banks, in the heart of the French capital.

Right from the start, LVMH has made it plain it wants to play a central role. “Between now and the opening ceremony, as agreed with the organising committee, the group and its labels - notably Louis Vuitton, Dior and - will reveal the various facets of their partnership, which will allow LVMH to be the ‘Artisan of all victories’,” the group stated in July. Other LVMH labels will be involved, like jeweller , which will design the medals, beauty chain , which will feature in the Olympic torch relay, and champagne producer Moët Hennessy, involved in hospitality initiatives.



Meanwhile, various LVMH labels have chosen French Olympians as brand ambassadors. Déroulède, Dior's latest ambassador, is the fourth athlete chosen by the group’s labels. In early October, Dior picked another ambassador, four-time European artistic gymnastics champion Mélanie de Jésus dos Santos, while Louis Vuitton signed up three-time world swimming champion Léon Marchand, and Guadalupe-born fencer Enzo Lefort, a multi-medal winner in foil.



With these Olympic sponsorships, LVMH wants to reach a similar level as the event’s worldwide partners, multinationals like Coca Cola and Visa. By choosing sport as a communication vehicle, the group is also highlighting the value of success, drawing a parallel between corporate achievements and sporting performance. It is also a way to give voice to the group as a fully fledged entity, and to put its name centre-stage, a space usually occupied by its labels. Finally, partnering the gives the chance to prove that his group is present in all the world’s most prestigious events.







This year, Louis Vuitton has partnered the Ballon d’Or (Golden football) award for the first time - AM+PM@Artlist



It may not have been purely by chance then that Louis Vuitton, the flagship label of Bernard Arnault’s group, announced in September it would link up again with the Rugby World Cup 2023, staged on French soil, supplying the official case for the trophy awarded on October 28. Then, Louis Vuitton announced it was again - after a seven-year hiatus - a partner of the America’s Cup, the historic sailing competition, whose 37th edition will be held in Barcelona in 2024. The competition’s qualification match races will again be called the Louis Vuitton Cup. The French label will manufacture the Louis Vuitton Cup trophy and its case, as well as the case for the Auld Mug, the silver ewer awarded to the America’s Cup winner.



Louis Vuitton produces the trophy cases for many other famous sporting events, among them those for the Football World Cup, the Monaco F1 Grand Prix, the Davis Cup and the tennis tournament. a few days ago, the label unveiled its first collaboration with the Ballon d’Or (Golden football), the trophy awarded each year to the world's best football players.



The Ballon d’Or, in its monogrammed case handmade by Louis Vuitton’s artisans, was awarded on October 30 at a gala evening where most of the global football stars present were dressed by LVMH labels.

Off-White: will Virgil Abloh's brand be bought by LVMH? - nss magazine,"Mon, 06 Nov 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5zc21hZy5jb20vZW4vZmFzaGlvbi8zNDc4Ny9vZmYtd2hpdGUtbG12aC1mYXJmZXRjaNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Yesterday, independent journalist Astrid Wendlandt, better known as Miss Tweed, published an article on her own site revealing that, very soon, LVMH may acquire Off-White in its entirety, buying the manufacturing license from Farfetch and resolving the knot that has been making ownership of the brand quite tangled for at least five years. To clarify the issue: Off-White was the only New Guards Group brand owned by Virgil Abloh and was produced and distributed by the group through a licensing agreement whose deadline was 2035 but could have been renegotiated in 2026. This agreement had then passed into the hands of Farfetch when the company acquired New Guards Group in 2019. In 2021, while he was being promoted to LVMH's top executive, Virgil Abloh had sold a 60 percent majority stake in the brand to LVMH, retaining his own 40 percent and creative direction, with the licensing agreement remaining in the hands of Farfetch and New Guards Group. When the license expired, from the first day of 2026, Abloh could have taken Off-White's business elsewhere if he wanted. No one could have foreseen, however, the designer's untimely death, which left the brand orphaned (literally) and in the middle of no-man's-land as its ownership was divided. Now, apparently, LVMH wants to finalize its strategy and buy the license from Farfetch (supposedly before 2026) but there may be more to come.

$LVMH ""has the right to take back NGG's Off-White license in 2026. which generates +€300M sales. Some close to the company say $FTCH bought Reebok to compensate for the potential loss if NGG loses the OW license in early '26 should LVMH decide to get it back which is likely."" — Jamie Murray (@MWG_Jamie) October 24, 2023

According to the financial statements released last spring, Farfetch's business depends heavily on Off-White's 300 million in annual sales. No less, despite the brand being healthy and even ready to scale its business, this August Farfetch's shares plummeted 40 percent and the results published by the group had suggested little (or almost no) growth for a company that despite its stature had not yet become profitable on a solid and continuous basis, spreading fear among investors. According to Miss Tweed, it is precisely Farfetch's momentary weakness and its dependence on Off-White that would justify a takeover by LVMH, which would buy an impressive but vulnerable corporate network and a highly recognizable brand that it already de facto owns with all its licenses. The deal would expand LVMH's network, which, let us remember, not only owns the brands in its portfolio but through L Catterton has investments virtually everywhere in the industry. Certainly, joining LVMH would represent the acquisition of a new and more powerful platform for the brand and, probably, a rebirth of the brand from a media point of view as well as a strong expansion of its business."

TMZ Hip Hop obtained an open letter Tuesday, penned by PETA's Senior VP Lisa Lange and addressed to Pharrell, which reads ... ""Dear Pharrell, This is an invitation the likes of which you’ve never been offered before.""

The correspondence is filled with references to Pharrell-produced hits, yet there's nothing joking about it as Lange says ... ""When you were made men’s creative director of Louis Vuitton, we hoped animals would get lucky and that you would choose vegan fabrics, which are the preference of today’s ethical and environmentally conscious consumers. But we aren’t happy to note your newest design, the ""Millionaire"" Speedy bag, which is crafted from crocodile skin, because when it comes to animals being used for fashion, it isn’t beautiful—it’s abuse.""

Lange also accused the Neptunes' superproducer of sitting idle as the crocs get mutilated for their skin -- a complaint she also recently leveled at Offset for his birthday bag blowout for Cardi B.

The letter continued, ""A PETA Asia investigation found workers at LVMH’s suppliers cutting live crocodiles’ necks open and ramming metal rods down their spines while they were still conscious. Another investigation revealed that workers at facilities supplying LVMH struck pythons repeatedly on the head, suspending them in the air, inflating their bodies with water, and disemboweling them -- even as they moved about.""

Lange wants Pharrell to go to a crocodile factory farm, where she says bags like the Millionaire Speedy are made ... and she's warning it won't be a fun trip to the zoo.

In her words -- ""You’d want to bring along nose plugs and high boots to wade through fetid, waste-filled water. If we go to an indoor tank, also bring a flashlight, because you won’t see daylight. There are no blurred lines here. Killing wildlife for a bag isn’t cool—it’s cold. Are you up for this trip?"""

This is why it is meaningful that the epiphany that set the course of his professional career came to him precisely on a motor vehicle. “I studied mechanical engineering because I have always been passionate about car and airplane engines. My first passion was Formula 1. That is why I decided to study mechanical engineering in London,” he recalls. “I was lucky enough to spend a season at McLaren, and I used to take the train to go to Woking, to the team’s headquarters. During the journey, I started to read watchmaking blogs, to become interested in their mechanical details, in their design. And I got hooked.”

The youngest son of Bernard Arnault, the founder of French luxury giant LVMH, had discovered his calling, and he was in the right place to develop it. Since 2021, Jean Arnault has been the director of watches at Louis Vuitton, a business division that until a few years ago was a small part of the luxury brand, but which has just made a significant move to assert its presence. Last July, in a presentation at the Musée d’Orsay, the scene of many artistic revolutions — and, quite fittingly, against the backdrop of the museum’s enormous mechanical clock — Jean Arnault was delighted to present his first major project: a watch, yes, but also the sign of a fresh start. The new Tambour takes its name from its predecessors, called that way due to their drum-shaped case (“tambour” means “drum” in French), but it is completely new, and it is here to replace all the others. “It is the most important launch we have had in Louis Vuitton watchmaking since 2002,” says Arnault. “Because of the product, but also because of everything that surrounds it. Above all, the fact that we are withdrawing all the other collections is an important gesture for the brand. The underlying reflection is that, if we launch a watch at this price, with this quality and this attention to detail, we cannot have two or three different levels of quality in the same collection.”

The Tambour is Louis Vuitton’s most important launch since 2002. Laziz Hamano

In a sector defined by the obsession with the archival, where the main brands have several simultaneous lines, combining long-standing models and periodic updates for different audiences, Arnault’s bet for Vuitton watchmaking is a triple somersault: from now on, the previous Tambour models disappear to give way to a new generation of unisex mechanical models that preserve the essence of the collection, but raising the stakes, the prices and the internal coherence. “Unlike a plane or a car, a watch has no safety or regulatory restrictions, which allows us to be much more free and creative,” explains Arnault. “More than any other object, a watch works as a whole. That is to say, a good case with a good movement and a good bracelet. Everything at once. And I think we have achieved it.”

The campaign images show the watch in monochrome combinations that highlight that coherence: steel with a gray face, or yellow gold with a white face, like the one Leo Messi wore at the Ballon d’Or ceremony in October. The inaugural collection offers few variations because the fundamental goal is a high-precision design. Arnault draws attention to barely noticeable but essential details, such as the first five links of the bracelet. “There is a narrowing in them, so that they adapt better to the wrist,” he explains. “We had two options: to do it in a staggered way, with straight lines that gradually change angles, or with a sort of continuous curve. The net difference between both options is 0.1 millimeters, but 30% of the price. And we chose the curved option because it allowed for a more harmonious design. That is the level we are playing at.”

Arnault’s move is a gamble to reposition Louis Vuitton as a niche watchmaker. The prices confirm this (€19,500, or over $21,000 for the simplest model), but also the working methods. The Fabrique du Temps — the house’s watchmaking workshop, where these artisanal processes take place — is another rarity. “When I started to become interested in watchmaking I thought that all the brands worked the same way, with watchmakers making watches from start to finish. I soon realized that that was not the case; most companies work with assembly lines, like in the automobile industry. As soon as I arrived at Louis Vuitton, I saw that the production method and techniques were truly artisanal. In our workshops, the same watchmaker assembles each watch from start to finish. All that’s missing is their signature! It is something unique. We take craftsmanship to the limit, and that is not always economically efficient.”

When talking about his role models, Arnault mentions Roger Federer, his childhood idol. “It seems like a simple answer, but I have been passionate about tennis since I was a child. And I not only admire Federer for his successes, but also for his defeats. He has had moments of weakness, but the way he handles those defeats has always impressed me. He is a tennis player who always comes back, always goes for another Grand Slam.” His commitment to position Louis Vuitton at the pinnacle of watchmaking is also a statement of resilience that runs in the family. “My father has always told me the same thing: if the product is good, the results will come. Before joining Vuitton I didn’t have the vision to understand it, but now I get it. With the new Tambour we don’t expect impressive results right away, because it’s clearly a big move. But one day collectors, and our customers, will realize that these products are exceptional, that we have made no compromises, and they will begin to understand the philosophy behind them.”

Without this inflow of foreign currency Israel, which had a goods trade deficit of negative $34 billion in 2022, would not be able to financially sustain its illegal occupation and brutal subjugation of Palestinians.

Four luxury brands – Anglo American, LVMH, Signet Jewellers and Swatch – dominate the global diamond market. Anglo American owned De Beers Group claims to be the world’s largest diamond company, while LVMH owns the Tiffany, Bulgari, Chaumet, Fred and Repossi luxury brands. Signet is the world’s largest retailer of diamond jewellery. Swatch owns the iconic Harry Winston brand and is also a big buyer of special cut diamonds from Israel for its watches.

These companies all claim the diamonds they sell are responsibly sourced and conflict free even though many of them are sourced in Israel and generate revenue for a regime that stands accused of war crimes amounting to what some experts say is a “text-book case of genocide.”

The diamond industry in Israel has been described as a “cornerstone” of the economy. Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, said the economy generates 88 per cent of the vast security budget that funds the Israeli military. The diamond industry is estimated to generate $1billion annually of that budget. Some diamond companies in Israel also donate directly to the Israeli military and most, if not all, are likely to employ people who are now actively engaged in the assault on Gaza.

Diamonds that fund grave human rights violations are regarded as blood diamonds. Diamonds that fund the massacre in Gaza are genocide gems.

Luxury isn’t luxurious if it comes at a cost of bloodshed and violence and that is clearly the case when diamonds are sourced from companies in Israel which generate revenue that funds a genocidal apartheid regime.

There can be no “business as usual” with a state that flagrantly violates the norms of civilised governance and the internationally agreed humanitarian laws developed in the wake of the holocaust perpetrated against Jewish people during the Second World War.

The world balances on the brink of a catastrophic escalation in Middle East violence while live-streaming a genocide of the Palestinian people. CEOs and boards of corporations with Israeli supply chains have a responsibility to ensure they are not complicit in enabling the genocide to continue a day longer. In particular, leaders in the diamond industry need to immediately cut ties with the Israeli diamond industry and show that corporate social responsibility is not mere tokenism to fill the glossy pages of their next annual sustainability report.

For consumers and for shareholders it can’t be luxury at any price.

CEO of Fred Jewelry Brand Moves to Chaumet Top Job - JCK,"Mon, 27 Nov 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmpja29ubGluZS5jb20vZWRpdG9yaWFsLWFydGljbGUvY2VvLWZyZWQtamV3ZWxyeS1icmFuZC1jaGF1bWV0L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LVMH is making changes at the top at two of its jewelry brands, Fred and Chaumet.

Charles Leung (pictured), who has been CEO of Fred since 2018, will take over as CEO of Chaumet on Jan. 1, 2024. Leung had worked at Chaumet from 2006 to 2018, serving as managing director for the Asia-Pacific region and, later, vice president of international sales and distribution.

Leung will succeed Jean-Marc Mansvelt, who has headed Chaumet since 2014 and will move to LVMH-owned footwear brand Berluti. A new CEO for Fred has not been announced.

At Berluti, Mansvelt replaces Antoine Arnault, son of LVMH chairman Bernard Arnault. Antoine will remain Berluti’s chairman, as well as chair of LVMH-owned fashion house Loro Piana and head of LVMH’s image and environment department.

In a statement, Stéphane Bianchi, CEO of LVMH’s watch and jewelry division, hailed Leung and said that under his leadership, Fred “consolidated its unique positioning within LVMH jewelry brands and experienced a strong and healthy growth, opening new markets while developing a qualitative retail network.”

Bianchi also said that Mansvelt “took Chaumet to an unparalleled level and positioned the maison as a real ‘choice of distinction’ within the greatest jewelers of the Place Vendôme.”

"LVMH Succession Drama: Antoine Arnault Steps Down as CEO, Shaking Up Luxury Empire - CEOWORLD magazine","Sat, 25 Nov 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vY2Vvd29ybGQuYml6LzIwMjMvMTEvMjUvbHZtaC1zdWNjZXNzaW9uLWRyYW1hLWFudG9pbmUtYXJuYXVsdC1zdGVwcy1kb3duLWFzLWNlby1zaGFraW5nLXVwLWx1eHVyeS1lbXBpcmUv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"In a surprising twist in the world of luxury fashion and business, Antoine Arnault, son of Bernard Arnault, the chairman and CEO of LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, has stepped down from his role as CEO. This move marks a significant shift in the dynamics of the world’s largest luxury goods conglomerate and raises questions about the future leadership and strategic direction of the company.

Antoine Arnault’s resignation comes at a critical juncture for LVMH, known for its portfolio of over 70 prestigious brands including Louis Vuitton, Dior, and Fendi. He has been a key figure in the company, contributing to its expansive growth and global brand recognition. The reasons behind his departure have not been made public, but it has undoubtedly sent ripples through the industry, leading to speculation about potential conflicts within the Arnault family and the broader implications for LVMH’s future.

Bernard Arnault, who has been at the helm of LVMH for decades, is renowned for his visionary leadership and his ability to navigate the company through various market challenges. Under his guidance, LVMH has seen unparalleled growth, becoming a dominant force in the luxury market. However, the sudden departure of his son poses new challenges for the family-run empire, especially in terms of succession planning and maintaining the delicate balance between family interests and the company’s global ambitions.

This development is particularly noteworthy as family-led businesses often face unique challenges in succession planning. The departure of a key family member from a leadership role can lead to uncertainty both within the company and in the market. For LVMH, which has built a reputation on stability and steady growth, this could mean reassessing its future strategy and leadership structure.

Industry analysts are closely watching the situation, as the implications of this shift could extend beyond LVMH to the wider luxury market. LVMH has long been a trendsetter in the industry, and changes within its leadership could signal broader shifts in market strategies, branding approaches, and consumer engagement.

The luxury sector, which has been navigating a rapidly changing landscape with the rise of digital platforms, changing consumer preferences, and global economic uncertainties, will undoubtedly feel the impact of this high-profile leadership change. As Bernard Arnault and LVMH chart their course forward, the eyes of the world will be watching how this unfolds and what it means for the future of luxury fashion and business.

For now, LVMH has not announced a successor to Antoine Arnault, nor has it detailed how his departure will affect the company’s operational structure. The focus remains on how Bernard Arnault will steer the conglomerate through this unexpected turn of events and how LVMH will continue to innovate and lead in the luxury market. This story is developing, and further updates are expected as more information becomes available.

A few months after announcing its collaboration with denim manufacturer Kuroki, the French group intends to strengthen its positioning in the land of the rising sun.

On November 9, LVMH Métiers d’Art announced it was expanding its portfolio of partners by joining forces with historic silk fabric manufacturer Hosoo, supplier to luxury houses (Chanel, Dior) and grand hotels (Bulgari, Ritz).

Founded in 2015 with the aim of creating a “corps de métier unique in the world” as well as an “ecosystem around exceptional crafts and materials“, LVMH Métiers d’Art is a division of the luxury leader focused mainly on textiles, ready-to-wear, leather or exotic skins. It brings together seventeen specialized suppliers and generates sales of seven hundred million euros.

Last April, Kuroki, a Japanese denim specialist, also joined the Métiers d’Arts division, which at the beginning of the year opened an entity specially dedicated to Japanese know-how. LVMH, which has recorded a 7% increase in sales in the Japanese archipelago since the start of the year, is keen to strengthen its presence there.

By Mimosa Spencer

PARIS (Reuters) -Antoine Arnault, one of Bernard Arnault's five children, will step back from the day-to-day management of upmarket menswear label Berluti in January, LVMH said on Wednesday, fuelling speculation about his next role.

All the LVMH CEO's children hold important positions in the luxury goods group and are closely watched for any signs that one could become favourite to succeed the 74-year-old, who has not indicated he plans to step down.

Although Antoine, 46, has the highest profile, the others are stepping more into the public eye as they move up the LVMH ranks, including his older sister Delphine, who became CEO of the its second-biggest fashion label Dior in February.

Antoine is also in charge of image and environment at LVMH, and credited with negotiating a high-profile deal for the company to sponsor next summer's Paris Olympic Games. He will remain chairman of Berluti, which he has managed since 2012, as well as fashion brand Loro Piana.

""From its heritage as a shoe specialist, Berluti has come a long way to become a full-fledged Maison for men,"" said Toni Belloni, LVMH group managing director, citing ""remarkable"" revenue and profit growth at the label.

LVMH does not give financial figures for individual brands.

""Contrary to Loro Piana, which is booming, I believe Berluti has yet to find a winning formula,"" said Luca Solca, analyst with Bernstein.

Berluti will design the Olympics and Paralympics opening ceremony uniforms for the French teams, raising the profile of the brand known for its buffed leather shoes and tailored suits.

Jean-Marc Mansvelt, CEO of historic jewellery label Chaumet, will become CEO of Berluti, while Charles Leung, CEO of jewellery label Fred, will become CEO of Chaumet.

LVMH said it will seek a successor for Leung, who recently created a buzz by introducing high-end jewellery featuring lab-created diamonds.

During FY2022 the Top 100 luxury goods companies generated composite sales of US$347 billion, up from the US$305 billion registered in FY2021. This sharp increase in luxury goods sales signals the good state of the luxury industry after the pandemic years. The importance of the biggest luxury goods companies is clear: the 17 companies with luxury goods sales of more than US$5 billion contributed nearly 70% of the total Top 100 luxury goods sales. The 43 companies with sales of US$1 billion or less contributed only 6.4%. The minimum revenue threshold to enter the Top 100 was US$284 million.

The composite performance of the Top 100 companies in FY2022 reflects the continuing recovery from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, with stores open most of the year in most countries, travel and tourism returning, and consumer demand recovering especially in sectors such as makeup (see the separate box on the Impact of COVID-19 pandemic and company financial year end dates on FY2022 Top 100 ranking). For the 80 Top 100 companies reporting net profits in FY2022, the composite net profit margin was 1.2 percentage points higher than last year, at 13.4%, and higher than pre-pandemic levels.

Antoine Arnault to Relinquish CEO Role at Berluti - WWD,"Tue, 21 Nov 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3dkLmNvbS9mYXNoaW9uLW5ld3MvZGVzaWduZXItbHV4dXJ5L25ldy1iZXJsdXRpLWNlby1hbnRvaW5lLWFybmF1bHQtbWFuc3ZlbHQtMTIzNTkzODQyMi_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Antoine Arnault, having transformed Berluti from an elite cobbler into a full-fledged men’s fashion house, is moving into a nonexecutive role at the Paris firm.

He is passing the torch to Jean-Marc Mansvelt, who has been chief executive officer of Chaumet since 2014, and has a prior background in leather goods. Mansvelt is to take up the CEO role at Berluti effective Jan. 1, according to an internal announcement seen by WWD.

The move has triggered an executive shuffle mostly impacting the watches and jewelry division of LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton.

Charles Leung, CEO of Fred since 2018, is to succeed Mansvelt at Chaumet, also on Jan. 1, marking a return to the Paris house for the executive. Leung’s replacement at Fred has yet to be named.

“I am very happy and quite emotional to welcome Jean-Marc as the new CEO of the exceptional maison Berluti, building on values of elegance, audacity and unique savoir-faire,” Arnault said in the internal announcement. “Jean-Marc’s wealth of experience that he has demonstrated throughout these years will be decisive assets in driving the ongoing development of Berluti.”

Toni Belloni, group managing director of LVMH, noted that Mansvelt would be charged with building on Berluti’s positive dynamics. “Under the leadership of Antoine, it has emerged from the pandemic with a great positioning and remarkable revenue and profit growth,” Belloni said.

Jean-Marc Mansvelt Julien Falsimagne

The eldest son of LVMH chairman and CEO Bernard Arnault, Antoine Arnault is to remain chairman of Berluti.

He also maintains a string of other roles at the vast luxury group, including chairman of Loro Piana, head of communication, image and environment at LVMH, CEO of holding company Christian Dior SE, and member of the LVMH board.

It is understood Arnault may take on additional missions for the group in the coming months, but these could not immediately be learned.

To be sure, the affable, hands-on executive passes the torch at Berluti having quietly built a solid foundation for future growth.

Luxury analysts estimate revenues at Berluti have multiplied by about eight times since Arnault assumed the management helm in 2011, approaching 300 million euros this year, and with apparel accounting for about 20 percent of the business. It is understood the company is profitable, and now employs close to 1,100 people, up from roughly 200 in 2010.

Meanwhile, Stéphane Bianchi, CEO of LVMH’s watches and jewelry division, touted the promotion of two of his star executives.

He thanked Mansvelt for his “tremendous achievements at Chaumet” over a nine-year tenure. “His strong vision, his unique understanding of this amazing maison and his ability to create and drive successful teams have taken Chaumet to an unparalleled level,” he enthused.

Analysts estimate Chaumet revenues have reached around 450 million euros, having grown more than fourfold under Mansvelt’s tenure.

As for Fred, Bianchi said Leung “consolidated its unique positioning within LVMH jewelry brands, and experienced a strong and healthy growth, opening new markets while developing a qualitative retail network.”

It marks a return to Chaumet for Leung, who had joined the Place Vendôme jeweler in 2006 to develop and grow its business in the Asia Pacific region.

“I am convinced that with his strong drive and business acumen, his understanding of the jewelry industry and of the different markets, he will take Chaumet to greater heights,” Bianchi said of Leung.

Charles Leung Rüdy Waks

To be sure, Antoine Arnault wrote a key chapter in the modernization of a legendary European name in footwear.

Founded in Paris in 1895 by a transplanted Italian, Berluti is best known for shoes in unusual colors and patinas, attracting such celebrity clients as Andy Warhol, Pierre Bergé, Jean Cocteau, Alain Delon, Dean Martin and Yves Saint Laurent.

Back in the day, Berluti hosted polishing parties, which involved a touch of Champagne at the end to achieve a high sheen. Antoine Arnault reprised the ritual in 2015 as the brand marked its 120th anniversary.

Berluti’s most famous style, dubbed the Alessandro after the founding cobbler, is a court shoe fashioned from a single piece of leather without any seams.

At LVMH’s annual shareholders meeting earlier this year, Bernard Arnault called out Berluti’s “shining” performance among its smaller brands, urging members of the audience to test drive its shoes.

“You’ll see they are really amazing,” he said, recalling a visit to a Berluti boutique shortly before LVMH acquired the house in 1993. Olga Berluti, then the maison’s chief bootmaker, greeted the luxury titan, inviting him to sit down and remove his shoes.

According to Arnault, she simply looked at his feet without measuring, dove into the stockroom and returned with “precisely the right shoe. I thought that was extraordinary, so I bought the business.”

Antoine Arnault has had an eventful career at Berluti, charged with leading one of the group’s underdeveloped jewels, which at the time of the handover generated an estimated 80 percent of its revenues from footwear. (It had added leather goods in 2005.)

One of CEO’s first big moves came in 2012, when he acquired French heritage brand Arnys to apply its made-to-measure expertise — and prime retail site on the Left Bank of Paris — in support of Berluti’s expansion drive.

Berluti staged its first runway show in January 2012, the ready-to-wear collection designed by its first artistic director Alessandro Sartori, who also created loafers and sneakers that would become iconic shoes for the brand as it embraced more casual styles alongside Arnys’ legacy of fine tailoring.

After Sartori returned to design for Ermenegildo Zegna, where he earned his reputation, Haider Ackermann took up the reins for a few seasons, bringing his signature nonchalance and a nomadic spirit.

Designer Kris Van Assche, who helmed the creative studio at Dior Homme for 11 years, stepped into Berluti in 2018, bringing meticulous tailoring, zesty color and runway razzmatazz.

At the request of Arnault, the Belgian designer developed a sneaker dubbed the Shadow that has since become of its biggest hits, on track to sell about 20,000 pairs this year, according to market sources.

Berluti wound up its collaboration with Van Assche in April 2021, and now relies on its studio to realize collections in tune with its template of contemporary luxury and timeless style. Key product launches have included the Play-Off sneaker, a logo canvas dubbed La Toile Marbeuf, furniture and leather home objects.

When Arnault arrived in 2011, Berluti’s business was concentrated in Western Europe, China and Japan. During his tenure, he overhauled and expanded the retail network almost threefold to 67 boutiques, gaining Berluti a foothold in important cities worldwide for luxury goods, and also in promising emerging markets like Southeast Asia.

Another key event in the life of the brand was the 2015 opening of a new production site for shoes and leather goods in Ferrare, Italy, designed by Barthelemy & Grino Architects.

Arnault is a graduate of HEC in Montréal and also has an MBA from INSEAD. He started his career with internet start-up domainoo.com.

He joined the family business in 2002, working in Louis Vuitton’s marketing department and overseeing stores in the French provinces. He became a member of LVMH’s board in 2006 and was named Vuitton’s communications director in 2007.

His appointment at Christian Dior SE last December came in tandem with the conversion of Financière Agache, Bernard Arnault’s main holding company, into a limited joint-stock partnership, further locking in family control over the LVMH luxury empire, as reported.

Dior SE is a listed company that is highly symbolic for the family, as Christian Dior was one of the linchpin acquisitions by Bernard Arnault that initiated the construction of the world’s biggest luxury company.

Antoine Arnault is leaving Berluti a fine parting gift: On Thursday, he confirmed the brand would dress French teams for the opening ceremonies of the Paris 2024 Olympic and Paralympic Games next summer. He had also spearheaded LVMH signing on as a premium partner of the global sporting event.

In a note sent to Berluti employees, also seen by WWD, Arnault thanked his collaborators for their commitment. “With you, we invented the Berluti wardrobe, we developed bold, innovative, but always elegant collections,” he wrote. “I will always keep a watchful and passionate eye on Berluti.”

Before joining Chaumet, Mansvelt was leather goods and accessories director at Louis Vuitton. A graduate of the HEC business school, Mansvelt started his career at L’Oréal in 1988, working in marketing and product development. He joined Vuitton in 2004.

Leung boasts degrees from both the Chinese University of Hong Kong and French business school ESSEC in Paris. He started his fine jewelry career at Cartier in marketing and retail before joining Chaumet in 2006."

Following reports that Pharrell Williams’ collection for Louis Vuitton includes a $1 million made-to-order crocodile-skin bag, PETA sent the singer a letter inviting him to join us on a less-than-luxurious tour of the filthy concrete pits crocodiles are packed into. When several animals are housed together, it’s likely that aggression and injuries will result, and these commonly lead to infection and disease—conditions that a PETA Asia investigation revealed exist at farms that supply skins to LVMH, Louis Vuitton’s parent company.

PETA let Pharrell know what he’ll need to bring along for the trip, including nose plugs and high boots to wade through fetid, waste-filled water.

There are no blurred lines here. Killing wildlife for a bag isn’t cool—it’s cold. Pharrell should follow the example of compassionate celebrities like singer Billie Eilish, who recently teamed up with Gucci to create the Horsebit 1955 Bag, made with high-end vegan leather that’s better for animals and the planet.

Another PETA Asia investigation revealed that workers at facilities supplying LVMH struck pythons repeatedly on the head, suspended them in the air, inflated their bodies with water, and disemboweled them—even as they still moved about.

Dozens of major designers and retailers, including Calvin Klein, Chanel, Nordstrom, and Selfridges, have removed exotic skins from their products.

PETA will continue to put pressure on LVMH executives until they get the memo that animals are not ours to exploit for handbags, clothing, or anything else. You can join our call:"

The group’s eyewear producer has signed an agreement to buy US eyewear brand Barton Perreira, whose glasses are popular with film and music stars. The AFP agency learnt about the deal from Thélios, confirming a report by the Wall Street Journal (WSJ).

Thélios told AFP that the agreement had been signed, and that the acquisition will be finalised in the next few weeks. Alessandro Zanardo, CEO of Thélios, told WSJ that the Barton Perreira brand “is well-known and well-established in the USA.” He added that Thélios thinks Barton Perreira has “huge scope for expansion.”



Citing anonymous sources, WSJ said that the operation will value the US eyewear brand, founded in 2007, at approximately $80 million (just shy of approximately €75 million). However, speaking to AFP, Thélios did not wish to comment on this aspect, or on the acquisition's financial details.

In early September, Thélios bought French eyewear brand from British investment fund Investment Partners. It was the company's first acquisition, and the value of the transaction was not disclosed.



Thélios was originally a joint-venture company between LVMH and Italian producer Marcolin, before the luxury group took full control at the end of 2021.

This acquisition strengthens Belmond’s presence in Italy, a country with a dozen hotels under the Belmond brand.

Soon there’ll be another reason besides a return to the footsteps of James Bond and Star Wars Episode 2 to visit the undulating shores of Lombardy, where Villa Balbianello served as a filming location for both film franchises.

The sapphire-green waters of Lake Como, north of Milan, are coming out of their torpor with the Belmond Group’s acquisition of the villa Castello di Urio, featuring a landscaped park of almost two hectares with private shoreline.

The deal is due to be finalized in 2024, according to the newspaper Milano Finanza.

In a note, Belmond, the hotel arm of the LVMH group, stated that it had reached an agreement to acquire the Castello di Urio, a property located in Carate Urio, confirming the information originally revealed by local newspaper La Provincia di Como.

However, the hotel group has not revealed the details of the transaction or the function it will perform.

But all indications are that it will be a new hotel under the Belmond brand. Given the proportions of the majestic building, it could also be a future foundation or even a museum, further strengthening the group’s link with the preservation of cultural heritage.

A lakeside residence with a view

The iconic lakeside establishments of Grand Tremezzo and Passalacqua on what is Italy’s third largest lake – with a surface area of 146 km² – will now have LVMH, or rather Belmond, as their illustrious “neighbor”.

The Castello di Urio site sought by Belmond is home to a 16th-century residence, fortified in the 19th century.

The exceptional waterfront location, with 180 meters of private shoreline, features a 1.9-hectare landscaped park with antique-inspired statues and fountains in Carate Urio, 59 km (37 miles) from Milan.

Madhappy Unveils First Permanent Store in West Hollywood - WWD,"Mon, 27 Nov 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vd3dkLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy1uZXdzL3JldGFpbC9tYWRoYXBweS1sdm1oLWJhY2tlZC1vcGVucy1maXJzdC1wZXJtYW5lbnQtc3RvcmUtd2VzdC1ob2xseXdvb2QtcGVpbWFuLXJhZi0xMjM1OTU4NDM3L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"After crisscrossing the U.S. over the last six years with more than 20 pop-up outposts in major cities, Madhappy, a Los Angeles clothing brand embracing mental health and well-being, has unveiled its first permanent store on tony Melrose Avenue in West Hollywood.

At 2,800 square feet, this is more than just a store. It’s a gathering space to hang out, drink coffee, chat with friends and reflect inside the “Local Optimist Space,” an area for relaxation and contemplation while viewing a rotation of artistic collaborators designing audiovisual experiences for people. For the brand’s first collaboration, it is working with Canadian electronic artist Dylan Khotin-Foote, known for his ambient pieces.

Peiman Raf, one of the brand’s four cofounders and the company’s chief executive officer, said Madhappy has wanted to open a flagship in its hometown for years, but the COVID-19 pandemic slowed things down. And the brand didn’t want to be just anywhere. “It was a pretty tall task to find something because we wanted to do something a little bit different,” he explained. “We also wanted to be in an area that felt connected to the brand already.”

A while back, Madhappy had a short-term space on Melrose Avenue and knew it was a good, busy retail zone. “We initially found a space, but we honestly didn’t love it, but there was nothing else available,” Raf said.

Then a gelato store closed its doors at 8906 Melrose Avenue, next door to Madhappy’s recent pop-up venue. It was a perfect fit along the highly trafficked restaurant and retail row near Palace Skateboards, Craig’s, Ganni, Acne Studios and Maxfield.

It has taken almost a year to get the outpost designed and all the building permits and inspections approved. Madhappy worked with creative studio PlayLab Inc. whose offices are across the street from Madhappy’s headquarters in L.A.’s Arts District. The studio was tasked with creating a conversation pit for visitors to hang out, the “Local Optimist Space,” as well as a large open-air courtyard.

In addition, there is a café concept called Pantry by Madhappy with offerings from local and global culinary partners including Courage Bagels, Gjusta Bakery, Beverly Hills Juice, and pantry goods from Jon & Vinny’s eatery.

The location will stock Madhappy’s assortment of T-shirts, sweatshirts, sweatpants, sweaters, jackets, puffer vests, scarves, baseball caps and socks, with prices ranging from $36 to $325. About 80 to 85 percent of the merchandise is manufactured in Los Angeles. Also available will be the second Ugg x Madhappy footwear collection.

Madhappy has been on an upward swing since it was founded in 2017 by four friends: Raf, his brother Noah Raf, Mason Spector and Joshua Sitt. They decided to build a brand centered around positivity and encourage optimism through connection. It was counter to many streetwear brands that took on a dark, sometimes nihilistic vibe.

In 2019, LVMH Moët Hennessey Louis Vuitton invested $1.8 million in the venture, which helped fund many things, including more than 20 pop-up stores across the country for a customer whose average age is between 18 and 35. With its first permanent store now up and running, Madhappy plans to expand to Japan next year after having a shop within a shop recently inside the Dover Street Market store in Tokyo."
Urio Castle: LVMH to buy a building on Lake Como - nss magazine,"Wed, 15 Nov 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5zc21hZy5jb20vZW4vbGlmZXN0eWxlLzM0ODc1L2x2bWgtbGFrZS1jb21vLWNhc3RsZdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LVMH invests in the Paris Olympics, allocates a plan to lock up shares for the next 29 years, and buys the Castello di Urio on Lake Como. The portfolio of the world's largest luxury conglomerate thus continues to grow with the addition of this luxurious 16th century Italian property, a building that, given LVMH's activities in the hospitality sector, could become a hotel space. The final contract signature for the acquisition will be laid in 2024 and the deal has been closed through the subsidiary Belmond, MFF reported. Among the properties on the Italian peninsula already owned by the group are the Cipriani in Venice, the Splendido hotel in Portofino, the Grand Hotel Timeo and Villa Sant'Andrea in Taormina, Villa San Michele in Florence and many others.

The Castle of Carate Urio was erected between Moltrasio and Carate in the 16th century and was a residence of several noble families, such as the Salazars, the Castelbarcos and the Melzi d'Eril. In 1947 it passed to Baron Langheim, who invested in the renovation of the building and the park.Due to its strategic location near the peaceful Lake Como, the castle has been used for spiritual and religious retreats in recent times. The property comprises 1.9 hectares of land, and is part of the real estate of Opus Dei."
Berluti to Design Team France Uniforms for Olympics Opening Ceremony - The Business of Fashion,"Thu, 16 Nov 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzb2ZmYXNoaW9uLmNvbS9uZXdzL2x1eHVyeS9vbHltcGljcy1wYXJpcy0yMDI0LWJlcmx1dGktbHZtaC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LVMH-owned Berluti announced it will design Team France’s uniforms for the opening ceremony of the 2024 Olympic and Paralympic Games in Paris, the brand announced Thursday.

In July LVMH announced a landmark “premium partnership” with the Olympics that will also see brands including Louis Vuitton and Dior design uniforms for Team France, while high jewellery label Chaumet will produce the tournament’s winners’ medals.

LVMH has also announced sponsorship of three French athletes set to star at the Olympics: world champion swimmer Léon Marchand, European champion in artistic gymnastics Mélanie de Jesus dos Santos, and Olympic gold-medalist fencer Enzo Lefort.

The luxury group has increasingly looked to benefit from associations with elite sports teams, competitions and athletes. On the opening night of the NBA season in October, Louis Vuitton dressed LeBron James of the LA Lakers — who also featured in a billboard campaign for the brand — in the “Damoflage” jacket and “Speedy” bag from Pharrell Williams’ debut collection.

The brand also partnered with the Balon d’Or ceremony — the prestigious annual awards ceremony which honours the world’s best male and female footballers of the year — designing a bespoke monogram trunk to house the trophy won by Lionel Messi in late October.

Also in October, Louis Vuitton announced its return as title sponsor and partner of the 2024 Americas Cup, sailing’s elite competition.

Meanwhile, Berluti’s ongoing partnership as the “elegance partner” of the Alpine F1 team will be on display this weekend at the blockbuster Las Vegas Grand Prix.

LVMH catches the eye with high-end lab-created diamonds - Gulf Business,"Sat, 04 Nov 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vZ3VsZmJ1c2luZXNzLmNvbS9sdm1oLWNhdGNoZXMtdGhlLWV5ZS1oaWdoLWVuZC1sYWItZ3Jvd24tZGlhbW9uZHMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Image credit: LVMH

LVMH, owner of diamond jeweller Tiffany & Co, has begun showing clients watches and jewellery featuring lab-created diamonds, testing luxury buyers interest in using man-made stones at the very top end of the market.

In private appointments with clients at its Paris flagship on Rue de la Paix in recent weeks, LVMH’s Fred label has been showing a new high-end jewellery set built around lab-created diamonds in an unusual blue hue – meant to evoke the sea and reflect founder’s nautical roots – surrounding them with natural, white diamonds.

One of the pieces, a EUR240,000 ($255,000) necklace, features the blue created diamond in half a carat, a colour that took years of research to develop, according to the label.

On Tuesday, when asked if LVMH could broaden its use of lab-created stones at Tiffany, finance chief Jean-Jacques Guiony said, “Is it a long-term trend that we could develop elsewhere? It’s too early to say,” noting that the group’s bets on man-made stones must be “weighed and assessed carefully”.

Lab-grown versus mined diamonds

Within the sprawling luxury empire, Tag Heuer CEO Frederic Arnault, one of five LVMH heirs, made the first moves to use lab-created diamonds, incorporating them in some of the brand’s priciest watches, including a $90,000 timepiece with a 1.3-carat pink created diamond as the crown, unveiled earlier this year.

The use of man-made diamonds in luxury products comes as LVMH remains focused on marketing natural diamonds, particularly at Tiffany, where efforts are led by Frederic Arnault’s older brother, Alexandre Arnault, head of product and marketing.

The label, which is pushing into China, emphasises the provenance of the American jeweller’s diamonds which are sourced from countries such as Australia, Botswana, Namibia, South Africa and Canada.

Lab-created diamonds have become more accepted in the United States, where cheaper brands like Pandora and Signet have been increasing their offers of man-made stones."
"Luxury slump hits high-end Rolex, Patek Philippe watches - Fortune","Tue, 14 Nov 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vZm9ydHVuZS5jb20vZXVyb3BlLzIwMjMvMTEvMTQvaGlnaC1lbmQtcm9sZXgtcGF0ZWstcGhpbGlwcGUtd2F0Y2hlcy0yLXllYXItbG93LWx1eHVyeS1zbHVtcC1sdm1oLWd1Y2NpL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The strong pandemic-era demand for high-end goods is starting to wane. It began to reflect in the sales of big brands like LVMH and Gucci, as they experienced a slowdown in their previous quarter. Now, the slump is spreading into the world of luxury timepieces, too.

The prices of Rolex and Patek Philippe watches slid to new two-year lows in October as demand in the secondary market declined. The Bloomberg Subdial Index, which looks at the pricing for the 50 most traded watches by value, fell 1.8% last month—to its lowest since 2021. In the last 24 months, the prices have dropped about 18%, according to the index.

“We are seeing growing downward pressure in the market, which could lead to a further downward drift in prices as dealers cut valuations to chase sales,” said Christy Davis, the co-founder of London-based Subdial, a watch trading platform that tracks their prices, according to Bloomberg. As a result, the average number of days to sell pre-owned watches has shot up by 8% since August, the watch group said.

The luxury lull

This follows as some of the world’s largest luxury conglomerates have also noted a correction in demand compared to the COVID-19-fueled boost in consumer spending. LVMH, which owns brands like Louis Vuitton and Christian Dior, saw its sales grow at a softer pace of 9% in the third quarter compared to the previous quarter—at 17%.

As a bellwether of the luxury industry, LVMH’s lackluster earnings set the tone for some of its competitors, including Gucci owner Kering. That company’s chief, François-Henri Pinault, said macroeconomic volatility and slower demand were among the factors impacting the company’s 9% drop in third-quarter revenues.

The extent of the slowdown was further amplified as sales of Richemont, the owner of luxury jewelry and watch brand Cartier, missed analyst expectations.

“The period under review started strongly, beyond our expectations. However, growth eased in the second quarter as inflationary pressure, slowing economic growth and geopolitical tensions began to affect customer sentiment,” Richemont’s chairman Johann Rupert said in a statement last week.

From boom to bust of the secondary watch market

The plunging price tags in secondhand luxury watches marks a sharp reversal of the pandemic heyday, when the likes of Rolex and Audemars Piguet saw demand outstripping supply. Appetite for the pre-owned versions of the watches sent their prices soaring through early 2022, led by sales to millennials and Gen-Z customers who were comfortable buying pre-owned items online.

At the time, people confined to their homes and flush with savings turned to luxury spending, helping high-end watch, bag and apparel-makers in the process. Platforms like Subdial, Chrono24 and Watchfinder made access to the watch market easier, while the hype around pre-owned watches helped prop up demand—sometimes even more than their firsthand counterparts. In a Deloitte report from October 2022, the consulting firm forecasted that the pre-owned luxury watch segment would soar 75% by 2030.

But a downturn in the stock markets and cryptocurrencies, coupled with economic pressures such as high interest rates, began to hurt the watch market a year ago. Since a high in the secondary watch market last April, prices have dipped by a whopping 42%, Bloomberg reported. During the same period, Rolex and Patek prices have fallen 27% and 47%, respectively.

Despite the trend in pricing over the last year, luxury watches have proven to be a time-tested store of value. Second-hand watches were “in demand as alternate investments,” a Boston Consulting Group report in March noted, and part of the reason for that it because their value is generally expected to rise over time.

“Although prices declined during 2022, echoing declining stock market and cryptocurrency exchanges, watches have performed well relative to stocks,” the report said. “Luxury watch prices also outperformed the S&P during the 2007–2009 recession and took less than two years to recover from the 2008 market crash, while many traditional financial categories and consumer products categories took longer.”

So, while it may be looking like a slump for now in the world of pre-owned watches, it could only be a matter of time before things look up again."

This acquisition underlines the group's desire to expand its presence in the Italian luxury hotel market.

The historic residence boasts 180 metres of shoreline and a vast 1.9 hectare estate. Originally, it was a private noble residence surrounded by Italian gardens. The castle has seen centuries of history and aristocratic ownership. The transaction, estimated at between €50 and €100 million, includes the purchase and complete renovation of the property. The transaction is expected to be completed by 2024, marking a significant new addition to LVMH's growing collection of luxury hotels. With the successful acquisition of Belmond in 2018 for over $3 billion, LVMH has strengthened its position in the luxury hotel sector. Belmond, founded in 1976, now has a portfolio of around 50 properties worldwide, including nine luxury hotels in Italy such as the Cipriani in Venice, the Splendido in Portofino and the Simplon-Orient Express train in Venice. LVMH's decision is in line with its strategic vision for Belmond and reflects the current trend for global luxury hotel groups to invest in prime Italian destinations. The competitive landscape in Italy's luxury hotel sector remains robust, with significant international interest and substantial investment seen throughout 2023.

Dior follows Louis Vuitton with Hong Kong show - Vogue Business,"Mon, 27 Nov 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZvZ3VlYnVzaW5lc3MuY29tL3N0b3J5L2Zhc2hpb24vZGlvci1mb2xsb3dzLWxvdWlzLXZ1aXR0b24td2l0aC1ob25nLWtvbmctc2hvd9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"To receive the Vogue Business newsletter, sign up here.

LVMH is all in on Hong Kong. Dior announced today that it will show its men’s pre-fall collection in the city in the first quarter of next year, following in the footsteps of its LVMH stablemate Louis Vuitton later this week. Details of the Dior show date and location are yet to be announced.

It is another clear signal that Hong Kong is back in the sights of Western luxury brands after a challenging period. Protests over Beijing’s influence in Hong Kong, strict Covid lockdowns and economic uncertainty have dogged the city in recent years. However, China’s decision to fully reopen its border with Hong Kong on 6 February after nearly three years of closure was met with an influx of people from the mainland, revitalising the market.

Read More Pharrell is heading to Hong Kong. Will others follow? The creative director’s pre-fall 2024 collection for Louis Vuitton will be shown in Hong Kong. It’s a sign of the city’s resurgence as an important destination for global luxury brands — but with stiff competition from the rest of China, can it come out on top?

Though tourist levels are still below that of 2019, retail sales in the city have been growing by double digits monthly since February, and HSBC predicts that the 20 per cent growth in luxury sales in the APAC region (excluding mainland China) will be driven by Hong Kong, alongside Macau, South Korea and Japan. Competition is stiff — many shoppers prefer cities on the mainland like Beijing, Shanghai or, increasingly, Shenzhen, while Hainan is expected to continue growing in influence. However, Hong Kong is working on restoring its image through promotional campaigns and cultural events, as well as investment in its infrastructure.

After staging a blockbuster debut for Louis Vuitton in Paris in June, Pharrell Williams is heading to Hong Kong on 30 November to showcase his pre-fall 2024 collection for the house. The show will take place on the Avenue of Stars, known for its celebrity handprints and bordering the Tsim Sha Tsui waterfront, framed by Victoria Harbour.

Dior’s show will be its first in Hong Kong since 2016 when it held a menswear show; the brand has 11 stores across the city.

Giorgio Armani fashions his own legacy with succession plan - Marketscreener.com,"Wed, 15 Nov 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hcmtldHNjcmVlbmVyLmNvbS9xdW90ZS9zdG9jay9MVk1ILTQ2NjkvbmV3cy9HaW9yZ2lvLUFybWFuaS1mYXNoaW9ucy1oaXMtb3duLWxlZ2FjeS13aXRoLXN1Y2Nlc3Npb24tcGxhbi00NTM1NTkzNS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"* Giorgio Armani sets out plans for business succession

* Armani, 89, remains in driving seat of business he built

* Ownership set to be split among close group, foundation

* Stock listing may not happen for at least five years

MILAN, Nov 15 (Reuters) - Giorgio Armani has always kept a tight grip on the firm he founded, and the Italian fashion king's attention to detail extends to clear rules on how it should be run after his death.

Armani, 89, remains CEO and effectively sole shareholder of the business he set up with his late partner in the 1970s, which had a 2.35 billion euros ($2.5 billion) turnover last year.

With no children to pass it on to, there has been speculation about the long-term future of Armani's empire and whether, in an industry dominated by luxury conglomerates, it will be able to maintain the independence he treasures.

But a hitherto obscure document from 2016, held by a notary in Milan and reviewed by Reuters, sets out the future governing principles for those who inherit the group, while another details issues including protecting jobs at the firm.

The first document explains how his heirs should approach a potential stock market listing - though not until five years after his passing - and any potential M&A activity.

For the Armani look itself, the document commits them to the ""search for an essential, modern, elegant and unostentatious style with attention to detail and visibility"".

The document is the product of an extraordinary meeting that Armani called in 2016 to adopt new bylaws for the group which would come into force upon his death.

SUCCESSION PLAN

Armani's heirs are expected to include his sister, three other family members working in the business, long-term collaborator Pantaleo Dell'Orco and a charitable foundation.

The bylaws divide the company's share capital into six categories with different voting rights and powers, and were amended in September to create some without voting rights.

The Armani group, which as well as the CEO also represents the family members mentioned in the document, declined to comment on the document or its contents.

It is not clear from the document how the different blocs of shares will be distributed, but corporate governance experts say the guidelines should ensure a relatively smooth transition by giving the board a central role.

""It is an organization that reduces the margins for disagreement between the heirs,"" Guido Corbetta, professor of Corporate Strategy at Milan's Bocconi University, told Reuters.

Armani has a younger sister, Rosanna, two nieces, Silvana and Roberta, as well as a nephew, Andrea Camerana. Dell'Orco is also considered part of the family.

All are currently board members and, apart from Rosanna, all work for the Armani group.

Silvana and Dell'Orco are heads of design, working closely for decades with Armani, who dubbed them his ""lieutenants of style"".

The 2016 bylaws set the process for how the board will appoint future women's and men's style directors in a company known for its classic tailoring.

Roberta is Head of Entertainment & VIP Relations, while Camerana is sustainability managing director.

Other fashion groups including LVMH, Europe's most valuable luxury company, also have succession issues, with the five children of LVMH CEO and Chairman Bernard Arnault all having key management roles at brands in the empire.

LASTING LEGACY

Armani also created a foundation in 2016 which currently has a tiny symbolic stake but is earmarked to play a pivotal role in protecting the business he set up with Sergio Galeotti before going it alone when his partner died in 1985.

Its purpose is to reinvest capital for charitable causes and to maintain Armani's lasting influence over the group.

The foundation's bylaws, which were also seen by Reuters, call for it to manage the shareholding with the aim of creating value, maintaining employment levels and the pursuit of company values. The Armani group has almost 9,000 employees.

The arrangement has echoes of one adopted by Rolex founder Hans Wilsdorf who left the brand to a foundation in 1960 that still owns the luxury watchmaker.

Armani has always defended his firm's independence and ruled out a merger, especially with the French groups that swallowed up Italian brands such as Gucci, now owned by Kering.

The group bylaws include a ""cautious approach to acquisitions aimed solely at developing skills that do not exist internally from a market, product or channel point of view"".

They also provides for the distribution of 50% of net profits to shareholders.

Any eventual stock market listing requires the favourable vote of the majority of directors ""after the fifth year following the entry into force of this statute"".

The Armani group declined to comment on a potential listing in the mid-term.

""The founding principles show Armani's desire to transmit and prolong his idea of a company, of business, there is a desire for eternity,"" Bocconi professor Corbetta said.

Despite his meticulous planning, whether Armani's aims outlast him will ultimately be beyond his control.

""They (the rules) could restrict the company a little and become incompatible with drastic changes in the market,"" Corbetta said. ($1 = 0.9376 euros) (Reporting by Elisa Anzolin; Editing by Keith Weir and Alexander Smith)"

LVMH brands such as Louis Vuitton, Dior and Berluti will provide uniforms for select teams, while the medals will be the work of its high jewellery label, Chaumet. For the first time ever, the games will feature LVMH-sponsored athletes, including world-champion swimmer Léon Marchand, European champion in artistic gymnastics Mélanie de Jesus dos Santos and Olympic gold-medalist fencer Ezno Lefort.

The “premium” partnership between LVMH and the Olympics marks the biggest indication to date of sport’s newfound importance to fashion. Until recently, sport was one of the remaining cultural arenas in which fashion, with a few exceptions, had failed to forge long-lasting and meaningful relationships. That has changed.

Fashion brands are waking up to the commercial value of sports like basketball, football, tennis and Formula 1 as they look to be part of the booming sports-sponsorship market, which is projected to grow from $63.1 billion in 2021 to $109.1 billion by 2030, according to PwC.

“Sport is now the only by-appointment thing to watch on TV or tune into live at that point in time — everything else is on demand,” said Clive Reeves, PwC’s UK sports leader. “To be in the conversation, you need to watch sport at that point in time, which makes it the only thing left in society that really drives a huge volume of people at specific moments, which for brands is very special and valuable.”

A New Playing Field

The scope for fashion’s ability to tap into sports has been blown wide open. Beyond competing with large corporations for traditional sponsorship on jerseys or around stadiums, brands can target niche areas where they may have a more natural impact. For example, they can partner with athletes on clothing lines, dress them for the “tunnel walk” that occurs as they enter an arena — images of which are instantly shared online by dedicated social media accounts — or even create clothing for their avatars in video games.

“There is still so much untapped potential and uncharted territory for brands to explore across so many different sports,” said Kenny Annan-Jonathan, a sports marketing veteran and founder of London-based agency The Mailroom, who was appointed creative director of the Premier League’s Crystal Palace Football Club in August 2023. “We’re only at the outset of seeing where the world of sports can take fashion brands.”

While sportswear companies like Nike, Adidas and Puma have long since aligned their brands with fashion, this case study unpacks opportunities for non-sportswear brands and retailers. The companies profiled — German luxury brand Boss, Swiss watchmaker Tag Heuer and UK-based sneaker marketplace start-up The Edit Ldn — each have placed sports marketing at the heart of their growth strategies and brand identities, either to deepen connections with existing consumers or as a means to effectively and authentically target new audiences.

As part of the partnership with LVMH-owned Sephora, Reliance Retail will take over the operations of Sephora’s 26 stores from Arvind Fashions Limited, and begin work to expand Sephora’s presence in the country.

Sephora originally entered India in 2012. By partnering with Reliance, which launched beauty platform Tira in April, both brands are better positioned to take on Nykaa, a leader in the Indian beauty market. Meanwhile, Sephora’s well-known global lines like Charlotte Tilbury and Fenty Beauty get a boost.

Describing the Indian consumer journey as being at a “tipping point”, V Subramaniam, director at RRVL, said in a press release, “The burgeoning Indian beauty market is being propelled by a new generation of customers with a strong desire to express their individuality, rising aesthetic refinement and a growing number of women in the young workforce of India.”

The Indian beauty and personal care market is valued at $17 billion, and is considered to still be in its infancy. Many position India as one of the largest untapped consumer markets globally.
