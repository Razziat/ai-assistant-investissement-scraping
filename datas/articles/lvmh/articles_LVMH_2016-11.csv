Italy fines LVMH boss over Bulgari deal - Yahoo Finance Australia,"Wed, 02 Nov 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vYXUuZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9pdGFseS1maW5lcy1sdm1oLWJvc3Mtb3Zlci0wOTAwNTEzOTEuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Italy's stock exchange watchdog has fined Antonio Belloni, managing director of French luxury group LVMH, 350,000 euros ($389,000) for divulging confidential information about an upcoming acquisition, it announced Wednesday.

The fine relates to the 2011 announcement by Italian jewellery firm Bulgari that it had been taken over by LVMH, offering 60 percent more than the company's share value at the time.

Before the announcement was made, Belloni told Alessandro Sonvico of Swiss fund management firm Pentagram ""privileged information"" about the forthcoming Bulgari deal, said the Consob watchdog.

He has been barred from holding office in a listed company for eight months, although LVMH said that after checking with their French and Italian lawyers, his position as managing director would not be affected.

Consob imposed the same penalties on Sonvico, although a part of his 350,000 euro fine will be paid by Pentagram.

LVMH said that Belloni, who denies the charges, had immediately appealed the ruling.

The company said it was ""calm"" about what the final outcome of the case would be, and reaffirmed its confidence in a ""managing director who has shown constant loyalty and honesty in his work since joining the group in 2001"".

""Mr Belloni is disappointed by this decision, which he thinks is unjust,"" his lawyers said in a statement, adding that their client was approaching the case ""with the calm of someone who has done nothing wrong""."
Louis Vuitton owner LVMH reportedly in talks to buy Rapha - road.cc,"Sun, 27 Nov 2016 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vcm9hZC5jYy9jb250ZW50L25ld3MvMjEyNzU4LWxvdWlzLXZ1aXR0b24tb3duZXItbHZtaC1yZXBvcnRlZGx5LXRhbGtzLWJ1eS1yYXBoYdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Luxury goods powerhouse LVMH, which was recently linked with Italian bike manufacturer Pinarello, is reportedly in talks to buy upmarket British cycling clothing brand, Rapha, according to the Mail on Sunday.

The London-based business, which has supplied Team Sky for the past three seasons but will no longer do so in 2017, was founded in 2004 by Simon Mottram, whose background is in brand consultancy.

Helped by the boom in road cycling over the past decade or so in the UK and elsewhere – the US, Australia and Japan are all significant markets for Rapha – the company achieved turnover of £48.8 million in the year to 31 January 2016, with pre-tax profit of £1.1 million.

The Mail on Sunday says that while a source confirmed the two parties were in talks, neither LVMH nor Rapha would comment.

Paris-based LVMH, owner of brands including Louis Vuitton, Moet & Chandon, Marc Jacobs, Dior, TAG Heuer and Bulgari, is known to be keen to build its presence in the sports and leisure sectors.

Earlier this year, LVMH together with the family holding company of CEO Bernard Arnault, took a stake in American private equity house Catterton, which specialised in investing in mid-market companies.

The new business, L Catterton, has investments in businesses including activewear brand Sweaty Betty and pet food manufacturer Lily’s Kitchen, while its holdings in the sports sector include compression clothing maker 2XU, the Peloton at-home fitness bike, sports drinks and supplements manufacturer X2 Performance, and the 360fly action camera brand.

Rapha is a brand that splits opinion like few others. Critics see it as overpriced, pretentious and taking itself too seriously, and it has inspired several spoof websites.

The company’s success, however, demonstrates that Mottram and his team understand their target market, who besides buying its products can unwind, watch races or join group rides at its shop-café Rapha Clubhouse stores.

There are 14 worldwide now as well as an outlet store in Somerset, complemented by occasional pop-ups elsewhere and Mobile Clubhouses on four continents.

Talking to BikeBiz in 2011 about one of those spoof websites, set up by a group calling itself Jens Voight Army (JVA), Mottram said: ""Having detractors is part and parcel of having a distinctive brand.

""If you mean a lot to some people, you are almost bound to aggravate others. We would always rather have people loving or hating us than people not having an opinion. People don't parody or copy weak or uninteresting brands. Team JVA is proof to me that we are getting things right."""
Hermès Joins Luxury Brands Reporting Chinese Recovery - The Business of Fashion,"Thu, 03 Nov 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzb2ZmYXNoaW9uLmNvbS9uZXdzL2x1eHVyeS9oZXJtZXMtam9pbnMtbHV4dXJ5LWdvb2RzLW1ha2Vycy1yZXBvcnRpbmctY2hpbmVzZS1yZWNvdmVyeS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS, France — The recovery in the luxury-goods industry gained pace after luxury handbag maker Hermès International SCA joined LVMH and Gucci parent Kering SA in saying the Chinese market is improving and pointed to growth in leather goods like its iconic Birkin bag.

Revenue climbed to 1.26 billion euros ($1.4 billion), Paris-based Hermès said Thursday, beating estimates. Sales climbed 8.8 percent excluding currency swings, led by 14 percent growth in Asia Pacific, the fastest rate in more than two years. The stock rose as much as 2.4 percent.

Sales of leather goods rose 16 percent, buoyed by $9,000 Constance purses and $5,000 Halzan shoulder bags. The maker of silk scarves joins rivals LVMH and Kering in reporting better-than-expected results, giving the luxury industry some relief ahead of the Christmas season. Others, like Britain's Burberry Group Plc, are still grappling with ebbing demand in key luxury hubs like Hong Kong.

""China is growing at a better pace, mainly because the economy is strengthening and because of domestic consumption,"" chief executive officer Axel Dumas said on a call with reporters. ""In our case, I'm not talking about a rebound, because we always had growth.""

After sales growth of 7.7 percent in the first nine months of the year, Hermès maintained its full-year forecast for growth of “slightly” below 8 percent. Hermès remains cautious as the Christmas season approaches, Dumas said.

“Management has always guided conservatively — under-promise and over-deliver,” Rogerio Fujimori, an analyst at RBC Capital, wrote in a note to clients. Improvement in the Asian market and easier comparisons in France may buoy Hermès's sales, he wrote.

Revenue in France dropped 0.9 percent, while analysts had expected a 3 percent gain. Demand slumped in the fourth quarter last year in that market after the November 13 terror attacks in Paris.
