"Rihanna and LVMH Make a Deal and, Possibly, History (Published 2019) - The New York Times","Thu, 17 Jan 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMTkvMDEvMTcvZmFzaGlvbi9yaWhhbm5hLWZhc2hpb24tYnJhbmQtbHZtaC5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Is Rihanna the Coco Chanel of the 21st century?

Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton LVMH, the parent company of Dior, Givenchy and Fendi, apparently thinks so. It is in the midst of a deal to back her in a fashion brand, making her the first female designer of color at the largest luxury conglomerate in the world.

The news, confirmed by sources within the group who were not authorized to speak for the company, was first reported by WWD. Neither LVMH nor Rihanna would comment, though the singer has recently been photographed on the street wearing a “mystery” pair of oversize Fenty-branded square sunglasses hinting at what may be to come.

While the details of the agreement remain unclear, it is a turning point in both fashion and fame.

The combination of Fenty and LVMH will be the clearest expression yet of how celebrity, social media and influencers have redefined the power balance between culture and consumption, changing the way brands of all kinds relate to their audience.

It is not insignificant that despite the number of well-known and respected designers currently unemployed in the fashion world, including Alber Elbaz, Stefano Pilati and Peter Copping, the dominant luxury group decided to put its money where a pop star was.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999822378158569}",neutral,0.9999822378158569,0
Rihanna is Launching a Luxury Fashion Line Under LVMH - The Cut,"Thu, 17 Jan 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWN1dC5jb20vMjAxOS8wMS9yZXBvcnQtcmloYW5uYS1pcy1sYXVuY2hpbmctYS1sdXh1cnktbGluZS5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Rihanna.

A makeup line, a lingerie collection, and a music career most singers can only dream of isn’t enough to satisfy our desire for Rihanna. So there’s possibly more coming. WWD reported that according to multiple unnamed sources, Rihanna is looking to make a luxury line with Louis Vuitton Moët Hennessy — the conglomerate that owns Marc Jacobs, Dior, and Givenchy (and many others). It’ll be the first brand under LVMH that’s launched from scratch since 1987 and Christian Lacroix.

Some employees have already been plucked from Louis Vuitton and Celine to start Rihanna’s line, according to WWD. Launch TBD, and Rihanna hasn’t confirmed or denied the report yet. However, she may have already give us a look at her designs. She wore a pair of sunglasses emblazoned with “FENTY” out in Manhattan.

There’s quite literally no other celebrity I’d trust to make a luxury line. It’s fun just to speculate about what she’d make. Her own diamond miters? Flask bracelets? Giant tulle dresses? The options are endless.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999964237213135}",neutral,0.9999964237213135,0
Three Problems Overhanging Luxury Giant LVMH: Morgan Stanley - Jing Daily,"Sun, 27 Jan 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiL2h0dHBzOi8vamluZ2RhaWx5LmNvbS9wb3N0cy9sdm1oLW1vcmdhbi1zdGFubGV50gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"“Is the Vuitton brand ‘too’ ubiquitous?”

That’s an intriguing question being raised by investment bank Morgan Stanley ahead of the release of French luxury behemoth LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton (LVMH)’s 2018 full-year results on Tuesday, January 29. The company's results will play an oversized role in the luxury market mood and outlook as LVMH is the first major global luxury player to report since the slowdown of China’s economy.

The sweeping research note, published by the bank on January 16, analyzes in great detail three downside risks the company’s key brands – Louis Vuitton, Hennessy, and Sephora - may face in its long-term operations.

Make no mistake, though, Morgan Stanley maintains its overweight stock rating for LVMH, which is in line with the industry’s bullish consensus. The bank set the price target at €315. It opened the market in Paris at 259.5 euros this Monday. (The share price of the American Depository Receipt, which is the way investors to trade LVMH shares in the United States, stands at 59.07, a few dollars above its 52-week low.)

“To be clear, we don’t think the risks mentioned [in the report] have a high probability of materializing in a meaningful way, but we thought it would be useful for investors to frame the debate,” wrote Edouard Aubin, head of luxury research team at Morgan Stanley.

So, a look at a trio of the challenges faced:

As the conglomerate’s cash machine, Louis Vuitton is estimated to account for approximately 47 percent of LVMH’s consolidated profits in 2018, generating 11.5 billion (€10.2 billion) of sales, up 9.7 percent from the year before, Morgan Stanley said. However, it noted omnipresence could become an issue that hurts desirability of the brand in the coming years.

For luxury brands, maintaining and enhancing desirability is a constant task. Undeniably, Louis Vuitton has been always striving for uncovering new driving forces to improve. In recent years, the brand formed some high-profile collaborations with luxury streetwear labels like Supreme and Off-White. It has also tapped into the influence of fashion designer Virgil Abloh for his popularity among millennials and an ethnically diverse audience. Last week, it was rumored that the house may partner with the black pop singer and culture influencer Rihanna to create a new label.

Louis Vuitton’s long-term investment in art also benefits the brand to stay upscale and exclusive. It has taken its signature art exhibition “Volez, Voguez, Voyagez” to many international destinations including Shanghai, Seoul, Tokyo, and New York. Joint collaborations with contemporary artists like Jeff Koons and Takashi Murakami also created a lot of online buzzes.

“There is no evidence that Vuitton’s desirability has declined in any major geographies in the past few quarters,” Morgan Stanley wrote. However, the brand’s growth could slow to mid-single digit and Vuitton’s EBIT margin could revert back to 40 percent, the low end of Vuitton’s 30-year range, the bank said.

LVMH’s premium beauty department Sephora should contribute to about 10 percent of the company’s profits in 2018, according to Morgan Stanley’s estimates. The brand has been relatively successful in a digital push in the West, as the report noted, making its business less threatened from the internet giant Amazon compared to other traditional retailers.

Sephora’s move in China has been more slow and cautious. It was only last year that the brand set up its first concept store in Asia, which is in Shanghai. And China may prove to be a tough arena for Sephora owing to a variety of the country’s prominent players, especially Alibaba. “In China, Sephora faces direct competition from Tmall and has much less exclusivity of certain brands as it does in other markets,” said Aubin.

Morgan Stanley projected Hennessy to account for about 9 percent of the company’s consolidated profits in 2018, and China plays a large role in that market. China accounted for about 30 percent of sales by volume and about 35 percent by value. It also estimated that about two-thirds of China's spend on cognac is made locally (Mainland China) and about one-third while traveling (Hong Kong, travel retail, etc.).

The profitability of LVMH’s cognac house Hennessy may face trouble in the long run as its major consumer segments (making up for almost 70 percent of its sales) - Chinese and American nationals - are embracing health and wellness trends, the report noted. But the risk can be offset as the trend toward “premiumization” in China is still on the rise, it added.

As a matter of fact, Hennessy’s brand awareness and market penetration in China are leading the league of Western-imported spirits, which includes other categories like whiskey/bourbon, gin, rum, and tequila. In a recent interview with Jing Daily, Andrew Khan, vice president of marketing at Moët Hennessy Diageo China, said the brand achieved double-digit growth in the country in 2018, confirming Morgan Stanley’s observation that “there is no sign that brand momentum is decelerating materially.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.974307119846344}",neutral,0.974307119846344,0
Rihanna Launching Fashion Brand with LVMH - WWD,"Thu, 17 Jan 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3dkLmNvbS9mZWF0dXJlL3JpaGFubmEtbGF1bmNoLWx1eHVyeS1mYXNoaW9uLWhvdXNlLWx2bWgtZXhjbHVzaXZlLTEyMDI5NjM2NTgv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS — Rihanna is getting ready for her next act in fashion, and with the world’s largest luxury group as her partner, WWD has learned.

According to multiple sources, LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton and the music sensation have been in secret discussions to launch a luxury house under her name. That would make it the first fashion brand industry titan Bernard Arnault has launched from scratch since Christian Lacroix in 1987.

LVMH has already handpicked a clutch of employees from within, including some from Louis Vuitton and Celine, to work on the project in tandem with Rihanna and some of her key associates, sources said.

Details about the launch and its timing could not immediately be learned. LVMH officials declined comment Wednesday.

On Tuesday, the Internet lit up with speculation about the origins of the bold, gold shades Rihanna wore while stepping out in Manhattan — her Fenty brand name spelled out across the temples. Sources said the music star was simply test-driving a prototype, while dropping a colossal tease about her next major foray beyond music.

Rihanna has demonstrated a serious interest in, and influence on, fashion — along with formidable design chops and acute instincts — with her recent tenure as the creative director of Puma, energizing the German activewear brand with her Fenty by Puma project, and following it up with successful forays into beauty and lingerie — the former with LVMH-controlled Kendo; the latter with California-based TechStyle Fashion Group.

Her public appearances generally stir the paparazzi, and her fans, into a frenzy, with outfits ranging from sultry off-the-shoulder styles to streetwear to, at the Met Ball, showstopping numbers that are the highlight of the occasion. In May, for example, she wore a Maison Margiela crystal-encrusted gown and bolero jacket, complete with a hat resembling a bishop’s mitre.

It is understood her collection with LVMH will span ready-to-wear, leather goods and accessories, and could be released in tandem with her ninth album, expected out sometime later this year, one source said.

For LVMH, the Rihanna line signals a further move outside its comfort zone of heritage brands as it continues to diversify its holdings, having recently invested $2.6 billion in luxury travel operator Belmond Ltd., owner of the Venice Simplon-Orient-Express train and hotels including the Copacabana Palace in Rio de Janeiro.

Kendo, which functions as an incubator making products that end up being retailed by LVMH’s Sephora perfumery chain and other outposts, signed on Rihanna in 2016. Her Fenty Beauty products racked up sales north of $100 million in a matter of weeks, and was hailed as a transformative brand.

It also cemented Rihanna as one of the hottest-selling celebrities in the world of licensing.

Just a year after its launch, Fenty Beauty by Rihanna is a digital innovator and champion for diversity, using its platforms — 6.3 million Instagram followers, 490,000 YouTube subscribers and 372,000 Twitter followers — to showcase makeup on women of all complexions and sizes. The brand engages with its followers regularly, reposting user-generated content and collaborating with avid fans on videos and posts.

Fenty Beauty’s core collection.

Rihanna’s proximity to LVMH stretches back to at least 2015. After attending shows for Christian Dior, one of Arnault’s most treasured fashion properties, she appeared in “Secret Garden IV,” a campaign and short film shot by Steven Klein inside Versailles. It featured her in Dior sunglasses, carrying the brand’s bags and wearing looks from the Esprit Dior collection.

A year later, she created a range of futuristic sunglasses in collaboration with Dior as part of her brand ambassadorship.

Sources inside LVMH describe her as a hands-on type who is extensively involved in product development. It is understood LVMH started assembling her fashion team about six months ago in Paris, with the project being overseen by Sidney Toledano, chairman and chief executive officer of LVMH Fashion Group, a stable of fashion houses that includes Givenchy, Celine, Kenzo and Marc Jacobs.

Fenty Beauty’s Hector Espinal on Working for Rihanna

Rihanna’s talent and beauty have made her a favorite of fashion designers worldwide. The Barbados native has previously modeled for Gucci, Emporio Armani and Balmain.

She made her debut in design in 2013 with British high-street brand River Island, creating a collection of clothing and accessories.

“Launching at London Fashion Week is a dream come true for me,” she said at the time. “I have wanted to design my own collection for a long time and to present my collection for River Island alongside all of the other great design talent at LFW is a real privilege. I can’t wait to see the reaction from my fans and the fashion press.”

While at Puma, Rihanna staged high-energy shows — one featuring motorcycle acrobats — in Paris and New York. Indicative of her wide appeal, her collection landed at Bergdorf Goodman in New York and spawned a consumer frenzy — and knockoffs galore — for several hit shoe styles, including creepers and furry shower slides.

TechStyle co-ceo Adam Goldenberg told WWD in a recent interview that he chose Rihanna because he needed “the right partner to bring instant credibility and exposure” to a new proposition in the lingerie category.

He confirmed her deep involvement in products that bear her Fenty brand name. “Every single item we have designed she has been involved in the process and seen it on a model, made her own adjustments, decided if we are going to bring it in stock, down to every element of the campaign,” he said.

"LVMH Brought in a ""Record"" $53.5 Billion in Revenue for 2018 - The Fashion Law","Tue, 29 Jan 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWZhc2hpb25sYXcuY29tL2x2bWgtcmV2ZWFscy1yZWNvcmQtNTM1LWJpbGxpb24tcmV2ZW51ZXMtZm9yLTIwMTgv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton welcomed record-high sales for 2018. In a report released on Tuesday, the world’s latest luxury goods conglomerate reveled that revenue for the full year amounted to a whopping 46.8 billion euros ($53.5 billion), an increase of 10 percent over the previous year. “We had another record year, both in terms of revenue and results,” chairman Bernard Arnault said on Tuesday, pointing to “the appeal of our brands and the agility of our teams” as helping to weather the “uncertain environment” that is luxury spending.

In terms of LVMH’s Fashion & Leather Goods business group, where brands like Louis Vuitton, Dior, Celine, Givenchy, and Loewe, among others, reside, organic revenue growth reached 15 percent for the year, with profit from recurring operations up 21 percent.

LVMH specifically name-checked Louis Vuitton as “delivering an exceptional performance, to which all businesses and regions contributed. Its creative strength lies notably in its iconic leather goods lines which are continuously rejuvenated, and in its ready-to-wear and shoe lines.” The group was sure to note that Louis Vuitton is “the only brand in the world to never hold sales nor sell through outlets.”

Beyond its marquee brand, LVMH stated that “Christian Dior had an excellent first full year within LVMH thanks to the creativity of Maria Grazia Chiuri for the Women’s collections and to the arrival of Kim Jones, the new Artistic Director of Dior Homme.” Moreover, “Celine entered a new and ambitious stage of its development with the arrival of Hedi Slimane as Artistic, Creative and Image Director of the brand.”

And still yet, in the Perfume & Cosmetics category, which “achieved organic revenue growth of 14%, driven by the performance of its flagship brands,” LVMH asserted that its Fenty Beauty joint venture with Rihanna continued to experience “exceptional growth.” (No word yet, though, on when we can expect the two to announce their latest venture, a full-fledged Fenty luxury collection).

Arnault, himself, who holds the title of the richest man in France added $4.3 billion to his personal fortune when LVMH’s shares “surged by 6.9 percent [on Wednesday in light of the company’s revenue and profit report], the most since mid-2016,” per Bloomberg.

The group’s full-year earnings report comes just over a week after Morgan Stanley questioned the sustainability of demand for the Louis Vuitton brand, in particular, in light of its significant presence in the market. In a research note released earlier this month, the American investment bank, citing the Paris-based brand’s market “ubiquity” could prove a “risk,” although “there is no evidence that Vuitton’s desirability has declined in any major geographies in the past few quarters.”","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9999992847442627}",positive,0.9999992847442627,1
Versace's New Owner Plans to Build America's Answer to LVMH. It Has a Long Way to Go. - The Business of Fashion,"Mon, 28 Jan 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5idXNpbmVzc29mZmFzaGlvbi5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvbHV4dXJ5L3ZlcnNhY2VzLW5ldy1vd25lci1wbGFucy10by1idWlsZC1hbWVyaWNhcy1hbnN3ZXItdG8tbHZtaC1pdC1oYXMtYS1sb25nLXdheS10by1nby_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"NEW YORK, United States — Will America ever build its own LVMH?

It's a question that has been debated for years, as hopefuls have tried time and again to gather together a group of brands with the potential to one day rival the world's largest luxury group. US-based Tapestry, which owns Coach, Stuart Weitzman and Kate Spade New York has earned its status as the accessible-luxury leader, but its brands can't touch the likes of Louis Vuitton and Dior in terms of status or scale. Ditto PVH, the owner of Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein.

Capri Holdings, which owns Michael Kors, Jimmy Choo and now, Versace, is the latest contender. While the company has a very long way to go before it's anywhere near the scale of LMVH, whose market capitalisation (€130 billion, or $148 billion) dwarfs Capri ($6 billion), it's perhaps the worthiest of consideration. No matter that most Americans are inclined to mispronounce the moniker, named after the glamourous Italian island. (It's Cah-pri, not Cap-ree.) This group, which changed its name from Michael Kors Holdings on December 31, 2018, may be headquartered in New York. But its makeup — Michael Kors, Jimmy Choo and Versace: three different businesses, based in three different countries — reflects the global composition of the fashion industry.

Capri does not intend to grow an accessible luxury group like Tapestry, or an apparel-driven conglomerate like PVH. Instead, it aims to be a pure luxury player, and chief executive John Idol — who has run Michael Kors since 2003, scaling it to $4.5 billion in sales in 2018 — is a stickler for this delineation, despite the decidedly accessible luxury positioning of Michael Kors.

What he says he's trying to build is not luxe-light, but the real thing: a luxury group strong enough to stand alongside European leaders LVMH, Kering and Richemont, which together own more than 100 global luxury brands.

The task is massive. But Idol is undeterred.

“We felt that the luxury market will have the longest sustained growth over the next 20 to 30 years,” the chief executive said in a recent interview at the group’s headquarters overlooking Bryant Park in midtown Manhattan. “We were fortunate to be able to acquire two companies so quickly, and that they were founder-led.”

The ""founder-led"" bit is important to Idol. He said that Donatella Versace, who worked alongside her brother Gianni Versace — the house's founder — for many years before taking over after his death in 1997, is staying put after Capri's acquisition of the Italian fashion house earlier this year for $2.1 billion. So is king-of-New York Kors, who was minted a billionaire when the company went public in 2011, riding a wave of accessibly priced handbags. Sandra Choi, niece of Jimmy Choo's eponymous founder, who has been its creative director since 1996, is sticking around too. (The London-based shoe brand was acquired by Michael Kors for about $1.2 billion in 2017.)

“We have three secret weapons,” Idol said. “We’re not changing those.”

There won't be many changes on the executive side, either. Idol will continue to run Kors, while Jonathan Akeroyd, the former Alexander McQueen executive credited with readying Versace for a sale, will also stay on, as will Pierre Denis, chief executive of Jimmy Choo since 2012.

And yet, plenty of changes are coming to these brands as they make adjustments to their models in order to work towards that lofty goal. What makes LVMH and Kering successful, in part, is their heft. Having so many brands allows them to negotiate better retail deals and media buys. They also have a deep bench of executives, many of whom have been trained up the company’s ranks and can move in and out of different brands because they understand the group’s culture. The ability to share resources on the back end, from technology to manufacturing, is also valuable.

But more than anything, these groups were determined to play the long game from the beginning. This is critical to building and maintaining brands that are part of the fabric of the culture, especially capital-intensive luxury brands that are susceptible to the ebb and flow of fashion trends.

In the past few years, Kering and LVMH have become quicker to change over creative directors if a designer's vision is not selling. But they are careful to maintain the history and heritage of the label in external communications.

In contrast, American luxury brands tend to go through a boom-bust cycle, where they over-expand — often selling cheaper products to increase sales and satisfy the stock market, killing their cultural cred in the process. Calvin Klein, Ralph Lauren, Donna Karan, Marc Jacobs and yes, Michael Kors, are all products of this system. It's why you can still regularly find their products at off-price retailers like T.J. Maxx, where it's next-to impossible to find a label like Dior or Gucci.

""This has resulted in a luxury model based on higher off-price engagement, broader distribution and lower entry-level price points than is generally found in Europe,"" luxury analyst Luca Solca wrote in 2017.

At Capri, a significant amount of its revenue currently comes from Michael Kors products with entry-level prices. In order to stay on the luxury track, a recalibration, if not an extreme disruption, must take place.

Part of the tune up is taking what’s working at one brand and mirroring those tactics at the others. For instance, Michael Kors has too many stores, Versace too few. Each of the brands needs to prioritise digital sales — “the website is now the flagship,” he said — and better capitalise on the China opportunity. (The Asia region currently makes up just 19 percent of the group’s overall sales; Idol is aiming for that share to grow to 30-40 percent.)

All brands ebb and flow; that's just part of the luxury business.

If he pulls it off, Idol believes Capri can generate $8 billion in global revenue in “the next few years,” adding $2 billion to its current annual sales. But what does he need to do in order to make that happen?

TURNING AROUND MICHAEL KORS

ADVERTISEMENT

Future-proofing the Michael Kors business is a crucial first step. In recent years, the brand’s sales have dipped as it continues its plan to close 100 of its own stores and attempts to reduce its reliance on discount-driven department stores. In its most recent fiscal year, ending in March 2018, sales at the Michael Kors brand were $4.5 billion, flat from 2017 and down from $4.7 billion in 2016. Some of that shrinkage was purposeful and related to the pullback on discounting; some of it had to do with over-distribution and ubiquity of the lower-priced goods.

Michael Kors remains an extremely profitable business, generating enough extra cash to start buying up other companies. But in order for it to remain so, Idol will have to tweak the Michael Kors offering, further developing the upscale ready-to-wear and luxury accessories business so that it can be less reliant on its once-hot timepiece business — part of a licensing deal with Fossil that generated more than $630 million for the watchmaker in 2017 — which continues to dwindle in the face of smartphones and smart watches.

In the group's 2018 fiscal year, royalties from licensed products, which include a beauty deal with Esteé Lauder, an eyewear deal with Luxottica and the deal with Fossil, were $145 million, down ever so slightly from $146 million the year before. The company attributed the decrease, in part, to lower sales of fashion watches, jewellery and fragrances that was offset by sales of smartwatches and eyewear.

Its Michael Michael Kors handbag offering, the mid-priced products sold at places like Macy’s and off-price retailers, have become less desirable. Idol said the brand didn’t do enough to capitalise on the logo-mania trend, either. “We did not go after it in the way that we should have,” he said.

To remedy that, Kors is rethinking its marketing strategy, from the images themselves to the way they are distributed. (In November 2017, the company hired Valentino veteran Francesca Leoni as the chief brand officer for Michael Kors, indicating a shift in approach.)

On February 4, Michael Kors will release a new Spring 2019 Michael Michael Kors (MMK) campaign featuring ""signature"" — read: logo — product, starring Bella Hadid and photographed by David Sims. (While disgraced photographer Mario Testino used to be the go-to for Kors, the brand has more recently contracted Sims and Inez & Vinoodh, who shot the Spring 2019 collection campaign.) While the idea of a ""jet set"" lifestyle remains core to the Kors brand — and the designer himself remains the ultimate spokesman — it has been updated with a new visual language and a new communications strategy.

In 2018, the group spent approximately $167 million on advertising and marketing, up from $119 million a year earlier. While the company doesn’t currently break down the difference between its digital and print spend, a spokesperson said that there has been a significant shift towards digital for certain brands in key markets.

Idol said that the brand’s ready-to-wear — the expensive runway “Collection” sold at select retailers and Michael Kors’ stores — is one of the group’s fastest-growing segments, and that the company is already making up for a slowdown in cheap bags with an increased demand for its higher-priced bags, like the “Bancroft” shoulder satchel. Michael Kors menswear, which Idol has in the past estimated can become a billion-dollar business on its own, remains a priority, despite the fact that men’s “takes longer to develop.” Soon, Michael Kors will launch men’s shoes for the Fall 2019 season to complement what Idol says is a large women’s footwear business.

Moving upmarket can be a nearly impossible task, but Kors started as a designer brand in 1981. The lower-priced Kors gear only really hit the mainstream in the last 15 years, after LVMH sold its 33 percent stake in the business to investors Silas Chou, Lawrence Stroll and Idol, transforming the business along the way into something more reliant on its accessible-luxury products. Soon after LVMH let go of its stake in Kors, the designer ended his run as creative director of Celine, one of the conglomerate's French houses.

Idol said that Capri is “deeply committed” to the success of the Kors mid-market business, although the company is investing more in luxury. He citied the two acquisitions, as well as the purchasing of factories and other facilities to help support those businesses, as proof points. “You'll be hearing some additional announcements about other things we will do to support that in terms of infrastructure,” he said. There are also still no plans to build lower-priced collections into the Jimmy Choo and Versace offering.

LEVERAGING THE POWER OF THE VERSACE BRAND

For Versace, image is far from the problem. Donatella Versace and her cadre of OG supermodels are beloved and idolised the world over. However, the power of the brand is much greater than the scale of the business the company has been able to build. Idol expects that the Italian house will more-than double its sales to $2 billion in the coming years, thanks to the combination of global name recognition and a bigger investment in everything from its retail network to its manufacturing capabilities. Right now, Versace has 195 stores. The plan is to bump that up to 300, and to expand its handbag and womenswear offerings.

Men’s makes up 49 percent of the Versace business: unusual for a luxury brand. Right now, 46 percent of its sales are from Asia, while only 18 percent is from the Americas region, where Idol said it is underdeveloped. Versace is also largely driven by ready-to-wear and has a nominal handbag business, which is a major structural disadvantage given the favourable economics of the product. That imbalance, he said, equals opportunity: If the brand can continue to ride the nostalgia wave that Donatella Versace has so deftly captured in her runway collections and deliver in currently popular categories, like sneakers, doubling sales is not out of the question.

Of course, this revival won’t last forever. “All brands ebb and flow; that’s just part of the luxury business,” Idol said. “There are going to be moments...where your house is the hottest and there are going to be times when you’re doing modest. That, quite frankly, is why it’s important to have a group. Not everything is going to be of the moment.” He went on to note that Versace has grown almost every single year since it opened in 1978.

While capitalising on trends might earn short-term gains, it's the accessories business that could sustain Versace in the long term. But getting handbags right won't be easy. Many luxury brands that started out as fashion houses have had success with bags — from Chanel and Dior to Balenciaga, Saint Laurent and Celine — but the market has never been more crowded.

Whether Versace can win in handbags is a major question mark.

Meanwhile, consumers are shifting their spending to shoes. (In order to grow enough, Versace will have to be successful in both categories.)

Whether Versace can win in handbags is a major question mark. The key, said luxury analyst Mario Ortelli, will be for Versace to hit on a style that feels perennial. “You want something to be on the safe side,” he said.

BOOSTING JIMMY CHOO

Jimmy Choo, the smallest brand in the portfolio, must also develop its handbags business. It'll make a serious push in the second half of 2019 with the launch of its own logo-ed ""signature"" collection. A new campaign starring teen model Kaia Gerber, shot by legendary photographer Steven Meisel, was also something of a reset for the label. ""She's young and dynamic,"" Idol said. ""[Hiring Gerber] was a seminal moment for us at Jimmy Choo, to really continue to communicate what this brand and this house stands for."" Like Versace, Choo will also continue to build its store network — up to approximately 250 stores from the current 213 — and develop the brand, known for sexy, classic-looking styles, beyond footwear.

Long term, though, Capri as a whole will benefit from deeper penetration in China. Despite the slowdown in the region exacerbated by a trade war with the United States, a larger middle class that shops locally means larger demand for new entrants into the market.

“Up until quite recently, top-of-mind, high-end brands had a strong hold on the Chinese consumer,” Ortelli said. “But there is a growing opportunity with the growth of the middle class. Even if there is a slowdown for a year, that doesn’t mean the story will always be the same.”

Idol must also contend with public stakeholders, many of whom believed that Capri paid too much for Versace, causing the stock to plummet in the months following the announcement that it was buying the company. In August 2018, cost per share hit nearly $74. More recently, it has hovered below $40.

Specialty retail analyst Dylan Carden at William Blair recently adjusted its earnings estimates for the 2019 fiscal year, which ends in March, citing pressure on margins that are already below the luxury average, due to the investments it’s making in opening new stores for Versace and Jimmy Choo, building a bigger accessories business, and spending more on marketing overall. “The core Michael Kors brand performance has deteriorated and we believe has yet to show meaningful signs of recovery,” Carden wrote in a recent note.

Shareholder pressure aside, Idol is taking the longview.

""In any businesses, whether you’re in the luxury business or in the consumer products business, there are going to be moments when different parts of your organisation are going to be performing better than others,"" he said. ""Michael Kors will grow. It will grow more slowly than the other two companies.... Once people see us execute after a few quarters or a year, and they see great results, there is going to be a very positive reaction. We’ve been very clearly stating what we believe we are going to be able to achieve. You have to deliver on your vision.""

You have to deliver on your vision.

But while Idol has great ambitions for the group, don't expect a shopping spree in 2019 or 2020.

""For the next 24 months, we're going to focus on the development of Versace because we've made that very large acquisition. We're still focused on the development of Jimmy Choo. And of course, Michael Kors is going to continue to be our most important brand in terms of revenues and earnings, so we need to stay very focused on that,"" he said. ""If something very interesting or unique or special was to come along, I think we would certainly consider it. But that's not our priority right now.""

After all, LVMH was built over the course of nearly 40 years, Kering, as it stands today, over more than 20. In order for Idol to do it right, it will take time. So, don’t get too excited.

“We are in the early days,” Ortelli said. “We’ll have to see how it will work.”

Despite a tumultuous year in global stock markets and trade tensions, one branch of the world economy came out of 2018 miraculously unscathed: the luxury goods sector.

On Tuesday, LVMH (LVMHF), the world’s largest luxury conglomerate, posted a record revenue of $53.4 billion, a nine percent jump from the previous year and the best number in the company’s history. Eighteen percent of the sales, or $9.6 billion, was net profits.

Among the roster of big-name brands under the LVMH umbrella, sales from Louis Vuitton alone topped $11.4 billion for the year (that’s roughly 20,000 Louis Vuitton Neverfull totes sold every day). The group also owns Bulgari, Fendi, beauty store chain Sephora, cognac maker Hennessy and dozens of other brands.

Consumers in China and the U.S. drove the revenue surge last year despite escalating fears of a Chinese economic meltdown and a U.S.-China geopolitical face-off throughout 2018.

Spending on LVMH brands by Chinese consumers, either domestically or on trips abroad, grew by double digits in the fourth quarter of 2018, said Jean-Jacques Guiony, LVMH’s chief financial officer. “We see no particular slowdown in the fourth quarter compared with the rest of the year.”

“Viewed from here, it seems as if China was plunging into recession. [But] we are talking about 6.3 percent [GDP] growth. That’s a lot,” he added.

Part of LVMH’s China boom last year was also fueled by industry-wide price cuts led by Louis Vuitton in China over the summer after the Chinese government slashed import tariffs on clothing products from 16 percent to seven percent.

China and the U.S. are LVMH’s two largest markets, contributing half of the company’s total revenues.

LVMH’s blockbuster results defy earlier predictions that the global stock market rout in the last three months of 2018 might do some damage to the luxury sector. Bernard Arnault, LVMH’s CEO and largest shareholder (and also Europe’s richest man), is confident that the momentum will continue into the new year. “January [2019] is looking very good,” he told investors on Tuesday.

However, if the global economy continues its sluggishness into 2019 and beyond, high-end retail experts caution that its effect may eventually kick in for makers of luxury goods.

“Historically, the stock market is much more of an impact factor only on the very high-end luxury sector. But that’s a long-term effect, not on the day-to-day basis,” Steve Sadove, former CEO of Saks Fifth Avenue, told Observer in an interview last November.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9987063407897949}",neutral,0.9987063407897949,0

Louis Vuitton parent owner LVMH is developing a luxury brand with singer Rihanna, in a rare move by the acquisitive group towards building a new fashion label from scratch, industry news site Women’s Wear Daily (WWD) reported on Wednesday.

It already has a partnership with the Umbrella singer in make-up. Fenty Beauty, which was developed with Rihanna via LVMH’s Kendo “brand incubator”, which promotes new products and labels, has grown rapidly since launching in September 2017.

LVMH said last April it expected Fenty to reach US$500 million in retail sales in 2018 – which includes the revenue reaped by third parties — though it has not given an update since.

The new Rihanna venture would include clothing, leather goods and accessories, WWD said, citing sources with knowledge of the launch. It said a collection could be released later this year, though the timing was uncertain.

Run by billionaire boss Bernard Arnault, LVMH has more often opted to grow through purchases, and it splashed out US$3.2 billion at the end of last year to buy hotel owner Belmond in a bid to branch into upscale hospitality.

In recent months it has also invested heavily in developing its existing brands, including Celine, which has brought in a new designer and launched into menswear in a bid to grow revenue.

Luxury firms are facing headwinds including a potential slowdown in China, and are jostling to stand out from the crowd and attract younger shoppers by switching designers or working with celebrities and social media influencers as part of a marketing push.

LVMH Reports Strong Growth But Remains Cautious about the Global Economy - Jing Daily,"Tue, 29 Jan 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiKGh0dHBzOi8vamluZ2RhaWx5LmNvbS9wb3N0cy9sdm1oLXE0LTIwMTjSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Luxury stock investors held their collective breath as the world’s largest luxury player unveiled their earnings for last year -- a year dominated by news about lagging luxury sales at overseas destinations by wealthy Chinese tourists.

After last week’s mixed news about Burberry’s results and some surprisingly positive Chinese tourist sales data, industry players hoped for some positive news from French luxury behemoth LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton (LVMH) as it released its fourth quarter and full-year 2018 financial results on Tuesday after the market closed in Paris.

The company reported that full-year revenue increased by 10 percent year-on-year to 53.48 billion (€46.8 billion). For the fourth quarter, it recorded 9 percent year-on-year growth in revenue to 15.646 billion (€13.697 billion), a number that was slightly below the consensus forecast compiled by FactSet.

LVMH attributed 29 percent of its 2018 revenue to the Asian market (excluding Japan), which is only matched by all of Europe. The company saw no changes in Chinese customer demand between the third and fourth quarters, but also no slowdown toward the end of the year. The demand in China in 2018 could be attributed to the company lowering prices to more closely match those in other countries. Results were also affected by LVMH adding Christian Dior Couture to their Fashion and Leather Goods sector, the company buying the hotel operator Belmond in December, and the Yellow Vest political protests in France.

LVMH’s 2018 net profit increased 18 percent from the previous year to 7.256 billion (€6.354 billion). Analysts had expected full-year net profit to rise to €6.47 billion from €5.13 billion in 2017, according to consensus estimates from FactSet.

On top of that, LVMH has seen a positive start to 2019, according to information provided during the earnings call, though no specific figures were provided. The company is, however, cautious about the economic situation over the next few years, stating that a recession would likely affect its sales. “That [recession] trend will come to Europe in 2020 or 2021,” said Bernard Arnault, chairman and chief executive officer of LVMH, during the conference call. “There will be a similar phenomenon in Europe as we are seeing in the United States now.”

The company maintained strong confidence in the future growth of Louis Vuitton -- the most important brand in its portfolio. Arnault mentioned the desirability of the Vuitton brand, stating that it remained high across all markets thanks to the quality products and designs brought in by womenswear designer Nicolas Ghesquière and menswear designer Virgil Abloh. The company is also planning a few more store openings for the brand at locations around the world, like Sydney, Osaka, and London, over the coming quarters.

2018 also saw LVMH integrate Christian Dior Couture business into its Fashion and Leather Goods segment for the first time. This addition made a positive contribution of 3 percentage points to the segment's revenue growth. In addition, the company noted that Hennessy cognac saw “strong momentum” in China during 2018 and predicted it will soon become the world’s no. 1 spirit brand. LVMH's Dom Perignon Champagne was also a popular purchase in China during the year.

HSBC analysts predicted prior to the earnings release that there is growth potential in the company's Bvlgari jewelry brand, as that industry segment is just starting to grow in China.

Like other luxury brands that have lamented the lack of retail spending by Chinese tourists abroad, LVMH might have to rely more on sales inside mainland China. Even retailers in Hong Kong, such as cosmetics seller Sa Sa International Holdings Ltd. and jewelry retailer Chow Tai Fook Jewellery Group Ltd., have seen sales grow minimally despite improved transportation links with the mainland.

The company’s stock closed up 0.43 percent at €259.75 prior to the earnings release on January 29th.

LVMH Said Eyeing Stake in New Guards Group - WWD,"Fri, 18 Jan 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3dkLmNvbS9mYXNoaW9uLW5ld3MvZmFzaGlvbi1zY29vcHMvbHZtaC1zYWlkLWV5ZWluZy1zdGFrZS1pbi1uZXctZ3VhcmRzLWdyb3VwLTEyMDI5NzIzNzAv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"A NEW GUARDS DEAL FOR LVMH?: LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton might be getting even closer to one of its star designers, Virgil Abloh.

According to market sources, the French luxury group is in talks with New Guards Group, the Milan-based parent company of the Off-White brand created by Abloh, who is also creative director of men’s wear at Louis Vuitton.

New Guards Group Holding SpA includes the Marcelo Burlon County of Milan label, Palm Angels, Heron Preston, Unravel Project, Alanui and A Plan Application.

The fashion group was founded by Davide de Giglio, Claudio Antonioli and Burlon in 2015.

Off-White was launched online in late 2013, holding its first showroom presentation in Paris the following January with designs that merged influences ranging from Bauhaus to sports apparel and Caravaggio. It established the visual signature of the brand: thick diagonal stripes that have become a byword for insider cool.

“Cool” is a word that also applies to the other brands in the New Guards Group. Francesco Ragazzi, who is also art director of Moncler, established Palm Angels in 2015, inspired by the vision of Eighties’ American fashion entrepreneurs such as Ralph Lauren and Tommy Hilfiger. The brand was launched with the blessing of Pharrell Williams, who wrote the introduction of the “Palm Angels” photo book that Ragazzi published with Rizzoli in September 2014.

Marcelo Burlon County of Milan was established in 2012 as a brand selling printed T-shirts, but his founder has been building the elevated streetwear label’s credibility with solid collections.

Preston this week staged his inaugural runway show in Paris, titled “Night Shift,” held at the Palais de Tokyo. A former art director for Kanye West, Preston, who grew up with the skate culture in San Francisco, worked at Nike Inc. and was also a part of the Been Trill art and DJ collective with Abloh, Justin Saunders and Matthew Williams.

Alanui is known for its luxury knitwear and was founded in 2015 by siblings Carlotta and Nicolò Oddi.

A Plan Application is the brainchild of the U.K.-based sculptor Anna Blessmann and is the most recent addition to New Guards Group.

Chiara Ferragni to Join LVMH Prize Panel - WWD,"Fri, 25 Jan 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3dkLmNvbS9mZWF0dXJlL2NoaWFyYS1mZXJyYWduaS10by1qb2luLWV4cGVydHMtb24tbHZtaC1wcml6ZS1wYW5lbC0xMjAyOTg4MTc3L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS — The LVMH Prize for Young Fashion Designers is ramping up its digital presence.

LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton has asked Chiara Ferragni, one of the world’s top influencers with 15.9 million followers on Instagram, to join the expert committee for the sixth edition of the award. Ferragni has close ties to LVMH-owned Dior, whose women’s wear designer Maria Grazia Chiuri made her wedding dress.

Ferragni joins Naomi Campbell and 14 other newcomers, drawn from the worlds of media and e-commerce, on the prize panel.

They include Rami Atallah, cofounder and chief executive officer of Ssense.com; Aizel Trudel, founder of Russian e-commerce site Aizel.ru; Aimee Song of fashion blog Song of Style; Kevin Ma, founder and ceo of Hypebeast; stylist Marie Chaix; documentary maker Loïc Prigent, and fashion journalist Angelo Flaccavento.

Also new are Edward Enninful, editor in chief of Vogue U.K.; Ezra Petronio, editor in chief of Self Service; Joerg Koch, founder and editor in chief of 032c; Ashley Heath, editorial director of Pop and Arena Homme +; Suzanne Koller, fashion director of M Le Monde, and System cofounders Elizabeth von Guttman and Alexia Niedzielski.

“We are thrilled to welcome this year both prominent personalities from traditional fashion media and professionals who have succeeded in creating innovative online platforms for communication and commerce,” said Delphine Arnault, second-in-command at Louis Vuitton and a member of LVMH’s executive committee.

The panel now counts a total of 62 experts, of which around half are from so-called traditional media.

“However, the titles represented also have a presence online, and the line between print and web has become increasingly blurred. The appearance in recent years of pure web players has been a game-changer and created new platforms for fashion lovers who yearned to express something new,” Arnault told WWD.

“They represent fertile ground for expression and opportunity for designers. The emergence of certain pure players has been a springboard for young designers, alongside a specialist press that spots them. It was our duty to identify and support these new opportunities to support the development of young brands,” she added.

Arnault, a key talent scout at the luxury group her family controls, also noted the prize had opted for a web application format from the beginning. The winner, decided by a jury including LVMH’s top designers, will walk away with a cash prize of 300,000 euros plus a year of coaching from experts at LVMH.

Launched in 2013, the prize is open to designers under age 40 who have presented and sold at least two collections of women’s, men’s or unisex ready-to-wear.

Arnault said it was too early to comment on the composition of this year’s jury, and whether it would include Virgil Abloh, who joined the group last year as artistic director of men’s wear at Louis Vuitton. Nicolas Ghesquière, who designs women’s wear at Vuitton, already sits on the jury.

Though Arnault declined to comment on reports that LVMH plans to launch a luxury label with Rihanna, the executive said the group was committed to representing a wide range of talents.

“Diversity is essential for LVMH. We hired Virgil Abloh above all because he is an extremely talented designer who again proved his creativity during this [men’s] fashion week. We are also proud to have two female creative directors, Maria Grazia Chiuri and Clare Waight Keller, at the head of two big houses. But it’s above all a question of talent,” she emphasized.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999828338623047}",neutral,0.9999828338623047,0

The luxury conglomerated has named Delphine Arnault new member of the executive committee. The executive is the daughter of Bernard Arnault, chairman and CEO of the group. After Chantal Gaemperle, HR manager, Delphine is the second woman in LVMH’s committee, which at present consists of 12 members.

Arnault, at 43 years old, has also become the youngest member of the group managing body, which includes Antonio Belloni, Deputy Director General at LVMH; Nicolas Bazire, Development and Acquisitions Manager; Pietro Beccari, Chairman and CEO at Christian Dior Couture; and Michael Burke, chairman and CEO at Louis Vuitton.

The management body is completed by Chantal Gaemperle; Jean-Jacques Guiony, Financial Director of the group and President and CEO of La Samaritaine; Chris de Lapuente, CEO of Sephora; Philippe Schaus, Chairman and CEO of Moët Hennessy; Sidney Toledano, Cresident and CEO of LVMH Fashion Group; Jean-Baptiste Voisin, Strategy Director of the LVMH group and President of LVMH Métiers d'Art, and Bernard Arnault, Chairman of the luxury conglomerate.

LVMH has an executive committee composed of twelve members

Delphine Arnault works in Louis Vuitton since 2013, and is the second on board, in charge of supervising product management at the company. The executive studied in Edhec Business School and London School of Economics, and started her career as a consultant in McKinsey.

Arnault began working in the fashion sector in 2000, supervising the business development of John Galliano. One year later, Delphine Arnault joined Christian Dior Couture as Commercial Director and then she was promoted to Deputy Director General. In addition to this, she was the initiator of the LVMH prize.

Three of Delphine Arnault’s siblings also work at the group: Antoine is CEO of Berluti, Alexander is in charge of the position of CEO at Rimowa and Fréderic is Strategy Director at Tag Heuer. LVMH had a revenue of 33.129 million euros between January and September of 2018, 10% more than in the same period last year, when it received 30.095 million euros of earnings.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999972581863403}",neutral,0.9999972581863403,0

The multi-billion-dollar French company acquired iconic travel chain Belmond (known for its breathtaking gastronomical affair at 21 Club in New York as well as its Venice Simplon-Orient-Express) in its biggest purchase since gaining complete control of Christian Dior in 2017.

Striving to further increase its presence in the experiential hospitality world, LVHM invested US$2.6 billion to gain access to 46 venues (including hotels, rail and river cruises) collectively worth US$3.2 billion including debt.

Unique safaris, luxury tourist trains and river cruises will add a new dimension to the French company’s empire

Sharing a desire to create timeless experiences, the absorption of Belmond into LVMH will offer exceptional adventures across all corners of the globe.

The hotel franchise operates in 24 countries including Mexico, Brazil and Venice, allowing the French business to have a prominent stance in the rapidly growing industry. Globally diverse and highly refined guests are challenging the historic definition of luxury by snubbing material items for money-can’t-buy adventures – and the more untouched, the more luxurious it becomes.

“Belmond delivers unique experiences to discerning travellers and owns a number of exceptional assets in the most desirable destinations,” LVMH CEO and Chairman Bernard Arnault says. “Its heritage, its innovative services, its excellence in execution and its entrepreneurship resonates well with the values of the group and is complementary to our own Cheval Blanc maisons and the Bvlgari hotels activities.

“This acquisition will significantly increase LVMH’s presence in the ultimate hospitality world.”

While Belmond primarily offers incredible hotel experiences, it is the unique safaris, luxury tourist trains and river cruises that will add a new dimension to the French company’s empire – a drawcard the heritage business hopes will attract a new audience of younger consumers.

The new addition, which is expected to be settled mid-2019, will join the brand’s expansive portfolio of leading luxury titles including Louis Vuitton, Celine, Fendi, Krug, Veuve Clicquot and Dom Pérignon.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9894987344741821}",positive,0.9894987344741821,1

H&M and Lyft Partner to Make It Easier to Recycle Your Clothes

H&M has long accepted clothing donations as part of its recycling plan. But now it is making it easier for New Yorker’s to drop off their clothes. The company has partnered with Lyft to give free rides up to $10 to those looking to donate unwanted clothes to the retailer’s garment collection program. Citing the popularity of Tidying Up with Marie Kondo for inspiring people to clean out their closets, H&M and Lyft would rather see the items recycled than thrown away. The promotion is available now through January 27 to the first 5000 customers to use the promo code HMRECYCLES to any H&M location in NY. In return for at least one clothing item, from any brand and in any condition, customers will also receive 15% off an H&M purchase.

LVMH Luxury Ventures Takes Minority Stake in Gabriela Hearst - WWD,"Mon, 14 Jan 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3dkLmNvbS9mZWF0dXJlL2x2bWgtbHV4dXJ5LXZlbnR1cmVzLXRha2VzLW1pbm9yaXR5LXN0YWtlLWluLWdhYnJpZWxhLWhlYXJzdC0xMjAyOTYxNzUxL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Gabriela Hearst LLC said Monday it has received a minority investment from LVMH Luxury Ventures, an entity within LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton. Terms of the investment were not disclosed.

In business since 2015, the Gabriela Hearst brand focuses on luxury ready-to-wear and accessories. The designer opened her first flagship store in November at the Carlyle House on Madison Avenue, has developed a robust rtw and accessories business, was the grand prize winner of the International Woolmark Award, and a 2018 finalist for the CFDA Womenswear Designer of the Year award. Her designs reflect a commitment to sustainability.

The company, which is profitable, has sales of more than $10 million. Last March, the company opened a permanent showroom in Paris at 1 Avenue Montaigne in a 2,000-square-foot, two-bedroom apartment.

This is the third investment for LVMH Luxury Ventures. The investment will be used to support the ongoing expansion of the Hearst brand’s presence around the world.

Hearst was not available for comment.

Hearst, who was born in Uruguay, took over her father’s ranch there. Her goal was to create a brand that reflected the slower pace and process, where things are made with care and detail. In her designs, she uses some of the wool from her family’s ranch. After a lot of insistence from her husband, she had a mill in Italy take the wool from the ranch and process it, and such looks as her navy twill and gray flannel from the collection comes from the wool from the farm.

“There’s a joke that if the end of the world is coming, you move to Uruguay, because it will come in 15 years,” said Hearst, speaking at the WWD CEO Summit last October. “I learned about quality there, and quality that’s not opulence. Quality that’s made from a utilitarian point of view. Everything, the leather is made by hand, the saddles are made by hand. They need to last. That’s what quality is. You can’t do quality fast. It takes time. That’s where the timeless aspect comes from.”

At the CEO Summit, Hearst described what luxury meant to her. “My family is five generations, and I’m six generations in business. But I know what passion looks like and feels like. It takes sometimes a generation or more to make a good product. When you’re working with mills that are family-owned, they take so much pride in the product. It takes more of a lifetime to create a product. For me, that’s luxury. It’s knowing where everything is made, how it’s made and what you’re giving to your customer.”

Gabriela Hearst is the designer’s second collection that she started from scratch, the first being Candela, a beachy, boho contemporary line launched in 2004. Hearst is married to Austin Hearst, the grandson of William Randolph Hearst, and her current business is self-financed, which allows her the luxury of doing things on her own terms. Her handbag line is strictly direct to consumer.

Hearst’s rtw is available globally at stores such as Bergdorf Goodman, Saks Fifth Avenue, Neiman Marcus, Lane Crawford, Selfridges, Le Bon Marché, Forty Five Ten, Richards, Net-a-porter, Matchesfashion.com, Harvey Nichols, and Hirshleifers.

Stylish celebrities have been spotted wearing Hearst’s designs such as Meghan Markle, who carried the Nina bag on Monday, and Glenn Close, who wore Hearst’s custom double-faced, silk, single-breasted blazer and skirt at the 24th annual Critics’ Choice Awards Sunday. Others photographed wearing her looks recently include Lady Gaga, Zoë Kravitz, Demi Moore, Amal Clooney and Rosamund Pike.

LVMH Luxury Ventures was launched in 2017, and is an entity within the LVMH Group aimed at taking minority stakes in emerging, but already iconic, brands, with a view to create value. The size of the investment allocated to each company ranges from 2 million euros to 15 million euros per deal.

LVMH Luxury Ventures’ first investment was in the French apothecary brand L’Officine Universelle Buly. Its second was in Stadium Goods, which was subsequently acquired by Farfetch. Hearst marks its third deal.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999793767929077}",neutral,0.9999793767929077,0
LVMH to launch a brand with Rihanna to take the Fenty effect to fashion - MDS,"Thu, 17 Jan 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZW1kcy5jb20vY29tcGFuaWVzL2x2bWgtdG8tbGF1bmNoLWEtYnJhbmQtd2l0aC1yaWhhbm5hLXRvLXRha2UtdGhlLWZlbnR5LWVmZmVjdC10by1mYXNoaW9uLmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LVMH squeezes the Rihanna phenomenon. The luxury giant is negotiating with the singer the launch of a fashion brand with her name, according to WWD. The company already owns Fenty, the cosmetics firm that the celebrity launched in 2017 and that was one of the biggest phenomena in this sector over the last few years.

If the new agreement is confirmed, it would be the first time that LVMH develops a brand from scratch since the launch of Christian Lacroix in 1987. According to sources close to the WWD operation, LVMH has already begun to select a group of employees that come from companies like Louis Vuitton and Celine among others, to work on the project.

Rihanna teamed up with Kendo, the accelerator of cosmetic start-ups owned by LVMH, to release Fenty Beauty in 2017

The firm would include a collection of fashion, leather goods and accessories, and could be launched coinciding with the release of its ninth album, which is expected to hit stores this year.

Rihanna has quite an experience in fashion business. In 2014, the singer joined Puma as creative director, and she has also launched two lines of cosmetics and intimate fashion with her surname, Fenty.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999905824661255}",neutral,0.9999905824661255,0

She wore the mysterious Fenty shades again during another outing in New York City.

Is she dropping a standalone sunglasses collection or a full-blown accessory line? Neither—at least, not yet: the singer is gearing up to take her fashion reach to the next level by going luxury.

According to WWD, Rihanna is joining forces with LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, home to Fendi, Christian Dior, Kenzo, Givenchy and more, to launch her very own luxury house, which would make it the first time ever LVMH chairman and chief executive officer Bernard Arnault launched a brand new house under the company since Christian Lacroix in 1987.

To start, Rihanna will receive assistance from employees from LVMH's brands, including Louis Vuitton and Celine, along with her own team to develop her collection, which will likely include fashion, leather goods and accessories, due out sometime this year.

Of course, this news comes as no surprise as Rihanna has already whipped up several fashion collections, including her debut collection with UK retailer River Island in 2013 and then multiple collections (and runway shows) for her Fenty x Puma range. Fashion aside, the singer has become a formidable force in the lingerie department with her eponymous lingerie label Savage x Fenty and the beauty world with the launch of Fenty Beauty.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.999996542930603}",neutral,0.999996542930603,0
"UPDATED: LVMH and Rihanna in ""Secret Talks"" to Launch Luxury Label - The Fashion Law","Thu, 17 Jan 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWZhc2hpb25sYXcuY29tL3JlcG9ydC1sdm1oLWFuZC1yaWhhbm5hLXRvLWxhdW5jaC1sdXh1cnktbGFiZWwv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton and Rihanna are said to be expanding their partnership beyond her hot-selling Fenty Beauty to a full-fledged fashion line. Women’s Wear Daily is exclusively reporting that the Paris-based luxury goods conglomerate (which is parent to Louis Vuitton, Dior, Givenchy, Celine, and Marc Jacobs, among other brands) and the multi-hyphenate Grammy winner “have been in secret discussions to launch a luxury house under her name.”

While no one from either camp would confirm or deny the reports, WWD’s sources reveal that “LVMH has already handpicked a clutch of employees from within [its ranks], including some from Louis Vuitton and Celine, to work on the project in tandem with Rihanna and some of her key associates.”

The potential new venture comes after 30-year old Rihanna Fenty launched her eponymous beauty line with Kendo, LVMH’s incubator for cool new makeup brands, in September 2017, to smashing success. Known for its industry-distrusting selection of a whopping 40 shades of foundation (the industry norm is a much smaller number that tends to favor lighten skin tones), the collection spawned waiting lists at some cosmetics counters, and is said to have brought in a whopping $100 million in its first 40 days of operation, helping to put Fenty Beauty “on track to beat out blockbuster revenues of Kylie Jenner’s Kylie Beauty [which as of August 2017 had sold a total of $420 million products] and Kim Kardashian’s KKW.”

The songstress and budding lifestyle mogul has also put her well-established stamp on a since-completed collaboration with Puma for a collection of garments and footwear, and most recently, an undergarments line, called Savage, in connection with which Fenty debuted underwear in nude hues for a huge array of skin tones, and boasts one of the more inclusive size selections on the market.

Keeping in line with her focus on diverse offerings, the Savage collection “currently offers bras in sizes 32A to 38DD, underwear up to a size 3X, and other lingerie from extra small to extra large.” And according to Vogue, the company has “stated plans to increase their size range even further very soon.”

As for the allegedly impending luxury venture, “It is understood her collection with LVMH will span ready-to-wear, leather goods and accessories, and could be released in tandem with her ninth album, expected out sometime later this year,” one source told WWD.

Commenting on the rumored partnership, Quartz’s Marc Bain wrote on Thursday, “The celebrity clothing line is a well-worn concept, but a partnership between Rihanna and LVMH would be something else … The reported tie up emphasizes the extraordinary potential LVMH sees in Rihanna, with good reason. Beyond the obvious advantages of her high marketability and her recognized status as one of the most adventurously fashionable stars of her time.”

UPDATED (February 26, 2019): It is happening. According to British Vogue, French accounting firm Ledouble obtained filings that illustrate the soon-to-be announced partnership between Rihanna and LVMH, entitled Project Loud France. “Transactions filed show that Rihanna has invested €29,988,000 [$34.17 million] worth of in-kind contributions to the business, and LVMH has pledged over €30 million to the brand.”

According to Vogue, “A document on the recent cash flow (€29,960,000 [$34.13 million] was deposited on December 20, 2018, in addition to the initial equity of €40,000 which dates back to June 29, 2017) was signed by Antoine Arnault on behalf of a company called LV Group.”

While LVMH is reported to be the majority owner of the venture, Rihanna is not far behind as a 49.99 percent shareholder in Project Loud France by way her company Denim UK Holdings.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9998350143432617}",neutral,0.9998350143432617,0

CBRE arranged the $13.3-million sale of a 60,000-square-foot Class A office building in Springfield, NJ. The property, which serves as the national headquarters for the watch and jewelry divisions of LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE, traded in a 1031 exchange.

A CBRE team of Charles Berger, Elli Klapper and Mark Silverman represented the seller, a tenancy-in-common, and also procured the buyer, a private investor.

“We were able to generate tremendous interest from local, national and even international buyers before settling on a 1031 Exchange buyer,” said Berger. He added that his team secured “aggressive pricing for our client,” while providing “an opportunity for the buyer to diversify their portfolio on a trophy asset.”

Situated on 2.7 acres at 966 S. Springfield Ave., the property was fully-renovated in 2003. It’s triple net leased to LVMH, which has invested significant capital over the course of its 20-year occupancy.

It is rumored that the singer is in the midst of a deal with LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton, the parent company of Dior, Givenchy and Fendi. If true this will make ‘Anti’ singer the first female designer of color at the world’s largest luxury conglomerate.

Since breaking into the industry, Rihanna has found chart topping success as an entertainer, and has transformed the makeup world with Fenty beauty. Now it’s time for the businesswoman to conquer the fashion world.

Neither Rihanna nor LVMH have commented on the potential merger.

The artist is not the first celebrity to venture into the fashion industry, Victoria Beckham and Mary- Kate and Ashley Olsen left behind their careers and found success as designers. The fashion industry is starting to move on from their lack of diversity with designers such as Virgil and Demna Gvasalia holding key positions at major fashion houses. It makes sense that LVMH would want the help of someone as cool and confident as Rihanna.

No details have been given on how the brand will be structured or even what the name will be. One thing that’s for certain is that Rihanna’s first show will be an over the top fashion experience that we will love.

Rihanna has always been a leader with her courageous style, now she will have a chance and shape the fashionistas of the future.

Rihanna set to become LVMH's first black female designer – reports - The Guardian,"Fri, 18 Jan 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9tdXNpYy8yMDE5L2phbi8xOC9yaWhhbm5hLXNldC10by1iZWNvbWUtbHZtaHMtZmlyc3QtYmxhY2stZmVtYWxlLWRlc2lnbmVyLXJlcG9ydHPSAW1odHRwczovL2FtcC50aGVndWFyZGlhbi5jb20vbXVzaWMvMjAxOS9qYW4vMTgvcmloYW5uYS1zZXQtdG8tYmVjb21lLWx2bWhzLWZpcnN0LWJsYWNrLWZlbWFsZS1kZXNpZ25lci1yZXBvcnRz?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Rihanna is reportedly about to make history as the first black female to head up a fashion brand at the world’s largest luxury conglomerate, LVMH.

It would be the first new fashion house the group, which owns Christian Dior, Louis Vuitton and Givenchy, has launched since Christian Lacroix in 1987.

The new brand is expected to take the singer’s last name, Fenty, which she uses for her make-up and lingerie businesses. Speculation was fuelled this week when she stepped out in an oversized pair of sunglasses with the brand’s logo visible on the side.

Rihanna has filed a lawsuit against her father, Ronald Fenty, in a dispute over the use of the Fenty name by their respective companies. The lawsuit stated he “egregiously and fraudulently misrepresented to third parties and the public that their company … is affiliated with Rihanna”. Rihanna is asking for a legal injunction on the use of the Fenty name, as well as unspecified damages.

The deal would be a shrewd business move for LVMH, which has been courting the singer for some time. While she worked on a capsule collection of sunglasses in 2015 for LVMH’s Dior, she collaborated with Puma in 2016, generating $1bn in sales for the sportswear brand.

In 2017, LVMH lured her back to collaborate on her make-up line, Fenty Beauty. The range, which was praised for encompassing a wide range of skin tones, reportedly made $100m in sales within 40 days and was named as one of Time Magazine’s 25 best inventions that year.

Her lingerie line, Savage x Fenty, which launched in May 2017, has enjoyed huge success and acclaim for its inclusivity. Pitched as the antidote to existing underwear brands such as Victoria’s Secret, which has been accused of being culturally out of touch and objectifying women, the TechStyle Fashion Group-backed brand includes sizes ranging from from XS to 3XL and features plus-size models in its campaigns.

“I accept all of the bodies,” Rihanna told US Vogue last year. “I’m not built like a Victoria’s Secret girl, and I still feel very beautiful and confident in my lingerie.” TechStyle’s CEO told the trade publication WWD at the time that he chose Rihanna because she was “the right partner to bring instant credibility and exposure” to the brand.

While the details of her new fashion brand remain under wraps, its concept is a reflection of the state of play in the fashion industry. Established and heritage brands are increasingly teaming up with high-profile celebrities such as Rihanna – who has 67 million Instagram followers – to work on collaborations and endorse products thanks to the influence they hold over the lucrative “Generation Z” consumer market.

The Kardashian family are another prolific example of this and have been tapped by several fashion houses, including Calvin Klein, all eager to attract their combined 508.7 million social media followers.

It would also signal a further evolution in what it takes to head up a fashion house in the 21st century. Like Virgil Abloh, who was appointed as the artistic director of LVMH’s flagship brand Louis Vuitton last year, Rihanna has no formal fashion training. Abloh’s first Vuitton collection is selling 30% faster than the much-hyped collaboration with Supreme from 2017.

Abloh’s mentor Kanye West is another example of a successful musician-to-designer transition. Aside from his claims that his clothing brand Yeezy “will become the biggest apparel company in human history”, it was reported last year that his brand had received a $1.5bn valuation.

The launch of Rihanna’s brand could go some way to answering calls for more diversity among fashion’s leaders. Last year, she became the first black woman to be on the September cover, traditionally the largest and most important edition of the magazine, of British Vogue.

“A fearless music-industry icon and businesswoman, when it comes to that potent mix of fashion and celebrity, nobody does it quite like her,” said the editor-in-chief, Edward Enninful, of Rihanna.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9997836947441101}",neutral,0.9997836947441101,0
Rihanna and LVMH are reportedly teaming up on a luxury fashion brand - Vox.com,"Fri, 18 Jan 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZveC5jb20vdGhlLWdvb2RzLzIwMTkvMS8xOC8xODE4ODg2NC9yaWhhbm5hLWZhc2hpb24tbHZtaC1mZW50eS1zYXZhZ2UtYmVhdXR5LXJpdmVyLWlzbGFuZNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Rumors swirled this week that Rihanna was launching her own line of sunglasses after she was spotted in a pair of shades bearing the Fenty logo. The pop star has introduced both a lingerie line and a makeup range under the Fenty name (her own surname) over the past two years.

But reports in WWD and the New York Times suggest that Rihanna has her sights on a venture far more ambitious than sunglasses. The singer-turned-entrepreneur will reportedly team up with luxury fashion conglomerate LVMH to start her own high-end fashion brand.

If the reports are true, Rihanna stands to become the first black woman designer at LVMH. From Kanye West to Jessica Simpson — fashion is rife with rappers, singers, actors, and reality stars with their own lines at department stores and the like. But having a luxury fashion house in one’s honor has been off limits to most celebrities. Rihanna would be the rare celebrity to break this barrier in the high-fashion world.

Rihanna’s rise in the industry began with her 2013 clothing collection for the British brand River Island. But the success of her more recent undertakings, Fenty Beauty and lingerie line Savage x Fenty, has made Rihanna one of the brightest stars in an industry contending with Instagram influencers, the success of “street” brands, and one PR scandal after another. In Rihanna, LVMH has found a woman of color with influence, street cred, and a love for inclusion; she represents the way forward for fashion.

Rihanna has put in the work

To those unfamiliar with her trajectory in the industry, Rihanna might seem like an overnight success story. In 2017, she launched the makeup brand Fenty Beauty, named one of Time’s 25 best inventions that year.

The makeup brand’s 40-shade foundation range appealed to Rihanna fans of all races, but the women of color traditionally overlooked by the cosmetics industry flocked to the brand. The month after its launch, Fenty Beauty’s sales quintupled the sales of Kylie Cosmetics, WWD reported. Savage x Fenty, the lingerie line she launched in 2018, also sold well while making inclusion a priority. The underwear comes in a range of “nude” shades and in some plus sizes.

But even before these groundbreaking brands debuted, Rihanna became a certified fashion influencer. She won the 2014 fashion icon of the year award from the Council of Fashion Designers of America. That year, she also partnered with Puma on a sportswear line. As creative director, she put on dazzling fashion shows for the athletic company and her influence as a pop star led to the shoes and slides she designed selling out.

The next year, 2015, Rihanna became the first black brand ambassador for Dior’s Secret Garden perfume. And in 2012, long before her lingerie brand was a thought, Rihanna sang at the Victoria’s Secret Fashion Show. She’d previously performed at a 2008 Gucci fundraiser.

But the 2013 debut of her River Island collection at London Fashion Week was perhaps the first concrete sign she was serious about carving out a name for herself in fashion. She called the collaboration a dream come true.

“I have wanted to design my own collection for a long time and to present my collection for River Island alongside all of the other great design talent at LFW is a real privilege,” she said.

How the reported LVMH partnership came to be

If the River Island debut was a dream come true for Rihanna, having her own luxury fashion house may have been beyond her wildest dreams six years ago. But a partnership between the singer and LVMH, the world’s largest luxury fashion conglomerate, according to the Times, makes sense.

Rihanna collaborated with LVMH on Fenty Beauty through the conglomerate’s Kendo division. The success of the beauty line reportedly spurred LVMH’s CEO Bernard Arnault to consider even loftier ventures for the superstar. Forming a new brand marks a departure for LVMH, its first since the debut of Christian Lacroix in 1987, the Times reported. But Rihanna, apparently, was worth the risk.

She not only has nearly 70 million Instagram followers and a series of Top 10 hits, Rihanna has also used her brands to let the public know that both inclusion and representation matter to her. In addition, Rihanna has sent the message that she’s fully involved with her brands rather than just a detached celebrity lending her name to a business venture.

When Fenty Beauty debuted, Rihanna told Time: “I have 100 percent involvement in this process, which is what makes this so special and very fun. I have so much creative freedom from products to packaging, and that’s really the only way this brand will stay true to my vision for it.”

That vision, which has endeared Rihanna to even non-music fans, is why LVMH is likely counting on her luxury fashion brand being just as successful as her other enterprises.

With Virgil Abloh’s Off-White, Burlon’s own label County of Milan, Palm Angels, Heron Preston’s eponymous collection, Alanui, A Plan Application, Ben Taverniti Unravel Project, and formerly Hood by Air (which was part of the New Guards Group before founder Shayne Oliver put the label on an indefinite hold) under its umbrella, and LVMH increasingly looking to tap into millennial-centric touch-points to help boost its bottom line, New Guards Group could prove a fitting acquisition target.

The Milan-based New Guard Group, which owns varying stakes in the aforementioned brands, describes itself “as an accelerator of innovative fashion brands,” according to its LinkedIn page, noting that “while each brand’s creative process and identity is fiercely preserved, the group leverages synergies and productivities of its shared services.” Those “shared services” see its labels largely working under the same roof in the New Guards Group’s 10,000+ square foot atelier in Milan.

What – exactly – are those synergies? “It’s not just clothes,” Burlon revealed in an interview with BoF. “We all know each other and there’s support for each other. It’s like a new movement.” A movement that has “music behind it … a party scene. And we all kind of related one to each other,” he subsequently shared with Complex. “We kind of talk the same language. We’re not part of the system.”

A movement in modern streetwear would be arguably rather incomplete with Virgil Abloh, the Louis Vuitton menswear director whose label Off-White is the most well-known of the Group’s roster of brands. As noted by Highsnobiety, Abloh teamed up with Burlon after he moved on from first label, Pyrex: “Virgil would later shut the brand down, and link with New Guards Group to start Off-White.” And it is under the watch of the Group that Off-White has blossomed.

According to Vogue’s Amy Verner, “Not even 48 hours after Virgil Abloh staged his [Spring/Summer 2018] men’s collection as a vast nighttime performance enhanced by artist Jenny Holzer projecting queasy, crisis poetry on the exterior of the Pitti Palace, the walk-through of the [2018] Resort offering took place at his Milan showroom.”

“This may sound anticlimactic,” she wrote, “and yet it was here that the founders of New Guards Group first took a leap of faith on a guy selling t-shirts that profoundly resonated with plugged-in kids (the Kanye connection didn’t hurt) and agreed to produce and distribute his higher-end fashion label.”

Meanwhile, LVMH announced early this month that it has taken a minority stake in Gabriela Hearst, the 4-year old New York-based womenswear brand, by way of its LVMH Luxury Ventures, the same startup-focused fund that partnered with sneaker consignment site Stadium Goods early last year.

It is unclear as of now such a potential deal between LVMH and the New Guards Group would pan out. So, stay tuned.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999957084655762}",neutral,0.9999957084655762,0

Rihanna Might Be Launching a Luxury Line With LVMH (WWD)

Sources are saying that Rihanna is in talks with LVMH to launch a luxury line. The collection could possibly “span ready-to-wear, leather goods, and accessories.” As if that weren’t enough, one source said that the line could drop as early as this year, to coincide with a new album. So far, neither Rihanna nor LVMH has commented on the rumors. Should either party be reading this: Please, please make this happen. The world would like for this to happen so very much.

Raf Simons’ Shows His First Collection Since Leaving Calvin Klein

Remember Raf Simons’ first collection for Calvin Klein? He put images of Brooke Sheilds in the ’80s on the jeans, and invited the actress to sit front row at the show. Well, Simons may have just left his role at Klein, but he seems to have taken that particular design/invitation trick with him. The designer showed the latest collection, Fall 2019, of his eponymous menswear label on Wednesday in Paris. Images of Laura Dern in Blue Velvet adorned several pieces, and Dern herself sat in the front row.

The collection also featured oversized shoulders — a trend in womenswear, but less so among men’s collections so far — and ankle-length coats. It was a surprisingly vibrant outing as well, with several pieces shown in bold jewel tones.

Hearst has just hired Randi Peck as its executive director of talent. She was previously Interview‘s entertainment director. She will start her new position January 30.

Chanel Confirms Date and Location for Cruise Show (British Vogue)

Chanel will hold a show for its Cruise 2019 collection on May 3. Though the house usually uses its Cruise shows as an excuse to travel, the show will be in Paris at its usual location, the Grand Palais. As British Vogue notes, this is the “exact date and location of last year’s cruise show.”

Bloomingdale’s Unveils New Beauty Floor

Blommingdale’s has revamped its beauty floor, which is now open. Fans will find a series of new “curated concepts” in the space, including a fragrance hall, a “wellchemist” section for clean beauty brands and skincare, and a “glowhaus” — a milennial-minded station for beauty products under $100. There are also a bevy of customization opportunities, a Clarins spa, and a nail and hair bar that is set to open this spring.

Resilient Asian business drives record sales and earnings for LVMH - Financial Times,"Tue, 29 Jan 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZ0LmNvbS9jb250ZW50L2U2MmYzZTEyLTIzZTUtMTFlOS1iMzI5LWM3ZTZjZWI1ZmZkZtIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Print this page

Roula Khalaf, Editor of the FT, selects her favourite stories in this weekly newsletter.

French luxury goods group LVMH on Tuesday announced record sales and profits for 2018, and said that its fast-growing Asia business had yet to be affected by the Chinese economic slowdown or the incipient US-China trade war .

Net profit for the year rose 18 per cent to €6.35bn, from €5.36bn in 2017, on sales that rose 10 per cent to €46.83bn. The results were roughly in line with analysts’ forecasts.

Bernard Arnault, chairman and chief executive, said LVMH expected its brands and companies, which include Louis Vuitton, Christian Dior and Moët & Chandon champagne, to deliver continued progress in 2019 in spite of “an environment that remains uncertain at the start of the year”.

Sales growth was steady in all regions in the fourth quarter except the US — similar to the performance earlier in the year, according to Jean-Jacques Guiony, finance director.

Organic growth in Asia, excluding Japan, was 15 per cent compared with last year. Sales in Europe were up 7 per cent on the same measure, while in the US they climbed 8 per cent.

“We see no particular sign of a slowdown in the China market,” he said, although purchases by Chinese customers had shifted slightly to the mainland from Hong Kong and other east Asian markets, perhaps because of a weaker renminbi. “The market sees the glass as half empty. We see it as half full.”

Luxury goods companies and other exporters dependent on sales to China are bracing for the impact of the country’s economic slowdown and for possible fallout from any worsening of the US-China trade conflict.

In recent days, companies including US chipmaker Nvidia and Caterpillar, which sells earthmoving equipment, have blamed China’s slowing growth for disappointing profit predictions.

Mr Guiony said luxury goods consumers tended to be affected more by sudden shocks than by gradual changes in economic conditions. “If there was to be real trade war between the US and China — and we’re not there yet — that would have an effect,” he said.

The company also performed well in Europe, Mr Guiony said. Although LVMH had to close early on several Saturdays because of the gilets jaunes protests in France, many customers had switched to Sunday shopping and there was no obvious impact on LVMH’s numbers in the latest quarter.

LVMH said it was stockpiling champagne and cognac in the UK in case of severe disruption from a “no-deal” Brexit.

“We’ve added four months of stock in the UK,” said Philippe Schaus, head of Moët Hennessy, the wines and spirits part of the group.

Profit from recurring operations in fashion and leather goods, the core of LVMH’s business, rose 21 per cent last year, accounting for €5.94bn of the total. The highest growth in profit from recurring operations came from watches and jewellery, at 37 per cent, and the slowest from wines and spirits, at 5 per cent.

The company said it planned to lift the total dividend by 20 per cent for the year to €6.","{'label': 'Negative', 'score': 0.54156094789505}",negative,0.54156094789505,-1

Rihanna is expanding her fashion empire.

The Fenty Beauty mogul is said to be partnering with the world’s largest luxury group, LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, to launch her own luxury house.

Multiple sources tell WWD that the singer has been in secret discussions with LVMH for the project. This would mark the first fashion brand that CEO Bernard Arnault has launched from scratch since Christian Lacroix in 1987.

LVMH reportedly started assembling a team about six months ago in Paris, including some employees from Louis Vuitton and Celine, to work on the launch alongside Rihanna and some of her key associates. The project is being overseen by Sidney Toledano, chairman and chief executive officer of LVMH Fashion Group, which includes Givenchy, Celine, Kenzo, and Marc Jacobs.

Earlier this week, Rihanna stepped out in Manhattan wearing gold shades with her “Fenty” brand name spelled out across the temples. Sources say she was test driving a prototype from the upcoming LVMH-backed line.

Rihanna is currently creative director of Puma, where she launched her activewear brand Fenty by Puma. She also has her own successful Fenty Beauty line, which reportedly made $100 million in sales in its first 40 days on the market, as well as a lingerie line.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9998290538787842}",neutral,0.9998290538787842,0

Saturday's shows are in flux with ""yellow vest"" protests scheduled for January 19

Men's fashion week in Paris has no shortage of storylines. It's set to be a victory lap for the fast-growing luxury menswear market as well as Virgil Abloh's Louis Vuitton, only days after Timothée Chalamet's bedazzled harness scored rare points for men's fashion on the Golden Globes red carpet. The week will also play host to Kris Van Assche's first collection for Berluti, Waight Keller's return to standalone displays for Givenchy men's after a shift to co-ed shows in 2017, and Raf Simons' first solo outing since his ouster from Calvin Klein. But the biggest event of the week is sure to be Hedi Slimane's first-ever men's show for Celine, a chance for him to make a statement at the brand that's likely to be (relatively) free of comparisons to Phoebe Philo. Lurking in the background are the ""yellow vest"" protestors, whose regular Saturday demonstrations have cut sharply into luxury sales and forced Kim Jones' Dior Men, another highlight of the week, to move its show.

The Bottom Line: The rapid growth of luxury menswear has helped to reverse the trend toward co-ed shows. If this week's publicity bomb fuels even hotter sales, expect more major brands to follow in the footsteps of Celine and Givenchy and stage standalone displays.

Paris to Underscore LVMH's Menswear Reboot

Four of the LVMH brands showing at the Paris men's shows installed new designers last year: Louis Vuitton, Dior, Celine and Berluti

A fifth, Givenchy, will show menswear separately for the first time under Clare Waight Keller

Menswear comprises less than one-quarter of the $1.7 trillion global apparel market, but is growing faster than womenswear

You may have noticed a common thread linking many of the must-see shows at the upcoming Paris menswear week: they are almost all being staged by LVMH brands. The conglomerate has made bold moves to reboot its menswear strategy to take advantage of momentum in the menswear market , from installing Virgil Abloh at Vuitton, Kim Jones at Dior and Kris Van Assche at Berluti to clearing a path for Slimane to launch menswear at Celine. Many of these changes are too new to have had a meaningful impact on sales yet (the first Abloh-designed pieces for sale stateside only arrived at New York's Chrome Hearts last week). But LVMH now has a strong lineup of designers in place, and a diverse offerings to suit a range of tastes, at a time when millennial men are buying more fashion than ever before.

The Bottom Line: Kering's Kering's Gucci and Balenciaga may have got ahead of the competition in the race for millennial spending, but they have both opted for co-ed shows on the men's side of the sector, giving LVMH an opening for potential breakout success.

The End of the Road for Sears?

Liquidators and current Sears owner Eddie Lampert will bid for Sears in a bankruptcy auction Monday

Lampert would keep about half of the existing Sears and Kmart locations open; otherwise liquidation would begin quickly

Sears and Kmart sold $4.3 billion in apparel and soft home goods in 2017

Sick of reading about Virgil, Hedi and Raf? Here’s a bit of counter-programming from the other end of the fashion spectrum: the fate of Sears will be decided on Monday . It’s likely been a long time since many BoF readers thought about the long-suffering department store chain, let alone set foot in one. But it’s worth remembering that Sears’ annual apparel sales are on par with what Burberry or Prada does in a year. Aside from Lands’ End, which has its partisans, few will mourn the loss of Sears’ fashion selection. Most of the clothes sold there are made by faceless brands whose customers will migrate to J.C. Penney, T.J. Maxx and other discount chains without a second though. In fact, some mall landlords say they’d prefer Sears close its doors rather than linger on, believing they can find better anchor tenants.

The Bottom Line: The pace of retail bankruptcies has slowed, but brands as diverse as Charlotte Russe, J.Crew, J.C. Penney and Neiman Marcus are struggling with middling sales and/or large debt loads.

Last week's newsletter sparked some debate on BoF's social media feeds about fashion's approach to awards shows. Among the comments:

""The red carpet as a place to make a political statement is dead. An opportunity wasted both by the hosts as well as the stars. After last year's brouhaha it was back to ... 'oh who are you wearing?' Blah."" @psprivateedition

""Can it be just an awards ceremony? Can we keep politics out of this way at least? Can we just celebrate beautiful gowns, dazzling performances and great movies? For once in a year just take a deep breath and relax."" @riinaalice

Rihanna Has Secretly Been Developing a Luxury Fashion Line - W Magazine,"Thu, 17 Jan 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndtYWdhemluZS5jb20vc3RvcnkvcmloYW5uYS1sdm1oLXNlY3JldC1mYXNoaW9uLWx1eHVyeS1saW5l0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"In addition to making a $3.2 billion expansion into hotels, LVMH—the largest luxury group in the world, which controls Celine, Dior, Louis Vuitton, and Givenchy (to name a few)—has also apparently been worming its way into a quite different universe: that of Rihanna and her increasingly vast Fenty empire.

According to a report that WWD shared exclusively on Thursday morning, LVMH has secretly been in talks with Rihanna to launch a luxury house under her name. (The news comes courtesy of “multiple sources”; LVMH has so far declined to comment, and none have hinted at any potential launch date.)

If they do decide to proceed, WWD reports, Rihanna will have already made fashion history along the lines of one of the industry’s historic heavyweights: Christian Lacroix, which was the last major brand for LVMH to launch from scratch while under the leadership of Bernard Arnault, back in 1987. Plus, there’s the fact that Rihanna would be the only woman of color to helm a major fashion brand at LVMH—another long-awaited step forward for the conglomerate (and the industry at large); the appointment of Virgil Abloh to menswear director of Louis Vuitton last March marked one of the only times that a black designer has ever been appointed to helm a heritage fashion house.

LVMH already owns Fenty Beauty by Rihanna, meaning Rihanna already knows Arnault—who’s no small acquaintance to have made. The conglomerate’s 69-year-old CEO has an estimated net worth of $72 billion, which currently puts him at number four on Forbes‘s list of billionaires—one slot above Mark Zuckerberg.) Rihanna has also worked with his daughter Delphine Arnault in continuing to support young designers through the LVMH Prize.

The conglomerate has reportedly already begun assembling a team so far made up of employees from Celine and Louis Vuitton—and Rihanna might have already begun publicly hinting at their joint venture herself. Of course, this being Rihanna—a master accessorizer—that hint came courtesy of a simple pair of sunglasses that she wore on Tuesday, whose Fenty logo immediately prompted speculation as to her next venture. If they’re really an indicator of what’s to come, well, stay tuned for something enormous and shiny. (Plus that elusive upcoming top-secret album.)

Because my passion was watches. And because of that I said, ‘Let’s go to a watch brand and then they will free me from my work! That is, if they employ me.’ And they did.

Alister & Paine: How do you set yourself apart from other luxury watch brands, especially having three watch brands under one company umbrella?

Jean-Claude: We don’t set ourselves apart. Our brand each have their own DNA. Each of our brands have their own message, own price segment, each of our brands have their own customers, and because of this each one is different. And when each one is different you have no problem to master all the three. If they would be similar, it would be difficult. This sponsorship, do I give it to him or him? I would have to hesitate. If one brand has a message, say, ‘legends never die’, then it’s easy when you have to choose sponsoring. You’re going to go with classic car because classic cars never die.

If every message is clear, you can master every brand easily. So this is how we do it. If the brands were not so different, then it would be headache.

Alister & Paine: What is the DNA of Hublot?

Jean-Claude: It’s the worst of all. Disruption! Destroy all that exists in order to rebuild a new proposition. Big Bang. What is Big Bang?! It is the most destructive explosion. 10 billion times stronger than nuclear bomb. But, after the big bang was the creation of the planets. So it is at the same time an extraordinary creative act but also a destructive act. And this is why I name our watch Big Bang, because that is what the watch is doing. It destroys a certain classic behavior, it destroys a certain tradition, but it builds a new proposition.

That is what Hublot is. Hublot is the disruptive leading brand in luxury.

Alister & Paine: Tell me about the construction space we are in now.

Jean-Claude: The new home of Hublot! The space is enormous, fantastic, it is luxury. Luxury it means space. Luxury it means time. We are becoming a player of the city. Now suddenly we play in the city. We are somebody in the city. This is just extraordinary. I never believed we would get a space like that. Never. In my best dreams I never dreamt so much. My dreams are far below what we achieve, which is the beauty.

Alister & Paine: Do you have a favorite timepiece?

Jean-Claude: I have one. I don’t have it on today! Today, I forgot my watch at home. I swear on my kids I forgot my watch at home so I said to the shop ‘Can you lend me one?’. So I’m wearing a watch which doesn’t belong to me. Which is very rare, it’s very very very unusual that I wear a watch that doesn’t belong to me. My favorite is Big Bang, from 2005, which I have made for me and I said to me and to my people that’s the future of Hublot. This watch. And it’s a bigger bang, all black tourbillion, and I made it for me but also to show everyone where Hublot should go. It was a kind of a reference and that’s the watch I love. It brought me luck, it brought me success, and I forgot it at home.

I forgot the watch because I came for a Tag Heuer event, and when I come for a Tag Heuer event I try to respect my people and they don’t like me coming to Tag Heuer event with Hublot on my wrist. So because of respect I didn’t take the Hublot. And I forgot when I left home I said ‘SHIT I also have a Hublot event!’ So it happened that I only traveled with one watch.

Alister & Paine: Haha! Happens to everyone. Who is the typical Hublot customer that you are designing for?

Jean-Claude: It’s me. Number one, because I am one of the hundred most important Patek Philippe collectors in the world. I have a very significant collection. We have a lot of milestones and unique pieces. Being a Patek Philippe collector…from time to time you have a desire to wear something that connects you also to the future. If you are constantly connected to the past, it’s okay, it gives you confidence and you understand it and know how the past is. But from time to time you need to connect also to the future.

And who connects me to the future? Big Bang. Because it has partly the past, but it has also the future. And with all of classic collection I only have the past. So I say I need a watch that has all the elements of tradition but sufficient mobility to be worn in the today’s world, in the today’s way of living. And if I want to go diving why should I take my watch off my wrist? So I’m the reference as a customer. Who is the reference for ladies? My wife. I have chosen my wife and myself as the references. I ask always my wife what to do for ladies watches and I ask myself for men’s. Of course Ricardo Guadalupe is the CEO of Hublot now, and he is slowly taking over more in terms of reference.

Alister & Paine: What’s the best advice you’ve received to date?

Jean-Claude: To never believe that the success is yours. The success is the result of the hard work of a team. And if you are the boss, please give the success to the team. You should only indulge the failures because you are the boss. The success should be given back and the failures worn on your shoulders. That’s why you are the boss. Because your shoulders are large and your shoulders can carry all the failures. As soon as you have a success please give it to the team.

Alister & Paine: Who told you that?

Jean-Claude: My first boss, Fritz Ammann. He gave me that advice in December 1979. That’s the advice of a strong man. Strong man gives success to others and endures failure. WEAK man gives the failures to others. ‘Ah, he’s responsible, it’s his fault!’ And then the success they take for themselves. So I don’t want to be weak, I want to be strong, and this lesson I never forgot.

Alister & Paine: How about some advice for aspiring budding entrepreneur?

Jean-Claude: Never forget to believe and to think that today, when you wake up at 4am or 3am (that’s the first rule, never get up after 4am), always say ‘Today, its 4:00am, the 14th of October, today will be better than yesterday.’ But! Tomorrow will be even better than today. If you don’t have this vision, how can you get to tomorrow? And how can you even get up? You can get up because you say ‘WOW! Today better than yesterday.’ And then you can walk through today because you know tomorrow can be even better. That’s my only advice.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9965260624885559}",neutral,0.9965260624885559,0

Vuitton increased 8% in 2018, amid a strong year for Bulgari, the company said Tuesday.

Jewelry-and-watch revenue rose to EUR 4.12 billion ($4.71

In the fourth quarter, revenue from jewelry and watches grew

8% to EUR 1.1 billion ($1.26 billion).

LVMH’s group revenue for 2018 increased 10% to a record EUR 46.83

billion ($53.52 billion), with double-digit growth in comparable-store sales across

all departments except wines and spirits. Net profit jumped 21% to EUR 10

results were announced.

Arnault controls about half of LVMH through a family holding company, Groupe Arnault SE.

Bernard Arnault, the world’s fourth-richest person, added US$4.3 billion to his fortune on Wednesday as Chinese consumers’ growing appetite for handbags and Hennessy Cognac boosted results at LVMH.

His wealth has surged US$8.3 billion since the start of the year and now stands at US$76.9 billion, putting him within striking distance of Berkshire Hathaway chairman Warren Buffett, who is ranked third on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index with $84.8 billion. Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, the world’s richest person, added US$6.1 billion to his net worth on Wednesday, while No 2 Bill Gates, the Microsoft co-founder, gained US$889.4 million.

LVMH’s stake in luxury fashion house Christian Dior SE comprises most of Arnault’s fortune. He moved into luxury goods in 1984, taking over the bankrupt textile group that owned Christian Dior. He sold the company’s other businesses and used the proceeds to buy a controlling stake in LVMH. Last month, the company agreed to acquire high-end hotel operator Belmond in a deal that values the owner of New York’s ‘21’ Club at US$2.6 billion.

Arnault has never ranked higher than fourth on the Bloomberg wealth ranking, which could see more of a shake-up near the top on Thursday. Shares in Mark Zuckerberg’s Facebook surged 12 per cent in extended trading at 5.25pm, in New York, after the company posted sales and profit that smashed estimates. Zuckerberg, the world’s seventh-richest person, is poised to jump to No 5, leapfrogging Spain’s Amancio Ortega and Mexico’s Carlos Slim.

What is driving the change within LVMH’s perfume and cosmetics division to present as a group in travel retail rather as separate brands?

It’s a relatively new project, which began at the start of the year. We participated as a group at the TFWA Asia Pacific show in Singapore, but this was part of a regional strategy and Cannes was the first time we appeared in a more united way in front of the whole industry.

There are different factors driving this change. LVMH is very brand driven organised by divisions. The perfume & cosmetics department had no head two to three years ago and the CEOs of the brands were reporting into several different heads of divisions. It wasn’t really a straightforward structure. Christopher de Lapuente, who is also CEO of Sephora, was appointed as the head and he wondered if each brand should fight for itself by developing its own sales and distribution strategy or should we act as a group.

We looked at the wine and spirits division, which already had a multi-brand setup – at least in terms of markets. The conclusion was that we needed to develop the right environment to suit our DNA, philosophy and structural expectations and find our own way.

Lapuente believed that we were losing ground and the other groups were growing faster [with retailers]. This was especially true for travel retail, while domestic markets are organised slightly differently. He appointed Gianluca Toniolo in 2017, He appointed Gianluca Toniolo in 2017, who is the Global Travel Retail Managing Director.

There have been no factual results as [of] yet, only the TFWA show presence in Cannes, except some regions have had steps forward with a group approach to negotiations and team building. We are really at the early stages.

It is key that we make sure the brands remain strong and independent. We don’t want to pull down one brand to have a common approach to everything, so each brand has its own identity and strategy. What we can do is make sure everyone has the same managed environment for the market and potential partnerships, after that it’s up to each brand to decide how they want to grow and have the means to do it. I see the role of the structure as an accelerator to the business. Currently, the brands don’t have all the skill levels, competencies, knowledge and access to the same data support.

So, to steer this you plan to appoint four regional travel retail managing directors?

The regional teams are reporting into me but still with a dotted line to the brands. They need to have guidelines in terms of strategy, brand and product development. The travel retail structure is more to implement this in the travel retail distribution channel. Therefore, the team has a double reporting system and I’m validating everything in terms of the team, space and location.

We have four regions – the Americas, Europe, the Middle East and Asia. I’m heading [up] Asia and we have a managing director for the Americas Julien Ottenwaelter [who was appointed in February 2018 alongside the launch of the structure] and Valerie Bonte Hospital for Europe, who joined in November 2018.

What are your key ambitions under this new structure and can you quantify how it will lift your position in travel retail?

Our brand portfolio [acting without Dior and Bvlgari] is very dominant in make-up and fragrances. In make-up, we have a point of difference compared to the other groups, as the portfolio ranges from high-end brands to independent labels so we are covering all aspects of the category. We have strong skincare brands, but as a group, we are not as strong as some other companies. For fragrances, we have solid specifities but in terms of the number of brands we are not comparable to other houses.

We want to be the number one make-up group and appear as the number three perfume and cosmetics company in the industry, to counterbalance the other beauty houses.

How important is travel retail to the beauty division and how are you looking to grow this part of the business?

We have some mature brands, such as Guerlain, Kenzo and Givenchy, and then brands that are new to travel retail distribution, such as Fresh, Benefit and Make Up Forever, and I’m not even covering [the potential for] Acqua di Parma and Maison Francis Kurkdjian.

I don’t know if there is a golden rule, but we need to find the right balance between travel retail and domestic markets but I would say between 20% and 25% of the global like-for-like environment would be a healthy balance. It really depends from one brand to the next. For example, Fresh is developed in Asia and the US but not in Europe so you can’t compare the travel retail weight for this label with say Givenchy and Guerlain, which are represented globally, whether in domestic or travel retail.

Brands like Fenty Beauty by Rihanna, which is just over a year old, does not have a position in travel retail as yet but we are happy that it is considering entry. It is performing very well as an independent label that talks to Millennials. The Sephora Collection is another brand under consideration to increase the basket size of shoppers.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999188184738159}",neutral,0.9999188184738159,0
Will Rihanna’s Rumored Fashion Label With LVMH Take Off? - Footwear News,"Thu, 17 Jan 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vZm9vdHdlYXJuZXdzLmNvbS9mYXNoaW9uL2Rlc2lnbmVycy9yaWhhbm5hLWx2bWgtbHV4dXJ5LWZhc2hpb24tYnJhbmQtMTIwMjczMTY1NC_SAVxodHRwczovL2Zvb3R3ZWFybmV3cy5jb20vZmFzaGlvbi9kZXNpZ25lcnMvcmloYW5uYS1sdm1oLWx1eHVyeS1mYXNoaW9uLWJyYW5kLTEyMDI3MzE2NTQvYW1wLw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"In arguably her biggest power move yet, Rihanna is reportedly in talks with LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, parent company to Christian Dior, Fendi and Givenchy, to launch a fashion house under her own name, according to FN’s sister publication, WWD.

If confirmed, it would become the first fashion brand launched from inception by industry magnate Bernard Arnault since Christian Lacroix in 1987, and Rihanna would own the title as the first female designer of color at what is widely considered the largest luxury group in the world.

Citing multiple sources, WWD added that LVMH has already handpicked a number of employees from brands like Louis Vuitton and Celine to work on the project with Rihanna and some of her top associates. (Details about the launch and its timing remain unknown.)

With news of a potential sartorial venture, the question of whether RiRi’s fashion house will achieve success has inevitably surfaced. Historically, it might appear that celebrity-backed luxury fashion labels don’t necessary live up to their A-list names — partly because their target markets might not be able to afford their products’ high price points.

According to a survey conducted by consumer intelligence research platform CivicScience, the income levels of Rihanna’s fans aged 18 to 34 skew lower, with 40 percent reporting incomes under $50,000. However, more than a quarter of respondents aged 35 years old and up take home $100,000 or more. (Filtered with data from the last three years, the survey interpreted results from 18 percent of respondents — those who shared that they were fans of the artist — out of a large sample size of approximately 32,500 respondents.)

“The currently robust designer business, especially in footwear and handbags, suggests that consumers will stretch for what they deem as luxury,” explained Beth Goldstein, executive director and industry analyst for accessories and footwear at The NPD Group Inc., who passed along the study. “And the meaning of luxury has changed — it can be tied to athleisure, streetwear, even more moderately priced startup brands because they are cool and functional. It’s more about the brand’s story than the price.”

Additionally, the popularity of Rihanna’s lingerie collection and cosmetics line are a positive indicator. Last September, the megastar debuted Savage x Fenty at New York Fashion Week to much acclaim, while her Fenty Beauty brand has amassed about 6.3 million Instagram followers and was recognized as one of Time magazine’s best inventions of 2017.

Rihanna has also earned her place among the industry’s finest. She was named Fashion Icon of the Year at the CFDA Awards in 2014, signed a deal with Puma later that year to become its creative director, crowned with the Shoe of the Year honor at the 2016 FN Achievement Awards and most recently made best-dressed headlines at the 2018 Met Gala.

The retailer’s parent company Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton (LVMH) announced it’s 2018 financial results this afternoon and posted a 10% year-on-year increase in revenue, thanks in part to a strong performance from DFS and the rapid growth of the Sephora brand.

The company said DFS’ position meant it is well placed to deal with fluctuations in currency and sales environments which could pose a challenge in the coming months. A reports released with the figures said: “DFS enters 2019 with confidence, while remaining vigilant to the key issues inherent in its business segment, such as currency fluctuations and potential changes in the sales environment.”

It continued: “The brand will expand its store network, particularly in Asia, and step up its digital initiatives to better serve travellers.”

LVMH, which trades actively as a retailer via the DFS brand, posted a recorded revenue of €46.8bn ($53.47bn) in in the last financial year, with 10% organic growth across the group in the fourth quarter.

Chinese shoppers boost trade

The Selective Retailing division, of which DFS is a part, achieved organic revenue growth of 6% year-on-year, and posted profits of €1.38bn which marks a 29% increase from 2017. Central to this were the company’s Sephora brand, which grew its market share with new outlets including one in Nanjing Road, Shanghai and it’s first branded store in Russia. DFS also posted good results thanks in part to the return of high-spending Chinese tourists to regions where it operates and good performance from its operations in Hong Kong and Macao and the new T Galleria outlets in Cambodia and Italy.

The report explained: “DFS progressed strongly thanks to a particularly good performance in Hong Kong and Macao. The recently opened Gallerias in Cambodia and Italy also grew rapidly. The closure of the loss-making Hong Kong Airport concessions at the end of 2017 contributed to the rebound in profitability. ”

It continued: “While major renovation work was completed in Sydney and Auckland, DFS continued to expand its presence in Macao with the opening of two boutiques devoted to beauty, bringing its store count to six in the city. A multi- brand fashion boutique designed to attract a millennial clientele was also inaugurated within the T Galleria City of Dreams. In Venice, the T Fondaco dei Tedeschi store turned in an excellent performance, boosted by a year- round program of events that make it an unrivaled venue for shopping and culture.

“The Siem Reap T Galleria in Cambodia also enjoyed strong momentum, with an offering that showcased the quality of local craftsmanship alongside luxury products. Starboard Cruise Services maintained its position as the leading retailer of high- end brands on board cruise ships by expanding its presence in Asia. It further enhanced the appeal of its stores while improving the quality of its product offerings and the experiences it offers its customers.”

A strong second half

The results come after a strong first half performance, which saw DFS experience a “rebound of profitability”. During the first six months of the year LVMH’s Selective Retailing business, of which DFS is a part, posted a 39% increase in revenue. Those early good results were put down to the strong performance of DFS in Hong Kong and Macao as well as impressive numbers from T Galleria in Cambodia, Italy and Sydney, the latter of which was reopened in April after a renovation. Growth was also boosted by the loss of the loss-making concessions contract at Hong Kong International Airport.

Speaking to DFNI earlier this month, LVMH Perfume & Cosmetics Travel Retail Managing Director Asia Pacific Andre Marzloff laid out the group’s current plan in the travel retail market, which involves presenting as a group rather than individual brands. He explained: “We want to be the number one make-up group and appear as the number three perfume and cosmetics company in the industry, to counterbalance the other beauty houses.”","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9999995231628418}",positive,0.9999995231628418,1
Toymaker sues Louis Vuitton for the right to keep making pooey purses - The Washington Post,"Mon, 07 Jan 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndhc2hpbmd0b25wb3N0LmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy8yMDE5LzAxLzA3L3RveW1ha2VyLXN1ZXMtbG91aXMtdnVpdHRvbi1yaWdodC1rZWVwLW1ha2luZy1wb29leS1wdXJzZXMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Toymaker MGA Entertainment has dragged French fashion house Louis Vuitton into a lawsuit that shows how cutting cultural commentary sometimes comes in surprising packages. Poop-shaped packages, to be exact. MGA is preemptively suing Louis Vuitton’s parent company, luxury stable LVMH, to ensure it can keep making “Poopsie Pooey Puitton,” its slime-filled plastic purse. According to documents filed last week in Los Angeles federal court, Louis Vuitton has claimed the toy’s design is a trademark infringement because its design marks and name are similar to those of Louis Vuitton handbags. MGA argues not only is the toy obviously not a Louis Vuitton knockoff, but it was meant to slime the lifestyle of the ultrawealthy consumers who buy the brand and thus should be protected as parody.

“Louis Vuitton and the LV Marks are associated with expensive, high-end, luxury products that evoke wealth and celebrity,” MGA’s counsel said in the complaint. “The use of the Pooey name and product in association with a product line of ‘magical unicorn poop’ is intended to criticize or comment upon the rich and famous, and the Louis Vuitton name, the LV marks, and on their conspicuous consumption.”

The toy is part of a line of Poopsie Surprise products, which include ingredients to make sparkly, magical “unicorn poop.” It was one of MGA’s most successful new toys last year, according to court documents.

In a surreal complaint (in which the word “poop” appears at least 25 times), MGA delivered a detailed analysis of why no reasonable consumer would ever confuse Pooey Puitton for an actual Louis Vuitton product.

“Louis Vuitton handbags are not poop-shaped, are not made out of hardened plastic, and do not depict three-dimensional cartoonish facial features such as elongated eyelashes and pouted lips.”

The complaint continues: “Louis Vuitton handbags are not manufactured with the sole intention of storing ingredients and materials for the creation of slime or ‘magical unicorn poop.’

""Louis Vuitton handbags are luxury items typically sold at price points significantly higher than that of the Pooey Product’s suggested retail price of $59.99.”

The complaint also argued Louis Vuitton “has a history of not respecting parody rights in the U.S. and filing vexatious lawsuits against such protected parody,” pointing to the brand’s 2014 lawsuit against a small Los Angeles handbag company that printed high-end handbag designs on canvas tote bags. The complaint also mentioned Louis Vuitton’s lawsuit against Haute Diggity Dog, a pet toy company, over a line of “Chewy Vuiton” chew toys shaped like purses and high heels. Louis Vuitton lost both cases.

""The furry little ‘Chewy Vuiton’ imitation, as something to be chewed by a dog, pokes fun at the elegance and expensiveness of a Louis Vuitton handbag, which must not be chewed by a dog,” Judge Paul V. Niemeyer wrote in his decision against LVMH.

MGA is no stranger to lawsuits, either, and is still tangled in a multiyear slog with Mattel over the designs of its Bratz dolls. Based in Van Nuys, Calif., MGA is known for hot toys such as L.O.L. Surprise! and Little Tikes products.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9986818432807922}",neutral,0.9986818432807922,0

This is the third investment by Luxury Ventures, managed by Julie Bercovy, after the ones in French beauty brand Universelle Buly and the sneaker specialist Stadium Goods, later bought by Farfetch. Kevin Carrigan, on the other hand, has left its vice-president position with Ralph Lauren, and the creative director position for the Lauren and Chaps brands. The stylist had worked with Calvin Klein for 18 years, and under its management, the CK line, the most popular and accessible line, that he had followed personally, had reached record sales. Then Raf Simons came and he dismantled the old team, Carrigan included, to substitute it with two people close to him. Now, with Simons leaving the brand, the natural thought is that Carrigan will return to Calvin Klein: in fact, the rumors all go in this direction.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999967813491821}",neutral,0.9999967813491821,0

The fashion house did not disclose revenue by brand but said Christian Dior had had an “excellent first full year”, while brands Givenchy, Loewe and Kenzo “progressed well”.

Celine made progress following designer Hedi Slimane’s first catwalk show in October, which “was a global success”.

Rihanna makes history as first woman of colour to design for LVMH - Lifestyle Asia Singapore,"Fri, 18 Jan 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxpZmVzdHlsZWFzaWEuY29tL3NnL3N0eWxlL2Zhc2hpb24vcmloYW5uYS1tYWtlcy1oaXN0b3J5LWFzLWZpcnN0LXdvbWFuLW9mLWNvbG91ci10by1kZXNpZ24tZm9yLWx2bWgv0gF1aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubGlmZXN0eWxlYXNpYS5jb20vc2cvc3R5bGUvZmFzaGlvbi9yaWhhbm5hLW1ha2VzLWhpc3RvcnktYXMtZmlyc3Qtd29tYW4tb2YtY29sb3VyLXRvLWRlc2lnbi1mb3ItbHZtaC9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Rihanna has become an unstoppable force beyond pop music. The launch of her groundbreakingly inclusive cosmetics line, Fenty Beauty, followed by an equally-revolutionary lingerie brand Savage x Fenty have brought the Barbadian native much success, and yet, her relentless pursuit for domination has led the star to make history. WWD has confirmed in an exclusive that Rihanna has signed a deal with LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton to launch a luxury brand bearing her name, making her the first woman of colour to design for the house. It also pioneers LVMH building a brand from scratch under its current CEO Bernard Arnault. This has not been executed by the conglomerate since it created Christian Lacroix in 1987.

Undisclosed sources have reported that moves are already underway to establish the brand, with team members from sister labels like Celine and Louis Vuitton imported to assist Rihanna in her next venture.

Though little is known about what her eponymous label could entail, there have been subtle hints. Rihanna was recently seen sporting a pair of bold sunglasses with “Fenty” emblazoned across the temples, perhaps a piece in the works for the brand.

Rihanna has always been a style icon for our times. Her style, an effortless blend of street and high luxury, constantly causes a stir, with many attempting to emulate her irreverence. With her innate capacity to set trends and garner global attention, LVMH’s choice to partner with the star is a highly strategic move to increase its stronghold on the luxury landscape while remaining current.

Rihanna and LVMH have yet to comment on the collaboration, though we expect official announcements to come soon.

Dior switches Paris catwalk date to avoid 'yellow vest' protests - Egypt Today,"Thu, 10 Jan 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVneXB0dG9kYXkuY29tL0FydGljbGUvNi82MzI3My9EaW9yLXN3aXRjaGVzLVBhcmlzLWNhdHdhbGstZGF0ZS10by1hdm9pZC15ZWxsb3ctdmVzdC1wcm90ZXN0c9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"FILE PHOTO: The Dior logo is seen on the facade of a shop in Paris, France, August 5, 2018.

PARIS - 10 January 2019: Christian Dior is bringing forward its men’s fashion show in Paris to avoid “yellow vest” protesters who have fought police, torched cars and smashed up shops over recent weekends, a source familiar with the decision said.



Dior, part of the LVMH luxury goods conglomerate, wrote to guests to reschedule a menswear catwalk show initially planned for Jan. 19 - a Saturday, when protesters have tended to converge on Paris and other big cities across France.



The show will instead be held on Friday, Jan. 18.



Upmarket Dior and Chanel boutiques were among those vandalized by the protesters in early December.



The “yellow vest” revolt, driven by high living costs and frustration at President Emmanuel Macron’s leadership, shows scant sign of abating after two months of unrest, even after he made some tax and minimum wage concessions.



Retailers and hotels were hit particularly hard by the Paris demonstrations in the run-up to Christmas. Department stores and luxury boutiques shuttered their outlets when protests descended into riots in early December, and tourists canceled bookings.



The source familiar with Dior’s decision said the brand was keen to avoid the Saturday street marches.



While turnout at the protests has fallen from early weeks, they have been consistently marred by violence and transport has been disrupted.



Macron’s government has said it will crack down harder on unauthorized protests and get tougher on anyone who loots or vandalizes shops and monuments.



Retailers had by late December lost around 2 billion euros ($2.3 billion) in revenue since the protests began, according to the French retail federation (FCD), which regroups everything from big supermarkets like Carrefour to toymakers and luxury brands.



Department stores and other shops are hoping to make up for lost business as the January sales kick off.



Fashion weeks, which attract crowds of specialist buyers and industry fans, are also an important source of income for Paris, home to some of the world’s more prominent high-end labels.



The menswear shows follow others in London and Milan, and precede the womenswear season of presentations running through February and early March.



Other high-profile fashion brands including Dior’s LVMH stablemate Loewe are maintaining their Saturday menswear shows.



The French fashion and Haute Couture federation that organizes Fashion Week in Paris said it was working with state authorities to ensure the presentations run smoothly and take place “in the best possible conditions.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9835811853408813}",neutral,0.9835811853408813,0
Report: Rihanna Set to Launch Luxury Line With LVMH Under Her Name - Singersroom News,"Thu, 17 Jan 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vc2luZ2Vyc3Jvb20uY29tL2NvbnRlbnQvMjAxOS0wMS0xNy9yaWhhbm5hLXNldC10by1sYXVuY2gtbHV4dXJ5LWxpbmUv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"That Rihanna reign just won’t stop!

After wins with her makeup, athleisure, and lingerie ventures, the music superstar is now looking to up the ante with her very own luxury fashion line. Her Fenty Beauty products racked up sales north of $100 million in a matter of weeks, and was hailed as a transformative brand.

According to WWD, the “Work” singer is in talks with LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton to launch a luxury house under her name. The partnership would become industry titan Bernard Arnault’s first fashion brand launched from scratch since Christian Lacroix in 1987.

Sources tell WWD that the company as already handpicked a clutch of employees from within, including some from Louis Vuitton and Celine, to work on the project in tandem with Rihanna and some of her key associates.

Rihanna has always demonstrated her interest in fashion, whether it be her paparazzi crazed public appearances, her fashion ambassadorships or her recent tenure as the creative director of Puma.

It is understood her collection with LVMH will span ready-to-wear, leather goods and accessories, and could be released in tandem with her ninth album, expected out sometime later this year, one source said.

Rihanna’s proximity to LVMH stretches back to at least 2015. After attending shows for Christian Dior, one of Arnault’s most treasured fashion properties, she appeared in “Secret Garden IV,” a campaign and short film shot by Steven Klein inside Versailles. It featured her in Dior sunglasses, carrying the brand’s bags and wearing looks from the Esprit Dior collection.

A year later, she created a range of futuristic sunglasses in collaboration with Dior as part of her brand ambassadorship.

Rihanna previously dabbled in fashion; In 2013, she created a collection of clothing and accessories with British high-street brand River Island.

“Launching at London Fashion Week is a dream come true for me,” she said at the time. “I have wanted to design my own collection for a long time and to present my collection for River Island alongside all of the other great design talent at LFW is a real privilege. I can’t wait to see the reaction from my fans and the fashion press.”

News about Rihanna launching a new brand under her own name comes on the heels of a lawsuit in which she is suing her father over the use of the Fenty name.

As we reported, Rihanna owns the trademark to “Fenty,” and claims her Dad started a talent development company in 2017 called Fenty without her permission. Additionally, Rihanna claims her father and his business partner, Moses Joktan Perkins, falsely advertised themselves as her reps and tried to book her for 15 shows in Latin America in December 2017 for $15 million without her permission.

She’s asking a judge to place an injunction on her Dad’s use of the name Fenty … and, of course, for damages.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999899864196777}",neutral,0.9999899864196777,0

French luxury fashion group LVMH has announced the renewed composition of the expert council.

Founder of the largest Russian shopping aggregator and online marketplace AIZEL Aisel Trudel joined the expert council of the competition, Trend Life reported.

Launched in November 2013, the LVMH Prize was created to honour and support young fashion designers around the world. Every year, a young designer and three graduates from fashion schools can claim the prestigious prize.

Applications for participation can be submitted until February 4 on the official website of the competition. The competition will be held in several stages. The semi-final will be held on March 2-3, where a council of 62 experts will select eight participants of the last round.

The finals will be held in June 2019 in Paris at the Fondation Louis Vuitton.

The expert group also includes fashion blogger Chiara Ferragni, model Naomi Campbell, editor in chief of Vogue UK Edward Annninful, head of Hypebeast Kevin Ma, director Loic Prizhan and many others. The chairman of the jury is the vice-president of Louis Vuitton and the founder of the Dolphin Arno Award.

Aysel was born on March 7, 1977 in Baku in a family of diplomats. At the age of 10, the family moved from Azerbaijan to Russian, where she graduated from the Moscow State Institute of International Relations. Her spouse is a famous architect Louis Trudel, head of the international design bureau TTMG.

To date, Aysel is the most successful woman in Russian retail, who is called fashion guru, business woman and İt-girl.

(Lacroix was later sold, in 2005.) Due to the huge costs involved in setting up a new brand, conglomerates like LVMH instead prefer to buy or invest in smaller fashion houses and rapidly expand them.

So why has it taken a punt on Rihanna – a superstar, albeit one with no formal design training? Established designer names within the LVMH portfolio have reportedly expressed interests in having their own brand but such wishes have not yet materialised, which only adds to the intrigue. Meanwhile, unemployed designers such as Alber Elbaz and Peter Copping are without a house to helm.

But Rihanna is no risky investment for LVMH. A celebrity in no need of a surname, Rihanna — with over 67 million Instagram followers — is a global household name, more instantly recognisable than any heritage fashion label. That most eight-year-olds will know at least one of her songs is especially relevant — the eight-year-olds of today will become tomorrow’s luxury consumers. Where luxury brands are struggling to find relevance among a younger, less label-loyal audience, Rihanna guarantees it.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999387264251709}",neutral,0.9999387264251709,0

// Full-year revenue up 10% year-on-year

// Profit from recurring operations surged 21%

LVMH has hailed another set of record full-year results, with the luxury retail firm booking double-digit increases in revenue and profit from recurring operations.

The parent company of Louis Vuitton, Dior, Sephora, Bvlgari and Kenzo recorded full-year revenue of €46.8 billion (£40.85 billion) in 2018, an increase of 10 per cent over the previous year.

Meanwhile, profit from recurring operations surged 21 per cent year-on-year to €10 billion (£8.72 billion) in 2018, and operating margin reached a level of 21.4 per cent – an increase of 1.9 percentage points.

LVMH’s group share of net profit grew 18 per cent to €6.4 billion (£5.58 billion), while free cash flow increased 16 per cent to €5.5 billion (£4.79 billion).

The company’s fashion and leather goods division was the star performer, with revenue surging 19 per cent year-on-year to €18.45 billion (£16.09 billion).

This was in part due to the strong first year of Dior’s couture operations falling under LVMH’s umbrella, and strong sales from classic and new products at Louis Vuitton.

Perfumes and cosmetics also recorded double-digit growth, and LVMH said it enjoyed continued overall growth in its Europe, the US, Asia and Japan markets.

However, the division that recorded the best profit from recurring operations was watches and jewelry, which skyrocketed 37 per cent year-on-year to €703 million (£613 million).

Profit from recurring operations in fashion and leather goods grew 21 per cent year-on-year to €5.94 billion (£5.17 billion).

“The desirability of our brands, the creativity and quality of our products, the unique experience offered to our customers, and the talent and the commitment of our teams are the group’s strengths and have once again made the difference,” LVMH chief executive Bernard Arnault said.

“In 2019 LVMH will continue its strong dynamic of innovation, targeted investments, combining tradition and modernity, long-term vision and responsiveness, entrepreneurial spirit and a sense of responsibility.

“In an environment that remains uncertain, we can count on the appeal of our brands and the agility of our teams to strengthen, once again in 2019, our leadership in the universe of high quality products.”

Paris-based LVMH - also the owner of Christian Dior and Givenchy, among a host of other luxury brands also spanning champagne and cosmetics labels - declined to comment.

It already has a partnership with the Umbrella singer in make-up. Fenty Beauty, which was developed with Rihanna via LVMH's Kendo ""brand incubator"", which promotes new products and labels, has grown rapidly since launching in September 2017.

LVMH said last April it expected Fenty to reach US$500 million (S$670 million) in retail sales in 2018 - which includes the revenue reaped by third parties - though it has not given an update since.

[[nid:426881]]

The new Rihanna venture would include clothing, leather goods and accessories, WWD said on Wednesday (Jan 16), citing sources with knowledge of the launch.

It said a collection could be released later this year, though the timing was uncertain.

Run by billionaire boss Bernard Arnault, LVMH has more often opted to grow through purchases, and it splashed out US$3.2 billion at the end of last year to buy hotel owner Belmond in a bid to branch into upscale hospitality.

In recent months, it has also invested heavily in developing its existing brands, however, including Celine, which has brought in a new designer and launched into menswear in a bid to grow revenues.

Luxury firms are facing headwinds including a potential slowdown in key market China, and are jostling to stand out from the crowd and attract younger shoppers by switching designers or working with celebrities and social media influencers as part of a marketing push.

Apple’s sales revision cascaded through global markets, hitting suppliers and rivals, but also a raft of luxury-goods companies that rely on the same clientele that likes to splurge on Apple’s latest products. Hong Kong-listed Prada SpA, Gucci-parent Kering SA, LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton, Burberry Group Plc and Richemont, the parent of jeweler Cartier, all declined in the wake of Apple’s shortfall.

“It’s going to become significantly more challenging to do well in China because the market is tightening up,” said David Roth, chief executive of WPP Plc’s ‘The Store’ global retail practice. “This is a challenging signal that people need to button down and understand China better and prepare.”

Apple cut its quarterly revenue outlook to USD84 billion from as much as $93 billion, blaming it in part on a pullback in demand within China. That set off warning bells throughout the luxury industry, as Chinese consumers account for about 30 percent of the $1 trillion in luxury-goods spending worldwide, according to Euromonitor International.

Prada dropped as much as 3.6 percent in Hong Kong on Friday. In Europe on Thursday, Kering SA fell 5.5 percent, while LVMH dropped 3.8 percent and Burberry tumbled 5.9 percent.

For years, companies from LVMH to Tiffany & Co. have targeted China’s wealthy tourists, who sought out pricey handbags, jewelry and other luxury items while on vacation in Paris to Dubai. Investors are worried that sliding yuan, China’s trade war-hit economy and a government crackdown on overseas purchases could dent demand.

Richemont, which lost 2.8 percent, has already been feeling the heat. The Swiss watch and jewelry-goods maker signaled in November that Chinese sales growth has slowed.

Others have maintained a more bullish tone, with both LVMH and Kering citing robust China sales in October and saying they welcome as shift to domestic sales.

A key test for retailers will come with China’s celebration of the Year of the Pig, which begins on Feb. 5. The week-long Chinese New Year holiday is traditionally a major occasion for shoppers from China to splurge. About two-thirds of those sales take place outside the country as tourists open their wallets while traveling abroad, taking advantage of better selection and cheaper prices than available at home.

But with the U.S. trade war weighing on China’s stocks and currency, and President Xi Jinping’s government trying to bolster a faltering economy, more mainlanders are choosing to do their shopping inside China rather than on overseas trips.

“There’s clearly a shift that has started to happen in the consumption pattern: Chinese people are buying more in China,” said Pascal Martin, a partner in Hong Kong with OC&C Strategy Consultants.

Taxes on imported clothing, which had been as high as 25 percent, are now just 7.1 percent. A recent crackdown by Chinese officials on travelers returning home with undeclared goods is also encouraging local consumption.

The gap between Chinese overseas and domestic spending on luxury is shrinking and a 50/50 balance is “in sight,’’ according to an HSBC report last month.

Companies are scrambling to adjust, opening more stores in China or partnering with local online outlets such as Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.’s Tmall. Ermenegildo Zegna, which has stores in 35 Chinese cities, in December opened a flagship store on Tmall Luxury Pavilion, following a similar move by Italian fashion house Valentino in November.

“It’s much healthier to have Chinese consumers consuming your product in their own country, in terms of repeat business and loyalty,’’ said Thibaud Andre, research director at Daxue Consulting.

The change in consumption patterns is creating headaches for retailers like Tiffany, which has long counted on Chinese shoppers going to Fifth Avenue or Rodeo Drive. In November, Tiffany reported weaker-than- expected sales and highlighted a “clear pattern” of Chinese shoppers cutting back on spending when they’re overseas. Sales in China itself, however, remained strong.

The shift to more domestic purchases will also create more intense rivalry this year as more foreign players vie for consumers’ money in China, according the Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Catherine Lim. She added that the growth prospects on the mainland still remain attractive relative to other countries.

One of the key strategies the companies have is to focus on tech-savvy millennials and the younger Generation Z. The sub-group of shoppers is expected to make up 55 percent of total global personal luxury goods purchases by 2025, a Bain & Co. report said in November.

Retailers and investors are watching to see whether that spending holds up.

“Luxury brands still benefit from a formidable capacity to recruit new consumers in China,’’ HSBC analysts led by Erwan Rambourg said in the December note, but “while managers are preparing for a moderation of growth, most investors we met with in Hong Kong have more dire predictions.’’ Bruce Einhorn, Daniela Wei and Robert Williams, Bloomberg","{'label': 'Negative', 'score': 0.9993441700935364}",negative,0.9993441700935364,-1

As general manager of Sephora’s ANZ business, Amelia developed the local store network and launched e-commerce across both markets.

Prior to the management role, Amelia served as Sephora’s regional director for business development and was based in Singapore, where she was instrumental in the launch of the business in several Southeast Asian countries.

She previously held management roles at Virgin Airlines and Lorna Jane.

Amelia started on her new role at Louis Vuitton on January 2.

Louis Vuitton’s parent company LVMH Moët Hennessy recorded revenue of €21.8 billion in the first half of 2018, an increase of 10 per cent from the previous corresponding period.

Organic revenue growth was 12 per cent compared to the same period in 2017. It was up 14 per cent when excluding the impact of the termination of the Hong Kong International Airport concessions at the end of 2017. The United States, Asia and Europe have experienced growth for the period.

In the second quarter, revenue increased by 11 per cent compared to the same period in 2017.

Bernard Arnault, chairman and CEO of LVMH, said the results attest to the strong desirability of their brands and the effectiveness of their strategy.

“Despite buoyant global demand, monetary and geopolitical uncertainties remain,” Arnault said.

“In this context, we will stay vigilant and rely on the talent of our teams and the shared entrepreneurial passion to further increase our leadership in the world of high quality products in 2018.”

Bernard Arnault, the world's fourth-richest person, added $4.3 billion (€3.73 billion) to his fortune Wednesday as Chinese consumers' growing appetite for handbags and Hennessy cognac boosted results at LVMH.

Shares of his Paris-based luxury-goods maker surged 6.9%, the most since mid-2016, as fourth-quarter profit topped analysts' estimates on strong demand from China, the world's second-largest economy.

Arnault controls about half of LVMH through a family holding company, Groupe Arnault SE.

His wealth has surged $8.3 billion since the start of the year and now stands at $76.9 billion, putting him within striking distance of Berkshire Hathaway Chairman Warren Buffett, who's currently ranked third on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index with $84.8 billion.

Amazon.com founder Jeff Bezos, the world's richest person, added $6.1 billion to his net worth Wednesday, while No. 2 Bill Gates, the Microsoft co-founder, gained $889.4 million.

LVMH's stake in luxury fashion house Cristian Dior SE comprises most of Arnault's fortune. He moved into luxury goods in 1984, taking over the bankrupt textile group that owned Christian Dior.

He sold the company's other businesses and used the proceeds to buy a controlling stake in LVMH. Last month, the company agreed to acquire high-end hotel operator Belmondin a deal that values the owner of New York's '21' Club at $2.6 billion.

Arnault has never ranked higher than fourth on the Bloomberg wealth ranking, which could see more of a shakeup near the top Thursday.

Shares of Mark Zuckerberg's Facebook surged 12% in extended trading at 5:25pm in New York after the company posted sales and profit that smashed estimates. Zuckerberg, currently the world's seventh-richest person, is poised to jump to No. 5, leapfrogging Spain's Amancio Ortega and Mexico's Carlos Slim.

Rihanna Is Moving Into Fashion With Deal With Luxury Brand LVMH - Celebrity Net Worth,"Sun, 27 Jan 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiggFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jZWxlYnJpdHluZXR3b3J0aC5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvZW50ZXJ0YWlubWVudC1hcnRpY2xlcy9yaWhhbm5hLWlzLW1vdmluZy1pbnRvLWZhc2hpb24td2l0aC1kZWFsLXdpdGgtbHV4dXJ5LWJyYW5kLWx2bWgv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Rihanna Is Moving Into Fashion With Deal With Luxury Brand LVMH

Everything Rihanna touches turns to gold. That's not an exaggeration. She's obviously a musician with a catalog of hits (we're still singing Umbrella…ella…ella), her makeup brand Fenty Beauty flies off the shelves of Sephora pretty much as soon as it is unpacked, her lingerie brand embraced a woman's curves—all of them and became an instant hit. Now, reports are surfacing that Ms. Fenty is poised to make the move into fashion via a deal with luxury conglomerate LVMH.

LVMH is, of course, the parent company run by billionaire Bernard Arnault that owns Louis Vuitton. The company has been in secret talks with Rihanna according to WWD. Rihanna will be launching a new brand under the LVMH umbrella (…ella…ella…ella). She has already worked with LVMH via her Fenty Beauty brand.

In the first month of sales for Fenty Beauty, sales were five times higher than Kylie Cosmetics, Kylie Jenner's makeup company supposedly valued at $800 million (which we heartily disagree with).

Rihanna's Savage x Fenty lingerie brand is also a hot seller thanks to being size inclusive. Rihanna didn't leave out the ladies with serious curves when she debuted her lingerie line, she embraced women of all shapes and sizes. In fact, her runway show during New York Fashion Week included models of all shapes, sizes, and ethnic backgrounds, including two pregnant models.

She told Elle,

""I wanted every woman on the stage with different energies, different races, body types, different stages in their womanhood, culture. I wanted women to feel celebrated and that we started this s—. We own this. This is our land because really it is. Women are running the world right now and it's too bad for men.""

Rihanna is pretty much a goddess sent to save us, people.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999001026153564}",neutral,0.9999001026153564,0

Reportedly, the company has already handpicked employees — including some from LV and Celine — to work with the musician.

On Tuesday, the starlet was spotted in Manhattan rocking a pair of gold sunglasses with her Fenty brand name spelled out across the temples. According to sources, Ri was simply testing out a prototype.

The 30-year-old has previously done collaborations including her Savage X Fenty lingerie line, and her Fenty x Puma streetwear collection.

If these reports are true, this is the first line LVMH has launched from scratch since Christian Lacroix in 1987.
