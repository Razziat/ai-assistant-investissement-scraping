A private equity firm backed by French luxury goods giant LVMH has invested in South Korean startup sunglasses maker Gentle Monster, banking on the Korean pop culture boom to fuel sales of the country’s luxury brands.

He did not disclose the value of the transaction. Media have reported the deal would be worth about US$53.17 million.

It is the firm’s third investment in South Korea after it bought minority stakes in Clio Cosmetics and YG Entertainment.

Catterton pursued the deal in the face of political tensions between South Korea and China that have dented sales of South Korean products like cosmetics and forced South Korean singers to cancel performances in China, hitting the profits of Clio and YG Entertainment.

The row had affected only low- and mid-end products and had not impacted Gentle Monster, Thakran said.

Founded in 2011, Gentle Monster surged in popularity in South Korea and China - traditionally dominated by Western luxury brands - after South Korea actress Jeon Ji-hyun wore its sunglasses in the popular drama My Love from the Star.

Shareholders would discuss a stock market listing although they were “not in a hurry” as the priority was to manage the firm’s growth, Thakran said.

He said South Korea also offered attractive investment prospects in areas such as ginseng, travel retail, fashion, music, entertainment and technology.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.999996542930603}",neutral,0.999996542930603,0
"LVMH, Kering Ban Underweight and Underage Runway Models - The Cut","Wed, 06 Sep 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWN1dC5jb20vMjAxNy8wOS9sdm1oLWtlcmluZy1iYW4tdW5kZXJ3ZWlnaHQtYW5kLXVuZGVyYWdlLXJ1bndheS1tb2RlbHMuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Christian Dior runway.

French fashion conglomerates LVMH and Kering announced on Wednesday morning (the first day of New York Fashion Week) that they will not allow underage or underweight models to walk in their runway shows across the world.

The charter is a long overdue response to criticism that the fashion industry promotes unattainable body standards and eating disorders. In December, casting director James Scully gave a talk on cruelty and discrimination in the fashion industry. In February, still fed up, he decided to name names and specifically called out Balenciaga (owned by Kering) and Lanvin on Instagram.

Fast-forward six months, and the two giants announced that they jointly created and signed a charter titled “The Charter on Working Relations With Fashion Models and Their Well-Being.” The charter says they will not cast models under 16 or use models below a size 2 for women and size 34 for men.

The Health and Care section of the charter, exclusively obtained by the Cut, reads:

— The brands commit to working solely with models who are able to present a valid medical certificate, provided by the agencies and obtained less than six months before the shooting or the fashion show, attesting to their good health and ability to work — The brands commit to ban size 32 for women and size 42 for men (French measurement) from their casting requirements, and will thereby require casting agencies to present women and men models who are respectively size 34 or over, and 44 or over — The brands agree to put a dedicated psychologist/therapist at the models’ disposal during their working time

While the Young Models section reads:

— The brands must not hire models under the age of 16 to participate in shows and shootings representing an adult — Models between 16 and 18 years old are not allowed to work between 10pm and 6am — Nudity or semi-nudity for models under 18 is only allowed through an agreement signed by both the model and her/his legal representative — The presence of a chaperon/guardian appointed by their agencies, and who can also be one of the model’s parents, is mandatory for models from 16 to 18 years of age — Any model under the age of 18 must be housed in the same accommodation as her/his chaperon/guardian — The brands must require agencies to ensure that models meet their school attendance obligations — Alcohol shall not be served to models under the age of 18

The other six sections of the charter outline more stipulations for model’s well-being, including providing access to food and drink throughout the day, code of conduct for nude shoots, and requirements for a private place to change.

The two companies own many of the biggest, most prestigious fashion houses. LVMH owns Christian Dior, Louis Vuitton, Marc Jacobs, and 11 other luxury fashion brands. Kering owns Alexander McQueen, Balenciaga, Saint Laurent, and 16 other luxury and sportswear brands.

In a statement, François-Henri Pinault, chairman and CEO of Kering, said, “Respecting the dignity of all women has always been both a personal commitment for me and a priority for Kering as a Group. Through the establishment of this charter and our commitment to abide by its terms, we are once again manifesting the importance of this core value in a very concrete manner.”

And Antoine Arnault, member of LVMH Board of Directors, chairman of Loro Piana, and chief executive officer of Berluti, said, “We have the responsibility of building new standards for fashion and we hope to be followed by other players in our sector.”

France had passed a “skinny model” law in 2015, which went into effect this year, that required new models to provide a doctors note that they are in good health and a BMI of 18 or over, and fines brands 75,000 euro for using underweight models.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999837875366211}",neutral,0.9999837875366211,0
LVMH Increases Environmental Targets - WWD,"Wed, 20 Sep 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3dkLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy1uZXdzL21hcmtldGluZy1wcm9tb3Rpb24vbHZtaC1yYWlzZXMtZW52aXJvbm1lbnRhbC10YXJnZXRzLWJlcm5hcmQtYXJuYXVsdC0xMDk5NTk3OS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS — LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton on Wednesday upped the stakes in the battle for green credentials by hosting a lavish event to celebrate the 25th anniversary of its environmental division.

“Our customers today want to have the feeling when they are buying a product from the group that they are part of something that is good for the planet,” Bernard Arnault, chairman and chief executive officer of LVMH, told a gathering of 300 people at the group’s headquarters on Avenue Montaigne here.

The luxury titan headlined a two-hour program that included speeches by the chief executives of Guerlain, Sephora, Loro Piana and Moët & Chandon, as well as chef Alain Ducasse; Tony Estanguet, copresident of the Paris bid for the 2024 Olympics, and explorer and aeronaut Bertrand Piccard.

Charlize Theron, the face of Dior’s J’adore fragrance, sent a video message in which she commended the brand for initiatives to reduce the environmental footprint of its products. “I am proud because Dior is synonymous with desirability, beauty and sustainability,” she said.

Students from Central Saint Martins showed outfits inspired by LVMH’s partnership with the London school on a sustainable fashion innovation program. Meanwhile, documentary-maker Loïc Prigent presented a satirical short film featuring TV presenter Mademoiselle Agnès as an eco-conscious shopper.

LVMH, which owns fashion brands including Louis Vuitton, Dior and Fendi, said it plans to double its internal carbon funds from next year.

It has invested 6.7 million euros since 2016 in carbon funds, which help businesses to calculate, reduce and offset their emission of greenhouse gases. Sylvie Bénard, LVMH group environment director, said that sum should rise to 12 million euros in 2018.

In addition, LVMH has achieved its initial target of using 10 percent renewable energy and is now aiming for 30 percent by 2020, as well as a 25 percent reduction in carbon dioxide emissions compared with 2013, it said.

Arnault noted that LVMH was the first company in France’s CAC 40 Index to have created an environmental division.

“We have probably been the leaders in our sector for a long time. In fact, we remain the leaders today in environmental protection with regards to the luxury goods sector,” he told journalists in a briefing before the conference.

Companies are vying to burnish their green credentials not only in the fast-fashion sector, which stands accused of harming the environment by promoting excessive consumption, but also at the higher end of the price spectrum, where luxury brands pride themselves on making products that stand the test of time.

To wit, Arnault’s comments came just a day after rival group Kering, which comprises brands such as Gucci, Saint Laurent and Stella McCartney, said it had been recognized for the third time by the Dow Jones Sustainability Indices as the industry leader for the textiles, apparel and luxury goods sectors.

Though he did not mention François-Henri Pinault, the Kering chairman and ceo who has made sustainability a central platform of his group’s strategy, Arnault remarked that LVMH has cared about the environment since its inception, given its roots in wines and spirits.

“For us, it’s not about following a more or less recent or media-friendly trend. In 1992, I remember, when we launched this initiative, we were the first and incidentally, the only ones,” he said.

“Both our employees and our customers are very attached to this aspect of our activity, so it felt appropriate perhaps now to make a shift and talk about it a little more than we have done until now. It’s good to be discreet, but it has certain limits,” Arnault added.

The group’s environmental targets, set out in its “LIFE 2020” roadmap published last year, centered around four pillars: products; sourcing and supply chain; carbon dioxide, and sites.

The objectives were set with input from 30 of the group’s brands, out of the 70 that belong to the LVMH Initiatives For the Environment, or LIFE, program launched in 2012. It covers every step from product design to retail operations and is now a required component in the strategic plans of all LVMH brands.

Other objectives include increasing the use of leather from tanneries certified by the Leather Working Group, a multi-stakeholder group that promotes sustainable and appropriate environmental business practices within the leather industry, to 70 percent of the total.

“As the leader in luxury, we have the responsibility to be the best in this field and also to show that the protection of the planet is not incompatible with the economic, innovation and creativity aspects that are very central values for the LVMH group,” said group managing director Antonio Belloni.

Arnault noted the initiatives come at a cost. “It represents an investment, that much is obvious, but it yields benefits in the long term,” he remarked.

Among the examples highlighted by group executives were Guerlain’s redesign of the packaging of its flagship Orchidée Impériale face cream, which resulted in a 58 percent reduction in the product’s carbon footprint, and Sephora’s plan to install LED lighting in all of its 2,400 stores worldwide by 2020.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.999932050704956}",neutral,0.999932050704956,0
Kering and LVMH Draft Charter on Models' Well-Being - The Fashion Law,"Wed, 06 Sep 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWZhc2hpb25sYXcuY29tL2tlcmluZy1hbmQtbHZtaC1qb2luLWRyYWZ0LWNoYXJ0ZXItb24tbW9kZWxzLXdlbGwtYmVpbmcv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Two of the fashion industry’s largest conglomerates have come together to take a stand for runway models. Kering – which owns Gucci, YSL, Balenciaga, and Bottega Veneta, among other brands – and LVMH – parent to Louis Vuitton, Celine, Givenchy, and Marc Jacobs, etc. – have established a charter for the well-being of models that will be implemented across their rosters of brands.

According to a joint statement released by the Paris-based conglomerates on Wednesday, a day before the start of the Spring/Summer 2018 shows in New York: “Respecting the dignity of every man and woman is at the heart of both group’s values. Having always cared for the well-being of models, LVMH and Kering feel that they have a specific responsibility, as leaders in the industry, to go one step further with their brands.”

The Charter

This charter, which is applicable worldwide (although not legally mandated on its own), “reflects high standards of integrity, responsibility and respect for those concerned,” according to the two fashion figures. In addition to “paying particular attention” to ensuring good working conditions for models, the charter is structured around “several major commitments,” including:

• Brands of both groups commit to working solely with models able to present a valid medical certificate, attesting to their good health and ability to work, obtained less than six months before the shooting or the fashion show;

• All fashion brands belonging to LVMH and Kering commit to banning size 32 for women and size 42 for men (French measurement) from their casting requirements. Casting agencies will be required to present female and male models who are size 34 or over, and size 44 or over, respectively. To further ensure the care of models, it will be incumbent upon the brands to put a dedicated psychologist/therapist at their disposal during their working time;

[Note: Size 32 in France corresponds to size 0 in the United States].

• Models below the age of 16 must not be hired by brands to take part in shows or shootings representing an adult;

• 16 to 18 year-old models are subject to specific rules: They are not permitted to work between 10pm and 6am; The presence of a chaperon/guardian—who can be one of the model’s parents— appointed by their agency is mandatory for models aged 16 to 18, and any model under the age of 18 must be housed in the same accommodation as their chaperon/guardian; and The charter requires brands to ask agencies to ensure that models meet their school attendance obligations; and

• Models must have the possibility of making a direct complaint in the case of a dispute with a modeling agency, a casting director or a brand (e.g. through the designation of a contact person or the setting up of a hotline).

The implementation of the Charter “will start during the upcoming Fashion Weeks. A monitoring committee, made up of representatives of the brands, agencies and models, will meet each year (once every six months for the first year),” the release further notes.

An Effective Initiative?

The LVMH, Kering charter follows a handful of prior attempts by other important industry stakeholders in connection with the casting of models, all of which have been questionably effective, at best. You may recall that in 2012, Conde Nast announced that the editors of all of its Vogue magazines had vowed to stop using “underage” models (aka models under age 16) in all Vogue editorials. That vow was swiftly followed by a handful of Vogue publications featuring models under age 16 in their editorials.

Around the same time, the Council of Fashion Designers of America (“CFDA”) introduced guidelines for New York Fashion Week as part of its “Health as Beauty and Diversity” campaign to ensure the safety and legality of models in the industry. The guidelines recommend that designers require models to produce a valid ID the day they walk the runway proving that they are at least 16 years old, which – as noted by Jezebel – was the centerpiece of the CFDA’s seasonal letter to its members.

Not long thereafter, several brands that fall under the umbrella of the CFDA stepped out on the group’s own initiative. For instance, in September 2011, 15-year old model Valerija Sestic walked in more than a dozen shows during NYFW alone, including those of CFDA members Oscar de la Renta, Donna Karan, Tory Burch, Rag & Bone, Tory Burch, Phillip Lim, Carolina Herrera, Marc by Marc Jacobs and Rodarte.

With such instances in mind, it would appear prudent to question the potential efficacy of LVMH and Kering’s charter from the outset. However, there is one very important element that the groups’ charter fails to note. A French law, which per the New York Times “applies to all models working in the European Union and the European Economic Area,” already exists. That legislation mandates – and as a ratified law, formally trumps – any of the provisions set forth in the parties’ charter.

As such, almost all of the LVMH and Kering brands – the vast majority of which show in Paris and Milan and thus, are subject to European Union law – would already be legally obligated to do quite a bit of what they are vowing to in the charter.

In accordance with the aforementioned EU law, beginning on October 1, 2017, models must possess a medical certificate in order to work (one of the major tenets of the parties’ charter). In accordance with that same law, models will have to undergo a medical examination every two years and be issued with a medical certificate certifying that their they are in good enough health to work. Particular attention will be paid to their body mass index, which is calculated by dividing their weight by the square of their height.

That speaks directly to the charter’s measurement/size language and its requirement that brands only employ models “who are able to present a valid medical certificate, provided by the agencies and obtained less than six months before the shooting or the fashion show.”

As for the age-specific rules for models under age 16, these are in line with a New York-specific law – the home of LVMH’s Marc Jacobs brand – that requires that underage models be subject to special considerations, including restricted working hours, breaks after every four hours of work, and specific work permits, etc.

With these existing laws in mind, Kering and LVMH’s charter appears to be more of a declaration that the conglomerates will, in fact, follow the law, than it is a legally groundbreaking effort.

Now, none of this is to say that if these parties do, in fact, abide by the tenets of the charter (and thus, the law) that such efforts will – very practically – amount to a significant step for the industry. This is particularly true because the conglomerates at play are the two most powerful entities in the game and their vocal support for models’ well being is meaningful in and of itself.

It is imperative to acknowledge that in a handful of cases, the charter’s language goes well beyond the laws in the various jurisdictions. The requirement of agencies making a dedicated psychologist/therapist available to models, being one example, and the requirement of health certificates every six months (as opposed to two years), being another.

Moreover, it is worth stating that unlike any other major conglomerates (or other very-established brands), Kering and LVMH are, in fact, taking steps to publicly vow to uphold the declarations set forth in their charter, which is commendable and given their collective power, very well stands to make an impact in the fashion industry.

UPDATED (February 2018): LVMH and Kering have “expanded upon” their commitment to model well being by launching WeCareForModels.com, a website aimed at “empowerment, transparency and emancipation, initiated by the the Charter and provides models with information and best practices.”

In particular, the luxury giants state that they hope their charter and recently-launched website, which includes “information and advice from professionals concerning well-being, as well as first-person comments,” will serve “to encourage all the different stakeholders in the industry to actively engage with this initiative.”

The website, per Kering and LVMH, provides “a few simple daily practices and basic rules that, if followed regularly, play a fundamental role in being and remaining in top physical and mental form.” These include: “Healthy eating guidelines [for] both outside and during Fashion Weeks, a few examples of which are found in the section All About Food.”

In addition, “in the State of Mind section we talk about other kinds of equally important factors that contribute to a healthy balance such as knowing how to breathe, positive thinking, getting appropriate exercise and getting rest. These are simple tips that have been prepared with models in mind with the help of nutritionists and coaches. They can easily be applied backstage.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999977350234985}",neutral,0.9999977350234985,0

At just 25 years old he lead luxury luggage brand Rimowa, particularly renowned among the celebrity jet-set crowd. The brand was influential in propelling LVMH’s digital strategy forward through its collaborations with Supreme, Off-White's Virgil Abloh and Fendi. In January of 2021, Arnault joined LVMH acquisition Tiffany & Co. as executive vice president of product and communications.

Arnault comes from a digital background, originally graduating from Télécom ParisTech before going on to gain a master of research in innovation from École Polytechnique. He has been an influential force in pushing digital to the forefront of LVMH’s agenda, and was a key behind-the-scenes player in the launch of 24 Sèvres, the conglomerate’s new multi-brand e-commerce platform. Speaking about the venture, the group’s chief digital officer Ian Rogers told BoF, “In terms of why LVMH hasn’t gone there sooner, I think the answer is that they did, and it was tough ... they wanted to be sure that if they re-entered this race, that they did it in the right way. Alexandre was really key to that ... I think that having his vision there allowed the group to make this leap again.”

In October 2016 LVMH announced that it would acquire an 80 percent stake in suitcase maker Rimowa for €673.6 million, confirming that Arnault would be appointed co-chief executive upon completion of the transaction, running the German company alongside Dieter Morszeck. His executive appointment came after just three years of behind-the-scenes work at the family holding company Groupe Arnault.

Arnault was reportedly the first to spot Rimowa as a potential acquisition target for LVMH — after Samsonite announced it would acquire Tumi in March 2016, Rimowa was the last high-end luggage brand left on the market — and sources close to the conglomerate say Arnault was also the first to reach out to Morszeck. Upon his official appointment in January 2017, Arnault confirmed plans to open seven stores in addition to the Parisian flagship over the course of the year.

In January 2017 he accompanied his father to Trump Tower for a meet with the US president elect just weeks before his inauguration. He was the only one of Bernard Arnault’s offspring to accompany him, despite being one of three children to hold senior positions at LVMH. In April 2019, he assumed his father's seat on the board of directors for French supermarket chain Carrefour.

Following LVMH's blockbuster acquisition of Tiffany & Co., Arnault joined the American luxury jewellery giant. At Tiffany, Arnault may choose to expand the jeweller’s already-famous designer-partnership portfolio.

In addition to his native French and English, Arnault is also fluent in German.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999940395355225}",neutral,0.9999940395355225,0
"Bamford Abandons Rolex, Instead Focuses On LVMH Watch Division Brands - aBlogtoWatch","Thu, 21 Sep 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFibG9ndG93YXRjaC5jb20vYmFtZm9yZC1hYmFuZG9ucy1yb2xleC1mb2N1c2VzLWx2bWgtd2F0Y2gtYnJhbmRzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"I recently ran into George Bamford – of Bamford Watch Department – who shared with me that he will soon entirely stop customizing Rolex watches for customers. This news is sort of a big deal given that Bamford put his name on the horological map by being the world’s premier aftermarket customizer of Rolex timepieces. Anyone in the know always thinks of Bamford when it comes to serious Rolex watch customization, and any time someone sees a black-colored Rolex, chances are the Bamford name comes to mind. While Bamford still has some Rolex watch orders to fill, one of the world’s most famous modern-day Rolex collectors is putting “the crown” behind him.

George Bamford will instead focus the majority of his time to working with Jean-Claude Biver and the LVMH Watch Division that’s under Mr. Biver’s leadership. Biver oversees Hublot and Zenith, while currently serving as the CEO of TAG Heuer. Bamford quietly debuted this relationship recently when introducing a few limited edition Zenith watches customized by the London-based timepiece modifier. It now turns out that this is just the beginning, and that Bamford will be working closely with Zenith and TAG Heuer, as well as possibly Hublot for future models.

Advertising Message

Is this what Jean-Claude Biver means when he regularly talks about the importance of love? It certainly seems this way if you interpret “love” as also meaning “cooperation.” While Rolex is often called “the crown” (given their logo), Jean-Claude Biver is often referred to as the “king” of the watch industry. He is certainly among the most powerful. Mr. Biver’s success is often linked to his ability to cleverly create synergies where they are available. Effective cooperation is a cornerstone of Jean-Claude’s management style, which is perhaps why he was able to make such a compelling argument to George Bamford about working together. According to Jean-Claude Biver, “George (Bamford) has proven that he knows how to “tune” a watch and also that he is able to make a very classic watch into a trendy watch.”

Bamford, who was clearly excited to work more closely with Mr. Biver and his teams, shared with me the incredibly pragmatic argument presented to him by Jean-Claude Biver. It isn’t a secret that Bamford’s relationship with Rolex was tenuous at best. Bamford was not an official Rolex dealer, and in order to do business needed to purchase Rolex watches in the market, and then later modify them. Rather than support the practices of an interesting modifier, Rolex took the stance that Bamford, like all watch customizers was removing the “authenticity” of a Rolex rendering them (among other things) not eligible to be serviced by Rolex service centers. That means even though Bamford never touched the mechanics of any Rolex watch, the company itself refused to repair or service Bamford-modified Rolex watches. The move prompted Bamford to create his own service department.

If you know George Bamford, then you know just how much of a Rolex mega-fan he is. The entire concept of modifying Rolex timepieces began when he wanted to change the look of a Daytona model he had. Soon Bamford became the go-to name for high-street shoppers looking for a familiar, albeit more exclusive timepiece shopping experience. Getting a totally personalized, or otherwise uncommon modified Rolex watch proved to be a winning formula for many luxury consumers seeking enhanced personality in their choice of watch.

Advertising Message

Bamford is no stranger to working with watches other than those produced by Rolex. Bamford Patek Philippe, Audemars Piguet, and Panerai watches have all been made in the past. With that said, the archetypal Bamford creation was always a Rolex – until now. So what did Jean-Claude Biver tell George Bamford in order to have him switch sides? The argument was simple. Biver presented Bamford with the question of whether it was better to focus so much of his energy and passion to a brand that didn’t support what he did, or to instead do the same thing with a supporting and encouraging partner. When put that way, Bamford made what he felt was the obvious choice. Biver has long since been a Bamford fan, known for sometimes even using the maverick’s customized watches as examples to his own design teams of colorways or styles that he liked. Taking the step of bringing George Bamford under his wing represents a new phase in their relationship – as well as a broadening of Jean-Claude’s influence over the cutting edge of high-end watch style and taste.

It appears that Bamford will be both a sort of supplier to the LVMH Watch Division, as well as a retailer of customized watches from Zenith and TAG Heuer. According to Mr. Biver, Bamford will mostly be involved in limited edition, versus main production watches. More so, Bamford will be able to sell some of the resultant watches via his own sales channels, while in other cases the watches he works with brands like Zenith or TAG Heuer on might also be available through their own sales channels. Bamford also isn’t under any exclusivity agreements, and as Biver makes a point to remark to me, he is a “believer” in “open concepts” in general.

Such non-traditional working relationships are uncommon in the typically conservative watch industry. Under Jean-Claude Biver, such conventions don’t matter much. For him, what appears to be of primary importance is that the LVMH Watch Division and Bamford are a good fit, and should be able to benefit one another continuously. It’s no secret that Jean-Claude Biver routinely enlists help and advice from people around the world he sees as being tastemakers and trendsetters. Bringing George Bamford under his umbrella further demonstrates the importance of artistic creativity (as well as performance and value) in the promotion and sale of luxury watches today.

Time will show exactly how the relationship between Bamford Watch Department and the LVMH Watch Division will develop itself. Will Rolex learn to miss him? What I also find interesting is that Bamford is confident enough to abandon his reliance on the popularity of Rolex in order to continue growing his brand.

Luxury fashion groups know it’s in their best interest to nurture young designers. So why not launch a competition to seek out the next big thing before your rival does? The LVMH prize is presided over by a jury comprised of artistic directors from across the group. The award was created in 2014 by Delphine Arnault, the eldest daughter of fashion mogul Bernard Arnault. This year, French designer Marine Serre, who's just 25, won the top prize of €300,000 and a year of mentoring.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.7068246603012085}",positive,0.7068246603012085,1
LVMH Sues Social Media Savvy Watch Counterfeiters - WWD,"Thu, 07 Sep 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3dkLmNvbS9mZWF0dXJlL2x2bWgtdGFnLWhldWVyLWh1YmxvdC13YXRjaGVzLXN1ZXMtc29jaWFsLW1lZGlhLXNhdnZ5LXdhdGNoLWNvdW50ZXJmZWl0ZXJzLTEwOTczOTA4L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LVMH is going after Tag Heuer and Hublot counterfeiters, claiming their fake wares and their social media advertising strategy are damaging the luxury watch brands.

LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton subsidiary LVMH Swiss Manufactures SA on Tuesday urged an Illinois federal court to stop a “network” of Chinese counterfeit entities from making and selling online a range of fake Tag Heuer and Hublot watches that make blatant use of the luxury company’s trademarks and designs.

The company admitted that the counterfeiters “go to great lengths” to obscure their identities and create “Internet stores by the hundreds and design them to appear to be selling genuine products,” but there are marked similarities in layout and fake product that show them to be part of a Chinese collective, according to the complaint.

Beyond the look of the accused web sites and their merchandise, LVMH said the counterfeiters incorporate the Tag Heuer and Hublot brand names in numerous areas of text and metadata in order to get online shoppers to the sites, along with other web maneuvers.

“Defendants use other unauthorized search engine optimization tactics and social media spamming so that defendant Internet stores’ listings show up at or near the top of relevant search results and misdirect consumers searching for genuine products,” LVMH said. “Other defendants only show plaintiffs’ trademarks in product images while using strategic item titles and descriptions that will trigger their listings when consumers are searching for plaintiffs products.”

The company pointed to merchant web sites such AS eBay and Alibaba as examples of other hosts of the spam adverts.

Although LVMH is demanding that all of the domain names, which were filed under court seal, be halted and handed over to the company, it may not do much to stop the sale of knock-off watches.

LVMH said in its complaint that counterfeiters like those being accused here tend to make immediate use of lax registration requirements for new domain names and move their web operations to “rogue servers” known for ignoring brand and court-ordered take-down notices.

The counterfeiters also generally operate payments through PayPal, but once they are notified of a lawsuit, they allegedly move funds to offshore bank accounts, making collection of profits difficult, if not impossible.

Nevertheless, LVMH is asking the Illinois court to award damages equal to all of the defendants’ ill-gotten profits, or up to $2 million for each use of its trademarks and $100,000 per domain name incorporating any of its trademarks.

"Alexandre Arnault, LVMH's Digital Scion | BoF - The Business of Fashion","Sun, 24 Sep 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzb2ZmYXNoaW9uLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy9sdXh1cnkvYWxleGFuZHJlLWFybmF1bHQtbHZtaHMtZGlnaXRhbC1zY2lvbi_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LONDON, United Kingdom — It would be easy to dismiss Alexandre Arnault as just another rich kid. Like his father Bernard Arnault — the wealthiest man in France and mastermind behind the $130 billion LVMH empire — Alexandre is more than six feet tall, reed-thin and often dressed in an impeccable navy blue Dior suit and Berluti shoes.

He is unfailingly polite, with a warm, laid-back disposition, and seems to have inherited the curiosity, drive and ambition that have made his father a living luxury industry legend and one of the world’s most respected businessmen. But until recently, Alexandre has mostly kept a low profile.

The world first got its first real glimpse of Alexandre Arnault in January when he accompanied his father on a highly publicised visit to Trump Tower to meet then president-elect Donald Trump to discuss LVMH’s plans for the critical US market, including the possibility of opening a new factory Stateside.

Many in the luxury industry seemed to sit up and take notice: it was not his older half-siblings Delphine, 42, and Antoine, 40, who joined their father on this important mission. It was Alexandre. Then, later that month, at the age of 24, he was named co-chief executive of Rimowa after LVMH acquired an 80 percent stake of the German luggage business, known for its premium, ribbed aluminium rolling suitcases, for €640 million (about $716 million).

This was not just a nepotistic appointment. The Rimowa deal was actually Alexandre’s idea. “I spent two years courting the former owner and spending a lot of time with him, showing him what we did, kind of seducing him,” the young Arnault says in American-inflected English when we meet over lunch at London’s Bulgari Hotel, also part of the LVMH empire.

The $18.5 billion global luggage market is in the midst of rapid consolidation. Samsonite, which had a 17.3 percent market share in 2015, according to Euromonitor, acquired rival Tumi last March for $1.8 billion. With the Rimowa acquisition, LVMH firmly positioned itself as the number two player in the space, building on its long-standing position in luxury luggage through its high-end Louis Vuitton business with a presence in the fast-growing premium luggage sector.

“The travel market is growing at an incredible pace, I think 12 to 15 percent a year. The [Rimowa] brand has been untouched in the past 20 to 30 years. Four wheels from two wheels, improvements here and there, but it was never taken to the next level,” explains Alexandre.

But just who is this young man, thrust into the industry spotlight? And what does the future hold for him at LVMH?

""I've always enjoyed learning. I studied physics, maths and chemistry when I graduated high school in the famous prépas in France — classe préparatoire — prépas is the code name,"" he says of his time at Lycée Louis le Grand, a prestigious secondary school located in the fifth arrondissement of Paris. ""You're mixed up with kids your own age who come from around France. It's free, so anybody can go. It's based on merit, so there's no privileges for anyone. There were kids like me and also very modest people coming from the suburbs of South East of France who were all on the same level. We were all passionate about excelling at something and learning, learning, learning.""

After prépas, he enrolled to study computer science at Télécom ParisTech, one of France's grandes écoles. But Alexandre was already eager to immerse himself in the family business. ""I asked if I could regroup [my classes] on one day to allow me to work in the next four. For those three years between 2013 and 2016, [I spent] one day a week at school and the rest of the time working [in the group] on technology and investments for [private holding company] Groupe Arnault and following my dad around on trips to get more acquainted with the business abroad. It was fascinating.""

It was after gaining this first-hand insight into the inner workings of the LVMH empire that he pitched the Rimowa deal to his father as a good fit for the group's portfolio of more than 70 maisons, including Louis Vuitton and Dior. ""Once we had the opportunity to acquire it, I had this baby that I had polished and I wanted to see what was inside.""

Rimowa was founded in Cologne in 1898 by Paul Morszeck who focused on the kind of classic steamer trunks that competed with the likes of Louis Vuitton and Goyard. But it was Morszeck’s son, Richard Morszeck Warenzeichen, who started manufacturing the company’s distinctive aluminium suitcases. RI-MO-WA is even derived from his name. At the time of the LVMH acquisition, the company was turning over around €400 million (about $471 million) and had become one of the largest premium luggage brands in the world.

Now, as co-CEO, Alexandre’s strategy is to go after the travel sector, writ large. “The middle class in China is growing like crazy, so people are starting to travel. It’s also very linked to Millennials. Everybody says ‘oh yeah, Millennials don’t want to buy products anymore, they want to live and experience and so on,’” he continues. “Yes, that’s true, I see it in myself. I don’t own a car. I don’t own these things because I prefer spending money on experiences as well. Yet, for experiences, you need a suitcase because you need to travel, right?”

“Social media is also a big factor in this. Back [in the old days], you would have a Vuitton logo somewhere and it was kind of a status symbol of ‘Hey, I made it. I could afford it.’ Now, for the same amount of money, people prefer to post a picture of themselves swimming with dolphins in Bali,” he quips.

Alexandre can certainly talk the talk, and he seems to have developed a very good strategic understanding of the business opportunity for Rimowa, but is the 25-year-old really ready to be a CEO?

“I still have to prove myself,” he says. “My father is the same with [all of] his five children and he’s very insistent on meritocracy. You only get things if you deserve them. Being at LVMH with my surname gets me a lot of advantages: access to people, access to technology and knowledge which someone my age without my last name wouldn’t have. I get to spend a lot of time with my father but also with CEOs and very senior people. But it’s also more challenging because I’m obviously more under the spotlight than anyone else. But pressure has never been an issue for me, so I think I live with that pretty well.”

“I talked with my dad a lot, and I asked him, ‘Please, trust me with some operational responsibilities. I’d rather take something small but be in charge than work in a big company and be responsible for a smaller perimeter,’” he explains. “I think that was already on his mind and he lived with the idea. When the opportunity to acquire Rimowa came, obviously the group would have to put in a manager for the brand and I told my father that I’d be super interested in doing that. Yes, it’s in Germany, it’s in Cologne. Yes, I’ll move away from Paris, but operationally it’s such a unique challenge.”

Alexandre is reluctant to lay out his plans for Rimowa in detail, but he does say this. “I’m a big admirer of Airbnb. We as a family invested in the business when I was working in tech. What they have built with experiences is [based on] one simple remark: people book Airbnb but they only spend 20 percent of their vacation in the Airbnb. So they said, we want to own the entire experience, because we don’t want to sell people a place to live, we want to make them better travellers and make them happier travellers. So they launched Airbnb Experiences. It’s kind of the same with us: you sell a suitcase. I travelled this morning so I woke up, I left, I took the train and went to my hotel and now my suitcase is gone, it’s going to wait till Sunday till I leave. So I think, to really have a Rimowa customer, we have to also find other things to offer him.”

In preaching a business opportunity more in tune with Silicon Valley than a traditional French luxury conglomerate, Alexandre seems to be carving out his own identity, separate from that of Delphine and Antoine, who are also actively engaged in the family business and have become powerhouses and would-be successors in their own right. Antoine, chief executive of Berluti and chairman of the Italian cashmere company Loro Piana, came up through the ranks at Louis Vuitton, where he worked closely with Pietro Beccari, now CEO of Fendi, building a reputation as an executive with a flair for marketing and communications. His elder sister Delphine was schooled in all things Dior under the tutelage of chief executive Sidney Toledano and is now executive vice president of Louis Vuitton and the force behind the LVMH Prize for Young Fashion Designers, as part of her mission to build relationships with the next generation of fashion talent.

I still have to prove myself. My father is the same with [all of] his five children and he's very insistent on meritocracy.

So what will become Alexandre's raison d'être in the group? ""I'm still building my own identity,"" he says. ""I see myself as a builder, as someone who likes to build things. But right now, the path I want to carve for myself is having this company Rimowa and making it as successful as I can, building something powerful, meaningful, relevant with it. Then we'll see where my help is needed in the group. I'm at the service of this group. I'm both a shareholder and a manager, so wherever my help is needed I'd be happy to give it. If you look at my older siblings and I have two younger brothers as well, the way they've built their careers, it's all about: where can I be useful? How can I help? This is what I want to do.""

Even now, his service to the group is not limited to Rimowa. As the youngest Arnault in the business, and one with a personal interest in technology, Alexandre has already taken on the mantle of digital guru, acting as an advocate for modernising the group’s digital culture, building connections with the technology industry and attracting the kind of talent — developers, engineers, product managers — that can help to reshape a company that some consider a technology laggard that has failed to innovate as quickly as competitors.

""I'm a geek at heart. I studied computer science at school,"" Arnault says of his years at Télécom ParisTech. ""Very early on, I started doing investments in tech companies for Groupe Arnault. I would go to the US and my dad would say 'I'm sick of seeing those Snapchats and Ubers and we're not investing in them. Go meet those guys!' So, I would go to San Francisco every month and a half and meet a lot of people, build a network, and I would come back every time and go, 'Wow! It's amazing to see what these people think of us.' They see us as like hommes de Cro-Magnon, as you would say in France.""

In doing so, he also managed to become the de-facto advisor to his father on all things digital. ""Little by little I would talk to my father and he would say: 'You're right, but people don't want to buy bags online, they want to go to our stores.' My father has always been a fan of technology, so getting him exposed to the new digital platforms, getting him an Instagram account, a Snapchat account wasn't very difficult. Seeing around him how many people were using these platforms and how our clients were increasing their usage of all these apps, he decided: 'We definitely need to build stronger digital capabilities in the group quickly. For that, we need a leader, someone at the group level who will have the legitimacy to speak to all the heads of our maisons, to sit with Michael Burke, Sidney Toledano and challenge them so that they would say: okay I know about my bags, but this guy knows about the internet and I respect him. His next question was: 'Do you know someone?'""

That someone turned out to be Ian Rogers, LVMH's chief digital officer who joined the group in 2015 from Apple's music division. ""I remember the first time I saw him, I Skyped with him. He was in LA or San Francisco and after 30 minutes I knew this guy understood all of our challenges, he understood the path to take to cure each of them one-by-one, and he had amazing ideas to innovate as well.""

“Then, I met him in New York for a drink. It was supposed to be a 20-minute drink but lasted two hours. Luckily for us, he agreed to move to Paris to work for us. The [terror] attacks happened two or three weeks after he arrived so it was a rude shock for him, but so far he’s been awesome. He’s changed our culture in many ways, changed the way people see digital; he’s put digital on stage as one of our core focuses at VivaTech,” says Alexandre, referring to LVMH’s new annual technology conference.

One project which became a major focus for Rogers was also near and dear to Arnault’s heart and became their first real collaboration: LVMH’s long-awaited return to multi-brand e-commerce with a site named 24 Sèvres after Paris department store Le Bon Marché’s street address and customer loyalty programme. LVMH may be playing catch up to market leaders like Yoox Net-a-Porter and platform player Farfetch, but Alexandre says the group is thinking ahead — and planning to leverage one of its biggest assets – its retail network. “It’s omnichannel at Le Bon Marché, obviously. But now the vision is way beyond that: to go through stores worldwide. Nothing can really stop us from going there because we own the stores. The brands are also developing omnichannel technologies on their side because they want to have these technologies, and so we just have to plug it in.”

The vision may be big, but Arnault says his father asked him to think about it like any other start-up. “He said, ‘Don’t go to Vuitton and take a bit of their office. Find a guy who is going to be founder and CEO, who is going to build it as a real independent start-up outside of Paris.’ So I went to investigate and I found Eric [Goguey] pretty quickly. He was head of Europe for Sephora.com for seven years. We started to do the business plan and we realised it was going to cost some money and so my father told us, on top of that, ‘make sure you don’t spend a lot of money.’ He gave us an allocated envelope which was very small compared to what we’ve done [before]. And we stuck to it.”

The sense of caution may have stemmed from the group’s failed attempt to enter the multi-brand e-commerce space with e-Luxury, a San Francisco-based multi-brand site owned and operated by the group until 2009, when it was shut down. There was also the spectacular bust of Boo.com, another e-commerce player in which Bernard Arnault was a significant investor. Boo.com burned through $185 million in 18 months in 2000, around the same time as the launches of Net-a-Porter and Yoox, which went on to become big success stories and ultimately merged to become a single company turning over more than $2 billion. But despite the failures of the past, LVMH is trying its hand at multi-brand e-commerce again.

“We wanted to keep it scrappy, iterate, do some A/B testing, be agile. Don’t do like we would have done before,” says Alexandre. “It’s basically a start-up: scrappy, in the 15th arrondissement, IKEA desks, no phones on the tables, everybody coding, free food downstairs, all that type of stuff. It’s funny, today to recruit and retain talent you need all these things. You’re not competing against Procter & Gamble or L’Oréal anymore, you’re competing against Google, Facebook, or even younger start-ups.”

“It’s been a great journey, seeing it start from one employee, Eric and me doing business plans, to another employee coming, to the first discussions with Michael Burke and Sidney Toledano, saying ‘Hey, we have to think about selling our products in multi-brand environments.’ Ultimately, we were on time, on budget, and now it’s just the growth phase that’s starting. It’s a fascinating moment because we’re also able to do something which a lot of people in the market don’t have, which is to build it fresh. Some competitors are 100 times bigger than us, but they’ve built on existing platforms and sometimes it feels a bit clunky.”

His connection to the tech sector has also shaped Arnault’s views on attracting and retaining top talent across the group. “At Rimowa, we’re also trying to build a young culture in the way we make decisions, in the way we motivate people and the way we interact with managers. It’s much more than an HR play, but we’re trying to build something unique which you wouldn’t see in other LVMH brands,” he says. “Fast decisions, for example. Incentives which are different to a regular salary that you might expect, more of a start-up feeling. A stronger company culture based on values. I’m taking inspiration from start-ups and all my start-up friends. I’m not inventing anything new here.”

“Part of why those companies have been successful with Millennials is because they have had these elements of Millennial culture in them, some of them were founded by Millennials. But even those that weren’t founded by Millennials — like BlaBlaCar in Paris — if you go to their office it screams culture. It screams the culture founded by Frédéric [Mazzella]. I think he’s 40 or 45 or something. But we’re going to try to do the same because it’s amazing to have a sentiment of really belonging to a company, belonging to a brand, and also to share that with a customer, ultimately. It’s an ongoing process, of course, but we’re working on that. Hopefully it works and hopefully we get to teach things to the group,” he reflects.

In the role of catalyst, it’s natural that Alexandre has also gleaned important lessons from working alongside his father. “When you’re in this family you kind of develop a passion [for luxury] on its own. Growing up, seeing my father build the empire, and seeing everything happen helps build [an under- standing about] quality and fashion and everything.”

Right now, the path I want to carve for myself is having this company Rimowa and making it as successful as I can.

He continues, “one thing he refers to a lot is the mix of the right and left brain. In order to succeed in this business you need to have not necessarily a creative brain, but at least an understanding of creativity; a respect and love for creativity, which he has obviously. He’s a pianist, he loves art, he loves fashion. He’s also super rational. He has this mix of these two brains... He [has created] something quite unique in the world and he manages to stay humble and very down to earth, very open- minded, very open-hearted as well, listening to people.”

So, what’s Alexandre’s vision for the multi-billion dollar luxury group whose future he is now helping to shape? “That’s the $130 billion dollar question! Building on our brands for the long-term is something that I see us continuing to do for the next hundred years. We have these assets which are unbelievable, which are cherished, and which we have to continue nurturing,” he says.

But with Millennials shifting their spending to experiences and the rise of new “sharing economy” consumption models pioneered by the likes of Uber and Airbnb, Alexandre also knows that simply cherishing the group’s brands will not be enough. What’s more, as Chinese consumers continue to drive not only the vast majority of luxury industry growth, but increasingly shape trends and tastes, LVMH must come to grips with the fact that its brands are largely rooted in a Europe and must adapt as cultural and economic influence swings eastwards to Asia.

How will LVMH cope?

“We must also not get disrupted, being completely aware that disruption exists in many different aspects — design, product, communication, distribution — and keeping an eye on the most meaningful changes to embrace them sooner rather than later. We need to stay at the forefront of innovation in all aspects to keep our leadership [position]. That’s how we want the group to evolve, I think. To be as it is today, but always more innovative.”

Luxury goods multinational LVMH, which looks after brands including Christian Dior, Louis Vuitton and Fendi, has confirmed it has been given planning permission to convert the 157-year-old Jardin d'Acclimatation into one of France's top amusement parks.

Sadly, it won't be fashion-themed, but the 18-hectare space in the Bois de Boulogne, which has been managed by LVMH since 1984, is likely to benefit from the company's substantial input.

LVMH will work in partnership with Compagnie des Alpes, a theme parks and ski resorts developer, to modernise 25 existing rides and add 17 new attractions to the park. The partners aim to convert the current two million visitors a year to three million by 2025.

The park is due to open next spring and instead of a couture influence, LVMH said the overall theme will be a ""steampunk"" spirit that takes inspiration from the 19th century, mixing science fiction with fantasy.

Nature is said to be a focus of the transformation, with an ""ecological promenade"" in the pipeline. The landscaping will also be restructured, drawing inspiration from the park's original design, and perhaps most importantly, the food and drink offering is getting a revamp.

And if visitors want to get a culture fix? The Louis Vuitton Foundation sits right next door.

The future Jardin d'Acclimatation will be completed on May 1, 2018.

Kering and LVMH Join Forces to Protect Runway Models - MEFeater,"Fri, 08 Sep 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiO2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1lZmVhdGVyLmNvbS9rZXJpbmctbHZtaC1wcm90ZWN0LXJ1bndheS1tb2RlbHMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Powerhouse fashion giants, Kering and LVMH, have paired to protect runway models from mistreatment.

In 2015, the French government passed a law that detailed a ban on unhealthily thin models from the catwalk & photoshoots. This would also include any airbrushing added to appear thinner/larger unless accompanied by a clear label of ”retouched photograph” from October of this year.

According to the legislation in question, models would thereafter have to be healthy akin to their respective medical certificate. This would include their BMI measurement. Non-compliant companies, magazines or designers would face a hefty fine of approximately $82,000. Maybe even a 6 month spell in jail!

However, this has taken some time to come into practice. Recent news from companies KERING and LVMH whom own some of the biggest fashion brands e.g. , Gucci, Dior etc. have declared they will abide by the ruling. This means the relevant brands will legally be adhering to the French law passed in 2015. Any models or ambassadors used by them will have to be of a certain condition. In a fairly detailed charter released on Wednesday last, the two companies stated:

Our groups strongly believe that it is our ethical and social responsibility to ensure the well-being of all models working with our Houses. This belief echoes our strong commitment to human rights, respect for diversity and gender equality. Therefore, after consulting industry professionals, we have jointly developed guidelines, which go beyond the legal requirements, in order to ensure that fashion models are always provided with proper working conditions. We hope to see the whole fashion industry follow suit…

The news comes after a series of reports this year regarding mistreatment or false advertising. This was reported of brands that included Yves Saint Laurent, Balenciaga and . You can read Kering and LVMH’s full statement/guidelines here.

The Paris-based group, which owns Louis Vuitton, Christian Dior, Celine, Marc Jacobs, and Givenchy, among other brands, has confirmed that it will invest more to improve its environmental credentials as fashion businesses seek to reassure shoppers who are increasingly drawn to eco-friendly brands.

The Bernard Arnault-owned conglomerate confirmed that – among other efforts – its brands will allocate 30 euros to an in-house carbon fund for every ton of CO2 emissions they generate from 2018, up from 15 euros in years prior. Those funds will be earmarked for insulating buildings and other projects. As noted by Reuters, representatives for “LVMH said that it is also working on other steps, such as raising the share of leather goods sourced from strictly monitored tanneries to 70 percent by 2020.”

“Our clients are more and more sensitive to the fact the products they consume should respect the environment,” Arnault told journalists on Wednesday. “Our partners and clients are very attached to this aspect and it seemed logical to make a shift and talk about it a little more.”

It comes as little surprise that LVMH has decided to publicly take on sustainability. One of its closest rivals, Paris-based Kering – which owns Gucci, Balenciaga, YSL, and Alexander McQueen, etc. – has, for years, publicized its sustainability targets as part of a larger “360° approach” within its own operations and across the entire supply chain.

Kering’s reps reiterated early this year that the group is dedicated to continuing to reduce its environmental impacts, advocate social welfare inside and outside the group, and create innovative, game-changing platforms.

In addition to a rise in consumer awareness as to how, where, and by whom their clothing is being made, “what motivates these luxury groups to be more and more vigilant is that they run a reputational risk,” Olivier Abtan of Boston Consulting Group told Reuters.

An increasing number of companies have been plagued with bad press in recent years for their exploitative working conditions and/or the use of fabrics or manufacturing processes that encourage pollution. Early this year LVMH, itself, came under fire for its sourcing practices, after People for The Ethical Treatment of Animals released footage taken inside several crocodile farms in Vietnam depicting the horrific way in which the animals’ skins are harvested.

Moreover, according to Kering’s chief sustainability officer, Marie-Claire Daveu, going green is simply good for business. Customers are not the ones to convince that the company’s commitment to sustainability is worthy, Daveu told Quartz last year. “Investors, these kind of people are more and more convinced by sustainability—even if they don’t use the word sustainability—but for them it’s a risk management approach.”

Luxury brands – which tend to fiercely guard their manufacturing practices and other supply chain information as valuable trade secrets – are consistently slammed by industry rankings as a result of their penchant for being tight-lipped.

Widely-publicized reports, such as those being peddled by Rank a Brand (which releases a ranking on companies’ levels of cotton sustainability) and Know The Chain (which looks at human trafficking and forced labor in companies’ supply chains), for instance, consistently down-grade luxury brands for failing to provide information regarding their sustainability efforts. With that in mind, these rankings often favor notoriously unsustainable mass-market fast fashion brands over high fashion ones, thanks to the willingness of fast fashion brands to share such information.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9887633323669434}",neutral,0.9887633323669434,0
LVMH and Kering ban use of size zero models on catwalk - Yahoo Finance,"Wed, 06 Sep 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9zaXplLTAtbW9kZWxzLW5vdy1iYW5uZWQtc2V2ZXJhbC1tYWpvci1mYXNoaW9uLXNob3dzLTE1NTUyOTA5MS5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The companies behind Gucci, Saint Laurent, Dior, and other brands have banned size zero models on their catwalks. (Photo: Getty)

French fashion powerhouses LVMH and Kering announced today that size zero models will no longer be allowed in their catwalk shows and photo shoots.

The conglomerates — which own the likes of Gucci, Saint Laurent, Louis Vuitton, and Dior — have vowed to stop the promotion of ultra-thin body ideals.

They have unveiled a charter “to ensure the well-being of models.” In addition to banning size zero models from appearing in their fashion shows, LVMH and Kering have also banned girls younger than 16 from doing work where they would be representing adults.

The news comes the day before the official start of New York Fashion Week. Kering CEO François-Henri Pinault said the companies would like to move quickly and make changes, leading many to believe the move will mark a different approach to this season’s Paris Fashion Week.

Paris has typically been home to some of the worst offenders in the size zero debate, making this decision an important one in the fashion industry.

Pinault added that he hoped the ban would prompt others in the industry to follow suit.

France is fast becoming one of the leaders in ensuring the health of models. This year, the country banned the use of unhealthily thin models after the fashion industry was accused of encouraging eating disorders such as anorexia.

Models working in France are now required to provide a doctor’s certificate which states that their BMI (body mass index) indicates they are healthy enough to work.

Paris-based magazines are also now legally obliged to note when a photo of a model has been edited. If they don’t, they could face a fine of as much as $45,000.

Keeper of the Flame: LVMH's Bernard Arnault - WWD,"Tue, 26 Sep 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3dkLmNvbS9mYXNoaW9uLW5ld3MvZGVzaWduZXItbHV4dXJ5L2Rpb3ItbWlsZXN0b25lLWJlcm5hcmQtYXJuYXVsdC1sdm1oLTEwOTkyNDU0L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS — From the moment he acquired the brand in 1984 to its recent integration into the LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton empire, Christian Dior has held a special significance for French luxury magnate Bernard Arnault.

On the 70th anniversary of the house, the LVMH chairman and chief executive officer reflected on the lessons of the founder and set out his confident vision for Dior’s future.

WWD: Seventy years after it was founded, what is Dior’s position in the global luxury firmament?

Bernard Arnault: The house of Dior holds a very unique position in the world of luxury. I often tell a story that happened to me in 1971 while I studied in the U.S.: I was chatting with a cab driver who expressed a great love and fascination for France. I asked him if the name Georges Pompidou, who was then the president of the French Republic, meant anything to him. His answer: “I’m afraid not, but I know Christian Dior.” By then, Mr. Dior had been dead for 15 years, Marc Bohan was the creative director and, I will add, he was dressing the first lady, Claude Pompidou! This anecdote has stayed with me to this day as the perfect illustration of the extraordinary power and romance associated with the name of a designer of this magnitude. If you ask most people around the globe what first comes to mind when they think of France, they will tell you fashion, and if you think fashion, you immediately think Dior. Fifteen years went by and the opportunity to acquire Christian Dior Couture presented itself to me and today, every time I visit one of our boutiques anywhere in the world, I can feel the same unique excitement and fascination for this house and its legendary name.

WWD: Which aspects of the personality and strategy of the founder Christian Dior do you find most impressive and inspiring?

B.A.: It is hard to single out one or the other. Christian Dior was a visionary and this goes far beyond fashion. His first show, referred to as the New Look, was not just a revolution in style, but also a complete societal signifier. He was extremely in sync with his era, with the deep and profound aspirations of society at that time of fundamental changes, and he provided an answer to some of the questions that were shaping social aspirations at that moment. He did this with his own language and form of expression, but he also put extremely articulate words to it and explained in many ways the path that led him to this very inspired concept of “civilized happiness.” He gave lectures about it, wrote books, he was tireless about the subject. Isn’t this the sign of true genius?

I am also deeply connected to his passion for art. We cannot forget that he was a gallerist before he became a couturier and remained a collector throughout his life. I share with him a tremendous admiration for Picasso and for the [Alberto] Giacometti sculptures he exhibited as a gallery owner, but also a great passion for music and architecture.

Christian Dior was also the precursor of global luxury as we experience it today. His vision for luxury was an amazing curation of French art de vivre, which he elevated and globalized as a symbol of refinement and cultural excellence. He presented his first perfume and his first haute couture collection on the same day, Feb. 12, 1947. This conscious decision carries in itself the founding principles of what was to become transversal luxury — an idea that has carried the house through its development to this day through jewelry, cosmetics, ready-to-wear, men’s wear, children’s wear and high jewelry.

Then, in 1947, he immediately thought of global expansion, taking his collections first to the U.S. and then around the world. Our entire industry still operates under these principles that he initiated so long ago.

WWD: Dior was highly innovative in how he built a brand in a transversal and international way. Do you think this approach remains a pertinent one for luxury brands in general today?

B.A.: The very daring vision of Christian Dior in 1947 is not only the prevalent model on which luxury houses have developed ever since, but it was also prescient of the fact that the world was becoming smaller and is now a global market.

WWD: At the same time, technology has completely rewritten consumption. What kind of measures does Dior need to take in order to anticipate the 21st-century client’s needs?

B.A.: New technologies have always been the main change agent in the behavior of consumers and the house of Dior has always been on the forefront of this transformation by anticipating our clients’ expectations, whether it be in communicating with them or on the retail side. It is this very delicate balance between the most elevated tradition of excellence, what we call savoir faire, which is inherent to luxury, and an inextinguishable curiosity for everything new and transformative. Dior is a house with an unwavering sense of its past and a very defined path forward.

WWD: You have completed an important operation to bring Christian Dior Couture back under the control of LVMH. What was your motivation behind this?

B.A.: The purchase of Christian Dior Couture by LVMH has allowed us to simplify the structure. It also marks the strength of the family group within one of the greatest French companies. On a more personal level, it is also a testimony to my deep attachment to this house.

WWD: What is the integration of the brand’s fashion and perfume/cosmetics activities likely to change for Dior? Do you think that an evolution in the organization or management of the brand is necessary?

B.A.: The unification of the fashion activities with the brand’s cosmetic and fragrance division is another reminder of our founder’s philosophy: both are linked, without distinction. It will bring even more cohesiveness to the brand in vision and image, allowing all necessary resources to join in the common goal of a seamless development.

WWD: What are your ambitions for the Dior brand? Some analysts say it has the potential to generate revenues comparable to those of Louis Vuitton today. Is that conceivable?

B.A.: I have always had great ambitions for the house of Dior. The potential for further growth is tremendous. The extraordinary interest and fervor for our exhibition in Paris at the Musée des Arts Décoratifs, “Christian Dior: Designer of Dreams,” serves as a reminder of the tremendous and unadulterated power this name holds in the collective memory.

WWD: What is your watchword for the Dior teams today?

B.A.: Be creative.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.996070384979248}",neutral,0.996070384979248,0
LVMH Is Opening a £53 Million Theme Park in Paris - ELLE UK,"Wed, 06 Sep 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVsbGUuY29tL3VrL2Zhc2hpb24vbmV3cy9hMzgzNjAvbHZtaC1vcGVuaW5nLXRoZW1lLXBhcmstcGFyaXMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Remember your excitement as child when you saw Mickey Mouse and Minnie at the doors of Disneyland?

Well, forget the cartoon mice for a second. The latest theme park is all about adults indulging their thrills in style with the opening of a £53 million ($70 million) theme park from the multinational luxury powerhouse that owns Marc Jacobs, Fendi, Louis Vuitton.

Condé Nast Traveler reports LVMH has been granted planning permission to convert Paris's 157 year-old, 18-hectare Jardin d'Acclimatation into the capital's newest attraction.

However, if you're hoping for Marc Jacobs-inspired cupcake rides and a Fendi-printed house of horrors, think again.

The publication reports that rumours suggest the rides will take inspiration from 'steampunk', rather than couture, with a focus on steam-powered machines that inspired the inside of Doctor Who's Tardis and the design ethic of the hit 2015 action film Mad Max.

While the theme park's new look might seem to be somewhat of a departure for the luxury brand, it kinds of makes sense given the fact LVMH has cared for the Jardin d'Acclimatation since the mid-1980s and holds an 80 per cent stake in theme park development company, Compagnie des Alpes.

Reuters reports that work on the theme park was scheduled to commence on 4 September and will last until 1 May 2018.

The plan is to build 17 new attractions in the Jardine and make the theme park the second most visited attraction in France after Disneyland Paris.

Grab your Fendi bags, people, there's a LVMH rollercoaster ride with your name on it.

"French fashion giants LVMH, Kering ban ultra-thin models - WION","Wed, 06 Sep 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndpb25ld3MuY29tL3dvcmxkL2ZyZW5jaC1sdXh1cnktZmFzaGlvbi1naWFudHMtbHZtaC1hbmQta2VyaW5nLWJhbi11bHRyYS10aGluLW1vZGVscy0xOTkzMdIBamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndpb25ld3MuY29tL3dvcmxkL2ZyZW5jaC1sdXh1cnktZmFzaGlvbi1naWFudHMtbHZtaC1hbmQta2VyaW5nLWJhbi11bHRyYS10aGluLW1vZGVscy0xOTkzMS9hbXA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"New York Fashion Week starts tomorrow and a group of French-owned fashion labels has pledged to ban ultra-thin models from their advertising and catwalk shows. This comes as a response to criticism that the industry encourages anorexia.

Fashion labels spanning from Christian Dior to Saint Laurent have pledged to fight against this image and spread the message of ""love your own skin"" ""to ensure the well-being of models"".

The group forms the industry's biggest holding companies of luxury fashion brands, LVMH (LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE) and Kering.

In a statement to AFP, François-Henri Pinault, Kering group chairman said, ""Respecting the dignity of all women has always been both a personal commitment and a priority for Kering as a group.

""We hope to inspire the entire industry to follow suit, thus making a real difference in the working conditions of fashion models industry-wide.""

Along with banning of ultra-thin models, the group plans on unveiling a charter that will outlaw the hiring of girls under the age of 16 for adult shoots or events.

Year 2017 has witnessed some of the most noteworthy measures taken up by the industry bigwigs to keep a check on the health of models who stretch far too much while making their mark in the industry.

In May, a French law was introduced that now requires models to present a doctor's certificate attesting to their good health while applying for a job.

This is a scathing attack on the idea of desirable thinness and unattainable beauty ideals, that models have had to strive to achieve. The two French groups now want to go beyond these unsaid dictated norms and want to use female models who are size 34 or over according to the French system and men sized 44 or more.

In France, size 32 corresponds to XXS or size 6 in Britain and size 0 in the US.

The charter includes other measures such as banning the serving of alcohol to models under 18 and ensuring they have a guardian or chaperone present at all times.

Antoine Arnault, a board member of LVMH and son of owner Bernard Arnault, in a statement, said, ""As the leader in the luxury sector, we believe it is our role to be at the forefront of this initiative.

""We have the responsibility of building new standards for fashion and we hope to be followed by other players in our sector.""

LVMH or LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE is a multinational luxury goods conglomerate that owns classic French brands such as Louis Vuitton, Christian Dior and Givenchy as well as other high-end European names including Fendi and Marc Jacobs.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999215602874756}",neutral,0.9999215602874756,0

Luxury fashion groups Kering and LVMH — which together own brands like Louis Vuitton, Christian Dior and Gucci — wrote a charter to make sure their models work under safe conditions.

The charter bans size 0 casting requirements and requires agencies to prove models are healthy enough to work. On set, brands are also now required to provide psychologists or therapists for models while they're at work.

Other new rules in the charter guarantee models the right to safe accommodations and require they ""explicitly accept"" assignments that involve nudity or changes to their appearance.

These new rules come months after a pair of casting directors reportedly left 150 models waiting in a dark stairwell for hours during Paris Fashion Week. The incident was called ""sadistic and cruel.""

Balenciaga — which is owned by Kering — fired the accused casting directors and wrote a formal apology to affected modeling agencies. The fashion brand also vowed to ensure respectful working conditions in the future.

Beyond industry abuse, Kering and LVMH's new charter also comes months after France's ban on ""unhealthily thin"" models went into effect. The French health ministry said it hopes the move will fight eating disorders and ""inaccessible ideals of beauty.""

Plenty of studies from the past couple years have suggested that exposure to super-thin models in the media has a negative impact on women's mental health. And in a recent study about the pressure on models to lose weight, an overwhelming majority of the 85 models in the study were medically underweight.

More than half the models who participated in that study said they were told by someone in the modeling industry to lose weight or change their body shape.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9979788661003113}",neutral,0.9979788661003113,0

French luxury conglomerates LVMH and Kering have joined forces to create a common charter that determines how the groups will work with fashion models in the future.

The goal is ostensibly to ensure the well being of the models and reflect the values of the luxury brands under their umbrellas. The statement comes a day after The New York Times ran an article that spelled out several concerns expressed by models, including objectification, sexism, racism and loss of dignity.

Here is LVMH and Kering’s joint statement issued this morning in its entirety:

Kering and LVMH have decided to establish a charter for the well being of models that will be implemented throughout all their brands.

Respecting the dignity of every man and woman is at the heart of both group’s values. Having always cared for the well being of models, LVMH and Kering feel that they have a specific responsibility, as leaders in the industry, to go one step further with their brands.

This charter, which is applicable worldwide, reflects high standards of integrity, responsibility and respect for those concerned. On top of paying particular attention to ensuring good working conditions for models, it is structured around several major commitments:

 Brands of both groups commit to working solely with models able to present a valid medical certificate, attesting to their good health and ability to work, obtained less than six months before the shooting or the fashion show.

 All fashion brands belonging to LVMH and Kering commit to banning size 32 for women and size 42 for men (French measurement) from their casting requirements. Casting agencies will be required to present female and male models who are size 34 or over, and size 44 or over, respectively. To further ensure the care of models, it will be incumbent upon the brands to put a dedicated psychologist/therapist at their disposal during their working time.

 Models below the age of 16 must not be hired by brands to take part in shows or shootings representing an adult.

 16- to 18-year-old models are subject to specific rules:

o They are not permitted to work between 10 p.m. and 6 a.m.

o The presence of a chaperon/guardian—who can be one of the model’s parents—appointed by their agency is mandatory for models aged 16 to 18, and any model under the age of 18 must be housed in the same accommodation as their chaperon/guardian.

o The charter requires brands to ask agencies to ensure that models meet their school attendance obligations.

 Models must have the possibility of making a direct complaint in the case of a dispute with a modeling agency, a casting director or a brand (e.g. through the designation of a contact person or the setting up of a hotline)

“Respecting the dignity of all women has always been both a personal commitment for me and a priority for Kering as a Group. Through the establishment of this charter and our commitment to abide by its terms, we are once again manifesting the importance of this core value in a very concrete manner. We hope to inspire the entire industry to follow suit, thus making a real difference in the working conditions of fashion models industry-wide,” declared François-Henri Pinault, chairman/CEO of Kering.

“I am deeply committed to ensuring that the working relationship between LVMH Group brands, agencies and models goes beyond simply complying with the legal requirements. The well being of models is of great importance to us. As the leader in the luxury sector, we believe it is our role to be at the forefront of this initiative. We have the responsibility of building new standards for fashion and we hope to be followed by other players in our sector,” declared Antoine Arnault, member of the LVMH board of directors, chairman of Loro Piana and CEO of Berluti.

The implementation of this charter will start during the upcoming Fashion Weeks. A monitoring committee, made up of representatives of the brands, agencies and models, will meet each year (once every six months for the first year).

Kering

A global luxury group, Kering develops an ensemble of luxury houses in fashion, leather goods, jewelry and watches: Gucci, Bottega Veneta, Saint Laurent, Alexander McQueen, Balenciaga, Brioni, Christopher Kane, McQ, Stella McCartney, Tomas Maier, Boucheron, Dodo, Girard-Perregaux, Pomellato, Qeelin and Ulysse Nardin. Kering is also developing the sport and lifestyle brands Puma, Volcom and Cobra. By “empowering imagination,” Kering encourages its brands to reach their potential, in the most sustainable manner.

LVMH

LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton is represented in wines and spirits by a portfolio of brands that includes Moët & Chandon, Dom Pérignon, Veuve Clicquot Ponsardin, Krug, Ruinart, Mercier, Château d’Yquem, Domaine du Clos des Lambrays, Château Cheval Blanc, Hennessy, Glenmorangie, Ardbeg, Belvedere, Woodinville, Chandon, Cloudy Bay, Terrazas de los Andes, Cheval des Andes, Cape Mentelle, Newton, Bodega Numanthia and Ao Yun.

"LVMH Buys Into South Korean Eyewear Brand, Gentle Monster - The Fashion Law","Fri, 08 Sep 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWZhc2hpb25sYXcuY29tL2x2bWgtYnV5cy1pbnRvLXNvdXRoLWtvcmVhbi1leWV3ZWFyLWJyYW5kLWdlbnRsZS1tb25zdGVyL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LVMH’s private equity arm has invested in South Korean sunglasses brand, Gentle Monster, banking on the Korean pop culture boom to fuel sales of the country’s luxury brands. Ravi Thakran, chairman and managing partner of L Catterton Asia, told Reuters that the LVMH company “has become the second-biggest shareholder of IICOMBINED, the owner and operator of Gentle Monster, after its two founders.”

Thakran did not confirm the value of the transaction. However, media speculation suggests that it could be worth about 60 billion won ($53.17 million). Per Thakran, the investment will serve to kick-start a strategy to grow the company into a billion-dollar business over the next six to eight years, up from the nearly $200 million it does now. “I believe that across Asia there are only about six to eight brands that can achieve this level of notoriety, with a unique image, that’s differentiated among lifestyle brands,” he told WWD.

The deal comes a little over a year after L Capital Asia, LVMH’s investment arm, took a minority stake in South Korea’s CLIO Cosmetics, swelling the ranks of global investors placing a bet on booming demand for Korean beauty products in major markets like China. And still yet, that move is not all that surprising of we consider L Capital Asia’s $80 million investment in K-pop talent agency YG Entertainment in 2014.

Thakran says L Capital Asia’s existing stake in YG will prove beneficial in further growing Gentle Monster. “YG is the leading name in the sector, [representing] G-Dragon, Psy,” he told WWD. “It’s the number-one modeling agency, it’s the number-one television drama producer. Each of those arenas is a gateway. The founders of those two companies [YG and Gentle Monster] are good friends and they both have great respect for each other. Even before we completed our investment they already had been in talks with the South Korean stars of YG.”

Founded in 2011 by Jay Oh and Hankook Kim, Gentle Monster surged in popularity in South Korea and China – traditionally dominated by Western luxury brands – after South Korea actress Jeon Ji-hyun wore its sunglasses in the popular drama “My Love from the Star.”

The brand, which has collaborated with everyone from actress Tilda Swinton to brands, such as Hood by Air, Henrik Vibskov, to influencer Aimee Song, is part of a new guard that is making waves in South Korea, with an array of young brands helping to not only keep Korean fashion – an industry that has already brought in billions of dollars from pop-cultural exports to the West – firmly on the map but to elevate it even further in the eyes of international consumers.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9998855590820312}",neutral,0.9998855590820312,0
French fashion giants agree to ban size 0 models - Press Herald,"Wed, 06 Sep 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnByZXNzaGVyYWxkLmNvbS8yMDE3LzA5LzA2L2ZyZW5jaC1mYXNoaW9uLWdpYW50cy1hZ3JlZS10by1iYW4tc2l6ZS0wLW1vZGVscy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS — Two of the world’s biggest luxury goods conglomerates announced a joint charter Wednesday which they said aims to protect the health of fashion models by making those who are unhealthily thin ineligible to work.

The pact adopted by French corporations LVMH and Kering incorporates – and goes beyond – a new French law that requires all models to provide medical certificates proving they are healthy before they can work.

While the French law set to take effect Oct. 1 requires both male and female models to present a health certificate obtained within the previous two years, LVMH and Kering said their charter would shorten the time frame to six months of the job.

The pact also bans the conglomerates’ labels from using female models below a French women’s size 34, which is typically equivalent to a U.S. size 0-2 and a U.K. size 6. The French law initially included a minimum body mass index requirement, but it was removed after lawmakers deemed the doctor’s certificate an adequate safeguard.

The fashion companies’ said their agreement would take effect this month, in time for the spring-summer ready-to-wear runway collections.

Unlike the French law, the charter also will apply to the international Kering and LVMH brands with runway collections presented in Milan, London and New York. The two groups said they hoped to set a new global standard for the fashion industry.

“We hope to inspire the entire industry to follow suit, thus making a real difference in the working conditions of fashion models industry-wide,” Kering CEO Francois-Henri Pinault said in a statement.

In addition, the charter requires each brand to put a dedicated psychologist at the disposal of fashion models during working hours – either by phone or in person in the work place.

A monitoring committee of representatives from Kering and LVMH will meet annually with brands, modeling agencies and models to ensure the charter is being correctly implemented.

The two giants’ fashion houses include Dior, Kenzo, Stella McCartney, Saint Laurent, Gucci, Louis Vuitton, Marc Jacobs and others.

LVMH and Kering ban use of size zero models on catwalk - Yahoo Life,"Wed, 06 Sep 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnlhaG9vLmNvbS9saWZlc3R5bGUvc2l6ZS0wLW1vZGVscy1ub3ctYmFubmVkLXNldmVyYWwtbWFqb3ItZmFzaGlvbi1zaG93cy0xNTU1MjkwOTEuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The companies behind Gucci, Saint Laurent, Dior, and other brands have banned size zero models on their catwalks.

French fashion powerhouses LVMH and Kering announced today that size zero models will no longer be allowed in their catwalk shows and photo shoots.

The conglomerates — which own the likes of Gucci, Saint Laurent, Louis Vuitton, and Dior — have vowed to stop the promotion of ultra-thin body ideals.

They have unveiled a charter “to ensure the well-being of models.” In addition to banning size zero models from appearing in their fashion shows, LVMH and Kering have also banned girls younger than 16 from doing work where they would be representing adults.

The news comes the day before the official start of New York Fashion Week. Kering CEO François-Henri Pinault said the companies would like to move quickly and make changes, leading many to believe the move will mark a different approach to this season’s Paris Fashion Week.

Paris has typically been home to some of the worst offenders in the size zero debate, making this decision an important one in the fashion industry.

Pinault added that he hoped the ban would prompt others in the industry to follow suit.

France is fast becoming one of the leaders in ensuring the health of models. This year, the country banned the use of unhealthily thin models after the fashion industry was accused of encouraging eating disorders such as anorexia.

Models working in France are now required to provide a doctor’s certificate which states that their BMI (body mass index) indicates they are healthy enough to work.

Paris-based magazines are also now legally obliged to note when a photo of a model has been edited. If they don’t, they could face a fine of as much as $45,000.

LVMH acquired the brand in 2004 and installed industry turnaround artist Jean-Claude Biver at its helm. Now president of the LVMH Watch Division and chairman of Hublot, Biver embraced Hublot’s contemporary essence and amped it up with big, bold designs using avant-garde materials at stratospheric prices.

Realizing he could never convert older, conservative enthusiasts who would stay loyal to established marques, he pursued a new generation that is more open to an unconventional alternative. To build that following, he turned to the internet and social media. Big-money sports sponsorships, such as 2014’s FIFA World Cup, and partnerships with champion athletes such as Usain Bolt, plus the coup of clinching a deal with Ferrari raised the once-obscure brand’s profile considerably. According to LVMH’s 2016 financial report, last year was its most successful ever.

Hublot’s headquarters in Nyon, Switzerland, opened in 2009. Only six years later it was expanded with a second building across nearby railroad tracks, doubling its production capacity. A sleek Formula One–style bridge that arches over the tracks links the H1 and H2 buildings.

Like most premium brands, Hublot leverages cutting-edge technology, including automated electro-spark and CNC milling machines for producing componentry, while centuries-old crafts like finishing and assembly are still performed the old-fashioned way, by hand.

“Hublot can be defined by disruptive, unaccessible luxury,” says Biver. “That’s Hublot! It’s unaccessible because the price is completely crazy. Then, not only is it a crazy price, but the watch is crazy in itself in the way it’s disruptive—it’s not what you would expect.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999439716339111}",neutral,0.9999439716339111,0

LVMH and Kering said their designers could no longer use size 32 models under the French system - sizes XXS or size zero in the US or size 4 Britain - and only use those size 34 or over.

Males models would need to be size 44 or over.

Unveiling a charter ""to ensure the well-being of models"", the French companies also banned brands from hiring models aged under 16 ""to take part in shows or shootings representing an adult"".

Models aged 16 to 18 will not be allowed to work between 10pm and 6am and must be accompanied by a guardian or chaperone who is housed with them during jobs.

Their agencies must also ensure the models meet their school attendance obligations.

The pledge ""to go one step further"" to ""ensuring good working conditions for models"" comes ahead of the start of New York Fashion week.

It also includes other health and safety measures, such as banning the serving of alcohol to models aged under 18.

""I am deeply committed to ensuring that the working relationship between LVMH Group brands, agencies and models goes beyond simply complying with the legal requirements. The well-being of models is of great importance to us,"" said Antoine Arnault, board member of LVMH and son of owner Bernard Arnault.

""As the leader in the luxury sector, we believe it is our role to be at the forefront of this initiative.

Henri Pinault, chairman and CEO of Kering, added: ""We hope to inspire the entire industry to follow suit, thus making a real difference in the working conditions of fashion models industry-wide.""

Last year, a Gucci advert was banned by Britain's advertising watchdog because it featured a model leaning up against a wall who appeared ""unhealthily thin"" and ""gaunt"".

Gucci told the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) the advert was aimed at an older, sophisticated audience and that it felt the model appeared ""toned and slim"".

However, the ASA concluded the ad was ""irresponsible"".","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.99993896484375}",neutral,0.99993896484375,0
Size-zero ban is proof fashion industry is finally listening to customers - The Guardian,"Wed, 06 Sep 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9mYXNoaW9uLzIwMTcvc2VwLzA2L3NpemUtemVyby1iYW4tcHJvb2YtZmFzaGlvbi1pbmR1c3RyeS1saXN0ZW5pbmctY3VzdG9tZXJzLWx2bWgta2VyaW5n0gF0aHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAudGhlZ3VhcmRpYW4uY29tL2Zhc2hpb24vMjAxNy9zZXAvMDYvc2l6ZS16ZXJvLWJhbi1wcm9vZi1mYXNoaW9uLWluZHVzdHJ5LWxpc3RlbmluZy1jdXN0b21lcnMtbHZtaC1rZXJpbmc?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The use of size zero models has been a fashion industry scandal for 15 years. The announcement that rival Paris powerhouses LVMH and Kering have joined forces to end the practice is proof of an industry finally being held to account by the clothes-buying public.

Will their charter succeed in improving model health, after previous initiatives failed? It is too early to say. But the move is encouraging evidence of how fashion is being gradually democratised.

Social media has provided a platform for less powerful industry players – models, and consumer critics – who were effectively locked out of an elitist world in which designers dictated how women should look but accepted no accountability for the physical demands placed by a 23in waistband. With power comes responsibility. Finally, fashion is facing that maxim.



But there is more to unpick here about fashion’s internal power balance. A decade ago, designers at Paris fashion week were treated as deities; it would have been unrealistic for company bosses to dictate which models they should use. But in the six years since John Galliano dragged the name of Christian Dior into disrepute, the luxury giants have largely reined in the power and status of the designers they hire.

Talented, dependable, down-to-earth design studio veterans are now first in line for the top jobs, not eccentrics and mavericks. And while the de facto clout of designers has waned, the power of models has rocketed. Today’s top catwalk models command commercial leverage of which 1990s supermodels could only have dreamt. (Linda Evangelista, famously, didn’t get out of bed for less than £10,000; today’s Insta-models could charge a designer pyjama brand ten times that to post a selfie on Instagram, without getting up.)

The momentum behind the LVMH-Kering charter came partly from the most fashionable power-couple in Paris: Antoine Arnault of LVMH and his supermodel wife Natalia Vodianova. Arnault referred to Vodianova in announcing the charter, saying: “My wife … said all these problems already existed 15 years ago, except that models didn’t have social networks to talk about them and try to effect change … We can really thank social networks for lifting the lid on a lot of things we would not have tolerated in the past if they had been public knowledge.”

The significance of the charter is that it moves on a debate that had long been muted by endless buck-passing. Models say casting agents demand tiny measurements; casting agents respond by saying that the sample sizes produced for the catwalk require them. Readers criticise magazines for showcasing skinny models; editors reciprocate by arguing that anything outside of the supermodel aesthetic causes newsstand sales to plunge. Consumers speak of feeling pressurised to diet by images of very thin models; models report that they have been trolled or body-shamed for being skinny.

Fashion did not invent size zero – the phrase emerged in LA in the early 1990s to describe the desired shape of aspiringHollywood actors. And negative body image is a problem that extends far beyond the Paris catwalks. But just as fashion is part of the problem, it must be part of the solution.

Francois-Henri Pinault of Kering has taken the bold step of drawing a direct link between fashion and anorexia. “A lot of people know – as I do – people affected by the scourge of anorexia,” he told Womenswear Daily. “This represents an important advance in tackling the issue of excessive thinness and in particular anorexia in our profession.”

Accepting that responsibility lies with brands, this charter is not penalising women for being thin, but cracking down on an industry in which catwalk samples are produced in sizes that require already-slim women to starve themselves.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9860634207725525}",neutral,0.9860634207725525,0
French fashion firms pledge to stop using underage and size zero models - The Guardian,"Wed, 06 Sep 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9mYXNoaW9uLzIwMTcvc2VwLzA2L2ZyZW5jaC1mYXNoaW9uLWdpYW50cy1wbGVkZ2UtdG8tc3RvcC11c2luZy11bmRlcmFnZS1hbmQtc2l6ZS16ZXJvLW1vZGVsc9IBeGh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9mYXNoaW9uLzIwMTcvc2VwLzA2L2ZyZW5jaC1mYXNoaW9uLWdpYW50cy1wbGVkZ2UtdG8tc3RvcC11c2luZy11bmRlcmFnZS1hbmQtc2l6ZS16ZXJvLW1vZGVscw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"France’s top fashion houses have pledged to stop underage and size zero models from featuring in catwalk shows and advertising campaigns.

The move, which comes on the eve of New York fashion week, was announced by French luxury groups LVMH and Kering, owners of some of the biggest labels in haute couture including Saint Laurent, Louis Vuitton, Christian Dior and Gucci.



The industry has long been accused of promoting unhealthy body images to women and ignoring well-documented health problems experienced by models. This year the French government voted through a law requiring models to have a medical certificate confirming they were not dangerously underweight.

The LVMH-Kering Charter on working relations and the well-being of models bans certain designers from featuring women who wear the French size 32 – a size zero in the US. Female models must be at least a French size 34 (US size 2; UK size 6) and male models a French size 44 (internationally labelled as XXS).



It added: “No model under 16 years will be recruited to take part in fashion shows or photographic sessions representing adults.”



Antoine Arnault, son of LMVH director Bernard Arnault and a member of the company’s management, said: “A young girl of 15 years old does not have the necessary experience to deal with the difficult world of modelling.”



François-Henri Pinault, son of Kering owner François Pinault, added: “We wanted to move quickly and hit hard so that things really change. We’re trying to persuade as many others in our profession to follow us.”



Kering and LVMH said the rules would apply to all companies in their groups.



“The two groups are placing respect for and the dignity of women at the heart of their values: that’s why we’ve always had, in particular, the wellbeing of the models we work with in mind,” it said.



“The two groups have agreed to only work with models who hold a valid medical certificate proving their good health and ability to work, which must have been obtained in the six months before a photo session or show.”



As well as banning underage models, those between 16-18 years will no longer be allowed to work between 11pm and 6am and must be accompanied by a parent or chaperone if required to stay away from home.



“The wellbeing of our models is a fundamental subject,” the statement from LVMH read.



A bill approved by the French parliament in December 2015, that came into effect this year, made it obligatory for models working in France to obtain a medical certificate to prove they are healthy, with fines handed out to those who don’t. The bill also obliged magazines to flag up photographs that had been touched up or Photoshopped.



In France, up to 40,000 people – most of them adolescent women – have anorexia nervosa, an eating disorder with a high mortality rate.



Eric Perceval, secretary general of the French Federation of Model Agencies, welcomed the charter and the new rules, saying modelling agencies had been unfairly blamed in the past.

“Until now all they (agencies) have done is respond to the requirements of the clients … agencies have never been the ones who’ve had the final decision over what model will do what advertising campaign or show. All they’ve done is propose models they think correspond to the clients’ criteria,” Perceval said in a statement to the Guardian.

However, he said he did not believe the measures would reduce cases of anorexia, which he added “is an illness that existed before the development of the fashion industry … To criticise models and designers as causes of anorexia is a refusal to understand the real source of eating disorders.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9997301697731018}",neutral,0.9997301697731018,0

The multinational luxury-goods conglomerate has been helping manage the park since 1984, holding an 80 per cent stake in a partnership with theme-park and ski-resort developer Compagnie des Alpes. The park offers rides, play areas, horseback riding, workshops and events.

Paris officials last year renewed LVMH’s concession for the 18ha park in the west of the city, opening the way for a renovation of the garden and its attractions. The concession contract runs for 25 years.

Work has already started and will continue until May 1. There will be 17 new attractions, some with a steampunk theme.

Compagnie des Alpes and LVMH, controlled by Bernard Arnault, want to raise annual visitor numbers to about 3 million by 2025 from the present 2 million. This would position the attraction behind Disneyland Paris but ahead of Parc Astérix.

“Our goal is for Jardin d’Acclimatation to rank second or third among theme parks in France,” says Compagnie des Alpes head of development Delphine Pons.

Early this year Arnault unveiled plans to renovate a disused public building near his Louis Vuitton Foundation, which is next to Jardin d’Acclimatation. Vacant since 2005, the Musée National des Arts et Traditions Populaires was built in 1972. The billionaire aims to turn it into an arts and crafts centre in a €158 million revamp by architect Frank Gehry.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999985694885254}",neutral,0.9999985694885254,0

[THE INVESTOR] L Catterton Asia, a global private equity firm backed by French luxury fashion house LVMH Group, has inked a new partnership deal with Gentle Monster, a Korean sunglass and eyewear brand that is enjoying huge popularity in Asia, especially China.



The company's chairman and managing partner Ravi Thakran on Sept. 7 confirmed the deal that would make it the second-largest shareholder in the Korean firm. He declined to reveal the exact size of the investment but sources predict about 60 billion won (US$53 million) has been newly invested.







Ravi Thakran





In March, L Catterton acquired a sizeable stake worth an estimated 200 billion won (US$177 million) in Gentle Monster’s parent company IICOMBINED, formerly Snoop Buy.



“We are not in a hurry for the firm’s IPO,” Thakran told The Investor on the rumored stock debut of the parent company.



“The Gentle Monster’s management is busy for growth now.”



Gentle Monster, launched in 2011 with an initial capital of 50 million, has grown into a leading sunglass brand with attractive designs and competitive pricing. Buoyed by its upbeat overseas sales, IICOMBINED has been preparing for a listing on the local stock market for higher valuation.



Thakran dismissed any concerns about diplomatic tensions between Seoul and Beijing affecting the brand’s business expansion in China negatively, saying Gentle Monster is already one of the top three sunglass brands in China.



“I don’t think declining tourists is an issue for a best brand like this,” he said, hinting at the brand’s possible collaboration with other LVMH brands in the near future. “If you have a best brand, people would go and look for them.”



L Catterton, formed in 2016 through the partnership of Catterton, LVMH and Groupe Arnault, has been increasingly purchasing stakes in Korean companies in recent years, including US$80 million in YG Entertainment in 2014 and US$50 million in Clio, a cosmetics maker, in 2016.



Thakran said he is also looking at more investment opportunities in Korea, pinpointing tourism retail and wellness businesses as his key interests.

Two fashion powerhouses Kering and LVMH have banned US size zero models, which is a size four in Australia, from the runway and advertising.



This is a significant change in the industry with LVMH owning Louis Vuitton and Christian Dior, while Yves Saint Laurent, Gucci and Balenciaga are part of the Kering stable.

""I am deeply committed to ensuring that the working relationship between LVMH Group brands, agencies and models goes beyond simply complying with the legal requirements,"" said LVMH director Antoine Arnault.



""Respecting the dignity of all women has always been both a personal commitment for me and a priority for Kering as a group,"" said the company's billionaire chairman Francois-Henri Pinault in a statement.

Video: Even Victoria's Secret models have come under fire in the past.

""We hope to inspire the entire industry to follow suit, thus making a real difference in the working conditions of fashion models industry-wide.""

These changes will be introduced before Paris Fashion Week at the end of the month.

The YSL advertisment from 2015 banned in the UK.

In the past Kering’s YSL has come under fire for the use of skinny models in advertising, with one campaign banned in the UK following complaints to the Advertising Standards Authority in 2015.

""The model's pose and the lighting effect in the ad drew particular focus to the model's chest, where her rib cage was visible and appeared prominent,"" the ASA ruling said, ""and to her legs, where her thighs and knees appeared a similar width, and which looked very thin, particularly in light of her positioning and the contrast between the narrowness of her legs and her platform shoes.""

As part of the sweeping changes, models under the age of 16 will no longer be used to advertise adult clothes and models aged 16-18 can no longer work between 10pm and 6am and will be chaperoned during work.



Kering and LVMH’s decision follows the French law introduced in May banning ultra-thin models from the Paris runway, with those hiring talent without seeing a valid medical certificate of health facing fines of 75,000 euros ($111,692) or jail sentences of up to six months.

In February French model Victoire Dauxerre revealed her modelling struggles in the book Size Zero: My Life As A Disappearing Model.

""The skinnier I got, the more jobs I got — so I just kept on going. When I went to my agency having lost weight, they would applaud me,"" Dauxerre said.

""This industry says to be beautiful you have to be skinny and sick and have no personality.""



In her best-selling book The Vogue Factor, former Vogue Australia editor Kirstie Clements highlighted the insidious cycle that Kering and LVMH are finally attempting to break.



""The 'fit' model begins the fashion process: designer outfits are created around a live, in-house skeleton,"" writes in The Vogue Factor. ""Few designers have a curvy or petite fit model.



""These collections are then sent to the runway, worn by tall, pin-thin models because that's the way the designer wants to see the clothes fall. There will also be casting directors and stylists involved who have a vision of the type of woman they envisage wearing these clothes. For some bizarre reason, it seems they prefer her to be young, coltish, 6ft tall and built like a prepubescent boy.""

LVMH's L Catterton Asia sees value in Gentle Monster - Inside Retail Asia,"Mon, 11 Sep 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vaW5zaWRlcmV0YWlsLmFzaWEvMjAxNy8wOS8xMS9sdm1ocy1sLWNhdHRlcnRvbi1hc2lhLXNlZXMtdmFsdWUtaW4tZ2VudGxlLW1vbnN0ZXIv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Private equity firm L Catterton Asia is investing in South Korean designer eyewear firm Gentle Monster.

The firm is leading a consortium, including Groupe Arnault, to acquire a minority equity stake in Iicombined, the owner of Gentle Monster. Groupe Arnault is owned and controlled by French billionaire Bernard Arnault, the chairman and chief executive of luxury group LVMH Moet Hennessy.

The investment amount has not been disclosed.

Gentle Monster, known for its bold frames, is popular among celebrities and trendsetters. The brand will open its first Southeast Asian flagship store in Ion Orchard this month. It is already in more than 19 countries and has 11 standalone stores around the world, including China.

Founded in 2011, Gentle Monster surged in popularity after South Korean actress Jeon Ji-hyun wore its sunglasses in the TV drama My Love from the Star. Co-founder/chief executive Kim Hankook says the company plans to further expand its footprint into Europe and the Middle East.

L Catterton Asia, previously known as L Capital Asia, was set up in 2009 and manages more than US$1.6 billion across two private equity funds. Its other investments include F&B brand Crystal Jade, Clio Cosmetics and YG Entertainment, which manages South Korean stars like Big Bang and Psy.

L Catterton Asia chairman/managing partner Ravi Thakran says Gentle Monster is already outselling more established competitors, delivering retail productivity on a par with or better than many luxury brands.

“Given the relatively low penetration rates for sunglasses across most Asian markets, and Gentle Monster’s success in addressing the special needs of Asian consumers, we see strong growth potential for the company.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9901062846183777}",neutral,0.9901062846183777,0
French luxury giants sign charter to ban size 0 models - CTV News,"Wed, 06 Sep 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmN0dm5ld3MuY2EvbGlmZXN0eWxlL2ZyZW5jaC1sdXh1cnktZ2lhbnRzLXNpZ24tY2hhcnRlci10by1iYW4tc2l6ZS0wLW1vZGVscy0xLjM1NzY5MzLSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS -- Two of the world's biggest luxury goods conglomerates will stop working with unhealthily thin fashion models, as part of a joint charter signed Wednesday that aims to protect their health.

The pact adopted by French corporations LVMH and Kering, which own brands like Dior, Gucci and Louis Vuitton, incorporates -- and goes beyond -- a new French law that requires models to provide medical certificates proving they are healthy before they can work.

While the French law set to take effect Oct. 1 requires both male and female models to present a health certificate obtained within the previous two years, LVMH and Kering said their charter would shorten the time frame to six months of the job.

The pact also bans the conglomerates' labels from using female models below a French women's size 34, which is typically equivalent to a U.S. size 0-2 and a U.K. size 6. The French law initially included a minimum body mass index requirement, but it was removed after lawmakers deemed the doctor's certificate an adequate safeguard.

The fashion companies' said their agreement would take effect this month, in time for the spring-summer ready-to-wear runway collections.

Unlike the French law, the charter also will apply to the international Kering and LVMH brands with runway collections presented in Milan, London and New York. The two groups said they hoped to set a new global standard for the fashion industry.

""We hope to inspire the entire industry to follow suit, thus making a real difference in the working conditions of fashion models industry-wide,"" Kering CEO Francois-Henri Pinault said in a statement.

In addition, the charter requires each brand to put a dedicated psychologist at the disposal of fashion models during working hours -- either by phone or in person in the work place.

A monitoring committee of representatives from Kering and LVMH will meet annually with brands, modeling agencies and models to ensure the charter is being correctly implemented.

The two giants' fashion houses include Dior, Kenzo, Stella McCartney, Saint Laurent, Gucci, Louis Vuitton, Marc Jacobs and others.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999884366989136}",neutral,0.9999884366989136,0

Two of France’s multinational fashion giants, LVMH and Kering, have collectively agreed to stop using ultra-thin models in catwalk shows and events.

The fashion industry especially in France, has been widely criticized for encouraging anorexia and eating disorders.

In response, LVMH and Kering, who between them own Gucci, Saint Laurent, Vuitton et Dior, unveiled a charter “to ensure the well-being of models”.

As part of the charter, the French giants also moved to outlaw the hiring of girls under the age of 16 for adult photoshoots or fashion shows.

Earlier this year, France banned the use of unhealthily thin models as part of a new law targeting “unrealistic body images” and eating disorders.

As part of the new law, models are now required to provide a doctor’s certificate attesting to their overall health and proving their body mass index (BMI) sits within a healthy range in order to work.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9997422099113464}",neutral,0.9997422099113464,0
