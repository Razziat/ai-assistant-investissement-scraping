"LVMH and Gagosian: why the rumour of a buy out makes sense, even if it isn't true - Art Newspaper","Thu, 10 Nov 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWFydG5ld3NwYXBlci5jb20vMjAyMi8xMS8xMC9sdm1oLWFuZC1nYWdvc2lhbi13aHktdGhlLXJ1bW91ci1vZi1hLWJ1eS1vdXQtbWFrZXMtc2Vuc2UtZXZlbi1pZi1pdC1pc250LXRydWXSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"During the recent European fair splurge, first Frieze in London then the first iteration of Art Basel’s new Paris+ fair, one rumour was flying about everywhere. LVMH (Louis Vuitton Moët Hennessy)—the behemoth which, with its rival Kering, dominates the luxury-goods industry—was buying Gagosian gallery. Or it was extending a line of credit worth $1bn to the mega-gallery. Or the rumour was partly correct, in that Larry Gagosian was looking for an exit strategy (he is now 77, with no obvious successor), but it wasn’t with LVMH.

No matter that LVMH and Gagosian vehemently denied everything. The story persists and is being amplified, it must be said, by journalists such as myself and others writing about it.

And yet such an acquisition would make total sense in more ways than one. The most obvious is that LVMH and Gagosian have the same client base: monied collectors of everything from high-end fashion, luxury goods, champagne, watches and jewellery, to... art.

Plus, both are in the business of branding. LVMH’s thundering herd includes Dior, Givenchy, Guerlain, Moët & Chandon and many more. Gagosian is among the most branded art dealers in the business, with the very name evoking a prestigious purchase. Its roster includes some of the juiciest names in contemporary art, from Jadé Fadojutimi to Christopher Wool, with of course a thriving secondary market business, from Bacon to Picasso—who have themselves become top “art” brands.

The act of buying—or rather being allowed to buy—from Gagosian is an accolade in itself: a proof of access, power and wealth. Luxury items are often sold in the same way as art. The “rules” for selling such high-end goods include “making it difficult for clients to buy” (think waiting lists for the hottest artists) and “keep non-enthusiasts out” (think “placing” works of art). These rules come from a book I consulted on about marketing not art, but luxury goods—The Luxury Strategy, by J.M Kapferer and V Bastien.

Gagosian, like LVMH, also does what is called “brand stretching” in commercial speak. You can buy a couture Dior dress for $100,000, or a Dior lipstick for around $30. In the Gagosian shop, an Anna Weyant poster costs $20 and a Jenny Saville t-shirt goes for the same sum. Weyant, famously, is the new 27-year-old sensation who is an “item” with Larry Gagosian and is the gallery’s youngest name; one of her paintings recently sold for $1.6m.

Add to that the international reach of both—Gagosian has 19 spaces around the world—and the growing convergence of art and luxury goods. Today, artists are designing everything from skateboards to yachts: Jeff Koons has produced handbags for Louis Vuitton based on paintings by Turner, Leonardo da Vinci and Fragonard. Bringing Gagosian into the LVMH fold could certainly facilitate more such collaborations.

And finally, a linkup would be an excellent way for LVMH to move its clients on from lipsticks to Lichtenstein, so to speak. At Paris+ par Art Basel, slap bang at the entrance was the Vuitton stand, dominated by a garish Takashi Murakami panda sculpture on a Louis Vuitton trunk... and a wall of handbags.

So even if the rumour isn’t true, maybe it should be: watch this space."
Path Cleared for $1 Billion Cheval Blanc Ultra-Luxury Hotel - Beverly Hills Courier,"Thu, 03 Nov 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vYmV2ZXJseWhpbGxzY291cmllci5jb20vMjAyMi8xMS8wMy9wYXRoLWNsZWFyZWQtZm9yLTEtYmlsbGlvbi1jaGV2YWwtYmxhbmMtdWx0cmEtbHV4dXJ5LWhvdGVsL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The city of Beverly Hills has signed off on Cheval Blanc, the ultra-luxury hotel plus retail and private club to be developed by LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton.

At its regular meeting Nov. 1, the City Council voted 4-1 to approve the 1.3-acre project on the 400 block of North Rodeo Drive and a development agreement hammered out by Mayor Lili Bosse, Councilmember Lester Friedman, the developer and private lawyers.

Councilmember John Mirisch cast the dissenting vote, arguing that the Paris-headquartered LVMH’s commitment to the city should include putting money toward affordable housing.

But his colleagues praised a hotel in which the average room will go for $2,045 per night in today’s dollars, citing the revenue it can generate for the city.

“We’re very fortunate to live in this luxury environment,” said Vice-Mayor Julian Gold. “This luxury environment actually creates the sense of home that Councilmember Mirisch pines for. And, at the same time, it provides the safety – the fire and police – and all the other amenities that we have.”

Gold called LVMH “more than a developer” but “an organization who understands who we are.”

The development agreement is “hundreds of millions of dollars that will provide the reasons that everybody lives here, for the police, the fire, the schools, the safety – for the magic of Beverly Hills” Bosse said.

“There are times in your life that just change you,” the Mayor added. “Everybody in this room is a part of history right now.”

Bosse noted that no public speakers save a UNITE HERE representative, who pressed for affordable housing, came to oppose the project.

The Council had approved the LVMH project at a Sept. 20 meeting, on the condition that they reconvene to approve the development agreement.

Under the agreement, hotel guests must pay a 5% surcharge tax on top of a 14% transient-occupancy tax.

LVMH also is required to pay $26 million to the city as a public benefits agreement and $2 million to benefit arts and culture.

The developer has to begin construction within a year, and complete construction by 2027. Should LVMH not meet this deadline they must pay an additional $24 million in liquidated damages to the city.

The development agreement plus two different economic analysis reports – one prepared in conjunction with the developer, the other with the city – laid bare the project’s high stakes.

“We are not seeking your approval as a speculative developer,” said Anish Melwani, Chairman and CEO of LVMH North America. “We are here before you as a long-term member of the Beverly Hills community.”

LVMH has paid $465 million to acquire the property, and the developer expects to spend $666 million on construction, figures that total $1.1 billion.

So high are the project costs that the LVMH-prepared economic analysis finds that the hotel will initially lose money.

Cheval Blanc is, however, expected to generate revenue for the city. Assuming a 75% room occupancy, the project would net $14.7 million in annual general fund revenues.

Henry Finkelstein, a Greenberg Glusker lawyer who presided over project negotiations, extrapolated a revenue estimate over 30 years of $778 million.

Finkelstein said the developer made “unusual commitments” on “land they already own.”

Other cities would have to subsidize LVMH to build such a project, Finkelstein said, whereas the cachet of Beverly Hills gives the city the upper hand.

“I think it is fair to say this is the only city in the world that could have made this deal,” Finkelstein said.

The four supporting councilmembers effusively praised the development.

“This will be a true gift to our community,” said Sharona Nazarian, who added that the revenue generated would help. “We need to bring in businesses that are a strong match to our city.”

“This is a once in a generation project,” stated Lester Friedman, who added that future Councils may use LVMH’s revenue for emergency services, affordable housing, or whatever they choose.

Bosse said the city’s interests and LVMH’s were aligned.

“The owners of this particular property are partners in our city,” she said, noting that LVMH already owns or leases multiple shops on Rodeo Drive. “I view this really as a partnership. It is a win-win.”

Meanwhile, Mirisch expressed distaste for the project.

“We look like marks, suckers, yokels,” Mirisch said, especially upset about a $26 million public benefits agreement he scoffed at as a “rounding error” for LVMH that amounted to “chump change” for the city.

He went on to compare the development agreement to notorious one-sided deals in American history, from Peter Minuit buying Manhattan for $24 worth in trinkets to the Red Sox selling Babe Ruth to the Yankees.

The crux of Mirisch’s argument was that either the developer, prospective guests, or both needed to earmark some money for affordable housing. Beverly Hills currently stands about 3,000 affordable housing units shy in meeting the state’s Regional Housing Needs Assessment, commonly known as RHNA.

“An oligarch who can afford a $2,000 night of conspicuous consumption can afford to spend an extra $100 on affordable housing,” he said.

Mirisch’s colleagues largely sidestepped his argument.

Nazarian did approve the idea of putting hotel revenue to a general fund instead of specifically setting it aside for affordable housing.

The resources needed to fight COVID-19 demonstrated the City Council must exercise “revenue discretion,” Nazarian said, later adding that the project would help, “Maintain fine services with our police, our fire, and our schools.”"

The Changemakers: The disruptors driving values-based industry evolution

Corey Smith

Head of diversity and inclusion, N.A.

Head of diversity and inclusion was a new position at LVMH when Corey Smith stepped into the role in September 2020. However, he’s quick to note he’d been in talks with the company about potentially signing on since 2019. Covid had simply slowed down the hiring process.

“LVMH was actually very proactive in its search for a D&I executive,” he said. “We were in touch prior to the uptick in all the D&I roles that happened across corporate America, as a reaction to George Floyd’s murder and the resurgence of the Black Lives Matter movement.”

And, he said, the company was already on a “pretty impressive D&I journey,” particularly in terms of gender equity. He pointed to its EllesVMH initiative launched in 2007, established when only 15% of the company’s senior leadership positions were held by women. A goal was set to raise that number to 50% by 2020. Globally, the company fell just short of the target, but the U.S. business reached it.

Smith has spent 25 years in D&I across a variety of industries. He joined LVMH after a 10-year stint at Major League Baseball, which was experience that LVMH valued, due to its comparable business model: Like LVMH, MLB is the parent company of many independently-owned and -operated businesses.

And, according to Smith, coming to luxury as an industry outsider set him up for success: “I got to come in, look at the entire landscape with fresh eyes and begin to solve,” he said. Among the noteworthy moves he made this year was launching a partnership with Harlem’s Fashion Row, putting LVMH’s weight behind the organization’s mission to foster emerging design talents of color.

Where do you sit within the LVMH conglomerate?

“I report to the chief HR officer, Gena Smith. But there are many aspects of D&I, including the HR and people side, the business side, and the branding side. The business side includes the supply chain and the need to be more inclusive in that ecosystem. And around branding, we’re asking: ‘What does the marketing look like? … Are our store employees trained on cultural agility and unconscious bias?’ Branding is the side of the business that is directly facing the customer, so there’s a need to hone in on it. I’m blessed and fortunate that [LVMH leadership] understands that and [allows me to manage] the full lifecycle and be a true diversity and inclusion practitioner, ensuring [D&I] thrives in the organization. I’m not siloed in HR.”

How do you work with LVMH’s individual brands?

“We own 75 maisons, and they’re all different, even the ones that operate in the same sectors. And there’s definitely a wide span. We have some brands that have thousands of global employees and some that just have a couple hundred employees based in the United States. It’s necessary to understand where each of them is in their respective D&I journey, because they’re all at different places. And that’s something we make sure to take our time on. One thing we’ve done is create progress pillars, allowing them to map and measure their own [D&I] journey over time. They can go at their own pace, and it’s basically a checklist so they’re all on the same page.”

You spearheaded LVMH’s year-long partnership with Harlem’s Fashion Row, announced in June. What’s involved?

“We had a relationship with HFR before I walked in the door, but when I went to its 2021 [fashion] show, I was blown away and wanted to do more. It took a year of a lot of hard work, and we had to go to Paris to get the budget approved, but it was [needed] to create a true partnership. Rather than just sponsoring the fashion show, we established a year-long engagement with them: [We supported] their Black History Month Fashion Summit in February, Louis Vuitton took part in their designer retreat, with executives meeting with 75 designers of color, plus Sephora has done stuff with them, and Tiffany & Co. took part in their Icon 360 HBCU Summit. … We want to get as many maisons on board as possible. Another thing that came out of the partnership was LVMH’s launch of the Virgil Abloh Award, honoring [people sharing Abloh’s spirit, brilliance and vision], at HFR’s annual Fashion Show & Style Awards. That’s something we will support every year.”

What other accomplishments were you proud of this year?

“It was the first year LVMH brought the Métiers d’Excellence [training] program to the U.S.: Tiffany & Co. created a two-year apprenticeship to teach people what it is to be an expert craftsman and jewelry maker. It kicked off in September with eight apprentices from all walks of life. Six of eight are women, plus there’s one man and one non-binary, and they represent all types of races. Other maisons will likely become a part of [the program] in 2023. For Tiffany, it’s part of the Atrium it launched this year to [advance opportunities for historically underrepresented communities]. That kicked off with the ‘About Love’ campaign with Jay-Z and Beyoncé and a $2 million commitment to HBCUs. I was also proud of the fact that LVMH walked in the New York City Pride March in June for the first time.”

Overall, what’s your take on D&I within fashion, as it stands?

“Since I first walked in the door, I’ve been talking about the need to shift this idea of the industry being exclusive or for certain people to a narrative that it’s about aspiration. That way, anybody can participate. We all aspire to be better in our lives, and we can aspire to be part of this community. You may not be able to participate now, for whatever reasons, but you aspire to participate. And when you’re able to, you should then be invited and welcomed in. It shouldn’t be exclusionary by any stretch of the imagination.”

LVMH acquires jewellery producer Pedemonte Group - Vogue Business,"Fri, 25 Nov 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZvZ3VlYnVzaW5lc3MuY29tL2NvbXBhbmllcy9sdm1oLWFjcXVpcmVzLWpld2VsbGVyeS1wcm9kdWNlci1wZWRlbW9udGUtZ3JvdXDSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"To receive the Vogue Business newsletter, sign up here.

LVMH is boosting its jewellery production capacity with the acquisition of the Pedemonte Group, a manufacturer with locations in northern Italy and Paris.

Pedemonte Group was founded in 2020 as a merger of several independent production workshops known for their use of technology and traditional craftsmanship, and currently has 350 artisans and employees. As well as producing for third parties, the company has its own Made in Italy jewellery brand, Vendorafa. LVMH bought Pedemonte Group from the Equinox III SLP SIF investment fund for an undisclosed sum.

“With this strategic acquisition for our maisons, the LVMH Group further strengthens its presence in Italy while continuing to support the ecosystem of companies that contribute to the success of our maisons,” says Toni Belloni, deputy managing director of LVMH, in a statement. “With Pedemonte, our maisons will gain a partner recognised for its know-how to support their growth and maintain their leadership in jewellery.”

The global luxury jewellery market is expected to reach €28 billion in value by the end of 2022, up 23 to 25 per cent on last year, according to management consultancy Bain and Italian luxury body Altagamma, which notes “unparalleled appetite for the [jewellery] category due to huge efforts and investments from jewellery brands”. LVMH’s watches and jewellery division includes Tiffany; Web3-keen Tag Heuer, led by LVMH chairman and CEO Bernard Arnault's son Frédéric; Bulgari; Hublot; Fred; Chaumet; Zenith; and Repossi. The division grew 16 per cent in the third quarter, driven by an acceleration in watch sales. However, while Tiffany is presented as a challenger to Richemont’s Cartier, LVMH is up against tough competition as Cartier still holds the highest market share, analysts say.

Earlier this year, LVMH expanded its Métiers d’Excellence artisan training programme to the US in partnership with Tiffany in an ongoing effort to preserve centuries-old skills.

Motte is succeeding current CEO Chris de LaPuente at the beauty retailer, with parent company LVMH announcing the news on its LinkedIn page.

Motte has more than 20 years’ experience in leadership roles, currently working as Deputy CEO for LVMH’s Fashion Group since May 2021.

He manages a stable of fashion brands including Celine, Loewe, Givenchy, Marc Jacobs, Kenzo, Rossimoda, Pucci, JWAnderson and Patou.

Prior to this, Motte was President and CEO of Sephora in Europe and the Middle East from 2018 to 2021, managing 1,100 stores across 20 countries.

His achievements include the inclusive marketing campaign ‘The Unlimited Power of Beauty’ and steering Sephora back into Germany after a 16-year hiatus.

He has also held prominent positions at French menswear chain Celio and lifestyle retailer Al Tayer Trends.

""I am delighted to welcome Guillaume back to Sephora as President and CEO,” said de LaPuente.

“His experiences over the past two years in LVMH Fashion Group have broadened his prestige brand-building expertise and deepened his already extensive retail and business skills at a global level.

“I have no doubt he will continue to build Sephora into the extraordinary premium beauty retailer we envision.

“I am extremely happy that we will be working together again.""

De LaPuente temporarily stepped back into the role of CEO in June this year following the departure of Martin Brok, who left after just two years at the helm.

De LaPuente will continue to serve as chairman and CEO of LVMH’s Selective Retailing Division.

Motte is tasked with using his prestige brand-building expertise to help grow Sephora's global reach

What does Motte's appointment mean for the future of Sephora?

Motte’s appointment comes as Sephora ramps up its global expansion.

The company re-entered the UK market this year after it acquired British beauty e-tailer Feelunique in July 2021.

It started transitioning Feelunique’s site to Sephora UK, finally launching in October 2022.

Sephora marked its UK launch with the ‘All of You’ campaign, which celebrated the 'experimental definitions' of British beauty.

A London store is set to open in March 2023, followed by a slow rollout of sites across the UK.

As part of its digital transformation plans, the retailer appointed former Apple exec Marc Abergel as its first-ever digital chief in February.

Abergel has been tasked with leading Sephora’s digital strategising, which includes enhancing shoppers’ journeys online and guiding e-commerce growth.

Sephora levelled up its e-commerce offering in July by partnering with digital commerce company Commercetools.

The partnership aims to offer Sephora customers a more personalised user experience.

It hopes the system will unify its in-store and online shopping experience and boost its omnichannel offerings.

Sephora also announced a partnership with on-demand delivery service DoorDash in the US this month.

Customers in North America can shop the beauty retailer’s range on the DoorDash app and have it delivered in, on average, under an hour."

What the Gagosian-LVMH Rumor—and the Art World’s Obsession With It—Tells Us About the Future of the Industry - artnet News,"Wed, 16 Nov 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vbmV3cy5hcnRuZXQuY29tL21hcmtldC9ncmF5LW1hcmtldC1nYWdvc2lhbi1sdm1oLWFjcXVpc2l0aW9uLTIyMTA4ODnSAVVodHRwczovL25ld3MuYXJ0bmV0LmNvbS9tYXJrZXQvZ3JheS1tYXJrZXQtZ2Fnb3NpYW4tbHZtaC1hY3F1aXNpdGlvbi0yMjEwODg5L2FtcC1wYWdl?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Every Wednesday morning, Artnet News brings you The Gray Market. The column decodes important stories from the previous week—and offers unparalleled insight into the inner workings of the art industry in the process.

This week, closing the loop…

ALL THAT GLITTERS

With roughly six weeks of the year left, it’s hard to imagine another art-market rumor spreading as rapidly or as breathlessly through 2022 as last month’s talk that LVMH was about to acquire Gagosian. The consensus among art-world observers at the time was that the prospect made too much sense not to happen.

Roughly three weeks later, however, the gossip seems to be a cross between a misinterpretation and a mass delusion. There are two reasons why, in retrospect, this outcome was always more likely—and it’s worth remembering them the next time the art world starts buzzing about a luxury conglomerate buying into the gallery sector.

First, though, let’s nail the casket closed on the LVMH/Gagosian rumor. Gagosian spokespeople have denied it up, down, left, and right since it emerged during the inaugural Paris+ fair in late October. An alternate theory (first reported by the Canvas, then expanded upon by my colleague Katya Kazakina) holds that the real deal linking the two parties is a $1 billion credit line empowering Larry Gagosian to make strategic artwork buys on behalf of LVMH’s billionaire founder, Bernard Arnault. (Representatives for Gagosian and LVMH didn’t respond to Katya’s requests for comment.)

Could Arnault have been the end client for Warhol’s Shot Sage Blue Marilyn (1964), which Gagosian won for $195 million at Christie’s auction this May? We may never know the answer.

What we do know is, that three weeks after many art pros were holding their breath for confirmation that LVMH was about to buy Gagosian outright, there have been no outward signs that the two companies are marching toward a terms sheet. I can’t picture them—or any of their respective competitors—getting there anytime soon, either. The road has a couple of major obstacles that seem to have stayed out of view during the most active part of the gossip cycle.

CULTURE CLASH

I spoke to Doug Stephens, an author and longtime consultant to top-tier retail and luxury brands, to get a different perspective on the feasibility and mechanics of a luxury behemoth adding a mega-gallery to its portfolio. Stephens, I should note, said he had not heard a peep about LVMH acquiring Gagosian until I asked him about it in early November. While he too thought that a deal like it made a lot of sense, he also emphasized that practically every merger or acquisition does during negotiations, including the ones that later flame out once the businesses are actually tied together.

“Most acquisitions don’t fail on the numbers. They just don’t,” Stephens said. “Where they often fail is culturally.”

Take LVMH as an example. The company reported €36.7 billion ($38.2 billion) in revenue and €10.2 billion ($10.6 billion) in profit during the first half of 2022. You don’t have to be an economist to understand that figures that size put the conglomerate in the big leagues… which also means every significant move it makes must be methodical.

For a company of LVMH’s caliber, no potential acquisition can advance until it has survived a gauntlet of due diligence appraisals from analysts and attorneys. The stakes are too high to do anything less. What this means is that “nine times out of ten, these deals do make sense on paper from a revenue, profitability, and strategy standpoint,” Stephens said.

And yet, just like in the art market, the data is only one part of the story. How a smaller company is integrated into a larger one is just as important as whether a smaller company is integrated into a larger one. The human element, personnel, internal systems, and workflows all matter. And all of the above matters even more when the company targeted for acquisition has become successful in large part because of its founder’s unique vision and energy (as, I think it’s safe to say, Gagosian has).

“Founder-led companies often have a remarkable acuity for zeroing in very closely on what customers want and harnessing all the resources of the company to give them what they want. That’s how tiny companies become bigger companies,” Stephens said. “What can happen when a founder-led company is brought into a conglomerate, especially if the founder is marginalized in the process, is that what drove the company and made it great sometimes gets watered down.”

In the worst cases, middle managers’ thoughts on the company’s value proposition and strategy begin to crowd out the founder’s intense focus on the client experience. In turn, decision-making slows down and people work to mitigate risk rather than embrace it strategically.

In fact, Stephens notes that shareholders in a planned acquisition can actually sue the parties involved if they believe there was a “reckless disregard” for the deal’s effects on company culture. This means executives on both ends of any possible deal have a fiduciary responsibility to consider the intangible impact of joining forces, and not just weigh up facts, figures, and balance sheets.

Regarding the LVMH/Gagosian rumor specifically, Stephens said that he has “never heard anything that would suggest LVMH is overly controlling or heavy-handed when it comes to the brands under its roof.” But the conglomerate’s treatment of Gagosian (or any other gallery) post-acquisition would go a long way toward determining the success or failure of merging the luxury and art worlds in this way. (By the way, a well-placed source relayed that Larry Gagosian still owns his business outright, meaning there would be no need for him to convince investors if he ever did decide to sell. A gallery spokesperson declined to comment.)

“If LVMH looked at Gagosian and said, ‘We believe in the trajectory of art as a category that justifies investment, and we believe [Gagosian] is well run with a strong executive and specialized knowledge that we don’t want to screw around with, and we want to make them… a distinct member of the family,’ that can work,” Stephens said. “But if it’s a matter of changing the management structure and value proposition, and tinkering with the core offering of this chain of galleries, then that could go awry.”

And the potential fallout for any gallery’s “core offering” in such a deal deserves more attention than it got during the initial hurricane of speculation over LVMH and Gagosian.

ARTIST’S CHOICE

Pop quiz: What’s generally the first and most important unknown that people in the art world try to puzzle through when a significant gallery closes or two notable dealers merge?

If you answered, “Where each of the artists is going to end up after the dust settles…” Congratulations, you’ve been paying attention to how this little carousel of ours turns.

For all its complications, there are certain ways in which the gallery business is as simple as it gets: If you don’t manage enough artists making enough work that buyers actually want to pay for, you’re dead. End of story. It would be an exaggeration to say that big-name dealers aren’t able to meaningfully increase demand for the artists they represent, but big-name dealers are more numerous and more interchangeable than they used to be. Now more than ever, star-caliber artists are the irreplaceable element.

And yet there was next to no discussion about artists’ possible resistance or defections when the unprecedented possibility of a major luxury brand acquiring a mega-gallery ricocheted around the art industry a few weeks ago. To me, that was a mystifying blind spot.

On one hand, I understand why so few people flinched. Fashion, luxury, and art have been getting increasingly frisky with each other, and we have every reason to believe that the attraction is only going to continue intensifying in the years ahead. A beloved artist’s estate can create a retail and licensing empire. Living artists can (and regularly do) link up with designers and fashion houses for limited-edition collaborations. High-end dealers do become romantically involved with movie stars and models. Apex-level collectors run gaudy private art foundations and fund major artists’ projects.

At the same time, for most artists, I think there is still a colossal difference between being able to opt into one-off fashion or luxury deals as a part of a larger studio practice, and having their entire artistic career managed by the subsidiary of a fashion/luxury-lifestyle company. And a subsidiary of a fashion/luxury-lifestyle company is exactly what Gagosian (or any gallery) would become if it were acquired by LVMH (or one of the brand’s rivals).

This isn’t to say that every single artist and estate on the gallery’s roster would mutiny. But I think a cross-industry acquisition like this would spark a lot of soul-searching for not only artists but for the partners, directors, and artist liaisons that would connect these practitioners to the executives at the very top of the corporate hierarchy.

Although art professionals sometimes discuss artists in terms uncomfortably close to how retail analysts discuss manufacturing equipment, artists are human beings with emotions, preferences, and (once they’ve amassed a certain audience) leverage in the marketplace. The same is true for gallery staff who are most directly responsible for keeping those artists content. Every one of these key stakeholders has options, and other high-end galleries would make damn sure that they knew it even before their current representative had finished selling the business to a luxury-lifestyle conglomerate.

All of which brings us back to the issue of risk. A multibillion-dollar company could never afford to close a deal for a major gallery without knowing for certain which artists and key staffers would remain after the ownership change. That means contracts (which so many artists hate). That means incentives. That means, in all likelihood, paying handsomely to ensure that the talent that matters most stays put.

Would money alone be enough? The luxury empire could try to sweeten the pot by producing many more artist-licensed collaborations while also restricting the pool of participating artists to those on the acquired gallery’s roster. I’m just not sure how much of a difference that would make. If an artist bristles at the idea of being represented by a company aligned with a luxury brand in the first place, you’re probably not going to win them over by offering even more opportunities to dive headlong into luxury brand-building.

This is why talent and personnel retention should be the first things people consider the next time the rumor mill kicks into hyperdrive: the “core offering” is the artwork, and this only comes from people with high-touch personalities and strong opinions who can’t be easily replaced if they don’t want to ride the art-meets-luxury trend lines into uncharted territory.

Still, that doesn’t mean tycoons from these sectors won’t try, or even succeed, in permanently joining forces eventually. From Stephens’s perspective, luxury retail may have an even greater incentive to push into the gallery sector than vice versa.

“What is considered to be luxury now is not what was considered to be luxury 30 or 40 years ago. The tectonic plates are shifting,” he said, citing the rise of streetwear as just one rupture to the old order. Plus, every fashion conglomerate “become[s] its own competition at some point. You’re operating so many brands within the portfolio that you hit a point of diminishing returns on profitability.”

Unless, that is, you start reaching into new sectors entirely. Going forward, a luxury lifestyle might encompass “everything from the champagne in your glass, to the hotel you’re spending the night in, to the luggage you brought with you, to the gallery you’re visiting today,” in Stephens’s words. In fact, we’re already there. But vertically integrating them all under the same corporate empire is tougher than the lifestyle makes it seem.

That’s all for this week. The Gray Market will be on hiatus for the Thanksgiving holiday next week. ‘Til next time, remember: just because it makes sense doesn’t mean it’s going to get done.

Better Buy: LVMH vs. Richemont - The Motley Fool,"Thu, 24 Nov 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIyLzExLzI0L2JldHRlci1idXktbHZtaC12cy1yaWNoZW1vbnQv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Which luxury goods giant is the better bear market buy?

Over the past year, many sectors collapsed as inflation, rising interest rates, and other macro headwinds drove investors from higher-growth stocks toward more recession-resistant plays. One safe haven has been the luxury goods sector, since affluent consumers are generally better insulated from economic downturns than their lower-income and middle-class counterparts.

LVMH (LVMUY -1.91%) and Richemont (CFRH.F -2.18%) are two of the bellwethers of that resilient industry. LVMH's European shares have declined just 3% this year, while Richemont's shares have pulled back by about 16%. Both stocks easily outpaced the bear market declines across the major indexes. Should investors buy either of these luxury stocks today?

The key differences between LVMH and Richemont

Paris-based LVMH is the world's largest luxury company. It owns 75 brands across five categories -- wines & spirits, fashion & leather, perfumes & cosmetics, watches & jewelry, and selective retailing -- and its top brands include Louis Vuitton, Dior, Loewe, Fendi, Tiffany, Bulgari, and Sephora. LVMH generated 49% of its revenue from its fashion and leather goods segment in the first nine months of 2022. The rest was split between its selective retailing (18%), watches & jewelry (13%), perfumes & cosmetics (10%), and wines & spirits (9%) divisions.

Richemont, which is based in Bellevue, Switzerland, is significantly smaller than LVMH. It owns 26 core brands, including Cartier, Chloé, Dunhill, Jaeger-LeCoultre, Montblanc, Piaget, and Van Cleef & Arpels. It generated 87% of its revenue from its jewelry (66%) and watch (21%) brands in the first half of fiscal 2023 (which ended on Sept. 30). The remaining 13% came from its fashion and accessories brands, watch components, real estate investments, and other minor businesses.

Therefore, LVMH is a well-rounded pick for investors who want exposure to a broader range of luxury markets. Richemont might be a better fit for investors who want to focus on the high-end jewelry and Swiss watch markets.

Which company is growing faster?

LVMH and Richemont both struggled throughout the pandemic as brick-and-mortar stores shut down and global travel and tourism ground to a halt. However, both companies recovered quickly as those headwinds waned.

LVMH's revenue declined 17% in 2020. All five of its core businesses suffered top-line declines, but its specialty retail business fared the worst as it shut down its Sephora and duty free stores. Its net profit plunged 34%.

But in 2021, LVMH's revenue and net profit increased 20% and 68%, respectively, driven by the accelerating growth of its fashion & leather goods and watches & jewelry segments. In the first nine months of 2022, its revenue rose another 20% year over year as it generated double-digit growth across all five of its business divisions.

LVMH's growth in China remains sluggish amid the region's draconian zero-COVID restrictions, but it largely offset that slowdown with its robust sales growth across the United States, Europe, and Japan. Analysts expect its revenue and net profit to rise 23% and 22%, respectively, for the full year.

Richemont's revenue declined 8% in fiscal 2021 (which ended in March 2021), but its core jewelry and watch businesses recovered quickly (particularly in China) in the second half of the year. Its net profit increased 38%, but that growth was mainly driven by one-time benefits instead of its operating profit (which fell 3% for the year).

In fiscal 2022, Richemont's revenue and net profit surged 46% and 61%, respectively, driven by high double-digit sales growth across all of its business segments and regions. Its revenue rose another 24% year over year in the first half of fiscal 2023, as its strong growth in Europe and the Americas offset its pandemic-induced slowdown in China. However,

Richemont booked a net loss during that period after it sold its stake in the Italian online fashion retailer YNAP to Farfetch. Excluding that divestment, its net profit from continuing operations still grew 40%.

Analysts expect Richemont's revenue to rise just 2% for the full year as its growth decelerates against tough comparisons to its post-pandemic recovery. But they still expect its profit from continuing operations to increase a whopping 75%.

The valuations and verdict

Both of these luxury stocks are still reasonably valued relative to their growth rates. LVMH and Richemont trade at 24 and 17 times next year's earnings, respectively. Richemont might initially seem cheaper, but it's historically grown at a slower clip than LVMH if we exclude its impressive post-pandemic recovery. LVMH is also better diversified than Richemont, and it also offers investors plenty of exposure to high-end jewelry and watches with Tiffany, Bulgari, and Tag Heuer.

LVMH and Richemont should both remain stable investments in this ongoing bear market. But if I had to choose one over the other right now, I'd stick with LVMH for its superior scale, diversification, and more consistent growth."
LVMH Acquires Jewelry Producer Pedemonte Group - HYPEBEAST,"Wed, 30 Nov 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vaHlwZWJlYXN0LmNvbS8yMDIyLzExL2x2bWgtYWNxdWlyZXMtamV3ZWxsZXJ5LXByb2R1Y2VyLXBpZWRtb250LWdyb3VwLW5ld3MtaW5mb9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LVMH Group has officially announced the acquisition of the Pedemonte Group a jewelry producer which currently employs 350 artisans and employees across three sites in Valenza and Valmadonna in northern Italy and Paris. Pedemonte’s Watches & Jewelry Division as well as its jewelry maisons will allow LVMH to significantly increase its production capacity while its workshops will contribute to the overall growth of the division.

Pedemonte group was first established in 2020 under Equinox through a merger of several independent production workshops including Villa Pedemonte Atelier and Vendorafa Lombardi, combining decades of heritage and experience. The exact figure of the acquisition from Equinox III SLP SIF investment fund has yet to be disclosed. Merging “cutting-edge technology and artisanal craftsmanship,” Piedemonte’s impressive execution in its collaboration with LVMH maisons ultimately warranted the deal.

“With this strategic acquisition for our maisons, the LVMH Group further strengthens its presence in Italy while continuing to support the ecosystem of companies that contribute to the success of our maisons. With Pedemonte, our maisons will gain a partner recognized for its know-how to support their growth and maintain their leadership in jewelry,” LVMH deputy managing director Toni Belloni said in a statement.

Pedemonte will join LVMH’s existing portfolio of jewelry and watch companies including Chaumet, Tiffany & Co., Bulgari, Hublot, FRED, TAG Heuer, and Zenith.

“Joining the LVMH Group is a source of pride and motivation for the entire management team and employees. This operation will allow us to maintain our ambitions in terms of development, training and strengthening of our human resources, the heart of our activities. We will also pursue an ambitious investment policy to meet new challenges, particularly in technology,” says Gian Andrea Garrone, Chairman and CEO of Pedemonte Group.

Gagosian announces new board of directors including LVMH's Delphine Arnault and filmmaker Sofia Coppola - Art Newspaper,"Wed, 16 Nov 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimwFodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGVhcnRuZXdzcGFwZXIuY29tLzIwMjIvMTEvMTYvbGFycnktZ2Fnb3NpYW4tYW5ub3VuY2VzLW5ldy1ib2FyZC1vZi1kaXJlY3RvcnMtaW5jbHVkaW5nLWx2bWgtZGlyZWN0b3ItZGVscGhpbmUtYXJuYXVsdC1hbmQtYWN0b3Itc29maWEtY29wcG9sYdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The question of Larry Gagosian’s legacy has been a hot topic of late, with rumours being circulated—and vigorously denied—that the mega-dealer is selling his business to French billionaire Bernard Arnault’s LVMH group.

Today, however, Gagosian has announced a new, star-studded board of directors, 12 of them external and eight of them gallery staff (including Gagosian himself). Among the external members are Delphine Arnault, Bernard Arnault’s eldest daughter and a member of the executive committee of LVMH; the film-maker Sofia Coppola; the Snapchat creator Evan Spiegel; the artist Jenny Saville, who is represented by the gallery; the curator Francesco Bonami and the hedge-fund manager J. Tomilson Hill.

Gagosian says in a statement that his goal in assembling the board is “to raise the bar on the gallery’s strategic thinking and vision for the future”. He adds: “I felt it was important to welcome different perspectives and experiences into a conversation about the opportunities and challenges facing artists today and tomorrow, as well as the future of collecting.”

Of the selected members, who are listed in full below, Gagosian says he has “gathered many of the most talented minds in their respective industries, a number of whom have specific experience at the intersection of their trade and art. Their insights can help us validate our priorities and how we are positioning the business for success and growth”. Of course, all are art top collectors themselves, and many of them trustees of major museums.

As for potential collaborations and joint ventures, it is likely that there will be more crossover between Gagosian and LVMH—gallery artists past and present including Jeff Koons, Takashi Murakami, Jonas Wood, Urs Fischer and Alex Israel have previously collaborated with the luxury brand. Evan Spiegel’s input, meanwhile, could bring more tech initiatives to the gallery, which successfully piloted online viewing rooms before the pandemic, selling an Albert Oehlen painting for $6m in March 2019. Most recently, Gagosian collaborated with Clone X to present a Murakami exhibition in virtual reality.

The board was established in late 2021 and first met in May, possibly prompting the rumours of the LVMH buyout. Due to meet twice annually, the group met for the second time last week. Members “will be compensated”, according to a Gagosian spokesman, but they will “have no financial interest in the gallery”, nor will they have voting rights. The gallery remains entirely under Gagosian's ownership.

By contrast, in July, Bernard Arnault changed the legal structure of his family holding company, Agache, to a joint-stock partnership to ensure family control over LVMH in the long-term. The Arnault family, through various legal entities, owns 47.99% of LVMH and has 63.5% of voting rights in the luxury group. At 73, Arnault has not publicly named a successor.

Unlike Arnault, Gagosian, who is 77, does not have children, so the question of his legacy is arguably more complicated. Which is perhaps why he is keen to explore new and unorthodox directions for his 19-strong gallery empire—ensuring his virtually unrivalled brand continues long after he is gone.

The platform aims to find treasures within the company’s maisons and launch special sales of the unique items, each paired with experiences and services.

“Heristoria reflects our passion for beautiful stories. Only a group like LVMH has the capacity to bring such a diversity of iconic heritage items under one umbrella; objects that are the ongoing expression of our maisons’ know-how,” said LVMH group managing director Toni Belloni.

The platform is grouped by decade, and tells a story of the era’s ethos and aesthetic, as well as history from each piece.

The first release of items, titled “Preface” to launch the concept, brings together 29 pieces from 21 maisons from across their holdings in fashion, leather goods, fragrance, watches and jewelry, and wine and spirits. A Moynat trunk from the 1920s, restored but left with the original owner’s personal red and white stripe motif, is on offer for 9,000 euros, while a visit to Château d’Yquem accompanies a trio of bottles from the winery for 840 euros.

Among the fashion items are a restored Givenchy couture dress from the spring 1963 collection, worn by Audrey Hepburn. A visit to the brand’s private maison for tailoring accompanies the black shift with a back bow, while a circa 1976 Concorde flight attendant uniform designed by Jean Patou is also available.

A velvet wrap coat from Kenzo Takada’s first collection in 1987 is on offer, accompanied by a visit to the brand’s workshops.

All items are one-of-a-kind and the site will be replenished as objects are unearthed, but won’t have scheduled “drops.” Not to be confused with resale, each piece is pulled from the maisons’ internal archives, and the platform does not offer peer-to-peer or strictly “secondhand” sales.

It’s part of the company’s drive to incorporate new ideas and innovation through its Disrupt, Act, Risk to Be an Entrepreneur, or DARE, initiative and designed to focus on the company’s history and craftsmanship.

The trio of Gérosine Henriot, Laurence Mayer and Nicolas Forge grew the idea through the DARE program, and are credited as cofounders of the platform. Forge was also key in creating the company’s Nona Source, LVMH’s deadstock textiles resale platform sustainability initiative. — RHONDA RICHFORD

In the early part of her career she was fashion director of Dazed and The Face and the launch editor of Another. She has also launched three other fashion magazines — Perfect, Love and Pop. Since 2020 she has worked with Sarabande, the emerging artists foundation established by Lee Alexander McQueen.

Grand has also been credited with the discovery and rise of industry figures including Cara Delevingne, Mert & Marcus, Kendall Jenner and Alasdair McLellan.

“Always ahead of the curve, Katie’s work as a stylist and creative consultant has influenced trends and supported the discovery of fresh, new talent,” said Caroline Rush, chief executive officer of the BFC.

Grand said the legacy that “Issy Blow left behind, and everything she brought to fashion, has always been a massive inspiration to me.”

Previous winners of the award include IB Kamara, Sam McKnight, Mert & Marcus and Pat McGrath.

The Fashion Awards raise funds for the BFC Foundation, a charity that supports the future growth and success of the British fashion industry by focusing on talent, education, grant-giving and business mentoring, and aim to improve equality and opportunity in the industry.

The BFC said that in the financial year 2021-22, it remitted more than 1.3 million pounds in funds to designers and students. — SAMANTHA CONTI

CHOI DOES CLARIDGE’S: It’s a Jimmy Choo Christmas.

The luxury accessories brand’s creative director Sandra Choi has unveiled her Christmas tree design for London’s Claridge’s hotel in Mayfair.

The brightest and most animated in the hotel’s history, the tree is a minimal geometric shape lit by white lights with a double-knotted neon pink bow.

“The bow as a symbol of bringing things together and this united ceremony is what I wanted to portray,” Choi told WWD on the morning of the tree’s big unveiling.

“The tree itself was a symbol to the core of our brand because what does Jimmy Choo mean? Glamour always comes like a boomerang,” she added. Glamour is a running motif in the brand’s winter 2022 campaign shot at the famous hotel, starring Iris Law, Mica Argaňaraz and Stan Taylor, photographed by Angelo Pennetta.

The tree has been given the name of The Diamond.

The tree has been given the name of The Diamond, a nod to the brand’s regalia-like accessories. The designer wanted to translate the allure of Jimmy Choo’s through light in collaboration with set designer Simon Costin who worked on the tree that stands more than five meters tall and took more than 350 hours to construct.

“We chatted and we dissected what it means to use light as a whole idea into the future. It’s about stepping inside the jaw, which I talk about often. Claridge’s is a place of heritage, it’s iconic and for us at Jimmy Choo, we needed to bring that glamour that Claridge’s has,” Choi said.

Simplicity and upcycling were at the forefront of Choi and Costin’s ideation when they met to plan the project.

“We produce a lot of stuff and Christmas is one of those times where you’re overloaded with things to bring the festivities alive, but we wanted to minimize the stuff element and have the ability to upcycle certain parts of the tree. We haven’t got there yet, but it’s something we discussed last night. What do we do with the materials and what do they mean to us?” said Choi, who will be hosting a cocktail party at the hotel on Wednesday evening to celebrate the tree commission.

Christmas for Choi is all about treating others. Her most memorable memory of the holiday is from 2019 when her family took a trip to Lapland in Finland, she said.

“We packed our bags, went to the cold and had a white Christmas. It was incredibly magical because it’s not about stuff, but rather just being together,” said Choi, who will be celebrating Christmas with her sister in Wales this year.

“I have volunteered my sister to treat me,” she said, jokingly.

Choi has already started forward planning for 2023, and hinted at a mentoring program in the works.

“I’m really into seeing what the new generation is looking at. I’ve got teams of people I work with and I always chat to them about what they see and how they feel. I’ve been in this brand for so long, I’ve seen it all, but to actually see it from another lens is very important,” she said.

Choi hinted at another project set for spring 2023 that she describes as a “nostalgic childhood project that is really artful, creative and feminine at the same time.” — HIKMAT MOHAMMED

DESIGNING SERPENTINE: The Lebanese-born, Paris-based architect Lina Ghotmeh is the next designer of the Serpentine Pavilion in London, which will be all about eating, socializing — and sustainability.

Ghotmeh’s pavilion, a social space in-the-round, will be unveiled at Serpentine South in June. It will remain on site until October, and during Frieze week, which has become a magnet for fashion designers keen to align themselves with the world of fine art.

Ghotmeh’s eponymous firm develops projects at the crossroads of architecture, art and design. She describes her approach as 360-degree, and said it involves in-depth research on location history, typology of the place, materials, resources and users’ habits.

Her pavilion design is called “À table,” which means “come to the table.” It will be the Serpentine’s 22nd pavilion, and is aligned with the gallery’s ongoing theme of “archaeology of the future.”

The pavilion’s in-the-round layout is meant to allude to a sense of unity, with a seating formation that invites social interaction. The structure has been inspired by nature and is meant to echo the grounds and canopies of the trees in Kensington Gardens, Hyde Park, where the Serpentine galleries are located.

Lina Ghotmeh is the designer of the 2023 Serpentine Pavilion in London.

“’À table’ is an invitation to dwell together, in the same space and around the same table. It is an encouragement to enter into a dialogue, to convene and to think about how we could reinstate and reestablish our relationship to nature and the Earth. As a Mediterranean woman, born and raised in Beirut, and living in Paris, I feel a deep belonging to our ground, to what it contains, and to what it embraces,” the architect said.

She added that the atmosphere is “reminiscent of toguna huts of the Dogon people in Mali, West Africa, designed to bring all members of a community together in discussion. Here we can eat, work, play, meet, talk, rethink and decide.”

The structure will be built with bio-sourced and low-carbon materials, designed to minimize its environmental impact, in line with Serpentine’s sustainability policy. Materials include sustainably sourced timber ribs that will be arranged to support a suspended, pleated roof.

LVMH Métiers d'Art Creates Japan-based Branch - WWD,"Mon, 07 Nov 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3dkLmNvbS9mYXNoaW9uLW5ld3MvZmFzaGlvbi1zY29vcHMvbHZtaC1tZXRpZXJzLWQtYXJ0LWphcGFuLWNyZWF0aW9uLWVtaW5hLW1vcmlva2EtMTIzNTQwOTcxNi_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS — LVMH Métiers d’Art is expanding the scope of its fine artistry and craft techniques with the creation of LVMH Métiers d’Art Japan, the luxury group revealed Monday.

The Japan-based structure will be committed “to preserving and promoting [the country’s] know-how while exposing them to the major luxury brands, often European,” stated Jean Baptiste Voisin, chief strategy officer at LVMH Group and president of LVMH Métiers d’Art.

Norbert Leuret, president of LVMH Japan, said the decision would reinforce the strong existing connections between the group’s brands and Japan’s artistic and artisanal landscape.

Helming LVMH Métiers d’Art Japan will be 40-year-old Emina Morioka, who studied in France before joining the group’s watches and jewelry division in Japan to work in marketing and communication at luxury watchmaker Tag Heuer, later joining the group’s strategy department. She recently participated in the development of a rising Japanese boutique hotel brand.

Bi-cultural Morioka is described as “decisive in strengthening the connections between [French and Japanese] cultures, highlighting Japanese talents and forging the necessary links between them and [the group’s] houses and more generally our industry” by LVMH Métiers d’Art’s chief executive officer Matteo De Rosa.

Set up in 2015 to help the conglomerate’s houses build and maintain strong sourcing of rare materials, as well as education and training for the industry, LVMH Métiers d’Art acquired a stake in Spanish tannery Riba-Guixà the same year, in Italian tannery Masoni in 2019 and most recently, a majority stake in Heng Long Italy and a minority stake in leather and suede artisanal ready-to-wear manufacturer Robans."
"Logistics Gets Fashionable as GXO Signs Nike, LVMH and More - Sourcing Journal","Fri, 11 Nov 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vc291cmNpbmdqb3VybmFsLmNvbS90b3BpY3MvbG9naXN0aWNzL2d4by1sb2dpc3RpY3MtZXhlYy10YWxrcy1mYXNoaW9uLWxvZ2lzdGljcy1zdXBwbHktY2hhaW4tbmlrZS1sdm1oLTM4Nzg2OS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Fashion’s push for a more tailored logistics strategy has become a boon for GXO Logistics.

The third-party contract logistics provider based out of Greenwich, Conn. continues to amass a portfolio of blue-chip fashion and retail clients, with recent new contracts from LVMH and Nike adding to a business that also works with Kering, Dolce & Gabbana, Lacoste, JD Sports, Spanx, L’Oreal and Zara.

The customer wins come off another growth quarter for GXO, a spinoff from XPO Logistics in August 2021.

GXO this week said it capped its third quarter with $2.3 billion in revenue, reflecting a 16 percent increase from the year-ago period. Adjusted net income for the period totaled $89 million, up from $65 million in the third quarter of last year.

The company is now in the midst of the peak shipping season as brands and retailers begin heavily marketing for holiday.

“We’re already in peak season now,” GXO CEO Malcolm Wilson said Wednesday during the company’s quarterly earnings call. “We’ve already got our way through October that’s going in alignment with our planning what we expected.”

He added to that by saying the business, while doing “very well,” is “going to be different than a year ago.”

He pointed to the factors defining the 2021 peak season: inventory shortages, product held up at the ports and labor scarcity.

“This year, it’s very different. So, our warehouses generally have good levels of inventory in them, and importantly labor is readily available,” he said.

The company is in the midst of hiring some 22,000 globally not only for the holiday season, but also to fill new sites that will open in January.

Bill Fraine, GXO’s chief commercial officer and a former head of sales at FedEx, put it another way in an interview with Sourcing Journal Wednesday.

“What we’re seeing is what I would call a smoother peak,” Fraine said. “And, what I mean by that is last year you had all these shortages…. At the same time, you had very, very high rates—inflating rates for employment. So it was hard to get employment, so that caused problems and challenges, too.”

Now, the incentives to hire are receding, according to Wilson.

Even as companies such as FedEx, seen as a bellwether for the economy, are seeing declining parcel volumes, GXO seems to be bucking the trend.

The logistics firm reiterated its estimates for the full year in which it expects revenue to grow between 12 percent and 16 percent, with adjusted diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $2.70 to $2.90.

The company’s nabbed $977 million in business so far this year and “we’ll definitely close more business in the fourth quarter,” Fraine said.

Added to the guidance is GXO’s U.K. regulatory clearance in October for its purchase of retail and fashion logistics company Clipper Logistics, marking the final hurdle in its $1.3 billion deal.

Clipper touts a client list that includes Asos, Giorgio Armani, Harvey Nichols, H&M and Liberty. Its expertise lies in reverse logistics—a growing headache for the fashion industry—with a returns management system it calls Boomerang. That “click and collect” technology is seen as a “big opportunity” for GXO, Fraine pointed out.

Facility automation is something GXO is adept at with its sites touting 30 percent to 32 percent automation, something that could potentially benefit the legacy Clipper buildings.

Fraine said the two will now work on “learning the best of what Clipper does and the best of what GXO does” and begin integrating those learnings across the business.

All in all, while Wilson told analysts signs point to a more challenging 2023 macro environment, he doesn’t see a recession on the horizon.

“Our business isn’t behaving as if it’s in a recession,” Wilson said. “The consumers’ not behaving as if they’re in a recession, but what we are seeing is lots and lots of early signs of opportunities coming along into our pipeline, pre-pipeline of customers that need to transform their business.”

A fashionable growth model

While GXO has a customer base that spans industries, fashion offers potential for growth.

Sustainability and how warehouses and distribution centers fit into that conversation are “very important” among the fashion and retail companies Fraine has conversations with as they think about how logistics fits in with their greening efforts throughout the entire product cycle.

Kering in May said its GXO-operated logistics hub in Trecate, Italy received Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Platinum certification—the highest in the U.S. Green Building Council’s certification program used across the commercial real estate industry.

The facility has solar panels on the roof, outdoor green spaces and a water system that cuts usage about in half.

“Sustainability has been at the core of Kering’s strategy and roadmap for years,” Kering chief sustainability and institutional affairs officer Marie-Claire Daveu said in a statement at the time of the certification. “Obtaining this prestigious LEED certification is another testimony of how we act to adopt sustainability best practices at every stage of our processes, from the design of a product to its delivery.”

Brands also turn to companies such as GXO to help them with their expansions because, without a smooth logistics strategy, delivery to stores or the end consumer could go awry—a ding when it comes to customer service and branding.

“We were already talking about companies in Europe moving into the U.S., companies in the U.S. moving into Europe and what the strategy is,” Fraine said of discussions with fashion clients prior to current market conditions.

While companies still have interest in that, he said, they are mindful of the direction of the economy.

“High fashion [in my opinion] is less obviously impacted by the economy. The demand is still going to be there,” Fraine said. “Other companies are just looking to see where consumers’ levels are and making sure they’re not overstocking, but they’re very bullish on the fact that if they came into the U.S. or Europe, they would have a market.”

He pointed to one industry example of a company that made the decision to locate a warehouse in the Northeast to cover a larger portion of the population, while using GXO Direct to service the West Coast.

GXO Direct is the company’s network of distribution hubs touted as an option for brands looking for flexible facilities options and fast fulfillment lead times.

In other cases, the company is helping luxury conglomerates use the power of their many brands to cut costs on warehouses and distribution centers as they grow. In the past, Fraine said, many of these brands operated separately, taking up smaller pieces of real estate. With the growth of e-commerce and physical store expansion, the need to have product closer to the end consumer requires more warehouse space.

“They’re getting closer to their customer and dispersing, so they want to have product close to New York, close to Chicago, close to L.A. or the key markets in the United States, but they don’t want to have too much product,” Fraine said. “So what we’re working with them on is how we can take more than one brand, more than one maison, and put them in one site so they get the benefit of cost [optimization].”"

In addition to Delphine Arnault, eldest daughter of LVMH chairman Bernard Arnault and member of the group’s executive committee, the board includes Snapchat’s Evan Spiegel, filmmaker Sofia Coppola and others.

Gagosian has firmly denied rumors that the Mr Gagosian, who owns 100% of the business, estimated to clear $1 billion in sales annually, is selling his gallery to LVMH. But the 77-year-old mega-dealer, a bachelor with no children, has yet to devise a succession plan and recently told The New York Times: “If somebody swooped in and wanted to make a major investment, I think anybody would listen to that.”"

Hang Lung and LVMH launch groundbreaking sustainability partnership - South China Morning Post,"Mon, 21 Nov 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMingFodHRwczovL3d3dy5zY21wLmNvbS9wcmVzZW50ZWQvYnVzaW5lc3MvdG9waWNzL2Z1dHVyZS1zdXN0YWluYWJsZS1idXNpbmVzcy9hcnRpY2xlLzMyMDAxMTAvaGFuZy1sdW5nLWFuZC1sdm1oLWxhdW5jaC1ncm91bmRicmVha2luZy1zdXN0YWluYWJpbGl0eS1wYXJ0bmVyc2hpcNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Their three-year partnership, which is expected to be renewed in 2025, demonstrates both groups’ commitment to sustainability, as well as their desire to set new standards that will inspire more collaborations of this nature between property owners and retailers around the world.

Driven by a shared conviction about the urgency of the current climate crisis, both groups wanted to create a fresh model of partnership for sustainability, without a template or precedent. With the unwavering commitment of top management and strong support from employees, both sides embraced the principle of “learning by doing” to take the collaboration forward.

Based in Hong Kong, Hang Lung Properties develops, owns and manages properties in Hong Kong and nine cities across mainland China. LVMH is a family-run conglomerate that is headquartered in Paris and owns 75 luxury brands operating around the world.

Although sustainability goals are now par for the course for many real estate developers, Hang Lung Properties and LVMH have taken sustainability one step further through an innovative collaboration that seeks to keep both parties accountable in reaching specific goals.

Highlighting the urgent challenges that climate change brings, Adriel Chan, Hang Lung Properties vice-chair and chair of sustainability steering committee, believes the collaboration with LVMH will enable both parties to find creative ways to solve sustainability challenges.

“The real estate industry is not known for innovation,” he says. “However, today we start to change this by introducing a new way for real estate developers and tenants to engage and to find more innovative ways to be more sustainable together.”

This pioneering partnership is unprecedented in its scale, scope and approach.

In terms of scale, the partnership’s sustainability goals will be implemented across Hang Lung’s portfolio of properties within seven cities in mainland China. This includes more than 90 retail spaces belonging to 26 LVMH brands, including Louis Vuitton, Dior, Loewe, Bulgari, Celine and Tiffany & Co.

With regards to its scope, the partnership will not only be limited to energy efficiency and data collection, but will have wider implications in areas such as biodiversity, governance and social impact, as well as learning and development.

Its approach will also be highly collaborative, with both groups given an equal number of seats to co-create sustainability solutions in 12 areas together at their inaugural forum – slated to take place on November 24 and 25 in Shanghai, Hong Kong and Paris. At this hybrid event, stakeholders from both sides will take part in problem solving to take shared ownership of the ongoing activities and their eventual results.

Antoine Arnault, LVMH image and environment, says paying more attention to the group’s environmental impact is expected to heighten the attractiveness of its stores.

“The design of our stores, like that of our products, is inspired by LVMH’s core values of creativity, innovation and excellence. And this of course means guaranteeing the environmental performance of our 5,550 stores around the world,” he says.

The agreement will focus on five key areas of sustainability: climate resilience, resource management, well-being, sustainable transactions, as well as sustainability communication, events and progress reviews.

This partnership builds on both groups’ existing ESG goals and targets, and takes their agenda to the next level. Hang Lung has set out specific sustainability objectives to achieve in the short-, medium- and long-term, for 2025, 2030 and 2050. LVMH has also adopted the Life 360 environmental initiative, which aims to fight climate change through a road map spelling out specific standards and targets.

A leader in sustainability

Hang Lung has a long-standing commitment to sustainability. The company has four priorities in this regard: climate resilience, resource management, well-being and sustainable transactions.

In December 2020, the company announced specific sustainability goals and targets it aims to achieve by 2030, such as diverting 90 per cent of operational waste from landfills, achieving a 70 per cent reduction in the intensity of Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions compared to the 2018 baseline, and working with young people on sustainability solutions through community well-being initiatives in cities in which the company operates.

Then in 2021, Hang Lung announced its 25x25 Sustainability Targets, where 25 more pledges were made with specific goals it intends to fulfil by 2025, further emphasising its commitment to advancing its sustainability agenda.

In the same year, Hang Lung’s Spring City 66 in Kunming became the first commercial complex in Yunnan province to achieve net-zero carbon emissions in annual electricity consumption for both the landlord’s and tenants’ operations – a first for the company.

Hang Lung was also the first real estate developer in Hong Kong, and one of the first in Asia, to adhere to the Urban Land Institute (ULI) Greenprint’s support for a low-carbon future, which seeks to keep global warming below 1.5 degrees Celsius. ULI Greenprint is a global membership consortium of top real estate owners, developers, investors and strategic partners who seek to improve the real estate sector’s environmental performance. By adopting its goals, Hang Lung has pledged that those buildings over which it has direct operational control will achieve net zero by 2050.

Testifying to the company’s green credentials, over 77 per cent of Hang Lung’s overall construction floor area has been certified as green buildings, with 32 Leadership in Energy and Environment Design (LEED) Gold or above certifications and pre-certifications.

As a result of its leadership in sustainability issues, Hang Lung has been included every year (since 2017) in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index – the world’s first global, performance-tracking sustainability index, established in 1999. The company has also been included for 12 consecutive years in the Hang Seng Corporate Sustainability Index Series, the first index of its kind in Hong Kong as a benchmark for socially responsible investments. Hang Lung is also part of the GRESB, an independent benchmark for ESG performance in which it achieved a four-star performance rating and A-grade disclosure rating last year.

With this groundbreaking partnership with LVMH, Hang Lung hopes to set a new precedent for corporate sustainability decisions, and inspire other companies and individuals to find innovative ways to safeguard our planet’s future."
The Rumor That LVMH Is Buying Gagosian Just Won’t Die. There May Be Something to It—But Not What You Think - artnet News,"Fri, 04 Nov 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vbmV3cy5hcnRuZXQuY29tL21hcmtldC90aGUtcnVtb3ItdGhhdC1sdm1oLWlzLWJ1eWluZy1nYWdvc2lhbi1hcnQtZGV0ZWN0aXZlLTIyMDQ5MDnSAWRodHRwczovL25ld3MuYXJ0bmV0LmNvbS9tYXJrZXQvdGhlLXJ1bW9yLXRoYXQtbHZtaC1pcy1idXlpbmctZ2Fnb3NpYW4tYXJ0LWRldGVjdGl2ZS0yMjA0OTA5L2FtcC1wYWdl?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The Art Detective is a weekly column by Katya Kazakina for Artnet News Pro that lifts the curtain on what’s really going on in the art market.

Last month, around Frieze London, dealers, collectors, and journalists on both sides of the Atlantic seemed to gasp collectively: Luxury goods behemoth LVMH was buying Gagosian gallery!

The megadealer’s representative shot down any possibility of a merger again and again. But the story didn’t go away.

Last week, Kenny Schacter, an artist, collector, and Artnet News columnist, posted a “breaking news!” item on Instagram, claiming that Gagosian, with its 19 branches around the world, had sold to billionaire Bernard Arnault’s LVMH (Louis Vuitton Moët Hennessy). “The commodification of art as just another luxury branded-collectible-fashion accessory is now complete,” he wrote.

Despite the gallery’s rebuttals, the rumor persisted—and mutated. The latest iteration, reported earlier this week by the Canvas and previously floated to me by a well-placed source, is that it’s not an outright acquisition, but rather a credit line of $1 billion (a curiously specific amount that may be predicated on the reported annual turnover of the gallery). Think of it as Larry and Bernard LLC, with Larry drawing down the credit line to make strategic acquisitions, one person told me.

“I would give a line of credit to anyone who can make me money,” the person said. “Why not? There’s nowhere to put it.” Traditional investments have had a rough year, including indices like S&P 500, which is down 22.5 percent in 2022 to date.

Allegedly, the first purchase of the nascent partnership was Warhol’s Shot Sage Blue Marilyn, which Gagosian bought publicly for $195 million at Christie’s in May.

Representatives for Gagosian and LVMH didn’t respond to requests to comment.

“Makes Perfect Sense”

The persistence of these rumors is intriguing. It speaks to the art world’s obsession with Larry Gagosian who, at 77, is peerless in his ability to sell, surprise, and wield power on the global stage. Gagosian’s succession plans—and the future of his empire—remain unclear.

He’s about 20 years older than his rivals David Zwirner, Iwan Wirth, and Marc Glimcher. Unlike Zwirner and Glimcher, who are both second-generation art dealers, Gagosian doesn’t have children. In 2019, he established a 24-person advisory board and hired Andrew Fabricant as the gallery’s chief operating officer, suggesting he was thinking about longer-term planning. But whether Gagosian the brand could outlast its founder remains an open question. Few galleries do.

“Whether or not it’s true, the fact that so many people believe it’s true speaks to the fact that it makes perfect sense,” Natasha Degen, chair of art market studies at the Fashion Institute of Technology, said of the LVMH rumor.

In some ways, a $1 billion credit arrangement is just an accelerated version of business as usual. Businesses big and small borrow all the time—just ask billionaire Sotheby’s owner Patrick Drahi. (It helps that the richer you are, the lower your interest rate.) Gagosian has borrowed consistently over the decades, from Wells Fargo and Bank of America, and used art as collateral for loans from Sotheby’s and Christie’s.

He could easily get a credit line from a bank again. But of course, a bank won’t lend $1 billion against a $1 billion business.



“It’s a much shorter distance to the money,” said one person, who knows Gagogian and Arnault. Plus, there’s another component to consider. “This has to do with the games rich and powerful people play. This is about these guys bonding. This will be fun.”

It’s also a strike in Arnault’s arms race against archrival Francois Pinault, a fellow luxury billionaire and owner of Christie’s.

Both Frenchmen have a long history in the art business: Arnault bought Phillips auction house in 1999, merging it the following year with the dealership founded by Simon de Pury and Daniella Luxembourg. (He sold his stake after the tech bubble burst.)

Meanwhile, Pinault has engaged in gallery financing himself. He bought Haunch of Venison gallery, with branches in London, Berlin and New York, in 2007. Six years later, the gallery shuttered.

Cozy Bedfellows

In a way, Gagosian is already involved with LVMH. Once seen as crass and commercial, collaborations between artists and fashion brands have become commonplace. Gagosian saw the benefits of such partnerships early on.

Gallery artists Jeff Koons, Takashi Murakami, Jonas Wood, Urs Fischer, and Alex Israel have all collaborated with Louis Vuitton. Architect Frank Gehry, who is also represented by the gallery, designed La Fondation Louis Vuitton in Paris.

“There’s a huge amount of overlap in terms of the clientele,” said Degen, whose forthcoming book Merchants of Style explores the convergence of art and fashion. “That makes [Gagosian] a desirable partner.”

LVMH, the world’s largest luxury brand with $56.5 billion in revenue during the first nine months of 2022, has been acquiring other top brands in various segments, including newspapers, luxury hotel chains, and yacht builders.

LVMH’s recent purchase of Tiffany’s resulted in an ad campaign featuring a Basquiat painting. Tiffany’s upcoming holiday season will be anchored by Warhol in a collaboration with the Andy Warhol Foundation, Women’s Wear Daily reported this week.

“There is a clear focus on not only acquiring companies in the spaces that they have excelled in for so long (i.e. leather & fashion goods predominantly) but also elsewhere,” said Matt Trevors, founder MT Capital Research, whose recent deep dive focused on LVMH. “The company has clearly evolved into a house that is focused on all things luxury.”

Fabriant himself pointed out the inevitable fusion of art and luxury in an interview with WWD in May. “It’s just being accelerated by the consolidation of all these issues, whether it’s Kardashian, Arnault, or the Gagosian gallery having 19 galleries,” he said. “It’s just more, more, more. It’s also mutually beneficial.”

We will likely never know the terms of any deal between the two titans. But it’s easy to imagine that the investment could be used to compete with the auction houses.

Just before the pandemic, Gagosian, Pace, and Acquavella joined forces to win the right to sell the estate of Don Marron, outwitting Christie’s, Sotheby’s, and Phillips, who all jostled for the trove. The trio has not surfaced to take on any other major estates since then. Perhaps a credit line from Arnault would give Gagosian a chance to compete on his own.

Regardless, those who know Gagosian say he’s going to figure out a winning exit strategy.

“This is not the person who just retires,” one former staffer said. “Larry Gagosian isn’t going to go play tennis and enjoy his house in the Hamptons. I can see a Gagosian store at every airport. Larry is the ultimate Warholian art dealer. He’s the king.”

"LVMH Hosts Show Me Event in Milan, Outlines Training and Hiring Ambitions in Italy - WWD","Thu, 17 Nov 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3dkLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy1uZXdzL2h1bWFuLXJlc291cmNlcy9sdm1oLXRyYWluaW5nLXNraWxsZWQtd29ya2Vycy1pdGFseS1sdXh1cnktc3R1ZGVudHMtMTIzNTQyMzQ3Ni_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"MILAN — “Our French cousins are definitely better than us in storytelling, we should learn from them to narrate the value of craftsmanship,” said Carlo Capasa, president of Italy’s fashion chamber, at the end of Show Me event LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton staged here on Thursday.

At its second edition in Italy, the event offered an update on the initiatives implemented by the group and its Institut des Métiers d’Excellence, the vocational training program aimed at promoting, enhancing and ensuring the transmission of know-how that involves artisanal craftsmanship, creative and retail skills. The program has trained some 2,000 people in six countries since it was founded in 2014.

In addition to LVMH‘s own projects aimed at preserving these jobs and training new professional figures, the group has partnered with Camera Nazionale della Moda Italiana, or CNMI, and the Confartigianato association, to introduce an award in support of Italian craftsmanship. More specifically, each year a different brand of the group will partner with CNMI to acknowledge three master artisans, who will received a money prize of 10,000 euros and up to three sessions of mentorship. The first brand joining the initiative is Fendi.

LVMH’s group managing director Antonio Belloni underscored the importance of the Italian ecosystem in perpetuating the creativity, craftsmanship and customer experience for the group, as the country is home to six of its brands, including Bulgari, Acqua di Parma, Loro Piana, Emilio Pucci and Cova, in addition to Fendi.

“The artisans represent the true strength of our group and are those capable of creating products that make very demanding customers dream all over the world,” said Belloni. “I keep repeating that the guiding star of our group is to always cultivate the desirability of our maisons for the long term. This is very important. Well, the products and the experiences we offer to customers are evidently the cornerstone of this strategic approach and therefore these professions of excellence and the talents behind them are what I would call the real core competence that we must nourish and continue to strengthen for the future of our business.”

The executive also acknowledged the group’s partners in the country, around 5,000 small to medium-sized companies employing more than 200,000 people and that “bring to our group not only production capacity of the highest quality but also innovation, ideas and know-how. They push us to do better and are very complementary to what we do.”

“This supply chain is a formidable resource for the group and for the country. And in fact, together with public authorities and educational institutions, we really want to make a joint effort to continue to perpetuate this competitive advantage and important force. I always say that Italy is the second homeland for the LVMH group, and therefore we will do our part here,” added Belloni.

The brands’ commitment and great ambition in preserving artisanal jobs locally is further amplified by the shortage of skilled workers in the fashion and hospitality industries. According to projections by luxury goods association Fondazione Altagamma, Italy will have a vacancy of 346,000 workers in the so-called Métiers d’Excellence, including 94,000 people in the fashion and leather goods industry and 36,000 professionals in high-end hospitality.

In a video message screened at the event, Chantal Gaemperle, executive vice president of human resources and synergies at LVMH, stressed the “urgency of attracting new generations” to these fields, underlining that these represent a great career opportunity. In particular, LVMH is looking to hire more than 2,000 talents in these jobs in Italy by the end of 2024.

“There’s a natural convergence between the LVMH group and Italy, because high-end manufacturing is a distinctive trait of the Italian industrial fabric. The Italian hand and creativity are unmatched: they have their roots in the Renaissance corporations and have developed and handed down [those skills] through the generations, finding their realization in those realities that are the Italian districts,” said Belloni.

In Italy, the group employs 12,000 people across its six brands, but also at more than 250 stores, eight Belmond luxury hotels and 31 manufacturing sites.

“And we’re constantly growing,” said Belloni, mentioning this year’s operations such as Berluti’s production facility in the Emilia-Romagna region that has been doubled in capacity as well as Fendi’s new footwear factory in Fermo, in the Marche region, and its state-of-the-art accessories plant in Bagno a Ripoli, a 30-minute drive from Florence.

Belloni also teased new projects, including plans for a leather goods factory in Tuscany for Givenchy and a more vague but “ambitious” project by Loro Piana for a production facility. As reported, Bulgari will also double the production capacity of its jewelry manufacturing plant in Valenza, which was unveiled in 2017.

With a surface area of nearly 189,000 square feet, Bulgari’s site is expected to become the biggest in the world for jewelry and be completed by the end of 2025. Bulgari’s chief executive officer Jean-Christophe Babin underscored that the company will need to recruit 750 new people and flank the existing in-house academy aimed at training new hires with another school that will also be open to external students.

“The [vacancy] is big.…We also need 400 skilled workers in the next few months for our new hotel in Rome and another 150 in the next five years for the goldsmith’s workshop where we craft high jewelry, also in Rome,” said Babin.

Robert Koren, Belmond’s senior vice president, Europe, Middle East & Africa, confirmed the challenges the hospitality sector is facing since “the pandemic pushed the professional workers of this industry to other fields.” To confront the moment, the hotel came up with a straightforward, on-field approach by leveraging low season to train new workers at its structure and preparing them to be integrated during the six to nine busiest months of the year.

During the event, Alexandre Boquel, head of development for LVMH’s Métiers d’Excellence division, detailed the steps of the “virtuous circle” of actions the group is implementing to preserve the know-how behind this type of job by inspiring vocations, training people and passing the skills to the next generations.

The starting point is to change the way these positions are perceived by youth via the Excellent program, which is geared toward teenagers. In a year, the initiative raised awareness about these jobs among 700 middle school students in Italy because of collaborations with brands such as Bulgari, Berluti, Celine, Dior, Fendi and Loro Piana.

Second on the group’s agenda is offering orientation on courses and information about LVMH. Next year LVMH will introduce in Italy the “You and Me” tour to help the public learn about the training courses of the Institut des Métiers d’Excellence, receive tips from the human resources of the group’s brands and discover the career opportunities at the company. The recruitment tour will touch base in Florence, Padua and Novara, in the Piedmont region.

Since its launch in Italy in 2017, Institut des Métiers d’Excellence has trained 400 students in the country. Last year, 99 percent out of all students received their diplomas and 76 percent of them now cover jobs in the fields they trained for, most of them at LVMH or its partner companies.

For the 2022-23 academic year, 186 students will be in Institut des Métiers d’Excellence’s 14 programs here. Three training programs will debut, too, including one dedicated to eyewear, developed in collaboration with Thélios, Louis Vuitton, the Certottica institution for the certification of optical products, and the ITS Cosmo academy. A hospitality program with Belmond, and one dedicated to leather goods and launched with Fendi in partnership with Fondazione Altagamma’s Adopt a School initiative will be also available.

Guaranteeing improvement to employees throughout their entire careers is also key, according to Boquel. For one, an academy for leather goods modeling will be launched.

Cyril Letellier, modeling supervisor for men’s leather goods at Fendi, said there’s “a desperate need” for this type of profile, which is more and more difficult to find.

“The solution is to make our leather goods manufacturer grow and turn them into modelers. So a team of specialists has worked nine months on developing this new program that will start in January,” he said. The seminal class will enroll nine people.

In addition to executives of LVMH and its brands, attendees at Show Me included artisans, students and artists sharing their personal experiences. Closing the event, 20 “virtuous” people were recognized with a special gold pin designed by Chaumet for representing the excellence in their fields inside the group, while apprentices received a certificate."

“With this strategic acquisition for our maisons, the LVMH Group further strengthens its presence in Italy while continuing to support the ecosystem of companies that contribute to the success of our maisons. With Pedemonte, our maisons will gain a partner recognized for its know-how to support their growth and maintain their leadership in jewelry,” LVMH deputy managing director Toni Belloni said in a statement.

LVMH acquired the relatively young fine jewelry group from the Equinox III SLP SIF investment fund. Financial terms were not disclosed.

Pedemonte Group was formed in 2020 under Equinox, bringing together large-scale production specialist Villa Pedemonte Atelier and Vendorafa Lombardi, which specializes in goldsmithing, to create the new group in the fine jewelry sector. Villa Pedemonte Atelier has a long history of collaborating with international luxury brands, and has previously worked with LVMH’s various houses.

At the time of creation, the two groups reported a combined revenue of 41 million euros.

“We are extremely proud of the group’s history and growth. The deployment of a high-performance manufacturing platform has garnered the interest of an international player as relevant and important as LVMH,” said Equinox partner Angelo Facchinetti.

Pedemonte employs 350 people across its three sites in Valenza and Valmadonna in northern Italy and Paris in France. The acquisition is set to strengthen LVMH’s fine jewelry production capacity as the watches and jewelry division continues to grow in an expanding market.

“We are very pleased to welcome the teams from the Pedemonte Group and its subsidiaries with whom we have been working for many years. Today our stories and our values come together around this spirit of excellence and enterprise, the perpetuation of craftsmanship and the development of creativity,” said Stéphane Bianchi, chief executive officer of the LVMH watches and jewelry division.

Bulgari, Chaumet, Fred and Tiffany & Co. are among LVMH’s fine jewelry maisons, while Dior and Louis Vuitton each have their own high jewelry lines. Cate Blanchett is the face of Louis Vuitton’s high jewelry line, which unveiled its largest collection yet with a new campaign in June.

LVMH reported its sales of watches and jewelry were up 16 percent in the third quarter as sales picked up in Asia. The company continued its post-pandemic rapid growth, as overall revenues jumped 19 percent in the same period."
"Former Luxottica, LVMH Executive Andrea Guerra Rumored to Join Prada - WWD","Tue, 29 Nov 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vd3dkLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy1uZXdzL2h1bWFuLXJlc291cmNlcy9mb3JtZXItbHV4b3R0aWNhLWx2bWgtZXhlY3V0aXZlLWFuZHJlYS1ndWVycmEtcnVtb3JlZC1qb2luLXByYWRhLTEyMzU0MzE0OTMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"MILAN — Prada shares on Tuesday closed up 2.89 percent at 40.90 Hong Kong dollars on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange following a press report that LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton senior adviser Andrea Guerra may be joining the Italian luxury group in January.

Prada did not comment on the speculation but a source, who requested anonymity, believes Guerra could be asked to flank Lorenzo Bertelli to prepare him to take on the chief executive officer’s role. This is currently held by both his father Patrizio and his mother Miuccia Prada.

The speculation was first reported by Repubblica.

A Prada board meeting is expected to convene in January, but a source believes Guerra’s appointment in a top managerial role could take place this week and be ratified by the board next year.

Jefferies issued a report stating that “Guerra would add invaluable experience and significant gravitas to the Prada senior management team should his role as de facto ‘caretaker’ be confirmed and that the market would view his arrival as a positive for a group that is initiating a phase of succession.”

A possible retirement of Patrizio Bertelli, who is 76, has been in the news for a while, further fueled by the executive during Prada’s first Capital Markets Day in November 2021, as he pointed to a potential handover in three years.

Patrizio Bertelli’s choice is not a surprise as his son has increased his responsibilities and been a driver of change since joining the company in 2017. He was named group marketing director in 2019 and, additionally, head of corporate social responsibility in 2020. In May 2021, he joined as a director of the board.

Guerra, conscripted in early 2020 as CEO of the newly created LVMH Hospitality Excellence division, said last May that he was leaving the French luxury group “to pursue other interests” and would become a strategic and development senior adviser.

He is a former CEO of eyewear group Luxottica and onetime strategic adviser to former Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi. He joined LVMH from Italian high-end food emporium Eataly, where he had been executive chairman since 2015.

At LVMH, he took over an entity that encompasses Hôtels Cheval Blanc and the Belmond Hotels & Luxury Trains and also became a member of the luxury conglomerate’s executive committee. Ultimately, his purview was widened to include oversight of the Fendi and Loro Piana businesses, as well as Thélios, the Italian eyewear firm that LVMH took full control of last year.

A graduate of the University of Rome, Guerra started his career in 1989 with hotel group Marriott International. He has also worked in a variety of executive roles at Merloni Elettrodomestici, an Italian maker of household appliances now known as Indesit Co.

The relationship between Patrizio Bertelli and Guerra is a longstanding one, as Luxottica started producing the Prada and Miu Miu eyewear collections in 2003. Also, Luxottica veteran executive Massimo Vian joined Prada as chief of industrial production two years ago.

In March 2017, Guerra spoke at Prada’s first conference on sustainability, called “Shaping a Creative Future.”

Guerra’s possible arrival at Prada comes shortly after the news that Raf Simons, who is co-creative director with Miuccia Prada of the company’s signature line, is shuttering his namesake fashion collection, leading to speculation about an increased commitment at Prada."

Christian Dior recently combined six buildings originally acquired by the brand’s founder in the 1940s, creating a sprawling store, museum, restaurant, luxury suites and spa that opened earlier this year. In 2016, Fendi moved its offices out of the Palazzo Fendi in Rome to make room for an expanded store, hotel, and haute fourrure atelier, while American jeweller Tiffany & Co’s iconic New York flagship is currently undergoing a major renovation.

Louis Vuitton’s headquarters is just steps from La Samaritaine, a department store in which LVMH invested more than $1 billion to acquire and transform into a luxury hotel and tax-free shopping mall.

How LVMH's jewelry brand FRED is achieving success in China - The CEO Magazine,"Mon, 07 Nov 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWNlb21hZ2F6aW5lLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy9yZXRhaWwtd2hvbGVzYWxlL2NoYXJsZXMtbGV1bmctbHZtaC1mcmVkLWpld2Vscnkv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"According to a recent report from global management consulting firm Bain & Company, the COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on the global fine jewelry and wristwatch market; in 2020 alone, sales shrank by around 15 percent.

And while French luxury giant LVMH was not spared in this downtown – its watch and jewelry division was down by 23 percent – its fine jewelry brand FRED bucked the trend in terms of sales growth in 2020, with total sales of around US$100 million. The Asian market made the largest contribution to these figures, generating 57 percent of sales for the brand, with a staggering 22 percent of revenue from China alone.

“We believe that fine jewelry should be freely integrated into daily life, be worn in different ways, on different occasions and should not be limited to occasions with formal dress codes.” – Charles Leung

This is the first time in the history of LVMH that an Asian from China has been appointed to the top leadership position of one of its luxury brands. Charles Leung, who was appointed by LVMH as Global CEO of FRED in November 2018, has led the brand to stunning success. Originally from Hong Kong, he has 26 years of experience in the jewelry industry to date.

“I am both Asian and Chinese, so I understand the needs of the Asian market and can tell the story of the brand to Asian consumers more effectively. I also understand the type of customers that suit our brand’s products and positioning, so I’m able to identify the target customers quickly and accurately,” he tells The CEO Magazine.

Catering to younger customers

Are you seeing more younger consumers buying fine jewelry nowadays?

Leung: Of course, people’s perceptions of fine jewelry are different from the past. Fine jewelry used to be a luxury item that you splurge on once in your lifetime, so the designs were more dramatic and striking. But these days, fine jewelry is becoming more versatile and it’s perfect for everyday wear.

FRED has always been good at designing functional fine jewelry, such as the Audacious necklace from the Pretty Woman collection, which can be worn in seven different ways. When disassembled, the necklace can be transformed into different jewelry pieces, including earrings, a brooch, a lapel pin and a long necklace, making it ideal for young people with a flexible lifestyle.

Millennials and gen Z have become the largest consumer group for fine jewelry in China. What are your thoughts on this?

Leung: Young Chinese consumers have high demands for jewelry, especially for pieces that are simple in design, versatile and meaningful. Compared to European consumers, Chinese consumers are more casual and free in the way they dress and are more willing to try different fashion styles. They know how to use jewelry to highlight their personality and style, which coincides with FRED’s brand spirit.

FRED originates from the Côte d’Azur in France and embodies the spirit of freedom and spontaneity. We believe that fine jewelry should be freely integrated into daily life, be worn in different ways, on different occasions and should not be limited to occasions with formal dress codes. The life philosophy of the younger generation in China is in line with the brand’s spirit and development direction.

Is FRED changing strategies to market to younger customers?

Leung: Yes, not only for advertising, but we are also focusing more on our social media content, hoping to reach out to the younger generation. We have also been appointing younger celebrities as ‘Friends of the Brand’.

How do you foresee the future of the jewelry industry in China?

Leung: I think the customer base is getting younger and younger. The ladies are able to purchase jewelry for themselves to wear with their friends, instead of waiting for it to be given to them by their partners. As people develop a better knowledge of and appreciation for jewelry, the number of people buying fine jewelry as an investment will also increase.

People are more inclined to look for unique gemstones, and they’re now focusing more on the traceability of stones. In the future, more men will be wearing jewelry with casual outfits, in the same way they wear watches.

Leveraging the fan economy to drive new growth

Are young Chinese customers more inclined to buy the same design as the celebrities?

Leung: Of course, that’s why we invite celebrities to become brand spokespeople and ‘Friends of the Brand’. We work with lots of celebrities every month, providing them with jewelry to match their outfits during magazine photoshoots and a variety show filming. Many customers will tell us: “I love this jewelry because I saw a celebrity wearing it.”

Brands are capitalizing on the ‘Fan Economy’ in China, and this can bring high rewards but also high risks when scandals engulf a celebrity endorser. What does FRED take into consideration when inviting a celebrity to become a brand spokesperson?

Leung: In terms of risk, we can’t predict the future, so the brand can’t work with any celebrities just because they have millions of followers. It is also important to have a good understanding of a celebrity’s character. They must have the same values as the brand and be positive, have sunny personalities and a love for sport and life.

For example, Guan Xiaotong, our FRED Wish spokesperson, is herself a customer of the brand and also fits the brand’s image. FRED gained fame in China after she posted a photo of the Force 10 bracelet given to her by her boyfriend, Lu Han, on social media.

It attracted a lot of public attention, so it was only logical to invite her to become a spokesperson for the brand. Guan Xiaotong knows the brand well. She is very professional and the way she manages her self-image gives us peace of mind.

Will FRED be appointing or collaborating with more male celebrity ambassadors in the future?

Leung: In 2019, we invited Fan Chengcheng, who was only 19 at the time, to become FRED’s first China Brand spokesman, which completely changed the public’s perceptions of the brand. We’re considering the possibility of inviting both male and female celebrities to endorse future collections.

Some brands hire male celebrities in the hope that they can attract female customers, but we want a male spokesperson to demonstrate how to wear the jewelry to our male customers.

Using ecommerce platforms to enhance interactions with customers

In 2020, FRED became the first LVMH brand to open an official flagship store on Tmall. What were your thoughts at the time?

Leung: Someone had to be the first to do it, right? LVMH is very supportive of me trying new things, and e-commerce is the current trend. FRED did not have much of a presence in China at that time, and for consumers, ecommerce platforms and social media are channels for getting information from the brand, asking questions, communicating and buying products.

The move to join an online shopping platform was in line with the brand’s DNA of innovating and embracing the future. Having an ecommerce store is also a great way to connect with our customers, especially the younger generation and female customers.

Of course, we are very strict with our image control and the way our products are sold on Tmall. FRED’s official flagship store on Tmall is completely managed by us – from product selection and pricing to business strategies and marketing activities.

Tmall is also very smart in giving us this freedom because they want to understand the LVMH brands and learn how to work with us to create greater value together. Our flagship store on Tmall is now one of the top 10 FRED stores worldwide.

As China’s ecommerce industry continues to grow, what innovative methods will FRED use to market its products in the future?



Leung: Trade secret, ha! This industry is very competitive, which is why we’ve spent a great deal of time working with top technology experts to enhance the customer experience. But ecommerce can never replace brick-and-mortar stores, so we’ve created technology integrated interactive experiences in our physical stores. In the future, we will also introduce more innovations and use digital devices to enhance our customers’ shopping experience both online and offline.

Implementing sustainability measures and building a green business

These days, consumers – especially young consumers – are very concerned about what brands are doing to become more sustainable. What are FRED’s initiatives in this area?

Leung: Sustainability is very important to our brand and customers. First of all, FRED is a member of the Responsible Jewelry Council and ensures that everything is done in compliance with business ethics, human rights and social and environmental performance when sourcing gold and diamonds of the highest standard.

Second, our brick-and-mortar stores have one of the lowest energy consumptions of any luxury brand, at half the average amount. We also try to reduce our carbon footprint by shipping goods by sea whenever possible.

In addition, we are consciously making better choices for the environment by implementing many green initiatives in our offices, such as not serving coffee in capsules and using fair trade ground coffee instead; removing the individual litter bin for each cubicle and using public litter bin instead, which prompts people to think about whether they can reuse the waste paper they’re holding before they throw it away. As a result, the amount of garbage has reduced. We also don’t print out presentation slides for meeting attendees, which reduces paper use.

LVMH’s shareholders pay close attention to each brand’s sustainability philosophy and practices, so we have to set KPIs and report to them every year. The brand’s young employees in Paris are also particularly concerned about sustainability issues and provide the company with plenty of suggestions. This is our way of living with the planet, and we will continue to practice green development in the future.

Charles Leung’s business philosophy toward success

How do you build a successful business?

Leung: First of all, you need to hire outstanding talent and teams. Recruit the most suitable people, motivate them and challenge them. The leader must have a clear and meaningful business target to get everyone to work towards a common goal and grow together.

When you’re faced with challenges, you must seize the opportunities, take the risks and accept failure; crying or getting hurt is part of the learning process.

As a game changer in the industry, can you share the secret to running a successful business?

Leung: You have to know the brand like the back of your hand and do what is beneficial for the brand in the long-term. Everything we do has to make sense for the brand and help build it. We can’t just focus on short-term profits.

A former boss once told me: “A luxury brand that existed before us will continue to exist after us. We’re just a passer-by, therefore we have to put our egos aside to make the right decisions for the brand.”

Each brand has its own unique set of values, and I’m very fortunate to be an advocate of the brand during this journey.

Cassidy STEPHENS Published

Nov 8, 2022

The world's number one luxury goods company will be able to set up its new research center on the Saclay plateau in Essonne near the Polytechnique engineering school, despite protests from several students and alumni.







The innovation and research park, on land owned by the Paris-Saclay public development establishment. - Site de Polytechnique



Polytechnique's board of directors has validated by 19 votes for, 4 against and one abstention the sale, to LVMH of land near the school.



The project, called LVMH Gaia, will eventually bring together 300 researchers on a site of 22,500 square meters, according to LVMH, which intends to invest more than 100 million euros in the future building.

The research center dedicated to ""sustainable and digital luxury"" of 's group, who he himself is a polytechnician, plans to invest 2 million euros per year for five years on research partnerships with Polytechnique, nicknamed the X.



The land, located within the innovation park of the Institut Polytechnique de Paris, which includes five schools, including Ecole Polytechnique, belongs to the Paris-Saclay public development establishment. Since the plot chosen by LVMH is close to the engineering school, the latter had a veto until 2025.



Since its official announcement this summer, several Polytechnique students and alumni have expressed their opposition to the project, notably through a collective called ""Polytechnique is not for sale!"" This group is demanding that the LVMH center be built outside the campus and that the land in the northeast zone of the campus, including the parcel coveted by LVMH, be reallocated to the use of the Institut Polytechnique de Paris.



An article published in Le Monde at the beginning of September signed by 73 alumni referred to a ""noxious project"" that ""works on technical problems far removed from the school's research themes: replacing plastics with more ecological alternatives in perfume packaging, developing more efficient recommendation algorithms to increase the quantity of products sold, etc.""





""This is not the end of the protest""





The signatories accused LVMH of wanting to ""cement a fake respectability on the environmental issue and secure a privileged access to the students of the campus, while the schools benefits would be extremely slim, both financially and scientifically.""



Matthieu Lequesne, spokesman for ""Polytechnique is not for sale!"", told AFP that four votes against and one abstention in a board of directors ""which always votes unanimously"" is a strong sign of opposition. ""The last time there was so much opposition was in 2016,"" he said.



""This is not the end of the protest,"" he assures, ""the users of the campus are in majority against this project.""



However, nothing certifies that LVMH will acquire the land, according to the spokesman of the collective. The director of strategy of the luxury group, Jean Baptiste Voisin, left doubt Monday in Les Echos.



If the board of directors of Polytechnique does not oppose the purchase of the land by LVMH, ""we will have the opportunity to buy it, but it is not said that we will. This is just one of many options for setting up in the Paris region, and we are studying all of them,"" said Voisin, who is also general secretary of the Institut Polytechnique de Paris alumni association.



The project is ""completely transposable"", according to him, ""you take it by helicopter, you drop it where you want"".



In January, the TotalEnergies group gave up its plan to build its new research and development center on land also located near the École Polytechnique after teachers and students opposed to the project protested.

Pedemonte is currently under the control of Luxembourg-based private-equity firm Equinox, which owns a 66% stake in the business through its Equinox III fund, according to the investment group’s website. Headquartered in the northern Italian city of Valenza, it came into being in 2020 upon the merger of several independent production workshops. The parties did not give any financial details of the latest transaction.

Pedemonte operates in Valenza and the nearby town of Valmadonna, as well as in Paris. The company employs 350 artisans and employees across five business-to-business (B2B) brands and the Vendorafa consumer label.

Paris-based LVMH, which owns Bulgari, Tiffany & Co., and Chaumet, said the deal would significantly increase the group’s production capacity. It comes less than a month after Kering-owned jewelry retailer Pomellato announced the takeover of a minority interest in goldsmith company Costanzo & Rizzetto, also located in Valenza.

The acquisition will allow LVMH to “significantly increase its production capacity,” a statement said, adding that “existing workshops are mobilizing all their resources to support the strong growth of [LVMH’s jewelry and watch] division.”

The company currently employs 350 artisans and employees.

In the statement, Gian Andrea Garrone, chairman and CEO of Pedemonte Group, said joining LVMH “will allow us to maintain our ambitions in terms of development, training and strengthening of our human resources, the heart of our activities. We will also pursue an ambitious investment policy to meet new challenges, particularly in technology.”

The acquisition will give LVMH “a partner recognized for its know-how to support their growth and maintain their leadership in jewelry,” said Antonio Belloni, managing director of the LVMH group, in a statement.

LVMH has made its jewelry and watch division a priority, particularly after it purchased Tiffany & Co. in 2021.

Global luxury group LVMH said that, as an old friend of the China International Import Expo, it is witnessing the country's trade opening-up along the way, and will continue to strengthen the bonds with Chinese consumers.

LVMH Board Member Antoine Arnault, said in a greeting video during the 2022 CIIE that LVMH has forged a solid and fruitful relationship with China.

""We have witnessed and participated in China's tremendous growth, development and further opening-up to foreign trade ever since the early 1990s,"" he said.

Andrew Wu, president of LVMH Greater China, agreed: ""The CIIE is an important signal of China's continued opening-up, through which the country reaches out to rest of the world and promotes new connections. Believing in this huge market's great vitality, each time when our group participates in the CIIE, we demonstrate our confidence and proactively engage with audiences above and beyond the expo"".

""We find that China is more than a market unparalleled by its size and participant compliance, it is also a partnership ecosystem, all contributing to the performance of our products and our Maisons,"" Arnault said.

This year, with a theme of ""Reconnection"", LVMH showcased exhibits from 14 of its Maisons to the expo.

For example, Bulgari displayed its first High Jewelry Digital Collectibles, a latest watch linked with Web 3.0, Heritage Interactive 3D Hologram and the Bulgari Microverse for visitors to dive in.

Using digital technology, Dior took attendees on a virtual reality tour of 30 Avenue Montaigne in Paris.

Global luxury travel retailer DFS, participating in the CIIE for the first time, launched the first luxury travel retail metaverse with its Beauty Guides as personal concierges to the virtual luxury playground.

Paying homage to the Chinese market, Fendi presented a special Baguette bag inspired by the Great Wall in Beijing.

""We are determined to continue strengthening our long-lasting bonds with Chinese consumers,"" Arnault said.

How Burberry can take on LVMH | Mint - Mint,"Tue, 22 Nov 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxpdmVtaW50LmNvbS9vcGluaW9uL2NvbHVtbnMvYnVyYmVycnlzLWJyaXRpc2gtaGVyaXRhZ2UtY2FuLWhlbHAtdGhlLWdyb3VwLXRha2Utb24tbHZtaC0xMTY2ODk2Mzc5Njc1MC5odG1s0gF7aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubGl2ZW1pbnQuY29tL29waW5pb24vY29sdW1ucy9idXJiZXJyeXMtYnJpdGlzaC1oZXJpdGFnZS1jYW4taGVscC10aGUtZ3JvdXAtdGFrZS1vbi1sdm1oL2FtcC0xMTY2ODk2Mzc5Njc1MC5odG1s?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"New Burberry Group’s chief executive officer Jonathan Akeroyd and its highly regarded creative director Daniel Lee have an opportunity to create a British rival to France’s LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE in the global market for luxury products.

Plans to increase sales from just under £3 billion ($3.6 billion) last year to £4 billion in three to five years time, and £5 billion thereafter, look achievable.

There’s just the small matter of a potential downturn in luxury—particularly in the US—to navigate.

While previous CEO Marco Gobbetti made progress in taking Burberry closer to the likes of Louis Vuitton and Dior, there is more work to do make the fashion house best known for its black, white, tan and red check into a super-luxe company.

Gobbetti and former designer Riccardo Tisci never achieved the sort of buzz that Alessandro Michele generated after he took control of the creative direction of Kering SA’s Gucci. But Akeroyd and Lee are capable of building on their predecessors’ platform—elevating the brand and adding the high fashion halo that has been missing.

Making more of Burberry’s Britishness —which is expected to be a key plank of Akeroyd’s strategy—is long overdue. Previous marketing and advertising efforts were disjointed. Focusing on Burberry’s heritage and made-in-Britain status should give the fashion house more of a coherent identity.

Akeroyd wants to broadly double sales of leather goods, shoes and women’s clothing and expand outerwear sales by 50% in the next three to five years. Longer term, he aims to increase accessories from 36% of sales to over 50%.

The new CEO’s goal is “good margin progression"" on top of the 20% that Burberry already had in its plans. Leather goods are the profit drivers of the industry, with successful handbags generating gross margins of over 80%, so if the company can sell more It bags, that goal looks realistic. Apart from a formidable creative reputation, designer Daniel Lee also has a strong track record in leather goods. At Bottega Veneta, for example, he developed a number of best-selling handbags, such as the Cassette and the squishy Pouch. His shoes, such as his woven mules, sparked a rash of imitations across the high street.

Even so, there are perils that Burberry must watch out for. Akeroyd’s new strategy comes as the luxury boom—particularly in the US—is fading. While Burberry beat estimates for comparable sales growth in the first half, helped by tourists in Europe, it warned of recessionary risks in Europe and the US, where there is less demand for less expensive high-end items as more marginal luxury buyers begin to feel the pinch.

Meanwhile, to ensure Burberry meets its targets, the Chinese market needs to reopen. A crackdown on ostentatious luxury and a weakening housing market raise the question of just how strong top-end appetite will be when this happens. And Lee will need some time to work his magic. In the interlude, Burberry must compete for sales with the more muscular brands, from Kering and LVMH’s stable of fashion houses to a resurgent Prada SpA.

There is another potential pitfall: Excitement is high about Lee’s rejuvenation. He will unveil his first collection in February. Shares are up about 13% since his appointment in September. That is heaping a lot of pressure on the relatively young designer who left Bottega Veneta suddenly a year ago and now needs to get fashionistas buying Burberry again. Akeroyd will have to support him. Luckily, the group’s CEO has experience managing creative talent (never an easy job), such as that of Donatella Versace when he led Capri Holdings Ltd’s Versace.

There is a lot riding on this turnaround. If Akeroyd gets it right, then he has the chance to create a British luxury powerhouse—the country’s answer to LVMH. A successful revival could be a stepping stone to acquiring other heritage names, with Mulberry Group the most obvious candidate.

But if the CEO fails to generate sufficient traction, Burberry could be vulnerable to a takeover bid itself—from LVMH or Kering, which would be the better fit given its capabilities in fashion. Not only is Burberry one of the few high-end brands unencumbered by a family shareholding, but it had net cash of over £600 million at the end of the first half of its fiscal year to March 2023.

So, as CEO, Akeroyd needs to keep investors’ expectations in check—but he should not curb his ambitions for this British institution that’s yet to live up to its full potential.

Background:

A new fashion docuseries, “Kingdom of Dreams,” explores the luxury fashion industry’s formation in the 1990s to the 2000s, examining some of the industry’s most recognisable designers of that period — John Galliano, Alexander McQueen, Marc Jacobs and Tom Ford — as well as executives like Kering’s François Pinault and LVMH’s Bernard Arnault.

Ian Bonhôte and Peter Ettedgui highlight the tension between commerce and creativity, as well as the rivalries between luxury groups and their designers.

“At the end of the day, we never said anything that hasn’t been said or which is not sort of present,” said Bonhôte. “So the truth is very important. And we are … definitely not scandalous.”

This week on The BoF Podcast, BoF’s editor-at-large Tim Blanks speaks with Bonhôte and Ettedgui about understanding pressures of consumerism and what makes a fashion house business tick.

Key Insights:

The creators highlighted the gap between creativity “wizards” and business “emperors” within some of fashion’s largest fashion houses, demonstrating the power of tycoons François Pinault and Bernard Arnault. “What we felt was the most interesting drama is there is this constant fight between commerce and creativity,” said Bonhôte.

The series also highlights the pressures on designers to double the volume of collections and the impact of that growth on the planet. “It is disturbing to see the fallout and not just the fallout psychologically for the designers, but also for the planet as fashion speeds up,” said Ettedgui.

While examining the industry the creators wanted the audience to gain a new understanding of fashion rather than the gated community it can be perceived as. “It’s a very difficult industry for people to actually understand because I think the [understanding of] fashion is almost wrong,” said Bonhôte.

Founded in 2014, LVMH’s Institute of Metiers d’Excellence offers apprenticeships across 27 professions. In partnership with U.S. jeweler Tiffany & Co., now an LVMH brand, this inaugural program in the U.S. will focus on the art of jewelry design and fabrication.

“By providing an exceptional cohort of apprentices with the opportunity to learn from experienced craftspeople, Métiers d'Excellence ensures that these skills are passed on to early career professionals, and teaches apprentices to uphold LVMH's longstanding standards of excellence,"" said Gena Smith, New York-based chief human resources officer of LVMH North America, in a statement.

Tiffany is the leading jewelry brand in the U.S., competing directly with Cartier and Van Cleef & Arpels, as well as its fellow LVMH label Bulgari.

Mastering jewelry

After a rigorous review process, eight people were chosen to be the program’s first cohort.

Over the course of two years, they will be trained in the art of artisanal, design and retail excellence.

This provides learners the opportunity for hands-on learning and direct work experience, including rotations in Tiffany’s workshops.

It also trains learners in LVMH’s signature savoir-faire.

The two brands worked closely with the New York State Department of Labor to ensure that participants would leave the program with a portable and nationally recognized credential.

The program also gives those from historically underrepresented communities an opportunity for inclusion.

""The Métiers d'Excellence initiative will enable us to reinforce the diversity and inclusivity of Tiffany & Co.'s workforce through one of our core pillars of Tiffany Atrium – education.,” said Mary Bellai, global chief human resources officer of New York-based Tiffany & Co., in a statement.

“Our efforts will support the long-term growth and development of students, early career professionals and educational institutions in the U.S.,"" she said."
Beverly Hills City Council gives final sign off to Cheval Blanc hotel on Rodeo Drive - la.urbanize.city,"Thu, 03 Nov 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vbGEudXJiYW5pemUuY2l0eS9wb3N0L2JldmVybHktaGlsbHMtY2l0eS1jb3VuY2lsLWdpdmVzLWZpbmFsLXNpZ24tY2hldmFsLWJsYW5jLWhvdGVsLXJvZGVvLWRyaXZl0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"More than two years after announcing plans for a posh hotel on Rodeo Drive, French conglomerate LVMH has secured approvals for the Cheval Blanc Beverly Hills.

The project, which saw its development agreement approved earlier this week by the Beverly Hills City Council , would rise from a property along the south side of little Santa Monica Boulevard between Rodeo and Beverly Drives, replacing a former Brooks Brothers retail store and the Paley Center for Media. Plans call for an approximately 220,000-square-foot building featuring up to 115 guest rooms with restaurant space, and a private club.

The Cheval Blanc - designed by New York-based architect Peter Marino is designing the Cheval Blanc with Los Angeles-based Gruen Associates serving as architect of record - would be a mid-rise structure ranging from four to nine stories in height, reaching an architectural apex of 115 feet. Plans call for a series of upper level terraces and setbacks which would be used to create guest amenity spaces, outdoor dining areas, and swimming pools. The building would be clad in limestone.

Images also show that public art would also be incorporated into the design of the hotel, highlighted by a proposed sculpture planned in conjunction and pedestrian plaza at the corner of Rodeo and Santa Monica.

Per an environmental study circulated by the City of Beverly Hills reiterates an earlier approximated timeline for the project, stating that the Cheval Blanc would be built over a roughly 38-month period commencing concluding in 2026.

Per a staff report to the City Council, rooms at the Cheval Blanc are expected to cost an average daily rate of $1,925. That includes entry-level rooms which would start at approximately $1,167 per night to as much as $20,600 for the penthouse. The development agreement will require LVMH to make a $26 million general public benefits payment to the City of Beverly Hills, as well as a $2 million payment for arts and cultural purposes. Likewise, a 5 percent surcharge will be applied to all hotel rooms in addition to the standard transient occupancy tax of 14 percent.

Under terms of the agreement, LVMH is required to commence construction of the project within one year of obtaining final approval - meaning the resolution of any lawsuit or referendum relating to the Cheval Blanc. After that point, the hotel would need to be completed within five years. LVMH also has options for four one-year extensions of its approvals with an additional payment of $1 million each time. Should the developer fail to complete the project, the agreement stipulates that LVMH would pay the City of Beverly Hills $52 million - including forfeiture of the $26 million public benefits payment and $2 million arts fee, plus $24 million in liquidated damages.

Plans for the Cheval Blanc, which would be the first U.S. outpost for the brand, originated in 2018, which Paris-based LVMH reportedly purchased the former Brooks Brothers building for $245 million. LVMH, the parent company of Louis Vuitton, currently operates five Cheval Blanc locations.

“We are extraordinarily excited to reach this milestone and to embark on creating America’s first Cheval Blanc as an iconic new anchor for the north end of Rodeo Drive,” said LVMH, Inc.'s U.s. chairman and chief executive Anish Melwani in a news release. “We wish to thank Mayor [Lili] Bosse and the City Council, City staff, and the entire community for their partnership and collaboration to help shape this legacy investment in Beverly Hills.”

The Cheval Blanc is one of several new hotels planned in Beverly Hills, including an adaptive reuse project that would transform the landmarked Gibraltar Square office complex and a ground-up development slated for South Lasky Drive.

The Cheval Blanc is not the only hotel LVMH is looking to open in the Los Angeles area. In Benedict Canyon, the company is partnering with developer Gary Safady on a contentious project which would bring a 58-room Bulgari Hotel to a 33-acre hillside property."

Over the past 160 years, the French label has expanded beyond luggage and leather goods to fashion and accessories to pop-up restaurants and interactive exhibitions. Now, it’s opening a hotel. Chairman and CEO Michael Burke has told Women’s Wear Daily that the brand’s headquarters in Paris, France, will soon be turned into a giant complex featuring the world’s first Louis Vuitton hotel and the largest-ever LV boutique.

With spectacular views stretching from the Eiffel Tower to the Notre-Dame cathedral, the storied Vuitton building is located by the Church of Saint Germain l’Auxerrois in the first arrondissement. Burke says this neighborhood was once “a no man’s land,” but Louis Vuitton’s parent company, LVMH Moët Hennessy, has radically transformed it over the past 18 months.

The world’s largest luxury conglomerate has opened the lavish new Cheval Blanc hotel, spruced up the La Samaritaine department store and unveiled a new Cova pastry outpost. According to Burke, LVMH’s chairman and CEO Bernard Arnault is just getting started, too, with even more venues and businesses in the Parisian pipeline. The move reflects the growing demand for high-end experiences in addition to top-tier products. “That’s what our clients want from us,” Burke told WWD. “They want a 24/7 relationship.” The dramatic transformation of the 400,000-square-foot headquarters started this week with the launch of a new experiential space called LV Dream. Set to remain open for a year, the 20,000-square-foot pop-up features an exhibition of LV’s collaborations with artists, along with a gift store plus a cafe and chocolate shop run by the head pastry chef at Cheval Blanc Paris. Burke says the event space will “most probably” be turned into Vuitton’s largest store, while the hotel is expected to open elsewhere in the building within five years.

In this latest instalment in STYLE’s Conversation series profiling the luxury world’s movers and shakers, the house’s CEO Lisa Attia talks about her plans for its rejuvenation and coming expansion in Asia.

Moynat, today owned by luxury goods behemoth LVMH , is one of the oldest French luxury brands, established in Paris back in 1849 and known for its trunks and travel collections.

When I took my position at Moynat, it was in the middle of the Covid-19 pandemic. We have managed to stabilise the business and despite such conditions, built a team that shares a common passion for savoir faire, from head office, to workshop and boutiques – all ready for the future.

What are the brand’s biggest challenges?

Moynat has entered a growth phase with new creative director Nicholas Knightly. Artisanal craftsmanship and exceptional savoir faire are the DNA of Moynat – it is widely known mostly by connoisseurs at this point.

We are looking at recruiting new clients that will know how to appreciate our story and products. It is the moment to reassert Moynat’s notoriety and desirability through transmission of our know-how and the new shapes that are relevant today.

How do you keep an almost two-centuries-old brand relevant today?

Since its inception in 1849, Moynat has been famous for its constant technical innovation and high-quality leather goods. We are keeping these two strong assets in mind when it comes to new creative outcomes.

More than ever, new waves of clients are sensitive to these key points. They appreciate the new shapes as well as the heritage of our craftsmanship from the 19th and 20th centuries.

One example: our M monogram canvas, first born in the 1920s, has been modernised, and is growing in popularity among the “new to brand” [customers]. It is indeed a timeless signature that remains relevant today.

It’s said that a majority of Moynat’s consumers are from Asia. What’s your strategy for the region for the next three to five years?

It is true to say that Asia is a dominant market for the luxury industry . For Moynat too, most of our clients are from Asia, however we’re also seeing significant growth from the Middle East and US.

In the near future, rather than opening more stores, we are rebuilding our narratives and retail concepts to strengthen the brand positioning. We are also extending our retail reach online at the end of October.

What did you focus on during the pandemic?

It was important to keep healthy first of all. We looked into training our brand ambassadors, creating new shapes, refreshing some emblematic creations and strengthening our product offer. We focused on ramping up our one-to-one tools to be more client-centric, extending our retail to online in selected countries and ensuring that we are at their service in more channels. Soon, it will be possible to order a personalised canvas bag on Moynat.com – for a boutique brand, that is a huge leap towards client centricity.

What’s your advice to women who aspire to join the luxury industry?

Pauline Moynat led the way by being the first woman to own and run a trunk-making business, in the mid-19th century: she’s still an amazing inspiration for the women of today.

The luxury industry promotes the most women into leading roles. LVMH has a total of 16 female CEOs among its brands, being an empowering example for women.

Key words are “authenticity” and “believe in yourself”: things will move if you go for it!

How Much Will LVMH Pay Beverly Hills to Build a Hotel? - The Real Deal,"Thu, 03 Nov 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vdGhlcmVhbGRlYWwuY29tL2xhLzIwMjIvMTEvMDMvaG93LW11Y2gtd2lsbC1sdm1oLXBheS1iZXZlcmx5LWhpbGxzLXRvLWJ1aWxkLWEtaG90ZWwv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"It costs big bucks to bring a luxury hotel to the 90210 zip code.

French retailer LVMH will have to pay the city of Beverly Hills at least $28 million in public benefit fees to build its Cheval Blanc hotel on Rodeo Drive, according to a development agreement revealed at a City Council meeting on Tuesday. The council approved the deal in a 5-1 vote, with councilmember John Mirisch voting against the deal.

Under the agreement, LVMH must pay $26 million in public benefit fees within 30 days of the City Council issuing final approval of the project or when a building permit is issued — whichever comes earlier.

In addition, LVMH must pay $2 million that will go towards arts and culture purposes, though the city did not further describe what that entails.

The nine-story, 115-key hotel is set to rise at 468 Rodeo Drive, a property formerly occupied by Brooks Brothers. The Beverly Hills City Council unanimously approved the plans for the building in September, pending an approved development agreement.

“It’s becoming for Beverly Hills to become its new home,” Councilmember Sharona Nazarian said at the Tuesday meeting. “I see both monetary and non-monetary benefits for the city from this development agreement.”

The development is set to be a revenue windfall for the city, according to fiscal analyses conducted by both LVMH and the city.

Over 30 years, the project is expected to generate at least $725 million in general revenues — more than $500 million of which will come from transient occupancy taxes and municipal surcharges.

“It’s a staggering amount of money,” Beverly Hills Vice Mayor Julian Gold said at the Tuesday meeting. “There are cities where that is their general fund.”

Under the agreement, guests will have to pay an additional 5 percent municipal surcharge per night — in addition to a 14 percent transient occupancy tax the city already charges hotel guests.

“I support the idea of an LVMH hotel,” said Mirisch. “But the devil is always in the details.”

Mirisch, the only councilmember to vote against the agreement, said he thinks the proposed hotel is too tall, and that the city should have charged LVMH more.

“Don’t be concerned about LVMH’s finances,” he said. “They’re doing quite well.”

Beverly Hills is known for charging millions through development agreements. Beny Alagem and Cain International, the developers behind the $2 billion, mixed-use development One Beverly Hills, will pay the city $100 million in public benefit fees over the next eight years.

That agreement also included the same 5 percent municipal surcharge on luxury hotel rooms at the new Wilshire hotel at One Beverly Hills — set to be an Aman hotel — and the Beverly Hilton."
Guillaume Motte to Take the Reins of Sephora - BeautyMatter,"Tue, 29 Nov 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vYmVhdXR5bWF0dGVyLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy9ndWlsbGF1bWUtbW90dGUtdG8tdGFrZS10aGUtcmVpbnMtb2Ytc2VwaG9yYdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LVMH announced the appointment of Guillaume Motte as President and CEO of Sephora. Since June, Chris de Lapuente, who also heads LVMH's selective distribution division, has held this position. He stepped in following the unexpected resignation of Martin Brok after only two years ""due to a divergence of views.""

Guillaume Motte is already familiar with the Sephora business, having served as deputy CEO of LVMH Fashion Group in 2021 in a newly created role reporting to Sidney Toledano, Chairman and CEO. The LVMH division has a stable of brands that include Celine, Givenchy, Marc Jacobs, Loewe, Emilio Pucci, PatouKenzo, and Rossimoda.

Before that, Motte served as Sephora Europe and Middle East President, beginning March 2018. In that role, he was credited with strong brand-building and accelerating the retailer's omnichannel reach in the markets. Sephora reentered Germany after a 16-year absence under Motte's leadership, launching what was a next-generation store concept at the time.

Before joining LVMH, Motte served as CEO of French menswear retailer Celio. Before that he was Chief Executive at Dubai-based lifestyle retail company AI Tayer Trends and Managing Director at retail chain Fnac, which was part of Pinault-Printemps-Redoute at the time.

De Lapuente welcomed Motte back to Sephora. ""His experiences over the past two years in LVMH Fashion Group, alongside Sidney Toledano, have broadened his prestige brand-building expertise and deepened his already extensive retail and business skills at a global level,"" de Lapuente said. ""Guillaume is an inspiring and much-admired leader who has always personified Sephora's unique passion and culture.”

""Guillaume has the wonderful balance of being strong on retail execution and yet strategic and forward-thinking in his outlook,"" de Lapuente continued. ""He has deep understanding of all the elements that make Sephora the world's best loved beauty community. I have no doubt he will continue to build Sephora into the extraordinary premium beauty retailer we envision. I am extremely happy that we will be working together again.""

Motte's appointment comes as the beauty retailer eyes international growth, currently operating in 35 countries with more than 2,700 stores. Sephora is the only prestige beauty retailer with a global presence, but growing regional omnichannel players are increasing its competitiveness.

After acquiring British beauty e-tailer Feelunique in July 2021, Sephora has started its relaunch in the UK market, beginning with an online launch and followed by the opening of a London brick-and-mortar store in March 2023. The retailer is also focused on growing its business in China, Latin America, and Asia.

Digital transformation plans are also underway under the leadership of former Apple executive Marc Abergel, Sephora's first Chief Digital Officer. The retailer partnered with digital commerce company Commercetools in July to unify its in-store and online shopping experience while offering a more personalized user experience.

Sephora has returned to pre-pandemic levels, with industry sources estimating its revenues will surpass €‎10 billion in 2022."
LVMH Strengthens Jewellery Position With Pedemonte Acquisition - India's leading B2B gem and jewellery magazine - Solitaire International,"Mon, 28 Nov 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vZ2plcGMub3JnL3NvbGl0YWlyZS9sdm1oLXN0cmVuZ3RoZW5zLWpld2VsbGVyeS1wb3NpdGlvbi13aXRoLXBlZGVtb250ZS1hY3F1aXNpdGlvbi_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LVMH Group announced the acquisition, from the Equinox III SLP SIF investment fund, of the Pedemonte Group, a jewellery producer present in Italy and France. The group said the strategic acquisition would significantly increase its jewellery production capacity.

Created in 2020 from the merger of several independent production workshops, each with several decades of existence and experience, the Pedemonte Group is today a recognised player in jewellery manufacturing, LVMH said. With locations in the cities of Valenza and Valmadonna (Alessandria) in northern Italy, as well as in Paris, the Pedemonte Group combines cutting-edge technology with artisanal craftsmanship. It is involved in all the key stages of production and has demonstrated total excellence in execution in all its collaborations with LVMH Maisons.

The company currently employs 350 artisans and employees who will continue to provide, alongside the current management, their expertise, their skills and their know-how, sometimes passed from one generation to the next, to support the production of jewellery pieces for all of its customers.

Toni Belloni, Deputy Managing Director of the LVMH Group, said, “With this strategic acquisition for our Maisons, the LVMH Group further strengthens its presence in Italy while continuing to support the ecosystem of companies that contribute to the success of our Maisons. With Pedemonte, our Maisons will gain a partner recognised for its know-how to support their growth and maintain their leadership in jewellery.”

Gian Andrea Garrone, Chairman and CEO of Pedemonte Group, added, “Joining the LVMH Group is a source of pride and motivation for the entire management team and employees. This operation will allow us to maintain our ambitions in terms of development, training and strengthening of our human resources, the heart of our activities. We will also pursue an ambitious investment policy to meet new challenges, particularly in technology.”"
Sephora appoints new president and CEO - Vogue Business,"Thu, 24 Nov 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZvZ3VlYnVzaW5lc3MuY29tL2NvbXBhbmllcy9zZXBob3JhLWFwcG9pbnRzLW5ldy1wcmVzaWRlbnQtYW5kLWNlb9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"To receive the Vogue Business newsletter, sign up here.

Guillaume Motte has been appointed president and CEO of Sephora, as the beauty retailer continues to expand internationally. He moves over from parent company LVMH’s Fashion Group, where he has served as deputy chief executive under chairman and CEO Sidney Toledano since May 2021.

It’s a homecoming of sorts for Motte, whose first role within LVMH was as CEO and president of Europe and Middle East at Sephora in 2018, where he stayed for three years before moving to the fashion division. Before joining LVMH, he was CEO of French menswear retailer Celio, and prior to that was chief exec at Dubai-based lifestyle retail company AI Tayer Trends and managing director at retail chain Fnac, which was part of PPR (now known as Kering) at the time.

Motte replaces Chris de Lapuente, who has been in the role since former CEO Martin Brok made a surprise exit from Sephora in June. De Lapuente will now continue his position as chairman and CEO of the selective retailing division of LVMH, which includes Sephora, Parisian department store Le Bon Marché Rive Gauche, luxury travel retailer DFS, cruise ship shopping destination Starboard Cruise Services and fine foods store La Grande Épicerie.

“I am delighted to welcome Guillaume back to Sephora as president and CEO. His experiences over the past two years in LVMH Fashion Group, alongside Sidney Toledano, have broadened his prestige brand building experience and deepened his already extensive retail and business skills at a global level,” said de Lapuente in a post on LVMH’s LinkedIn. “I have no doubt he will continue to build Sephora into the extraordinary premium beauty retailer we envision.”

Sephora has a presence in 35 countries and has more than 2,700 stores. In October, the retailer reopened in the UK with an online store, a second attempt at cracking the market after a short run from 2000 to 2005. The company acquired British retailer Feelunique in 2021 and has transitioned the website to Sephora.co.uk to take advantage of the existing local consumer base. In June, Sephora launched its “China Accelebrate” business incubator programme which aims to grow premium Chinese beauty brands, and the company says expansion in Latin America and Asia is also underway.

The company has been focusing on dual digital and physical expansion with a focus on bricks-and-mortar since pandemic restrictions have lifted or eased. Sephora president of Europe and the Middle East Sylvie Moreau told Vogue Business earlier this month that she wants to raise its profile as a brand incubator for indie brands.

Firm behind Moët hails new ‘roaring 20s’ as wealthy drain stocks of champagne - The Guardian,"Wed, 16 Nov 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy8yMDIyL25vdi8xNS93ZWFsdGh5LWRyaW5raW5nLWRyeS1sdm1oLWNoYW1wYWduZS1sdXh1cnnSAVtodHRwczovL2FtcC50aGVndWFyZGlhbi5jb20vYnVzaW5lc3MvMjAyMi9ub3YvMTUvd2VhbHRoeS1kcmlua2luZy1kcnktbHZtaC1jaGFtcGFnbmUtbHV4dXJ5?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The company behind Moët & Chandon, Veuve Clicquot, Krug and Dom Pérignon has said it is “running out of stock on our best champagnes” as the wealthy spend big on luxury goods in a new “roaring 20s” age of decadence.

Working Britons may have suffered the biggest slump in living standards since records began in the 1950s, but according to the head of LVMH’s wines and spirits division, “pent-up demand” following the easing of coronavirus restrictions has prompted a run on the finest fizz.

The chief executive of Moët Hennessy, Philippe Schaus, said 2022 would be “a fabulous year” for its champagne – which starts at about £40 a bottle and can runs into the thousands – as evidenced by stocks running low in the company’s network of cellars that stretch for 17 miles under the town of Epernay in France’s Champagne region.

“We are running out of stock on our best champagnes. As people are coming out of Covid there’s been pent up demand for luxury, enjoyment and travelling,” Schaus told Bloomberg in an interview at New Economy Forum in Singapore on Tuesday.

He said the leap in demand had been so big that, internally, the company was referring to the current boom as “the roaring 20s”, a reference to the economic prosperity of a century ago.

Schaus – whose wines and spirits division includes Glenmorangie single malt whiskies, Belvedere vodka and New Zealand’s Cloudy Bay wine – did not state which champagnes were running low, or how low stocks had fallen.

In its latest financial results, LVMH said its “Champagne Maisons” had “enjoyed excellent momentum, which increased pressure on supplies”. The company, which is part-owned and run by France’s richest person, Bernard Arnault, said growth was particularly strong in Europe, the United States and Japan and had been “led by tourism recovery”. Overall, champagne and wine sales were up 32% in the first nine months of 2022 compared with 2021.

Earlier this year the Guardian reported soaring sales of champagne in City of London wine bars as bankers celebrated the biggest bonus season since before the 2008 global financial crisis.

It’s not just champagne that’s flying off shelves. Luxury goods companies across the world have recently reported booming sales in everything from designer label clothing and handbags to expensive watches and supercars as the ranks of the ultra wealthy hit record highs.

There are now record 218,200 people classed as ultra-high net worth (UHNW), with assets of more than $50m (£43.7m), according to research by the investment bank Credit Suisse. It said there had been “almost an explosion of wealth” during the recovery from the pandemic.

LVMH, the world’s largest luxury goods company, which also owns brands including Christian Dior, Stella McCartney, TAG Heuer watches and Bulgari and Tiffany jewellery, last month reported a 19% jump in third-quarter sales.

Jean-Jacques Guiony, LVMH’s chief financial officer, said that among his customers the economic downturn “has not materialised into full swing yet … if ever it does”.

Similar gains have been seen across the sector. Kering, which owns Gucci, Balenciaga and Bottega Veneta, reported a 14% increase in its third quarter sales.

Hermès, whose Birkin handbags can costs tens of thousands of pounds, reported a 24% jump in sales, compared with analyst expectations of 15%. The company’s finance director, Eric du Halgouet, said: “For the moment, we don’t see any sign of slowdown in any of our markets.”

Analysts predict that the boom in luxury goods is likely to continue as rich people spend the £2.52tn saved up during the pandemic.

The global luxury goods industry is expected to achieve total sales of £1.22tn this year, an increase of 21% on 2021, according to a report by analysts at Bain & Company and Italian luxury goods manufacturers’ industry association Altagamma.

The report, published on Tuesday, said the sector “remains poised to see further expansion next year, and for the rest of the decade to 2030, even in the face of present economic turbulence”.

It said the boom is expected to be driven by young people’s “more precocious attitude towards luxury”.

“In coming years, the spending of Gen Z and Gen Alpha is set to grow some three times faster than for other generations until 2030, making up a third of the market.

“This is, in part, driven by a more precocious attitude towards luxury, with Gen Z consumers starting to buy luxury items some three to five years earlier than millennials (at 15 years old, versus at 18 to 20), and Gen Alpha expected to behave in a similar way.”"
Dodge-a-Sweeney: here’s how celebrities avoid being jet-tracked on Twitter - Style,"Sat, 05 Nov 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMioAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5zY21wLmNvbS9tYWdhemluZXMvc3R5bGUvY2VsZWJyaXR5L2FydGljbGUvMzE5ODQ2MS9ob3ctZWxvbi1tdXNrLWFuZC1kb25hbGQtdHJ1bXAtZG9kZ2UtamV0LXRyYWNrZXJzLXR3aXR0ZXItZmx5aW5nLWluY29nbml0by1kb2VzLWl0LXdvcmstbHZtaC1ib3Nz0gGgAWh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLnNjbXAuY29tL21hZ2F6aW5lcy9zdHlsZS9jZWxlYnJpdHkvYXJ0aWNsZS8zMTk4NDYxL2hvdy1lbG9uLW11c2stYW5kLWRvbmFsZC10cnVtcC1kb2RnZS1qZXQtdHJhY2tlcnMtdHdpdHRlci1mbHlpbmctaW5jb2duaXRvLWRvZXMtaXQtd29yay1sdm1oLWJvc3M?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The programmes are not foolproof, and some high-profile people have ditched private jet ownership altogether. Celebrities like Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg are struggling to shake Twitter accounts that follow their private jets ’ every move.

American programmer Jack Sweeney has created a myriad of Twitter accounts that track private jets, like Elon Musk’s. To dodge Sweeney and other trackers, many celebrities have signed up for free federal programmes that help them fly incognito.

So, how does it work exactly?

Jet-tracking wunderkind Jack Sweeney

Sweeney helped ignite the trend in early 2022 when he made headlines for publicly tracking Elon Musk’s Gulfstream 650ER.

The 20-year-old uses a public website called ADS-B Exchange, which was founded in 2016 by IT professional Dan Streufert, to track the tail number, and a bot automatically uploads the flights to @ElonJet on Twitter.

The website aggregates flight information with the help of over 7,500 volunteer-run radios around the world that receive information from ADS-B-equipped aircraft, Streufert told the Airplane Geeks podcast.

According to the Federal Aviation Administration, ADS-B broadcasts information like GPS location, altitude and ground speed from one plane to ground stations and other aircraft. This happens once per second.

The FAA required all operators to equip their aircraft with ADS-B technology by 2020 to fly in most controlled airspace. The agency says the move improves safety and efficiency, particularly in high-traffic airports like New York and Miami.

The process is legal as ADS-B Exchange does not use FAA data to show the aircraft, unlike websites like FlightAware and FlightRadar24.

Sweeney rejected Elon Musk’s offer

Musk in January offered Sweeney US$5,000 to take the jet-tracking account down, but Sweeney requested US$50,000 and Musk said he would think about it.

Musk never followed up. Now, the account has nearly 500,000 followers.

Mark Cuban provides business advice instead

Mark Cuban in June even made a deal with Sweeney to give him a lifetime of business advice to stop tracking his travel, which Sweeney agreed to.

Since he made headlines, Sweeney’s myriad other jet-tracking accounts have gained popularity, including @TrumpJets at about 10,000 followers and @ZuccJet has about 16,000 followers.

A job offer out of the viral saga

While Sweeney says he does not make any money off the accounts, the 20-year-old said he got a job offer from Stratos Jet Charters out of his work. He is currently a second-year at the University of Central Florida studying computer science.

With the gaining popularity, Musk has expressed concern that the ElonJet account could pose a security issue.

PR issues for celebs

The accounts have also created PR issues for celebrities like Taylor Swift and Kylie Jenner , who have been blasted on social media for taking hundreds of flights per year and emitting thousands of tons of CO2. So, it’s not a surprise celebrities are trying to dodge jet trackers – but it isn’t easy.

Various programmes to dodge jet trackers

The Federal Aviation Administration has created a programme called “Limiting Aircraft Data Displayed”, or LADD for short. Because they use FAA data, websites like FlightAware and FlightRadar24 will not show LADD-registered planes.

If, for example, someone searched for Trump’s 757 tail number – N757AF – on FlightAware, the screen would say the plane “is not available for public tracking per request from the owner/operator”.

Trump, along with Travis Scott, Drake, Steven Spielberg and dozens of others, have signed up for the free programme in an effort to dodge the tracking accounts of Sweeney and others.

Sweeney has even created a “LADD List” that houses all of the tail numbers that he estimates have signed up. Drake’s Boeing 767 private jet, dubbed “Air Drake”, is on the LADD list.

While this seems like a reliable way to avoid being tracked on the surface, Sweeney is thwarting their plans by using ASD-B Exchange. The website does not use FAA data, so it can display any flight regardless of if it is on the LADD list or not.

Streufert, who runs the ADS-B Exchange website, says it’s gathered from “all public information”, according to an interview with the AFP. “We have not removed anything so far,” he said. “And I don’t want to be the arbiter of who’s right and who’s wrong.”

So, unfortunately for private jet owners, LADD isn’t going to cut it. But, there is another free FAA programme they can use that is more secure.

PIA is a programme that allows private jet owners to substitute their tail number for a temporary one not assigned to other aircraft so they can fly incognito. Photo: Getty Images

The programme is called the “privacy ICAO aircraft address programme”, or PIA. This allows people to substitute their tail number for a temporary one not assigned to any other aircraft, allowing them to fly incognito.

Celebrities like Musk and Trump have enrolled in PIA. The FAA says more than 300 PIAs have been issued since its launch in December 2019.

Musk actually sought advice from Sweeney on how to avoid being tracked and the mogul suggested PIA, as shown in a Twitter direct message exchange Sweeney shared with Insider.

However, despite having PIA, the planes can still be followed: “These privacy mitigation programmes are effective for real-time operations but do not guarantee absolute privacy,” the FAA told Insider.

For example, Musk flew from Texas to California on May 7, and while ADS-B Exchange did not display the real tail number, it flagged the jet as PIA and it was still uploaded to @ElonJet by Sweeney’s bot.

The FAA also noted that a Freedom of Information Act request, LiveATC, and frequently departed airports can also be used to identify PIA planes. LiveATC allows anyone to tap into the conversations between air traffic control and aircraft.

“Elon Musk, for example, has a Gulfstream and there’s only so many people that fly that particular plane out of Brownsville, Texas and fly to the same airports,” Sweeney told Insider.

Who needs private jets?

With all of the loopholes to the FAA’s privacy programmes, the agency admits it is not a “silver bullet”, prompting some celebrities and big names in business to ditch owning private jets altogether.

LVMH CEO Bernard Arnault , who oversees the Louis Vuitton brand along with other high-end names, sold his Bombardier Global 7500 in September, telling Bloomberg, “no one can see where I go because I rent planes when I use private planes …”.

Meanwhile, earlier this year, Meta switched out Zuckerberg’s private jet, forcing Sweeney to find the plane’s new tail number all over again just months after he first started sharing the Facebook founder’s travel on Twitter.

China's Hang Lung & France's LVMH Announce Groundbreaking Sustainability Partnership To Accelerate Joint ESG ... - Green Queen Media,"Mon, 07 Nov 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdyZWVucXVlZW4uY29tLmhrL2hhbmctbHVuZy1sdm1oLXN1c3RhaW5hYmxlLWJ1aWxkaW5nLXBhcnRuZXJzaGlwL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"6 Mins Read

A groundbreaking partnership between Chinese real estate leader Hang Lung Properties and French luxury giant LVMH Group is forging new ground when it comes to sustainable building.

Hang Lung and LVMH have officially partnered on a three-year innovative collaboration on climate and sustainability action across their respective real estate and retail businesses that will see the two Groups work together with a clear focus on five key areas, and will engage their respective employees and suppliers to co-create solutions to the ESG issues they face. The partnership is expected to inspire many more landlords and tenants to work creatively for the greater good.

The joint partnership, the first of its kind globally, spans Hang Lung’s properties across seven mainland Chinese cities, covers 26 LVMH brands in more than 90 retail spaces, and hopes to redefine the relationship between property owners and leading retail brands when it comes to sustainability. Focus areas include Climate Resilience, Resource Management, Wellbeing, Sustainable Transactions, and Sustainability Communication, events and Progress Reviews. The partnership will run until the end of 2025, and is expected to be renewed thereafter.

This unique and innovative partnership, which sets an example for both the real estate and retail industry globally, is rooted in the premise that a more systemic approach is required to better meet the needs of the current climate crisis. Both Hang Lung and LVMH are committed to a deeply collaborative approach with regular progress monitoring and open sharing, and thoughtful engagement amongst key stakeholders such as employees and suppliers. And at the upcoming Real Estate & Climate Forum, co-organized by the two Groups, a digital platform enabling a tailor-made experience for every user that will allow for curated ideation and consensus-based decision-making.

“A positive sum game in a zero sum world”

At the launch ceremony held in Paris and broadcast across various cities including Hong Kong and Shanghai, Adriel Chan, Hang Lung Properties’ Vice Chair and Chair of Sustainability Steering Committee, told the audience that “sustainability is a positive sum game in what often feels like a zero sum world.”

Chan underlined the importance of collaboration when it comes to reaching ambitious goals around sustainability. Of Hang Lung and LVMH’s new plans, he said the two giants are “excited to launch this groundbreaking partnership, leveraging our strategic relationship to help ensure a sustainable future for the world while providing unique experiences to our customers. Although Hang Lung already has ambitious ESG goals and targets, the partnership with LVMH takes our sustainability agenda to the next level, demonstrating how landlords and tenants can work creatively together for the greater good.”

Antoine Arnault, LVMH Image and Environment, spoke of how their customers were increasingly looking for sustainable shopping spaces. “The design of our stores, like that of our products, is inspired by LVMH’s core values of creativity, innovation and excellence. And this of course means guaranteeing the environmental performance of our over 5,550 stores around the world.”

Chan also anchored the commitment made to China’s overall carbon targets, adding: “We are confident that the partnership will make a positive impact in support of China’s goals to peak its carbon emissions by 2030 and to reach carbon neutrality by 2060.”

Chan is Vice Chair of Hang Lung Properties, the real estate giant that manages over 58 million sq. ft. gross floor area in China with flagship properties in nine cities including Shanghai, Shenyang, Jinan, Wuxi, Tianjin, Dalian, Kunming, Wuhan and Hangzhou.

After joining Hang Lung back in 2010, Chan has worked his way up from leasing and finance to today holding the responsibility for the Company’s strategic direction. His great passion, however, is the environment. In fact, Chan manages the Company’s Sustainability Steering Committee and works closely with General Manager – Sustainability, John Haffner, who joined Hang Lung in 2019 and is responsible for formulating the group-wide sustainability strategy and driving its execution.

Chan has spoken publicly at length about the Company’s commitment to tackling climate change, stating that Hang Lung is among the first real estate companies in Asia to have committed to setting both near- and long-term targets to reach net-zero value chain greenhouse gas emissions by no later than 2050 in alignment with Science Based Targets initiative’s (“SBTi”) Net-Zero Standard, the world’s first framework for corporate net-zero target setting in line with climate science.

He has also shared the challenges of engaging employees on sustainability and some key learnings from his journey including the importance of making the corporate sustainability aspiration digestible and relatable to his employees with top-level commitment to an actionable sustainability framework to engaging and providing them with a clear agenda for the short-, near- and long-term, along with continuous internal education and events and crucially, buy-in at all levels of the organization, highlighting that in the Asian context, top-level commitment is key.

Hang Lung boasts a range of company-wide sustainability achievements, from an AA rating by the Hang Seng Corporate Sustainability Index Series, to a “A” MSCI ESG rating, to maintaining a 4-star GRESB performance rating. The Company has also been listed as an Index Component of the Dow Jones Sustainability Indices in the Asia Pacific Index since 2017. In addition, over 77% of its overall construction floor area is certified with green buildings, including 32 Leadership in Energy and Environment Design (LEED) gold or above certifications or pre-certifications. The company has been repeatedly awarded for its sustainability reporting efforts too, including winning the Grand Award in Best ESG Report at 2022’s Hong Kong ESG Reporting Awards (HERA) and the Excellence Award in the Environmental, Social, and Governance Reporting at the 2022 Hong Kong Management Association (HKMA)’s Best Annual Reports Awards.

Spring City 66, Kunming

Furthermore, Hang Lung’s Spring City 66 in Kunming also marks the Company’s first development and China’s Yunnan Province’s first commercial complex, featuring a world-class shopping mall, Grade A office space and a hotel and residential tower that is powered by 100% renewable energy, which achieve net zero carbon emissions for both landlord and tenant annual electricity consumption.

To build on the success of the Company’s sustainability progress, Chan further stated at the launch ceremony in Paris “Hang Lung and LVMH have made explicit in our agreement that we encourage one another to work with other tenants and other landlords to further the sustainability agenda, and so we welcome the proliferation of these types of agreements going forward.”

Plans for dedicated events are in the works including the first Real Estate & Climate Forum, which will take place on November 24 and 25, 2022, and unite changemakers across both industries to help formulate solution-based plans around twelve areas from energy efficiency and circularity to social impact.

LVMH-Backed L Catterton Sets Up First Chinese Yuan Fund - Yicai Global,"Tue, 01 Nov 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnlpY2FpZ2xvYmFsLmNvbS9uZXdzL2x2bWgtYmFja2VkLWwtY2F0dGVydG9uLXNldHMtdXAtZmlyc3QtY2hpbmVzZS15dWFuLWZ1bmTSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"(Yicai Global) Nov. 1 -- L Catterton, a private equity firm under global luxury brand Louis Vuitton Moet Hennessy, has set up a Chinese yuan-denominated fund focused on the consumer industry after completing a CNY1 billion (USD137.6 million) initial financing.

The fund, which aims to raise CNY2 billion, will invest more than half of the money in early venture capital firms, with the rest going to growth companies, China Fund News reported yesterday. Chengdu Hi-Tech Industrial Development Zone will be the first project to be officially invested in by the fund.

Despite indications that the fund has already reached its minimum subscription target, it remains open to new and existing investors willing to increase their subscriptions. It usually takes about 12 months to 18 months for a fund to stop accepting investors.

As the world's second-largest commodity consumer, China has significant market scale advantages, said Marzak Li, head of the fund. With the upgrading of the consumer structure, L Catterton is bullish on the development of China's consumer industry in the long term, he added, noting that the establishment of the first yuan fund in China also suggests that the company will be able to cultivate more brands to seize the international market in the future.

L Catterton manages six funds on five continents, with a total asset under management of USD33 billion, according to the firm's website. It invested in Chinese companies including low-calorie, sugar-free flavored beverages maker Genki Forest, milk tea brand Hey Tea, natural pet food brand Pure Natural, and beauty company Marubi Holdings Group.

Louis Vuitton Is Turning Their Paris Head Office Into A Hotel - Grazia USA,"Sun, 20 Nov 2022 22:04:02 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vZ3JhemlhbWFnYXppbmUuY29tL2FydGljbGVzL2xvdWlzLXZ1aXR0b24taXMtdHVybmluZy10aGVpci1wYXJpcy1oZWFkLW9mZmljZS1pbnRvLWEtaG90ZWwv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Next time you’re in Paris, forget booking the Raffles, Le Meurice or Hotel Costes because very soon you will be able to stay at the very head quarters of Louis Vuitton.

Well, perhaps not next time but very soon!

According to Louis Vuitton CEO, Michael Burke, the future of the Louis Vuitton head offices located in the 2nd arrondissement right near the Pont Neuf bridge, the building will begin an enormous transformation that will turn structure into a multi-functional immersive space. These plans include building the world’s largest Louis Vuitton store as well as the aforementioned hotel and accomodations.

It is the next phase for the brand which has slowly begun to extend its influence into physical and experiential spaces. In December, the French Maison will be launching LV Dream, a pop-up experiential space that included exhibitions involving various collaborations with artists, a cafe and gift shop and a chocolate shop.

Currently in Sydney, a similar pop-up See LV has opened in Circular Quay – a combination of museum and gallery experience tracking the brand’s heritage designs and contemporary collections.

In an interview given to WWD, Burke states that these plans could take up to 15 years to fully materialise but the hotel itself should be up and running by 2027. For more than a year, Louis Vuitton’s parent group LVMH has been slowly redeveloping the neighbourhood which has seen the opening of a Cheval Blanc hotel, and the debut Paris location of Italian pastry stores, Cova.

“Parisians are finally rediscovering [the area],” Burke told WWD. “They’ve embraced it. There’s street music now at 11 p.m. outside here. When we took it over, this was a no man’s land, if not worse. Nobody in their right mind would walk here in the night.”

This is only the beginning, with LVMH chairman and CEO Bernard Arnault planning to completely overhaul the region and create a renaissance of business, cuisine options, entertainment and cultural activities."

In June, Aimé Leon Dore opened a UK flagship on London’s Broadwick Street in Soho, adding to LVMH’s 5,500-plus store count.

On 28 July, LVMH unveiled a new London head office for its UK beauty arm, moving from 180 Oxford Street to Kensington’s Lancer Square. A month later, it announced the launch of a skincare brand developed by fashion designer Stella McCartney. Despite a challenging year, LVMH’s fashion and leather goods business division made €27.8bn (£24.5bn) in revenue for the first nine months of 2022, up 31% year on year. It attributed the increase to the return of international travel and “solid” customer demand.

The business unit includes luxury fashion and leather goods brands Berluti, Celine, Christian Dior, Emilio Pucci, Fendi, Givenchy, Kenzo, Loewe, Loro Piana, Louis Vuitton, Marc Jacobs, Moynat, Patou and Rimowa. LVMH also owns minority stakes in brands Phoebe Philo, JW Anderson and Aimé Leon Dore.

A Challenging Road Awaits China's Lanvin Group On Other Side Of IPO - Jing Daily,"Tue, 15 Nov 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiOmh0dHBzOi8vamluZ2RhaWx5LmNvbS9wb3N0cy9sYW52aW4tZ3JvdXAtdXMtaXBvLWNoYWxsZW5nZXPSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"What happened

Lanvin Group is gearing up for its next phase of global expansion: a New York Stock Exchange listing. On December 9, the Fosun International-owned company is set to vote on a deal to merge with a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) set up by Primavera Capital, which, if approved by shareholders, could pave the way for the group which owns luxury fashion labels Lanvin, Wolford, Sergio Rossi, Caruso, and St. John Knits to go public by the end of the year.

Since the deal was first proposed in March, Lanvin Group has adjusted its pre-money equity valuation from 1.25 billion to 1 billion to take into account fluctuations in the currency and the stock market environment, as well as the performance of currently listed luxury companies. “Our outlook for the business remains unchanged and we believe the adjusted valuation establishes a highly compelling entry point for investors as we continue to capture untapped growth opportunities across the world,” stated CEO Joann Cheng.

The Jing Take

The move follows a strong rebound from the Shanghai-based group, previously known as Fosun Fashion Group. In the first half of 2022, revenue grew 73 percent year-on-year to 202 million (1.4 billion RMB), representing one of the highest growth rates in the global luxury industry, according to the firm. The strong performance was driven by Europe and North America, the home markets of its five portfolio brands. Meanwhile, sales in China managed to grow 32 percent year-over-year despite lockdowns — positive growth, though sluggish when compared to the 194 percent surge from the rest of Asia.

Even with these results, overseas expansion is not without its challenges. For one, Lanvin Group continues to report losses and expects to achieve profitability by 2024 . It doesn’t help that its parent company has its own financial issues, using debt to fuel its initial growth; according to Bloomberg , Fosun International plans to sell as much as 11 billion of non-core assets in the next 12 months to shore up its balance sheet.

Lanvin Group touts that it has unparalleled access to China, where there is major opportunity for growth as the penetration rate is low (the mainland counts for just 10 percent of the group's sales, whereas it makes up roughly 35 percent of Gucci's). Plus, the company has the backing of strategic investors like Japanese trading conglomerate Itochu Corporation, luxury footwear manufacturer Stella International, luxury shopping mall operator K11, and more recently, South Korea-based Meritz Securities Co. Ltd., pooling their financial resources and broader market expertise.

But whether this will be enough to overcome its lack of fashion experience — Fosun International deals with pharmaceuticals, real estate, and tourism — and revive its heritage brands remains to be seen. And even if Lanvin Group successfully lists and becomes the first international luxury fashion group based in China, it will have plenty of mileage to cover before it can compete with the likes of LVMH and Kering on the global stage.

Sephora Appoints New CEO: Guillaume Motte - WWD,"Wed, 23 Nov 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3dkLmNvbS9iZWF1dHktaW5kdXN0cnktbmV3cy9iZWF1dHktZmVhdHVyZXMvc2VwaG9yYS1uYW1lcy1jZW8tZ3VpbGxhdW1lLW1vdHRlLTEyMzU0MjgzNDkv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS — Sephora has named Guillaume Motte as its new president and chief executive officer, effective Jan. 1.

Motte — a seasoned retail executive who recently worked at Sephora — will succeed and report to Chris de Lapuente, according to an internal memo obtained by WWD.

De Lapuente had stepped back into Sephora’s CEO role following the abrupt departure this June of Martin Brok, who joined the beauty retailer in September 2020.

Concurrently, de Lapuente continues to serve as chairman and CEO of the Selective Retailing division at Sephora’s parent company, LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton.

Motte’s appointment comes at a critical moment for Sephora, the only prestige beauty retailer with a global presence, as it expands geographically and competes head-on with rising, increasingly omnichannel players.

He takes the reins as Sephora is winning in markets such as the European Union, vying with arch-rival Ulta in the uber-competitive U.S. and re-entering the U.K., first by rebranding feelunique.com into sephora.co.uk. Meanwhile, Sephora’s online business is being built in China, with the store model being tweaked there.

In terms of sales, Sephora has returned to its 2019 activity level, and industry sources estimate that its revenues this year will surpass the 10-billion-euro mark.

Motte most recently has been deputy CEO of LVMH Fashion Group, a position he assumed in May 2021 in what was then a newly created role in which he reports to Sidney Toledano, chairman and CEO of the fashion branch. It has a stable of brands including Celine, Givenchy, Marc Jacobs, Kenzo, Loewe, Emilio Pucci, Patou and Rossimoda.

Prior to that, Motte served as president of Sephora Europe and Middle East, beginning March 2018. In that position, the executive has been credited with accelerating the retailer’s omnichannel reach and strong brand-building, with the likes of its inclusive campaign, dubbed The Unlimited Power of Beauty.

Motte steered Sephora back into Germany after a 16-year hiatus, and inaugurated a new flagship there that was at the time touted as a next-generation store.

Before joining Sephora, he was CEO of French menswear chain Celio for three years. He also ran French women’s ready-to-wear brand Jennyfer for more than six years, and held positions at other companies, including Al Tayer Trends, FNAC and McKinsey & Co.

He is a graduate of École Centrale Paris with a degree in engineering, and holds a master’s degree in economics from Cambridge University and an MBA from French business school Insead.

In the internal announcement, de Lapuente welcomed Motte back to Sephora.

“His experiences over the past two years in LVMH Fashion Group, alongside Sidney Toledano, have broadened his prestige brand-building expertise and deepened his already extensive retail and business skills at a global level,” de Lapuente said. “Guillaume is an inspiring and much-admired leader who has always personified Sephora’s unique passion and culture.

“Guillaume has the wonderful balance of being strong on retail execution and yet strategic and forward-thinking in his outlook,” de Lapuente continued. “He has deep understanding of all the elements that make Sephora the world’s best loved beauty community. I have no doubt he will continue to build Sephora into the extraordinary premium beauty retailer we envision. I am extremely happy that we will be working together again.”"
Cheval Blanc development agreement OK'd by council - Park Labrea News/Beverly Press,"Wed, 02 Nov 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vYmV2ZXJseXByZXNzLmNvbS8yMDIyLzExL2NoZXZhbC1ibGFuYy1kZXZlbG9wbWVudC1hZ3JlZW1lbnQtb2tkLWJ5LWNvdW5jaWwv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The Beverly Hills City Council on Nov. 1 approved the development agreement for the mixed-use Cheval Blanc project, clearing the last hurdle for a luxury development that will transform the northern end of Rodeo Drive and generate as much as $1 billion in tax revenue over a 30-year period.

The development, on the 400 blocks of North Rodeo and North Beverly drives, will include a hotel with 109 rooms, roughly 25,000 square feet of retail space spread over two floors, a private club for up to 500 members, restaurants, a wellness center and pool deck. It would be staffed by approximately 250 employees.

“This is a once-in-a-generation project,” Councilman Lester Friedman said.

After more than three hours of presentations and debate about the project during the Nov. 1 meeting, the council voted 4-1 to approve the development agreement, with Councilman John Mirisch voting no.

While council members including Mayor Lili Bosse and Vice Mayor Julian Gold said the project would reaffirm Rodeo Drive’s status as one of the world’s premier lifestyle destinations while enriching the city’s coffers, Mirisch argued that by approving a project that provides so few public benefits while catering to the “super rich,” the City Council had failed its constituents. “We were hornswoggled, we were shortchanged, we were bilked, we were shaken down,” Mirisch said.

Mirisch also cast the sole dissenting vote on Sept. 20, when the City Council approved the project subject to a development agreement.

The development agreement requires LVMH, the developer of the project, to pay the city a $26 million “public benefit contribution” and an additional arts and cultural contribution of $2 million. In addition to the city’s 14% transient tax, the agreement also establishes a 5% surcharge on room revenue, and it imposes a 3% environmental mitigation and safety fee on any future sale of the property.

Under the agreement, LVMH must begin construction within one year and complete it within five, although it allows LVMH to extend the construction and completion dates by up to three years, at a cost of $250,000 per month to the city.

If LVMH fails to open and operate the hotel within five years, the company must pay the city $52 million. This sum includes the forfeiture of the public benefit and arts and culture contributions, and an additional $24 million in liquidated damages.

Anish Melwani, chairman and CEO of LVMH North America, pointed to the forfeiture fee as an example of LVMH’s commitment to establishing a lasting presence in the city’s most famous shopping district.

“We’re not just saying it, this agreement literally puts our money where our mouth is,” Melwani said.

In addition to keeping construction to a five year schedule, the agreement also requires the hotel to operate at a quality consistent with other Cheval Blanc properties.

While Mirisch approved of the city imposing a fee on LVMH for failing to meet its construction deadlines or selling the project to another entity, he said that $52 million is “chump change” to a company as lucrative as LVMH.

In 2021, LVMH recorded more than $63 billion in profit, a 44% increase from the year before, according to a January press release. LVMH CEO Bernard Arnault is estimated to be the world’s second richest person, according to Forbes.

Mirisch also criticized the agreement for not earmarking any tax revenue to build affordable housing in the city, noting that guests who can afford to pay the average nightly fee of $2,000 per room – the penthouse suite costs $20,000 – can afford to pay a little extra to subsidize low income housing. But designating some of the revenue as affordable housing funding was a non-starter for the developers, he said.

Charlie Carnow, a research analyst for UNITE HERE Local 11, a union representing service workers, also criticized the agreement for not allocating revenue for affordable housing or detailing what public benefits would be funded by the contributions stipulated in the agreement. “The housing crisis is … the biggest issue for the country at the moment,” Carnow said. “If you listen to nothing else, I ask that the development agreement specifically set aside some money so that people who work here can have some hope of being able to benefit from this community’s excellent schools and excellent public services and not spend hours getting home on transit or in traffic.”

No Beverly Hills residents spoke against the project, though Mirisch said that does not mean that all residents support it, adding that many residents did not have sufficient time to review the development agreement.

While Gold acknowledged that in a negotiation, “you can always ask for more,” he said that the tax benefits from the project are “staggering,” and applauded the city’s negotiators for their work.

Before calling for a vote on the agreement, Gold reflected on the decisions made by previous council members, whose foresight turned Rodeo Drive and the city into the thriving destinations they are today.

“I have a sense that we’re sitting in a moment of time that’s similar,” Gold said. “This city has been very blessed in that we’ve had so many years of prosperity, but I think that we have to maintain that, and we have to continue to do stuff that continues to preserve our place as a desirable, luxurious place to be. We have to be aspirational.”

Bosse called the vote “emotional,” saying that as the daughter of immigrants who moved to Beverly Hills to chase the “American Dream,” she believes the development will ensure that the city continues to provide the same opportunities and quality of life it afforded her.

“I believe that having this project is going to enable our community, and our children and our grandchildren, to thrive,” she said."
Why buy Christian Dior International shares? - Luxus Plus,"Fri, 25 Nov 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vbHV4dXMtcGx1cy5jb20vZW4vd2h5LWJ1eS1jaHJpc3RpYW4tZGlvci1pbnRlcm5hdGlvbmFsLXNoYXJlcy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Luxury goods remain a safe bet in a stock portfolio. And the Christian Dior International holding company has undeniable advantages.

Christian Dior International is the family holding company of LVMH. Its main shareholders are the Arnault family with 97.5% held via Financière Agache. Bernard Arnault owns 0.3% and the Norwegian sovereign wealth fund 0.175%. The market capitalisation of the share is around 124 billion euros. LVMH, on the other hand, has a market capitalisation of 350 billion euros, i.e. 11.63% of the CAC 40. It is the first capitalisation of the CAC 40 ahead of Total Energies at 9.45% and the 2nd capitalisation of the EuroStoxx50.

Over the past 10 years, Christian Dior International has posted an annual stock market performance of 21.75% compared to 6.62% for the Euro Stoxx 50 and 20.32% for LVMH.

The recent decline in the Christian Dior International share price has provided an attractive entry point for investors.

In the first nine months of the year, the group achieved sales of EUR 56.5 billion, up 28% on the same period in 2021. The 2022/2021 growth rates over the 9 months are impressive: +31% for Fashion and Leather Goods, +23% for Wines and Spirits and Watches and Jewellery, +19% for Perfumes and Cosmetics…

The decline in the equity markets provides major opportunities to access the best of the market at reasonable prices. Christian Dior International clearly belongs to the class of “super growth” stocks that deliver exceptional performance.

8 South Asians among Insider's 100 People Transforming Business - The American Bazaar,"Mon, 21 Nov 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFtZXJpY2FuYmF6YWFyb25saW5lLmNvbS8yMDIyLzExLzIxLzgtc291dGgtYXNpYW5zLWFtb25nLWluc2lkZXJzLTEwMC1wZW9wbGUtdHJhbnNmb3JtaW5nLWJ1c2luZXNzLTQ1MTY3Nzgv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The change makers come from areas ranging from Diversity Equity Inclusion, to Sustainability to Emerging Tech

Eight South Asian business leaders figure in Business Insider’s 2022 list of 100 leaders across 10 industries who are driving unprecedented change and innovation.

“The T100 does more than highlight career milestones; it features the power players behind the most significant trends of the year,” it said noting, “During the past 12 months, business leaders faced myriad challenges including inflation, a polarized political climate, and war in Ukraine.”

Featured in the Diversity Equity Inclusion category is Anish Melwani, CEO and Chairman, LVMH North America.

“What Melwani, does has ripple effects in the fashion world,” Insider wrote. “Over the past year, the chief doubled down on supporting designers and creatives of color across multiple portfolio brands.” The move is likely to encourage competitors to follow suit, multiple fashion analysts and bloggers told Insider.

“I think critics who are talking about diversity and inclusion as window dressing are usually responding to too much talk and not enough action. And I think our strategy to avoid that is to do the opposite,” Melwani said.

In September, LVMH served as the first title sponsor for Harlem’s Fashion Row, a New York City organization supporting designers of color. The partnership consisted in LVMH and brands like Louis Vuitton, Tiffany & Co, and Moet Hennessy offering their expertise through a mentorship program, as well as grants to emerging fashion creatives of color.

The luxury group has several other internship and mentorship activities, including with the Fashion Scholarship Fund via the Virgil Abloh “Post-Modern” Scholarship Fund, and recently committed to investing in historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs) as a way to further advance DEI efforts.

In addition, Melwani has worked to diversify the top echelons at its brands. People of color now comprise more than 30% of leadership positions in North America, excluding the C-suite, according to a company spokesperson. He wants to continue diversifying C-suite leadership, in line with corporate goals set for 2026.

“One of the challenges in our sector is if we limit our recruiting to people who have vast experience, the sector doesn’t get more diverse because the people are who they are today, right? You have to widen the aperture of where you seek great talent and are willing to take some risks on people,” he said.

Sustainability section features Vaishali Nigam Sinha, Chair, ReNew Foundation and Chief Sustainability, CSR and Communications Officer, ReNew Power.

Sinha started her career in investment banking. But after 16 years in the industry, she found her calling in something far different — philanthropy. She founded the online-donation platform iCharity in India and, from there, feels as though she “accidentally landed” in the green-energy and sustainability industry.

“It really prepared me as far as philanthropy is concerned,” Sinha told Insider about her experience in banking. “We all come to a stage in our lives where that part of us takes center stage. Even when I was in New York, I really felt like contributing to a lot of issues which India and people here were facing.”

Sinha’s focus on making the world a better place brought her to her position as the chief sustainability, corporate-social-responsibility, and communications officer of the renewable-energy company ReNew Power. She’s also the founding chair of the ReNew Foundation.

Over the past decade, ReNew Power has set up wind farms, solar farms, hydro projects, and around-the-clock generators, to the point that the sustainable-energy company now supplies 1.8% of India’s energy, Sinha said.

“We raised global funds. It’s really, I would say, a perfect example of really putting global North to global South kind of model in practice,” she said. “And it’s really been quite amazing how we’ve been able to build the infrastructure in remote parts of our country and around our sites, engage the local people, and provide employment.”

Sinha is an advocate for female participation and leadership in the fight against climate change, and she hopes to see ReNew Power’s work spread across the world.

“I think the boundaries for climate change, for the global energy transition, are melting,” she said. “As we look around us, there are humongous opportunities for us to be able to produce energy and make it fungible from one geography to the other. And we see ourselves taking the lead there.”

Also featured in Sustainability is Ali Zaidi, National Climate Advisor, White House. Zaidi who has served on President Joe Biden’s climate team since it was founded in 2020 was promoted to his current role in September.

The highest-ranking Pakistani American in the administration has helped shape Biden’s strategy that connects the climate crisis to social and racial justice, public health, infrastructure, and jobs.

“We can build the politics for climate action if we use that climate action to tackle multiple crises at a time,” Zaidi told Ozy in an interview last year. “If we use it to eat into injustice, to spur economic activity, to build worker power, the popularity of that climate action goes up.”

Now he’s tasked with shepherding the rollout of the $369 billion in climate funding in the Inflation Reduction Act alongside John Podesta, who was named in September senior advisor to the president on clean energy.

Zaidi’s path to the White House began in Karachi, Pakistan, which his family left for small-town Pennsylvania when he was 5. Zaidi earned a law degree from Georgetown University and did stints in academia, at a law firm, and as the chair of climate policy and finance for the state of New York.

Emerging Tech section features Akshay Kothari, Chief Operating Officer, Notion, which has become both a popular workplace-productivity tool and a social-media phenomenon over the past two years. The $10 billion startup’s total users quadrupled to more than 20 million over the past 12 months. At the same time, its tools have become a staple for TikTok influencers and everyday users looking to organize their personal lives.

Kothari, a product exec turned jack-of-all-trades, has been instrumental in guiding the company through its rapid growth. “I spent a decade building products, and the job I have at Notion was everything but product. I was responsible for really building out our foundational and our business teams,” Kothari said, explaining his mission to hire experienced leaders for Notion’s sales, marketing, product, human resources, finance, and other essential teams.

In some ways, it was a challenge to start teams in business units he hadn’t worked in before, Kothari said, but it made it simpler. It forced him and his team to think about how best to serve customers and build practices around that, he said.

The toughest challenge he’s faced at Notion was in early 2021, when it got a huge influx of users, which was spurred by it going viral on TikTok and almost took down the company’s servers. Under Kothari’s leadership, the company took a six-month break from any new product features to focus 100% on improving its infrastructure. “The investments we made during that time also helped build the company culture,” he said.

Notion’s next phase of growth is focused on making it easier for large companies to use it for workplace collaboration. Kothari is focused on making sure Notion’s growing community of users is happy with the product and continues to pull it into their workplaces. New marketing ideas, like its recent pop-up in San Francisco, are part of this strategy, he said.

“Notion has very much sort of become the default asynchronous collaboration platform,” he said. “Our most exciting days are very much ahead of us.”

Featured in the Shopping category is Dilip Kumar, Vice President of Physical Retail and Technology, Amazon. He is in charge of Amazon’s futuristic “Just Walk Out” technology which allows shoppers to pick out what they want and leave the store without standing in line at a checkout counter. Instead, their accounts are automatically debited for the purchase.

While Just Walk Out got its start in a roughly 10,000-square-foot Amazon Go store in early 2020, the technology now functions in stores that vary in size.

“Our technology services are operational in locations ranging from small-store formats to full-size grocery stores to locations that cater to high customer volumes, like airport and stadium stores,” Kumar told Insider.

In February, Amazon opened an entire Whole Foods store in Washington, DC, with Just Walk Out. Amazon has also installed the tech at its AmazonGo convenience stores and sports stadiums.

Kumar also oversees related projects at Amazon. They include Amazon One, which allows customers to scan their palm to enter a Just Walk Out location or pay, and Amazon Dash Carts, a smart shopping cart that keeps track of what consumers put in their carts as they shop and allows them to skip the checkout line.

“These technologies can improve the shopping experience by saving time and removing friction from shopping trips,” he said. Kumar said he doesn’t “have a crystal ball” to see into the future of retail. But he anticipates “the retail industry will continue to adopt machine learning and computer-vision-based technologies that offer customers ease and convenience.”

Shopping section also features Amish Tolia, Co-CEO and Cofounder, Leap, a retail-as-a-service startup that secures leases, designs stores, and manages operations for brands in exchange for a monthly fee and percentage of sales.

As cofounder and co-CEO, Tolia is always looking for ways that brands can use data to ensure that their digital and physical retail channels are working together in complementary ways.

“For the past 10-plus years, there’s been a lot of conversation around the death of retail,” Tolia said. “We’ve seen that as more of the reinvention of retail, or the rebirth of retail.”

“We know that consumers want to be in person,” Tolia added. “The lion’s share of spend is still taking place offline.”

Leap was founded in mid-2018. Today, about 55 brands — including Ring Concierge, Naadam, and Mack Weldon — are on the platform. Leap operates more than 80 stores across 11 markets in the US. It raised a $50 million Series B in January.

Tolia said that Leap’s tech-powered solutions are especially relevant now as platforms like Shopify have lowered the barrier to entry for online sellers.

As these sellers “continue to scale their businesses online, it’s without question that they’re going to need to address the physical-retail channel to meet the consumer where the consumer is,” Tolia said.

“In today’s world, it’s really important that those brands think about every channel — including that of retail — and address every channel in a way that provides them the greatest amount of flexibility.”

Rajatesh Gudibande, President and Cofounder, GraphWear Technologies Inc, a biotech startup, is one of the two South Asians featured in the new Readers’ Choice section.

Gudibande is pioneering the first no-blood, no-needle glucose-monitoring test that could be revolutionary for the 422 million people with diabetes around the world who must subject themselves to daily finger pricks to monitor their glucose levels.

Unlike the traditional finger-stick monitor — which Gudibande previously said could be painful, lead to infections, and be inaccessible to some — GraphWear’s tech uses sensors to monitor glucose molecules on a patient’s skin.

In addition to diabetes, Gudibande, who holds a master’s degree in nanotechnology from the University of Pennsylvania, said his startup’s tech could eventually be used to monitor other health issues, such as high cholesterol, heart attacks, and cancer risk.

Established in 2015, GraphWear has raised $25.2 million total in VC funding, according to Crunchbase. The startup’s most recent raise was a $20.5 million Series B round in October 2021 that was led by Mayfield Fund.

Chronic-care management is important to Gudibande, who contracted cerebral malaria in rural India but was misdiagnosed with chickenpox and suffered severe complications. He said his experience was difficult even while having better access to healthcare than most others in his situation.

“I had access to doctors and medications, but the true missing piece was the absence of labs — I saw that the logistics of healthcare were clunky, and so I set out to make a change,” Gudibande told Authority Magazine in an interview last year.

“Finding an alternative, noninvasive healthcare solution has allowed us to unlock a whole new outlook on what we can do to better people’s health,” he said.

Nitin Gupta, CEO and Founder, Beans.ai is also featured in the Readers’ Choice section. For him helping people navigate the last 100 yards of their journey is personal.

While visiting from India, Gupta’s mother had a medical emergency at his apartment. “The paramedics hit my property about 15 minutes before they found my apartment,” he told Insider.

His mom received treatment with just a minute to spare. “It was surprising that in a developed country like the US, the first responders don’t have the data” to find where they need to go, he said.

“They actually have this thick paper binder in every fire truck with less than a tenth of the relevant data that they flip through as they’re going to an emergency.”

While the stakes are much lower, delivery professionals face the same challenges at sprawling apartment complexes and labyrinthine office buildings. By crowdsourcing information about the built environment, Beans.ai is helping people get where they need to go.

Gupta has been creative about where he gets his information. The company has paid delivery drivers for maps of apartment complexes and partnered with fire departments to digitize those clunky binders.

In addition to its contracts with government agencies, including postal services, it helps power between 2 million and 3 million daily deliveries on a variety of platforms, including InstaCart.

Fresh off a $17 million Series A financing round, Gupta said his firm is rounding the corner into profitability. The firm is also developing its business with the real-estate and telecommunications industries.

After that, there’s no shortage of spaces with confounding layouts. “Hotels have the same problem, hospitals have the same problem, universities have the same problem,” Gupta said."

Louis Vuitton to transform Paris headquarters into its first-ever luxury hotel - Lifestyle Asia Kuala Lumpur,"Thu, 17 Nov 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxpZmVzdHlsZWFzaWEuY29tL2tsL3N0eWxlL2Zhc2hpb24vbG91aXMtdnVpdHRvbi1sdXh1cnktaG90ZWwv0gFOaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubGlmZXN0eWxlYXNpYS5jb20va2wvc3R5bGUvZmFzaGlvbi9sb3Vpcy12dWl0dG9uLWx1eHVyeS1ob3RlbC9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"French luxury fashion house Louis Vuitton will soon open its first-ever luxury hotel. The location? Its Paris corporate headquarters.

Besides functioning as a hotel, the 3,716-square-metre headquarters will also serve as a retail space and house the brand’s largest store in the world.

How Louis Vuitton is going ahead with its plan

The plan to transform the corporate headquarters at Rue du Pont Neuf into a Louis Vuitton hotel was shared by the brand’s chairman and CEO Michael Burke in an interview with Women’s Wear Daily (WWD).

Louis Vuitton’s corporate headquarters is located near the 13th-century Church of Saint Germain l’Auxerrois in the first arrondissement in Paris.

Burke underlined that the view from the location is “spectacular.” Iconic landmarks, such as the Eiffel Tower and Notre-Dame de Paris, are visible, and he is going to sacrifice his corporate office for the more ambitious plan.

Burke also pointed out that the presence of the fashion house has helped transform the area in 18 months.

The brand’s parent company, LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, spent close to USD 1 billion on acquiring and renovating La Samaritaine in the vicinity. LVMH has described the place as the “largest beauty store in continental Europe.”

French President Emmanuel Macron, Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo and LVMH chairman and CEO Bernard Arnault attended its inauguration on 21 June 2021. It was thrown open to the public with 12 restaurants, Loulou and Rivoli concept stores, and other experiences two days later.

“No other department store has such compelling links to the two faces of Paris, one engaged with the historic economic vitality of the recently renovated Les Halles and the other overlooking the Seine, offering the most beautiful view of the world’s most beautiful city,” Arnault said in a statement at the time.

LVMH has also unveiled the Cheval Blanc hotel and the first Paris branch of Italian pastry stores, Cova, in the same neighbourhood.

Complete transformation could be around a decade away

According to Burke, Arnault has more plans for the brand and its association with Paris.

“It’ll take another 10, 15 years to take it to where we think it should be,” he said.

As part of the transformation, Louis Vuitton will be hosting an experiential space called LV Dream, starting 12 December 2022 for one year. It will offer unique experiences to visitors, including a chocolate shop by Cheval Blanc Paris head pastry chef Maxime Frédéric, a gift store and collaboration works between artists and Louis Vuitton.

Burke revealed that the area the pop-up is set to occupy could eventually become the location of Louis Vuitton’s largest store.

“It’s going to be a work in progress for the next 10 years. The exhibition space has a one-year shelf life, and then next year, we’re going to do something else,” he added.

Louis Vuitton isn’t the first historic brand to undertake such a transformation. Christian Dior and Fendi have in the past converted their office spaces into more inclusive areas, housing anything from stores to restaurants and an atelier to a hotel.

London’s finest stepped in to save French couture

The series does well to translate the exciting energy that emerged on the scene during the 90s, giving fresh force to the European fashion houses. Still family owned and run, a new era was fast approaching, ignited by CEO and founder of the LVMH group, Bernard Arnault, who bought Givenchy and Dior. Arnault would place the best emerging talent from London at the top of his brands, to guarantee success for his expanding business.

Hailing from southeast London, John Galliano, an emerging talent fresh from Central St Martins in 1984 - with a collection inspired by the French revolution - was hired by Arnault as Creative Director of Givenchy. He later replaced Galliano with Alexander McQueen, another outspoken CSM graduate from London’s East End, putting Galliano at Dior. The British sons of a plumber and a taxi driver, respectively, they would go on to shift fashion’s axis forever.

New York vs. London powerhouses

Across the pond, two designers armed with keys to Gucci and Louis Vuitton were also making waves in the fashion world. Parsons School of Design graduates Tom Ford and Marc Jacobs were the American talent representing the best of the New York fashion school. Ford would go on to take the creative reigns at the Italian fashion house Gucci, while Arnault would place Jacobs at the helm of Louis Vuitton."

Multiple luxury brands have raised or are planning to lift product prices amid global economic headwinds. Customers have noticed that some popular handbags from French luxury brand Chanel have recently gone up by 4,000 yuan ($546.56), and jewelry brand Tiffany is also set to raise prices from Friday.The Global Times learnt about the Tiffany price rise on Thursday, with staff saying that the price of diamond ring products will increase from Friday. No reason was given and the scale of the price rise was not disclosed, but media reports said prices of Tiffany products globally will rise by 20 to 59 percent.On Chinese social media platform Xiaohongshu, multiple users noticed the prices of Chanel bags have been lifted since November 2. The official website of Chanel shows the current price of the Large 2.55 handbag is 75,500 yuan, while the price in November 2021 was 71,500 yuan, according to a post from a user named “Yanbao Yanbao.”Zhang Yi, CEO of iiMedia Research Institute, told the Global Times on Thursday that luxury brands are raising prices to offset losses from uncertainties in the global economy and to maintain stable profits.Luxury groups including Kering, Hermès and LVMH showed strong results in their recently released third quarter financial reports.Kering Group, which owns Gucci, Yves Saint Laurent and Bottega Veneta, saw its revenue rise 23 percent year-on-year to 5.14 billion euros ($5.01 billion) in the third quarter of 2022. For LVMH, income from January to September 2022 reached 56.5 billion euros, up 28 percent year-on-year.Hermès recorded revenue of 8.6 billion euros by the end of September 2022, up 30 percent year-on-year, and sales in China picked up strongly despite the closure of outlets due to COVID-19.A representative from Hermès said prices would rise by 5 to 10 percent in 2023 due to rising costs and currency fluctuations, while noting that demand remained strong, Reuters reported.“The buying power of luxury consumers is always reliable, so brands can use this to raise prices and maintain profits,” said Zhang. But analysts also warned the strategy could harm the brands if it is overused."

The program focuses on recruiting applicants from diverse, historically underrepresented communities, LVMH said last week. Part of the group’s Métiers d’Excellence Institute, the course will take place over a two-year period, with participants rotating through Tiffany’s workshops.

“The Métiers d’Excellence initiative will enable us to reinforce the diversity and inclusivity of Tiffany & Co.’s workforce through one of our core pillars of [social impact platform] Tiffany Atrium — education,” said Mary Bellai, global chief of human resources officer at Tiffany. “Our efforts will support the long-term growth and development of students, early-career professionals and educational institutions in the US.”

The program is the result of a partnership with the US Department of Labor and is the government division’s first such cooperation in the luxury industry, LVMH explained.

The conglomerate first launched the Métiers d’Excellence initiative in France in 2014. So far, over 1,400 students have participated across seven countries. While Tiffany will be the first to offer the program in the US, several other jewelry maisons are planning to join next year, LVMH noted.

“By providing an exceptional cohort of apprentices with the opportunity to learn from experienced craftspeople, Métiers d’Excellence ensures that these skills are passed on to early-career professionals and teaches apprentices to uphold LVMH’s longstanding standards of excellence,” added Gena Smith, chief human resources officer for LVMH North America.

India's Tata Group is planning to open at least 20 ""beauty tech"" stores where it will use virtual makeup kiosks and digital skin tests to get young, affluent shoppers to buy premium cosmetic products, according to a company document and a person familiar with its strategy.The move pits Tata, whose interests range from cars to jewellery, against LVMH 's Sephora and domestic rival Nykaa for a share of the fast-growing $16 billion beauty and personal care market in the world's second-most populous country.Tata is eyeing what it calls a ""beauty enthusiast"" in India aged between 18 and 45 years who likes to buy foreign brands such as Estee Lauder 's M.A.C and Bobbi Brown, according to the document, which lists The Honest Company, Ellis Brooklyn and Gallinee as potential partners. Tata is in talks with more than two dozen companies to supply exclusive products to the new stores, according to the person familiar with the strategy, who did not name specific brands.Tata declined to comment on its planned beauty stores and the contents of the document seen by Reuters. Representatives of The Honest Company, Ellis Brooklyn and Gallinee did not respond to Reuters requests for comment.The store opening plans, still under wraps, follow the recent launch of Tata's beauty shopping app, called Tata CLiQ Palette. The company is already in the brick-and-mortar retail business in India, where it has joint-venture partnerships with global brands such as Zara and Starbucks.The stores will have a bright red facade showing Tata CLiQ Palette branding, with 70% of the products inside being skincare and make up, according to the Tata document. Inside the stores, Tata is planning to install technology allowing customers to try on dozens of lipstick shades virtually on screens and to get digital skin tests to find out what products might work best for them, according to the document.The technology is not new and is in use by other beauty retailers around the world, but this venture into what industry experts call ""experiential retail"" is still a relatively new concept in Indian malls and high street shops.""Experiential retail is going to be a big thing in India as more customers will spend their leisure time at such stores,"" said Pankaj Renjhen, joint managing director at India's Anarock Retail consultancy. ""In the premium segment - where a customer is looking for things beyond price - experiential retail helps trigger impulse shopping and can entice them.""Renjhen added, however, that ""the product and the brands have to be exclusive and good - if they are not that, she (the customer) is not going to come back.""As India's economy grows, and people return to shops after coronavirus lockdowns, Tata is looking to target relatively young and affluent customers who like to shop in comfortable surroundings and are willing to pay the sticker price for premium international brands. Tata calls such customers ""non-bargainers"" in the document seen by Reuters, in contrast to most Indians who buy low-priced local brands of lipsticks or skin creams from small mom-and-pop beauty stores where haggling for discounts is common.The company is targeting shoppers with an annual income of at least 600,000 rupees ($7,358), which is more than three times the average earnings of $2,000 per year among India's 1.4 billion inhabitants. The new stores should drive ""sales across channels as a leading Beauty Tech destination for Gen Z & Millennials,"" the Tata document says.India's $16 billion beauty and personal care market is much smaller than China's $92 billion, but market research firm Euromonitor estimates India's will grow an average 7% a year over the next few years.""The Indian beauty market is not saturated - far from it,"" said Devangshu Dutta, head of New Delhi-based retail consultancy firm Third Eyesight. ""If you are investing for the long term, with higher income profiles and changing lifestyles in mind, there's a long runway of growth ahead.""Tata faces strong competition to take advantage of the projected growth. Sephora, which has been in India for around a decade, has 26 outlets selling beauty and fragrance brands. Reliance, led by billionaire Mukesh Ambani, has a long-term plan to open 400 beauty stores, the first of which may open inside a Mumbai mall next month, according to a person familiar with its plans. Reliance did not respond to a request for comment.Indian beauty retailer Nykaa, backed by private equity firm TPG , asset manager Fidelity and endorsed by a Bollywood celebrity, has said it plans to open as many as 300 stores, from 124 now. The 10-year old company, which started as an online-only retailer, attracted attention to the sector last year when its stock nearly doubled after listing on the Mumbai stock exchange, valuing the company at the time at $14 billion.Tata's first ""beauty tech"" store will likely open by March, with further expansion stretching into next fiscal year beginning April that could see it open as many as 40 stores, according to the person familiar with the plan, who added the company will start with bigger cities such as New Delhi before considering smaller places.However, Tata is struggling to persuade owners of upscale malls, where space is scarce, to take on a new beauty store where one already exists, if it does not have enough exclusive products or another differentiating factor to attract new customers and increase foot traffic to the mall as a whole, according to another person with direct knowledge of the discussions.Alongside exclusive product launches, Tata is focusing on the in-store technology, which the document seen by Reuters describes as a ""key differentiator.""One of the tech tools will be a device Tata calls a ""skin analyzer,"" a device with a mirror that can read and analyse a customer's skin to reveal 25 to 30 attributes that can help make product choices. There will also be ""virtual try-on"" kiosks for eye and face makeup. Among them will be a circular stand with lipsticks slotted in; as someone lifts one, a digital mirror-screen in front will automatically start showing how the colour shade will appear on the face, eliminating the need for repeated manual try-ons before a purchase.Tata is also testing use of so-called geofencing technology to allow its store staff to detect when a customer using its app enters, and share the shopping history and wish-lists with staff to make better recommendations, the person familiar with the plans said."
Stella McCartney raises £100m with new share issue - This is Money,"Sun, 06 Nov 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoaXNpc21vbmV5LmNvLnVrL21vbmV5L21hcmtldHMvYXJ0aWNsZS0xMTM5MzM4OS9TdGVsbGEtTWNDYXJ0bmV5LXJhaXNlcy0xMDBtLXBhdGNoLWZhc2hpb24tZmlybS5odG1s0gF1aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhpc2lzbW9uZXkuY28udWsvbW9uZXkvbWFya2V0cy9hcnRpY2xlLTExMzkzMzg5L2FtcC9TdGVsbGEtTWNDYXJ0bmV5LXJhaXNlcy0xMDBtLXBhdGNoLWZhc2hpb24tZmlybS5odG1s?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Stella McCartney has raised nearly £100million by issuing new shares in her business following three years of losses.

The label, run by the daughter of Beatles legend Paul McCartney, said last year its ability to continue as a going concern depended on additional funds being provided by shareholder Anin Star Holdings – part-owned by French fashion giant LVMH.

New documents seen by The Mail on Sunday reveal it has now issued shares worth £98million.

Fund raising: Stella McCartney, right, and her fashion label's collection for spring

It follows dire losses for the years 2018 to 2020, amounting to more than £70 million.

Stella McCartney Ltd is controlled by Anin Star. McCartney herself holds 51 per cent of Anin Star and LVMH, which bought its stake in 2019, has 49 per cent.

Since it was set up in 2001, Stella McCartney Ltd has attracted many high-profile fans such as Alicia Keys, Melania Trump, Beyoncé and Amal Clooney.

McCartney herself received £2.6million in 2020 for running the business.

The new share issue could raise questions over whether she can retain financial control of her indebted firm in the long term, though it is understood she maintains control at this point.

Stella McCartney Ltd and LVMH declined to comment."
