LVMH buys California wine giant Joseph Phelps as high-end drinks market soars - CNBC,"Wed, 29 Jun 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tLzIwMjIvMDYvMjkvbHZtaC1idXlzLWNhbGlmb3JuaWEtd2luZS1naWFudC1qb3NlcGgtcGhlbHBzLWFzLWhpZ2gtZW5kLWRyaW5rcy1tYXJrZXQtc29hcnMuaHRtbNIBdmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tL2FtcC8yMDIyLzA2LzI5L2x2bWgtYnV5cy1jYWxpZm9ybmlhLXdpbmUtZ2lhbnQtam9zZXBoLXBoZWxwcy1hcy1oaWdoLWVuZC1kcmlua3MtbWFya2V0LXNvYXJzLmh0bWw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LVMH's Moet Hennessy division on Wednesday announced it has acquired California wine-maker Joseph Phelps Vineyards, as the French luxury goods giant continues to broaden its drinks portfolio.

The deal delivers Moet one of the best-known California wine makers, famous for its red table wines and premium Insignia label, and deepens its foothold in the U.S., its largest market. Terms of the deal were not disclosed.

Moet Hennessy Chairman and CEO Philippe Schaus told CNBC the company had been looking around the world for larger winemakers that had the same dedication to quality, craftsmanship and entrepreneurship as LVMH. Phelps, founded in 1973 by the pioneering winemaker Joseph Phelps, produces around 750,000 bottles a year and had the right mix of scale, brand, product offerings and quality to add to the Moet Hennessy portfolio, Schaus said.

""It's an iconic name and an iconic winery,"" he said. ""It's important for us that we are acquiring a family business with a legacy and heritage. It's super important that we keep that heritage.""

Phelps has become a staple of private wine cellars and steakhouses. Insignia, a Bordeaux-style blend, typically retails for at least $250 a bottle, depending on the vintage.

The deal comes as Moet Hennessy — whose dozens of brands include Dom Perignon, Moet & Chandon, Hennessy, Cloudy Bay and Belvedere — continues to ride the surge in high-end champagnes, wine and spirits despite fears of recession and inflation.

Schaus said Moet Hennessy aims to serve ""all the different moments of consumption"" — from aperitifs, champagne and fine dining wines to bars, clubs and cocktails. The company's Cloudy Bay brand covers white wines, and its Whispering Angel line offers rose, but Schaus said, ""we were missing a strong red wine.""

Moet Hennessy reported revenue of 1.64 billion euros for the first quarter, up 8% over 2021. Schaus said demand in Europe is ""on fire"" thanks in part to the return of European tourism.

""We're seeing huge demand in Europe,"" he said, ""especially in the resort towns and nightlife.""

In the U.S., Schaus said the company has seen a slight drop-off in demand in lower-priced segments. But high-end consumers — looking for premium-priced products — continue to buy for now. ""The summer will be strong, people are traveling and consuming,"" he said. ""After the summer, we could see a different situation. It's hard to predict inflation and prices.""

While Moet Hennessy was constrained by supply chain problems in the first quarter, Schaus said the company was able to ""catch up"" to many of those issues.

""We think this quarter will be very strong,"" he said.

The high-end champagne shortage, however, is unlikely to end anytime soon, Schaus said.

Dom Perignon, Krug and other pricey brands are increasingly hard to find at some retailers and restaurants since supply remains limited. Dom Perignon, for instance, ages for 10 years before it's sold to the public, making it difficult to flex supply to meet exploding demand, Schaus said.

""Every bottle I will sell over the next 10 years is already in the cellar,"" he said. ""And Dom Perignon uses only the highest level of grapes, so we simply have more demand than nature can provide.""

Schaus also highlighted Armand de Brignac, the champagne brand co-owned by Jay-Z whose gold bottles have become fixtures at flashy parties and clubs. The brand. he said, is quickly catching on in night clubs in Japan and the French Riviera and has ""clearly exceeded our expectations.""

""With Armand de Brignac as well, there is just a limited supply,"" he said."
Delphine Arnault on what it takes to win the LVMH Prize - Vogue Business,"Fri, 03 Jun 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZvZ3VlYnVzaW5lc3MuY29tL2Zhc2hpb24vZGVscGhpbmUtYXJuYXVsdC1vbi13aGF0LWl0LXRha2VzLXRvLXdpbi10aGUtbHZtaC1wcml6ZdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Kenzo artistic director Nigo, an LVMH Prize judge for the first time this year, echoed the sentiment. “I have been feeling that fashion is pretty stale, and seeing these people and hearing their stories today and understanding their energy has given me a boost and made me feel excited about the future,” the Japanese designer said through his translator. Also on this year’s jury: Arnault, Jean-Paul Claverie, Jonathan Anderson, Maria Grazia Chiuri, Nicolas Ghesquière, Kim Jones, Stella McCartney, Silvia Venturini Fendi and Sidney Toledano.

LVMH also gets a front-row seat to the best emerging talent in fashion, some of whom go on to be hired by LVMH brands. Virgil Abloh was appointed artistic director of menswear for Louis Vuitton three years after being named a finalist. The 2016 prize winner, Grace Wales Bonner, collaborated with Dior’s Grazia Chiuri on a special outfit for her Resort 2020 collection. “I think this [kind of collaboration] also helps them understand the organisation and shape of the company,” Grazia Chiuri said. And Eli Russell Linnetz of ERL, one of this year’s Karl Lagerfeld prize recipients, has already collaborated with Dior menswear artistic director Kim Jones on the recent collection presented in Los Angeles. “He’s ready to take off,” said Sidney Toledano, chairman and CEO of LVMH Fashion Group.

Some are hired by competitors too. Demna Gvasalia was tapped by Kering house Balenciaga a few months after being a finalist of the LVMH Prize, and hot British talent Maximilian Davis was appointed by Ferragamo right after Davis was shortlisted as one of the 20 semi-finalists for this year’s LVMH Prize. “Our responsibility is to highlight the work of the young designers,” said Arnault.

What it takes to win

LVMH Prize finalists are chosen based on their potential to develop their creativity but also to sustain a fashion business. Their businesses are often in nascent stages, though most have proven some history of sales through stockists. Stokey-Daley, a working-class boy from Liverpool, impressed the jury with his work that reinterprets British elitism through a social lens. “For me, it's about turning the idea of British heritage on its head, bringing new life to it,” he said. Everything he produces is made in the UK, and he uses almost only natural fibres and deadstocks when possible. “The great life lesson for me personally has been learning how to present the brand. And it has been transformative to my understanding of the industry.”"
LVMH Invests in Lab-Grown Diamond Start-Up Lusix - The Business of Fashion,"Mon, 13 Jun 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzb2ZmYXNoaW9uLmNvbS9uZXdzL2x1eHVyeS9sdm1oLWludmVzdHMtaW4tbGFiLWdyb3duLWRpYW1vbmQtc3RhcnQtdXAtbHVzaXgv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LVMH Luxury Ventures, the French luxury conglomerate’s private equity arm, has acquired a stake in Israeli lab-grown diamond start-up Lusix alongside other investors in a $90 million funding round.

The bet by luxury’s biggest company, whose “Ventures” subsidiary recently invested in Aimé Leon Dore and Heat, comes as the diamond industry seeks to respond to concerns about the ethics and sustainability of mining virgin materials. While the use of recycled gold has become increasingly common, lab-grown gemstones often carry a stigma for luxury brands. Neither LVMH’s Bulgari or Tiffany brands use the technology.

Lusix has sought to shake off sustainability concerns regarding the energy requirements of lab-grown stones by purporting to use only solar energy to produce its “Sun Grown Diamonds” brand. The company said it would use the investment to open a second solar-powered factory in Israel.

Inside the metaverse strategies of L'Oréal and LVMH - The Drum,"Wed, 22 Jun 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWRydW0uY29tL25ld3MvMjAyMi8wNi8yMi9pbnNpZGUtdGhlLW1ldGF2ZXJzZS1zdHJhdGVnaWVzLWwtb3ItYWwtYW5kLWx2bWjSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"L’Oréal and Louis Vuitton Moet Hennessy (LMVH) have both taken tentative steps into the metaverse. Senior leaders explain how they’re approaching this new space – from deciding which brands in their portfolios are best suited to the emerging environment to how they find the budget to fund their experiments.

There’s no shortage of brands dabbling in the ‘metaverse,’ creating something of a FOMO moment in the industry. Nike launched ‘Nikeland’ last year and now boasts over 7 million visitors to the metaverse store. Gucci claims that over 18 million people have engaged with it on Roblox, setting in motion a wave of luxury brands trying to replicate its success. This week at the Cannes Lions festival the program is littered with sessions on the buzzword du jour, while agencies including Publicis (which currently has over 1,000 staff now working on metaverse projects), McCann and Wunderman have set their stalls early by creating their own experiences.

L’Oréal and LMVH are already some way down the line with their metaverse strategies. But that’s not to say they are any the wiser than those just starting out. Both are keen to stress they are still very much in ‘experiment’ mode, still trying to understand its various iterations and the long-term potential.

Here’s what they’ve discovered.

L’Oréal

L’Oréal is prioritizing three brands for its metaverse trials: YSL, Mugler and NYX Professional Make-up.

Testing the waters on NFTs, it recently launched a branded digital wallet. People can claim up to 10,000 free NTFs from L’Oréal to store in this wallet, and throughout the year they can be used to unlock exclusive digital experiences, real-world events and product drops.

There’s no measure of success on this activity – it’s simply about getting its customers used to engaging with the brand in new web3 environments.

“We want to lay down the foundations and understand what beauty will look like there and rooting the brand DNA there. We’re looking at it through the prism of community,” explains Asmita Dubey, chief digital and marketing officer at L’Oréal.

“We’re thinking about immersive experiences. We know that we will go from 2D to 3D beauty, so what does that look like? And from there we’re looking at virtual influence, avatars, products and collectibles. We’re exploring all of that to understand the new visual codes, the new ways people see beauty [in the metaverse].”

More broadly, she’s looking at forging new partnerships with companies and individuals L’Oréal hadn’t previously considered.

“There’s a diverse new ecosystem of partners that we need to start working with. We’re working with new tech platforms, we’re partnering with Ariani – a rising platform in web3 – and companies in the world of crypto. We need to partner with a very new ecosystem,” she continues.

This is most developed with NYX. It’s a make-up brand targeted at professional make-up artists largely through social media marketing.

But it’s now thinking about how the brand can empower a new generation of creators, and has set itself the task of what Dubey describes as “the first-ever decentralized record label for creators in web3.”

“There are so many 3D artists today who are doing phenomenal work on face and they’re into the digital beauty and make-up artistry. That’s where we’re starting. It means the brand will engage with more 3D artists, animators and even software engineers. We will start working with blockchain experts,” she says.

It’s making headway in that effort. NYX recently collaborated with Sandbox to create 8,000 Pride avatars that were ‘made up’ using the brand.

LVMH

Taking a slightly different approach is LMVH, the luxury giant that houses brands including Givenchy, Louis Vuitton and Christian Dior.

It’s hired Nelly Mensah into the new role of ‘head of metaverse and crypto,’ indicating that it sees this as a serious revenue generator down the line. Mensah is a Deloitte Digital alumna and previously led beauty giant Sephora’s digital and innovation efforts. She now heads up all web3 and metaverse efforts globally for LVMH.

“We’re really thinking about four use cases primarily,” she explained. “One is client storytelling and immersive brand experiences. It’s about transparency, traceability and tracking for authenticity. We’re also looking at digital twins and having an extension of all of our product offerings in the virtual world that allow for personalization and expressing yourself. And finally accepting cryptocurrency for payments.”

Part of her role is distilling knowledge to individual brand owners, one of whom is Massimo Paloni, chief operations and innovation officer at Bulgari. Instead of creating an experience on one of the established platforms – such as Roblox – he drafted in Italian creative tech studio Experiency to help it build a metaverse from scratch.

“The metaverses today don’t have high enough quality to support the positioning of a luxury brand. So what we’re doing is creating our own proprietary metaverse. It’s a concept. We’re creating a learning curve, designing spaces. It’s another kind of creativity,” Paloni explains.

“We’re trying to prepare the culture and process of the company. And when the future opens to metaverses able to interact we’ll be ready.”

To get it ready for that moment, the key job for now is to create 3D digital versions of its entire product catalog. It’s a tricky process to make its diamonds look realistic in this space, and it’s taking the agency anywhere from a week to a month to create a single piece of jewelry.

Building a metaverse from scratch and spending weeks at a time creating digital diamond necklaces doesn’t come cheaply.

“Some brands more advanced in this have created their own P&L [for the metaverse]. But at the moment we’re not there,” says Paloni on where the budget is coming from. “The reality is that with innovation the budget is always opportunistic. There was a consensus around this, so we didn’t.”"
LVMH’s luxury hotel project approved - Los Angeles Business Journal,"Mon, 27 Jun 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vbGFidXNpbmVzc2pvdXJuYWwuY29tL2ZlYXR1cmVkL2x2bWhzLWx1eHVyeS1ob3RlbC1wcm9qZWN0LWFwcHJvdmVkL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The long-awaited Cheval Blanc Beverly Hills hotel by LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton was unanimously approved by the Beverly Hills Planning Commission on June 20. The 115-room luxury hotel is expected to face the Beverly Hills City Council to decide its fate at the end of summer or soon thereafter.

While there have been concerns with a few aspects of the proposal and may be some others in the future, such as the hotel’s height, several people said that no project in the Golden Triangle of Beverly Hills had garnered as much excitement in recent memory.

“We are very pleased by the planning commission’s unanimous approval of Cheval Blanc Beverly Hills following careful consideration and valuable feedback,” LVMH said in a statement. “We now look forward to the next step in the city’s transparent and inclusive public review process, and to working closely with all stakeholders to deliver an exceptional new landmark and economic driver in the heart of the Golden Triangle.”

The French luxury-goods company purchased the site, which was formerly a Brooks Brothers store and three other properties, in 2018 for $245 million. Located on the conspicuous corner of Rodeo Drive and South Santa Monica Boulevard, the 1.24-acre site will include 25,000 square feet of street-level retail space, a wellness center, spa and conference rooms.

Retailer’s Dream

Cheval Blanc Beverly Hills has retailers excited for the big changes to come with it, and for many, something this exciting was long overdue.

The last large development in the Golden Triangle that sparked a lot of attention was the Montage Beverly Hills hotel (now known as Maybourne Beverly Hills), which was built in 2008, according to Houman Mahboubi, executive vice-president at Jones Lang LaSalle.

“That brought attention, but nothing at this level. Nothing,” Mahboubi said. “Having a Cheval Blanc, which is really the number 1 hotel in the world, and to have them open doors here in the greatest city in the world, being what Rodeo Drive is and what the Beverly Hills triangle is – it’s the perfect marriage.”

He said that, if the hotel is approved, retailers will be positively impacted by the project before construction even begins.

“That’s why, for example, Rodeo Drive has no more vacancies, because so many top brands of the world want to secure their position… in having a retail store on Rodeo Drive,” Mahboubi said.A handful of retail stores had concerns about sharing an alleyway with the hotel, however. Some high-end shops use the alley as private entrances for their customers, particularly those who are celebrities, and the retailers believed a proposed redesign of the alley would hinder their customers from using it.

LVMH worked with the planning commission to make changes that would alleviate worries of businesses being affected during and after the construction. The fashion house developed a “detailed transportation management plan and improved, relocated alleyway.”

“There were a number of design changes that were made to the project. Most of the concerns related to the alley and just access to the other retailers on (Rodeo Drive),” said Ryan Gohlich, director of community development at the city of Beverly Hills. “There were some modifications made to improve circulation in the alley there. And then we also have a number of conditions that the planning commission imposed on the project regarding the alley design operations and also signage … to try to alleviate concerns from the surrounding retailers there.”

Another issue is height. Cheval Blanc would stand nine stories tall on the Beverly Drive side, going down to four stories on the Rodeo Drive side. Because the city code limits buildings in the Triangle to three stories, the City Council would have to grant an exemption.

Hotels Are Hot

LVMH’s investment in Beverly Hills doesn’t stop there. In addition to several high-end retail shops the company operates there, the conglomerate in December purchased Luxe Hotel Beverly Hills – an 88-room inn on Rodeo Drive – from the Harkham family for $200 million. Sitting at $2.3 million a room, this is the second highest per-room price ever paid for a hotel in California and the most expensive in Los Angeles, according to Alan Reay, president of the Atlas Hospitality group.

“It is a huge, huge endorsement of how strong people believe in the Beverly Hills market, and specifically Rodeo Drive, for them to be investing that kind of dollars,” Reay said. “It speaks volumes of the interest in that specific market, especially from major international companies. I think that the message that this is sending is that the sky is the limit on hotel investments in the city of Beverly Hills.”

The hotel industry had a record-breaking year in 2021, according to the year-end California hotel sales survey conducted by the Atlas Hospitality Group. Los Angeles County led the state, selling 77 hotels for more than $1.9 billion.

If approved, the hotel is expected to be open in 2025, and it will be designed by renowned architect Peter Marino. Marino has designed a number of residential and retail spaces in Los Angeles including the Dior location on Rodeo Drive. At a planning commission meeting on May 26, committee members expressed their support and excitement for the project.

“I believe that in moving this project forward we are advancing the greater good of Beverly Hills,” said vice chair Thomas C. Hudnut."
LVMH buys Napa Valley's Joseph Phelps Vineyards - Decanter.com,"Thu, 30 Jun 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlY2FudGVyLmNvbS93aW5lLW5ld3MvbHZtaC1idXlzLW5hcGEtdmFsbGV5cy1qb3NlcGgtcGhlbHBzLXZpbmV5YXJkcy00ODMzMjIv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Philippe Schaus, chairman and chief executive of the Moët Hennessy division of LVMH, called Joseph Phelps Vineyards ‘an iconic name and an iconic winery’.

Joseph Phelps founded his eponymous winery on a 260ha former cattle ranch in Napa Valley in 1973.

He turned it into one of California’s most prominent producers, famed for its flagship Insignia – a Bordeaux-style blend – and its pioneering use of Rhône varieties, which kick-started the ‘Rhône Rangers’ movement in the Golden State.

The founder’s son, Bill Phelps, joined the business in 1998 and serves as executive chairman, while third-generation family members are also part of the executive management team.

Joseph Phelps owns 172ha of vineyards in Napa Valley on nine estate plots, spread across St Helena, Rutherford, Oakville, Stags Leap District, Oak Knoll District, South Napa and Carneros. It also has 40ha over two vineyards on the western Sonoma Coast.

‘It’s important for us that we are acquiring a family business with a legacy and heritage,’ said Schaus. ‘It’s super important that we keep that heritage.’

LVMH portfolio

Moët Hennessy is best known for its Champagne portfolio, which includes Moët & Chandon, Krug, Veuve Clicquot, Dom Pérignon, Ruinart and Armand de Brignac, along with spirits such as Hennessy, Ardbeg and Glenmorangie.

However, it also has a formidable portfolio of still wines, featuring the likes of Château Cheval Blanc, Clos des Lambrays, Château Galoupet, Whispering Angel, Cloudy Bay and sweet wine Château d’Yquem.

It already owns the prestigious Newton Vineyard in Napa Valley’s Spring Mountain AVA, and it has now bolstered its Californian range with the Joseph Phelps Vineyards purchase

LVMH’s aim is to serve the manifold ‘moments of consumption’, from aperitifs and Champagne receptions to fine dining, bars, clubs and cocktails.

Shaus said Moët Hennessy was missing ‘a strong red wine’, so it swooped upon Joseph Phelps Vineyards.

‘LVMH values and embraces all of our brilliant and dedicated team members and all those who have spent decades helping to make Joseph Phelps Vineyards what it is today,’ said the Phelps family in a statement confirming the sale.

‘The added resources and support that LVMH brings will help carry the principles we all hold dear – innovation, sustainability, and the pursuit of excellence – forward to the next 50 years and beyond.’

LVMH has been seeking ways to elevate the online purchasing experience. Now, it has awarded the 2022 LVMH Innovation Award to London-based start-up Toshi, which offers a “wait and try” delivery service for online luxury consumers.

Founded in 2017, Toshi brings in-store services to the customer at a time and location that suits them, using public transportation as well as electric vehicles. Through its “wait and try” service, the Toshi delivery person waits while the client is doing fittings. “It’s delivery but with retail services. We are really the opposite of Amazon,” Sojin Lee, founder and CEO of Toshi — who helped to launch Net-a-Porter — tells Vogue Business.

Toshi already works with LVMH houses, including Christian Dior Couture, Celine, Tiffany & Co., Berluti and Rimowa, and just started with Louis Vuitton. It operates in London and New York and plans to launch in Los Angeles early next year, followed by Paris, Milan and Chicago, according to Lee. It won in the “operations and manufacturing excellence” category, as well as scooping the overall prize. More than 950 startups applied for the award, and 21 finalists were selected.

“E-commerce is at the heart of our business, in the context of elevation of online purchasing experience, like we have been doing for decades in physical retail,” says Antonio Belloni, LVMH group managing director. LVMH’s online penetration is “in the mid-teens”, according to the executive."

(Lab-grown diamonds normally are treated after growth to give them their color.)They also are “carbon negative”—Lusix’s solar farm produces more power than the factory consumes, Landa said—and are certified as “sustainable” by SCS Global Services , traits that appeal to today’s consumers, many of whom are concerned about climate change.“They (consumers) won’t buy products that aren’t consistent with their values,” he said.

The one-of-a-kind “Carrera Plasma,” the 44 mm watch set with lab-grown diamonds TAG Heuer introduced at Watches & Wonders Geneva earlier this year. Lusix supplied some of the diamonds to the LVMH-owned brand.

At its booth at JCK Las Vegas and on its website , Lusix uses the tagline “Sun Grown Diamonds,” a phrase it has trademarked, though its future viability in the U.S. market remains unclear.Under the Federal Trade Commission’s Jewelry Guides, which were updated in 2018, sellers of lab-grown diamonds must make it clear that their product is man-made.It recommends using one of three terms to do so: laboratory-grown, laboratory-created or [manufacturer name]-created. The word “cultured” can be used too, but must be “immediately accompanied, with equal conspicuousness” by one of these three terms, according to the FTC.“Sun Grown Diamonds,” with no mention of Lusix or the word laboratory, does not appear to fit within the FTC’s guidelines, though a Lusix spokesperson told National Jeweler on Tuesday that the company has asked the FTC to review its new tagline, which Lusix believes will stand.If not, Lusix will modify as the FTC recommends, she added.In addition to LVMH, the $90 million in funding included investment from Israel-based companies Ragnar Crossover Fund and More Investments Lusix said it will use the money to expand its production capacity, most notably with the opening of a second solar-powered facility slated to start production this summer. The new factory will “enable Lusix to better serve the increasing demand for lab-grown diamonds.”The company does not share production figures, though the spokesperson said the new facility will increase the company’s output five-fold.LVMH did not respond to request for comment on its investment in Lusix, including an inquiry about the future use of lab-grown diamonds by its watch and jewelry brands, though at least one of its brands already has begun experimenting.At Watches & Wonders Geneva this past spring, TAG Heuer unveiled the $375,000 “Carrera Plasma,” an automatic chronograph set with 11.7 carats of lab-grown diamonds supplied by Lusix as well as two other growers."

Premier agency Harlem’s Fashion Row and the North American division of multinational conglomerate LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton have officially announced their partnership to curate a more diverse, inclusive, and equitable fashion industry while doing the work to back up their mission.

According to an official press release sent to ESSENCE, the partnership between HFR and LVMH North America marks a moment in history as LVMH’s commitment to the support of HFR reflects their mutual agreement to discover, mentor, and give emerging talent of color the amplification they deserve through multi-platform, high-visibility events and customized pipeline programs. “Through this partnership, HFR and LVMH North America look forward to continuing their mission of giving designers of color access to individuals and organizations that can help shape their future,” read the official press statement of Brandice Daniel, CEO and Founder of HFR.

Conjunctively, we’ve created opportunities for youth to engage as early as high school, meeting the marginalized, particularly HBCU students, where they are in their fashion careers.”

The LVMH portfolio is one that is globally recognized including Dior, Sephora, Fendi, and more. Specifically, Tiffany & Co. and Louis Vuitton, both of which are globally recognized luxury brands across the LVMH group of Maisons, will collaborate with HFR to offer mentorship and activation opportunities in an effort to both create meaningful and effective change for the Harlem community and creating accessible opportunities for the next generation of emerging BIPOC designers. Supported initiatives that LVMH and HFR will partner together on throughout the year and beyond include, but aren’t limited to, The HFR ICON 360 HBCU Summit, HFR’s Designer Retreat, and The Black History Summit.

Smith continued, “We see this partnership with HFR as a wonderful opportunity to focus on values, culture, business, and community all at the same time, as these notions are not mutually exclusive, but interconnected and reinforcing one another.”"
VivaTech 2022: Luxury group LVMH and beauty giant L'Oréal on embracing metaverse and new tech - Euronews,"Sat, 18 Jun 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5ldXJvbmV3cy5jb20vbmV4dC8yMDIyLzA2LzE4L3ZpdmF0ZWNoLTIwMjItbHV4dXJ5LWdyb3VwLWx2bWgtYW5kLWJlYXV0eS1naWFudC1sb3JlYWwtb24tZW1icmFjaW5nLW1ldGF2ZXJzZS1hbmQtbmV3LXRlY9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"From the world’s thinnest watch from Bvlgari to mad make-up in the metaverse and tech that knows how you feel: Here’s how tech and fashion and beauty are merging in the digital world.

ADVERTISEMENT

Paris has been infiltrated by the tech elite this week as the VivaTech conference gets into full swing. But the occasion also affords the capital of fashion to showcase how it will incorporate tech and Web3.

Euronews Next spoke to LVMH, the home of luxury brands such as Louis Vuitton and Dior, and to beauty leader L'Oréal, to find out the latest innovations of France’s biggest luxury and beauty companies.

One of the most talked-about products and possibly one of the most expensive too is the Bvlgari Octo Finissimo Ultra, the world’s thinnest mechanical watch with a profile of 1.80 mm thick and at a cost of €250,000.

Not only is it designed to look good on your wrist, but the watch also has integrated NFT technology that provides digital proof of ownership.

The owner of the timepiece, of which only 10 have been made, can scan a QR code which then takes them to the NFT system where they can view the history of the watch, including design sketches.

“You can always say that you are actually connected with the moment of creation of the watch,” said Massimo Paloni, Chief Operations and Innovation Officer at Bvlgari.

“The QR code actually is different for each watch and because every QR code is different, every product is different. We wanted to actually create an experience for the customer.

“So when you scan the QR code, in reality, you enter into a mini-website and that mini-website gives you all the story, all the journey of our creators,” he said.

“You have the passport, the digital passport of the watch on the blockchain. You have the artwork minted on a polygon blockchain. And these two smart contents then are merged into a third smart contract that cannot be separated. So there is a flotation system by which the customer will never be able to separate. And this means that these NFTs will never be on the market”.

NFTs: the one to watch

LVMH has made other NFT watches with its brand Tag Heuer, which lets you display your NFT on the watch.

The company also allows you to buy the watch with cryptocurrency.

Finally, the metaverse plays a big role in the future plans of LVMH, which has a virtual shopping world for Sephora where you can try out bold make-up choices.

I might not be bold enough to wear orange lipstick, and so I would never think to try it on in the real world, but in the metaverse it's very frictionless Nelly Mensah Head of Web3 and Metaverse, LVMH

“Sephora was one of the very first brands to offer a virtual try-on for makeup with augmented reality and I think there's a couple of learnings here. So first of all, nothing will ever replace interacting with a physical product and especially with beauty and skincare. You want to know how it smells, what it feels like,” Nelly Mensah, head of Web3 and Metaverse at LVMH, told Euronews Next.

“But what the metaverse offers is inspiration. So, for example, I might not be bold enough to wear orange lipstick, and so I would never think to try it on in the real world, because I think, well, maybe that's not for me, but in the metaverse it's very frictionless to actually go through hundreds of colours really quickly.

“So imagine you are swiping through orange, purple, pink, and then you realise, wait, actually orange is a great look for me. And so then you either order it online or go into the store, have a conversation with a beauty advisor, and then buy the physical product. So I think those two go hand in hand”.

While doing your shopping in the metaverse, you could also own a Louis Vuitton handbag as an NFT. The real thing of course may be too expensive for most budgets.

Asked why you would want a digital-only version of the bag, Mensah said LVMH sees the future of luxury in the metaverse as a combination of the physical piece and the digital.

“We think that a consumer who spends a lot of their time in digital spaces will want to show off what they own in the real world. So if you own a physical retail handbag, you will then have a digital version of it,” she said.

“It's a digital twin that will give you even further benefits in the metaverse, or, for example, early access to a product or access to a metaverse environment that you can only enter if you have this digital product.

“And the way you have the digital product is you buy the physical one. So this combination of digital and physical is what we think will be the future of the space”.

The beauty of the metaverse

The beauty giant L'Oréal is also entering the metaverse.

At the start of June, its cosmetics subsidiary NYX announced it was partnering with The Sandbox metaverse and the blockchain lab People of Crypto.

The partnership will see an avatar collection which features different skin shades, gender identification, sexual orientation and different make-up looks.

“We know that the world is changing where people are going to want to experience products in the metaverse. So we have to think about what that's going to mean for a company and if we're doing it collectively with the digital teams as well as our team in research, and then we will see how we can create value and change people's behaviour and that that's always the most challenging part,” Guive Balooch, Global Vice President of L'Oréal’s Technology Incubator, said in an interview.

“And I think our approach the last 10 years [...] has helped us to understand that we have to really focus first on consumer needs and expectations”.

In its bright white stand, L'Oréal also showcased other tech-beauty innovations.

On Yves Saint Laurent’s scent booth, you could find the perfect perfume to match your mood.

It works by an ECG-based headset, created with the neurotech company EMOTIV, that tracks emotional responses to different scents and then analyses that data to make different product recommendations.

“When you look at fragrance today, there are some basic emotions that you're looking at - stress, energy, concentration. And today this kind of field of neurotechnology has been around for 50 years. So it's not something that just came out of the blue,” said Balooch.

“I think that, yes, this part is advancing. We are at 95 per cent. We're not at 100 per cent. So there will be some people that will have to do the experience a couple of times or may not get there right.

“But we will continue to inform with the data and try to get to a point where we can get it to be as close as we can to 100. I think beyond that, there's something else that I have to tell you, is that it's not a miracle device in that sense,” he added

“Some people like fragrances that make them relaxed. Some people like to be energised by fragrances. That's not something the headset can measure. This is why at the beginning, there still is a need for human intervention. We have to understand first what consumers want out of their fragrance”.

The beauty of sustainability

One of the more sustainable inventions is the company’s Water Saver.

It is a showerhead that uses rocket engine technology to create a luxurious and efficient hair washing experience while reducing water consumption by 61 per cent compared to standard methods.

For now, it is designed for use in hair salons and it has the potential to help save billions of litres of water annually.

“It allows you to have to 10 times smaller droplet size, which means the speed of the water can be the same, but the efficiency of each drop is very high. So I feel no difference in this, the strength and rinse, but I can save 61 per cent water,” said Balooch.

Asked if this technology could one day be rolled out to our homes, he said: “I think, I hope and I truly wish that that will be the case”."
LVMH takes centuries-old artisan skills stateside with inclusive recruitment approach - Vogue Business,"Mon, 27 Jun 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZvZ3VlYnVzaW5lc3MuY29tL2NvbXBhbmllcy9sdm1oLXRha2VzLWNlbnR1cmllcy1vbGQtYXJ0aXNhbi1za2lsbHMtc3RhdGVzaWRlLXdpdGgtaW5jbHVzaXZlLXJlY3J1aXRtZW50LWFwcHJvYWNo0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"To receive the Vogue Business newsletter, sign up here.

LVMH is expanding its artisan training programme to the US in partnership with Tiffany in an ongoing effort to preserve centuries-old skills. It’s hoping to attract diverse and underrepresented groups to get there.

The Institute of Métiers d’Excellence was founded in 2014 and has partnered with 39 LVMH maisons to date, including Bulgari, Christian Dior, Fendi, Givenchy and Louis Vuitton. For the US edition, it is working with Tiffany on a two-year Bench Jeweler Apprentice Program, teaching jewellery design application and artisan techniques. The first cohort will start in September and rotate through Tiffany workshops. IME is aiming for an equal split of men and women and is encouraging applicants from diverse and historically underrepresented communities.

To ensure the recruitment process is inclusive and to extend IME’s reach, LVMH is partnering with employment agencies, non-profit LGBTQ+ associations, and historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs) — higher education institutions in the US that were established before the Civil Rights Act with the intention of primarily serving the Black community. LVMH is also visiting schools and careers fairs in college towns, where previous apprentices and members of the HR team will answer students’ and parents’ questions. The luxury conglomerate launched a free digital platform called “Inside LVMH” last year that connects students and teachers with LVMH experts to show what it’s like to work at the company through articles, seminars and podcasts.

“The point is to put lights in their eyes, so they say, ‘I never would have pictured myself working at Louis Vuitton or Dior but, actually, yes, I could because I see somebody like me who has done it before and is happy about it’,” says LVMH EVP of human resources and synergies Chantal Gaemperle.

Tiffany echoes this focus on inclusivity. “Tiffany is deeply committed to building an inclusive workplace that honours diversity,” says the brand’s chief human resources officer Mary Bellai. “By supporting IME, we are proud to support the advancement of women and marginalised communities across our design and innovation centres. The advancement of skills-based and leadership training and opportunities for mentorship will assist with the development of our talent pipeline and long-term career trajectory among our employees.”"
LVMH Luxury Ventures Invests in Lab-grown Diamond Maker Lusix - WWD,"Mon, 13 Jun 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vd3dkLmNvbS9hY2Nlc3Nvcmllcy1uZXdzL2pld2VscnkvbHZtaC1sdXh1cnktdmVudHVyZXMtaW52ZXN0bWVudC1pc3JhZWxpLWxhYi1ncm93bi1kaWFtb25kLW1ha2VyLWx1c2l4LTEyMzUyMDM5NTAv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS — LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton has taken a minority stake in Lusix, a producer of lab-grown diamonds, the Israeli firm said.

The French luxury conglomerate’s investment arm LVMH Luxury Ventures was one of several participants in a $90 million investment round, alongside Israeli’s Ragnar Crossover Fund and investment house More, Lusix said in a statement.

In a bid to reduce emissions, the company uses solar power to grow its gem-quality diamonds, which it has trademarked as Sun Grown Diamonds.

“The company will use this investment to fuel its growth initiatives, notably the expansion of its production capacity in Israel with a second state-of-the-art facility, which will commence production this summer,” it said.

The investment comes as lab-grown diamonds, touted as a more sustainable alternative to natural diamonds, are making further inroads into the high jewelry market, against a backdrop of sanctions against Russia, a leading supplier of natural diamonds.

LVMH-owned watch brand Tag Heuer used Lusix diamonds on its showpiece Carrera Plasma timepiece, unveiled at the Watches & Wonders show in Geneva in March, touting the design as “truly revolutionary.”

“We are thrilled and proud to welcome such high-profile investors, most notably LVMH Luxury Ventures, bringing their financial support and valuable industry insights,” Lusix founder and chairman Benny Landa said in the statement.

“Their help will contribute greatly to our company’s success while the implications of this investment, both for Lusix and for the lab-grown diamond segment, are profound — and so exciting,” he added.

LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton established LVMH Luxury Ventures in 2017 with a mission to take minority stakes in early-stage luxury brands that have high growth potential and compelling business models.

Its first investments were French beauty brand Officine Universelle Buly 1803 and New York-based sneaker reseller Stadium Goods, both of which it has already exited.

In 2019, it took a minority stake in Gabriela Hearst, the luxury womenswear label devoted to sustainability.

Its current portfolio also includes streetwear brand Aimé Leon Dore, skin care brand Versed, apparel brand Madhappy, watch platform Hodinkee, mystery box start-up Heat and social shopping specialist Replika Software.

According to its website, LVMH Luxury Ventures targets companies with revenue between 5 million and 100 million euros, and makes equity investments ranging from 5 million euros to 20 million euros, yielding shareholdings of between 5 percent and 25 percent.

Among the eight finalists of this year’s edition is the Korean designer Ashlynn Park, who offers radical creations reminding of the anti-fashion designers of the 1990s, with her label Ashlyn she first launched in New York in 2021.

Ashlynn Park, founder of label Ashlyn and LVMH Prize 2022 finalist

NUMÉRO : What is your first memory about fashion? ASLYNN PARK : I vividly remember this day.. I was about five years old. There was a fashion show at a local college, and I was invited as a kid model. I wore a sapphire color glittery dress decorated with a big white bow collar. I proudly walked down the runway, and I looked around at all the people, and I loved it! Why did you decide to become a fashion designer? I grew up wanting to be an architect. Initially, I chose my first major in architecture at the college. During my first summer break, I took fashion illustration lessons and summited my designs to a fashion contest run by the Korea industrial minister, and I won. After that, I changed my major to fashion design. Which designers (living or not) inspired you and why? I’ve always aspired to be like my mentor Yohji Yamamoto who perfected both design and pattern making. He instilled me in a sense of pride and commitment to quality that would counter a world where overproduction and overconsumption in fashion have become the norm. Yohji taught me to question everything in my designs: what is the purpose of each detail? Do we really need that trim? I have also always been drawn to Charles James. I love his unconventional ideas of dressing during his time designing, and his thoughtful attention to detail.

Dillan dress from Ashlyn's fall-winter 2021-2022 and fall-winter 2022-2023 collections.

After winning the Japanese Award in 2008 SO-EN, you worked for Yohji Yamamoto in Paris, how was this experience? Working for Yohji instilled in me a great respect for the incredible artistry he put into his work; the attention to every detail, and the focus on perfecting the interior construction of the garment. I will continue to work in this way and share this technique with my team and future generations of designers. After that, you move to NYC to work with Alexander Wang and then Raf Simons at Calvin Klein. What did you learn from them? At Alexander Wang, I used my skills as a patternmaker and menswear designer to develope my expertise in women’s tailoring and eveningwear. Working under Raf Simons at Calvin Klein, I returned to a focus on menswear tailoring, specifically jackets and coats. Of course, Calvin Klein mastered the technique of minimalist design, and working for Raf Simmons during his tenure there helped me to push the boundaries of this traditional medium. Eventually you launched your own brand. How did you know it was the right time to do it? The first collection was created while I was working as a freelancer at another company. During the day I would work on the company’s collection, then at night, in my own home, I would focus on my own collection. I spent three years developing my core collection to achieve the perfect fit, which I finally presented in early 2021. I started designing the FW21 main collection during the pandemic, a time of serious pause, reflection and rebirth. I challenged myself to reevaluate my role as a designer: how could I change the fashion system to reduce its adverse impact on the environment? I committed myself and my company to make this change. I focused on eliminating waste in cutting and adjusting my production system; items are pre-ordered, never mass-produced.

Quinn dresses from Ashlyn fall-winter 2021-2022 collection.

You were born in Seoul where you studied fashion, before studying in Tokyo then Paris and New York. How do all these cultures shape your vision and influence you today for your brand? I am forever grateful to have experienced such a wealth of culture in my design upbringing. It’s uniquely shaped who I am as a designer, and instilled values that I hope to pass on to future generations of designers. Throughout it all, I’ve always stayed true to my understating of Japanese conceptual design, which focuses on working on a project until near perfection. Could you name 3 emblematic garments of Ashlynn and why are they representative of your brand? Dillan Shirt Dress (FW21 in cotton + FW22 in silk): This zero-waste garment is draped and constructed from a single piece of fabric. It showcases ASHLYN’s commitment to the environment. The Met noticed the importance of the design and purchased the original version from FW21 to become a part of their permanent collection. Quinn Gown (FW21) / Payton Gown (SS22): With these gowns, I explored a new modern shape and silhouette. I added a hand drawing cutout line on the back of the Quinn Gown and moved it to the front bodice in Payton Gown. This has become of ASHLYN’s signature styles.

If you’re LVMH, you’re betting on the latter.

The luxury titan just acquired California‘s famous Joseph Phelps Vineyards. The family-owned estate is best known for its red table wines and premium Bordeaux-style blend Insignia.

The terms of the deal were not disclosed, but Moët Hennessy chairman and CEO Philippe Schaus told CNBC that the vineyard had the right mix of scale, brand, product offerings and quality to add to the company’s portfolio. He had been scouring the world for larger winemakers that held the same values as LVMH, and he found Joseph Phelps to be the perfect fit.

“It’s an iconic name and an iconic winery,” Schaus said. “It’s important for us that we are acquiring a family business with a legacy and heritage. It’s super important that we keep that heritage.”

Phelps was founded in 1973 by its namesake, Joseph Phelps, and now produces about 750,000 bottles of wine a year. Its high-end Insignia blend sells for at least $250 per bottle, depending on the vintage. The vineyard will help round out LVMH’s wine offerings by bringing a “strong red,” as Schaus called it, to the portfolio, which also includes Cloudy Bay white wines and Whispering Angel rosé.

Across its drink offerings, LVMH is riding the tailwinds of a surge in demand for high-end wine and spirits. In the first quarter of 2021, Moët Hennessy reported revenue of about $1.71 billion (€1.64 billion), up 8 percent over 2021. Schaus attributed some of that demand to the resurgence in travel occurring across the globe, but especially in Europe and the US.

“The summer will be strong, people are traveling and consuming,” he told the publication. “After the summer, we could see a different situation. It’s hard to predict inflation and prices.”

Despite the company’s stellar first quarter, LVMH hasn’t been immune to the supply-chain shortages hitting just about every industry at the moment. Many of its problems have been overcome, but the high-end champagne market is still facing some difficulties. Currently, supply can’t be increased to meet demand, since many brands need to age for a number of years before being sold to the public.

Maybe some consumers upset by the lack of Dom Pérignon on store shelves, though, will turn to Joseph Phelps. It’s no champagne, but some of the vineyard’s wines, as Robb Report said earlier this year, are seriously exciting."
Harlem's Fashion Row Partners With LVMH to Support Diverse Talent - WWD,"Wed, 15 Jun 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigQFodHRwczovL3d3ZC5jb20vZmFzaGlvbi1uZXdzL2Rlc2lnbmVyLWx1eHVyeS9oYXJsZW1zLWZhc2hpb24tcm93LXBhcnRuZXJzLXdpdGgtbHZtaC10by1zdXBwb3J0LWRpdmVyc2UtZmFzaGlvbi10YWxlbnQtMTIzNTIwNzMxMi_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Teaming up to support the next generation of diverse fashion talent, Harlem’s Fashion Row has forged a partnership with LVMH North America through which the two organizations will work toward a more diverse, equitable and inclusive fashion industry.

Revealing the partnership at a press conference Wednesday morning at the Whitby Hotel in New York, the partnership marks a commitment from LVMH to support HFR’s mission of discovering, mentoring and showcasing emerging talents of color through multiplatform, high-visibility events and customized pipeline programs.

LVMH has committed resources to address issues of diversity, equity and inclusion across the sector through people, business and brand initiatives and to support the next generation of diverse talent.

One of the key initiatives revealed at Wednesday’s press conference is that LVMH will be the title sponsor of Harlem’s Fashion Row’s 15th annual fashion show and style awards in New York on Sept. 6 in Harlem.

The goal of the partnership is to open doors to the next generation of talented Black, indigenous and people of color designers and connect emerging Black designers to global luxury brands across the LVMH group, which range from Louis Vuitton and Tiffany to Christian Dior, Fendi and Sephora.

“This is the biggest partnership we’ve ever had in North America and we couldn’t be more excited about it. Of course, there’s a D&I component to this, but first and foremost this is about celebrating the incredible wealth of heritage, history, culture, art and innovation of Harlem and bringing that into our world. We search the world for creative talent, it is our competitive advantage. It is the future of every single one of our brands,” said Anish Melwani, LVMH North America chief executive officer.

“Through this partnership, HFR and LVMH North America look forward to continuing their mission of giving designers of color access to individuals and organizations that can help shape their future,” said Brandice Daniel, CEO and founder of HFR. “We’ve successfully introduced a wealth of diverse designers to a world-class fashion curriculum consisting of invaluable tools and resources to grow their businesses and have educated Gen Z on how they too can change fashion’s course. Conjunctively, we’ve created opportunities for youth to engage as early as high school, meeting the marginalized, particularly HBCU students where they are in their fashion careers.”

Brands from across the LVMH portfolio, including Tiffany and Louis Vuitton, will continue to collaborate with HFR to offer mentorship and activation opportunities throughout the year and beyond. Some examples of supported initiatives include:

THE HFR Icon 360 HBCU Summit: The HBCU Summit looks to transform the art and fashion programs at Historically Black Colleges and Universities in the U.S. by providing direct design expertise from industry experts. In collaboration with HFR and North Carolina A&T State University’s A&T Art and Fashion Department, Tiffany & Co. will sponsor the Tenacity Talks, a 10-week lecture series featuring industry experts on topics such as jewelry design and innovation.

HFR’S Designer Retreat: This three-day retreat hosted more than 75 designers and featured several fashion speakers. During “Industry Stops,” designers were able to visit the North American offices of Louis Vuitton and meet with executives, including Lanessa Elrod, zone president and CEO, and Thomas Haupt, senior vice president of U.S. Retail.

Black History Month Summit: Providing a forum for conversation with industry leaders, LVMH’s Melwani and vice president of D&I Corey Smith joined Daniel to discuss the current state of diversity in fashion.

Smith said, “LVMH is committed to having a positive impact in our communities and realizing the path forward set by Virgil Abloh and others who helped foster equity and inclusion in the fashion industry by supporting and building a pool of diverse creative talent. It is critical for LVMH as an organization to continue developing talent of color internally, while ensuring the relevance of our brands and our products in an evolving and diverse consumer landscape. We see this partnership with HFR as a wonderful opportunity to focus on values, culture, business and community all at the same time, as these notions are not mutually exclusive, but interconnected and reinforcing one another.”

Daniel explained how the two organizations got together and how it’s working out so far. “We’re so excited about our partnership with LVMH. We had a conversation last year in the offices, and that one conversation has created such a rich partnership with a few different initiatives. They’ve really been incredible partners,” said Daniel. She said HFR has always been very thoughtful about which brands they partner with, “and this brand is truly doing the work.”

According to Melwani, he was introduced to the organization at HFR’s 14th annual fashion show and got to understand “how it taps into this incredible wealth of talent right here in our backyard.”

He also said that as he’s gotten to know the organization and their designers, he realized they share many of the same values. “The values of LVMH are entrepreneurship, creativity and innovation, and commitment to excellence, all of which are consistent with the programs of Harlem’s Fashion Week,” said Melwani.

Gena Smith, chief human resources officer at LVMH North America, said the company has a longstanding commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion and launched its first work back in 2011. She said the number-one core value at LVMH is its people. “People make the difference. Everything we have at LVMH and all the reasons for the success of our group comes down to people,” she said. She said it’s the people who make the product, market the product and talk about it. “How do we make sure the best and smartest and most creative people want to work for LVMH?” she said.

Last year Corey Smith also went to the 14th annual HFR show after having joined LVMH during the pandemic. “Your show was the first show that I went to as a newbie to this industry during New York Fashion Week, and if there’s any other better way to be inducted into this industry, it doesn’t exist. I was blown away. They took over an entire Harlem block, and made it phenomenal.” After it was over, he hunted down Daniel and Felita Harris, HFR’s chief strategy and revenue officer, and said, “I need this next year. The level of luxury, the attention to detail, the diversity and inclusion that was organic to the event.” He said there were people of disabilities and an array of tones and skin colors and gender fluidity. “It physically manifested everything we are trying to accomplish at LVMH in one show, and a light bulb went off,” said Corey Smith.

He said LVMH wants to align with organizations that can help them do the things that on their own, they might need help doing. He also said this partnership is two-way. “It’s not just cutting a big check and saying go for it. It is really about we have things to offer, but you also have things you can help us learn as well,” said Cory Smith.

Melwani pointed out it comes down to what they all learned from Virgil Abloh, the late artistic director of Louis Vuitton menswear. “Virgil taught by doing, not just by talking. In fact, he talked very little. It was only after the murder of George Floyd that he came to us and wanted to speak internally to all of our people. Otherwise, he talked through his work. What he showed us, in this industry, there are so many barriers, there’s so much privilege that has to be counteracted, and how difficult it is for any emerging designer to break through and just be seen and have their work be discovered. He did it by bringing along people with him, whether that was makeup artists, models and other creative directors. Just by making them visible and giving them access to this very privileged world….it makes it better. For us, we still have a lot to learn as an organization, and sadly we didn’t get to finish all the lessons from Virgil.”

Access is a big piece that’s been missing for designers of color, said Daniel.

Corey Smith said they constantly speak about LVMH being relevant in the future. “We have a very rich brand heritage, very rich brand DNA, it is always always looking backward, all of our founders and how they started, very entrepreneurial. What’s our future relevance? The only way we will continue to be relevant in the future is if we start to tap into the new creators, the new designers. The future looks very different than the past. We have recognized it, we understand it and we embrace it. Again, it makes good business sense.”

Daley won the LVMH Prize for 2022, securing a cash prize of €300,000 for founder Steven Stokey-Daley as well as a year of mentorship by executives at luxury’s biggest conglomerate.

Stokey-Daley has become a breakout fashion star as his romantic, contemporary twist on British dress codes gained traction, with the likes of pop singer Harry Styles sporting his super-wide-legged canvas trousers and a dried-flower headress from the designer in a 2020 music video. Since then his label has been picked up by e-tailers Ssense and Matchesfashion, and he’s staged fashion shows incorporating socially-engaged performances that explored class and coming-of-age in British society.

“This just feels like the highest form of validation ever,” Daley told reporters following the prize ceremony.

The designer said he looked forward to having “mentorship to manage growth,” as he sought to establish the right mix between direct-to-consumer and wholesale channels.

He said he planned to expand his ultra-small team, starting with help on e-commerce, inventories and fulfilment. “I’ve really just been doing it all myself,” he admitted.

LVMH also honoured two American labels, granting its Karl Lagerfeld prize (an award for runners-up dedicated to the late designer) to ERL and Winnie New York.

At the ceremony, ERL’s founder Eli Russell Linnetz spoke about drawing on his background as a filmmaker to emphasise the narrative dimension of fashion. His Venice Beach-based brand has become known for colourful, nostalgia-soaked twists on American fashion codes, and recently collaborated with Dior Homme.

Winnie New York’s founder Idris Balogun — a Nigerian-born designer known for mixing Savile Row tailoring with international cultural references linked to the African diaspora — thanked the prize for providing a “platform for talking about what I wanted to talk about.”

What’s Behind LVMH’s Investment in a Lab-Grown Company? - JCK,"Wed, 22 Jun 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmpja29ubGluZS5jb20vZWRpdG9yaWFsLWFydGljbGUvbHZtaHMtaW52ZXN0bWVudC1sYWItZ3Jvd24v0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LVMH Luxury Ventures’ investment in Lusix was eyebrow-raising and noteworthy. What does it mean going forward?

When asked why LVMH invested in his nascent diamond-growing company, Lusix’s owner, Israeli billionaire Benny Landa, said at a JCK Las Vegas press conference: “Clearly, [LVMH] have made a financial investment. But I would ask myself, ‘Why would a luxury brand make a financial investment?’ There’s obviously very good reasons.”

After discussing that question with some well-informed folks, here are the best possible guesses.

One complaint I often hear from lab-created diamond sellers is that growers can’t produce consistently or reliably. That issue has led to at least one lawsuit.

“It’s hard to find nice-quality goods,” Ada Diamonds cofounder Lindsay Reinsmith told me last year. “If I had to guess, that’s the No. 1 reason that an LVMH brand has not stepped in [to the lab-grown market]. There are not enough nice goods available.”

If LVMH ever wanted to offer a lab-grown product—especially if it wanted to sell it at a big name, like Tiffany—it would need scale. Lusix says its production is more consistent and high-quality than others. Of course, it’s not the first grower to make that claim; only time will tell if that actually pans out. But LVMH’s investment will help Lusix scale its possibly more consistent production.

Which raises the question: Would LVMH—known for ultraexclusive luxury–ever offer lab-grown diamonds at one of its jewelry brands? One has to believe it may consider it, as it’s already used lab-grown diamonds on a TAG Heuer watch.

Consider LVMH’s plan for Tiffany: It’s targeting a younger demo; it wants to “elevate” the brand to reach higher price points; and it continually seeks—and even seems to crave—attention. Launching a lab-grown diamond line might tick two of those boxes, though it’s still not clear how lab-growns are playing in China, another brand focus. But if lab-grown diamonds are used as “starter” price-point jewelry, it could tick all three. (For the record, Tiffany’s past management said that lab-grown diamonds are “not a luxury material.”)

Which brings up another question: Would an LVMH brand ever carry lab-grown engagement rings?

That might be harder to imagine, given how natural diamond solitaires are the backbone of LVMH brands such as Tiffany. But it’s a little easier to conceive following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, which is looking like a long, multiyear slog. Even if the war ends tomorrow, Alrosa might not get off the U.S. sanctioned entity list for some time. That leaves a possibly huge gap in diamond supply.

On LVMH’s most recent earnings call, chief financial officer Jean Jacques Guiony said, “We are currently working on replacing sourcing from Russia, from other locations, and it’s perfectly doable in a reasonably short time frame.”

Might Lusix be part of its short- or long-term solution? We’ll see.

Also worth noting: Lusix is marketing its diamonds as “sun-grown,” as they are produced with solar power. At the press conference, Landa said he wants “Sun Grown Diamonds” to become a “brand within a brand,” like Intel Inside.

That’s telling; when gem companies talk about “ingredient brands,” they almost always reference Intel—see Forevermark, Gemfields, WD Lab Grown, and, um, Alrosa.

Of course, building any kind of brand is expensive, provided a company is serious about it, which I’m not sure Lusix is. Landa declined to spell out any ad plans, but Intel’s annual marketing budget is over $1 billion.

It’s also not clear whether the term sun-grown complies with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) Guides for describing lab-grown gems, especially if that term is used alone, and not with another recommended descriptor. (Those are currently limited to lab-grown, lab-created, and [company]-created.)

In 2019, the FTC warned lab-grown companies against using terms that “could suggest that the diamonds are naturally grown,” specifically calling out the term pure grown.

If FTC attorneys are on record objecting to the term pure grown, it’s hard to imagine sun-grown, a frequent descriptor for fruits and vegetables, would fare any better.

Sara Yood, deputy general counsel of the Jewelers Vigilance Committee notes “the [FTC] Green Guides caution against terms that could suggest laboratory-grown diamonds are naturally grown.… Sun-grown diamonds could be implying to a consumer that the diamonds were naturally grown. This claim, without qualification, could absolutely deceive a consumer, and I would expect the FTC would agree.”

She adds that phrases “like ‘solar-power lab-grown diamonds’ or possibly even just ‘solar lab-grown diamonds’ would be OK under the current guides.” But she believes that sun-grown diamonds would not be.

Lusix spokesperson Elizabeth Chatelain responds: “We think it’s an accurate descriptor. Maybe five years ago, it would have been confusing for consumers, but now we feel that they understand the difference. In the consumer’s mind, there are two terms: natural/mined and grown/created diamonds.”

[UPDATE: Lusix says it’s reached out to the FTC to make sure its wording is okay. If not, it will follow its recommended modification.]

Regardless, this does explain some comments Landa made to me during a post–press conference interview, which first struck me as strange, but now make more sense. In them, he compared growing diamonds to growing tomatoes.

Lusix’s diamond growers work like “a tomato grower in a greenhouse,” he said. “We don’t replace nature. All we do is create the environment that nature can create a diamond. We do it in a chamber, but it’s nature that creates the assembly that creates the diamond, just like it’s nature that grows the tomatoes. All the farmer does is create the right conditions—the soil, etc.—that enables nature to create the product.”

With all due respect to Mr. Landa—who has that salesman’s skill of seeming completely committed to what he’s saying—there’s obvious differences between a highly mechanized factory and a greenhouse or a farm. Greenhouses are hundreds of years old. They were around before electricity. Diamond-growing machines require huge amounts of power and were invented in the mid-20th century.

Landa did admit that diamond growing is “not a natural process,” but claimed tomato growing isn’t natural either.

Now it’s true, there are greenhouses and farms that use so many industrial processes, including chemical pesticides and GMOs, that they can’t qualify as organic. I’m not sure why Landa would want to lump his process in with those operations. Regardless, some greenhouse-grown tomatoes can be certified organic. By contrast, no lab-growing facility would be certified as natural, no matter how many clever analogies one comes up with.

When talking on the Rapaport podcast about the supposed eco benefits of lab-grown diamonds, Landa said that “all you have to do is look at a picture” of a mine.

If that’s all you have to do, let’s have some visual aids.

Here’s a photo of a tomato being grown in a greenhouse:

And here’s a picture of Lusix’s diamond growing factory.

There are many positive things one can say about solar-powered lab-grown diamond machines. Comparing them to tomato plants is, at best, a stretch.

Why am I harping on this? Landa is an accomplished businessman who clearly chooses his words with care and rarely wanders off message. These comments were likely said purposefully.

It’s an odd mix, the way Landa boasts his factory is the “most advanced, most fully automated” one around, but also eco-markets his diamonds as “sun-grown”—just like tomatoes. (They’re equally non-natural!)

Lusix has the potential to uplift the lab-grown industry. There are plenty of fine lab-grown companies. But that sector has also been a magnet for BS artists, criminals, and the Chinese military. It’s also seen its share of misleading rhetoric and wanton disregard for FTC regs.

Lusix has the chance to do better, to improve the entire category. That’s likely what attracted LVMH. Going forward, I hope it sets its sights on realizing that potential.

Inside the Shakeup at Marc Jacobs | BoF - The Business of Fashion,"Mon, 27 Jun 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzb2ZmYXNoaW9uLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy9sdXh1cnkvaW5zaWRlLXRoZS1zaGFrZXVwLWF0LW1hcmMtamFjb2JzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"NEW YORK — That 59-year-old Marc Jacobs has become an influencer, speaking directly to his 1.7 million Instagram followers about everything from relationships to plastic surgery, is perhaps no surprise. Many of his peers — including Isaac Mizrahi and Todd Oldham — have also attracted fervent online fans, especially those nostalgic for the 1990s, when fashion designers were idolised like rock stars.

But Jacobs is different.

His followers aren’t just scouring vintage stores and resale sites for rare pieces from his Spring/Summer 1998 collection, or pristine versions of his Stella handbag, first beloved in the mid-aughts. They’re buying new Marc Jacobs as well. Baby tees from Heaven, the youth-driven sub-line designed by art director and digital star Ava Nirui. And tote bags from the main collection.

He’s still staging closely-watched runway shows, too. On Monday, the designer will present his latest at the New York Public Library in Midtown Manhattan, where he remains a hometown hero with the glossy magazine scrum.

In fact, the Marc Jacobs label is on the up. While owner LVMH doesn’t break out revenues for its brands, a source close to the business said that sales are up by double-digit percentage points from pre-pandemic levels. Over the next 18 months, the company will open 20 stores.

It’s a long way from 2017, when the future of Marc Jacobs was in question.

The turnaround is the product of a restructuring engineered by chief executive Eric Marechalle, who arrived five years ago from another LVMH-owned brand, Kenzo. Marechalle cut costs, scaling back the brand’s runway collection. He found a way to translate Jacobs’ madcap vision, which the fashion world loves, into something more accessibly priced that still comes off as original and novel, rather than watered down. He’s also managed to layer in new elements, like Heaven.

Add a laser-focused accessories programme, which includes the top-selling “Tote” and “Snapshot” styles, and the company is on track to generate $1 billion in annual sales in the next three to five years. (That’s not including its robust — and still growing — fragrance business with Coty.)

The brand wasn’t always as healthy.

“We were in a situation five years ago that had to change,” Marechalle said during an interview in the company’s Spring Street office building in New York’s Soho neighbourhood.

We were in a situation five years ago that had to change.

For many years, the success of Marc Jacobs the brand was less important to LVMH than retaining Jacobs at Louis Vuitton. (The company often invests in the namesake labels of its top designers as deal sweeteners.) Starting in 1997, Jacobs helped transform Vuitton from an old-world luggage label into a global fashion juggernaut, not only through his well-regarded runway shows but also headline-making accessories collaborations with the likes of artists Takashi Murakami and Richard Prince. (In 2000, Louis Vuitton was valued at $6.9 billion, according to Interbrand’s annual ranking of the “best” brands in the world. By 2014, the year Jacobs exited the brand, it was valued at $22.5 billion.)

The fact that handbags and shoes from the designer’s namesake Marc Jacobs label, as well as its contemporary Marc x Marc Jacobs line, became a major sales driver in the 2000s was icing on the cake. (At its peak, Marc x Marc Jacobs generated around $400 million a year in revenue, according to analyst estimates.)

During its first 15-or-so years under the LVMH umbrella, the Marc Jacobs team experimented with retail and product concepts — who can forget the corner store on Bleecker Street that sold branded lipstick pens? Its runway, too, became a talking point: the most anticipated show of the New York season. But as Jacobs — who was living part-time in Paris (for Vuitton) and part-time in New York — faced a series of personal setbacks and Marc Jacobs co-founder Robert Duffy receded from the picture, the label blew through CEOs at a rapid clip.

It wasn’t until Jacobs’ tenure at Vuitton ended that the group began seriously contemplating the future potential of the Marc Jacobs business, which was cruising along but no longer at the height of cool. There was even talk of an IPO.

“Marc Jacobs wasn’t even a $10 million company when we invested in it. Now it’s making a billion euros a year in revenue,” LVMH CEO and Chairman Bernard Arnault said at the company’s annual investor day in 2014. “Marc Jacobs is the most emblematic designer in the United States. [An IPO could mean] that over the next five to 10 years one company could equal a third of the value of the group. You can see the kind of promise all of this holds.”

That year, LVMH brought in Sebastian Suhl, a seasoned executive with successes at Prada, Valentino and Givenchy under his belt, to manage the company’s next phase.

The first thing he did was close Marc x Marc Jacobs, the contemporary cash cow, with the intention of folding the lower-priced collection into the main line. “Collapsing” collections was in vogue at the time. Versace, Dolce & Gabbana and Burberry all made similar moves, with the intention of streamlining operations and sending a unified brand message to consumers.

Suhl’s plan was never to get rid of more affordable pieces, but instead give everything the same point of view, one that had more personality than something that could easily be found at Zara. The change, however, confused wholesale buyers, and many reduced their orders of the collection, which included lots of different products at different price points.

By 2017, the business was suffering, most evident to insiders in the runway shows at New York’s Park Avenue Armory, which were stripped bare of any set decoration to conserve budget. The closure of several Marc Jacobs stores — including its most famous, a converted garage on Mercer Street, and a string of five outposts on a little chunk of Bleecker Street in the West Village — made it even more clear that the company was in trouble.

“I’m more concerned about Marc Jacobs than the U.S. president,” Arnault said on a January 2017 earnings call, one week after Donald Trump was sworn into office.

Suhl was out, replaced by Marechalle, who was credited with transforming Kenzo into a youth-driven, contemporary-priced label designed by Opening Ceremony’s Humberto Leon and Carol Lim.

But Marechalle’s early moves backfired. In early 2018, he hired John Targon, a designer best known for co-founding knitwear label Baja East, to create a new, lower-priced collection. Targon lasted all of three months. (Olympia Le Tan, the French accessories designer who popularised embroidered book clutches, was quietly inserted into the mix and stayed a while longer, only to be laid off at the beginning of the pandemic.)

LVMH could have simply closed the brand, or even sold it off, as it did with the underperforming Donna Karan International. But Marc Jacobs was still widely known and widely beloved by fashion obsessives. Closing or disposing of it could be a reputational risk. What’s more, its fragrances were still bestsellers, generating hundreds of millions of dollars a year in sales. And its positioning was still a better fit for LVMH than Donna Karan.

Marechalle’s plan, in some ways, was in line with the label’s history. Going back to the 1980s, when he sold a “junior” collection at Macy’s, Jacobs has almost always offered some sort of accessibly priced product, whether that was a full collection or cleverly branded tchotchkes.

However, LVMH’s track record with US-based apparel brands is not great. In the late 1990s, it invested in Michael Kors, Donna Karan International and Marc Jacobs, selling off Kors long before it peaked and Donna Karan in 2016 after several failed attempts at revitalisation. But with the retooled Marc Jacobs, the group seems to think it’s finally figured the market out.

“In America, we expect brands to be more democratic,” Marechalle said. “A broader audience can buy it.”

Sidney Toledano, CEO of the LVMH fashion group, which includes Marc Jacobs, further explained the strategy. He mentioned Ralph Lauren, which makes high-end clothes, but generates a good portion of its revenue from $95 polo shirts.

“It’s hard to be a luxury [fashion] brand in the United States, unless you are, frankly, imported,” Toledano said, noting that ready-to-wear businesses take decades to build in luxury, and having close access to expert ateliers, but also manufacturing, makes it more manageable in Europe. In the US, where high-end manufacturing is all but dead, “it’s hard to develop.”

The more democratic approach comes at a time when the market needs it, said retail consultant Robert Burke. Today, contemporary-priced brands like Ganni and Tibi are thriving: the difference between the old way and the new is that they are billing themselves as designer-driven rather than trend-driven. And demand for new brands is high.

“There’s a big void right now in affordable, interesting fashion,” Burke said. “This path [for Marc Jacobs] makes a lot of sense to me.”

But how did Marechalle pull it off? His first goal was to better link Jacobs’ still-admired runway collections with what was sold in stores.

“When Marc’s doing a show, his pieces are extraordinary, but it’s not very accessible,” he said. “What we’ve improved a lot is our capacity to develop this commercially viable product that is really in Marc’s vision.”

Runway Marc Jacobs, Autumn 2021 collection. Marc Jacobs Runway Marc Jacobs, Autumn 2021 collection. Marc Jacobs

The main collection, priced as accessible luxury — or contemporary — was rebranded The Marc Jacobs, filled with products directly riffing on Jacobs’ runway takes. While there were already budget cuts underway, when the pandemic hit in 2020 the company laid off 60 people — including designers and other corporate employees — and shrunk things further. The runway collection was reduced to two seasons, sold exclusively through Bergdorf Goodman.

This could be construed as a major dressing down for Jacobs, whose public identity was, especially at the time, mostly defined by his shows. But both he and Marechalle position it differently: by withdrawing pressure to make the runway commercially viable en masse, Jacobs has no creative restraints.

“That’s classic in terms of the way most designer businesses work,” Jacobs told BoF. “My process hasn’t changed: I basically think about fashion all the time. Now that we focus on smaller [output], it gives me complete freedom to tell a story and say something. We have less resources, yes, but it’s very high-end, without any limitations, and that’s what’s most important.”

The new mainline may have been tweaked to better serve Jacobs’ fanbase, but was there a way to attract a new generation of consumers? A third collection — Heaven — was developed by Nirui, a Brooklyn-based creative who had become known for her one-off, “bootleg” items — a Barbie dressed in a “Prada” polo neck, a pair of Nike Air Max made from bullet-proof nylon — as well as an interest in Jacobs’ early designs. Nirui drives the aesthetic, using her own circle of image makers and collaborators, like the illustrator Ancco or video director Hideyuki Tanaka, rather than Jacobs’ go-to’s.

“It’s really Ava’s baby,” Jacobs said. “What’s interesting to her about our past and our history … feels fresh and new. In a way, it’s like Marc x Marc, but I don’t really have much interaction. Ava really has a very specific community of creative people who are outside of this company.”

Today, Heaven is a fast-growing piece of the business, but it is its popularity among young people that makes it so valuable to the overall brand. Pieces regularly sell out and can be found on online secondhand retailers like Depop, often for far more than they were originally priced. (A $185 cropped, broken-stripe cardigan — sold out — is currently listed on the marketplace for $500.)

Searches for “Marc Jacobs Heaven” have increased by 67 percent in the last year, according to Agustina Panzoni, the platform’s trends and category manager, with searches for the label’s “teddy” logo tee — worn by Olivia Rodrigo and Bella Hadid — up 35 percent over the past six months.

Panzoni noted that Heaven also dovetails the emerging “weird girl” aesthetic on TikTok — all reminiscent of Jacobs 1990s, early-2000s heyday, when his own look, and the looks he was creating as a designer, were deeply reflective of the skate and underground youth culture of the time.

Cultural relevance is critical, but so is a successful accessories business. For the first time in several years, Marc Jacobs is making popular bags, with accessories its fastest-growing product category.

The Snapshot, a cross-body camera bag, was for many years the label’s best-selling product, followed closely by a simple $250 tote, with “The Tote: Marc Jacobs” printed in its signature font, an unforgettable spin on Engravers Gothic. Now, the Tote — rendered with Jacobs’ signature humour and lightness — has eclipsed the Snapshot as the top seller. These are not the thousand-dollar-plus bags Jacobs used to sell, but again, the focus is on reaching many rather than a privileged few. And with something like the Snapshot, the silhouette feels unique to Marc Jacobs, an almost impossible task to pull off in handbag design, where nearly everything is referential.

Beauty, probably the most stable element of the business over the past decade, is also evolving. In the past, a brand like Jacobs’ could have subsisted on fragrance sales alone, and it remains a pivotal part of the business. Marc Jacobs fragrances generated more than $39 million in the first four months of 2022 in the US, up from $36 million during the same period in 2021, according to NPD data shared by a source who requested anonymity because the information was confidential. It’s the ninth-best-selling fragrance brand in the US, based on that data.

But a much-hyped makeup and cosmetics collection, launched by Kendo, LVMH’s beauty incubator, in 2013, was put on hold in 2021. Marechalle said that it will relaunch, although he wants to approach it in an “innovative” way that makes sense with how he has rebuilt the rest of the business.

Now, Marechalle is expanding on the structure he has put in place. Colour cosmetics will at some point return, the retail network is set to expand and more runway collection retail partners will likely be added beyond the US. Given that the US and Europe — its first and second-biggest markets — are on track, the company is focused on expanding its business in Asia.

For Jacobs, who loves to post the hashtag #gratefulnothateful, it’s a best-case scenario. He gets to keep designing, without many of the pressures that come today with creative director roles. While he said he can “rise creatively to a request from merchandising,” he isn’t a merchandiser himself, and Marechalle doesn’t expect him to be.

“Over the years, we’ve had a lot of CEOs and most of them have done nothing to really grow this business or help this company,” Jacobs said. “I really love Eric, and I’m not just saying that. He allows me the freedom that I so want to do what I do.”

"LVMH Prize 2022 Winner: S.S. Daley, Designer Interview - Highsnobiety","Thu, 02 Jun 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhpZ2hzbm9iaWV0eS5jb20vcC9sdm1oLXByaXplLTIwMjItcy1zLWRhbGV5LXdpbm5lci1pbnRlcnZpZXcv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Steven Stokey Daley, the founder of his eponymous S.S. Daley brand, has won the 2022 LVMH Prize, while his peers Eli Russell Linnetz (ERL) and Idris Balogun (Winnie New York) earned the Karl Lagerfeld Prize. It's big news, big enough that Daley himself couldn't believe it.

""It's kinda just sinking in now,"" the 25-year-old designer said in a post-win interview with press. ""It feels like the highest form of validation ever.""

Daley's excitement about winning the prize — which includes €300k and a dedicated mentorship — was only amplified by meeting members of the LVMH Prize jury whom he's admired since being in fashion school, especially J.W. Anderson, Kim Jones, and Stella McCartney.

""They also came up through London,"" Daley continued. ""It feels incredible to have met them.""

All eight LVMH Prize 2022 finalists — ERL, S.S. Daley, Winnie New York, Ashlyn, KNWLS, Roisin Pierce, RYUNOSUKEOKAZAKI, and Tokyo James — boasted some of the most eco-conscious collections of any LVMH Prize thus far, but Daley is especially keen on eco-conscious craft.

His hand-crocheted knitwear and one-off shirts, nearly all made in Liverpudlian factories close to where Daley grew up, may have helped tip the LVMH Prize in his favor. If nothing else, they won over Harry Styles, who inspired a bespoke cardigan style and even wore Daley's designs on the cover of his latest album.

""We had a set amount of 'Harry' cardigans in production and we sold through all of those units in the first day,"" Daley said. ""We had to call production and add more units.""

""I really want to invest [the LVMH Prize money] into expanding the team and focusing on our direct-to-consumer and wholesale models. I kinda do it all myself but I'd love to hire someone who can help with that side of the business.""

That's really the only change you can expect from S.S. Daley in the future, though, as the designer is keen on keeping his brand otherwise unchanged, even as it scales for growth.

""Winning the LVMH Prize won't stop me from working locally,"" Daley continued. ""We've been careful not to lose our roots, though maybe we can start putting in larger production [orders] with London factories. I guess that's what the Prize money will let me do: keep working locally.""

Daley roots are so core to his worldview that they were his excuse for departing the interview.

""It's all been a whirlwind, but I'd like to go speak to my family,"" he laughed. ""I haven't even told them that I've won yet."""
S.S. Daley Wins the 2022 LVMH Prize for Young Designers - WWD,"Thu, 02 Jun 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vd3dkLmNvbS9mYXNoaW9uLW5ld3MvZGVzaWduZXItbHV4dXJ5L3Mtcy1kYWxleS13aW5zLXRoZS0yMDIyLWVkaXRpb24tb2YtdGhlLWx2bWgtcHJpemUtZm9yLXlvdW5nLWRlc2lnbmVycy0xMjM1MTkzNDkwL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS — S.S. Daley won the 2022 edition of the LVMH Prize for Young Designers at a Thursday ceremony dominated by menswear designers.

British designer Steven Stokey-Daley, 25, has captured hearts and minds with his theatrical shows at London Fashion Week that view the British class system through a queer lens, gaining high-profile fans including Harry Styles, who wore his graduate collection in his “Golden” music video.

“I see it as taking these antiquated, stuffy old ideas of British heritage, that often feel exclusive to one section of Britain, and offering it new life, new breath, to pull it into a modern context from my own working-class perspective,” explained Stokey-Daley, who works with U.K.-manufactured or deadstock fabrics.

Oscar-winning actress Cate Blanchett revealed the winner at the Louis Vuitton Foundation in the presence of jury members including designers Kim Jones; Maria Grazia Chiuri; Nigo, the new artistic director of Kenzo; Silvia Venturini Fendi; Stella McCartney; Nicolas Ghesquière and Jonathan Anderson.

Rounding out the jury were senior executives Delphine Arnault, the force behind the prize and a key talent scout at luxury giant LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton; Sidney Toledano, chairman and chief executive officer of LVMH Fashion Group, and Jean-Paul Claverie, an adviser to LVMH chairman Bernard Arnault and LVMH’s head of corporate philanthropy.

“This is like an Oscar, actually, Cate, so thanks very much,” said Stokey-Daley, who was once an aspiring actor. The designer beat some 1,900 applicants to walk away with a grand prize of 300,000 euros, plus a year of coaching from experts at LVMH, parent of brands including Louis Vuitton, Dior, Fendi, Givenchy, Loewe and Kenzo.

Olympic gold medallist Eileen Gu presented the Karl Lagerfeld Special Jury Prize to joint winners ERL and Winnie New York, who both receive 150,000 euros and a year of mentoring. ERL founder Eli Russell Linnetz was considered a frontrunner among the finalists after guest designing a Dior menswear capsule collection that was unveiled in his native Venice Beach, California, last month.

Meanwhile, Nigerian-born, London-raised designer Idris Balogun impressed the judges with his menswear brand Winnie, rooted in his experience as an apprentice on London’s exclusive Savile Row, and as a senior menswear designer for Burberry and Tom Ford.

Jonathan Anderson said the jury was moved by the mettle of a group of designers emerging in the midst of a global pandemic.

“What was really nice this season was that I think everything was a result of a happening in someone’s life,” the Loewe artistic director said. “With fashion, we need to start trying to find out why we do it, so instead of looking at the product, why do we end up going there? And I think this is what was really inspiring.”

Stokey-Daley’s gender-fluid take on the uniforms of the British upper classes, such as wide-legged trousers, argyle-knit wool vests and embroidered shirts appeals to a Gen-Z sensibility, and a growing female customer base.

“A younger generation is looking at that as a norm, whereas when I started my brand, it was not a norm. But I think that shows progress to me, and I think this is what’s exciting,” said Anderson of Stokey-Daley’s gender-fluid designs. “Menswear, I think, deserves a bit of a spotlight sometimes.”

It happens that two designers strongly associated with menswear joined the jury for this year’s edition: Venturini Fendi and Nigo.

However, the artistic director of Fendi accessories and menswear also sees clothing definitions becoming more blurred. “Menswear doesn’t mean anything nowadays. Menswear appeals to women, too,” Venturini Fendi said, pointing to her own navy oversized shirt and dark pants.

Nigo said Stokey-Daley won over the group with his resourcefulness, having launched his brand during lockdown from his parents’ front room in Liverpool, England.

“I was very impressed by how he managed to develop something that seems very complete and well structured within such a short amount of time with basically no help, even to the extent of him packing the boxes to send out to shops himself,” Nigo said via an interpreter.

“The collection is very nice, really well articulated, with knitwear, sportswear, all the categories, and we think that he can do great things with his brand,” added Dior’s Chiuri.

Arnault said in addition to having a highly recognizable aesthetic, Stokey-Daley charmed the jury with his personality.

“He talked a lot about his grandmother, who is a retired seamstress. Not only did he show great courage and a strong entrepreneurial streak by launching his brand during lockdown, but he also corralled his grandmother and her friends to help sew the collection,” she said. “Nicolas [Ghesquière] said it was practically a movie.”

Stokey-Daley, who runs the brand with his boyfriend, said he looked forward to using the prize money to expand his team, even though he was apprehensive about relinquishing control. “I am very fussy, and I like to do everything myself,” he said. “I need to relent some responsibility to others. I think where we need help is the e-commerce, because it’s a massive job.”

Though the S.S. Daley brand is carried by just a dozen retailers, he’s happy to grow his wholesale network gradually.

“I’m not interested in selling to a million people and have sell-through be awful. To me, it’s really about the longevity and the full lifespan of that garment, and where that goes, and so we work really hard with our current retailers to ensure maximum sell-through,” Stokey-Daley said.

The designer credited the label’s existence to Styles and his stylist Harry Lambert.

“Harry Styles wore a shirt and a trouser in that [‘Golden’] video, and we put both of those up for preorder on our e-comm when the video came out, and so we were able to capitalize on that straightaway, which gave us the financial start to actually go and create a collection,” he said. “He’s super supportive, and he’s also super genuinely lovely as a person.”

Stokey-Daley is preparing his next show in September, which he promises will again challenge the traditional runway format. “Often it’s more of an experience than just a catwalk. I’m personally of the belief that if some people are traveling from all over the world to see a show, they should see a show-show. It’s also a great opportunity to collaborate with other creative industries,” he said.

He’s also mulling the possibility of showing overseas. “It’s something that we have to consider. I do think that as a British designer showing in London, it can sometimes feel quite a small circle, and so maybe the next thing would be to branch out and explore how we can connect to our international customer,” he mused.

Linnetz is used to pitching his ideas for music videos and stage sets to world-famous performers like Kanye West and Lady Gaga, but admitted that presenting his clothing designs to the heavyweight designers on the LVMH jury had him feeling nervous for the first time since he was a child.

“This is about how I see the world, so for me, this is much more exciting, because you’re really sharing the art that you’re creating, as opposed to creating the art for someone else,” Linnetz said.

Winning the Karl Lagerfeld Prize felt especially poignant, he said. “I feel like he’s almost such a legend, you forget how much he was a pioneer. So I feel like being compared to a pioneer like that is super exciting. It’s someone who really understood art,” he said.

While ERL already has a powerful production partner in Dover Street Market Paris, Linnetz is keen to beef up his team with some design assistants and a chief financial officer.

“A lot of the questions they asked in the interview were very business-oriented, and I think that’s really important, because everyone that’s here has so much creativity, but someone that can translate that into business is exciting and can reach more people,” he reasoned.

He’s also preparing to open his first store in Paris, though he said turnover won’t be the main driver of his future boutiques. “This first store is just going to have like one item at a time, so it’s very small, and they’re more artistic expressions. They’re not like full retail experiences,” he explained.

Balogun said his priority was to launch direct-to-consumer sales. “To be part of the winners is an amazing and humbling feeling, because I try to have a very protective feel over Winnie,” Balogun said. “We’ve just struck a deal with our factory in Italy for them to handle distribution, so this is like perfect timing.”

His presentation to the jury focused on his “farm-to-table” approach to fashion, which includes making his own fabrics, in addition to using deadstock and upcycled materials.

“I wanted them to understand this idea of our ways of approaching sustainability, this collection being one of the first that we worked with most of the fabrics from the fiber all the way down to the finished product. Like, for example, the linens in here are ones that we actually planted over a year ago, in Italy, ourselves,” he explained.

Each winner will receive credit to purchase fabrics from Nona Source, the platform that sells surplus fabrics from the LVMH fashion and leather goods brands.

The LVMH Prize is open to designers under age 40 who have presented and sold at least two collections of women’s, men’s or genderless ready-to-wear.

It has previously been awarded to Nensi Dojaka, who won the 2021 edition; Thebe Magugu; Doublet; Marine Serre; Grace Wales Bonner; Marques’ Almeida, and Thomas Tait. It has also boosted the careers of its runner-up special-prize winners, which include Rokh, Jacquemus and Hood by Air.

Three students graduating in 2022 were awarded 10,000 euros each and a one-year placement in the design studio of an LVMH brand.

Filippo Bendanti, a graduate of Università Iuav di Venezia, in Venice, Italy, will join the women’s ready to wear division at Dior; Miriam Griffiths, of Central Saint Martins in London, is headed to the women’s rtw department at Louis Vuitton, and Valeria Pasco, who graduated from Ateliers Alix in Paris, will join the Dior men’s team.

The founder of the label S.S. Daley was announced the winner early Thursday morning at the Louis Vuitton Foundation in Paris.

Presented by actress Cate Blanchett, Daley was one of eight finalists for the LVMH prize (meet them all here), and takes home the prestigious title, a year of mentorship from the luxury conglomerate’s network and a cash prize of 300,000 euros (about $356,000).

Seven artistic directors of design houses within the LVMH Group were in attendance to congratulate the winner, including Jonathan Anderson, Maria Grazia Chiuri, Nicolas Ghesquière, Kim Jones, Stella McCartney, Nigo and Silvia Venturini Fendi.

The designer expressed his excitement on Instagram captioning his post, “I can’t believe that… S.S.DALEY WON the LVMH prize (!) I’m so thrilled to have had the opportunity to introduce my world to the incredible jury of permanent inspirations.” Daley also gave a shoutout to his supporters, including journalist Sarah Mower and stylist Harry Lambert. “Thank you to everyone for their constant support; it really wouldn’t be possible without the incredible team around me,” he added.

“I am very happy that Steven Stokey Daley has won the LVMH 2022 Prize for his brand, S.S. Daley,” says Delphine Arnault, executive vice president of Louis Vuitton. “He appropriates the codes of tailoring by playing with the clichés of upper-class English culture.”

The London-based designer has garnered a cult-like following for his hand-crocheted knitwear and one-of-a-kind shirts. A Westminster School of Art graduate, his sustainably-conscious menswear designs are a fan favorite of Harry Styles — so much so he wore a piece by Daley on the cover of his latest album.

Before launching his namesake brand in 2020, Daley got his footing in menswear, working with labels Alexander McQueen and Tom Ford. He first got noticed as an independent designer from his graduate collection, where he used donated Alexander McQueen fabrics to craft the entire range.

The LVMH jury is comprised of industry experts including Jonathan Anderson, Maria Grazia Chiuri, Nicolas Ghesquière, Kim Jones, Stella McCartney, Nigo and Silvia Venturini Fendi, as well as Delphine Arnault, Jean-Paul Claverie and Sidney Toled.

The judges also awarded Eli Russell Linnetz of ERL and Idris Balogun of Winnie New York the Karl Lagerfeld Special Jury Prize, which was presented by Olympic gold medallist Eileen Gu. Both designers take home 150,000 euros (about $161,000) and a year of mentoring."
LVMH Luxury Ventures Takes Stake in Lab-Grown Diamond Company Lusix - JCK,"Thu, 16 Jun 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmpja29ubGluZS5jb20vZWRpdG9yaWFsLWFydGljbGUvbHZtaC1sdXh1cnktdmVudHVyZXMtbHVzaXgv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LVMH Luxury Ventures, the conglomerate’s investment arm, has taken a stake in Lusix, the lab-grown diamond company headed and owned by Israeli billionaire Benny Landa.

LVMH Luxury Ventures was the “most prominent,” though not necessarily the largest, investor in a $90 million funding round, Landa said during a press conference at the JCK Las Vegas show.

Two Israeli funds, Ragnar Crossover Fund and More Investments, also participated.

LVMH-owned watch brand TAG Heuer has used Lusix diamonds to create a limited-edition watch.

Landa declined to discuss whether any other LVMH brands will use its lab-grown diamonds in the future, or if TAG Heuer will produce other watches with lab-grown diamonds.

“I cannot speak on behalf of LVMH,” he said. “Clearly, they have made a financial investment. But I would ask myself, ‘Why would a luxury brand make a financial investment?’ There’s obviously very good reasons.”

Executives at LVMH Luxury Ventures and LVMH’s press contacts did not return requests for comment. The LinkedIn profile of LVMH Luxury Ventures CEO, Julie Bercovy—who is now a Lusix board member—said, “The companies in which LVMH Luxury Ventures invests will be managed independently in order to reinforce their entrepreneurial spirit and are not intended to be acquired by the LVMH Group.”

Other businesses LVMH Luxury Ventures has invested in include watch publication and e-tailer Hodinkee and fashion brands Gabriela Hearst and Aimé Leon Dore.

Lusix also unveiled a new tagline for its diamonds: “sun-grown,” as it uses solar power to create its diamonds.

“Some companies say, ‘well, we use solar power,’ ” Landa said. “They put a few panels on their roof.… Growing diamonds is a very energy-intensive process. It takes a lot of power. And so you need to have a massive investment in solar farms. [W]e have a 30-megawatt solar farm that powers our factory, which produces more power than we consume.”

He said his company is able to grow pyramid-size diamonds—maximizing weight retention—as well as customizable shapes.

“We are the cutting-edge in this industry,” he said. “I don’t want to sound arrogant, but we think that the gap between us and the next nearest player is going to be significant.”

He noted that one-third of Lusix’s employees work in research and development.

“We have the world’s most advanced, fully automated, fully computerized, operation,” he said. “Our technology is 100% developed at home. We have developed our own reactors, we build our own reactors, we don’t provide them to anybody else. We are completely vertically integrated, from the theoretical modeling that we do to the research and development to growing the diamonds.”

Despite its sunshiny new tagline, Lusix isn’t planning any consumer outreach.

“We sell to retailers and to wholesalers. But our objective is for consumers to identify Lusix as being the standard for sustainable, high-quality diamonds. Just as Intel does not produce computers, but every quality computer says ‘Intel Inside.’… We want the ultimate consumers to say ‘I want jewelry with a Lusix diamond.’ ”

Getting that message across will be a “process,” Landa said.

I attended the USC School of Cinematic Arts where I received a B.F.A. in Screenwriting. To pay for my tuition, I applied for a job in the opera department’s costume shop. It was there here my passion for theatrics and costume design began to grow. After I graduated, I mainly worked writing screenplays – but soon felt my imagination was greater than sitting alone in a room by myself writing. I had more to express and began making short films. My work making short films soon led to directing my first music video – which happened to be for Kanye West.

Your background is already quite impressive - video clips for Kanye West, scenography for Lady Gaga, production for Teyana Taylor and Kid Cudi or campaigns for Yeezy et Skim - what did you learn working with those artists?

I learned about iconography – using narrative design to have impact – storytelling – how and when to break the rules – how to translate ideas into art into products.

Eventually, you launched your own brand, how did this happen? Was it something you had in mind for a long time?

Working on multiple stage tours with various artists reignited my interest in theatrical costume design. My work in the music industry led to many opportunities in the fashion world – translating my passion for storytelling into photography, fashion films, campaigns, and editorials. Eventually the world of fashion became of greater interest to me than the music industry. While directing a fragrance campaign for Comme des Garçons, I met Adrian Joffe. After sharing my greater fashion aspirations with Adrian, I soon partnered with him and Rei Kawakubo to start ERL. I presented my first full collection in 2020."
Why LVMH Is Betting on Lab-Grown Diamonds - The Business of Fashion,"Fri, 17 Jun 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzb2ZmYXNoaW9uLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy9zdXN0YWluYWJpbGl0eS93aHktbHZtaHMtdmVudHVyZS1mdW5kLWlzLWJldHRpbmctb24tbGFiLWdyb3duLWRpYW1vbmRzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"For years, the mining giants that control the global diamond trade have waged a marketing war against the rise of lab-grown diamonds, supported by the luxury jewellery sector.

Polished campaigns have aimed to frame the traditional diamond industry in a positive light, while executives have dismissed synthetic stones as lower-end baubles.

“Lab-grown diamonds don’t have any [history],” Cartier chief executive Cyrille Vigneron said in an interview published in The State of Fashion: Watches and Jewellery report published last year. “They’ve lost their singularity and lost the fact that they were made by the Earth millions of years ago.”

But natural diamonds come with messy environmental and ethical baggage that is increasingly at odds with the values shaping the shopping habits of young consumers. In contrast, lab-grown diamond purveyors have sought to portray themselves as a modern, tech-backed and sustainable alternative.

It’s a microcosm of a broader debate playing out across the industry as sustainability becomes a materials battleground and innovations claiming to have a lower environmental impact and more ethical supply chains pose disruptive threats to conventional players.

Now luxury’s biggest company, LVMH, is taking a bet on cultivated stones. The group’s venture arm, LVMH Luxury Ventures, has taken an undisclosed stake in Israeli lab-grown diamond start-up Lusix as part of a $90 million funding round.

While luxury jewellers like Tiffany, which LVMH acquired last year, remain aloof from cultivated stones, the move is the latest sign that changing consumer attitudes and values are shifting what can constitutes luxury in the modern era.

Lab-grown diamonds are cultivated by either subjecting a “seed” of a diamond to extreme pressure and heat or through a newer, low-pressure process where carbon atoms are grown inside a gas chamber. The process takes a matter of weeks and the results are chemically identical to diamonds mined from the ground.

While significant amounts of energy are required to run these processes, lab-grown diamonds skirt the taint of human rights abuses and conflict financing that continue to plague the natural diamond industry. Lusix says it only uses solar power, describing its stones as “sun grown.”

The disruptive forces created by changing consumer tastes and new technologies are already apparent in other parts of the industry; large luxury labels have dropped fur in rapid succession over the last five years, with Kering chief executive François-Henri Pinault stating baldly that “some materials have no place in luxury.”

Meanwhile, new business models like resale that were initially aggressively rejected by big luxury players are now talked about as strategic additions that can support ambitions to reduce waste and create pathways to continue growing revenue and profits without increasing environmental impact.

Diamonds are perhaps luxury’s most culturally evocative touchpoint. Their shine has been burnished by a mix of carefully controlled supply and generations of powerful advertising campaigns that have bolstered their position as glittering symbols of status and love. But the trade is ripe for disruption.

Last year, Pandora, the world’s largest jewellery maker, said it would stop using mined diamonds altogether as part of a broader strategy to address unethical production methods for its raw materials. And while lab-grown stones remain a small fraction of the overall market, awareness and demand is continuing to grow, experts say. Their lower price point has meant the stones have been pitched as more of a mass fashion product, but luxury could lean into a different narrative.

LVMH Luxury Ventures’ investment in lab-grown diamonds comes against a broader backdrop of disruption. Prices of rough diamonds in some parts of the market have surged this year in response to stringent sanctions against Russian state-backed miner Alrosa. The company accounts for about a third of global diamond production, rivalling De Beers in its market significance.

And while most luxury jewellers continue to focus their efforts to tap into mounting demand for ethical and sustainably sourced stones on building transparency and traceability into their supply chains for mined diamonds, lab-grown stones are making inroads.

Last year, former Harry Winston chief executive Frédéric de Narp and longtime Cartier executive Coralie de Fontenay teamed up to form investment fund Luximpact, with the aim to reboot legacy jewellery brands using only lab-grown and non-virgin materials.

Net-a-Porter has introduced its first lab-grown diamond brand, onboarding fine jewellery brand Kimaï. Earlier in the year, LVMH-owned Tag Heuer tested the water for lab-grown diamonds with a limited edition watch studded with Lusix diamonds that retailed at the extremely luxury price of around $375,000.

“It’s a new material that was taboo a year ago, and it’s not a taboo any more,” de Narp said. “It is just the future; this is an evolution.”

Among the eight finalists of this ninth edition is the Japanese designer Ryunosuke Okazaki, who creates silhouettes that look like sculptures imprinted in spirituality.

What is your first memory about fashion? I have always loved drawing and making things. Since I loved the arts, it was natural for me to become interested in fashion. After that, I became more and more involved in fashion. I still cherish the first piece of vintage clothing I bought when I was 15 years old. Which fashion designers (living or dead) inspire you and why? One designer I admire is Rei Kawakubo. I am always amazed by her creations. I remember being shocked when I first got to know her. I really respect her for her constant pursuit of newness and expression throughout the long history of her brand.

You were born in Hiroshima, a city with a very particular history, how growing up there has influenced your approach to art and fashion? Being born and raised in Hiroshima, I have a strong awareness of peace. My grandmother was exposed to radiation when she was 7 years old, and I am a third generation radiation survivor. I believe that art and fashion also have an important message. I live my life thinking about the connection between people, from prayers for peace to the connection between people and the earth. I will continue to create to deliver that message to the world through my artwork. When have you decided to become a fashion designer? Did you know when you started studying art that it was to become a fashion designer? From the very beginning, I wanted to create works in the expressive field of fashion. For this reason, I decided to first study art in order to expand my own expressive ability and the possibilities for making clothes. For me, the most important thing in expressing myself through clothes-making is the pursuit of new possibilities. I thought it was more important to continue to look at the world of expression more broadly than to simply learn about making clothes. How did you know launching your brand just after graduation was the good timing? I have been creating pieces since I was in school and was able to hold my brand's first runway show in September 2021 as a venue to showcase my work. I am always looking for a place to present my work since I have always been creating my artwork with my own hands. I have been creating artwork for a long time, so the timing of the show right after graduation was very natural. Now that I think about it, it was good timing to have a runway show right after graduation. What was the inspiration for your first collection? My theme has always been ""prayer“. From prayers for peace, to prayers for life, and deeper down, I have arrived at the Japanese prayer for nature. I am inspired by the forms and decorations that have emerged from the ancient history of prayer in Japan, such as Jomon pottery and Shintoism, and when people wear them, they become a completed form of prayer."

Among the eight finalists of this ninth edition is the Irish designer Róisín Pierce, whose all-white collections turn lace and embroidery into wearable radical and romantic sculptures.

Róisín Pierce

NUMÉRO : What is your first memory about fashion? RÓISÍN PIERCE : I cannot pinpoint my first memory exactly, but my mother was always creating around me so my introduction to clothing making would have been quite young. I remember just knowing making clothes was what I wanted to do from a young age. I’d say it was in my early teens when I had this big urge to learn all I could about construction. I learned about it from almost every source I could, from patterns books, taking some garments apart and going to pattern design classes in local schools. Why did you decide to become a fashion designer? Because I felt I had something new to say and a unique design point of view. I wouldn’t have started my brand if I didn't feel I had it in me to continually design something new with each season. It’s funny because although the pieces are designed in all-white, each piece is constructed very differently; it has a thought process. A piece is not just created to sell, but created to do something new. It’s a commitment to contemporise craft while honouring its roots. Which designers (living or not) inspired you and why? I love the brand and designer Issey Miyake. His approach transcends generations, formed around a desire to empower women and transform luxury. His pleats provide ease and wearability, beautiful pieces which do not crease or become damaged from packing and travelling. His brands and sub-brands encompass different aims and undertake different surface explorations, achieving recognition and admiration within and outside of the industry. Not only are his textures commercialised and accessible, but Miyake also cares deeply about artisanal tradition, for instance, preserving the practice of washi paper bonding. He represents a meaningful, considered, and innovative approach to design, which is also reflected in my brand. Like Miyake, I’m also interested in preserving craft.

What is your professional background? My professional background is in textile design and design development, working for luxury womenswear. Before that, I studied textile design, which was quite a free and explorative course. I think the combination of the two is evident in my collections as they’re textile-based and explorative, yet occupy a luxury space due to the craftsmanship and artisanal techniques. Where does your interest in Irish lace and European craftsmanship come from ? Well I have a strong interest in my home country’s textiles. From the craft itself to the history and its cultural significance, it’s all deeply interesting and I feel a connection to it. I want to renew the skills and crafts within a sustainable practice that will be appreciated by a new generation so it lives on. Traditions and craft have been handed down to us for centuries across textiles, design and embroidery. These skills, however, and the intrinsic value they create, are waning – I want to help put the importance of preserving these skills on a global stage while also being able to interpret and develop them in modern ways. One of my favourite crafts is Clones Irish Lace which soared during the famine, as it didn’t require much in the way of materials or tools and. Many lace schools were set up so that people could earn funds for their families. These beautiful pieces were born out of such sadness. This seems to be a recurring theme with Aran knits and other clothing and textiles that were produced at the Irish workhouses for women known as the Laundries. These beautiful things were often made from the painful history of Ireland's past - it’s like wearing a little piece of our history and remembering how far we have come. Furthermore, what is interesting about exploring this dedication to tradition within Irish crafts is the connection between artisanal skills and the role of women’s work, which often symbolised far more politically- and religiously- charged realities. The legacy of Irish lace is a dichotomy. It remains a symbol of female oppression because women interned in the Magdalene Laundries were forced to participate in its manufacture, however it also represents freedom and empowerment, as Clones Lace helped families escape poverty and famine. The history is almost an emotion to me.

How did you know it was the right time to launch your own brand? Why did you want to express through it? After working for other brands, I felt there wasn't enough focus on creativity, or design development which I found quite frustrating. A brand shouldn’t exist just to sell last season's dress in a new colour. My brand was born from a desire to explore and create the new. What really excites me and drives my work is this possibility of touching new, unexplored ground. Irish traditions and the historical significance of Irish crafts and its impact on the country as a whole is something that fascinates me. I have a burning desire to explore. This is why I really like to have quite a lot of variation within each design, allowing space for showcasing a new method of creation and the possibilities of textile manipulation. My collections are very much process-led, letting my fabric manipulations guide and inform the final piece. I never really know what I’m going to create, it's like stepping into the unknown each time. Through this approach, I am able to employ different processes, resulting in design that changes while still feeling part of an overarching narrative. My brand is dedicated to innovating textiles through sustainable methods, combining hand and machine work with zero-waste sensibilities. This dedication is borne from a desire to preserve traditional textile techniques while subsequently exploring new innovations. I want to share joy with the collections, with the new textures and sweet hats. I felt it was clothing I had been searching for. In 2019, you won the first Chanel Métiers d’art prize at the Hyères festival, what did you learn from this partnership? It was such a valuable insight into how other houses create couture. It was very insightful to learn about many of the Métiers' areas of expertise, and being shown some of their handcrafted methods and techniques was amazing. As I have spoken about before, my work is about a slower practice, and an artisanal approach, so to see how it has been done and continues to be done traditionally was wonderful. It was also great to see how each of the three Métiers I worked with went about working on my designs, how they go about creation and see how design is structured in these couture houses and how each step of the process is delegated to each individual. The partnership also showed the importance of craft and provenance. I have a great appreciation and admiration for houses which invest in craft, uphold the tradition, and keep production in Paris. It’s oh so very rare and a perspective mirrored within my own work and process."
Last Mile Delivery Start-Up Wins LVMH Innovation Prize - The Business of Fashion,"Thu, 16 Jun 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzb2ZmYXNoaW9uLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy9sdXh1cnkvbGFzdC1taWxlLWRlbGl2ZXJ5LXN0YXJ0LXVwLXdpbnMtbHZtaC1pbm5vdmF0aW9uLXByaXplL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Toshi, the London-based last-mile delivery start-up founded by fashion entrepreneur Sojin Lee, won LVMH’s 2022 Innovation Awards Grand Prize Thursday.

Lee, who was a founding team member at Net-a-Porter, created Toshi in 2017 with an eye to revamping the e-commerce delivery experience in line with luxury’s codes.

As a white-label service plugged into brands’ e-commerce sites, Toshi allows customers to sign up for a specific delivery window as well as having their orders fulfilled by salaried couriers who are trained like store associates.

As retailers ramp up their focus on offering omnichannel services to clients, Toshi hopes to help luxury brands extend the store experience to online. Its couriers are trained to assist and advise shoppers, as well as in having the “emotional intelligence” to read cues for how to behave in clients’ homes, Lee said.

Toshi can tap into brands’ store inventories to fulfil orders, as well as mobilising brands’ traditional e-commerce inventories. The company routs shipments from logistics centres through an ultra-local network of small warehouses not unlike those used by grocery start-ups like Getir, Lee said.

LVMH’s lauded Toshi for bringing “elevated and humanised standards to the delivery of luxury goods.”

As a result of the prize, the company will receive six-months of support and mentoring from the industry’s biggest conglomerate.

The service is already being adopted by the industry’s top names: Toshi has worked with privately-held giant Chanel on store-to-door deliveries in London for over two years, where it more recently went live with LVMH brands including Dior Couture, Celine, Rimowa, and Berluti.

In New York, the company is preparing to add Tiffany and Dior Couture to its list of brands. An expansion to Los Angeles is being plotted for early next year, Lee said.

Luxury and beauty companies want to enter the metaverse. How are brands like Moët and Christian Dior positioning themselves for a virtual future?

Luxury, beauty, fashion. What would a metaverse be without high-priced consumer goods? That's precisely what industry giants like L'Oréal and LVMH must have thought, and they're already gearing their brands to the three-dimensional Internet of the future. Will you soon be able to sip digital Moët while carrying the hottest Louis Vuitton bags through Horizon Worlds?

Beauty in the Metaverse: Here's how to make the transition from 2D to 3D

For L'Oréal, the YSL, Mugler and NYX Professional Makeup brands are particularly important to its Metaverse plans. The group recently unveiled a digital wallet for which up to 10,000 free L'Oréal NFTs can be requested. Over the course of the year, customers will use them to unlock access to digital and real-life events, experiences or products.

With the Wallet campaign, L'Oréal wants to introduce customers to its Metaverse activities. Asmita Dubey, Chief Digital and Marketing Officer at L'Oréal, explains, “We want to lay down the foundations and understand what beauty will look like there and rooting the brand DNA there. We’re looking at it through the prism of community.”

L'Oréal seeks partners for virtual future

“We’re thinking about immersive experiences. We know that we will go from 2D to 3D beauty, so what does that look like? And from there we’re looking at virtual influence, avatars, products and collectibles. We’re exploring all of that to understand the new visual codes, the new ways people see beauty,” Dubey said.

In addition, partnerships with companies and individuals that have not been on L'Oréal's radar are important. There is a diverse, new ecosystem of partners that L'Oréal needs to work with, according to Dubey.

3D artists create new form of digital beauty

""We’re partnering with Ariani – a rising platform in web3 – and companies in the world of crypto. We need to partner with a very new ecosystem,"" Dubey explains.

Dubey said there are many 3D artists working on digital beauty and makeup art. ""That’s where we’re starting. It means the brand will engage with more 3D artists, animators and even software engineers. We will start working with blockchain experts,"" L'Oréal's digital chief said.

Back in 2018, L'Oréal invested in AR apps, acquiring startup Modiface. The AR specialists develop augmented reality applications that allow users to project new hairstyles onto their heads or makeup onto their faces. Two years earlier, L'Oréal began educating hairdressers with the VR headset.

LVMH brings Luis Vuitton and Christian Dior to the Metaverse

LVMH, the group behind luxury brands such as Luis Vuitton, Christian Dior and the Moët & Chandon winery, is also positioning itself to enter the virtual world. Nelly Mensah, LVMH's Metaverse and crypto chief, sees the future of the Internet as a serious source of revenue.

""We’re really thinking about four use cases primarily. One is client storytelling and immersive brand experiences. It’s about transparency, traceability and tracking for authenticity,"" Mensah explains.

Digital twins and an expansion of the product range in the virtual world are also on the agenda, she says. They are intended to enable personalization and self-expression. The company also plans to accept cryptocurrencies for payments.

Bulgari: Current metaverses not high-end enough for luxury brands

LVMH jewelry brand Bulgari plans to build its own Metaverse with Italian advertising agency Experiency, which specializes in technology and ""metaverse commerce.""

""The metaverses today don’t have high enough quality to support the positioning of a luxury brand. So what we’re doing is creating our own proprietary metaverse. It’s a concept. We’re creating a learning curve, designing spaces. It’s another kind of creativity,"" explains Massimo Paloni, Bulgari's chief operations and innovation officer.

He wants to prepare the culture and processes in the company for the metaverse era: ""When the future opens up, we will be ready.""

An important task during this preparation is the creation of 3D versions of the entire portfolio. Making diamonds look realistic in a 3D world is a difficult process: according to Paloni, Experiency needs between a week and a month to create a single virtual piece of jewelry.

Abloh was in the habit of meeting with young designers and creatives of colour every six weeks for advice and mentorship, and his support of young Black emerging designers was an essential part of his creative practice. “LVMH is committed to having a positive impact in our communities and realising the path forward set by Virgil Abloh and others who helped foster equity and inclusion in the fashion industry by supporting and building a pool of diverse creative talent,” said Corey Smith, vice president of diversity and inclusion at LVMH.

In a panel hosted by Harlem’s Fashion Row founder Brandice Daniel and LVMH, the two revealed the new initiatives that the organisations will take to pave the way for emerging young talents of colour in the industry, chief among them, a three-year mentorship program between Tiffany & Co. and HBCUs in the United States, as well as mentorship programs between Louis Vuitton executives and emerging designers at Harlem’s Fashion Row."
"Wine, spirits division of luxury goods giant LVMH scoops up iconic Joseph Phelps Vineyard - The Santa Rosa Press Democrat","Wed, 29 Jun 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnByZXNzZGVtb2NyYXQuY29tL2FydGljbGUvbGlmZXN0eWxlL3dpbmUtc3Bpcml0cy1kaXZpc2lvbi1vZi1sdXh1cnktZ29vZHMtZ2lhbnQtbHZtaC1zY29vcHMtdXAtaWNvbmljLWpvc2VwaC1wL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Moet Hennessy, the wine and spirits division of luxury goods leader LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SA, has acquired Joseph Phelps Vineyards, an iconic Napa winery with holdings in Sonoma County.

Founded in 1973 by Napa wine pioneer Joseph Phelps, the winery is recognized for producing California’s first proprietary Bordeaux-style blend known as Insignia, as well as one of the first single varietal syrahs. Today, the winery produces about 60,000 cases of wine per year from its 500-acre vineyards in Napa Valley and along the Sonoma Coast. Insignia remains its flagship Bordeaux-style blend and can fetch upwards of $300 per bottle, depending on the vintage.

Moet Hennessy’s wine and spirits portfolio features three additional Napa wineries, including Domaine Chandon, Newton Vineyard and Colgin Cellars, as well as Champagne producers Dom Perignon and Moet Chandon, Hennessy Cognac, Belvedere Vodka and more.

“We are delighted and very proud to welcome Joseph Phelps Vineyards to our portfolio of luxury wine and spirits,” said Philippe Schaus, chairman and CEO of Moet Hennessy, in a statement. “Joseph Phelps has been to the Napa Valley what Nicolas Ruinart, Joseph Krug and Claude Moet were to the Champagne region, and likewise we will continue to develop this new House in the respect of the founder’s heritage and vision.”

A former construction engineer from Colorado, Joseph Phelps arrived in the Bay Area in the mid 1960s, initially winning a bid to build Souverain Winery (now Rutherford Hill) in St. Helena, before making a leap into the wine industry.

In 1973, he purchased a 600-acre cattle ranch in St. Helena where he planted 100 acres of grapevines with Walter Schug, who he’d hired as his winemaker. That year, he released his first cabernet sauvignon as well as a riesling, before going on to produce Insignia in 1974, which is now recognized as one of Napa’s most beloved red wines.

Over the next 30 years, Phelps would become widely recognized as a Napa wine pioneer for his Insignia, Rhone-style reds and coastal pinot noir and chardonnay.

“Joseph Phelps Vineyards has been a producer of iconic wines for nearly 50 years,” the Phelps family said in a statement. “During that time, and as we plan for the next 50 years, our family’s guiding principle has always been to honor and build on this legacy.

“We believe that passing the care of this crown jewel of the Napa Valley and Sonoma Coast to LVMH, a world-renowned leader in the luxury wines and spirits market, will enable us to do just that.”

Napa winemaker Robert Mondavi said Phelps was “a forerunner of coming in with Syrah, the real Syrah, from the Rhone. And people realized that he’s someone who has a vision; he helped stimulate us to go in the same direction.”

Phelps went on to acquire additional vineyards throughout Napa in the Rutherford, Oakville, Stags Leap District and Oak Knoll District American Viticultural Areas.

Inspired by Burgundian-style pinot noir and chardonnay, in the late 1990s and early 2000s Phelps expanded into Sonoma County, planting two vineyards just 8 miles from the Sonoma Coast near Freestone. This practice was nearly unheard of at the time, yet Phelps embraced the influence the cool, coastal vineyards would have on his wines.

This week marked the beginning “a new chapter” for Napa Valley’s Joseph Phelps Vineyards, the Phelps family said, following the sale of the estate to LVMH.

For almost five decades, the winery, with vineyards in Napa Valley and West Sonoma Coast, has been operating under the stewardship of the Phelps family. 1974 marked the first vintage of Joseph Phelps Vineyard’s flagship wine Insignia, a Cabernet Sauvignon-forward blend.

Founder Joseph Phelps died in 2015, and in 2020 his private cellar of more than 5,000 bottles was put up for sale. In 2005, Phelps’ son, Bill, took over as chairman of the winery. In 2021, Joe Phelps’ granddaughter Elizabeth Phelps Neuman was named senior director of marketing and business development and Bill’s son, Will, became director of vineyard operations.

A statement from the Phelps family said: “As the trusted steward of historic wineries such as Dom Pérignon, Chateau d’Yquem, and Chateau Cheval Blanc, among others, LVMH is uniquely situated to shepherd Joseph Phelps Vineyards into the future, while staying loyal to the founding roots that make our brand synonymous with best-in-class California winemaking.”

The statement concluded: “It has been an honour for generations of our family to build and care for Joseph Phelps Vineyards over the past five decades. Joe’s [Phelps] passion first began with French wines, and we believe that he would be incredibly proud that LVMH will join his family in the guardianship of his vision for Joseph Phelps Vineyards.”

Moët Hennessy CEO Philippe Schaus told CNBC: “It’s important for us that we are acquiring a family business with a legacy and heritage. It’s super important that we keep that heritage.” Schaus has vowed to “continue the wonderful journey initiated by the founder 50 years ago and pursued by his heirs today.”

The cost of the deal has not been disclosed. It is understood that Will Phelps, Elizabeth Phelps Neuman and the winemakers (Ashley Hepworth in Napa and Justin Ennis in West Sonoma Coast) will be retained under the new ownership.

Earlier this year, Joseph Phelps Vineyards was named as one the 51 wineries on the California List."

Among the eight finalists of this year’s edition Among the eight finalists of this ninth edition is the designer Idris Balogun, founder of the label Winnie NYC, who offers collections with extraordinary precision, radical lines, and multicultural influences, from New York streetwear to Nigerian craft.

Idris Balogun

Numéro : What was your first memory about fashion? Idris Balogun : My first conscious memory of fashion, was sitting in my father's closet and looking at the fabrics and being so enthralled by how his whole identity existed in this small space where I sat, the way he was perceived by others sat on racks in a dark room, and I sat there and took it all in. Which designers inspire you as a child and today? When I was younger, Ozwald Boateng inspired me because he was from where I was from yet his life looked almostfairytale like. As I got older, I learned more about design and designers, today I have many inspirations including Haider Ackermann, Dries Van Noten, Christopher Bailey and of course Mr. Ford. As a child, you used to skip football to work for a tailor shop in Savile Row. How did you start ad why so young? What did you learn from this experience? I don't think at the time I was conscious of my age, all I thought about was the feeling, the idea of being a tailor at the time seemed so romanticized for me, to be able to build garments with bare hands from nothing seemed to me a kind of magic. I still think that my experience on ""The Row"" was such a special one and one that I am extremely grateful for, it taught me the importance of purity, and integrity as well as attention to detail.

Winnie NYC, fall-winter 2022

At 21, after a short time at the Fashion Institute of Technology, you were hired at Burberry by Christopher Bailey, whom you had already met at Savile Row, what did you learn from him? I think with Christopher Bailey, I learned to treat design almost like poetry, he had such a way about what inspired him, at the time I knew more about pattern drafting and cutting or hand sewing than I did about design and creative direction, naturally I was always learning and being inspired by his leadership. A year later, in 2017, following the departure of Christopher Bailey, you left for Tom Ford. Was it different? why? what did you learn form him as well? It was such an experience working with Tom Ford, particularly because it is not a house with much internal visibility, it was a small team which was different for me coming from Burberry, but I think Tom Ford really honed what my idea of luxury was and being from Savile Row where design is under a microscope, to see the same attention to detail be given to ready to wear was beautiful. You also said in one of your interviews to have become a “cultural clone” of Tom Ford, what did you mean? Why did you leave the house in 2018 to launch your own brand? Yes, I remember this quote, I was speaking on the mindset I was in while I was working with Mr. Ford. I think his direction is so sensual and luxurious, it is a very tempting lifestyle and I found myself almost trying to clone that mindset for myself while at the house, I felt at the time it made me a better designer under his direction. In 2019, Winnie New York was born, what does this name mean? The brand was birthed after the passing of my grandmother, and so I decided to create something as an ode to her memory. For the fall-winter 2021 collection, a year after your first steps at Paris fashion week, you collaborated with Canadian artist Tau Lewis known for her upcycled installations. Could to tell me about your collaboration? How do you view the ecological and sustainable commitment in the production of your pieces? It was an honor to collaborate with someone so talented, I have been a fan of her work for a while and so to get the opportunity to work with her on a collection was amazing. It was where my calling to create in a more sustainable way was formed, I was inspired by the sculptures she creates, and I have tried to sew that into the Winnie DNA as well as the collaboration with Artists. For example this season we will be collaborating with the artist Alida Rodrigues whose works are inspired by self-identity and are beautiful.

LVMH Gets Beverly Hills Planning Approval for Cheval Blanc Hotel on Rodeo Drive - The Real Deal,"Tue, 14 Jun 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vdGhlcmVhbGRlYWwuY29tL2xhLzIwMjIvMDYvMTQvbHZtaC1nZXRzLWdvLWFoZWFkLWZvci1ob3RlbC1vbi1yb2Rlby1kcml2ZS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Rodeo Drive is a step closer to getting another LVMH brand — but it’s not a luxury store this time.

The Beverly Hills Planning Commission unanimously approved the French conglomerate’s plans to build a 115-key Cheval Blanc hotel on the corner of Rodeo Drive and South Santa Monica Boulevard, according to a commission meeting on Monday night.

The city council will now vote on the project, a formal tally that’s typically seen as a matter of procedure after an approval from planners.

LVMH bought the building at 468 Rodeo Drive––formerly occupied by Brooks Brothers––for $245 million in 2018, public property records show. Two years later, the luxury retailer filed plans with the city to develop the hotel.

Under current plans, the nine-story hotel will also include a wellness center, spa, conference room, restaurants and about 25,000 square feet of street-level retail space.

The city’s approval came two months after a number of other luxury retailers voiced objections to the plans, prompting LVMH to ask the planning commission to halt its review of the project.

Hermès, Giorgio Armani and Chanel were among the retailers with concerns that the hotel would block a shared alley used by their stores to serve VIP clients. The high-end retailers also argued construction of the project would disrupt their own operations and asked for assurances they would be compensated for any interruptions or damage, according to planning documents.

Most of the retailers’ grievances were addressed by the end of May.

The Cheval Blanc isn’t LVMH’s only property on the famed luxury street. In December, the company bought the former 86-room Luxe hotel on Rodeo Drive for $200 million, though it’s unclear what the retailer plans to do with that property."
VivaTech 2022: Luxury group LVMH and beauty giant L'Oréal on embracing metaverse and new tech - Yahoo Movies UK,"Sat, 18 Jun 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vdWsubW92aWVzLnlhaG9vLmNvbS92aXZhdGVjaC0yMDIyLWx1eHVyeS1ncm91cC1sdm1oLTA2MDAyMjM4My5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Paris has been infiltrated by the tech elite this week as the VivaTech conference gets into full swing. But the occasion also affords the capital of fashion to showcase how it will incorporate tech and Web3.

Euronews Next spoke to LVMH, the home of luxury brands such as Louis Vuitton and Dior, and to beauty leader L'Oréal, to find out the latest innovations of France’s biggest luxury and beauty companies.

One of the most talked-about products and possibly one of the most expensive too is the Bvlgari Octo Finissimo Ultra, the world’s thinnest mechanical watch with a profile of 1.80 mm thick and at a cost of €250,000.

Not only is it designed to look good on your wrist, but the watch also has integrated NFT technology that provides digital proof of ownership.

The owner of the timepiece, of which only 10 have been made, can scan a QR code which then takes them to the NFT system where they can view the history of the watch, including design sketches.

“You can always say that you are actually connected with the moment of creation of the watch,” said Massimo Paloni, Chief Operations and Innovation Officer at Bvlgari.

“The QR code actually is different for each watch and because every QR code is different, every product is different. We wanted to actually create an experience for the customer.

“So when you scan the QR code, in reality, you enter into a mini-website and that mini-website gives you all the story, all the journey of our creators,” he said.

“You have the passport, the digital passport of the watch on the blockchain. You have the artwork minted on a polygon blockchain. And these two smart contents then are merged into a third smart contract that cannot be separated. So there is a flotation system by which the customer will never be able to separate. And this means that these NFTs will never be on the market”.

Story continues

NFTs: the one to watch

LVMH has made other NFT watches with its brand Tag Heuer, which lets you display your NFT on the watch.

The company also allows you to buy the watch with cryptocurrency.

Finally, the metaverse plays a big role in the future plans of LVMH, which has a virtual shopping world for Sephora where you can try out bold make-up choices.

I might not be bold enough to wear orange lipstick, and so I would never think to try it on in the real world, but in the metaverse it's very frictionless

“Sephora was one of the very first brands to offer a virtual try-on for makeup with augmented reality and I think there's a couple of learnings here. So first of all, nothing will ever replace interacting with a physical product and especially with beauty and skincare. You want to know how it smells, what it feels like,” Nelly Mensah, head of Web3 and Metaverse at LVMH, told Euronews Next.

“But what the metaverse offers is inspiration. So, for example, I might not be bold enough to wear orange lipstick, and so I would never think to try it on in the real world, because I think, well, maybe that's not for me, but in the metaverse it's very frictionless to actually go through hundreds of colours really quickly.

“So imagine you are swiping through orange, purple, pink, and then you realise, wait, actually orange is a great look for me. And so then you either order it online or go into the store, have a conversation with a beauty advisor, and then buy the physical product. So I think those two go hand in hand”.

While doing your shopping in the metaverse, you could also own a Louis Vuitton handbag as an NFT. The real thing of course may be too expensive for most budgets.

Asked why you would want a digital-only version of the bag, Mensah said LVMH sees the future of luxury in the metaverse as a combination of the physical piece and the digital.

“We think that a consumer who spends a lot of their time in digital spaces will want to show off what they own in the real world. So if you own a physical retail handbag, you will then have a digital version of it,” she said.

“It's a digital twin that will give you even further benefits in the metaverse, or, for example, early access to a product or access to a metaverse environment that you can only enter if you have this digital product.

“And the way you have the digital product is you buy the physical one. So this combination of digital and physical is what we think will be the future of the space”.

The beauty of the metaverse

The beauty giant L'Oréal is also entering the metaverse.

At the start of June, its cosmetics subsidiary NYX announced it was partnering with The Sandbox metaverse and the blockchain lab People of Crypto.

The partnership will see an avatar collection which features different skin shades, gender identification, sexual orientation and different make-up looks.

“We know that the world is changing where people are going to want to experience products in the metaverse. So we have to think about what that's going to mean for a company and if we're doing it collectively with the digital teams as well as our team in research, and then we will see how we can create value and change people's behaviour and that that's always the most challenging part,” Guive Balooch, Global Vice President of L'Oréal’s Technology Incubator, said in an interview.

“And I think our approach the last 10 years [...] has helped us to understand that we have to really focus first on consumer needs and expectations”.

In its bright white stand, L'Oréal also showcased other tech-beauty innovations.

On Yves Saint Laurent’s scent booth, you could find the perfect perfume to match your mood.

It works by an ECG-based headset, created with the neurotech company EMOTIV, that tracks emotional responses to different scents and then analyses that data to make different product recommendations.

“When you look at fragrance today, there are some basic emotions that you're looking at - stress, energy, concentration. And today this kind of field of neurotechnology has been around for 50 years. So it's not something that just came out of the blue,” said Balooch.

“I think that, yes, this part is advancing. We are at 95 per cent. We're not at 100 per cent. So there will be some people that will have to do the experience a couple of times or may not get there right.

“But we will continue to inform with the data and try to get to a point where we can get it to be as close as we can to 100. I think beyond that, there's something else that I have to tell you, is that it's not a miracle device in that sense,” he added

“Some people like fragrances that make them relaxed. Some people like to be energised by fragrances. That's not something the headset can measure. This is why at the beginning, there still is a need for human intervention. We have to understand first what consumers want out of their fragrance”.

The beauty of sustainability

One of the more sustainable inventions is the company’s Water Saver.

It is a showerhead that uses rocket engine technology to create a luxurious and efficient hair washing experience while reducing water consumption by 61 per cent compared to standard methods.

For now, it is designed for use in hair salons and it has the potential to help save billions of litres of water annually.

“It allows you to have to 10 times smaller droplet size, which means the speed of the water can be the same, but the efficiency of each drop is very high. So I feel no difference in this, the strength and rinse, but I can save 61 per cent water,” said Balooch.

Asked if this technology could one day be rolled out to our homes, he said: “I think, I hope and I truly wish that that will be the case”."

Following the partnership, the two organisations will work together towards a more diverse, equitable, and inclusive fashion industry. HFR supports emerging talent and provides a platform for under-represented Black and Latinx designers.

The partnership marks a historic commitment from LVMH in support of HFR’s mission of discovering, mentoring, and showcasing the emerging talent of colour through multi-platform, high-visibility events and customised pipeline programmes, HFR said in a media statement.

LVMH has committed resources to address issues of diversity, equity and inclusion across the sector through people, business, and brand initiatives and to support the next generation of diverse talent. HFR and LVMH are on a mission to create impactful change for the community of Harlem while opening new doors to the next generation of talented BIPOC designers and connecting emerging black designers to globally recognised luxury brands across the LVMH group of Maisons.

Following the partnership, the two organisations will work together towards a more diverse, equitable, and inclusive fashion industry. HFR supports emerging talent and provides a platform for under-represented Black and Latinx designers. LVMH is a multi-national corporation.#

Brands from across the LVMH portfolio, including Tiffany and Louis Vuitton will continue to collaborate with HFR to offer mentorship and activation opportunities throughout the year and beyond.

The HBCU summit is a commitment intended to transform the art and fashion programs at Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) across North America by providing direct design expertise from industry experts that will advance the next generation of diverse creative talent. In collaboration with HFR and North Carolina A&T State University’s Art and Fashion Department, Tiffany will sponsor the Tenacity Talks ten-week lecture series—featuring key industry experts—on topics such as jewellery design and innovation.

As the first of many mentorship opportunities to come, the recently held three-day HFR’s Designer Retreat hosted more than 75 designers and featured several notable fashion speakers. During ‘Industry Stops,’ designers were notably able to visit the North American offices of Louis Vuitton and meet with key executives, including Lanessa Elrod, zone president and CEO; and Thomas Haupt, SVP of US retail.

Providing a forum for conversation with industry leaders, LVMH North America CEO Anish Melwani and vice president of D&I Corey Smith, joined Brandice Daniel, founder and CEO of HFR to discuss the current state of diversity in fashion at the recently held Black History Month summit.

“Through this partnership, HFR and LVMH North America look forward to continuing their mission of giving designers of colour access to individuals and organisations that can help shape their future. We’ve successfully introduced a wealth of diverse designers to a world-class fashion curriculum consisting of invaluable tools and resources to grow their businesses, and have educated Gen Z on how they too can change fashion's course. Conjunctively, we’ve created opportunities for youth to engage as early as high school, meeting the marginalised, particularly HBCU students, where they are in their fashion careers,” Daniel said.

“LVMH is committed to having a positive impact in our communities and realising the path forward set by Virgil Abloh and others who helped foster equity and inclusion in the fashion industry by supporting and building a pool of diverse creative talent. It is critical for LVMH as an organisation to continue developing talent of colour internally, while ensuring the relevance of our brands and our products in an evolving and diverse consumer landscape. We see this partnership with HFR as a wonderful opportunity to focus on values, culture, business and community all at the same time, as these notions are not mutually exclusive, but interconnected and reinforcing one another,” Corey Smith, vice president, diversity & inclusion, LVMH, said.

Toledano will succeed André Beirnaert, who did not renew his contract with IFM. Toledano previously held multiple roles at Dior, and was appointed chairman and CEO of LVMH-owned Christian Dior Couture before later being named VP, managing director and board member.

“I am committed to putting my experience and my vision of fashion at the service of the younger generations. I am deeply committed to the transmission of knowledge and the central role of education,” a statement from Toledano reads. “Bringing together and developing talents from all over the world in Paris, in management as well as in design and craftsmanship, is essential for our industry.”

Education is one area where luxury’s rivals join forces. In November, a number of luxury CEOs came together for the inauguration of IFM’s new campus, including Toledano, Chanel fashion president Bruno Pavlovsky and Hermès executive vice president Guillaume de Seynes, who joined France’s minister for the economy and finances Bruno Le Maire, as well as IFM dean Xavier Romatet.

“The upsized round saw strong interest from multiple private equity funds with continued participation from existing investors - A91 Partners, Elevation Capital, and India Quotient - firmly placing the company on track to further capitalize on its growth momentum in the rapidly expanding beauty and personal care market in India,” said L Catterton, a global private equity firm part-owned by LVMH, in a statement.

Sugar Cosmetics offers an extensive portfolio of beauty products across the lips, eyes, face, nails and skin categories and has more than quadrupled sales over the past three years. Products are sourced from suppliers in Germany, Italy, India, USA and Korea, and are sold online and through a network of 40,000 retail outlets across 550 Indian cities. “The company’s effective use of new-age, impact-focused content marketing has helped it develop lasting emotional connections with a diverse range of consumer cohorts,” highlighted L Catterton.

L Catterton, which is mostly focused on middle market companies and emerging high-growth enterprises, intends to build on their strategic relationship with LVMH to help Sugar Cosmetics to embark on their next stage of growth amid the expansion of India’s beauty and personal care market. L Catterton has significant experience investing globally in the beauty and personal care industry. Their current and past investments in the space include Il Makiage, Intercos, The Honest Company, Tula, Bliss, CI Flavors, Elemis, Etvos, Function of Beauty, Marubi, Merit, and Sociolla, among others.

Burgeoning cosmetics market

“The move comes at a time when the Indian cosmetics and toiletries market is at an inflection point,” commented Bobby Verghese, Consumer Analyst at GlobalData.

Driven by consumers who are increasingly making cosmetics and skincare a part of their daily repertoire and experimenting with different types of products, India’s beauty and personal care market has expanded considerably over the past five years. Rising adoption of online shopping and greater product penetration in secondary cities are also contributing to the market’s enlargement.

According to GlobalData, sales of beauty products grew by 5.6% CAGR [1] during 2015-2020, with value sales rising from US 11.1 billion in 2015 to USD 14.6 billion in 2020, when COVID-19 arrived. With the pandemic restrictions easing gradually, GlobalData forecasts the cosmetics and toiletries sales in India to grow by 7.2% CAGR over 2020-2025 to reach USD 20.6 billion in 2025.

“Startups such as Sugar Cosmetics and Nykaa are well positioned to tap the fast-paced growth in online beauty retail through their mastery of the omnichannel distribution model,” conluded Verghese."

Louis Vuitton womenswear designer Nicolas Ghesquière and actress Jennifer Connelly have developed a close friendship over the years; he’s dressed her for dozens of red carpets and other appearances in dazzling, if sometimes polarising, custom designs.

But the relationship really paid off at this year’s Cannes Film Festival, when she wore his textured-metallic gown to the premiere of “Top Gun: Maverick.”

Connelly, with her hair pulled back, looked regal in the armour-like bodice, a can’t-forget moment that will forever be associated with a film that could prove to be her biggest hit ever. In its first weekend, the “Top Gun” sequel, starring Tom Cruise, took home an estimated $151 million at the box office in North America, blowing predictions out of the water.

To be sure, there are big names in Louis Vuitton’s celebrity mix. But while Dior goes for shock and awe (Jennifer Lawrence, Rihanna) and Chanel leans heavily on the ingénue (Margaret Qualley, Lily-Rose Depp), since Ghesquière’s arrival in 2013, Vuitton has favoured thinking person’s stars in line with the designer’s mission to elevate the brand, like “La La Land” star Emma Stone, Léa Seydoux — a Bond girl with indie film cred — and Alicia Vikander, who won an Oscar in 2016 for her performance in “The Danish Girl,” but is just as believable in a genre film like the “The Green Knight.”

As a result, Vuitton’s red carpet strategy has driven fewer mentions on social media, where the success of celebrity tie-ups are typically measured, than its two biggest competitors. Since 2013, the brand has earned 86,500 mentions around the Academy Awards, compared to 168,000 for Chanel and 241,000 for Dior, according to tracking firm Brandwatch, mostly because Chanel and Dior’s stars tend to be bigger and are nominated for — and win — more Oscars.

And yet, despite the relative subtlety of its approach, Vuitton has managed to ramp up the conversation around its red-carpet appearances over the past four years. Its best Academy Awards performance happened back in 2016 when Vikander won for Best Supporting Actress in a Ghesquière design. But even without a Vuitton-dressed star landing on the stage in recent years, chatter has steadily grown (with a slight drop-off in 2022), whereas Chanel and Dior’s spikes are higher, but growth is not as steady.

However, as the influence of the American film industry wanes, with fewer people going to the movies and watching Hollywood awards shows, Vuitton appears to be shifting its strategy.

The brand now dresses a wider range of celebrities, from TikTok star Charli D’Amelio to Julia Roberts. In April, it signed 18-year-old “Stranger Things” star Millie Bobby Brown as an ambassador. At Cannes, it wasn’t Connelly but Bollywood superstar Deepika Padukone — who became Vuitton’s first Indian ambassador earlier this year — who generated a whopping seven out of the top 10 posts mentioning the brand, helping the LVMH-owned juggernaut earn more than $20 million in media value, according to tracking firm Launchmetrics.

What’s behind Vuitton’s celebrity success? And will its new approach prove as effective?

Big Budgets

While many brands deny that they pay celebrities to wear their wares, they often do. For the biggest stars, this typically takes the form of brand ambassadorships, which often include advertising campaigns as well as contractual commitments to wear a brand’s looks publicly. That’s on top of striking deals with stylists, who frequently charge brands fees of several thousand dollars a day to ensure their dresses make it onto the red carpet.

Big marketing budgets certainly help. And Louis Vuitton, which generates more revenue a year than any other luxury label, can simply afford to outspend most of its competitors. (That’s on a playing field where in the US alone, Louis Vuitton, Chanel and Dior spent a combined $44 million on print and online advertising in the first quarter of 2022, according to research firm MediaRadar.)

How much of Vuitton’s marketing budget goes to celebrities each year? That depends on who’s on the current roster. If a major star suddenly becomes available, the budget can be found.

But big budgets aren’t everything.

Lots of Bets on Rising Stars

Louis Vuitton has a robust scouting system. This means it’s poised to jump on new talent quickly, placing plenty of bets on stars it believes are set to rise. (At the 2022 Met Gala, the brand dressed 11 people. At the 2022 Oscars, it dressed eight.)

“They do a good job of collecting ambassadors,” said Heather Cocks, red carpet commentator and co-author of the celebrity fashion blog Go Fug Yourself. “They roll the dice more frequently.”

Often, these early bets evolve into something bigger. (Millie Bobby Brown wore Vuitton several times before officially signing with them this year.) However, it doesn’t always work. Jennifer Lawrence look-a-like Haley Bennett was positioned as the next big thing in the mid-2010s, with Louis Vuitton dressing her even before any of her high-profile films were released. While she has appeared in films since, she is not yet a bonafide star.

Loyal Relationships

Connelly, Vikander and Stone are super-famous, but as their careers have ebbed and flowed, Vuitton has continued to work with them, even when they weren’t in the headlines. That continuity has a lot to do with Ghesquière’s personal relationships with each actress.

Top brands like Vuitton work with their biggest stars for five or 10 years, sometimes longer — fragrance advertisements may run for decades — but industry sources say that Ghesquière in particular pounds the pavement to ensure these partnerships feel genuine, not only building friendships with the stars but also their stylists by spending time in Los Angeles, where most of them live. (The designer has such strong ties to the city that he recently bought an $11 million John Lautner house in the Hollywood Hills.)

He does this through private, one-on-one meetings, but also by staging events that garner media coverage, like the recent pre-Oscars party at hotspot Gigi’s that was hosted by W magazine and sponsored by Vuitton.

Brand Over Dress

Vuitton’s heritage as an accessories brand, not a couture house, is a weakness when it comes to celebrity dressing. Unlike Chanel, for example, Vuitton’s red carpet look lacks a clear signature: most consumers can’t easily spot a Vuitton gown. And on the red carpet, the brand oscillates between Ghesquière’s adventurous, space-age aesthetic and stars’ frequent preference for classically glamorous and sexy silhouettes. But Vuitton makes up for this by wrapping its celebrities in a bigger brand package that goes beyond a mere dress.

While longtime ambassadors Connelly and Vikander tend to wear runway or runway-inspired looks, at this year’s Oscars, Alana Haim’s white-beaded Vuitton gown was almost unidentifiable. And yet, the “Licorice Pizza” actress had been wearing (and talking about) Vuitton so much on her promotional tour for the film that the association stuck. The glossy advertisements featuring many of the brand’s top ambassadors are also extremely memorable, which helps to further cement the association. It’s less about a specific look and more about the whole package.

“There are very few brands that have such a strong identification between actress and product and brand,” said Stefano Tonchi, the former editor of W magazine. “They become a part of Louis Vuitton.”

A Strategy Shift

After years of steady success, Louis Vuitton appears to be broadening its approach to celebrity dressing with an eye on new geographies and the next generation.

In May, at its cruise show at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, about 100 miles south of Hollywood, the more than 20 notables included mainstays Seydoux and Chloë Grace Moretz, but also newly minted model Eve Jobs (daughter of the late Apple founder Steve Jobs), Thai actress Urassaya Sperbund, director Ava DuVernay and South Korean star Bae Doona. At the Met Gala, the brand made noise for dressing YouTube star Emma Chamberlain.

At this year’s Oscars, actor Timothée Chalamet’s sequined black suit, pulled from Ghesquière’s Spring 2022 womenswear collection and worn shirtless, was one of the most talked-about looks of the evening, suggesting that the brand has scope to go younger and more “pop” while maintaining its exclusivity.

Vuitton’s recent bets on a broader range of celebrity partners could create confusion for the consumer. Who is the Louis Vuitton archetype? Is it Connelly in a space-age sheath, Padukone in a classic ball gown or Chalamet in a shirtless tux?

With Ghesquière’s brand elevation mission broadly accomplished after nine years at the house, growing attention in new markets and with Gen-Z may increasingly be the name of the game.

“If attention and discussion is a goal, give the people something to talk about,” said Kellan Terry of Brandwatch, referring to Chalamet’s Oscars-night look. “It also didn’t hurt that he is a massive star and the face of a huge blockbuster.”

However, more people to dress also means more outfits to produce. At the Met Gala, the brand positioned its “no new dresses” policy as a sustainability statement, but not making new garments also meant saving hundreds of thousands of dollars.

Meanwhile, Connelly’s recent string of appearances — she wore Louis Vuitton twice on the red carpet at Cannes, then again for late-night television spots — are more representative of the failsafe strategies Vuitton has been using for years, suggesting that the brand is betting on a blend of the old and the new to keep its celebrity strategy competitive.

"Worn by A$AP Rocky, working with Dior, LVMH Prize winner – Erl is on the up - South China Morning Post","Fri, 10 Jun 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjbXAuY29tL2xpZmVzdHlsZS9mYXNoaW9uLWJlYXV0eS9hcnRpY2xlLzMxODA5NjgvZGlvci1jb2xsYWJvcmF0aW9uLWFuZC1leHBvc3VyZS1hYXAtcm9ja3ktZXJsLWZhc2hpb27SAXNodHRwczovL2FtcC5zY21wLmNvbS9saWZlc3R5bGUvZmFzaGlvbi1iZWF1dHkvYXJ0aWNsZS8zMTgwOTY4L2Rpb3ItY29sbGFib3JhdGlvbi1hbmQtZXhwb3N1cmUtYWFwLXJvY2t5LWVybC1mYXNoaW9u?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Thanks to the involvement of Dover Street Market Paris, or DSMP, Russell Linnetz (who is based in Los Angeles, where he grew up) didn’t have to worry about any of that. The brand development group was established by Comme des Garçons CEO Adrian Joffe to support and distribute independent labels such as Youths In Balaclava and Vaquera.

While many young designers excel at putting out clothes that look great and attract buzz, they often struggle with the business back end – from sourcing materials and finding the right factories to producing garments and distributing them.

When Eli Russell Linnetz founded Erl in 2018, he had a luxury that few independent fashion designers have: he was able to delegate the difficult matters that can make or break a small fashion company and focus solely on the creative side.

The brand got a huge boost in September 2021, when rapper A$AP Rocky showed up to the Met Gala in new York in a multicoloured quilted blanket from the label.

Earlier this year, Erl collaborated with Dior Men’s artistic director Kim Jones for the French brand’s spring 2023 collection, which was shown a stone’s throw away from where Russell Linnetz lives, and exposed him to the inner workings of a big brand.

“It started over direct messages and, before you knew it, the whole design team was in Venice Beach,” says Russell Linnetz. “Seeing Kim work with his team and how he delegates creativity was really inspiring, and this experience showed me the power of commerce and how you can use business to tell bigger stories.”

Russell Linnetz never trained as a designer and came to fashion almost by chance. “I went to school as a screenwriter, to make movies. For me, it was always about telling a story, whether it was a music video or stage design,” he says in an interview in Paris after winning the Karl Lagerfeld Prize, part of the annual LVMH Prize awards.

The awards are given every year by luxury group LVMH – the company behind brands such as Dior and Louis Vuitton – to support small, independent creators.

The filmmaker had worked with musicians such as Kanye West and Lady Gaga, and it was only after a collaboration with Comme des Garçons for a fragrance campaign and a conversation with Joffe that Erl (the letters stand for the designer’s initials) was born.

It’s tempting to view the unisex, laid-back label as yet another brand joining the streetwear bandwagon, but Russell Linnetz doesn’t like to define it that way.

“I don’t think in categories like streetwear. For me, it’s creating stories and characters,” he says. “I don’t think about how people see it.”

Los Angeles – particularly, Venice Beach where Russell Linnetz was born and lives – play a big role in the aesthetics of the brand, which Russell Linnetz calls “intimate, colourful, approachable and fun”.

Think bright colours, easy silhouettes, fun patterns, genderless separates such as hoodies and sweatshirts, cosy knitwear and floral-print shirts.

“Being from LA, where movies are so important, there’s that element of storytelling in my collections,” he says.

“I was born and raised in Venice Beach, which is very laid-back, and people want to be comfortable and are easy-going.”

Russell Linnetz is more than ready to tell bigger stories. Erl is available in about 250 stores around the world and the brand is planning to open a shop in Paris this year.

Winning the Karl Lagerfeld Award, which comes with a €150,000 (US$160,000) cash prize plus mentoring from LVMH executives, is likely to propel the rise of the label. Russell Linnetz admits that, in spite of the support of DSMP and recent accolades, there’s a lot of work to be done (hiring a CFO is next on his to-do list).

“Just because someone’s helping with production it doesn’t mean it’s going to be successful,” he says. “I don’t feel like I’ve made it. I’m never satisfied. I already have fittings tomorrow.”

He adds: “The exciting thing is that, after I finish a collection and take ownership of it, I don’t want to see it any more and I just shift gears. It takes a manic personality to do this.”"

Daley. Since his debut in 2020, he revisits the richness of the history of art, literature, and of his motherland’s suit tradition through the lens of the socio-cultural divisions still at work today, while bringing his own distinct queer humor. Numéro spoke with him only a few weeks ahead of his great reward.

The British heritage keeps inspiring fashion designers. Whether they draw their influences from Britain’s large history of suits and decorative arts, such as the Arts and Crafts movement during the mid-19th century, or from traditional crafts like tartan and quilted fabrics, this heritage offers a breeding ground for many native and resident designers, from Vivienne Westwood and Alexander McQueen to Charles Jeffrey and Stefan Cooke more recently. Steven Stokey-Daley follows that same path. Since the launch of his menswear label S.S. Daley in 2020, it didn’t take much time for the Merseyside-born creator, a county in Northwest England, to make an impact and land up as one the LVMH Prize for Young Designers’ finalists. Offering a “new British wardrobe” as he phrases it, he revisits the British Isles classics, such as the Irish knit sweater, the Jacquard pattern, the Prince of Wales check suit, or the striped one. Made from leftover stocks and sustainable materials, those elements spring as modern and bold cuts, with openwork sweaters, tight jumpsuits, paisley mini-shorts, fluid tops with puffed sleeves, or the well-known pair of large-darted pants decorated with blue flowers, which Harry Styles wore for the music video of his song Golden. Since then, the British pop phenomenon keeps playing with his gender fluidity, thus giving high visibility to the new label. He has recently worn his brown cardigan ornamented with two knitted yellow ducks – S.S. Daley’s signature – which embodies the humor of a young literature and history lover who sees the fashion industry as a “giant play”. Indeed, through his collections, Steven Stokey-Daley gently teases the socio-cultural divisions between the upper class and the working and rural ones, adding a delicate but subversive touch of queerness. Numéro : You grew up in Merseyside, near Liverpool, in a working class environment. How did you first take an interest in fashion, and later considered becoming a fashion designer? Steven Stokey-Daley : It's interesting, because I never really took a huge interest in fashion at all - it didn't really exist where I was for the earlier part of my life. My grandmother worked in a garment factory locally when she was very young, and she has always been the fellow creative thinker in the family - I think that connection probably lives through my work today and is the reason I do this now. You worked with the menswear teams at Alexander McQueen and Tom Ford. What did these two experiences teach you? They both taught me wildly different things. Tom Ford is theatre, it's high octane glamour; fast pace, but highly rewarding. McQueen was different, it was a well oiled machine, I'd say I became a well rounded designer from Tom Ford, and learned how to hone in on one skill set at a time and perfect it at McQueen.

You graduated from the Westminster Fashion Design BA in 2020. What motivated you to launch your own label almost immediately after? We were faced with career uncertainty, I didn't want to sit around doing nothing, so I just carried on as though Uni never finished, working to my own deadlines and marketing it via instagram like the rest of the world. I'm a super restless person, I can't sit still. So this universal stillness, after the chaos of our final university months, made me uneasy. You indeed launched your label in the midst of a very difficult time, with the pandemic hitting all over the world and most countries going into lockdown. How did you go through this experience as an emerging fashion designer? It was like being thrown into the deepest, widest ocean while learning how to swim. It was really very difficult at times to know what to do next, or how to orchestrate certain things I had never done before. I don't think it was the the lockdown that pushed me to actually do it though. For that I am grateful. “Launching my own label was like being thrown into the deepest, widest ocean while learning how to swim.” Previously, though, you considered studying literature at some point, and still seem very interested in it. Today, you are also not afraid to reference some novels and authors directly while speaking about your collections. Why do literature, novels, poems inspire you so much? I think literature and poetry captures romance in a unique light. The relationship we have with reading is personal and almost private: between yourself and the words you can conjure such vivid emotional responses and I suppose I try to convey aspects of that feeling via the clothing, the shows and the brand world. You also are very invested into menswear history, especially on the way men who did not fit traditional views of masculinity used to dress themselves over centuries. Where does that more theoretical and academic interest come from, and how is it reflected in your collections? Well, the laser focus into the components that make up menswear was for sure encouraged by my time at Tom Ford. They really unpack what it means to define 'menswear' in a way you wouldn't expect. I enjoy furthering that investigation by undoing it, rewriting it. I have always liked the idea of approaching design, which is practical by nature, through theory. I think that's the sweet spot in achieving a kind of nuanced subversion.

Recently, we have heard a lot about “queering the archive”, and “queering the present”. How would you say your collections embody this queer spirit, be it technically, visually, in terms of inspirations, shapes or silhouettes? I originally referenced queer focussed narrative like the series Brideshead Revisited [1981 TV adaptation 1981 of the eponymous novel by Evelyn Waugh] or the movie Maurice [directed by James Ivory and released in 1987, which main plot is also a gay and taboo romance between two men during the late 19th century]. There is something queercentric in the conception of each collection. I think 'queering the norm' can be through silhouette, fabrication or even down to the finer detail. It’s that step away from convention, which feels absolutely at the core of the brand. “I have always liked the idea of approaching design, which is practical by nature, through theory. I think that's the sweet spot in achieving a kind of nuanced subversion.” There’s still something very British about your creations themselves, using traditional cuts, knits and patterns that have made British fashion so instantly recognizable... S.S.Daley’s identity keeps evolving, but I indeed always aim to redefine antiquated ideas of British heritage. I think the appeal is that I'm reinterpreting these standard, stale ideas of 'Britishness' and bringing a new energy to them; an energy that steps away from the negative connotations of heritage fashion. In September 2021, you become part of the London Fashion Week official calendar and showcase your first standalone presentation featuring actors from the National Youth Theatre, where you were yourself an actor in Liverpool as a teenager. How important was this experience for you, to the point of becoming the main inspiration for this Fashion Week debut? I was a part of the National Young Theatre for years and it opened me up to many things like going to London for the first time, living alone and meeting totally like-minded individuals. It was an experience I'll never take for granted. Actually, I think a lot of who I am today comes from that.

Louis Vuitton Names BTS-like Chinese Boy Band Teens in Times as Ambassador - Yahoo Finance,"Wed, 22 Jun 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9sb3Vpcy12dWl0dG9uLW5hbWVzLWJ0cy1jaGluZXNlLTE1MDc0NTI2My5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"SHANGHAI — Louis Vuitton has named the BTS-like Chinese boy band Teens in Times — TNT for short — its latest brand ambassador.

TNT will join the likes of Yifei Liu, Zhou Dongyu, Chuxi Zhong, Jun Gong and Dilraba Dilmurat as the latest China market-focused ambassadors for the French luxury house. Weibo fans flooded the brand’s announcement video.

More from WWD

The video Louis Vuitton shared on Weibo has been reposted 1 million times and garnered more than 1.3 million likes at the time of publication.

Fans flooded the post’s comment section, thanking Louis Vuitton for picking the young band. Dedicated fans channeled the brand’s copy with poetic comments to support individual band members.

The boy band currently has over 10 million followers on Weibo.

Revealing the appointment a day before Louis Vuitton menswear runway show in Paris can help drive engagement to the brand’s online streaming session, which has become a key performance indicator for brands in China, and raise awareness and sales among the group’s legion of fans.

According to Louis Vuitton parent company LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton’s recent first-quarter financial report, revenues in Asia rose by just 8 percent, compared with an 86 percent jump in the same period last year. Despite the COVID-19 lockdown’s impact on sales in China, LVMH restated with confidence that the Chinese luxury market would bounce back rapidly.

TNT is a product of entertainment company Time Fengjun Entertainment, which was behind the success of boy bands like TFboys and Typhoon Boys.

TNT consists of seven members between the ages of 16 and 20, including band captain Ma Jiaqi, and members Ding Chengxin, Song Yaxuan, Liu Yaowen, Zhang Zhenyuan, Yan Haoxiang and He Junli. The group made its debut in late 2019 with two singles, “Endless Adventure” and “All Over the School Bulletin.”

TNT has been the face of several consumer brands, including Olay, Sketchers, Chinese fast-fashion brand Handu and beauty brand Florasis. The Louis Vuitton partnership is the band’s first luxury endorsement.

For Louis Vuitton, landing a safe ambassador has been a bumpy road in China.

Before “Mulan” star Liu’s appointment last year, the spot of a female ambassador for China had been left vacant for years. Fan Bingbing, the Chinese actress who appeared in the “X-Men” and “Iron Man” film franchises, lost her role as Vuitton’s ambassador after being fined by the Chinese government in 2018 for tax evasion.

Last July, Louis Vuitton terminated Chinese Canadian singer-actor Kris Wu’s endorsement deal after a beauty industry influencer made allegations and accused the traffic star of targeting young and sometimes underage females for sex. Wu was arrested and formally charged in August. According to local media outlets, the fallen star will be sentenced for rape after a secret trial began in Beijing two weeks ago.

The world’s largest consumer-focused investment platform, L Catterton , expects a significant inflow out of its Asia fund towards India where it sees a surge in investment opportunities, as domestic consumption is coming back after a slump of two years caused by the Covid pandemic, a senior executive said. Catterton , backed by Paris-based luxury products giant LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, considers India as its high-priority market and ranks it above several other markets in Asia, managing director and head of India Anjana Sasidharan told ET.“India is one of the firm’s key markets in Asia and will account for a significant portion of investments from L Catterton’s $1.45 billion Asia fund. And we do want to make sure that there is active participation from an India vantage point, because we are quite bullish about the growth prospects overall of India, even relative to some of the other Asia markets,” she said.The US-headquartered private equity fund, which was among the first set of investors pumped in money when Mukesh Ambani raised Rs 1.27 lakh crore in Reliance Jio platforms in the middle of the Covid pandemic, looks to invest $20-150 million across a range of sectors including beauty & personal care, edtech, health & wellness, packaged food & beverage, and pet care, Sasidharan said. “Deals could span Series-B to pre-IPO fundraising rounds, and could involve minority or majority stakes. We see the India market overall as being at a stage of nascence of many categories as they're getting developed, as consumers get more and more mature. This gives a sweet opportunity to build quality business over time,” she said.Last month, L Catterton led a $50 million investment in Sugar Cosmetics . Prior to that, it invested $250 million in Reliance Jio and has a Rs 178 crore exposure to Future Lifestyle.The firm, which counts iconic brands such as Pepe Jeans and Bliss among its portfolio firms, had previously invested in PVR , Fab India and Genesis Colours. It made a Rs 375 crore investment to take control of Impresario Entertainment & Hospitality, which operates casual dining brands and hangout bars like Smoke House Deli, Salt Water Cafe and Social.“There are quite a few sectors in India that are still in a nascent stage and, overall, several years of secular growth ahead of it. This makes a case of long-term investment for us in the region,” Sasidharan said.L Catterton manages $30 billion globally across six different funds. In 2016, L Capital, the investment arm of LVMH, controlled by French billionaire Bernard Arnault, merged its operations with US fund Catterton to create the consumer-focused investment platform.“The key distinguishing feature about us as a fund is that we are very consumer-focused. We try to maintain our approach across markets, and make sure that some of the insights and the approaches we take straddle across markets,” she said.Consumer tech was one of the core areas that attracted the largest chunk of private equity inflows in 2021, according to a report by Bain & Co.“Much of 2021’s deal activity was in consumer tech and IT/ITeS, an indication of the expanding share of growth captured by the tech and internet sectors. The two sectors combined represented more than 60% of the year’s deal value at nearly $44 billion, and represent the sector’s resilience and attractiveness through uncertainties as business models in these sectors adapted faster than traditional models in other sectors. Further, VC and growth equity surpassed all growth estimates, soaring to $38.5 billion from approximately $10 billion 2020,” Bain & Co said in its India private equity report on Wednesday."
Abortion decision backs US companies into a tight space - Premium beauty,"Wed, 29 Jun 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnByZW1pdW1iZWF1dHluZXdzLmNvbS9lbi9hYm9ydGlvbi1kZWNpc2lvbi1iYWNrcy11cywyMDU0NdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"""Today’s Scotus (Supreme Court of the United States) ruling puts women’s health in jeopardy, denies them their human rights, and threatens to dismantle the progress we’ve made toward gender equality in the workplace since Roe,"" said Yelp Chief Executive Jeremy Stoppelman on Twitter. ""Business leaders must speak out now and call on Congress to codify Roe into law.""

The Supreme Court’s decision of June 24, 2022 to overturn the landmark 1973 ""Roe v. Wade"" ruling enshrining U.S. women’s right to an abortion, is expected to result in patchwork legal rights across the United States, with abortion legal in progressive states like California and New York and barred in more conservative states like Texas.

Extension of reproductive care benefits

However few other CEOs of large US companies joined Stoppelman in condemning the decision. More common were statements from companies announcing or reiterating intention to reimburse employees if they need to travel for an abortion.

“We are expanding [the benefits of the ELC’s medical plan] to include the coverage of travel and lodging necessary to access reproductive healthcare options within the United States that may not be easily accessible or locally available to employees and their dependents enrolled in ELC’s medical plan,” said The Estée Lauder Companies in a statement.

Similarly, luxury group LVMH said: “LVMH and our Maisons remain committed to providing equitable access to high-quality and affordable health care resources for all employees and their families, regardless of where they live in the United States. This includes expenses associated with travel to a different state for health care services.”

Yelp and Airbnb were among the first companies to announce such benefits last September following a Texas law banning abortion after six weeks, or before many women know they are pregnant. Others, including Citigroup, Tesla and Amazon, had also announced the benefit in following months. More companies came forward after a draft version of last week’s abortion ruling was published in a press leak in May; this group included Starbucks, Levi Strauss and JPMorgan Chase. On Friday, Disney added its name to the list, assuring employees of access to reproductive care benefits ""no matter where they live,"" according to a memo reported by CNBC. In the personal care industry Johnson & Johnson, and Unilever have made similar moves.

Cautionary tale

However, most large companies in the U.S. have avoided publicly discussing the topic, a dynamic that Wharton business school professor Maurice Schweitzer considers unsurprising.

""I think we’ll see more companies statements. But companies are facing a challenge. On the one hand, they want to be active, be involved, make a statement, lead on this issue, because particularly for some companies, their employees value this,"" Schweitzer said. ""But it’s a complicated issue, because the legal landscape will change,"" opening companies up to possible litigation, he added.

Schweitzer pointed to Disney’s recent difficulties in Florida as a cautionary tale. The entertainment giant found itself between a rock and a hard place as Florida’s legislature advanced what critics have called the ""Don’t Say Gay"" law, which bans lessons on sexual orientation and gender identity in elementary schools. After initially staying quiet on the proposal, Disney finally spoke out on the measure, enraging far right Republican Governor Ron DeSantis, who ultimately signed a second law specifically punishing Disney over the row by eliminating the company’s special status surrounding its Orlando theme park.

Disney ""ended up frustrating employees by not speaking out early enough, but also incurring costs from a political fights."" Schweitzer noted that more companies have spoken out in recent years, such as Apple CEO Tim Cook on gay rights and Dick’s Sporting Goods on gun control, which on Friday announced that it will provide up to $4,000 for employees, their spouses or their dependents who have to travel for an abortion. But the procedure is ""more fraught"" than many issues, Schweitzer said. ""It’s easier for companies to try to be silent than to wade into it,"" he said.

Actually, major companies usually stay apart from social and political conflicts, especially in a polarized time. They tend to be afraid of offending their customers and associating their brands with sensitive subjects. However, this changed recently as pressures do not only come from advocacy groups but have extended to younger consumers and employees expecting the brands the buy, or the companies they work for, to have clear positions on what they see as key public issues. A series of indie brands have well understood that commitment could be a way to stand out from the crowd and met success by placing “corporate activism” as the keystone of their business model.

Toledano, who takes on the IFM title in addition to his full-time job as chairman and chief executive officer of LVMH Fashion Group and a member of the LVMH executive committee, has been on the IFM board for 24 years and vice chairman the last five, demonstrating his commitment to the transmission of knowledge that is key in fashion and luxury.

Toledano was elected at a closed-doors assembly on June 14, and he succeeds André Beirnaert, the textile executive who took over the presidency following IFM founder Pierre Bergé’s death in 2017.

Anne Dellière, Compagnie Financière Richemont’s group marketing and strategic plan director, succeeds Toledano as vice chairman.

Toledano was previously president of the École de la Chambre Syndicale de la Couture Parisienne, which in 2019 merged with France’s IFM management school in a bid to become a world-class fashion school uniting business, design and savoir-faire.

That year, Condé Nast France executive Xavier Romatet was named general manager and dean of the IFM.

In a statement following Toledano’s election, Romatet lauded his “incomparable experience, his in-depth knowledge of global fashion and his multiple connections.

“His presence at our side will enable us to strengthen the influence of Institut Français de la Mode and its international appeal,” Romatet added.

In an exclusive interview with WWD, Toledano said his ambition is to elevate the school’s reputation as “one of the best for fashion management and fashion design.

“The main objective is to attract an international audience, to assure excellence in the level of teaching and research, and to be as inclusive as possible,” he added.

And as the conversation around fashion enlarges to NFTs, the metaverse and Web3 applications, his goal is to build bridges with educational and research institutions dedicated to technology and digital innovation, in addition to centers dedicated to textile research.

Toledano lauded the steady hand of Beirnaert’s long tenure, and gave a shout-out to Ralph Toledano, president of the Fédération de la Haute Couture et de la Mode, for helping to mobilize the industry behind the creation of a larger, stronger IFM.

An engineering graduate of École Centrale Paris, Sidney Toledano began his career at market research firm AC Nielsen, eventually finding his way into fashion when he took the helm of footwear concern Kickers and leather goods brand Lancel. But he is best known for his illustrious 20-year career helming Christian Dior, catapulting it to the pinnacle of luxury.

He now oversees an array of LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton brands including Celine, Loewe, Givenchy, Kenzo, Pucci, Marc Jacobs, Patou and Moynat.

He described education as “the best passport, the best bridge to succeed in a career, or in entrepreneurship” and noted that today’s fashion students enter an increasingly complex industry grappling with digitalization, sustainability and a turbulent socio-political backdrop.

He touted that about a fifth of students at IFM have a scholarship, thanks largely to generous contributions from corporate donors. “We want it to be accessible to people, particularly on the creative side,” he said. “I’d love to see our design students competing for the LVMH Prize or the ANDAM prize, opening their own companies or joining big studios.”

Despite the challenges posed by the coronavirus pandemic, the IFM has charted rapid growth, tripling the number of students over the last four years, and more than tripling the number of academic programs to 17.

Come September, when classes resume, the IFM is expecting 400 students in fashion design, 400 students in management and 300 students in savoir-faire.

A suave, warm and wise figure on the Paris fashion scene, Toledano has had ties to the IFM when there were fewer than 100 people at the school. “I’ve always been excited by this school and its spirit,” he enthused.

Over the years, Toledano has addressed students innumerable times about the realities of creative management and business imperatives, always appreciating their no-holds-barred questions, and relishing visits to classrooms where prototypes for dresses, bags and shoes are created.

“Presence is important: doing a course, helping, encouraging,” he said. “I’m really passionate about studios and ateliers, and you see these students are really well prepared to enter large fashion companies, or start their own brands.”

Toledano’s election comes as the IFM gears up for its first physical fashion show on the eve of Paris Fashion Week for menswear. The June 20 display at IFM’s new campus in Paris will showcase the final collections by 32 bachelor of arts in fashion design students.

Each is to parade six looks that integrate a sustainable development, technological or ethical element, according to the IFM, which introduced the three-year bachelor design program in 2019.

The program has attracted about 250 students, 44 percent of them from outside of France, over the past three years, according to the IFM, noting that “a significant need-based scholarship fund sponsored by the companies of the IFM Foundation allows the school to welcome all creative talents into the program, regardless of their financial situation.”

The foundation is funded by 35 companies including Adidas, Balenciaga, Burberry, Celine, Chanel, Chloé, Dior, Farfetch, Hermès, Kering, L’Oréal, Louis Vuitton and Saint Laurent, and offers scholarships to about 130 students per academic term. Fashion executives also teach, offer masterclasses, and participate in juries.

The IFM’s new 86,000-square-foot headquarters, designed by architect Patrick Mauger and built at a cost of 15 million euros, opened in January and now houses courses catering to all levels of fashion education, from vocational training to Ph.D.

Founded in 1986 by Pierre Bergé, Yves Saint’s Laurent’s business partner, the IFM has produced designers such as Guillaume Henry and Nadège Vanhee-Cybulski, though it is mainly known for churning out world-class managers who have filled the ranks of leading luxury groups.

It is supported by the French Ministry of Industry and is known for its academic and market research. Nina Ricci’s Guillaume Henri and Ami designer Alexandre Mattiussi are among graduates of the IFM’s design program.

Famous alumni of the the École de la Chambre Syndicale, founded in 1927, include Valentino Garavani, Yves Saint Laurent, André Courrèges, Issey Miyake and Tomas Maier, though in recent decades it has been overtaken by overseas competitors such as London’s Central Saint Martins and the Royal Academy of Fine Arts in Antwerp, Belgium.

Toledano wears a few other hats in the industry: He’s also a committee member of the Chambre Syndicale de la Haute Couture and on the executive committee of the Fédération de la Haute Couture et de la Mode.

Aimé Leon Dore Opens New London Flagship - Yahoo Finance,"Fri, 03 Jun 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9haW0tbGVvbi1kb3JlLW9wZW5zLWxvbmRvbi0xODMxNDA2MTQuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"This embedded content is not available in your region.

Aimé Leon Dore is expanding its reach.

This week, the New York City-based brand unveiled its new London flagship located at 32 Broadwick St. In a press release, the new shop is touted as “the newest extension of the brand.” A video, seen above, provides viewers with an inside glimpse at the latest space for ALD, which recently rolled out a New Balance 991 collab.

At the top of the year, it was announced that LVMH Luxury Ventures was taking a minority stake in Aimé Leon Dore. In a statement at the time, ALD founder Teddy Santis touted the deal as providing the necessary “fuel” for a new era of expansion for the brand.

“LVMH’s vast network of global leaders across the industry and its rich history in growing exceptional storied brands offers a truly unique partnership opportunity to fuel the next chapter of growth for Aimé Leon Dore,” Santis said.

Confirmed in the January announcement was that ALD would continue to operate independently, albeit with new “support and guidance” from the larger LVMH Luxury Ventures team. More recently, ALD linked with Wool Rich for a collaborative Spring/Summer 2022 collection. See looks from the collection here.

Givenchy beauty's metaverse puts a luxury twist on video gaming - Cosmetics Business,"Tue, 14 Jun 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vY29zbWV0aWNzYnVzaW5lc3MuY29tL25ld3MvYXJ0aWNsZV9wYWdlL0dpdmVuY2h5X2JlYXV0eXNfbWV0YXZlcnNlX3B1dHNfYV9sdXh1cnlfdHdpc3Rfb25fdmlkZW9fZ2FtaW5nLzIwMTUwNtIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Givenchy is the latest beauty brand to launch a metaverse, a first for the LVMH-owned brand.

The Givenchy Beauty House platform, hosted via gaming website Roblox, includes different virtual areas inspired by the brand's heritage.

The virtual gardens showcase the brand's origins, meanwhile, the Irresistible dance floor and the L’Interdit forbidden station are inspired by Givenchy's two flagship fragrances.

Users can also engage with digital make-up stations, photobooths and a swimming pool.

Computer-generated vending machines have been created with Le Rouge lipstick-branded cross body bags for the users' avatar to wear.

Avatar's can also recieve a Givenchy-themed beauty makeover.

""With the Givenchy Beauty House, Givenchy Parfums and Roblox provide a place where beauty has no limit, allowing players to fully express themselves through their avatar,"" said the French brand in a statement.

The Gang, a Swedish game development studio, was hired to create the Givenchy branded metaverse. Gucci and Vans are among The Gang's previous clients.

Givenchy is an early adopter of video game and Web 3 marketing. It was one of the first prestige brands to offer branded looks on Animal Crossing, a Nintendo video game that became a massive hit during the pandemic.

It then jumped on the NFT craze last summer by launching a Pride-themed digital art collection with Rewind Collective.

The series sold out in two seconds and raised nearly US$120,000 for LGBT+ charity Le MAG Jeunes association.

In November 2021, Givenchy also launched an NFT collection with Mexico-based airbrush artist Chito.

The race to create immersive brand experiences in the metaverse has intensified.

In June, NYX co-created a metaverse-based Pride parade, Byredo launched its 'scent of the metaverse' and hair care brand Sunsilk used the technology to target female gamers."

"3 Reasons to Buy Hermès International, and 1 to Sell - The Motley Fool","Fri, 17 Jun 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIyLzA2LzE3LzMtcmVhc29ucy1idXktaGVybWVzLWludGVybmF0aW9uYWwtYW5kLTEtdG8tc2VsbC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Is the French luxury house the ideal investment for this tough market?

Hermès International's (HESAY -1.47%) stock shed about 40% of its market value this year as inflation, rising interest rates, and other macro headwinds drove investors from growth stocks toward value stocks.

However, the French luxury house's stock has still more than doubled over the past five years. It has also withstood several recessions since its public debut in 1993, and it remains one of the world's best-known luxury brands. Let's review three reasons to buy Hermès -- and one reason to sell it -- to see if it's a worthwhile investment in this turbulent market.

1. It's well insulated from the current macro headwinds

Hermès and its rival LVMH Moët Hennessy L.V. (LVMUY -1.91%) both target affluent shoppers, who are generally much better insulated from economic downturns than other consumers are. Both companies are able to pass on higher costs to their customers more efficiently than lower-end brands.

Hermès also manufactures most of its products in small workshops in France instead of mass-producing them overseas, like LVMH. That localized approach supports the luxury appeal of Hermès' brand and gives it significant pricing power against its industry peers.

Hermès hasn't aggressively expanded beyond its core brand with big acquisitions as has LVMH, which currently owns 75 luxury houses across five different product categories. Hermès' tighter focus on its flagship brand and lower dependence on overseas manufacturers insulate it from many of the supply chain headwinds currently hurting LVMH and other multinational companies.

2. Its healthy post-lockdown recovery

Hermès' growth decelerated in fiscal 2020 as the pandemic forced it to temporarily close its brick-and-mortar stores. The decline of global travel and tourism exacerbated that pain. But in fiscal 2021, it returned to growth with a healthy 42% increase in its constant-currency revenue.

Period FY 2019 FY 2020 FY 2021 Revenue 6.88 billion euros ($7.2 billion) 6.39 billion euros 8.98 billion euros YOY* Growth (Decline) 12.4% (6%) 41.8%

That growth was driven by double-digit increases across all six of its main categories: leather goods and saddlery, ready-to-wear and accessories, silk and textiles, other sectors, perfume and beauty, and watches.

In the first quarter of 2022, Hermès' revenue rose another 27% year over year in constant currency terms with double-digit growth across all six categories. Analysts expect its revenue to rise 17% for the full year, then grow another 10% to 11.6 billion euros ($12.1 billion) in fiscal 2023.

3. Expanding margins and rising profits

Hermès' margins and net profit dipped in fiscal 2020 as it grappled with higher COVID-19 expenses. However, its margins expanded rapidly in fiscal 2021 and actually exceeded its pre-pandemic levels.

Period FY 2019 FY 2020 FY 2021 Operating Margin 34% 32.4% 39.3% Net Profit Margin 22.2% 21.7% 27.2% Net Income Growth YOY (Decline) 8.8% (9.4%) 76.5%

That expansion can be attributed to its pricing power (particularly in high-growth markets like China), its operating efficiencies, and its improving scale. Hermès also expanded its workforce by 8% in 2020 and 6% in 2021, which indicates it's still confident about its long-term prospects.

Analysts expect Hermès' operating and net margins to dip slightly in fiscal 2022 (but remain far above its 2019 levels) before expanding again in fiscal 2023. They also expect its net income to rise 12% this year and grow another 11% to 3.03 billion euros ($3.16 billion) in fiscal 2023.

We should take all those forecasts with a grain of salt, since the market faces a lot of unpredictable headwinds, but Hermès' resilience during previous economic downturns suggests it can hit those targets.

The one reason to sell Hermès: Its valuation

The biggest problem with Hermès is that many investors have already flocked to it as a recession-resistant play. As a result, its stock now trades at about 38 times this year's earnings.

By comparison, analysts expect LVMH's revenue and earnings per share to rise 16% and 14%, respectively, this year. Yet LVMH trades at just 20 times this year's earnings, which arguably makes it look a lot more attractive than Hermès.

Is Hermès a worthwhile investment?

I own shares of both Hermès and LVMH. But at these valuations, I believe Hermès has less upside potential than LVMH or other higher-growth apparel retailers. Hermès is still a solid long-term investment, but investors should expect the stock to tread water for at least a few more quarters in this challenging market before it swims forward again."
Billionaire Bernard Arnault Flips Beverly Hills Mansion To Himself - The Real Deal,"Wed, 22 Jun 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vdGhlcmVhbGRlYWwuY29tL2xhLzIwMjIvMDYvMjIvZnJlbmNoLWJpbGxpb25haXJlLWJlcm5hcmQtYXJuYXVsdC1mbGlwcy1iZXZlcmx5LWhpbGxzLW1hbnNpb24tdG8taGltc2VsZi_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The third richest man in the world has sold a Beverly Hills mansion for $84.5 million––to himself.

An affiliate of French business magnate Bernard Arnault sold a single-story mansion in Trousdale Estates to another affiliate set up by his attorney, Dirt.com reported. The home was never publicly listed.

The billionaire investor sold the property through a limited liability company to another LLC set up by the lawyer in December, with a mortgage secured by a Paris bank known to have a longstanding relationship with Arnault, his family and his businesses.

Transfer taxes were paid on the deal, and they confirm the sale of $84.5 million

Located on a steep ridge in the Trousdale neighborhood, the contemporary mansion was custom-designed for Arnault by Marmol Radziner, an architecture firm based in Sawtelle.

Archived permits reveal the single-story house is likely larger than 10,000 square feet, but was built with only three bedrooms, according to Dirt.

In addition to two guest suites, there’s a giant master bedroom with two bathrooms, a separate sauna and wellness center, a dressing room and private sitting room. Out back, an infinity-edged swimming pool is shaped like a frying pan.

Views take in the Los Angeles skyline, from DTLA skyscrapers to the Pacific Ocean and Catalina Island.

Because the property was never offered for sale, there are no public photos or many further details. In 2016, Arnault paid $32.5 million for the then-vacant lot. The two-parcel property spans nearly two acres, though much of that land is unusable hillside.

Arnault also owns the property next door, on which he’s building another contemporary mansion. He also has construction projects in the Bird Streets and Beverly Hills Post Office neighborhoods. And through various LVMH holding companies, he owns a massive chunk of Beverly Hills’ famed Rodeo Drive. In December, LVMH bought the Luxe Hotel for $200 million.

The 73-year-old real estate developer and business mogul is the richest man in Europe and third-richest in the world, worth $141 billion, according to Forbes. He oversees the LVMH empire of some 75 fashion and cosmetics brands, including Louis Vuitton and Sephora.

In January 2021, LVMH acquired American jeweler Tiffany & Co for $15.8 billion, believed to be the biggest luxury brand acquisition ever.

Tag Heuer watches to display NFTs: The ultimate status symbol? - Vogue Business,"Wed, 15 Jun 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZvZ3VlYnVzaW5lc3MuY29tL3RlY2hub2xvZ3kvdGFnLWhldWVyLXdhdGNoZXMtdG8tZGlzcGxheS1uZnRzLXRoZS11bHRpbWF0ZS1zdGF0dXMtc3ltYm9s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"To receive the Vogue Business newsletter, sign up here.

Tag Heuer was an early mover in the luxury sector with the introduction of crypto payments on its US website. Now, the LVMH-owned Swiss luxury watchmaker is taking the lead again, with the addition of a connection to a crypto wallet allowing users to display their NFTs on the face of their smartwatch.

The new functionality is being added to the Tag Heuer Connected Calibre E4 smartwatch, and will also be available as a free update for smartwatch owners via Apple’s App Store and Google’s Play Store. Users can securely connect to crypto wallets such as Metamask or Ledger Live. The watch face has three ways to display time while showcasing NFT artworks, operating with all the collections on Ethereum.

Tag Heuer CEO Frédéric Arnault believes that an NFT display will be an attractive add-on for watch owners. “Not launching our own NFT collection but allowing collectors to use their NFTs in a new way was the most obvious first step. We speak to all passionate collectors,” he says.

Arnault, son of LVMH chairman Bernard Arnault, will be using the functionality himself: he recently bought a NFT from Bored Apes — an Ape with an eyepatch and diamond grin.

Modern-day Daft Punks?

Tag Heuer worked closely with a flurry of collectors to fine tune the new functionality. Some of them have lent their NFTs for a campaign backing the launch. A fully digital campaign will focus on Twitter. Discord, an invite-only social media platform, and physical events might follow at a later stage. Despite the huge number of Twitter followers and high-profile personalities within the community, many NFT collectors prefer to stay anonymous. “They are the modern-day Daft Punk,” says Guillaume Mathias, Tag Heuer product manager, referencing the 1990s’ French electronic music duo who wore helmets to preserve their identities.

The watch industry has been an early supporter of Web3, with executives eager to encourage the spending power of newly wealthy crypto investors by developing a collector spirit. Hublot, Bulgari and Breitling have all issued NFTs."
Protestors stormed one of Toronto's expensive retail stores and staff were confused - blogTO,"Mon, 20 Jun 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJsb2d0by5jb20vY2l0eS8yMDIyLzA2L3Byb3Rlc3RzLXRvcm9udG8tZGlvci1sb3Vpcy12dWl0dG9uLWJsb29yL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"People were protesting loudly inside some of Toronto's most expensive luxury stores last week, catching suprised staff off guard.

This protest wasn't over vaccines or other restrictions like so many have been over recent years: it was about fur.

Fur Free Toronto and Direct Action Everywhere Toronto stormed Dior and Tiffany & Co. on Bloor West in Yorkville to try to put pressure on them to adopt a fur-free policy, shouting and holding up signs while staff watched on silently.

Both brands are a part of multi-million dollar conglomerate LVMH, which is being targeted internationally by activist groups to pressure them into going fur-free.

""LVMH, it's time to drop fur now,"" the protesters said in a speech given inside the Tiffany store with staff listening.

""LVMH continues to profit from the torture and killing of fur-bearing animals. Enough is enough. It's time LVMH join the long list of luxury designers who've done away with fur.""

LVMH oversees some of the world's biggest brands like Louis Vuitton and Hennessey, and was described as ""notoriously pro-fur"" in the speech given by protesters.

The protesters also spoke out with megaphones in front of the Louis Vuitton store in the same area.

Luxury brands that have banned the use of fur include Burberry, Gucci, Chanel, Prada, Coach and Jimmy Choo."
Leading luxury players bet blockchain can advance circular fashion - Vogue Business,"Mon, 06 Jun 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZvZ3VlYnVzaW5lc3MuY29tL3N1c3RhaW5hYmlsaXR5L2xlYWRpbmctbHV4dXJ5LXBsYXllcnMtYmV0LWJsb2NrY2hhaW4tY2FuLWFkdmFuY2UtY2lyY3VsYXItZmFzaGlvbtIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"To become a Vogue Business Member and receive the Sustainability Edit newsletter, click here.

To make circular fashion, from resale to recycling and repairs, convenient and profitable, luxury is betting on blockchain to track items and keep them in rotation longer without eroding consumer trust as product changes hands.

A new partnership between luxury’s Aura Blockchain Consortium and The Sustainable Markets Initiative Fashion Task Force, the coalition chaired by the founder of Yoox and former CEO of Yoox Net-a-Porter Group Federico Marchetti, signals luxury’s ambitions towards this are gaining traction, as well as validating the blockchain as a necessary tool in making circular fashion a reality.

The task force was launched in 2021 under the Sustainable Markets Initiative, a private-sector coalition launched by Prince Charles in 2020 to promote circularity and regenerative agriculture. Members include Brunello Cucinelli, Burberry, Chloé, Gabriela Hearst, Giorgio Armani, Moda Operandi, Mulberry, Vestiaire Collective and Zalando.

A major milestone was the Digital ID launched last October that tags products and records details about their manufacturing and sustainability credentials, allowing brands to share information with customers about a luxury item’s supply chain, an offering that meets consumer interest in sustainability and regulators’ interest in greenwashing and supply chain due diligence. It can also be used to preserve the identity of a product beyond the initial point of sale, needed for circular services from resale to recycling.

The collaboration with Aura, which was founded in April 2021 by LVMH, Prada Group and Cartier, will take those services to the next level by providing additional convenience and security, and enabling those details to be transferable with the products they’re associated with, says Daniela Ott, general secretary of Aura Blockchain Consortium. Brands can have suppliers write details from different stages of production — where leather originated from when it arrives at a tannery before being turned into a handbag, for example — into the blockchain, in a simple, easy-to-understand manner. The blockchain stores those details in an “immutable” way, Ott explains, and brands can then share it with customers in whatever format they choose — an RFID chip or QR code, perhaps. “I can see, ‘This handbag was produced six months ago; this is where the leather came from, it was produced in Italy — and I can get access to all that information’. And you cannot falsify this information,” she explains."

End Clothing has hired former LVMH executive Parker Gundersen as its new CEO to oversee its “next phase of growth”.

Gunderson succeeds founders Christiaan Ashworth and John Parker, who “will remain in key positions” on the board of directors.

The move follows private equity firm Carlyle taking a majority stake in Newcastle-based streetwear retailer End last year.

Gundersen was president of retail operations at LVMH subsidiary DFS Group, and was previous CEO of southeast Asia’s equivalent of Asos, Zalora.

Gunderson has over 20 years of leadership experience spanning retail, luxury, ecommerce and strategy consulting.

Founders Ashworth and Parker said: “End has continued to advance its strategic growth plans since the investment by Carlyle.

“In the last year we have substantially increased our capabilities in digital and marketing, opened a new flagship store in Newcastle, built out our senior leadership team, launched our womenswear platform and continued to develop our unique relationship with brands and customers alike.

“We feel the time is right to transition fully to the board and support the next generation of leaders in continuing to develop the End brand, curation, community and platform on a global stage.

“Parker’s unique background in international luxury retail, as well as his expertise in both offline and online channels, makes him particularly well-suited for this position.”

Both Ashworth and Parker will continue to “play active roles on the board and support the team in realising key strategic growth initiatives”.

Ashworth will become vice chairman of End Clothing and work closely with current chairman, former Gucci boss Patrizio di Marco, who joined the retailer last year.

Gundersen is set to take the CEO role during the summer but takes a seat on End Clothing’s board immediately.
