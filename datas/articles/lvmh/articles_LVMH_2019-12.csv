LVMH buys control of Whispering Angel producer Château d’Esclans - Decanter.com,"Mon, 02 Dec 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlY2FudGVyLmNvbS93aW5lLW5ld3MvbHZtaC1kLWVzY2xhbnMtd2hpc3BlcmluZy1hbmdlbC1yb3NlLTQyODQ2MC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LVMH’s Moët Hennessy business has acquired 55% of Château d’Esclans, which produces the popular Whispering Angel rosé wine in the Var area of Provence.

Sacha Lichine, president of d’Esclans and who has been instrumental in establishing its reputation, has retained the other 45% stake and will run the estate in partnership with Moët Hennessy, said a joint-statement by both parties.

Lichine sold a 5% share of d’Esclans and his business partner since 2008, Alix AM PTE Limited, has sold its entire 50% share. Financial details were not disclosed.

Moët Hennessy also bought Château du Galoupet in Provence earlier this year, and the two deals underline the growing popularity and rising prestige of rosé wines from this part of southern France.

D’Esclans joins a portfolio that includes Château d’Yquem and Cheval Blanc in Bordeaux, plus Krug and Dom Pérignon in Champagne, among others.

Vineyard expansion

There are plans to significantly expand the d’Esclans vineyard.

The 267-hectare estate currently has 74 hectares of Côtes de Provence appellation vines and ‘the vineyard will be extended soon to include an additional 60 hectares of vines of the same quality,’ said the new ownership team.

‘Delighted by the alliance’

‘I am delighted by the alliance with Moët Hennessy and the ability, through the backing of this great group, to continue to develop the estate in producing excellent Provence rosés,’ said Lichine, who bought d’Esclans in 2006 and who’s family previously owned Château Prieuré Lichine in Bordeaux’s Margaux appellation.

He said that his aim had always been to produce rosé in the style of a fine wine.

Whispering Angel is today one of the world’s best-selling rosé wines, with no shortage of celebrity fans.

But d’Esclans also makes ‘Garrus’ – one of the most expensive rosés on the market – as well as a rosé under its estate name plus those under the ‘Les Clans’ and ‘Rock Angel’ labels.

Philippe Schaus, CEO of Moët Hennessy, said, ‘Sacha Lichine revolutionised the world of Provence rosé wines and its international development.’

He added, ‘Moët Hennessy will bring the full support of our worldwide teams to assist Sacha Lichine to continue this marvelous adventure.’

The news rounds off a busy week for LVMH owner Bernard Arnault, after it was announced that the luxury goods group had agreed to buy high-end jeweler Tiffany & Co in a deal worth €14.7bn ($16.2bn).

"2019, the year in which LVMH had breakfast at Tiffany's | MDS - MDS","Fri, 27 Dec 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZW1kcy5jb20vY29tcGFuaWVzLzIwMTktdGhlLXllYXItaW4td2hpY2gtbHZtaC1oYWQtYnJlYWtmYXN0LWF0LXRpZmZhbnlzLmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Luxury’s throne wrapped in a blue box. LVMH ended in 2019 the largest operation in its history, the acquisition of Tiffany, which not only made it the owner of one of the last independent American luxury companies, but also added geographic and product diversification and, above all, more distance with its rivals on the global podium.

After months of negotiations, the group finally agreed to pay 16.2 billion dollars to take over all Tiffany’s shares, valuing the company’s total at 16.6 times its ebitda. The agreement broke the historical record in the sector, marked by LVMH itself, when it acquired Christian Dior Couture from Groupe Arnault for 13 billion euros.

Tiffany’s profile is just as Bernard Arnault likes: volume, global presence and, above all, a great story that sustains the brand. In the statement announcing its purchase, LVMH highlighted five Tiffany keys to justify the acquisition: that it is a “legendary”and historical American brand, which has a “rich” cultural heritage, a diversified portfolio, a controlled and global distribution and an integrated and increasingly sustainable value chain.

LVMH finally agreed to acquire Tiffany for 16.2 billion dollars

Tiffany ended its fiscal year 2018 with sales of 4.4 billion dollars and an ebitda of 1 billion dollars. The company generates more than half of its turnover with fashion jewelry collections, another 26% with rings and the rest with designer collections. Tiffany’s distribution is global, with 321 stores in more than 20 countries. About 44% of its sales come from America, another 28% from Asia Pacific and 15% from Japan.

In addition, as LVMH points out, Tiffany has a strong link with the history of jewelry, which dates back to when Charles Louis Tiffany, its founder, bought the jewels of the French crown to make a necklace for JP Morgan. Since then, the brand has transcended its sector to become an icon of popular culture: from Truman Capote’s novel adapted to the cinema Breakfast at Tiffany’s, to its blue boxes, whose color is registered, or its flagship store on Fifth Avenue.

The goal of LVMH is to continue the strategy of Alessandro Bogliolo, who was appointed by Tiffany in 2018 coming from Diesel, and which includes: amplifying an evolved brand message; renew the offer and improve the presentation in store; offer an omnichannel experience; improve the competitive position; create a more efficient operating model and an agile organization.

The goal of LVMH is to continue Alessandro Bogliolo’s strategy

If for Tiffany the operation is an opportunity to accelerate its growth, leveraged in the resources and structure of LVMH, for the French group it will be a boost for its watchmaking division, composed of Chaumet, Tag Heuer, Zenith, Bulgari, Fred and Hublot. According to the forecasts of the group, this business division, which currently accounts for 9% of its sales and 7% of its operating profit, would advance that of alcoholic beverages after the purchase of Tiffany, representing 16% of turnover and sales, 13% of the operating result.

“LVMH will become a global operator in high jewelry,” the group said in the statement, in a direct nod to one of its rivals, Richemont, which concentrates most of its portfolio in this category.

With this acquisition, LVMH also reinforced its commitment to the American market. In 2019, and in the middle of trade war between China and the United States, the luxury holding opened a new bag and leather goods factory in Texas, which began construction in 2017, a few months after Donald Trump arrived at the White House. At the opening, Trump himself and his daughter and advisor, Ivanka Trump, were present, as well as Louis Vuitton chief executive officer Michael Burke.

Beyond Tiffany

The acquisition of Tiffany eclipsed other relevant corporate operations of LVMH in 2019: the launch of its first brand with Christian Lacroix, the relaunch of a historic firm and the joint venture with one of the jewels of its rival, Kering.

The luxury holding opened a new bag and leather goods factory in Texas

After the successful launch of Fenty Beauty in 2018, channeled through the group’s cosmetic incubator, Kendo, the company wanted to capitalize on the pull of singer Rihanna with a new signature, this time in fashion. The brand, which started in May, distributes clothing, footwear and accessories and is only available online, although for its launch it also opened a pop up store in Paris. It was the first brand that LVMH created from scratch in more than three decades, since the launch in 1987 of Christian Lacroix.

Stella McCartney, a pioneer in sustainability in luxury, broke her alliance with François Henri Pinault’s group in 2018 and, less than a year later, moved to Arnault’s team. The company created a joint venture with LVMH, which acquired a minority stake, and McCartney joined the group team as a sustainability advisor.

At the same time, LVMH continued with its usual acquisitions strategy, both for emerging and historical brands. After taking control of Jean Patou at the end of 2018, the holding relaunched the firm in 2019 under the name of Patou and with Guillaume Henry as the new creative director. The group also acquired a stake in Uruguayan brand Gabriela Hearst in 2019, founded in 2015 based in New York, and in the start-up MadHappy, specialized in unisex garments. Both investments were made through his LVMH Luxury Ventures arm.

The company launched Aura platform, which uses blockchain to verify the authenticity of its brands’ products

LVMH also kept its commitment to digitalization. The company launched Aura platform, which uses blockchain to verify the authenticity of its brands’ products and track the entire supply chain. The system, developed by Ethereum ConsenSys and Microsoft Azure, has already been tested in Louis Vuitton and Christian Dior Parfums.

In addition, the company renewed its multibrand ecommerce platform, 24Sèvres, which changed its name to 24S to boost its internationalization and diversified its offer with the introduction of menswear collections.

LVMH ended its fiscal year 2018 with a turnover of 46.2 billion euros, up 10%, and a profit of 6.3 billion euros, up 18% year-on-year. Despite the crisis in Hong Kong, one of the main luxury markets in the world, the company continued to grow during 2019, up 16% in the first nine months, to 5 billion euros, although in a statement the group acknowledged that the environment was “uncertain.”

Kering and Richemont, considering acquisitions to stay in control

Its rivals reacted to Louis Vuitton owner’s acquisitions with more acquisitions. Kering, owner of Gucci and Saint Laurent, began negotiations to acquire Moncler, after a few years of divestments to turn to the luxury business. The company, led by Remo Ruffini, is one of the biggest phenomena in the sector in recent years and is valued at 9.8 billion euros.

LVMH ended its fiscal year 2018 with a revenue of 46.8 billion euros, up 10%

Richemont, on the other hand, continues its journey with a portfolio composed mainly of jewelry brands, such as Cartier and Van Cleef&Arpels, and the largest ecommerce group in the sector, Yoox Net-a-Porter. In 2019, the company acquired historic jewelry company Buccellati, until then controlled by the Chinese group Gangtai Group.

But the king is still far away: Kering ended 2018 with a revenue of 13.6 billion euros, up 26.3%, and kept pace in the first nine months of 2019 with an increase of 27.1%. Richemont, on the other hand, reached a revenue of 13.9 billion euros in 2018, up 27% year-on-year, boosted by Asia and Yoox Net-a-Porter."
"LVMH, Kering, L'Oréal to bear brunt of proposed US tariffs on French goods - spglobal.com","Tue, 03 Dec 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiqAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5zcGdsb2JhbC5jb20vbWFya2V0aW50ZWxsaWdlbmNlL2VuL25ld3MtaW5zaWdodHMvbGF0ZXN0LW5ld3MtaGVhZGxpbmVzL2x2bWgta2VyaW5nLWwtb3ItMjMzLWFsLXRvLWJlYXItYnJ1bnQtb2YtcHJvcG9zZWQtdXMtdGFyaWZmcy1vbi1mcmVuY2gtZ29vZHMtNTU5MTE5ODfSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"French luxury companies' stocks slipped Dec. 3 after the U.S. threatened to impose 100% tariffs on $2.4 billion of French products, including handbags, Champagne and cosmetics.

The Paris-listed shares of LVMH Moët Hennessy - Louis Vuitton Société Européenne and Kering SA closed down 1.5% and 2.1%, respectively. Hermès International Société en commandite par actions' stock dropped 2.3%, and L'Oréal SA pared early losses to close down 0.3%.

According to an analysis of shipping and freight data by Panjiva, a business line of S&P Global Market Intelligence, total U.S. imports of the 63 products covered by the proposed tariffs were worth $2.38 billion in the 12 months to Sept. 30, equivalent to about 4% of total imports from France. The biggest imports in that period were French beauty products worth $842 million, Champagne worth $806 million, handbags worth $434 million and dairy products worth $202 million.

The tariffs represent a potential triple hit to LVMH, the world's largest luxury company and maker of various high-end handbags, cosmetics, as well as Champagne brands such as Moët & Chandon, Dom Perignon and Veuve Clicquot. In the 12 months to Oct. 31, LVMH shipped 420 TEUs of Champagne to the U.S., according to Panjiva. (A TEU, or twenty-foot equivalent unit, is a measure of a ship's cargo-carrying capacity.) The French company's other shipments to the U.S. included Christian Dior and Sephora cosmetics, and its Celine brand of handbags, which would also be affected. However, it was not immediately clear whether other LVMH products, such as its signature brown designer handbags, also would be subject to the proposed tariffs.

The tariff proposal comes just a week after LVMH significantly boosted its exposure to the U.S. market by agreeing to acquire American jeweler Tiffany & Co. for $16.2 billion. It also follows the Oct. 18 opening of a new 100,000-square-foot Louis Vuitton factory in Alvarado, Texas, inaugurated by President Donald Trump. LVMH did not respond to a request for comment.

Regarding imported French beauty products, L'Oréal was the largest supplier with 2,640 shipments in the 12 months to Oct. 31, boosted by a 23% surge in the last three months of that period, Panjiva data shows. L'Oréal makes a wide range of cosmetics, including the Lancome range. L'Oréal did not respond to a request for comment.

The proposed tariffs are the latest challenge to French luxury companies, which have been hurt by volatile anti-government protests in the key market of Hong Kong, a slowdown in the economy of mainland China as well as other international trade tensions.

On Oct. 24, Kering, owner of Gucci and Yves Saint Laurent, reported a robust 14.2% jump in third-quarter revenue. But in a conference call the same day, Kering CFO Jean-Marc Duplaix sounded a note of caution, noting that ""the world around us is not getting easier to make sense of and to forecast."" In a similar earnings-related call Oct. 10, LVMH reported a 17% jump in revenue for the third quarter but said it was ""cautiously confident for the rest of the year.""

In a 2019 report, Deloitte said the outlook for the global luxury goods industry was positive. However, it noted that the United States' ""recent adoption of protectionist policies, the implementation of fiscal policies, tighter monetary policy and restrictive trade policy have resulted in slower consumer spending, higher consumer prices, and disrupted global supply chains.""

The new U.S. tariffs, if applied, could affect other big French luxury goods companies, too, depending on the scale of their annual shipments to the U.S. Kering, for example, sells Gucci and Bottega Veneta handbags to U.S. consumers, while Hermès is famous for its Birkin handbags, which can cost anywhere from $9,550 to $300,000. Closely held Chanel SA sells cosmetic and beauty products. Kering, Hermès and Chanel did not respond to requests for comment.

For now, there will be a period of negotiation between the U.S. and the EU, and hearings will be held in early January. Any tariffs on French luxury goods are unlikely to come into effect until late January at the earliest."
Louis Vuitton LVMH owner Bernard Arnault loses $1.6 billion in one day on Trump's French tariffs threat - CBS News,"Tue, 03 Dec 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNic25ld3MuY29tL25ld3MvbG91aXMtdnVpdHRvbi1sdm1oLW93bmVyLWJlcm5hcmQtYXJuYXVsdC1sb3Nlcy0xLTYtYmlsbGlvbi1vbi1wcm9wb3NlZC10cnVtcC10YXJpZmZzL9IBdmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNic25ld3MuY29tL2FtcC9uZXdzL2xvdWlzLXZ1aXR0b24tbHZtaC1vd25lci1iZXJuYXJkLWFybmF1bHQtbG9zZXMtMS02LWJpbGxpb24tb24tcHJvcG9zZWQtdHJ1bXAtdGFyaWZmcy8?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The billionaire owner of French luxury group LVMH lost a mini fortune — about $1.6 billion — the day after President Donald Trump targeted high-end French goods like Louis Vuitton bags and Moët champagne with U.S. tariffs.

Mr. Trump vowed Monday to impose tariffs of up to 100% on $2.4 billion in French goods like Champagne, cheese and handbags in retaliation for France's tax on digital services targeting U.S. tech giants such as Google, Facebook and Amazon.

Mr. Trump's threat particularly hurt publicly traded LVMH, one of the world's largest Champagne producers under French winery Moët & Chandon. The luxury products group — 50% owned by Chairman and CEO Bernard Arnault and his family — also makes and sells such distinctive fashion brands as Bulgari, Christian Dior, Fendi and Marc Jacobs.

LVMH shares fell 1.5% during Tuesday trading in Paris, costing Arnault around $1.6 billion in a single day, according to FactSet data. The total value of his LVMH holdings was $104 billion on Tuesday, down from $108 billion at the end of Friday as trade tensions between France and the U.S. began simmering over the weekend.

Arnault had been on a roll just a week earlier, seeing his net worth jump after LVMH agreed to buy iconic Manhattan jeweler Tiffany's for $16 billion. According to Forbes' ranking of the world's richest billionaires, the purchase boosted LVMH shares and briefly vaulted Arnault into the No. 2 slot with an estimated net worth of $107.8 billion, slightly ahead of Microsoft founder Bill Gates, whose net worth Forbes pegged at $107.5 billion last week. It also put the French mogul within striking distance of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, No. 1 on the list with an estimated net worth of roughly $112 billion last week.

According to both Forbes' and Bloomberg's ranking of world billionaires, Arnault still sits comfortably with the status of the world's third richest billionaire.

The trio also have a clear lead over other billionaires. The next three ultra-wealthy figures on Forbes's list — investor Warren Buffett, Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg and Oracle's Larry Ellison — are worth roughly $86 billion, $73 billion and $69 billion, respectively.

Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who is now piling some of his money into running for president, lands at No. 14, with a net worth of $54 billion, while Francoise Bettencourt Meyers and her family — heirs to the L'Oreal cosmetics fortune — rank No. 12 at roughly $55 billion.

LVMH’s Champagne strategy drives innovation and new consumption occasions for the category - IWSR,"Thu, 19 Dec 2019 19:17:52 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiMWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWl3c3IuY29tL2x2bWhzLWNoYW1wYWduZS1zdHJhdGVneS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The Champagne category has long lived a double life with its prestigious brand houses co-existing with a lower-priced market comprised of grower brands, supermarket own-labels and tertiary brands. Increasingly, the market is skewing toward the former and value creation is now the name of the game. As ever, this development is led by the Champagne leader, LVMH.

LVMH said in October that Champagne volumes were down slightly in the first nine months of its fiscal year. While all regions grew in the nine-month period, the main contributors were Japan and Europe. Prestige cuvées performed particularly well, including the successful launch of Dom Pérignon Plénitude in 2019. LVMH CFO Jean-Jacques Guiony told analysts that the pattern of the growth was mostly based on price mix and not on volumes.

Moët Hennessy USA Chief Marketing Officer and Executive Vice-President, Vanessa Kay, remarks, “we have always operated on a value-based model. Champagne supply will always be limited and we expect growth to be driven by innovation such as Moët Ice and Veuve Clicquot Rich, and from other emerging qualities such as our rosé Champagnes.”

LVMH is leading the push upmarket through creative marketing initiatives and partnerships. Moët Hennessy UK Managing Director Bertrand Steip adds, “as a business there is a need to follow a value-creation strategy for our brands, and we believe that consumer experience is central to the buying experience.” This Christmas, Veuve Clicquot will be the first Champagne brand to launch a concept store in upmarket department store Selfridges in London.

Steip says it will encompass both personalised gifting and an opportunity to sample products at a bar installation. “At this heightened time of shopping, we are looking to create a memorable experience for consumers beyond just a shopping transaction,” Steip explains.

Champagne does well in the US despite the threat of tariffs

The US excluded Champagne from the recent list when it announced, in October 2019, punitive tariffs of 25% on goods including European wine and single malt Scotch, but it seems likely Champagne could be targeted in the future should there be an escalation, and was cited by the US President as a potential future target.

Despite this existential threat, Champagne is riding high in the US, with widespread consumer trade-up. The good news is that Champagne remains highly aspirational in the US, despite competition from high-quality local sparklers, and is associated with prestige, sophistication and celebration. Champagne has a strong reputation and strong penetration among Americans aged 21 to 34.

Expanding the Champagne occasion

Kay of Moët Hennessy USA explains that the major challenge in the US is making Champagne more of an everyday drink. “There has been a growth in the Champagne category. We see lots of opportunities in increasing Champagne consumption and the breaking down of stereotypes associated with only consuming Champagne on special occasions, such as New Year’s eve.”

“While consumers continue to enjoy our Champagnes during special occasions, they are also increasingly looking for opportunities to enjoy our them through a variety of other moments. We see that it’s gone beyond celebrations and become more multifaceted. Yes, approximately 20% of Champagne occasions are associated with celebration. However, the remaining 80% are paired with food, date night, chilling out, year-round personal celebrations, and catching up.”

“Moët & Chandon, for example, has a unique range of wines that satisfy a wide variety of consumption moments, such as a meaningful brunch with friends, a romantic night out, or a glass of Moët Ice Imperial to celebrate the summer season. Consumer education continues to be very important in order to teach consumers that Champagne is a wine and we have a wine in the portfolio for every occasion. At the same time, we are absolutely seeing consumers choose Veuve Clicquot for both formal and informal occasions.”

Americans are now opting to toast life’s smaller moments with Champagne, even if just a weeknight dinner with friends.

“While Champagne is still very popular in the US for the holidays and milestone moments, Americans are now opting to toast life’s smaller moments with Champagne, even if just a weeknight dinner with friends. Much of this is driven by rosé Champagne, which consumers tend to appreciate year-round because of how well it pairs with meals and brings people together. The Champagne brands within our portfolio are each unique in their own styles as well as positioning in the market. Each marque is appealing for different occasions.”

Maintaining relevance and innovation

The Champagne houses are working hard to ensure that they retain relevance with this millennial cohort by attempting to remain top-of-mind with the mixologist community. Steip says, “cocktails are another area of innovation, from aperitifs during eating-out occasions to personalising and diversifying how Champagne is consumed, and of course providing additional spontaneous consumption opportunities. As a category leader, Moët & Chandon has been leading these innovations with cocktail bartender engagement programmes which have included re-introducing the ‘bartender’s handshake’ and offering consumers an amuse bouche of Champagne as they wait for their cocktail.”

In the UK, Moët & Chandon has been present at the Cocktails in the City pop-up event for the past two years, and this year was the official partner of London Cocktail Week as it celebrated its 10th anniversary. Steip adds, “using Champagne cocktails as a way to tap into cultural events that attract consumers after new drinking experiences has proved very successful in innovating the way Champagne is perceived.”

Kay of Moët Hennessy USA adds, “over the last few years, rosé in general has gained popularity, in the US. It has been a great vehicle for us to recruit new consumers and introduce our rosé Champagnes to a new target market. We continue to innovate with our rosé offerings with Moët Ice Rosé , and Veuve Clicquot Rich Rosé.”

In 2019, LVMH also acquired Château du Galoupet, Cru Classé des Côtes-de-Provence since 1955. Château du Galoupet produces a renowned rosé wine, combining ancestral methods and technical precision, adhering to the strict requirements of Provence.

Collaborations and marketing initiatives drive sustained differentiation

2019 was an important milestone for Moët & Chandon as it marked 150 years since the first release Moët Brut Impérial – today the global Champagne leader. Launch activity has spanned the globe, kickstarted by a launch event in May at Chateau de Saran to what is now the group’s focus for Christmas, a limited-edition anniversary bottle and gift packs with enhanced in-store visibility across all channels.

June also saw the re-opening of the historic Château de Saran after an extensive five-year refurbishment. Acquired by Jean-Remy Moët in 1801, this building began life as a hunting lodge, and the Château de Saran is destined once more to become the site of festive celebrations. The June launch night attracted global celebrities and friends of the brand from Rodger Federer, Moet & Chandon’s long standing ambassador, to actress Natalie Portman and the icon Kate Moss.

There have been marketing initiatives aimed at keeping its very high-end brand equities relevant. Steip explains, “the appointment of Lenny Kravitz as the Creative Director for Dom Perignon has been key in showcasing the creativity of the brand and ensuring stand and cultural relevancy through a strong global campaign featuring creative personalities from different industries and disciplines.”

“Finally, Krug has long cultivated its link between music and Champagne creation. Over the years our Krug Encounters activations have worked with tastemakers from The Clash’s Mick Jones to iconic singer Neneh Cherry: all partnerships to elevate the brand past the purely transactional sphere, into meaningful experiences that differentiate us and drive desirability.”

LVMH Buys Majority Stake In Whispering Angel Producer Château d'Esclans - VinePair,"Mon, 02 Dec 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vdmluZXBhaXIuY29tL2Jvb3plLW5ld3MvbHZtaC1idXlzLXdoaXNwZXJpbmctYW5nZWwtbWFqb3JpdHktc3Rha2Uv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Moët Hennessy, the wine and spirits division of luxury French conglomerate LVMH, has acquired a majority stake in Château d’Esclans, the producer of the world famous Whispering Angel rosé.

Whispering Angel has been credited with launching an international rosé trend that introduced pink wine to American palates. Its wines are sold in more than 100 countries and accounts for nearly 20 percent of all the Provençal rosé consumed in the U.S.

Announced on Monday, the deal sees Moët Hennessy gain 55 percent of Château d’Esclans, while the winery’s president Sasha Lichine will retain a 45 percent stake in the company. According to Decanter, Lichine will run the company in partnership with Moët Hennessy, with the group planning an imminent expansion of its Provençal vineyard holdings.

“I am delighted by the alliance with Moët Hennessy and the ability, through the backing of this great group, to continue to develop the estate in producing excellent Provence rosés,” Lichine told Decanter.

In addition to Whispering Angel, Château d’Esclans also produces Garrus, one of the most expensive rosés on the market, with an average price of $102 per bottle.

Château d’Esclans joins LVMH’s already impressive portfolio of wine brands, which famously includes Château d’Yquem, Château Cheval Blanc, Krug, and Dom Pérignon.

The deal comes several months after Moët Hennessy also acquired Château du Galoupet, another Provence-based producer of rosé wines, showing that the pink wine trend isn’t going anywhere fast."

(TIF) after improving its offer to $16.2 billion.

The agreement, announced Monday, Nov. 25, values the target at $135 per share, up 12.5% from an initial bid of $120 per share that was rejected but proved sufficient to form the basis for talks.

The new offer equates to a 7.5% premium to Tiffany’s closing price of $125.51 on Friday and is more than 50% higher than its share price of $98.55 on Oct. 25, the day before reports of LVMH’s interest first emerged.

“Following a strategic review that included a thoughtful internal process and expert external advice, the board has concluded that this transaction with LVMH provides an exciting path forward with a group that appreciates and will invest in Tiffany’s unique assets and strong human capital, while delivering a compelling price with value certainty to our shareholders,” said Tiffany Chairman Roger N. Farah in a statement.

LVMH, the world’s biggest seller of luxury goods, will add New York-based Tiffany to its Watches & Jewelry division, where it will sit alongside brands including Bulgari, TAG Heuer and Chaumet. The purchase is the biggest ever by LVMH, which has been a regular buyer of luxury brands and more recently luxury experiences, with this year’s $2.6 billion acquisition of hotelier and travel group Belmond Ltd.

Fred was founded in 1936 by Argentine-born designer Fred Samuel. The founder was one of the first designers to ever work with precious stones like pearls. The jewelry company’s signature piece is the Force 10 bracelet, created in 1966 that reflects the maritime influence of the brand.

LVMH has given a new life to the heritage brand with new openings in Asia and a new leader. Fred’s chief executive officer is Charles Leung, appointed in July to lead the expansion of the brand in Asia with an eye set on the new generations.

LVMH, which recently acquired American jewelry company Tiffany for 16.2 billion dollars, closed the first nine months of its fiscal year 2019 with an increase of 16% in sales, to 38.9 billion euros. Its organic revenue, on the other hand, grew 11%.

The Paris-based company’s store is located in the biggest shopping malls in Sydney. Run by Scentre Group, the Sydney Westfield is in the city’s central business district it has six floors and a total commercial area of 1,807,380 square feet.

The shopping mall is the result of a transformation plan of 860 million dollars. The spot was once occupied by Centerpoint Shopping Center that redeveloped into the name it currently holds. The shopping center has space for approximately 360 brands."

Safilo's Sales Hit After Losing LVMH Brands - The Business of Fashion,"Thu, 12 Dec 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzb2ZmYXNoaW9uLmNvbS9uZXdzL3JldGFpbC9zYWZpbG9zLXNhbGVzLWhpdC1hZnRlci1sb3NpbmctbHZtaC1icmFuZHMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"MILAN, Italy — Italian eyewear maker Safilo said on Wednesday it expected the loss of licences with luxury LVMH brands to wipe €200 million ($220 million) off its annual sales and it would cancel its dividend for five years, sending its shares plunging almost 22 percent.

The stock surrendered to profit taking after it gained more than 60 percent in the last month, a Milan-based analyst said, adding some of the targets in the business plan announced late on Tuesday could prove challenging to meet.

The stock had reacted positively early on Tuesday after Safilo said it had renewed a licence with Marc Jacobs which would run until 2026.

The company is due to lose licences with LVMH brands Dior from January 1 2021, and Fendi from July 1 2021 after LVMH set up a design and manufacturing joint venture with rival spectacles maker Marcolin, giving the French group more control over its prestigious eyewear brands. In addition, Safilo could lose the licence for Givenchy, which is also part of LVMH.

The exit of the three LVMH brands will result in a hit to sales of €200 million, mostly falling in 2021, Safilo's chief financial officer said on Wednesday during a conference call with analysts on the business plan.

The group had net sales in 2018 of €963 million.

On Tuesday, when presenting its 2020-2024 business plan Safilo said it would cut 700 jobs in Italy next year, or more than 10 percent of its global workforce and it faced €50 million restructuring costs between 2020 and 2024.

It also lowered its 2020 net revenue forecast to between €960 million and €1 billion, from a previous estimate of €1-1.2 billion and said it sees a compound annual growth rate between 2020 and 2024 of 1-2 percent.

The previous day, however, Safilo said it would buy 70 percent of US surf and ski sunglasses brand Blenders Eyewear, in a deal valuing the company at $90 million and increasing Safilo's exposure to online sales. E-commerce currently accounts for only 3 percent of Safilo's total revenue.

""Our first impression is that mid-term targets are fully aimed at recovering in four years the business to be lost with LVMH,"" an analyst for Mediobanca Securities said in a report.

""If Blenders Eyewear is included in FY 2020 targets as we assume, this means a four-year growth of the top line of 5.7 percent-7 percent, a target which may be optimistic,"" the analyst said.

Safilo faces increasingly stiff competition — domestic rival Luxottica last year closed a merger with the world's biggest lens manufacturer, Essilor, to create eyewear giant EssilorLuxottica.

LVMH relaunches Patou one year after its acquisition - MDS,"Mon, 02 Dec 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZW1kcy5jb20vY29tcGFuaWVzL2x2bWgtcmVsYXVuY2hlcy1wYXRvdS1vbmUteWVhci1hZnRlci1pdHMtYWNxdWlzaXRpb24uaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Patou’s rebirth. The historic company, founded in 1912 by the French perfume manufacturer Alexandre Jean Patou, has just launched its first collection by the designer Guillaume Henry a year after LVMH acquired it.

The company is already present in around eighty points of sale worldwide, including corners in department stores like Galeries Lafayette, Le Bon Marché, Selfridges or 10 Corso Como. Also, the company has launched its ecommerce platform. Patou explained that the company will not be present in online platforms, except for 24S, owned by LVMH.

Patou will only be distributed online through its ecommerce and 24S platform

The French luxury holding acquired the historic company in September 2018 with the aim of relaunching the brand and focusing on the fashion segment. Until then, the company had been doing perfumery for eight decades.

Following the acquisition of Jean Patou, LVMH appointed designer Guillaume Henry as the company’s creative director. Shortly after the holding carried out a makeover of the brand, which meant changing the name to Patou.

Jean Patou was founded in 1912 by the French designer of the same name as a small sewing workshop in Paris. The company gained popularity thanks to partnerships with celebrities of the time, such as Elsa Maxwell or the Wimbledon tournament, for which Patou designed several uniforms.

After the acquisition, LVMH changed the name and brand image of Patou

After the Great Depression, the brand focused on perfumes, especially Joy, created in 1935. In 2001, Jean Patou was acquired by Procter&Gamble, which ten years later sold it to Designer Parfums, owned by the Indian family Mehta.

LVMH ended the first nine months of the year with a revenue of 38.9 billion euros, up 16% from the same period year-on-year. By product categories, fashion and leather goods continue to be the main segment by revenue, after growing 22% in the first nine months, to 15.8 billion euros."
Kering LVMH Rivalry Set to Intensify with Moncler Tiffany Acquisitions - Jing Daily,"Mon, 09 Dec 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vamluZ2RhaWx5LmNvbS9wb3N0cy9rZXJpbmctbHZtaC1yaXZhbHJ5LWludGVuc2lmaWVzLW1vbmNsZXItdGlmZmFueS1hY3F1aXNpdGlvbnPSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Both LVMH and Kering recorded satisfactory 2019 revenue results despite a relatively tough environment this year. Going forward, however, the luxury giants are set to deepen their rivalry with strategic acquisitions that will have far-reaching implications — particularly in the Greater China market.

Having confirmed its purchase of the iconic American jeweler Tiffany & Co. last month for US16.2 billion, LVMH has its eyes firmly set on deepening its accessible jewelry portfolio and capturing a greater share of the Chinese middle class as well as U.S.-based Chinese students and U.S.-bound Chinese tourists. As Jing Daily previously noted, the most immediate impact of Tiffany’s takeover by LVMH would be a boost to the group’s footprint in the U.S., which currently makes up around 25 percent of LVMH revenue.

The other benefit for LVMH is a boost in the group’s watches and jewelry roster, which lags behind that of its other major luxury rival, Richemont (owner of A. Lange & Söhne, Jaeger-LeCoultre, and Cartier). Boasting watches and jewelry brands such as Ulysse Nardin, Boucheron, Girard-Perregaux, and China’s own Qeelin, Kering, too, is fighting an uphill battle in the segment against Richemont.

But it’s where these two benefits meet that Tiffany’s strengths lie for LVMH. Although 2019 marked a decline in Chinese travelers heading to the U.S . and a slower pace of Chinese student enrollments , there are signs that both could recover in 2020. Similarly, the mid-market jewelry segment in China remains ripe for continued growth, and this sits right in Tiffany’s sweet spot. This would be good news for Tiffany & Co, which has struggled with a slowdown in its home market and needs a rebound in Hong Kong to make up for a sharp drop in its 3Q earnings . But it also opens up LVMH to tap more of the Chinese middle class, which also favors the group’s higher-end offerings.

Gucci owner Kering, too, continues to focus on strategic acquisitions that could give it a stronger position in China. Most recently, it was announced that Kering is in preliminary discussions with the Italian apparel brand Moncler, whose high-priced puffer jackets are a regular sight in Beijing or Shanghai.

As Reuters noted, “A deal for Moncler would give Kering a label whose growth has stood out over the past decade, even in a booming luxury sector. As bankers shuck suits, ties, and overcoats in favor of more casual attire, its 2,000 puffy down jackets have moved beyond the ski slopes of St. Moritz to the conference rooms of the World Economic Forum in Davos.”

With nearly 50 stores in Greater China, Moncler already has a strong stance in the country and is a popular purchase for Chinese tourists from Los Angeles to Milan.

Looking ahead to 2020 and a China market that is by no means as certain as it was in previous years, both LVMH and Kering know that diversity is key. The luxury market in China is becoming younger, more diffuse — with customers trying out far more brands than before rather than fixating on a handful of “giants” — and more interested in things like sustainability and even second-hand luxury.

Kering must know it cannot depend so much on Gucci to power through an uncertain global economic environment or continue printing money in mainland China. LVMH can’t expect younger Chinese customers to be as enthusiastic about heritage Louis Vuitton collections as their parents. To stay on top and compete with one another, it’ll take smart additions to their portfolios, and now the question is who’ll be smarter in the new year."
WWD Yearbook: LVMH Eclipses Rivals With Tiffany Acquisition - WWD,"Mon, 23 Dec 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vd3dkLmNvbS9mZWF0dXJlL25vLTEtbHZtaC1lY2xpcHNlcy1yaXZhbHMtd2l0aC10aWZmYW55LWRlYWwtMTIwMzQwNTQyOC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Bernard Arnault may still be wrestling Jeff Bezos to top the rolls of the world’s richest these days, but his luxury group is speeding ahead of rivals, adding distance to its lead.

When LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton sealed the sector’s biggest deal ever — a plan to buy Tiffany & Co. for $16.2 billion — it extended its grip on global luxury to a particularly lucrative chunk of the industry: high-end jewelry.

The repercussions of the Tiffany deal stretch across the entire sector, though, adding pressure on the group’s main competitors who, like LVMH, also trade in fashionable apparel and leather goods.

Combining the financial firepower of the largest luxury group with the iconic American house — known the world over for its robin’s egg-colored packaging and classic engagement ring settings — creates a more robust competitor to the leading jewelry label Cartier, which belongs to Compagnie Financière Richemont.

And at the conglomerate level, the deal shrinks the pool of potential acquisitions that can serve as building blocks for rivals seeking to future-proof their businesses.

“You used to compare LVMH to the rest of the sector, now I think it’s in a league of its own,” said HSBC analyst Erwan Rambourg. “And you’ve had scale and speed at the same time,” he noted.

Indeed, scale and speed are pushing the sector to what HSBC analysts are describing as a state of “bling supremacy.” In this “leader-takes-all” environment, under LVMH management and with greater means, Tiffany presents a “much more significant threat” to competitors, the analysts have said.

LVMH’s market capitalization dwarfs that of its nearest competitor, topping the 200 billion euro mark, compared to Kering’s level of around 73 billion. Hermès International stands at just over 70 billion euros, while Richemont is at around 36 billion euros.

With economic weight comes fuel for future growth, which is another reason the effects of this deal, which paves the way for hefty investments in Tiffany, are set to continue well into the future.

LVMH has plans to lift business at Tiffany, for example, when it enters the group fold early next year, by pulling it out from the glare of the markets, delisting it from the stock market.

“Our goal is to provide Tiffany with the ideal environment to further invest and grow,” Arnault told WWD when the deal was unveiled, noting the delisting will lift the pressure on short-term profitability that comes with being listed in the U.S.

“LVMH doesn’t care about the margin for this quarter or this year, they care where the group will be in 10, 15 years,” Rambourg said.

The financial firepower that comes with scale — which is reinforced by the Tiffany acquisition — also helps groups tackle numerous fronts at once.

“The important thing is the power of the marketing budgets, the power to drive innovation and the evolution of digital and supply chain,” said Oliver Chen, an analyst at Cowen.

“Luxury is behind with digital probably because it can be, because the brands carry so much equity and they’re not easy to replicate,” Chen said. “Innovation in luxury goods is marketing and design and that requires money.”

LVMH executives intend to reinforce Tiffany’s offer, organizing it around product pillars, as it has for Bulgari — an acquisition from eight years ago — capitalizing on existing lines, but also building new ones.

Another important area of future investment will be the label’s store network. LVMH boosted productivity at individual stores at Bulgari, another achievement it intends to replicate at Tiffany, which has a sprawling presence of 321 stores in more than 20 countries, mostly in the Americas and Asia. Here again, the group will draw on weight to help land the best real estate.

In this context, areas calling for attention — and funds — are multiplying, adding to the importance of scale.

“Complexity is exploding” in the luxury industry, meaning groups have to commit resources to an ever-growing number of fronts, Bernstein analyst Luca Solca observed in a recent note to clients.

Solca considers LVMH the “best structural play” for investors, citing the group’s diversification, scale, the health of its mega brands, its grip on distribution, upstream integration, and management focus and talent.

LVMH’s breadth and momentum — as reinforced by the planned Tiffany transaction — adds an extra kind of pressure on rival groups, analysts say.

For Kering, Tiffany could have been the jewelry megabrand that it needed to fulfill its ambitions in hard luxury, while for Richemont, “at the very least, it will see fiercer competition in its core jewelry business,” according to Solca.

“There’s an expectation from investors that Kering should do something,” said Rambourg. With Gucci accounting for about 80 percent of earnings before interest and taxes for the group, investors would likely welcome reducing the label’s weight in the group, he added.

“I think it would come as a relief to shareholders at Kering if they were to dilute out that exposure,” Rambourg said.

In this context, it’s no surprise that recent talk of interest by Kering in luxury outerwear label Moncler — one of the industry’s leading success stories in recent years — has seized the market’s attention, with analysts weighing in on the potential of such a deal. They estimate a purchase of Moncler would be worth upward of 13.5 billion euros — another signal of how LVMH’s purchase of Tiffany has transformed the luxury landscape by setting a new price bar for high-quality acquisition targets.

Not only would an acquisition of Moncler allow Kering to dilute the importance of its star label Gucci in the group, but it could also draw on its resources to speed up the brand’s growth, a number of analysts have said. The team at Goldman Sachs noted that the size of Kering, along with its digital platform and exposure to Millennials, could push Moncler to grow faster than expected.

Such a deal could boost Kering’s profits by 20 percent in 2020, estimated analysts from Equita SIM, who see synergies in media buying, rents, corporate operations and in the digital sphere.

With LVMH’s Tiffany acquisition prompting wider deliberation on possible moves by other luxury groups to adapt to the changed landscape, some suggest that even bigger ones would make sense.

Considering the potential of a “blue-sky” merger scenario linking Kering and Richemont, analysts at Bernstein — while acknowledging major hurdles, such as the likely loss of power of controlling shareholders at Richemont — say it could create a larger number two. The two companies have different areas of expertise, with Richemont’s strength in hard luxury offsetting Kering’s weakness in that segment and the opposite in soft luxury, they note.

“Kering has done a lot to deserve higher credit in the industry,” noted Solca, applauding its moves over the years to divest general retail assets and Puma to become a luxury pure player.

“Not only that, Kering has been able to take most of its soft luxury brands to unprecedented heights: Gucci, Bottega Veneta, Saint Laurent, Balenciaga stand to represent a ‘Kering template’ to brand revivals,” he said.

Combined, the two could create a “formidable strategic response to LVMH,” the analysts said.

Kering, meanwhile, while declining to comment on a potential purchase of Moncler, has said it is open to adding brands to the “backbone” that Gucci represents for the group.

“We have very important financial resources, which are growing regularly, and we are therefore in a position to seize opportunities,” Kering chairman and chief executive officer François-Henri Pinault has said.

Morgan Stanley analysts Elena Mariani and Edouard Aubin expect more consolidation in light of the very low cost of borrowing, the strength of the top five players’ balance sheets, which they estimate have “never been stronger over the past 20 years,” the operational synergies groups can generate and the finite number of potential targets.

However, the analysts say they see a “very limited number of potential targets,” noting that LVMH and Kering “have shown less interest in acquiring small brands in recent years.”

With few potential targets, Mariani and Aubin predict consolidation will be a “relatively slow process,” while other categories like luxury autos, fine wines and spirits, luxury hospitality, eyewear and prestige cosmetics could generate interest.

In the meantime, the chairman and ceo of LVMH has shown no signs he is interested in resting on his lead.

“Like my friend Roger Federer…he keeps training, and so do I,” Arnault told WWD, the day after he revealed his group’s plans for Tiffany."

Bernard Arnault inspires me,” says Sheron Barber.The 38-year-old has traveled from Los Angeles to the palatial Louis Vuitton store on Paris’ Place Vendôme during the height of fall Fashion Week to pay tribute to his idol, the head of luxury colossus LVMH. Barber is a spectacular sight. He has dyed black dollar signs in his close-cropped fuchsia and yellow hair, a green grill covering his teeth and multiple Louis Vuitton luggage locks dangling from the stainless-steel chain encircling his neck. “I spent a couple hundred thousand last year on LV,” he says. He earns a handsome living customising the looks of music acts like Migos and Post Malone. In his latest video, ‘Saint-Tropez’, Post Malone wears a chest plate constructed by Barber that is a blend of black leather and a Vuitton bag. Of Arnault, Barber declares: “He has single-handedly defined modern luxury.”“It’s a most exceptional Louis Vuitton maison,” Arnault says of the Place Vendôme store, in English with a distinct French accent. “You can see the entire universe of the brand.” Opened two years ago, the space feels like a cross between a museum and a private club. An array of Vuitton’s wares are displayed inside gleaming vitrines and on artfully placed shelves. Marble staircases with glass balustrades lead to a private atelier on the fourth floor where six seamstresses create bespoke dresses for celebrities like Lady Gaga and Emma Stone. “I was very involved in the design,” Arnault says.He obsessively tracks his top brands, especially Louis Vuitton, the conglomerate’s cash machine, which accounted for nearly a quarter of LVMH’s 2018 revenue of $54 billion and up to 47 percent of profits, according to analysts. (LVMH shares financials for its top five divisions but not for its individual brands.) Vuitton’s selection of bags, apparel and accessories, which the company never wholesales or discounts, is an ever-changing mixture of classic and contemporary, like an $8,600 limited-edition twist on its Capucines purse in turquoise leather with an appliqué pattern designed by Tschabalala Self, a 29-year-old artist from Harlem. American Virgil Abloh, 39, Vuitton’s new menswear designer, created a stir early this year when he debuted a collection with glow-in-the-dark bags that use fiber optics to illuminate the LV logo in the colours of the rainbow.“Why are brands like Louis Vuitton and Dior so successful?” Arnault asks. “They have these two aspects, which may be contradictory: They are timeless, [and] they are at the utmost level of modernity. . . . It’s like fire and water.”That paradox has translated into record sales and profits at LVMH, whose roster of more than 70 brands includes Fendi, Bulgari, Dom Pérignon and Givenchy. That, in turn, has helped drive up LVMH’s stock price, which has nearly tripled in less than four years. Arnault, who owns 47 percent of the company’s shares with his family, is now worth $102 billion, $68 billion more than he was in 2016. He is the third-richest person on earth, just behind Jeff Bezos ($110 billion) and Bill Gates ($106 billion).And at 70, Arnault is far from done. In late October, LVMH made an unsolicited $14.5 billion bid for the 182-year-old American jeweller Tiffany. If the deal goes through, it will be Arnault’s biggest acquisition ever. “If you compare us to Microsoft, [we are] small,” he says. Indeed, LVMH’s market value of $214 billion lags far behind the software giant’s $1.1 trillion. “It’s just the beginning,” says Arnault.Arnault’s beginnings in France’s industrial north were far removed from the glittering perch he now occupies. His first love was music, but he didn’t have the talent to make it as a concert pianist. Instead, after graduating from an elite French engineering school in 1971, he joined his father at the construction firm founded by his grandfather in the city of Roubaix.An exchange with a New York cab driver that same year planted a seed that would grow into LVMH. Arnault asked the cabbie if he knew of France’s president, Georges Pompidou. “No,” replied the driver, “but I know Christian Dior.”At age 25, Arnault took charge of the family business. After socialist François Mitterrand became France’s president in 1981, Arnault moved to the States and tried to build a division there. But his ambitions were bigger than construction. He wanted an enterprise he could scale, a business with French roots and international reach.In 1984, when he learned that Christian Dior was for sale, he pounced. Its parent, a textile and disposable-diaper company called Boussac, had gone bankrupt, and the French government was looking for a buyer. Arnault put up $15 million of his family’s money, and Lazard supplied the rest of the $80 million purchase price. At the time, according to reports, he made a pledge to revive operations and preserve jobs, but instead he fired 9,000 workers and pocketed $500 million, selling off most of the business. Critics recoiled at his brazenness, which seemed more American than genteel French. The media later dubbed Arnault “the wolf in the cashmere coat”.Arnault’s next prey was Dior’s perfume division, which had been sold to Louis Vuitton Moët Hennessy, and a fight between the company’s brand heads gave him an opening. First, he teamed up with the boss of Vuitton, the leather goods company whose founder had made custom trunks for Empress Eugénie, the wife of Napoleon III. Arnault helped the head of Vuitton oust Moët’s chief, only to get rid of him, too. By 1990, again backed by Lazard and using the cash from Boussac, he had taken control of the company, which included Moët & Chandon, the famous French champagne maker, and Hennessy, the French cognac producer that dates to 1765.After conquering Louis Vuitton Moët Hennessy, Arnault spent billions to acquire leading European companies in fashion, fragrance, jewellery and watches, and fine wines and spirits. Since 2008, LVMH has purchased 20, bringing the total to 79 brands. In 2011 it paid nearly $5 billion for the Italian jeweller Bulgari in a mostly stock deal. Two years later it bought the fine-wool purveyor Loro Piana for a reported $2.6 billion. Arnault’s most recent acquisition was in April when LVMH paid $3.2 billion for the London-based hotel group Belmond, whose opulent holdings include the Cipriani hotel in Venice, the luxury train line Orient Express and three ultra-luxe safari lodges in Botswana.“Bernard Arnault is a predator, not a creator,” says a banker who was close to the Boussac deal.Arnault has not succeeded at every conquest. In 2001 he lost what the media called the “handbag war” for control of fabled Italian fashion house Gucci, to his French luxury rival, François Pinault. Over the next decade, LVMH used a stealth tactic common among hedge funds—cash-settled equity swaps—to secretly acquire 17 percent of Hermès, the 182-year-old maker of fine silk scarves and the iconic Birkin bag. Hermès fought Arnault off in a protracted battle that ended in 2017 with LVMH relinquishing most of its Hermès shares.Up close, Arnault’s polished appearance is like a suit of armour. On an overcast Friday morning in late September, he is attired in a selection of LVMH brands, including a pin-striped suit by Celine, a navy tie by Loro Piana, black leather slip-ons by Berluti and a white cuff-linked shirt by Dior with his initials embroidered just below his heart. Slim and 6 foot 1, he stays fit playing four hours of tennis a week, sometimes with his friend Roger Federer. “I try not to be fat, as you see, and I do a lot of sports,” he says.Those games are among his only breaks from a workaholic schedule that starts at 6.30 am in his 17th-century mansion in the posh 7th Arrondissement on Paris’s Left Bank. He begins each morning listening to classical music, scanning industry news and texting family members and brand chiefs. “What I have in mind every morning is that the desirability of a brand should be as strong in 10 years,” he says. “It’s really the key to our success.” By 8 am he’s in his office at 22 Avenue Montaigne, where he stays as late as 9 pm. Occasionally he’ll take a 20-to-30-minute pause to play the Yamaha grand piano in a room down the hall from his ninth-floor office.“He works 24 hours,” says Delphine Arnault, 44, Arnault’s oldest child, from his first marriage, and the executive vice president of Louis Vuitton. “When he sleeps, he’s dreaming of new ideas.”Every Saturday, he prowls his retail stores, rearranging bag displays and making suggestions to clerks. He visits as many as 25 stores, including the competition, in a single morning. “It’s a ritual,” says his son Frédéric, 25, who works at LVMH’s top watch brand, TAG Heuer. Arnault relays details from his store visits to the chiefs of his top brands. He recently alerted Louis Vuitton CEO Michael Burke that the new “it” bag, the $2,480 Onthego tote, was not in stock at the Place Vendôme shop. “He complains when too many SKUs are sold out,” says Burke, who has worked with Arnault since 1980.At least once a month, Arnault travels in his Bombardier jet to visit some corner of his empire. In October, he visited the small town of Keene, Texas, where he and Donald Trump cut the ribbon on the first of two new Louis Vuitton workshops slated to create 1,000 jobs over the next five years. (The brand already has two workshops in California.) “I am not here to judge his types of policies. I have no political role,” said Arnault to reporters. Still, the event sparked a flash of controversy within his own ranks. Vuitton’s womenswear artistic director, Nicolas Ghesquière, wrote on Instagram: “I am a fashion designer refusing this association #trumpisajoke #homophobia.” Arnault didn’t respond to Ghesquière’s dig.In late October, Arnault, Burke and Dior CEO Pietro Beccari were set to fly to Seoul to visit stores, including a new Frank Gehry-designed Vuitton outpost. It’s the sixth Vuitton store to include an art gallery that will show selections from the extensive collection of the LVMH-funded Fondation Louis Vuitton, which also rotates through the Fondation’s $135 million Paris museum (also designed by Gehry).Even with the conglomerate’s massive footprint around the world—4,590 shops in 68 countries—store openings and closings often depend as much on Arnault’s gut and a neighbourhood’s ambience as on more traditional metrics like sales per square foot. In China, one of LVMH’s most important markets, he limits the number of Louis Vuitton shops to control the pace of expansion.Last year, Louis Vuitton shuttered a store in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, because adjacent shops, restaurants and parking weren’t ritzy enough. Arnault visited a property on the Champs-Élysées multiple times before he approved a new Dior store near the Arc de Triomphe that opened in July, despite data showing the previous tenant had sluggish sales. “He pushes you to really be sure,” Dior chief Beccari says. “He wants to challenge you, that’s his tactic.”Showing up rivals is another tactic. In July, as apparel brands were competing to see who could be the most eco-conscious, he announced a partnership with the British fashion designer Stella McCartney (daughter of Paul), who has long touted her sustainability efforts (she says she even refuses to use glue in her sneaker line because it’s made from boiled animal parts). Arnault invited McCartney, who in 2018 ended a 17-year partnership with the Pinault family’s Kering luxury group (owner of Gucci), to become his “special advisor.” She accepted, despite LVMH’s decision to continue to make products with leather and fur (and glue). Arnault also declined to join the ‘Fashion Pact’, led by Kering and signed by 32 apparel makers, including Chanel, Hermès, fast-fashion giant H&M and even McCartney, who all pledged to lower carbon emissions.Arnault then made his own series of eco-gestures during Fashion Week, when the media converged on Paris to cover the shows. At Tuesday’s Dior show, where models paraded across a stage decorated with 170 trees in dirt-filled burlap bags, the press was told that the theme was sustainability and that the electricity at the event was produced with generators powered by canola oil. The next evening, LVMH hosted 50 journalists for a two-and-a-half-hour event in an auditorium at company headquarters. Arnault and 10 LVMH brand chiefs took turns on a brightly lit stage reciting their commitments to environmental stewardship, their presentations interspersed with slickly produced videos of models strutting down catwalks and cashmere goats frolicking on the Mongolian steppes.Mid-event, Arnault was asked to share his thoughts on young climate activists like 16-year-old Greta Thunberg. “I’m a natural optimist,” he said, “unlike Greta, who has a big problem, and that’s projecting an outrageous amount of pessimism in her messages without any real solutions.”Not surprising for a corporate titan, he prefers not to dwell on problems. “He doesn’t like to hear the word ‘no’,” says Anna Wintour, the longtime Vogue editor. “It’s not part of his vocabulary.” Not from rivals, acquisition targets or even environmental champions.McCartney is one of many big names he’s reeled in. In 2017, LVMH launched a cosmetics line, Fenty Beauty, with the pop star Rihanna, distributing the products through its retail beauty chain Sephora’s 2,600 stores. Capitalising on Fenty’s broad-audience offerings—its foundation comes in 40 skin shades—and on its founder’s 77 million Instagram followers, the division will hit $550 million in sales this year, Arnault says. He’s betting that Fenty Fashion, the apparel collection LVMH debuted with Rihanna in May, will meet with similar success. “She brings a different vision of fashion,” Arnault says. “For the future, it’s very good for us to be connected to millennials.”To keep his brands modern, he also looks to his five children from two marriages, four of whom work at LVMH: Delphine, 44; Antoine, 42; Alexandre, 27; and Frédéric, 25. His youngest child, Jean, 21, will likely join the company when he finishes school, according to Alexandre.Shortly after he started as strategy and digital director at the Swiss watch brand TAG Heuer 13 months ago, Frédéric Arnault pitched an idea to his father over dinner. To enhance the brand’s smartwatch for golfers, he wanted to acquire a French startup, FunGolf, that had built an app with detailed terrain data on 39,000 courses. Players could use it to measure how far they were from sand traps or greens. “The people in the M&A department thought I was crazy,” he says. But once he made the case to his father, says Frédéric, “He said, ‘Go for it’.”Arnault ­regularly brings in big names.

Then, in 2016, he persuaded LVMH to pay $719 million for an 80 percent stake in the 121-year-old German luggage maker Rimowa, favoured by A-listers like David Beckham and Angelina Jolie. At Rimowa, Alexandre later led product collaborations with au courant brands like the American skateboarding line Supreme.Delphine, meanwhile, leads the six-year-old LVMH Young Fashion Designer Prize, awarded each year to one designer chosen from thousands of applicants. Louis Vuitton’s Virgil Abloh was a finalist for the 2015 prize (he had interned at Fendi in 2009 with his friend Kanye West). And LVMH has launched an accelerator programme for up to 50 promising startups in the luxury goods sector at Paris’s Station F, an incubator for startups and the brainchild of French billionaire Xavier Niel, who also happens to be Delphine’s long-term partner and the father of the couple’s two children.So what do Arnault’s offspring say about which one of them is likely to lead the company one day? As though reading from the same script, they all sidestep the question. “Our father is very young,” says Delphine. “He’ll work for 30 more years,” Alexandre says. “I don’t think he’ll ever stop,” says Antoine, head of LVMH corporate communications and chief of Berluti. “This is not a topic we think about,” Frédéric says. “We hope he is going to stay as long as possible in this role.”“People ask me all the time,” says Arnault. “What is most important for the group is we find the best, and we’ll see if it’s in the family or outside the family.” How long will he work? “I have no end decided.” Though he won’t say which of his children he is most likely to promote, he is eager to talk about their talents. He shows off a video on his iPhone 11 of Frédéric playing a Liszt sonata in preparation for a concert he will give at a music festival outside Paris together with his mother. Canadian-born pianist Hélène Mercier-Arnault, 59, performs regularly as a soloist and chamber musician. “Like a professional,” Arnault says about Frédéric’s skill. “I’m not playing like that.”As for sibling rivalry, Arnault and his children paint a portrait of family harmony. The siblings often gather for Saturday lunch with their parents, and they all spend some of August at the Arnault compound in Saint-Tropez. Only Frédéric admits that discord surfaces on the tennis court. “It can get quite tense,” he says. “Our father is very competitive. He doesn’t like losing. This is something he’s transmitted to us.” No one close to the family will make an on-the-record prediction about succession. But one longtime observer says that when Arnault finally steps down “It will be Game of Thrones”.Arnault sees the future playing out quite differently, convinced that his tight-knit family’s control will give LVMH an edge for years to come. In his own mind, he’s going up against not only his competitors in the luxury sector but also global giants. He calls Microsoft a “beautiful company” but notes that Gates has held onto only a small number of shares. “Long-term he won’t be there,” he muses.Before proclaiming his vision for his conglomerate, he catches himself. “In a way, I should not say that, because you may think I am pretentious,” he says. But then he lets loose: “[LVMH] is a French monument. Because it represents France all over the world. People know better the name of Louis Vuitton, Christian Dior, Dom Pérignon, Cheval Blanc, than anything else. Maybe they know also Napoleon? General de Gaulle? We think it’s important that this group, for the long term, is controlled by a French family.”"
How luxury jewellers are engaging with millennials - Style,"Sat, 21 Dec 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjbXAuY29tL21hZ2F6aW5lcy9zdHlsZS93YXRjaGVzL2FydGljbGUvMzA0MjgyOS9ob3ctbHZtaC1jYXJ0aWVyLWFuZC1vdGhlci1sdXh1cnktamV3ZWxsZXJzLWFyZS1lbmdhZ2luZ9IBdWh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLnNjbXAuY29tL21hZ2F6aW5lcy9zdHlsZS93YXRjaGVzL2FydGljbGUvMzA0MjgyOS9ob3ctbHZtaC1jYXJ0aWVyLWFuZC1vdGhlci1sdXh1cnktamV3ZWxsZXJzLWFyZS1lbmdhZ2luZw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"It outperformed the beauty and fashion sectors, such as handbags and apparel, which saw a 1 per cent drop in revenue, as shown in Bain & Company’s study on worldwide luxury goods sales in 2018.

The jewellery industry is having its moment. The global jewellery market is expected to reach US$480.5 billion by 2025, says California-based Grand View Research. The world’s top 100 luxury goods companies earned total revenue of US$247 billion in the 2017 financial year, up from US$217 billion in the previous cycle, according to the 2019 edition of Global Powers of Luxury Goods by Deloitte. A powerful engine behind this US$30 billion growth is the jewellery industry, which scored a 7 per cent increase.

Switzerland-based Richemont – owner of Cartier, Van Cleef & Arpels, and Chloé – recovered from a 3.9 per cent decline in 2017 and reversed it with 3.1 per cent growth in 2018.

Chapter 2 of the digital series L’Odyssée de Cartier takes us to New Bond Street in London, the maison’s historic home in the British capital.

This recovery was ascribed to 9 per cent growth by its jewellery brands, which contributed a 58.9 per cent share of Richemont’s luxury sales.

French luxury conglomerate LVMH owns high-fashion brands from Louis Vuitton to Dior, as well as jewellery and watch labels like Chaumet and Bulgari.

The success of its watch and jewellery divisions in 2018 – despite accounting for only 15.3 per cent of LVMH’s overall sales – was one of the key factors handing it the crown in the luxury market, and boosting its 17.2 per cent year-on-year sales growth from 2017.

As fashion brands struggle to grow, what are the factors keeping these century-old fancy jewellers afloat? Jean-Marc Mansvelt, CEO of Chaumet, believes heritage brands have a tremendous advantage because in jewellery, longevity is crucial and brings value; investment in jewellery boosts returns for the next generation.

Van Cleef & Arpels offers jewellery courses at L’Ecole School of Jewellery Arts.

“For us, with such a long history, Chaumet has an incredible patrimony of documents, creations and stories: there’s no need for storytelling per se,” he explains.

LVMH is no stranger to renewing time-honoured names, such as Dior and Rimowa, and achieving commercial success. Compared to fashion brands, which often produce six to eight collections a year, jewellery brands are less prolific and their products are priced much higher (sometimes in the millions of dollars).

In its recent collaborative exhibition “Autrement” with Swedish photographer Julia Hetta, showcased inside its boutique on Boulevard Saint-Germain in Paris, the brand explored novel ways of wearing jewellery and celebrated individuality.

A peacock-feather brooch was worn as a head accessory, and the same applied to the diamond-encrusted Joséphine Aigrette Impériale tiara. Digital photographs were displayed in historical frames, relating the jewels and their historical culture to the modern world.

“The necessity of staying relevant today forces us to invent new ways and use tools like digital [platforms] to show our long history of creativity and virtuosity,’’ Mansvelt says.

Chaumet’s new Crown Your Love ring draws inspiration from the love story between Napoleon and Josephine, for whom the maison created its first jewels.

With rich culture and stories in place, how can brands engage their modern-day customers. This is key to a brand’s strategy when the luxury industry’s core buyers are much younger, as millennials – and gradually Gen Z – become the mainstream? The new demographic is seeking a more personalised shopping experience and an individual relationship with the brands. Kering-owned jeweller Boucheron opted to offer something truly unique and personal in its newly renovated boutique at 26 Place Vendôme. The Paris landmark was built in 1717, and it’s an address that has housed the brand since 1893. Crafted in the style of a private residence to make customers feel at home, the refurbished building groundbreakingly features a VIP guest suite operated by The Ritz Paris. It is reserved for selected A-list guests who are invited to experience top-notch luxury.

The key is to adapt our stories and express them in a contemporary way in order to touch the people of today Jean-Marc Mansvelt, CEO, Chaumet

This new feature is a realisation of CEO Hélène Poulit-Duquesne’s vision of positioning clients at the centre of the business, and her new perspective on luxury. “Luxury today is time and experience; it’s something on your mind, not only on your wrist,” she explains.

Boucheron was founded in 1858 in the French capital and its goods have historically been coveted by royals from Britain’s Queen Elizabeth to Russian Prince Felix Youssoupoff and Tsar Alexander III. Today it woos a new cohort of royals – worldwide affluent millennials. A homelike maison experience seems not quite enough. “Customers switch between online and offline anytime. Eighty per cent of our customers, and 90 per cent of Chinese, do their research online before purchasing in the store, so we have to work omnichannel,” reveals Poulit-Duquesne.

Industries like haute couture and jewellery are businesses based on the art of creation. While business acumen is crucial, creativity and craftsmanship are still the heart and soul of luxury jewellery making.

According to Nicolas Bos, chief executive and creative director of Van Cleef & Arpels, craftsmanship fascinates people, especially in the age of digital electronics. A vital ingredient for each jewellery house, craftsmanship poses a challenge in the way it is conveyed to customers. “We each have our own vehicles, through visual components of images and videos or celebrities, for instance. But it’s not easy to show the full image,” states Bos.

The brand, founded in 1896, has unveiled L’Ecole School of Jewellery Arts, an institution dedicated to jewellery education, based on its century-long heritage in jewellery making. After opening its first location in Paris, it has launched L’Ecole in Hong Kong, the first branch outside its French headquarters. The programme offers three pillars spanning 17 courses: Savoir-Faire (Craftsmanship), Art History of Jewellery and The Universe of Gemstones. Its faculty features experts from both France and Asia, including designers, gemologists, stone-setters, art and jewellery historians, lacquer artists and connoisseurs.

Its sister label Cartier, always at the forefront of brand storytelling, has released a new series of L’Odyssée de Cartier following its launch in 2012. Imbued with dazzling style and a French sense of humour, the cinematic projects illustrate the maison’s inspiration and influence via compelling storytelling.

At Boucheron, creativity is of paramount importance. Such belief propels the house to uphold inventiveness. “Claire [the creative director of the brand] and myself love innovation, which is always in our DNA, even though sometimes some jewellery doesn’t sell,” says Poulit-Duquesne. “But, of course, I’m here to do business. Boucheron has many classic collections that we know will sell, but sometimes experimenting with a small part of the business is giving permission to the team to be creative.”

Luckily, most of the time, creativity reigns. Jack, a collection defined by playfulness and imagination, allows customers to design their own jewellery pieces and accessorising. It is one of the brand’s bestsellers. In a fast-changing luxury landscape, the doctrine has shifted from the long-held core principle of exclusivity to a balance between scarcity and accessibility, while being inclusive and emotionally impactful to customers. Historical houses are re-examining their brand heritage assets, melding them with technology and new approaches to communication to secure a brighter future.

How LVMH became the world's biggest luxury seller - nss magazine,"Sun, 22 Dec 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5zc21hZy5jb20vZW4vZmFzaGlvbi8yMDIzMy9ob3ctbHZtaC1iZWNhbWUtdGhlLXdvcmxkLXMtYmlnZ2VzdC1sdXh1cnktc2VsbGVy0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"After weeks of talks and meetings, LVMH has finally bought last October Tiffany. The deal, the largest in its history, will allow the French group to increase its presence in the United States and to strengthen its position in high jewellery, integrating a portfolio that already includes other brands in the sector such as Bulgari, Chaumet, TAG Heuer and Hublot. The retail chain made unforgettable by the film starring Audrey Hepburn Breakfast at Tiffany will give the company an increase in revenues, a figure already very high, which in 2018 reached 46.8 billion euros, about three times the 14 billion euros of Richemont and 13.7 billion euros of Kering, always its closest rival, in recent fiscal years. Sales grew by 10%, while the Ebit reached the threshold of 10 billion, with an increase of 21%. According to the analysts, even if the jewellery and watches department of LVHM provides only 9% of the turnover at this moment, it has a high margin of growth and with the purchase of Tiffany will double to 16%. Much of the credit for these excellent results are due to Bernard Arnault, Chairman and CEO of LVMH, who, with a far-sighted approach, realized that a brand of suitcases and one of the liquors could be turned into the core of a colossus world leader in luxury.

What is LVHM?

You may also like Read now What is Luxury today?

It's a French conglomerate that controls over 70 luxury companies with 4592 shops and over 156 thousand employees worldwide, operating in various sectors, from fashion like Louis Vuitton and Dior to jewellery, from wines like Veuve Clicquot or Hennessy to retailers like Le Bon Marché Rive Gauche or Sephora. LVMH's history began in 1987 when two supposedly different companies merged together in a $4 billion deal: Louis Vuitton, led by Henri Racamier, and Möet-Hennessy, led by Alain Chevalier. Because the wine company was three times larger than LV, it was LV who was appointed the president of the new holding company, provoking Racamier's resentment and a long legal battle for the management of the conglomerate. Finally, a young entrepreneur named Bernard Arnault won the battle. After graduating in Engineering at the École Polytechnique in Palaiseau, Arnault started his career working for Ferret-Savinel, the construction company founded by his grandfather, and entered the luxury sector officially only in 1984, saving Boussac from bankruptcy. With the takeover of the textile group thanks to 15 million dollars from his family combined with 45 million dollars obtained from the French financial institution Lazard Frères, the man becomes the owner of Christian Dior, the department store Le Bon Marché and other brands. According to the New York Times in 1989 and the most recent documentary Merci Patron!, in the next two years ""Arnault had pushed Boussac into black, firing 9,000 workers and selling Boussac's disposable diaper division and most of its textile business for $500 million. On the other hand, it helped him ""to move from a family business of $15 million a year to a business 20 times larger.""

Aiming to strengthen his position, Racamier asked Arnault to invest in LVMH but underestimated his ambition. In a short time, Arnault became the majority shareholder, forcing both Racamier and Chevalier to retire, and in 1989 he was appointed the president of the group, a role he still has today. Once in charge, the first move of the businessman was to replace the existing team with men he trusted, while he spent the following decades incorporating new luxury brands into the group. Only in the 1990s did he buy, among others, Berluti, Kenzo, Guerlain, Celine, Loewe, Marc Jacobs, Sephora, Tag Heuer and also record his first defeat when archival François Pinault blew Gucci for $2.92 billion in what has been called by the New York Post as ""the bloodiest fight in fashion"". Speaking of his idea of putting under the same umbrella different luxury brands, often in competition with each other, Arnault told CNBC:

True luxury is a relative idea, which varies according to people. LVMH's goal is to create products and experiences, so as to offer customers a sense of authentic value. And then the word luxury has become a bit obsolete, I prefer high-quality products. The important thing is that in ten years our brands have remained objects of desire.

And he added:

In the 90s (I) had the idea of a luxury group and at the time I was very much criticized for it. I remember people telling me it doesn’t make sense to put together so many brands. And it was a success ... And for the last 10 years now, every competitor is trying to imitate, which is very rewarding for us. I think they are not successful but they try.

This strategy of acquiring several brands, firing the management team to replace him with his trusted men or with one of his five children and has now become a standard in the business world copied by all.

Arnault's instinct has led him to be a ""first mover"" in many cases. He introduced ready-to-wear to an haute couture company by hiring Marc Jacobs at Louis Vuitton, allowing the designer to revolutionize the brand with his unique style and collaborations with contemporary artists such as Takashi Murakami. He also used the fashion show to sell high margin items such as perfumes or handbags and was one of the first foreign businessmen to invest in China at the start of Deng Xiaoping's market economy reforms, opening a Louis Vuitton store in Beijing in 1992. Actually, Asia is the place where LVMH has more shops than in the rest of the world: 1289 against 1153 Europeans (excluding France) and 783 in the United States. In an interview, the CEO revealed that part of LVMH's success ""is this duality, timelessness and maximum modernity.

Following this philosophy, in recent years, LVMH has added, among others, to its portfolio: Fendi, Bulgari, the entire Christian Dior (before 2017 Groupe Arnault, which is the private holding company owned and controlled by Arnault, was the sole majority shareholder), J.W. Anderson, Rimowa, Stella McCartney and Fenty as part of a joint venture with Rihanna. The conglomerate's properties rose to 75, generating a turnover that in 2018 alone exceeded the record of 51 billion dollars and has increased its advertising spending by two billion euros over the last five years. According to Statista, the global corporate data platform, it went from 3,310 spent in 2013 to 5,52 in 2018. Despite its global success, the French empire already has other plans for the future. The first is to expand and consolidate its presence in the United States, as evidenced by its deal with Tiffany and the opening of a new LV manufacturing facility in Johnson County, Texas."

Indeed, the group has just recently acquired 55% in Château d’Esclans – located in the Var, in France – which is known for its vintage Whispering Angel.

It should be known that the shares of the estate were shared between the two owners, Sacha Lichine (50%) and Hervé Vinciguerra (50%), and that the group now owns all the shares of Hervé Vinciguerra as well as 5% of the shares of Sacha Lichine.

The castle is spread over an area of ​​260 hectares of which 44 are reserved for the production of the vintage. This makes it possible to produce and distribute 10 million bottles in the year in a hundred countries including the United States, United Kingdom or France.

After Château du Galoupet, Château d’Esclans is Mr. Arnault’s second purchase in rosé wine this year. Last May, he acquired a vineyard located in La-Londe-Les-Maures also in the Var. The estate is a little smaller than the Esclans.

Indeed, it measures 160 hectares including 72 of vines. It has an annual production of about 450 000 bottles of rosé and brings in turnover 2.5 million euros."
Luxury Tycoon Bernard Arnault Was the World’s Richest Person.

Yes, his stint as the human with the largest fortune was short-lived, but his current standing at the second-richest person in the world means his resources are still robust—and positions him to reach the top spot again.

At half-past 10 on Monday morning, LVMH stock swelled to $458.46 per share, which nudging Arnault’s personal net worth past that of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, according to Forbes. However, by the time the market closed at 4PM, Amazon’s stock had grown by 0.7 percent, which pushed Bezos’ wealth to $110.1 billion compared to Arnault’s $109.3 billion. Still, Arnault’s wealth now bests that of Bill Gates by nearly $2 billion. He surpassed Gates to become the world’s second wealthiest person last Friday.

Much of this rapid growth is tied to Arnault’s acquisition of American heritage jeweler Tiffany & Co. Though LVMH stock has been up and down in the interim, it’s up four percent overall since the prospective deal was announced. A solid three percentage points of that increase have only occurred since last Thursday, meaning that Arnault’s individual wealth ballooned by $3.3 billion over the course of two short trading days.

LVMH’s purchase of Tiffany’s is one for the record books; the deal is worth an astonishing $16.2 billion. It marked Arnault’s most expensive acquisition to date and sent a ripple through the luxury market. It’s rumored that it is the very thing that spurred Arnault’s archrival, François-Henri Pinault, to begin talks that could lead to a purchase of Moncler.

WATCH

Propelled by strong sales from brands like Louis Vuitton, which continues to expand its accessories category, LVMH recorded €25.1 billion in revenue for the first half of 2019 alone––an increase of 15 percent from the year before. After failing to make its earnings goals a couple of weeks ago, Tiffany & Co.’s stock price was down, but if Arnault can give the struggling brand his signature polish, it might not be long before the jeweler (and Arnault’s ranking) are back on top."
French Luxury Stocks Hit by Trump's Tariffs - The Business of Fashion,"Tue, 03 Dec 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzb2ZmYXNoaW9uLmNvbS9uZXdzL2x1eHVyeS9mcmVuY2gtbHV4dXJ5LXN0b2Nrcy1oaXQtYnktdHJ1bXBzLXRhcmlmZnMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS, France — US President Donald Trump's proposed additional tariffs on $2.4 billion of French goods, ranging from handbags to sparkling wine and makeup, could be an overhang for months on shares of LVMH, Hermès International and Kering SA.

French luxury stocks fell 2 percent or more at midday in Paris, after the US announced the levies. The stocks touched session lows in late morning as Trump, speaking in London, indicated that a trade deal with China may not happen for another year.

US sales of the products targeted by Trump account for a relatively small portion of the companies’ earnings, traders and analysts said. And investors have learned that a threat of tariffs doesn’t necessarily mean they will ever be put in place. Still, for an industry already hurt by the US-China trade dispute and Hong Kong protests, the news is unwelcome.

“Potential new tariffs aren’t good for sentiment on French consumer names but there’s Trump tariff threat fatigue,” Keith Temperton, a trader at Tavira Securities, said by email. Still, the “overhang of tariffs remains” on these stocks, he said.

Some companies also are already taking action to stay on Trump's good side: LVMH recently opened a new Louis Vuitton factory in Texas, part of Chairman Bernard Arnault's efforts to hedge against trade tensions and build on the rapport he's established with the US president. LVMH last month agreed to buy Tiffany & Co. for $16.2 billion to expand its US footprint.

France's benchmark CAC 40 Index slipped 0.5 percent at 12.05 pm. in Paris, dragged down by Hermès, LVMH and Kering, which owns the Gucci and Saint Laurent brands. The three stocks plus cosmetics company L'Oreal SA account for about 18 percent of the index's weighting.

Here is what analysts are saying about the proposed tariffs:

Bernstein, Luca Solca

""The theme of Trump's tariffs isn't new. We'll have to see what comes out of it after all the threats.""

Jefferies, Edward Mundy

The direct impact from fresh tariffs into the US that include sparkling wine is ""negligible,"" but it points to uncertainty around whether existing tariffs on spirits imports into the US could be widened or deepened.

Tariffs will be reviewed in February 2020 and then again in August 2020, meaning tariff uncertainty is likely to remain a theme for spirits.

Liberum, Nico von Stackelberg

L'Oreal is ""largely insulated"" by the proposed US tariffs as it already makes products for US clients in the country.

Bloomberg Intelligence, Duncan Fox

This will affect a myriad of listed companies, including LVMH, Hermès, L'Oreal and Pernod, though all have production and US plants and brands that could offset duties.

The US is likely the largest single global market for luxury goods and beverages, but prices may be less of an issue for some of these expensive products. Sales could also be diverted to duty-free establishments.

Cheese sales could be harmed by added tariffs, yet French dairy exports to the US only totaled 188 million euros ($208 million) in 2017. Key cheesemakers are privately owned or co-operatives, such as Le Groupe Bel and Groupe Sodiaal.

LVMH's Bernard Arnault (Briefly) Ousted Amazon's Jeff Bezos From His Post as the World's Richest on Monday - The Fashion Law,"Tue, 17 Dec 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihAFodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGVmYXNoaW9ubGF3LmNvbS9sdm1ocy1iZXJuYXJkLWFybmF1bHQtYnJpZWZseS1vdXN0ZWQtYW1hem9ucy1qZWZmLWJlem9zLWZyb20taGlzLXBvc3QtYXMtdGhlLXdvcmxkcy1yaWNoZXN0LW9uLW1vbmRheS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"For a matter of minutes on Monday, Bernard Arnault took the title of the richest person in the world, topping Amazon founder Jeff Bezos. According to Forbes, “Around 10:30 AM EST, shares of [Arnault’s] luxury conglomerate LVMH Moët Hennessy – Louis Vuitton” – which owns 75 luxury brands from Louis Vuitton and Dior to wine and spirts companies like Veuve Clicquot and Dom Pérignon – “hit $458.46, propelling [the French businessman] past Bezos” on Forbes’ Real Time Billionaire ranking, where he would remain before ultimately landing back in the number two spot later that morning and long before market close at 4pm.

As of Tuesday morning, Arnault had fallen to the number 3 spot, due to fluctuations in LVMH’s Euronext-traded stock price, following not only behind Bezos but Microsoft’s Bill Gates, as well, whom he had previously surpassed for the number 2 spot on more than one occasion, including in July.

The chairman of Paris-based LVMH – which holds the title of the world’s largest luxury goods conglomerate – has been inching up the upper echelon of Forbes’ “World’s Richest” list over the past year, in particular, ousting Spanish billionaire Amancio Ortega – the force behind retail conglomerate Inditex and its roster of Zara, Zara Home, Massimo Dutti, Bershka, Oysho, Pull and Bear, Stradivarius and Uterqüe – from the number 4 spot on the world’s richest list, as well as for the titles of the wealthiest figure in Europe and the wealthiest figure in fashion.

70-year old Arnault advanced again this spring, surpassing 88-year old American business magnate Warren Buffett thanks to an LVMH stock surge after the group released its first quarter earnings report in April. That landed him in the top three, following Bezos and Gates, only to overtake Gates almost four months later when LVMH’s stock advanced to a record high in July, thereby, pushing Arnault’s net worth to $107.6 billion. (As of Tuesday morning, Forbes put Arnault’s net worth at $107.5 billion, and Gates’ at $107.9 billion).

The rise of Arnault through the upper-most echelon of the world’s richest comes in light of the sizable growth of luxury players in the market, which is “a sign of how the luxury business is eclipsing sectors that were once at the core of the European economy,” the WSJ’s Matthew Dalton wrote last month.

While “banks are struggling to adapt to new post-financial-crisis regulations, auto makers [are] facing declining car sales, [and] big oil companies are subject to the whims of turbulent oil and natural-gas markets,” luxury fashion and accessories brands have been consistently revealing boosted bottom lines across the globe, and reshaping the makeup of the CAC-40, a market capitalization weighted index that reflects the performance of the 40 largest and most actively traded shares listed on Euronext Paris, in the process.

As for whether LVMH, Kering and Hermès – which occupy three of the top seven spots by market cap on the CAC-40, “ahead of BNP Paribas, France’s largest bank, and AXA SA, the country’s largest insurer,” according to the WSJ – can maintain their hold on the market as a whole, Bernstein & Co. analyst Luca Solca is optimistic, saying that “as long as global market conditions support a larger and larger audience of consumers who are interested in and capable of buying luxury goods, LVMH is in a great position.”"
Italian wool maker Manteco forecasts 8% growth fueled by 'eco' turn - MDS,"Wed, 11 Dec 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZW1kcy5jb20vYmFjay1zdGFnZS9pdGFsaWFuLXdvb2wtbWFrZXItbWFudGVjby1mb3JlY2FzdC04LWdyb3d0aC1mdWVsZWQtYnktZWNvLXR1cm4uaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Manteco’s eco strategy translate to sales. The Italian wool maker company which is a supplier of H&M, Inditex, Mango, Kering or LVMH, has grown 18% on average per year since 2012. The group’s sales reached 80 million euros in 2018 and it expects to grow between 7% and 8% for this year.

Three laboratories, the labor force of one of the main European production hubs and the stamp of made in Italy stamp. This is the formula with which Manteco, which just fifty years ago was one of Prato’s many coat factories, has now become one of the largest wool companies in Europe and clients like Zara, H&M, Kering or LVMH. “We are ahead of the wave of sustainability and today we are gathering that effort,” stated Matteo Mantellassi, chief executive officer of the company, to Mds.

The company was founded in 1943 by Enzo Mantellassi and in the beginning was specialized in the production of outerwear. In 1967, his son Franco Mantellassi took the reins of the company, and at the end of the nineties the company passed to the third generation, with Marco and Matteo Mantelassi in charge.

It was then when they decided to turn the business around, outsourcing spinning and weaving to factories in the region and focusing on R&D and sustainability to increase its position and attract the giants of the sector.

The company works with BCI cotton, Tencel, recycled wool with the Global Recycle Standard (GRS) seal and certified virgin wool. Also, the company has started a project to collect all production waste from its suppliers and manufacture new recycled wool. “It is the way of having maximum traceability in production,” Mantellassi explains.

Manteco has seventy employees, but Mantellassi states that indirect employment reaches 2,500 workers, all in the region of Prato. The company focuses its activity on quality controls: 6,783 per year for raw materials and another 30,000 for the finished product. “Specializing in R&D and control allows us to work with very specialized artisans, all in Prato, and improve our traceability,” says the executive.

In addition to its three laboratories, Manteco has offices in Tokyo, New York, Barcelona and Stockholm, and sells to 47 markets. The company produces more than eight million meters of wool per year and ended 2018 with a revenue of 80 million euros.

Manteco has grown 17.8% a year since 2012 and invoices more than eighty million euros

Since 2012, Manteco has grown at a rate of 17.8% per year and expects to end this year with an increase of between 7% and 8%. “We are the fourth largest Italian textile company,” Mantellassi stated.

The company works for retailers like Inditex, H&M or Spanish Mango, and in recent years has also begun to supply luxury giants such as LVMH or Kering. Six years ago, at the beginning of the sustainable commitment to luxury brands, companies began asking for labels to identify the origin of wool for the final consumer.

Today, H&M or Mango already include in some products the Manteco Wool stamp. Mantellassi acknowledges that this strategy has increased its visibility, but for now, the company is not planning to launch its own brand."
What Tiffany's Acquisition Means for the Jewelry Industry - National Jeweler,"Mon, 09 Dec 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYmh0dHA6Ly93d3cubmF0aW9uYWxqZXdlbGVyLmNvbS9ibG9nLzgzNDEtd2hhdC10aWZmYW55LXMtYWNxdWlzaXRpb24tbWVhbnMtZm9yLXRoZS1qZXdlbHJ5LWluZHVzdHJ50gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"

LVMH’s third-quarter results also reported strong growth in Asia, and it has a strong enough foothold in the country to propel Tiffany even further in the growing market.

“I could definitely see that happening,” said Reginald Brack, executive director at NPD and an industry analyst on watches and luxury, in an interview with National Jeweler Friday.

boxes, Tiffany’s strong brand presence is a valuable asset.The rise of brands was a major takeaway from De Beers’ 2019 Diamond Insight Report , which noted the popularity of branded jewelry, particularly in the diamond engagement ring space.Branded jewelry represents two-fifths of sales of commitment jewelry in the United States, said De Beers.The report also highlighted the resonance of brands with same-sex couples and millennials.“Tiffany checked all the boxes,” industry analyst Paul Zimnisky said in an interview with National Jeweler Friday, noting that while the standalone brand was the most important aspect of the deal, its vertical integration is certainly the second.Luca Soltani, senior research analyst for luxury goods at research firm Bernstein, echoed Zimnisky’s sentiment on vertical integration.“It is clearly an advantage—especially when we look at the bridal products,” Soltani said in an email to National Jeweler.Zimnisky wasn’t surprised by the acquisition, as rumors had been swirling in the space for a while, but said he was surprised LVMH didn’t make a bid last year during the stock market sell-off.Then again, “not a lot of acquisitions could move the needle for them,” he said, noting the size and wealth of the luxury conglomerate.LVMH has the money to spend, but what it lacks are the sourcing and manufacturing connections that Tiffany maintains.LVMH Chief Financial Officer Jean-Jacques Guiony said as much in a conference call with analysts following the deal, highlighting Tiffany’s “very high level of vertical integration, compared with our brands.”“[Tiffany] realized early on that vertical integration will give it better access to the goods it needs, and at better prices too,” said analyst Golan.The company’s vertical integration efforts began 20 years ago, Tiffany CEO Alessandro Bogliolo said in an interview with Bloomberg Tiffany established Laurelton Diamonds, a wholly owned manufacturing subsidiary, in 2002.It’s a De Beers sightholder and has inked long-term rough supply agreements with Alrosa and Dominion Diamond.Bogliolo noted that 80 to 90 percent of its polished diamonds above 0.18 carats come from its workshops.Tiffany also holds a stake in a diamond mine in South Africa owned by Canadian mining company Diamcor, a company spokesperson confirmed.At a time when provenance and supply chain transparency are becoming increasingly important to consumers, Tiffany is ahead of the curve.The jeweler began telling consumers the origin of its diamonds in January through its “Diamond Source Initiative.”In that same Bloomberg interview, Bogliolo estimated the move toward sustainability cost Tiffany tens of millions of dollars over the years but added that it differentiates Tiffany from other jewelry companies.“The reason why we are so selective with our sourcing is to avoid either mines that are not compliant with safety requirements, environmental protection, [and] human rights respect,” he said.Tiffany, for example, does not source from Zimbabwe or the Congo due to internal issues in the countries, even if the diamonds meet Kimberley Process standards, he said.“Tiffany is a very big player in all sorts of diamonds, and it’s something where the sourcing is not easy to do, and we expect to benefit from that,” LVMH’s Guiroy said on the call.With Tiffany’s vertical integration comes its ability to have a greater say in the means of production, a valuable asset at a time when climate change and environmental issues are weighing heavy on the minds of many consumers.The younger, affluent generation are socially and environmentally conscious and hold luxury brands to high standards, particularly sustainable and ethical production processes, said Deloitte in its Global Powers of Luxury Goods 2019 survey"
Chinese shoppers are spending more at home. Tiffany has big plans to cash in - CNN,"Fri, 20 Dec 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vMjAxOS8xMi8yMC9idXNpbmVzcy90aWZmYW55LWNvLWx2bWgtYWxlc3NhbmRyby1ib2dsaW9sby9pbmRleC5odG1s0gFPaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAuY25uLmNvbS9jbm4vMjAxOS8xMi8yMC9idXNpbmVzcy90aWZmYW55LWNvLWx2bWgtYWxlc3NhbmRyby1ib2dsaW9sbw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Shanghai CNN Business —

Tiffany has been playing catch-up in China, and its CEO isn’t shy about saying it.

The 182-year-old New York jeweler — which was recently purchased by luxury conglomerate LVMH (LVMHF) — entered the mainland in 2001 and started building out its retail network there about six years later, according to Alessandro Bogliolo. He said that was a “little bit late compared to most luxury brands.”

“We lost probably a decade of opportunity,” Bogliolo told CNN Business on Thursday.

Bogliolo called ramping up Tiffany’s presence in China one of his first major decisions as chief executive. Since he took the helm in 2017, Bogliolo has opened several new stores within the mainland, commissioned new jewelry inspired by Chinese designs, set up an online shopping platform in Chinese, and ordered a massive overhaul of the company’s flagship store in Shanghai, which has roughly doubled in size to become the company’s biggest outlet in Asia.

Bogliolo was at that store Thursday to mark its reopening, and he spoke with CNN Business while clutching a shimmering, nine-carat diamond ring. The piece is just one of several high-end jewels — which range in price from $100,000 to tens of millions of dollars each — that Tiffany is now selling in China.

Despite the country’s slowing economy, Bogliolo remains bullish on China, which has been a bright spot for the company with “very strong” sales growth over the last two years, he said.

Chinese shoppers account for a third of global consumption on luxury goods, spending about $115 billion last year, according to consulting firm McKinsey. And while they’ve typically traveled outside of the mainland to buy those items, their habits are now changing as Beijing slashes import taxes and brands reduce the price gap that typically makes their products cheaper in Hong Kong and other cities, according to consultancy Bain and research firm Bernstein.

“Chinese consumers made 27% of their luxury purchases in China in 2018, up from 23% in 2015,” according to a Bain report released in April. “We anticipate that this share will increase to 50% by 2025.”

This time, Tiffany is determined not to get left behind. The emerging trend has prompted the company to move some of its most expensive inventory to China, Bogliolo said. In an attempt to woo established jewelry collectors, high-end pieces that until recently were only shown in China for exhibitions or other events will now be part of the Shanghai store’s permanent collection, according to Bogliolo.

The company is also trying to win over young Chinese shoppers by building a Blue Box Cafe in its Shanghai store. The signature eatery will soon be open to anyone who wants to have breakfast, lunch or dinner at Tiffany’s.

“80% of consumers of luxury in China are millennials,” Bogliolo said. “I really wanted to bring to China, to Shanghai … the flagship experience you can have in New York.”

The expansion is timely for Tiffany. Like countless other businesses, the company has been hit by the ongoing political crisis in Hong Kong, where pro-democracy protests have continued for over six months. The turmoil has hurt the economy and caused retail sales to plunge.

Tiffany (TIF) has experienced challenges in Hong Kong over the last two quarters because of “significant disruptions,” the company told investors earlier this month. But Bogliolo said that “doesn’t change our strategy in Hong Kong.”

Hong Kong has long been one of the capitals of the luxury world, “and I think it will remain as such,” he added.

Bogliolo pointed out that Tiffany recently made a “huge investment” in its Hong Kong flagship store, which is one of the company’s biggest outlets in the region.

Tiffany will also soon need to adjust to life as a subsidiary. LVMH bought the company for $16.2 billion last month, one of the largest acquisitions ever made in the luxury goods sector. The deal is expected to close next year.

The historic deal was “a good sign” of confidence in Tiffany that confirmed the merits of its strategy, said Bogliolo.

Asked about his own future, Bogliolo was more reticent. LVMH has not said whether it will retain the company’s management team after the deal closes in mid-2020, and the CEO demurred when asked if he would stay on.

“You should ask the shareholders,” he said, with a smile."

"Luxury Billionaires' Rivalry Fuels Pursuit of Tiffany, Moncler - The Business of Fashion","Thu, 05 Dec 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzb2ZmYXNoaW9uLmNvbS9uZXdzL2x1eHVyeS9wYXJpcy1iaWxsaW9uYWlyZXMtcml2YWxyeS1mdWVscy1wdXJzdWl0LW9mLXRpZmZhbnktbW9uY2xlci_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS, France -- The first families of French luxury are at it again, firing up a race to gather the world's brightest baubles and fanciest fashions under their rival houses.

Only days after the Arnaults' LVMH snapped up jeweler Tiffany & Co. for $16.2 billion, word surfaced of a possible riposte from the Paris giant's crosstown rival, the Pinaults' Kering SA. The Gucci owner has held exploratory talks with Italian skiwear maker Moncler SpA about a potential acquisition, according to people with knowledge of the matter.

“We had expected the LVMH-Tiffany news to catalyze a round of industry consolidation -- which Kering-Moncler would be a part of -- but the race seems to have gotten underway even more swiftly than imagined,” said Swetha Ramachandran, investment manager of the GAM Global Luxury Brands Fund.

The rivalry, more than two decades in the making, has defined the modern luxury industry and shows no signs of ending. Since 2001, when Kering founder Francois Pinault beat out LVMH Chief Executive Officer Bernard Arnault for control of Gucci, the companies have increased their hold over the sector through dozens of deals.

Riding China Demand

Kering has announced at least $14.7 billion of acquisitions since 1995, according to data compiled by Bloomberg, compared with at least $45.5 billion for LVMH. Each family’s wealth has increased vastly as the companies integrated their purchases and rode a wave of demand in China.

As their dominance over the business has grown, the two families have broadened the playing fields on which they compete. The Pinaults and Arnaults have bought up neighboring vineyards in Burgundy, set up separate art museums in Paris and even one-upped each other with contributions to the rebuilding of Paris’s fire-ravaged Notre Dame Cathedral.

Soaring Wealth

On one scorecard, Arnault has a clear lead. He’s the richest person in Europe with a $101.8 billion fortune, after adding $33 billion this year alone, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Pinault, whose son Francois-Henri now runs Kering, has a net worth of $38.7 billion, up $9 billion in 2019.

Sprawling structures like those of Kering and LVMH -- which owns brands ranging from Louis Vuitton to Christian Dior to Dom Perignon -- have gone out of style in other industries. But there’s no conglomerate discount for these giants.

Combining many different brands under one umbrella lets LVMH and Kering pool functions like purchasing and information systems, while feeding investment to those that need it most, as individual labels ride the ups and downs of consumers’ changing tastes.

With a market value of more than €200 billion, LVMH is one of the biggest companies in Europe. Its rival, which owns Saint Laurent, Boucheron jewelry and Brioni suits, trails at €68 billion, but Gucci has been the fastest-growing major luxury brand over the past few years.

As the bigger player, LVMH has led the way in turning new acquisitions into drivers of growth. While Arnault has had a few missteps, including purchases of Donna Karan and Marc Jacobs and unsuccessful runs at Hermes International and Gucci, deals for the likes of Bulgari jewelry, Givenchy and Christian Dior have paid off handsomely. LVMH has pushed newly acquired brands upmarket with a sharper focus on marketing and store presentation, boosting profits.

Kering's offerings include Ulysse Nardin watches, fashion labels such as Alexander McQueen and Bottega Veneta, but it's less diversified than LVMH. The company has become increasingly dependent on Gucci, which provided more than three-quarters of its operating profit in the first half of the year. That's putting pressure on Kering to hedge against the risk that demand for the Italian brand's new looks could fade. Hence the possible interest in Moncler, which has a market value of about $12 billion.

To secure the maker of puffy down jackets worn on the ski slopes of St. Moritz and at the World Economic Forum in Davos, the Pinaults will need the backing of another luxury billionaire. Moncler Chairman Remo Ruffini's holding company owns a 22.5% stake in the company, valued at about $2.5 billion.

Moncler confirmed that it’s had contacts with Kering, saying there are no concrete proposals. A representative for the French company declined to comment.

So successful have the Pinaults and the Arnaults been that others elsewhere have sought to emulate the conglomerate approach, but so far their acquisitions have been limited to second-tier brands. Capri Holdings Ltd., the U.S. parent of Michael Kors, has added Italian label Versace and Jimmy Choo. Tapestry Inc. owns Coach, Kate Spade and Stuart Weitzman. China's Shandong Ruyi has talked of turning itself into an Asian LVMH.

With many Italian luxury labels already acquired and others struggling, that means the global luxury business is increasingly controlled from Paris.

“Competition is the mother of invention,” Luca Solca, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein in Geneva, said. “The rivalry between LVMH and Kering – or between Arnault and Pinault, if you really want to personalize it – has brought the creation of two incredible companies that sit at the top of the modern luxury goods industry.”"
Luxury Brands Can Do Better With a Conglomerate Behind Them - The Fashion Law,"Wed, 11 Dec 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihgFodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGVmYXNoaW9ubGF3LmNvbS9icmFuZHMtY2FuLWRvLWJldHRlci13aXRoLWEtY29uZ2xvbWVyYXRlLWJlaGluZC10aGVtLWEtbG9vay1hdC10aGUtY29uc29saWRhdGlvbi1vZi10aGUtbHV4dXJ5LWluZHVzdHJ5L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The outlook for standalone brands in the fashion and luxury sphere is becoming increasingly “tricky,” Reuters reported recently, noting that “cash rich conglomerates like LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton and Kering are drowning out competitors with [their over-sized] spending on social media marketing and their hiring of star designers.” At the same time, luxury groups are well-position “to invest in markets like mainland China,” particularly compared to their independently-owned counterparts, something that is of increased importance in light of economic and cultural storms, such as the financial blows that have come with months of mass protests in Hong Kong.

The upper-most echelon of the fashion industry is firmly dominated by an increasingly small handful of mighty entities that have amassed collections of brands, which they have turned into house-hold names by way of eye-poppingly expensive traditional marketing efforts (complete with strong luxury-centric messaging) and the help of no small number of globally-recognized celebrities. Their logos adorn the bags carried by consumers in cities across the world; their footwear, eyewear, and apparel can be spotted on teens in top-tier cities in China and on moms in New York City.

The Luxury Status Quo

This is the status quo for luxury goods, but it has not always been this way. In fact, it was not all that long ago that the high fashion/luxury sector was composed almost exclusively of a smattering of family-run enterprises, many of which focused largely on their native markets and their core categories of competency. Until the 1980s, for instance, the Florence-headquartered leather goods brand that Guccio Gucci founded in 1921 remained in the hands of the Gucci family. Fellow Italian house Fendi was similarly kept in close family control – specifically, in the hands of Paola, Anna, Franca, Carla and Alda Fendi, the five second-generation sisters, who inherited the Roman ready-to-wear and fur business in 1954 upon the death of their father – until 2000.

The start of the new millennium saw LVMH and Prada –the latter of which now owns Miu Miu, Church’s, and Car Shoe – form something of an unusual alliance and acquire a 51 percent stake in the company. Given that each of the Fendi sisters held a 20 percent stake in the business, four out of the five had to back the sale, and they did. The list goes on in a similar manner for nearly all of the most esteemed luxury brands, whose corporate histories come with comparable tales of acquisitions by the likes of industry conglomerates, such as LVMH and Kering, which have spent billions of dollars over the past few decades building up the bulk of their businesses, with a marked wave in the 1990s and steady acquisition efforts throughout the early-to-mid-2000s.

The result of such efforts by luxury conglomerate builders – such as LVMH’s Bernard Arnault, Kering’s François-Henri Pinault (and his father François Pinault before him), and Richemont’s Johann Rupert – to boost their prowess by building up sizable portfolios of coveted consumer-facing brands, has been striking: the names at the forefront of the development of the luxury sector have essentially become the industry.

As evidenced by recent events and rumblings, from LVMH’s impending $16 billion-plus acquisition of Tiffany & Co. to Gucci-owner Kering’s reported interest in nabbing Moncler, their quests for growth (and the consolidation that comes with it) do not appear to be abating. In fact, there are “heightened expectations of more deal-making in a luxury industry” to come in the not too distant future, per Reuters.

Increased Consolidation

The path to increased luxury-level amalgamation makes sense for the likes of LVMH and co., as the reality behind the steady number of mergers and alliances, particularly in recent years – whether it be LVMH formally consolidating Dior into its group, and acquiring luggage-maker Rimowa in 2016 and a larger piece of jewelry company Repose earlier this year, or Richemont’s swallowing up of e-retail giant Yoox Net-a-Porter and Italian jeweler Buccellati – is that “consolidation is central to success [of the luxury sector],” according to the Financial Times’ Anna Gross.

Such large-scale banding together “fortifies” big brands (even if the potential cost savings to be garnered from luxury mergers are not necessarily as sizable as those that abound in more down-market industries), particularly in light of investor fears of a looming global recession, says Gross. And this is something that “has been reflected in stock prices.” LVMH is a good example: The Wall Street Journal revealed last month that shares in the Paris-based group – which owns 75 different brands ranging from fashion houses like Louis Vuitton, Dior, Givenchy, and Fendi to spirits companies, such as Veuve Clicquot and Moet and holds the title of the largest luxury goods group in the world – “are worth more than Europe’s biggest auto maker, Volkswagen AG, and [its] biggest bank, HSBC Holdings.” In October, alone, LVMH’s share price grew by more than 5 percent, bringing its market capitalization to $222 billion for the first time ever, and “making it almost as valuable as Europe’s biggest oil producer, Royal Dutch Shell PLC.”

With such steady growth and future gains in mind, the general consensus (at least from a markets point of view) is that it is better to be a big guy, and that “brands can do better with a conglomerate” behind them, as the Economist puts it. This line of thinking is certainly bolstered by the self-perpetuating cycle born from the continued moves towards consolidation, which pit single-brand entities against bona fide behemoths, something that has prompted no shortage of “smaller players to seek the security of bigger groups.”

The FT points to Versace’s late 2018 sale to Capri Holdings (nee Michael Kors) for $2 billion, a seeming testament to the fact that it is becoming increasingly difficult to exist and grow as an independently-held brand in the corporate fashion landscape. Capri had previously welcomed Jimmy Choo into its expanding arsenal, while American rival group Tapestry brought Coach, Kate Spade, and Stuart Weitzman under a single roof.

These moves, paired with the ongoing endeavors of European giants, mean that “performance polarization in the luxury sector remains high,” Rogerio Fujimori, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, told the FT in November. “Bigger luxury groups [are] grabbing a bigger slice of the pie at the expense of many smaller players.”

Others agree. Analysts from UBS, for example, told the paper that “the negative implications [of such consolidation] for the rest of the sector seem under-appreciated.”

The Luxury Conglomerate Going Forward

Looking beyond the individual deals of late, and the healthy skepticism that should be exercised when it comes to the large-scale consolidation of an industry by a few key forces, the question becomes: how long can this go on for? As the Economist aptly asserts, “The timeless brands that conglomerates crave by definition need a long history, and these are relatively few.” Chanel – whose annual sales (a whopping $11.12 billion in revenue in 2018) make it something of a mini conglomerate in its own right – comes to mind, and if incessant reports are to be believed, LVMH has, at different times, been angling for an acquisition. (Arnault explicitly shot down acquisition-specific speculation, calling it “fake news” at the group’s annual shareholder meeting in April 2018. Bruno Pavlovsky, Chanel’s president of fashion, similarly has denied rumors of this nature).

Speaking to the brand’s consistent stance in favor of remaining independent, Philippe Blondiaux, the Chief Financial Officer of Chanel chimed in on the topic, as well. He said in June that Chanel – which has long been held by the Wertheimer family, with French billionaire brothers Alain and Gerard currently in control – “needs to remain independent, in order to have the freedom to make choices that go against the grain, such as no longer using exotic animal skins, or by harmonizing prices.”

Rolex is another frequently-cited target. Not only does the Swiss watchmaker have 114-years of high-end history to go on, it has a hold on something like 22.2 percent of the global luxury watch market, per Morgan Stanley, and an estimated $11.6 billion in annual retail sales. But … controlled by the private Hans Wilsdorf Foundation, the company similarly has a dedication to “preserving its [independent] status fiercely.” Finally, Hermès – which is publicly traded on Euronext Paris – is an obvious pick, although an unlikely one, as more than 70 percent of the company is still family-owned and bolstered by the formation of a holding company by the Puech, Dumas and Guerrand families in 2010 in furtherance of an “irrevocable” commitment to maintain control.

That is not to say, however, that a company’s desires to remain in family hands have always proven persuasive to the luxury conglomerate builders. The Hermès holding company was created in response to an aggressive – albeit ultimately unsuccessful – takeover effort by LVMH, after all."

While analysts expected Tiffany & Co. to earn 85 cents per share in the quarter that ended October 31, its net income actually decreased by 17 percent from 77 cents per share a year earlier to just 65 cents per share now. Though its revenue remained the same at $1.015 billion USD as the previous year, it was still lower than the expected $1.037 billion USD mark. Similarly, analysts expected a 1.4 percent growth in same-store sales, which ended up being completely unchanged compared to the previous year.

Despite the company’s rocky performance, its CEO Alessandro Bogliolo remains confident: “Our underlying business remains healthy with sales attributed to local customers on a global basis growing in the third quarter, led by strong double-digit growth in the Chinese Mainland offset in part by softness in domestic sales in the Americas,” he said in an official statement.

Last week, LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton Co

The American jewellery giant will report what is likely to be its last financial results as an independent company on December 5

The deal will allow LVMH's financial and market clout to support Tiffany's transformation efforts, while also boosting the French conglomerate's US market presence

While analysts will be looking for signs of a turnaround for the storied American jeweller, investors will still likely be celebrating last week's blockbuster acquisition in which LVMH paid a 37 percent premium to Tiffany's share price prior to rumours of the deal. For the wider market, Thursday's report will be the last chance to get a close-up on Tiffany before it is subsumed into LVMH, which does not break out earnings for its brands. It might also offer a first glimpse at former Barneys' CEO Daniella Vitale's vision for Tiffany as its new chief brand officer.

The Bottom Line: LVMH's $16 billion takeover has been well received by investors from both companies. LVMH will be able to help Tiffany burnish its faded brand; pouring cash into its turnaround strategy as the jeweller continues to struggle with slowing demand at home and overseas.

Kim Jones

A day later, Chanel will present its Métiers d'Art show in Paris

The presentation, to be held at an as-yet undisclosed location, was moved forward due to a national strike

Following last year's presentation in Tokyo, Kim Jones will stage Dior's pre-fall 2020 collection in Miami on December 3, coinciding with the opening of international art fair Art Basel Miami Beach. Jones has defined his tenure at the house through a number of artistic collaborations — teaming up with street artist KAWS for his inaugural Dior collection and with Daniel Arsham for the spring/summer 2020 set and logo. Closer to home, Chanel is set to present its latest Métiers d'Art collection — honouring the craftsmanship of Chanel's Paraffection ateliers — a day later in Paris. This will be the first Métiers d'Art designed exclusively by Virginie Viard, who took the reins following Karl Lagerfeld's death in February this year. Lagerfeld typically took the presentation on the road: his last Métiers d'Art was held in New York's Met Museum, with past shows held in Dallas, Shanghai and Rome.

The Bottom Line: Fashion's biggest brands continue to see value in staging shows outside of the 'noise' of traditional fashion week to generate media and Instagram buzz.

The British Fashion Council

In 2016 the BFC began to reposition its annual event as a global 'mix of the Academy Awards and the Met Ball'

This year, it has introduced a new Designers' Designer Award which zeroes in on British talent

This year will see Bottega Veneta's Daniel Lee and Jonathan Anderson of Loewe and JW Anderson face off in a number of Fashion Award categories including Brand of the Year, while Kim Jones for Dior Men joins them among the Designer of the Year nominees. The honouree list is largely British, with Naomi Campbell, Sarah Burton and Sam McKnight all recognised. However, Giorgio Armani will take home the Outstanding Achievement Award, while Rihanna's Fenty, a joint venture with LVMH, is also up for a prize alongside former LVMH prize winner Marine Serre and Moncler's Genius concept. Industry heavyweights Prada and Gucci are also in the running for Brand of the Year. A notable absentee is Hedi Slimane, who took over the creative direction of fashion favourite Celine last year. Similarly, Demna Gvasalia, whose streetwear take on Balenciaga proved a huge consumer hit, and Virgil Abloh, founder of once white-hot label Off-White and creative director of Louis Vuitton Men's, are nowhere to be seen.

The Bottom Line: The BFC attempted to reboot its annual awards ceremony into a global proposition in 2016, but four years into its rebranding there's still a ways to go. The Fashion Awards continues to strike a very British tone — and centre around homegrown talent.

Shanken News Daily: Moët Hennessy Buys Control of Luxury Rosé Leader Château d'Esclans - Wine Spectator,"Mon, 02 Dec 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndpbmVzcGVjdGF0b3IuY29tL2FydGljbGVzL21vZXQtaGVubmVzc3ktYnV5cy1jb250cm9sLW9mLWx1eHVyeS1yb3NlLWxlYWRlci1jaGF0ZWF1LWQtZXNjbGFuc9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Moët Hennessy, the wine and spirits division of French luxury titan LVMH, has made a big bet on pink, purchasing a 55 percent controlling stake in luxury Provence rosé winery Château d'Esclans for an undisclosed sum. Château d'Esclans is known for its Whispering Angel brand, which has been a driving force behind the premiumization of the rosé category in the U.S.

Moët Hennessy is acquiring 50 percent of d'Esclans from Singapore-based investment group Alix AM PTE Ltd, and 5 percent from d'Esclans president and founder Sacha Lichine, who will retain the rest of his shares and continue to oversee the business.

Lichine told Shanken News Daily (SND), a sister publication of Wine Spectator, that he was looking for a partner to help him expand globally. He says that sales of Whispering Angel and offshoot The Palm by Whispering Angel will surpass half a million cases in the U.S. this year, with the rest of the world accounting for about 300,000 cases. ""We were looking for a strategic alliance to help us premiumize our higher-end marks outside the United States, specifically in Asia, South America, the Caribbean and parts of Europe,"" he said.

The son of the late wine importer and Bordeaux château owner Alexis Lichine, Sasha sold his family's Château Prieure Lichine in 1999 and began focusing on rosé in the south of France. He bought Château d'Esclans in Côtes de Provence and invested heavily in viticulture and modern winemaking, even partially fermenting some lots in oak barrels. D'Esclans introduced three rosés in 2006 and priced its flagship rosé, Garrus, at more than $100 a bottle. It was blasphemy, but quickly became the must-have drink in St.-Tropez.

While Garrus grabbed headlines, Lichine's entry-level rosé, Whispering Angel, became a best-seller at just over $20 a bottle. Lichine's sales team worked overtime to convince Americans that rosé could be a year-round wine. Among d'Esclans' top-end wines are Les Clans (retailing at around $70) and Garrus ($100), which have been making inroads in developing the prestige rosé segment.

""We sell out the top-end range as we do with Whispering Angel,"" Lichine told SND, adding that d'Esclans' recent deal to purchase a neighboring estate ""will add [148 acres] of vines to our current holdings of nearly [183 acres].""

Stay on top of important wine stories with Wine Spectator's free Breaking News Alerts.

Based in the Var area of Provence, d'Esclans' original château dates to the 12th century, with the current château built in the mid-19th century. The vineyards are planted primarily to Grenache and Vermentino (Rolle).

Philippe Schaus, CEO of Moët Hennessy, credited Lichine with ""revolutionizing the world of Provence rosé"" and said the group ""will bring the full support of our worldwide teams"" to assist in further developing the business. Château d'Esclans will join Moët & Chandon, Veuve Clicquot, Dom Pérignon, Ruinart, Krug, Mercier, Chandon, Newton, Terrazas de los Andes, Cloudy Bay, Cape Mentelle, Numanthia, Ao Yun and fellow Provence producer Château du Galoupet in the Moët Hennessy wine portfolio.

According to Impact Databank, Provence rosé sales in the U.S. have risen from only 27,000 cases in 2005 to 2.1 million cases last year. For more on what this deal means for rosé and for LVMH's growing strength in luxury wine, visit Shanken News Daily."

"Rimowa CEO Alexandre Arnault on heritage, sustainability and expansion in China - Vogue Business","Tue, 10 Dec 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZvZ3VlYnVzaW5lc3MuY29tL2NvbXBhbmllcy9yaW1vd2EtY2VvLWFsZXhhbmRyZS1hcm5hdWx0LW9uLWhlcml0YWdlLXN1c3RhaW5hYmlsaXR5LWFuZC1leHBhbnNpb24taW4tY2hpbmHSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"To receive the Vogue Business China Edit, sign up here.

For LVMH scion Alexandre Arnault, Rimowa’s transformation into a luxury lifestyle player is just getting started. In 2016, the then 24-year-old convinced his father Bernard, chairman and chief executive of LVMH, to buy an 80 per cent stake in the German luggage brand for €640 million. The move was closely followed by the industry because of Arnault’s young age and family heritage, and because Rimowa already had a solid base of loyal customers and annual revenue of half a billion euros.

Three years in the making, Arnault’s calibrated revamping of Rimowa has been decisive but not disruptive. As chief executive, he’s led a rebranding with a polished sans serif logo, a cut to the majority of Rimowa’s wholesale accounts and a slate of collaborations with the likes of Dior, Supreme and artist Alex Israel that have increased the brand’s hype value and broadened its reach without alienating its existing customers. Now, Arnault is focusing on elevating Rimowa’s positioning in China, where the brand has regained all distribution rights as of June 2019.

Below, in an excerpt from an interview with Vogue Business in China editorial director Imin Pao, Arnault talks about his vision for the brand going forward. Read the full interview in English here or visit Vogue Business in China on WeChat.

This interview has been condensed and lightly edited for clarity.

On having the flexibility to experiment

“We started some projects that lasted two years, which we killed, and some products are ongoing. It's difficult to set a deadline. The good thing is that there wasn’t too much pressure to triple the business in two years. It was good to sit on our existing business and have the time to transform.”

On speeding up production

“We're going to move closer to the fashion cycle from an industrial cycle. We want to launch more products faster. We want people to get excited about getting a new suitcase.”

On sustainability

“We started recycling a lot of our materials; all the polycarbonate and aluminium that is not used gets recycled. Many of the plastics used in our products are recycled plastic. We have big projects in the company to reduce greenhouse gases, but this takes some time. The fact that the products last 15 years is already a way of being sustainable.”

On brand positioning in China and Europe

“The gap is closing, but if you look at a store like the one we are in today, or if you walk through Le Bon Marché, Rodeo Drive, Madison Avenue, Harrods or even Barneys New York, the brand’s positioning is way higher. The stores we made in Europe were more cautious and more coherent with the brand DNA, which is probably not the case everywhere in China. It will be, though.”

It’s no surprise that China was a top priority for luxury CEOs in 2019. Chinese consumers, both in their own country and travelling overseas, have become the biggest luxury spenders in the world, and luxury bosses know that you can’t be successful as a brand if you don’t have a thriving business in China.

Arnault finished the day with $109.3 billion to his name, compared with Bezos` $110.1 billion.

However, Arnault remains firmly ahead of Bill Gates ($107.8 billion), whom he passed for the number two spot on Friday. Last month, Arnault was able to slide into second place due to rising LVMH stock. Shares have bounced around since Arnault struck a deal to acquire American jeweller Tiffany & Co on November 25.

Last month, Bill Gates once officially surpassed Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos as the richest person on Earth with a net worth of $110 billion. The Microsoft co-founder had briefly topped Bezos as the richest man last month after Amazon`s lacklustre third quarter results had Bezos losing nearly $7 billion in stock value.

At the time of the purchase, Arnault said, according to the press release, “We are delighted to have the opportunity to welcome Tiffany, a company with an unparalleled heritage and unique position in the global jewelry world, to the LVMH family.” Buying global luxury jeweler Tiffany further cements LVMH’s foothold in the U.S.

Arnault’s net worth is about $107.6 billion, according to CNBC. That’s a 2.7 percent increase in a single day. However some sites put his net worth slightly lower. Bloomberg’s Billionaires Index puts Arnault’s wealth at $104 billion.

Arnault’s LVMH, an elegant ensemble of Moët Hennessy, and Louis Vuitton, and other luxury brands, acquired Tiffany’s for $16.2 billion. For many years Arnault has been called the “wolf in the cashmere coat,” for his astute business dealings.

Here’s what you need to know:

1. Arnault, Who Is Married to a Concert Pianist, Collects Art

Bill Gates is the richest man in the world, and Jeff Bezos is the second wealthiest. Arnault comes in third. Arnault said in Forbes, “If you compare us to Microsoft, [we are] small.”

Arnault is married to Hélène Mercier, a concert pianist. He collects art and has paintings from Mark Rothko, Claude Monet, Picasso, Andy Warhol, among other artists, according to IBTimes .

Some of the famous names under the helm of LVMH include brands from several categories: Wines & Spirits, Fashion & Leather Goods, Perfumes & Cosmetics, Watches & Jewelry, and Selective Retailing. Selective Retailing includes Starboard Cruise Services and Sephora.

LVMH products include Moet, Bulgari, Louis Vuitton, De Beers, Bulgari and Tag Heuer.

According to Vogue, Rihanna, speaking at the 2019 British Fashion Awards, as she accepted an award for her Fenty label “Thank you [LVMH’s Bernard Arnault] for giving me the opportunity to prove what I love to do.”

Before taking over LVMH, as reported in IBTimes , he tried various types of business ventures to enhance his management abilities. According to Forbes, he began his luxury realm in 1984. Arnault acquired “Boussac, a bankrupt French disposable diaper and textile business that included moribund fashion house Christian Dior. Six years later he took control of Louis Vuitton Moët Hennessy.”

He has been called the “wolf in the cashmere coat” for his sharp business acumen. In 2018 he said in Born2Invest, “What I love is to win. What I love is being number one.”

A Tiffany Deal! - LA Canyon News,"Tue, 03 Dec 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiMWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNhbnlvbi1uZXdzLmNvbS9hLXRpZmZhbnktZGVhbC8xMDE4MzbSATFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jYW55b24tbmV3cy5jb20vYS10aWZmYW55LWRlYWwvMTAxODM2?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"HOLLYWOOD—A sweet deal before the holidays, was reached with LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, the world’s largest luxury goods company, and the jeweler, Tiffany & Company for a cost of $16.2 billion; the largest ever in the luxury sector. The acquisition will give LVMH a bigger foothold in the United States, as well as help Tiffany in Europe and China.

It will also cement the status of Bernard Arnault, the LVMH chairman and chief executive, as the most acquisitive deal maker in the luxury business. The acquisition would add another prominent American name to the LVMH stable of brands, which includes Dior, Givenchy, Fendi and Dom Pérignon. The deal would help propel the French luxury company into a leadership position not only in traditional soft luxury goods like clothing and handbags, but also in what is known as the hard luxury sector, which includes watches and jewelry.

The agreement with Tiffany, known for its signature blue boxes and a prominent role in the Audrey Hepburn film “Breakfast at Tiffany’s,” is the second major investment in an American brand for LVMH this year since it created a new luxury house, Fenty, with Rihanna, the musician-actor-style setter. Tiffany has worked to attract younger shoppers, whose shopping preferences (and marital habits) might weigh on the company’s results. Tiffany is truly an American icon.

Mr. Arnault, who has in recent years swept brands like Belmond, the luxury travel group that owns hotels such as the Cipriani in Venice, and Rimowa luggage into the fold at LVMH, said he first went to the Tiffany’s store located on Fifth Avenue when he was living in New York in the 1980s. And he has kept an even closer eye on the brand over the last 18 months as he has mulled other acquisition opportunities.

The deal will leverage LVMH’s presence and expertise in China to help Tiffany expand in the region, where the companies will look to bring more of their goods to mainland consumers in an effort to tap into their spending power. Chinese tourist spending has been hit hard by the depreciation of the renminbi, the trade war between the United States and China and protests in Hong Kong. Mr. Arnault said he believed the brand had real potential to expand its reach in Europe.

Tiffany is “strong in the U.S. and Japan, but weak in Europe and not up to growth in China,” said Arnault. “There we can help a lot, find the best locations,” he added. Arnault said he hoped to follow the same model at Tiffany that helped bolster sales and profitability at Bulgari, which LVMH acquired in 2011.

“We will focus on building long-term desirability,” he said. “When you are an independent brand listed on the American stock exchange, your goal has to be the next quarter profit. We can free them to have a different state of mind in the company.”

LVMH’s share price opened 1.8 percent higher after the agreement was announced and ended trading on Monday up 2.3 percent. The company performed well in 2019; its stock has climbed 58 percent since the beginning of the year, and its sales jumped 11 percent in the third quarter, despite worries about a slowing global economy and protests in Hong Kong. According to published reports, shares for Tiffany have struggled to gain traction this year, but jumped in October on news of the deal talks.

For the 12 months that ended January 31, the jeweler reported $586.4 million in net income; a 58 percent increase from the year before. The deal, which still requires the approval of Tiffany’s shareholders, is expected to close in the middle of next year. Besides Tiffany’s business and growth prospects, and the fact that, like Louis Vuitton, it is sold only through its own network of stores, Mr. Arnault said he was attracted to one unusual aspect of the Tiffany profile. “It’s the only brand I know that owns a color,” Arnault said.

Rose’s Scoop: The song “I Don’t Care” continues to be popular. The song by English singer-songwriter Ed Sheeran and Canadian singer Justin Bieber was released on May 10, 2019, as the lead single from Sheeran’s fourth studio album, No. 6 Collaborations Project. Sheeran previewed the song on his Instagram on May 5, 2019, and Bieber shared another part of the song the following day, before both artists announced the full title and release."
