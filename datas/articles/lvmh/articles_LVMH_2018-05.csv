Louis Vuitton owner LVMH turns to e-commerce with Lyst investment - Style,"Fri, 25 May 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjbXAuY29tL21hZ2F6aW5lcy9zdHlsZS9mYXNoaW9uLWJlYXV0eS9hcnRpY2xlLzIxNDc4MjYvbG91aXMtdnVpdHRvbi1vd25lci1sdm1oLXR1cm5zLWUtY29tbWVyY2UtbHlzdNIBcmh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLnNjbXAuY29tL21hZ2F6aW5lcy9zdHlsZS9mYXNoaW9uLWJlYXV0eS9hcnRpY2xlLzIxNDc4MjYvbG91aXMtdnVpdHRvbi1vd25lci1sdm1oLXR1cm5zLWUtY29tbWVyY2UtbHlzdA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"London-based Lyst did not disclose how much it had raised in its latest financing round which was led by LVMH and included other investors.

Louis Vuitton owner LVMH has invested in online fashion search business Lyst, as the world’s biggest luxury brands look to expand their presence online and capture younger shoppers.

The total investment raised was between £50 million and £100 million pounds (US$67 to US$134 million), a source familiar with the matter said.

LVMH could not be reached for immediate comment.

Long wary that e-commerce would not sit well with their exclusive image, luxury brands are now piling into the market, chasing young consumers comfortable with buying expensive items online, and especially web-savvy buyers in China.

LVMH last year launched 24 Sevres, its own multibrand shopping site, while Cartier owner Richemont is taking full control of rival platform Yoox Net-a-Porter.

Peers in this segment also include Farfetch, tipped for a US stock market listing this year, and Matchesfashion.com, now majority owned by private equity firm Apax.

Lyst operates as a search engine connecting shoppers to items they are seeking on multibrand sites or fashion label’s own e-commerce pages, taking commissions when purchases go through.

Lyst said it would use the latest funding to expand into new regions and languages – it has just launched in French – as well as to invest in technology, including to improve search algorithms.





“Today 60 per cent of our business comes from the United States, and we’re planning to expand into Europe and Asia in the next 18 months,” Chris Morton, Lyst’s co-founder and chief executive, said in an emailed comment.

The firm’s existing investors include venture capital firms Accel, Balderton, Draper Esprit, 14W and a US hedge fund, Morton said.

LVMH’s digital chief Ian Rogers will sit on Lyst’s board following the group’s investment.

Bernard Arnault, the billionaire boss of LVMH, invested in a previous Lyst financing round through his family office in 2015.

"LVMH and Kering are Rivaling Energy, Pharma Giants for Top Stock Index Spots - The Fashion Law","Thu, 17 May 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWZhc2hpb25sYXcuY29tL2x2bWgtYW5kLWtlcmluZy1hcmUtcml2YWxpbmctZW5lcmd5LXBoYXJtYS1naWFudHMtZm9yLXRvcC1zdG9jay1tYXJrZXQtc3BvdHMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Almost exactly a year ago, LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, the Paris-based conglomerate that own Louis Vuitton, Christian Dior, Givenchy, and Celine, became France’s biggest company by market value. In nabbing the top spot, the Bernard Arnault-owned group ousted energy giant Total and pharmaceutical behemoth Sanofi, which had shared the title of the most valuable for nearly a decade.

“A 200 percent rise in value since the start of 2016, and more than 70 percent over the past 12 months, has now put the owner of ‘it bag’ brands within shouting distance of the top five stocks in the [French stock market index] CAC 40,” according to Bloomberg. And LVMH is not alone. Rival Kering – which owns Gucci, Balenciaga, Saint Laurent, and Bottega Veneta and sits in the number-7 spot on the CAC – joins LVMH’s “spectacular rise in fortunes, fueled by booming demand from Asia and millennials for designer handbags, flashy shoes and clothes as expensive as jewels.”

Last year alone, Kering’s stock recorded an increase of more than 33 percent, the largest increase of the year on the CAC 40, per French daily newspaper Le Parisien.

Such growth is “reshaping the French benchmark, long the realm of energy, infrastructure, financial and telecommunications stocks,” with France’s two biggest luxury giants particularly “well managed and more successful than others in attracting new clients globally via e-commerce, without cannibalizing their traditional business,” Christian Guyot, analyst at Invest Securities in Paris, said in an interview.

Meanwhile, holding court in the number-2 biggest company by market value spot is Total, the multinational integrated oil and gas company and one of the seven “Supermajor” oil companies in the world, which dipped to second place last May, prompting French publications to declare: “It’s better to sell Dior dresses and Louis Vuitton bags than to extract and refine oil!”"
LVMH Tops Deloitte's Annual Top 100 Luxury Companies List - WWD,"Mon, 21 May 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3dkLmNvbS9mZWF0dXJlL2x2bWgtdG9wcy1kZWxvaXR0ZS1hbm51YWwtdG9wLTEwMC1sdXh1cnktY29tcGFuaWVzLWxpc3QtMTIwMjY3ODA0Mi_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"MILAN — The world’s 100 largest luxury goods companies generated sales of $216.6 billion in the 2016 fiscal year.

This is what emerged from the fifth edition of “Global Powers of Luxury Goods,” consultancy Deloitte’s annual study focusing on the top 100 global players in fashion and luxury.

At constant currency, the growth rate of said companies was 1 percent, 5.8 percentage points lower than the currency-adjusted growth achieved in the previous year. According to the study, in 2016 the average sales per company were $2.2 billion.

The world’s top 10 names in 2016, which contributed to 47 percent of total sales, were the same as in the previous three years, although six companies swapped places within this group.

Stable at the top of the ranking, the LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton conglomerate posted sales of $23.4 billion, more than double those of the second-place Estée Lauder Cos. Inc. Both reported a 5 percent growth in revenues compared to the previous year.

Registering sales of $11.8 billion, Estée Lauder replaced Compagnie Financière Richemont SA’s spot in the ranking, as the Swiss luxury company dropped to third place, with revenues down 3.9 percent to $11.6 billion in 2016. Despite this, Richemont’s 11.4 percent net profit margin was still the 11th highest in the top 100 list, in general.

Luxottica Group and Kering were stable in fourth and fifth position, respectively, posting sales of $10 billion and $9.4 billion. In particular, the former’s eyewear business increased 2.8 percent in 2016, while Kering had the strongest growth in the top 10, up 7.7 percent, driven largely by Gucci.

L’Oréal Luxe overtook The Swatch Group Ltd.’s sixth position, registering an estimated $8.4 billion in sales. The Swatch Group reported the biggest fall in sales in the chart, down 10.7 percent to levels last seen in 2011, followed by Ralph Lauren Corp., whose sales decreased 10.2 percent. Declining profitability, with net profit margin down 1.5 percent, made Ralph Lauren the worst-performing company in the top 10 ranking.

Completing the list, PVH Corp.’s sales grew 5.6 percent to $6.6 billion, overtaking Hong Kong-based jeweler Chow Tai Fook, which dropped to 10th place, reporting a 9.4 percent decrease in sales.

Geographically, Italy is the leading luxury goods country, with 24 companies listed in the top 100 — with Prada Group, Giorgio Armani SpA, OTB SpA and Salvatore Ferragamo SpA among the names included along with Luxottica Group — followed by the U.S., which counted 13 players; the U.K. with 10 names, and France and Switzerland with nine firms each. Nevertheless, in terms of size, Italian companies registered average sales of $1.4 billion compared to the French, American and Swiss firms, which totaled average sales of $5.4 billion, $3.4 billion and $3.1 billion, respectively.

In particular, Italy’s presence is strong in the top 20 fastest-growing companies list, accounting for six out of the 20 players mentioned. Valentino SpA and Furla SpA are the Italian companies registering the highest compound annual growth rate of sales in the period spanning from 2014 to 2016, with 26.9 and 25.8 percent, respectively. In general, the list is topped by Canada Goose Holdings Inc., followed by Pandora A/S, which registered two-year compound annual growth rates of 36 and 30.3 percent, respectively.

In terms of product categories, the study shows sales of clothing and footwear were quite stable, increasing just 0.2 percent, while bags and accessories were up 3.4 percent. In 2016, sales of cosmetics and fragrances climbed 7.6 percent, while watches and jewelry suffered, decreasing 4 percent."
The LVMH Prize finalist finding the beauty in fragility - Dazed,"Thu, 24 May 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhemVkZGlnaXRhbC5jb20vZmFzaGlvbi9hcnRpY2xlLzQwMTM2LzEvdGhlLWx2bWgtcHJpemUtZmluYWxpc3QtZmluZGluZy10aGUtYmVhdXR5LWluLWZyYWdpbGl0eS1yb2staHdhbmctcm9raNIBgQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kYXplZGRpZ2l0YWwuY29tL2Zhc2hpb24vYXJ0aWNsZS80MDEzNi8xL3RoZS1sdm1oLXByaXplLWZpbmFsaXN0LWZpbmRpbmctdGhlLWJlYXV0eS1pbi1mcmFnaWxpdHktcm9rLWh3YW5nLXJva2g_YW1wPTE?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"After cutting his teeth at Céline and Louis Vuitton, Korean designer Rok Hwang founded his own label – Rokh

Text Dominic Cadogan

In just under two weeks, the winner of this year’s LVMH Prize will be announced. Among the nine finalists hoping to snatch €300,000 and a year’s worth of mentorship are A-COLD-WALL*’s Samuel Ross, Charles Jeffrey, and Dazed 100er Ludovic de Saint Sernin. And while his label is still in its infancy – it was founded in 2016 – London-based designer Rok Hwang (of label Rokh) is also in the running for the accolade. Originally studying menswear at Central Saint Martins, Hwang was convinced to pursue womenswear by late legendary tutor Louise Wilson, and, following his graduation, decided to work in the industry rather than starting his own label immediately. After stints working at Louis Vuitton, Chloé, and Céline under Phoebe Philo, the designer decided to put those lesson to the test with his own brand. “Luxury can be many different terms – you can have a strong visual – but the quality of the garment has to be there too,” Hwang explains. “We want to do everything in the correct way, and not rush it and put out something that is a miscommunication” – Rok Hwang Since then, Rokh has become known for its ultra-chic subverted classics. Think deconstructed trench coats and traditional menswear fabrics reinterpreted in feminine silhouettes. Distancing himself from the ‘strong woman’ narrative, Hwang instead wants to highlight the beauty in fragility. For the label’s first few collections, models always appeared in Margiela-esque facial coverings, protecting them from viewers. “If you think of it as a movie, strong women would be action, but my approach is more like creating a documentary,” he says. Despite the increased attention around him and his label, Hwang is not letting it change his approach and is intent on staying as humble as possible. “I always like to say it as ‘we’ – it’s teamwork,” he tells us of his team. “Nothing can be done alone.” He isn’t in a rush to grow the brand suddenly either, even if he takes home the competition’s top prize. “We want to do everything in the correct way, and not rush it and put out something that is a miscommunication,” Hwang continues. “I don’t want to burn the brand!” Here, we talk with the designer on launching Rokh, and what his plans are for the future.

What made you want to work in the industry after graduating, rather than starting your own label? Rok Hwang: I think there was a lot of interest from people asking me to start my own brand but I trusted my gut and felt like I wasn’t ready to do it. I saw many people who had started and then failed and I didn’t want to go down that route. I wanted to go and actually experience the industry. You worked at labels like Céline, Chloé, and Louis Vuitton. What did you learn there? Rok Hwang: Phoebe (Philo) is a very empowering person and she has such a good way of looking at clothes, so for me to learn that was critical – the construction of the garment or the position of the cutting. My biggest lesson was understanding the work that you have to put in and that nothing comes easy. I also think on a social level, understanding how many people it takes to create something, or even just to do a shoot – you need the right person who can project your vision. As well understanding the construction or the nature of the business, you need to know how it all works, and how to build it. “I always wanted to project my woman as a little fragile, someone who is not that confident. It’s kind of also referring to my own personal emotions that I had during my youth” – Rok Hwang

Was there a specific moment that made you want to start your own label? Rok Hwang: There was never a right moment for me! There are so many people in this industry and they all have their own ambitions, they all want to create their own brand too. I found that through working, everyone still has that kind of dream and I wanted to try it before I get old. When you’re working for someone else, you’re becoming a unit and supporting their vision. I was very happy and lucky to do that, but also I wanted to express my own vision, and this was influenced by something that I always had in mind but never got a chance to express it. I think that it’s now something that I’m trying to project. As a male designer making womenswear, how do you visualise the kind of woman you’re making clothes for? Rok Hwang: I always wanted to project my woman as a little fragile, someone who is not that confident and might be struggling. So it’s kind of also referring to my own personal emotion that I had during my youth and it’s something that I want to express. It’s less mainstream but I think it captures the mood of our generation. Our generation doesn’t have any strong cultural references that we can take from – it’s hard to define us as a generation, so I wanted to create something that mixes that emotion with quality, and luxury, but at the same it has this kind of usefulness. Does the fragility relate to the models having their faces covered in your early visuals? Rok Hwang: It was something that I wanted to try. Now we don’t do it anymore because we are happy with what we’re doing now. In the beginning, I wanted to have a different kind of look and I wanted to express that they wanted to hide from the world or to have complete isolation from the surrounding, and to make it look a little bit more alien. Sometimes you have this feeling that you don’t really get along with society and I kind of wanted to try to make the model as object, but a little bit more disconnected from the scene. Now I feel like our casting and the way that we do things, I can emotionally connect to."

Khan’s Chimera Group and Hakim recently signed a hard contract to buy the majority stake in the Plaza from Subrata Roy’s Sahara Group for $600 million, as TRD first reported Thursday.

Sources familiar with the talks say about 50,000 square feet of shop space, which is accessible from East 58th Street entrance, is in play. The sources emphasized that no deal has yet been reached, however. LVMH’s retail brands include Louis Vuitton, Fendi, Marc Jacobs, Dior and Bulgari.

It was unclear which shops would ultimately come into the space and which existing retailers would vacate. Current shops at the Plaza include jeweler Maurice, fragrance company Krigler and art book seller Assouline. The hotel’s retail component totals 160,000 square feet.

A representative for Khan’s Chimera Group declined to comment. A representative for LVMH in France did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

In 2011, with the basement-level retail shops struggling, then owner Elad Group began an expansion of the Todd English-branded food hall on the same floor.

If Khan and Hakim close on the majority stake purchase of the Plaza, they will be in partnership with the current minority owners, Ashkenazy Acquisition Corporation and Saudi Prince Al-Waleed bin Talal’s Kingdom Holding Company. Khan and Hakim plan to finance the purchase of the Plaza with a more than $400 million loan from the Reuben brothers. They have roughly seven weeks to close the deal.

In February, a Louis Vuitton-anchored retail package in Soho sold for $83 million to Aidan Brooks."
Lev Glazman and Alina Roytberg Talk Founding Fresh Beauty - Coveteur,"Thu, 24 May 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vY292ZXRldXIuY29tLzIwMTgvMDUvMjQvbGV2LWdsYXptYW4tYWxpbmEtcm95dGJlcmctZm91bmRlcnMtZnJlc2gtYmVhdXktYnJhbmQtc3RhcnQv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The first time I met Fresh founders Lev Glazman and Alina Roytberg was over Sangiovese and handmade tagliatelle in a restored castello, Borgo dei Conti (Google it!) in Umbria, Italy. It wasn’t an average deskside (editor-speak for meeting); that was not lost on me. But Lev and Alina—who launched Fresh back in 1991 with individually wrapped soaps for gifting, something I wish I had thought of first (but then again, I was four)—have now grown their humble Bostonian apothecary shop into an LVMH-owned mega-beauty brand. They flew in a cache of international editors and influencers to the “green heart” of Italy to get to know not only them, but one of the first products they launched as part of their foray into skin care over two decades ago, Umbrian clay. It was over this dinner that I realized they were the first (FIRST!) to use sugar as an exfoliant; they were responsible for the milk-in-beauty-product trend of the early aughts; they are the reason beauty companies have been resurrecting long-lost skin-care rituals. They are a very big deal. Over the next few days, I talked to them about how things have changed since LVMH, their cultlike following, collaborating with renowned ceramiche Rometti as the perfect ode to Umbria, and why nature and science are the secret to products worth all their hype.

Why looking to the future was the key to their success:



Lev: “When Alina and I started Fresh back in 1991, every moment of our existence was all about innovation. We always tried to look forward to the future to see what new innovation we could bring to the market.”



Alina: “We brought passion, necessity, but also excitement about what it means to really use a good product and what that means in your life. We loved the idea of transforming everyday routines into sensorial rituals that are as indulgent as they are effective. It’s amazing to think that 26 years later, we’ve grown from one shop in Boston to being present in the U.S., Canada, Mexico, U.K., France, China, Hong Kong, Singapore, Thailand, and South Korea.”

And going around the world helped them discover: LG: “We have always had a passion for traveling, especially for experiencing the world around us through our senses—touching, smelling, eating, walking in interesting places. We realized that there are so many unique ingredients that have been used for centuries in different cultures. Our proprietary Umbrian Clay is a perfect example; the clay has actually been used since the 6th century BC by the Etruscans. I think that’s how these products gain a cult status. They’re rooted in rituals and stories people can relate to—but they’re amplified through modern science, so they’re incredibly effective.”

Why Fresh garnered a cult following: LG: “We think the entire ritual and experience of using a product is as important as the results, and we have always been very devoted to authenticity and craftsmanship.”

How looking to the past made their products revolutionary: AR: “We had a passion for creating authentic products with effective ingredients that carried their own stories. As children growing up in Russia, our medicine cabinets were filled with Western medicine and Eastern natural ingredients. So often our ingredient inspirations came from a time-honored ritual—for example, our grandmothers using sugar on scrapes and burns.” LG: “From there, what Alina and I like to call ‘boundless curiosity’ kicked in. We’d have a hunch that there was a reason behind this ritual, so I would begin researching the ingredients with my chemists in the LVMH Fresh labs outside Paris. We’ve uncovered some incredible curative and scientific properties behind these ingredients. I truly believe all the answers lie in nature. When we take natural ingredients and apply modern science to them, that’s when we really bring revolutionary ideas to the forefront.”

When they realized they “made it”: AR: “When we realized it wasn’t just about Lev and I any longer, but about our whole Fresh Family.”

What changed since the LVMH acquisition:



LG: “The LVMH purchase opened Fresh up to so many amazing resources, like the Fresh Research Lab, which is housed in LVMH’s Helios Research Center in France. This lab is where Fresh alchemy comes to life. The access to LVMH’s incredible technology has allowed us to be even more innovative in transforming our unique artisanal ingredients into effective skin-care products.”

The organic way they discovered one of their hero products: LG: “A longtime friend of mine suffered from cystic acne in her 20s. She moved to Rome, and Alina and I went to visit her. When she opened the door, we almost didn’t recognize her because her skin was so smooth. She said she had visited an herbalista (an Italian homeopathic shop), and they recommended she mix a white clay powder with water into a paste and apply to her face. After a few weeks of daily use, her skin was miraculously clear. We canceled the rest of our travel plans to track down this ‘miracle clay’ in the tiny hilltop town of Nocera Umbra, in Umbria. The mineral-rich clay in the town has been the basis of therapeutic treatments for centuries. “The Umbrian Clay Purifying Mask is one of our most iconic products. The mask is truly amazing, because it can be used on all skin types without drying out the complexion. When the product first came out, we didn’t launch it in a big way, and we’re very excited to do that now and be able to share the rich history behind the ingredient.”"

But he is predisposed to praise the bridal gown because his company owns fashion house Givenchy, which made the dress for Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, who married Prince Harry on Saturday. It was designed by the label's artistic director, Clare Waight Keller. ""I think the dress is marvelous and I think also it fits perfectly what the new princess represents: modernity, diversity and a sense of understated elegance and the result was absolutely marvelous,"" he told CNBC's Karen Tso at the Viva Tech conference in Paris on Thursday.

More than 29 million Americans watched the royal wedding at Windsor Castle in England last Saturday, according to Nielsen data, with 15 channels airing the ceremony. The measure is the number of people who tuned in when it started at midday local time (7 a.m. EST) and finished at 1:15 p.m. The fashion house was founded by Hubert de Givenchy in 1952 and its designs have been worn by famous names including Grace Kelly and former First Lady Jackie Kennedy. Asked whether Givenchy saw a ""Gucci effect,"" or a big moment on social media, Arnault said: ""I think Givenchy is a symbol of elegance since Hubert de Givenchy. You know, Hubert was friends with Audrey Hepburn so it's understated elegance and it's an elegance which is timeless. ""So it lasts for a long time… We try to stay for the long run.""

Arnault clashed with rival Francois-Henri Pinault, who runs French luxury group Kering , at the turn of the millennium. Both were bidding for ownership of Gucci, with Pinault winning the battle, but it is the LVMH-owned Louis Vuitton label that is the world's largest luxury brand by revenues. Luxury groups, like many companies, want to make sure they are using cutting-edge technology to reach shoppers. LVMH is running an innovation award program at Viva Tech, with the winner given the chance to meet with personnel at the luxury group. It also led the latest funding round for fashion search engine and data company Lyst, it was announced Thursday, according to an emailed statement. - CNBC's Sarah Berger contributed to this article."
LVMH invests millions in fashion search engine Lyst - Retail Detail Europe,"Thu, 24 May 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldGFpbGRldGFpbC5ldS9uZXdzL3VuY2F0ZWdvcml6ZWQvbHZtaC1pbnZlc3RzLW1pbGxpb25zLWZhc2hpb24tc2VhcmNoLWVuZ2luZS1seXN0L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"French luxury group LVMH, led by Bernard Arnault, will invest millions of dollars in Lyst once again. The luxury fashion search engine wants to expand its global expansion this way.

Strategic partnership

LVMH, alongside venture capitalists Accel and Balderton, was one of the partners of Lyst’s first capital round. The French will now once again invest a lot of money in Lyst: the actual amount was not revealed, but well-informed sources indicate that the fashion platform attracted at least 50 million pounds (57 million euro). LVMH apparently contributed at least 90 %.

It is obvious the French luxury group pioneered the deal, because its chief digital officer, Ian Rogers, will join Lyst’s board.

Luxury web shop Lyst.com is basically an enormous search engine that brings together the “higher echelons” of thousands of brands, department stores and boutiques’ product range. In the March 2017 – March 2018 period, it allegedly generated a 325 million dollar turnover in clothing (gross merchandise value). Lyst charges a fee, which resulted in a 21 million dollar net turnover.

International expansion

The additional funds and privileged partner LVMH’s strategic input should help speed up the London-based company’s international expansion. Lyst currently generates 60 % of its turnover in the United States, 30 % in Europe and 10 % in Asia, all from an exclusively English website until recently.

A French website launched already and a Spanish and German site will soon follow. “It is not only about the language, but also about a global experience in a local market dynamic, because a French customer is different to a British or American consumer”, co-founder Chris Morton told Business of Fashion.

Lyst and LVMH want to get in on the luxury eCommerce sales, which currently contributes 9 % of the overall luxury market, but that should increase to 20 % according to Bain & Company. Lyst forecasts a 500 million dollar Gross Merchandise Value for this year."

Nicolas Ghesquière, who has been artistic director of women’s collections since 2013, has renewed his contract with LVMH and will continue to helm the label for the considerable future.

Announcing the news, Ghesquière stated: “I am very pleased to open the next chapter of the story I started with Louis Vuitton almost 5 years ago.

The LVMH Nine: A-Cold-Wall – CR Fashion Book - CR Fashion Book,"Wed, 30 May 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vY3JmYXNoaW9uYm9vay5jb20vZmFzaGlvbi1hMjA5NTMxNjktbHZtaC1wcml6ZS0yMDE4LWEtY29sZC13YWxsLXNhbXVlbC1yb3NzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The LVMH Prize is one of the most prestigious fashion design competitions. It propels young designers in front of the eyes of the industry’s most powerful names, offering creative mentorship, financial support, and limelight. As we count down to the final ceremony on June 6, CR spotlights the nine finalists on this year’s roster.

When Samuel Ross launched A-Cold-Wall in 2015, his intention was to explore the working class—hence its name. ‘A-Cold-Wall is an esoteric artist expression that explores the nuances and disparities of the British class system,’ the 26-year-old British designer explains to CR. ‘The name synthesizes the brutalist and geographic nuances.’

The literal interpretation of a wall denotes division, but, Ross insists, ‘a cold wall’ plays with the idea of how architectural structures from both ends of the socioeconomic spectrum (like an Edwardian marble colonnade on one end and public housing scaffolding on the other) can ‘evoke the same sensation for two different social groups.’ In other words, Ross’ concept of ‘a cold wall’ breaks down barriers, and his designs, too—crafted from utilitarian materials, like PVC, latex, nylon, and canvas—transcend sartorial ones. (Ross’ line of concrete objects for the home is a riff on the same notion.)

A graduate of graphic design at De Montfort University, Ross’ talent soon caught the eye of Virgil Abloh, and it landed him a position at Off-White. He’s also previously contributed to Hood by Air and A.P.C. And now, in the three years since A-Cold-Wall’s creation, Ross’ designs have been sold at Barneys New York and Harvey Nichols, he shows during London Fashion Week Men’s, and he’s up for the prestigious 2018 LVMH Award. Here, CR chats with Ross about the streetwear scene, how his designs reflect his surroundings, and his Nike collab.

What attracted you to design, despite not having graduated from fashion school?

My decision to design feels innate. Early childhood memories and photos show a heavy interest in the arts. Design has felt like a natural progression that I have refined throughout my years of studying, reading and experimenting within the arts. Clothing is important, it speaks as though form and structure—a tangible dialogue. This is why I choose to operate within the realm of fashion primarily.

How do you think fashion’s current fascination with streetwear will evolve? What’s A-Cold-Wall’s role in the streetwear scene?

I think the evolution has occurred. We’re seeing brands and narratives that have birthed from the cultivation of streetwear and the influence of luxury fashion.

How do your designs reflect your surroundings?

Geographical influences mean a lot. Looking at intercity maps, roads, buildings, alley ways, parks and district is as impactful to me. I apply that lens of finding tension from the real world and transmitting this mood into garments. These surroundings, narratives, and pockets of information are the heartbeat of A-Cold-Wall.

What has been the most rewarding thing that has happened to you? And the most challenging?

LVMH means a lot, honestly. I’m often short of words to describe the feeling evoked from A-Cold-Wall’s inclusion. Starting the brand and concept as one person and growing it into a efficient business with a team and trusted confidants—this transition was a challenge, something that I believe has to be lived through.

Tell us about your Nike collab—how did you put your own spin on the shoe?

The A-Cold-Wall Air Force 1 high was the first Air Force 1 model to reverse luxury leathers, reduce the number of eyelets down to four, remove the woven tongue label, and radically reposition the logo placement off to the main body of the shoe. The shoe was first shown in January 2017 for our second runway show, and that’s only the beginning of a close, long-term partnership.

Tackling the challenges of the luxury sector through evidence-based research - news.smu.edu.sg,"Thu, 17 May 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vbmV3cy5zbXUuZWR1LnNnL25ld3MvMjAxOC8wNS8xNy90YWNraW5nLWNoYWxsZW5nZXMtbHV4dXJ5LXNlY3Rvci10aHJvdWdoLWV2aWRlbmNlLWJhc2VkLXJlc2VhcmNo0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"2nd LVMH-SMU Luxury Research Conference convenes at SMU

About 180 local and overseas academics, corporate partners, LVMH executives as well as SMU faculty and staff gathered at the Singapore Management University (SMU) on 10 and 11 May 2018 for the second edition of the LVMH-SMU Luxury Research Conference. This one-of-its-kind Conference was organised as part of a five-year strategic partnership – LVMH-SMU Asia Luxury Brand Research Initiative (2014-2019), which aims to produce and deliver independent and high quality academic research dedicated to the luxury brand sector and the Asian market.

This year, nearly 60 research papers were received from scholars representing institutions worldwide, including Columbia University, Los Angeles (UCLA), Peking University; ESSEC; Harvard Business School and Northwestern University. The Conference provided a unique platform for the exchange of insights and ideas between academic and industry, as research papers covering a range of pertinent themes were presented and discussed with active participation by executives from LVMH.

Opening the Conference was Professor Gerard George, Dean of SMU Lee Kong Chian School of Business. He highlighted that the LVMH-SMU partnership exemplifies the benefits of a convergence between academia and industry. “The ultimate reason for this partnership is to develop evidence-based insights to tackle some of the challenges faced by the luxury sector… The foundation of our collaboration is in co-creating knowledge about this industry,” he said.

He iterated that talent development is another important equation of the LVMH-SMU partnership. In fact, both organisations have invested time and resources into this endeavour. About 500 SMU students have participated in the SMU-LVMH Immersion Programme since 2014, and about 100 students have taken up internship positions at LVMH since the partnership was established.

Prof George, who is professor of entrepreneurship and innovation, also complimented LVMH for its ability to maintain its high standing through generations, and doing so in an entrepreneurial way.

Mr Christopher Kilaniotis, President, Louis Vuitton South Asia, echoed Prof George’s comments when he spoke about the significance of the partnership and conference. He said that this partnership takes place at a crucial time of time of the luxury sector. “We are going through unprecedented times – a new generation is changing luxury, millenials are the present and the future. They also love something I didn’t grow up with – digital devices, smart phones… and to me that’s data. Data not only gives us academic papers, it can also give us vision, strategy and precise information,” said Mr Kilaniotis, who candidly added that he started wearing sneakers to work two years ago because the company was selling more sneakers to millennials than leather lace-up shoes.

The power of data was certainly clear in the presentation by Sephora and SMU which followed. SMU Associate Professor of Marketing Sandeep Chandukala shared how the University worked with Sephora to collect data on the usage behaviour of its Virtual Artist fixture in Singapore’s stores where customers can experiment with an infinite library of eyeshadows, lip colours etc. through augmented reality technology. The research enabled Sephora to better understand the effectiveness of the fixture design, customer preference and purchase behaviour.

In another research, SMU’s Doctoral Candidate Tan Yong Chin used sequence analysis to help Sephora understand its customers’ purchase journey in skincare, so as to develop effective marketing strategies to encourage purchase.

In the remaining 1.5 days of the Conference, participants benefitted from invaluable insights from presentations and discussions covering a range of topics including luxury consumers and markets in China, India and Southeast Asia; Corporate Social Responsibility in Luxury; Millennials and Luxury; Digital and Social Media in Luxury; Perceptive Luxury; and Impact of Counterfeits on Luxury brands.

On the successful organisation of the conference, Professor Srinivas Reddy, Academic Director of the LVMH-SMU Luxury Brand Initiative and Director, SMU Centre for Marketing Excellence, said, ""Based on the response that I have heard from the audience, this is a tremendous example of what can happen when practitioners and academics collaborate and answer relevant and important questions for the industry.""

It is without doubt that there is much anticipation for the Conference to convene again in two years' time. In the meantime, here's a video montage of the event to give you a glimpse of the robust exchange which took place between academia and industry - https://youtu.be/5Vzr8nwT3K4
