How luxury giant LVMH built a recession-proof empire - CNBC,"Thu, 18 May 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tLzIwMjMvMDUvMTgvaG93LWx1eHVyeS1naWFudC1sdm1oLWJ1aWx0LWEtcmVjZXNzaW9uLXByb29mLWVtcGlyZS5odG1s0gFdaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY25iYy5jb20vYW1wLzIwMjMvMDUvMTgvaG93LWx1eHVyeS1naWFudC1sdm1oLWJ1aWx0LWEtcmVjZXNzaW9uLXByb29mLWVtcGlyZS5odG1s?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Luxury giant LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, more commonly known as LVMH , has grown into a $500 billion powerhouse conglomerate of 75 distinguished brands, or ""maisons,"" rooted in six different sectors — with no plans to slow down.

The company recorded revenue of 79.2 billion euros, or about $86.3 billion, last year, an increase of 23% from 2021 revenue. Its store count has more than quintupled over the past two decades, with locations across 81 countries and more than 196,000 employees worldwide.

Its stock reached an all-time high in April of above $199 per share, making the Paris-based firm the first European company to surpass $500 billion in market value.

Some experts have long-hailed the company as ""recession-proof,"" able to sustain itself through economic downturns and boasting products that uniquely appreciate over time.

At the helm of the massive ship is LVMH CEO Bernard Arnault, the world's richest person according to the Forbes real-time billionaires index.

Some say Arnault's strength lies in identifying companies with longevity. His most recent acquisition was Tiffany & Co. for $15.8 billion in 2021.

""When he talks about potential acquisitions, he's not looking for the brand that's hot right now. He's looking for a brand that he thinks can be here 100 years from now,"" said Anish Melwani, chairman and CEO of LVMH for North America.

Through Arnault, LVMH plays ""the long-term game,"" said Oliver Chen, managing director at TD Cowen. That keeps the company's brands in good shape in terms of integrity, perception and relevance, he said.

Though managed by LVMH, each maison has creative control over its own brand, with its own C-suite executives and mission.

""That loss of efficiency that other companies would just put a bunch of brands together and have them run by one person, what we get is that true accountability,"" Melwani said.

This is reflected in LVMH's ability to consistently deliver products that build on its brands' legacies, in conjunction with current trends and culture. LVMH consistently collaborates with celebrities, fashion icons and influencers in order to stay relevant for the younger luxury crowd.

Melwani said that after the Covid pandemic the company is focused on expanding its brick-and-mortar stores, which are needed due to the extraordinary growth from LVMH's e-commerce and digital channels.

Remaining relevant is key to longevity in luxury — and LVMH's strategy in building a brand that not only endures but continues to excel.

Effective June 1, de Pirey will succeed Michael David, who was named chief omnichannel officer in 2021.

More from WWD

De Pirey reports to Antonio Belloni, group managing director of LVMH. His appointment comes as generative artificial intelligence is adopted by a growing number of retailers, and as e-commerce adapts to a volatile environment overshadowed by the cost of living crisis.

He was subsequently named global senior vice president new ventures at Sephora, initiating new partnerships including a long-term strategic deal with Zalando to create a prestige beauty experience online.

“He has extensive experience in omnichannel business across industries and countries. As the leader of Sephora’s new ventures, he has shown the ability to drive breakthrough initiatives for our customers and business. These assets will be key to accelerate the progress of maisons and regions in leveraging the power of technology and data,” Belloni said in an internal memo shared with WWD.

De Pirey will manage the group centers of competence for omnichannel, data and artificial intelligence and remote customer service.

He will work closely with Franck Le Moal, LVMH Group IT director; Frédérique Rousseau, LVMH Holding human resources director and other activities; Nelly Mensah, vice president of digital innovation-global head of Web3 and metaverse, and Laetitita Roche-Grenet, open innovation director.

De Pirey will manage a team that includes Olivier Astié, omnichannel and e-commerce director; Anca Marola, chief data officer; Camille Canque, LVMH client services general manager; Lan Luan, senior vice president digital, Asia Pacific, and Larissa Higgins, vice president digital, North America.

“His teams will work with innovation thought leading companies, and with our maisons to offer a more integrated and elevated experience to customers across touchpoints, and to increase the efficiency and responsiveness of the supply chains,” LVMH said.

De Pirey has worked as a senior executive in industries including retail, high performance materials and commodities in France, Russia, China and Germany.

LVMH's Bernard Arnault Has a Secret NFT Collection - Observer,"Wed, 03 May 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiN2h0dHBzOi8vb2JzZXJ2ZXIuY29tLzIwMjMvMDUvbHZtaC1iZXJuYXJkLWFybmF1bHQtbmZ0cy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Bernard Arnault, CEO of luxury conglomerate LVMH (LVMHF), has a private non-fungible token (NFT) collection despite his public displays of skepticism toward the digital asset.

“Oh, there’s no question,” said Ian Rogers, the former chief digital officer at LVMH, when asked whether Arnault purchases NFTs on a recent episode of the Aarthi and Sriram’s Good Time Show podcast.

“I don’t think he’d mind if I said this—he has shown me, of his own volition, his OpenSea page,” said Rogers, referencing a digital NFT marketplace. “Which means he had to pull out his phone, find it, and then take me through it. So, yes.”

SEE ALSO: The NFT Renaissance Beyond Digital Collectibles

Arnault, the world’s richest person with a net worth of $204 billion, joins the ranks of other billionaires who have built collections of the digital artwork. Investor and Shark Tank judge Mark Cuban, who is worth $6.5 billion, is an avid NFT collector, as are Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, who co-founded crypto exchange Gemini and have a combined net worth of $3 billion.

NFTs have fetched millions in recent years. Beeple’s Everdays: The First 5000 Days remains the most expensive NFT to date, after selling for $69.3 million in 2021 at a Christie’s auction, while Clock by anonymous artist Pak sold for $52.7 million in February of 2022.

Why did Arnault change his mind on NFTs?

The revelation of Arnault’s collection marks a sharp turn from his previous warnings regarding NFTs. “We are very much in the real world,” he said during a January 2022 LVMH earnings call. “We are not interested in selling a pair of virtual sneakers for 10 euros.”

The LVMH head also warned that NFTs may represent a “bubble” that could soon burst, comparing it to the beginning of the Internet in the 2000s, when “there were all sorts of things cropping up left, right and center.”

However, Arnault noted that the concept was “thought-provoking” and that “there may be more relevant applications” where NFTs generate profit.

LMVH has occasionally dabbled in digital tokens through its numerous companies, adding NFTs to a mobile game for Louis Vuitton and releasing Fendi accessories for a cryptocurrency wallet. But the luxury conglomerate’s most enthusiastic NFT ventures have been led by two of Arnault’s children, Alexandre and Frederic, both of whom are avid NFT collectors.

Alexandre, whose Twitter profile picture is an NFT from the CryptoPunks collection, is currently the executive vice president of product and communications at Tiffany & Co. After turning his CryptoPunk into a pendant made of sapphires, rubies and diamonds, Tiffany released “NFTiff,” which provides other CryptoPunk owners the opportunity to purchase jewelry inspired by their NFTs for around $50,000.

Meanwhile, Frederic also has an NFT as his Twitter profile image, this one from the Bored Ape Yacht Club collection. As CEO of Tag Heuer, he launched a smartwatch in 2022 with a watch face that displays NFTs.

In addition to collecting NFTs, Arnault is a prominent collector of blue-chip artwork. Listed alongside his wife Helene as the wealthiest couple in the 2020 list of top 200 collectors by Artnews, his collection includes works by Pablo Picasso, Andy Warhol and Damien Hirst.

In 2014, Arnault opened Fondation Louis Vuitton, a private museum and cultural space, in Paris. Designed by architect Frank Gehry, the property houses a permanent collection of works owned by LVMH and Arnault and hosts temporary exhibitions."
LVMH Perfumes and Cosmetics Unveils Asia R&D Center in Shanghai - WWD,"Tue, 02 May 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vd3dkLmNvbS9zdXN0YWluYWJpbGl0eS9pbm5vdmF0aW9uL2x2bWgtcGVyZnVtZXMtYW5kLWNvc21ldGljcy1hc2lhLXJlc2VhcmNoLWRldmVsb3BtZW50LWNlbnRlci1zaGFuZ2hhaS0xMjM1NjM3ODYxL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LONDON — Doubling down on its commitment to the Chinese market, LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton last month unveiled its first high-end cosmetics R&D center in Shanghai, days before Bernard Arnault, chairman and chief executive officer of LVMH, met with Wang Wentao, China’s minister of commerce, at Dior’s Avenue Montaigne flagship in Paris.

With a mission to “take root in Asia and China and create the beauty of the world,” LVMH Perfumes and Cosmetics’s Asia R&D Center will enable maisons under the group’s beauty business to gain insight into local consumers’ shopping behaviors, cutting-edge technology, and raw materials development, formula innovation, as well as working with the French R&D center to localize new concepts.

Billed as the biggest R&D center for LVMH in Asia, it takes up more than 23,000 square feet. It comes with skin care, makeup and color development laboratories, product testing rooms, and workshop space in Jinqiao on the outskirts of Shanghai. The center also has a consumer hub that’s equipped with several testing areas. It sits together with LVMH’s China head office at Plaza 66 in downtown Shanghai.

Andrew Wu, president of LVMH Greater China, feted the opening of the center with Bruno Bavouzet, executive vice president of LVMH Recherche, the group’s research and development arm; Jean-Michel Moutin, chief operating officer at LVMH Perfumes and Cosmetics; Thibaut Teisseire, chief operating officer China at LVMH Perfumes and Cosmetics; Nathalie Renaudeau, human resource director at LVMH Recherche, and Amanda Chen, Asia R&D director at LVMH, among others.

Wu said during the ceremony that LVMH will bring the concept of high-end brands and the group’s research and development strength to present beauty products that are more innovative and better meet the diverse needs of Asian consumers, and improve the consumer beauty experience to better serve the Asian market.

The inauguration of the center also demonstrates LVMH’s determination to strengthen its ties with Asia, Wu added. He believes that the R&D center marks an important opportunity for the group to learn from Chinese consumers.

“China’s market is becoming more and more important, and so is Asia’s. I believe that the world will be better with the development of China’s market, and China will become stronger and stronger in its interaction with the world,” Wu said, adding that it is one of LVMH’s social responsibilities to actively endorse “the new connection between the Chinese market and the world.”

Bavouzet noted that there are around 700 scientists at the moment who provide research and development services for all beauty brands under the LVMH umbrella, such as Guerlain, Fresh, Make Up For Ever, Christian Dior, Fenty Beauty, and Cha Ling.

Including Shanghai, LVMH Recherche now operates in five locations. The other four are in Seoul, Tokyo, Paris and Saint-Jean-de-Braye, France.

In the first quarter of 2023, LVMH’s perfumes and cosmetics logged a 10 percent improvement in organic revenue growth.

Jean-Jacques Guiony, chief financial officer of LVMH, said during an earnings call that cosmetics remained “a little under pressure in mainland China” in the period, compared to the nation’s robust appetite for fashion, leather goods and jewelry."
"Bernard Arnault, Founder of LVMH and Major Art Collector, Loses $11 B. After Stock Selloff - ARTnews","Wed, 24 May 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFydG5ld3MuY29tL2FydC1uZXdzL25ld3MvYmVybmFyZC1hcm5hdWx0LWZvdW5kZXItbHZtaC1sb3Nlcy0xMS1iaWxsaW9uLXN0b2NrLXNlbGxvdXQtbHV4dXJ5LTEyMzQ2Njk1MDEv0gF4aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYXJ0bmV3cy5jb20vYXJ0LW5ld3MvbmV3cy9iZXJuYXJkLWFybmF1bHQtZm91bmRlci1sdm1oLWxvc2VzLTExLWJpbGxpb24tc3RvY2stc2VsbG91dC1sdXh1cnktMTIzNDY2OTUwMS9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"NEW YORK, NEW YORK - APRIL 27:(L-R) Antoine Arnault, Anya Taylor-Joy, and Bernard Arnault attend as Tiffany & Co. celebrates the reopening of NYC Flagship store, The Landmark, on April 27, 2023, in New York City. (Photo Jamie McCarthy/Getty Images for Tiffany & Co.)

Bernard Arnault, founder of LVMH, lost some $11.2 billion of his personal fortune after a stock selloff saw LVMH shares fall 5 percent in Paris Tuesday, according to a report by Bloomberg. Arnault is still the richest man in the world, but the gap is closing between him and number two: Elon Musk.

LVMH, a luxury conglomerate whose assets include Moët, Hennessy, and Louis Vuitton, was hit with the stock rout after concerns over a flagging luxury market in the United States and China saw a general stock sell-off across the board, with brands like Hermes and Gucci also taking a blow.

However, luxury goods have been on an astounding run since last year, so while these markets have fallen, stock in LVMH is 23 percent higher than it was this time last year. It’s a comparative blip for a man like Arnault, whose fortune ballooned $29.5 billion this year alone, an accumulation that, once again, pushed him over the line to be the richest man in the world, as was confirmed just earlier this April.

Arnault has been a long time force in the art world, both facilitating collaborations between his brands and artists (such as a recent collaboration between Louis Vuitton and Yayoi Kusama) and as a renowned collector himself, along with his wife Hélène. He and his wife are the richest ARTnews Top 200 Collectors and is followed closely behind on the list by his fellow luxury market rival François Pinault.

Yet, Arnault’s most significant contribution to the art world would be Fondation Louis Vuitton, which he founded in in 2014. A now renowned Frank Gehry–designed museum in Paris’s Bois de Boulogne, the museum has hosted blockbuster shows that often center two artists, such as the recent “Monet-Mitchell” show and their current exhibition Basquiat X Warhol.

Arnault’s ties to the art world are so enmeshed that, last fall rumors, swirled that the next LVMH acquisition would be Gagosian gallery—which Gagosian has since denied."

LVMH Concedes Defeat on Cheval Blanc Hotel Project in Beverly Hills - WWD,"Fri, 26 May 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3dkLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy1uZXdzL3JlYWwtZXN0YXRlL2x2bWgtY2hldmFsLWJsYW5jLWhvdGVsLXJvZGVvLWRyaXZlLWJldmVybHktaGlsbHMtdm90ZXItcmVqZWN0aW9uLTEyMzU2NjYxMzgv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The suspense surrounding the future of the LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton multimillion-dollar luxury hotel project is over.

Days after a special election was held on Tuesday showing a slim majority against the project, LVMH issued a statement conceding defeat for its Cheval Blanc hotel proposal on Rodeo Drive.

“Although some votes remain to be counted, it now appears that Measures B and C have fallen short by a narrow margin, overturning the results of a comprehensive, years-long review and approval process,” said Jessica Miller, a LVMH spokesperson. “We are proud to have worked with so many residents, civic leaders and business owners who supported this once-in-a-generation investment that would have delivered hundreds of millions of dollars in city funding and a beautiful gateway project for the Golden Triangle. If the final vote count confirms the voters’ rejection of our project, we will respect the outcome, and will not bring the hotel project back in any form.”

Everyone involved in the project had been anxiously waiting for the final results ever since a special election was held last Tuesday to decide if the project would go forward. A slim majority of 60 votes rejected the hotel venture. But the Los Angeles County Registrar of Voters needed to do two more rounds of vote counting to tabulate provisional ballots, conditional voter registration ballots and mail-in ballots postmarked by election day but arriving later.

The first post-election count on Friday showed the margin against the hotel growing to about 125 votes. The final results will be determined June 2.

John Mirisch, the lone city council member who voted against the project, said he was shocked that the opposing forces won, given the amount of money LVMH spent on the election. “Indeed, the election results — if they hold — show that Beverly Hills is more than just a brand to be monetized. It’s our home,” he said in an email. “Fortunately, there is still a large number of residents who remain committed to fighting the uphill battle for our community against the forces of self-interest and greed.”

LVMH spent three years presenting architectural plans, studies and analyses to make sure the first Cheval Blanc hotel in the U.S. was right for Beverly Hills. Last November, the 109-room hotel spread across Rodeo Drive, Little Santa Monica Boulevard and Beverly Drive, was approved by the Beverly Hills City Council on a 4-1 vote. The council touted that the new development would generate for the city some $778 million in unrestricted funding over the next 30 years, $26 million in non-earmarked funds and $2 million to support local art and culture.

Then an opposition, led by Unite Here Local 11, and locals against the project gathered enough signature to prompt a special election on May 23. When the results came in, they showed the opposition initially leading by a slim 60-vote margin, with 92 percent of the votes coming from mail-in ballots. Voter turnout was 32 percent.

Residents had to vote on two referendums, one approving a zoning variance and another codifying the city’s development agreement with LVMH. The referendum on the zoning variance most recently garnered 3,440 “yes” votes and 3,563 “no” votes. The referendum on the development agreement delivered 3,440 “yes” votes and 3,565 “no” votes.

Many residents believed the $2,000-a-night hotel would change the small-town vibe of the ritzy enclave of 32,000 residents. It would have risen to nine stories along Beverly Drive while reaching a more modest four stories on Rodeo Drive, where LVMH has 15 retail locations for its stable of luxury brands. Construction would have involved tearing down four buildings purchased by LVMH and the removal of more than 5,000 truckloads of debris and dirt."

Richemont Chair Shoots Down Reports of Acquisition by LVMH - National Jeweler,"Mon, 15 May 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vbmF0aW9uYWxqZXdlbGVyLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy8xMTk0Ny1yaWNoZW1vbnQtY2hhaXItc2hvb3RzLWRvd24tcmVwb3J0cy1vZi1hY3F1aXNpdGlvbi1ieS1sdm1o0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"



The Geneva-based company reported Friday that sales for its fiscal year ended March 31 hit an all-time high of €19.95 billion ($21.82 billion), up 19 percent year-over-year (14 percent at constant exchange rates).



Operating profit rose 34 percent to €5.03 billion ($5.50 billion).



Following the company’s release of its full-year results, Chairman Johann Rupert publicly refuted a report that appeared in a Swiss newspaper in February that the company was an acquisition target for competitor LVMH.



According to



Rupert also said Richemont turned down a deal proposed by bankers to merge with Kering two years ago.



During the fiscal year, the company’s jewelry brands—Cartier, Van Cleef & Arpels and Buccellati—posted 21 percent sales growth (16 percent at constant exchange rates).



Richemont said the brands’ “iconic” collections outperformed: “Opera Tulle” and “Macri” at Buccellati, “Trinity,” “Panthère” and “Santos” at Cartier, and “Alhambra,” “Perlée” and “Fauna” at Van Cleef & Arpels.



During the fiscal year, Richemont reopened the Cartier flagship boutiques on Fifth Avenue in New York and in Paris and opened a new Van Cleef & Arpels flagship store in San Francisco.



Sales for Richemont’s watch brands, which include Vacheron Constantin, IWC and Jaeger-LeCoultre, were up 13 percent (8 percent at constant exchange rates).



Like jewelry, it was sales of classic collections that drove watch sales, including “Riviera” for Baume & Mercier, pilot’s watches for IWC, “Reverso” for Jaeger-LeCoultre, and “Overseas” for Vacheron Constantin.



The company opened a new Jaeger-LeCoultre flagship stores in Beverly Hills, California, during the fiscal year.



Geneva—Consumers’ penchant for tried-and-true classics propelled Richemont to a record-breaking year and prompted its chairman to shoot down speculation the luxury conglomerate was up for sale.The Geneva-based company reported Friday that sales for its fiscal year ended March 31 hit an all-time high of €19.95 billion ($21.82 billion), up 19 percent year-over-year (14 percent at constant exchange rates).Operating profit rose 34 percent to €5.03 billion ($5.50 billion).Following the company’s release of its full-year results, Chairman Johann Rupert publicly refuted a report that appeared in a Swiss newspaper in February that the company was an acquisition target for competitor LVMH.According to The Financial Times , he said Richemont is not for sale.

Region-wise, Richemont’s sales in the Americas held up, growing 27 percent year-over-year against strong comps (89 percent sales growth) from the previous fiscal year.



The Americas is Richemont’s second-largest market.



Richemont said sales in the Americas slowed down in the second half of the year, partly due to the fact that Americans shopped overseas because of the strong U.S. dollar, while sales in its largest market, Asia Pacific, gained steam as the Chinese government relaxed COVID restrictions.



Channel-wise, Richemont saw growth in all distribution sectors, with sales in its company-owned stores rising 22 percent, online sales increasing 12 percent, and wholesale sales up 14 percent.



Looking ahead to the new fiscal year, Rupert said in the company’s full-year earnings release that he expects conditions to remain unsettled.



“Economic volatility and political uncertainty look set to remain features of the trading environment,” he said. “The group will therefore seek to maintain the necessary agility to manage fluctuating levels of demand.



“I am confident our maisons are well-positioned to meet strong demand, notably driven by a significant resumption of Chinese travel. Richemont is fortunate to own such a unique portfolio of maisons with excellent long-term prospects.”

"Global Luxury Rebounds: LVMH, Hermès Sales Soar Due To Chinese Spending - Jing Daily","Fri, 05 May 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiPWh0dHBzOi8vamluZ2RhaWx5LmNvbS9wb3N0cy9jaGluYS1sdXh1cnktc3BlbmRpbmctbHZtaC1oZXJtZXPSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"What happened

The luxury industry is seeing its first major boost in sales since China’s reopening after years of lockdown and economic uncertainty. Luxury spending in China is outpacing the country’s overall retail sales and economic growth, according to The New York Times . In March, sales of gold, silver and fine jewelry increased by 37.4 percent year on year — the strongest March performance for jewelry sales on record, according to figures from China’s National Bureau of Statistics.

The Jing Take

While it has only been a few months since China reopened its borders, all eyes are on the nation as Chinese consumers begin to resume “normal” spending patterns. China’s GDP rose by 4.5 percent in the first quarter of 2023, up from 2.9 percent the year before — its largest jump in recent years, thanks to a boost in retail and property sales, according to reports .

Luxury brands are taking note, as many scramble to enhance their presence, campaigns and consumer-facing experiences in the nation.

In April, it was announced that French luxury conglomerate LVMH, which owns Dior, Tiffany, Sephora and other brands, plans to open its first Louis Vuitton flagship store in Hainan — one of China’s rising domestic tourism and duty-free shopping hubs. The two-story store is opening amid talk of Louis Vuitton raising its prices by 20 percent this year.

The brand more recently unveiled its first furniture and homewares store in Shanghai in November 2022. Despite the nation’s continued lockdowns at the time, Louis Vuitton’s bet on launching its first appointment-only furniture showroom in China appears to have paid off.

Parent company LVMH recently surpassed 500 billion in market value after reporting a 17 percent rise in total sales in the first quarter compared with the year before. Its fashion and leather goods division also experienced an 18 percent jump in sales due to spending by Chinese consumers.

Meanwhile, other brands including Brunello Cucinelli and Hermès saw sales rise by 56 percent and 23 percent, respectively, over the first quarter as retail consumption in China bounces back.

Globally, China was responsible for 41 percent of new luxury store openings in 2022, according to Savill’s latest Global Luxury Retail Outlook . In comparison, Europe drove 23 percent of global luxury store openings, while the Middle East doubled its growth to account for 6 percent.

It’s evident Chinese consumption remains a crucial driver for the global luxury market’s rebound in 2023.

“We expect China to be the luxury industry’s key growth engine this year, especially given a slight deceleration in other core markets like the U.S. and Korea… Much of the initial spend driving the rebound is, for now, less to do with the middle class of China and more to do with rich people spending more,” a Morgan Stanley analyst stated in the aforementioned Times report.

Richemont Shoots Down Reports of LVMH Takeover Interest - The Business of Fashion,"Fri, 12 May 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzb2ZmYXNoaW9uLmNvbS9uZXdzL2x1eHVyeS9yaWNoZW1vbnQtc2hvb3RzLWRvd24tcmVwb3J0cy1vZi1sdm1oLXRha2VvdmVyLWludGVyZXN0L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Richemont, the Swiss luxury goods maker that owns the Cartier brand, reported earnings that beat analysts’ estimates as sales in China rebounded following the end of Covid Zero policies.

Operating profit was €5.03 billion ($5.5 billion) and sales rose 14 percent at constant currencies in the year through March, Richemont said Friday, beating analysts’ estimates. The stock rose as much as 5.9 percent to a record in Geneva.

The company’s chairman, billionaire Johann Rupert, said economic volatility and political uncertainty look set to continue. He said the company’s brands are well-positioned to meet strong demand, driven by the resumption of travel by customers from China. Rivals LVMH and Prada have recently reported better-than-expected first-quarter revenue due to stronger demand in China.

However Rupert said Chinese consumers have been cautious on spending following the end of the Covid rules, and that the company doesn’t expect demand there to rebound as strongly as US demand did after the end of pandemic measures. While individuals from China are traveling again, large group trips haven’t yet recovered amid high costs for flights, he said.

The US is at risk of a downturn as the country will go through a credit contraction, Rupert also said, speaking on a call with reporters.

“Brands with strong pricing power are likely to emerge as the winners in the coming months,” wrote Jean-Philippe Bertschy, an analyst at Vontobel. “Richemont is very well positioned with Cartier, Van Cleef & Arpels or Vacheron Constantin. The company has everything in place for further market share gains.”

Rupert shot down suggestions that bigger rival LVMH had its sights set on acquiring Richemont, which in addition to Cartier and Van Cleef & Arpels, owns a slew of high-end luxury watch brands. Rupert said he has had frequent discussions with LVMH Chairman Bernard Arnault, but that Richemont was not for sale.

“We’re in constant dialogue and we respect each other’s independence,” he said of LVMH.

Richemont also decided against a deal with Kering SA two years ago when investment bankers proposed one, Rupert said. “Why would we want to? We know what we have,” he said.

The company also announced plans to buy back as many as 10 million A shares, representing 1.7 percent of the company’s capital. The shares will be held in treasury to hedge awards to executives and employee’s under the company’s long-term incentive plan. Based on Thursday’s share price, a stake of that size would be worth 1.5 billion francs ($1.7 billion).

Fiona Druckenmiller, the founder of FD Gallery, a New York boutique that offers vintage and pre-owned jewelry, is set to join the board of directors. Her husband, Stan Druckenmiller, is the billionaire founder of Duquesne Family Office and managed money for billionaire George Soros for more than a decade. A third of the board members will be women at the next shareholder meeting.

"Up 30% YTD, is LVMH Stock (OTC:LVMUY) Immune to Downturns? - TipRanks.com - TipRanks","Tue, 16 May 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRpcHJhbmtzLmNvbS9uZXdzL2FydGljbGUvdXAtMzAteXRkLWlzLWx2bWgtc3RvY2stb3RjbHZtdXktaW1tdW5lLXRvLWRvd250dXJuc9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Fashionistas around the world love to sport Louis Vuitton! Is it the same with investors, too, when considering LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton (GB:0HAU) (OTC:LVMUY) stock? One look at the stock’s chart, and you will be taken aback by the upward-sloping curve LVMH has almost always been on. Over the past five years, the U.S. listing of LVMH has returned nearly 179% to its shareholders. Year-to-date, the stock has already run up over 30%. So the answer is yes, LVMH is indeed a stock that looks immune to recessions/downturns. I am bullish on LVMH.

Being the proud owner of 75 luxury brands across five business segments, Louis Vuitton recently showed the world that the premium luxury space remains unfazed by any macro concerns. Three weeks ago, the stock achieved a milestone after becoming the first European company to reach a $500 billion market cap. Now, let’s take a look at the stock’s results and factors deciding its future course.

LVMH Delivered Blowout Q1 Earnings

Last month, LVMH reported upbeat Q1 numbers with an outstanding performance across all business segments despite a cloudy macroeconomic outlook and inflationary pressures. The outperformance was driven by a recovery in sales in the Asian region aided by the easing of lockdowns in China. It’s no wonder then that LVMH stock received upward price target revisions from several Wall Street analysts.

The owner of brands like Louis Vuitton, Dior, Moet, Hennessy, Bulgari, and U.S. jeweler Tiffany, reported robust organic sales growth of 17%. That was aided by growth across all regions except the U.S., where it was light at 8%. Specifically, Asia saw 14% growth during the quarter compared to a decline of 8% reported in the prior quarter. China continues to remain one of the most important regions, with high growth expectations.

Resilient Demand for Luxury Unabated by Recession

So, investors must be wondering if the current quarterly number is just a one-off surprise aided by a fierce return of Chinese consumers or if this going to be consistent in the forthcoming results. The answer is that it’s not just LVMH. There has been an upsurge in demand in the overall luxury segment.

Peers like Hermès International (GB:0HV2) (OTC:HESAF), best known for its coveted Birkin handbag, also reported strong double-digit sales growth. Further, even German luxury performance automaker Porsche reported upbeat Q1 results, with strong sales growth of 25.5%

Clearly unaffected by the economic challenges, the aficionados of luxury goods continue to indulge! As a result, luxury goods companies continue to see higher-than-expected growth in sales and profits.

It is not surprising that LVMH’s CEO, Bernard Arnault, just got richer. Recently, he became the world’s richest person, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, surpassing Elon Musk of Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA).

Notably, China, being one of the largest luxury markets, will continue to play an important role in spurring the demand for luxury goods across the globe. So far, LVMH has been a beneficiary of this and will continue to gain market share in the coming quarters with its attractive portfolio of brands. For instance, LVMH is planning to expand its presence in China by opening flagship Louis Vuitton stores in various cities.

Is LVMH Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?

The Wall Street community is clearly optimistic about LVMH. As per TipRanks, the company commands a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 15 Buys and one Hold rating. LVMH’s average price target of €962.75 implies 8.6% upside potential from current levels.

Conclusion: Consider LVMH Stock

I believe LVMH can be a fruitful investment. Yes, the stock is seemingly trading at a premium P/E multiple of 31.9x. However, it is trading at much lower levels compared to a major peer like Hermes. For instance, Hermes is trading at essentially double LVMH’s valuation at a P/E of around 64x.

With a well-balanced geographic mix and some very sought-after brands under its radar, LVMH stock has done well across decades, never (or rarely) disappointing investors. That’s why it continues to make newer highs year after year.

Despite its premium valuation, I will buy the stock due to its solid, consistent track record over the years, sticky brand loyalty, and growth potential, aided by a rebound in Chinese demand.

"Dior, Tiffany, Le Creuset: Why we’re buying luxury goods like crazy - Vox.com","Tue, 23 May 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZveC5jb20vbW9uZXkvMjM3MjgyODMvbHV4dXJ5LWRlc2lnbmVyLWJvb20tbmlrZS1sdm1oLXBhbmRlbWljLWxlLWNyZXVzZXTSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The pandemic was a period of mass unemployment and economic hardship for many Americans. It was also a riotously popular time for buying luxury goods.

“2021 and 2022 were blockbuster years for the luxury industry,” says Lauren Sherman, fashion correspondent at Puck News. “The biggest years they’ve ever had — ever.”

Shoppers devoured designer leather handbags, limited-edition sneakers, classic watches, and holy grail prestige beauty products that went viral on TikTok; practically every type of luxury brand saw its sales swing up during the pandemic. Part of the explosion is due to the fact there’s a lot more upscale stuff to buy. Luxury was once confined to traditional categories such as clothing, accessories, wines, and cars. No longer. In the past few years, there’s also been an insatiable appetite for high-end kitchenware and other home goods — a $420 Le Creuset dutch oven, a $1,500 Breville espresso maker, a $1,500 Thermomix blender, a $110 Aesop candle smelling of vetiver, frankincense, and wealth.

Analysts have a nebulous definition of what constitutes a luxury good, but it’s usually an object that not only has a sky-high price but also promises quality craftsmanship and an air of exclusivity. It shouldn’t be something everyone has. Yet more and more Americans across ages and income brackets are getting swept up in the world of extravagant products, driving the industry to an incredible boom.

Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton — LVMH for short — this year became the most valuable luxury company in the world, surpassing a market cap of a half trillion dollars in April. The owner of brands such as Dior, Givenchy, and Tiffany, it now floats in the uppermost stratosphere of the world’s biggest companies, among names like Meta, Tesla, Berkshire Hathaway, and Amazon. This year, Bernard Arnault, the CEO of LVMH, even overtook tech emperor Elon Musk as the richest person on Earth with an estimated $232 billion at time of writing, according to Forbes’s real-time billionaire ranking.

It’s not just Louis Vuitton handbags that are selling like gold-garnished hotcakes. While the rate of growth in the sector has slowed slightly in recent months, a whopping 95 percent of luxury brands saw profits fatten in 2022, according to a Bain & Company report. Hermès, maker of decadent silk scarves and the infamous Birkin bag, saw a record 38 percent jump in profit from 2021. Richemont, which counts Cartier, Chloé, and Montblanc among its brands, saw its fiscal year 2022 profits rise by 61 percent. Kering (Gucci, Saint Laurent, Balenciaga), Chanel and Prada, Burberry, Luxottica, and OTB (which owns Maison Margiela, Marni, and other luxe brands) — they were all up, too.

Meanwhile, in the broader economy, other industries have been struggling to recover from the hit they took during the pandemic, while also battling persistent supply chain issues, labor shortages, and stock value plummets. “There are two key factors as to why luxury is bucking current trends,” says Neil Saunders, managing director of retail at the analytics and consulting firm GlobalData, which conducted a consumer panel of US luxury spending last year. “One of them is economic, and one of them is psychological.”

Economically, the math is simple: Rich people, the most obvious consumers for luxury goods, don’t balk at price tags. The luxury industry is often described as “resilient,” meaning it doesn’t get buffeted by economic headwinds quite as much as other industries do. “That, to be honest, has always been the case,” Saunders says.

The psychology of why we buy designer products also eschews typical economic sense, because the motivation to buy is about status. The higher the price, the more status you’re theoretically buying.

Which is why it’s not just rich people buying rich people things. A not-insignificant portion of luxury growth comes from middle- and low-income consumers. According to GlobalData, Americans with a household income of less than $50,000 make up about 27 percent of regular luxury consumers. That’s almost as big a group as luxury consumers with an income of $150,000 or more.

Even in rough times, the luxury industry usually enjoys a well-cushioned profit margin. That’s the nature of its business. The Business of Fashion reported that, in 2022, Louis Vuitton had an estimated margin above 50 percent. Compare that to Apple, the most valuable company in the world, which had a profit margin of around 30 percent last year.

“At a fast-fashion or a regular retailer, profit margins on clothing at best are 20 to 30 percent,” says Sherman. But the fat profits at LVMH and elsewhere have become more common as the industry became increasingly corporatized, she says. “Prior to 1990 especially, this was an industry run by individual families.”

In the 1980s, Arnault took the corporate raider playbook popular in the US at the time and applied it to French luxury — including by laying off 9,000 workers when he took over the conglomerate that owned the fashion house Dior. But instead of buying up companies and then quickly selling them off in pieces, Arnault kept his acquisitions, amassing a portfolio of 75 brands in fashion and other sectors. Other luxury conglomerates have followed in Arnault’s footsteps, gobbling up a diverse array of brands in several luxury categories. Buying up all these brands bolsters more consistent profits, because even when one category has a poor quarter, others could have a record-breaking one. It also ensures a certain level of market dominance; if someone wants to buy luxury, chances are they’re going to do it from a brand in the LVMH portfolio.

Luxury brands, however, aren’t immune to economic downturns. During the Great Recession, the market shrank by 9 percent. That’s what makes its leaps during the pandemic so remarkable. “It has held up a lot better in the current downturn than it did in the financial crash last time,” says Saunders.

Perhaps it’s because many brands have simply taken to increasing their prices to new heights. The average price of luxury items has spiked by 25 percent since 2019. Luxury accessories prices on the online retailer Farfetch rose by almost 39 percent between February 2020 and May 2021, according to the e-commerce analytics company DataWeave.

“Four hundred bucks for a pair of shoes used to seem like a lot of money,” says Sherman. “Every pair of shoes is a thousand bucks now.”

Shoppers of all income brackets also not only spent big on luxury items, they spent more on each purchase. Data from Earnest Analytics, a consumer data analytics firm, shows that the average sale amount has jumped — in April 2020 it cratered to $269, but reached $520 in April 2022. And while Americans across the income spectrum were buying more luxury apparel during the pandemic, purchases by individuals making $40,000 or less rose the most: They were 365 percent higher at the end of 2021 than they were in January 2020, before lockdowns began in the US.

Saunders suggests there are several reasons the luxury market is stronger this time around. For one, we’re not in a recession — at least not yet. The Covid economy was also a strange beast; it absolutely devastated some sectors for a while, and both its human and economic toll shouldn’t be understated. Recovery, however, has also happened quickly. The economy of luxury goods, Saunders notes, is far different now than it was in 2009. “We didn’t have the resale market,” he says. “Players like The RealReal, Poshmark, they just didn’t really exist in the way that they do now.” The explosion of luxury resale and rental platforms might not have directly fed the sales of luxury brands, but they engaged a new generation of consumers — it’s an easy entry point into the world of its aesthetics and sensibilities.

And then there’s this truth: A lot of the spending, Sherman says, has been thanks to stimulus checks giving middle-income Americans more discretionary income in a time when there were fewer avenues to spend it. Some of it was due to newly minted crypto wealth. For other shoppers, it wasn’t that they had new money to flaunt, but that the pandemic lockdowns had caused a sort of slingshot effect — as lockdowns eased, the floodgates of the pent-up shopping that people didn’t (or couldn’t) do opened. Amid a mix of drivers, the bottom line is that Americans couldn’t get enough of premium goods amid a destabilizing economic crisis.

“Luxury goods have become a big part of pop culture,” says Sherman. “Now it’s a social thing. When I was growing up, having an interest in fashion — especially in America — was seen as a hobby or a niche.”

The modern luxury economy has become a part of not just pop culture, but youth internet culture. People find out about trends online, and shop online, then sell old pieces online so they can buy a new statement item … online. According to The RealReal’s 2022 report, millennials sell and buy more than any other generational cohort — and together with Gen Z, they make up 41 percent of the site’s more than 28 million members.

Members of Gen Z, in fact, are making their first luxury purchases earlier than millennials did — at around age 15, according to Bain & Co research. The same research projects that millennials and younger generations will make up 80 percent of luxury spending by 2030.

This might seem like an odd projection, given the countless reports of young people’s finances lagging behind those of their parents. One Morgan Stanley report suggested that young adults may have more disposable income because a greater number of them are living with their parents longer due to skyrocketing rent. The accessibility of buy now, pay later platforms also makes it easier to finance a $5,000 handbag. Maybe a mortgage feels too out of reach to even dream of, but paying for an exorbitantly priced Nike x Supreme Air Jordan collab in installments? Doable.

Young people in particular justify luxury spending, says Saunders, with the booming resale market. “Younger generations view luxury, and indeed fashion in general, as being circular,” he says. Fork over an exorbitant amount upfront, then recoup some, if not most of it, on Depop later. The price value equation is alluring for luxury, counterintuitively especially when inflation is high — that’s when consumers with some disposable income are going to really maximize bang for their buck.

When it comes to status pieces, however, price and affordability are a little beside the point. A recent CreditKarma survey found that over half of Gen Z and millennials considered themselves to be emotional spenders — more than a third even said their emotional spending was “out of control.”

“Younger generations are much more attuned to using luxury as a way to feel good about themselves,” says Saunders. “Not just as a signal of wealth or status. It’s much more about them personally feeling good and wanting to have products that they feel engaged with.”

“There’s a lot more social media where people are showing off the brands, and they’re showcasing what they’ve bought,” he continues. Luxury goods are a language through which to communicate taste and connoisseurship on digital platforms, and brands know this. Their marketing today is geared to young people deeply attuned to internet culture, focusing on celebrity endorsement deals, collabs with artists and edgy designers, doing limited “drops” — not only with fashion, but even with kitchenware — that intensify how coveted a product is and ride the wave of virality. The penetration of streetwear and hypebeast culture globally has also been an incredible boon to the luxury industry, transforming the means of gesturing high status. Gen Z shoppers are more concerned with differentiating themselves from the mainstream, says David Dubois, a professor of marketing at INSEAD. In an age of mass-produced goods, nothing is more precious than a flash of the inimitable and bespoke.

The fact that luxury awareness and engagement has reached new heights comes with potential dangers for the industry. Luxury has become democratized and globalized. “As a result,” as Yajin Wang, a professor of marketing at the China Europe International Business School, writes in the International Journal of Research in Marketing, “the wealth signal has been diluted.”

Sherman thinks more luxury brands should be concerned about becoming too available. Like a master artisan, the luxury industry has to carefully thread the needle of growth and scarcity. Saunders recalls the mid-2010s, when a lot of luxury brands shoved out too much product. “They just devalued themselves,” he says. “If you look at a brand like Coach, for example, it was just ubiquitous in 2015. It was everywhere. They were selling stuff at a discount, they were doing flash sales.”

Since then, the industry has been more vigilant about becoming too commonplace. There are fewer discounts — some brands never do sales. Limited production runs are another tactic to bolster exclusivity. Videos of luxury brands destroying their excess inventory have gone viral on social media.

Dubois believes luxury will continue to sell incredibly well. “Inequality fuels consumption,” he explains. The pandemic has increased income and wealth inequality. But the luxury boom isn’t an aberration from this fact — it aligns with it. Studies have shown that higher income inequality heightens awareness and anxiety about class; one study analyzing Google Trends data found that Americans sought out luxury goods more during times of greater income inequality.

“The wealthy have gotten wealthier, and the poor have gotten poorer,” says Sherman. “And yet there’s a thing in our culture that prioritizes you buying a Nike shoe — buy the Jordans, buy the sneakers.” Even if it means saving up, or buying one pair to resell on eBay to finance the purchase of even more expensive shoes — “even if you’re not doing super well financially, it’s prioritized in this interesting way.”

Desire often creates a potent feeling of need, one that can be hard to reason away precisely because it isn’t rational. It’s infatuation, limerence.

What else can happen when luxury is pop culture?

“They’re in the business of selling dreams,” says Dubois. “You buy a piece of a dream.”"

European-listed luxury stocks slumped on Tuesday morning as worries grew of a US spending slowdown. The selloff wiped nearly $30 billion of market value from the sector, according to data from Bloomberg.

Louis Vuitton's parent company, LVMH, was down 3% shortly before 8 a.m. ET. Hermes dropped 4% and Gucci-owner Kering slipped 2%.

Investors in the luxury-goods industry are fretting more and more about about a potential slowdown in spending in the US.

""Slowing to negative growth year-on-year in the US is a building concern, especially given signs of softening demand from more economically sensitive aspirational consumers,"" Deutsche Bank analysts said in a research note published on Tuesday.

Many forecasters have projected that the US will suffer an economic slump or even a recession later this year, with GDP growth slowing to just 1.1% in the first quarter of 2023.

Deutsche Bank's base case is that the slowdown will hit Americans' wallets, resulting in them spending less on luxury goods.

Prior to Tuesday's selloff, luxury stocks had enjoyed a strong start to 2023, powered higher by expectations of a surge in sales thanks to China's recent economic reopening.

LVMH shares are still up 25% year-to-date despite their decline on Tuesday, with the fashion, champagne, and cognac conglomerate recently becoming the first European company to achieve a $500 billion valuation.

Hermes has jumped 34% in 2023, while Kering – which Deutsche Bank warned has been suffering from ""creative turnarounds"" like the exit of Alessandro Michele from Gucci – is up a more modest 12%.

""Succession,"" HBO's smash hit show about the trials and tribulations of a media conglomerate and its warring family members, is near its conclusion after four seasons and five years.

Waystar Royco is on the verge of a roughly $100 billion sale to a Swedish tech entrepreneur. Logan Roy, the family patriarch and the company's founder, is dead and the deal is mired in uncertainty. Just four episodes remain.

This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.

Comparisons are often drawn between the 13 Emmy-winning show and the Murdoch family. Like Rupert Murdoch's News Corp, Waystar Royco is a media conglomerate with a trio of adult children competing to be named heir.

Showrunner Jesse Armstrong says his fictional Roy family is inspired by several famous dynasties, such as the Hearsts — the family behind Hearst Communications — and the Redstones — the controlling influence behind Paramount Global.

But there are striking resemblances between the Roys and a non-media family currently in the spotlight. There's still plenty of rivalry between the progeny of Bernard Arnault, CEO of luxury goods behemoth LVMH and world's richest person.

Luca Solca, an analyst at investment firm Bernstein, told The Telegraph that Arnault had created a ""Darwinian contest"" among his kids, much like the battle within the Roy family.

As with the Roys, all five Arnault kids are embedded in LVMH. According to the Wall Street Journal, Arnault hosts a monthly 90-minute lunch with his five children, whose ages range from 24 to 48, to drill them on company strategy and ask them for advice.

Arnault started his career at his father's company. As the Los Angeles Times' fictional obituary notes, so did Logan Roy.

Arnault is reputationally as ruthless as Roy in his business dealings, earning him the nickname the ""wolf in cashmere.""

Take his 1984 takeover of Bussac, the company which then owned Dior. Arnault gained another sobriquet, ""the Terminator,"" after laying off 9,000 workers in two years and getting rid of every asset but the fashion house, the New York Times reported.

""Succession"" fans might recall Kendall passionately leading the purchase of news website Vaulter before being forced to fire its entire staff at his father's behest in season two.

Per the New York Times, Alexandre Arnault, 30, managed to similarly persuade Bernard to take an 80% stake in German luggage brand Rimowa in 2016 – though he more successfully remained CEO for four years. He's now an executive vice president of LVMH-owned Tiffany & Co.

It's the eldest Arnaults, Antoine and Delphine, who appear more likely to succeed their father.

45-year-old Antoine looked set to take the reins last December, when he was appointed CEO of Christian Dior SE, which controls the majority of LVMH, per Reuters.

Less than a month later, Bernard named his only daughter, Delphine, as CEO of Christian Dior Couture.

The LVMH empire is set up so that each of Bernard's five children have an equal stake in a holding company set up to end the tycoon's leadership.

It has a rotating two-year chairmanship among the children, who can't sell for 30 years without unanimous approval, per the Journal.

Last year, Arnault spoke to The Telegraph about growing up in the north of France and seeing the heirs of textile companies who ""rested on their laurels"" and squandered their fortunes.

""So with my kids it was really important that we gave them a strong work ethic from the start,"" he added.

But it's unclear when he'll step down, since LVMH raised the age limit of its CEO from 75 to 80, Bloomberg reported last year.

With his children in the front row at a results conference in January, Arnault responded to a succession question with a quip about France's controversial pension reform. ""You will have noticed that the retirement age is being raised,"" he said, per Reuters."
All LVMH Employees Will Get Environmental Training by 2026 - WWD,"Fri, 26 May 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3dkLmNvbS9zdXN0YWluYWJpbGl0eS9lbnZpcm9ubWVudC9sdm1oLXN1c3RhaW5hYmlsaXR5LXRyYWluaW5nLWVjby1hcnRodXMtYmlvZGl2ZXJzaXR5LTEyMzU2NjUxNTEv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Deer at the Vallée de la Millière reserve.

As a destination for staff training, it sounds idyllic: a 75-acre wetland area on the edge of the Rambouillet forest teeming with more than 350 plant and animal species, including foxes, badgers and deer.

Known as Vallée de la Millière and located about one hour from Paris, it was acquired by famed photographer Yann Arthus-Bertrand in 2020 and will soon become a place of learning and awareness about biodiversity for employees of LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton.

On Friday, the luxury giant unveiled a five-year partnership with the Vallée de la Millière association, which is renovating and readying the verdant site for employee training, and which will host visits from students, nongovernmental organizations and scientists starting next year.

LVMH aims to train all of its 200,000 employees in “environmental fundamentals” by 2026 at multiple sites, which include Vallée de la Millière and sustainable fashion hub La Caserne for its 37,500 employees based in France.

“Each employee can be an actor of change, and providing expert training is key,” Hélène Valade, LVMH’s environmental development director, told an audience at the Change Now environmental summit in Paris. “I think this amazing place will be will enable a reconnection with nature.”

Since April 2022, LVMH-owned beauty brand Guerlain has been a partner of Vallée de la Millière, renowned for its regenerative farming techniques and a garden built on the principles of agroforestry and permaculture.

Arthus-Bertrand, an advisory board member of LVMH since 2019, said the French group’s sponsorship will allow Vallée de la Millière to “carry out this unprecedented pilot re-wilding project, which could serve as an example and encourage others throughout France.”

Valade told the Change Now audience its training programs would be tailored around employee functions, so procurement specialists can evaluate suppliers of raw materials, so sales associates can respond to customer inquiries about a product’s eco credentials, and so logistics specialists can navigate the most eco-friendly modes of product transport.

“It’s absolutely crucial to engage and to align the entire company around a common environmental ambition,” she said, noting its objective to train all employees by 2026 has been enshrined in the group’s Life 360 roadmap.

In an interview, Valade described robust demand from employees for job-specific eco training, noting that its human resources department recently posted a range of new environmental training options, and most slots were filled within a day.

She noted some training sessions would be only a few hours, while some would be daylong immersions.

Valade was one of four panelists at a Change Now session dedicated to corporate transformation.

Pierre Louette, chairman and chief executive officer of Les Echos — Le Parisien, a French newspaper group controlled by LVMH and a co-organizer of the Change Now summit, told the audience that about 15 percent of articles it publishes today contain an environmental, social and governance angle, versus a tiny fraction even five years ago. To his delight, the number of subscribers are increasing.

“It hasn’t been detrimental to the business. People are interested,” he said.

But Louette insisted the newspapers practice what they preach, so Les Echos – Le Parisien has taken steps to reduce the company’s carbon footprint, hired a chief impact officer, and worked with its printing and delivery supply chains to reduce environmental impacts.

“Most of the staff involved have found out that it’s something that adds to your life,” he said.

Antoinette Klatzky, vice president of programs and partnerships at the Eileen Fisher Foundation, said ownership models determine engagement, with Patagonia among the most advanced. Last year, the family of founder Yvon Chouinard transferred ownership of the firm to two new entities set up to use its $100 million in annual profits to fight climate change.

The Eileen Fisher house introduced an employee stock option plan in 2007, which Klatzky described as transformative. “The employees care differently; they’re invested,” she said.

In a rousing speech to introduce the session, Kate Williams, CEO of 1% for the Planet, urged companies to “let go of what we thought of as a competitor” and encourage them to join the cause. She mentioned tea firm Pukka introduced rival Tazo to 1% for the Planet, a global nonprofit that conscripts businesses to give 1 percent of annual sales to environmental nonprofits.

“Small actions add up to large change,” she said. “And it isn’t just a marketing story. This is how we create a new economy.”"
Richemont Vehemently Denies Reports of a LVMH Takeover - HYPEBEAST,"Tue, 16 May 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQmh0dHBzOi8vaHlwZWJlYXN0LmNvbS8yMDIzLzUvcmljaGVtb250LWRlbmllcy1sdm1oLXRha2VvdmVyLXJlcG9ydNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Back in February, LVMH, the world’s leading luxury group, was rumored to consider a takeover of the Swiss luxury goods holding company Richemont. However, with the current success Richemont is facing, it seems that the rumors are not true.

In the latest earnings report, Richemont reported strong sales across China following the end of the Covid Zero policy. In the first quarter of the year, Richemont saw an operating profit of $5.5 billion USD, with sales rising 14%. The stock also rose as much as 5.9% in Geneva. The company’s chairman Johann Rupert noted the economic volatility and political uncertainty, but is confident that Richemont will be able to march forward steadily.

Richemont discusses its brands’ strong positioning around the world, reporting that similar to their competitors, its brands have also reported better-than-expected estimates. According to Business of Fashion, an analyst at Vontobel, Jean-Philippe Bertschy, noted, “Brands with strong pricing power are likely to emerge as the winners in the coming months. Richemont is very well positioned with Cartier, Van Cleef & Arpels or Vacheron Constantin. The company has everything in place for further market share gains.” In regards to the rumors of an LVMH takeover, Rupert shot down the idea of merging with their rival. He did mention of LVMH, “We’re in constant dialogue and we respect each other’s independence.”

Two years ago, when investment bankers suggested a deal with Kering, Richemont’s Rupert declined stating, “Why would we want to? We know what we have.” The company has plans to buy back as many as 10 million A shares that represent the 1.7% capital of the company.

125 Votes Separate LVMH From Building Cheval Blanc Hotel in Beverly Hills – Commercial Observer - Commercial Observer,"Fri, 26 May 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vY29tbWVyY2lhbG9ic2VydmVyLmNvbS8yMDIzLzA1L2xhLWx2bWgtdm90ZS1jaGV2YWwtYmxhbmMtaG90ZWwtYmV2ZXJseS1oaWxscy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"A slim margin of votes separates French billionaire Bernard Arnault from building an ultra-high-end hotel that would allow the rich and famous to be as close as possible to the luxury items they love along Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills, Calif.

After a special election earlier this week, updated results released Friday afternoon show a 125-vote difference against conglomerate Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton (LVMH) from building a 109-room Cheval Blanc-branded hotel, according to Los Angeles County officials.

Voters were asked two questions: if Beverly Hills should approve a zoning amendment to allow the hotel to be built taller and double the size that is currently allowed at the site, and if they approve of the development and tax agreement. Both need to pass for the building to move forward. With about 7,005 votes counted, 123 separates the former question, and 125 separate the latter.

Another vote update is scheduled for May 30, and results will be certified on June 2.

Opponents of the ballot measures include a community group and a hotel union fighting against overdevelopment and for an inclusion of affordable housing payments, according to the L.A. Times. But supporters don’t want to miss out on the huge tax revenue that the hotel would provide.

If the project is approved, LVMH would contribute $28 million to the city. Beverly Hills would also receive an additional 5 percent surcharge over its regular 14 percent transient occupancy tax, and the hotel is expected to generate about $725 million over the next 30 years. LVMH is also reimbursing the city for the cost of the special election

The City Council approved the project last year. But Unite Here Local 11, which represents hospitality workers across the region, collected the signatures to force a citywide vote.

LVMH plans to build the hotel up to nine stories, with a members-only club, restaurants, retail and a spa at the northernmost of those three blocks of Rodeo Drive. Designed by Peter Marino, it would be the small city’s 17th hotel, and the first North American property for the Cheval Blanc chain.

LVMH is deeply invested in Beverly Hills’ Golden Triangle district, with 15 properties in the immediate area.

LVMH Unveils Asia's Largest R&D Center In Shanghai As China Skincare Enters New Stage - Jing Daily,"Mon, 08 May 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vamluZ2RhaWx5LmNvbS9wb3N0cy9sdm1oLXVudmVpbHMtYXNpYXMtbGFyZ2VzdC1yZC1jZW50ZXItaW4tc2hhbmdoYWktY2hpbmEtc2tpbmNhcmUtMi0wLXN0YWdl0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"What happened

: Following French conglomerate LVMH’s overhaul of its beauty division and the appointment of the former L’Oréal China CEO Stéphane Rinderknech as chairman and CEO of its perfumes and cosmetics department in March, the group has unveiled its first big move in China: its Perfumes and Cosmetics Asia R&D Center in Shanghai, which opened last month.

Covering an area of more than 22,000㎡, it’s the group’s largest R&D center in Asia. Located on the outskirts of Shanghai, the site will be equipped with skincare, makeup, and color development laboratories, as well as product testing rooms, and workshop space.

With the mission to “take root in Asia and China and create the beauty of the world,” the hub will enable the group to gain insights into local beauty shoppers.

Chen Jing , R&D Director at LVMH Beauty Asia Pacific, revealed to local beauty outlet CBO Focus that the center will study Chinese consumers’ skin characteristics using the latest cutting-edge technology such as AI, and integrate multidisciplinary knowledge to develop skincare and beauty products that meet local shoppers’ needs. Additionally, it will work closely with the business’ French R&D center to localize new concepts.

The Jing Take

: In 2019, China’s skincare market reached $35 billion (244 billion RMB), which was 4.43 times larger than the makeup market. According to Mintel , the skincare industry in China is expected to exceed $60 billion (415 billion RMB) by 2050. That said, skincare is a critical component for brands to take a share of China’s lucrative beauty market.

Although LVMH has over 70 brands in its portfolio, the behemoth’s beauty division has plenty of room for growth. Late last year, the group’s Cha Ling brand closed its last store in China, meaning that LVMH currently only operates two major high-end skincare brands in the country — Fresh and Guerlain — while LVMH-owned Fenty’s market share is relatively limited in the country.

With Chinese consumers becoming increasingly knowledgeable about skincare products and their ingredients — many describing themselves as ‘skintellectuals’ 成份党 — beauty giants are feeling the urge to double down on their commitment to R&D to ensure they stay relevant with this consumer segment.

In 2021, Japanese conglomerate Shiseido launched its China Innovation Center in Shanghai’s Fengxian District to research and develop cutting-edge skincare technologies. Meanwhile, consumer products giant P&G has pledged to invest $100 million (700 million RMB) over the next three years in its China Digital Innovation Centre in Guangzhou, inaugurated in 2021. In 2022, Estée Lauder unveiled its new China Innovation Labs to develop skincare and beauty products.

Locating large R&D centers in China has emerged as a common practice for beauty groups. These hubs enable brands to better meet the differentiated needs of China’s shoppers. They also help embed businesses in China’s mature supply chain system and provide access to the country’s R&D talent pool.

This wave of R&D centers is propelling China’s skincare development to a new stage of development. The battle for talent, resources, and market share is about to heat up.

"LVMH's Tannery Deal, Valentino's New Face - Nuti Ivo - WWD","Wed, 31 May 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3dkLmNvbS9mYXNoaW9uLW5ld3MvZmFzaGlvbi1zY29vcHMvbHZtaHMtdGFubmVyeS1kZWFsLXZhbGVudGlub3MtbmV3LWZhY2UteWFuZy15YW5nLTEyMzU2NjgzNDkv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"TANNERY DEAL: LVMH Métiers d’Art, the French luxury group’s specialist crafts division, has acquired a majority stake in Italian tannery Nuti Ivo SpA.

“With the addition of Nuti Ivo Group, we complete our operations in the leather business, expanding our savoir-faire and product offering while ensuring traceable and sustainable sourcing,” Matteo de Rosa, chief executive officer of LVMH Métiers d’Art, said in a statement Monday announcing the operation.

Ivo Nuti established the tannery in 1955 in Santa Croce sull’Arno, a historic leather-working and tanning area in Italy’s Tuscany region, in 1955. Today, the company is managed by Fabrizio and Andrea Nuti, second-generation members of the founding family, and counts more than 300 employees throughout Italy.

According to Italian media reports, Nuti Ivo SpA’s revenue stood at 160 million euros for 2022.

The tannery company stated it exports 85 percent of its production abroad and has introduced technical and procedural innovations to the field of leather processing, investing in sustainability and reduction of waste and energy consumption. It has also developed partnerships in Paraguay, Morocco and China for materials destined to the footwear market or after-sales services.

For Fabrizio Nuti, president and CEO of the Italian company, the move was recognition of “more than 40 years of collaborations with the best brands in the world” as well as “a new beginning, a new departure, which serves as an incentive for us to grow and improve in all areas of our savoir-faire, guaranteeing a future for our history and our company.”

Jean-Baptiste Voisin, LVMH chief strategy officer and president of LVMH Métiers d’Art, said such an acquisition fit into its goal of “ensuring a future, by providing new opportunities to local artisan excellences which, alone, in the new scenarios of the luxury industry, may struggle to maintain an international projection.”

The Nuti Ivo acquisition reinforces the group’s presence in the leather, exotic skins and metal sectors, where it counts partners in breeding, tanning, finishing and leather ready-to-wear production across France, Italy and Spain for calfskin and lambskin, and in Africa, Australia and the U.S. for exotic skins. It also owns the noted Heng Long tannery in Singapore and Italy, specialized the tanning and finishing of crocodilian skins.

In April, LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton reported an 18 percent jump in first-quarter revenue for its fashion and leather goods business, headlined by its star mega-brands Louis Vuitton and Christian Dior, and a 17 percent increase overall.

Leather goods, alongside hard luxury and apparel, have been leading the post-pandemic resurgence of the luxury industry, according to Federica Levato, partner at Bain & Co., leader of its EMEA Luxury Goods and Fashion practice, and coauthor of a Bain & Company Luxury Study in collaboration with Fondazione Altagamma released in November 2022. — LILY TEMPLETON AND MARTINO CARRERA

“My dialogue with Yang is cultural, generational, multidisciplinary: a complete experience of diversity and mutual appreciation. His talent relates concretely to human emotions, and I value this a great deal,” he added.

Considered one of the most successful actors of his generation, Yang shot to fame in 2010 for playing the lead role of Jia Baoyu in the TV adaptation of “The Dream of Red Mansions,” one of China’s most sought-after novels in history.

Since then he has starred in a long list of hit TV series and become a favorite among luxury brands in China. Prior to Valentino, Yang has been the face of L’Oréal, CeraVe, Dunhill, Bulgari, Chandon and Coca-Cola.

LONDON LANDING: Jeanne Damas has landed in London’s Mayfair with a store for her fashion and beauty brand, Rouje.

“It’s funny because a few years ago when I wasn’t looking for boutiques or anything, I was walking in London, and I walked on these streets, which I thought were beautiful for shopping,” said Damas, who came across South Molton Street again when she was searching for a place for her store.

She plans to open boutiques in key countries, including Spain, Germany and the U.S., which is one of her biggest markets, along with her home country of France.

As an extension of the brand, Damas launched Rouje Beauté line in 2018, which firstly consisted of makeup, but now is now venturing into skin care via a collaboration with clean beauty retailer Oh My Cream.

“It was really important for me to be [stocked] there because in France it’s the concept store of clean beauty,” she added.

Oh My Cream launched in London last winter on the King’s Road.

“I have always loved coming to London, especially for shopping, but it seems to me that a new generation of beauty destinations is still missing,” Lévy told WWD at the time, adding that her brand’s holistic approach and stocking of exclusively clean beauty brands fills the gap in the capital city’s market. Her ambition is to “become the next favorite beauty destination for English women.”

In the fashion realm, Damas has teamed up with ‘90s French designer Lamine Badian Kouyaté, founder of Xuly Bët, who Damas thinks will be a shock to many people. She said it felt right because they both share similar values, despite the contrast in aesthetic.

She’s even taken the task of shooting the images for the collaboration with Kouyaté — something she’s never tried before. — HIKMAT MOHAMMED

NEW KID ON THE BLOCK: Legends, a Los Angeles-based men’s essentials brand founded by a group of athletes and celebrities in 2019, is launching its first kids’ collection.

The direct-to-consumer brand that counts the rapper Quavo, NBA players Matt Barnes, Larry Nance Jr., Marcus and Markieff Morris, and NFL player Baker Mayfield and former NBA star and coach Steve Nash among its investors, was created by former All-American lacrosse player Scott Hochstadt as an alternative to the existing offerings in performance activewear.

The kids’ collection, called Lil’ Legends, was created in partnership with Nash. It launches Wednesday and consists of shorts, T-shirts and swim trunks in colors and silhouettes that match those in the men’s collection. The line is available in youth sizes XS-L as well as adult sizes S-XXL.

Nash is passionate about inspiring youth through sports and passing his love of athletics to the next generation. In launching the kids’ collection, Nash passed along some words of inspiration to both kids and adults: “No lesson that you write or tell them is going to be as important as the way they’ve watched you behave for the entirety of their life,” he said. “Your kids are watching and learning and that’s an important component of parenting — that you represent the values that you want to represent especially when it’s not easy. If you want to improve you have to go through difficult times. As a parent that has afforded me a lot, I don’t want to protect my kids from all their falls. We all make mistakes, we’re all human, use these things as a teaching moment.”

The collection will retail from $40 to $65 and will be sold on the Legends website. — JEAN E. PALMIERI"

LVMH Cheval Blanc Hotel in Beverly Hills Hits a Stumbling Block - WWD,"Thu, 04 May 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigAFodHRwczovL3d3ZC5jb20vYnVzaW5lc3MtbmV3cy9yZWFsLWVzdGF0ZS9sdm1oLWNoZXZhbC1ibGFuYy1ob3RlbC1yb2Rlby1kcml2ZS1vcHBvc2l0aW9uLWJldmVybHktaGlsbHMtYW5pc2gtbWVsd2FuaS0xMjM1NjQwNzU0L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton has spent nearly three years cobbling together architectural plans, studies and analyses to make sure its first Cheval Blanc hotel in the U.S. would be the right fit for Beverly Hills. And it was successful. Late last year, the Beverly Hills City Council voted 4-1 to green-light the project sitting at the north end of the Rodeo Drive shopping area.

But some people were unhappy a 109-room hotel, framed by Rodeo Drive, Little Santa Monica Boulevard and Beverly Drive, would rise nine stories on one side and tower over surrounding retail and commercial spaces sitting at three and four stories high. Four buildings would have to be razed, and the idea of more traffic coming to the area was unsettling.

Early this year, development opponents gathered enough signatures to prompt a May 23 special election for the city’s 22,000 registered voters to decide on two issues that could make or break the project. The signature gathering movement was spearheaded by Unite Here Local 11, a union representing hotel workers and other industry employees, and joined by discontented residents.

Referendum B challenges the zoning change allowing the hotel to be nine stories on the Beverly side while the Rodeo Drive side will be confined to four stories. Referendum C takes issue with the development agreement that doesn’t allow the city to change the development rules once the project is approved. A “no” vote on either referendum would stop the hotel, in its current form, from going forward.

LVMH would have to return to the drawing board and submit a new proposal. Anish Melwani, chairman and chief executive officer of LVMH North America, noted this will not happen. “This will be our one and only attempt to bring Cheval Blanc to Beverly Hills,” he wrote in an email. “If this effort is not successful, the space will probably be used for retail.”

He said LVMH has spent years going through a rigorous review process and environmental study that included public meetings where residents were able to express their thoughts and city officials vetted the project replacing four buildings — two on Rodeo Drive and two on Beverly Drive. One of those buildings, the former Brooks Brothers store at 468 N. Rodeo Drive encompassing 22,250 square feet, was acquired by LVMH in 2018 for $245 million.

The Cheval Blanc hotel, designed by New York architect Peter Marino, will have ground-floor retail on Rodeo Drive, restaurants, meeting rooms, a spa and a private club for 500 members. “Not only will this hotel set a new standard of luxury, but it will also serve as a powerful economic engine that will help keep Beverly Hills an exceptional place to live,” Melwani explained. “It is important to note that Cheval Blanc will be a very modestly sized hotel. It will have just 109 rooms, making it the smallest luxury hotel in the Golden Triangle, with no conferences, events or group business.”

He pointed out that more than one year ago, LVMH acquired the Luxe Hotel on North Rodeo Drive, a decades-old five-story boutique hotel hit hard by the pandemic, forcing the Harkham family to sell it for $200 million. LVMH has closed the hotel and has other plans for the property, although Melwani would not divulge those plans. “The total increase in hotel rooms in the area after Cheval Blanc opens will be very limited — a net increase of just 21 rooms in the city,” he wrote.

Beverly Hills is a world-famous city of 32,000 residents that still maintains a quaint, small town feel despite the luxury stores that populate Rodeo Drive and the multimillion-dollar residential estates that attract tourists to drive up and down the tree-lined streets searching for movie stars’ homes.

The pedestrian-friendly, three-block area starts with Two Rodeo Drive, a faux European-style curved street with several clothing and jewelry boutiques, and then stretches north past luxury brands that are building bigger boutiques, including the new 30,000-square-foot Chanel store, Fendi, Dior, Louis Vuitton, Burberry, Tom Ford, Loewe, Giorgio Armani, Gucci, Loro Piana, Prada, Ralph Lauren, Saint Laurent and Versace. Several of them are owned by LVMH, whose revenues last year totaled $87 billion.

However, Cheval Blanc opponents want to keep that small town vibe. “The area is charming and beautiful right now, and, if and when they are able to put that project out there, it will not be. It is very nice to be around low-rise buildings. You can sit at a sidewalk café in Beverly Hills and look across the street and see the hills. It is a very good feeling,” said Darian Bojeaux, an attorney who has lived in the city for 35 years and signed the petitions launching a special election. “Let them build a code-compliant hotel that is three stories high. Let them build something nice that doesn’t ruin the city.”

John Mirisch, the only city council member voting against the project, agreed. He believes the hotel is too tall on one side and the city should be getting more revenue from the project. “I would like to see a scaled-back project with a fair development agreement. They are projecting that the average room price will be $2,000 a night. The city should be asking an additional 5 percent [bed tax], and we should use those funds to finance affordable housing for our less fortunate.”

Affordable housing is the issue Unite Here Local 11 said it feels was not addressed when the development was approved and why it currently opposes the project. “We watch municipalities change development rules to make it easier to build luxury commercial projects like hotels, but they do not always do this for housing,” said Danielle Wilson, a research analyst with Unite Here Local 11. “We believe the development agreement between the city and the developer for the project is weak and does not provide sufficient community benefits, including by failing to earmark any of the funds for affordable housing.”

Some contend the union is just trying to pressure Cheval Blanc to let its hotel workers unionize. Wilson denied that, and Melwani maintained it is up to the hotel workers to decide to unionize or not. Three of Beverly Hills’ 16 hotels (the Beverly Wilshire Hotel, the Waldorf Astoria Beverly Hills and the Beverly Hilton) are unionized, the city said.

Cheval Blanc proponents believe this hotel is a win/win situation for Beverly Hills. It provides an additional revenue source and a badly needed anchor at the north end of the street.

“This is honestly, truly a no-brainer,” said Kathy Gohari, the boutique director at Audemars Piguet and the president of the Rodeo Drive Committee. “For decades, Rodeo Drive has had an amazing anchor with the Beverly Wilshire Hotel on the south. But one of our most important blocks [on the north] on Rodeo Drive has never flourished. What better partner than Cheval Blanc to do that?”

Merchants believe a new hotel and its tax revenue will help keep the area safe with more funding for the Beverly Hills Police Department, whose average response time to most crimes is only three minutes. During the pandemic and after, there was a rash of jewelry store smash-and-grabs on Rodeo Drive as well as attempted store robberies.

Now there is enhanced security with more street cameras, drones, private security and police patrols. Last December, the police department added a new drone called “Hawkeye,” whose high-resolution camera can read license plates a half-mile away. Rodeo Drive store owners emphasize this all takes money.

Lili Bosse, Beverly Hills’ mayor when the project was approved last November and a current city council member, believes this multimillion-dollar development, whose total cost has not been revealed, is just what Rodeo Drive needs to burnish its image and guarantee future revenue. The hotel should generate some $778 million in unrestricted funding over the next 30 years, $26 million in non-earmarked funds and $2 million to support local art and culture.

Bosse said the city council can use part of that unrestricted funding for affordable housing. “I feel that this project really is going to take our city into the next 100 years,” said the city council member, who has lived in the city for 50 years since she was a child. “I think this project will be world-renowned. I think it is a gift to our community and future generations.”

Many feel honored that Beverly Hills was chosen to be Cheval Blanc’s first U.S. location. LVMH launched its ultra-high-end hotel chain in 2006 when it opened its first resort in the French ski resort of Courchevel. It has other locations in Paris and Saint-Tropez, France; St. Barths in the French West Indies, and Randheli in the Maldives.

This is not the first time that Beverly Hills voters have decided the fate of a luxury hotel. In 2005, many residents opposed the five-star Montage Hotel (now called The Maybourne Beverly Hills) because of its dense size some believed would gridlock traffic and not fit in with the village feel. The 214-room hotel rising eight stories spent years getting its project off the ground. In the end, it won the election. More than 4,000 voters gave a thumbs-up for the hotel while 3,400 residents nixed it.

“We have great confidence that the people of Beverly Hills will show their support for their city’s decision-making process and vote to reaffirm Cheval Blanc,” Melwani wrote in his email. “They will also send a message that Beverly Hills welcomes the kind of investment that will maintain and strengthen its position in the global pantheon of luxury.”"
World's richest person Bernard Arnault's wealth drops $11B in a day - Business Insider,"Tue, 23 May 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vcmljaGVzdC1iaWxsaW9uYWlyZS1iZXJuYXJkLWFybmF1bHQtbHZtaC13ZWFsdGgtbmV0LXdvcnRoLWVsb24tbXVzay0yMDIzLTXSAW5odHRwczovL3d3dy5idXNpbmVzc2luc2lkZXIuY29tL3JpY2hlc3QtYmlsbGlvbmFpcmUtYmVybmFyZC1hcm5hdWx0LWx2bWgtd2VhbHRoLW5ldC13b3J0aC1lbG9uLW11c2stMjAyMy01P2FtcA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Bernard Arnault, the founder, chairman, and CEO of LVMH saw $11 billion wiped off his fortune on Tuesday.

Bernard Arnault, the world's richest person, saw $11.2 billion wiped off his fortune on Tuesday, narrowing his lead over Elon Musk, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.

The retail tycoon — now worth $192 billion — has a $12 billion lead over Musk's $180 billion fortune, narrowing from $21 billion on Monday, per Bloomberg.

Arnault's net worth was hit by a market rout in the luxury sector over fears that US spending would be slowing amid economic uncertainties.

The uncertainty sent the shares of LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, or LVMH — where Arnault is the chairman, and CEO — tumbling 5% lower to 834.2 euros, or $900, on Tuesday.

The Frenchman derives his wealth from a 97.5% stake in the luxury fashion brand Christian Dior holding company that controls 41.4% of LVMH.

Even after the one-day rout, Arnault's is still up by nearly $30 billion this year so far, per Bloomberg.

He has seen his wealth soar this year as LVMH's share prices surged on expectations that China's economic reopening after nearly three years of strict COVID-19 restrictions will lead to a robust demand for luxury goods.

In April, LVMH became the first European company ever to cross $500 billion in market valuation.

Arnault also became the third person ever— after Tesla CEO Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon — to top $200 billion in net worth in the same month.

LVMH shares are about 23% higher so far this year.

Shares in LVMH declined on Wednesday after the owner of the luxury goods company – whose offerings include Louis Vuitton handbags, Moet & Chandon Champagne and Christian Dior gown – had $11.2bn (£9.05bn) wiped from his fortune in one day over concerns that a softening US economy will dampen demand.

Bernard Arnault, the world’s richest person, had seen his wealth surge for most of 2023 as share prices of European luxury companies surged. However, on Tuesday, LVMH stock fell 5% in Paris – the most in more than a year – and shares were down nearly 2% on Wednesday.

However, even with traders selling shares in the group, the French billionaire still has a net worth of $191.6bn, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.

Moreover, LVMH’s share price is still up 23% for the year, despite its stock declining this week.

Energy company SSE was one of the top risers on the FTSE 100 index on Wednesday after it reported a near-doubling of its annual profits compared with the year before as a result of soaring energy prices.

The Scotland-based group said its adjusted pre-tax profits rose to £2.18bn for the 12 months to the end of March, up from almost £1.16bn the year before.

SSE also announced plans to invest up to £40bn in low-carbon energy infrastructure.

“SSE knows the drill – an energy company reporting bumper profit is likely to draw fire right now as UK households continue to struggle with the cost of heating and lighting their homes,” Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, said.

That’s why, Mould pointed out, the company is so keen to emphasise plans for tens of billions of pounds worth of investment in green energy projects and to point out it has put aside a not insignificant sum to satisfy existing windfall taxes.

“SSE’s spending commitment is undoubtedly eye-catching and is good news for a government which has often attracted criticism for not doing enough to promote investment in areas like wind and solar compared with the EU and US.

“Profit with a purpose is a good soundbite, but shareholders will want to see evidence that they are being rewarded for funding the company too,” Mould added.

Shares in retailer M&S jumped nearly 12% on Wednesday as investors seemed encouraged by the company’s full year 2023 results.

M&S said its sales rose by 10% although inflationary pressures and the absence of UK business rates relief saw lower margins, with adjusted operating profit down 12%. Clothing and home sales grew 11%, however, and food also grew, by 9%.

Charlie Huggins, manager of the quality shares portfolio at Wealth Club, said the group has made a good start to the new financial year as it plans to also reinstate a modest dividend.

“In a difficult trading environment M&S has delivered solid results, with notable progress in clothing and home. With the new year having got off to a good start and plans to reinstate dividends, the turnaround plan to revitalise the brand and reignite growth appears on track.

“The clothing and home division has been a problem child for M&S for many years. The new strategy, launched last year, aims to improve brand perception and designs, reduce discounting and improve the online offering, while taking a knife to costs and instilling a more entrepreneurial culture. Early signs are this plan is resonating with consumers with M&S increasing its market share in clothing and footwear during the year,” Huggins added.

He also noted that it was too early for M&S to declare victory, however.

“M&S shareholders are all too aware that one swallow doesn't make a summer. M&S needs to sustain growth in sales and get margins moving in the right direction. This will be difficult given a backdrop of intense cost pressures. Nevertheless, there are more reasons for optimism now than there have been for some time.""

Kingfisher Plc (KGF.L)

Shares fell around 2% in Kingfishers Plc in morning trade after the group reported first quarter sales of £3.3bn, an increase of 8%, but down 2% on a constant currency basis.

The home improvement retailer also reiterated its full-year guidance on Wednesday and said it is on track with plans to reduce inventory levels this year.

“The owner of B&Q has suffered from cold and rainy weather conditions in the UK and France, negatively impacting sales of items like garden furniture and barbecues, which are typically purchased in the preparation months ahead of summer. However, CEO Thierry Garnier said it anticipates ‘a release of pent-up demand’ as weather conditions pick up,” Victoria Scholar, head of investment at Interactive Investor, said.

She also noted how Kingfisher successfully rode the stay-at-home wave during the pandemic, enjoying a surge in demand for DIY products as consumers felt particularly house proud when they were stuck at home during lockdowns.

“However the post-covid economic reopening has seen consumers substitute away from spending on home improvements towards travel, restaurants and other activities that were largely off limits in 2020 and 2021,” Scholar added.

On top of that, the analyst also highlighted, the macroeconomic pressures from rising costs, squeezed household budgets, and falling real wages have added to the consumer strain resulting in less spending in Kingfisher’s stores like Screwfix and Castorama in the UK and France respectively.

Nvidia (NVDA)

Traders will also be keeping across Nvidia stock ahead of its earnings release later.

The US technology company, known for driving advances in AI, HPC, gaming, creative design, autonomous vehicles, chipmaking, and robotics, has seen its shares rally more than 100% in 2023.

The company's stock has been leading the pack among well-known chip-makers: AMD (AMD) shares are up 63% on the year, Intel (INTC) has advanced 14%, and Qualcomm (QCOM) shares have actually lost 3.6%. The stock has also outperformed Apple's (AAPL) 35% appreciation.

Analysts are expecting the company to say revenue and net income shrank by as much as a fifth last quarter, which would put its stock rally to the test.

""Nvidia is trading on heroic valuations which time will tell if they are justified,"" Deutsche Bank strategist Jim Reid said in a client note on Monday.

Stay in the know with our weekly roundup of headlines, launches, events, recommended reading and more.

According to a new study, more than a quarter of American homeowners are “house poor”—meaning they spend more than 30 percent of their income on housing costs. As The New York Times reports, a product research company for real estate agents and entrepreneurs called ​​Chamber of Commerce conducted an analysis of U.S. Census Bureau housing data, finding that 27.4 percent of all homeowners are “cost-burdened,” with Miami, Los Angeles and New York counting the highest number of “house poor” residents. While the percentage of U.S. homeowners who fall under this category declined from 2015 to 2019—falling from 29.4 percent to 26.6 percent—a combination of rising mortgage interest rates, inflation and stagnated earnings have since driven up housing costs, placing more pressure on renters and homeowners alike.

French luxury conglomerate LVMH is rolling out a new sustainability staff training program, Women’s Wear Daily reports, with plans to instruct all of its 200,000-person workforce in “environmental fundamentals” by 2026. The initiative has kicked off with the unveiling of a five-year partnership between LVMH and the Vallée de la Millière conservation center, which will host the training. According to LVMH environmental development director Hélène Valade, the new program’s curriculum will be tailored to specific employee functions—for example, allowing procurement specialists to evaluate sustainable suppliers of raw materials, priming sales associates on how to respond to customer inquiries about a product’s environmental footprint, and informing logistics providers on how to determine eco-friendly modes of transportation.

New York is sinking under the weight of its buildings, Dezeen reports, contributing to receding shorelines and ultimately increasing the city’s flood risk. A new study from the U.S. Geological Survey and the University of Rhode Island found that the city’s mass of buildings is causing it to descend at an average rate of 1 to 2 millimeters per year currently—depending on underlying types of soil and building foundations, the city could sink as much as 600 millimeters, or nearly two feet, in future years. The study’s authors warned that the weight of high-rise buildings heightens existing flood risk factors like rising sea levels and increasing storm intensity, and that such issues could apply to all coastal cities with similarly dense development.

Target recalled 4.9 million candles in glass jars after more than a hundred customers filed reports of the items cracking or breaking, causing burns and lacerations, The Wall Street Journal reports. According to a notice from the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission, the recall applies to candles within the retailer’s Threshold home-products line, which includes candles of varying scents and sizes that can now be returned to any Target store or by mail for a full refund.

Target also made headlines last week after removing Pride Month merchandise from some stores in response to conservative backlash, The New York Times reports. The retailer’s collection of seasonal items included rainbow-striped apparel, books and home items—such as pillows, throw rugs and tableware—which angered some customers, leading to in-store altercations. In response, Target removed some items from its shelves and moved other displays to the back of certain store locations, citing the need to protect the safety of its workers. In response, equal rights advocates claim that the move has alienated the store’s LGBTQ customers.

Warehousing rents could rise as much as 10 percent this year, Furniture Today reports. Due to a drop in construction starts fueled by increased costs and a lack of financing, rents already rose 4.4 percent in the first quarter and are expected to continue increasing throughout the year. According to a new forecast from logistics developer Prologis, the rising rates also stem from an ongoing lack of supply—vacancy rates hit a historic low of 3.2 percent last year and are expected to remain in the slightly elevated 4 percent range in the coming year.

Global investment firm Regent acquired direct-to-consumer fashion, decor, toy and gift brand Zulily from Qurate Retail Inc., Home Textiles Today reports. The terms of the deal were not disclosed. Along with its most recent purchase of the 23-year-old Zulily, Regent has acquired more than 30 businesses across the retail, media and technology sectors since 2015, including brands like Club Monaco, DIM Paris and Escada. Qurate Retail president and CEO David Rawlinson told HTT that the sale will allow the company to focus on its video assets—which include QVC and HSN—while preserving its liquidity.

Airbnb tapped Nate Berkus and Jeremiah Brent to become hosts on the platform this summer, offering guests the opportunity to stay at the couple’s beach home in Montauk, New York. The pair designed the 1970s-era home with casual luxury in mind, and it sits within reach of nearby beaches, a nature preserve and a variety of canal-side shops. Available for a one-night stay for two guests on June 10, bookings will open at 1 p.m. EST on May 31.

West Elm teamed up with women-owned fashion and lifestyle brand Rhode for the launch of a joint collection of decorative home accessories, tabletop items and colorful textiles. Founded in 2014 by former college roommates Purna Khatau and Phoebe Vickers, Rhode’s aesthetic strikes a balance between the pair’s far-flung travels and eye for everyday beauty with bold colors and time-honored silhouettes. The collaboration is Rhode’s first foray into the home category, with its signature prints applied to pillows, bedding and dinnerware.

Houston designer Katie Davis partnered with Massachusetts-based vintage rug company New England Loom to debut an assortment of 30 vintage Persian carpets. The collection features soft antique-washed colors, distressed textures and intricate motifs—plus, in a nod to Davis’s home state, each piece takes on a Texas-inspired name, like Rodeo, Alamo and Marfa.

In 2017, Swedish artist Margareta Magnusson wrote a how-to guide for “döstädning”—the practice of getting rid of material possessions at the end of your life. The process sounds grim, but for Magnusson and a fast-growing group of disciples around the world, the focus instead falls on auditing home items well in advance of mortality and keeping only the most meaningful and functional. As Chavie Lieber writes for The Wall Street Journal, the recent debut of a Peacock show drawn from the book, called The Gentle Art of Swedish Death Cleaning, has inspired homeowners to revisit their material possessions with a new perspective.

While bachelorette parties used to center around wild nights out and party-store decorations, a new trend has emerged, Yelena Alpert writes for House Beautiful, with the groups now seeking spaces decked out with high-end furnishings and photo-op-worthy vignettes like Nashville’s Dolly House or The Pink Palm Tree in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. For real estate investors and Airbnb hosts, the new niche is lucrative, too: Rather than one family paying a rental fee for all involved, groups of women split the cost and spend individually, allowing hosts to charge premium prices and pour the excess profit into over-the-top interiors.

LVMH Will Scrap Plans for Its Lavish Beverly Hills Hotel if the City Votes Against It - Robb Report,"Tue, 30 May 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vcm9iYnJlcG9ydC5jb20vdHJhdmVsL2hvdGVscy9sdm1oLXdpbGwtc2NyYXAtY2hldmFsLWJsYW5jLTEyMzQ4NDY3MTgv0gFRaHR0cHM6Ly9yb2JicmVwb3J0LmNvbS90cmF2ZWwvaG90ZWxzL2x2bWgtd2lsbC1zY3JhcC1jaGV2YWwtYmxhbmMtMTIzNDg0NjcxOC9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LVMH is preparing to bid adieu to its five-star hotel in Beverly Hills.

The French luxury conglomerate, helmed by billionaire Bernard Arnault, has announced that it will scrap plans for a Cheval Blanc at the north end of Rodeo Drive if the city’s residents vote against it in a special election. That outcome is looking more and more likely, too.

The most recent tally showed that the majority of voters oppose the 115-key hotel. Residents were asked two ballot questions: whether they approve of the zoning amendment that would allow the property to be constructed (Measure B) and whether they approve of the development agreement (Measure C).

“Although some votes remain to be counted, it now appears that Measures B and C have fallen short by a narrow margin, overturning the results of a comprehensive, years-long review and approval process,” LVMH spokesperson Jessica Miller said in a statement late Friday. “We are proud to have worked with so many residents, civic leaders and business owners who supported this once-in-a-generation investment that would have delivered hundreds of millions of dollars in city funding and a beautiful gateway project for the Golden Triangle.”

A rendering of Cheval Blanc Hotel Beverly Hills Peter Marino Architect

LVMH has spent nearly three years planning and petitioning for its first Cheval Blanc in the U.S., as reported by Women’s Wear Daily. Penned by architect Peter Marino, the proposed nine-floor hotel was set to replace at least four buildings at the intersection of Rodeo, Santa Monica Boulevard, and North Beverly Drive. The boutique hotel also included a private members club and a restaurant.

The Beverly Hills City Council actually approved the project (four votes to one) late last year. The council said the new development would generate as much as $778 million for the city over the next 30 years, as well as revive a prime stretch of Rodeo Drive. It quickly received pushback from some residents of the ritzy enclave, though.

A number of locals were concerned about the tower obstructing views and contributing to traffic congestion. Unite Here Local 11 also raised numerous objections during the planning process. The union, which represents hospitality workers, argued that zoning for affordable housing should have been built into the project. The opposition gathered enough signatures to prompt a referendum on the issue. The special election for the city’s 22,000 registered voters closed on May 23 and the final results will be certified on June 2.

“If the final vote count confirms the voters’ rejection of our project, we will respect the outcome, and will not bring the hotel project back in any form,” Miller added."

If the final vote count confirms the voters’ rejection of our project, we will respect the outcome, and will not bring the hotel project back in any form.”

Everyone involved in the project had been anxiously waiting for the final results ever since a special election was held last Tuesday to decide if the project would go forward. A slim majority of 60 votes rejected the hotel venture. But the Los Angeles County Registrar of Voters needed to do two more rounds of vote counting to tabulate provisional ballots, conditional voter registration ballots and mail-in ballots postmarked by election day but arriving later.

The first post-election count on Friday showed the margin against the hotel growing to about 125 votes. . The final results will be determined June 2.

John Mirisch, the lone city council member who voted against the project, said he was shocked that the opposing forces won, given the amount of money LVMH spent on the election. “Indeed, the election results – if they hold – show that Beverly Hills is more than just a brand to be monetized. It’s our home,” he said in an email. “Fortunately, there is still a large number of residents who remain committed to fighting the uphill battle for our community against the forces of self-interest and greed.”

LVMH spent three years presenting architectural plans, studies and analyses to make sure the first Cheval Blanc hotel in the U.S. was right for Beverly Hills. Last November, the 109-room hotel spread across Rodeo Drive, Little Santa Monica Boulevard and Beverly Drive, was approved by the Beverly Hills City Council on a 4-1 vote. The council touted that the new development would generate for the city some $778 million in unrestricted funding over the next 30 years, $26 million in non-earmarked funds and $2 million to support local art and culture.

Then an opposition, led by Unite Here Local 11, and locals against the project gathered enough signature to prompt a special election on May 23. When the results came in, they showed the opposition initially leading by a slim 60-vote margin, with 92 percent of the votes coming from mail-in ballots. Voter turnout was 32 percent.

Residents had to vote on two referendums, one approving a zoning variance and another codifying the city’s development agreement with LVMH. The referendum on the zoning variance most recently garnered 3,440 yes votes and 3,563 no votes. The referendum on the development agreement delivered 3,440 yes votes and 3,565 no votes.

Many residents believed the $2,000-a-night hotel would change the small-town vibe of the ritzy enclave of 32,000 residents. It would have risen to nine stories along Beverly Drive while reaching a more modest four stories on Rodeo Drive, where LVMH has 15 retail locations for its stable of luxury brands. Construction would have involved tearing down four buildings purchased by LVMH and the removal of more than 5,000 truckloads of debris and dirt.

For the 19th consecutive year, French luxury conglomerate LVMH figures first in the Universum ranking of most attractive employers among students at business schools in France.

Each year consultancy Universum conducts a survey of students to learn about their professional aspirations and motivations, as well as the criteria against which they measure the most attractive employers and companies.

“This result reflects the continuing strong appeal of LVMH and its maisons, and recognizes the group’s longstanding commitment to young generations,” LVMH said in a statement.

Based in Paris, LVMH is the world’s largest luxury conglomerate and also Europe’s most valuable company at a $500 billion-plus stock market valuation. Its chairman/CEO, Bernard Arnault, is the world’s richest person, with a net worth north of $210 billion.

Young won

LVMH hired more than 60,000 people worldwide in 2022, including more than 39,000 early-career professionals.

The top recruiting paths favored by students and early-career professionals are the various graduate programs offered by LVMH and its brands.

These programs, viewed as career accelerators, are designed to develop leadership skills and knowledge of different luxury industry sectors among new generations.

Through these graduate programs, LVMH and its brands offer students the resources needed to kick off a career and become future leaders at the company whose brand portfolio includes Louis Vuitton, Dior, Tiffany & Co., Bulgari, Dom Perignon and Loro Piana.

“LVMH has been actively committed to encouraging young generations since the creation of the group,” the company said.

LVMH in 1991 launched the first luxury industry chair in partnership with a top international business school.

Since then, LVMH has developed a strong strategy, with support and initiatives from its family of 75-plus brands.

LVMH helps next-generation talents craft their career journey, hosting more than 150 events in partnership with French business schools and universities including HEC Paris, ESSEC, Sciences Po Paris, Institut Français de la Mode, EDHEC, CentraleSupélec and Ecole Polytechnique.

Platform show

The company pointed out that this ongoing support in conjunction with partner schools is deployed within the framework of Inside LVMH, an omnichannel educational program that structures and consolidates this commitment.

Created in March 2021, the free access Inside LVMH platform gives students and young people around the world access to a digital platform at insidelvmh.com dedicated to luxury industry professions.

Indeed, this platform is designed to let them learn more about the luxury industry and take advantage of additional high-quality education led by experts from LVMH and outside the group, helping them prepare for their careers.

The platform – an outgrowth of the in-person Inside LVMH events introduced in 2016 – counted 150,000 registered users this month.

With more than 50 hours of exclusive content presented by luxury experts – LVMH employees, HR specialists, leaders from the group and its brands, as well as academics from top schools around the world – LVMH offers access to its six luxury business groups.

In addition to this unique content, the platform also proposes training that enables participants to earn certification.

After completing a 30-hour course based on exclusive modules and case studies, learners are awarded the Inside LVMH Certificate.

Since its launching, 92,000 learners signed up for the two Inside LVMH certification classes, and 40,000 of them were awarded certificates.

Registration for the first 2023 session closed on May 11, drawing 29,000 participants, reflecting strong interest from young people around the world, LVMH said."
Bernard Arnault loses $11B in wealth in one day - Fortune,"Wed, 24 May 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiigFodHRwczovL2ZvcnR1bmUuY29tL2V1cm9wZS8yMDIzLzA1LzI0L3dvcmxkLXJpY2hlc3QtbWFuLWJlcm5hcmQtYXJuYXVsdC1sdm1oLTExLWJpbGxpb24td2VhbHRoLXdpcGVkLW91dC1zdG9jay1yb3V0LWV1cm9wZWFuLWx1eHVyeS1nb29kcy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The world’s richest person, Bernard Arnault, saw his wealth drop by more than $11 billion in a single day following a luxury company stock price bloodbath.

The founder and CEO of the luxury powerhouse LVMH experienced a loss of $11.2 billion on Tuesday, as investors grow increasingly concerned that America’s economic slowdown will dampen demand for high-end goods.

The French tycoon, who owns top designer brands such as Louis Vuitton, Tiffany & Co., and Christian Dior, had been enjoying a prosperous 2023 in which his personal wealth ballooned.

Over the past year, the share prices of European luxury companies like LVMH surged despite economic woes—until this week: About $30 billion was wiped from the European luxury sector on Tuesday, when LVMH’s shares dropped by 5%.

Although the hit on Arnault’s net worth didn’t knock him off the top spot as the planet’s wealthiest person, it does see his lead on Tesla founder and “chief twit” Elon Musk narrow.

Despite the wipeout, the 74-year-old still has $192 billion to his name and a $12 billion lead over Musk’s $180 billion fortune—down from a $21 billion lead on Monday—reports Bloomberg.

But Arnault shouldn’t sit too comfortably: Musk lost his crown in very similar circumstances back in December 2022 when Tesla’s share price dropped.

How did Bernard Arnault make his fortune?

In 1971, Arnault kick-started his career by working at his father’s real estate company, where he proved he had an entrepreneurial mind from a young age: A 25-year-old Arnault convinced his father to sell the construction side of the business and shift its focus to property.

Arnault got his big break by putting up $15 million from that sale to buy the luxury goods company that owned the fashion brand Christian Dior, Boussac Saint-Frères, in 1984.

Following the acquisition, the billionaire fired 9,000 people working for the company, sold off most of the group’s assets (except the Dior brand), and earned the nickname “the Terminator.”

But his tough approach worked: By 1987, the company started making profits, reportedly generating $112 million in earnings from a revenue stream of $1.9 billion.

In the same year, he partnered with Alain Chevalier, CEO of Moët Hennessy, and Henry Racamier, president of Louis Vuitton, to form LVMH—and the rest is history.

Today, LVMH has some 75 luxury brands in its portfolio and, under Arnault’s leadership, has grown to become the largest company (by market capitalization) in Europe.

Just last month, the Paris-headquartered conglomerate became the first European company ever to cross $500 billion in market valuation, and Arnault’s wealth—which is largely tied to LVMH’s shares, including a 97.5% stake in Dior—topped $200 billion for the first time.

His five ultrawealthy children, all of whom work at LVMH brands, are vying to one day take over his luxury empire. But Arnault senior has shown no sign of slowing down, with LVMH recently hiking its age limit for chief executives from 75 to 80."
Beverly Hills Voters To Decide Whether World's Richest Person Can Build Hotel - CoStar Group,"Fri, 19 May 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNvc3Rhci5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS81ODkzOTUyODMvYmV2ZXJseS1oaWxscy12b3RlcnMtdG8tZGVjaWRlLXdoZXRoZXItd29ybGRzLXJpY2hlc3QtcGVyc29uLWNhbi1idWlsZC1ob3RlbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"A proposed luxury hotel in affluent Beverly Hills, California, would attempt to lure guests to an area that's considered underserved for hospitality — as long as residents vote to support the project.

French luxury conglomerate LVMH needs to win a special election on May 23 on whether it can proceed with redeveloping a former Brooks Brothers at 468 N. Rodeo Drive into a 109-room Cheval Blanc hotel. LVMH's founder, chairman and reported owner of about half the company is Bernard Arnault, who Forbes and Bloomberg have ranked as the world's richest person.

Beverly Hills is among the strongest hotel markets in Los Angeles and generates some of the highest rates in the city because of its famous shopping, relative lack of hotel competition and tourist attractions, said Alan Reay, president of Irvine-based hospitality brokerage Atlas Hospitality Group. Adding to the hotel's appeal is its location on Rodeo Drive, one of the world's most valuable shopping districts. The Hollywood-Beverly Hills hotel market has an average daily rate of $348.82, well above the greater L.A. average of $199.18, according to CoStar data.

""It would phenomenally successful,"" Reay said of the proposed Cheval Blanc hotel. ""The demand for that product will outstrip the number of rooms it has""

However, it has long been difficult to build new hotels in California as these developments can face issues including lack of land, stiff opposition and onerous approval processes. The muted levels of new hotel inventory, though, generates demand for existing hospitality properties, driving up their value, Reay said.

The vote is a test of whether the city of Beverly Hills, located on L.A.'s Westside, wants more hotel development in the years ahead. At least 216 luxury hotel rooms are in the works in Beverly Hills in a market that features 17 hotel properties, according to CoStar data.

Heated Debate

Supporters say the Cheval Blanc hotel would generate roughly $778 million in tax revenues to the city's general fund over the next 30 years and bring more business to Rodeo Drive and Beverly Hills. Project champions include the Beverly Hills Chamber of Commerce in addition to the city's firefighters’ and police associations. Numerous residents and businesses also have voiced their support for the development.

The project went through a two-and-a-half year planning process and won approval from the Beverly Hills planning commission and city council in 2022. Then, labor union Unite Here Local 11 gathered enough signatures to put the hotel development on the ballot. The group opposes the project due to a lack of nearby affordable housing available for workers at the hotel site.

Some residents oppose the project simply because they don't support new construction. ""He's coming for us: Bernard Arnault, the world's richest man,"" according to a YouTube video opposing the project. Arnault is ""bringing noise, construction traffic. All so he can own Beverly Hills.""

LVMH is among the most active property buyers in Beverly Hills. In March, the French luxury company bought the roughly 14,100-square-foot retail property at 357 N. Beverly Drive for $43 million, or about $3,000 per square foot. LVMH also acquired the former 80-room Luxe Hotel at 360 N. Rodeo Drive for an eye-popping $200 million, or about $2.5 million a room, in December 2021.

Representatives for LVMH and Unite Here Local 11 didn't respond to request to comment from CoStar News.

Luxury's Race to the Top | BoF - The Business of Fashion,"Wed, 03 May 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzb2ZmYXNoaW9uLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy9sdXh1cnkvbHV4dXJ5cy1yYWNlLXRvLXRoZS10b3Av0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LVMH pioneered the concept of a luxury group in the 1980s and is largely credited with having saved the French fashion and leather goods industry from oblivion. For years, it looked like LVMH might be the sole consolidator in fashion and leather goods, with Swatch and Richemont carving out dominant positions in hard luxury (saving the Swiss mechanical watch industry from destitution). The entry of PPR (now Kering) into the game with the 1999 acquisitions of Gucci and Sanofi Beauté (which owned YSL and YSL Beauty) changed the game, validating LVMH’s strategy and opening the door for other, albeit smaller, consolidators such as Capri Holdings, Tapestry and Prada Group. What’s driving this race to the top? Who has benefitted? And who has lost out?

The top 5 companies in the Savigny Luxury Index account for close to 80 percent of the total sales generated by the 17 companies which populate the SLI and they own 142 out of the 190 brands covered by the index. LVMH is in a league of its own, accounting for 42 percent of SLI revenue, 45 percent of SLI enterprise value, and 75 of the 190 brands within the index. LVMH has also made by far the most acquisitions of SLI players, making 140 deals since 2000, more than triple that of its closest competitor, Kering.

Profitability is a key driver behind the race for scale in luxury. The top five companies in the SLI, which all have a turnover in excess of €10 billion, had an average EBITDA margin of 31.2 percent last year. That compares with an average EBITDA margin of 20.6 percent for the rest of the SLI. Some of the smaller companies score well in terms of profitability but this is most likely driven by the fact that they have a strong hero product, such as the trench coat for Burberry, or are specialised in a particular segment such as winter jackets for Moncler or cashmere/high end apparel for Brunello Cucinelli.

The correlation between size and profitability stems from the virtuous cycle of lower unit production costs (as the size of production runs increase), the power of heft when negotiating terms with retailers, landlords and advertising outlets and, as long as the brand does not become too ubiquitous, increased pricing power.

On this last point, Hermès is a master class, with waiting lists for its Birkin bags having stretched up to six years in the past, allowing the brand to charge a significant premium for its so-called “quota” bags (the Kelly, Birkin and Constance). The legendary leather goods company posted yet another record EBITDA margin of over 40 percent last year.

Kering and LVMH have also demonstrated the benefits of multiple brand ownership, whether it is LVMH leveraging on the power of Christian Dior to negotiate better placement in beauty stores for Guerlain or Givenchy or Kering shifting management resources from brand to brand where needed, such as Marco Bizzarri, previously CEO of Bottega Venetta and head of Kering’s luxury couture and leather goods unit, being appointed CEO of Gucci in 2015.

There is also an element of diversification of risk that comes into play, combined with the ability to push a hotter/fresher brand when brand fatigue emerges at a stablemate, although the reality is that the two groups are still reliant on their flagship brands, Louis Vuitton and Gucci, for the bulk of their profits (particularly so in the case of Kering and Gucci).

LVMH’s ambitions in the watches and jewellery sector date back to the late 1990′s when the group started by buying Zenith, Ebel, Chaumet and Tag Heuer and setting up a jewellery joint venture with De Beers. The group also engaged in a fierce duel with Richemont to acquire Jaeger-LeCoultre, IWC and Lange & Soehne but ending up losing due to Richemont’s strategic imperative to deliver what was then a landmark deal, leading the Swiss-based group to pay well over the odds at the time.

LVMH was also thought to have paid too much when it acquired Bulgari in 2011 at a premium of almost 60 percent on the Italian jeweller’s share price, valuing the company at €3.7 billion. Or did they? With hindsight, perhaps not. And that is the point. These groups had the scale, the vision, the management and financial resources to vastly improve the trajectory of the brands they acquired. This has played out again more recently with LVMH’s acquisition of Tiffany for $15.8 billion, a deal which propelled the group’s watches and jewellery division to the number two position in the industry, with €10.5 billion in sales (behind only Richemont with €14.5 billion sales).

While LVMH seemed to have a case of pandemic-induced buyer’s remorse before closing the Tiffany deal, managing to renegotiate a slightly lower price, that feels like a distant memory now with the brand performing extremely well, fuelled by impactful campaigns featuring Beyonce and Jay Z, the successful launch of its Lock jewellery collection, solid growth in its high jewellery business and, now, the relaunch of its legendary Fifth Avenue store.

No doubt this relatively rapid closing of the gap with Richemont has fuelled the speculation that Richemont and Kering could merge and thus give LVMH a run for its money. Worth pointing out is the fact that a combined Richemont/Kering would still only be half the size of LVMH in terms of turnover and that the merger would do nothing to change the relative market positions of the groups in fashion/leather goods or in watches/jewellery.

A killer blow would be for either LVMH to acquire Richemont to become the number one luxury watches/jewellery group in the world (it is already the number one luxury fashion and leather goods group by a mile) or to acquire Estée Lauder in order to become the number one luxury beauty group in the world. Anything less, except for perhaps a bid for Chanel, would do little to change the broad dynamics that already exist in the luxury stratosphere.

Tapestry embarked on a multi-brand strategy in 2015 with the acquisition of Stuart Weitzman followed by the 2017 acquisition of Kate Spade, but the group made no moves since, focussing on cleaning up its distribution. (Two of the group’s former CEO’s joined forces to set up a SPAC in 2021, which currently has a market value of $350 million, which does not give them much firepower considering that the latest luxury SPAC to provide a home for a brand was Zegna, which listed at a valuation of $2.4 billion).

Capri threw its hat in the ring in 2017 with the acquisition of Jimmy Choo followed by the 2018 acquisition of Versace. The lack of strategic overlap between its core Michael Kors brand and Jimmy Choo and Versace, the lack of scale of all three brands and the persistently low relative stock market valuation of the group and its relatively high leverage means Capri’s ambitions to build a luxury conglomerate seems to have been put on hold.

In Italy, both Prada and Moncler have been touted as consolidators. Prada successfully launched sister brand Miu Miu and has acquired two shoe brands (Church’s and Car Shoe) as well as a café (Marchesi). But the group’s ambitions to scale were somewhat thwarted by the unlucky timing of its IPO, which saddled Prada with a lot of debt.

Whether it’s Tapestry and Coach in the US or Prada and Moncler in Italy, the issue with the next tier of players is that there is such a significant gap between these contenders, which individually account for between 2 and 3 percent of the SLI’s revenue and between 1 and 2 percent of the SLI’s enterprise value, and the SLI’s top five companies. This means that they are more likely to be acquisition opportunities for the likes of LVMH and Kering than consolidators themselves.

The Savigny Luxury Index (“SLI”) gained almost 6 percent in March, driven by improved sentiment around the first quarter performance of the sector. Conversely the MSCI declined by almost 5 percentage points due to continued prospects of further interest rate hikes worldwide.

SLI vs. MSCI

Going up

Brunello Cucinelli published its 2022 annual report showing revenue growth of 29.1 percent and EBIT growth of 74.5 percent. The luxury apparel and cashmere group’s shares ended the month 14.6 percent up.

Moncler’s 2022 revenue and EBIT came in ahead of expectations, with strong performance in China despite continuing lockdowns. The company is optimistic about 2023. Moncler’s share price rose by 9.9 percent in March.

Hermès’ share price rose 8.7 percent in March in anticipation of strong first quarter revenue growth (on which it over-delivered), despite tougher comps than the rest of the sector given that Hermès’ performance was not as badly affected by lockdowns in China in the first quarter of 2022, and thanks to the perceived strength of the brand’s pricing power vs its peers.

Going down

Ferragamo’s share price fell 6.4 percent in March on the back of 2022′s annual results showing progression in revenue but a further decline in operating margin to 10.2 percent (the group’s EBITDA margin for 2022 was 23.8 percent, down from 26.8 percent in 2021). Analysts estimate a further decline in margins for 2023 as Ferragamo continues its lengthy turnaround.

Capri Holdings lost 5.2 percent in March. The struggling US group’s shares dropped 28.2 percent on 8 February on the back of disappointing third quarter results in which declines in sales and profits were reported partly due to price increases at Michael Kors dampening demand.

What to watch

As the top groups consolidate their power, do small deals and small brands have no hope? Not necessarily. While scale offers an overwhelming advantage and big brands have gained market share through the pandemic, the overall luxury market is growing — just as the world is growing. That means there’s still space for new entrants.

This is particularly true in beauty, where wholesaling to multi-brand retailers remains the norm, allowing for faster growth in a sector where creativity and image can trump craftsmanship and heritage (see: Byredo, Drunk Elephant and Aesop).

And yet, while heritage can be overcome by creativity, it is effectively a barrier to entry given the length of time it takes to develop. The good news is that it can be acquired and successfully relaunched, for example at Moynat (LVMH), Schiaparelli (Tod’s) or Paul Poiret, which is now being revived as a premium beauty brand by Korean retailer Shinsegae. Last but not least there’s Gerald Genta, the namesake brand of the legendary Swiss watch designer behind Audemars Piguet’s Royal Oak and Patek Philippe’s Nautilus, which was acquired by LVMH as part of the Bulgari deal in 2011 and has been relaunched this year.

French luxury conglomerate LVMH said in a statement late Friday its effort appeared to have fallen short by a narrow margin to allow the company to redevelop a former Brooks Brothers into a 109-room Cheval Blanc hotel at 468 N. Rodeo Drive along the world famous retail corridor.

LVMH was down more than 120 votes, according to the Los Angeles County Registrar-Recorder/County Clerk on Tuesday. The election is expected to be certified Friday. LVMH's founder, chairman and reported owner of about half the company is Bernard Arnault, who Forbes and Bloomberg have ranked as the world's richest person.

A spokesperson for LVMH said in the statement it won't bring the hotel project back in any form if the final vote rejects the development.

The project went through a two-and-a-half year planning process and won approval from the Beverly Hills planning commission and city council in 2022. Then, labor union Unite Here Local 11 gathered enough signatures to put the hotel development on the ballot.

Project supporters said the development would have generated $778 million in tax revenue to the city's general fund over the next 30 years. Detractors included Beverly Hills residents who don't support construction and Unite Here Local 11, which argued that there wasn't enough affordable housing available for workers near the hotel site.

Development Challenges Ahead

Analysts say the hotel's rejection will have a chilling effect on future hotel investment in the city. Alan Reay, president of Irvine-based hospitality brokerage Atlas Hospitality Group, said the vote shows that hotel developers need to work closely with unions to secure support for future projects.

Alternatively, the vote demonstrated why California hotels sell at a premium compared with the rest of the country because of the difficulty of building, Reay said.

Hotel developers now will have new questions to ask themselves before pursuing construction in Beverly Hills, including whether there are more favorable markets elsewhere to build, Reay said.

At least 216 luxury hotel rooms are in the works in Beverly Hills in a market that features 17 hotel properties, according to CoStar data.

""Do they want to take on and try to develop a hotel in Beverly Hills when the wealthiest person in the world didn't succeed?"" Reay said.

Despite the years of planning and millions of dollars spent pursuing the hotel redevelopment project, the property is expected to reopen as a retail store.

With a mission to “take root in Asia and China and create the beauty of the world,” LVMH Perfumes and Cosmetics’s Asia R&D Center will enable maisons under the group’s beauty business to gain insight into local consumers’ shopping behaviors, cutting-edge technology, and raw materials development, formula innovation, as well as working with the French R&D center to localize new concepts.

Billed as the biggest R&D center for LVMH in Asia, it takes up more than 23,000 square feet. It comes with skin care, makeup and color development laboratories, product testing rooms, and workshop space in Jinqiao on the outskirts of Shanghai. The center also has a consumer hub that’s equipped with several testing areas. It sits together with LVMH’s China head office at Plaza 66 in downtown Shanghai.

Andrew Wu, president of LVMH Greater China, feted the opening of the center with Bruno Bavouzet, executive vice president of LVMH Recherche, the group’s research and development arm; Jean-Michel Moutin, chief operating officer at LVMH Perfumes and Cosmetics; Thibaut Teisseire, chief operating officer China at LVMH Perfumes and Cosmetics; Nathalie Renaudeau, human resource director at LVMH Recherche, and Amanda Chen, Asia R&D director at LVMH, among others.

Wu said during the ceremony that LVMH will bring the concept of high-end brands and the group’s research and development strength to present beauty products that are more innovative and better meet the diverse needs of Asian consumers, and improve the consumer beauty experience to better serve the Asian market.

The inauguration of the center also demonstrates LVMH’s determination to strengthen its ties with Asia, Wu added. He believes that the R&D center marks an important opportunity for the group to learn from Chinese consumers.

“China’s market is becoming more and more important, and so is Asia’s. I believe that the world will be better with the development of China’s market, and China will become stronger and stronger in its interaction with the world,” Wu said, adding that it is one of LVMH’s social responsibilities to actively endorse “the new connection between the Chinese market and the world.”

Bavouzet noted that there are around 700 scientists at the moment who provide research and development services for all beauty brands under the LVMH umbrella, such as Guerlain, Fresh, Make Up For Ever, Christian Dior, Fenty Beauty, and Cha Ling.

Including Shanghai, LVMH Recherche now operates in five locations. The other four are in Seoul, Tokyo, Paris and Saint-Jean-de-Braye, France.

In the first quarter of 2023, LVMH’s perfumes and cosmetics logged a 10 percent improvement in organic revenue growth.

Jean-Jacques Guiony, chief financial officer of LVMH, said during an earnings call that cosmetics remained “a little under pressure in mainland China” in the period, compared to the nation’s robust appetite for fashion, leather goods and jewelry.

Gen Zers are redefining the values of the luxury market. Status and prestige are out–sustainability and inclusivity are in - Fortune,"Fri, 12 May 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMioAFodHRwczovL2ZvcnR1bmUuY29tL2V1cm9wZS8yMDIzLzA1LzEyL2dlbi16ZXJzLWFyZS1yZWRlZmluaW5nLXRoZS12YWx1ZXMtb2YtdGhlLWx1eHVyeS1tYXJrZXQtc3RhdHVzLWFuZC1wcmVzdGlnZS1hcmUtb3V0LXN1c3RhaW5hYmlsaXR5LWFuZC1pbmNsdXNpdml0eS1hcmUtaW4v0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The luxury market is undergoing a radical transformation as it adapts to the growing spending power of Gen Z. Along with Millennials, these consumers accounted “for the entire growth of the luxury market in 2022,” according to Bain & Company, and are predicted to represent 70% of luxury spending by 2025.

The challenge for luxury brands is that Gen has increasingly divergent value systems from previous generations of consumers. To attract and keep them engaged, luxury brands are rapidly having to move beyond the traditional notions of luxury–such as status, legacy, prestige, and heritage–towards a new set of values: inclusivity, sustainability, transparency, technology, and circular innovation.

This is leading to a deconstruction of the luxury market as it builds connections with other, often unexpected, parts of culture and commerce. On the ground, this can be seen in surprising partnerships between luxury brands and high-street brands, particularly ones that have the cultural cachet or values that luxury brands are seeking to develop. But brands have to tread carefully here.

Tiffany & Co’s highly anticipated collaboration with Nike on a limited edition pair of Air Force Ones may have pushed the boundaries of what “luxury” means today–but it caused a backlash on social media as sneaker connoisseurs, notorious for their discernment, claimed that “you can’t buy cred.”

eBay’s surprising entry into the luxury market was perhaps more successful. The brand’s recent Luxury Exchange pop-up in New York invited shoppers to have their luxury goods appraised and valued, which they could then use to purchase items from the platform’s top luxury sellers, including Bottega Veneta and Cartier. This shows how new notions of fluidity and transparency can reposition an everyday brand such as eBay at the cutting edge of luxury. It also shows the willingness of luxury brands to forge unlikely partnerships as a way to express these emerging values.

The eBay example also highlights how the luxury sector is evolving to meet the growing demand for pre-owned luxury goods, a market estimated to be worth €43 billion in 2022 (circa $46 billion). This trend is being fueled by the importance younger consumers are placing on sustainability and circular economies. 84% of Gen Z consumers and 73% of Millennials will spend more on sustainably produced and ethically sourced products, according to Tata Consultancy Services. This is partly due to their desire to become “collectors” in their own right and buy second-hand luxury items as sustainable investments and assets to trade at a later date, rather than as pristine status symbols or heirlooms.

Rolex recently launched a certified pre-owned program, a move that shows how luxury brands can adapt to new notions of luxury while maintaining traditional values of superior quality and heritage. In 2021, LVMH-owned watchmaker Zenith launched a range that authenticates, restores, and certifies models from its archives to sell to consumers shopping for pre-owned luxury goods.

Meanwhile, Prada’s first foray into fine jewelry is a collection made from 100% recycled gold. It was launched with a campaign featuring poet and activist Amanda Gorman, a clear sign that the new figureheads of luxury are those that represent diversity, inclusivity, community, and equality.

The luxury sector is also engaging younger consumers by showing an appreciation of emerging technology and using it to help realize other emerging values, such as transparency and inclusivity.

LVMH, Prada, and Mercedes-Benz have started using blockchain technology to help trace the lifecycle of their products to show that each one has been responsibly made and sourced, and is 100% authentic. This has significant implications for the luxury jewelry market, with De Beers already exploring how every single diamond they use can be traced using blockchain.

Brands are also using technology to create virtual spaces to engage younger consumers, such as the experimental ‘Gucci Vault’: an interactive fashion experience that includes a virtual display of vintage items and games that teach players about the luxury house’s history. Meanwhile, Web3 digital marketplaces are disrupting the luxury sector by offering designers an alternative marketplace where they can sell both physical and digital versions of their products, such as NFTs.

A mere five or 10 years ago, all of these developments–from high-street partnerships and second-hand goods to circular economies and virtual marketplaces–would have felt jarring for the luxury sector. Today, they seem completely culturally relevant, a clear indication of just how widely and rapidly young people are redefining the values of the luxury market.

Richemont Group Says No to an Acquisition by LVMH - LUXUO,"Mon, 15 May 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmx1eHVvLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy9yaWNoZW1vbnQtZ3JvdXAtc2F5cy1uby10by1hbi1hY3F1aXNpdGlvbi1ieS1sdm1oLmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Business

Chairman of Richemont Group Johann Rupert put to rest the acquisition rumours and said that the company was not for sale.

May 15, 2023 | By Joseph Low

Since the start of the year, there have been rumours about a potential acquisition by the world’s largest luxury group LVMH of its fellow rival Richemont Group. The “whispers” were first reported by the Swiss newspaper Finanz und Wartscaft in February this year and has since gathered momentum. After LVMH’s successful turnover at Tiffany & Co., those in the luxury M&A space are speculating what the group’s next moves would be and many pointed towards Richemont’s crown jewel: Cartier.

It is understandable why Bernard Arnault would want to add Cartier to its portfolio of brands; the maison is among the largest in the watchmaking and jewellery industry. Furthermore, according to Richemont’s latest financial results, its jewellery masons consisting of Buccellati, Cartier and Van Cleef & Arpels generated 21 per cent sales growth compared to the prior year. This amounted to €13.4 billion, and overall, for the year ended 31 March 2023, the group reported strong performance with sales which saw it increase by 19 per cent to an all-time high of €20 billion.

However, there is much more that LVMH can gain from a total takeover of the Richemont Group. Not only will it further cement LVMH’s position in the area of jewellery making, but it will also boost its market share in the specialist watchmaking sector. Notably, Vacheron Constantin was singled out to have reached one billion euros in sales, and Cartier watchmaking remains one of the largest in the world just after Rolex. Internally, with the addition of Richemont Group, the Watches & Jewellery business unit at LVMH will likely see an increase in its revenue, and this narrows the gap against its cash cow that is the Fashion & Leather Goods.

The takeover will also become the largest in history after LVMH’s US$15.8 billion buyout of Tiffany & Co. in 2021. According to Bloomberg, LVMH has a market capitalisation of more than US$400 billion and buying over Richemont Group is within the means of the company. “Assuming a 30 per cent premium, acquiring Richemont would cost about US$116 billion.”

During the press call on 12 May, Richemont Group’s chairman Johann Rupert put to rest the acquisition rumours and said that the company was not for sale. The South African billionaire shared he has had numerous discussions with LVMH’s Bernard Arnault but ultimately both “respect each other’s independence”. This is not the first time Richemont has to address such rumours. Two years ago, Richemont also decided against a deal with Kering Group.

According to Luca Solca, a senior analyst at Bernstein consultancy, Richemont has revealed modifications to its board and senior management framework to strengthen its positions and effectively handle succession. Solca commented that the market would likely interpret these developments as further evidence that Richemont intends to maintain its independence and avoid significant mergers and acquisitions that would lead to transformative changes.

Even if the huge price tag is not an issue for LVMH, there are still several obstacles that the group has to overcome. In an article by WWD, analyst Oliver Chen at TD Cowen raised some pertinent points. Chen estimated the buyout by LVMH would be “dilutive to LVMH’s finances”. This includes incurring a debt, getting approval from global anti-trust regulators, convincing Richemont’s owner Johann Rupert and successfully integrating the acquired group into LVMH. Even the savviest dealmaker may be unable to pull this off considering the various factors.

With an extensive collection of 26 luxury brands and businesses such as Cartier, Chloé, Montblanc, IWC, A. Lange & Söhne, Van Cleef & Arpels, Jaeger-LeCoultre, Panerai, Piaget, and Vacheron Constantin, as well as retail platforms under YOOX Net-a-Porter Group, Richemont currently holds the position of the fourth-largest luxury company globally based on its market capitalisation.

Beverly Hills voters reject swanky Rodeo Drive hotel bid by world's richest man Bernard Arnault - New York Post,"Mon, 29 May 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vbnlwb3N0LmNvbS8yMDIzLzA1LzI5L2JldmVybHktaGlsbHMtcmVqZWN0cy1iZXJuYXJkLWFybmF1bHRzLXJvZGVvLWRyaXZlLWhvdGVsLWJpZC_SAV9odHRwczovL255cG9zdC5jb20vMjAyMy8wNS8yOS9iZXZlcmx5LWhpbGxzLXJlamVjdHMtYmVybmFyZC1hcm5hdWx0cy1yb2Rlby1kcml2ZS1ob3RlbC1iaWQvYW1wLw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Bernard Arnault, the world’s richest man, has given up on plans to build a luxury hotel on Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills after locals voted down the proposal over fears it would drive up the cost of living while worsening traffic congestion.

Arnault, the French mogul whose fortune as of Monday was valued at $193 billion by Bloomberg Billionaires Index, derives his wealth from his massive stake in multinational luxury conglomerate LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton.

Last year, his proposal to build the Cheval Blanc, a 109-room, nine-story hotel equipped with a members-only club, restaurants, retail space, and a spa, won zoning approval from city officials who hoped Arnault would make Beverly Hills the first US city to boast the luxury brand.

There are currently Cheval Blanc in Paris, St. Tropez, Courchevel in the French Alps, St. Bart’s, and the Madlves.

A room at Cheval Blanc Paris can cost up to $7,200 a night.

Arnault’s plan for the Beverly Hills site reportedly included a mammoth structure that was taller and double the size of what was originally permitted at the site — sparking local opposition, according to Commercial Observer.

The news site reported that some 7,005 votes were counted.

Voters were asked two questions — whether Beverly Hills should approve a zoning amendment allowing the hotel to be built at double the size of what is permitted and whether they would approve of the development and tax agreement.

On the first question, the nays won out by just 123 votes.

The second question was voted down by 125 votes, according to Commercial Observer.

An updated vote tally is expected on Tuesday — with final certification of the results scheduled for Friday.

LVMH had agreed to contribute $28 million to the city if the project was approved.

Beverly Hills would also have received an additional 4% surcharge on top of the 14% transient occupancy tax that hotels normally pay.

If the hotel was approved, it would have been forecast to generate around $725 million in tax revenue over the next 30 years.

LVMH has also agreed to reimburse Beverly Hills for the cost of holding the special election.

“We oppose the monolithic Cheval Blanc Hotel project because it is just too big and tall for our village,” according to leaflets distributed by opponents of the plan who call themselves “Residents Against Overdevelopment.”

The “Yes on B&C Campaign,” a lobbying group backed by LVMH, conceded defeat.

“If the final vote count confirms the voters’ rejection of our project, we will respect the outcome, and will not bring the hotel project back in any form,” the group said in a statement."

According to the Registrar-Recorder/County Clerk, 50.56% of voters (3,591) voted no on Measure B, which asks if voters want to approve the zoning change allowing the project to go forward. Meanwhile, 49.44% of voters (3,511) voted yes.

Measure C asks if voters want to approve the city’s development agreement with the city, and 50.57% of voters (3,594) voted no, while 49.43% (3,513) voted yes.

The certified results show that between May 26 and June 2, the Registrar/Recorder-County Clerk counted an additional 71 “yes” votes for Measure B, and an additional 28 “no” votes for the measure.

County officials also counted 73 “yes” votes for Measure C, and 29 “no” votes for Measure C.

The Registrar-Recorder/County Clerk added that 32.17% of eligible voters cast a total of 7,128 ballots throughout the election.

Although the results have now been certified, the election will be officially concluded by the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors on June 6.

This article was updated on June 2 to reflect new election results.

While the results for the Measure B and C election in Beverly Hills have not yet been certified, LVMH, the French luxury goods brand behind the Cheval Blanc project, issued a statement accepting defeat on May 26.

“We deeply appreciate the hard work and commitment of so many Beverly Hills residents, elected leaders and others on behalf of Cheval Blanc Beverly Hills and the lasting benefits it would bring to the city. Although some votes remain to be counted, it now appears that measures B and C have fallen short by a narrow margin, overturning the results of a comprehensive, years-long review and approval process that resulted in the unanimous approval of the project by the Planning Commission and a 4-1 vote of support by the City Council,” a campaign spokesperson said. “We are proud to have worked with so many residents, civic leaders and business owners who supported this once-in-a-generation investment that would have delivered hundreds of millions of dollars in city funding, and a beautiful gateway project for the Golden Triangle. If the final vote count confirms the voters’ rejection of our project, we will respect the outcome, and will not bring the hotel project back in any form.”

According to the most recent results released on May 26, 50.88% of voters (3,563) voted no on Measure B, while 49.12% of voters (3,440) voted yes.

Meanwhile, 50.89% of voters (3,565) voted no on Measure C, and 49.11% of voters (3,440) voted yes on the measure.

Measure B asks if residents want to approve the zoning change allowing the project to go forward, and Measure C asks if residents want to approve the city’s development agreement with LVMH.

The Los Angeles County Registrar-Recorder/County Clerk said there are 135 outstanding vote by mail ballots left to be processed. All of the ballots are pending signature corrections from voters whose signature was missing on the return envelope or did not match their registration record. The voters have been notified with instructions on how to correct their ballots so they can be counted.

Mayor Julian Gold lamented the results, saying the city had missed an opportunity to host a world-class hotel that would have brought prestige and financial benefits.

“[The project] would have enhanced the north end of Rodeo Drive and brought new generations of tourists to Beverly Hills. In addition, it would have made major contributions to our budget, supporting and enhancing all the essential services that touch our residents every day,” Gold said.

He added that LVMH owns the buildings on North Rodeo and North Beverly drives that would have been demolished for construction and the company can now do what it pleases, including leaving the properties vacant.

“Hardly sounds like a victory to me,” Gold said.

One of the buildings that would have been demolished is the former home of the Paley Center for Media, which is now occupied by the Mr. Brainwash Art Museum.

Darian Bojeaux, treasurer of Residents Against Overdevelopment, said that while she did not want to declare victory too early, given that some ballots still need to be counted, she is cautiously optimistic.

“It’s looking better for us than for them,” she said.

Bojeaux said the Yes Campaign’s statement indicated that LVMH would not return with a more “reasonable” proposal, which seemed like a “punishment” of sorts for overturning the project.

“I feel like, ‘Ok, don’t let the door hit you on the way out,”’ Bojeaux added."

The founder of LVMH – whose offerings include Louis Vuitton handbags and Christian Dior gowns – had seen his wealth balloon for most of 2023, as share prices of European luxury companies surged.

Watch: Who is Bernard Arnault?

Who is Bernard Arnault, the man who replaced Elon Musk as world’s richest?

On Tuesday, he gave back some of those gains. LVMH shares fell 5 per cent in Paris – the most in more than a year – amid a broader decline that erased about $30 billion from the European luxury sector.

Even with the sell-off, the French billionaire still has a net worth of $191.6 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. He’s added $29.5 billion to his personal fortune so far this year.

The gap between the fortunes of Mr Arnault and Tesla chief executive Elon Musk, the world’s second-richest person, has shrunk to just $11.4 billion.

Tuesday’s rout came after a lengthy rally in LVMH’s share price, which is still up 23 per cent for the year. The MSCI Europe Textiles Apparel and Luxury Goods Index has surged 27 per cent.

Attendees at a luxury conference in Paris organised by Morgan Stanley flagged a “relatively more subdued” performance in the US, according to Edouard Aubin, an analyst at the investment bank.

Deutsche Bank analysts Matt Garland and Adam Cochrane said in a note that they expect investors to become more selective with European luxury stocks, with slowing growth in the US a concern.

Until March, Kleitman was president and CEO at Parfums Christian Dior.

More from WWD

At Mandarin Oriental International, the executive succeeds James Riley, who held that position at the hotel chain since 2016.

Kleitman began at Parfums Christian Dior in November 2019, after decades working in the beauty industry. Dior has been the jewel in the crown of LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton’s perfumes and cosmetics division, which generated sales of 7.72 billion euros in 2022.

Under Kleitman’s leadership, Dior’s business grew, the brand laid out its sustainable development path and named a new perfumer, among other milestones.

Prior to Dior, starting in 2017, Kleitnman worked at Coty Inc., as president of the company’s consumer beauty division, based in New York. Between 2015 and 2017, he was executive vice president of global hair care at Unilever.

Kleitman also held the position of CEO of Unilever in Russia, Ukraine and Belarus. Before that, he spent three years heading LVMH in Russia, including the perfumes and cosmetics business, where he jump-started growth after the 2008 financial crisis. The executive began his career at Unilever in marketing.

“With Laurent’s leadership, we will continue to grow our global portfolio of luxury hotels, resorts and residences,” Ben Keswick, chairman of Mandarin Oriental International, said in a statement. “Building on Mandarin Oriental’s renowned legendary service, he will further evolve our brand for our guests ­— delivering 21st-century luxury hospitality and lifestyle experiences steeped in a rich and proud Asian heritage.”

Kleitman is the latest beauty executive to move into a top hospitality role. Stéphane Rinderknech joined LVMH from L’Oréal in 2022 to head up LVMH’s Hospitality Excellence division, which includes Hôtels Cheval Blanc and Belmond Hotels and trains. The executive most recently, in early March, was appointed chairman and CEO of LVMH Perfumes and Cosmetics division, alongside that role.

World's richest person Bernard Arnault loses $11B in one day — but he's still richer than Elon Musk - New York Post,"Wed, 24 May 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vbnlwb3N0LmNvbS8yMDIzLzA1LzI0L3dvcmxkcy1yaWNoZXN0LWJlcm5hcmQtYXJuYXVsdC1sb3Nlcy0xMWItaW4tYS1zaW5nbGUtZGF5L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The world’s richest person, Bernard Arnault, had $11.2 billion less in his bank account as of Tuesday, closing the gap in wealth between himself and Elon Musk, the No. 2 wealthiest person.

The 74-year-old CEO of LVMH — which controls about 75 luxury brands, including Louis Vuitton, Tiffany & Co., and Christian Dior — took the hit to his wealth the same day LVMH shares fell 5% in Paris, Bloomberg reported.

Tuesday’s stock blow was the biggest decline LVMH shares saw in more than a year.

They slumped alongside Hermes International, which fell 5.5%, and Gucci owner Kering SA, which decreased more than 2%.

The European luxury sector was slashed by about $30 billion as a result, according to Bloomberg.

However, Arnault still ranks No. 1 in the Bloomberg Billionaires Index‘s ranking of the world’s richest people, with a net worth of $192 billion — $12 billion above Musk.

Before LVMH’s stock rout, Arnault’s net worth was $203 billion on Monday — $21 billion above Musk’s reported fortune of $182 billion the same day.

Arnault’s net worth increased $29.5 billion over the course of the past year, which could be attributed to LVMH’s stock soaring up to 35% over that time.

Despite Tuesday’s selloff, LVMH’s share price is still up 23% for the year. The MSCI Europe Textiles Apparel & Luxury Goods Index has also risen to 27%, Bloomberg reported.

Musk, meanwhile, remains the world’s second-richest person with a net worth of $180 billion.

Musk, 51, was the world’s richest person in 2022 by a landslide, reaching a peak of $340 billion.

However, his wealth took a massive blow, dipping to as low as $126 billion, in the wake of his October 2022 Twitter purchase.

Luxury Stocks Lose $30 Billion in One Day on Demand Fears - The Business of Fashion,"Tue, 23 May 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzb2ZmYXNoaW9uLmNvbS9uZXdzL2x1eHVyeS9sdXh1cnktc3RvY2tzLWxvc2UtMzAtYmlsbGlvbi1pbi1vbmUtZGF5LW9uLWRlbWFuZC1mZWFycy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"A blistering rally in luxury goods stocks this year powered by international demand, particularly from China, has taken a hit, wiping out more than $30 billion from the sector on Tuesday.

Shares in Hermès International slumped as much as 5.5 percent, while LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE dropped around 4 percent, and Gucci owner Kering SA saw its stock decline more than 2 percent. In the past year, the high-flying sector has become to the European stock market what Big Tech is to the US: a collection of dominant businesses whose growth has held up even as the economy waxes and wanes.

Confidence in that view has now been dented, however, with attendees at a luxury conference in Paris organised by Morgan Stanley flagging a “relatively more subdued” performance in the US, according to Edouard Aubin, an analyst at the investment bank. That reflects “weakness in the aspirational consumer in particular.”

That was counterbalanced by more buoyant demand elsewhere, according to Morgan Stanley. “Overall, we found corporate commentary resilient, pointing to an ongoing soft landing in the US largely offset by strength in other markets.”

Both Asia and the US are important markets for European luxury companies. Asia, excluding Japan, accounted for 30 percent of LVMH’s sales in 2022, while the US made up 27 percent, according to the company’s annual report.

Deutsche Bank AG analysts have also said that a slowdown in the US is now a growing concern. While the rebound in Chinese demand has been among the key drivers of strong sales, investors are likely to be picky from here on, they added.

Still, luxury stocks have been outperforming by a large margin this year: LVMH is up 25 percent, and Hermès has added 34 percent, both outperforming a 10 percent rise in the broader Stoxx Europe 600 Index. Neither LVMH nor Hermès were immediately available to comment on the conference in Paris.

“The luxury sector remains a crowded long for many investors, with the sector’s premium to the market at historically high levels,” Deutsche Bank analyst Matt Garland said in a note. The rally has seen LVMH balloon in size, with its market value breaching the $500 billion level last month, becoming the first European company to hit that milestone.

Those gains have flown in the face of a broader economic slowdown, as investors have bet that Chinese shoppers will be keen to spend after emerging from one of the world’s strictest lockdowns. Last month, LVMH’s shares hit a record after reporting a surge in sales, while Hermès also saw quarterly sales jump as Chinese consumers snapped up its pricey scarves and Kelly handbags.

However, early warning signs have emerged, with LVMH noting that it is seeing a slowdown in US growth, while British fashion brand Burberry Group Plc said that it is seeing demand for sneakers and entry-level products softening among younger Americans.

Bernard Arnault's plan to build an exclusive luxury hotel on Rodeo Drive, Los Angeles' most famous shopping street, was scuppered after residents voted against the controversial development.

The boss of luxury goods conglomerate LVMH had hoped to build his first US Cheval Blanc hotel in Beverly Hills, adding to a portfolio of five sites in locations including Paris, the French Alps, and the Maldives. Plans for the Rodeo Drive hotel included 115 rooms with a ninth-story penthouse, private club, spa, shops, and three restaurants.

Arnault is the world's richest person, with an estimated net worth of $193 billion, per the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. The Financial Times reported that LVMH had spent nearly $2.9 million on its campaign to win the vote.

""If the final vote count confirms the voters' rejection of our project, we will respect the outcome, and will not bring the hotel project back in any form,"" a spokesperson for LVMH told Bloomberg.

City officials approved the hotel proposal last year, with only one of the city's five council members voting against the project, but a union representing hospitality workers in south California opposed the development and gathered enough signatures to trigger a public referendum.

The union argued that the development agreement didn't include information about local affordable housing for hotel workers. The hotel also attracted opposition from the group Residents Against Overdevelopment, which said the hotel — set to reach 115 feet at its tallest — was ""just too big and tall for our village"" and would lead to traffic and drain the city's services and infrastructure.

The 5.7-square-mile city, which has around 35,000 residents, is already home to 16 hotels. Masa Alkire, Beverly Hills' principal planner, told The Los Angeles Times when the hotel was first proposed more than three years ago that the Cheval Blanc ""is at the highest end, at a part of the market that maybe is not being met right now. This is supposed to be the upper echelon of hotels.""

LVMH had said that the hotel would generate around $780 million in tax revenues for Beverly Hills over the next three decades. Under the development agreement, it said that it would also contribute a one-off payment of $26 million to the city's budget for services like schools and policing and $2 million to arts and culture.

""The project was revised to address community input and ultimately received overwhelming support from Beverly Hills residents, businesses, and civic groups,"" supporters of the project said.

Just under a third of the city's 22,160 eligible voters had voted on the proposal as of Tuesday morning. The results were tight, but just under 51% of people have so far voted against the development on the two measures on the ballot. Some ballots are yet to be processed, The Los Angeles Times reported.

""It is a sad day for our city,"" Beverly Hills Mayor Julian Gold said, per The Los Angeles Times. ""While I respect the democratic process, I believe our community lost an incredible addition to Rodeo Drive that would have provided additional funding for vital city services.""

""I'm devastated,"" Andy Licht, chair of the Beverly Hills planning commission, told The Financial Times. ""It's a horrible decision.""

France's LVMH partners with Vallée de la Millière association - Fibre2fashion.com,"Wed, 31 May 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5maWJyZTJmYXNoaW9uLmNvbS9uZXdzL2Zhc2hpb24tbmV3cy9mcmFuY2Utcy1sdm1oLXBhcnRuZXJzLXdpdGgtdmFsbC1lLWRlLWxhLW1pbGxpLXJlLWFzc29jaWF0aW9uLTI4NzkxMy1uZXdzZGV0YWlscy5odG3SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"At the recent ChangeNOW summit, LVMH announced a partnership on biodiversity with the Vallée de la Millière association and aims to train all its employees in environmental challenges by 2026. LVMH highlighted several of its environmental policy commitments, including new ones in the area of employee training.

Located one hour from Paris on the edge of the Rambouillet forest, this 30-hectare site includes a reserve, an educational garden called “Jardin des Partages” built on the principles of agroforestry and permaculture, and several buildings designed to welcome the public.

This site is scheduled to open in 2024. As part of this partnership, the LVMH Group employees and stakeholders will be able to use this facility located in nature throughout the year, for training and awareness-raising activities. The aim is to have trained all group employees in environmental fundamentals by 2026, and to make each of them a player in change. The rest of the time, La Millière will be open to the general public, particularly schoolchildren, and scientists.

LVMH has made an announcement regarding a partnership on biodiversity with the Vallée de la Millière association. This partnership aims to address environmental challenges and promote biodiversity conservation. As part of its commitment to environmental sustainability, LVMH has set a goal to train all its employees in environmental challenges by 2026.

Through this partnership, LVMH intends to contribute to educating as many people as possible about the challenges of biodiversity. The group has committed to help renovate the site for the next five years, explore regenerative agriculture and train as many people as possible to ensure they are aware of ecological issues and the challenges around protecting biodiversity.

“We are very happy to support the Vallée de la Millière association. This reserve is an exciting laboratory for regenerative farming techniques and environmentally friendly practices that we are committed to developing in order to enable sustainable luxury. At LVMH, we are convinced that we can shift the lines from within – a conviction we share with Yann Arthus-Bertrand – by making our employees true stakeholders in our environmental policy. This is why we have made it a priority to integrate environmental issues into all the group’s businesses. To do this, training is key: it gives meaning and enables change. By 2026, we aim to have trained 100 per cent of our employees in environmental fundamentals, an objective that will now be included in our LIFE 360 roadmap.” Hélène Valade, director of environmental development for the LVMH Group.

“The Vallée de la Millière association was created to protect and conserve, at all costs, a 30-hectare estate in the heart of the Yvelines department on the outskirts of the Greater Paris region, a rare wetland area with a wealth of biodiversity. The objective is to be able to re-learn the living world around us. Without a long-term sponsor, we would not have been able to carry out this unprecedented pilot rewilding project, which could serve as an example and encourage others throughout France. Thanks to LVMH, the association will be able to welcome schools free of charge from 2024 to educate the youngest about the protection and beauty of wildlife, as well as scientists and NGOs to observe, exchange and analyze the evolution of the site. This support will also allow the association to acquire all the necessary equipment and to surround itself with a solid team to carry out its objectives of raising awareness and educating the general public as well as the daily management of the biodiversity reserve,” said Yann Arthus-Bertrand, photographer, filmmaker, and ecologist.

LVMH inaugurates its largest R&D center in Asia in Shanghai - Luxus Plus,"Wed, 10 May 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vbHV4dXMtcGx1cy5jb20vZW4vbHZtaC1pbmF1Z3VyYXRlcy1pdHMtbGFyZ2VzdC1yZC1jZW50ZXItaW4tYXNpYS1pbi1zaGFuZ2hhaS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"[vc_row njt-role=”people-in-the-roles” njt-role-user-roles=”administrator,editor,author,armember”][vc_column][vc_column_text]

The world’s leading luxury group has inaugurated its new research and development (R&D) center in Shanghai, its largest in Asia. The group will use cutting-edge technologies to develop perfumes and cosmetics, a market that is soaring in China.



LVMH is active in Asia. After the overhaul of its Beauty division and the appointment of former L’Oréal China CEO Stéphane Rinderknech as president and CEO of its perfumes and cosmetics department in March, the group unveiled its first major initiative in China: the opening last month of a Perfumes and Cosmetics Asia research and development (R&D) center in Shanghai.

Located on the outskirts of Shanghai, the R&D center is the group’s largest in Asia, covering more than 22,000 square meters. It is equipped with laboratories for developing skincare and make-up products, as well as rooms for testing products and a workshop area.

“The Chinese market is becoming more and more important, as is the Asian market. I think the world will be better off with the development of the Chinese market, and China will become stronger and stronger in its interaction with the world”, said Andrew Wu, president of LVMH Greater China, at the opening ceremony.

With a mission to “put down roots in Asia and China and create the world’s beauty”, the center will enable the group to gain insights into local beauty buyers. The move is also part of the group’s strategy to move its operations to the interior of the country.

State-of-the-art technology

The new center will use the latest cutting-edge technologies, including AI, to study the skin characteristics of Chinese consumers. It will bring together multidisciplinary knowledge to create skincare and beauty products that meet the needs of local consumers. In addition, it will work closely with LVMH’s R&D center in France to adapt new concepts locally.

For Chen Jing, R&D director of LVMH Beauty Asia Pacific, this is a promising sector. In 2019, the Chinese skincare market reached $35 billion, which is 4.43 times more than the makeup market. Now, according to Mintel, the skin care industry in China it is expected to exceed $60 billion by 2050.

LVMH’s beauty division still has a lot of growth potential, especially in China. The Cha Ling brand, which was part of the luxury conglomerate, closed its last store in China late last year. Currently, LVMH only has three major high-end skincare brands left in China – Fresh, Guerlain and Fenty whose market share is still relatively limited in the country.

Redoubling commitment

With Chinese consumers becoming increasingly knowledgeable about skin care products and their ingredients, leading beauty brands feel the need to double down on their R&D commitment to stay relevant to this market segment.

In 2021, Japanese conglomerate Shiseido launched its China Innovation Center in Shanghai’s Fengxian district to research and develop cutting-edge skin care technologies. Procter & Gamble, meanwhile, has committed to investing $100 million in its China Digital Innovation Center in Guangzhou over the next three years. In 2022, Estée Lauder also unveiled its new innovation labs in China to develop skin care and beauty products.

Setting up R&D centers in China is now a common practice for major beauty brands. These centers allow them to better meet the specific needs of Chinese consumers and to integrate into the country’s mature supply chain system. The battle for the perfumes and cosmetics market should therefore intensify in the coming years…

Shares in Hermes International slumped as much as 5%, while LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE dropped 4% and Gucci owner Kering SA saw its stock drop over 2%. The high-flying sector tumbled after Deutsche Bank AG analysts said a slowdown in the US is a growing concern.

While the rebound in Chinese demand has been among the key drivers of strong sales, investors will likely be picky from here on, they added.

“The luxury sector remains a crowded long for many investors, with the sector’s premium to the market at historically high levels,” Deutsche Bank analyst Matt Garland said in a note. “We expect performance to be driven more by earnings momentum and expect investors to become more selective.”Kering shares have gained 12% this year, while LVMH is up over 24% and Hermes has added 33%, all outperforming a 10% rise in the broader Stoxx Europe 600 Index."

Bernard Arnault, the world’s richest man , will scrap a plan to build a luxury hotel in Beverly Hills after residents in the wealthy city appeared to vote against the project.

“If the final vote count confirms the voters’ rejection of our project, we will respect the outcome, and will not bring the hotel project back in any form,” Miller said in the statement.

Arnault had planned to build an ultra-luxury boutique hotel and private members’ club on Rodeo Drive. Supporters of the hotel project had said taxes and other payments would generate about US$800 million over 30 years for Beverly Hills, while critics argued the building would obstruct views and contribute to traffic congestion.

The most recent tally showed 50.9 per cent of voters rejected the hotel project – a narrow 123-vote margin over the supporters. The final results will be certified on June 2, according to the Los Angeles County registrar’s office.

Through the appointment of de Pirey, LVMH said it would provide a more elevated customer experience and increase the efficiency of its supply chains.

Antonio Belloni, LVMH’s group managing director, said: “[Gonzague] has extensive experience in omnichannel businesses across industries and countries.

“As the leader of Sephora’s new venture, he has shown the ability to drive breakthrough initiatives for our customers and business. These assets will be key to accelerate the progress of maisons and regions in leveraging the power of technology and data.”

In April 2023, LVMH reported ""an excellent start to the year"" as revenue grew by 17% in the first quarter following ""a significant rebound"" in Asia as Covid restrictions eased.

There are still 135 votes that are yet to be processed, pending signature verification.

Additionally, mail-in votes will also need to be processed. The registrar will reveal the final results on June 2.

The labour union alleged that the hotel development agreement did not have a provision set aside for affordable housing.

It also said that the hotel would be too large for the community and would add to traffic congestion.

Another criticism against the hotel proposal was its height. As per the current zoning rules limit the height of the buildings to three or four storeys.

But the height of the proposed Cheval Blanc hotel would be nine-storeys.

An LVMH spokesperson Jessica Miller was quoted by Women’s Wear Daily as saying: “Although some votes remain to be counted, it now appears that Measures B and C have fallen short by a narrow margin, overturning the results of a comprehensive, years-long review and approval process.

“We are proud to have worked with so many residents, civic leaders and business owners who supported this once-in-a-generation investment that would have delivered hundreds of millions of dollars in city funding and a beautiful gateway project for the Golden Triangle. If the final vote count confirms the voters’ rejection of our project, we will respect the outcome, and will not bring the hotel project back in any form.”"
