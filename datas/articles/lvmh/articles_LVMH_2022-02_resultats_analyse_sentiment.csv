'Eco Responsibility' Reigns Among 20 Semifinalists for LVMH Prize - WWD,"Wed, 16 Feb 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3dkLmNvbS9mYXNoaW9uLW5ld3MvZGVzaWduZXItbHV4dXJ5L2x2bWgtcHJpemUtc2VtaWZpbmFsaXN0cy0yMDIyLTEyMzUwNzcwNDIv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The LVMH Prize for Young Designers is back in the fold as a live event during Paris Fashion Week, where a who’s who of the fashion establishment mingles with tomorrow’s most promising talents.

A showroom event on March 4 and 5 will bring together the 20 semifinalists for the ninth edition of the annual design competition, a diverse group of talents that share a zest for sustainably minded production, and a reticence to tether their designs to a designated gender.

Many of the contenders are already runway regulars in various fashion capitals, including Bluemarble by Anthony Alvarez, Weinsanto by Victor Weinsanto, S.S. Daley by Steven Stokey Daley, and Palomo Spain by Alejandro Gòmez Palomo, who was a semifinalist in the 2017 edition of the LVMH Prize.

Also vying for this year’s honor are Airei by Drew Curry; Amesh by Amesh Wijeskera, the first Sri Lankan designer on the roster; Ashlyn by Ashlynn Park; Chenpeng by Peng Chen; ERL by Eli Russell Linnetz, one of the brands grandfathered by Dover Street Market Paris; Goomheo by Goom Heo; Knwls by Charlotte Knowles and Alexandre Arsenault; Meryll Rogge; Niccolò Pasqualetti; Paula Canova del Vas; Róisín Pierce; Ryunosukeokazaki by Ryunosuke Okazaki; Tokyo James by Iniye Tokyo James; Winnie New York by Idris Balogun, and Yueqi Qi.

“They all combine such a fabulous diversity of creative talent, artisanal knowhow and technological audacity,” said Delphine Arnault, the force behind the initiative and a key talent scout at family-controlled luxury conglomerate LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton. “I was also impressed by their commitment on many issues relating to the future of our planet and our industry: they take into account environmental, local, social, ethical aspects….They are all very committed to making the world a better place and to helping our industry find solutions to these crucial questions.”

Arnault noted their widespread use of recycled materials, penchant for upcycling and preference for traditional and local knowhow, adding up to a heightened “eco responsibility.”

She also highlighted the “fluidity” of womenswear and menswear these days.

“In the past, womenswear designers made up the bulk of the selection. This year, we have seen a lot of menswear or genderless collections, and fewer collections exclusively for women. Many of the candidates this year are also developing several lines: menswear and genderless collections, womenswear and genderless collections, and sometimes even all three.”

She was referring to Linnetz, whose ERL brand is steeped in California cool, and also comes in children’s sizes.

“It’s exciting to see how the boundaries of fashion are constantly blurred: young designers are keen to bring together menswear and womenswear, to push back the boundaries between genders and to embrace a more inclusive wardrobe,” Arnault continued. “Gender, diversity, identity and equality are debates that drive society and the LVMH Prize places the spotlight on these questions.”

The executive detected savvy communications skills among the contenders.

“In addition to their creativity, all the semifinalists are very much aware of their image, have thought about their communication and know how to highlight their individuality: In this respect, Instagram has been a major actor in the change,” she explained. “The pandemic may have accelerated this, but I believe that the maturity of the semifinalists plays a big role in the way they express a personal, optimistic and committed vision.”

The LVMH Prize had largely pivoted to digital and remote formats during the pandemic. The 2022 edition will also be held digitally at LVMHprize.com and involve the general public. “From March 4 to 9, everyone will be able to discover the designers and vote for their favorite candidate,” LVMH said.

While a diverse bunch in terms of nationality, most of semifinalists for the 2022 edition are based in Europe, with four working out of Asia, four in North America and one in Africa. They hail from Belgium, Canada, China, France, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Nigeria, South Korea, Spain, the U.K. and the U.S.

The collections are split roughly equally between menswear, womenswear and genderless, while the aesthetics range from the familiar to the otherworldly.

Arnault also revealed a roster of new members of its committee experts, headlined by artist Cindy Sherman, famed for her disquieting self-portraits. Most of the other experts come from the content space, including magazine editors Ben Cobb of ES Magazine, Pierre M’Pele of GQ France, Mel Ottenberg of Interview Magazine, Eugénie Trochu of Vogue France, Instagram’s Eva Chen, podcaster Camille Charrière and stylist Julia Sarr-Jamois.

The 20 semifinalists are vying for a grand prize of 300,000 euros, plus a year of coaching from experts at LVMH, parent of brands including Louis Vuitton, Dior, Fendi, Givenchy, Loewe and Kenzo.

The Karl Lagerfeld Prize comes with 150,000 euros and a year of mentoring, while three students graduating in 2022 are to be awarded 10,000 euros each and a one-year placement in the design studio of an LVMH brand. Applications for the student prizes are open until March 15 on the prize website.

The LVMH Prize is open to designers under age 40 who have presented and sold at least two collections of women’s, men’s or genderless ready-to-wear.

It has previously been awarded to Nensi Dojaka, who won the 2021 edition; Thebe Magugu; Doublet; Marine Serre; Grace Wales Bonner; Marques’ Almeida, and Thomas Tait. It has also boosted the careers of its runner-up special-prize winners, which include Rokh, Jacquemus and Hood by Air.

A jury made up of LVMH’s famous creative directors will ultimately select the victors ahead of a prize ceremony later this year.

Has LVMH Turned Tiffany Around—Or Upside Down? - JCK,"Thu, 17 Feb 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmpja29ubGluZS5jb20vZWRpdG9yaWFsLWFydGljbGUvbHZtaC10dXJuZWQtdGlmZmFueS1hcm91bmQv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LVMH has done an incredible job reviving the Tiffany & Co. brand. Just ask it.

In a recent conference call, chairman Bernard Arnault was not shy about claiming credit for the retailer’s “remarkable” results since it purchased the company in January 2021. (The luxury conglomerate doesn’t provide specific results for its brands.)

In recent years, as the luxury sector has shown tremendous growth, “Tiffany stagnated,” Arnault announced. “Both profit and revenue were flat. … We were able to turn it around and bring it up to extremely high performance.”

Perhaps. Then again, the jewelry industry as a whole has underperformed the luxury sector for years. That is, until 2021—when it outperformed just about every category.

In fact, last year was so great for the jewelry biz, it would be remarkable if Tiffany didn’t do remarkably. While the new Tiffany team has undoubtedly worked hard at boosting the brand, we may have to wait for a more normal time before we can truly gauge the new team’s success. (The company declined to make an executive available for this story.)

So far, LVMH’s tenure has been wild and a little tumultuous. Some longtime vets have left—not just in the C-suites but a few levels down.

LVMH, meanwhile, is following its standard playbook and taking the brand upscale. Execs plan to focus on less on cheap silver, more on “high-end sparkling jewelry,” according to a Reuters report of a Tiffany town hall.

All of which has caused a huge culture shift—and sometimes culture clash. Not everyone believes the LVMH playbook will play here. While the brand has always had a high-toned image, it still carried a large amount of accessible product. In 2017, the Wall Street Journal reported that “45% of Tiffany’s sales last year came from jewelry categories with an average price of $530 or less.”

“[T]he magic of Tiffany’s lies in its ability to make the ordinary person feel extraordinary,” the Associated Press said in 1998, when the store sold playing-card decks for $12.50.

But now that’s changed.

“It used to be a very warm, open place,” says a former insider. “It’s become more exclusive. When you see the new store design in Boston, you wouldn’t think people would want to spend $200 in there.”

This person admits that, in the past, the brand may have needed more polish, but now says, “the question is, how far do you go with that?”

That points to LVMH’s difficult balancing act. Tiffany has traditionally attracted younger consumers with low-price-point designer silver jewelry. Those shoppers often become lifelong consumers.

It still hopes to attract a younger crowd—and also a richer one. That makes sense in markets like China, where young consumers spend more than their parents. But in America, being young often means being saddled with college debt, and some millennials frown on ostentation. And Tiffany has always been a very American brand.

In a Wall Street Journal article earlier this month, Alexandre Arnault, the brand’s executive vice president of product and communications (and Bernard’s son), denied that LVMH wanted to “de-Americanize” the company, noting that when it acquires a company—and it’s bought dozens—it tries to respect the brand’s DNA. Still, it was his father who said he wanted make Tiffany “a little bit French.”

To be fair, Tiffany has long looked abroad for inspiration. Its current CEO, Anthony Ledru, is its third European CEO in a row (excluding Mike Kowalski’s brief return). This is also not the first time the brand has tried to move upscale.

But the Arnaults have put their feet on the gas. Take its marketing. Tiffany has historically used celebrities in its ads. In 2017, it snagged Lady Gaga. Post-acquisition, LVMH has not only signed up Beyoncé and Jay-Z, but also Kim Kardashian, Pharrell, Rosé, Sarah Jessica Parker, Anya Taylor-Joy, Tracee Ellis Ross, and Eileen Gu.

Its new ads don’t just show off the celebrities’ talent, but their wealth. Pre-acquisition, A$AP Ferg and Elle Fanning danced to Moon River in their street clothes. (They probably weren’t cheap street clothes, but still.) Post-LVMH, Beyoncé sang the song in formal wear at a grand piano.

The ad frequency has changed too. Past Tiffany marketing decisions were slow and considered. Now, we see much more marketing, much more often.

That’s been both good and bad. The old regime handled the brand with extreme delicacy, like it was a piece of its famed crystal. But in the year that LVMH has run Tiffany, it has stumbled into an amazing list of controversies. There was the Beyoncé blood diamond kerfuffle. The backlash over “Not Your Mother’s Tiffany.” Jean-Michel Basquiat’s friends decrying its use of his artwork. Now, comes a new charge: Tiffany glasses worn by Pharrell are just copies of an old pair sold by Sotheby’s.

These flare-ups weren’t big blunders—more like tone-deaf goofs—and it’s arguable whether they deserved all the attention they got. But that’s quite a list.

None of this means doom. As this insightful piece explains, in the so-called attention economy, bad press can sometimes—though not always—be a boon. Brands generally don’t seek negative attention. But social media firestorms have become so frequent that they’re quickly forgotten, as Twitter hordes move to the next target of the day. Meanwhile, the brand’s profile gets a boost. Tiffany got a lot of press coverage in the past year, and, while a surprising amount of it was negative, it was still press.

So while Alexandre Arnault admitted the “Not Your Mother’s Tiffany” campaign caused a backlash, he added, “it also had people who had never thought of Tiffany talk about us, which I view as a good sign.”

Tiffany doesn’t seem to be deliberately courting controversy; it tries to stamp out these fires rather quickly. (It usually doesn’t even comment.) The Beyoncé diamond issue ended with “a source” saying the singer was “disappointed and angry” at the retailer—though, apparently, not disappointed or angry enough to walk away from her contract. “Not Your Mother’s Tiffany” was scrapped after less than two weeks.

“The brand is looked at with binoculars and sniper guns,” Arnault told the Journal. “It’s quite fascinating to see the level of engagement we have, either on the hate side or the love side.”

All this has increased the buzz around Tiffany. It wants to be talked about, and it is.

After a year, it’s clear that LVMH has boosted engagement, and, more importantly, investment. It has laid out a clear plan going forward, one it knows how to execute, and while some think that strategy might not be totally appropriate for Tiffany, at least it’s a plan.

Yet, when I speak to Tiffany vets and other onlookers, they note that, with a few exceptions, neither the product, nor the overall retail experience, has changed significantly. The ads might have said this is “not your mother’s Tiffany,” but for now, most moms would probably recognize the place.

“Changing the product and collection will be absolutely essential,” another former insider says. ”They will about need a good 18 months to get new product to market. Tiffany is a supertanker, it’s not a speed boat.”

LVMH “won’t get it right immediately,” this person adds. “But I’m optimistic about the long-term.”

LVMH Has Reportedly Had Talks About Acquiring Ralph Lauren - Complex,"Wed, 23 Feb 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNvbXBsZXguY29tL3N0eWxlL2EvdHJhY2V3aWxsaWFtY293ZW4vbHZtaC1oYXMtcmVwb3J0ZWRseS1oYWQtdGFsa3MtYWNxdWlyaW5nLXJhbHBoLWxhdXJlbtIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LVMH has reportedly had talks with Ralph Lauren about a potential “acquisition” of the brand.

This week, Axios cited multiple sources in a report claiming that the luxury conglomerate has had “exploratory discussions” about a merger, which would indeed go down as one of the biggest such deals in history. These alleged discussions, the report added, are said to have taken place over the past two years.

Sources cited in the report further claim that Ralph Lauren himself, who presently serves in a CCO and chairperson capacity, is considering succession plan options. Following the Axios report, a number of industry watchers have stepped up to praise the potential pairing, with Forbesamong those having shared detailed speculations on the possible deal. Meanwhile, LVMH last year announced the completion of its acquisition of Tiffany & Co., making word of these reported acquisition discussions even more enticing.

Complex has reached out to reps for both LVMH and Ralph Lauren for comment and will update this post accordingly.

Addressing the completion of the Tiffany acquisition last January, LVMH CEO Bernard Arnault predicted an acceleration of the brand’s growth and innovation. That same year, the brand received widespread media attention thanks to a multi-part campaign starring Beyoncé and Jay-Z, with many crediting the related success to Bernard’s son, Alexandre Arnault.

This year, LVMH’s investment division was revealed to have taken a minority stake in the Teddy Santis-founded Aimé Leon Dore. The latter was selected by Complex in 2021 as one of the best brands of the year.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9997361302375793}",neutral,0.9997361302375793,0
"Louis Vuitton Factory Workers in France Stage Walkout, Demand Higher Pay - The Business of Fashion","Sun, 13 Feb 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzb2ZmYXNoaW9uLmNvbS9uZXdzL2x1eHVyeS9sb3Vpcy12dWl0dG9uLWZhY3Rvcnktd29ya2Vycy1pbi1mcmFuY2Utc3RhZ2Utd2Fsa291dC1kZW1hbmQtaGlnaGVyLXBheS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Hundreds of workers in Louis Vuitton’s French factories staged a walkout on Thursday, Feb. 10, protesting low wages and working hours they say are difficult to juggle with personal and family life.

The work stoppages were organized by two labour unions, the French Democratic Confederation of Labour (CFDT) and the General Confederation of Labour (CGT).

The walkout occurred at four of the 18 factories owned by Louis Vuitton in France, with 330 workers participating, CGT said. An LVMH spokesperson said that 240 workers participated across three production facilities.

Employees are protesting changes to the working hours at Louis Vuitton’s workshops, including morning and evening shifts that make it hard to arrange for childcare, said Denis Bertonnier, a representative for Louis Vuitton employees in the CGT union. Workers were also protesting low wages and last-minute notice for schedule changes, he said.

Unions have been working since last fall to reach an agreement with Louis Vuitton, which is the biggest and most profitable unit of French luxury goods conglomerate LVMH-owned company. They’re threatening to strike in the coming week if the company does not meet their demands.

In a statement Monday, Louis Vuitton highlighted what it called an “advantageous” compensation policy including a recent salary hike of 150 euros per month and a reduction in working hours from 35 to 33 hours per week. “Louis Vuitton intends to calmly continue this dialogue to reach an agreement,” the company said.

Editor’s Note: This story was updated on 14 February 2022 to include a statement from LVMH and an interview with a CGT representative. A previous version of this story also cited Le Monde’s report that a fifth factory, in Saint-Donat-sur-l’Herbasse, participated in the initiative. CGT says workers at this site did not ultimately walk out.

Disclosure: LVMH is part of a group of investors who, together, hold a minority interest in The Business of Fashion. All investors have signed shareholders’ documentation guaranteeing BoF’s complete editorial independence.

LVMH Acquired Tiffany & Co. for $15.8 Billion — And Now They're Going After This Iconic Brand - Entrepreneur,"Wed, 23 Feb 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVudHJlcHJlbmV1ci5jb20vYnVzaW5lc3MtbmV3cy9sdm1oLWFjcXVpcmVkLXRpZmZhbnktY28tZm9yLTE1OC1iaWxsaW9uLWFuZC1ub3cvNDIwMTM00gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LVMH is on a mission to modernize some of the world's most luxurious brands.

Luxury giant LVMH is reportedly toying with the idea of a Ralph Lauren acquisition, according to news site Axios, which cited sources familiar with the matter.

Per Axios's sources, brand founder Ralph Lauren, who has headed the company since its 1967 launch and currently serves as chief creative officer and executive chairman, has begun to plan for his succession. The European-headquartered powerhouse and U.S. fashion retailer have reportedly been discussing a potential acquisition for the past couple of years.

LVMH's portfolio includes 75 different brands ranging from wines and spirits to leather goods and cosmetics, among them Louis Vuitton, Dior, Celine and Givenchy. The company also acquired jeweler Tiffany & Co. for $15.8 billion in January 2021, and since then, Alexandre Arnault, son of billionaire and LVMH CEO Bernard Arnault, has revamped the brand to attract younger buyers; Jay Z and Beyonce are its latest ambassadors.

LVMH will likely try to put a more modern spin on Ralph Lauren's image too. The company has already expanded its digital offerings, even launching a holiday-themed digital clothing collection on the metaverse in December. Additionally, while the company's sales struggled during the pandemic, reopenings and increased socialization (both of which translate to higher demand for ""going-out wear"") have helped with growth in recent quarters.

According to analysts, such cutting-edge tactics will be essential if Ralph Lauren wants to compete for the modern consumer. Earlier this month, GlobalData Retail managing director Neil Saunders lambasted the brand's ""fragmented nature"" in a note to clients, calling its holiday department store displays ""little short of abysmal.""

Analysts had expected revenue of US$69.2 billion.

LVMH SE posted record annual sales as well-heeled customers snapped up items ranging from Christian Dior couture to Hennessy cognac, cementing the group’s rebound from the depths of the pandemic.

The performance of the luxury giant, led by billionaire Bernard Arnault , exemplifies the V-shaped recovery experienced by much of the industry as wealthy customers rushed back to boutiques. The pace of the rebound was underpinned by recovering economies and soaring asset prices.

As the dominant purveyor of luxury goods, LVMH benefited from its range of products, from US$1,000 Louis Vuitton tattoo sneaker boots to Tiffany engagement rings . Organic revenue for its main fashion and leather goods division, which includes Celine and Loewe on top of Louis Vuitton, jumped 42 per cent from 2019 levels.

LVMH’s selective retail category, which includes Sephora and duty-free unit DFS, and the perfumes and cosmetics group, are the only two divisions that have yet to see sales match 2019 levels amid a subdued flow of Asian tourists to European capitals. During the virtual presentation before analysts and reporters, Arnault warned that international travel may not return before next year or 2024.

Tiffany, which joined the group a year ago , had a “remarkable” performance despite the brand’s flagship store on New York’s Fifth Avenue being closed for refurbishment, Arnault said. The store is set to reopen by the end of this year, he added.

Tiffany’s performance was a “very nice surprise, confirming the positive trend in jewellery already displayed by Richemont”, said Cedric Ozazman, chief investment officer at Reyl & Cie in Geneva.

“The beat was broad-based and despite all the issues linked to rising inflation costs, the group was able to post strong margins, thanks to its impressive pricing power,” he added.

Arnault said the group will be “reasonable” and “respect” its customers when it comes to potential product price increases. But he acknowledged some of the group’s products have pricing power, citing a special watch called the Nautilus launched by Tiffany and Patek Philippe with 170 pieces . Its retail price of US$52,635 was widely surpassed at auction and sold for over US$6.5 million last month. If needed, LVMH can “react” to inflation pressures, Arnault said.

LVMH will be “opportunistic” when it comes to mergers and acquisitions (M&A), Arnault said, adding he’s in no hurry to proceed with a major deal. The debt levels since Tiffany’s US$16 billion acquisition have gone down, standing at US$10.7 billion at the end of last year. UBS analysts led by Zuzanna Pusz estimate the group will have up to US$89 billion in M&A firepower by next year.

“Just about any deal is open to them, if the potential targets are willing to sell,” Bernstein analyst Luca Solca said. Arnault said the group he controls does strategic reviews of assets but sales of brands tend to be “marginal” moves.

LVMH is still grieving following the death of Virgil Abloh, the ground-breaking esigner who led Louis Vuitton menswear and who passed away in November from cancer at the age of 41, the billionaire added. Arnault declined to say when a successor would be announced for the exclusive name which is “a culture brand”, not just a fashion brand, Arnault said.

Abloh was widely lauded for his creativity which spanned streetwear, high-fashion, architecture and design in general. Arnault mentioned the brand’s show held on January 20 in Paris for menswear week, which featured a live orchestra led by the director Gustavo Dudamel. Abloh “was a creative genius”, Arnault said.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9999982118606567}",positive,0.9999982118606567,1

Why an LVMH-Ralph Lauren Deal Is Unlikely - The Business of Fashion,"Fri, 25 Feb 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzb2ZmYXNoaW9uLmNvbS9icmllZmluZ3MvbHV4dXJ5L3doeS1hbi1sdm1oLXJhbHBoLWxhdXJlbi1kZWFsLWlzLXVubGlrZWx5L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Could LVMH really be thinking about acquiring Ralph Lauren?

This week, an Axios report, based on anonymous sourcing, speculated that the French luxury conglomerate and American brand, whose eponymous founder remains its largest shareholder, have recently been in talks. (A representative for LVMH declined to comment on the report. A representative for Ralph Lauren said that the company does not comment on rumours.)

The story generated plenty of conversation: the luxury industry remains in rapid consolidation mode, and LVMH has shown that it is keen on buying billion-dollar-plus businesses to further cement its dominant position as the global market leader. (At the end of 2019, it scooped up the American jeweller Tiffany for $16.2 billion, the largest deal in its history.)

Ralph Lauren, which generated $4.4 billion in the fiscal year ending March 27, 2021, has seen sales soar as pent-up demand benefitted fashion brands across the board. Last spring, sales in North America, its largest market, were up 301 percent year over year.

This isn’t the first time there’s been speculation about a potential Ralph Lauren sale. LVMH rival Kering has also been rumoured to have looked at the company.

The reasons why are clear: the Ralph Lauren brand itself remains strong, even in the US, where it is heavily distributed.

“When asked to name ‘luxury clothing brands,’ Ralph Lauren is always in the top-10, usually in the top five,” said Robert Passikoff, founder and president of Brand Keys, which surveys consumers about brand sentiment. A February 2022 Prosper Insights survey of almost 8,000 American consumers also found that nearly 11 percent had purchased something from Ralph Lauren over the past six months, up from 9.5 percent in 2021. Among 1,500 “fashion forward” customers, 19 percent bought something from the brand over the past half year.

LVMH has had plenty of success in the US market with its European heritage brands like Louis Vuitton and Dior, but not with more accessible, American-born brands including Donna Karan International, which it bought in 2000 and sold 16 years later after failing to turn it into a powerhouse. Its other major American fashion label, Marc Jacobs, was once on its way to billion-dollar status — pegged at the next Michael Kors, with talks of a potential IPO spin off. But after shutting down the contemporary, department store-reliant Marc by Marc Jacobs label in 2015, it underwent a major reset, only recently experiencing a new wave of success thanks, in part, to the popularity of its lower-priced Heaven collection.

But there are also some curious particularities that make a Ralph Lauren deal with a major French luxury conglomerate unlikely. For one, Ralph Lauren, the company’s 82-year-old executive chairman and chief creative officer, has never communicated a clear succession plan, nor has he ever communicated any interest in selling.

Another problem is that Ralph Lauren is fundamentally a different fashion business than the ones LVMH currently operates.

It starts with history. American fashion brands were built in a different way than European ones. Instead of being rooted in couture — which is all about originality, attention to detail and quality — they stem from the 7th Avenue rag trade, where the main business was making clothes cheaply and quickly, with a heavy sheen of marketing.

Ralph Lauren’s genius is in his cinematic world-building abilities, which he began in 1967 with a rack of ties. His aesthetic draws as much from New England preppiness as it does the English countryside and French aristocratic style, and now encompasses everything from home goods to kid’s clothing. But a significant amount of its products are sold in the off-price market. Out of 239 directly owned stores in North America, 195 — or 81.6 percent — are Polo Factory stores. In Europe, 63 percent are outlets.

Why is this such a sticking point? You can certainly find LVMH products at stores like TJ Maxx on occasion, and the group runs its own network of outlet stores. But most Ralph Lauren clothes, home goods and accessories are priced in the mid-range, not at the high end, which means the profit margins are often far lower no matter if they are discounted or not.

What’s more, despite its strong reputation, Ralph Lauren has not managed to play seriously in luxury fashion outside of men’s suiting. Its leather goods in particular — bread and butter for most big houses — are not held in the same regard as Dior, Gucci or Saint Laurent. While a large swath of consumers are happy to buy a $95 polo shirt from the brand — especially when it’s on sale — it is not a go-to label for four-figure handbags.

The company has made strides on these fronts over the past few years while enacting its turnaround effort, exiting lower-brow retailers like Kohl’s and decreasing its reliance on the off-price market. Still, Ralph Lauren might be a better target for Capri, which owns Michael Kors, or PVH, which owns Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger. They have a more similar distribution strategy and pricing architecture.

However, these might not be as attractive acquirers to Lauren. Selling to a prestigious group like Kering or LVMH would be seen as a “crowning achievement,” as Axios put it, and secure his family’s fortune.

He can, after all, choose to do nothing, as long as he continues to satisfy shareholders.

The rainforest and the runway may seem worlds apart, but deforestation in the Amazon is partly fueled by something that’s on display in every fashion capital this month: leather. A New York Times investigation published in November established the connection between deforestation and American appetites for leather in luxury cars, but the problem goes beyond the auto industry.

Fashion’s extensive use of leather is contributing too, according to a study released late last year that looked at the connection between the leather in our wardrobes and deforestation. Most of that leather comes from cattle, and rainforest in the Brazilian Amazon is increasingly being slashed and burned to create more grazing space.

Exactly how much of the fashion industry’s leather comes from Brazil is difficult to pinpoint, but according to UN Comtrade, a trade statistics database, Brazil accounted for 19 percent of tanned leather exports globally in 2020; those exports accounted for 41 percent of China’s tanned leather imports and 36 percent of Italy’s. Both countries are production centers for the fashion world.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9977238774299622}",neutral,0.9977238774299622,0

Twenty emerging designers were selected for the semifinals in the ninth edition of the contest, including Peng Chen and Yueqi Qi of China. If either artist makes the final cut, it will mark the first time a Chinese designer is awarded the prize.

The LVMH Prize announced the selection of 20 young designers. They will present their collections at a showroom in Paris and on https://t.co/llfMW5rRy2 where experts and the general public will vote for the 8 finalists.

In control of 75 prestigious brands, or Houses as they’re also called, such as Louis Vuitton, Christian Dior, Fendi, and Givenchy, the multinational corporation has organized the LVMH Prize annually since 2013.

According to the LVMH website, the winners are selected for their “fresh talent that is essential to the vitality and diversity of the fashion ecosystem.”

The winner is awarded a one-year mentorship and a cash prize of 300,000 EUR (about 341,085 USD). A second designer will be awarded the Karl Lagerfeld prize of 150,000 EUR (approximately 169,872 USD) and one-year mentorship.

So who are the young Chinese talents selected by LVMH this year?

Peng Chen

Chen launched his London-based unisex fashion brand CHENPENG in 2015 after graduating from the London College of Fashion with a master’s degree in menswear fashion design technology.

He quickly became one of the leading young designers in China, with more than 100 outlets selling his brand worldwide.

Chen’s collections focus on seasonal outerwear, with eclectic puffer coats as the centerpiece. His designs follow the notion of ‘one-size fashion’ in an inclusive attempt to represent different body sizes.

As if being an LVMH finalist wasn’t prestigious enough, Chen’s pieces were also featured in the 2022 Beijing Olympics opening ceremony.

Yueqi Qi

Qi graduated in knitwear from Central Saint Martins in 2018 and founded her namesake brand one year later.

According to her website, Qi’s first collection debuted at Shanghai Fashion Week Spring/Summer 2020.

Recently, she has collaborated with Gucci for Gucci Vault and dressed young celebrities like Eileen Gu and Zhong Feifei for Vogue China editorial shooting.

Qi is experienced in knitwear and beadwork, and she focuses on the mutation and creolization of Chinese tradition.

“I think it’s interesting how various elements of culture can be emulsified in time,” she said in a recent interview.

The 20 semifinalists will present their collections in Paris on March 4 and 5. The event will be held digitally simultaneously, and everyone will be able to discover the designers and vote for their favorite from March 4 to 9 on the dedicated website.

The eight finalists will be determined by votes from both experts and the general public.

Feb 7, 2022

Barely a year after being bought by the world's number one luxury group, Tiffany & Co. is turning out to be a strategic asset for . CEO opened the presentation of LVMH’s annual results by stating that “the highlight of the year was the incorporation of Tiffany.” The iconic US jewellery brand was bought by LVMH at the end of 2020, and was incorporated in the group’s financial results in 2021. It was a record-breaking year for Tiffany, enabling LVMH’s watches & jewellery division to multiply its sales by a factor of 2.7, growing from €3.35 billion in 2020 to €8.96 billion a year later.







The famous Tiffany diamond worn by Beyoncé in the 'About Love' ad campaign - Tiffany & Co.



The division, which previously lagged behind the fashion & leather goods, selective distribution, perfumes & cosmetics and wines & spirits divisions, has now risen to third place in the ranking. In 2021, it recorded a 40% organic growth (and a 7% one on its pre-pandemic 2019 result), while recurring operating income skyrocketed, growing by 200% (and by 128% over 2019) and reaching €1.6 billion, thanks to the contribution of Tiffany & Co., which was not included in the consolidated results for 2020.



It was a year of record-breaking growth for Tiffany & Co., at a time when “its flagship in New York, [the brand’s] premier store worldwide with a revenue of several hundred million [dollars], was closed for refurbishments for the entire year. Yet [Tiffany & Co.] has handsomely beaten its absolute records for both revenue and profitability,” said Arnault.

LVMH's group CFO Jean-Jacques Guiony indicated, during the conference for the publication of the group's annual results, that Tiffany & Co. generated “an operating income of over $900 million (€796 million) last year. That was usually the value of EBITDA, but it was instead its EBIT, a remarkable performance indeed.” Tiffany's contribution enabled LVMH to more than double its recurring operating income in 2021, to a value of €17.15 billion, equivalent to a 107% increase over 2020 and a 49% one over 2019.



Besides the products, “which lie at the root of Tiffany’s success,” Arnault ascribed this outcome to various other factors. The first were the changes made to Tiffany & Co.’s senior management in the wake of the acquisition, when two veterans took charge: (former CEO of Louis Vuitton) was appointed non-executive chairman of Tiffany's board, while the CEO post was handed to Anthony Ledru, until then executive vice-president of global commercial activities at Louis Vuitton. Bernard Arnault also appointed his son Alexandre, previously in charge of luggage brand Rimowa, as executive vice-president products and communications of Tiffany & Co.







LVMH generated an exceptional cash flow in 2021 - LVMH



“After [the acquisition], we have been able to introduce [at Tiffany] a management team we are well acquainted with, experienced both in this business and in the group. An energetic team of professionals who have a feel for the products, their promotion and their distribution,” added Arnault, who acknowledged the acquisition was made at a time that was propitious for LVMH, since Tiffany was not in top form. “During a period, up until the end of 2019, when the luxury sector enjoyed very strong and quite generalised growth, Tiffany languished. Over nearly five years, revenue remained flat, and so did profits,” said Arnault.



Another key factor of Tiffany & Co.’s 2021 success was its advertising, which marked a complete break with the past, putting a strong emphasis on social media and celebrities. The ‘About Love’ institutional campaign, starring pop singer and global celebrity Beyoncé and her husband Jay Z, “was a global success, exerting a huge pull on young consumers,” said Arnault.



LVMH bought Tiffany & Co. for a little less than $16 billion (€13.4 billion). A sum that, within a year, has been recovered almost in full by the group, thanks to the treasure trove it was able to generate with a cash flow of €13.5 billion - the previous record was €6.2 billion in 2019. “In 2021, we invested €13.3 billion, almost entirely to acquire Tiffany. We generated an available operating cash flow of €13.5 billion. Pushing the argument further, I could say that, in a year, Tiffany’s acquisition has been paid for. This isn’t entirely the case, since we also put [the money] to other uses, but it is nevertheless a very telling fact,” said Guiony.



“Everyone told us the [the acquisition] was expensive. But I actually believe it wasn’t so expensive. Perhaps this is why Mr Guiony has been able to offset the cost so quickly. Not forgetting of course the results we achieved. I think that, if Tiffany was still a listed company, it would now be worth twice as much,” said a grinning Arnault, acknowledging that he “was doubtlessly exaggerating.” But he concluded by saying that “we made an excellent acquisition for the group.”","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9917454123497009}",positive,0.9917454123497009,1

If a deal were to be brokered, this M&A would be one of the largest in the apparel industry.

French luxury conglomerate LVMH is rumoured to buyout American fashion brand Ralph Lauren.

According to news site Axio, LVMH conducted discussions regarding the possible acquisition of Ralph Laurent over the past two years and if the deal proceeds, it is touted to be one of the largest in the industry. Just last year, in January, LVMH bought over Tiffany & Co., for US$15.8 billion.

Ralph Laurent himself founded the US brand in 1967, and through the years, it has become one of the top luxury fashion companies in the country. Currently, Laurent holds the position of Chief Creative Officer and Executive Chairman. At age 82, he is now considering a succession plan option.

Being the parent company of major fashion brands like Louis Vuitton, Christian Dior, Celine and Fendi, LVMH can lead Ralph Laurent. The adding of Tiffany and its smooth transition boosted the confidence of the French luxury giant. Since the takeover and under the leadership of Alexandre Arnault, the American jeweller had undergone a significant rebrand designed to attract younger shoppers.

Financially, the New York-based company was hit hard by the pandemic, but its recent sales results have seen improvement as the world slowly reopens. The demand for clothes grew with the return of socialisation. Ralph Laurent has been expanding its reach to the younger audience as well. Ralph Lauren launched new digital services such as the holiday-themed digital clothing collection on the Metaverse to appeal to digital natives.

An article by Forbes mentioned that Ralph Laurent “sells for a multiple of EBITDA of less than 9x while LVMH sells for just under 16x”. Including Ralph Laurent’s earnings to LVMH will only increase the latter’s stock prices, which means the acquisition will be an accretive deal.

Should a deal come into fruition, it would further cement LVMH’s position within the US market. It has already started to make inroads into this crucial market through Tiffany, and adding Ralph Laurent will allow LVMH to take point into two critical categories: Jewellery and Fashion. This will propel the group’s position further up compared to its competitors like Kering and Richemont.

Bernard Arnault, Europe’s richest man, saw his net worth drop by $5 billion as investors reduced their holdings in LVMH stock.

At the end of its 2021 fiscal year, the luxury group had recorded sales to the tune of 64.2 billion euros, up +44% from a 2020 year marked by the Covid-19 crisis and +20% from 2019.

However, on January 5, LVMH shares had reached an all-time high of €758.50, but have since fallen by around 6%.

At the same time, Louis Vuitton, has suffered a wind of protest this Thursday, February 10 in 5 of the 18 factories of the brand in France. Employees stopped work during the changeover between the morning and evening shifts. They denounce their working hours and their wages. The CFDT union says it is opposed to the “annualization of working hours” that management “wants to impose” and which would lead “in particular to the payment of overtime at the end of the year”. In addition, the elected representatives are “demanding a salary increase”, recalling that “the rate of pay for overtime has been reduced by a few years“. recalling that “the hourly rate for a Louis Vuitton employee with fifteen years of seniority” is “14 euros“.

According to Axios, the parent company of Louis Vuitton, Christian Dior, Tiffany & Co., and more has held “exploratory conversations” over the past several years to discuss a buyout of the American brand. Sources say the namesake founder, chairman, and chief creative officer could see the acquisition as his “crowning achievement” and the solution for his succession plan for a future that doesn’t involve Ralph Lauren himself.

Ralph Lauren’s current worth is just under $8 billion, and this acquisition would be one of the largest of all-time in the apparel industry. Just last year, LVMH completed its acquisition of Tiffany & Co. in a deal worth $15.8 billion, and sources told Axios that the immediate success of the jewelry brand has made the conglomerate more confident acquiring another from the U.S. market.

Is America the new frontier of luxury? — Few luxury brands are left for the taking in Europe after decades of competition between LVMH, the most valuable company on the entire continent, and its nearest rival, Kering. Gucci, Balenciaga, Yves Saint Laurent, and Bottega Veneta are all owned by Kering, while LVMH lays claim to Givenchy, Fendi, Loewe, Off-White, and Rimowa in addition to the houses listed up top.

With little room for corporate reshuffling in Europe, America may just become the new battleground for the luxury giants. Ralph Lauren was hit hard by the recent unstable economy and offloaded Club Monaco last year in an effort to go smaller, but prosperity is once again returning based on earnings reports for Q3 2021.

Revenue for the quarter was higher than predicted and greater than during the same period pre-COVID in 2020.

Speaking at the publication of 's record-breaking 2021 results, was barely able to hide his satisfaction, and proved to be especially talkative. On Friday January 27, the French luxury giant’s boss notably expressed his opinion on a number of topics that are crucial for his empire, and for the luxury market, during this post-pandemic recovery period. What follows is Arnault’s handbook for 2022.







Bernard Arnault - LVMH



The economy



If the economy will continue to perform as it did in January, 2022 is set to proceed in the best of fashion according to Arnault, who nevertheless called for vigilance with regards to inflation. “Opinions differ on [inflation]. Some are pessimistic about it, others regard it as a transitory phenomenon,” he said. Arnault is inclined to think that the price rises in raw materials and energy are simply cyclical.

“The post-pandemic recovery has caused a global bottleneck. Once it will be absorbed, markets will return to a normal state of affairs. Our group is used to weathering economic crises, but I do not predict such a crisis this year. We have an advantage over other [groups], since there is some flexibility built into our prices. We have the means to react to inflationary pressures. Otherwise, I believe demand for our products will continue to be strong,” said Arnault.



Acquisitions



At €13.5 billion, LVMH’s available operating cash-flow for 2021 was more than twice what it was in 2020 and 2019. The group, which bought Tiffany & Co. at the end of 2020 for €13.4 billion, is in extremely sound financial health, and could easily embark on new operations, now that the luxury market is looking extremely attractive in the wake of the pandemic. LVMH added a new name to its 75-label galaxy in October, when it bought French cosmetics brand L’Officine Universelle Buly, as Arnault mentioned.



He was however cagey about the possibility of carrying out new acquisitions this year, saying that “We mustn’t rush into anything. We never do. We have plenty of time. They say we carry out a great deal of acquisitions, but we’ve only done a handful. We recently made a major one with Tiffany, which is almost fully paid for already. Fantastic! Should we come across another [opportunity], why not? To make good acquisitions, one must not necessarily hunt for them, one must be opportunistic.”



Divestments



“Of course, we do assess our companies. We try to analyse, understand and develop them. From time to time, we regard some of them as too small, or not quite suitable, and we jettison them. But it’s an absolutely marginal phenomenon. It's only happened two or three times,” said Arnault, underlining once more the need for patience: “It won't happen in a rush. One must be patient, hold one's nerve, let time do the work in order to find the ideal fit. If, after long deliberations, we are no longer convinced, only then do we draw our conclusions.”



Virgil Abloh



The African-American designer’s death from cancer at the age of 41 on November 28 2021 raised the issue of his succession at the head of menswear for , the group’s flagship label whose men's collections Abloh had been in charge of since March 2018. Asked about this during the press conference, Arnault replied as follows: “We are extremely sad. No one expected he would pass away so quickly. It was a tragedy. [Abloh] was an extraordinarily powerful designer. He was more than a fashion designer, he was a man of culture. We are still grieving for him, and I will talk about his succession once the mourning period is over.”



Duty-free retail and the parallel market



With regards to duty-free retail, Arnault was surprisingly outspoken: “It's true that our perfumes and cosmetics division is much less strong than those of other groups, in terms of revenue. But this is intentional. Why? You’ll notice that a number of groups state that part of their retail revenue is generated duty-free. This is questionable, since their stores appear empty of customers. We can explain how this happens through duty-free retail. Products are sold, but not through regular stores. They are shipped from the stores’ cellars to distributors in China, who then sell them at hefty discounts, with an extremely negative impact on brand image. In the long-term, it’s very bad practice. We refuse to adopt it, and the same goes for . At least two of us aren’t going for this. We want to preserve our labels’ brand image in the long term.”



The metaverse



“The metaverse is an exclusively virtual world. We exist in the real world, and we sell real products. Of course, [the metaverse] is interesting and very amusing. We shall have to see what its practical use will be. Undoubtedly, if done consistently with a brand’s activity, it could have a positive impact, but our goal isn't selling virtual sneakers for €10 a pair. Yet, working in the metaverse might be interesting. It’s early days still. Which apps, which versions of the metaverse will gain traction? We are looking into it. Having said this, we must also be wary of bubble effects,” said Arnault.



Pricing policies



“In terms of pricing policies, we try to keep a balance. Our products’ prices allow us to earn entirely suitable margins. But we also have a responsibility towards customers. We don’t want to give the impression that we could reach values that are inconsistent with the economic reality of product prices. One must be reasonable,” concluded Arnault.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9876525402069092}",neutral,0.9876525402069092,0

Louis Vuitton’s price increases will affect the brand’s stores around the world and include leather goods, fashion accessories and perfumes, the spokesperson told Reuters Tuesday (Feb. 15). She said the price increases will vary depending on the product.

“The price adjustment takes into account changes in production costs, raw materials, transportation as well as inflation,” the label said in a statement to Reuters.

Some bloggers in China, who didn’t cite any sources, said some handbags, including Capucines and Neverfull, will go up 20% or more from today’s cost of 46,500 yuan ($7,323) and 12,000 yuan ($1,890), respectively, in China, the report says.

Luxury market tracking site PurseBop cited speculation that the increase would be between around 4% to 15-18%.

LVMH CEO Bernard Arnault said last month that the company would have to be “reasonable” if it were to raise its prices.

Last year, Chanel increased prices on some of its handbags three times, including a $3,000 jump for the Classic Flap Bag to about $8,200, up 60% from its 2019 price.

Arnault said during the company’s fourth-quarter earnings call in late January that the company needs to tread lightly before entering Web 3, saying the metaverse is a potential business opportunity for LVMH, but cautions “we … have to be wary of bubbles,” according to a transcript of the call.

“[W]e are very much in a down-to-earth world,” he said. “We want real product selling for real … we are not interested in selling a pair of virtual sneakers for 10 euros. At the beginning of the internet … there were all sorts of things cropping up … And that was a bubble that burst.”

There could still be some relevant applications for the metaverse in LVMH’s business plan, but it will take time to see if they could be profitable, said Arnault, according to the transcript. He looks at the metaverse as “thought-provoking,” he said.

Louis Vuitton is increasing its prices globally on Wednesday as production costs surge, according to a Reuters report.

Prices will increase across the French luxury brand’s leather goods, fashion accessories and perfumes, a spokesperson for Louis Vuitton in China told Reuters. The spokesperson did not disclose how much the prices would increase, but noted that it would vary depending on the product. Louis Vuitton did not immediately respond to requests for comment by Vogue Business.

Louis Vuitton boosts exotic skins and ultra-luxury handbag production - Vogue Business,"Wed, 23 Feb 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZvZ3VlYnVzaW5lc3MuY29tL2Zhc2hpb24vbG91aXMtdnVpdHRvbi1kZWRpY2F0ZXMtbW9yZS1wcm9kdWN0aW9uLXRvLXVsdHJhLWx1eHVyeS1oYW5kYmFnc9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"To receive the Vogue Business newsletter, sign up here.

Following global price increases, Louis Vuitton is increasing its capacity to produce ultra high-end handbags, ramping up competition with Hermès.

On Tuesday, the French house inaugurated two ateliers, the Abbaye atelier in Vendôme and the Oratoire atelier (described by Louis Vuitton as the “next generation of ateliers” with its bioclimatic design and modular architecture) in Azé, both south of Paris. Bernard Arnault, chairman and CEO of LVMH; Bruno Le Maire, France’s minister of economy, finance and the recovery; Michael Burke, chairman and CEO of Louis Vuitton; and Frédéric Arnault, the CEO of Tag Heuer and son of Bernard Arnault cut the ribbon with artisans, journalists and local authorities in attendance. The Abbaye Vendôme began operating in 2020 and the Oratoire atelier in 2021, currently employing around 150 artisans with plans to hire another 250, plus 100 persons in other metiers.

Exotic skins in luxury have become a lightning rod for criticism as alternative leathers and other vegan materials become more popular. Burke said that demand for handbags in exotic skin “done in a responsible way” is increasing. “It goes with more bespoke orders. The great majority of exotic skins [handbags] are bespoke. It’s not about price, it’s about bespoke, of course bespoke is expensive,” Burke told Vogue Business. Louis Vuitton's crocodile skins come from farms certified by the Crocodile Standard, a certification launched by LVMH. Louis Vuitton is also one of the last remaining luxury brands to still sell animal fur.

Earlier this month, Louis Vuitton raised its prices globally, attributed to increased production costs, a move that followed Chanel’s, and at a time when most luxury players are raising their prices. Asked by Vogue Business if any further price increases were planned for this year, Burke just replied, “Stay tuned.”

Read More LVMH annual fashion sales surge 47 per cent on US, China The luxury conglomerate’s fashion and leather goods division spiked last year despite ongoing pandemic disruptions. CEO Bernard Arnault discussed the metaverse opportunity, acquisitions and what’s next at Louis Vuitton.

“It's a bag that I could never afford but it doesn't matter, as long as it creates jobs in France,” Le Maire told Vogue Business while holding an emerald green Capucines handbag made of crocodile, priced around €25,000 according to Burke.

2021 was a record year for Louis Vuitton. According to the latest HBSC estimates, the house generated €17 billion in revenue (LVMH does not break out sales on the brand level). Two additional leather workshops are slated to open in France this year. In the context of a luxury boom in the US and a sustained demand in Asia, waitlists for Louis Vuitton’s iconic handbags are getting longer. Abbaye and Oratoire join two other existing sites producing handbags made of exotic skins (the historic atelier in Asnières and the Issoudun site). Louis Vuitton now counts 18 ateliers in France, three in the US , five in Spain and two in Italy. Some 1,000 jobs are to be created by 2024. LVMH currently employs 35,000 in France. “We are proud to contribute to the economy of the country and its influence around the world,” Arnault said.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9998759031295776}",neutral,0.9998759031295776,0

Woodinville Whiskey & LVMH Emphasize Brand through Quincy Expansion￼ - The Registry,"Tue, 01 Feb 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vbmV3cy50aGVyZWdpc3RyeXBzLmNvbS93b29kaW52aWxsZS13aGlza2V5LWx2bWgtZW1waGFzaXplLWJyYW5kLXRocm91Z2gtcXVpbmN5LWV4cGFuc2lvbi_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"By Bekka Wiedenmeyer

Woodinville Whiskey, a dream turned reality by founders Orlin Sorensen and Brett Carlile, has found a second home nearly three hours east of Seattle in Quincy, Washington. The craft whiskey distillery, which was founded in 2010, currently has primary residence in Woodinville, a city just northeast of Seattle and part of the greater metropolitan area. With the help of a project team led by Seattle-based architecture firm Graham Baba Architects, the dream is now expanding with a multiphase plan that includes a processing and bottling building and multiple barrel rickhouses for aging.

“It’s a different type of project than we work on a lot, the industrial nature of it,” said Andy Brown, design and project architect at Graham Baba. “There was a lot of complexity and a lot of things that were behind the scenes that you don’t necessarily see in the architecture, but in the end, it was a pretty rewarding project for us. [It was] great partnering with Woodinville Whiskey because they really just committed to the vision. It’s always nice to work with clients like that.”

This is not the first time Graham Baba has worked with Woodinville Whiskey on a project. Previously, Graham Baba partnered with developers on the original Woodinville site where the distillery is headquartered, with Woodinville Whiskey in mind as the primary tenant. When Woodinville Whiskey was acquired by Moët Hennessy USA in 2017, formally joining the LVMH family, the need grew for expanded facilities.

“It’s a big international luxury goods brand and we were excited that there was a lot of momentum,” Brown said. “This is just an important project for them and for the bigger brand.”

Graham Baba Architects is the architect of record for the project, led by co-founder Brett Baba, design and project manager Susan Tillack, and Brown. Washington-based firm AHBL provided landscape architecture services, JSL Engineering served as civil and structural engineer and Rimmer & Roeter acted as contractor.

The new facilities are located on 10 acres of land in Quincy that originally belonged to the Omlin Family Farm, which exclusively grows the grain for Woodinville Whiskey. The client, Woodinville Whiskey and LVMH, were excited to see how the project team could design and incorporate such elements of the Woodinville Whiskey brand in the expansion.

“They really trusted us from the beginning,” Brown said. “Their building in Woodinville has become such an important part of their brand, like an illustration of that building is on their label for bottled whiskey they sell, and so that building has become very important to them. There was a lot of trust pretty early on in the conceptual design phase as we were looking at options for Quincy… The parent company LVMH was also very excited about what we were able to bring to what would otherwise be fairly industrial buildings.”

Brown mentioned that this is something in which Brett Baba, partner in charge, has been interested for a long time.

“How can you take these somewhat generic, often not particularly interesting prefabricated metal buildings and through some small, subtle but important design codes, make them into interesting architecture?” Brown said.

The buildings, which range from 40 to 70 feet wide and 400 feet long, are clad in dark metal siding and Kebony wood, and leverage the cost-effectiveness of prefabricated metal buildings with the deep brown tones of bourbon. Kebony wood is a processed wood product with high durability, which Brown said is important for an industrial site such as this, and invokes the warmth of the Woodinville Whiskey label. The team also incorporated wood and rusted steel elements at the front door and loading bays, as well as Corten-clad sliding barn doors on the barrel rickhouses.

“The original distillery building certainly took a lot of cues from agrarian architectural styles,” Brown said. “The Woodinville Whiskey building was wood frame, had a lot of wood involved in the exterior and interior of the building. These buildings in Quincy, we knew we were going to prefab metal buildings. But we still wanted to bring some of those ties in… those elements warm it up but also are reminiscent of those deep red brown tones that you get with bourbon, which we thought was nice to offset the fairly dark standing seam metal that picks up the bulk of the exterior of the buildings.”

Some elements of the Woodinville distillery that were demolished to create more distilling space have been repurposed and incorporated into the design of the Quincy expansion. The team salvaged a mezzanine featuring Douglas fir stairs and steel railings, originally designed by Graham Baba, and once they found out there was space for a mezzanine in the expansion, they knew they had to reuse the materials. Not only was reusing more cost effective, but Brown also said it was a nicer alternative than using stock materials that still would have been more expensive.

“We do a lot of adaptive reuse projects where we’re taking old buildings, doing new things with them,” Brown said. “We’re always thinking about how we can salvage things and repurpose and reuse.”

The steel stringer for the stair also features more than 100 written signatures from an anniversary celebration by early supporters of the Woodinville Whiskey brand, another reason for the team to reuse it in the Quincy expansion.

The entry of the process building is covered by a canopy that is designed to “peel away” from the building, revealing a Corten-clad inner core and an off-center pivot door. Brown emphasized this feature as one of the team’s prouder accomplishments during the design.

“It’s cool expressing the interior of the building on the exterior,” Brown said. “It’s an interesting design and something you don’t see with these prefab steel buildings all that often… The standing seam siding that is the roof and then becomes the siding and just kind of turns the corner and comes down the building, it looks very simple and it’s a very tricky detail to pull off. So that we’re proud of. We had to work for a long time to make it happen.”

The process area of the building easily transitions to corporate offices with the aid of a long, vertical window that forms a skylight from wall to ceiling. The landscape and farmstead can be seen from horizontal windows located on the north wall of the process area, rooftop skylights filter natural daylight into the space and south-facing photovoltaic panels create a source of renewable electricity.

Graham Baba worked closely with contractor Rimmer & Roeter from early in the process to move the project forward through design development and permitting, and together they looked at areas where costs could be saved. The barrel rickhouses feature shallow gabled roofs, rectilinear forms and double hung windows that replicate traditional ricking houses. Originally the buildings were designed symmetrically so that both exterior ends of each building looked the same as they would look from the street. The team revised the design, however, so that the back of the buildings only feature standing seam metal and a garage door, while the front incorporates the wood siding and exposed steel elements of the rest of the design.

“We put in some more detail and a variety of materials,” Brown said, “and we put the effort into those moments that were a little closer to where the public interacted.”

The project, on which the team has formally been working since the master plan was formed in 2018, is still in the mid-stages of expansion. The process building and first rickhouse have been completed, according to Brown, and the second rickhouse is close to completion.

“It was a relatively complicated design process,” Brown said. “We did the first barrel storage building and the process building kind of at the same time, and as we were doing the updates to the distillery building, things had to happen in a very specific order so that there weren’t big delays in their production… all these pieces have to fit together.”

The team has submitted permit applications for the fourth rickhouse, which they’re aiming to start building in summer 2022, with a fifth to come. Future developments may also include a whiskey tasting room at the west end of the process building.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999418258666992}",neutral,0.9999418258666992,0
French luxury houses give unsold goods a second chance - FRANCE 24 English,"Sun, 06 Feb 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZyYW5jZTI0LmNvbS9lbi9saXZlLW5ld3MvMjAyMjAyMDYtZnJlbmNoLWx1eHVyeS1ob3VzZXMtZ2l2ZS11bnNvbGQtZ29vZHMtYS1zZWNvbmQtY2hhbmNl0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Paris (AFP) – In the extravagant world of the French luxury industry, brands used to prefer destroying their unsold goods rather than offering their high-priced products at a discount.

But gone are the days of binning the coats, handbags and shoes pooh-poohed by shoppers after a new anti-waste law came into force at the start of the year.

Now luxury houses are managing their stocks more carefully, offering deals to staff, making donations and recycling goods.

""It's a subject that has become important today,"" said Julie El Ghouzzi, a luxury goods expert at the Cultz consulting agency.

She pointed to the scandal that engulfed Burberry in 2018 after the British luxury brand disclosed that it had destroyed 28 million pounds ($38 million, 34 million euros at current exchange rates) of unsold goods in 2017 -- the equivalent of 20,000 of its trench coats.

Following the firestorm the revelation triggered, Burberry announced it would halt the practice from the following year.

Markdowns to move goods are not an option in the luxury business as lower prices can undermine the attractiveness of their labels, which thrive on their elite status.

""In the luxury sector, if the price tag is lower, so is the desire to buy it,"" said El Ghouzzi.

Mentalities have changed

Luxury houses are paying more attention to the subject now, said Arnaud Cadart, a portfolio manager at Paris-based asset manager Flornoy.

""Mentalities have changed, we're no longer in an economy that values unbridled creation above all else,"" he said.

Also gone is the mentality that ""if it doesn't work we'll destroy it,"" said Cadart.

Now luxury houses strive to fine-tune their stocks.

The Kering group, which owns the Gucci, Saint Laurent, and Balenciaga labels among others, has invested in artificial intelligence in order to better manage its stock.

Associations like Fabscrap in New York help the fashion industry recycle unused materials, as some countries like France adopt anti-waste laws that prohibit destroying and throwing out unsold goods Don Emmert AFP/File

At its competitor LVMH, the world's largest luxury group that includes Louis Vuitton, Dior, and Celine among many others, environmental development director Helene Valade said ""the luxury business model is closely adjusted to demand"" with low levels of stock being held by the firms.

Nevertheless, she acknowledged that the new law will push luxury houses to learn even more about their clients to better anticipate their purchases and thus reduce stocks to a minimum.

El Ghouzzi said Louis Vuitton is already quite good at keeping track of its stock.

""They know exactly what they have in stock and are capable of managing it down to the millimeter,"" she said, adding ""that's not the case in many other houses.""

When there are nevertheless unsold goods, selling them to staff at advantageous prices is one option. These large fashion groups have large staffs, with more than 150,000 employees at LVMH, 38,000 at Kering and 16,600 at Hermes.

Gifts to associations is another option.

LVMH has a partnership with Cravate Solidaire, an association that collects donations of professional clothing and provides it to people with disadvantaged backgrounds trying to land jobs.

- Upcycling -

Designers have also begun to make use of discarded or leftover materials, a practice often called upcycling.

""Previously, a designer with a brilliant idea would go search for materials to realise their idea,"" LVMH's Valade told AFP.

""Today, the process is sometimes the reverse: there are certain designers who start with the materials at hand -- old collections, unused fabric hanging about, leftover bits of leather... and it inspires them,"" she said.

This was the case for late American designer Virgil Abloh, who was the artistic director of Louis Vuitton's menswear collection from 2018 until his death in 2021.

Marc Jacobs in New York works with Fabscrap, which recycles unused fabric to create insulation or products like furniture lining, or donates it to students and artists to use for their creations.

LVMH also has a partnership with WeTurn, which collects unsold clothing and material to recycle it into new thread and fabric.

Hermes said that in 2020 it sold 39,000 upcycled products.

""The activities which destroy the most are fashion, leather goods and cosmetics,"" said portfolio manager Cadart.

Given the efforts undertaken and the current economic conditions, items are more often out of stock than lying about unsold.

""Since 2014, Hermes has thrown out almost nothing, everything flies off the shelves,"" Cadart added.

At LVMH, Valade said, ""leather goods are, at the moment, in more of a situation of being out of stock"" than not being sold.

She pointed to an upcycled Loewe bag made from scrap leather cuttings that sells for 1,700 euros and which is currently out of stock.

LVMH’s wines & spirits grew 26% in 2021 - Vino Joy News,"Mon, 07 Feb 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vdmluby1qb3kuY29tLzIwMjIvMDIvMDcvbHZtaHMtd2luZXMtc3Bpcml0cy1ncmV3LTI2LWluLTIwMjEv0gFIaHR0cHM6Ly92aW5vLWpveS5jb20vMjAyMi8wMi8wNy9sdm1ocy13aW5lcy1zcGlyaXRzLWdyZXctMjYtaW4tMjAyMS9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Luxury group LVMH's wines and spirits revenue soared 26% last year, thanks to reopening of on-trade business in the US, Europe and a rebound in Asia.

Luxury group LVMH’s wines and spirits revenue soared 26% last year, thanks to reopening of on-trade business in the US, Europe and a rebound in Asia.

The group’s wines and spirits division has 23 houses including Moët & Chandon, Krug, Dom Perignon, Veuve Clicquot, Hennessy and Château d’Yquem etc.

The Wines & Spirits business group recorded organic revenue growth of 26% in 2021 compared to 2020 and 9% compared to pre-pandemic 2019, according to the company’s latest annual report.

Champagne volumes were up compared to 2019. Growth was particularly strong in the US and Europe, which benefited from the reopening of restaurants and the gradual recovery in regional tourism.

The year marked the integration, from the third quarter onwards, of the prestigious Champagne House Armand de Brignac founded by rapper and entrepreneur Jay-Z, in which LVMH now holds a 50% stake.

Hennessy cognac performed well with an increase in volumes compared to 2019, despite supply constraints. China and the US experienced a strong rebound. Within the flourishing market for high-end rosé wines, Château d’Esclans in provence which was bought by the group in 2019 also enjoyed rapid growth and Château Galoupet continued its conversion to organic viticulture.

Bernard Arnault, Chairman and CEO of LVMH, said: “LVMH enjoyed a remarkable performance in 2021 against the backdrop of a gradual recovery from the health crisis. The Group’s record results could not have been achieved without the efficiency and exceptional ability of our teams to adapt and notably to remain connected to our customers, continuing to inspire dreams, despite the crisis.”

Looking forward, the luxury group is bullish on the prospects of 2022.

The Group will continue to pursue a strategy focused on developing its brands building on strong innovation and investments as well as a constant quest for quality of their products, of their desirability and of their distribution.

“Despite the uncertainties that remain at the start of this new year, which continues to be disrupted by health concerns, we approach 2022 with confidence and are convinced that LVMH is in an excellent position to further strengthen its lead in the global luxury market,” adds Arnault.

Overall, across different departments – Fashion, Jewellery & Watches, Cosmetics & Perfumes, the group recorded revenue of 64.2 billion euros in 2021, up 44% compared to 2020 and up 20% compared to 2019.

Is the acquisition of Ralph Lauren by LVMH a good idea? - nss magazine,"Thu, 24 Feb 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiOWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5zc21hZy5jb20vZW4vZmFzaGlvbi8yOTA3NC9yYWxwaC1sYXVyZW4tbHZtaNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"After Tiffany & Co. and the investment in Aimè Leon Dore, the LVMH group would have begun preliminary discussions aimed at the acquisition of the American giant Ralph Lauren. The news seems quite well-founded and, even if surrounded by a thick halo of potential, the simple bulk of the Ralph Lauren universe, which today sits on an enterprise value of just under eight billion, would not only be one of the largest acquisitions in the history of the fashion industry but would have a fundamental role in cementing LVMH's position in the increasingly essential American market. According to Axios, who reports the news, the move would make sense on the part of Ralph Lauren as it would secure the future of the company and crown the designer's ultimate success.

With LVMH, in fact, Ralph Lauren's huge empire would be in relatively safe hands – the Arnault family is not only comfortable in the luxury industry, but owns a considerable portion of it. According to Forbes' hypotheses, the idea could be to lead the brand towards even higher markets but above all to gain an increasingly strong grip on American fashion, represented in the group's portfolio already by Marc Jacobs, Fenty and Tiffany & Co. At the current stage of things, moreover, Forbes predicts that the news of an acquisition could make the group's market value skyrocket and would also offer the Arnaults a significant advantage over rival Kering.

If it were real, the deal could not only rewrite the hierarchy of the luxury industry but could also start a chain wave of mergers and acquisitions by industry groups, giving a new boost to that buying and selling of brands that started at the beginning of last year and then stopped in the second half of 2021. And although some more mischievous hypotheses suggest that the news is actually a leak designed to attract new bidders, in case Ralph Lauren really wants to sell it is likely, as Forbes suggests, that a possible announcement will come within the next three months. The lack of news by that date could be interpreted as a failure of the negotiations – but not their arrest.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9790882468223572}",positive,0.9790882468223572,1
Louis Vuitton Announces Global Price Increase Due to Supply Chain Shortages - HYPEBEAST,"Wed, 16 Feb 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vaHlwZWJlYXN0LmNvbS8yMDIyLzIvbG91aXMtdnVpdHRvbi1nbG9iYWwtcHJpY2UtaW5jcmVhc2UtYW5ub3VuY2VtZW500gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Louis Vuitton, arguably French luxury conglomerate LVMH‘s top fashion brand, has announced that it will be raising its prices around the globe later this week. The decision to do so comes at a time when most companies are struggling with the current global supply chain issue.

Louis Vuitton is citing increased manufacturing costs as well as global inflation as the core reason as to why its leather goods, accessories and fragrances will see a more expensive price tag soon. In a statement to Reuters Louis Vuitton commented on the matter, “The price adjustment takes into account changes in production costs, raw materials, transportation as well as inflation.” Louis Vuitton appears to be following the footsteps of its French luxury competitors including Hermès and Chanel. In late December last year, Chanel announced that it would hike up the prices of its most classic handbags by at least 60%.

COVID-19 has forced companies to halt or minimize production for a large part of 2020. It led to delays worldwide and unprecedented supply chain disruptions on a global scale. While that is the case, Louis Vuitton still reported record revenue for 2021, hitting $71.1 billion USD, a 40% increase from its numbers in 2020. Forbes reported that in an earnings call last month, LVMH CEO Bernard Arnault commented on the price increases expected this year sharing at the very least, “We have to remain reasonable.” The announcement of the price rising saw LVMH’s stock prices go up 3.58% on Tuesday, closing at a high of $694 USD at the end of the day.

The Plan for Off-White After Virgil Abloh - The Business of Fashion,"Mon, 28 Feb 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzb2ZmYXNoaW9uLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy9sdXh1cnkvdGhlLXBsYW4tZm9yLW9mZi13aGl0ZS1hZnRlci12aXJnaWwtYWJsb2gv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"MILAN — In 2017, Virgil Abloh, Davide De Giglio and Andrea Grilli all got the word “WOLF” tattooed on their right arms. “We were like a pack, we were like brothers,” said De Giglio, the quiet mastermind behind New Guards Group, the Milanese company that co-founded luxury streetwear sensation Off-White with Abloh, a trained architect turned Kanye West creative director. “Virgil was a legend, but first he was a friend,” said Grilli, Off-White’s CEO since 2019.

Piloted by Abloh, De Giglio and Grilli, Off-White became one of the fastest growing brands in fashion. But in November 2021, less than four years after the polymathic Abloh was recruited to luxury’s big leagues as men’s artistic director of Louis Vuitton, he died suddenly, at 41, after a private battle with cardiac angiosarcoma, a rare heart cancer. Now, Off-White is gearing up for its first show since the death of its founding designer, to be held tonight at Paris Fashion Week.

Louis Vuitton chief Michael Burke, who hired Abloh in 2018, has compared him to Karl Lagerfeld. “I saw the same visionary approach to life, the same attraction between designer and audience — not intellectual, but popular. They were both absolutely fearless about doing things differently, tireless in their work ethic, identical in their curiosity and equally plugged into the zeitgeist.”

But despite his genius, Abloh was always going to be “a chapter” in the story of Louis Vuitton, a 168-year-old luggage-maker that has become one of the world’s most recognisable consumer brands, alongside Apple, Coca-Cola, Disney and Nike. Vuitton’s leadership will no doubt find a way to turn the page, entrusting its men’s business to a new designer in due course.

For Off-White, where Abloh was practically the brand incarnate, the situation is very different. Losing a founder can present an existential threat to a young label, even one as successful as Off-White.

But the strength of Alexander McQueen more than 10 years after the 2010 suicide of its visionary founder suggests that, with a sound strategy and careful management, it’s possible for a young brand to not only survive but thrive after the loss of its creator.

De Giglio and Grilli both knew about Abloh’s heart cancer, and yet his sudden death last November came as a shock. “We never imagined that,” said De Giglio. “There was no planning.”

“I was fully aware of his condition from the beginning of his illness until the last day. But by that time, the cancer was well controlled and we were very positive about the future,” said Burke. “The timing of his passing was absolutely brutal.”

Luxury conglomerate LVMH, which owns Louis Vuitton, was enthused with Abloh’s work for the French house and eager to deepen their partnership. In July 2021, the group took control of the Off-White brand, activating provisions in its original agreement with Abloh to increase its stake to 60 percent. As part of the deal, LVMH also took a minority stake in Off-White’s operating company, which remains controlled by New Guards Group and its parent, the e-tailer Farfetch. The current licensing agreement between the Off-White brand and New Guards Group, by which the Milanese firm manages design, production, marketing and sales, will remain in place through at least 2026.

Now, De Giglio and Grilli, together with mentor Burke, plan to harness the legacy left by the late Abloh to turn Off-White into an “eternal” brand that Burke believes can grow to the scale of Dior, the couture house which became the cornerstone of the LVMH empire and whose fashion and leather goods business alone generated estimated sales revenue of $7 billion last year.

‘Like Dior in 1957’

“Off-White is in the position that Dior was in 1957,” said Burke. “Monsieur Dior had only been at the house for 10 years when he died. Off-White, too, was conceived almost 10 years ago. The question is: what has the founding father left? If the legacy is rich, authentic and steeped in values that go beyond fashion, the odds of turning a passing into something eternal are spectacular.”

Off-White’s next chapter is starting with a tribute show tonight at Paris Fashion Week, to be staged at the Palais Brongniart and livestreamed in over 100 storefronts across the French capital. Alongside Abloh’s final ready-to-wear collection, the brand will present couture-like “high fashion,” tease Off-White’s move into the lucrative beauty category and showcase a collaboration with Prada-owned shoemaker Church’s, projects Abloh was planning before his death.

“Off-White is like Dior was in 1957.”

But there is still much more in the “pipeline” of ideas that Abloh left behind, said Grilli. Much of this is captured in thousands of messages on WhatsApp, which the globe-trotting designer, who has called a “fully charged iPhone” his primary tool, used to stay connected with the Off-White team. “The connection with Virgil was mainly on WhatsApp. The number of ideas that we have directly from him — that were unmanageable on a daily, weekly and monthly basis — it’s endless,” said Grilli. “This is the legacy that we’re going to build around.”

“The next two years, we are going to go full-speed,” he said. “The fuel being poured into the brand, it’s for decades, for centuries. Virgil would have wanted us to do it. He always said this has to be a multi-generational brand; our kids need to go on Rodeo Drive and Rue Saint-Honoré and see it.”

From start-up to global sensation to stabilisation

Off-White rocketed to success soon after its launch, powered by a highly profitable blend of American streetwear and high-end Italian manufacturing. “Chanel meets Supreme,” as Abloh put it to De Giglio. A set of high-visibility signifiers — including diagonal stripes, arrows, tape and pithy text in quotation marks — helped make its simple but well-made t-shirts, sweatshirts, sneakers, belts and bags appealing to fashionistas, hypebeasts and luxury clients alike, especially as they were priced lower than the luxe streetwear statements of peers like Demna Gvasalia’s Vetements.

Then, there was a constant stream of collaborations with everyone from Nike to Ikea, which kept the brand in the conversation. “What Virgil did for Nike was exceptional. It was almost like a religion,” said Grilli. A focus on emerging markets also contributed to the label’s rapid rise. The brand was just as likely to launch stores in fast-growing shopping hubs in Asia as in traditional Western fashion capitals.

But it was ultimately the charismatic Abloh who animated Off-White, injecting it with hip-hop’s penchant for sampling and remixing, skateboarding’s sense of community and a desire for social progress just as a new generation of consumers was acquiring greater purchasing power and looking not just for cool-looking clothes, but something to believe in and belong to.

By 2018, the year Abloh joined Louis Vuitton, Off-White was “officially the hottest brand on the planet,” surpassing the likes of Gucci and Balenciaga, according to the Lyst Index, which measures brand heat based on sales, search and social media data. Off-White maintained its leading position, placing first or second for eight consecutive quarters. But as the streetwear trend waned, Off-White began to cool, placing fourteenth in the third quarter of 2021. (At the same time, sales of Abloh’s more sophisticated offering for Louis Vuitton were exploding).

Abloh had seen the shift coming, telling Dazed in late 2019 that streetwear was “gonna die.” “He was the one saying streetwear is dead, not in terms of culture but aesthetic,” said Grilli. “And we were already noticing some signs from the market.” The brand embarked on a revamp, working to elevate its seasonal collections with some success. Retailers report privately that Off-White’s share of sales has slipped since its early days. But some say its more tailored ready-to-wear has gained traction, as its logo-driven streetwear offer has cooled.

“Everyone knows hype can fade, and sales have slowed on the more obvious items, but the more elevated ready-to-wear works now,” said Tiffany Hsu, Mytheresa’s vice president of fashion buying for womenswear.

At the same time, with the support of New Guards owner Farfetch, Off-White has rapidly expanded its direct-to-consumer e-commerce business and reduced its wholesale exposure, boosting its margins. Today, the brand has 78 boutiques from Hong Kong to Mykonos, selling everything from hoodies to umbrella stands.

In fiscal 2020, total sales were €306 million, up from €273 million the year before, though earnings before interest and taxes dropped from €98 million to €90 million, according to a recent filing with Milan’s chamber of commerce. New Guards declined to comment on whether that filing was an accurate reflection of the brand’s global business.

A future without Virgil

Now, Off-White faces the challenge of moving forward without its creator. His legions of fans didn’t flock to the brand’s drops just to purchase product; they came to hang out with their tribe and Abloh was the chief. How can Off-White maintain that unique positioning without Abloh to animate it?

“The positioning of Off-White is beautiful for us and it’s still selling very well,” said Selfridges buying and merchandising director Sebastian Manes. “But Virgil was so present and meant a lot to many people. He was as big as the brand. It’s hard to dissociate the two.”

Grilli, too, sees Off-White and Abloh as inextricably linked. “Off-White is Virgil and will be forever,” he said. But despite his creative genius and almost superhuman energy, the peripatetic Abloh — who often hopscotched around the planet from meeting to meeting, DJ gig to DJ gig — worked extensively through a loyal team, providing early direction and final approval, and otherwise mostly leaving the design work to his deputies. Creative directors often work this way, but Abloh was more hands-off than most, sending input via WhatsApp messages from the other side of the world.

“He was very pragmatic, he trusted people. Trust is the number one quality that Virgil had,” said Grilli. “This allowed him to achieve what he achieved. Virgil was a maestro leading a perfect orchestra, and we’re super confident in the team in terms of executing his legacy.”

Currently creative decisions on product are made by head designers who each oversee categories including women’s, men’s, shoes, bags, knitwear and jewellery. “Every division has its own conductor,” said Grilli. “The team has been working with Virgil for six to seven years.”

Burke, too, has faith in the team at Off-White. “There’s been plenty of time for Virgil’s values to take root in the psyche and soul of the company,” he said. “Are they embodied in the studio? In the company? The answer is a resounding yes. And Andrea and Davide are the strongest team in Italy.”

While the licensing agreement between New Guards Group and Off-White’s new owner LVMH can be renegotiated or terminated in 2026, both parties say the alliance is cemented for the long term. “Contracts are contracts, but the wedding is super solid, now more than ever,” said Grilli.

Critically, the backing of LVMH gives Off-White plenty of breathing space to find the right creative configuration for the future, said Burke. “They are under no pressure to quickly come up with a singular answer. The coming seasons will give us indications as to what the right answer is.”

“It’s a defining moment when you have to replace the founding father. Yves Saint Laurent replaced Mr Dior, but Virgil’s passing doesn’t need to lead to the hiring of a messiah à la Virgil. It’s not impossible, but it’s not the only outcome,” said Burke. “There has been no precise decision on succession. But the brand has many cultural aspects — music, sport — and this allows us to go down different avenues, and going down one doesn’t preclude doing another a few seasons later.”

Grilli and De Giglio currently favour the notion of a “collective” to take the brand forward. “It’s going to be a group of people, a movement, a collective,” said De Giglio. “Think about Linux, open-source: you can inject something new and the software pattern evolves.”

“Virgil’s passing doesn’t need to lead to the hiring of a messiah à la Virgil.”

Whatever comes next, the brand will remain firmly rooted in Abloh’s legacy. “It might sound crazy, but I talk to Virgil every day,” said De Giglio. “It’s my way of moving forward. I ask him questions. I study. It’s like a religion, you don’t need to have someone next to you if you know the rules.”

The “rules” that define Off-White may still need to be pinned down. “In the beginning, we said, ‘What’s your idea?’ And Virgil said: ‘No rules, that’s the plan.’ The only rule is no rules,” said De Giglio. But the trick, according to Burke, is defining the rules and then knowing when to break them, resulting in a brand that can stand the test of time without becoming boring.

More than a fashion brand

Whether Off-White can continue to scale and become a multi-billion-dollar legacy brand remains to be seen. Today, the fashion market moves far faster than it did in 1957 when Christian Dior died, or even when Alexander McQueen lost its founder, Lee, in 2010.

The success of Off-White’s next chapter may be less about conjuring the ghost of Abloh than fulfilling his founding vision for a brand not just about clothes but community.

A PowerPoint slide in Grilli’s office lists a series of keywords that encapsulate his priorities for Off-White: “Keep Surprising,” “Elevate,” “Dream,” “Journey,” “Values,” “Culture,” “Accessibility” and “Fun.” Clustered next to “Culture” are also “Art,” “Sport,” “Music” and “Couture.”

Grilli and De Giglio want to keep the brand fun and surprising, continuing Abloh’s practice of reaching beyond fashion into art, architecture, music, sport, even food. “Off-White is one of the few brands that can sell a mug, a rug, an ashtray and a leather jacket,” said Grilli.

This week, Off-White will tease its beauty line — a genderless range that’s more about self-expression than prettification and will be worn by the models at tonight’s show — as well as launch a collaboration with restaurant group Caviar Kaspia that will be a “100 percent takeover down to the tableware,” said Grilli.

“This is not a brand that is closed,” said De Giglio. “This is Off-White, come let’s talk. Virgil always said, ‘I want to open doors, to do something new with new people, with the kids.’ And the door is still open. We’ve suffered a big loss, but on the other side there is happiness.”

Inside The Luxury Fashion Industry's Big Sustainability Push - British Vogue,"Sun, 20 Feb 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZvZ3VlLmNvLnVrL2Zhc2hpb24vYXJ0aWNsZS9mYXNoaW9uLWluZHVzdHJ5LXN1c3RhaW5hYmlsaXR50gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"One glorious September afternoon, along the banks of the Seine, designer Gabriela Hearst held her first in-person show for Chloé. For it, she made the collection and presentation – spring/summer 2022 – as sustainable and inclusive as possible. How so? Guests were seated on cushions made of Chloé fabric remnants, atop benches of stacked bricks, constructed by Les Bâtisseuses, a network that trains women refugees.

The clothes were conceived to be environmentally friendly, too. As Hearst believes “luxury fashion has become overly industrialised,” she introduced the Chloé Craft initiative: products handcrafted by independent artisans, such as the multicoloured sleeveless dress in recycled hand-crocheted cashmere, or the white cashmere poncho with hand-painted blue stripes. Chloé’s staples, such as its signature tote bag, Nama sneakers and all of its denim, incorporated recycled and lower-impact materials.

The soles of Chloé’s new footwear line, Lou, were made with Ocean Sole, a social enterprise that upcycles flip-flops found on Kenya’s beaches. Overall, Chloé increased its use of lower-impact materials to 58 per cent versus 40 per cent for autumn/winter 2021. As for social impact – because Chloé believes, rightly, that sustainability and social justice go hand-in-hand – catering leftovers were donated to Linkee, a Paris-based NGO that distributes food to those in need. Most democratic of all was how passers-by could watch the show from the bridge above.

Luxury fashion has long been set in its ways when it comes to business. And why not? The system worked well for brands and consumers alike. But with climate change bearing down hard, and the industry’s goal to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050 – as well as meet consumer demand for greener practices – the industry is reshaping its methods, from field to form, dirt to dress. Many brands have already made changes, such as incorporating LEDs in stores and using recycled materials for shopping bags. But there are other reforms being enacted throughout the industry, setting it on a course that will be more ethical, responsible and clean.

For example, designers are using deadstock, as leftover fabric is known – so much so that in April 2021, French luxury group LVMH launched Nona Source, the first online resale platform of deadstock materials, collected from the group’s houses. Now designers can purchase remnants from the ateliers of Dior, Givenchy, Louis Vuitton and others at a fraction of the original cost. Meanwhile, studio teams are sourcing hi-tech or recycled fabrics. Prada is using Econyl, a recycled nylon made from abandoned fishing nets, throughout its collections, and plans to eliminate virgin nylon from its supply chain this year. Sarah Burton at Alexander McQueen has fashion recycled polyester – known as poly faille – into dresses. Emporio Armani folded recycled materials and regenerated leather fibre into its collections, and its eyewear has lenses partly made of bio-based material.

Last spring, Stella McCartney unveiled a prototype corset and trousers in Mylo, a lab-grown leather-like material made of mycelium – the root structure of mushrooms – developed by Bolt Threads in Silicon Valley. This spring, she is introducing the Frayme Mylo, a new handbag made out of the same material. She debuted it during her spring/summer 2022 show in Paris in October – the first mycelium to be presented on a runway. “It has no less durability or desirability than animal-skin leather,” she explains. For now, Frayme Mylo will be available as a limited edition, but, she promises, there is more to come. “I’m hoping it’s the future of fashion, and that in five years, it will be absolutely the norm,” she adds.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999909400939941}",neutral,0.9999909400939941,0
Nigo unveils his first design collection for LVMH with a radically straightforward vision of Kenzo suggesting a possible ... - Global Design News,"Mon, 14 Feb 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMizAFodHRwczovL2dsb2JhbGRlc2lnbm5ld3MuY29tL25pZ28tdW52ZWlscy1oaXMtZmlyc3QtZGVzaWduLWNvbGxlY3Rpb24tZm9yLWx2bWgtd2l0aC1hLXJhZGljYWxseS1zdHJhaWdodGZvcndhcmQtdmlzaW9uLW9mLWtlbnpvLXN1Z2dlc3RpbmctYS1wb3NzaWJsZS1hbHRlcm5hdGl2ZS10by10aGUtY2VsZWJyaXR5LXN0eWxlLWluZHVzdHJpYWwtY29tcGxleC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Paris, France

Nigo, the Kenzo brand’s new 51-year old creative director launched his debut of Kenzo’s Fall/Winter 2022 men’s and women’s collection, for the positive, at-ease vibes at Galerie Vivienne, a nod to the late designer and founder Kenzo Takada, who unveiled his first collection in 1970 in the mythic Parisian arcade.

His combined men’s and women’s collection is infused with a “real-to-wear” spirit that blends heritage with contemporary codes.

Under the natural lighting of the glass roof over the Galerie Vivienne, 60 feminine and masculine silhouettes took to the catwalk against the backdrop of a soundtrack featuring an exclusive preview of the designer’s upcoming album I Know Nigo, with contributions from Pharrel Williams and Tyler, The Creator, among others.

The artists joined other guests for Nigo’s first show, warmly wrapped in Kenzo logo blankets, to witness the birth of a new style marked by multiple cultures, at the same time authentic and avant-garde.

Nigo fused American influences and Japanese culture to create a harmonious dialogue.

Varsity jackets with Ivy League patches and aviation jackets are joined by traditional Japanese garments like the samue worn by potters–a craft that Nigo practices–or Hanten, a traditional piece revisited in double-faced wool for coats, as well as cropped jackets lined with wool flannel.

Faithful to the late Kenzo Takada’s real-to-wear ethos, Nigo mixes tailoring and workwear for a genderless silhouette. Sturdy salopettes in Japanese denim with yellow topstitching are joined by suits in the Prince of Wales checks and stripes employed by Kenzo Takada.

Prints of original sketches by the founder cover white ensembles for women and men.

In knitwear, Nigo explores plays of color and texture, connecting with the beginnings of the Maison. The date 1970 was also ubiquitous at the show, stitched on a myriad of berets, mirroring Nigo’s birthday in Japan and the year Kenzo Takada was revealed in Paris as a designer destined to become one of the best of his generation.

Poetry informs the accessories in the collection as well.

The Maison’s emblematic poppy is embroidered on denim, escaping from a vase-like pocket, painted on shoes, or woven as a thick knitwear ornament.

Kenzo Paris labels in the same poppy red embellish the sleeve of a suit, add a signature to a bag, or play across both sides of a tie. Kenzo’s tiger code turns tame in a new Aka-e Tiger watercolor motif created by Nigo for comforting contemporary feline fleece scarves.

Bags include reversible pouch bags embroidered with maps of Japan on one side and France on the other, another affirmation of the unique ties between the two cultures as Maison Kenzo embarks on a new creative chapter in its history.

"Inflation, Positioning & China: A Dive into Luxury Brands’ Price Increases - The Fashion Law","Thu, 17 Feb 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWZhc2hpb25sYXcuY29tL2luZmxhdGlvbi1wb3NpdGlvbmluZy1jaGluYS1hLWRpdmUtaW50by1sdXh1cnktYnJhbmRzLXByaWNlLWluY3JlYXNlcy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Price increases went into effect for Louis Vuitton offerings on Wednesday, sending prices on certain handbags up by as much as 26 percent. Confirming the impending rises early this week, a representative for the French luxury goods brand, which currently holds the title of the largest in the world, said that “changes in production costs, raw materials, transportation, as well as inflation” were responsible for driving the hike in price tags. Meanwhile, last month, LVMH chairman Bernard Arnault stated that price increases were in the works, noting that the luxury goods group has room to increase prices of its luxury goods and “protect margins in an inflationary environment.”

Luxury brands – like Louis Vuitton – routinely use price increases to offset the effects of inflation and currency fluctuations (the latter of which is a key driver of global gray market sales), but there is likely more going on with the recent pricing plays than just protecting margins, in light of the fact that luxury groups, including Louis Vuitton owner LVMH, have touted “record levels of revenue and profitability.” LVMH recently reported that its Fashion & Leather Goods division – and the group as a whole – saw rising profitability in 2021, with its operating margin (i.e., the profit a company makes on a dollar of sales after paying for variable costs of production, such as wages and raw materials, but before paying interest or tax) for 2021 amounting to 26.7 percent, up 8 points compared to 2020 and up 5 points from 2019.

So, while Louis Vuitton and other similarly-situated companies are primarily “cit[ing] cost inflation for rises,” Neev Capital managing director Rahul Sharma stated on Wednesday that luxury’s record-high margins suggest that the newest price boosts for Louis Vuitton, at least, are also about “pricing power and creating scarcity,” echoing sentiments from UBS analysts this week. Not a novel point, the practice of luxury brands using price increases as a positioning tool as much as a weapon to offset inflation also seems to be guiding enduring price boosts for Chanel, which appears to angling to align its model more closely with that of Hermès, which maintains a relatively tight hold on – and enjoys cult-like demand for – its most coveted offerings, thanks to its pricing and careful distribution.

To be fair, costs are rising across the board for brands in the luxury segment and beyond. Federal Reserve Economic Data puts the cost of leather goods manufacturing for luggage, for instance, including suitcases, travel bags, backpacks, and other types of bags, on the up.

With rising costs in mind, brands that have not already raised prices will likely follow in Louis Vuitton’s lead. According to a note from Barclays analysts, Chanel, Dior, and Celine have already boosted prices, and Hermès is expected to follow suit to some extent (likely modestly). LVMH-owned watchmakers Tag Heuer and Hublot have indicated that they will raise prices come April, while Moncler, Prada, and Versace and Michael Kors owner Capri have also cited plans to boost their prices.

Beyond that, in reporting its 2021 revenues on Thursday, Kering’s management revealed that it would increase prices across its brands, following price increases for its big brands in 2021. (Gucci, for instance raised prices twice in 2021, and has more broadly been increasing the average prices of its offerings by way of the introduction of capsule collections, such as its Aria mashup with Balenciaga.)

Looking back to Louis Vuitton’s prices, again, one of the things that stands out more than the brand’s moves to maintain its record profitability and boost its positioning in the eyes of consumers (and thus, hold on to its “luxury” goodwill) is the enduring gap in price tags between its offerings in China and other markets. The company’s latest price increases “are consistent across different markets on most of the products,” and with “higher price increases [coming] in France, UK and the U.S. than in China for some of the entry-level monogram canvas bags,” Bernstein analyst Luca Solca stated in a note on Wednesday, but the China price gap remains.

“Using France as base,” Bernstein found that on average, Louis Vuitton products in Mainland China are “37 percent more expensive, followed by 19 percent for the U.S. and 12 percent for UK.” In a few striking examples, Louis Vuitton’s Petite Malle bag is priced at €2,400 ($2,727) in France as of Wednesday’s increase and ¥44,500 ($7,022) in China, its OnTheGo GM bag sells for €2,000 ($2,273) in France and ¥24,500 ($3,866) in China, and its NÉONOÉ bag sells for €2,100 ($2,386) in France and ¥21,800 ($3,440) in China.

The enduring price differentials between China and other markets could lead to potential issues down the road, as Chinese consumers have significantly boosted their spending on the mainland versus internationally since the onset of the pandemic. To put the change in perspective: Chinese consumers spent $73.6 billion on luxury goods at home in 2021, up from almost $53.6 billion 2020 and $36.9 billion in 2019, and with a return to international travel not yet back on the table, this trend is expected to continue to play out.

It is difficult to imagine that brands will continue to be able to boast such striking price disparities between their home turf (and also the U.S. and UK), and the valuable Chinese market, particularly given the sheer value of – and their dependence on – the Chinese luxury consumer. After all, while China’s share of the global luxury goods market was about 32 percent in 2020, putting it behind the U.S., it is still on track to surpass the Western luxury titan to become the world’s largest market by 2025, according to both Bain and Euromonitor International. In reality, Bain analysts asserted last month that with its appetite for luxury goods and growing middle class, “China remains the best consumer story in the world.” The average increase of disposable income on the mainland “remains higher than inflation,” they note, making the stakes notably high even if Chinese consumers have taken the price hikes in stride to date and carried on spending.

As Beijing continues to crack down on everything from big tech and crypto to celebrities, gaming and wealth inequality, one question worth considering is whether – and when – it will take a hard stance on the consistently eye-watering mark-ups that are being served on Chinese consumers on the mainland by non-native luxury brands.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9470224976539612}",neutral,0.9470224976539612,0
Louis Vuitton To Increase Prices Worldwide - HYPEBAE,"Tue, 15 Feb 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vaHlwZWJhZS5jb20vMjAyMi8yL2xvdWlzLXZ1aXR0b24tbHZtaC1wcmljZS1pbmNyZWFzZS1yYWlzZS13b3JsZHdpZGUtZ2xvYmFsLWluZmxhdGlvbi1pbmZv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Louis Vuitton has confirmed that it will be raising its prices this week. The cost of the house’s leather goods, accessories and fragrances will be affected around the world.

“The price adjustment takes into account changes in production costs, raw materials, transportation as well as inflation,” Louis Vuitton told Reuters. The LVMH-owned label joins Hermès and Chanel who have also altered their prices since the pandemic started.

Last month, LVMH chairman and CEO Bernard Arnault shared the company’s full-year earnings of 2021, with revenue of €64.2 billion EUR ($71.5 billion USD) — a 44% increase compared to the previous year. As a result, Arnault stated that LVMH “has enough wiggle room to raise prices.” However, he noted that they “have to remain reasonable” when it comes to the increase in prices this year.

Following the announcement of raising its costs, the French brand sent LVMH’s stock prices up by 3.58% on February 15, “hitting an end-of-close high of $694 USD,” as per Forbes.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999659061431885}",neutral,0.9999659061431885,0
Antoine Pin at LVMH Watch Week - WorldTempus,"Thu, 17 Feb 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vZW4ud29ybGR0ZW1wdXMuY29tL2FydGljbGUvaW5kdXN0cnktbmV3cy9wZW9wbGUtYW5kLWludGVydmlld3MvYnVsZ2FyaS1hbnRvaW5lLXBpbi1hdC1sdm1oLXdhdGNoLXdlZWstMzExMTMuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"At the LVMH Watch Week, WorldTempus met with Antoine Pin, managing director of Bulgari’s Watchmaking Division, who agreed to share his plans for the coming year with our readers

What has the start of the year been like for Bulgari?

It’s been very positive. After the upset of 2020, 2021 was a year of ongoing recovery, with brand recognition growing strongly in every region alongside increased demand for all our collections across all price segments. 2022 looks set to bring more of the same, which makes us very optimistic, but also makes us keen to understand the nature of the demand. We’re continuing our efforts in terms of product and movement development, as you will have seen in our launches at the LVMH Watch Days in January, with the Piccolissimo calibre. We’re still riding the wave that started to build in 2021. It’s a strong motivator for our internal teams, but this year it’s amplified by market traction, which is accelerating the dynamic even more.

During LVMH Watch Week, you focused on the exceptional.

I always insist that Bulgari offers products that are accessible as well as exceptional. Clearly, the exceptional items steal much of the spotlight from our other products, but we did present innovations in the Lvcea and Serpenti collections, although they’re obviously less impressive than our sonnerie watches. The Lvcea Intarsia with aventurine dial, for example, has been a great success. It’s a cocktail watch priced at under CHF 10,000, which is unusual for a precious watch. It showcases artistic crafts such as marquetry and fine gem-setting, as well as precious materials. Light reflects off the faceted diamonds and spangled dark blue aventurine, which evokes a starry night. At this price, it’s quite an aesthetic feat. It’s important for Bulgari to be able to share a sense of what is precious, an aesthetic identity, the art of watchmaking and jewellery technique – at a reasonable price. The 5 to 10K segment remains very important for us, although it’s getting more difficult because cost price is an issue. Our team must be able to convince less well-off clients to join the Bulgari adventure. Our distribution network is broad, because Bulgari offers jewellery that starts at just CHF 1500, and we want to involve these clients in our watchmaking story, open the door to them, with products that convey our values.

Are women interested in the performance aspects of the Piccolissimo calibre?

We’ve noticed a real demand for our women’s mechanical timepieces. We keep selling out; we can’t keep up with demand. But the Piccolissimo hasn’t come about merely from analysing the women’s mechanical watch market. We defined a movement strategy a few years back, and we paid particular attention to the issue of miniaturisation. A small movement naturally provides a jeweller and designer with an opportunity to propose products that are more elegant and more creative, because there are fewer constraints. We began this journey with the Finissimo, and the ultimate elegance of ultra-thin watches, but it was entirely logical then to transfer the miniaturisation symbolised by the Octo Finissimo to smaller diameter watches, particularly jewellery watches. We created the Piccolissimo calibre, which became the logical second chapter in our miniaturisation story. During LVMH Watch Days, people understood that the Finissimo saga wasn’t a single inspired idea: it was part of the coherent vision of a luxury brand. We’ve been fortunate to be able to develop a vision that preceded our market analysis.

But there’s another reason we thought it logical to rethink our jewellery watch calibres – a reason that has become very topical. In a world that is increasingly sensitive to issues of durability and the protection of the environment, what could be more appropriate than developing a watch that doesn’t require electricity or electronic components, and which won’t be obsolete in twenty or fifty years?

The Bulgari brand has evolved considerably. How would you describe it today?

A brand must regularly return to its origins, to its deepest identity and raison d’être. When we develop a new model, it must reflect the codes of our jewellery, or of our Italian-ness. We always ask ourselves the same question: how can Bulgari the Roman jeweller add value to the world of the Swiss watch? How should we translate our differentiating features, this mix of creativity and rigour, which guides our product strategy? In the 2000s Bulgari was very popular; it was open to the world. Then we bought Gerald Genta and Daniel Roth, and the brand moved upmarket and became more elitist. Today, we’re aiming for the happy medium, where the cultural side can coexists with the proximity that the brand also conveys. Being universal requires a delicate balancing act.

Today, we’re comfortable with the coherent diversity of our offer, which extends from the legendary BB Aluminium, a symbol of the chic Italian lifestyle, sociable and versatile, to our new Serpenti Misteriosi, which is an extraordinary accomplishment in terms of both fine jewellery and horology.

What are the challenges facing Bulgari today?

We have to be able to keep up with evolutions in how the brand is perceived, and respond to the demand, at what is a very chaotic time for the world. We are continually faced with upsets that require short-term responses, whereas watch industry planning is a long-term thing. It’s particularly crucial in a highly integrated manufacture like ours, which demands considerable industrial investment, and which has a large workforce. We can’t tweak our human resources according to export volumes. On the contrary: we have a long-term relationship with our staff. We’re committed to training and retaining them, and that requires a sound long-term vision.

The Geneva Watch Days were initiated by Bulgari, Breitling and Ulysse Nardin. Will you be organising a third edition?

As soon as the last edition ended, all the members said they wanted to continue. The Geneva authorities also confirmed their support. Everyone loved it, including journalists, some of whom said it was the best watch event they’d ever attended. This was down to the relaxed atmosphere, the late summer in Geneva, the fresh air, the fact that people could meet up in person, and set their own agendas. The format was very well received, and we’ve already had applications from some new participants. We need to find the right balance between welcoming new brands and keeping the original spirit of Geneva Watch Days. The organisational itself is still relatively light, with a great deal of commitment required from the brands. The Chamber of Commerce and Industry will also be involved, and will help to give the event greater visibility with some new initiatives that we’ll announce in due course. It’s my hope that the Geneva Watch Days will incorporate a new cultural element, which will help to introduce the event to new audiences.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9999997615814209}",positive,0.9999997615814209,1
Louis Vuitton uses new workshops to mix politics and business - The National,"Tue, 22 Feb 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZW5hdGlvbmFsbmV3cy5jb20vYnVzaW5lc3MvMjAyMi8wMi8yMy9sb3Vpcy12dWl0dG9uLWxldmVyYWdlcy1uZXctd29ya3Nob3BzLXRvLW1peC1wb2xpdGljcy1hbmQtYnVzaW5lc3Mv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Opening a new workshop in rural France isn’t typically a headline-grabbing event. Unless the country’s richest man is the host.

LVMH chairman Bernard Arnault, who is the world's third-richest person with a net worth of $157 billion, showed up in the Loire region with an A-list entourage that included his son Frederic, who heads the TAG Heuer watch business, and French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire.

A throng of 70 visitors toured the two complexes, where Louis Vuitton will be making a variety of bags and eventually create 400 jobs.

The event highlighted how the chairman of LVMH can command the attention of France’s political elite by playing up his company’s Made-in-France credentials. Louis Vuitton is a marquee industry for France, for which luxury fashion is a cornerstone of its economic and cultural heritage.

The new complexes are situated in the towns of Aze and Vendome, where the site occupies an 11th-century abbey that was renovated at a cost of about €20 million ($22.7m).

The additional venues will help to alleviate a supply crunch that is reverberating across the industry as well-heeled shoppers clamour for handbags, belts and other high-end leather goods.

Only last week, arch-rival Hermes International said it was not able to meet demand for its leather products that include the Birkin bags. Hermes plans to add three manufacturing sites in France through to 2024.

Louis Vuitton collaborates with artist Jeff Koons

There is an “auspicious” economic environment in France, which is the most attractive in Europe for foreign investments, Mr Arnault said. “Our craftswomen often manufacture products that have wait lists.”

Earlier this month, a group of workers at three Louis Vuitton manufacturing sites staged walkouts amid a dispute over working hours.

Louis Vuitton settled on a labour framework last week that reduces the working time per week by two hours to 33 hours, as well as increases the average wage by 7 per cent, or about €150 a month, a representative for the brand said.

Workers at Louis Vuitton “are among the best-paid”, which keeps them loyal, Mr Arnault said at the opening of LVMH's new workshops.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999933242797852}",neutral,0.9999933242797852,0

Bernard Arnault’s son, Alexandre, is jumping into Cryptopunks with a new profile picture NFT, just days after the billionaire LVMH chairman signalled wariness over the metaverse “bubble effects"".

The 29-year-old scion, who heads up product and communications at Tiffany & Co., now has his own Cryptopunks PFP (profile picture), a beanie-wearing pixelated face with an earring, knitted cap and 3D glasses on both his Twitter and Instagram profile photos. A bot tracking Ethereum purchases said the NFT, called Punk 3167, was purchased for Eth 160 (around $416,400). LVMH confirmed Alexandre Arnault’s profile picture change was legitimate.

NFT profile picture owners often use the avatar on social media to signify membership in the Web 3.0 community, with Cryptopunks and Bored Ape Yacht Club, which has partnered with Adidas, among the most recognisable.

Read More LVMH’s Arnault is wary of the metaverse “bubble”. Should luxury be? The luxury executive is taking a wait-and-see approach to digital 3D worlds and products, he told analysts during the company’s earnings call on Thursday. We ask the experts for their views.

“I am happy to welcome @alexarnault from @TiffanyAndCo to the #PUNK club! The future is bright. WAGMI,” tweeted Thibault Launay, the founder of Exclusible, which has built an NFT marketplace for luxury brands. WAGMI stands for “We are all gonna make it,” an acronym used by the community to build motivation. LVMH’s former head of digital and now advisor Ian Rogers, and chief experience officer at Ledger, also tweeted “GM fren” to Arnault’s account, code for “good morning, friend.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999951124191284}",neutral,0.9999951124191284,0
Louis Vuitton's bags and clothes are about to get even more expensive - Inverse,"Tue, 15 Feb 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmludmVyc2UuY29tL2lucHV0L3N0eWxlL2xvdWlzLXZ1aXR0b24tYmFncy1jbG90aGVzLWFjY2Vzc29yaWVzLXByaWNlLWhpa2UtbW9yZS1leHBlbnNpdmUtaW5mbGF0aW9u0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"If you’ve been waiting for the right time to snatch a Louis Vuitton, it’s now. Due to increased manufacturing and transportation costs, the prices of goods from LVMH’s most successful brand are set to be raised on Wednesday.

Following Chanel’s lead, the LV price hike will affect leather goods, accessories, fragrances, and more across its global stores — though there isn’t a set list of new prices yet. A statement to Reuters explained that the decision was a reflection of “production costs, raw materials, transportation as well as inflation.”

Paying the price — PurseBop, a luxury market tracking website, has predicted a 4 percent to 18 percent increase, though the true increase amounts remain to be seen. LVMH CEO Bernard Arnault, whose net worth is approximately $180 billion, stated that the brand has enough “wiggle room” to protect its margins but also said that management “would have to be reasonable.” Arnault briefly became the world’s richest person in 2021, due in part to the momentum of the luxury market during lockdown.

Louis Vuitton, Fendi, Dior, Givenchy, Celine, and 65 other prestigious brands fall under the LVMH umbrella. Dior, the second-largest sector of LVMH’s profits, also announced that it was contemplating a price increase on certain products to “further establish the brand’s high-end credentials.”

The cost of luxury — Earlier this month, several hundred Louis Vuitton workers in France organized a walkout to demand better wages and working hours. It seems the brand’s recent coffee table book honoring the ateliers behind the monogram didn’t show the reality of its poor working conditions. However, Fashion Network reported that the brand is working on creating a better “work-life balance” for its employees, starting with an additional €150 per month and a reduction in working hours from 35 to 33 hours per week.

Louis Vuitton is one of the most recognizable luxury brands on the market, and with the late Virgil Abloh’s influence still adding to LV’s success, it’ll be interesting to see how far the brand pushes its good fortune. Will its pockets never be full enough?","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9916417598724365}",neutral,0.9916417598724365,0

LVMH Louis Vuitton Moët Hennessy SE increased its handbag prices globally this week, in some cases by double-digit percentages, according to Bernstein Research. LVMH declined to comment, but Bernstein, which tracks the closely followed industry proxy, estimates that global handbag price hikes at LVMH’s Louis Vuitton brand came in on average at between 6% and 7%.

The price of some popular handbags in some markets rose by as much as 25%, Bernstein found. In China, a medium Louis Vuitton Coussin bag, for instance, rose from 30,000 yuan, about equal to $4,730, to 37,500 yuan.

With affluent customers who accept—and in some cases seek—hefty price tags, luxury brands are typically able to raise prices without affecting demand for their products. That is in contrast with many mass-market consumer brands, which face tricky decisions about whether to pass costs on to price-sensitive customers.

“We have an advantage on quite a few other companies and groups, which is that we have a degree of flexibility on our prices,"" said Bernard Arnault, LVMH’s chairman and chief executive, on a January earnings call. “In the face of inflation, we have the ways and means to react.""

On Thursday, Jean-Marc Duplaix, chief financial officer of Gucci owner Kering SA, said the company’s priority this year is to safeguard profitability gains made in 2021, making price increases an option.

Compagnie Financière Richemont SA, whose luxury brands include Cartier, has also been raising the prices of some of its watches and jewelry in recent months. Versace and Jimmy Choo plan to raise prices for those brands’ clothing and shoes, said John Idol, chief executive of Capri Holdings Ltd., the brands’ owner, on an earnings call earlier this month.

Some price rises have faced pushback. Chanel SA has lifted prices for its handbags sharply, The Wall Street Journal reported, triggering an outcry from some shoppers.

The luxury sector is already flying high after a grim 2020, during which the pandemic hammered sales. Demand roared back last year, with luxury consumers flocking to stores as Covid-19 lockdowns eased. The industry is striving to maintain that strong momentum in 2022, said Kathryn Parker, an analyst at Jefferies Group. Part of the strategy is pricing hikes, she said, since most players have the luxury of raising prices to maintain margins without scaring customers away.

“Luxury really is immune,"" said Ms. Parker, noting that even during low inflation periods, many players raise prices over and above rising costs. “They have the pricing power to offset any underlying cost inflation."" Jefferies expects global luxury revenues to increase by around 15% this year, despite inflation.

LVMH, Europe’s most valuable company by market capitalization, said last month that 2021 was its best year ever: Revenue came in at €64.2 billion, or about $73.1 billion, up 20% relative to pre-pandemic 2019. Profit for the year rose 49%, to €17.2 billion, from 2019.

Kering on Thursday reported 2021 revenue of €17.6 billion, up 13% compared with 2019, while profit was up 38% at €3.2 billion. Results pushed Kering stock up around 7% by early European afternoon.

Gucci, Kering’s largest brand but a relatively weak performer recently in growth terms, had a strong fourth quarter of 2021, with sales up 18% compared with the same period in 2019. Analysts said that the movie “House of Gucci,"" though disavowed by the Gucci family, may have boosted the brand’s profile and helped its growth to rebound.

Quick Takes: Zenith DEFY 21 Chroma new from LVMH Watch Week - - Deployant,"Sat, 05 Feb 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiLGh0dHBzOi8vZGVwbG95YW50LmNvbS96ZW5pdGgtZGVmeS0yMS1jaHJvbWEv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The DEFY 21 Chroma is a colourful execution of the high-frequency El Primero 21 1/100th of a second chronograph model, crafted in a 44mm matte white ceramic case with rainbow-coloured movement visible through the open dial set with markers in a gradient of tones. The white rubber strap also features rainbow stitching. Limited edition of 200 pieces.

Quick Takes: Zenith DEFY 21 Chroma

The Case and Dial

Featuring a matte microblasted white ceramic case in 44mm for the DEFY 21, the muted finish enhances the sleek lines of the faceted case as it absorbs light rather than reflect it. The DEFY 21 is paired with white ceramic bezels for a sharp contrast with the rainbow accented dial and crown.

The case in size and style is similar in concept to pieces from Tag Heuer and Hublot. There are lesser screw fastened elements on the case, but the design construction is similar to the Big Bang. Using an integrated lugs design, the shorter lugs as compared to a Royal Oak Offshore or Hublot Big Bang delivers a stark improvement in wearability.

With ergonomics as well as durability in mind, the watch is fit with a rubber and fabric strap, with a water-resistance of 100 metres.

Rectangular pushers activate and reset the chronograph, while a rubber inlay screwdown crown adjusts the time. Both buttons and crown are well sized to maximize the tactile experience when interacting with the watch, enhancing the watch’s sportiness. And in actual use, it does not disappoint. The start, stop, reset of the pushers feel very nice to operate.

The openworked dial shows an underlying gunmetal bridge, beneath contrasting white subdials. Through the dial, one can see the escapement, gear train and spring barrel. Moving parts that add to the exciting 1/100th second theater on the dial.

Unequivocally modern in its choice of proportions, architecture, materials and finish, the DEFY El Primero 21 Chroma does carry on some of the distinctive traits from the earliest retro-futuristic DEFY models of the 1960s such as the A3642, included the angular case and its faceted bezel

The Movement

The watch runs on the El Primero 9004 automatic caliber. This is a highly unique complication with 2 escapements, one for the watch and another for the 1/100th of a second Chronograph. Fascinating is that both escapements beat at different rates, since a higher rate is required for the 1/100th chronograph, but having it run all the time for regular timekeeping would create too much wear on the parts. 1 escapement for the watch beats at (36,000 VpH – 5 Hz); and 1 escapement for the Chronograph beats at (360,000 VpH – 50 Hz). The movement is TIME LAB Chronometer certified.

Concluding thoughts

A step up from the run-off the mill skeleton rubber strap chronographs, Zenith wows with its movement as it usually does. For starters, dual escapement, super high beat chronograph, all titanium case are major plus points for a modern sports watch. The new colorway is playful and stylistically vibrant, making it a good option for a more casual timepiece.

Priced at US$14500, the DEFY 21 Chroma is limited to 200 pieces and is marked as ‘coming soon’ online.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999628067016602}",neutral,0.9999628067016602,0
OTB's 2021 budget and its advantages over LVMH and Kering - LaConceria | Il portale dell'area pelle - La conceria.it,"Mon, 14 Feb 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxhY29uY2VyaWEuaXQvZW4vbHV4dXJ5L290YnMtMjAyMS1idWRnZXQtYW5kLWl0cy1hZHZhbnRhZ2VzLW92ZXItbHZtaC1hbmQta2VyaW5nL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"“LVMH and Kering are bigger. But, compared to them, we have advantages in terms of elasticity and speed of decision-making that we are trying to exploit”. So says Ubaldo Minelli, CEO of OTB, a group that has presented its 2021 budget amidst the hypothesis of acquisitions and listing on the stock exchange, but, above all, with a great desire to grow. In other words, it has budgeted 300 million euros to invest in order to go from a 2021 turnover of 1.5 billion euros to 2.5 billion euros in 2024.

OTB’s 2021 budget

OTB (which owns Diesel, Maison Margiela and Jil Sander) reported net sales of just under 1.5 billion euros in 2021, up 18% on 2020 and in line with 2019. Net profit was 142 million euros. Its performance was driven by the luxury segment. Maison Margiela increased 107% between 2019 and 2021, while Jil Sander broke even just nine months after joining the company. “OTB’s luxury brands are up 49% over 2020, and 55% over 2019. We continue to study new acquisitions in this segment”, Minelli told Repubblica.

Asia, the stock market

Driving revenue growth will be Asia. Japan already generates a quarter of the turnover of the group, which has planned to double its 80 shops in China in the next three years. “We plan to invest 300 million euros over the next three years. The expected growth is 20% year on year, thus reaching around 2.5 billion in turnover in 2024”, Minelli explained to Il Giornale di Vicenza. 2024 will also be the year of the company’s debut on the stock exchange. The CEO himself explained the Group’s growth as the result of “strategic choices, starting with having secured the supply chain financially in the most difficult times”.

OTB’s advantages

Minelli reiterated that OTB will not end up in the hands of a luxury group, but, on the contrary, “maintains the ambition of being a pole that aggregates luxury brands, I would say the only one in Italy. There is no desire to sell. Of course, the two French luxury groups are of a size that is difficult to reach. But we have advantages over them in terms of flexibility and speed of decision-making that we are trying to exploit”.

Here's the Reason Louis Vuitton Prices Are Going Up - Complex,"Wed, 16 Feb 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNvbXBsZXguY29tL3N0eWxlL2EvY21wbHhqb3NodWEtZXNwaW5vemEvaGVyZXMtdGhlLXJlYXNvbi1sb3Vpcy12dWl0dG9uLXByaWNlcy1nb2luZy11cNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Louis Vuitton goods have just become less accessible.

According to Reuters, the French fashion house increased retail prices globally on Wednesday, citing a hike in transportation and manufacturing costs. A spokesperson from LV China said the move will affect the costs of leather goods, fashion accessories, and fragrances

“The price adjustment takes into account changes in production costs, raw materials, transportation as well as inflation,” the label told the outlet.

Though the spokesperson didn’t confirm how much the prices would increase, Reuters pointed to a number of influencers who claim some LV handbags—such as the $7,323 Capucines and $1,890 Neverfull—will now be 20 percent more expensive. However, it’s worth noting that these sources did not provide any proof of that increase. PurseBop, a luxury bag market tracker, predicted a 4 percent increase on the low end, and a 15 to 18 percent increase on the high end.

LV—the biggest name under the LVMH banner—is the latest luxury house to boost prices during the global health crises. In late 2021, Chanel and Hermes hiked their prices multiple times in 2021. A spokesperson for the former label cited “unspecified exchange-rate fluctuations” as the primary factor.

Tag Heuer, another label owned by LVMH, will also raise its prices sometime in April. Some of its timepieces, with exception to smart watches, are expected to increase 5 to 6 percent in price.

According to Forbes, LVMH generated $71.5 billion in revenue last year, marking a 44 percent increase from 2020. The conglomerate attributed the rise to the success of its leather goods and fashion divisions, which are led by LV.

“Everyone is talking about inflation [...] I don’t expect such an economic crisis,” LVMH boss Bernard Arnault said during a recent earnings call. “We have just gone through two very challenging years. I’d rather think that things will continue to improve, but we have an advantage on quite a few other groups which is that we have a degree of flexibility on our prices. So in the face of inflation, we have the ways and means to react. And, I believe that demand will remain strong for our products.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9696681499481201}",neutral,0.9696681499481201,0

"Louis Vuitton Confirms ""Worldwide"" Price Increases, Citing Rising Costs, Inflation - The Fashion Law","Tue, 15 Feb 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWZhc2hpb25sYXcuY29tL2xvdWlzLXZ1aXR0b24tY29uZmlybXMtd29ybGR3aWRlLXByaWNlLWluY3JlYXNlcy1jaXRpbmctcmlzaW5nLWNvc3RzLWluZmxhdGlvbi_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Louis Vuitton will introduce price increases this week, the French luxury goods brand announced on the heels of recent confirmation from LVMH’s chairman that broad price tag hikes were in the works. Beginning on Wednesday, the price increases “will affect Louis Vuitton stores worldwide and cover leather goods, fashion accessories and perfumes,” a spokesperson for the brand revealed on Tuesday, noting that the boosts to prices will “vary depending on the product.” The increases come, per Reuters, as a result of increased “changes in production costs, raw materials, transportation, as well as inflation.”

Late last month in presenting LVMH’s full year earnings, chairman Bernard Arnault said that he believes the French luxury goods conglomerate “has enough wiggle room to raise prices” – which has been a common move across the luxury landscape over the past couple of years, in particular – “and to protect its margins in an inflationary environment.” He cautioned, however, that management has to “remain reasonable” when it comes to boosting prices of the group’s offerings in the year ahead.

In addition to Louis Vuitton, LVMH-owned watch brand Tag Heuer confirmed that it has price increases in the works. Arnault’s son, Frédéric Arnault, who serves as CEO of the Swiss luxury watchmaker, said in an interview on February 11 that the brand raises it prices “regularly” and that there will be price increases of 5 to 6 percent on most of the brand’s watch offerings in April. Elsewhere in the watch division, LVMH’s Hublot brand will introduce increases, with CEO Ricardo Guadalupe saying earlier this month that “rising raw material costs for gold and diamonds” will prompt the brand to increases prices across its range of watches by 3 to 4 percent in April or May.

Both of these confirmations come in the wake of LVMH Watches and Jewelry division president Stéphane Bianchi announcing a new structure for the Watches and Jewelry division, which consists of Bulgari, TAG Heuer, Hublot and Zenith, and the jewelry brands Chaumet and Fred, and a focus on higher-priced products. He told the New York Times that the “average price” of the group’s watches “is increasing every year.”

On the Fashion and Leather Goods front, Christian Dior – which is the second largest brand in LVMH’s top-revenue-generating division following only behind Louis Vuitton – is also expected to raise its prices in the not-too-distant future. In a note early this month, Bernstein analyst Luca Solca stated that thanks to the strategy that has been envisioned and implemented in recent years by CEO Pietro Beccari and creative director Maria Grazia Chiuri, Dior has “resonated with consumers and has been in recent years the hottest brand in the high-end,” which has come “hand in hand with continuing increases in pricing to further establish the brand’s high-end credentials.”

Dior has been implementing prices hikes for its bags, such as the Medium Lady Dior, which is up by almost $1,500 from 2019 (with a compound annual growth rate of 10 percent between then and now). Rising price tags are particularly noticeable in China, Bernstein states, where the CAGR for certain models, such as the Medium Lady Dior, amounts to 20 percent between November 2019 and January 2022.

Most recently, Jefferies’ analysts Kathryn Parker and Flavio Cereda revealed that Dior raised prices of some of its iconic leather bags on January 18, with price rises occurring “across all global markets and were lowest in the UK and highest in South Korea.” (In terms of mainland China, Parker and Cereda noted that the impact on price there was “close to the average,” making it so that “there was only a minor reduction in the China-France price differential.” They do not expect that this will continue to be “a future trend.”)

As for the bright spot of price boosts going forward, Bernstein states that despite existing rises coming from Dior, it still “offers the highest pricing upside,” particularly among the three brands that it puts at the top of the soft luxury pyramid (Hermès, Chanel, and Dior), as the Lady Dior bag, for instance, is still sold today at a 30 percent discount to its Chanel counterpart. Dior is also expected to thrive, in part, thanks to the aggressive price hikes that continue to be implemented by Chanel, which has increased the pricing of its classic models four times and more than 50 percent since the pandemic started, thereby, “bringing them in line with a Birkin/Kelly 2.” Not all consumers have been amused by Chanel’s enduring price hikes, with some claiming that its attempts to compete more closely with Hermès on pricing and distribution come without necessary increases in quality to command such pricing. This could prove to be a boon for Dior (and LVMH more broadly), should consumers opt to swap in Lady Dior bags for Flap bags.

And on a final note about Louis Vuitton, the brand did not specifically address whether strife among workers for the brand has impacted its rising “production costs” on Tuesday. The news of price hikes follow closing from reports form industry outlets on Thursday that “several hundred workers from three of Louis Vuitton’s 18 factories in France staged a walkout organized by the CGT and CFDT trade unions, demanding better wages and protesting against the changes in working hours proposed by the management.” In a corresponding statement this week, Louis Vuitton revealed that it “has offered an average [salary] rise of €150 per month, coupled with a reduction in working hours from 35 to 33 hours per week,” noting that it is “committed to preserving its employees’ “work-life balance.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9985653758049011}",neutral,0.9985653758049011,0
EcoBeautyScore Consortium launched to build global beauty environmental impact scoring system - CosmeticsDesign-Europe.com,"Thu, 24 Feb 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jb3NtZXRpY3NkZXNpZ24tZXVyb3BlLmNvbS9BcnRpY2xlLzIwMjIvMDIvMjQvZWNvYmVhdXR5c2NvcmUtY29uc29ydGl1bS1sYXVuY2hlZC10by1idWlsZC1nbG9iYWwtYmVhdXR5LWVudmlyb25tZW50YWwtaW1wYWN0LXNjb3Jpbmctc3lzdGVt0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The beauty majors initially announced plans to form the consortium back in September 2021​, with Henkel, L’Oréal, LVMH, Natura &Co and Unilever spearheading the formation. Executives from each company at the time told CosmeticsDesign-Europe developing an industry-wide environmental impact system was critical for the sustainable future of cosmetics​.

Now made up of 36*​ large and small companies and associations spanning four continents, the founding brands said the consortium was “truly global and inclusive”, ​though hopes were that even more companies and associations would join in time.​

“The Consortium is open to all cosmetics and personal care companies, regardless of their size or resources (...) All companies will benefit from the pre-existing work and are invited to contribute with their own experience.”​

*​EcoBeauty Consortium members as of February 2022​: Amorepacific, Babor, Beiersdorf, Colgate-Palmolive, Cosmébio, COSMED, Cosmetic Valley, Cosmetics Europe, cosnova, Coty, The Estée Lauder Companies, Eugène Perma, FEBEA, The Fragrance Creators Association, Henkel, IKW Beauty Care, The International Fragrance Association, Johnson & Johnson Consumer Inc., JUST International AG, Kao, L’Oréal Groupe, LVMH, Nafigate, NAOS, Natrue, Natura &Co, NOHBA, Oriflame, P&G, Paragon Nordic, Puig, PZ Cussons, Shiseido, Sisley, STANPA, Unilever.

Prototype scoring system by end of 2022​

The founding members said all 36 consortium members had now started to work together in thematic working groups to launch a prototype environmental impact footprinting and scoring system. These groups and all consortium members were working with, and would continue to work with, sustainability consultancy Quantis and consult external experts, including scientists, academics, and NGOs, throughout the process to ensure the system was “as inclusive as possible”.​

The initial assessment and scoring system prototype would be published by the end of 2022, with all work verified by independent parties, and used on a “strictly voluntary basis”​ by consortium participants and other interested parties. The brand-agnostic scoring system would firstly focus on a selection of beauty product categories but would have “global scope”​ from the offset, the group said.

Consortium members were aiming to achieve four key goals: to develop a common method for measuring environmental impacts throughout the lifecycle of beauty products; create a common database; offer a common assessment tool; and establish a harmonised scoring system.

Responding to ‘growing consumer demand’ in beauty​

The overall aim of the scoring system was to help provide beauty consumers with “clear, transparent, and comparable environmental impact information, based on a common science-based methodology”, ​according to the founding members. ​

Joachim Kremer, senior manager of global sustainability at Henkel Beauty Care, said it was important consumers could compare “like-for-life products across different brands”​ and make “informed purchasing decisions”. ​Alexandra Palt, executive VP and chief corporate responsibility officer at L’Oréal, agreed, noting there was “growing consumer demand”​ for greater transparency around the environmental impact of cosmetic products.

The founding members said the system would, importantly, provide “greater transparency”​ on all aspects of a cosmetic product – formula, packaging and usage. The launch was also timely, they said, given 42% of global consumers were interested in buying brands that concentrated on circular and sustainable practices, according to a recent report from the Capgemini Research Institute.

Recent consumer research from GlobalData also showed rising interest in carbon footprint claims and a more generally heightened concern around climate change​. One of WGSN’s beauty ‘personas’ to watch in 2023 was also ‘refillutionaries’​ – ethical consumers looking for alternative beauty products and business models that could drive positive change, including refills, recyclables and solid formats.

CosmeticsDesign-Europe highlighted the ‘Refill Revolution’ as a key beauty trend to watch in 2022​ as consumers across the EMEA region signalled they were ready to shift to refill models in beauty.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999923706054688}",neutral,0.9999923706054688,0

Arnault is the CEO of LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton, and the third richest person in the world with a net worth of $165 billion.

The French luxury guru is behind some of the biggest luxury fashion brands in the world.

LVMH Fundamentals

After reporting fresh sales and profit records last year, driven by booming demand in the US and China, the world’s biggest luxury group, LVMH, is nonetheless confident of continuing its fast-paced growth.

The Paris-based company announced recently that its revenues last year totalled 64.2 billion euros ($71.6 billion), breaking the previous record set in 2019 before Covid-19 lockdowns closed stores and kept shoppers at home. According to analysts, revenue was expected to be 62.2 billion euros.

In addition, the firm controlled by billionaire Bernard Arnault increased its dividend to €10 per share, a two-thirds increase over last year.

Despite lingering travel restrictions and store closures, Louis Vuitton and Christian Dior continued to attract affluent shoppers during the pandemic.

On the flip side, these top-tier brands have opened a gap between themselves and smaller independent brands that have lost market share and found it difficult to compete in an arms race of advertising and eCommerce.

Still, with wealthy customers returning to boutiques, the performance of the luxury giant exemplifies the V-shaped recovery experienced by most of the industry. Rising asset prices and a recovering economy fueled the rebound.

Bernard Arnault and the valuation of family wealth

LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton is the world’s largest luxury goods maker. Its chairman, the 72-year-old Frenchman is also France’s richest person.

The company had revenues of 44.6 billion euros ($51 billion) in 2020, which he controls about half of. Louis Vuitton leather goods, TAG Heuer watches, and Dom Perignon champagnes are among the products it sells.

Christian Dior, Dior’s luxury fashion house, accounts for 97.5% of Arnault’s fortune.

According to Dior’s 2020 annual report, he holds the shares through entities associated with Groupe Familial Arnault.

The family holding company of Dior is credited with all shares held by Bernard Arnault, along with its other holdings, in recognition of its founder and patriarchal status.

LVMH, the world’s largest luxury goods company, is controlled by Christian Dior at 41.2%, according to Dior’s 2020 annual report.

As per its 2020 registration document, the family holds 6.2% of LVMH, and these shares are included in the calculation of net wealth.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.8445699214935303}",neutral,0.8445699214935303,0

Ao Yun, signifying “flying above the clouds” in Chinese, is the first premium Chinese wine launched by the luxury group LVMH. Resembling its name, its 2018 vintage became the pinnacle of Chinese wine as it gained the highest score from international wine critics.

In a recent report published by American wine critic James Suckling, the latest 2018 vintage Ao Yun was given 98 points, the highest from the critic for any Chinese wine.

This honor came after Robert Parker’s Wine Advocate awarded the same wine the highest score of 95 in its first edition of “top 10 fine wines in China”, which is also the team’s first 95 score given to a Chinese wine.

First launched by LVMH in 2016, Ao Yun is a Cabernet dominated Bordeaux blend produced in remote and high-altitude Yunnan province. Ao Yun 2018 is a blend of 60% Cabernet Sauvignon, 19% Cabernet Franc, 10% Merlot, 7% Syrah and 4% Petit Verdot.

After tasting the 2018 vintage with Ao Yun winemaker Maxence Dulou in Hong Kong, Suckling rated the wine with 98 points and praised it “the greatest offering to come out of the country”.

According to Suckling, the full-bodied wine remains “fresh and vertical” on the palate, with depth and complexity of the nose that shows blackberry, ink, tar, earth, incense, cloves and black licorice and thyme.

Ao Yun’s winemaker Maxence Dulou recognised the 2018 vintage as his greatest effort in winemaking, “We had the rain at the right moment to allow the grape to ripen perfectly and finally the fall was cool and it ripened the grape, and it gave the identity of the terroir and the vintage,” he shared with Suckling during the tasting.

Ao Yun’s new single vineyard wine

Ao Yun 2018 is now the top rated Chinese wine, and the LVMH-owned winery is also releasing four single vineyard cuvees. (pic: JamesSuckling.com)

Suckling and Dulou have also reviewed four other yet-to-be released single vineyard wines of Ao Yun’s new project, where wines from the four village vineyards of Ao Yun are bottled separately, namely Adong, Shuori, Xidang and Sinong.

Around 1,200 to 1,800 bottles are expected to be produced from each cru, but they will not necessarily be bottled every year. For instance, Sinong was not bottled in 2018 as all wines from the vineyard are used in Ao Yun 2018, a blend of the four vineyards.

Among the four, Suckling has rated the Ao Yun Shangri-La Xidang Cru 2018 as the best among the single-vineyard reds.

Consisting of mostly Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc with 20% Petit Verdot, the Xidang Cru 2018 is said to have “first-class purity of fruit” with plenty of blackcurrant and dark berry character aside from “ultra-fine tannins” by Suckling.

For whites, he praised the Ao Yun Chardonnay Shangri-La Adong 2018 as “China’s answer to Chablis”, which demonstrated the high-altitude nature of the vineyards with a green apple and mineral character.

Previously, Edward Ragg MW, the Chinese wine reviewer for Wine Advocate, has also rated 2018 Ao Yun Shuori Village Cru a 94 points in the China: Fine Wine 2021 report. It is a blend of 48% Cabernet Sauvignon, 12% Cabernet Franc and 40% Merlot.

Ao Yun’s winemaker Dulou revealed that the four single vineyard wines will be released in the fall in Bordeaux. Prices will range from 40% to 70% of the price for Ao Yun, which is around US$275 ($2,145) per bottle.

Diego Della Valle commented: “I am not concerned, because the craftsmanship and know–how of Italian artisans isn’t transferrable elsewhere and it’s not in their intention to move them out of the country. LVMH is an example of this”. Tod’s owner believes that if “2022 continues as it began”, it could be a very profitable year for many, and he adds that the first few months of 2023 will show “the real potential of companies in the segment”. Meanwhile, Tod’s defeated Celine and, with a 1.8 million euro a year rent contract, will be able to open a store in Milan’s famous Galleria.

2022 and 2023

Social efforts, Sistema Italia, politics, Covid-19 and fashion and luxury. These are the topics discussed by Diego Della Valle, CEO of Tod’s Group to L’Economia del Corriere della Sera. The Marche-based entrepreneur is positive for 2022 (“If 2022 continues as it began, it could be a very profitable year for many”), while “the first few months of 2023 will show the real potential of companies in the segment”.

Diego Della Valle, LVMH and foreigners

A significant part of the interview was dedicated to foreign groups acquiring companies in Italy. “The important thing is to preserve these segments and their workers. It would be wonderful if they were acquired by Italian groups, but I am not concerned by competent foreign groups making the acquisitions”, he added. For example, LVMH (which owns 10% of Tod’s), French luxury giant that is investing in Italy and creating Jobs.

An Italian luxury hub?

“Some groups – says Della Valle -, could have joined forces 20 years ago, but many of us were too busy building our companies and focus on our product and growth. We didn’t have enough time, but now we do have the time and vision to explore such possibilities”. As was as requests for the government, Della Valle asks for the “maintenance of the country’s system, to guarantee a better reception of tourists”. He concluded by adding that “the need is to have a shared strategic goal for both government and companies”.

The Galleria’s store

Meanwhile, with an offer of 1.805 million euro per year, Tod’s was awarded, instead of Celine (1.555 million) and Samsonite (1.050 million), an 18-year concession for the old Bric’s store in Milan’s Gallery (249 square meters). As reported by Il Giorno, the auction’s base price was of 722,000 euro.

Highlights from Bulgari at LVMH Watch Week 2022 - The Peak Singapore,"Sun, 13 Feb 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXBlYWttYWdhemluZS5jb20uc2cvZmFzaGlvbi13YXRjaGVzL2J2bGdhcmktbHZtaC13YXRjaC13ZWVrLXBpY2NvbGlzc2ltby1zZXJwZW50aS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"01: Serpenti Misteriosi

Serpenti Misteriosi in rose gold, with diamonds, turquoise and rubellites.

“After several years of Octo Finissimo ultra-thin watches, we are entering the world of Piccolisimo — that is, ultra-small movements,” said Andrea Granalli, Bulgari’s sales director for high-end watches, during the brand’s live video presentation. The brand’s new self-winding Piccolissimo BVL100 is is one of the world’s smallest mechanical movements.

Measuring a teeny 12.3 mm in diameter and 2.5mm in thickness, the BVL 100 powers four Serpenti Misteriosi high-jewellery watches. Along with a bejewelled dial, the movement is housed in a container within the head of the serpent and is easily removable for servicing or placed upside down so the Serpenti can be worn the other way.

02: Octo Roma Emerald Grande Sonnerie

“Time is a jewel” is Bulgari’s theme for this edition of LVMH Watch Week, and they’re certainly making good on the promise. The Octo Roma Emerald Grande Sonnerie hows off the brand’s know-how in gem-setting as well as watchmaking. Its most complex timepiece, the four-gong and four-hammer Grande Sonnerie sounds the time via Westminster chimes either on demand, or on its own when in Grande Sonnerie or Petite Sonnerie mode.

Following an earlier all-diamond version, the latest iteration comes in a 44mm white gold case and glitters with 446 baguette-cut Zambian emeralds and diamonds weighing more than 30 carats.

03: Octo Roma Blue Carillon Tourbillon

Last January, Bulgari launched its first Octo Roma Carillon Tourbillon, a minute repeater housed in a sporty 44mm DLC-coated titanium case. This year, it follows up with a new version in a platinum case, again with an openworked titanium caseband for optimal sound propagation.

Here, the skeletonised manually wound calibre BVL428 is distinguished by its blue bridges, which match the blued titanium caseband. Melodiously signalling the hours, quarters and minutes when activated by a pusher at nine o’clock, the carillon chimes are created by its three-hammer and three-gong.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999991655349731}",neutral,0.9999991655349731,0
WILL LVMH ENTER THE METAVERSE? • MVC Magazine - MVC Magazine,"Wed, 02 Feb 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiOWh0dHBzOi8vbXZjbWFnYXppbmUuY29tL2VuL3dpbGwtbHZtaC1lbnRlci10aGUtbWV0YXZlcnNlL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Will the LVMH Group also enter the Metaverse?

As we have highlighted several times with dedicated articles, the Metaverse seems a real new frontier for brands. Following the pandemic, the market has naturally moved digital, and many brands continue to close physical spaces.

But even though it seems that everyone is entering the NFT, some are proceeding cautiously, among which LVMH chairman Bernard Arnault wants to get into the Metaverse in the right way.

The luxury boss and Europe’s richest man is in no hurry to capitalize on the latest digital trend, unlike Gucci, for example, which has dived into the virtual realm, selling virtual sneakers from $12 and investing in collaborations with The Sims.

On the other hand, Louis Vuitton still seems far from choices of this kind, preferring a waiting position.

In an annual presentation to investors, Arnault explained his position on NFTs, saying: “At the moment, we remain in the real world selling real products. Surely it is captivating, interesting, and fun, but we have to see the application of the Metaverse and NFTs. It could positively impact our brands if it’s well done, but it’s not our goal to sell virtual sneakers for €10. We don’t care. Although there may be more relevant applications.”

Therefore, a waiting position is to be planned calmly and extremely carefully, exactly as is customary for the group that to date has not yet appointed a Creative Director for Louis Vuitton.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.8195565342903137}",neutral,0.8195565342903137,0
