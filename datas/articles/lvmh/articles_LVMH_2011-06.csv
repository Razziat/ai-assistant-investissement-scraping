Just days after the video surfaced, Natalie Portman issued a statement saying she was “deeply shocked and disgusted by the video” and “would not be associated with Mr. Galliano in any way.”

Portman, who describes herself as being “proud to be Jewish,” is still the spokeswoman for the fragrance Miss Dior Cherie.

Fellow designer Isaac Mizrahi said that he hoped Galliano never works again.

“I was like, buh-bye,” he said back in March. “It can’t be tolerated.”

Galliano entered rehab for alcohol addiction after the incident.

His trial for public insult and anti-Semitic remarks is set for June 22."

"Marc Jacobs COO 'was fired for $20million financial fraud', not claims of sexual harassment - Daily Mail","Fri, 17 Jun 2011 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kYWlseW1haWwuY28udWsvZmVtYWlsL2FydGljbGUtMjAwNDc2OC9NYXJjLUphY29icy1DT08tZmlyZWQtMjBtaWxsaW9uLWZpbmFuY2lhbC1mcmF1ZC1jbGFpbXMtc2V4dWFsLWhhcmFzc21lbnQuaHRtbNIBhAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kYWlseW1haWwuY28udWsvZmVtYWlsL2FydGljbGUtMjAwNDc2OC9hbXAvTWFyYy1KYWNvYnMtQ09PLWZpcmVkLTIwbWlsbGlvbi1maW5hbmNpYWwtZnJhdWQtY2xhaW1zLXNleHVhbC1oYXJhc3NtZW50Lmh0bWw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Marc Jacobs COO 'fired for $20million financial fraud', not claims of sexual harassment



The former COO of Marc Jacobs, who claims he was fired for accusing a colleague of sexually harassing employees, was actually removed from his position for fudging the company financial results, court papers stated yesterday.

According to t he label, which is owned by fashion powerhouse LVMH, Patrice Lataillade falsely boosted the company's financial performance in order that he could claim a larger bonus.

Lawyers for Marc Jacobs International say that audits of the company finances found that Mr Lataillade's 'false and inflated entries' were in excess of $20 million .

Lawsuit: Marc Jacobs (right), pictured with co-founder and CEO Robert Duffy, have accused the label's former COO of cooking the company books

The papers read: 'Through his manipulation of MJI's financial performance, Lataillade was able to extract hundreds of thousands of dollars in bonus payments for himself.'

They said that 'he would not have received [the same bonus payments] had Lataillade presented the true financial performance of MJI.'

The court papers also allege that Mr Lataillade - whose position afforded him benefits including 'an annual automobile allowance of $10,000, annual round-trip airfare to Paris for Lataillade and his family, and additional compensation for tuition fees for Lataillade's children' - is yet to pay back a 2008 loan from the company of $60,000.

Mr Lataillade's lawyer denies all allegations made by MJI, arguing that the company was audited during the period in question.

The company also denied the former COO's claims that Robert Duffy, the company's CEO and Mr Jacobs' longtime business partner, made staff pole-dance for him, and took company funds for his own personal use.

Allegations: Patrice Lataillade claims Mr Duffy, pictured with Vogue editor Anna Wintour and Marc Jacobs, 'sexually harassed employees'

Mr Lataillade accused Mr Duffy in March of ' displaying gay pornography in the office and requiring employees to look at it; his production and dissemination of a book which photos of MJI staff in sexual positions or nude; [and] his requirement that an MJI store employee perform a pole dance for him.'

He insists that when he attempted to raise his issues, he was fired.

But MJI lawyers explained yesterday that staff had posed voluntarily for the book, which was created to raise money for breast cancer research and is available to buy on the company website.

Court papers at the Manhattan Supreme Court also stated that 'Lataillade was not subjected to sexual harassment or retaliation, nor did he ever complain of such conduct.'

Mr Lataillade, who had worked for the company since 2002 and earned $1million-a-year in his post, is seeking unspecified monetary damages for 'discrimination, retaliation and his mental anguish and humiliation.'

Powerhouse: Marc Jacobs' parent firm LVMH called Mr Lataillade's claims 'false'

A suit filed by his lawyers in March claimed that Mr Duffy 'uses company funds for personal expenses and does not censor what he does or says.'

It also alleged: 'There have been sexual harassment cases threatened or brought against defendants based on Duffy's conduct. Because Duffy (correctly) believed that he would not be punished for his conduct, it grew increasingly worse.'

The suit claims that when one alleged victim of Mr Duffy complained, the Marc Jacobs company lawyer told her that she needed a 'thicker skin'. Another, male, it read, was instructed to 'go home early and have a drink'.

Mr Lataillade's lawyer said yesterday that MJI's denial of claims that employees were sexually harrassed are 'surprising considering we have photographs, video and other evidence.'

The papers state that Mr Lataillade was fired 'for cause', but does not explain the reason.

Mr Lataillade believes that there is a link between an email he says he sent to senior staff at LVMH, 'summarizing the legal situation and the hostile environment,' and his sacking a week later."
"John Galliano in Paris court with jacket, no shirt; Designer to blame drugs for anti-Semitic words - New York Daily News","Wed, 22 Jun 2011 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5ueWRhaWx5bmV3cy5jb20vMjAxMS8wNi8yMi9qb2huLWdhbGxpYW5vLWluLXBhcmlzLWNvdXJ0LXdpdGgtamFja2V0LW5vLXNoaXJ0LWRlc2lnbmVyLXRvLWJsYW1lLWRydWdzLWZvci1hbnRpLXNlbWl0aWMtd29yZHMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"John Galliano showed up for his anti-Semitism trial as only he would – in theatrical style.

The disgraced former Christian Dior creative director, 50, arrived Wednesday at the courthouse in Paris in a somber black jacket and vest, gray slacks and a loosely tied polka dot scarf around his neck.

His hair, often worn in braids, hung limply around his shoulders.

He declined to wear a shirt under his vest for the occasion.

FASHION’S MOST COLORFUL CHARACTERS

Journalists and spectators packed the court to see the famed designer, who has been absent from sight since he was fired from Dior in February following accusations that he assaulted Paris café-goers with anti-Semitic slurs and announced he “loved Hitler.”

According to court documents, Galliano allegedly called Geraldine Bloch, a 35-year-old art curator at the Arab World Institute in Paris, “a dirty whore”with a “dirty Jewish face” with “revolting” eyebrows and “low-end boots and low-end thighs.”

She also alleges that he called her boyfriend an “Asian bastard.”

According to the Telegraph, the designer told the court that he had a “triple addiction” to Valium, Ambien and alcohol and that he remembered nothing from that fateful night.

He admitted to popping anti-depressants “like candy.”

According to his attorney, he claims to remember nothing about the night in question or having ever spouted anti-Semitic insults.

Before he entered drug treatment in Arizona and Switzerland, Galliano issued a statement after the alleged incident, saying that “anti-Semitism and racism have no part in our society. I unreservedly apologize for my behavior in causing any offence.”

Galliano is charged with “public insults based on origin, religious affiliation, race or ethnicity” and could face up to six months in prison and EUR22,500 ($32,500) in fines.

Bloch, who is suing for just one Euro, told the court on Wednesday that she “didn’t want this incident to create such a media storm. I just thought I had no other choice,” according to the Telegraph.

His alleged habit of spouting vile hate speech while under the influence of drugs sank the designer’s once-vibrant career at the chief designer at the storied House of Dior and as the designer of his own line of high-end theatrical and outlandish designs.

The verdict will not come on Wednesday but at a later date."
