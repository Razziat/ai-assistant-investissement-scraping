LVMH Counts On Sephora for Growth as Louis Vuitton Slows - The Business of Fashion,"Mon, 03 Jun 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzb2ZmYXNoaW9uLmNvbS9uZXdzL25ld3MtYW5hbHlzaXMvbHZtaC1jb3VudHMtb24tbGlwc3RpY2stZm9yLWdyb3d0aC1hcy1oYW5kYmFnLXNhbGVzLXNsb3cv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS, France — Justine Le Sassier wouldn't be caught dead buying a Louis Vuitton handbag.

“They don’t have any appeal,” the 18-year-old art student said of the label’s $1,340 monogrammed handbags while shopping on the Champs Elysees in Paris.

Happily for Vuitton’s owner, LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SA, Le Sassier is crazy about the 13.90 euro ($18) foundation sold by Sephora, the company’s fast-growing fragrance and cosmetics retailer. “I love their makeup,” she said. “And it’s reasonably priced.”

With Vuitton’s sales growth slowing from Barcelona to Beijing, catering to beauty buyers like Le Sassier is getting more important for LVMH. As shoppers curb spending on $940 Neverfull bags while splurging on $31 Dior Addict lipsticks, Sephora will help LVMH’s Selective Retailing unit overtake fashion and leather goods as its biggest business by 2018, Sanford Bernstein estimates. That leaves LVMH better placed than rivals such as PPR SA to weather stagnating luxury demand.

“Sephora is a category killer,” said Sanford Bernstein analyst Mario Ortelli. Investors concerned that sales of the Vuitton brand will keep fading are “overcautious about LVMH.”

The owner of more than 60 brands -- from Dom Perignon champagne to Bulgari jewelry -- LVMH in April reported its weakest fashion and leather goods sales in more than three years. Its shares are down 1.6 percent in Paris this year, versus a 19 percent advance for PPR and and a 20 percent gain for Cie. Financiere Richemont SA.

LVMH’s Selective Retailing division, which includes Paris department store Le Bon Marche and duty-free shop operators DFS and Miami Cruiseline Services, accounted for 28 percent of 2012 sales.

Ortelli recommends buying LVMH shares and holding PPR. LVMH revenue is set to advance 7.5 percent this year, according to estimates compiled by Bloomberg. That’s faster than the 5.2 percent growth analysts predict for PPR.

Sephora is introducing services such as mobile payments and enlarging its own-label assortment to keep shoppers spending. It’s also expanding in Latin America and Asia, aiming to attract middle class consumers driving growth in emerging markets.

PPR, by contrast, is getting out of mass retail. The company aims to spin off its Fnac media and electronics chain and dispose of online fashion seller La Redoute this year. It’s also closing stores at sporting-goods maker Puma SE as it combats declining non-luxury sales.

LVMH’s Selective Retailing division will have annual sales of 14.7 billion euros in 2017, Sanford Bernstein estimates. The unit’s 13 percent compound annual revenue growth, fueled by Asian and Latin American shoppers, is almost double the brokerage’s estimate for LVMH’s fashion and leather-goods’ business and about three times Euromonitor’s forecast for luxury overall.

Slowing luxury demand isn't unique to LVMH. After binging on goods from Rolex watches to Hermes Birkin bags, shoppers have cut spending as the economy splutters. Consumption is weaker in Europe, Taiwan and Korea and ""China isn't as buoyant as it was two years ago,"" PPR Chief Financial Officer Jean-Marc Duplaix said in April after its Gucci brand reported its slowest sales growth since 2009, excluding currency swings.

Yet Sephora and DFS keep growing. New stores in Shanghai and Hong Kong fueled a 17 percent gain in first-quarter comparable sales at the Selective-Retailing division as the region’s nascent middle class splurged on goods like Bobby Brown cosmetics and Johnnie Walker whisky. LVMH declined to make executives available to discuss the business.

Providing a broad range of skincare and fragrances has been key to Sephora’s success since it was founded in 1969. Acquired by LVMH in 1997, it has become the world’s biggest beauty retailer, with about 1,300 shops in 27 countries. Sephora plans to open about 120 stores a year through 2017, Sanford Bernstein estimates.

There’s no multibrand competitor that covers as many regions as Sephora, and rivals such as Ulta in the U.S. and Nocibe SA in France lack the resources it enjoys with backing from LVMH. Sephora has 27 percent of the beauty retail market in France, 12 percent in the U.S. and 15 percent in China, Sanford Bernstein says.

At Sephora’s outlet on the Champs Elysees, products such as 30.30-euro Dior “Iconic” false eyelashes sit a row down from the retailer’s house-label 9.90-euro extensions. Well-known brands, loyalty cards and services such as nail bars near the entrance lure shoppers inside, while arranging merchandise by category lets clients choose from similar products at a wide range of prices.

“Their business model is very clever,” said Joel Palix, president of Clarins Fragrance Group, which distributes its Thierry Mugler scents through Sephora. Stocking exclusive products means Sephora can limit discounts, while private-label merchandise yields high margins, he said.

It’s a similar story at DFS. The company was founded in the 1960s, and LVMH bought a stake in 1996. Today, the retailer distributes more than 100 brands, from Juicy Couture to Absolut vodka, in 14 countries. New and upgraded stores at airports and in downtown shopping districts, where travelers can buy goods and claim back value added tax when they leave the country, mean “DFS is well positioned to benefit from growth in Asian tourism,” said Magali Dubreil, an analyst at researcher Planet Retail.

While Selective Retailing’s earnings before interest and tax will expand 24 percent annually through 2017, three times the pace of LVMH’s fashion and leather goods’ division, according to Sanford Bernstein, it’s less profitable than other parts of the company. Vuitton alone accounted for more than half LVMH’s 5.9 billion euros of Ebit in 2012, Exane BNP Paribas estimates. Selective Retailing’s profit was 854 million euros last year -- 14 percent of LVMH’s total.

Still, Sephora and DFS’s mass-market appeal makes LVMH an attractive investment as Vuitton raises prices, uses more leather in its collections and limits store expansion in a bid to appear more exclusive, says Exane BNP Paribas analyst Luca Solca.

Fragrances and cosmetics are the primary tool for attracting aspirational consumers, said Solca. As lipstick costs a hundredth the price of a Vuitton handbag and a thousandth of a Hublot watch, “fragrances and cosmetics are the luxury of the masses,” he said.

Hermès buckles down for final battle with LVMH in France's 'handbag war' - The Guardian,"Sun, 09 Jun 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy8yMDEzL2p1bi8wOS9oZXJtZXMtbG91aXMtdnVpdHRvbi1mcmFuY2UtaGFuZGJhZy13YXItYXJuYXVsdNIBYGh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy8yMDEzL2p1bi8wOS9oZXJtZXMtbG91aXMtdnVpdHRvbi1mcmFuY2UtaGFuZGJhZy13YXItYXJuYXVsdA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"When French luxury goods firm Hermès threw down the gauntlet – a hand-stitched top-grain leather one, of course – to rival Louis Vuitton Moët Hennessy in 2010, it might have been hoping for a discreet, gentlemanly outcome. Instead, the challenge sparked years of public squabbling that in the refined circles inhabited by its wealthy clients could be defined as most ungenteel. Now, having raged for three years, the Gallic ""handbag war"" is entering a new phase.

In the next few weeks, the French authorities are expected to rule on the bitter dispute between the two firms. Did LVMH sneakily and with great subterfuge attempt a creeping takeover of Hermès when it obtained shares in the company using cash-settlement equity swaps and, it is claimed, subsidiaries? If so, it could face a fine of up to €10m.

Or has Hermès, anxious to remain family-run and independent, engaged in a snobbish and condescending ""slander and smear"" campaign against its bigger, brasher rival? If so, the company that referred to LVMH boss Bernard Arnault, France's richest man, as an ""intruder in the garden"" (adding ""we don't want him in the house"") will have to learn to live with its uninvited and unwanted guest.

If the buoyant luxury goods market, which appears to be bucking the recession, was not so important to France's struggling economy, the handbags-at-dawn standoff between two of the country's most prestigious brands might be mildly amusing.

Its first customer may have been a horse, but Hermès has come a long way from its relatively humble beginnings as a harness and bridle shop for European nobles. This is the company that made scarves for Queen Elizabeth II and Jackie Onassis– who decorated her walls with them – and boots for the former shah of Iran, and created the once-ubiquitous ""Kelly"" bag, named for Princess Grace of Monaco.

Hermès, which has gone from strength to strength in recent years, and posted a record-breaking profit of €740m in 2012, on a €3.48bn turnover, is also purveyor of the ultimate ""it"" bag, the Birkin – named after British singer Jane Birkin – whose price can match that of a luxury car and whose exclusiveness has survived reports that queen of bling Victoria Beckham has 100 of them in her closet.

Not that Hermès talks about its customers. For a firm that considers its hand-stitched, hand-crafted goods the ne plus ultra of refinement, good taste and timeless luxury, such a lack of discretion would be downright vulgar. Hermès makes no secret of considering itself several cuts above Louis Vuitton. The right-of-centre Le Figaro newspaper reported that the Hermès family has ""always had a condescending view of Louis Vuitton and its bags of coated canvas"".

Asked once why Hermès shunned initials, Xavier Guerrand-Hermès, great-great-grandson of Thierry Hermès, who opened the first harness shop in Paris in 1837, retorted: ""If someone knows us, they will know us.""

To the Hermès clan, LVMH is a brash upstart, as is Arnault, a close friend of former president Nicolas Sarkozy, also viewed as a parvenu. The stable of firms in Arnault's empire, acquired often by snapping up small, dispute-riven companies, includes Moët & Chandon, the world's largest champagne house, as well as Givenchy, Guerlain, Marc Jacobs and Céline.

In 2010, when the French stock-market watchdog, the AMF, announced its investigation into how Arnault acquired his 17% of Hermès shares, it warned it would be ""long, difficult and very complex"". The inquiry has sparked three years of claims and counter-claims between the luxury giants.

A leaked AMF report carried in Le Monde claimed LVMH, which has since built up its holding to 22.6%, had been increasing its stake in Hermès since 2001 through subsidiaries using the code name Mercure, investing amounts too small to require disclosure. LVMH said it would ""vigorously"" contest the claims.

Last July, Hermès launched a lawsuit ""contre X"" – against unknown persons – for insider trading and complicity in insider trading. LVMH countersued for ""blackmail, false accusation and unfair competition"".

Patrick Thomas, joint chief executive of Hermès, told French journalists that LVMH's emergence as a shareholder was neither ""desired, nor desirable"" and was against stock exchange rules: ""The small Hermès shareholders would not have sold [their shares] had they known LVMH was behind the attack."" At a final hearing at the end of May, the two sides were still slugging it out. The AMF's decision is expected by the end of June.

Thomas, who will hand over the reins to Axel Dumas, 42, a sixth-generation member of the Hermès family, told French news channel BFMTV: ""We must not have someone who is a rival and perhaps a threat holding too-significant capital. From the beginning we have said that the way that LVMH got into Hermès is, and I'm measuring my words, illicit."" Thomas has even suggested that LVMH's withdrawal from Hermès is ""in the interests of France"".

LVMH has repeatedly argued that its actions were perfectly legal. Vice-president Pierre Godé said: ""It is not for a publicly listed company to ask whether it likes its shareholders or not. LVMH is a shareholder and asks to be treated like any other.""","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9979246854782104}",neutral,0.9979246854782104,0

Bernard Arnault still wealthiest wine owner in France - Decanter.com,"Sat, 15 Jun 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlY2FudGVyLmNvbS93aW5lLW5ld3MvYXJuYXVsdC1zdGlsbC1mcmFuY2Utcy1yaWNoZXN0LTE4MjM4L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Bernard Arnault of LVMH – owner of Hennessy, Moët et Chandon and Chateau Yquem – continues to head up the list of wealthiest wine owners in France, according to the second annual roundup published in Challenges magazine this week.

Picture: Bernard Arnault

His fortune is listed at €1.5 billion, a slight rise from last year due to the appreciation in the value of his vines. Arnault (through LVMH) also owns half of Chateau Cheval Blanc with his friend and business associate Albert Frère, the wealthiest man in Belgium.

The Castel family, headed up by Pierre Castel and owners of Castel Freres and 50% of Chateau Beychevelle, Chateau Beaumont, négociant company Barrière Frères and wine merchants Nicolas is listed in second place, with a fortune of €875 million.

Coming in third is Frédéric Rouzaud of Champagne Roederer, owner of Chateau Pichon Longueville among others, with an €800 million fortune, just in front of Philippine de Rothschild of Mouton Rothschild with €750 million.

Francois Pinault of Chateau Latour, Chateau Grillet and Domaine d’Eugénie comes in sixth at €700 million, with fellow First Growth owner Corinne Mentzelopoulos of Chateau Margaux at number 6, with an estimated fortune of €600 million.

The rest of the top 10 places go to Christian and Jean-Francois Moeuix (counted together, although their companies are in fact separate) with €550 million, Bernard Magrez of Chateau Pape Clement with €525 million, and Michel Reybier of Cos d’Estournel with Benjamin de Rothschild, of Chateau Clarke, each listed with a fortune of €450 million.

Each owner within the top 10 has seen a rise in estimated net worth over the past 12 months, due to the rises in land values seen in their appellations.

The Challenges article lists the top 50 wine-related fortunes, and other notable figures include Gerard Perse of Chateau Pavie at 12 (€375 million), Jean-Hubert Delon of Léoville Las Cases at 14 (€320 million) and Jean-Michel Cazes of Lynch Bages in 20th spot (€260 million).

Baron Eric de Rothschild of Chateau Lafite Rothschild makes an appearance at number 24, alongside both Jean Merlaut of Gruaud Larose and Martin and Olivier Bouygues of Chateau Montrose, all with an estimated net worth of €260 million.

At the lower reaches of the Top 50 come Daniel and Florence Cathiard of Smith Haut Lafitte at 45 with €170 million, and Didier Cuvelier of Léoville Poyferré at number 50 with a mere €145 million.

"Dolce & Gabbana, LVMH vs Hermes and the Chinese auto market: This Week in Luxury - Pursuitist","Thu, 20 Jun 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vcHVyc3VpdGlzdC5jb20vZG9sY2UtZ2FiYmFuYS1sdm1oLXZzLWhlcm1lcy1hbmQtdGhlLWNoaW5lc2UtYXV0by1tYXJrZXQtdGhpcy13ZWVrLWluLWx1eHVyeS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Earlier this week, Stefano Gabbana and Domenico Dolce, founders and creative designers of the namesake brand, were found guilty by Italian courts for tax evasion. In 2004, the D&G line was sold to a Luxembourg holding company, a move that the prosecution argued was done solely to avoid paying Italian taxes. The court ruling, which is expected to be appealed, sentenced the two to prison for 20 months. Alfonso Dolce, Cristiana Ruella and Giuseppe Minoni were each sentenced to 16 months.

Meanwhile, LVMH and Hermes are continuing to play out their courtroom saga, with the later filing another lawsuit against the luxury conglomerate. Hermes’ claim aims to annul the equity swaps that allowed LVMH to acquire its initial 12 percent stake in Hermes using a series of complex financial instruments in accumulations below mandatory disclosure thresholds for public companies, according to WWD.

To add, LVMH filed a suit against Hermes accusing of allegedly swaying an investigation by Autorite des Marches Financiers, which recommended LVMH be fined $13.3 million.

LVMH currently has a 22.6 percent stake in Hermes, which is the second-highest share by a non-family member. Though LVMH repeatedly claims its increased stakes are friendly, Hermes is very public about the opposite opinion.

Meanwhile, General Motors says that it aims to increase its share of China’s luxury auto market to 10 percent by 2020. The company has been trying to reposition Cadillac as a luxury brand for some time, and is toning down the look of the cars to woo Chinese buyers. According to the chief GM exec Dan Akerson, Chinese luxury auto buyers will account for up to 40 percent of the world’s total luxury auto market by 2020. Cadillac mainly competes with BMW, Mercedes and Audi for Chinese attention.

Finally, Alexander McQueen is expanding awareness and possibly aiming for a younger consumer base with a new deal with Proctor & Gamble Co. for a fragrance. The Prestige division of the company signed on to create a men’s and women’s fragrance business. Alexander McQueen previously developed fragrances in 2003 and 2005, but when L’Oreal acquired YSL Beaute in 2008, the Kingdom and My Queen scents did not make the cut, and were discontinued.

Her appointment has been welcomed by Vuitton's chairman and CEO Michael Burke, who told WWD : ""I am delighted to work again with Delphine Arnault. I have had the opportunity to appreciate her human qualities and professional skills in the past. Her intimate knowledge of the universe of our high-quality products and her experience at the helm of one of the most prestigious houses in the group are key assets to contribute to the successful development of Louis Vuitton in the world.

The executive position, which is titled 'diréctrice générale adjointe', is the largest sign yet that Delphine will succeed her 64-year-old father as chairwoman and CEO of the luxury goods conglomerate when he steps down.
