Alexandre Arnault, the son of Europe's richest man, is coming on board as an executive at Tiffany & Co. after four years as CEO of high-end luggage brand Rimowa, Arnault and Rimowa announced on Friday.

At Tiffany & Co., 28-year-old Arnault will be the executive vice president of product and communications, according to a press release. Tiffany & Co. is the newest acquisition of LVMH, the world's largest luxury goods maker, which is run by Arnault's father, billionaire Bernard Arnault. After a monthslong dispute, LVMH closed its deal to buy the iconic jewelry brand for $15.8 billion in October 2020.

Arnault announced his career move on Friday on Instagram, a platform he frequently uses to highlight new Rimowa products as well as personal news like that of his recent engagement to Geraldine Guyot, founder of French accessories brand D'Estrëe.

""I am now leaving the reigns of Rimowa to join Tiffany & Co in New York,"" Arnault wrote in the post. ""I am honoured to have been part of the Rimowa family.""

Bringing change to Rimowa

Arnault, who leaves Rimowa after four years as CEO, will stay on as the non-executive chairman of Rimowa, according to a company press release. In 2016, Arnault convinced his father to acquire Rimowa and spearheaded a modern reimagining of the 122-year-old German luggage brand, collaborating with trendy brands like Supreme and Virgil Abloh's Off-White. Last year under Arnault's leadership, Rimowa launched a bevy of new products including backpacks and sunglasses.

As Arnault told Business Insider in a phone call in November, ""Even before the pandemic, we thought that our products needed to be more part of people's everyday lives rather than just being at the airport or in the hotel room at the destination.""

LVMH has been led by his father, Bernard Arnault, since 1989. Bernard is the richest man in Europe by far and the fourth-richest person in the world, with an estimated $117 billion net worth, according to Bloomberg's Billionaires Index. In the early months of the pandemic, Bernard saw more than $30 billion wiped out from his net worth as retail stores were forced to close and LVMH's share price plummeted. But his empire has since rebounded, leaving his net worth $8 billion higher than it was before the pandemic.

The luxury goods empire is a family operation. In addition to Alexandre, three other Arnault children hold leadership roles at LVMH brands. Delphine Arnault, 45, is Louis Vuitton's executive vice president. Antoine Arnault, 43, is the CEO of Berluti as well as LVMH's head of image, communications, and the environment. Both Delphine and Antoine sit on LVMH's board of directors. And 26-year-old Frederic Arnault is the CEO of Tag Heuer. (Bernard's youngest son, Jean, is still in school, according to Bloomberg.)

Rimowa's new CEO will be Hugues Bonnet-Masimbert, Rimowa's former executive vice president of sales and client operations, who also spent 10 years at Louis Vuitton.

""At my side for the past three years, Hugues has been one of the primary artisans behind this success, and I am delighted to see him promoted to this new role,"" Arnault said in a press release.

Another Louis Vuitton veteran, Anthony Ledru, will take over as Tiffany's CEO, replacing Alessandro Bogliolo.

Arnault's first day at Tiffany & Co. in his new home city of New York City was Friday, according to his Instagram, where he followed his big announcement with a photo of his Tiffany employee badge.

The French global luxury powerhouse named Anthony Ledru, previously executive VP, global commercial activities at Louis Vuitton and formerly senior VP of North America at Tiffany, as CEO of the U.S. jeweler, effective immediately. Ledru takes the reins of Tiffany from Alessandro Bogliolo, who will remain with the company to facilitate the transition through January 22, 2021.

LVMH also announced that Reed Krakoff, chief artistic director, and Daniella Vitale, executive VP and chief brand officer, of Tiffany will depart the company after a short transition of responsibilities.

In other leadership appointments, Michael Burke, chairman and CEO of Louis Vuitton, will become chairman of Tiffany. And Alexandre Arnault, previously CEO of high-quality luggage company Rimowa, becomes executive VP, product and communications of Tiffany, effective immediately. He is the second eldest son of LVMH chairman and CEO Bernard Arnault

“I am pleased to welcome Tiffany and all their talented employees in our Group,”said Bernard Arnault. “Tiffany is an iconic brand and a quintessential emblem of the global jewelry sector. We are optimistic about Tiffany’s ability to accelerate its growth, innovate and remain at the forefront of our discerning customers’ most cherished life achievements and memories.”

In a statement, former Tiffany CEO Bogliolo said he was “honored to have led Tiffany as a public company and contributed with such a talented team to further strengthening Tiffany’s iconic standing.”

Thanks to the hard work and commitment of all our team members, Tiffany is ideally positioned to continue its growth,” he said. “I would also like to take this moment to thank Reed and Daniella for having led the creative vision, digital and marketing direction for the company. We can all be proud of what we achieved together over the past three years and, I am convinced that Tiffany will thrive under LVMH leadership. I look forward to ensuring a smooth transition to Anthony and his team and wish him and all the Tiffany community continued success in the years to come.”"
LVMH shakes up Tiffany management after $15.8 billion acquisition - CNBC,"Thu, 07 Jan 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tLzIwMjEvMDEvMDcvbHZtaC1zaGFrZXMtdXAtdGlmZmFueS1tYW5hZ2VtZW50LWFmdGVyLTE1cG9pbnQ4LWJpbGxpb24tYWNxdWlzaXRpb24uaHRtbNIBbWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tL2FtcC8yMDIxLzAxLzA3L2x2bWgtc2hha2VzLXVwLXRpZmZhbnktbWFuYWdlbWVudC1hZnRlci0xNXBvaW50OC1iaWxsaW9uLWFjcXVpc2l0aW9uLmh0bWw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"French luxury goods group LVMH on Thursday named two top Louis Vuitton executives as new managers of Tiffany and overhauled the design team in its first shake-up of the U.S. jeweller following a $15.8 billion acquisition.

The official closing of the deal comes after a bitter legal dispute, with LVMH backing away in the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic which hammered luxury goods sales. LVMH and Tiffany ultimately renegotiated the deal price, lowering it by $425 million.

LVMH said Anthony Ledru, a senior executive at the group's Louis Vuitton brand, would be CEO at Tiffany, taking over from Alessandro Bogliolo, who is set to leave on Jan. 22.

Alexandre Arnault, one of LVMH boss Bernard Arnault's sons and who previously ran luggage label Rimowa, will be executive vice president and in charge of product and communication, while Vuitton's CEO and chairman Michel Burke will also become chairman of Tiffany.

Analysts anticipate that once Tiffany is integrated into LVMH, the conglomerate will be able to expand its product ranges to target younger clients, and focus on a push in Asia.

LVMH, home to brands including Fendi and Veuve Clicquot champagne, is also expected to review everything from Tiffany's network of stores to strategies in areas such as online sales as it repositions the brand and streamlines it.

The conglomerate already signalled changes on the design front, saying artistic director Reed Krakoff was set to leave the company along with Chief Brand Officer Daniella Vitale. It did not name replacements.

""We are optimistic about Tiffany's ability to accelerate its growth,"" LVMH's Bernard Arnault said in a statement.

LVMH, which also owns Bulgari but makes most of its money from fashion brands like Vuitton, is hoping to beef up its jewellery offering with its biggest ever acquisition, in one of the segments of the luxury world which had the best growth prospects pre-pandemic."
LVMH Supercharges Management at Tiffany - WWD,"Fri, 08 Jan 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3dkLmNvbS9hY2Nlc3Nvcmllcy1uZXdzL2pld2VscnkvbHZtaC1zdXBlcmNoYXJnZXMtbWFuYWdlbWVudC1hdC10aWZmYW55LTEyMzQ2OTE1ODMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Now that LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton has completed its acquisition of Tiffany & Co., trust that luxury titan Bernard Arnault will take the necessary time and resources — financial and human — to catapult the iconic jeweler to the pinnacle of the sector.

The LVMH chairman is famously patient and determined, and freeing Tiffany of the scrutiny of quarterly financial performance gives him and his executives the ability to balance short-term initiatives with his long-term vision.

On Thursday, Arnault appointed a trio of LVMH executives — including his 28-year-old son Alexandre and Michael Burke, one of his most accomplished and trusted deputies — to lead the storied American brand, effective immediately. The third link in the chain is Vuitton executive Anthony Ledru, who has been named Tiffany’s chief executive officer after a career mostly in the U.S. jewelry business.

Bernard Arnault was expected to welcome 14,000 new employees to his luxury empire this morning, addressing the whole of Tiffany & Co. via video during a virtual town hall meeting.

According to sources, Anish Melwani, CEO of LVMH Inc. (North America), is to moderate the online gathering, with speakers including Chantal Gaemperle, the group’s executive vice president of human resources and synergies, and outgoing Tiffany CEO Alessandro Bogliolo, who has agreed to stay on until Jan. 22 to ensure a smooth transition.

Alexandre Arnault and Ledru are also expected to speak live and field questions from staffers.

In a welcome letter dispatched to all Tiffany employees on Thursday, Ledru asserted that the jeweler’s “potential ahead is limitless, and I am convinced that we will seize it together.”

“Joining LVMH will allow us to advance Tiffany’s strategy in a real and meaningful way,” Ledru wrote. “LVMH brings a unique and unparalleled know-how and ecosystem of retail excellence as well as resources that will help us accelerate Tiffany’s brand sophistication in a disruptive way across the product, communication and retail spheres.”

Beyond its financial might and management braintrust, the world’s largest luxury group has global expertise in real estate, retail development and CRM, gleaned from some 75 brands and 160,000 employees across fashion and leather goods, wines and spirits, perfumes and cosmetics, selective retailing and hospitality.

Tiffany now becomes part of LVMH’s watches and jewelry division, which also includes Bulgari, Tag Heuer, Zenith, Hublot, Chaumet and Fred.

As reported, Alexandre Arnault, CEO of Rimowa since 2017, is leaving the luggage-maker to become Tiffany’s executive vice president, product and communications, lending his strong digital acumen, Millennial perspective, marketing and branding know-how, and network of connections in Silicon Valley.

In addition to revving up Rimowa with zesty colors, buzzy collaborations, standout stores and new product categories, the young Arnault took charge in accelerating LVMH’s digital transformation.

Burke, chairman and CEO of Louis Vuitton, was named chairman of the Tiffany board of directors, bringing his extensive experience and strong track record in luxury to the task.

It is understood the new Tiffany board will include LVMH executives from headquarters and the North American division.

LVMH is also expected to make further executive appointments at Tiffany in the coming months in order to achieve its ambitions.

Also on Thursday, the group said Tiffany’s chief artistic director Reed Krakoff and Daniella Vitale, executive vice president and chief brand officer, would exit the company after a short transition period.

Bogliolo and Krakoff were widely expected to exit once the transaction was finalized on Jan. 7. The management swap doesn’t come cheap.

According to a regulatory filing on the deal, Bogliolo’s golden parachute — or payment tied to an exit following a takeover — was valued at $48.4 million in cash, equity and prerequisites. Krakoff’s package was said to be of similar size, although the paperwork doesn’t single out his compensation specifically.

Mark Erceg, executive vice president and chief financial officer, was set to receive a package of $17.4 million and Vitale’s parachute totaled $8.1 million.

WWD had identified Ledru as a frontrunner in a report on Dec. 30, and signaled that Alexandre Arnault was also in the management frame.

Ledru is currently Vuitton’s executive vice president, global commercial activities. The Frenchman has logged most of his luxury career in the U.S. jewelry business, rising through the ranks at Cartier over a 12-year-career to become vice president of retail until moving over to Harry Winston as global vice president of sales in 2011.

In fact, Ledru first joined Vuitton as president and CEO of its North American business in December 2014 from Tiffany & Co., where he spent a little under two years as senior vice president, North America, which is Tiffany’s largest market, generating about 43 percent of sales.

The tall, suave executive is said to have played a key role in spearheading Vuitton’s unique approach to customer experiences, and shaped the voice and strategy of the megabrand in North America and at headquarters.

Ledru said he is “delighted to rejoin Tiffany, the most iconic American luxury brand which I have long admired.”

“The inclusiveness and optimism upon which Tiffany was founded resonate now more than ever. I also come back to a maison that is at the forefront of the environmental and sourcing standards in its industry,” he added. “Going forward, I have deep confidence in LVMH’s commitment to protect the brand, drive its growth strategy and apply the highest standards of retail excellence to Tiffany.”

Indeed, LVMH is expected to spiff up Tiffany boutiques and rethink the in-store experience; renew its product range across the jewelry, accessories, fragrance and watch categories, and rev up communications to express the brand’s blend of heritage and modernity.

In a statement, Bernard Arnault struck a warm and bullish tone: “We are committed to supporting Tiffany, a brand that is synonymous with love and whose Blue Box is revered around the world, with the same dedication and passion that we have applied to each of our prestigious maisons over the years.

“We are optimistic about Tiffany’s ability to accelerate its growth, innovate and remain at the forefront of our discerning customers’ most cherished life achievements and memories. I would like to thank Alessandro Bogliolo and his team for their dedication to Tiffany and their work over the past three years, especially during this challenging period,” he added.

LVMH has a strong track record of grooming executives and recruiting from within whenever a big role opens up, rarely poaching from luxury rivals for CEO roles. The current CEOs at Dior, Fendi, Givenchy and Loewe, for example, all rose through the ranks of either Dior or Vuitton.

To wit: Separately on Thursday, LVMH promoted Rimowa executive Hugues Bonnet-Masimbert to succeed Alexandre Arnault at the management helm of that brand.

Installing Alexandre Arnault at Tiffany also reflects widening responsibilities for Bernard Arnault’s children, and echoes Delphine Arnault’s role as executive vice president of Louis Vuitton, in charge of all product-related activities. Antoine Arnault, CEO of Berluti and chairman of Loro Piana, last year added oversight of LVMH’s environmental department, in addition to his role as head of image and communications at the group, while Frédéric Arnault, the youngest executive in the Arnault clan, became CEO of Tag Heuer last year.

Alexandre Arnault graduated from École Telecom ParisTech and holds a master’s degree from École Polytechnique.

Before joining Rimowa after initiating and leading LVMH’s acquisition of the German firm, he worked at consultancy McKinsey & Co., then in private equity at KKR, both in New York. He then joined LVMH and Groupe Arnault to focus on digital innovation.

To be sure, LVMH will move quickly to grow Tiffany, which it contends has underperformed in a buoyant consumer segment.

Founded in 1837 by Charles Lewis Tiffany and catapulted to a higher plane by his son Lewis Comfort Tiffany, the jeweler has served the wealthy — both old and new money — ever since it was established. As of the end of March 2020, it operated 326 stores worldwide.

LVMH first agreed to buy Tiffany for $16.2 billion in November 2019 in what was billed as the largest acquisition in the luxury space. But that was pre-pandemic.

After the coronavirus began making its way around the globe, causing mass shutdowns, LVMH seemed to get cold feet. Last September, the French group said it was walking away from the deal, sparking a war of words and multiple lawsuits that threatened to derail the mega deal.

But by October, the parties reached a truce in order to avoid legal proceedings seen as harmful to both sides. At the end of 2020, Tiffany shareholders overwhelmingly approved an updated acquisition agreement calling for a $131.50 in cash per share purchase price, compared with the original offer of $135 a share. That amounted to about $420 million in savings for LVMH.

Despite an uneven performance earlier in 2020, Tiffany’s earnings shot up in its most recent quarter, which ended Oct. 31, by 52 percent to $119 million, beating out analyst expectations. E-commerce sale were up 92 percent during the quarter.

Among Ledru’s first challenges will be to galvanize Tiffany employees behind LVMH’s ownership and strategy, and smooth over any lingering acrimony among top brass who didn’t head for, or asked to head for, the exit.

Bogliolo joined Tiffany from Diesel in 2017 and sought to boost growth in China and through omnichannel initiatives while also raising average unit retail prices and accelerating product innovation.

Bogliolo and Krakoff were key in helping turn around the plodding Tiffany, modernizing the company with a focus on China, elevating the brand and expanding with The Blue Box Café, three distinct high-jewelry collections, and Tiffany Paper Flowers, which runs from fine to high jewelry.

It is understood that Krakoff is not being replaced, but that the company would operate with different design studios for different categories in keeping with how many of LVMH’s other powerhouse businesses operate.

Erceg, the CFO, told employees late Wednesday that he would leave with the change of power.

The leadership team walking out of Tiffany managed to steer the company through the pandemic — and through the bruising court battle with LVMH that ultimately led to a price cut in the deal.

While the springtime COVID-19 shutdown hurt Tiffany, the company was bouncing back in the third quarter and for the last two months of the year posted a 2 percent gain in net sales — marking the brand’s best holiday sales haul ever.

In a letter sent to Tiffany employees, Bogliolo thanked the company’s craftspeople, sales professionals, managers and employees.

“It was an honor to receive the baton from Mike Kowalski in 2017 and it has continued to be a privilege since then, filled with great challenges and invaluable rewards,” he wrote. “I am convinced that the Tiffany community is the most precious gem of this extraordinary jeweler, and I wanted to take this time to thank you all for your unwavering dedication and commitment to our legendary brand.”

Bogliolo said he met Ledru recently and “I am confident that his deep knowledge of jewelry, including Tiffany, and of the luxury sector at large will be instrumental in achieving long-term success.”

“I am very excited for what you will accomplish next with LVMH, and with great fondness I will be cheering you on,” he added."

LVMH head of corporate responsibility Karin Raguin: 2020 was a 'tipping point' for brand transparency - Glossy,"Wed, 27 Jan 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmdsb3NzeS5jby9mYXNoaW9uL2x2bWgtaGVhZC1vZi1jb3Jwb3JhdGUtcmVzcG9uc2liaWxpdHkta2FyaW4tcmFndWluL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Stitcher | Google Play | Spotify

Managing corporate responsibility for a global company with 160,000 employees can’t be easy, especially in 2021. But Karin Raguin, vp of talent management and corporate responsibility at LVMH North America, is rising to the challenge.

“All of the past year has been about people and safety, and well-being … and values … and how we enable people to shape their professional paths in a very meaningful way,” said Raguin, on the Glossy Podcast. “My job has not changed over the past year, but it has been accelerated.”

Raguin, who worked as a social worker before joining LVMH in 2007, said that 2020 marked a tipping point for LVMH, in terms of transparency. That was largely driven by the widespread social unrest following the killing of George Floyd. “There was an expectation [among] our employees and our customers for [us to provide] more direct communication about what we were doing. So, we were louder [about] our diversity and inclusion actions.”

Other accelerations included ramping up efforts to ensure employees’ mental health.

Here are a few highlights from the conversation, which have been lightly edited for clarity.

2020-driven transparency

“LVMH traditionally has not been very loud on culture and diversity and inclusion, not that we were not having action. But the past year has really been a tipping point, with the push for transparency. I think there was an expectation for our employees and for our customers for more direct communication about what we were doing. So, yes, we were louder [about] our diversity and inclusion actions. And especially after the murder of George Floyd, it has been a moment for everyone to pause and listen. And as an organization, we immediately organized focus groups and listening sessions. And the idea was really to understand more, to accelerate our efforts, and probably to communicate more internally and externally, and really support the Black community.”

On attracting diverse talent

“There’s talent everywhere, but recruiting is really a challenging action in that it’s incredibly difficult to reach the right candidate. And when I say the right candidate, it’s that — there is a lot of misconception [among talent] about luxury, fashion and beauty. And what we want to convey is, first of all, the diversity of the job. I mean, basically at LVMH, there is something somewhere for everyone. We don’t have one leadership style; we have multiple leadership styles. Even our brains are very different from a corporate perspective. And one tip that I would like to give, and especially to the early career professional, is to really go beyond the brand, go beyond the job title, meet people, go on social media, really understand the culture and find a corporate culture which really resonates with your own values. Because a career is not only your job, it’s really what brings you fulfillment in your day-to-day.”

Building toward gender equality

“LVMH was probably one of the first organizations to set a target for women in leadership positions. And when that started, more than 10 years ago, we had only 23%. And now we are over 44%, so we doubled in 10 years. And what I’ve learned from this journey is, first of all, the journey is not over. Second, it doesn’t happen organically. And third, intersectionality is important, because sexism, like racism, really [forces] structural change within the organization. And so everything is linked. But we are very proud of our progress. And I think that to be in an environment where women can grow their career is very much a source of pride for all women, but also for men. And actually, we are launching an allyship program, to really enable women to have male allies. We have a specific focus for women’s support to women of color. And we are also focusing on having women [who are] starting their career be mentored by more junior women. So yes, we are still on this journey.”

Prioritizing employees’ mental health

“[Mental health] is a starting point of everything; mental safety, emotional safety in the corporation — that is a starting point to being engaged in your day-to-day job and to really being able to bring your full self to work. So, yes, part of my job has been to provide additional support to our employees and to our brands. And over the pandemic, we have provided extra support for mental health. We have just done a pilot with Mental Health First Aid, which is amazing training that I strongly recommend to anyone who wants to support peers, colleagues and everyone who needs mental health help. And we had some sessions for HR, as well, because HR has been on the frontline for mental health. And that’s something that, sadly, is here to stay. And we are anticipating next year having this topic as a priority, because what we learned from the trainer and the therapist during our mental health HR session is that 30% of the population is going to experience post-stress disorder. So we really need the extra support on this, and corporations have a role to play in providing this safe resource. We are not here to fix people, but we are here to provide them support so they can get the help they need.”"
"LVMH gives Tiffany a makeover, promotes Arnault scion after $16B deal - New York Post","Thu, 07 Jan 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vbnlwb3N0LmNvbS8yMDIxLzAxLzA3L2x2bWgtZ2l2ZXMtdGlmZmFueS1hLW1ha2VvdmVyLXByb21vdGVzLWFybmF1bHQtc2Npb24v0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LVMH installed the son of company founder Bernard Arnault in a new leadership team at Tiffany on Thursday after the French luxury goods group concluded its $15.8 billion acquisition of the U.S. jeweler.

The conglomerate also picked two executives from its Louis Vuitton handbag brand to run Tiffany, and said it would overhaul the design team ahead of a makeover which analysts expect will focus on courting young shoppers and Asian customers.

The official closing of the deal, meant to boost LVMH’s standing in a segment it was less exposed to than fashion or spirits, follows a bitter legal dispute. LVMH backed away as the COVID-19 pandemic hammered luxury goods sales, but ultimately renegotiated a discounted purchase price.

Alexandre Arnault, one of four scions with roles at LVMH, who had already been stepping up his profile after previously running luggage label Rimowa, will be executive vice president at Tiffany, in charge of product and communication.

A fluent English speaker, the 28-year-old accompanied his father on a US trip to meet outgoing President Trump in 2017 shortly after his election.

Under his tenure, Rimowa paired up with sportwear brand Supreme for a collaboration and made a big social media push, a formula luxury groups have favored to draw younger clients.

In his new role, the young Arnault will work under two LVMH heavyweights, including Michael Burke, chairman and CEO at Vuitton – the group’s biggest money spinner – who will now also chair Tiffany.

Anthony Ledru, who ran Vuitton in the US as well as the label’s global commercial activities, will take over as CEO from Alessandro Bogliolo, who is set to leave on Jan. 22, LVMH said.

Ledru had a previous stint at Tiffany and has also worked for rival jeweler Cartier.

“The idea of pairing experienced managers with up and coming family members (and possible future leaders) creates a fruitful environment,” Bernstein analyst Luca Solca said in a note.

According to court papers from the legal battle, Bogliolo’s payout stemming from a change of control could top $44 million.

Analysts expect that LVMH, home to brands including Fendi and Veuve Clicquot champagne, will review everything from Tiffany’s network of stores to strategies in areas such as online sales as it repositions the brand and streamlines it.

The conglomerate said artistic director Reed Krakoff was set to leave the company along with Chief Brand Officer Daniella Vitale. It did not name replacements.

“We are optimistic about Tiffany’s ability to accelerate its growth,” LVMH’s Bernard Arnault said in a statement.

Tiffany’s last quarterly earnings indicated the retailer had recovered from some of the impact of the pandemic, with a 70 percent rise in sales in China and an e-commerce sales surge of 92 percent in the quarter.

LVMH will draw on its experience with jeweler Bulgari, acquired in 2011, where it has lifted margins and sales.

LVMH is unlikely to shy away from any moves to improve costs, although it also has the cash to invest heavily in marketing. It has praised Tiffany’s branding – the robin-egg-blue used on its boxes for instance – as a big strength."
"LVMH Acquires Tiffany in $15.8B Deal, Reshuffles Management - Yahoo Finance","Thu, 07 Jan 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9sdm1oLWFjcXVpcmVzLXRpZmZhbnktMTUtOGItMTc1NzE3MTE3Lmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton (OTC: LVMUY) shares were trading higher Thursday after the company announced it had completed its acquisition of Tiffany & Co (NYSE: TIF).

The deal makes this the largest acquisition ever in the luxury sector and is estimated to be worth $15.8 billion, according to Reuters.

LVMH's acquisition of the U.S. jeweler will transform LVMH’s watches and jewelry division and complement its 75 distinguished maisons, the company said.

LVMH also announced changes in management at Tiffany & Co. Anthony Ledru, previously executive vice president, global commercial activities at Louis Vuitton and formerly senior vice president of North America at Tiffany, becomes CEO of Tiffany, effective immediately.

Current CEO Alessandro Bogliolo has agreed to remain with the company to facilitate the transition through Jan. 22 this year after which time he will depart the company.

LVMH shares were trading up 2.58% at $126.07 at the time of publication.

Louis Vuitton owner LVMH officially adds lux jeweler Tiffany to its lineup - Inverse,"Thu, 07 Jan 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmludmVyc2UuY29tL2lucHV0L3N0eWxlL2x2bWgtdGlmZmFueS1hY3F1aXNpdGlvbi1vZmZpY2lhbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"In a deal valued at just under sixteen billion dollars, LVMH has acquired fine jewelry brand Tiffany. Now, according to Business of Fashion, the luxury company has already seen a reshuffling of roles thanks to its new acquirer. Tiffany’s new executive team will focus on making the brand even more exclusive and lavish to fit with the rest of LVMH’s labels.

The $15.8 billion deal joins a string of major company sales during the pandemic. In late 2020, we saw the $2.1 billion sale of Supreme, as well as Moncler buying outerwear rival Stone Island. The pandemic’s immense change in everyday life has consumers wanting a different kind of luxury, and brands have to adapt.

Renaissance — BOF reports that Louis Vuitton’s vice president of global commercial activities, Anthony Ledru, has been named Tiffany’s new chief executive, replacing Alessandro Bogliolo, who will depart later in January. The move makes sense, seeing as Ledru holds significant experience in luxury markets. Prior to running global commerce at LV, Ledru led global sales at Harry Winston and served two years as vice president of the North American market at Tiffany. He also spent much of his early career at Cartier, where he managed the brands’ U.S. retail network.

Ledru’s extensive experience shows that LVMH is hoping to boost Tiffany to a higher class. As BOF states, he’s intimately familiar with the luxury business, and would be capable of modernizing Tiffany to resonate with the next generation of luxury customers. Ledru will also be joined by Louis Vuitton chief Michael Burke, who LVMH appointed chairman of the Tiffany Board, and Alexandre Arnault, who will oversee management at the brand. That last name seems oddly familiar…

Family jewels — The Tiffany appointment is an additional position for 28-year-old Arnault, who is also the CEO of LVMH-owned suitcase brand, Rimowa — and son of LVMH Chairman Bernard Arnault. Now, before your cry nepotism, BOF claims that the young Arnault actually has a track record of reviving tired brands.

Arnault took the helm of Rimowa after the luxury group acquired a $774 million majority stake in 2016, said BOF, and successfully turned the fatigued German luggage label into one of the most desired status symbols on the market. Through cool collaborations with Virgil Abloh and Supreme, Arnault entirely revamped the once-dreary company. It seems LVMH is hoping he’ll do the same at Tiffany.

Both Ledru and Arnault have the ability to tap into LVMH and other luxury resources, which could help take Tiffany to a new level. Of course, we might consider that Ledru’s contacts come from years of experience, while Arnault might have to lean on more familiar faces. It’s important to note that in the past, Bernard Arnault has had a bit of a bromance with Donald Trump, and like his bro, named his own children for many leadership and executive roles within the LVMH company. Bernard appointed his son Antoine as CEO of Berluti, and daughter Delphine as executive vice president of Louis Vuitton. It’s a real family business."

Currently the elite luggage firm’s executive vice president of sales and client operations, Bonnet-Masimbert succeeds Alexandre Arnault, who is exiting Rimowa to become part of a new management trio at Tiffany & Co.

Early Thursday, Arnault was named executive vice president, product and communications, as LVMH closed its $15.8 billion acquisition of the iconic American jeweler, while Vuitton executive Anthony Ledru was named Tiffany’s new CEO and Michael Burke, chairman and CEO of Louis Vuitton, the new chairman of Tiffany’s board of directors.

LVMH has a strong track record of grooming and promoting executives from within, rarely poaching from luxury rivals for CEO posts.

To wit: LVMH said Bonnet-Masimbert would report to Patrice Wagner, chairman and CEO of Le Bon Marché Group, who will continue in that role while also lending his “expertise in products and creative activations, which has driven the success of Le Bon Marché,” the group said in a release.

Hugues Bonnet-Masimbert joined the LVMH Group in 1996 and has been a sales executive at Loewe, Celine, Louis Vuitton and Berluti before moving over to Rimowa in 2018. There he” initiated and oversaw the repositioning of Rimowa’s distribution, business model restructuring, along with the creation and rapid development of its e-commerce operations,” according to LVMH.

Hugues-Bonnet-Masimbert is the new CEO at Rimowa.

Arnault, who took the management helm of Rimowa in 2017 after initiating and leading LVMH’s acquisition of the German company, thanked his teams for applying their “energy, commitment and talent” to the brand’s transformation.

“The efforts made to elevate creativity, develop production resources and redefine the business model have strengthened Rimowa’s leadership,” he said. “At my side for the past three years, Hugues has been one of the primary artisans behind this success, and I am delighted to see him promoted to this new role. I know that under his leadership, Rimowa will pursue its ambitious growth itinerary and will come through the current period stronger than ever.”

Arnault jazzed up Rimowa’s technical luggage with new colors, buzzy collaborations with the likes of Supreme, Dior’s Kim Jones and Off-White’s Virgil Abloh, as well as unveiled a new store concept. He also expanded the brand into new product categories, including eyewear and soft bags.

Bonnet-Masimbert said Rimowa would “continue to determinedly drive operational, production and distribution efficiencies, keeping our German engineering heritage, innovation, creativity and craftsmanship at the heart of our DNA.”

Anthony Ledru will become chief executive officer with Alexandre Arnault being responsible for products and communications inside the brand, the company announced on January 7. Ledru leads global commercial activities at Louis Vuitton, and Alexandre is currently in charge of LVMH-owned suitcase maker Rimowa.

With Ledru, the French company is picking someone with extensive experience in the US luxury market to succeed Alessandro Bogliolo. Before his six years at LVMH, Ledru held key roles at jewellery brands including Harry Winston and Richemont’s Cartier . A Tiffany appointment in fact marks a return for Ledru: he managed the company’s US and Canadian businesses between 2013 and 2014.

Bernard Arnault, the billionaire founder of LVMH , has named his children to other key executive roles within his business empire in the past. His daughter, Delphine, is executive vice-president of Louis Vuitton, in charge of supervising all of the brand’s product-related activities.

LVMH shares gained 23 per cent last year and the conglomerate now has a market value of US$313 billion. That makes it the second-biggest company in Europe after Nestle SA.

Bogliolo will depart the company on January 22. Reed Krakoff, Tiffany’s chief artistic director, and Daniella Vitale, chief brand officer, will also leave.

Alexandre has run German brand Rimowa for the past four years. The 28-year-old, who is active on Instagram, presented a Rimowa case study to Harvard Business School students in February.

This year is set to be challenging for luxury companies as many regions struggle with renewed lockdowns to tame the Covid-19 pandemic. The industry is relying on demand from China to bolster sales

LVMH’s deal to acquire Tiffany won shareholder approval in December. The French company managed to get a small discount for its acquisition price for the iconic US jeweller after threatening to walk away from the deal. The purchase, worth US$16 billion, is still the biggest in the industry’s history.

Lessons Learned in the Tiffany Vs. LVMH Fight - WWD,"Thu, 07 Jan 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3dkLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy1uZXdzL21lcmdlcnMtYWNxdWlzaXRpb25zL2x2bWgtdGlmZmFueS1kZWFsLWJlcm5hcmQtYXJuYXVsdC1yb2dlci1mYXJhaC0xMjM0NjkxMzQwL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Bernard Arnault’s roughly $16 billion acquisition of Tiffany & Co. — at last nestled into the jewel box of LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton — is a master class in both mega dealmaking and how to brawl in luxury.

While the size of the deal (Arnault’s biggest) and the way it wove through the pandemic (and the French government) make it a singular transaction, there are some takeaways for other dealmakers and reminders that, when the stakes are high, the gloves can always come off.

And there could be plenty of chances to put the lessons learned to good use with companies sitting on billions of dollars of emergency cushion that could be put to work as COVID-19 vaccines open the world back up.

“Those who are survivors coming through the pandemic now are pressing their tactical advantage and M&A is part of that,” said David Shiffman, managing director and co-head of investment bank PJ Solomon’s global consumer retail group.

That includes both consolidations and moves to pick up new technologies, such as VF Corp.’s $2.1 billion-plus acquisition of Supreme or Lululemon Athletica Inc.’s $500 million purchase of interactive workout platform Mirror.

“You have a combination of strategics engaging the new economy, you have a return of the multibillion deal and we think there’s just more momentum,” Shiffman said. “You’re going to see more deal activity.”

Here, some guidelines for corporate battle in fashion, seen through the lens of the biggest deal in the last decade.

If You’re Going to Fight, Bring a Fighter

Arnault relentlessly built LVMH piece by piece, steadily consolidating much of the European fashion industry into a giant with a market capitalization of 256 billion euros that is feared, admired and emulated the world over.

He is said to have spent years coveting Tiffany, one of the very few true American luxury brands, and made his move in late 2019, pursuing and winning the company for $135 a share.

But deals are just promises and paperwork until they’re done and after the pandemic hit and social justice protests revealed a fractured market, LVMH grew wary about the company and the price it agreed to pay and ultimately tried to walk away in September. The initial reason given was an unusual request from the French government in the midst of a trade dispute with Washington, but the reasons seemed commercial at heart.

There was some recent precedent holding that one could walk away from a deal by making some noise — such was the case with Sycamore Partners, which dislodged itself from its agreement to buy control of Victoria’s Secret.

However, when LVMH tried to leave Tiffany at the alter, the jeweler’s chairman, Ralph Lauren Corp. veteran Roger Farah, was there, ready with a quick lawsuit and lobbying rhetorical bombs.

“We believe that LVMH will seek to use any available means in an attempt to avoid closing the transaction.…As we are not aware of any other French company receiving such a request [from the government to delay a deal], it is all the more clear that LVMH has unclean hands,” Farah said.

After much back and forth and just before depositions from the major players, including Arnault, were about to begin for a January trial, the two sides came back together for a deal at $131.50 a share, a 2.6 percent discount that saved Arnault about $420 million.

One dealmaker who declined to be named — they hate taking sides in public when they don’t have to — said: “Roger Farah was a rock star here, keeping one of the richest men on the planet in check. Arnault’s a guy who’s used to getting his way, he probably underestimated Roger Farah’s resolve. Arnault certainly didn’t get a huge discount relative to what he was hoping for. This is a good old fashion bar brawl, these are just bare-knuckled figures who are titans of industry.”

But Try to Keep It Private

When dealmaking becomes outright bloodsport and headline news, damage can be done on both sides with reputations, future deals and the potential business combination at stake.

Attorney Douglas Hand, cofounder of Hand Baldachin & Amburgey, said it would be better to keep the fight out of court if possible.

“Once you go to court and file the complaint, it’s public and the volley of negative statements on both sides about the other have been damaging, have eroded value,” Hand said. “So that is a tough needle to thread. How do you appropriately threaten without actual litigation?”

Arnault’s reputation as a savvy and hard-nosed dealmaker is certainly intact — and any number of brands and designers would love to be part of the LVMH empire. But even he might see some blowback down the line.

Hand said LMVH acquisition targets “are going to want future assurances…those might include things like broken deal fees where they get not only reimbursed for all legal and banking fees, but an actual punitive payment.”

“I don’t think the reputational damage supports it being a good decision to have done it so publicly,” he said.

And Be Ready to Bury the Hatchet

It wasn’t wholly surprising that LVMH and Tiffany avoided the actual trial and came back together, albeit at a lower price.

The strategic rationale — LVMH’s desire to expand in hard luxury and the big American foothold that Tiffany offered — was all still there.

So even in the heat of battle, it’s probably best to not go completely scorched earth.

“There’s a real, meaningful opportunity ahead,” said David Bassuk, global retail practice leader of AlixPartners. “These are two great powerhouses of luxury and on both sides, the consumer really has an appreciation for the brands. Some of these tough battles, you put that behind you and there’s a real win-win here. People recognize that there’s a big element there that, this is business and some of these are strategies for getting the deal done, and are able to put that behind them, shake hands and move forward. The long-term play here is these teams will put things behind them. It’s going to take some real leadership to tackle that.”

That now is a task for the company’s new executive team.

With the deal came a new C-suite that includes Louis Vuitton executive Anthony Ledru as chief executive officer; Arnault’s second-eldest son, Alexandre Arnault, as executive vice president, product and communications, and Louis Vuitton chief Michael Burke as chairman.

Anthony Ledru, previously executive vice president for global commercial activities at Louis Vuitton, will succeed Alessandro Bogliolo immediately as Tiffany’s CEO, LVMH said Thursday. Ledru is returning to Tiffany, where he was senior vice president for North America between 2013 and 2014. He has also held senior roles at Harry Winston International and Cartier.

Meanwhile, Alexandre Arnault, CEO of luggage company Rimowa and son of LVMH chief Bernard Arnault, will take over as Tiffany’s executive vice president for product and communications, while Louis Vuitton CEO Michael Burke will become the jeweler’s chairman.

Bogliolo — who has headed Tiffany since 2017 — will remain with the company until January 22 to help with the transition, and will then leave. Reed Krakoff, chief artistic director, and Daniella Vitale, executive vice president and chief brand officer, will also depart after short transitions.

LVMH closed the $15.8 billion acquisition Thursday following months of public disputes and threats of lawsuits. The deal will “deeply transform” LVMH’s watches and jewelry division, complementing the group’s 75 maisons spanning a range of luxury categories, the new owner said.

“I am pleased to welcome Tiffany and all their talented employees [to] our group,” Bernard Arnault commented. “We are committed to supporting Tiffany, a brand that is synonymous with love and whose Blue Box is revered around the world, with the same dedication and passion that we have applied to each of our prestigious maisons over the years.”

LVMH has witnessed a substantial recovery after a pandemic-ridden Q2, its worst-performing quarter with a 38-percent loss, before recovering to a six-percent group-wide loss in Q4.

The group's priorities for 2021 are to integrate Tiffany and continue its positive trends.

Once again, Louis Vuitton and Christian Dior seemed to have saved the day (or year) for their parent group, LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton.

The European luxury giant reported the financial results of its fourth-quarter and full-year earnings on January 26, showing it recorded revenue of 54.31 billion (44.7 billion euros) in the financial year 2020, down 17 percent from 2019.

Across the five business groups (BG), fashion and leather goods remain the most resilient, reporting 18-percent growth in Q4. This particular BG includes 17 fashion houses, including Louis Vuitton, Christian Dior, Celine, and Moynat.

“Louis Vuitton and Christian Dior each delivered double-digit organic revenue growth in the last two quarters. That would be a trend at any time, but even more so in 2020,” said the group’s head of investor relations, Chris Hollis, in a conference call with analysts. He added that Louis Vuitton’s recent new product lines, including Pont 9 and the 1854 canvas, were celebrated by customers. Meanwhile, the brand’s in-person shows in Shanghai, Tokyo, and Miami helped generate excitement.

Other positive news came from the jewelry and watches group, which saw the completion of the largest luxury goods deal ever with American jewelry Tiffany on January 7. The transaction took over a year due to jitters over regulatory approvals worldwide and a legal battle with Tiffany itself on the acquisition price. And in mid-January, it was announced that Alexandre Arnault, former CEO of Rimowa and the third son of Bernard Arnault, moved to a senior role in charge of products and communication for the jewelry brand.

Yet, some BGs witnessed fewer signs of recovery. Selective retailing, which includes the cosmetics chain Sephora and the travel retail leader DFS Group, reported a 31-percent decline for FY20. While the DFS Group has been heavily impacted by ongoing travel restrictions, the group said Sephora China’s exclusive livestreamed event Virtual Sephora Day was successful.

Overall, the group's revenue share from Asia (including Japan) inched upward from 37 percent in 2019 to 41 percent in 2020.

LVMH is readying for a recovery in 2021. “In a context that remains uncertain, even with the hope of vaccination giving us a glimpse of an end to the pandemic, we are confident that LVMH is in an excellent position to build upon the recovery for which the world wishes in 2021,” said Bernard Arnault, chairman & chief executive officer of LVMH, in a statement.

The company’s stock price rose by 3.26 percent to 127 a share at yesterday’s market close in Paris."

On Thursday, the luxury French conglomerate announced that its acquisition of the heritage American jeweler is officially complete, more than a year after its initial bid. To help implement its plans for the business, Tiffany is undergoing a serious executive overhaul that not only hints at what the industry giant hopes to achieve with the brand, but also how it plans to develop the next generation of LVMH-owner Bernard Arnault‘s family to join its top leadership ranks.

Notably, chief artistic director Reed Krakoff, who made Coach a multi-billion-dollar brand, and chief brand officer Daniella Vitale are stepping down from their respective roles in short order. LVMH scion Alexandre Arnault (formerly of Rimowa) is coming on board as executive vice president of product and communications along with Louis Vuitton’s vice president of global commercial activities, Anthony Ledru, who was named Tiffany’s new chief executive, according to a report from Business of Fashion.

BREAKING: LVMH has completed its acquisition of Tiffany — and is wasting no time shaking up the executive ranks of the American jeweller. https://t.co/3FqtyVmiyy — The Business of Fashion (@BoF) January 7, 2021

Ledru’s transfer from Louis Vuitton, arguably LVMH’s top brand alongside Dior, suggests that the group has serious goals for the purveyor of those famous blue boxes. But Ledru also has extensive experience in the fine jewelry business. Not only has he worked at Tiffany in the past, but he also once served as the lead of Harry Winston’s global sales and did a stint at Cartier. Insiders say that Cartier is the competitor Arnault most hopes to challenge with Tiffany as the brand is almost peerless in scale and overall stability, not to mention public perception. Ledru’s resume will prove instrumental in ensuring Tiffany hits its marks going forward. Considering its healthy business in China as of late, that is already off to a promising start.

Though publicly traded, LVMH is effectively run as something akin to a massive family business under Bernard Arnault’s control. The patriarch has strategically placed his children in leadership roles at different brands under the group umbrella as both a challenge and a means of preparing them to ascend to his role at some point. This summer saw the naming of son Frédéric as TAG Heuer’s CEO and Alexandre is the latest to take center stage.

WATCH

Just 28 years old, Alexandre has seen remarkable success with Rimowa, steering the brand in new, fashion-forward directions with multiple collaborations, like those with Supreme. But Tiffany is an even bigger business and the industry will be watching closely to see if he can repeat his accomplishment."

With legal battles and price negotiations settled, the French luxury titan has finalized its acquisition of Tiffany in a deal valued at $15.8 billion.



Tiffany delisted from the New York Stock Exchange Thursday as it prepares to move under LVMH’s umbrella of luxury brands.



“Tiffany is an iconic brand and a quintessential emblem of the global jewelry sector,” said LVMH CEO Bernard Arnault in a statement.



“We are optimistic about Tiffany’s ability to accelerate its growth, innovate and remain at the forefront of our discerning customers’ most cherished life achievements and memories.”



With the acquisition complete, LVMH is shaking up the jeweler’s executive ranks.



CEO Alessandro Bogliolo will leave the company Jan. 22.



Anthony Ledru will become the new CEO of Tiffany.



He is not new to the jeweler. He was Tiffany’s senior vice president of North America for a little over a year, from June 2013 to December 2014.



Most recently, he served as executive vice president of global commercial activities at Louis Vuitton and, prior to that, president and CEO of Louis Vuitton Americas.



Ledru also was the global vice president of sales for Harry Winston International.



He began his luxury career at Cartier in 1999, starting in Latin America and then moving to the United States, where he served as vice president of retail for the company’s North American business.



Tiffany Chief Artistic Director Reed Krakoff and Executive Vice President and Chief Brand Officer Daniella Vitale—the former Barneys CEO who joined the jeweler just a year ago—will also leave the company following a short transition period.



Alexandre Arnault, one of Bernard Arnault’s sons and former CEO of LVMH-owned luggage brand Rimowa, has been named executive vice president, product and communications of Tiffany, effective immediately.



He began his professional career in the U.S. in strategic consulting, at McKinsey & Company and then in private equity at KKR in New York.



Michael Burke, chairman and CEO of Louis Vuitton, will become chairman of Tiffany’s board of directors."
LVMH Appoints New CEO and Arnault's Son to Head Tiffany - JCK,"Thu, 07 Jan 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmpja29ubGluZS5jb20vZWRpdG9yaWFsLWFydGljbGUvbHZtaC1hcHBvaW50cy1jZW8tdGlmZmFueS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LVMH cleaned out the executive suite of Tiffany & Co. after it took over the company Thursday, appointing a new CEO and dismissing two high-profile recruits.

Perhaps not surprisingly, the new appointees are LVMH insiders, including a son of its chairman.

Anthony Ledru (pictured), who up until now had been executive vice president, global commercial activities, at LVMH-owned Louis Vuitton, has been immediately appointed Tiffany’s new CEO. He is also a Tiffany veteran, having served as senior vice president of North America from June 2013 to December 2014.

Prior to that, he worked at Cartier and Harry Winston, according to his LinkedIn profile.

He replaces current CEO Alessandro Bogliolo, who has headed the company since 2017 and will remain with the company to facilitate the transition through the end of January.

Ledru is the company’s fourth CEO since 2015, the year that its longtime leader, Michael Kowalski, retired. Kowalski briefly returned as interim head in 2017.

Alexandre Arnault, formerly the CEO of LVMH-owned luggage brand Rimowa, will become Tiffany’s executive vice president, product and communications.

He is the son of LVMH founder and chairman Bernard Arnault, and he has also worked at consulting firm McKinsey & Company, and at private equity firm KKR.

Michael Burke, the chairman and CEO of Louis Vuitton, will become chairman of Tiffany’s board of directors.

The company is also saying goodbye to chief artistic officer Reed Krakoff and Daniella Vitale, executive vice president and chief brand officer.

Vitale, the former CEO of Barneys, joined Tiffany in November 2019, after Tiffany initially agreed to be acquired by LVMH.

Krakoff, the former president and executive creative director of Coach, first joined Tiffany in 2017. He is the first person to hold the title of chief artistic officer at Tiffany, though he was widely seen as a replacement for its then-design director Francesca Amfitheatrof.

Since 2018, Amfitheatrof has served as artistic director for jewelry and watches for Louis Vuitton.

While not included in LVMH’s Thursday announcement, Tiffany confirmed a WWD report that Mark Erceg, executive vice president and chief financial officer, is also leaving. He has been with the company since 2016.

The long-running saga of Tiffany's (TIF) acquisition by LVMH Moet Hennessy-Louis Vuitton (LVMUY -1.91%) is finally over as the luxury design house announced today it has finally completed the deal for the high-end jeweler. And LVMH wasted no time upsetting the order of things, immediately moving to install its own executives at Tiffany.

Anthony Ledru, a Louis Vuitton senior executive, is CEO at Tiffany, effective today. Michael Burke, current CEO and chairman at LYMH, will become chairman of Tiffany. And the second-oldest son of LVMH head Bernard Arnault, Alexandre Arnault, will take over as Tiffany's executive vice president for product and communication. Two other Tiffany executives will exit the company soon after.

A diamond in the rough

The acquisition began over a year ago and was on pace for a smooth merger, but the COVID-19 pandemic struck, sending the deal spiraling into uncertainty.

Initially LVMH said it wouldn't try to buy Tiffany at less than the original offer price, $135 per share (or $16 billion). But as the crisis wore on and valuations were trashed, the relationship became icier.

LVMH tried to negotiate a lower price, saying the jeweler unnecessarily closed its retail stores. Wanting to force the deal to close, Tiffany eventually sued its suitor, accusing it of slow-walking the acquisition. Both sides eventually agreed on a $425 million discount on the price, or $131.50 per share.

Calling Tiffany an ""iconic brand,"" Bernard Arnault said, ""We are optimistic about Tiffany's ability to accelerate its growth, innovate, and remain at the forefront of our discerning customers' most cherished life achievements and memories.""

Tiffany's last earnings report in November showed sales had largely recovered, falling just 1% year over year, while crossing the billion-dollar threshold once more."
LVMH Finalizes Acquisition Of Tiffany & Co. For $15.8 Billion - aBlogtoWatch,"Fri, 08 Jan 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFibG9ndG93YXRjaC5jb20vbHZtaC1maW5hbGl6ZXMtYWNxdWlzaXRpb24tb2YtdGlmZmFueS1jby1mb3ItMTUtOC1iaWxsaW9uL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"After over a year of negotiations, withdrawals, lawsuits, and countersuits, luxury conglomerate giant LVMH has finally completed its purchase of iconic New York based jeweler and watchmaker Tiffany & Co. The main point of contention during the lengthy merger process has been the overall price of acquisition for the famous jewelry brand, set initially at $16.2 billion in stock buyouts. Over the course of a lengthy and often heated process that has seen both parties file lawsuits and LVMH rescind its offer completely in June 2020, the final price for the buyout was set in late October 2020 at $131.50 per share in cash. This leads to a total acquisition price of $15.8 billion.

When asked to comment on the completed merger, LVMH Chairman and CEO Bernard Arnault stated, “I am pleased to welcome Tiffany and all their talented employees in our Group. Tiffany is an iconic brand and a quintessential emblem of the global jewelry sector. We are committed to supporting Tiffany, a brand that is synonymous with love and whose Blue Box is revered around the world, with the same dedication and passion that we have applied to each of our prestigious Maisons over the years. We are optimistic about Tiffany’s ability to accelerate its growth, innovate and remain at the forefront of our discerning customers’ most cherished life achievements and memories. I would like to thank Alessandro Bogliolo and his team for their dedication to Tiffany and their work over the past three years, especially during this challenging period.” At the same time, LVMH announced that current Tiffany & Co. CEO Alessandro Bogliolo will be leaving the company after helping to facilitate the transition through January 22, 2021, while former Tiffany & Co. Senior Vice President for North America Anthony Ledru has been appointed CEO at Tiffany & Co. effective immediately. Ledru has a long service record in leadership for both Tiffany & Co. and LVMH, having also previously served as Executive Vice President of Commercial Activities for Louis Vuitton from 2017 to 2021.

Advertising Message

The full scope of the merger’s impact on the watch industry at large will be clearer with time, but the addition of Tiffany & Co. to the LVMH conglomerate’s already robust stable of luxury watch brands continues the current trend of brands being consolidated under a handful of massive holding groups. Tiffany & Co. joins a list of high-profile watch brands under the LVMH banner including TAG Heuer, Zenith, Bulgari, Hublot, Chaumet, and Dior Watches. Beyond potential reworks to Tiffany & Co.’s own line of in-house watches, it is unclear so far what this final merger will mean for the brand’s iconic brick and mortar retail chain, or the list of available brands sold under the roof of Tiffany & Co. stores.

Also potentially in question is the future of the fabled Tiffany & Co. signed dial, which has been a coveted feature among collectors of watches ranging from Rolex to Patek Philippe and more. The iconic jeweler’s continuous relationship with Patek Philippe in particular is a deep and storied one, dating back to 1876, but no statement has been made on the future of this partnership. On the other hand, there is a strong potential for future Tiffany-signed releases for brands like Zenith, TAG Heuer, and Bulgari, which may create a strong collector following in the coming years.

While Tiffany & Co.’s sales have been gradually slipping over the past several years due to an aging clientele and a general shifting of market trends away from traditional retail stores, the brand still holds a prime position in both luxury retail and the public consciousness. Whatever changes the acquisition may bring to the iconic brand with the blue box or to the LVMH group as a whole, the size and prestige of this sale is likely to have far-reaching consequences throughout the watch and luxury retail industries in the future.

For 2020 as a whole, when earnings were hit by the coronavirus pandemic that forced retailers to close shops, revenues reached 44.65 billion euros, falling 16 percent from a year earlier on a like-for-like basis, which strips out acquisitions and currency effects.

The French luxury titan will acquire Tiffany in a deal valued at $15.8 billion, $425 million less than the initial price.



The companies agreed in October to modify the terms of their agreement, with LVMH purchasing Tiffany for less and easing the closing restrictions.



LVMH will now pay $131.50 per share for the jeweler, or $15.8 billion, down from the initially agreed upon $135 per share, which valued the deal at $16.2 billion.



The companies have also agreed to settle their ongoing legal disputes in the Delaware Chancery Court.



The two were set to head to court this month after LVMH had previously announced its intention to back out of the deal, citing closing date issues and a request from the French government.



In response, Tiffany filed a lawsuit in Delaware to force LVMH to move forward with the deal, claiming it had breached the merger agreement by dragging its feet on obtaining regulatory clearances and was just looking for excuses to get out of the acquisition.



LVMH then filed a lawsuit of its own, planning to challenge the way Tiffany’s management handled the COVID-19 crisis, noting that the company distributed “substantial dividends” when it was losing money and that its operation and organization are not “substantially intact.”



With legal battles in the rearview and shareholder approval secured, the deal is expected to close in early 2021."

This becomes all the more clear at the beginning of the LVMH Watch Week 2021, where Hublot debuts a wide range of new watches. One thing that most of them have in common is that they are bringing new colors to the collection, of which some were previously deemed technically impossible.



Hublot Big Bang Integral Ceramic

With the Big Bang Integral, Hublot successfully launched an entirely new look for their iconic Big Bang. The brand is now expanding this collection with three new versions, all crafted from ceramic. Hublot has proven over the past years to master the art of making ceramic, even being able to produce colors that weren’t deemed possible before. The Big Bang Integral is now, next to the previously introduced black ceramic version, also available in blue, white, and grey ceramic. Each of the new colors gives a distinct character to the watch. It is particularly nice to see a grey version, as this color of ceramic is not used too often, yet did previously impress in the Big Bang Ferrari. It also gives the Big Bang Integral a unique look, with its understated yet at the same time highly technical nature.

Hublot Big Bang Tourbillon Automatic Orange Sapphire

Another art that Hublot has mastered is that of creating colored sapphire. This year they surprise us with a new Big Bang Tourbillon in vibrant orange sapphire, a world first. Fitted with a rubber strap in the same color is the watch a bold statement that is transparent and colorful at the same time. The sapphire case and lack of a traditional dial also allow for a full view of the movement at nearly every angle. This automatic caliber is also newly developed and features a flying tourbillon at six o’clock, crowned with a micro-rotor at the twelve o’clock position. It has a generous power reserve of 72-hours.

Hublot Big Bang MP-11 Magic Gold

Magic gold is another unique material that Hublot developed and truly embodies the ‘Art of Fusion.’ By combining ceramic with 18 karat gold through a complex and patented process, you get the best of both worlds. While maintaining the precious metal’s visual appeal, the fusion with ceramic makes it very resistant to scratches. Hublot now introduces the Big Bang MP-11 in this material. This charismatic watch stands, in particular, out for its seven mainspring barrels, which are placed in-line and give the Big Bang MP-11 a power reserve of 14-days.

Hublot Classic Fusion Orlinski

Hublot’s colorful creations continue with the new versions of the Classic Fusion Orlinski, which the brand is now offering in black, as well as bright blue. Unique about this watch is the faceted design, typical for Richard Orlinski’s work, that even extends to the dial. This is quite a challenging work of art, as not only the case but also the dial is crafted from ceramic.

Hublot Big Bang One Click

With the new 33-mm large Big Bang One Click, Hublot is further expanding its universe of color. This time it is the straps that make the difference. Thanks to the innovative ‘one click’ fastening system, the straps on these watches can be changed within a matter of seconds. By offering a wide array of different colored straps, the watch’s character can easily and swiftly be matched to any outfit or mood. Hublot is offering the new Big Bang One Click in stainless steel and King gold, with various diamond settings and either a black or a white dial."
How Louis Vuitton and Dior Are Crushing the Competition - Yahoo Finance,"Tue, 26 Jan 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9sb3Vpcy12dWl0dG9uLWRpb3ItY3J1c2hpbmctY29tcGV0aXRpb24tMjIwNTAxNTkzLmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS — What makes Louis Vuitton and Dior run?

That’s what analysts were wondering after LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton posted better-than-expected results in the fourth quarter, fueled by the strong performance of its key fashion and leather goods division.

More from WWD

The segment saw revenues jump 18 percent on a like-for-like basis in the three months ended Dec. 31, in stark contrast to sales declines in all other divisions, and it accounted for a whopping 86.5 percent of LVMH’s profit from recurring operations in 2020 as a whole.

The group’s two cash cow brands have posted double-digit organic revenue growth in each of the last two quarters, and profitability at Vuitton remains “exceptional,” the luxury conglomerate reported on Tuesday. LVMH does not break out results for individual brands.

“These numbers reported by LVMH are hugely impressive against a backdrop of an increasingly challenging operation environment,” said Fflur Roberts, head of global luxury goods at market research firm Euromonitor International.

She pointed out that global sales of personal luxury goods declined by 21 percent in 2020, according to Euromonitor’s latest estimates, published in November. So why are LVMH’s fashion brands thriving, even as the coronavirus pandemic continues to shut down global travel and force thousands of stores to close?

The answer is a combination of product, marketing and distribution, according to Jean-Jacques Guiony, chief financial officer of LVMH. The brands started the year with a strong pipeline of new products, such as the Pont 9 handbag at Vuitton, and the Bobby at Dior.

While the majority of other luxury labels suspended fashion shows and other physical events worldwide, Dior livestreamed its cruise show from Lecce, Italy, while Vuitton took its spring 2021 men’s show on the road, with runway displays in Shanghai and Tokyo.

In addition, Dior brought its “Christian Dior: Designer of Dreams” exhibition to Shanghai in July, marking the first large-scale fashion event in China since the beginning of the year.

Story continues

“It was really Dior and Vuitton taking the bulk of the customer’s attention, because nobody else was talking. We did it in the relevant geographies, in Asia, basically, and this is thanks to the fact that we have very, very strong local teams that were able to do it themselves,” Guiony said on a conference call.

Meanwhile, LVMH’s online sales grew fast, though how fast, he would not disclose. E-commerce accounted for 9 percent of revenues in 2019, but Guiony declined to give the figure for 2020, saying the level was unsustainable and would skew expectations going forward.

“There is nothing wrong with shopping online, but we would like a better balance than the one we had, particularly in April and in May 2020,” he said.

While the group has been diligent about slashing costs, it is hanging onto its flagships in the world’s most desirable locations — even in Europe, where tourism has shriveled and sales were down 25 percent last year. The region accounts for almost a quarter of LVMH’s global revenues, and the group is banking that local customers can help make up lost sales.

“Obviously, this will not be achieved in a year, or even in two, but we think it is achievable to develop locals in a significant way to offset, at least in the short term, part of the lost business with tourists,” said Guiony.

“The tourist business may not come back at its preceding levels, but it will come back. So as far as we are concerned, we see no particular reason why we should be shutting down stores, particularly in Europe,” he added.

Profit from recurring operations at the fashion and leather goods division was down just 2 percent in 2020 to 7.2 billion euros, “an astounding achievement,” Bernstein analyst Luca Solca said in a research note.

While the market tends to focus on LVMH’s marquee brands, Guiony noted there were other strong performers in its stable of 75 houses. For instance, Fendi weathered the COVID-19 crisis much better than it did the last global economic crisis in 2009, while Marc Jacobs succeeded in posting a profit in 2020 after five years of losses.

“Loewe did very well. Celine had a very difficult first half, but the second half was very strong,” Guiony reported.

“There were some achievements there that make us quite hopeful that the portfolio has very strong assets. And it’s probably not in the midst of the crisis that you have to judge who are the winners and losers. We certainly know the winners, but there could be other ones that we hope to develop in coming years,” he added.

To be sure, the division that suffered the most last year was selective retailing, which includes Sephora and DFS, LVMH’s travel-retail business. It posted a loss of 203 million euros in 2020, versus a profit of 1.4 billion euros the year before. A return to break-even will hinge on the revival of tourism.

“They were really hammered by negative operating leverage in 2020, with a big drop in their customer base, but this goes both ways: The minute customers come back, the profitability will come back to where it was previously,” Guiony predicted.

He commended Sephora for successfully navigating a year that saw profits from LVMH’s perfumes and cosmetics division plummet 88 percent. “We turned a profit for Sephora for the full year, which was not obvious, frankly, at the beginning of the year, and I think the Sephora teams reacted extremely well,” the executive said.

After posting several consecutive years of record results, LVMH saw net profit fall 34 percent in 2020 to 4.7 billion euros, while its profit from recurring operations was down 28 percent to 8.3 billion euros, more than 1 billion euros above consensus expectations.

Sales were down 17 percent in 2020 to 44.6 billion euros, underscoring luxury’s relative resilience in the crisis.

“The revenue and profits achieved in this most challenging year demonstrate the outlook has certainly got better,” said Guiony, while the group stated that it was entering 2021 with “cautious confidence.”

Group sales were down 3 percent in organic terms in the fourth quarter, versus a fall of 7 percent in the third quarter, and a rise of 8 percent during the same period last year, just before the coronavirus crisis hit.

Sales of wines and spirits fell 11 percent, perfumes and cosmetics were down 15 percent, and watches and jewelry lost a comparatively modest 2 percent. Selective retailing saw revenues dive 26 percent as international travel showed no signs of recovery.

LVMH canceled its traditional annual results press conference, as large gatherings remain banned in France, which is struggling to contain the spread of COVID-19. It opted for a webcast instead, although LVMH chairman and chief executive officer Bernard Arnault did not take part in the virtual event, depriving analysts and reporters of his trademark pithy comments.

The most important news, as far as shareholders are concerned, is that the group plans to pay a dividend of 6 euros per share for 2020, up from 4.8 euros the prior year. If approved at the company’s annual general meeting on April 15, it will mark a return to the record level reached in 2018 — further proof that LVMH is going full steam ahead into 2021.

What’s more, Alexandre Arnault, CEO of Rimowa since 2017 and the second eldest son of LVMH chairman and CEO Bernard Arnault, is to become Tiffany’s executive vice president, product and communications, lending his strong digital acumen, Millennial perspective, branding expertise and vast network of connections in Silicon Valley.

And Michael Burke, chairman and CEO of Louis Vuitton, will become chairman of the Tiffany board of directors, bringing his vast experience and impeccable track record in luxury to the task.

This powerful trio will be charged with accelerating the growth and intensifying the sparkle of LVMH’s newest luxury jewel, which is sure to transform the French group’s watches and jewelry division.

Ledru takes over from Alessandro Bogliolo, who was widely expected to exit once the transaction was finalized on Jan. 7. WWD had identified Ledru as a frontrunner in a report on Dec. 30, and signaled that Alexandre Arnault was also in the management frame.

However, Bogliolo has agreed to stay on until Jan. 22 to facilitate the transition.

I would like to thank Alessandro Bogliolo and his team for their dedication to Tiffany and their work over the past three years, especially during this challenging period,” he added.

Ledru is Vuitton’s executive vice president, global commercial activities, and will be charged with leading the global expansion and upscaling of Tiffany, synonymous with diamonds, blue gift boxes, and the late Audrey Hepburn.

The Frenchman has logged most of his luxury career in the U.S. jewelry business, rising through the ranks at Cartier over a 12-year career to become vice president of retail until moving over to Harry Winston as global vice president of sales in 2011.

In fact, Ledru had first joined Vuitton as president and CEO of its North American business in December 2014 from Tiffany & Co., where he spent a little under two years as senior vice president, North America, which is Tiffany’s largest market, generating about 43 percent of sales.

Ledru said he is “delighted to re-join Tiffany, the most iconic American luxury brand which I have long admired.”

“The inclusiveness and optimism upon which Tiffany was founded resonate now more than ever. I also come back to a maison that is at the forefront of the environmental and sourcing standards in its industry. Going forward, I have deep confidence in LVMH’s commitment to protect the brand, drive its growth strategy and apply the highest standards of retail excellence to Tiffany. The potential ahead is limitless, and I look forward to writing this next deeply promising chapter, along with the 14,000 Tiffany employees around the world.”

Indeed, LVMH is expected to spiff up Tiffany boutiques, renew its product range, rev up communications and leverage its expertise in fast-growing China. Luxury analysts say the French group has the financial and management muscle to transform Tiffany into a luxury megabrand.

The luxury giant has a strong track record of grooming executives and recruiting from within whenever a big role opens up, rarely poaching from luxury rivals for CEO roles. The current CEOs at Dior, Fendi, Givenchy and Loewe, for example, all rose through the ranks of either Dior or Vuitton.

Installing Alexandre Arnault at Tiffany also reflects widening responsibilities for Bernard Arnault’s children, and echoes Delphine Arnault’s role as executive vice president of Louis Vuitton, in charge of all product-related activities. Antoine Arnault, CEO of Berluti and chairman of Loro Piana, last year added oversight of LVMH’s environmental department, in addition to his role as head of image and communications at the group, while Frédéric Arnault, the youngest executive in the Arnault clan, became CEO of Tag Heuer last year.

Alexandre Arnault graduated from École Telecom ParisTech and holds a master’s degree from École Polytechnique.

Before joining Rimowa after initiating and leading LVMH’s acquisition of the German firm, he worked consultancy McKinsey & Co., then in private equity at KKR, both in New York. He then joined LVMH and Groupe Arnault to focus on digital innovation.

Rimowa is expected to name a new CEO shortly.

LVMH is sure to apply its formidable braintrust of family members and seasoned executives to ensure the success of Tiffany, which it contends has underperformed in a buoyant consumer segment.

Founded in 1837 by Charles Lewis Tiffany and catapulted to a higher plane by his son Lewis Comfort Tiffany, the jeweler has served the wealthy — both old and new money — ever since it was established. As of the end of March 2020, it operated 326 stores worldwide.

LVMH first agreed to buy Tiffany for $16.2 billion in November 2019 in what was billed as the largest acquisition in the luxury space. But that was pre-pandemic.

After the coronavirus began making its way around the globe, causing mass shutdowns, LVMH seemed to get cold feet. Last September, the French group said it was walking away from the deal, sparking a war of words and multiple lawsuits that threatened to derail the mega deal.

But by October, the parties reached a truce in order to avoid legal proceedings seen as harmful to both sides. At the end of 2020, Tiffany shareholders overwhelmingly approved an updated acquisition agreement calling for a $131.50 in cash per share purchase price, compared with the original offer of $135 a share. That amounted to about $420 million in savings for LVMH.

Tiffany is no longer a public company, but an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of LVMH, whose vast stable of fashion, beauty, liquor, hospitality and retail brands brands includes the jewelers Bulgari, Chaumet and Fred.

Despite an uneven performance performance earlier in 2020, Tiffany’s earnings shot up in its most recent quarter, which ended Oct. 31, by 52 percent to $119 million, beating out analyst expectations. E-commerce sale were up 92 percent during the quarter.

Among Ledru’s first challenges will be to galvanize Tiffany’s 14,000 employees behind LVMH’s ownership and strategy, and smooth over any lingering acrimony among top brass and board members.

Bogliolo joined Tiffany from Diesel in 2017 and sought to boost growth in China and through omnichannel initiatives while also raising average unit retail prices and accelerating product innovation. The executive stands to receive a change of control payout in excess of $44 million, according to LVMH.

Bogliolo and Krakoff were key in helping turn around the plodding Tiffany, modernizing the company with a focus on China, elevating the brand and expanding with The Blue Box Café, three distinct high-jewelry collections, and Tiffany Paper Flowers, which runs from fine to high jewelry.

It is understood that Krakoff is not being replaced, but that the company would operate with different design studios for different categories in keeping with how many of LVMH’s other powerhouse businesses operate.

Mark Erceg, executive vice president and chief financial officer, told employees late Wednesday that he would leave with the change of power, according to sources.

The leadership team walking out of Tiffany managed to steer the company through the pandemic — and through the bruising court battle with LVMH that ultimately led to a price cut in the deal.

While the springtime COVID-19 shutdown hurt Tiffany, the company was bouncing back in the third quarter and for the last two months of the year posted a 2 percent gain in net sales — marking the brand’s best holiday sales haul ever.

Louis Vuitton vice president of global commercial activities Anthony Ledru has been named Tiffany’s new chief executive, replacing Alessandro Bogliolo, who will depart later in January. The move is just one part of a wider reorganisation. Rimowa head Alexandre Arnault is now executive vice president of product and communications, while Louis Vuitton global chief executive Michael Burke will chair Tiffany board of directors.

Ledru is a rising star at LVMH, playing a pivotal role at Louis Vuitton since arriving at the leather goods brand in 2015 as chief executive of its North American operations, only to be promoted to lead global commerce two years later.

But it is his significant experience in “hard” luxury, particularly in the US market, that made Ledru the top candidate. Not only did he lead global sales at Harry Winston, followed by two years as vice president of the North American market at Tiffany before heading to Louis Vuitton, but he also spent much of his early career climbing the ranks at Cartier, where he managed the Richemont-owned brands’ US retail network.

The experience at Tiffany is important: he knows how the business is run, and understands its US operations, which still make up a large portion of its sales. But Cartier is the business that Louis Vuitton wants most to beat. Its brand positioning and stability is unmatched by any competitor. If Cartier is the Chanel of fine jewellery, then LVMH is hoping Tiffany could become the Dior.

Tiffany has an opportunity to gain some traction. Not only is its business booming in China, but it’s under-penetrated in Europe, where Cartier sets the standard.

But while the jeweller has a strong brand that is recognised globally, it’s in need of modernisation. This is especially crucial if it’s going to resonate with the next generation of luxury customers.

Alexandre Arnault, a son of LVMH chief executive Bernard Arnault, has had notable success refreshing German luggage goods brand Rimowa, which the group acquired in 2016 for €640 million ($774 million). He successfully turned the elite, if once-rigid, label into one of the most fashionable luxury status symbols on the market by focusing on quality, distribution and hype. Collaborations — including those with Off-White and Supreme — have landed the brand press mentions worthy of a major sneaker drop.

At Tiffany, Arnault may choose to expand the jeweller’s already-famous designer-partnership portfolio. In the past, most of these team-ups — with the likes of Elsa Perretti and Paloma Picasso — have been long-term ventures. There is room to try new formats. As Arnault arrives, chief artistic director Reed Krakoff and chief brand officer Daniella Vitale are both stepping down from their roles.

On joining Tiffany, Arnault is also relinquishing his chief executive role to Hugues Bonnet-Masimbert, but will remain non-executive chairman of the luggage label.

Both Ledru and Arnault’s ability to tap into LVMH resources — its retail real estate network and branding and marketing capabilities in particular — could help elevate Tiffany to a new competitive level. That, combined with Ledru’s understanding of the US luxury market, which has experienced a renaissance during the pandemic, puts them at a unique advantage.

However, the new Tiffany leadership team is strikingly similar to the former regime, as well as most c-suite executives in the fashion business, in one way: it is made up of white men. In recent years, many companies have hired chief diversity officers to help recruit more women and people of colour into senior leadership roles, but the majority of company boards and executive teams are not as diverse as some business experts would argue that they need to be.

For example, a 2015 McKinsey & Co. study of 366 public companies found that those with more diverse leadership in terms of gender were 15 percent more likely to have financial returns that exceeded the industry median. Those that were more diverse in terms of race were 35 percent more likely to have higher returns. In order to successfully address the needs of a new generation of consumers, Tiffany may need to evaluate whether there is proper representation within its own ranks.

How the LVMH & Tiffany Deal Will Reshape Luxury

What Will LVMH’s Tiffany Look Like?"
LVMH Set to Close Tiffany Acquisition This Week - JCK,"Tue, 05 Jan 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmpja29ubGluZS5jb20vZWRpdG9yaWFsLWFydGljbGUvbHZtaC1jbG9zZS10aWZmYW55LWFjcXVpc2l0aW9uL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The trip to the altar had many bumps along the way, but it looks like Tiffany & Co. and LVMH may finally get hitched this week.

On Dec. 30, Tiffany stockholders overwhelmingly approved the modified merger agreement that would give LVMH control of the storied retailer.

The revised deal, which was finalized on Oct. 29, is expected to close on Jan. 7, about six months after the original anticipated closing date.

The luxury giant paid $131.50 a share, or $15.8 billion, for the legendary jeweler—about 2.6% less than $16.2 billion, or $135 a share, the two sides originally agreed to in 2019.

The shareholder vote caps off a year during which it appeared the deal might be called off. According to a Dec. 28 Wall Street Journal article, once the severity of the COVID-19 pandemic became clear, LVMH chairman and CEO Bernard Arnault became furious that Tiffany was continuing to pay its regular shareholder dividend. He recruited a Rothschild & Co. banker to conduct back-channel negotiations, with the goal of lowering the original price by 11%, the newspaper reported.

When that failed, LVMH said that the French government, which was then engaged in a trade dispute with the Trump administration, had sent the company a letter saying it wanted the deal delayed until Jan. 6. Since that date fell outside the deal’s original time horizon, LVMH said the deal must be canceled.

Tiffany responded by filing suit in the Delaware Court of Chancery to have the deal enforced. In a statement, Tiffany chairman Roger Farah declared that LVMH had “unclean hands”—a phrase that “infuriated” Arnault and LVMH’s management, as it implied that the company “had asked the French government to write the letter,” the Journal said. (Later reports suggested this was true.)

In a counterclaim, LVMH asserted that COVID-19 represented a “material adverse event” that would negate the agreement.

Most, however, simply thought Arnault was angling for a lower price, as he had been from the beginning. Following an often bitter war of words, the two sides settled things in the boardroom, rather than the courtroom, leading to the revised deal.

Even with the price cut, this remains the priciest acquisition in LVMH’s history, more than doubling the $7 billion it paid for Christian Dior in 2017."

Petri joins the fashion house from jeweler Chaumet, where he was Europe retail director.

He reports to Balmain chief executive officer Jean-Jacques Guével and is charged with defining and implementing a commercial policy to “optimize the results of the various distribution networks while respecting the brand image for all the Balmain lines, wholesale and retail worldwide,” according to an internal announcement seen by WWD.

“In many markets, Balmain has a fantastic potential of growth, and I look forward to contributing to the commercial success of the maison with our partners globally,” Petri said. “Today’s customers aspire to authenticity as much as they value inclusiveness, and Balmain offers both in a way that is so relevant to the world we live in.”

Last September, Balmain opened a New York City flagship on Madison Avenue, its second-largest store in the world, and creative director Olivier Rousteing dusted off a monogram from the Seventies for a range of accessories and apparel.

A graduate of ESSEC Business School, Petri started his career as an assistant marketing manager at Bouygues Telecom and then spent five years as a product leader at Boston Consulting Group.

He joined LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton in 2012 as a senior project manager at LVMH Fashion Group, ultimately rising to senior vice president, strategy, of the fashion group’s U.S. division, focusing on brands including Marc Jacobs. In 2017, he joined Chaumet, also controlled by LVMH, and focused on VIP clients as the jeweler expanded into new markets including Spain and Monaco.

Petri takes up responsibilities at Balmain previously shouldered by Fabio Aiola, who is returning to his native Italy.

“LVMH showed remarkable resilience against the unprecedented health crisis the world experienced in 2020,” LVMH chairman and chief executive officer Bernard Arnault said in a statement. Looking ahead to 2021, Arnault pointed to bright spots including the Tiffany acquisition, and more broadly, the potential end of the pandemic in line with global vaccinations. The group said it would ensure rapid integration of Tiffany, which the group bought for $15.8 billion after a turbulent takeover.

The group highlighted double-digit organic revenue growth at Louis Vuitton and Christian Dior over the last two quarters, noting Louis Vuitton’s profitability “at an exceptional level” and Dior’s “outstanding momentum and market share gains in all regions”.

“As always in crisis time, the big brands do better than the smaller ones. Should we decide that we should be concentrating on only a handful of brands and give up on the other ones? Certainly not,” Guiony told investors, pointing to strong performances at Fendi, Loewe, Celine and Marc Jacobs, which Guiony noted was profitable in 2020 after five years of losses. “It’s not in the midst of the crisis that you have to judge who the winners and the losers are. We certainly know the winners, but there could be other ones that we hope to develop in coming years.”

Other categories were less resilient in a difficult year. “Selective retailing and perfumes and cosmetics are the two divisions most under pressure,” Solca says. The division combined saw €2.2 billion lower EBIT year-on-year, he adds, and continued to post double-digit negative organic growth in the fourth quarter."

Bernard Arnault named his second son, Alexandre, as executive vice-president of product and communications at Tiffany & Co

Kicking off 2021 with some big luxury news, LVMH chairman Bernard Arnault named his second son, Alexandre, as executive vice-president of product and communications at Tiffany & Co – the iconic New York jeweller finally bought by the French conglomerate at the end of last year following a protracted acquisition process . Formerly one of the youngest luxury CEOs in the industry, we’ve watched Alexandre enhance the profile of Rimowa in terms of sales, branding and visuals.

You might wonder how he transformed the family business into a multimillion dollar-making label beloved of millennials in just five years. And now he’s at Tiffany & Co., another brand with over a hundred years of history, can he perform the same trick there? Here we look at his work, his personality and his passion that contributes to his success so far.

Bringing in fresh ideas and new customers is one of the best ways to grow without changing too much of the house style. Alexandre is well connected with happening global designers and artists such as Alex Israel, Daniel Arsham, Virgil Abloh, Kim Jones and more. During his time at Rimowa, he launched multiple limited edition suitcases and accessories, with the exclusive designs helping to create hype and appealing to millennials – even becoming luxury symbols.

If you follow @alexandrearnault on Instagram, you notice that he likes to travel to meet new people and visit new places. Discovering the undiscovered might help explain how he can think out-of-the box, giving him the chance to understand and learn more about different markets and cultures.

Transforming stereotyped luggage into a luxury good

Luggage may be a tool for carrying travel necessities, but Alexandre added a new possibility at Rimowa – that carrying luggage could also be an expression of style. This changed the perceived price bracket for luggage, which until then was often below four figures, with some now happy to spend over US$5,000 to attain the look they crave.

Creating individuality for your products

Besides heralding several new designs, Arnault found new customers by using a fresh approach. Adding colours popular with Gen Z – such as army green, blue, pink and yellow – gave consumers the chance to show more personality and individuality. Creating exclusivity by limited-edition stickers and coloured wheels, millennials, found it a way to relate their luggage to their discerning lifestyle.

Knowing the right time to grow

According to Forbes, 95 per cent of Rimowa’s sales came from its core line of suitcases. Knowing that there was still a group of customers open to other options, Arnault was eager to find new sales opportunities in travel products such as sunglasses, iPhone cases and backpacks, keeping some consistency in design across different product lines.

Talent speaks louder than words

Arnault was appointed co-CEO of Rimowa not long after he finished his degree at Télécom ParisTech and masters at École Polytechnique. Back then, as a 24-year-old fresh graduate, some may have doubted his experience in the luxury industry. Just four years later, he has proved himself with his talent and bright mind – gifts his father Bernard likely had more than a hand in shaping.

Now 28, Alexandre has experiences, connections and visions to go with that talent. So like many others in luxury, we look forward to seeing the long-awaited #TiffanyRevolution.

(IDEX Online) - A son of the LVMH billionaire Bernard Arnault will reportedly take a key management role at Tiffany & Co.







Alexandre Arnault, aged 28, is currently CEO of the German luxury suitcase brand Rimowa, which is part of the LVMH empire. Two brothers and a sister also run LVMH companies.





His appointment, and that of Anthony Ledru, a top Louis Vuitton executive to another top position at Tiffany, have not been announced by LVMH, according to the Business of Fashion website, but have been confirmed by well-placed insiders.





The $15.8bn acquisition of Tiffany is finally due to take place today (7 January) after LVMH dramatically pulled out last year, sparking a series of bitter legal threats.





Earlier this week Alexandre Arnault, second son of the LVMH chairman and CEO, announced his engagement to Geraldine Guyot, founder of the French accessories brand D'Estree.





Bernard Arnault's daughter Delphine, is executive vice president of Louis Vuitton, his son Antoine heads the leather goods company Berluti and another son, Frederic, is newly-appointed CEO at watch brand Tag Heuer.

“The acquisition of this iconic US jeweller will deeply transform LVMH’s Watches & Jewelry division and complement LVMH’s 75 distinguished maisons,” LVMH said in a press statement.

The purchase of Tiffany & Co will put the jeweller, synonymous with elegance, innovative design, fine craftsmanship and creative excellence, at the top of LVMH’s Watches and Jewelry Division that comprises brands Bulgari, TAG Heuer, Chaumet, Dior Watches, Zenith, Fred and Hublot. Jewelry is a fast-growing market in the luxury goods sector.

LVMH, which previously walked away from the deal, paid US$15.8 billion, which is a slight cut to its original offer of US$16.2 billion. LVMH first announced the acquisition of Tiffany more than a year ago; however, the coronavirus pandemic’s impact on business reportedly soured LVMH Chair and CEO Bernard Arnault’s view on the price initially agreed. Tiffany, credited with inventing the modern engagement ring and immortalised in the 1961 film ‘Breakfast at Tiffany’s’ film starring Audrey Hepburn, ultimately sued LVMH to force the deal to proceed.

“I am pleased to welcome Tiffany and all their talented employees in our Group,” said Arnault. “Tiffany is an iconic brand and a quintessential emblem of the global jewellery sector. We are committed to supporting Tiffany, a brand that is synonymous with love and whose Blue Box is revered around the world, with the same dedication and passion that we have applied to each of our prestigious Maisons over the years.

“We are optimistic about Tiffany’s ability to accelerate its growth, innovate and remain at the forefront of our discerning customers’ most cherished life achievements and memories. I would like to thank Alessandro Bogliolo and his team for their dedication to Tiffany and their work over the past three years, especially during this challenging period.”

LVMH also announced a new management team for Tiffany & Co. Anthony Ledru, who ran Louis Vuitton in the US and previously worked at Tiffany and rival jeweller Cartier, will become CEO immediately. Also joining Tiffany as Executive Vice President for Product and Communication is Arnault’s 28-year-old son Alexandre, who previously ran LVMH’s luggage label Rimowa.

“I am delighted to re-join Tiffany, the most iconic American luxury brand, which I have long admired. The inclusiveness and optimism upon which Tiffany was founded resonate now more than ever,” Ledru said. “I also come back to a maison that is at the forefront of the environmental and sourcing standards in its industry. Going forward, I have deep confidence in LVMH’s commitment to protect the brand, drive its growth strategy and apply the highest standards of retail excellence to Tiffany. The potential ahead is limitless, and I look forward to writing this next deeply promising chapter, along with the 14,000 Tiffany employees around the world.”

Tiffany, which employs nearly 5,000 skilled artisans who cut diamonds and craft jewellery in the company’s workshops, reported record sales for the 2020 Christmas holiday period with increased online purchases and increased sales in China. Tiffany said its overall preliminary net sales rose two per cent for the period November 1 to December 31, year-on-year, with online sales soaring 80 per cent and sales in the Asia–Pacific region rising 20 per cent with China up 50 per cent"

Jewelry, the key beneficiary of the “future is female” theme, remains a fragmented growth market. Tiffany is one of a handful of brands likely to consolidate market share.



Lower Chinese exposure than peers and limited product diversification are respectively short-term and long-term sizable opportunities.



Now that Tiffany has become part of LVMH, we can expect some financial and human resources to be unleashed, starting with Louis Vuitton execs taking on the Chairman and CEO role and a promising Arnault heir getting involved as well.

As explained in a previous column, a combination of “womenomics” and societal change will bring about a new wave of spending from female consumers in the luxury sector, and jewelry is bound to be one of the biggest beneficiaries. Leaving the more affordable brands (Swarovski, Pandora) aside, luxury names that are big and relevant for consumers around the world are few and far between. They include Cartier and Van Cleef & Arpels (both part of the Richemont group led by South African chairman Johann Rupert), as well as Bulgari and Tiffany, which are now both part of the luxury empire built by French entrepreneur Bernard Arnault, LVMH.

The prestigious French brand Cartier, known as “the jeweler of kings and the king of jewelers,” is preferred in China. Van Cleef & Arpels is known for its romantic femininity and pieces shaped like animals or floral designs. Bulgari stands out as a colorful, exuberant Roman brand. Lastly, Tiffany is an iconic New York jeweler known for its diamond and sterling silver pieces and topping consumer brand preference surveys in the US. All four are likely to thrive over the next decade, but there are reasons to believe Tiffany will gain the biggest market share.

Long before the confirmation of the LVMH takeover, Tiffany was lagging behind its rival Cartier on two essential attributes: China exposure and product category diversification. In regards to China, the Tiffany team started to narrow the gap somewhat with targeted retail investments, better clients, and — importantly — the development of so-called “iconic products.” These are the equivalent of “signature products” in the handbag world, a.k.a instantly recognizable designs that consumers buy, so they can be recognized.

Companies can’t put a big logo on their rings, but recognizable designs might do the trick. Examples of products that are hugely successful in China include the Love or Just Un Clou collections at Cartier, the BZero1 or Serpenti at Bulgari, and the Alhambra at Van Cleef. Tiffany's latest T1 range is one as well, but the brand will be able to go a lot further in the future with bridal options being less of a focus, as getting married these days is less popular than self-purchasing. Also, Tiffany silver jewelry continues to be a US- and Japan-specific look that isn't relevant to Chinese consumers.

On the margin front, another reason Tiffany is significantly less profitable than Cartier is that the brand is known only for jewelry. Meanwhile, you may enter a Cartier store for a bracelet but end up purchasing a watch, fragrance, handbag, or pen. Tiffany has many product categories outside of jewelry, but few consumers know that. Credibility outside of your core takes time, and it certainly should not be a priority for Tiffany in the short term. But by the late 2020s, one can imagine Tiffany resonating in many categories. Did you ever think Louis Vuitton could have a big, credible business in jewelry, ready-to-wear, or fragrances? Doubters must acknowledge that what started as a travel trunk/handbag company is now incredibly relevant in many categories. There is no reason to believe Tiffany will solely be known as a jeweler forever.

Speaking of Louis Vuitton, remember a few years ago when sales were around 7 billion euros, and the press was talking about ubiquity issues? The brand is now twice that size, and I haven’t heard the u-word in five years. ""Scale"" is not an issue either. If anything, a larger scale is a key asset today. With its hand in production, retail experience, merchandising, media, clienteling, and more, I don’t see any reason LVMH, as the owners of Louis Vuitton and now of Tiffany, couldn’t double the latter’s sales. They managed to do it for Bulgari after integrating that brand in 2011.

Yet Tiffany has even more growth potential. While the LVMH-Tiffany deal is the biggest in the sector’s history, you could argue that the acquisition probably won’t move the needle much for the parent company since Tiffany’s market capitalization (as of this column) stands at just one-twentieth of LVMH’s. On the other side, there is a lot LVMH can do in terms of human and financial capital that will further accelerate the reawakening of the Tiffany brand.

The new team that Tiffany announced this week includes the appointment of an LVMH rising star, Anthony Ledru, as the brand’s CEO, who has huge US-market, jewelry, and retail credibility. As a Frenchman, he can help translate the Tiffany specifics to the Group’s HQ in Paris. Meanwhile, Bernard Arnault’s most trusted partner and the current Louis Vuitton CEO, Michael Burke, was named the Tiffany chairman, and 28-year-old family heir, Alexandre Arnault, who brought digital excellence, collaborations, and retail excellence to the high-end luggage brand RIMOWA, has been chosen to run product and marketing at Tiffany. With such a lineup, Tiffany should be viewed as having tremendous potential.

When LVMH first announced the takeover, one of its comments was that Tiffany was somewhat constrained as a listed company because it had to think quarter by quarter. The irony of that comment is that LVMH is also a listed company — but it is one that is family-controlled, has deep pockets, and now owns a vision for the next generation. Tiffany was poised for greatness, and it’s bound to come to fruition much faster now, or as Isaac Newton would have said: “If I have seen further than others, it is by standing on the shoulder of giants.”

"'Resilient' LVMH posts revenue decline of -17% in 2020, profits recover in second half - The Moodie Davitt Report","Tue, 26 Jan 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vbW9vZGllZGF2aXR0cmVwb3J0LmNvbS9yZXNpbGllbnQtbHZtaC1wb3N0cy1yZXZlbnVlLWRlY2xpbmUtb2YtMTctaW4tMjAyMC1wcm9maXRzLXJlY292ZXItaW4tc2Vjb25kLWhhbGYvP2Zvcm1hdD1wZGbSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"FRANCE/INTERNATIONAL. Leading luxury products group LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton posted revenue of €44.7 billion in 2020, down by -17% year-on-year. Organic revenue declined by -16% compared to 2019.

Profit from recurring operations, which amounted to €8.3 billion in 2020, declined by -28% over the year with a return to growth in the second half, which was up +7%. Group share of net profit amounted to €4.7 billion, down -34%.

The company said that its business showed “good resilience in an economic environment severely disrupted by the serious health crisis that led to the suspension of international travel and the closure of the group’s stores and manufacturing sites in most countries over a period of several months”.

Group-wide LVMH posted an organic revenue decline of only -3% in the fourth quarter, with “a significant improvement” in trends in all its activities compared to the first nine months of 2020. Fashion & Leather Goods reported double-digit growth in both the third and fourth quarters. While Europe is still affected by the crisis, the US saw a good recovery and Asia grew strongly in Q4.

In Selective Retailing, which includes travel retailers DFS Group and Starboard Cruise Services, revenue declined by -31% in 2020 (organic revenue -30%). Last year’s €1,395 million in profit from recurring operations turned to a loss of €203 million in the division.

LVMH said: “DFS saw a significant decline in its activity in most destinations due to the total suspension of international travel. While Hong Kong continues to feel the impact of the pandemic strongly, Macau saw improved trends in the latter part of the year. New services are being developed for its local customers and online sales have strengthened.”

The Wines & Spirits business group saw its organic revenue decline by -14% in 2020. Profit from recurring operations was down -20%.

LVMH noted: “After a significant drop in volumes in the second quarter, the Champagne business experienced improved trends in the second half, particularly in the United States. Beginning in June, Hennessy Cognac recorded a strong recovery, driven notably by demand in the United States. 2020 saw the integration of the 2019 acquisitions Château d’Esclans and Château du Galoupet for the first time over a full year, establishing a strong position for Moët Hennessy in the growing market for high-end rosé wines. A new high-end rum, Eminente launched in the third quarter.”

In 2020, the Fashion & Leather Goods business group recorded a decrease in organic revenue of only -3% in an environment marked by the closure of stores over a period of several months. The second half saw a rebound in activity, with double-digit organic revenue growth in both quarters.

China recorded a strong recovery in revenue beginning in April and the US in July. The brands’ strict cost management made it possible to limit the decline in profit from recurring operations to -2%, said the group.

Momentum was driven by Louis Vuitton and Christian Dior, with other brands showing “solid resilience”.

The Perfumes & Cosmetics business group recorded a -22% decline in organic revenue in 2020 while profit from recurring operations was down -88%.

LVMH said: “In a sector suffering from the decline in international traveller spend and makeup, LVMH’s major brands chose to be selective in their distribution and, unlike certain competitors, limited promotions and refused to sell indirectly to the Chinese parallel market, which presents major risks to the medium term desirability for brands that follow that route.

“The Perfumes and Cosmetics brands are showing good resilience resulting from the growth of skincare and online sales, particularly in Asia.”

The Watches & Jewelry business group saw its organic revenue decline by -23% in 2020, with a strong improvement in trends in the fourth quarter, which fell only -2%. Profit from recurring operations was down -59%.

LVMH hailed the addition of Tiffany to the portfolio from this year, having earlier said that the move would “deeply transform LVMH’s Watches & Jewelry division and complement LVMH’s 75 Maisons”.

LVMH Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Bernard Arnault commented: “LVMH showed remarkable resilience against the unprecedented health crisis the world experienced in 2020. Our priority has been to protect the health and safety of our employees and our clients and we have provided direct support in the fight against the pandemic.

“Our Maisons have shown great agility and creative energy in continuing to bring to life our customers’ dreams through a unique digital experience thereby further strengthening their desirability. Our focus on dynamic innovation was accompanied by strong commitments to the environment, sustainability and inclusion.

“We are starting 2021 with the pleasure of welcoming the iconic jewellery Maison Tiffany and its teams to our group. In a context that remains uncertain, even with the hope of vaccination giving us a glimpse of an end to the pandemic, we are confident that LVMH is in an excellent position to build upon the recovery for which the world wishes in 2021 and to further strengthen our lead in the global luxury market.”"

[Update: 8 January 2021]

Anthony Ledru has been appointed the CEO of Tiffany & Co., replacing Alessandro Bogliolo while Alexandre Arnault takes on the role as Executive Vice President of Product and Communications leaving his CEO position at Rimowa where he will be succeeded by Hugues Bonnet-Masimbert, the brand’s Executive Vice President of Sales and Client Operations; Michael Burke, CEO and Chairman of Louis Vuitton will also become chairman of Tiffany’s board.

The scion of French luxury conglomerate, LVMH is set to lead the newly acquired Tiffany & Co. with Louis Vuitton’s Head of Global Commercial Activities. Alexandre Arnault, the second oldest son of billionaire Bernard Arnault, is already the CEO of suitcase-brand, Rimowa and joining him is Anthony Ledru who has had vast experience in managing jewellery brands such as Cartier and Harry Winston prior joining the company. The founder of LVMH, Bernard Arnault, has for many occasions, appointed his children to top positions within the company; Antoine heads Berluti and the company’s image and communications division; His daughter, Delphine as Louis Vuitton’s executive vice president while another son, Frederic leads Tag Heuer.

Alexandre Arnault, 28, made headlines across the luxury industry when he was named the CEO of Rimowa in 2017 after playing a pivotal role in LVMH’s decision to buy an 80% stake of the German suitcase brand — he was only 24 when the deal took place — making this the first acquisition the company has done in Germany. Despite the current sluggish economy, Rimowa, under Alexandre Arnault, has been opening up new stores with a concentration in Asia, particularly China. In 2020 alone, six new stores were opened in China, four in South Korean and remaining two in Thailand and Taiwan each. Arnault is bringing in new perspectives to both Rimowa and its parent company, LVMH and now adding Tiffany & Co. to his profile, it would be interesting to see how he is going to lead the American jeweller.

The road to securing a deal between LVMH and Tiffany & Co. was not an easy one considering how much back and forth was done. Lawsuits were filed between the two companies, negotiations were held and then finally a deal was agreed upon last December and the US jeweller is bought over for $16 billion — the biggest transaction to be made in the industry."

Alexandre Arnault is being widely regarded as the heir apparent of his father’s French luxury goods empire LVMH with his appointment to the new executive leadership of Tiffany and Co.

Arnault (pictured), 28, is the second eldest son of Bernard Arnault (pictured below), 71, the billionaire chairman and chief executive of LVMH. The next-gen led luggage manufacturer RIMOWA since January 2017, after initiating and leading its acquisition by LVMH.

Arnault junior became executive vice president, product and communications of Tiffany this week at a disruptive time for the premium market during the coronavirus pandemic. The appointment of the new leadership team came at the completion of LVMH’s turbulent record $15.8 billion acquisition for the US luxury jeweller last month.

On Instagram, the millennial paid tribute to his team at RIMOWA in Cologne over the past four years, as well as clients, partners, ambassadors, landlords and LVMH.

“Without you all, we could not have brought the company towards new horizons, which I believe we have reached,” he said.

“You are the best. No matter the distance, RIMOWA will always be in my heart.”

Arnault said he was “humbled [and] honoured to join @tiffanyandco and excited to work with the teams in New York!”

The graduate of École Telecom ParisTech and Ecole Polytechnique started his career in the US in strategic consulting, at McKinsey & Company, then in private equity at KKR in New York. He joined the family business LVMH and controlling family office Groupe Arnault to focus on digital innovation, particularly e-commerce in the high-quality products sector. He was credited with successfully repositioning RIMOWA and elevating its brand image, perhaps giving a sense of where he could take Tiffany and Co next.

Arnault was joined in the new Tiffany C-suite by a pair of trusted non-family advisers. The new chief executive is Anthony Ledru, previously executive vice president, global commercial activities at Louis Vuitton within LVMH and formerly senior vice president of North America at Tiffany. Michael Burke, the chairman and chief executive of Louis Vuitton, became chairman of the Tiffany board of directors.

At the end of 2020, Tiffany stockholders voted overwhelmingly to approve the modified merger agreement with LVMH announced in October. The acquisition which began in November 2019 appeared at risk of collapse as the two parties engaged in a legal war of words over Tiffany’s performance and subsequent value. Trade tensions surfaced between Washington DC and Paris over the deal and the pandemic decimated the global luxury sector as shops shuttered and tourism ground to a halt.

Founder Leonardo Del Vecchio steps back in EssilorLuxottica power transfer

Eyewear tycoon Leonardo Del Vecchio has voluntarily stepped back from his executive duties at EssilorLuxottica, the Ray-Ban sunglasses making family business he founded, in the latest governance reshuffle.

The $19.6 billion Franco-Italian company announced Del Vecchio (pictured right), 85, had relinquished his executive responsibilities to preserve the “equal powers principle”. He remained non-executive chairman.

The move came as Hubert Sagnieres (pictured below), 65, decided to retire as executive vice-chairman to become non-executive vice-chairman of the company. The board of directors granted executive powers to Francesco Milleri, as chief executive, and Paul du Saillant, as deputy chief executive of EssilorLuxottica until the appointment of the new board by the 2021 annual meeting of shareholders. Du Saillant became chairman and chief executive of Essilor International.

Del Vecchio thanked Sagnieres for his success in turning Essilor into a ""world leader"" and helping to build EssilorLuxottica into the strong company it was.

“The contributions he made during his career with the company are long-lasting.”

Del Vecchio’s distancing was understood to be triggered by a governance pact which limited the octogenarian’s powers as the major shareholder. The pact had settled a management dispute between the French and Italian sides of EssilorLuxottica.

The company formed from the $58.8 billion merger of French corrective lens maker Essilor and Del Vecchio’s Italian eyewear company Luxottica in 2018. The merged entity included more than 20 brands in luxury, lifestyle and sport markets including Ray-Ban, Oakley, Persol, Bolon and Foster Grant.

Not that the father of six and grandfather appears ready for retirement himself. Del Vecchio is the second wealthiest individual in Italy, after Giovanni Ferrero of the chocolate-making dynasty, and holds lucrative stakes in investment bank Mediobanca, the French real estate company Covivio and Assicurazioni Generali, Italy's largest insurance company.

Rockefeller Foundation divests $5 billion in fossil fuels

The Rockefeller Foundation has turned its back on the original source of the family fortune by announcing it will divest its $5 billion endowment in fossil fuels.

The US private foundation’s board of trustees approved the new policy, prompting the foundation’s investment team to begin more than halving its total exposure to fossil fuels to less than 1% “in the near future”, the charity said.

The foundation’s exposure to fossil fuels declined from 4% in 2014 to 2% by the end of 2020—0.6-0.7% in public commingled funds and 1.3% in fossil fuel private partnership interests. During that time, it also generated average annual returns of 8.3%, more than 3% ahead of its benchmark.

Chun Lai, the foundation’s chief investment officer, said the endowment’s total private fossil fuel exposure declined in recent years in part because of global energy transition trends and heightened sustainability risks in the sector.

“But also because we actively narrowed the resources portfolio to less than a handful of managers who place strong focus on ESG [environmental, social and corporate governance] integration and avoided dedicated investments in the heaviest emitting fossil fuels,” Lai said.

The divestment followed the foundation’s $1 billion commitment over the next three years to catalyse a green recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic. It was hailed as the single largest commitment in the foundation’s 107-year history, which has distributed more than $22 billion since its inception.

Standard Oil founder John D Rockefeller (pictured) provided an original endowment of $100 million to launch the foundation in 1913. While the family was essentially out of the oil business by 1911, the foundation’s endowment was largely built from the proceeds of the company, which at one time controlled more than 90% of petroleum production in the United States.

Sharon Percy Rockefeller (pictured), 76, is the sole family member on the board of the foundation today. She is married to former West Virginia Senator John D “Jay” Rockefeller IV. They have four children and eight grandchildren."
Moët Hennessy pays out in Diageo dividend dispute - The Drinks Business,"Thu, 28 Jan 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWRyaW5rc2J1c2luZXNzLmNvbS8yMDIxLzAxL21vZXQtaGVubmVzc3ktcGF5cy1vdXQtaW4tZGlhZ2VvLWRpdmlkZW5kLWRpc3B1dGUv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"News

By db staff writer

Diageo has prevailed in its dispute with LVMH over a £161 million dividend due from its 34% holding in Moët Hennessy.

The wrangle arose when LVMH, Moët Hennessy’s parent company and the world’s largest luxury goods company, failed to pay Diageo a dividend for the financial year that ended on 31 December 2019, despite paying its other shareholders €2.4 billion on the due date in July last year,

As a result, Diageo threatened to open arbitration proceedings under the terms of the Partners Agreement which governs dividend policy and minimum annual dividend requirements for MH.

The groups have been linked since 1994 when they took a cross-holding in each other and set up various sales and distribution alliances, not least in China.

LVMH has long since divested its holding in Diageo but the UK company has retained its stake in MH, especially as it does not have either Cognac or Champagne brands.

Indeed, there has been speculation over the years that in the unlikely event that LVMH might wish to sell its drinks division, Diageo would be keen to discuss a price.

Today Diageo revealed that it had received a £80m payment in October and that earlier this week LVMH had agreed to pay the remaining £81m. Consequently Diageo will end the arbitration process and regard the matter as closed.

Neither side has commented on the reason for the initial non-payment of the dividend, but speculation that Moet Hennessy, LVMH’s drinks arm, was experiencing cash flow difficulties seem wide of the mark.

Although all luxury goods and premium drinks companies suffered a severe body blow in the first half of 2020 due to the coronavirus pandemic, LVMH is capitalised at €250 billion and controlled by Bernard Arnault, one of the world’s five richest men according to Barrons.

The pandemic prompted LVMH to delay announcing a dividend for the first six months of 2020 until October until it saw how its trading in the second half of the year was panning out.

The French group completed the successful €14.7 billion acquisition of US jeweller Tiffany earlier this month."

Ledru leads global commercial activities at Louis Vuitton, and Alexandre is currently in charge of LVMH-owned suitcase maker Rimowa.

LVMH declined to comment on the appointments. Ledru and Alexandre Arnault didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment. The Tiffany purchase is scheduled to conclude Thursday.

With Ledru, the French company would be picking someone with extensive experience in the U.S. luxury market to succeed Alessandro Bogliolo. Prior to his six years at LVMH, Ledru held key roles at jewelry brands including Harry Winston and Richemont’s Cartier, according to his LinkedIn profile. A Tiffany appointment would mark a return for Ledru: He managed the company’s US and Canadian businesses between 2013 and 2014.

Bernard Arnault, the billionaire founder of LVMH, has named his children to key executive roles within his business empire. His daughter, Delphine, is executive vice president of Louis Vuitton, in charge of supervising all of the brand’s product-related activities.

Arnault’s son Antoine heads Berluti as well as image and communications at LVMH. Another son, Frederic, runs Tag Heuer, the watch brand.

Alexandre has run German brand Rimowa for the past four years. The 28-year-old, who is active on Instagram, presented a Rimowa case study to Harvard Business School students in February. His exact role at Tiffany wasn’t immediately clear.

This year is set to be challenging for luxury companies as many regions struggle with renewed lockdowns to tame the coronavirus pandemic. The industry is relying on demand from China to bolster sales.

LVMH’s deal to acquire Tiffany won shareholder approval in December. The French company managed to get a small discount for its acquisition price for the iconic US jeweller after threatening to walk away from the deal. The purchase, worth $16 billion, is still the biggest in the industry’s history.

The investment is expected to help the company expand its global footprint of brands and industries.

More from WWD

Social commerce involves using social media to tap into communities and promote and sell products and services. It is a trend already popular in Asia. There, e-commerce platforms such as Taobao and Little Red Book have been integrating user-generated content to great success, for instance.

“The Series A financing builds on an exceptional year for Replika. We were able to rapidly grow a roster of clients across several verticals, introducing important programming and feature upgrades while solidifying our management team with key executive appointments,” said Corey Gottlieb, cofounder of Replika Gottlieb, in a statement. “We believe this funding will help us shift the current online selling paradigm, not only in the fashion and beauty industries, but in the broader health care, entertainment, travel and electronic industries, as well.”

“When we founded Replika, we envisioned a feature where every brand would be able to benefit from the power of social selling,” continued Kareen Mallet, cofounder of Replika Software. “After concluding commercial arrangements with several maisons of LVMH and brands of L’Oréal, it is tremendously satisfying to see that the investment arms of two of the world’s most forward-thinking companies have decided to invest in our vision.”

In 2019, LVMH selected Replika to be highlighted at the Vivatech Innovation Awards in Paris. Then LVMH asked Replika to be a part of its accelerator, La Maison des Startups, at the Station F start-up campus. Now, LVMH and Replika work together in Europe and the U.S.

L’Oréal’s chief digital officer Lubomira Rochet homed in on Replika at Vivatech and has been deploying the brand throughout the group’s divisions.

L’Oréal in early December said it had taken a minority stake in Replika Software Inc.

Last year, the luxury conglomerate released its new watches for 2020 with a splashy January event in Dubai, just weeks before Covid-19 became a global pandemic. The timing was certainly fortuitous for Hublot, Zenith, Bulgari and Tag Heuer. It gave the brands a chance to be seen in-person by both retailers, press and VIP clients before the business would nearly come to a standstill. This year, the watch division made sure to be first out of the gate again. On Monday, Hublot, Zenith and Bulgari released their new novelties for 2021 during a virtual LVMH watch week. Tag Heuer did not participate, but in a recorded video during a press conference for LVMH Watch Week this morning, Frédéric Arnault, Tag Heuer’s newly minted CEO as of June 2020, said, “The reason for which we are not participating is that on the 4th of February, we will host a digital event announcing the biggest partnership ever for the brand.”

From the rest of the pack, the new offering mostly updates existing models in new colorways and materials. Brands are playing it safe as they regain their footing after manufactures were forced to close for months last spring. But that’s not to say there weren’t a few highlights, such as Bulgari’s Octo Roma Carillon Tourbillon, Hublot’s Spirit of Big Bang Tourbillon 5-Day Power Reserve Carbon White, or a vivid new forest-green Defy 21 from Zenith.

Here is a look at every new release. Stay tuned for more in-depth coverage.

WATCH

HUBLOT

Hublot Big Bang Integral Ceramic

For a certain type of Hublot lover, nothing beats a ceramic—which makes the new Big Integral Ceramic a particularly exciting proposition. What differentiates this version from others is its monobloc architecture, meaning that the first link of its bracelet is fused to its 42 mm by 13.45 mm case. Because of this, the entire outer structure, with the exception of the bezel lugs and the rubber elements on the crown and pushers, is made from ceramic. Inside its svelte case you’ll find the V2 incarnation of Unico HUB1280 movement, which has a 72-hour power reserve. Previously only available in black, the single-color, single-material Big Bang Integral Ceramic now comes in white, blue and grey hues and costs $23,100.

Hublot Big Bang Tourbillon Automatic Orange Sapphire

Hublot has proven itself adept at creating and machining different-colored sapphire cases. Still, the amber-hue on the Big Bang Tourbillon Automatic Orange Sapphire is a world first. But as striking as that through-tinted 45 mm by 15.30 mm sapphire case may be, it’s not the only noteworthy thing about this piece. That’s because it’s powered by an entirely new tourbillon movement that features self-winding, a new architecture and three sapphire bridges. It’s limited to 50 examples and costs $169,000.

Hublot Classic Fusion Orlinski

Bold angles and sharp edges have been a trademark of Richard Orlinski’s Hublot timepieces since he started at the watchmaker back in 2017. These new, monochromatic versions of the Classic Fusion Orlinski are clad entirely in ceramic with the exception of the crown and strap. But there’s so much more to this show piece than its elegant, geometric shape. Inside its thin, 40 mm by 11.10 mm case is a HUB1100 Self-Winding movement that consists of 63 components and 25 jewels. The latest iteration of the $13,600 watch comes in flashy blue and gloss black, both of which call to mind the color codes used in Orlinksi’s XXL bestiary.

Hublot Big Bang MP-11 in Magic Gold and Blue Sapphire

The Big Bang MP-11 has the sort of high-tech movement that serves as the visual centerpiece. The calibre HUB9011 manual-winding skeletonized movement features an entirely original architecture that integrates seven series-coupled barrels that give it a 14-day power reserve. Yes, 14 days. Just as stunning are the two new colorways for its 45 mm by 15.30 mm case. One is made from the brand’s proprietary scratch-resistant 18-karat Magic gold and costs $89,500, while the other is constructed from transparent blue sapphire and goes for $132,000. Both are limited to 50 examples.

Hublot Big Bang One Click



The latest Big Bang One Click, is a shapeshifting timepiece that offers versatility in spades. Available in satin-finished stainless steel or 18-karat “King Gold,” the chronograph features a 33 mm by 10.55 mm case that’s been refined for slender wrists and a bezel set with 36 diamonds. The dial is available in black or white and houses the HUB1120 self-winding movement. The standout feature, however, is the interchangeable strap which can be switched in mere seconds thanks to the patented and easy to use “One Click” fastening system. Crafted from natural rubber, the strap is available in an array of colors—electric blue, raspberry pink or terracotta orange, to name just a few, meaning you can coordinate your watch with your outfit, should you so desire. The steel white diamond design is priced at $12,500, while the King Gold white diamond costs $23,000.

Hublot Spirit of Big Bang Beige

On the heels of pastel pink and blue, Hublot has unveiled a new Big Bang in beige and proved that neutrals are in no way boring. The new timepiece features a satin-finished beige ceramic case that measures 39 mm by 12.6 mm and a matching sand-colored sunray dial. The alligator strap is finished in a similar subtle hue and is fitted with a deployant buckle. The bezel, available in polished titanium or 18-karat “King Gold” (Hublot’s new gold color, containing mainly platinum, that is a shade warmer than 5N 18-karat gold), is set with no less than 50 diamonds and adds a touch of sparkle to the decidedly monochrome design. The King Gold model is priced at $24,100 while the titanium edition will set you back $19,900.

Hublot Spirit of Big Bang Tourbillon 5-Day Power Reserve Carbon White

While all Hublot watches are built to make a statement, the Spirit of Big Bang Tourbillon 5-Day Power Reserve Carbon White is one of the most striking designs of the new lineup. That is due in part to its skeletonized design that offers a full view, front and back, of its manufacture HUB6020 movement including a tourbillon, visible at 6 o’clock that completes one rotation per minute. The caliber’s architecture had to be specifically designed to fit into its tonneau-style, 42 mm by 13.25 mm carbon fibre case. The material was specially crafted to reveal its white composite inclusions, which are formed from glass microfibers created as non-woven pieces which are then blended with the carbon fibres using tinted epoxy resin to create the marbled look of its sandwich construction, held together by 6 h-shaped screws. Going the extra mile, the company equipped the handwound caliber with 115 hours of power reserve, displayed in a 5-day segment indicator at 8 o’clock. It comes with a black ceramic and black-plated titanium deployant “One-Click” buckle clasp and retails for $94,700.

ZENITH

Zenith Defy 21 Urban Jungle

Green watches have become increasingly popular. Whether military-inspired or not, they make a nice style statement for increasingly casual wardrobes. Zenith hopped on the bandwagon with its latest Defy 21, aptly called the “Urban Jungle,” both for its striking leafy hue and its modern construction. It marks the first time the Swiss watchmaker has dressed the model in green ceramic and it comes with a matching rubber insert, with grey edges, that uses a cordura-effect to create the look of a Nato strap without using fabric.

The color carries through to its El Primero 9004 automatic chronograph movement, which can measure 1/100th of a second for exceptionally close timing, with the main plate and star-shaped oscillating rotor also created in the rich hue. Incredibly precise, it has an escapement operating at 36,000 VpH or 5Hz, while the chronograph functions at an incredible 360,000 VpH or 50 Hz. It comes with approximately 50 hours of power reserve and retails for $14,500.

Zenith Pilot Type 20 Silver Chronograph

Two years ago, Zenith released its first Pilot Type 20 in a sterling silver case on a time-only special edition that was limited to just 200 pieces at $7,700 each. This year, it updated the model in a chronograph version, more true to its aviation roots. Like its predecessor, it also comes in a sterling silver case with a nuanced dial meant to reflect the striations and rivets of the metal panels found on the fuselage of an aircraft. The time around, the case also features two pushers to activate the chronograph, both situated on either side of its unmistakable oversized onion-shaped crown (historically pilots needed larger crowns to help adjust the time while wearing flight gloves).

Other than its chronograph function, the piece has not strayed in design from the 2019 version. It remains 45 mm and has the same extra-large Arabic numerals and cathedral hands topped off in SuperLuminova for legibility. Like its predecessor, this silver chrono is limited to just 250 models, but the extra complication will add a couple of K to the price of the 2019 model, with a retail figure of $9,700.

It is powered by the El Primero 4069 Automatic movement with 50 hours of power reserve and a frequency of 36,000 VpH.

Fun fact: Zenith’s Type 20 Pilot is inspired by early 20th century aviator Louis Bleriot, who undertook the first flight across the English Channel in 1909, with a Zenith on his wrist. The historic moment took place just five years after Zenith founder, George Favre-Jacot, completed the second trademark on the Pilot timepiece in 1904.

Editor’s Note: Zenith also released a new Chronomaster Sport and a Chronomaster Revival A385 earlier this month.

BULGARI

Octo Roma

After all the fanfare and focus on the technical expertise and groundbreaking design of the Octo Finissimo collection, Bulgari turned its attention to the Octo Roma line this year. The showpiece of its 2021 releases is this new Carillon Tourbillon. The 44 mm piece employs three hammers fixed directly to the titanium body of the case. They are folded and formed by an expert craftsman before they are hardened at a temperature of 900 degrees. After, they are cleaned and then ironed in an oven at 500 degrees to give the metal a crystalline resonance. They are then lengthened with a file to refine the chords of the ringing. Yes, all of that for the thin and tiny wire-like gongs you see encircling the interior of the case.

The melody sounds three tones in the note of C for the hours, a sequence of mid-range-C notes for the quarters and a mid-note for the minutes. Beyond the positioning of the hammers, sound was maximized and refined with hollowing constructions in the middle case to reduce the amount of metal inside and outside, and three openings were added to the three chimes to allow sound to exit from the chamber. The back has also been hollowed in a titanium grid that protects the resonance and allows sound to be further transmitted to the exterior.

The Caliber BVL428 also comes with cut-out bridges and a unique arrangement of the components to better reveal the mechanism to the wearer (and its spectators). The hammers, gongs and tourbillon cage come in alternating polished steels for depth of presentation, while the mainplate and bridges are treated in PVD.

Unlike other watchmakers attempting to modernize, Bulgari has found a unique design formula that is overtly contemporary while still being sophisticated, and that strategy is hitting all the right notes.

Limited to just 15 pieces worldwide (price upon request), the Octa Roma Carillon Tourbillon will be numbered via an engraving on the crown and comes on a black alligator leather strap with a three-blade folding clasp in DLC titanium.

Bulgari Octo Finissimo

It was all about small design tweaks on the three new Octo Finissimo releases. First up, the Chronograph GMT model received a new black opaline dial with a new sporty rubber strap designed to look like a fabric strap. The 42 mm piece houses the ultra-thin BVL 318 caliber with a peripheral rotor that allows for a thinness of 6.9 mm. Previous versions came in monochrome titanium. Next, the steel 43 mm by 8.75 mm S Chronograph GMT, also equipped with the BVL 318 caliber, was updated with a handsome new blue sunray dial paired with silver counters. The dial color offers a slightly more traditional take on the otherwise minimalist aesthetic of the Octo. But, in our opinion, the best looking model of the bunch stays true to Bulgari’s pared-down aesthetic. The new 40 mm by 6.40 mm Octo Finissimo S, a follow up to 2020’s introduction of a stainless steel model, now comes with a new silver vertical-brushed dial, which pairs nicely against the radial-brushed bezel. Previously, the steel version was offered with a black dial, but the new silver dial steel model, powered by the BVL 138 caliber, allows for a sleeker look akin to last year’s ceramic introduction.

Bulgari Diva’s Dream

Bulgari’s Diva’s Dream collection consistently serves up high-end complication pieces for women as a tribute to history’s grandest dames. The latest offering is no exception. The new Peacock line, which comprises three timepieces, has that signature pop of color and artfully combines diamonds and ancient techniques in an undeniably alluring way.

Each piece has a luxe 37 mm 18-karat rose gold case and breathtaking dial that pays homage to the preening spirit of the peacock in a truly unique way. The first, the Peacock Dishi, features a striking marquetry dial set with 24 natural hand-cut feather elements that were painstakingly sourced from nearly 500 feathers. Limited to 50, it features a total of 440 diamonds and 25 sapphires, along with a deep blue alligator bracelet. Next, the Peacock Diamonds, sees a hand-painted peacock motif set against a mother-of-pearl backdrop and boasts a staggering 1,452 (7.56 carats) of brilliant-cut diamonds. Finally, the Peacock Tourbillon Lumière features a dial decorated with natural peacock feather marquetry and snow-set diamonds. Limited to just 10 pieces, this watch takes some six weeks to complete.

Bulagari Serpenti Spiga

Bulgari’s snake-inspired timepieces have been slithering around wrists since the ’40s and the Serpenti range has become a distinct signifier of the brand. The latest collection, Serpenti Spiga, comprises three new serpent-themed timepieces that each feature the classic 33 mm snake-shaped dial, Bulgari’s high-precision quartz movement, and a diamond-encrusted wrapping bracelet with an intricate matelassé pattern.

The most subdued of the trio is finished in 18-karat rose gold and sports a mother-of-pearl dial and double-row bracelet with a total of 281 brilliant-cut diamonds. For a little more pizzaz, there’s a second rose-gold timepiece with a triple-row bracelet, black lacquered dial and 461 rocks. And, finally, the piece de resistance, an 18-karat white-gold watch set with a single cabochon-cut blue sapphire. This blingy beauty features a triple-row bracelet with 421 stones, plus a dial that’s decorated with 257 snow pavé-set diamonds."

After the luxury industry’s biggest takeover, the French powerhouse faces the challenge of integrating the jewellery brand /fashion/trends/now-that-tiffany-has-said-yes-what-s-lvmh-s-next-move-111609593214972.html 111609593214972 story

The holiday blessing that Tiffany & Co. shareholders gave to sell the storied jeweller to LVMH pushes the contentious transaction closer to the finish line, giving billionaire Bernard Arnault the long-sought pathway to expand his global collection of luxury brands.

Tiffany will be dropped from the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index now that the deal has been approved, S&P Dow Jones Indices said in New York, with the jeweller replaced by Enphase Energy Inc. Tiffany shareholders voted overwhelmingly to support the deal at a virtual meeting, according to LVMH. The transaction, valued at almost $16 billion, is expected to close in early 2021.

The vote was a key step in the yearlong saga over the luxury industry’s biggest takeover. The parent of Louis Vuitton had agreed to buy the iconic jeweller before trying to back out of the deal when the coronavirus pandemic upended the retail world. That prompted a lawsuit by Tiffany and some harsh words from both sides, and the companies eventually agreed to see the deal through at a slightly reduced price.

Now LVMH faces the challenge of integrating Tiffany. Changes at the jeweller may include a product overhaul, a review of its store network, and a more aggressive digital marketing strategy, according to analysts. Management changes may also be in store, since Arnault tends to put his own loyalists at the helm of new companies to tighten control.

France’s richest man has built his luxury empire on his take-no-prisoners negotiation tactics, offering few concessions and often cleaning house at freshly acquired assets to fit his needs.

The two companies announced in October that they’d reached an agreement, whereby LVMH would buy Tiffany for $131.50 a share, down from $135 originally promised. Tiffany shares were little changed at $131.35 last Wednesday in New York and are down about 1.7% in a tumultuous year for any retailer, let alone one trying to keep a merger intact.

Tiffany had accused LVMH of having “unclean hands” when the French side initially abandoned the deal. LVMH in turn disparaged Tiffany for mismanagement of the business during the pandemic, while spending unwisely on dividends. Making matters messier still, the French government was dragged into the showdown after Arnault requested the help of Foreign Affairs Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian to extricate itself from the deal. The two companies were set to face trial at the start of next year in the US.

Besides Louis Vuitton handbags, the LVMH conglomerate includes Loro Piana cashmere, Bulgari jewellery and Dior haute-couture, among many others. The company’s shares were little changed on Thursday last week after the shareholder vote, trading at 513 euros in Paris.

Like others in the business, LVMH struggled with the fallout of the coronavirus pandemic. Lately, China has led a rebound in consumer demand, and Bain & Co. estimates that the personal luxury goods market may grow by as much as 19% next year. But the industry probably won’t recover until the end of 2022 or 2023, according to Bain."

Tiffany & Co. CEO to step aside as LVMH names new executive team

Following the successful acquisition of Tiffany & Co. by French luxury conglomerate Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton (LVMH) this week, CEO Alessandro Bogliolo will depart the company alongside three other members of its executive team.

Bogliolo – a former executive with LVMH-owned Bulgari and Sephora, and CEO of Italian fashion and accessories brand Diesel – has led Tiffany & Co. for more than three years and is widely seen as the architect of its successful expansion within the Chinese market.





“I am honoured to have led Tiffany as a public company and contributed with such a talented team to further strengthening Tiffany’s iconic standing"" Alessandro Bogliolo, outgoing Tiffany & Co. CEO

Anthony Ledru, executive vice-president of global commercial activities at Louis Vuitton, has been named as his successor “effective immediately”, according to a statement on the LVMH website.

Ledru has significant experience in the jewellery industry; he was a senior vice-president of Tiffany & Co.’s North America division between 2013 and 2014, and prior to that held senior positions with Harry Winston and Cartier.

In the LVMH statement, Ledru said, “I am delighted to re-join Tiffany, the most iconic American luxury brand, which I have long admired.

“Going forward, I have deep confidence in LVMH’s commitment to protect the brand, drive its growth strategy and apply the highest standards of retail excellence to Tiffany.”

Ledru’s appointment marks Tiffany & Co.’s fifth CEO in less than six years. Long-term CEO Michael Kowalski, who had led the company for 16 years, retired in March 2015 and was replaced by French executive Frederic Cumenal.

However, Cumenal’s tenure lasted less than two years following disappointing sales results, and Kowalski returned as interim CEO before Bogliolo’s appointment in October 2017.

Bogliolo will remain with the company until 22 January to facilitate the transition process.

He said, “I am honoured to have led Tiffany as a public company and contributed with such a talented team to further strengthening Tiffany’s iconic standing.





“I am delighted to re-join Tiffany, the most iconic American luxury brand, which I have long admired"" Anthony Ledru, incoming Tiffany & Co. CEO

“I look forward to ensuring a smooth transition to Anthony and his team and wish him and all the Tiffany community continued success in the years to come.”

Louis Vuitton chairman and CEO Michael Burke will also join Tiffany & Co. as chairman of its board of directors, while Alexandre Arnault – the son of LVMH chairman Bernard Arnault and former CEO of luggage brand Rimowa – has been named executive vice-president of product and communications.

Chief artistic officer Reed Krakoff, executive vice-president and chief brand officer Daniella Vitale, and chief financial officer and executive vice-president Mark Erceg, will also leave the company.

Departing executives:

Alessandro Bogliolo, CEO (appointed 2017)

Mark Erceg, chief financial officer and vice-president (appointed 2016)

Reed Krakoff, chief artistic officer (appointed 2017)

Daniella Vitale, executive vice-president and chief brand officer (appointed November 2019)

Bernard Arnault, chairman and CEO LVMH, said, “I am pleased to welcome Tiffany and all their talented employees into our group.

“We are optimistic about Tiffany’s ability to accelerate its growth, innovate and remain at the forefront of our discerning customers’ most cherished life achievements and memories. I would like to thank Alessandro Bogliolo and his team for their dedication to Tiffany and their work over the past three years, especially during this challenging period.”

The LVMH acquisition marks the first time Tiffany & Co. has been in private hands since 1987. The company's shareholders approved the French conglomerate's revised $US15.8 billion takeover offer on 30 December after a tumultuous renegotiation, which almost culminated in a courtroom battle.

In keeping with its preference for promoting internal talents, the French luxury house has appointed David Ponzo to succeed Ledru as executive vice president, commercial activities, overseeing Vuitton’s network of 460 physical stores and e-commerce, with responsibility for everything from store planning and architecture to client relations.

More from WWD

Ponzo joined Vuitton in 2016 as zone president, Japan, after a prior career at Swatch Group. Nicolas Villeger succeeds him as head of Vuitton’s Japanese operations, marking his return to the LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton fold. Villeger worked for the luxury conglomerate’s travel retail division DFS from 2017 until January 2020, and had since then focused on his personal advisory firm.

Ponzo’s appointment was effective on Jan. 7, when LVMH announced the new leadership at Tiffany after a drawn-out acquisition process.

In addition to Ledru, it named Michael Burke, chairman and CEO of Louis Vuitton, as chairman of the Tiffany board of directors, and Alexandre Arnault, CEO of Rimowa since 2017 and the second eldest son of LVMH chairman and CEO Bernard Arnault, as executive vice president, product and communications.

In an internal announcement seen by WWD, Vuitton praised Ponzo’s track record. “For the past five years David has successfully led a Japanese management team that has been synonymous with excellence including the opening of unique stores such as Maison Osaka Midosuji last year,” it said.

Villeger, meanwhile, has worked in Japan and Asia for 24 years, building expertise in retail operations and customer experience at brands including Tesla, Coach, Longchamp, Estée Lauder and Shiseido.

The European luxury stocks of LVMH, Hermès, and Kering have risen “to record highs” during the global pandemic and have invited ""comparisons with US technology behemoths,” according to Bloomberg . Meanwhile, Reuters also reported on these “bullish brokerage calls” and the impact luxury stocks were having on the STOXX Europe 600.

Unsurprisingly, some investors are bullish about these luxury stocks. “We view European luxury companies as the European stock market equivalent of US tech: businesses that are unrivaled in their global dominance,” said Giles Rothbarth, the manager of the Blackrock European Dynamic Fund, to Bloomberg.

The fast economic rebound in China has positively impacted consumption patterns, helping retail-focused companies overcome the ripple effect of the pandemic shutdown and slumps from the COVID-19 pandemic.

However, investors shouldn’t ignore global patterns. Luxury markets in most countries have been heavily impacted by COVID-19, and the crisis has caused “an unprecedented fall” in market size — down 23 percent from 2019, Bain & Company reported.

Stocks might trade higher, but we advise caution because once things return to normal, the Chinese appetite for luxury will ultimately slow down. Satisfying the pent-up demand for traveling, dining, and outdoor leisure activities will become the new priority.

Currently, international travel restrictions are keeping Chinese consumers in their home country. Thus, buying local luxury goods has become a relaxing pastime. However, travel will again be encouraged once vaccinations increase and the world reaches herd immunity.

Consequently, spending habits will react to the new lifestyle, and post-pandemic travel will take precedence over shopping. Plus, emerging trends in areas like wellbeing and health will surely emerge.

LVMH's sales growth slowed in the fourth quarter as protests in Hong Kong dented Chinese demand for the luxury giant's products at the end of a strong year.

(Bloomberg) -- A chance to help run the iconic American jeweler Tiffany & Co. has catapulted Alexandre Arnault into the luxury world’s top echelons.

The 28-year-old son of French billionaire Bernard Arnault was thrust into the limelight on Thursday with a key role at Tiffany, after LVMH completed its $16 billion on-again-off-again takeover -- the luxury industry’s biggest. Alexandre was named executive vice president for products and communication, and will help new Chief Executive Officer Anthony Ledru oversee the company.

For the third of LVMH founder Arnault’s five children, the move marks a leap from managing a small suitcase maker for the group to work at one of the world’s best-known jewelry brands with pre-pandemic annual revenue of about $4.4 billion. It also makes him a more serious contender to some day run the luxury empire built by his 71-year-old father.

“Bernard Arnault is building a fair process between the Arnault siblings by testing them,” said Philippe Pele-Clamour, adjunct professor at business school HEC Paris. “That will allow them to understand if they can lead such a group.”

The first son of Arnault’s second wife, Alexandre is in the line of succession to one of the world’s biggest fortunes. His father has a net worth of about $114 billion through his holdings in LVMH and Carrefour SA, making him Europe’s richest and the world’s fourth-wealthiest person, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.

Alexandre’s ascent provides fresh fodder for the chattering classes in France, which closely track the family for signs of who Arnault’s anointed successor might be. Although it may be a long while before Arnault -- who remains hands on in the business -- is ready to retire, the guessing game continues. Four of the five Arnault children are currently involved in the company, Europe’s second-largest by market value after Nestle SA.

While Jean is still a student, Alexandre’s younger brother Frederic manages watchmaker Tag Heuer. Delphine, Alexandre’s half-sister, is executive vice president of Louis Vuitton, while half-brother Antoine heads shoemaker Berluti and oversees image, communications and the environment for LVMH.

An engineer by training -- graduating from France’s Ecole Telecom ParisTech and Ecole Polytechnique -- Alexandre has since 2017 led German luggage maker Rimowa, acquired by LVMH the year before. The executive, who will be based in New York for his new role, began his career in the U.S., first at McKinsey & Company and then at KKR. He joined LVMH and Groupe Arnault, focusing on digital innovation and honing his management skills at Fendi before moving to Rimowa.

The suitcase maker is a small part of LVMH’s fashion and leather goods unit, which represented more than 40% of the conglomerate’s sales of 53.7 billion euros ($65 billion) in 2019 -- mostly driven by Louis Vuitton and Christian Dior brands. A year ago, releasing annual results, Bernard Arnault said Rimowa had achieved “remarkable growth since we acquired it.”

At Tiffany, Alexandre and Ledru will have their hands full as the luxury industry contends with the second year of a pandemic that’s forced store closures across the world and shrunk discretionary spending. Still, their collaboration will help take Alexandre up the learning curve, said Luca Solca, an analyst at Bernstein.

“The idea of pairing experienced managers with up-and-coming family members, and possible future leaders, creates a fruitful environment,” he said, adding that it can “avoid mistakes, and prove one’s true value.”

The Tiffany appointment caps an eventful month for Alexandre, who with Antoine is the family’s highest-profile member, with an active Instagram account of posts of everything from Rimowa’s products and family photos to meetings with billionaires Jeff Bezos and Warren Buffett. A few weeks ago, he used the account to announce his engagement to his girlfriend, saying “engaged to my soulmate and my best friend,” with the emoji of a ring."

(Bloomberg) -- A top executive at Louis Vuitton and one of Bernard Arnault’s sons are set to take over management of Tiffany & Co. after the biggest acquisition in the luxury industry by LVMH.

Anthony Ledru will lead the jeweler, with Alexandre Arnault taking on a top position inside the brand, according to people familiar with the appointments who asked not to be identified before an announcement. Ledru leads global commercial activities at Louis Vuitton, and Alexandre is currently in charge of LVMH-owned suitcase maker Rimowa.

LVMH declined to comment on the appointments. Ledru and Alexandre Arnault didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment. The Tiffany purchase is scheduled to conclude Thursday.

With Ledru, the French company would be picking someone with extensive experience in the U.S. luxury market to succeed Alessandro Bogliolo. Prior to his six years at LVMH, Ledru held key roles at jewelry brands including Harry Winston and Richemont’s Cartier, according to his LinkedIn profile. A Tiffany appointment would mark a return for Ledru: He managed the company’s U.S. and Canadian businesses between 2013 and 2014.

Bernard Arnault, the billionaire founder of LVMH, has named his children to key executive roles within his business empire. His daughter, Delphine, is executive vice president of Louis Vuitton, in charge of supervising all of the brand’s product-related activities.

Arnault’s son Antoine heads Berluti as well as image and communications at LVMH. Another son, Frederic, runs Tag Heuer, the watch brand.

Alexandre has run German brand Rimowa for the past four years. The 28-year-old, who is active on Instagram, presented a Rimowa case study to Harvard Business School students in February. His exact role at Tiffany wasn’t immediately clear.

This year is set to be challenging for luxury companies as many regions struggle with renewed lockdowns to tame the coronavirus pandemic. The industry is relying on demand from China to bolster sales.

LVMH’s deal to acquire Tiffany won shareholder approval in December. The French company managed to get a small discount for its acquisition price for the iconic U.S. jeweler after threatening to walk away from the deal. The purchase, worth $16 billion, is still the biggest in the industry’s history.

Months later, the fashion house is now dropping the sure to be sought after range marked by the mystic “Zoooom With Friends” characters.

The selection features out of the ordinary makeovers of Louis Vuitton‘s signature bags, like the Keepall, Soft Trunk, and Speedy. For instance, the Keepall Pouch maintains its original LV monogram and includes an embroidered youthful character illustration stitched into the bag. In other pieces such as the Soft Trunk Backpack, the characters appear to be more two-dimensional as they are hand-painted as opposed to sewn into the bag as a three-dimensional feature. Throughout the collection, the vibrantly designed characters stand out as a reoccurring concept on all accessories. Unique from the rest of the bags are the Panda and Croco, which like their names, take on its animalistic shape, doubling as a plush toy accessory.

Adding to the lineup of accessories are statement pieces like the pink and navy LV mixed chains chunky bracelet, an LV anagram belt in the reworked SS21 checkered pattern, and the iconic Millionaire Sunglasses in black and white. Abloh continues to expand his LV sneaker portfolio, ensuring the vivid and eye-catching theme to round out the collection. Those interested can also expect LV’s Ollie and Trainer sneaker silhouettes in bright neon shades of yellow, orange, and pink.

Take a look at the Louis Vuitton Men’s SS21 accessories lineup releasing January 15 above.

"Hindu Statesman Thanks Louis Vuitton for Apparently Recalling ""Inappropriate"" Cow Leather Yoga Mat - HYPEBEAST","Wed, 13 Jan 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vaHlwZWJlYXN0LmNvbS8yMDIxLzEvbG91aXMtdnVpdHRvbi1jb3ctbGVhdGhlci15b2dhLW1hdC1yYWphbi16ZWQtaGluZHUtY29udHJvdmVyc3ktcmVjYWxs0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"In late December, self-described Hindu statesman Rajan Zed voiced public grievance with Louis Vuitton and parent company LVMH for a “highly inappropriate” slight. Zed, the president of the Universal Society of Hinduism, took aim at an “insensitive” cowhide leather yoga mat that Louis Vuitton released over the holiday season. The luxury house may have taken Zed’s criticism to heart, as the Reno-based activist has issued a press release pointing out that Louis Vuitton apparently withdrew the yoga mat.

An authority in interfaith relations who was the first Hindu to lead the American Senate’s prayer, Zed’s latest statement explains that recent searches on the Louis Vuitton web store for the keyworkd “yoga mat” have only turned up negative results. Indeed, Louis Vuitton’s various international English language sites display “Not Avaialble” text on the yoga mat’s dedicated pages, though some still encourage viewers to contact customer services or call for inquiry.

Louis Vuitton hasn’t publicly addressed the issue but Zed preemptively thanked the luxury label for “understanding the concerns of Hindu community.” Nevertheless, Zed and an interfaith collective that reportedly includes a Lutheran pastor, Jewish rabbi and Buddhist priest chastised Louis Vuitton for not being “better educated and equipped in religious and cultural sensitivities.” Zed explains that the yoga mat is inherently insensitive to Hindus as it juxtaposed the flesh of a dead cow — Hindus decry cattle slaughter — with yoga, improperly clashing two sacred elements of Hinduism.

Finally, Zed reiterated a desire for public apologies from LVMH CEO Bernard Arnault, Louis Vuitton CEO Michael Burke and Louis Vuitton executive vice president Delphine Arnault in regards to “ethical responsibility,” simultaneously calling for LVMH executives to receive religious and cultural sensitivity training.

The Japanese-made yoga mat itself retailed for nearly $2,000 USD on Louis Vuitton’s web store and boasted the opulent touches that one would expect from the fashion house: gold-toned hardware, an attached monogram canvas card holder and matching patterns atop each side of the cowhide leather mat. Despite the product’s scarcity online, it may still be available at various global Louis Vuitton stores.

HYPEBEAST has reached out to Louis Vuitton to confirm the status of the recall.

This controversy could have been a potential blemish on Louis Vuitton’s otherwise optimistic 2021; the luxury imprint recently brought on tennis star Naomi Osaka as brand ambassador as LVMH launched the annual edition of its for Prize Young Fashion Designers and it made executive shifts to onboard its latest acquisition, Tiffany & Co."
LVMH to raise prices of its luxury brands - koreatimes,"Fri, 15 Jan 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiM2h0dHBzOi8vbS5rb3JlYXRpbWVzLmNvLmtyL3BhZ2VzL2FydGljbGUuYXNwLzMwMjU0NdIBP2h0dHBzOi8vbS5rb3JlYXRpbWVzLmNvLmtyL3BhZ2VzL2FydGljbGUuYW1wLmFzcD9uZXdzSWR4PTMwMjU0NQ?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"People enjoy afternoon tea at a coffee shop in ""House of Dior"" in the posh neighborhood of Cheongdam-dong, southern Seoul, in November 2019. / Korea Times file



By Kim Jae-heun



Only a week after LVMH raised prices of Louis Vuitton products, the French multinational corporation decided to increase the product prices of other affiliated luxury brands such as Dior, Fendi, Givenchy and Bulgari. However, the exact rate of increase has not been revealed.



Last year, Dior raised the price of its luxury products twice, once in May and again in July, by 10 percent each time. On Jan. 7, Louis Vuitton hiked the prices of its popular handbags by up to 25.6 percent.



The continued popularity of luxury goods here, undeterred by the COVID-19 pandemic, led to the price markups.



According to the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy, sales of luxury products at department stores surged 20 percent from May to December last year. Luxury product sales soared 32.5 percent in July alone.



Thanks to this trend, Hyundai Department Store's Pangyo branch in Seongnam, Gyeonggi Province, saw annual revenue surpass 1 trillion won ($910 million) in 2020, up 9.4 percent from a year earlier.



The department store plans to sell more luxury brands such as Boucheron and Burberry in the first half of this year. Hermes, one of the so-called ""big three"" fashion houses along with Louis Vuitton and Chanel, is reviewing the possibility of opening a boutique there too, but a final decision has not been made.



""We will continue to attract more key luxury brands to contribute to the revitalization of the local economy and grow to become Korea's top shopping landmark,"" Hyundai Department Store CEO Kim Hyung-jong said.



Lotte Department Store is also boosting floor space to sell more luxury products.



The department store chain is renewing its main branch in downtown Seoul, for the first time in 42 years. Luxury boutiques comprises 15 percent of overall shops in the department store now and Lotte wants to increase it to 20 percent.



When the building is renewed, Lotte Department Store will move all of the cosmetics stores there down to the underground level and fill the first floor with luxury brands.



Luxury brand sales at Lotte Department Store rose 16 percent between January and November last year compared to 2019.



Another retail giant, Shinsegae Department Store, also saw luxury product sales increase by 26 percent over the same period.



""People in their 20s have become key consumers of luxury goods here as they invest a lot of money into what they believe has value. They may eat instant food at convenience stores, but they are buying luxury goods,"" a fashion industry source said.

Tiffany & Co. Holiday Sales Rise Despite Pandemic - WWD,"Tue, 05 Jan 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3dkLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy1uZXdzL2ZpbmFuY2lhbC90aWZmYW55LWNvLWx2bWgtYXJuYXVsdC1ob2xpZGF5LWFsZXNzYW5kcm8tYm9nbGlvbG8xMjM0NjkwMDY1LTEyMzQ2OTAwNjUv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Tiffany & Co. stopped to take one more chance to sparkle before getting folded into Bernard Arnault’s LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton.

The jeweler said sales for the November and December period rose about 2 percent from a year earlier, setting a record for holiday sales at the company.

Alessandro Bogliolo, chief executive officer, said: “In the midst of a worldwide pandemic and its dynamic impacts, these all-time high preliminary holiday period sales results, which follow a strong third quarter, reflect the successful convergence of our multiyear sales strategies with respect to the Chinese mainland (greater than 50 percent increase from prior year), e-commerce (greater than 80 percent increase from prior year), increasing average unit retail prices and accelerating product innovations.”

Net sales in the Asia-Pacific region rose 20 percent, while Japan, which is accounted for separately, increased by 8 percent. The Americas region saw sales fall by 5 percent while Europe declined 8 percent.

The holiday sales gains expanded on Tiffany’s showing in the third quarter, when net earnings jumped 52 percent to $119 million as sales slipped 1 percent to $1 billion, but rose 1 percent in comparable, constant currency terms. Operating margins also increased 470 basis points to 16.4 percent of sales from 11.7 percent for the quarter.

“This year has certainly stress-tested the corporate strategies we set in 2017 to strengthen the brand and win in the highly competitive global luxury jewelry market,” the ceo said.

Bogliolo and chief artistic director Reed Krakoff have been working to revamp Tiffany, breathing new life into what is one of the very few true American luxury brands.

The company’s roots go back to 1837 when Charles Lewis Tiffany opened his jewelry store in New York. The company was a pioneer, with its Blue Book, its dedicated hue, its famed boxes with white bows and its star turn in Truman Capote’s “Breakfast at Tiffany’s” and in the film starring Audrey Hepburn.

Bogliolo and Karkoff were able to take that heritage and set an expansion course, especially in China, teeing up the next leg of growth for LVMH.

There’s more than a little professional pride at stake in Tiffany’s holiday gains, given just how nasty the company’s fight with LVMH became as the two lurched from signed deal to court fight to a new deal with a somewhat lower, $16 billion price tag. (The companies initially agreed to a $135-per-share buyout in 2019 and the two sides reset that to $131.50 in October).

Along the way, the Paris-based luxury giant declared in court papers: “The business LVMH proposed to acquire in November 2019 — Tiffany & Co., a consistently highly profitable luxury retail brand — no longer exists. What remains is a mismanaged business that over the first half of 2020 hemorrhaged cash for the first time in a quarter century, with no end to its problems in sight.”

Given the deal reset and the strong showing in the third quarter and over the holiday season, that now looks like a bit of legal bluster in the heat of a court standoff.

Tiffany will strengthen LVMH’s position in hard luxury and also give it a much stronger foothold in the U.S. market.

Arnault is expected to keep with his practice of installing someone from within the LVMH empire to run the business.

Sources have pointed to Anthony Ledru, LVMH’s executive vice president of global commercial activities based in Paris, as among the top candidates to move into the corner office and succeed Bogliolo.

In Tiffany’s sales update, chairman Roger Farah thanked Tiffany’s employees on behalf of the company’s board and specifically mentioned Bogliolo in a manner that seemed to be something of a warm send-off.

“We are so proud of all the employees at Tiffany whose sound strategic decisions and collective actions allowed the company to persevere in this challenging and ever-changing year and raise the standard of stewardship for a global luxury jeweler,” Farah said. “We congratulate and thank Alessandro for the remarkable achievement of elevating and modernizing the brand over the past three years, and the extraordinary management team and all the employees for a job superbly done.”

Propelled to world no. 4 thanks to winning the U.S. Open, she would go on the become the world no. 1 after winning the Australian Open title in 2019. Osaka has held several sponsorships in the past in relation to her tennis career, but only recently has the soon-to-be Olympian partnered with more fashion-focused companies.

“I’m excited and honored to join TAG Heuer as brand ambassador,” says Osaka in a statement. “It’s a partnership and friendship that exemplifies our shared mindset and values. The brand’s trailblazing approach with their ‘Don’t crack under pressure’ motto speaks to the way I live my life both on and off the court.”

“We are very proud to have Naomi join the TAG Heuer family,” the watchmaker’s CEO, Frédéric Arnault, added. “Her athletic record and commitment to excellence are outstanding but even more impressive is her passionate spirit and drive for advocacy which is an inspiration to so many. We are excited to support Naomi as she kicks off her 2021 season and prepares for her Olympic debut.”

The business has installed Anthony Ledru as Tiffany’s chief executive, and Alexandre Arnault as executive vice president – LMVH chief executive Bernard Arnault’s son – while Michael Burke will chair the business’ board.

Tiffany’s current chief executive Alessandro Bogliolo will remain on board to assist a smooth transition and will then depart on Jan 22, along with several other executives.

“I’m honored to have led Tiffany as a public company and contributed with such a talented team to further strengthening Tiffany’s iconic standing,” Bogliolo said.

“Thanks to the hard work and commitment of all our team members, Tiffany is ideally positioned to continue its growth.”

Bogliolo’s replacement, Ledru, formerly served as Tiffany’s senior vice president of North America between 2013-14, and said he is excited to rejoin and lead the business.

Is Hedi Slimane's Celine Working? | BoF - The Business of Fashion,"Tue, 19 Jan 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzb2ZmYXNoaW9uLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy9sdXh1cnkvaXMtaGVkaS1zbGltYW5lcy1jZWxpbmUtd29ya2luZy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Shooting yourself in the foot doesn’t usually kill you. Except in fashion, an industry where projects that get off to a rocky start are rarely given a chance to get back on track.

Under star designer Hedi Slimane, LVMH’s Celine is hoping to be an exception to that rule. After a debut show in September 2018 that seemed to alienate — even outrage — much of the audience the brand had built up under his predecessor Phoebe Philo, Slimane has followed up on that divisive start with a spate of collections that more deftly balanced his own taste for the young, thin and cool with market expectations for Celine to cater to a more mature base. Slimane’s pivot from “baby rockers” to a neo-bourgeois, Paris Left-Bank mood for Autumn/Winter 2019 proved influential, and the timely vision of youth fashion he presented for the coming spring could help win over a new generation of fans.

But even as Slimane seems to be finding his footing — and as LVMH continues to plaster fashion capitals with billboards featuring the black-and-white photographs he shoots himself for the brand — the pandemic has created a tough environment in which to stage a comeback. Financial analysts believe Celine, for which LVMH doesn’t break out sales or profit in its reports, has yet to make much progress on its target to become a brand with 2 to 3 billion euros in annual sales within five years of Slimane’s appointment.

Still, there are signs that the project may be turning a corner: Slimane’s Celine is gaining traction in the key Chinese market, he’s built a roster of influential celebrity spokespeople and while the pandemic has seen many clients flocking to the biggest blue-chip brands, his insistence on elevating “just clothes” into a luxury wardrobe could hit the mark following a multi-year fashion cycle dominated by over-the-top propositions from Gucci and Balenciaga.

In an industry that trades in first impressions, can Hedi Slimane still make his Celine a hit? Nearly three years after the star designer took over the brand, BoF breaks down what’s worked, what hasn’t, and where Celine might go from here.

Debut backlash

During a decade at Celine, Slimane’s predecessor Phoebe Philo built one of the most devoted followings in the business by designing for women who saw themselves as empowered, intellectual and discerning. Her products like Luggage totes, fur-lined Birkenstock sandals and swaddling turtleneck sweaters transformed Celine from a middling leather goods brand to a business with nearly €1 billion in annual sales — as well as the kind of place where Slimane, fresh off of star turns at Saint Laurent and Dior Homme, would actually work.

So Slimane’s Celine debut — in which the designer sent out an army of very thin, very young creatures in baby-doll dresses, ankle boots and cutesy fascinator hats — was not only brazenly similar to what he’d designed for Saint Laurent just a few seasons before, it felt like a betrayal to many of the clients who had been voting with their wallets for Philo’s more mature and sophisticated vision of how women should dress.

The strengths of the collection, and the precision of its execution, were apparently beside the point. Slimane’s strict curation of vintage references, expert styling, and the way his tailoring had evolved from truly skinny to a shape that was slim, but just slouchy enough to convey Parisian insouciance, were drowned out by the presence of such infantilising propositions.

English-speaking press were particularly unreceptive: on the same day as the controversial confirmation hearing for US Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh, and with the #MeToo movement in full swing, Slimane and LVMH had picked the wrong moment to suggest women trade in their turtlenecks for abbreviated, sparkly mini-dresses or wrap themselves up like presents in giant bows.

“The female point of view appears to have fallen out of style,” Telegraph’s Lisa Armstrong wrote. “Here we go again,” Vanessa Friedman wrote for The New York Times, calling out the designer for not evolving his vision as he took over yet another brand, and calling the hats “haute flea market.” Writing for BoF, Tim Blanks purported to detect “a gust of toxic masculinity.”

Crowded field

Two years later, it’s safe to say the most vocal detractors of Slimane’s debut may have been overreacting — at least a tiny bit — when they attempted to align Slimane’s collection with the many indignities of living in a patriarchy.

But the issue of being out of step with the times was real, and went beyond the immediate political context. At Dior Homme and Saint Laurent, Slimane had made a name for himself by marketing youth style and culture through tight jeans, biker jackets and skinny ties. But with hip-hop having supplanted rock music as the dominant cultural force, relaxed, streetwear-inspired silhouettes had become the preferred mode of dress and were driving the success of brands like Off-White and Balenciaga.

As Celine branched into menswear for the first time ever, athletic-inspired “dad sneakers” and limited-edition skateboarding shoes were what had been driving sales in the category, not pointy leather boots.

Slimane also faced a crowded market for his signature aesthetic: as his reputation for possessing a Midas touch had grown during tenures at Dior Homme and Saint Laurent, copycats had sprung up at every price point, both for his skinny silhouettes and for his creative approach of tapping into nostalgia and the demand for authenticity by curating and reissuing vintage looks. From The Kooples to Suitsupply to Zara, Slimane’s revolution had made its way to every corner of the fashion market.

Meanwhile in the luxury space, Slimane’s successor at Saint Laurent, Anthony Vaccarello, was largely sticking to the slick, monochromatic template his predecessor had put in place, taking the fashion story forward a bit each season without alienating Slimane’s acolytes. He, too, has delved frequently into Yves Saint Laurent’s archives for inspiration, and has a knack for using those references to market a certain vision of youth. Up until the pandemic in early 2020, the brand, which is more widely known than Celine and has a more established history in categories beyond leather goods, had been growing at double-digit rates for 38 consecutive quarters, despite changing designers in 2016.

As many of Phoebe Philo’s clients quit Celine — in favour of Bottega Veneta, The Row and Hermès, some said — Slimane’s fans at Saint Laurent seemed happy to stay put. On menswear forums where “Slimaniacs” gather, Vaccarello’s propositions are still discussed as viable options more than two years after Hedi returned to the business at Celine.

Neo-bourgeois turnaround

The divisive start and crowded market have made for a rocky transition, with Celine’s retail sales under pressure through most of 2019, according to company sources, who spoke anonymously as the brand’s financials are not publicly reported.

Sales had returned to growth in late 2019 and were growing by double-digits until the pandemic struck early last year, one of the sources said, as clients’ fervour for protecting Philo’s legacy faded and as Slimane continued to build out his vision of Parisian wardrobe dressing, pivoting to more mature propositions inspired less by nightlife and more by a literary, Left-Bank mood with wool blazers, culottes, and shearling-lined boots.

Holed up in a Saint-Tropez villa, Slimane had landed on what felt like a more considered edit from the Yves Saint Laurent heyday he frequently references — proposing softer, less sexed-up pieces aimed at the mature client Celine is historically known for serving. After a debut that shook the market’s confidence in whether he was still a fashion leader, Slimane’s subsequent collections were as influential as ever: various takes on “neo-bourgeois” dressing and 1970s throwbacks started popping up on runways across Paris, London and Milan.

The ethereal black-and-white photos he was shooting for the house also helped to build a visual universe in which his products, including ladylike, ultra-classic handbags, made more sense. The images, usually displayed within a thick white border, are not always easy to digest when viewed on a tiny smartphone screen (another timeliness problem), but they do communicate a message of simplicity and timeless luxury.

“He has a similar talent for styling and photography as Karl Lagerfeld did,” Babeth Djian, founder of the French fashion magazine Numéro said. “What he’s creating isn’t bourgeois, it’s a fantasy of the bourgeoisie — which is totally different.”

China inflection

While Slimane’s vision was not an instant success among the fashion influencer set — who continued to post Philo’s creations under the tribute hashtag “#oldceline” — it has steadily built up visibility through smart placements with A-list celebrities, including the South Korean pop singer Lisa from girl-group Blackpink (who is popular in China, as well, due to her role judging a hit singing competition) and model-heiress Kaia Gerber. While Celine continues to sell favourite bags from the Philo era, those stars have fuelled rising awareness of new options like satchels with the brand’s historic “Triomphe” logo (brought back by Slimane) and a monogrammed canvas line.

The flagship “16” handbag, first debuted by Lady Gaga during a visit to the Louvre, is also gaining interest as the brand rolls out a more supple, slightly less expensive version.

In China, online buzz for Celine by Phoebe Philo remained almost as elevated as for Slimane until April 2020, when posts on social media related to Celine by Hedi Slimane finally surged far ahead, according to Launchmetrics’ China subsidiary Parklu. His notoriety was rising just as China’s coronavirus lockdowns ended and luxury sales — fuelled by so-called “revenge spending” and the repatriation of shopping that typically occurred on shopping trips abroad — exploded in the key market.

Celine is benefitting in China from an increased presence on WeChat, where the brand’s mini-program integrates its social media content with opportunities to buy products instantly, noted Iris Chan, partner at the Digital Luxury Group.

Celine’s sales in Mainland China accelerated sharply following the lockdowns, and remained at high rates going into the fourth quarter, one source familiar with the matter said.

(Although rapid growth in Mainland China indicates traction, Chan says to take that signal with a grain of salt. “It can be easy for brands like this to see growth happening at exponential rates, because they didn’t have a lot to grow from. I don’t see it being a standout now in the overall market.” Due to the prevalence of shopping abroad, a brand’s domestic sales often need to double or triple to make up for lost tourist sales to Chinese consumers.)

After sales were hammered by the pandemic, Celine’s worldwide business saw a “good improvement” in the third quarter, according to LVMH’s results presentation.

Estimates vary widely for how the brand is doing today, with analysts saying sales could be down between 7 and 40 percent year-on-year for 2020.

So where is Celine headed? While the coronavirus crisis and resulting economic uncertainty has caused consumers to refocus on the most established and sought-after propositions like Chanel quilted flap bags and Louis Vuitton’s Neverfull totes, that same impulse to spend more carefully could see them gravitate to the ultra-classic, “just clothes” approach to luxury Slimane is pushing at Celine.

And Hedi has started to make in-roads at bridging his vision of timeless luxury with the tastes of the moment, particularly among younger shoppers: criticism that his vision of youth is stuck in another time has faded following his online fashion shows for Spring 2021, titled the “Dancing Kid” for men — a tribute to Tik-Tok-fuelled “e-boy” culture with oversized fits, colourful track jackets and mis-matched printed pants — and “A Portrait of a Generation,” his womenswear show that also took inspiration from the eclectic, high-low dressing habits of Generation Z. He introduced a range of sportier and more logo-heavy products, as well as showing off ways to mix Celine’s bourgeois staples like tailored blazers with more comfortable athleisure items could help broaden the brand’s audience (even if some critics found the logomania felt out of place at the brand).

Portrait of a Generation Celine’s “Portrait of a Generation” (left) and “Dancing Kid” (video still, right) collections paid tribute to TikTok-fuelled Gen-Z fashion. Celine.

“I want those girls to be my friends,” Filippo Grazioli, a freelance womenswear designer who previously worked at Givenchy, Burberry and Hermès, said. “It’s simple garments, but who is buying complicated stuff now?”

“The brand is getting back on track as the collections evolve,” Mia Young, chief merchant at the Hong Kong-based department store chain Lane Crawford, said. “The mix of timeless luxury with more dressed-down pieces should help build on momentum with younger clients.”

Menswear in particular is starting to gain traction, Young said, and she expects it to accelerate with the arrival of more colourful pieces and relaxed silhouettes for spring.

‘Light at the end of the tunnel’

Even if Celine seems to be turning a corner, it almost surely remains far behind the targets set for it by its parent company, despite high levels of investment. (Slimane was paid at least 10 million dollars per year during his last role at Saint Laurent, according to a court settlement between the designer and the brand’s owner, Kering. Increased marketing spending on Celine, while undisclosed, has been manifest both on social media and in fashion capitals throughout the world.)

Executives at LVMH and Celine declined to comment for this story. But how Celine is performing, and what level of support it will continue to receive from its parent company, could be addressed at next week’s annual results presentation, where chairman Bernard Arnault will take questions from analysts and investors.

“There is likely some disappointment, but I think they see a light at the end of the tunnel,” said Erwan Rambourg, luxury analyst at HSBC. “The luxury of running 75 brands is that you can be patient with some. LVMH is inclined to expect that inflections are going to accelerate.”

“I would be surprised if Bernard Arnault pulled the plug.”

Louis Vuitton Reveals SS21 LV Trainer Upcycling Collection - HYPEBEAST,"Mon, 18 Jan 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vaHlwZWJlYXN0LmNvbS8yMDIxLzEvbG91aXMtdnVpdHRvbi1sdi10cmFpbmVyLXVwY3ljbGluZy1zcHJpbmctc3VtbWVyLTIwMjEtY29sbGVjdGlvbi1yZXZlYWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Louis Vuitton‘s latest Spring/Summer 2021 LV Trainer Upcycling collection reflects Virgil Abloh‘s step towards sustainability.

Abloh’s “upcycling ideology” was conceived for the SS21 collection as a way to showcase the luxury fashion house’s commitment to reimagining Louis Vuitton products both creatively and sustainably. The sneakers debuted at Abloh’s inaugural Men’s Louis Vuitton show during the SS19 season and immediately solidified Alboh’s imprint in the industry, due to the bold and alluring design of the shoes.

In order to create this season’s sustainable upcycling collection, the original 2019 LV Trainers were disassembled and reworked during the creative production process at Louis Vuitton’s dedicated shoe workshop in Fiesso d’Artico. The new LV Trainer Upcycling includes a revamped design using staple materials of calfskin and suede, while also featuring tie-dye colored laces.

The low-top silhouette includes five new colorways in vibrant, contrasting tones, set to emphasize the padded tongue and the shoe’s upper design. Stitched on the back of the shoes is “LV Upcycling”, alongside the Louis Vuitton branding and emblematic Monogram flowers on the sole. To round out the shoe, a fluorescent tag is featured on the right foot, embossed with a Louis Vuitton logo, a signature finish synonymous with Virgil Abloh.

Each pair offers a unique experience for Louis Vuitton fans everywhere as the shoe provides do-it-yourself customization options. Assembly instructions are included to ensure the brand’s craftsmanship is not compromised, guiding users in centering, cutting, and hand-applying the leather. Future owners have access to the excess stitching threads to add personal finishing touches to their LV Trainer Upcycle.

Release and price information has yet to be revealed, but are expected to arrive in the coming weeks.

In case you missed it, key sneakers, including the LV Trainer Upcycling are on view at Louis Vuitton’s sneakers “Hall of Fame” pop-up store in Paris."
Terry Smith has bought shares in LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton – should you too? - The Telegraph,"Tue, 05 Jan 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRlbGVncmFwaC5jby51ay9tb25leS9pbnZlc3RpbmcvbmV3cy90ZXJyeS1zbWl0aC1oYXMtYm91Z2h0LXNoYXJlcy1sdm1oLW1vZXQtaGVubmVzc3ktbG91aXMtdnVpdHRvbi_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Renowned fund manager Terry Smith has snapped up shares in luxury goods firm LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, marking a rare new buy for his £23.2bn Fundsmith Equity fund.

Mr Smith built up the stake in December. The new position follows his swoop on shares in Nike and Starbucks in March last year, in a relative flurry of activity for an investor who styles his approach as “buy good companies, don’t overpay, do nothing”.

Fundsmith Equity is the largest fund in Britain, as investors have flocked to the manager’s strong returns. Over five years the fund is up 138.6pc, well ahead of the average 78.6pc return from rival global funds.

Shares in LVMH, whose brands include the Louis Vuitton fashion business and Moët & Chandon champagne, have enjoyed a meteoric rise, nearly quadrupling investors’ money over the past five years.

The stock did well in 2020 despite the impact of the pandemic and currently trades at €512 (£455), but Erwan Rambourg of investment bank HSBC thinks there is more to come.

The analyst has a “buy” rating on the company. He noted that it had been a clear winner during the pandemic as people purchased fewer, but higher quality, items.

The Louis Vuitton brand, whose handbags were “instrumental” and which had a large imprint across the fashion industry, had done particularly well, while its Christian Dior brand had also continued its “stratospheric” rise, he said."
Why 2021 will be a bumper year for M&A - Vogue Business,"Fri, 01 Jan 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZvZ3VlYnVzaW5lc3MuY29tL2NvbXBhbmllcy93aHktMjAyMS13aWxsLWJlLWEtYnVtcGVyLXllYXItZm9yLW1hbmRh0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"After months of quiet and stalled deals, 2020 closed in a flurry of M&A (mergers and acquisitions) activity, setting a pace that is likely to continue in 2021. That’s the view of analysts across the luxury sector.

“Covid has added to the pressure from demand going to a very concentrated number of winning brands,” says Francesca Di Pasquantonio, head of luxury goods, equity research at Deutsche Bank. “This creates the conditions that are favourable to selling to others, merging with others or joining forces to be able to scale, but also to leverage expertise or talent.”

Three acquisitions totalling nearly $20 billion dominated the final quarter of 2020. The deal of the year was finally closed in October, when LVMH agreed to pay a slightly reduced $15.8 billion for US jewellery brand Tiffany, the luxury sector’s biggest ever deal. In November, VF Corporation, owner of Timberland, Vans and The North Face, bought streetwear brand Supreme for $2.1 billion. And finally, in early December, Moncler acquired menswear brand Stone Island for $1.4 billion.

Expect more of the same in 2021. Borrowing costs remain extremely low by historical standards, to the advantage of companies in a strong financial position seeking to invest. As government support schemes are wound back in a post-pandemic world, weaker brands with consumer appeal will come under pressure. Meanwhile, private equity has built a significant war chest over 2020 — and luxury fashion remains an attractive draw.

Tommaso Nastasi, partner at Deloitte Italy, which monitors luxury transactions, outlines the big three trends for M&A in 2021: conglomerates looking for an opportunity to consolidate, luxury brands stepping up vertical integration by investing in distressed parts of their supply chain, and a focus on investment in digital expertise and the APAC region.

Consolidation is a long-term trend in the luxury sector that is likely to continue, says Di Pasquantonio of Deutsche Bank. “The trends on the balance sheet and free cash flow generation driven by the business models, which generally make luxury companies very highly profitable… really justify the use of cash to build external growth on top of organic growth.”

Short-term and long-term goals both play a part. LVMH is looking for growth over the long term with its acquisition of Tiffany, seeking to replicate its 10-year development of jewellery brand Bulgari — LVMH has doubled revenue since buying the Italian company in 2011."

In keeping with its preference for promoting internal talents, the French luxury house has appointed David Ponzo to succeed Ledru as executive vice president, commercial activities, overseeing Vuitton’s network of 460 physical stores and e-commerce, with responsibility for everything from store planning and architecture to client relations.

More from WWD

Ponzo joined Vuitton in 2016 as zone president, Japan, after a prior career at Swatch Group. Nicolas Villeger succeeds him as head of Vuitton’s Japanese operations, marking his return to the LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton fold. Villeger worked for the luxury conglomerate’s travel retail division DFS from 2017 until January 2020, and had since then focused on his personal advisory firm.

Ponzo’s appointment was effective on Jan. 7, when LVMH announced the new leadership at Tiffany after a drawn-out acquisition process.

In addition to Ledru, it named Michael Burke, chairman and CEO of Louis Vuitton, as chairman of the Tiffany board of directors, and Alexandre Arnault, CEO of Rimowa since 2017 and the second eldest son of LVMH chairman and CEO Bernard Arnault, as executive vice president, product and communications.

In an internal announcement seen by WWD, Vuitton praised Ponzo’s track record. “For the past five years, David has successfully led a Japanese management team that has been synonymous with excellence including the opening of unique stores such as Maison Osaka Midosuji last year,” it said.

Villeger, meanwhile, has worked in Japan and Asia for 24 years, building expertise in retail operations and customer experience at brands including Tesla, Coach, Longchamp, Estée Lauder and Shiseido.

For the past seven years, Arnault's daughter Delphine Arnault, who is in charge of all Louis Vuitton’s product-related activities, has worked alongside Michael Burke, who is CEO of Louis Vuitton. (Bloomberg)

(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Bernard Arnault has finally taken control of Tiffany & Co.

With the acquisition being LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE’s biggest deal to date, and an expensive trophy asset despite the last-minute price cut, there’s little wonder that the company’s chief executive officer is sending experienced staffers from his flagship brand Louis Vuitton to oversee it.

More interesting is the appointment of his 28-year-old son Alexandre to a senior role at Tiffany. It is the latest example of how Arnault, the 71-year-old LVMH founder and France’s richest man, is situating his children into the world’s biggest luxury group, readying them for eventual succession.

It’s a smart move, and one that is playing out across the industry, as scions from family-controlled houses like Prada SpA and cashmere-maker Brunello Cucinelli SpA are elevated to top roles. Younger, digitally focused consumers will drive high-end sales over the next decade. Who better to understand them than the next generation of luxury dynasties? They’re bling kids themselves.

Alexandre Arnault will become executive vice president of product and communications at Tiffany. He was previously CEO of Rimowa, the luggage company that LVMH acquired in 2016, which had been growing until travel seized up with the pandemic. His digital and fashion credentials include spearheading Rimowa’s successful collaborations with streetwear houses Supreme and Virgil Abloh’s Off-White.

Such experience will be crucial at Tiffany. Creating a buzz about the storied brand will be imperative for appealing to millennial and Gen Z consumers, particularly in Asia. These customers also care deeply about brand values, so differentiating Tiffany on sustainability will be important too.

But the younger Arnault will also be tasked with elevating Tiffany’s luxury status. Consequently, he’ll be flanked by two top Louis Vuitton managers: rising star Anthony Ledru, who will become Tiffany’s chief executive, and Michael Burke, one of Bernard Arnault’s most trusted lieutenants, who will become its chairman.

Pairing his children with experienced executives is a pattern that Arnault has used before. For the past seven years, his daughter Delphine Arnault, who is in charge of all Louis Vuitton’s product-related activities, has worked alongside Burke, who is CEO of Louis Vuitton.

Meanwhile, in watches, his son Frederic Arnault was recently appointed as CEO of Tag Heuer. He’d worked alongside Swiss watch industry veteran Jean-Claude Biver earlier in his career, overseeing Tag Heuer’s smartwatches.

It’s a similar story outside of LVMH.

At rival Kering SA, founder Francois Pinault already handed over the reins to his son Francois-Henri, who has been chairman and CEO since 2005. One of the key tenets of Pinault junior, now 58, has been sustainability, which Kering says it has put at the heart of its strategy.

At Prada SpA, Lorenzo Bertelli, the 32-year-old son of Miuccia Prada and co-chief executive officer Patrizio Bertelli, leads marketing and communications as well as the group’s corporate social responsibility function. As a former racing driver with little business experience, his appointment two years ago raised eyebrows. But he has done well so far by pushing e-commerce and a sustainability agenda. Digital investment and a focus on environment-friendly fabrics (his first major initiative was unveiling nylon products made out of recycled ocean plastic, fishing nets and textile industry waste) have likely benefited Prada’s turnaround efforts.

For both Prada and LVMH, a changing of the guard still looks a ways off. If family succession is the outcome — and whoever gets the job must be well qualified — Bertelli looks the frontrunner at Prada, while the field is wide open at LVMH. Alongside Delphine, Alexandre and Frederic, their brother Antoine Arnault is also involved in the business, with roles including responsibility for LVMH’s communications and environmental strategy. The youngest son Jean is finishing his studies.

When the time comes, Bernard Arnault could hand everything over to one of his children, or he could split his responsibilities between them, with some siblings leading the most important divisions. The latter path would help prevent a family feud, while putting Europe’s second most valuable company in a stronger position to anticipate emerging trends.

How Tiffany’s future shapes up will help determine not only whether Arnault was right to press ahead with the deal, but which of these succession scenarios eventually prevails."

LVMH has reported an overall decline in revenues for 2020 despite a recovery in the Asian market.

The luxury retail group, which owns Louis Vuitton and Dior, reported sales drop 17 per cent year on year to €44.7 billion (£39.5 billion) in 2020.

In the fourth quarter, revenues declined by three per cent on a like-for-like basis compared with the same period the previous year, with a strong performance from LVMH’s fashion and leather goods division.

Sales of fashion and leather goods grew by 18 per cent to €7.3 billion (£6.5 billion) in the fourth quarter compared to 2019, beating expectations.

Sales for the group’s biggest brands, Louis Vuitton and Dior, reached double-digit growth in the second half of the year despite the impact of the pandemic and restrictions across most of Europe during the festive shopping season.

This recovery was mostly due to improvement in the Asian market, as well as an uptick in sales in the US and Japan.

LVMH chair and chief executive Bernard Arnault said the group showed “remarkable resilience” against the Covid-19 pandemic.

“Our focus on dynamic innovation was accompanied by strong commitments to the environment, sustainability and inclusion,” Arnault said.

“We are starting 2021 with the pleasure of welcoming the iconic jewellery Maison Tiffany and its teams to our group.

“In a context that remains uncertain, even with the hope of vaccination giving us a glimpse of an end to the pandemic, we are confident that LVMH is in an excellent position to build upon the recovery for which the world wishes in 2021 and to further strengthen our lead in the global luxury market.”
