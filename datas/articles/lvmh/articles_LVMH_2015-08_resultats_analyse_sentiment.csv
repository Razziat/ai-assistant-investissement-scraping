Is Céline's creative director looking for a way out? - Page Six,"Mon, 10 Aug 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vcGFnZXNpeC5jb20vMjAxNS8wOC8xMC9pcy1jZWxpbmVzLWNyZWF0aXZlLWRpcmVjdG9yLWxvb2tpbmctZm9yLWEtd2F5LW91dC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Click to email a link to a friend (Opens in new window)

Phoebe Philo, creative director of French fashion house ­Céline, is looking to leave the company, sources tell Page Six.

The designer and fashion industry darling has been at Céline since 2008, working out of London and traveling to the Paris headquarters for fittings and shows.

But industry chatter in Milan is that Philo “is getting bored of [Céline’s parent company] LVMH and being in Paris so much. She wants to stay more with her family,” which is also based in the UK.

Philo has three children with her husband, gallerist Max Wigram.

She first started working under Stella McCartney at Chloé in 1997, and rose to creative director when McCartney left to launch her own line in 2001.

Philo resigned from Chloé in 2006 to focus on her family, but returned to fashion and joined Céline two years later.

Insiders says she’s in discussions with luxury firm Richemont, which owns Chloé, Azzedine Alaïa and Cartier, for a position at one of their brands.

But other sources say news of Philo’s departure is not true.

A rep for LVMH declined to comment.

Seafolly's expansion plans with LVMH could earn it a place in the sun - The Australian Financial Review,"Fri, 28 Aug 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFmci5jb20vbGlmZS1hbmQtbHV4dXJ5L3NlYWZvbGx5cy1leHBhbnNpb24tcGxhbnMtd2l0aC1sdm1oLWNvdWxkLWVhcm4taXQtYS1wbGFjZS1pbi10aGUtc3VuLTIwMTUwNzIxLWdpaDRhZdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"His interest was piqued enough for him to make a pit stop in hot, steamy Singapore on his way back from a selling trip to Europe. As monsoonal rain fell outside, Halas sat inside L Capital Asia's headquarters, listening to Thakran, his head of operations and the head buyer for duty-free operator DFS (majority owned by LVMH) talk about what the group could bring to Seafolly.

Thakran was well versed on Australia, having been on something of an Australian buying spree in previous years. L Capital has outlaid $52 million for a 49.9 per cent stake in bush outfitter RM Williams, $80 million for 40 per cent of performance sportswear company 2XU, and about $20 million for gourmet food chain Jones the Grocer. He also knew of Seafolly; he walks past one of its stores most days on the way to his office.

""Ravi had just come back from a Byron Bay silent health retreat,"" Halas recalls. ""He had clear eyes, focused thought and great energy."" Thakran understood both the challenges and the opportunities. Seafolly has 42 stores in Australia, branded both Seafolly and Sunburn (the latter selling other labels too), and sells through 1200 doors in 46 other countries, from Neiman Marcus in the United States and Harrods in London to Galeries Lafayette in France.

There was a huge opportunity to do more offshore, to sell Australia's sun-and-sand reputation to the world via a brand that epitomised it. It was also logical to take Seafolly further beyond swimwear, deeper into the allied beach sectors in which it was already dabbling. Both strategies would need capital but, just as importantly, something more than money. Thakran got it. ""It's the ability to connect with the right influences and the right people,"" Thakran says now. ""We often don't look at spreadsheets at board meetings. Our focus in our workshops is more about the brand and the delivery of the products and retail merchandising.""

Halas left Singapore promising to mull it over. It would take many more months, meetings and family discussions before, in February 2014, Halas and Thakran were back around a boardroom table, this time hammering out the mechanics of a deal.

Nearly 10 months later, as Australians dusted off their swimmers in preparation for the 2014 summer holidays, L Capital announced that it had agreed to pay $70 million for a 70 per cent share of Seafolly. The Halas family would retain the remaining 30 per cent.

They intend to grow sales from $120 million in 2014-15 to $250 million within three years. The idea is for international sales to jump from one-third to about two-thirds of the business, and for Seafolly to morph from a swimwear label into a true lifestyle brand.

Australia has already delivered a swimwear brand to the world: Speedo, which is now owned by UK-based Pentland Group. But where that's primarily a sports brand, Seafolly plays in the fashion pool.

It won't be easy. Seafolly accounts for about 35 per cent of the $250 million Australian fashion swimwear market, according to LEK Consulting, but the $US18 billion ($24.4 billion) global beachwear market is a much more crowded space. Quiksilver, Billabong International, Eveden Group, Equatorsun and Jantzen are only some of the companies competing for a slice of the global swimsuit dollar.

Add to them Seafolly's biggest international threats, Victoria's Secret and German brand Maryan Mehlhorn, and a suite of boutique Australian labels, among them Zimmerman, Jets, Sunseeker and Baku, and it starts to look like a great idea that might be harder to pull off than it sounds.

David Bush, fashion business consultant and a former senior executive at David Jones, is a believer, noting that Australian swimwear companies have a particular edge. ""The world perhaps neglects [us in] other apparel categories but certainly looks to Australia for swimwear,"" he says.

He thinks the research and development Seafolly puts into the construction of its outfits will stand it in good stead. ""They know that when madam goes to the beach and jumps in the waves and runs after the kids, the fit and function does what it's supposed to do. I can spot Zimmerman or Seafolly swimwear at the other end of the beach, and I don't find that with other swimwear.""

At 75, Peter is still a director. He comes in once a week to attend a management meeting and have lunch with Anthony.

Gigi Hadid at the office

Seafolly's headquarters in Mascot, Sydney, are much more basic than the glamorous home of Louis Vuitton across town in King Street, where the deal with LVMH was nutted out. Seafolly girls past and present line the walls. A giant picture of current ambassador Gigi Hadid leans next to a Seafolly-printed surfboard in Anthony's office. Down on the ground floor, several women are hunched over sewing machines, making prototypes for next season. The space looks a little cramped for its 110-odd employees and there's the constant drone of aircraft overhead.

But it feels as if the sun is shining for Anthony, Peter and Yvonne, who could not be happier about the ""whole new world"" L Capital has opened up for their once little bikini company. They have just returned from a trip to Paris, where they had breakfast with LVMH chairman and majority owner Bernard Arnault.

""We also spent a day with [LVMH chief executive] Sidney Toledano, who [also runs] Christian Dior,"" Anthony enthuses. ""The inspiration and ideas are extraordinary. It's a world I would have never had access to. We have access to global resources, which will help us reach our goal of being a beach lifestyle brand.""

We're sitting in Anthony's office, which is just across the hallway from that of Peter, who at 75 is still a director but only comes in on Tuesdays, to participate in a weekly management meeting and have lunch with his son. Peter wears a black T-shirt, jeans and black Prada trainers – his standard apparel.

Yvonne, 73, wears a brown sundress, a gigantic single pearl necklace bought in Japan and moderately tinted sunglasses, which she keeps on. Anthony, 47, also looks good, having inherited his parents' fine looks and smart casual dress sense.

Family photos take pride of place in the offices of both Peter and Anthony, whose relationship appears to be that of mentor and pupil and good friends, as well as father and son. Peter and Yvonne are happy for their son to take the limelight, although they enjoy the stroll down memory lane to the beginnings not just of their business, but their Australian lives.

From Hungary to hope

Like so many in the rag trade, Peter's story is one of immigrant success built from hard grind and the good luck of growing a business in lockstep with the Australian fashion industry. Born and raised in Hungary, Peter set off on the path towards Australia in the wake of Hungary's 1956 Communist Revolution. His father, who had survived a Nazi death camp but lost his wife and parents along the way, urged his son to get as far away from the mess of Europe as possible.

The 17-year-old Peter and four friends walked 120 kilometres to the Austrian border, travelling at night and hiding in barns during the day. It was the dead of winter but Peter had ignored his father's advice to pack something practical like underwear and a sweater, instead stuffing his backpack with books.

Peter arrived at a refugee camp near Innsbruck and promptly applied to come to Australia. Six months later, his permit came through. He arrived in Australia in June 1957, settling in Bondi Beach. It was there in 1960 that he met Yvonne, who was also of Hungarian descent and had also lost a parent during World War II, in her case a father. Yvonne had emigrated to Australia as a child.

Yvonne describes seeing ""this very tortured, poetic-looking man on the beach smoking a cigarette"", and says she literally fell at his feet. Then 18 and 20, they had tea and a beer at a local pub before the 6pm closing. ""I went home and told my mother, 'I met the man I want to marry.'"" And marry they did; the pair recently clocked up 54 years together.

During the early years Yvonne worked for the Packers, checking knitting patterns and recipes for The Australian Women's Weekly. Ita Buttrose was doing the social pages and they were all under strict instructions not to look at the Packers if they walked past.

Peter got a job as a manufacturer's sales agent, flogging sportswear and swimwear on commission to hundreds of small customers. There were many department stores, though none as big as today's heavyweights, Myer and David Jones.

""I tried to do a university course [studying science] at night, but I found it too difficult to work and make a living plus study at night and [have] a social life so after about 18 months I dropped out,"" he says. ""I realised I was good at sales so I got into an agency for clothing.""

Pretty soon he was a partner in a swimwear manufacturer called Waterlilly. It was a good time to be in bathers, which – thanks to the 1970s' sexual revolution – were changing. Bikini tops were suddenly little more than bras and one-piece costumes were revealing ever more hip. After eight years, an exhausted Peter wanted out of the rag trade, and sold out of Waterlilly. He looked around for other options but with his $18,000 payout burning a hole in his pocket he was soon back in the game, founding Peter's Folly in 1975, which later became Seafolly.

Returning to the rag trade ""a terrible folly""

""I said I'd never get back into the rag trade because it was just too hard, but I realised that that was the only thing I really knew,"" he says. ""So we got back in and someone said, 'Well that is a terrible folly.' That's how Peter's Folly came about.""

A non-compete clause stopped him from entering the swimwear market but he wasn't too fussed. In the mid-'70s it was all about denim: denim dresses, jeans, shorts, even denim-covered furniture. Peter's Folly jumped on the bandwagon, making denim sundresses for, among other clients, Myer, which placed the first order with the company for a grand total of $261.80.

By this point the couple had two children, Anthony and Simonne. Yvonne worked the reception and dispatch in between raising the children, while Peter ran the company. Design and manufacturing were done in-house. ""At the beginning people asked me what was the vision,"" Peter says. ""The vision was to put food on the table.""

Waterlilly went bust not long after Peter's Folly was established. Peter and Yvonne took the opportunity to dive back into swimwear, a category in which the hottest name at the time was Brian Rochford.

By 1980 annual sales had reached $8 million but Seafolly desperately needed money. Like many small businesses, cash flow was tight and it was hard to get a bank loan. Enter clothing importer Daniel Chen, who went on to be a perennial on the BRW Rich List. Chen bought 51 per cent of the company, essentially underwriting it. ""If Daniel Chen hadn't come along, we would have been in real trouble,"" Peter says.

It was through the partnership with Chen that the business started contract manufacturing swimwear for discount retailers such as Target and Kmart. The Seafolly label remained niche as the private-label business took off, propelling the company towards annual sales of $40 million by the mid-1990s. But the world was changing fast. This contract business was under pressure from cheaper Asian imports and orders were drying up. Chen wanted to stay in private label but the Halas family wanted out.

Adding to their woes were debts from some of Chen's other businesses, which were not always kept separate from Seafolly. ""That was the time when our private-label business was struggling,"" Peter recalls. ""We knew that we should get out of private label and purely focus on Seafolly but … they had this fixed idea that it was too risky.""

It was Anthony who encouraged his father to have one of the most difficult conversations of his life: telling the man who had helped him in the early days that it was time to split. He credits his wife Andie, with whom he has three children, as being instrumental in the decision. ""She was quite strong, saying 'This is our future; we have to make a decision about the Chen family.'""

After months of negotiations, Anthony bought Chen's 51 per cent stake in Seafolly for $1. Chen has since died. ""My father then very generously handed me the keys to the business,"" Anthony says.

Packing boxes for the family business

It was not the first time Anthony had been involved – it had always been a family business. Peter's father, a former oriental carpet salesman, and stepmother were finally allowed to leave Hungary in 1978 and, despite being in their 70s, they too joined Seafolly. Peter's half-brother, Andrew, also emigrated to Australia and worked in sales in the early days.

""I remember these tiny little offices on Foveaux Street in Surry Hills where all the rag trade was at the time,"" Anthony recalls. ""My grandfather was in there packing boxes; my grandmother was in there doing the accounts; my mother was the marketing PR. Every school holidays I'd be packing boxes, helping the cutters lay out fabric on the cutting tables, so it really was just part of the family.""

Nevertheless the business was doing well enough for the family to move from Bondi to Vaucluse and for Anthony and Simonne to attend private high schools.

Like his father, it had never been Anthony's dream to work in swimwear. As a young boy he'd wanted to be a vet, later studying accountancy then acting. He did commercials and even snared a role in Macbeth for Shakespeare by the Sea. But after several years delivering bread at midnight and working in cafes to make ends meet, he realised he was no Hugh Jackman.

Simonne, meanwhile, became a psychotherapist, moved to Melbourne and married Paul Kanat, who started Hugo Boss in Australia and now owns Ted Baker Australia.

After taking over the Seafolly reins in the late 1990s, Anthony wasted no time getting out of the private-label business and ramping up the Seafolly label, which had a much healthier margin. But there was a cost: the move slashed Seafolly's annual sales from $40 million to just $7 million. The business survived that first year thanks to the generosity of close family friends, who loaned the funds needed to plug the hole in earnings.

Anthony knew the gem in the rough was the Seafolly brand but had many sleepless nights about shuttering the private-label side of the business. ""I can't say it was any great knowledge that I was using to make the decision; I was going off a gut feel,"" he says.

As serendipity would have it, the separates swimwear concept was taking off, in which tops and bottoms are sold individually. Seafolly was one of the first large companies to sense the opportunity. At about the same time, Seafolly upped its marketing spend, using a rising star called Kristy Hinze in a national outdoor advertising campaign. This helped it get into shops such as Surf Dive 'n' Ski and Beach Culture, which had previously shunned it as a ""mumsy"" brand. Seafolly started investing 10 to 15 per cent of its sales revenue in marketing, up from a norm of about 3 per cent.

""This was not sensible,"" Anthony says. ""But it was a calculated risk; it was the perception that needed to be adjusted."" Since then Seafolly has raised the glamour stakes further, appointing models such as Miranda Kerr and Gigi Hadid as ambassadors and, in 2010, launching the Isola range in partnership with model Megan Gale, pitched specifically at 30- to 40-year-olds.

There were downsides to moving deeper into the cutthroat world of fashion, in which staying ahead of the style pack while remaining profitable is a tricky balance. Over the years there have been various legal stoushes, with Seafolly suing and being sued over copycat allegations.

""Our graphic team has four full-time employees; our design room has 15 employees,"" Peter says. ""We spend an enormous amount of money creating what is around you here. We will keep protecting our designs.""

The long road to finding a business partner

It wasn't until 2012 that Seafolly stopped manufacturing in Australia. It still does the design prototypes and fabric testing at Mascot, but manufactures in China and has a warehouse in Hong Kong. ""We were one of the last larger-scale apparel companies to manufacture in Australia,"" Anthony says. ""Costs got prohibitive. Plus the machinists' kids don't want to do this job.""

The process of shifting its manufacturing offshore was one of the factors that got in the way of Seafolly's previous attempts to find a partner. Most private equity firms wait to see this type of challenging transition completed before making an investment. It is understood that Pacific Brands, along with private equity players Crescent Capital Partners, CHAMP Ventures, Riverside Company and RMB Capital Partners, showed interest in the brand during the UBS sales process. Some found the Halas family's price expectations too high given the rocky retail climate; others were waiting for the offshore manufacturing shift to be finished.

While Anthony agrees investors were wary about retail, he says none of the potential partners before LVMH were the right fit. Peter says the process was distracting Anthony from running the business. ""They didn't understand where we wanted the business to go; they were pretty short-term thinkers.""

Nick Batchelor was managing director of RMB Capital Partners at the time and now works at Quadrant Private Equity. He recalls how it looked from his side. ""When we first looked at the business, they had outgrown their systems as well as their software and finance teams,"" he says. ""They were going through the typical evolution of a successful family business that is transitioning to become a corporation.

""At the time, Australian retail was really struggling, making it a difficult call to invest in such a company. To Anthony, it became clear that he would really need an international private equity partner to get the valuation and business support he was after.""

While Seafolly didn't partner with RMB, Anthony was impressed enough with Batchelor to ask him to join the Seafolly board, where he remained until the sale to L Capital. Batchelor was an instrumental adviser to Anthony during the negotiations, as were David Zwi, a partner at law firm Thomson Geer, and Peter. Both sides agreed at the outset to do the deal without formal advisers.

Russel Pillemer, co-founder of Pengana Capital, plays tennis with Anthony once a week. He says he only gave Anthony moderate advice on finding an investment partner. ""The general advice I gave him was look for the best partner, not the one who will write the biggest cheque,"" Pillemer says. ""Go with the one who will add the most value in the long term.""

The power of the LVMH name

Cue L Capital's Thakran, who flags the US as one of the first stops in taking the ""uniqueness of Australia to the world"" via the Seafolly brand. Seafolly has four stores in the US and is slated to open four more by year's end. The aim is to have 50 stores there within five years, concentrated in Florida and California with a few in strategic locations such as New York.

Seafolly has three stores in Singapore and, while it's early days, it also sees an opportunity to open stores in greater Asia, in countries such as Thailand, Indonesia, Hong Kong and China. The aim is to shift own-store business from about 38 per cent of sales to 65 per cent within five years. Indicative of its global ambitions is a decision to end the Isola partnership with Megan Gale when the contact expires in January, due to difficulties securing an international trademark for the brand, and acquire or establish a new label to fill the gap.

In terms of new categories, Seafolly's traditional kaftans and cover-ups will be expanded next year to include active wear, followed by more premium resort wear such as dresses and jumpsuits. Designs for accessories such as beach bags, hats, towels, footwear and eyewear will be revamped, and jewellery and beach chairs may be added. The goal is to triple accessories sales over the next five years from today's $6 million. ""When a woman picks things up for a beach holiday, she will pick up many things like sun care, hats and sandals,"" Thakran says. ""Each of these are opportunities ... [And] what about men – apparel and more accessories?""

Anthony had confirmation of the power of LVMH on a recent trip to California. ""I was with one of the representatives from LVMH and we were sitting with a landlord. The way the landlord spoke to me sitting with LVMH there was very different to if I was just there as a bikini manufacturer on my own,"" he says.

If Seafolly pulls off the international push, it will become one of only a handful of Australian retail brands to make it big overseas, joining the likes of Billabong International (despite its more recent troubles), Quiksilver, Rip Curl and Cotton On. It is too early to say how long L Capital will stay involved, or whether it will eventually take the company through to a public float in Australia or the US. No one is focused on that just yet.

As for Peter and Yvonne, they recently sold their beach house at Terrigal and bought an $8 million property in Darling Point. Peter is still up by 6am most days, walking along the cliffs from Bondi to Bronte. He loves street photography and says he needs more wall space to house his collection of work by artist Joshua Yeldham. He and Yvonne are also active in charitable work, principally through Courage to Care and their daughter-in-law Andie's new charity, Thread Together, which provides clothes to people in need.

The couple remain grounded on the meaning of success. ""Having lived through the Holocaust and lived through the revolution, having peace that I can wake up in the morning is having success,"" Peter says.

Adds Yvonne: ""I also feel having an amicable family situation and seeing the children happy is success.""

B&W owner hopes to become a big noise for speaker firm - The Guardian,"Sat, 29 Aug 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy8yMDE1L2F1Zy8yOS9zb2Z0LXNwb2tlbi1iLWFuZC13LW93bmVyLXR1cm5zLXVwLXNvdW5kLWZvci1zcGVha2VyLWZpcm3SAWpodHRwczovL2FtcC50aGVndWFyZGlhbi5jb20vYnVzaW5lc3MvMjAxNS9hdWcvMjkvc29mdC1zcG9rZW4tYi1hbmQtdy1vd25lci10dXJucy11cC1zb3VuZC1mb3Itc3BlYWtlci1maXJt?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Joe Atkins has a contacts book that includes George Lucas, the Sultan of Brunei and the senior management teams at Apple and Maserati. For 30 years he has built Bowers & Wilkins (B&W) from a niche British speaker manufacturer into a world-beating consumer audio brand.

But unlike its ubiquitous rectangular headphones or its Zeppelin Air and A7 wireless speakers, the Canadian owner of B&W is a virtual unknown.

“I don’t like to be in the spotlight,” he says in his grizzly bear rasp. “But there’s an opportunity for Bowers to become better-known among a wider group. Until now, we’ve largely been a product company. We need to become better storytellers.”

It is almost 50 years since John Bowers, a communications engineer in the second world war and classical music nut, opened a modest shop selling audio kit in Worthing, West Sussex. Now the company that bears his name is a global electronics brand employing 1,100 people with an annual turnover of £120m.

Atkins, 59, has been invested in the business for 30 years, after first buying B&W’s North American distributor. Bowers died not long after, in 1987, and left the UK operation to his partner Robert Trunz. Nine years later Atkins bought Trunz out, and ever since then he has taken it to greater heights, while retaining its focus on product development.

Britain’s manufacturers are still struggling to shake off the hangover of recession – official figures this month revealed that the manufacturing sector shrank 0.3% in the last quarter and is 4.8% smaller than it was on the eve of the downturn in early 2008. But B&W is a star in Britain’s industrial firmament.

The producer’s high-end speaker systems, which range from £12,000 for its 800 series of floor-standing speakers up to £1m for its Sound System range for music festivals, are still produced by 600 workers in Worthing. These state-of-the-art speakers are designed in nearby Steyning, nicknamed the “university of sound” because this is where B&W does all its research and development.

B&W’s products are sold in every Apple store, can be found in Maserati and Volvo cars, and grace film and music studios such as Abbey Road in London and George Lucas’s Skywalker Sound studios.

So it is hardly surprising that Atkins is committed to the company’s British manufacturing base. “Our workers are highly skilled,” the Canadian says. “Some of them have been with us for more than 30 years. There’s a strong engineering culture in Britain and there’s a strong affinity with music.”

However, he recognises there are advantages to making some of its cheaper consumer products, such as the Zeppelin and its distinctive headphones, in lower-cost countries like China, where it also has a factory.

Atkins is dressed in sombre black jeans and turtleneck sweater and dark jacket. He shrugs, throws his arms open and twiddles his spectacles around in the fingers of his right hand before admitting: “We do source things in the far east. We have lots of products that are made by contract manufacturers.

“About 80% of what we do we make ourselves, including half of that in the UK,” he adds. “We don’t buy off-the-shelf technology and platforms. We have the same group of designers and sound engineers focused on how the 802 speaker sounds and how the Zeppelin sounds. That’s very important.”

It is a balance that has worked well. In the last 15 years, B&W has doubled its turnover. Much of this is credited to its push into mass-market consumer products that complement Apple’s range of iPod and iPhone music players, such as the Zeppelin and its range of headphones. These alone now account for about 35% of annual sales.

However, Atkins, who owns 60% of B&W, recognises he is not getting any younger. His daughter has indicated that she has no interest in taking on the firm. He is clearly preparing to offload the business, having already sold a 40% stake to two private equity investors. Brussels-based Sofina grabbed 20% in 2006 and Caledonia Investments, based in Britain, snapped up the same-sized stake in 2011 for £24m.

Is Atkins looking to sell up to a larger electronics group, or would he rather float the brand on the stock exchange?

“Thirty years is a long time to invest in a brand and there’s a big responsibility that goes with that,” he says. “I’m now thinking, how does a 50-year-old brand become a 75-year-old brand?”

He does not want to sell B&W to a large corporation, preferring to hand it over to a group that understands and nurtures premium product lines. “I think you have to find a way to transition the stake-holding while you are still invested. That point may not be now, but it’s not 20 years from now either,” he says.

“I don’t want someone to take the brand and apply it to something that doesn’t stand up to the B&W name. But, obviously, there are large entities, like LVMH [the French luxury brands conglomerate that owns Louis Vuitton, Christian Dior and Moët Hennessy], that put brands in their portfolio and preserve them. That longer-term progression would be great, and it’s achievable.”

It is easy to see why B&W might attract high-calibre interest. Its precisely engineered, British-made products turn reproducing music into an art form.

The imposing cherry red and walnut 802 floor-standing speakers in B&W’s listening room at its London office have a synthetic diamond tweeter, rather than aluminium. This helps to eliminate all distortion in the range of sound that can be heard by the human ear.

Such attention to detail makes total sense to this listener as the room is submerged in high-definition sound – the burst of syncopation from Keith Moon’s drum kit at the start of The Who’s Young Man Blues is as exhilarating a listening experience as it must have been when the sneering upstarts performed it live in their pomp.

If Atkins manages to snag a big fish like LVMH it will cap a remarkable investment odyssey for a man who only stumbled across B&W by accident.

“I bought it [the North American distributor] as a business investment. It was a relatively small brand at the time,” he recalls. Atkins had built a car leasing and dealership business in Canada and was focused on that. But things changed seven months later, when John Bowers died.

“As a distributor you are only as good as the manufacturer you represent. John Bowers was an entrepreneur and an engineer who was passionate about making the world’s best speaker.

“It was a business based on passion and not a lot of business sense. So there was a void there. America was the biggest market, so I stepped into the void that was the business side of things. So it was very accidental.”

Atkins grew up just outside Toronto, the second child of five. He has three brothers and one sister. His father was a chartered accountant and executive at a “large company”, he says; his mother was a housewife. “She was busy driving us to hockey games.”

Atkins followed in his father’s footsteps and studied accountancy at the University of Toronto before joining Peat Marwick, now part of KPMG, where he became a chartered accountant. He spent five years in the insolvency practice at Peat Marwick before setting up car leasing and car sales dealerships with his brothers, including the country’s first Hyundai dealership.

Atkins sold the car-leasing business after buying the B&W distributor and recently sold the dealership business. He is now 100% focused on B&W. And that includes coming out of his shell and telling the speaker firm’s story, rather than letting rival streaming and speaker brands Sonos and Bose steal all the limelight.

Does he ever worry about competition from such rivals? With a straight face, Atkins shoots back: “Everybody knows Bose. I mean they make clock radios. Great company.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999929666519165}",neutral,0.9999929666519165,0

'I have no plan to stop performing surgery anytime soon'

By Jung Min-ho, Kim Eil-chul



On Feb. 27, 1976, a young man fell on an electric saw at a lumber mill in Seoul. Immediately, he had his left leg severed and blood started gushing from the wound.



His co-workers took him to orthopedic surgeon Yoo Myung-chul, but they thought he would not survive the night.



It took eight hours for Yoo's surgical team to save the young man's life ― and the leg. When Yoo realized that he had successfully performed the first reattachment surgery for an above-knee amputation in Korea, he was only 32 years old.



""Since then, I have been doing this all my life,"" Yoo, now 71, said. ""And I have no plan to stop performing surgery anytime soon.""



In the 1970s and 1980s, Korea's economy was thriving with the rapid development of primary industries. Factories were everywhere, producing goods from shoes to wigs. But there were many tragic accidents.



""At that time, very few doctors were capable of performing surgery to reattach body parts,"" Yoo said. ""So I had many patients from across the country, sometimes all the way from Jeju Island.""





Yoo Myung-chul performs surgery. He was the first orthopedic surgeon in Korea to successfully reattach a severed leg to a patient.



Such operations were unimaginable in the early 1970s in Korea. But for Yoo, it was the very reason he decided to become a doctor.



""Half of my father's left hand was severed because of an accident that occurred while he was working as a railway official,"" he said. ""Looking at his hand was heartbreaking for me. So later I decided to become an orthopedic surgeon, thinking that I would be able to fix his hand someday.""



Yoo was the first Korean doctor in the field of bone reattachment surgery. After endless nights of studying and practicing, he eventually attained the necessary skills, which include connecting the blood vessels.



It was a groundbreaking accomplishment because, by connecting the blood vessels, severed body parts could recover not only their original shape but also function.



From there, Yoo devised more than 20 orthopedic surgical procedures and some were world firsts.



""Each capillary is less than 1 millimeter thick,"" he said. ""When I learned how to connect them, I could cure many injuries. The method enabled me to recover severed body parts fully by allowing blood to run through them.""



Previously, in serious cases, patients had to accept the loss of their limbs. For less serious injuries, doctors only used skin grafts, which meant no recovery of function.



""Thanks to the new surgery, the dreams of many patients became true,"" Yoo said.



Chronic osteomyelitis, an infection and inflammation of the bone or bone marrow, was one disease Yoo treated through surgery.



""Many people suffered excruciating pain because of osteomyelitis,"" he said.



In an innovative method, Yoo removed the entire infected bone marrow and filled the space with parts of the greater omentum (a heavily vascularized covering of the large intestine). Thanks to Yoo, more than 500 patients have had a second chance at life over the past 40 years.



As Yoo became a household name in medicine, he received job offers from major hospitals, including Samsung Medical Center and Asan Medical Center, which both promised him handsome salaries.



However, Yoo stayed at the Kyung Hee University Medical Center. When asked why, he said he just didn't find any reason to change his workplace.



""I thought the place didn't matter because I would do the same thing wherever I would be,"" he said. ""It felt totally unnecessary and meaningless for me to move just for more money.""



Spearheading hospital system change



Yoo also made a great contribution to the nation's medical development by introducing the ""specialty system.""



""Previously, a handful of doctors were in charge of everything in a hospital, covering all diseases,"" he said. ""It was possible because there were not many doctors back then. The system was bureaucratic and authoritative. And there were no specialists.""



During one of many trips to the United States, Yoo realized that nurturing specialists would be necessary for the future of Korean medical science.



""Many high-ranking doctors agreed with my view but were reluctant to adopt the new idea because it meant that they had to share their power,"" he said.



But as soon as Kyung Hee Medical Center adopted the specialty system, many other hospitals followed suit, and soon it spread around the country.



His contribution to Kyung Hee Medical Center as a surgeon, against his will, put him in a director post in 2002.



It was and is still common here for the head of a hospital to leave medicine to focus only on administrative work. But Yoo had a different idea.



""I did not want to end my career as a director,"" he said. ""I was concerned that it would be increasingly difficult to get back as a surgeon if I stopped working as one for a while. I became a doctor to give patients hope, and this will continue to be my goal.""



Since 1986, Yoo has treated 75,000 patients here and in other countries as a volunteer. He said he believes ""respect for life,"" ""love for others"" and ""sharing with others"" are the most important values for doctors.



Another great contribution to the orthopedic field is joint replacement surgery. Yoo has performed about 15,000 hip replacements and is president of the Arthroplasty Society in Asia.



Tissue donation campaign



While working as a surgeon at Chung Hospital in Seongnam after leaving Kyung Hee Medical Center in 2014, Yoo recently raised awareness of the importance of tissue donation.



Human tissue is used in scientific and medical research to improve the understanding of how diseases start and progress, and what keeps people healthy. Researchers may find different ways of diagnosing diseases or developing new treatments and as a result more lives could be saved, Yoo said.



He is also chairman of the Korea Foundation for Human Tissue Donation, an organization under the Ministry of Health and Welfare.



For now, only five people out of 1 million donate tissue in Korea, which is far less than the rate of 133 in the U.S., 59 in Spain and 30 in France.



""The deficiency causes the country great cost and problems in medical care for people who need tissue transplantation,"" Yoo said. ""I hope more people will learn that they can save other people's lives with what they already have.""","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9998928308486938}",neutral,0.9998928308486938,0
What Crystal Jade's Boss Did With His Money Will Make You Salute Him With Respect - Yahoo Singapore News,"Thu, 13 Aug 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHA6Ly9zZy5uZXdzLnlhaG9vLmNvbS9jcnlzdGFsLWphZGUtYm9zcy1kaWQtbW9uZXktMDYwMDI4MjE3Lmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"This article originally appeared on Vulcan Post.

The Crystal Jade group of restaurants have been as commonplace to Singaporeans as the next Ya Kun or 7-Eleven, but there’s so much about it that we don’t know. The restaurant chain serving Chinese cuisine was founded in 1991, but began facing financial troubles in 1992. Ip Yiu Tung, a Hong Kong businessman who eventually became a Singapore PR, decided to invest $2 million in the business, taking a 49% stake in the company and becoming chairman in the process. (Source)

Just last year, it reported an annual revenue of close to $250 million, and was acquired by L Capital Asia, the private equity arm of French luxury goods conglomerate LVMH (Louis Vuitton Moet Hennessy). In an emotional interview with The Straits Times, Ip shared that he had sold all his shares to the company.

This was reported and discussed by popular food blogger Daniel’s Food Diary last year, when the news broke. But just today, he revealed another piece of information about the ex-chairman that will melt your hearts. Posting a screenshot of a Facebook post by the son of a Crystal Jade employee, he shared a single act of kindness and gratitude often unseen in billionaire businessmen.

The rough translation of Daniel’s Food Diary’s post reads as such:

My mother has worked for 10 years with Crystal Jade. Today, she received the message to make a trip down to the Vivocity branch…. Basically, after many years of negotiation, Crystal Jade was finally sold for a hundred US million dollars. But what I did not expect was for Mr Ip to return the money back to the old employees who worked with Crystal Jade throughout the years. It will be sensitive for me to reveal the exact amount as staff gets different sums based on seniority and position. In short, they each received an amount equivalent to several months of bonuses. He did not need to do that. Because no one would expect that, especially after the company has already been acquired. Your former boss returning to give you money and appreciation. Such a businessman, which values relationship with staff, is worthy of our admiration and respect. Really.”

Story continues

That act of gratitude and respect he extended to his employees is touching, more so because employees that have helped a company grow are often forgotten once it has attained success. Many remember the name of the entrepreneur that believed it possible; hardly anyone remembers the men and women in the team who made it so.

In his time as chairman of the Crystal Jade group, Mr. Ip has grown to care for and love his company as a “father”, according to his interview with The Straits Times.

“I actually cried when I announced (the acquisition) to my people on Tuesday,” he said.

Mr. Ip sets an example to many successful Singapore-based entrepreneurs who now are attaining success on the world stage. As Kennedy once said: “As we express our gratitude, we must never forget that the highest appreciation is not to utter words, but to live by them.” I think Mr. Ip understood that.

6 Lessons On Entrepreneurship By Charles Wong From Charles & Keith - Vulcan Post,"Thu, 06 Aug 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vdnVsY2FucG9zdC5jb20vMzMyMjgxLzYtbGVzc29ucy1lbnRyZXByZW5ldXJzaGlwLWNoYXJsZXMta2VpdGgtd29uZy_SAVBodHRwczovL3Z1bGNhbnBvc3QuY29tLzMzMjI4MS82LWxlc3NvbnMtZW50cmVwcmVuZXVyc2hpcC1jaGFybGVzLWtlaXRoLXdvbmcvYW1wLw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"This article originally appeared on Vulcan Post.

If you’re a Singaporean female and you’re familiar with the process of shoe shopping, then you will be familiar with Charles & Keith. What often surprises Singaporeans is that the brand is locally-grown, a venture by true blue Singaporean brothers Charles and Keith Wong.

39-year-old Charles Wong, the Chief Executive Officer of Charles & Keith, first started the business back in 1996, in a small store at Amara Shopping Centre. Since then, the business has grown to hold its own against the big boys with more than 300 stores worldwide. It has also attracted the attention of French luxury giant Louis Vuitton Moet Hennessy (LVMH), who now owns 20% of the company.

Here are some key lessons on entrepreneurship that you can learn from the young business hotshot, Charles Wong.

1. Nothing quite beats natural business acumen

While the general Singaporean mentality regarding success is about having a great education, Charles Wong had a rough start to life. Unlike his younger brother Keith, who went on to be the only university graduate in the family, Charles never studied past his O levels, passing his exams in Maths, History, and Bible Study. Despite this, he eventually started Charles & Keith — which he named after him and his brother — at the young age of 22. Keith joined two years later, after he finished his national service.

Despite not making it far in his studies, Charles and Keith have grown that business from that small store into one worth millions — and they have plans to expand even further. He’s a great example of how entrepreneurship and a natural business acumen can help you make it far in life, as long as you try.

“Think big, and do not be afraid of failure,” he said in an interview. “Even if you do not succeed in your first attempt.”

2. It pays to learn about your parents’ trade

Before Charles & Keith became a reality, Charles and Keith Wong helped out at their mother’s shoe store at Ang Mo Kio. It was through this experience that Charles learnt what it took to make a successful shoe business, and was eventually inspired to open his own.

While their mother wanted Charles to close the shoe section that had become unprofitable, he was determined to make things work. After taking over the shoe business operations, he managed to turn things around, saving the shoe business while honing his business acumen from a young age. (Source: IE Singapore)

This experience eventually gave him the skills he needed to open his own shoe store.

3. Find your edge — and be awesome at it

Running a shoe business can be likened to being a single drop of water in the ocean — there aren’t many ways to stand out. Unsettled by the mediocre performance of his business, Charles realised that he had to find a way to differentiate himself from his numerous competitors.

After speaking to his customers, he discovered that selling shoes bought from wholesale suppliers just didn’t provide a wide enough variety for their customers. In order for the business to survive, things had to change.

“Many times customers gave me feedback on the designs they wanted and I’d feed the comments to my suppliers,” he said to Forbes. “But they were not able to deliver the designs that our customers wanted. Also, the prices they were offering were not competitive enough.”

This prompted their decision to begin designing their own shoes by the end of 1997. Within three years, all their shoes were designed in-house, and that was a large selling point that set Charles & Keith apart from the rest. Today, the Charles & Keith design team of 70 creates more than a thousand new shoe and accessory designs annually for the brand, and a shoe or accessory design a day for Pedro. (Source: Forbes)

4. Someone else’s problem could be your opportunity

While most of Singapore suffered in the Asian Economic crisis in 1997, Charles took the opportunity to move his business in a new direction.

“We saw the opportunity to work directly with some factories to gain further control over the design and production process. We created designs based on the feedback customers gave us and we realised only by understanding what they want, can we introduce exciting products every season.” (Source: LuxuryInsider)

Despite the gloomy economic state that Singapore was in, Charles & Keith were not discouraged, and took the opportunity to grow. With their new direction, they garnered the attention of the female demographic with their fresh, fashion-forward designs and affordable prices — an attractive package in a recession.

“[Women] buy shoes every month — recession or not,” said Song Seng Wun, an economist and head of research at CIMB-GK Securities, to Forbes. “[There’s] still some degree of purchasing power; [the company] will continue to attract women consumers.”

5. Be your own biggest competitor

What many people don’t realise is that Charles and Keith also own popular shoe store Pedro. While the store began as a male alternative to Charles & Keith’s female-centric business, Pedro eventually expanded and moved into selling female designs as well. This placed Pedro in direct competition with Charles & Keith’s, with stores often located near each other.

While both brands are segregated (“[Pedro] caters to people with a taste for lavishness”), each business has been able to gain traction in the local market successfully. It’s the best way to continuously challenge yourself, while growing the business as a whole.

More variety for us, more business for them.

6. If you don’t move forward, you’ll move back

Being an entrepreneur in the fashion space, Charles knows full well how quickly things change in the industry. That’s why the team behind the brand hardly stops moving. Charles, a bachelor based in both Singapore and Shanghai, often spends his time flying between the two cities to manage the company’s business development. The designers, based in China, make regular trips to Europe and the US to attend fashion shows and conduct market research, with the company spending 3% of their revenue training designers.

“The fashion industry is fast paced and filled with challenges; therefore adaptability plays an important role today. Not only is it crucial to adapt to rapid change, the ability to solve problems and make the right decisions is needed to continually improve and reinvent ourselves while striving for excellence every step of the way.” (Source: HeadHunt.com.sg)","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9996225833892822}",neutral,0.9996225833892822,0

Mr Ip, who sold his share of the company in May last year as part of an estimated US$100 million (S$140 million) buyout, is in Singapore this week visiting various Crystal Jade restaurants to hand out cheques to the employees.

Madam Ong Ah Kwee was one of those asked to gather at Crystal Jade Kitchen in VivoCity on Wednesday afternoon to collect her payout. ""I was very reluctant to go as it was very far from my house,"" said the 61-year-old part-time waitress at Crystal Jade Kitchen in Tampines Mall.

""My friends told me that they had read reports in Hong Kong that Mr Ip will share the profits of the sale with the employees, but I didn't quite believe them. I never thought it would really happen,"" said Madam Ong in Mandarin.

An employee since 1996, Madam Ong has mostly been a part-timer, working four hours a day. She was pleasantly surprised to get a sum roughly three times her pay, directly from Mr Ip.

Former employees have also not been forgotten.

Madam Annie Chiew, 49, had been a cashier at Crystal Jade for 15 years until her resignation last month. She received about two months' worth of her last-drawn salary for her past contributions.

""I'm very thankful to Mr Ip. Though I didn't have a chance to talk to him, he was all smiles when he handed me the cheque and even reminded me to check if everything was correct,"" she said.

About 90 per cent of the Crystal Jade Group was bought by L Capital Asia, the private equity arm of Paris-based luxury group LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton, for an estimated US$100 million.

Mr Ip, a 66-year-old Hong Konger who is a Singapore permanent resident, stayed on as chief executive for a year and now remains an adviser and brand ambassador for the company, which comprises 120 restaurants worldwide, including 47 here, and about 4,500 full- time staff.​","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9998846054077148}",neutral,0.9998846054077148,0

Model, actress and businesswoman Megan Gale, 40, has a big decision to make about the future of her swimwear label after her partner in the business, Seafolly, decided to discontinue the collaboration.

Gale’s label, Isola, is sold in 100 stores nationally and made $4 million in sales this financial year.

So why is Seafolly ditching Isola?

According to the Financial Review, Seafolly, which was an Australian family-run company, sold a 70 per cent stake to the luxury conglomerate LVMH last year for $70 million.

LVMH execs have decided that Seafolly’s future is as a worldwide lifestyle brand, and that Isola won’t be able to achieve global reach, partly due to trouble the company has had trademarking the Isola name in the US.

“It is unusual for there to be such a big change within a brand when it is having great success season on season,” Gale told The Australian Financial Review.

“Normally the case is the product is not selling, or stockists don’t want it any more. It’s very rare for it to be flourishing yet still be wound down… It’s a shame to lose momentum, but the smart thing to do is rest the brand for at least a season to think about the best direction.”
