Louis Vuitton Strikes Again: Shuts Down Art Exhibit That Commented On LV Trademarks - Techdirt,"Tue, 29 Jun 2010 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRlY2hkaXJ0LmNvbS8yMDEwLzA2LzI5L2xvdWlzLXZ1aXR0b24tc3RyaWtlcy1hZ2Fpbi1zaHV0cy1kb3duLWFydC1leGhpYml0LXRoYXQtY29tbWVudGVkLW9uLWx2LXRyYWRlbWFya3Mv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Louis Vuitton Strikes Again: Shuts Down Art Exhibit That Commented On LV Trademarks

from the parody? dept

Earlier this year, you may recall that we wrote about a bizarre and ridiculous lawsuit that luxury goods retailer Louis Vuitton had filed against Hyundai, because for a couple of seconds in a Hyundai commercial, a basketball is seen with markings that sorta kinda mimic (though, not exactly) LV’s handbag design. This is the same Louis Vuitton that had sued a fundraiser who had made t-shirts to raise money for Darfur, which included an illustration of a “pimped out” Darfur victim who was holding a bag that also mimicked LV’s designs.

I was reminded of both of these cases recently when I was catching up on recent episodes of the TV show Mythbusters. In one episode, the myth being tested is whether or not you can build a cannon out of leather. In the final attempt, Mythbuster Kari Byron decides to “decorate” the cannon, and does so with symbols that, again, mimic the LV design, turning it into a “designer cannon.” Unfortunately, it looks like Discovery doesn’t let you embed clips (why, Discovery, why?), but here’s a quick screen shot that I took:

All I could think of was whether or not (a) Mythbusters/Discovery had cleared that and gotten a license from LVMH or (b) if LVMH was going to sue. I have no idea if anything has happened there, but you can rest assured that LVMH is busy on the legal front elsewhere.

ChurchHatesTucker points us to the news that LVMH has shut down an art exhibit in Japan that involved sculptures of nine locusts, that were each made from counterfeit Louis Vuitton bags:

a play on the words batta (“locust”) and battamon (slang for “knockoff”). According to the artist, the works are meant to raise questions about the relationship between authenticity and imitation in a consumer-driven society.

The sculptures were clearly meant to act as commentary on the nature of luxury brands and counterfeiting, as they were named Batta Mon, which the article linked above says is:

It seems like that’s a perfectly good subject for commentary through art, and it seems ridiculous that LVMH is stifling the artist’s work. Nothing in this exhibit is going to make anyone think that it was endorsed by LVMH. It certainly isn’t doing anything to create consumer confusion. The artist is pissed off, but the museum said it didn’t want to deal with a legal fight, so this artist’s work gets taken down as yet another company abuses trademark law. Watch out, Mythbusters, you may be next…

Moët & Chandon begins online rethink - Campaign US,"Wed, 02 Jun 2010 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNhbXBhaWdubGl2ZS5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS9tb2V0LWNoYW5kb24tYmVnaW5zLW9ubGluZS1yZXRoaW5rLzEwMDcxNzDSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"As part of the re-evaluation, the brand has called a review of its global digital agency arrangements and has approached agencies with a brief. Moet & Chandon's ad account is handled by Mother.

Although the UK remains the biggest export market for Champagne, British consumption of the drink has declined over the past two years. In 2009, Moet & Chandon's UK sales fell 9.6%, according to Mintel.

Last year, Moet agreed its first TV sponsorship deal with Sky for coverage of the Oscars and Golden Globes awards ceremonies. At the brand's ‘Tribute to Cinema' gala last year, it revealed actress Scarlet Johansson would be its first celebrity brand ambassador.

LVMH was unavailable for comment as Marketing went to press."
Moet & Chandon launch global digital review | News - Campaign Asia,"Thu, 03 Jun 2010 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNhbXBhaWduYXNpYS5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS9tb2V0LWNoYW5kb24tbGF1bmNoLWdsb2JhbC1kaWdpdGFsLXJldmlldy8yMTM5MTnSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"According to an article on Brand Republic, the review comes as LVMH seeks to boost its Champagne sales after the recession. British consumption of the premium Champagne brand fell by 9.6 per cent in 2009.



As part of the re-evaluation, the brand has called a review of its global digital agency arrangements and has approached agencies with a brief. The review's remit includes creative and CRM duties.



According to Angela Lam, regional marketing and research manager at Moët Hennessy Asia-Pacific, the review, driven by LVMH's central marketing operation in Paris, includes Asia where Moët & Chandon currently does not have a strong digital presence.



The incumbent global agency is Mother Advertising based in London. Lam confirmed that LVMH is looking for an agency with a presence in Asia to drive Moët's online presence in the region.



LVMH works with ZenithOptimedia as their offline agency-of-record in Asia and on a project basis for digital activities. Lam added that the review may include media duties at a later stage but it has not been confirmed.



Up to now, Moët & Chandon's activities in Asia has been mostly PR driven.



Moët & Chandon launched a global print campaign, including Asia, featuring Scarlett Johansson last year.



LVMH Moët Hennessy is a world leader in luxury and own over 60 brands in the sector. The group's international retail network include over 2,400 stores worldwide and more than 70,000 employees."
