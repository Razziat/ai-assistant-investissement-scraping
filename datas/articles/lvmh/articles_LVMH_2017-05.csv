LVMH Confirms Launch of Multi-Brand Fashion Site - The Business of Fashion,"Wed, 10 May 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzb2ZmYXNoaW9uLmNvbS9uZXdzL2x1eHVyeS9sdm1oLWNvbmZpcm1zLWxhdW5jaC1vZi1tdWx0aXBsZS1icmFuZC13ZWJzaXRlL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS, France — LVMH is launching a multi-brand e-commerce website inspired by its exclusive Parisian department store Le Bon Marche, as the world's biggest luxury goods group steps up the digital side of its business.

The new website, named ""24 Sevres"" after the Rue de Sevres location of Le Bon Marche in the chic 7th arrondissement, will offer fashion, cosmetics and luggage products from LVMH's own portfolio as well as brands from outside the group.

Overall more than 150 labels, including 20 of LVMH's own stable such as Louis Vuitton, Dior, or Fendi, will be featured.

The size of the investment amounted to several million euros and marks the biggest digital initiative taken by LVMH since it hired former Apple music executive Ian Rogers in 2015 to craft its digital strategy and capitalise on the luxury sector's online sales expansion.

LVMH, controlled by French billionaire Bernard Arnault, said the new site would go live on June 6 in more than 70 countries.

Competing with established rivals such as Yoox Net-a-Porter , MyTheresa, Matchesfashion.com or LuisaViaRoma, it echoes the high-end positioning of the Le Bon Marche store.

It will give international clients ""very Parisian choices"" in the selection of exclusive products, Rogers told Reuters.

""The idea is to be attractive with unique products, not necessarily have a huge offering,"" said Rogers.

E-commerce is still a relatively small part of the global luxury goods market, representing 7 percent of industry sales, but this is expected to rise to 12 percent of industry sales by 2020, according to the Boston Consulting Group.

Luxury goods companies face a dilemma over trying to reach young Internet-savvy shoppers while preserving the sense of exclusivity that drives up the value of their products.

LVMH has already tapped into the increasing importance of online social media by setting up LVMH Luxury Ventures to invest in start-up luxury goods projects.

Until now each LVMH brand has had its own separate digital strategy, with some brands such as Fendi and Kenzo putting significant resources into this area while other brands such as Celine had no E-commerce website of their own.

The new website will complement the offering available on the respective websites of the LVMH brands, Rogers said.

Big fashion brands such as Prada, Gucci or Valentino will be sold on the site as well as Maison Margiela, seen as a more cutting-edge label, or others such as Kitsune or APC.

LVMH's online sales of €2 billion ($2.2 billion) last year equated to 5.3 percent of overall group revenues.

Why Tori Burch turned down a promotion to president of LVMH - CNBC,"Fri, 12 May 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tLzIwMTcvMDUvMTIvdGhpcy1leGVjLXBhc3NlZC11cC10aGUtYmVpbmctcHJlc2lkZW50LW9mLXRoaXMtMTI3LWJpbGxpb24tY29tcGFueS5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Tory Burch is a fashion icon who sits at the helm of her namesake fashion brand that in 2016 did more than $1 billion in sales. She's ambitious, and proud to be. But in the course of her career, she's also passed on tremendous professional opportunity. In 2001, she got the job offer of a lifetime: President a LVMH Group, the influential Paris fashion house that owns luxury brands including Louis Vuitton, Christian Dior, Fendi, Dom Pérignon and Veuve Clicquot, among many others.

But Burch — who had worked her way up the fashion corporate ladder, holding positions Ralph Lauren, Vera Wang and Narciso Rodriguez at Loewe — had two small sons at home and was pregnant with her third. She was faced with the prospect of raising three young kids and being at the helm of one of the largest fashion companies in the world. ""[I] realized I just wouldn't be able to do both well,"" says Burch, speaking recently at the Vanity Fair Founders Fair in New York City. She turned down promotion to focus on raising her young children.

Though it was the right decision for Burch, she didn't take it lightly. ""It was very hard to leave a career that I really loved,"" she says. Indeed, LVMH is a leader in the fashion world. Today, LVMH's market cap is north of $127 billion and the company did more than $40 billion in revenue in 2016. (When Burch was offered the position of President, LVMH was not quite as big as is today, but the conglomerate, first established in 1987, has long been a behemoth.)

Ambition can mean being a stay-at-home mom. It's not necessarily about work. It's about having the confidence to live your life the way you choose to. Tory Burch CEO Tory Burch

In the end, Burch couldn't stay away from the business for long. She launched Tory Burch in 2004 with a retail shop on Elizabeth Street in New York City with her now ex-husband, Chris Burch. She wanted to fill what she perceived to be a wide and vacant chasm in the fashion industry between haute couture and Gap. Today Tory Burch has more than 200 retail storefronts around the world and the brand is sold at more than 3,000 department stores and boutiques in addition to online."

According to The New York Times, 24 Sèvres, a boutique shopping website and mobile app named after the Paris street that Le Bon Marché is on, goes live in under a month. It is a project that Ian Rogers, the company’s chief digital officer, has been working on since his arrival 18 months ago.

“We believe we are on the cusp of revealing something very exciting,” he said.

And while some of the fashion industry’s power players have mixed reactions to another contender coming into a crowded sector (Yoox Net-a-Porter, FarFetch and MatchesFashion.com are already competing for the world’s wealthiest consumers), there’s no doubt LVMH’s entry can be a game changer.

The conglomerate owns 70 luxury brands, including Christian Dior, Louis Vuitton, Bulgari, Fendi and Givenchy. And while LVMH had previously faltered in the multibrand luxury space after its website eLuxury closed in 2009, Rogers believes the timing is right. He explained that LVMH had considered every branding possibility for 24 Sèvres, which will initially stock only woman’s wear, but settled on maintaining a connection to Le Bon Marché because of its 160-year history as a pioneer in catalog sales.

24 Sèvres has some similarities with its more established rivals, including fast delivery times to an array of international locations; chatbots or stylists-on-demand; glossy packaging, complete with Eiffel Tower cutout pop-ups and love notes from Paris; and an efficient checkout process. 24 Sèvres is also the name of the current loyalty program run by the department store, with legions of existing members.

Of the 150 brands initially on 24 Sèvres, only around 20 to 30 will be LVMH-owned (that will include Louis Vuitton and Dior, neither of which are available via any other multibrand online boutique). For non-LVMH labels, inventory with either be acquired wholesale or controlled by those brands that operate their own shop-in-shop style retail channel, the same model operated by the store.

“Don’t think of this as the LVMH eCommerce project; think of this as us taking Le Bon Marché international via the internet,” Rogers said."

“We have a lot of work to do,” said Toni Belloni, LVMH group managing director, on Thursday evening during a panel discussion at CSM regarding the partnership.

“The idea is not to be static. Innovation is the engine of our growth. Sustainability has become a common concern to society in the last 20 years. It’s important to all of us. For students, they want to work for companies that design a better future for the world,” he continued.

“Our customers don’t just want a great product or a striking experience, they are starting to be much more interested in what’s behind the brands, the values and behavior,” said the executive. “We are very open to ideas. We are very pragmatic. Together, we can push the envelope of innovation on this subject.”

As reported, the initiative is intended to foster sustainable practices in education, research and business protocol. The partners are calling their new alliance “Double Vision: Innovation, Sustainability, Luxury,” and are aiming to build more sustainable methods and approaches by enhancing the curricula at CSM.

To mark the launch, the school hosted a panel discussion at the LVMH Lecture Theatre at CSM’s Granary Square campus in London. Earlier on Thursday, the company held a series of career sessions for students during which members of the creative, business and human resources teams from 14 brands, including Louis Vuitton, Christian Dior, J.W. Anderson and Nicholas Kirkwood, were present.

In addition to Belloni, panelists at the evening session included Chantal Gaemperle, LVMH group executive vice president, human resources and synergies; professor Jeremy Till, head of Central Saint Martins, pro vice-chancellor of the University of the Arts London; Anne Smith, dean of academic programs, and Carole Collet, the new CSM LVMH director of sustainable innovation.

The school plans to host a series of sustainability-driven projects, workshops and events with one or two conferences to be held annually. In addition, CSM will offer its research facilities to LVMH, and the luxury group will work with CSM students or graduates on various consultancy projects.

Belloni said that for LVMH, business is about quality craftsmanship. “The brands are expressions of culture and preservation of artisanal craft and know-how. It’s about the preservation of rare, raw materials. Our products are made to last. They are made more long-life and long-usage and in some cases for repair. They are built for quality that lasts,” he explained.

Gaemperle said innovation and sustainability are key for the group — and the next generation. “We want to create dreams,” said Gaemperle. “We want to nurture desire, making sure that what was founded many, many years ago [stays] relevant and still inspirational. It’s important to be outward-looking.”

She added: “Responsible practices must guide us on how we conduct business. There are many new territories to explore. The idea is that we work together to make the impossible possible for the future. We have set a number of important goals in the area of sustainability by 2020.”

CSM’s Smith promised that the partners would “think outside the box and come up with new proposals and solutions. The potential to be thought leaders for innovative sustainable solutions — particularly from a luxury standpoint to lead the way — is an exciting prospect. None of us have all the answers yet, but I am confident that we will come up with those answers.”

LVMH has partnered with CSM in the past on various projects, such as design forums, sponsored student projects and scholarships."

In a “simplified mixed offer for all Christian Dior shares not currently held by the Arnault Family Group” in line with an offer made last month. In a filing with L’Autorité des marchés financiers, the French stock market regulator in France, on May 22, Semyrhamis put forth its plan to combine the Christian Dior fashion brand with his LVMH luxury goods empire in accordance with 12 billion euro ($13 billion) move to simplify his business interests – a restructuring long demanded by other investors.

This filing follows the execution of a syndicated facilities agreement for the purpose of proceeding with the offer. According to a statement from Semyrhamis, “Based on the independent expert’s conclusions which confirm that the offer is fair and further to the release of the favourable opinion of the ad hoc committee composed of independent directors, the Board of directors of Christian Dior, held on May 22nd, 2017, has unanimously recommended that Christian Dior shareholders tender their shares to the offer. In addition, Christian Dior Couture’s works council (Comité d’entreprise) has released a favorable opinion on the proposed disposal of Christian Dior Couture to LVMH.”

Still yet, a spokesman for Semyrhamis stated, “Therefore and after having reviewed the respective independent experts’ conclusions which confirm the fairness of the transaction’s price and further to the release of the respective ad hoc committees’ favorable opinion, the Board of directors of LVMH and Christian Dior have unanimously approved the execution of the definitive acquisition agreement through which Christian Dior Couture will be acquired by LVMH at an enterprise value of 6.5 billion euro.”

The move will fully add Christian Dior to the umbrella of LVMH brands, which include Louis Vuitton, Givenchy, Celine, Loewe, Marc Jacobs, Pucci, and Berluti, among others."
"Inside 24 Sèvres, LVMH's New Multi-Brand E-Commerce Play - The Business of Fashion","Wed, 17 May 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzb2ZmYXNoaW9uLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy90ZWNobm9sb2d5L2luc2lkZS0yNC1zZXZyZXMtbHZtaHMtbmV3LW11bHRpLWJyYW5kLWUtY29tbWVyY2UtcGxheS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS, France — Since he joined LVMH as chief digital officer nearly two years ago, Ian Rogers has been quietly working away on the debut of the group's long-awaited return to multi-brand fashion e-commerce, eight years after the demise of San Francisco-based eLuxury, which closed in 2009.

The new venture — launched under the umbrella of LVMH-owned department store Le Bon Marché and dubbed 24 Sèvres, a reference to the store's Paris address — is set to debut in June, at a time when luxury e-commerce is growing fast. In the next 10 years, global consulting firm McKinsey & Company expects the share of luxury sales occurring online to triple, making e-commerce the world's third largest luxury market after China and the US.

But 24 Sèvres also faces a fashion e-commerce space that is increasingly crowded with competitors, from luxury incumbents like Neiman Marcus to traditional e-tailers like Yoox Net-a-Porter to platform players like Farfetch. And LVMH, the world’s largest luxury group, has an uneven track record online. While the company’s multi-brand beauty retailer Sephora generates strong online sales, Céline still lacks any kind of e-commerce presence at all.

Here, Rogers speaks to BoF’s Imran Amed about LVMH’s return to multi-brand fashion e-commerce, the thinking behind the launch of 24 Sèvres and how the move fits into LVMH’s broader digital strategy.

BoF: You arrived at LVMH somewhat under a cloak of secrecy. Was this multi-brand site one of the key things you were brought on to do?

IR: Yes, it was something that was part of the initial remit. And again, only part [of it]. At the time, [24 Sèvres’s chief executive] Eric Goguey was the only employee. As we were talking about this chief digital officer role they said, ""We have this project, it has one employee, and we’d like for you to help us do it because it is start-up."" Given my experience building start-ups — technology start-ups — and technology teams, I was excited to do it.

But 24 Sèvres isn’t the sole e-commerce strategy of LVMH either. Our goal is to have an e-commerce strategy that is from brand direct to consumer, in the boutiques phase with 24 Sèvres, and multi-brand with Sephora and DFS. Also, we have to have a marketplace strategy, whether it’s T-Mall or Farfetch. And then affiliates play a big role as well, whether it’s Google Shopping or a blog. As a brand, you have to have one strategy that really takes advantage of all of those ways the customer shops.

BoF: What’s it like building a technology start-up in Paris, a city not particularly well-known as a technology hub?

IR: You know it’s hard. This is my eighth start-up and it’s really top notch — and it’s in Paris! I’m really proud of the fact that we didn’t hire an agency, we didn’t hire some third-party technology, we’re not using Demandware, we’re not using Magento — we built it the way that I would build it if we were sitting in a Silicon Valley building, with a great Paris team. There are such good engineers in Paris but they all want to move to the US because that’s where the exciting projects are. So as it turns out, when you bring an exciting project to Paris, you actually have a really good opportunity to hire from a pretty good talent pool.

BoF: I was puzzled by the decision to call the new business ""24 Sèvres"" because that means building a new brand, whereas Le Bon Marché is already a globally recognised brand. Why start from scratch?

IR: We were looking for something that was distinct worldwide that is linked to Le Bon Marché. I like that it has 24 in it because we’re bringing Le Bon Marché, which is open roughly 12 hours a day, but now open to the world for 24 hours a day. It’s French. It’s already the name of our loyalty programme. It’s something that is distinct and something that we can really own worldwide. I like this idea of taking the physical address of Le Bon Marché and making it an international address. And, practically, it’s a marque we can own.

BoF: The luxury e-commerce space is already really competitive with long-established players like Farfetch, Net-a-Porter, Neiman Marcus and MatchesFashion.com. What is it that is going to differentiate 24 Sèvres in the space? What will give it an edge?

Following the market numbers is really interesting and exciting. Obviously it’s a big market; I think it was the Bain [& Company] study this year that said that luxury e-commerce is the third [biggest] market if you were to size it up among geographical markets, behind the US and Japan, at $19 billion. The McKinsey study a couple of years ago said that it’d be trending to $70 billion. So, if you look, ""Where is the double-digit growth? Where is the 30 percent plus growth?"" — it’s in the e-commerce channel.

When you see what’s happening in China, your jaw is on the floor. China has twice as many internet users as the US has people. They did $80 billion in one single day on Alibaba last year, which is effectively two LVMHs in a single day. Obviously Alibaba isn’t luxury, but when you look at customer habits, the Chinese are such an important customer for luxury; you look at their level of comfort in buying e-commerce, and you can definitely see that e-commerce is the future engine of the business because it’s the most accessible form of commerce.

Now to answer your question about what's the differentiator for 24 Sèvres. There are three things.

The first is selection. The value we can offer internationally is that Paris is unrepresented in the fashion e-commerce landscape right now. With everyone you just mentioned — in London and New York and Italy — but Paris is [also] an important take on fashion. It has an important sense of style. It’s about bringing that to the world as people are looking for curators and looking for style and taste, that selection is important. [We will also have] brands that no one else has like Vuitton and Dior, and products too. And that’s really what you’ll see when we launch. Of the 150 plus brands that we have, we’ve had almost 70 of them create exclusive products for our launch. That’s the first differentiator.

The value we can offer internationally is that Paris is unrepresented in the fashion e-commerce landscape right now.

The second thing is merchandising. The internet has moved on to become a visual medium. What are people consuming on the internet? They’re consuming images and videos, and the growth of that when you look at the numbers is exponential, even just over the last three years. Instagram, Facebook, Snapchat: what people are consuming everyday is visual.

We looked at what LVMH is good at, talking to Faye McLeod about what she does with the studio for Vuitton and Dior and visual merchandising as an art form. How can we bring that online? We’re trying to take this kind of art of visual merchandising and I think people dream and desire with windows. I think this is what a boutique needs to do. Why do people come to a boutique? To find something you didn’t know you wanted. You want to see what’s new, what’s hot. You want to see something beautiful. If you knew exactly what you wanted, you might go to a marketplace or brand site or Google. But you come to a boutique to be inspired.

The third part is service. Service is something everybody is competing on. Obviously everybody wants to get to the product faster. It’s hard to bring Le Bon Marché to your home, but we’ve really done our best to make it something special when you order. We’re doing overnight delivery to more than 70 countries on day one, and then we’re trying to innovate as well with our video chat stylists.

I love the notion that 20 years ago it would have seemed absurd that you could sit in Chicago and chat with a Parisian stylist, if that fit is your style and that’s the kind of advice you’d like to get. It’s not just video chat like with FaceTime, it’s actually in the app. You can browse the app while you’re talking to the stylist. They can point to products on the screen, highlight areas, and say, ""Check this out, let me draw a red circle around this brand for you, what do you think about this?""

It’s not just how fast can you get the product; it’s the kind of service that you get when you walk into one of our retail stores. If e-commerce or digital is successful, it’s not just about moving money from the offline pocket to the online pocket, you’re actually reaching people who you couldn’t reach before and connecting with them in a deeper way and a more long-term way. Building a relationship with them that’s a relationship of trust. Luxury has the ability to do that.

BoF: One thing you didn’t mention just now was the role of the physical store. If you think about Le Bon Marché, and you think about the network of Vuitton or Dior stores, to what extent will this be an omnichannel play? How does the store fit into the experience that 24 Sèvres is offering?

IR: The future is very clear. We go to a store to get something we can’t get online, and when you look at the future of retail, Le Bon Marché checks all the boxes. It’s experiential, you can go there and get a meal or a coffee, you can buy a vinyl or see art. During the holidays I took my daughter there to see acrobats. It delivers something that you absolutely cannot get with e-commerce, which is what I think retail — physical retail — needs to try and do in the future.

The big differentiators are, again, selection, merchandising and service. Le Bon Marché is just one store in one city. We do want to super-serve that Parisian customer. Le Bon Marché is a very successful business endeavour. It’s an institution. Leveraging that for the Parisian customer is something we want to do. It’s tied to the 24 Sèvres loyalty programme, which is incredibly successful, and we do have click-and-collect which has a really prominent area on the first floor.

For the Parisian customer, making 24 Sèvres the omnichannel tool for Le Bon Marché is really key. We’ll keep it tied to Le Bon Marché and 24 Sèvres. You mentioned Vuitton and Dior, they will have their own direct-to-consumer omnichannel play. It’s not necessarily tied to 24 Sèvres.

BoF: Some other LVMH brands — Louis Vuitton, Céline and Dior in particular — have been much more restricted in terms of their e-commerce presence. They’re very protective of their brands. How will you maintain their brand integrity in this multi-brand environment which they’ve been resisting up until now?

IR: All three of those brands are being really aggressive in terms of what they’re doing online. The things you can say about all three: Vuitton’s business is fantastic and growing. They have a great team and they’re constantly expanding. Dior has been doing the same. They’ve added more countries since I’ve joined the group and they’re doing some really aggressive things, particularly in Asia. If you look at what they did on WeChat last year, it was incredibly successful.

The only thing we’ve said about Céline so far is that they will do e-commerce this year. Obviously that’s a huge step. They started with an Instagram account and they’re starting to appear there.

We looked at visual merchandising as an art form. How can we bring that online?

So how do you protect these brands in the multi-brand environment? It’s close to what they already do in store. You walk into Le Bon Marché or Bloomingdales, you have Vuitton and Dior, but they are merchandised by Vuitton and Dior. They’re a shop within a shop. Vuitton in Le Bon Marché is not the same selection as Vuitton on the Champs Elysées. But it’s appropriate for the Le Bon Marché customer. What we will do with 24 Sèvres is exactly that.

Since a boutique has an edit, by definition our goal is not to take everything that’s on Louisvuitton.com and put it on this other site. It’s pointless to do that. It’s more about what’s the right edit for this customer? How do we contextualise it so that the customer who just came to be inspired can be inspired by Vuitton or Dior, and that those products aren’t left out of their consideration set when they’re thinking about their next purchase?

In a lot of ways, the multi-brand opportunity is almost a media opportunity. It’s not just about a bunch of products in a grid and the lowest price. It’s about getting people to see something that they wouldn't have seen otherwise and to look at it from a different angle, to look at it in the context of a style. I think the opportunity to do that with these other brands that are at an arm's length from e-commerce is really exciting. It opens up a new realm of possibilities for both the multi-brand site and the brand.

BoF: To be able to deliver overnight delivery in more than 70 countries on the day of launch is no small undertaking. How have you managed to do that so quickly? Has it been through leveraging the existing LVMH infrastructure? Have you built it from scratch?

IR: It’s relatively modest. Even though we’re shipping worldwide, we’re shipping from France. Software comes into it, [so that] we get the pricing right in every country and that we get the tariffs right in every country. So it’s the software infrastructure where we’ve focused for starters, which is also where Farfetch is focused as well, finding software solutions for those problems.

The end infrastructure challenge is huge because when you think about the ordering process, the shooting, getting the product on the site and getting it merchandised, to shipping and returns, very few people appreciate the difficulty of that task. That’s where the companies you mentioned previously have done so well. What they’ve built is very defensible because they solved a lot of very hard problems in the process.

For somebody as big as LVMH, it’s certainly a skill that we have to have. We do have it — obviously we have massive logistics networks that are geared to do different things, but bringing those to accomplish this task is work. But it’s work that has to be done. Like I said earlier, e-commerce is going to become the base level, most accessible form of retail for us. It’s got to be a key skill. You just have to be good at it and do the work to be excellent at serving that market.

The multi-brand opportunity is a media opportunity. It's about getting people to see something that they wouldn't have seen otherwise.

BoF: You’ve come from the music industry, with all this experience in technology. What’s going to be the biggest challenge in making 24 Sèvres a success?

IR: For this specific opportunity, what you’re really trying to do is to succeed as a boutique and half of that is going to be just bringing an audience to the boutique week after week, month after month. It’s no different that the same challenge at Le Bon Marché . You bring people to the store day after day, week after week because you have something really distinct. The challenge is just in really having something that is truly distinct in the market that the customer wants to come to [regularly]. In that way, it becomes a content challenge. You have to have the product, but you also have to merchandise the product in a way that brings people back because you’re an indispensable part of their life. I think that’s the biggest challenge.

BoF: Finally, why has it taken LVMH so long to go after this opportunity?

In terms of why LVMH hasn’t gone there sooner, I think the answer is that they did, and it was tough. ""Once bitten, twice shy"" really applies here, and they wanted to be sure that if they re-entered this race, that they did it in the right way. Alexandre [Arnault] was really key to that and said, ""Listen, I think I know what this looks like, I think I know how we need to do this."" I think that having his vision there allowed the group to make this leap again.

Disclosure: LVMH is part of a group of investors who, together, hold a minority interest in The Business of Fashion. All investors have signed shareholder’s documentation guaranteeing BoF’s complete editorial independence.

French Luxury Group LVMH to Launch New e-Commerce Platform - The Fashion Law,"Wed, 10 May 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWZhc2hpb25sYXcuY29tL2ZyZW5jaC1sdXh1cnktZ3JvdXAtbHZtaC10by1sYXVuY2gtbmV3LWUtY29tbWVyY2UtcGxhdGZvcm0v0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Luxury goods group LVMH is set to launch a new digital platform to host all of its brands, as the French company steps up efforts to capitalize on the luxury and fashion sectors’ online sales boom. Following reports in March, the conglomerate has confirmed the new site, which will be operated in connection with its Paris-based department store, Le Bon Marche. The site will feature more than 150 luxury labels when it opens in June.

24 Sèvres, after the address of the storied Left Bank department store, the e-commerce site will ship from France to more than 75 countries, and according to Bloomberg, “its initial focus will be on womenswear and 68 brands will contribute exclusive products for the launch.”

The internet has become the industry’s most important growth engine, with analysts expecting online transactions to represent 20 percent of all luxury sales within a decade, up from 7-8 percent now, per Reuters, and LVMH cannot afford to miss out. The Paris-based group’s online sales of 2 billion euros ($2.1 billion) last year equated to 5.3 percent of group revenue, with only select companies under its umbrella offering goods online. Paris-based Celine, for instance, has shunned e-commerce entirely to date.

“This platform should boost the visibility of the various LVMH brands,” which include Louis Vuitton, Celine, Loewe, Marc Jacobs, Givenchy, and Pucci, among others, sources said in March, adding that the site will also promote luxury goods brands that fall outside of the LVMH umbrella.

Leading the initiative is former Apple executive Ian Rogers, who was brought on board in 2015 to spearhead digital strategy for the conglomerate. It is LVMH’s first major e-commerce project since Rogers’ appointment and also its first foray back into the digital space since it discontinued sales on ELuxury.com – a multi-brand e-commerce platform – it launched in 2000. That venture, which lasted until 2009 before being shuttered, was, according to Bloomberg, “an early pioneer of luxury e-commerce, but fizzled as brands pulled out in favor of selling through their own online flagships.”

Incorporating features like “video chats with Parisian stylists,” the new site represents a careful selection from a broad range of luxury brands, Rogers told Bloomberg. “Anything you want is already online. Consumers are looking for curators. We are building a trusted collection.”"

It’s no news that e-commerce will be a core sales-fetching point for almost all businesses in the years to come. And in line with this thought, LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SA, is about ready to launch a new e-commerce website for its Paris-based department store- Le Bon Marche. This also means a huge leap in the digital side of business for the world’s biggest luxury goods group.



Named “24 Sevres” after the Rue de Sevres location of the store in the chic 7th arrondissement, the website will offer fashion, cosmetics, luggage and more from the group’s own portfolio as well as from brands outside it. A total of 150 labels, including names such as Louis Vuitton, Dior and Fendi will be up for grabs on the online store by the mid of June this year. The site will further be launched in 70 countries and will offer its international clients a “very Parisian choice” through a well-designed cluster of exclusive products.

The new website may face competition from names such as Yoox Net-a-Porter, MyTheresa, Matchesfashion.com and LuisaViaRoma who are already offering luxury products virtually. However, it is expected to grow at a fast pace, given its goodwill and strong international alliances. As per a research, web-platforms could form almost 18% of luxury sales by 2025. LVMH’s own online sales equated 5.3 percent of its overall revenue last year. Statistics speaking and otherwise thus, LVMH’s foray into the e-commerce world is a well-solicited choice!

Tinie Tempah Plays Host to Celebrate the Launch of LVMH's Clos19 - WWD,"Thu, 11 May 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3dkLmNvbS9mYXNoaW9uLW5ld3MvZmFzaGlvbi1zY29vcHMvdGluaWUtdGVtcGFoLWhvc3QtY2VsZWJyYXRlLWxhdW5jaC1sdm1oLWNsb3MtMTA4ODU1NzUv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"TINIE TIME: “We love you Tinie, and we love your house.” That was the consensus among guests at an intimate dinner hosted by musician and designer Tinie Tempah at his private residence in London, to mark the launch of Clos19.com, a new online retail platform for wines, spirits and Champagnes by Moët Hennessy.

“You should all just move in,” said the musician, who entertained guests with rap music by the DJ duo Audio Coming Soon and tapped his friend and Michelin star chef Tom Sellers to cook a meal that would accompany the vintage Dom Perignon served by Clos19.

“For me, this was just about being a good host. I love doing that within my own family, so I wanted to let you into my world to see how we do things,” he said. “It’s also about the idea of luxury. For a lot of my friends and I, luxury was something we aspired to, and it acted as a motivator, so sitting here after years of hard work, it sums up what life is about for me.”

Tempah also saw his work pay off earlier in the day, when his new label What We Wear sold out within 24 hours of its release online.

The brand, which made its debut at London Fashion Week Men’s last January, is gearing up for its second presentation in June and partnering with a series of other labels, including Converse, to produce collaboration collections. The team said they will also work toward increasing production in order to make the label more readily available to fans and avoid such quick sell-outs in the future.

Spearheaded by Stephanie Watine Arnault, the new business’ chief executive officer, Clos19 aims to celebrate the art of hosting by offering customers a guide to choosing the perfect bottle for every occasion and the knowledge on how to tell the story behind its label.

“At Moët Hennessy, we produce some of the finest wines, spirits and Champagnes, but unless you travel to the regions you cannot experience them properly. So the idea was to use digital technology to bring the experience to a wider audience,” said Watine Arnault, adding that the project has been 3 years in the making.

Her aim was to incorporate elements of music, art, food and travel to tell the story of Clos19.

“You always need music for entertainment, food to accompany the wine and the different types of cuisines also bring travel into the picture. So we wanted to host a series of different dinners that celebrate all the elements of the art of hosting,” said Watine Arnault.

In addition to Tinie Tempah, Watine Arnault also teamed with brand consultant Hikari Yokoyama and chef Jason Atherton who hosted dinners at a private resident and the Soane’s museum respectively, earlier this week. She is also planning to host another round of dinners which will explore the art of hosting in Germany, later this year.

More than 150 luxury labels will feature on the LVMH multi-brand site, built for the company’s Parisian department store Le Bon Marche. It will start trading next month.

Named 24Sevres.com after the street address of the Left Bank department store, it will ship from France to more than 75 countries. Its initial focus will be on womenswear, and 68 brands will contribute exclusive products for the launch.

It is the first major e-commerce project since the company hired former Apple music executive Ian Rogers in 2015 to head digital efforts at a group level.

Incorporating features like video chats with Parisian stylists, the new site represents a curated selection from a broad range of luxury brands, says Rogers, who is chief digital officer.

“Anything you want is already online,” he says. “Consumers are looking for curators. We are building a trusted collection.”

“It’s a modest beginning, but LVMH plays a long game,” says Rogers.

LVMH’s first major multi-brand e-commerce platform for fashion, Eluxury.com, folded in 2009. It had started selling high-end handbags in 2000, but lost traction as brands pulled out to sell through their own online flagships. Louis Vuitton, for example, started selling online in 2001, with Fendi following in 2015.

LVMH’s beauty emporium Sephora has a thriving multi-brand site, recently cited as a driver of growth for the brand. LVMH CFO Jean-Jacques Guiony last month said the site had reached a “critical mass” to be more profitable than brick-and-mortar sales in the US."

From the 7th arrondissement to the world, the company behind several luxury fashion brands will be launching a new site in June

May 15, 2017 | By Vimi Haridasan

If you love online shopping as much as we do then news of the new LVMH owned e-commerce website must have been welcome news to you too. The fashion conglomerate that owns our favourite fashion houses such as Dior, Louis Vuitton and Fendi is gearing up to launch the new site for Le Bon Marché called “24 Sèvres”.

While we may have to wait a while longer, June 6 to be exact — before the website is ready, shopaholics are sure to have bookmarked company’s new venture. Once it is made available in 70 countries, the site will carry 150 labels including 20 brands that are under LVMH.

“With the launch of 24 Sèvres, we are offering them a truly differentiated online experience built on our unique expertise at Le Bon Marché in Paris,” said Bernard Arnault, Chairman and CEO of LVMH. He added “Shopping at Le Bon Marché is a special and unmissable experience for both local and international clienteles. With 24 Sèvres, our clients can now enjoy this unique feeling every day and night, worldwide.”

Like other sites that offer similar e-commerce services to an international clientele, 24 Sèvres will provide editorial content but will focus on innovative visual merchandising which includes video styling consultations. With more clients shifting their focus to the online market, LVMH is looking to appeal to internet-savvy customers while retaining its exclusivity."

"News Bites | Modern Dazed Acquires Nowness Stake, Kérastase On-Demand, Elie Top Online - The Business of Fashion","Mon, 15 May 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzb2ZmYXNoaW9uLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy9iZWF1dHkvbmV3cy1iaXRlcy1tb2Rlcm4tZGF6ZWQtYWNxdWlyZXMtbm93bmVzcy1zdGFrZS1rZXJhc3Rhc2Utb24tZGVtYW5kLWVsaWUtdG9wL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Welcome to News Bites, BoF's regular feature of the stories that get the industry talking.

Modern Dazed, a new joint venture between Modern Media and Dazed Media, has acquired a majority stake in Nowness.

Modern Dazed aims to scale the digital content platform — which covers art, design, fashion, music and travel — with a focus on growth in China, where Modern Media, a major force in the market, publishes titles like Modern Weekly, InStyle China and Bloomberg Businessweek. Previously, Nowness was operated as a joint venture between Dazed Media and LVMH.

LVMH — which, back in 2010, gave birth to Nowness when it relaunched its failed e-commerce venture eLuxury as a digital content play — will retain a minority stake in the business. The terms of the deal were undisclosed.

“Nowness is one of the most influential platforms in terms of creative, art and fashion,” said Thomas Shao, the chairman and founder of Modern Media, who will become the chairman of Nowness. “The collaboration between the three of us will enable this great platform continue to have better development... [This is] a major step in Modern Media's global strategy.” Representatives of Dazed Media and LVMH declined to comment.

Going forward, Adrian Cheng — the third-generation leader of one of China's most influential business families, the mastermind behind Chow Tai Fook, and the founder of museum-retail concept K11 — will be vice chairman and creative advisor of Nowness. Jefferson Hack, the co-founder and chief executive of Dazed Media, will be its chief executive.

Nowness, which generates revenue by creating and distributing sponsored content, already has a Chinese-language site and the investment from Modern Dazed will help the business to accelerate this presence.

Kérastase is to launch an on-demand blow-dry service in the UK.

The L’Oreal-owned luxury haircare brand has partnered with on-demand beauty company Blow Ltd to deliver at-home hair styling in London, Manchester and Birmingham.

The service, which launches today, will be delivered by Kérastase-trained stylists using Kérastase products, and available via the Blow Ltd mobile app and website.

For Kérastase, the partnership is an effort to tap the experience economy, says Freddie Banks, the brand's commercial manager. “Experience really needs to be at the heart of everything that we do for our consumers,” he says. “This is an opportunity for us to… interact with consumers outside of the time constraints that they normally have, and still maintain a luxury positioning with a personalised, tailored service for them.”

Experience really needs to be at the heart of everything that we do.

The partnership also presents a largely untapped avenue for a brand's growth too, says Dharmash Mistry, co-founder of Blow Ltd. “The big FMCGs (Fast-Moving Consumer Goods companies) have understood that we’re not just doing services on demand, but we effectively will build a new product distribution channel,” he says, explaining that the service allows for the collection of micro-consumer data, an invaluable resource for big beauty players. “We will get the most granular level of data available in the market … [It’s] like gold dust to these guys.”

Blow Ltd, which last month raised £3.5 million in a Series A round from Unilever Ventures, is planning international expansion and now hopes to secure more brand partnerships. “We’re talking to a range of different FMCGs to do exclusive brand fields on each of our verticals,” Mistry says, declining to reveal any specific names.

This is not the only experience-focused, tech collaboration Kérastase has in the pipeline. Later this year the brand will launch a ""smart hairbrush,"" which will provide consumers with insights about the state of their hair, delivering personalised advice and product recommendations via an accompanying mobile app. — Tamison O'Connor

Elie Top has launched a digitally-animated website to showcase his fine jewellery designs.

With the new online platform, launching today, the Parisian designer is aiming to convey much of this intricate detailing of his jewellery digitally. The new site allows consumers to grasp the structural components of Top's designs in the absence of seeing them in his rue Saint-Honoré salon, or stockists such as Colette, Dover Street Market, Boon the Shop in Seoul, and Maxfield in LA.

""Because the pieces are mechanic, the challenge was to show how they open and close or revolve,” says Elie Top image director Chris Bollore.

The project was almost a year in the making, developed by a team of 10 from Havas Digital Factory (Top would not comment on the budget). For Francis Edelin, director of creation for Havas Digital Factory, translating the movement — the “heart-open, heart-closed” aspect of Top’s designs — was critical to the success of the project. Much of this was done using digital animation that shows the turning of pieces in three dimensions. “We wanted to show the slightest of details — even the tiny imperfections of the soldering of the metal to be as faithful as possible,” he says.

But while the immersive pleasure of viewing the jewellery will no doubt enhance curiosity and tempt purchases, no transactions occur on the site. Prices are not even listed, although on Matchesfashion.com, the only retailer carrying Elie Top online, a silver and gold bracelet with a central onyx orb and diamond accents is currently in stock for £9,180, while drop earrings featuring a turquoise spherical core can be had for £6,395.

“Because we’re still a young company, I think it still needs to be that way,” Top explains. “We’ll see in three or four years, maybe; but to start, we needed to give this feeling of real luxury.”

Top, who launched his namesake fine jewellery line in January 2015, has found a following for his ornate designs that reinterpret antique celestial measuring instruments and clockwork elements with modern flourish. Top got his start at Yves Saint Laurent, where he worked under the designer himself, later working for Tom Ford. His specialisation in jewellery began once Alber Elbaz encouraged him to join Lanvin as accessories director.

While he declines to disclose annual sales figures, Top says growth increased by 20 percent between 2015 and 2016.

Top does not rule out an e-shop in future. ""The more you exist online and are known, the more people will be confident to go and buy online,"" he says. — Amy Verner

LVMH launches premium 24 SÈVRES global fashion - TRBusiness,"Thu, 11 May 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRyYnVzaW5lc3MuY29tL3JlZ2lvbmFsLW5ld3MvaW50ZXJuYXRpb25hbC9sdm1oLWxhdW5jaGVzLXByZW1pdW0tMjQtc2V2cmVzLWdsb2JhbC1mYXNoaW9uLzExOTgxNdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"French luxurygoods giant LVMH is to launch the 24sevres.com luxury online fashion retail website this June, featuring over 150 luxury brands, including Louis Vuitton and Christian Dior, across women’s fashion, accessories and beauty, according to its Chairman and CEO Bernard Arnault.

The new website – in both French and English – has been named after the physical Paris address of Le Bon Marché in a move that LVMH and Arnault refer to as ‘an unparalleled Parisian take on fashion, until now conspicuously absent from the e-commerce landscape’.

In what is clearly the company’s biggest acknowledged commitment to the online business in the beauty and fashion sectors to date, Arnault said: “Our clients are highly sophisticated and always in search of creativity and innovation. With the launch of 24 Sèvres, we are offering them a truly differentiated online experience built on our unique expertise at Le Bon Marché in Paris.

LVMH SAYS SITE WILL BE ‘INNOVATIVE AND SUBMERSIVE’

“Shopping at Le Bon Marché is a special and unmissable experience for both local and international clienteles. With 24 Sèvres, our clients can now enjoy this unique feeling every day and night, worldwide.”

The new portal store will initially focus on womenswear, ship to 75 countries, offer exclusives from 68 brands for the launch sell 150 brands of which 30 will be LVMH-owned.

LVMH adds that the site will be both ‘innovative and immersive’, while ‘adapting online shopping to the evolution of the Internet as a visual medium’. It also says it will offer ’standout customer service’, including click-and-collect in Paris, express delivery in more than 75 countries – plus a team of Parisian fashion experts available via video chat rooms.

It will also offer its most exclusive clients the successful loyalty programme of Le Bon Marché as a reward – both in-store and online, as well as through an IOS application.

Adding his comments, Ian Rogers, Chief Digital Officer at LVMH said: “The Internet has evolved from a text-driven editorial medium to an imagery and video-based one. We felt it was time to take our expertise in visual merchandising in the offline retail world and transform it online.”

SPECIAL CAPSULE COLLECTION…

LVMH adds: “In parallel to its global announcement, 24 Sèvres is launching a unique capsule collection created in collaboration with Le Bon Marché and 68 Parisian and international brands including Chloé, Givenchy, Loewe, Marni, and Ferragamo. For this capsule of 77 exclusive pieces, produced in limited quantities, each brand has customized one of its most iconic products.

“Most have invited a creative friend, a figure of the arts, cinema or music scene, or an ambassador of the Parisian art de vivre, to collaborate on the personalization of a piece. Mixing the know-how and authenticity of these renowned brands with the creativity and modernity injected into fashion since 1852 by Le Bon Marché, the launch of the 24 Sèvres exclusive capsule will be a key rendez-vous for global customers on 24sevres.com and at the Parisian department store.”"
"Louis Vuitton, Dior, Marc Jacobs parent company LVMH branches out to ecommerce with launch of 24 Sèvres - Retail Gazette","Thu, 11 May 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldGFpbGdhemV0dGUuY28udWsvYmxvZy8yMDE3LzA1L2x2bWgtYnJhbmNoZXMtZWNvbW1lcmNlL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The parent company of luxury retailers Louis Vuitton, Dior, Marc Jacobs and Bulgari has unveiled plans for a multi-brand ecommerce site that will launch on June 6.

LVMH, otherwise known as LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton, will introduce “24 SÃ¨vres” in 70 markets worldwide and offer products such as luggage, fashion items and cosmetics from more than 150 brands — 20 of which are company’s own.

The new website will also be the only multi-brand online retailer to sell Dior and Louis Vuitton products.

24 SÃ¨vres is being led by former Apple executive Ian Rogers, who joined LVMH in 2015, and a team of 60. Their aim is to trade in 75 markets worldwide.

It’s not the first time retail giant has branched out to online retail, after it closed its eLuxury site in 2009 due to the lack of success and demand at the time.

24 SÃ¨vres is named after the Rue de SÃ¨vres location of Le Bon MarchÃ©, an upmarket department store owned by LVMH, in the Paris’ 7th arrondissement.

A global retail empire run by France‘s richest person Bernard Arnault, LVMH also owns Sephora, Givenchy, Fendi, Tag Heuer, Kenzo and various upmarket alcohol and cosmetics brands.

LVMH readies jumbo bond for Dior acquisition - The Straits Times,"Tue, 16 May 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN0cmFpdHN0aW1lcy5jb20vYnVzaW5lc3MvbHZtaC1yZWFkaWVzLWp1bWJvLWJvbmQtZm9yLWRpb3ItYWNxdWlzaXRpb27SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LONDON (REUTERS) - LVMH has become the latest company to capitalise on a strong market backdrop and favourable funding costs, opting to pre-finance its €12 billion (S$18.4 billion) acquisition of Christian Dior Couture, according to International Financing Review.

LVMH announced last month that the acquisition - slated to close in the third quarter - would be financed with debt, leading investors to anticipate a speedy multi-billion takeout. Europe has become a hotbed for M&A debt financing over the last year with borrowers such as AB InBev and Verizon demonstrating the depth of demand for multi-tranche jumbo trades.

Supply has been further helped by the ECB's corporate purchase programme, which started last June, spurring demand for paper and bringing coupons to all-time lows.

LVMH hit the market on Tuesday for a €4.5 billion bond split into four tranches - an 18-month floater, a three-year fixed, a five-year fixed and a seven-year fixed. Each will be of benchmark size.

Despite initially increasing leverage on the back of the acquisition, analysts at CreditSights said LVMH will still have the strongest financial profile of Europe's retailers. S&P, the only agency that rates LVMH, said last month that its rating will remain at A+ stable.

Some investors warn, however, that the large deal size may affect performance in the secondary market. ""I suppose the market is fairly hot and pricing looks attractive, although I would expect them to do €6.5 billion which may limit performance post issue,"" one investor said early in the marketing process.

The world's biggest luxury group by sales is also servicing a €6.5 billion vendor loan as a stop-gap measure to fund the acquisition. The Christian Dior fashion brand will be combined with the LVMH luxury goods empire as part of a €12 billion move to simplify owner French billionaire Bernard Arnault's business interests.

The Arnault family, which holds a 47 per cent stake in LVMH, will also offer to buy the 25.9 per cent of the Christian Dior holding company it does not already own for around €260 a share. BAML, Barclays, CA CIB, HSBC, JP Morgan and Natixis are active bookrunners on the trade."
Automated logistics centre for LVMH Asia Pacific - Inside Retail Asia,"Wed, 31 May 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vaW5zaWRlcmV0YWlsLmFzaWEvMjAxNy8wNS8zMS9hdXRvbWF0ZWQtbG9naXN0aWNzLWNlbnRyZS1mb3ItbHZtaC1hc2lhLXBhY2lmaWMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Bollore Logistics Singapore has unveiled a plan for a S$10 million (US$7.2 million) automated logistics centre for French luxury products group LVMH.

Supported by the Singapore Economic Development Board (EDB), the 20,000 sqm centre will be built as a shared investment between the partners.

“Automation is the key for Singapore’s logistics sector to cope with emerging patterns globally,” says Bollore Logistics Asia Pacific CEO Cyril Dumon. “The setup will be housed in Bollore Logistics Green Hub, our high-tech logistic centre in Pioneer Turn.”

“The close partnership between LVMH and Bollore Logistics has strongly supported the growth of the business in the past 15 years,” says LVMH Asia Pacific supply-chain director Guillaume Mechain. “Introducing automation further reinforces our connections and emphasises our expertise in safety, quality, service and efficiency for the next 10 years.”

Collectively designed by Bollore Logistics, LVMH and systems supplier Dematic, the combination of multi-shuttle system and picking technology is the first of its type to be deployed in the Singapore region. It can prepare e-commerce orders with high accuracy while cutting the time to market.

“This project represents a number of industry firsts both in Singapore and in the region,” says Dematic Southeast Asia director Michael Bradshaw.

One of its featured is to enable higher storage density to make efficient use of Singapore’s limited warehouse space. In terms of productivity, it will achieve throughput levels up to 10 times faster than conventional methods, and will improve order lead-time while halving manpower needs.

Completion is expected in January."
