LVMH creates blockchain technology to track luxury goods and fight fakes - Designboom,"Fri, 21 Jun 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlc2lnbmJvb20uY29tL3RlY2hub2xvZ3kvbHZtaC1ibG9ja2NoYWluLXRlY2hub2xvZ3ktdHJhY2sta3V4dXJ5LWdvb2RzLTA2LTIxLTIwMTkv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LVMH moët hennessy louis vuitton has developed a platform that uses blockchain technology to track luxury goods and stop counterfeit products from entering the market. the platform, which is called aura, will offer powerful tracking services to brands as well as tracing options to their consumers, giving them access to the lifecycle of products, including the design, raw materials, manufacturing and distribution.

blockchain is a database of time stamped information ‘blocks’ which can be used to record data that represents a financial ledger entry, or a record of a transaction. they can also be used to store other information including product data and proof of identity. these blocks are autonomously updated and stored online in a digital chain, visible for the whole world to see.

using this same system, LVMH has developed aura as a way of authenticating luxury goods. aura will keep track of exactly who is purchasing each piece at the point of sale, and will even go beyond and into the used goods market, making it harder to trade counterfeit product as they wont be recorded within the certified blockchain system of genuine goods.

last year the global brand counterfeiting report 2018 revealed a growing problem in the luxury industry. in the USA alone, 2017 saw a seizure of $1.38 billion worth of counterfeit goods, a 10% increase from the umber of fakes confiscated in 2016.

‘the growth in global trade and technology has positively affected many markets across the world but along with that, it has some major adverse effects as well,’ states the report. ‘business organizations spend a lot of money, time and resources on protecting their brand and trademarks. but even after all the measures, the counterfeit market is booming rapidly.’

LVMH worked with microsoft and blockchain software company consensys to create the platform. the luxury conglomerate plans to implement the platform for louis vuitton and parfums christian dior brands.

discussions are underway to onboard the other brands that are under the LVMH umbrella. if they decide to implement the technology, they will have the option of choosing which features to implement, including disclosing the source of its materials or ‘providing tailored services and strengthening consumer loyalty.’

LVMH reinforces 24S ecommerce and goes into men's fashion - MDS,"Mon, 24 Jun 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZW1kcy5jb20vY29tcGFuaWVzL2x2bWgtcmVpbmZvcmNlcy0yNHMtZWNvbW1lcmNlLWFuZC1nb2VzLWludG8tbWVucy1mYXNoaW9uLmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LVMH boosts the 24S ecommerce. The luxury French giant’s electronic commerce platform has reinforced its business line with the incorporation of men’s fashion brands to its offer.

Among the new firms that the group will incorporate are Balenciaga, Fendi, Gucci, Off-White or Acne Studios, as well as Dior or Céline. “Launching men’s fashion is part of our strategic plan because it is a natural evolution of our business”, has explained Eric Goguey, general director of the platform.

This move comes after the change of name of the platform, from 24 Sèvres to 24S, last May. The objective was to facilitate the identification of the company at an international scale to accelerate the platform develop in the foreign markets in which operates, according to what LVMH explained.

The platform, which was launched two years ago within the French group, has presence in more than one-hundred markets and distributes about two-hundred brands, including LVMH’s firms like Louis Vuitton or Céline, among others.

The French conglomerate ended the first quarter of the exercise of 2019 with sales of 12,538 million euros, 15.5% more than in the same period of the previous year."
"At Kering and LVMH, Corporate Branding Goes Beyond the Logo - The Business of Fashion","Tue, 04 Jun 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzb2ZmYXNoaW9uLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy9sdXh1cnkvYXQta2VyaW5nLWFuZC1sdm1oLWNvcnBvcmF0ZS1icmFuZGluZy1nb2VzLWJleW9uZC10aGUtbG9nby_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS, France — Fashion just wrapped another Cruise season, the time of year when the world's biggest luxury brands try and outdo each other with splashy marketing events made for Instagram. In recent weeks, however, their once-quiet corporate parents have been almost as vocal, rolling out a series of headline-making, spotlight-stealing initiatives.

Just in time for the Copenhagen Fashion Summit in mid-May, Gucci parent Kering announced that it would no longer work with models under the age of 18; that it would develop stricter animal welfare standards across its supply chain; and that it would aim, on behalf of French President Emmanuel Macron, to form an industry coalition to set new climate goals ahead of August's G7 summit. Then, later in the month, at Cannes, the French luxury conglomerate hosted its fifth-annual Women in Motion event, which honoured actresses Gong Li, Elle Fanning and Nadine Labaki, among others.

Arch rival LVMH, while more subdued, has also unveiled a string of corporate programmes in recent weeks, including a biodiversity initiative with UNESCO. The group also dominated the conversation at French conference Vivatech, where it announced the winner of its innovation prize. At the same time, it made headlines for what it wouldn't do: notably, the company said it would continue to work with models aged 16 to 18, and that it would not join the climate coalition being organised by Kering.

A decade ago, these groups were decidedly less chatty, preferring to let their brands do the talking. So, what propelled the shift?

For Kering, a 2013 rebranding signified its transformation from a company made up of disparate businesses to a luxury-focused apparel and accessories group, kicking off a new wave of corporate communications. LVMH's evolution has been more gradual, and its communications therefore steadier.

But while specific factors may have help shaped their own strategies, the primary reason for the change is a universal one: the internet, of course.

""With the digital age comes forced transparency,"" said Justin Peters, executive creative director at Carbone Smolan, the independent agency behind the rebranding of US-based group Tapestry, which owns Coach, Kate Spade New York and Stuart Weitzman. ""The fact that information is at everyone's fingertips, whenever they want it, means that the onus on companies to actually back up when they say.""

A large majority — 86 percent — of Americans say that “transparency from businesses is more important than ever before,” while 81 percent believe social media has increased accountability for businesses, according to a 2018 report from social media solutions provider Sprout Social. But shoppers increasingly want to know as much as they can about the corporations they’re buying into and not just the consumer-facing brands they're buying.

“There is tremendous demand from consumers to feel assured that this is a good company,” said Leslie Gaines-Ross, chief reputation strategist at global communications firm Weber Shandwick.

Fashion and luxury groups like Kering and LVMH, alongside PVH and Tapestry in the US, are taking cues from consumer-packaged goods companies such as Procter & Gamble (P&G) and Unilever, which were early to identify the shift in behavior and have been using corporate-level branding to communicate key messages about their values for at least a decade. P&G's ""Thank you, Mom"" advertising campaign, developed by global agency Wieden + Kennedy for the 2010 Olympics, united what then consisted of 34 unique brands ""under one brand voice.""

Fashion companies have since begun offering more specifics around how they operate, including detailed financial, environmental and social responsibility reports. They have also refined their corporate identities. (In March 2019, Kering unveiled a new corporate website as slick as any of their brand’s.)

Yes, these upgrades are aimed at consumers and investors. But corporations are also using branding as an employee recruitment and retention tool, as younger generations entering the workforce have different workplace expectations than their predecessors. Now, corporations must communicate their values in order to attract in-demand talent.

""The one big thing every corporate brand has to consider is, 'How do we work, how do we behave, what are our attitudes?' Culture is important,"" said Mats Urde, an associate professor at Lund University and co-creator of the Corporate Brand Identity Matrix, presented in January 2019's Harvard Business Review. ""Part of the value proposition and the positioning of a corporate brand is the people behind the brand.""

When deciding whether they want to join a company, the majority of young people say that they care a ""great deal"" or ""fair amount"" about the diversity of an employers' workforce — taking into consideration age, gender and ethnicity — according to a 2010 Deloitte survey of more than 13,000 millennials.

The rise of online activism and ""watchdog"" culture has also made companies more vulnerable to public criticism, making a clearly articulated set of values useful when things go wrong.

“When you experience a crisis, you’re able to easily explain what you stand for and what your values are,” Gaines-Ross said. “You can say that the incident goes against your values and that it should not have happened.” If a corporation has been vocal and straightforward about its values in the past, an apology might be more convincing in the present.

Urde’s matrix, developed in collaboration with Harvard Business School professor Stephen A. Greyser, has three layers: internal elements (mission, culture and core competencies), external-internal elements (distinction, core values, personality) and external elements (value proposition, relationships with stakeholders, market positioning).

B6ZNSJFA2BELBPBOVL3CO6TF6E

But while corporate-level branding is becoming more popular, it’s particularly challenging for fashion groups comprised of individual brands that also need to stand apart. It can be a tricky balance to strike, Urde said. This is especially true for LVMH, which owns more than 70 brands across different categories and price points. Many of its brands are in competition with each other and need their own points of differentiation.

“Individual brands have to be independent to stay unique, but there are some things where you can find synergies,” said Urde, referring to shared human-resource policies and a general emphasis on excellence. “If you work at Christian Dior, you work at Christian Dior. But you belong to LVMH.”

“If you think about the more traditional fashion companies, in the past it’s been more about a collection of brands and not about a unifying set of principles,” Peters added. “They’re starting to look at who they are — those foundational truths — and trying to uncover those again.”

What Cha Ling has taught LVMH about selling beauty in China - Vogue Business,"Wed, 26 Jun 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZvZ3VlYnVzaW5lc3MuY29tL2JlYXV0eS9jaGEtbGluZy1jaGluYS1sdm1oLWJlYXV0edIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Three years on, the Cha Ling line boasts 50 items, including hand cream, massage oil and multiple fragrances that retail between €60 to €250. All products are developed in Guerlain’s French lab and sold in five Chinese flagships in cities like Shanghai, as well as in spas and department stores like Le Bon Marché across France and China.

The Sino aspect of the label comes from the ingredients. Cha Ling is centred around pu’er tea, harvested from Xishuangbanna forest in the southern province of Yunnan, which is said to have anti-ageing and antioxidant benefits. Cha Ling says it has helped replant 130,000 tea trees and 8,000 additional plant species in an area of the forest that was run down by deforestation and pollution. It’s also signed 10-year sustainable supply contracts guaranteeing that its tea tree farmers will receive a regular income.

“Chinese people do want their traditions sold back to them, and Chinese millennials [in particular] are very patriotic and nationalistic,” says Joanne Ooi, marketing expert and former Shanghai Tang creative director. “But the Chinese consumer is among the most sophisticated anywhere, and they smell bullshit five miles away.”

While the brand has doubled its revenue every year since launch and now has 33 dedicated employees across France and China, Boillot says that Cha Ling won’t be ready for greater expansion for at least two years. “I’ve had to say no to many department stores in England and the US because it just wasn’t the right time,” he says. “We are less successful than our sister brands at Kendo [right now], but our eco-friendly positioning will give us an advantage in the future.”

LVMH is deliberately taking its time with Cha Ling, which took six years to develop pre-launch, a lifetime compared to the year it took to build Fenty Beauty. This is partly due to its goal of becoming an entirely natural brand. Today, the line comes with an average of 85 per cent natural ingredients and is on track to reach 90 per cent in the next year. All of the ingredients are 100 per cent traceable by Cha Ling.

Five of Cha Ling’s products come in refillable ceramic packaging, a trend that’s ramped up of late thanks to beauty brands such as Hourglass and Kjaer Weis. The number of refillable products will increase over time, though Boillot is hesitant to replicate the model for every product. “We want to do this whenever it's possible... but luxury beauty customers don’t want to compromise their aesthetic values, so we keep that in mind for certain items where refillable packaging might do that,” he says, pointing to fragrance as an example."
Bernard Arnault of LVMH Becomes Third Person With a Fortune Over $100 Billion - Complex,"Thu, 20 Jun 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNvbXBsZXguY29tL3N0eWxlL2EvaGFubmFoLWxpZnNodXR6L2Jlcm5hcmQtYXJuYXVsdC1sdm1oLWJlY29tZXMtdGhpcmQtcGVyc29uLW5ldC13b3J0aC0xMDAtYmlsbGlvbtIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Bernard Arnault, the chairman of the French luxury goods conglomerate LVMH, has reached the threshold of becoming the third person worth over $100 billion, joining Bill Gates and Jeff Bezos. Arnault, who was already Europe's richest person, is the continent's first and only centibillionaire, according to CNBC.

Arnault cemented his place in the world's most exclusive wealth club Tuesday, after LVMH’s stock jumped 2.9 percent to 368.80€ a share. His fortune has increased by $32 billion this year alone, bringing his net worth to $100.4 billion.

In terms of what accounted for his increase in wealth, LVMH is home to many of the world's leading fashion houses, including Louis Vuitton—where Virgil Abloh is at the helm of menswear creative, Fendi, Celine (formerly known as Céline), Dior, Givenchy, and most recently, Rihanna's Fenty. According to Bloomberg, the increased demand for Louis Vuitton handbags and Hennessy cognac from Chinese consumers have contributed to Arnault's ascendance to the centibillionaire club.

Arnault's $100.4 billion fortune now equals more than 3 percent of France’s economy. The wealth gap in the country has been the subject of much debate in recent months after protesters called on the government to, among other things, reintroduce the tax on the mega-rich. In addition to controlling half of LVMH through a family holding company, Arnault owns a 97 percent stake in Christian Dior, which he bought in 1985 for $15 million.

Other French multibillionaires also fared well on Bloomberg’s ranking in 2019. Kering Group‘s François Pinault, another luxury fashion conglomerate home to Gucci, Saint Laurent, Balenciaga, and more, came in at No. 23, whereas Françoise Bettencourt Meyers, the world's richest woman and the heiress to the L'Oreal fortune, came in at No. 9."

His net worth has increased almost US$32 billion this year, the most on the 500-member Bloomberg Billionaires Index.

France’s multibillionaires have added the most wealth among European members of Bloomberg’s ranking in 2019, with Arnault, Kering SA’s Francois Pinault and cosmetics heir Francoise Bettencourt Meyers tacking on more than US$40 billion between them. Meanwhile, the brothers behind the Chanel brand, Gerard and Alain Wertheimer, saw their fortunes soar US$9.8 billion this week after the Parisian fragrance and fashion house reported its 2018 results.

Arnault’s fortune of US$100.4 billion is worth more than 3 per cent of France’s economy, underscoring the wealth gap in his native country, where protesters have agitated this year for more benefits paid for by the rich. Even amid growing trade tensions, Chinese consumers’ appetite for Louis Vuitton handbags and Hennessy cognac has bolstered results for LVMH, the owner of Dom Perignon champagne and TAG Heuer watches. The company’s shares have surged 43 per cent this year, the third-best performer on France’s CAC 40 Index.

Arnault, 70, and his family are among luxury tycoons who pledged more than US$650 million in April for the reconstruction of Notre Dame Cathedral after the landmark church was ravaged by fire. He controls about half of Paris-based LVMH through a family holding company and also owns a 97 per cent stake in Christian Dior, the fashion house founded three years before his birth in 1949.

Arnault entered the luxury-goods market by acquiring a textile group that owned Christian Dior. He sold all of the company’s other businesses and used the proceeds to buy a controlling stake in LVMH in 1988.

Gates, the Microsoft co-founder, has donated more than US$35 billion to the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. Amazon.com’s Bezos, meanwhile, saw his net worth drop US$40 billion earlier this year after reaching a divorce settlement with MacKenzie Bezos.

LVMH Chairman Bernard Arnault is Now One of Only Three Centibillionaires in the World - The Fashion Law,"Wed, 19 Jun 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWZhc2hpb25sYXcuY29tL2x2bWgtY2hhaXJtYW4tYmVybmFyZC1hcm5hdWx0LWlzLW5vdy1vbmUtb2Ytb25seS10aHJlZS1jZW50aWJpbGxpb25haXJlcy1pbi10aGUtd29ybGQv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Forget being a regular billionaire – Bernard Arnault is now a centibillionaire, a position currently held by just three people in the world. As of Tuesday Arnault – who is the chairman of luxury goods conglomerate LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton – joins the likes of Jeff Bezos and Bill Gates in what Bloomberg calls “the world’s most exclusive wealth club,” with a fortune of at least $100 billion.

70-year old Arnault nabbed the title on Tuesday after LVMH’s stock, which trades on the Amsterdam-headquartered Euronext exchange, climbed 2.9% to a record 368.80 euros a share, increasing his net worth to almost $32 billion so far this year, the biggest total jump on Bloomberg’s 500-member Billionaires Index.

The LVMH chairman, whose conglomerate owns Louis Vuitton, Dior, Givenchy, Celine, Loewe, and Marc Jacobs, among 70 or so other fashion and non-fashion luxury brands, has been inching up the upper echelon of Forbes’ “World’s Richest” list over the past year, in particular. He first ousted Spanish billionaire Amancio Ortega – the force behind retail conglomerate Inditex and its roster of Zara, Zara Home, Massimo Dutti, Bershka, Oysho, Pull and Bear, Stradivarius and Uterqüe – from the number 4 spot on the world’s richest list, as well as for the titles of the wealthiest figure in Europe and the wealthiest figure in fashion.

More recently, Arnault advanced again. This time surpassing 88-year old American business magnate Warren Buffett in April thanks to an LVMH stock surge after the group released its first quarter earnings report. That landed him in the top three, following behind Amazon’s Bezos and Microsoft-founder Gates.

“Arnault’s fortune of $100.4 billion now equals more than 3 percent of France’s economy, underscoring the wealth gap in his native country, where protesters have agitated this year for more benefits paid for by the rich,” Bloomberg noted on Tuesday. So far in 2019, LVMH’s shares have grown by 43 percent, making it the “third-best performer on the French CAC 40,” a market capitalization weighted index that reflects the performance of the 40 largest and most actively traded shares listed on Euronext Paris.

The growth achieved by LVMH, as well as rival conglomerate Kering – which owns Gucci, Balenciaga, Saint Laurent, and Bottega Veneta, and whose stock recorded an increase of more than 33 percent, the largest increase of the year on the CAC 40, as of May 2018 – has been “reshaping the French [CAC 40] benchmark, long the realm of energy, infrastructure, financial and telecommunications stocks,” Bloomberg reported last year.

2018 marked a milestone for LVMH, when it took the top spot on the CAC 40 from Total, the multinational integrated oil and gas company and one of the seven “Supermajor” oil companies in the world, at least in part because of “several complicated years for oil prices, which has been a direct factor in Total’s performance,” Andrea Tueni, an analyst at Saxo Bank, told AFP at the time.

While analysts such as Tueni characterized the spot swap “a small event on the CAC 40,” fashion industry insiders called it a significant endorsement of the financial health of luxury brands, particularly in light of lingering doubts as to the strength of spending in China, whose consumers account for one-third of the world’s luxury spending.

As of the time of publication, LVMH maintained its spot atop the CAC 40 list, followed by L’Oreal and Total."
"A Chanel Deal May Be Out of Reach, Even for LVMH - The Business of Fashion","Fri, 07 Jun 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzb2ZmYXNoaW9uLmNvbS9uZXdzL25ld3MtYW5hbHlzaXMvYS1jaGFuZWwtZGVhbC1tYXktYmUtb3V0LW9mLXJlYWNoLWV2ZW4tZm9yLWx2bWgv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS — Speculation over the ownership of fashion house Chanel has intensified since the February death of creative chief Karl Lagerfeld, however it seems that even the world's largest luxury company thinks a takeover would be too big to swallow.

Chanel is worth nearer to €100 billion ($113 billion) than the €50 billion that some analysts have estimated, so it’s unclear who might be interested, LVMH managers told analysts at an investor day in Paris this week, according to a note by Jefferies International Ltd. analyst Flavio Cereda. An LVMH spokesman wasn’t immediately reachable.

The comments only add fuel to the fire over the future of Chanel, with owners Alain and Gerard Wertheimer having both reached retirement age. The maker of Boy handbags and the iconic No. 5 perfume issued a strongly worded statement in March to halt rumours of a potential sale. Yet the topic hasn’t gone away, with some analysts suggesting that the company’s vast scale may make an initial public offering a more likely exit route.

""Should the owners want an exit strategy — which they often said they don't — an IPO looks probably a more likely scenario,"" said Jelena Sokolova, an analyst at Morningstar Inc. A valuation of €100 billion ""makes sense,"" and means Chanel would be ""too big to swallow"" even for other luxury players, including Kering SA, Richemont and Hermes International, she said.

From LVMH’s perspective, it may not even need such a deal given it’s developing a “mini-Chanel” of its own “internally” with Christian Dior Couture, according to Cereda of Jefferies.

“Her international experience will greatly benefit Starboard’s future potential,” Antonio Belloni, LVMH group managing director, said in a statement.

Bauer, a former Delta executive who was charged with improving the experience of passengers on the airline, also held the role of chief operating officer for the cruise ship company International Cruise & Excursions. At Royal Caribbean International, she was involved with the company’s expansion in Asia.

Miami-based Starboard Cruise Services operates stores on around 100 cruise ships from companies including Royal Caribbean International, Celebrity Cruises, Carnival Cruise Line, Costa Cruises and Norwegian Cruise Line.

Inside LVMH's Plan to Conquer Menswear | BoF - The Business of Fashion,"Tue, 18 Jun 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzb2ZmYXNoaW9uLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy9sdXh1cnkvbHZtaC1wbGFuLXRvLWNvbnF1ZXItbWVuc3dlYXIv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS, France — On Tuesday, the men's fashion scrum will descend upon Paris, the last-but-most-important leg of their five-city tour, which started with a modest proposal in New York a few weeks back and culminates with a bang in the City of Lights.

There's certainly plenty to see. Virgil Abloh at Louis Vuitton, Kim Jones at Dior Men and of course, Hedi Slimane at Celine: each is a star in his own right, and each is designing for one of the biggest fashion houses in the world.

Which all happen to belong to LVMH, the 70-maison-strong French conglomerate, which made a string of high-profile changes in its men's businesses in 2018, bringing Off-White designer Abloh to Louis Vuitton and creating a domino effect that saw former Vuitton menswear designer Jones head to Dior, and longtime Dior Homme designer Kris Van Assche jump over to Berluti. In the midst of those moves came the appointment of Hedi Slimane at Celine, which came with the news that he would also be introducing menswear to the brand previously led by Phoebe Philo.

But it doesn't end there. Givenchy and Loewe, too, are placing greater muscle behind their men's strategies, positioning LVMH to tap into a wide range of tastes in a menswear market that is rapidly shifting. At Pitti Uomo last week, Givenchy designer Clare Waight Keller debuted her first full menswear collection for the label since taking over from Riccardo Tisci in 2017, emphasising tailoring over Tisci's slick streetwear, which came to define his tenure at Givenchy. And then there's Loro Piana, the Italian cashmere house that rivals Brunello Cucinelli in the upscale-casual space, popular with bankers on Wall Street and investors in Silicon Valley.

""The last season in Paris, there was Loewe, JW Anderson, Givenchy, Vuitton, Dior, Celine and Berluti. We were like, boom boom boom,"" said Sidney Toledano, Chairman and Chief Executive of the LVMH Fashion Group. ""Paris became the menswear capital in terms of creativity... LVMH in particular has been excellent in the last seasons because we have the talent, the organisation.""

LVMH, which generated about $17.6 billion (€15.5 billion) from its fashion and leather goods businesses in 2018, understands that future growth will not only come from emerging markets, but new categories of consumers within those markets. At LVMH’s top brands, Louis Vuitton and Dior, men’s categories — including ready-to-wear, shoes, watches and leather goods — now account for approximately 25 percent of sales, according to Citi Research estimates.

“For brands such as LV and Dior that have a strong leather goods business, it’s rather unbalanced. Brands like Givenchy are probably more balanced,” said Citigroup analyst Thomas Chauvet.

Menswear is growing much faster [than womenswear].

But while men’s is a smaller percentage of the overall pie at LVMH, it’s a fast-growing category, with increases “definitely in the double digits,” adds industry analyst Luca Solca. “Menswear is growing much faster [than womenswear].” Menswear at the group is growing at a faster rate than the pace of the overall fashion and leather goods categories.

And yet, the market for men’s high-end clothing is not a free-for-all. Total sales of women’s designer clothes continues to outpace men’s globally. But appetite for men’s designer fashion and footwear is still growing steadily, with the market projected to reach $46 billion by 2023, according to data from Euromonitor International.

The uptick can be attributed to two main drivers: a global move towards more casual, fashion-driven clothing and a rise in sales in Asia — especially China — where men are more fashion-forward than anywhere else.

“The market worldwide is going to convert from the classic men’s business to [being] more fashion-oriented, and the country that’s going to weigh a lot on the market is China,” Toledano said. “Chinese men are crazy about fashion.”

Much of that growth is coming from more casual attire, with sneakers and bomber jackets supplanting a matching blazer, slacks and wingtips. From 2013-2018, men’s footwear was the fastest-growing designer category across both genders, with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 4 percent. By 2018, it was worth $10.5 billion alone.

But why now? The fashion-isation of the male wardrobe reflects the tastes of a new generation of luxury spenders, who have grown up in what Moda Operandi men’s fashion director Josh Peskowitz calls the post-Jordan era. The introduction of Nike’s Air Jordan sneakers in 1985 — the first truly hyped sneaker — normalised male consumers’ desire for fashion.

“Everyone who has come up since then has done so with the consciousness of men’s fashion,” Peskowitz said. “Sneakers were the entryway.”

Slimane's appointment at Dior Homme in 2000 marked another seminal moment for the fashion industry. He popularised the skinny-tailored silhouette, dictating the way men would dress for the next two decades. And Dior Homme's dominance in the Japanese market in particular paved the way for menswear in the burgeoning Asian market. In 2018, the market for men's designer apparel alone in Asia-Pacific hit $8.8 billion, or nearly a third of worldwide sales.

The global rise of K-Pop as a driver of culture has also propelled men's fashion forward, not only thanks to their large influence on the Chinese market, but also their global impact. For instance, Jones recently collaborated with boy band BTS on Dior Men looks for their world tour.

""K-Pop stars like G-Dragon are wearing super-high-end designer clothes, and if that's what people are seeing as an example…,"" Peskowitz said.

And LVMH brands are catering to them. For instance, when Fendi relaunched its menswear with a wacky sportswear aesthetic in 2011, the Asian consumer became a priority.

Fendi Man made a very strong start in Asia. We could see the desire that Chinese men have had to have fun.

""Fendi Man made a very strong start in Asia. We could see the desire that Chinese men have had to have fun,"" Fendi Chief Executive Serge Brunschwig told BoF. ""The bug's eyes motif and the logo have been successful, but it continues with our shift towards more tailoring.""

The house even collaborated with Hong Kong superstar Jackson Wang on the song “FendiMan,” which a song that reached number one in two iTunes categories in the US last year. Meanwhile, Chinese actor Timmy Xu opened the brand’s recent show in Shanghai. Global sales at the label increased by double-digit in 2018.

These cultural shifts have all added up to men under 50 representing a major opportunity for luxury brands. “This man is more image-driven, more conscious of their looks, and more likely to spend money on their looks,” said Marguerite Le Rolland, a research analyst at Euromonitor International.

In order to capitalise on this, LVMH has installed a bench of star designers at the top brands, strategically shifting the conversation to the men’s market. This has helped to further accelerate sales in Asia, where male consumers are more adventurous with ready-to-wear, and are more likely to carry a personal leather item (such as a fanny pack or a handbag) on a regular basis. (The Asian market makes up about 27 percent of the global market for designer men's apparel, while it makes up 22 percent of the global market for women's apparel, according to Euromonitor.)

If you don't have the tailoring, you look like any streetwear brand; you lose the elegance.

Of course, there are challenges. One is the continued contraction of the market for men’s suiting in the Western world. Brands are also bracing for the inevitable burst of the designer sneaker boom, which has been continuing apace for several years now. A return to tailoring via separates — a trend led by Abloh and Jones, nonetheless — indicates that suiting will still be worn, albeit not in the traditional way. Perhaps traditional leather shoes and boots will make a rebound, too.

“For me, [relying on] sneakers and t-shirts is the easy way — and can be dangerous,” Toledano said. “You have to include them, but most of the big designers today understand that you need tailoring. You express it in a coat, a jacket or suit. If you don’t have the tailoring, you look like any streetwear brand; you lose the elegance. Tailoring needs know-how.”

But most importantly, Toledano said that the group is making a concerted effort to keep the products within each brand distinctive. The brands are responding to similar market forces but, there is no overall menswear strategy across the group’s brands.

“We aren’t saying everybody should do this or that. There is some co-ordination at retail, obviously, but the rest is independent,” he said. “What we want is to have enough talented designers to bring a unique identity. Berluti will not look like Dior, Dior will not look like LV.”

Here, BoF outlines the opportunities for several of the leading brands in the portfolio, and where they might face challenges ahead.

LOUIS VUITTON

The men's business at LVMH's cash cow was already strong, thanks to an impressive run by Kim Jones, whose blockbuster collaboration with Supreme signalled the drops-driven distribution model moving to high fashion.

Opportunities: Jones' successor, Virgil Abloh, is perhaps the most-followed designer among a new generation of men's fashion fans, and has an innate understanding of the link between design, marketing and sales. While Abloh's designs are often hyped, his ability to attract the attention of younger generations is in some ways a long-term strategy. If they can't afford to buy Louis Vuitton now, they may still have goodwill towards the brand in the years to come. ""Channel checks and brand momentum indicators converge to very strong organic growth performance for Louis Vuitton,"" Solca wrote in a recent note.

Challenges: While Abloh's meta-concepts for his Off-White label converge art, fashion and industrial design, their staying power is not yet proven. Right now, Louis Vuitton has been able to create enough stability around the core brand that it can hold three very different designers (women's head Nicolas Ghesquière, Abloh and jewellery designer Francesca Amfitheatrof) in its basket without poking holes. That balance will take a lot of work to maintain.

DIOR

Kim Jones was tapped as Dior's Men artistic director in March 2018, shortly after Chief Executive Pietro Beccari arrived from Fendi, marking ""a new era"" at the brand, according to LVMH chairman Bernard Arnault.

Opportunities: An influential fashion figure with friends in high places, Jones has taken to collaborating with a new artist each season, creating novelty while contributing to the formation of the newly christened 'Dior Men' identity. His flair for accessories, a growing category in menswear, is also crucial. His take on the house's classic Saddle bag, first introduced by John Galliano in the women's business, became an instant hit, feeding into the growing demand day bags for men, especially Gen-Z and Millennial consumers in Asia, who are spending on luxury earlier than their Western counterparts. Jones recently created the stage costumes for Korean boy band BTS.

Challenges: Dior has long possessed many different identities, which sometimes creates confusion in the market. There has long been a desire to bring this together under ""One Dior,"" but the brand has a long way to go in this regard. The womenswear collection, currently designed by Maria Grazia Churi, stands in contrast to Jones' work, which in turn stands in contrast to the fragrance, jewellery and beauty lines.

In apparel, Jones’ collections might be too directional for the mass-luxury audience that prefers something more easily digestible. “Kim Jones’ style might be too formal for streetwear aficionados who tend to prefer Balenciaga and Off-White and too street for traditional clients of Dior who like classic tailoring,” said Benjamin Simmenauer, an industry consultant and professor at Institut Français de la Mode. “He merged the two, and it’s hard to find a clientele for that.”

CELINE

When LVMH announced in January 2018 that Hedi Slimane would replace Phoebe Philo at Celine, with ambitions to expand into couture, fragrance and menswear, the news hit like a veritable industry earthquake, pitting the designer against Saint Laurent, a fast-growing brand — previously led by Slimane — in rival Kering’s portfolio.

Opportunities: Slimane's influence on the modern menswear silhouette will be crucial to his success at Celine. ""He's the king of tailoring,"" said Toledano, who worked with Slimane at Dior Homme.

While his polarising first women’s collection was met with scepticism, a better-received second effort, combined with a swift overhaul of the retail network, has kept LVMH confident that Slimane — whose greatest talent is a single, scalable creative vision — will able to develop Celine into a multi-billion-dollar house.

Challenges: Even though Celine has sold menswear occasionally over its history, Slimane is now building a menswear business from scratch, which requires significant investment — and patience. Early market reports suggest that Celine is still waiting for market momentum to hit.

GIVENCHY

Clare Waight Keller’s reign at Givenchy has come with early critical applauds. Recently, she turned her focus onto the menswear category, where her predecessor Riccardo Tisci saw significant success.

Opportunities: Waight Keller is a precise and determined designer, whose first full menswear collection for Givenchy, shown at Pitti Uomo in June 2019, was a statement in colour and tailoring. Whether or not her vision will be differentiated enough to win over consumers must still be tested especially at the high price point that the brand has chosen.

“The Givenchy name is very powerful,” Simmenauer said. “Once the direction is clear and collections include iconic pieces, it can be extremely strong.”

Challenges: The house must reckon with Tisci's customer, who expects elevated streetwear from the label. ""Givenchy is in the shadow of other brands in the group's portfolio,"" Simmenauer added. ""It needs to find its place.""

BERLUTI

LVMH’s most traditional menswear label — LVMH's only pure menswear player — is now under the watch of former Dior Homme designer Van Assche, who was once Slimane’s assistant.

Opportunities: Berluti has a very strong DNA in men's shoes and other leather goods, a key growth category, and Van Assche's minimalist aesthetic is complementary to its more conservative identity.

While ready-to-wear is a small portion of sales, the company is tapping into the growing ultra-luxury segment, opening a showroom on Paris' Left Bank during Paris Fashion Week that is dedicated to tailoring and meant to accommodate the brand's best customers.

Challenges: Berluti has struggled to recast itself since the departure of Alessandro Sartori in 2016, after five years at the label. Three designers within two years is a lot for any brand, even one that has never been known for a star designer. (Before Van Assche, there was Haider Ackermann.)

Fendi menswear Autumn/Winter 2019 | Source: InDigital.Tv Fendi menswear Autumn/Winter 2019 | Source: InDigital.Tv

What’s more, the culture of casualisation has challenged suiting brands like Berluti more than any other segment of the market. Van Assche — who is showing only his second collection for the label this week — has incorporated casualwear elements into his designs, tweaking the logo and featured it on sweatshirts and bomber jackets. But he can’t dabble in streetwear like Abloh or Jones do; their labels are more loosely defined.

FENDI

Designed by Silvia Venturini Fendi, men's has traditionally been a minor player in the Fendi universe. But that changed in 2011 with the relaunch of Fendi Man. The brand, known for its playful accessories and novel artist collaborations, is now moving further into tailoring. For the Autumn/Winter 2019 collection, Venturini Fendi chose Fendi women's creative director Karl Lagerfeld — who passed away in February 2019 — as the season's artistic partner, coinciding with the shift. ""Silvia had the intuition that men will put on jackets again,"" said Chief Executive Serge Brunschwig.

Opportunities: Fendi's success in accessories is translating into the men's market. For the men's Autumn/Winter 2019 season, Fendi released the first men's version of its famous ""Baguette"" handbag. The brand is also working to better align the men's and women's collections, staging its first-ever co-ed show in Shanghai in June 2019.

“It made sense because Karl and Silvia had collaborated on the two collections, men with Karl as the guest artist and women. The two collections were in dialogue,” Brunschwig said.

Challenges: ""Like for all brands, it's about staying in fashion,"" Brunschwig said, adding that hiring the right talent and building a strong retail network are a focus.

The brand must also build beyond its highly recognisable logo. ""The powerful logo is a strength, but it's also the strength of competitors that are bigger, such as Gucci,"" Simmenauer said.

LOEWE

In January 2019, five years after joining the Spanish house, designer Jonathan Anderson staged his first-ever dedicated men's runway show for the label.

Opportunities: Anderson's androgynous appeal allows for a natural crossover between his women's and men's collections, which plays to the rise in gender-fluid clothing. Loewe's growing accessories business also possesses a gender-neutral appeal.

Challenges: The brand's awareness among luxury consumers remains lower than other houses in the group. The key is to expand the brand's footprint while staying true to the creative message.

LORO PIANA

LVMH bought a majority stake in the Italian textile manufacturer, known for its lustrous fabrics, in 2013. It generates three-quarters of its business from finished products, the rest from supplying textiles to other brands.

Opportunities: Positioned in the uppermost luxury bracket alongside Hermès, Brunello Cucinelli and Kiton, Loro Piana appeals to the ""quiet luxury"" clientele that is looking for comfort. What's more, it's expertise is in knitwear, one of the only ready-to-wear categories that performs well on a regular basis.

Challenges: The label has only begun to communicate in a way that gives it a contemporary relevance. In order to compete against the likes of Hermès and Cucinelli, it will need to develop a few key hero products that distinguishes it beyond the materials it uses.

Disclosure: LVMH is part of a group of investors who, together, hold a minority interest in The Business of Fashion. All investors have signed shareholders’ documentation guaranteeing BoF’s complete editorial independence.

We may earn commission on some of the items you choose to buy.

Update, 6/11/19: Good news for U.S. shoppers who've been waiting to try Rihanna's Fenty on IRL: the new brand is about to make its retail debut in New York.

On June 19, Fenty will take over in Soho for a pop-up shop of the new collection. The space will take over the first two floors of the luxury boutique (located at 29 Greene Street) through June 30. This marks the first time the Rihanna-helmed brand will be available to shop in a store outside of Paris, following its launch in May.

For those who can't wait until June 19th to shop Fenty, the first drop is already available to buy online at fenty.com.

Original Article, 5/29/19: Fenty is here. Earlier this month, LVMH and Rihanna confirmed they were launching a new luxury fashion house together: Fenty. And now that the brand has made its official debut in Paris, we finally have a full look at the Rihanna-designed collection.

A newly-released lookbook shows a range of denim pieces, elevated shirting, structured T-shirts, blazers, and wide-leg trousers in Fenty's first installment. The silhouettes feature a mix of cinched waists, strong, voluminous shoulders, and pleated details.

The collection also includes accessories, featuring a range of fanny packs, jewelry, strappy pointed sandals, and sporty eyewear. Rihanna did not come to play.

In a teaser video released before the brand's official launch, Rihanna makes quick (and sleuthy) cameos while styling looks from her first Fenty collection. She styles a diverse lineup of models in all monochromatic looks for a series of different photos.

The launch of the new brand will make for a historic one. It marks the first time LVMH has introduced and built a new brand since Christian Lacroix in 1987. More importantly, Rihanna will be the first woman of color to oversee a fashion house under LVMH.

""Women are forces of this earth. We are multifaceted, complex, vulnerable yet bulletproof, and FENTY speaks to all of our intricacies,"" Rihanna said in a statement from the brand. ""Some days I want to be submissive, many days I’m completely in charge and most days I feel like being both....so it was imperative that we created a line versatile enough to embrace and celebrate us in that way. The collections are easily worn together and meant to be staples in our wardrobe. I’m just hyped to see people in my clothes, man.""

Bad Gal Riri herself modeled pieces from the new collection as well in a profile with New York Times Style Magazine. The rest of us will get to shop Fenty's new collection on May 29th, when it officially launches online at fenty.com. Or if you're in Paris, you can shop the new range at a pop-up store on May 24th."

Help shape the future of investing tools and you could win a $250 gift card!

LVMH Moët Hennessy - Louis Vuitton, Société Européenne (EPA:MC), a large-cap worth €176b, comes to mind for investors seeking a strong and reliable stock investment. Most investors favour these big stocks due to their strong balance sheet and high market liquidity, meaning there are an abundance of stock in the public market available for trading. In times of low liquidity in the market, these firms won’t be left high and dry. They are also relatively unaffected by increases in interest rates. Using the most recent data for MC, I will determine its financial status based on its solvency and liquidity, and assess whether the stock is a safe investment.

Check out our latest analysis for LVMH Moët Hennessy - Louis Vuitton Société Européenne

Does MC Produce Much Cash Relative To Its Debt?

MC's debt level has been constant at around €11b over the previous year which accounts for long term debt. At this current level of debt, the current cash and short-term investment levels stands at €5.3b , ready to be used for running the business. Moreover, MC has generated €8.5b in operating cash flow over the same time period, resulting in an operating cash to total debt ratio of 77%, meaning that MC’s debt is appropriately covered by operating cash.

Does MC’s liquid assets cover its short-term commitments?

With current liabilities at €17b, it seems that the business has been able to meet these obligations given the level of current assets of €24b, with a current ratio of 1.4x. The current ratio is calculated by dividing current assets by current liabilities. Generally, for Luxury companies, this is a reasonable ratio since there's a sufficient cash cushion without leaving too much capital idle or in low-earning investments.

ENXTPA:MC Historical Debt, June 6th 2019

Is MC’s debt level acceptable?

With debt at 33% of equity, MC may be thought of as appropriately levered. MC is not taking on too much debt commitment, which can be restrictive and risky for equity-holders. We can test if MC’s debt levels are sustainable by measuring interest payments against earnings of a company. A company generating earnings after interest and tax at least three times its net interest payments is considered financially sound. For MC, the ratio of 104x suggests that interest is comfortably covered. It is considered a responsible and reassuring practice to maintain high interest coverage, which makes MC and other large-cap investments thought to be safe.

Story continues

Next Steps:

MC has demonstrated its ability to generate sufficient levels of cash flow, while its debt hovers at an appropriate level. Furthermore, the company exhibits an ability to meet its near-term obligations, which isn't a big surprise for a large-cap. This is only a rough assessment of financial health, and I'm sure MC has company-specific issues impacting its capital structure decisions.

The supermodel is one of the first celebrities to wear Rihanna’s new brand that launched under French luxury goods conglomerate LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton in May. Hadid, 22, paired Rihanna’s white denim corset dress with strappy neon green heels and matching statement sunnies.

The expertly-styled look (which she wore just hours before attending the CFDA Awards with designer Michael Kors) proved Hadid is the ultimate Fenty Maison client — edgy, daring and cool — much like Queen RihRih herself, who wore a very similar corset blazer dress to the opening of her Parisian pop-up shop on May 22.

Hadid was the first American celebrity to rock the new brand, but Bollywood actress Sonam Kapoor actually beat her to the punch. The 33-year-old star looked incredible in a salmon-colored Fenty suit with built-in fanny pack at the GQ India Best Dressed party in Mumbai on June 1.

She paired the androgynous ensemble with dainty earrings and an unexpected shoe: Nike high top sneakers.

According to a May statement from LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, Rihanna’s successful Fenty line is the latest to join their powerhouse lineup of brands which include Céline, Dior, Givenchy and Fendi among many more. This breakthrough moment solidified the 31-year-old’s spot in fashion history as she’s now the “first woman to create an original brand at LVMH and the first woman of color at the top of an LVMH maison,” according to The New York Times.

“Designing a line like this with LVMH is an incredibly special moment for us,” Rihanna said in the statement. “Mr. Arnault has given me a unique opportunity to develop a fashion house in the luxury sector, with no artistic limits. I couldn’t imagine a better partner both creatively and business-wise, and I’m ready for the world to see what we have built together.”

Fenty Maison — which marks the first new house created under LVMH since Christian Lacroix in 1987 — is a Paris-based collection of ready-to-wear, shoes and accessories.

Rihanna reflected on this major career achievement in a touching Tweet posted May 10, writing, “big day for the culture. thank you Mr. Arnault for believing in this little girl from the left side of an island, and for giving me the opportunity to grow with you at @LVMH.”

After the success of their first collaborative project Fenty Beauty (which sent shock waves through the makeup world by releasing 40 inclusive shades of foundation in 2017), LVMH Chairman Bernard Arnault said in a statement, “Everybody knows Rihanna as a wonderful singer, but through our partnership at Fenty Beauty, I discovered a true entrepreneur, a real C.E.O. and a terrific leader.”"
The Details that Breathe Life Into LMVH - WWD,"Tue, 25 Jun 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3dkLmNvbS9mZWF0dXJlL2RldGFpbHMtbG12aC1hbm51YWwtcmVwb3J0LWZlbnR5LWJlYXV0eS1sb3Vpcy12dWl0dG9uLWJlbmFyZC1hcm5hdWx0LTEyMDMyMDM0ODMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton is a model for so much of fashion.

It takes its branding and luxury seriously — and on both points it goes deep, nurturing businesses for the very long term and thinking strategically.

Bernard Arnault, chairman and chief executive officer, describes the business in his letter to shareholders in the firm’s annual report this way: “A shared passion to achieve and inspire drives all our maisons, and thrives within each of them. It is reflected in the myriad ways they blend tradition with modernity, and excellence with responsibility. They all have a single ambition: to evoke emotion and imagination with artisanal products that are ever more beautiful, exquisitely crafted, and unique.”

Arnault is talking about the brands that make up the company, but he could be talking about the company itself as well, which is constantly blending the old with the new.

It is perhaps the most-prominent group of brands in the industry — from the flagship Moët Hennessy and Louis Vuitton brands through to Rimowa, Fendi, Celine, Christian Dior Couture, Givenchy, Sephora, Marc Jacobs, Kat Von D and Fenty Beauty by Rihanna — as well as the star’s new fashion line.

And while much of the industry was fretting over younger consumers shifting away from buying things and investing instead in experiences, LVMH last year cut a $2.6 billion deal to buy prestige hotel group Belmond.

Even though LMVH’s annual report was published online this spring, when the 135-page business and branding tome thuds on one’s desk in its hardback form — with a photo of Jennifer Lawrence on the cover — the smaller details stand out.

The financials were already well known — a 10 percent rise in revenues last year to 46 billion euros and a 21 percent increase in profits from recurring operations to 10 million euros.

But that’s just part of the story, the part that investors can’t get enough of. The other details that show the company’s size and also the information that LVMH tracks, catalogues and chooses to reveal is in many ways just as telling. The group believes in the power of scale, in training, in longevity, in history — and Arnault believes in retaining control of the empire he built.

Here, 15 facts from the company’s annual report that prove the devil’s in the details:

1. The LVMH maison with the deepest roots: Le Clos des Lambrays vineyard, established in 1365.

2. The newest LVMH maison listed in the report: Fenty Beauty by Rihanna, established 2017.

3. 4,592: The number of stores.

4. 156,088: The number of employees.

5. 73 percent: Portion of employees who are women.

6. 52 percent: Portion of employees who are Millennials.

7. 7 percent: Portion of workforce over 55 years old.

8. 40,000: The number of employees recruited in 2018.

9. 7,300-plus: The number of interns recruited in 2018.

10. 131 million euros: The amount invested in training.

11. 64.9 million: Bottles of Champagne sold.

12. 93.3 million: Bottles of Cognac sold.

Speculation that Chanel is Seeking a Buyer and that LVMH is the Likely Party Will Not Die - The Fashion Law,"Thu, 06 Jun 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWZhc2hpb25sYXcuY29tL3J1bW9ycy10aGF0LWNoYW5lbC1pcy1zZWVraW5nLWEtYnV5ZXItYW5kLXRoYXQtbHZtaC1pcy10aGUtbGlrZWx5LXBhcnR5LXdpbGwtbm90LWRpZS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Is LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton angling to take over Chanel? That seems to be the question that will not go away. On the heels of looming reports that luxury’s biggest brand – Louis Vuitton – will acquire its closest rival, Chanel, the Paris-based conglomerate’s honcho Bernard Arnault explicitly shot down speculation, calling it “fake news” at the group’s annual shareholder meeting in April 2018. Bruno Pavlovsky, Chanel’s president of fashion, similarly denied the acquisition rumors. Yet, the question resurfaced this week at a two-day closed-door briefing with Louis Vuitton, its parent company LVMH, and analysts.

According to Reuters, “Asked by analysts whether LVMH might buy Chanel – after the French label sparked speculation it was on the block when it published earnings for the first time last June – the group’s CFO Jean-Jacques Guiony said [Chanel’s] size would be a challenge for any buyer.” Per Guiony, as noted by Jefferies’ Flavio Cereda, “Chanel is worth closer to 100 billion euros ($113 billion) than the 50 billion euros often cited in media reports.”

(Guiony has since denied speaking to Chanel’s value, saying in a statement to WWD on Monday, “The LVMH group never comments on the value of its competitors.”)

Pavlovsky was also sure to clarify the brand’s decision to publish its earnings for the first time ever in June 2018, telling BoF in May that the privately-held company released financial information, which it will do again this month, was aimed at “stopping the fake news about the brand and [giving] our customers, our partners — suppliers — transparency about the situation, the impact and the power of the brand today.” Making 110-year old Chanel’s financial results available to the public was “the best way to do so,” he said.

The “fake news” that Pavlovsky says Chanel was trying to squash – or the “false or misleading information.,” as Chanel’s CEO Philippe Blondiaux worded it – centers on “claims that its brand image was getting dusty and that this was impacting business performance,” per BoF, as spawned by a 2017 report “filed [with] the Dutch Chamber of Commerce by an entity called Chanel International BV — a private limited-liability company that was incorporated in the Netherlands and reflects a significant portion of [Chanel’s] overall business.”

The revenue report revealed that Chanel’s sales for 2017 amounted to $9.62 billion, up 11 percent from the year prior. That figure – which takes into account sales of the brand’s ready-to-wear business, accessories, and cosmetics, including its world-famous Chanel No. 5 fragrance – is significant in large part because it means that Chanel “is likely the largest single fashion brand by sales” in the world, the New York Times’ Elizabeth Paton wrote last year – “outpacing rivals like Louis Vuitton and Gucci.”

While the publication clarified Chanel’s standing in the upper echelon of the luxury market, it has led to a whole new slew of rumors, ones that Chanel is potentially looking for a buyer.

As for what is likely to happen, Luca Solca, managing director of luxury goods at Sanford C. Bernstein, told BoF that “while an IPO, merger, investment or strategic acquisition are all possible outcomes, the most likely scenario would be that Chanel maintains the status quo. The likelihood of anything but is “probably 30 percent.”"

She officially begins the role today, reporting directly to LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton Group Managing Director Toni Belloni in Paris.

Ms. Bauer will oversee all operations for cruise retail concessionaire Starboard and sister company Onboard Media. The company employs 2,500 employees working on land and onboard the ships of its eight partner cruise lines.

Toni Belloni said: “Lisa’s career has been rooted in the travel industry. She has a passion for driving the customer experience through innovation. She is an accomplished leader, who possesses an enviable record in the airline, hotel, cruise line and leisure travel Industries.

Before joining Delta, she was Executive Vice President of Global Operations and Chief Operating Officer for global travel and leisure company International Cruise & Excursions (ICE).

Before that, Ms. Bauer held a number of senior roles with Royal Caribbean International (RCI). She served as Executive Vice President of Global Sales and Marketing. In this capacity, she played a key role in the company’s Asia growth strategy and regional team development.

Other positions included Senior Vice President, Hotel Operations, responsible for hotel services, food & beverage, onboard revenue and entertainment, as well as Senior Vice President of Sales, directing North American sales activities at RCI.

“I’m honoured to be assuming the leadership role for Starboard and Onboard Media during this innovative time in both cruise and in retail,” Ms. Bauer said.

“Returning to the industry where I’ve spent the majority of my career and applying my focus for exceptional guest experience is a thrilling proposition. Our customers are celebrating life’s special moments and we have the chance to provide the ultimate memory of their dream vacation. I’m eager to reconnect with our cruise line customers and excited to meet with our global teams who delight thousands of guests every day through The Starboard Way.”

A great appreciator of education, Magugu has named each of his collections after a university subject, often linking it to topical social themes. His Autumn/Winter 2018 Home Economics collection, for example, explored domestic violence in his home country, combining mid-century tropes of domesticity with the colours of household cleaners. “All my collections start from a place that’s quite conceptual, and then I sort of sit down and see how I can bring that into an international fashion collection,” he explains. Magugu also produces an annual print zine, Faculty Press, dedicated to people and ideas in South Africa.

He describes himself as a multidisciplinary — “but a designer first and foremost”. His story is of an ambitious creative working to build a scalable business outside of fashion’s main capitals, one whose keen intellectualism and outsider’s point-of-view is poised to challenge the industry’s status quo.

This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.

How did you decide to launch your own label?

The first thing I did was quit my internship [at Woolworths]. My mom was devastated because she was like, “What are you going to do? You don’t have any money”. In hindsight, it was very early for me to start a brand. I registered the business without a business plan. Now I have one.

I moved to Johannesburg, and it was tough. Yasmin Furmie was my first-ever client; she bought a coat from my graduate collection, Pattern Making. You should see her; she is 65 but the way she dresses with Tupac socks and heels. She came back a lot, especially in the beginning, because she knew I really had nothing.

I had to do other things on the side. I would do drawings and shoots and lookbooks for other brands. I really wanted to focus on my brand full-time but, you know, rent.

Two years later [my former boss at Woolworths], David West, contacted me. They were doing an initiative to support local designers. They selected three designers to stock in their top-performing stores and also paid for our slots at fashion week. I got to meet my agent Annette [Pringle-Kölsch]. She used to be the brand manager for Hugo Boss and then came to Johannesburg to start her own agency. She was right there at the beginning when I didn’t know what wholesale was. I was like, “I just want to make a pretty dress and throw it down the runway.”

Did you consider going abroad to study?

I would have loved to study at Central Saint Martins. I didn’t apply because I’m not from a privileged background. A lot of the funding bodies here were like, ‘We have fashion design available in the country, why study it somewhere else?” It was a hard pill to swallow. My next best option was LISOF in Johannesburg. In hindsight, it was probably best for me to have stayed in the city and be fuelled by my actual environment.

How do you describe your brand’s DNA?

I dress a lot of businesswomen who love beautiful clothes but want them to have a purpose. That’s what I hold my brand to, clothes with a function. Breathable fabrics, smart design inside with pockets — just things that assist day-to-day living."
The Western world's auction-house duopoly is now in private hands - The Economist,"Thu, 20 Jun 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVjb25vbWlzdC5jb20vYnVzaW5lc3MvMjAxOS8wNi8yMC90aGUtd2VzdGVybi13b3JsZHMtYXVjdGlvbi1ob3VzZS1kdW9wb2x5LWlzLW5vdy1pbi1wcml2YXRlLWhhbmRz0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"F OR THE 0.1%, building a legacy long involved amassing million-dollar artworks and bankrolling those who create them. Today billionaires also buy auction houses where such pieces are sold—especially if said billionaires are French. François Pinault of Kering, a luxury-goods group, bought Christie’s in 1998. Bernard Arnault of LVMH , a rival, owned Phillips for a bit in the 2000s. On June 17th Sotheby’s announced its sale to Patrick Drahi, a telecoms tycoon, for $3.7bn, ending three decades of public ownership for the 275-year-old company.

Listen to this story. Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or Android Your browser does not support the <audio> element.

Mr Drahi is not the buyer many expected—and not just because his fortune, which Bloomberg puts at $8.6bn, has humbler origins than fine wine and fashion. Unlike Mr Pinault, whose 3,500-piece collection is worth over $1.4bn, he is an art-market neophyte. Leveraged deals and cost-cutting at his mobile provider, SFR , cast him as a financial engineer rather than a savvy manager. For Mr Drahi, a self-made man, Sotheby’s is a trophy asset, says François Godard of Enders, a research firm. He is paying a 61% premium on its pre-deal share price.

There is logic behind the delisting. In recent years Christie’s and Sotheby’s, which together sell more than 80% of works priced over $1m, have been battling to attract the top lots—with Sotheby’s mostly losing. Christie’s, which is privately held, can afford generous guarantees to sellers. Sotheby’s, under investor scrutiny, cannot. Its share price sank by more than 5% in a day last August after two guaranteed paintings sold for less than expected, hurting margins.

It will now be freer to court high-profile sellers more aggressively—and also to invest in selling more lower-priced pieces, which in the topsy-turvy art world offer higher margins than the big-ticket lots auction houses fight over. Boosting online auctions would help here. So would more private sales—where Sotheby’s acts as a broker and which have grown fast, reaching $1bn last year. Alex Maroccia of Berenberg, a bank, says it may spend more on R & D . Last year it bought Thread Genius, an artificial-intelligence startup that identifies artworks and can recommend similar items to losing bidders.

Buyers and sellers of all but the priciest pieces may rue the increased opacity of the houses’ already baffling commissions. But one group (besides Sotheby’s investors) will rejoice. Some of Mr Drahi’s fellow plutocrats make a killing from financing the guarantees that auction houses offer. For them, the more art that goes under the hammer, the better."
Bernard Arnault Is Now Worth More Than $100 Billion - The Business of Fashion,"Wed, 19 Jun 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzb2ZmYXNoaW9uLmNvbS9uZXdzL2ZpbmFuY2UvdGhlLXdvcmxkLW5vdy1oYXMtdGhyZWUtcGVvcGxlLXdvcnRoLW1vcmUtdGhhbi0xMDAtYmlsbGlvbi1lYWNoL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS, France – Bernard Arnault, Europe's richest person, just joined Jeff Bezos and Bill Gates in the world's most exclusive wealth club with a fortune of at least $100 billion.

Arnault, chairman of LVMH, entered the ranks of centibillionaires Tuesday as the luxury goods maker climbed 2.9 percent to a record €368.80 (around $413.30) a share. His net worth has increased almost $32 billion this year, the most on the 500-member Bloomberg Billionaires Index.

France's multibillionaires have added the most wealth among European members of Bloomberg's ranking in 2019, with Arnault, Kering SA's Francois Pinault and cosmetics heir Francoise Bettencourt Meyers tacking on more than $40 billion between them. Meanwhile, the brothers behind the Chanel brand, Gerard and Alain Wertheimer, saw their fortunes soar $9.8 billion this week after the Parisian fragrance and fashion house reported its 2018 results.

Arnault’s fortune of $100.4 billion now equals more than 3 percent of France’s economy, underscoring the wealth gap in his native country, where protesters have agitated this year for more benefits paid for by the rich. Even amid growing trade tensions, Chinese consumers’ appetite for Louis Vuitton handbags and Hennessy cognac has bolstered results for LVMH, the owner of Dom Perignon Champagne and Tag Heuer watches. The company’s shares have surged 43 percent this year, the third-best performer on France’s CAC 40 Index.

Arnault, 70, and his family are among luxury tycoons who pledged more than $650 million in April for the reconstruction of Notre Dame Cathedral after the landmark church was ravaged by fire. He controls about half of Paris-based LVMH through a family holding company and also owns a 97 percent stake in Christian Dior, the fashion house founded three years before his birth in 1949.

Arnault entered the luxury-goods market by acquiring a textile group that owned Christian Dior. He sold all of the company’s other businesses and used the proceeds to buy a controlling stake in LVMH in 1988.

Gates, the Microsoft Corp. co-founder, has donated more than $35 billion to the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. Amazon.com Inc.’s Bezos, meanwhile, saw his net worthdrop $40 billion earlier this year after reaching a divorce settlement with MacKenzie Bezos.

Kenzo Parts Ways With Humberto Leon and Carol Lim - The Business of Fashion,"Fri, 14 Jun 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzb2ZmYXNoaW9uLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy9sdXh1cnkva2Vuem8tcGFydHMtd2F5cy13aXRoLWh1bWJlcnRvLWxlb24tYW5kLWNhcm9sLWxpbS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS, France — Opening Ceremony founders Humberto Leon and Carol Lim are exiting their roles as co-creative directors of the LVMH-owned fashion house Kenzo, first reported by WWD and confirmed by BoF. They will show their last collection in Paris on June 23, officially parting ways with the house on July 1.

Leon and Lim joined Kenzo in 2011 as the first Asian-American artistic directors at LVMH, nearly a decade after opening the concept store Opening Ceremony on New York's Howard Street, which quickly earned a reputation for spotting and cultivating young talent. (Like many multi-brand retailers, Opening Ceremony also represents brands in a showroom and produces its own label, which is sold at other stores as well.)

""We are thankful to our wonderful Kenzo team and the LVMH group for the opportunity to take forward [founder Kenzo] Takada’s groundbreaking legacy,"" Leon and Lim told BoF in a joint statement. ""We are excited to bring so many rich experiences and memories from our time at Kenzo to new frontiers.""

YWWPVKTERZBO3J4OMA5XOUULRQ

The duo, recruited to lead Kenzo by former LVMH Fashion Group head Pierre-Yves Roussel, are part of a cohort of young American designers who came up in the 2000s, some of which were tapped to inject new energy into established European fashion houses (including Alexander Wang at Balenciaga, Public School at DKNY and Jason Wu at Hugo Boss).

What distinguished Leon and Lim — who first met as students at the University of California in Berkeley — was their playful commercial sensibility. Long before streetwear was a key buzzword for luxury executives, they introduced embroidered Kenzo-branded tiger sweatshirts that became a staple on the street style scene. Through clever advertising — conceived in partnership with creative agency Toiletpaper — and fantastical runway shows, they managed to reposition the label at the advanced contemporary price point, giving it an identity that resonated with both male and female Millennials.

""Humberto and Carol consistently brought diversity and inclusion to the forefront at Kenzo, using their collections, fashion shows, advertising and special projects to engage and galvanize a new generation of creatives,"" Kenzo Chief Executive Sylvie Colin said in a statement.""

But despite being at the forefront of the ""merch"" trend, Kenzo remains a subscale player in the LVMH universe, generating less than €400 million annually, according to market sources. What’s more, the last few years have brought great disruption to the fashion industry, with the drop-driven distribution model infiltrating high-fashion, requiring designers and merchandisers to create a venerable drip feed of content and hit products, and Kenzo was slow to shift.

For LVMH Fashion Group Chief Executive Sidney Toledano, the changeover signals an opportunity to further develop Kenzo beyond its globally recognised fragrances and the novelty-driven items developed by Leon and Lim. A successor will likely be named after their departure.

Meanwhile, Leon and Lim have plenty of work to do at Opening Ceremony, which has undergone several changes since taking on a minority investment from private equity firm Berkshire Partners in 2014. At the time, the plan was to further develop the store's in-house label and open several physical retail stores in addition to those in New York, Los Angeles, Tokyo and London, the latter of which has since closed.

In 2018, in the midst of searching for a new investor, Leon and Lim restructured the business, laying off several employees. They've also bought back Berkshire's shares, and are currently in ""full control of the company.""

At the same time, the duo has continued to stage imaginative events — like a runway show at Disneyland — that often include collaborations with filmmakers, dancers and other artists, bridging the once-deep divide between fashion and popular culture.

With its New York City pop-up opening earlier this week, the LVMH maison has unveiled its next limited-edition collection, “Release 6-19,” with fitting images lensed by none other than Rihanna herself.

While FENTY’s inaugural range is predominantly made up of contemporary denim silhouettes and sleek suiting, the new collection taps into a summery aesthetic that suggests a notion of escape and travel. Different materials such as knit, satin and jersey are employed for crafting body-hugging dresses coming in a sunset-inspired color palette — a gamut of olive green, teal, tangerine orange and fuchsia — as well as eye-catching prints. Designed for the free-spirited, the vacation-ready pieces are created with asymmetrical hemlines and cinched detailing, too. According to a press release, the release also includes a range of oversized graphic T-shirts that evoke the memories of Rihanna’s birthplace, Barbados.

The imagery also offers us a look at the new accessories ranging from eyewear to footwear, to jewelry. In particular, two new sunglass styles have been introduced to this collection, namely the face-shielding Techno Mask and the foldable Centerfold frames.

FENTY is also expanding its highly sought-after footwear offering by introducing the new T-heel, described by the brand as a “sexy, strappy sandal.” On the jewelry side of things, Rihanna devotees can expect to get their hands on statement designs coming in the form of pearl-embellished belly chains, twisted bangles and more splurge-worthy items.

There’s a Finnish invasion taking over fashion. But it’s a quiet, behind-the-scenes kind of invasion. “We have alumni in practically every house in Paris,” says Tuomas Laitinen, senior lecturer at Helsinki’s Aalto University.

The nexus of Helsinki’s fashion industry is not a traditional fashion week like in other European cities — it’s Näytös, Aalto’s end of year runway show for its graduating Bachelor’s and Master’s fashion students. Laitinen oversees each year’s show, and in the past 10 years he’s observed the school’s profile slowly rise throughout Europe and beyond. Thanks to the fact that many of its graduates have won awards from Festival d’Hyères and the LVMH Prize, Näytös is nowadays a hot ticket not just for locals in the fashion industry, but headhunters from LVMH and Kering looking for new talent. It’s no surprise then that Aalto topped Business of Fashion’s list of best fashion schools for 2019.

That’s certainly a boon for those who graduate from the elite university, but it also presents a challenge for Finland’s fashion industry – as headhunters look to poach interns for brands like Saint Laurent and Rick Owens, much of Finland’s young talent leaves to find success. Finland is frequently compared to its neighboring Sweden, but while the former may have Aalto’s reputation, the latter has the financial backbone to support an industry.

“There’s not really an industry in Finland. In Sweden there is, it’s not a high fashion industry. It’s a commercial, high street industry,” Laitinen says. “All that is very commercial, mid-market. There’s nothing wrong with that, but it’s not fashion, it’s garments.”

The local industry is growing though, albeit slowly. Finland is best known for the groundbreaking fashions of Marimekko in the 1960s, but Laitinen says the industry remained relatively quiet for 50 years. “It really had an impact,” he says of Marimekko. “But since that there hasn’t really been anything, until 10 years ago.” Nowadays there are burgeoning designers like Rolf Ekroth, an Aalto graduate who has received financial backing to run both his namesake label and revive Finnish brand Terinit. That is a recent, but welcome, change, Laitinen says. “There will be more hopefully cases like Rolf’s. And that might be a birth of an industry or a proper let’s say fashion scene,” he adds.

“We have alumni in practically every house in Paris.”

But Aalto remains at the center. A sort of pseudo-fashion week, known as Fashion in Helsinki, has sprung up around Näytös to harness its hype, with international press descending on Helsinki for lectures, events and of course the final graduate show. This year’s lineup brought out international stylists, editors, and designers to not only attend Näytös but also participate in lectures on the state of the fashion industry and visit events highlighting up-and-coming Helsinki brands like Nomen Nescio, ensaemble and Mannisto. That editors and stylists from around the world have eyes on Helsinki gives hope to young graduates that going abroad isn’t the only option.

“I think that I previously thought that’s what you should be doing, but now. Of course that’s one way to do it, but I don’t see it as the only path or one to become better,” says Emma Saarnio, an Aalto graduate. Though she herself will soon begin an internship at Louis Vuitton, she notes that those who stay in Finland may have an advantage in not having to learn the workings of a foreign industry. And though Finland lacks the apparel manufacturing industry found in Italy or France, factories can be found just across the water in countries like Estonia.

Helsinki’s profile may be growing, but developing an industry on the level of Sweden or Italy is no small task. For Finnish designer Heikki Salonen, who lectures at London’s Royal College of Art and acts as MM6’s design director, going abroad to the fashion capitals is simply part of the deal, even as homegrown comforts may be hard to give up. “I think it’s very easy here. It’s made really for us in Finland. I think that’s part of the problem in a way.” The country was recently named the happiest country in the world after all.

However, it’s not just fashion, but many Finnish creatives who are obligated to go abroad. “All the Finns are famous for like techno music. And electronic music. They all live in Berlin, cause that’s where it’s happening,” says Salonen. It’s just part of the reality, one that all small countries face compared to their cultural powerhouse neighbors

1 of 5 2 of 5 3 of 5 4 of 5 5 of 5

Some designers however find Finland’s low profile to be a feature, not a bug. Born in Colombia to a Finnish-Colombian family, Mannisto designer Julia Männistö grew up in Helsinki and received her Bachelor’s from Aalto before moving to London to pursue her Master’s at Central Saint Martins. She began her brand in 2015 and has seen interest in the Finnish fashion scene change significantly; when she graduated from Aalto, Männistö says she and her colleagues were worried they’d have to put mannequins in the seats to make it look full enough. “And now it’s like sold in one and a half hour. It’s crazy. I’m like, who is buying these tickets?”

“In here it’s still so baby. We can just do whatever nonsense.”

Männistö says she left London for the simple fact that she ran out of money, but today she’s found that the small scale of Finland’s industry gives her more chances to experiment. In fact, the designer has chosen to live in the smaller city of Turku rather than Helsinki itself. “In here it’s still so baby. We can just do whatever nonsense,” she says. “When I see things happening in London and all that, it’s like, jeez.”

So, which names from this year’s Näytös should you look for to follow in the footsteps of Julia Männistö and Rolf Ekroth? Keep your eyes peeled for Ines Kallaila, whom Marni creative director Francesco Risso, Vogue editor Laird Borrelli-Persson, Director of Palais Galliera Miren Arzalluz and PHIPPS designer Spencer Phipps recognized with this year’s Näytös19 Award. Or for Justus Kantakoski, who scooped up the Diesel Prize. Designers such as Amanda Ripatti and Heidi Karjalainen showed great knack for color and volume. Others showed the power of collaboration, such as Elina Heilanen, Aleksandra Hellberg, Camilla Naukkarinen and Noora Vihervit, whose group collection earned the Marimekko Prize.

And perhaps current and future Aalto graduates won’t need to choose between going abroad and staying home – as Männistö has found, building a brand in Finland doesn’t have to mean remaining isolated. The designer is currently collaborating with Finnish workwear brand Lindström on creating upcycled apparel, but she’s also hoping to return to Colombia to work with the country’s textile producers and artisans. “For a while I will be in here and I will suck in again all this kind of like weirdness from Finland, and then I will again go abroad,” she says.

Wherever this year’s crop of graduates end up, the global fashion world will certainly benefit from their talent."
"Rihanna's $600M Net Worth Makes Her the World's Richest Female Musician, According to Forbes - Yahoo Finance","Tue, 04 Jun 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9yaWhhbm5hLTYwMG0tbmV0LXdvcnRoLW1ha2VzLTIxMzk1MTIyOS5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Rihanna has just been included in Forbes‘ annual list of the world’s richest self-made women. She ranks No. 37 overall, but is the highest-ranked musician on that list, beating out stars like Madonna, Beyonce and Taylor Swift. According to the magazine, Rihanna has a net worth of $600 million.

The beauty mogul, fashion entrepreneur and global pop star from Barbados reportedly raked in much of her earnings from her partnership with LVMH Moey Hennessy Louis Vuitton, the French multibrand luxury conglomerate that owns Dior, Fendi and Celine. Fenty Beauty, which was an overnight success thanks to its 40 shades of foundation, is co-owned by LVMH through its beauty incubator Kendo. The company launched in September 2017 online and at Sephora, reportedly making $100 million in revenue in its first few weeks, and generated $570 million overall in 2018. LVMH reportedly owns 50% of Fenty Beauty, while Rihanna owns about 15%. Before that, Rihanna partnered with another French conglomerate, Kering, on a Fenty x Puma brand that showed for several seasons before she announced her LVMH venture.

She also partnered with LVMH once more for a luxury fashion venture that was announced and released last May. The Fenty brand consists of ready-to-wear, shoes and accessories for women and is based in Paris. Rather than adhering to the traditional fashion calendar and showing on the runways during fashion week, Fenty is being released in “drops” at different times throughout the year on its website. Rihanna also co-owns the Savage X Fenty lingerie line with TechStyle Fashion Group, an online fashion firm based in Los Angeles.

The publication estimated the 31-year-old “Diamonds” songstress to be worth $600 million, but not simply just because of her musical career. Rihanna also has a successful partnership with designer brand LVMH and is the co-owner of Fenty Beauty, which generated approximately $570 million in revenue last year, according to the publication.

The other hard-working women that trail behind Rihanna include Madonna ($570 million), Céline Dion ($450 million) and Beyoncé ($400 million).

Imagine a world in which TLC sang “…Baby One More Time” or Britney Spears belted “Umbrella”? We can’t either. Check out 13 examples below!

Though her music career continues to be a big part of her identity, Rihanna is reaping the rewards of her work in cosmetics and fashion. The Barbados native confirmed her clothing and accessories line with LVMH in May.

“Designing a line like this with LVMH is an incredibly special moment for us,” Rihanna said in a statement at the time. “[LVMH chairman Bernard Arnault] has given me a unique opportunity to develop a fashion house in the luxury sector, with no artistic limits. I couldn’t imagine a better partner both creatively and business-wise, and I’m ready for the world to see what we have built together.”

Arnault also gushed over the excitement of bringing the “Umbrella” singer on board. “Everybody knows Rihanna as a wonderful singer, but through our partnership at Fenty Beauty, I discovered a true entrepreneur, a real CEO and a terrific leader,” he said in a press release. “She naturally finds her full place within LVMH. To support Rihanna to start up the Fenty Maison, we have built a talented and multicultural team supported by the Group resources. I am proud that LVMH is leading this venture and wish it will be a great success.”

Multiple sources exclusively confirmed to Us Weekly in February that Rihanna has finished recording her highly anticipated ninth album. One insider explained to Us at the time that the vocals are complete but “mastering and more behind-the-scenes stuff” are still being worked on."
Cheval Blanc is a French Riviera hideaway with classic bones and modernist interiors - The Spaces,"Fri, 28 Jun 2019 18:18:10 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vdGhlc3BhY2VzLmNvbS9jaGV2YWwtYmxhbmMtaXMtYS1mcmVuY2gtcml2aWVyYS1oaWRlYXdheS13aXRoLWNsYXNzaWMtYm9uZXMtYW5kLW1vZGVybmlzdC1pbnRlcmlvcnMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"From the outside, the new 30-key Cheval Blanc St-Tropez looks like a princely villa harking back to the Riviera’s golden age. But inside, it’s all light modernism, midcentury ceramics, and pops of regal nautical blue.

Formally known as La Résidence de la Pinède, the property’s current iteration comes care of luxury-leader LVMH, whose Cheval Blanc portfolio also includes ‘maisons’ in Courchevel, St Barth, Randheli in the Maldives, and soon Paris. Each house has a signature identity colour, and St Tropez’s is a smooth Riviera blue.

Architect and interiors star Jean-Michel Wilmotte uses the shade – an aristocratic cousin of cobalt – as a punchy inflexion throughout, though his first point of inspiration comes from ceramicist Roger Capron, whose art has been housed at the villa since the 1930s when it was a private home.

A contemporary of Picasso, you can now admire Capron’s original ceramics in the fresh, restrained white-and-oak-accented guest rooms, which start from €850 per night, based on two sharing. The maison’s cool insulating hallways are graced with his geometric, colour-blocked tables and original murals. Even the line drawings from his personal sketchbooks have been lifted to adorn custom rugs throughout. The vividly scribbled sketches of women featured on the spa area rug are already a quick favourite with the staff and guests alike.

Outside, the aesthetic shifts to the neo-classical: a characteristically Tropezian courtyard patio of pines and creamy white parasols butt up against a well-kept beach – the ideal spot to wind down the summer’s long afternoons.

The Bajan beauty has a reported fortune of $600 million. That’s right, Rih has a higher net worth than that of Madonna ($570 million), Celine Dion ($450 million) and Beyoncé ($400 million).

“Most of that comes not from music but from her partnership with LVMH, the French luxury goods giant run by billionaire Bernard Arnault,” reports Forbes on the impressive stat. “Rihanna… and LVMH co-own the makeup brand Fenty Beauty. It launched in September 2017 at Sephora, another LVMH brand, and online at FentyBeauty.com, quickly becoming a viral success. Fenty Beauty racked up a reported $100 million in sales in its first few weeks, propelled by Rihanna’s fame and 71 million Instagram followers.”

Fenty Beauty, Rih’s inclusive and ground-breaking makeup line, reportedly made $570 million in sales in its first 15 months on the market. She recently announced her newest endeavor, Fenty, a clothing line collaboration with LVMH. It will released high-end clothing up to size 14, as well as shoes, jewelry and more.

The new Maison, named Fenty, is centered on Rihanna, developed by her, and takes shape with her vision in terms of ready to wear, shoes and accessories, including commerciality and communication of the brand. Fenty will debut this Spring 2019.

Speaking on the launch, Rihanna said: “Designing a line like this with LVMH is an incredibly special moment for us. Mr. Arnault has given me a unique opportunity to develop a fashion house in the luxury sector, with no artistic limits.

“I couldn’t imagine a better partner both creatively and business-wise, and I’m ready for the world to see what we have built together.”

I am proud that LVMH is leading this venture and wish it will be a great success.”

The singer and entrepreneur’s new fashion brand sees her make history as the first woman of colour to run a brand under LVMH and the first new brand in over 20 years since LMVH launched Christian Lacroix in 1987. The label will join around 70 brands already in the group, including Louis Vuitton, Christian Dior, and Givenchy.

The Bajan singer’s empire also includes her cosmetic brand Fenty Beauty, which reached nearly 500 million euros (£431 million) in sales by the end of 2018, BBC reports. Rihanna also launched her own Savage X Fenty lingerie line in 2018.

The singer’s worth is estimated at $600m (£472m), including revenues made from her fashion and beauty lines in addition to those from her music career.

In May 2019, French luxury brand LVMH confirmed it would launch Rihanna’s fashion company, Fenty, making her the first woman of colour to lead an LVMH fashion house. “I want to be as disruptive as possible,” she told the New York Times of the venture. “The brand is not traditional.”

LVMH also backs Rihanna’s lucrative cosmetics company, Fenty Beauty, which launched in 2017 and is worth more than £3bn, from which Rihanna has earned $570m, Forbes reports. Boots recently acquired UK distribution rights for the brand. She also designs an inclusive lingerie line, Savage x Fenty, in partnership with TechStyle Fashion Group.

In May, Rihanna told the New York Times that she wasn’t driven by money but by her work. “The money means that I can take care of my family. The money means that I can facilitate the businesses that I want to. I can create jobs for other people. My money is not for me; it’s always the thought that I can help someone else or, in the future, for if I have kids.”

In 2012, Rihanna founded the Clara Lionel Foundation, which supports health and education efforts in impoverished communities around the world. In February 2017, she was named humanitarian of the year by Harvard University.

French billionaire Bernard Arnault just joined the world's most exclusive club. Only he, Jeff Bezos, and Bill Gates are members. The key to entrance? Oh, just have a net worth of at least $100 billion. Arnault is not just the richest person in France, he is the richest person in Europe. He is the chairman and CEO of LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE, known as LVMH. The company is the world's largest maker of luxury goods. LVMH is made up of 70 companies including Louis Vuitton, Christian Dior, Dom Perignon, and others.

Arnault is the richest person in the fashion industry. He lives in Paris and has a vacation home on the French Riviera. He made headlines in April after pledging more than $450 million towards the repair of Notre-Dame after the devastating fire that ravaged the historic church.

Arnault has been the chairman and CEO of LVMH since 1989. The company is a family business. Four of his five children work at LVMH or one of its brands. Arnault owns a 96.5% stake in Christian Dior. LVMH had more than $53 billion in revenue in 2018.

Arnault grew up in Roubaix, a town in northern France. He studied engineering at the Ecole Polytechnique. Three former presidents of France and three Nobel Prize winners are alumni of that school. After Arnault graduated, he worked for his father's construction company before getting into the luxury goods industry. In 1984 he became CEO of Financier Agache, a luxury goods holding company.

In 1973, he married Anne Dewavrin. They had two children – Delphine and Antoine Their marriage ended in 1990. In 1991, Arnault married Canadian concert pianist Helene Mercier. They have three children together – Alexandre, Frederic, and Jean.

Delphine worked for American consultancy firm McKinsey & Co. in Paris before joining LVMH. She is the executive vice president at Louis Vuitton. In 2019, at 43, she became the youngest member of LVMH's executive committee. She married Italian wine heir Alessandro Vallarino Gancia in 2005 in what was called France's wedding of the year. They divorced in 2010. Now, she lives with tech billionaire Xavier Niel and has a daughter.

Antoine is chief executive of the menswear label Berluti and chairman of cashmere label Loro Piana, both part of the LVMH empire. He is also the head of communications and image for LVMH. He is married to supermodel Natalia Vodianova, who he met on a 2008 shoot for a Louis Vuitton campaign. The couple lives in Paris with their two kids and Natalia's three kids from a previous marriage.

Alexandre is the CEO of LVMH owned German luggage brand Rimowa. The company brings in more than $455 million in revenue annually. He travels between Cologne, Germany where Rimowa is made, London, Paris, and Los Angeles, where Rimowa has a store.

Frederic is the strategy and digital director at TAG Heuer, LVMH's biggest watch brand. He graduated from Ecole Polytechnique. He interned at Facebook and, like his half-sister, McKiney before joining LVMH's TAG Heuer in 2017.

Jean, Arnault's youngest son, is the only one of his children who doesn't work at LVMH. At least not yet. Considering he is the youngest of his parents three children and they got married in 1991, at the most he is 26-years-old. He is likely younger than that.

In addition to his Paris residence and vacation home in Saint-Tropez, Arnault has spent nearly $97 million on residential properties in Los Angeles's Beverly Hills, Trousdale Estates, and Hollywood Hills neighborhoods.

Arnault has built LVMH into the world's largest luxury goods conglomerate, earning the nickname ""the wolf in the cashmere coat"" along the way.

His wealth is growing at an astonishing rate. In January, he made $4.3 billion in one day after shares of LVMH surged 6.9%. In June, he became the third person in the world to have a net worth of at least $100 billion. Unlike Jeff Bezos and Bill Gates, however, Arnault is not in the technology industry."
Forbes Declares Rihanna the Richest Female Musician in the World! - eurweb.com,"Tue, 11 Jun 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vZXVyd2ViLmNvbS8yMDE5L2ZvcmJlcy1kZWNsYXJlcy1yaWhhbm5hLXRoZS1yaWNoZXN0LWZlbWFsZS1tdXNpY2lhbi1pbi10aGUtd29ybGQv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"*Rihanna, it must be noted, is officially the richest female musician on the planet.

That bit of info, courtesy of Forbes, puts RiRi’s income at approximately $600 million which puts her ahead of other music superstars such as Madonna ($570 million), Celine Dion ($450 million) and Beyoncé ($400 million).

The news of Rihanna’s wealth comes on the heels of Forbes’ pronouncement that her former mentor, Jay Z, had just become the first hip hop billionaire. The real deal here is that Rihanna’s fortune is not the result of music or concert sales, but rather her savvy move into fashion and partership with French luxury goods giant LVMH.

The collabo between the singer and LVMH on Fenty Beauty, which launched in September 2017 at LVMH-owned Sephora, proved to be a winner right from launch. The brand rdidn’t waste any time bringing in the sales. In fact, it reportedly brought in $100 million in just its first few weeks.

Part of the reason for the success of the brand is that she tapped into her humongous social media presence, as well as making the strategic decision for Fenty Beauty to inclusive with its products. They’ve released 40 different shades of foundation in what one analyst told the magazine was a potential shock to the traditional beauty system.

“It challenged the standard convention that you only needed a very defined set of shades to satisfy a market,” Jefferies research analyst Stephanie Wissink said. “Not only did [Fenty Beauty] achieve meaningful sales, but it potentially changed the industry permanently.”

So far, at just 15 months in business, Fenty Beauty has reportedly brought in $570 million in sales, with the business worth an estimated $3 billion for LVMH, which owns a reported 50% of the company to Rihanna’s estimated 15%, a figure her team would not confirm, reports MSN News.

Wait. There’s more. In addition to Fenty Beauty, Rihanna — the first black woman to head up a major Parisian luxury house — also co-owns the Savage X Fenty lingerie line with L.A.-based fashion firm TechStyle Fashion Group and has an upcoming clothing line with LVMH, Fenty, which will produce high-end clothes, shoes, accessories and jewelry; the latter, which launched online in May, will includes sizes up to 14, continuing the singer’s push for inclusiveness evidenced in the Fenty Beauty product line.

All we think of at this point is that somewhere Chris Brown is beating the crap out of himself for beating the crap out of Rihanna back in 2009. Dang. He coulda had her and her money. Well, half of it. Oh well."
