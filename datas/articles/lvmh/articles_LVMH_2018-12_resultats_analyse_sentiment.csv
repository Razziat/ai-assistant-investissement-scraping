LVMH to buy Belmond luxury hotel group for $3.2 billion - CNBC,"Fri, 14 Dec 2018 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tLzIwMTgvMTIvMTQvbHZtaC10by1idXktYmVsbW9uZC1sdXh1cnktaG90ZWwtZ3JvdXAtZm9yLTNwb2ludDItYmlsbGlvbi5odG1s0gFjaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY25iYy5jb20vYW1wLzIwMTgvMTIvMTQvbHZtaC10by1idXktYmVsbW9uZC1sdXh1cnktaG90ZWwtZ3JvdXAtZm9yLTNwb2ludDItYmlsbGlvbi5odG1s?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Luxury goods maker Louis Vuitton Moet Hennessy has agreed to buy Belmond , the owner of hotels including Venice's landmark Cipriani, for $3.2 billion including debt to increase its presence in upmarket hospitality.

LVMH, the firm behind fashion labels Louis Vuitton and Christian Dior, already has hotels including the Cheval Blanc in the prestigious Courchevel ski resort in the French Alps, as well as Bvgalri hotels.

The Belmond deal will give it properties including the only hotel within the Machu Picchu citadel in southern Peru, Hotel Splendido in Portofino on the Italian riviera and the Copacabana Palace in Rio de Janeiro, moving LVMH further into the fast-growing ""experiential"" high-end travel and hospitality sector.

The transaction follows a wave of deals in the luxury hotels sector, including AccorHotels' purchase of FRHI, the parent of the Fairmont and Raffles hotels.

""While some investors may question the acquisition, which appears to lie outside LVMH groups core operations, we believe it is consistent with its long-term strategy focused on offering the consumer a full spectrum of luxury experience,"" Berenberg analysts said in a research note.

LVMH said it would pay $25 per Belmond share, a 40 percent premium to Thursday's closing price.

The deal, expected to close in the first half of 2019, values Belmond's equity at $2.6 billion, and the group, including debt, at $3.2 billion.

Belmond posted earnings of $140 million before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) on revenue of $572 million in the 12 months to Sept. 30.

At 1015 GMT, LVMH shares were down 1.6 percent at 251.65 euros in a weak European stock market.

RBC Capital Markets analysts said the price of the deal - at 5.6 times recent sales and 22.9 times recent EBITDA - looked ""optically high"", but added: ""Belmond owns a unique portfolio of trophy real estate assets, that will allow LVMH to increase its exposure to experiential luxury"".

LVMH, which is run by France’s richest man, Bernard Arnault, announced on Friday it had agreed a takeover of Belmond, the British company that runs the Venice Simplon Orient-Express and the Royal Scotsman as well as high-end river cruises and hotels across 24 countries.

The acquisition is part of LVMH’s drive to expand into unique luxurious experiences to complement its luxury goods brands, including Marc Jacobs, Céline, Givenchy and Dom Pérignon. LVMH already owns a string of high-end hotels including the Cheval Blanc in Courchevel, which has been a firm favourite among fashion industry movers and shakers since the 1850s.

Arnault, LVMH’s chairman and chief executive, who has an estimated $60bn fortune, said: “Belmond delivers unique experiences to discerning travellers and owns a number of exceptional assets in the most desirable destinations. Its heritage, its innovative services, its excellence in execution and its entrepreneurship resonates well with the values of the group and is complementary to our own Cheval Blanc maisons and the Bulgari hotels activities. This acquisition will significantly increase LVMH’s presence in the ultimate hospitality world.”

Belmond began by buying the legendary Hotel Cipriani in Venice in 1976. A year later, the company started collecting carriages from the Venice Simplon-Orient-Express – made world-famous by Agatha Christie in her novel Murder on the Orient Express. In 1982, the company relaunched the high-end rail service from London to Venice with the original 1920s and 30s carriages.

The company also runs the British Pullman, the Royal Scotsman, the Grand Hibernian in Ireland, the Andean Explorer in Peru, and the Eastern & Oriental Express between Bangkok and Singapore.

Belmond also owns New York’s “21” Club, a Manhattan restaurant popular with Donald Trump and the US Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin. It also owns the only hotel near Machu Picchu and safari camps in Botswana.

Roeland Vos, Belmond’s chief executive, said: “We are confident that, as part of LVMH’s world-class family of brands, Belmond’s ability to deliver timeless, one-of-a-kind luxury experiences will reach new levels.”

Group Dynamics: The LVMH Growth Model Is a Hard One to Follow - WWD,"Fri, 21 Dec 2018 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vd3dkLmNvbS9mZWF0dXJlL2xlYWRlci1sdm1oLWdyb3d0aC1taWNoYWVsLWtvcnMtY2FwcmktdGFwZXN0cnktMTIwMjkzOTc4Ny_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton found a home in hotels—in addition to wines, spirits, perfumes, cosmetics, watches, jewelry, leather goods, fashion and more.

When the Bernard Arnault-run giant agreed to buy hotel operator Belmond for $2.6 billion last week, the deal was a surprise, but the rationale wasn’t.

The company is laser-focused on the high-end consumer, but beyond that, it travels far and wide, jumping across category and geography as it chases mostly higher-end consumers. It’s a neat trick, but very hard to duplicate.

And the American companies that are closest to replicating the magic—from Tapestry Inc. and Michael Kors Holdings to VF Corp. and PVH Corp.—might never really get there.

LVMH’s approach has earned it sales of nearly 45 billion euros and a market capitalization of more than 125 billion euros. From Moët & Chandon Champagne and Christian Dior couture to Givenchy Parfums and Hublot watches, the company tries, and most often succeeds, at doing it all.

But fashion’s mini-LVMH’s—the groups out on the hunt for more deals— are so far doubling down at what they’re already good at or just tiptoeing out of their comfort spots.

Tapestry has built off of Coach and added Stuart Weitzman and Kate Spade, while Kors used cash flow from its namesake business to bring in Jimmy Choo and, soon, Versace. PVH Corp. is another house of brands staying close to home, with Tommy Hilfiger, Calvin Klein and a desire to bring in another fashion brand.

John D. Idol, chairman and chief executive officer of Kors, which will be renamed Capri Holdings when Versace comes on board, told WWD the growing brand group is unique in that “our two acquisitions have truly been in the luxury space.”

“We are trying to build a company that has a concentration of founder-led brands,” he said, referring to Kors, Donatella Versace of Versace and Sandra Choi of Jimmy Choo. “We have three fierce leaders who are deeply engaged to say the least. And we are trying to steer and focus the company in the luxury arena, which bodes very well for the long-term growth of the group.”

There are good reasons for building scale, moving further into luxury and sticking with what one knows, but the question is whether the world is changing too fast to stay in one place and work with more of the same.

For LVMH, clearly, the answer is to keep reaching out.

“The future of luxury will be not only in luxury goods, as it’s been for many, many years, but also in luxury experiences, and we want to be in both segments,” Jean-Jacques Guiony, chief financial officer of LVMH, told a conference call recently. “We think the so-called experiential luxury is something that will be important in the future and it’s a great opportunity that we have to participate into that with such high-quality assets as Belmond,” which includes grand hotels, a safari business and seven luxury tourist trains.

Ultimately, it might not be a good idea to try to be another LVMH in a literal sense.

“LVMH has some unassailable market positions,” said consultant Jonathan Low, partner at Predictiv. “Even if Michael Kors or Tapestry is putting together a similar type of conglomerate, it’s never going to have quite that sheen.

“They have a highly integrated management system,” he said of LVMH. “They are extracting knowledge from each of their businesses and applying it to their other businesses. They do a lot of cross-fertilization of executives and even artisans, so it’s not plug and play at all, it’s a well managed business.”

Low suggested that other companies need to look at the world today and think more broadly, for instance, by taking steps to incorporate more artificial intelligence.

“LVMH is the past and they’re building on it,” he said. “Think future, look ahead. Technology is now a useful tool for fashion, so focus on how you can monetize that.”

But as Kors and Tapestry start to take off and decide just how far to expand and in what direction, other big players that have cobbled together businesses from relatively far-flung sectors have retreated back to their core, relying on focus to fuel growth for now.

Gucci parent Kering spun out Puma, completing its exit from the sport and lifestyle category. It is also ending its collaboration with Stella McCartney and walking away from Christopher Kane and Tomas Maier.

“Our aim is straightforward,” said Jean-François Palus, group managing director, to analysts. “We are looking to concentrate on brands over which we exercise full control, brands that are scalable and can fully benefit from integration into our platform, brands in which we can invest to help them achieve their full potential.”

In short, Kering is placing fewer, bigger bets on the future.

The same is true for North Face parent VF Corp., which got out of contemporary fashion and is now spinning off its jeans business, leaving it more focused on its outdoor and action sport activities (and perhaps better positioned to branch out in new directions).

But as the big get bigger—or shrink to position themselves for even more growth down the line—they are expected to eventually branch out further if they’re looking for major growth.

“In the era of FAANG, we’re absolutely living in the era of conglomerates,” said Simeon Siegel, a stock analyst at Nomura Securities, using Wall Street’s shorthand for tech giants Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google. “The notion of being really good at one thing isn’t good enough these days. So figuring out how to expand what you’re good at and how to expand your scale is important.”

Siegel said it’s only natural that companies looking to start that process would stay close to what they know at first.

“When a single brand first decides to become an operating parent, there is merit at the beginning in expanding into what they already know,” he said. “‘How far do you expand?’ is a relevant question.”

For companies like Kors and Tapestry, the ultimate destination might not be clear for some time, but the pressure to keep pushing forward will remain.

Siegel said brands naturally have their limit. For retail sales in the U.S., he pegged it at generally about $3 billion for brands that go direct to the consumer and around $5 billion for companies that wholesale.

And when that limit approaches, human nature kicks in.

“Companies can’t appreciate that there is a ceiling,” Siegel said, speaking generally. “When you’re in the middle of it, you can never believe—whether it’s socially, professionally, humans are not hardwired to believe they’ve hit a peak.

“If you finally do acknowledge that you don’t have organic growth, but you’re still an ‘A type’ person, you need to grow,” he said. “That forces you to look outward.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999717473983765}",neutral,0.9999717473983765,0
What LVMH’s Belmond Buy Means for the Future of Luxury Travel - Skift Travel News,"Fri, 14 Dec 2018 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vc2tpZnQuY29tLzIwMTgvMTIvMTQvd2hhdC1sdm1ocy1iZWxtb25kLWJ1eS1tZWFucy1mb3ItdGhlLWZ1dHVyZS1vZi1sdXh1cnktdHJhdmVsL9IBXmh0dHBzOi8vc2tpZnQuY29tLzIwMTgvMTIvMTQvd2hhdC1sdm1ocy1iZWxtb25kLWJ1eS1tZWFucy1mb3ItdGhlLWZ1dHVyZS1vZi1sdXh1cnktdHJhdmVsL2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LVMH might not have been the most obvious of suitors for Belmond's luxury assets, but now that it's close to owning them, it's a deal that makes a lot of sense in this post-experience economy still contending with the concept of new luxury.

In the luxury hotel space, AccorHotels and Marriott have some new competition.

French luxury conglomerate LVMH, the company behind such iconic brands as Dom Perignon and Louis Vuitton, wasn’t the most obvious of suitors for the storied Belmond collection of 46 luxury hotels, trains, and cruises, which were formerly known as Orient-Express.

In fact, most in the real estate and hospitality and travel industries assumed that the usual suspects, such as Blackstone, KSL Partners, or maybe even Hilton, would wind up owning a piece of Belmond.

But now that LVMH has officially inked a $2.6 billion all-cash agreement with Belmond, its move to make Belmond a part of its relatively small but growing hospitality business makes all the more sense as LVMH hopes to “reach a critical mass in the ultimate hospitality world,” as Chris Hollis, LVMH director of financial communications, remarked during a Friday conference call regarding the acquisition.

Why This Deal Makes Sense

In addition to owning brands like Christian Dior, Hennessy, Veuve Clicquot, and even cosmetics retailer Sephora and luxury luggage maker Rimowa, LVMH has its own relatively small but growing hospitality unit that includes the Cheval Blanc brand of four maisons and the Bulgari brand of hotels, which is distributed via a partnership with Marriott International and has six locations.

As luxury consumer tastes evolve and the desire for more experience-driven luxury grows as Millennials and Gen Z dominate the market, it only makes sense that LVMH would explore luxury experiences beyond products or hard goods.

LVMH Chief Financial Officer Jean-Jacques Guiony said on the same conference call Friday that LVMH was moved to buy Belmond not because it saw a lack of “opportunities in traditional luxury goods” but because “the future of luxury will be not only in luxury goods as it’s been for many, many years but also in luxury experiences and we want to be in both segments, which is as simple as that.”

“This is a great move for LVMH and helps to solidify the future of Belmond,” said Becky Powell, president of luxury travel agency Protravel International. “Consumer interest is shifting from goods to experiences and this acquisition positions LVMH to bring the two together — exclusive goods and unique properties — a marriage that will give them the opportunity to create incredible experiences.”

As for concerns about Belmond’s financial struggles over the past few years, Guiony didn’t see them as a hindrance to LVMH’s ability to turn a profit from the transaction.

Belmond reported a net loss of $1.5 million in the second quarter, which was lower than the $4.9 million loss that it saw in the second quarter of 2017, but in the third quarter it did see a bit of a takeover bounce.

The 42 percent premium that LVMH is paying for Belmond doesn’t appear to be extravagant, either.

“LVMH is not overpaying for Belmond,” said David Katz, managing director at Jeffries. “These are iconic trophy level assets. Our view right along is that the amount they earn or the multiple paid would be far less relevant then the trophy qualities of the assets and the demand for them would be high.”

Katz also said that, in his opinion, Wall Street may likely be pleased with the transaction.

“I can’t speak for how shareholders will react today, but what I can tell you is what our view is,” he said. “When we upgraded the stock, and put a buy on it after Belmond announced it was seeking strategic alternatives, we got to about $24.” LVMH is paying $25 a share.

Following news of the deal, Belmond shares rose from $17.65 a share on Thursday to $24.73, and LVMH shares have dropped minimally from $57.96 a share on Thursday to a low of $56.71 per share.

The financial synergies of this deal, which Guiony said would be particularly hard to quantify, given that LVMH’s existing hospitality business is so small, might not be clear, but what is clear is the highly complementary nature of LVMH’s luxury brand portfolio to Belmond.

“It’s very clear that there are a lot of cross optimization that’s going to promote between our wine and spirit business and Belmond,” Guiony noted. “Some of the luxury hotels also have boutiques of luxury brands, so that’s another fairly obvious avenue. Client events, both Belmond clients or LVMH’s clients, could help each others’ locations.”

LVMH’s work with building the Cheval Blanc brand, which it launched in 2006, also bodes well for the future of Belmond, said Melissa Biggs Bradley, founder and CEO of luxury travel agency Indagare.

“As a longtime member of Belmond’s Bellini club of top travel agents and someone who loves many of their properties, I view LVMH as a dream acquirer,” she said. “They have an incredible track record of evolving and protecting heritage luxury brands like Louis Vuitton and Dior and in recent years, they have established themselves as an important hospitality player at the highest end of the market with Bulgari and Cheval Blanc.”

She added, “What has been most exciting to see with Cheval Blanc is how they are raising the bar with luxury experiences within a hotel setting whether that is in customizing and expanding the bathroom amenities or incorporating art and cuisine pop ups or even surprising guests with framed photos from their holiday in their rooms. It will be fascinating to see how they bring this experience ‘alchemy’ as they call it to some of the world’s most storied properties, which have amazing bones, locations and legends but need some modern innovation.”

What LVMH Intends to Do with Belmond

Retaining Belmond’s iconic history and heritage seems paramount to LVMH, as is growing the relatively new brand of Belmond itself, which was launched in 2014 after the company lost the rights to use its former Orient-Express brand name. So, don’t expect the Belmond brand to go away.

In fact, LVMH, Guiony said, is committed to following Belmond’s strategy to double its portfolio of properties by 2020, and is even more so committed to building up the brand itself.

“The Belmond brand is emerging,” he said. “It’s much better known than it used to be, but it’s a fairly new name in the industry. Some investments have been made, some investments will be made, but it’s very clear that the recognition of the name is not what it could be, having started to develop it only a few years back. So, we will back investments behind the brand. And we will help with our existing products.”

Guiony stressed that LVMH has no intention of selling Belmond’s treasure trove of luxury real estate assets, nor any intention to move its London headquarters or make any major staffing changes. In other words, don’t expect LVMH to play the asset-light game when it comes to its newest pending purchase.

“The fact that Belmond owns an extremely large share and I would say unusually large share compared to peers of the portfolio is in our view a very strong competitive advantage,” he said. “It enables alignment of interest in between landlords and operators, which is not always the case, obviously, when you dissociate the two. And in our view, it’s a key advantage — a competitive advantage going forward with Belmond.”

He later added, “As far as luxury, hospitality and particularly ultimate luxury hospitality is concerned, I think aligning the real estate and the operations is extremely important. So, we will not change this. The reason being that this is a very main reason why we were interested in the first place in this operation.”

And while growth is obviously important for any business, LVMH is more concerned with building brand equity first and foremost, but it isn’t ruling out the possibility of growing the Belmond brand through management contracts or buying up more real estate assets.

“The priority is to develop the brand, to improve the profitability of these exceptional properties and to nurture collaborations with the other LVMH brands,” Guiony said. “This being said, I also mentioned that if we have a hotel management agreement opportunities, we will obviously look at them. And besides, if we end up having opportunities to enlarge the portfolio of owned assets, why not?”

What This Means for the Future of Luxury Hospitality and Travel

Like Biggs Bradley, Embark founder and managing partner Jack S. Ezon, is “very excited” about LVMH ultimately owning Belmond.

“I couldn’t have wished for a better suitor,” he said. “I would hate to have seen Belmond being sold to a big consolidated brand company like a Marriott or an Accor because I think it would have just gotten lost in the mix.”

The luxury hospitality market, in particular, has been dominated by two players in recent years, Marriott and AccorHotels, thanks to multiple mergers and acquisitions. And with all that consolidation, Ezon feels that the core of true luxury hospitality has eroded.

“I think all these large brands are forgetting about what real hospitality means,” Ezon explained. “They are all committed to ROI and RevPAR (revenue per available room) reports to their owners and not necessarily to hospitality. I know LVMH has a different approach. They are very committed to luxury in everything they do. They are committed to branding. They will allow Belmond to excel in the luxury hospitality business where those big brands will not. We see true luxury hospitality fading in those big brands. Four Seasons, Ritz-Carlton — none of them are the same a they used to be, with the exception of Rosewood.”

LVMH’s excellence in branding, Ezon also believes, will help Belmond tremendously.

“Who knows how to market luxury brands better than LVMH? Their approach to branding and keeping brands specific and true to who they are is heads and shoulders above any other company. There’s leverage on the backend but no one of on the front end recognizes that; no one even realizes that they own all of the brands they do. Marriott is trying to do leveraging on back end, but you feel it on the front end. You don’t see that with LVMH.”

The LVMH-Belmond deal may also herald a new era of consolidation among luxury brands beyond traditional categories, one in which retail brands and travel brands aren’t limited to separate platforms but exist together. And for Belmond in particular, this could be a huge positive.

“It’s been our view that [Belmond] could be or yield better earnings and run more effectively on a larger platform. that’s been our view for a long time,” Katz said. “The current management team has put forth a good strategy but with limited size and resources we still felt that a larger platform ad better resources would yield better operating results.”

Whatever LVMH ultimately decides to do with Belmond — depending on whether LVMH and Belmond shareholders agree to the deal — the luxury hospitality world, and Marriott and AccorHotels especially, will see growing competition in the space for the attention of the world’s most discerning travelers and consumers.

When Your New C.E.O. Is Also Your New Husband - The New York Times,"Tue, 11 Dec 2018 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMTgvMTIvMTEvZmFzaGlvbi90b3J5LWJ1cmNoLXBpZXJyZS15dmVzLXJvdXNzZWwtY2VvLmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"New York fashion has a new family-run company.

On Tuesday Tory Burch named Pierre-Yves Roussel, a former LVMH Moët Hennessey Louis Vuitton executive, as her chief executive, moving herself into the role of chief creative officer and executive chairman. That Mr. Roussel also happens to be her new husband (they were married in November after becoming engaged in 2016) is both par for the course in the industry and something of a redesign.

American fashion hasn’t had this kind of couple at the top of one of its marquee brands since the days of Donna Karan and Stephan Weiss. Though thanks to social media, direct-to-consumer retail and the demand for increasing corporate transparency, what it means to be that couple these days is a very different question.

One Mr. Roussel and Ms. Burch, whether they like it or not, are now poised to answer.

There’s no question Mr. Roussel is eminently qualified for the job. The former C.E.O. of the LVMH fashion group, he was charged with building up the luxury conglomerate’s smaller brands, including Celine and Marc Jacobs, and division sales tripled during his tenure. Mr. Roussel has long been fascinated by the contemporary fashion space, especially in the American market. He and Ms. Burch met when he was exploring a potential acquisition for LVMH, and he was the driving force behind hiring Humberto Leon and Carol Lim of Opening Ceremony for Kenzo, transforming that into a more accessible brand, as well as preserving DKNY when Donna Karan left the company and LVMH closed the higher-priced main Donna Karan line (they later sold the lower priced line to G-III).

When he left his fashion group post in early 2018, becoming a special adviser to Bernard Arnault, chairman of LVMH, Mr. Roussel said he was intending to move back into an operational role in the future. Presumably he has been talking business with Ms. Burch on an ad hoc basis over dinner for a while now.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.999993085861206}",neutral,0.999993085861206,0
LVMH Just Acquired Belmond Hotels for $3.2 Billion - W Magazine,"Fri, 14 Dec 2018 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiMWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndtYWdhemluZS5jb20vc3RvcnkvbHZtaC1idXlzLWJlbG1vbmTSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Louis Vuitton’s parent company LVMH is ready to curate your entire existence, like an upscale Amazon Prime. On Friday, LVMH announced a deal in which it would acquire the luxury hotel brand Belmond, whose 46 hotels, cruise lines, and trains span 24 countries and include, most notably, Venice’s Hotel Cipriani (perhaps best known as the place where celebrities like George and Amal Clooney and Lady Gaga and her feathers stay during the Venice Film Festival), for a total of $3.2 billion, according to Reuters. (Though the price is likely to invite a bit of sticker shock, it’s actually nothing compared to the $13.1 LVMH dished out to take full control of Christian Dior last year.)

The deal, which will be finalized in the first half of 2019, according to a press release, expands LVMH’s reach into luxury experiences in addition to luxury consumer goods—the fashion conglomerate already owns the Cheval Blanc hotel chain, which includes a resort at Courchevel, in the French Alps, and the Bulgari hotels. In addition to properties in destinations like St. Petersburg, Rio de Janeiro, and Mandalay, Belmond also runs the 21 Club, the midtown Manhattan restaurant frequented by Donald Trump and Steve Mnuchin. This will “significantly increase LVMH’s presence in the ultimate hospitality world,” as LVMH CEO Bernard Arnault wrote in a statement announcing the purchase, worth $2.6 billion in equity value (essentially what LVMH pays up front) and $3.2 in enterprise value (the sum total of the deal).

Belmond announced it was up for sale in August of this year, having fended off an offer from an Indian conglomerate, the Tata Group, five years ago, according to the Dow Jones’s Marketwatch. This new acquisition has been interpreted as an effort to appeal to LVMH’s younger customers, who, per the Wall Street Journal, are more likely to invest in “experiential luxury”—staying at a chic hotel, taking a luxe train ride or river cruise—than in a luxe bag or pair of shoes.

Of course, LVMH would rather you have it both ways: In 2012, Louis Vuitton unveiled “Objets Nomades,” a collection of luxury travel items including a leather hammock that retails for a cool $44,500 and a hanging egg chair swaddled in fur that goes for $116,000. But until now, where could you possibly find two trees worthy of hanging up that chic hammock you spent more than a year’s rent on? Presumably, now there is an answer.

Three Reasons why LVMH's Acquisition of Belmond is a Smart Move | By Florent Girardin - Hospitality Net,"Wed, 26 Dec 2018 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiM2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmhvc3BpdGFsaXR5bmV0Lm9yZy9vcGluaW9uLzQwOTEzNjcuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LVMH, the world's largest luxury group by revenue (42.6 billion euros in 2017), hit the headlines recently on the news of its acquisition of Belmond, which operates luxury hotels and train services in two dozen countries, for 3.2 billion dollars, including debt.

Through the acquisition, the LVMH group will increase its presence in luxury hospitality as Belmond's portfolio includes the Hotel Cipriani in Venice, the Copacabana Palace in Rio de Janeiro, and Hotel Splendido in Portofino on the Italian Riviera, as well as the Venice Simplon-Orient-Express and Royal Scotsman train services. LVMH owns brands such as Christian Dior, Louis Vuitton, and Bulgari Hotels and Resorts, as well as Cheval Blanc hotels.

In my view, the acquisition makes sense for three main reasons:

First, the hospitality luxury sector grew by four percent and luxury cruises by 14 percent in 2017 (D'Arpizio, Levato, Kamel, & Mongolfier, 2017) and luxury travel is expected to grow further, thanks to generations X and Y, with an increasing number of high-net-worth individuals within these segments willing to spend more on their travel experiences. Therefore, LVMH will be able to capture market share from these fast-growing sectors of the overall luxury industry.

Second, there is a clear trend in the luxury industry towards more experiential rather than pure material purchases. Luxury consumers are demanding more than physical luxury goods, as they want to be immersed in an overall luxury experience. This evolution is observed in many industries and has been referred to as the experience economy (Gilmore & Pine, 2007) but it is even more present in the luxury industry today.

The third reason, based logically on the above trend to seek out the experiential, relates to an increasing desire for authenticity in consumption. From the research literature, the perception of authenticity can emerge from three sources: objective, constructive and existential authenticity (Morhart, Malär, Guèvremont, Girardin, & Grohmann, 2015) but it is the latter source that is particularly relevant for consumption experiences. Existential authenticity refers to feeling true to one's self when living a specific experience. If this phenomenon happens thanks to a brand, the brand will be perceived as more authentic by consumers.

The LVMH group is currently facing some challenges with the authenticity perceptions of its luxury goods brands.

As more and more consumers buy and wear luxury products from a particular brand, that brand is in danger of losing its exclusive image, which is at the heart of the definition of luxury (Kapferer & Bastien, 2012). Moreover, some LVMH-owned brands - such as Louis Vuitton - are being criticized for outsourcing production to countries with low-labor costs while, at the same time, increasing prices for their products. For a fraction of their targeted consumers, these practices tend to decrease their perceived brand authenticity and, as a result, their loyalty towards those brands.

LVMH's acquisition of Belmond represents an opportunity to offer transformative experiences to their customers and increase their authenticity perceptions of - and, in turn, their loyalty towards - other brands in LVMH's portfolio through a positive halo effect.

Accordingly, it would not be surprising to see some of Belmond's activities, such as the Venice Simplon-Orient-Express,renamed or co-branded with a luxury goods brand from the LVMH portfolio. Indeed, Louis Vuitton and its ""Spirit of Travel"" brand positioning would be a perfect fit for an association with the Venice Simplon-Orient-Express.

As brand equity is one of the main assets of a luxury company, increasing brand loyalty is key, particularly among younger consumers as their potential customer-lifetime value is greater than for older generations.

In summary, it should not come as a surprise to see LVMH paying more than three billion dollars to acquire Belmond, as it will help the LVMH group capture a greater share of the potential growth in the hospitality luxury sector, while increasing the perceived authenticity of its brands by offering authentic experiences to younger customers.

First reported by Reuters, as part of the deal, LVMH said it would pay $25 per Belmond share, a 40 percent premium to Thursday’s closing price, and it's expected to close in the first half of 2019, subject to approval from shareholders and regulators.

""This acquisition will significantly increase LVMH's presence in the ultimate hospitality world,"" LVMH CEO Bernard Arnault said in a statement, according to CNN.

The Wall Street Journal says the deal is a good sign that luxury travel is booming after an extended downturn. It adds that the move makes sense for LVMH as it gives them a greater presence in “experiential luxury,” which they feel will help them win over younger consumers who are less likely to buy high-end goods and are more interested in luxury experiences.

LVMH already owns hotels, including Cheval Blanc in the Courchevel ski resort in the French Alps, as well as Bvgalri hotels. It will now add the 46 luxury hotels, restaurants, trains and river cruises in 24 countries that are owned, partly owned or managed by Belmond, including Venice’s Hotel Cipriani, Belmond Sanctuary Lodge in the Machu Picchu citadel, Hotel Splendido in Portofino on the Italian riviera and the Copacabana Palace in Rio de Janeiro.

LVMH, which acquired the Bvlgari hotel group in 2011, agreed to pay $3.2 billion for Belmond.

Belmond is the owner, co-owner or manager of 46 luxury hotels, restaurants, and train- and river-cruise properties. Among its best known hotels is the Belmond Cipriani Hotel in Venice, Italy.

Belmond’s properties also include the only hotel within the Machu Picchu citadel in Peru, the Cococabana Palace in Rio de Janeiro and Hotel Spendido in Portofino, a seaside village in northern Italy.

In a research note, analysts at Berenberg Capital Markets said the LVMH acquisition of Belmond would be “consistent with its long-term strategy focused on offering the consumer a full spectrum of luxury experience.”

LVMH agreed to pay $25 per share for Belmond, or 40 percent more than Belmond’s closing price on Thursday. The acquisition is expected to close in the first half of 2019.

The price LVMH agreed to pay is 22.9 times recent earnings from operations at Belmond, according to analysts at RBC Capital Markets.

LVMH Is Buying Belmond for $3.2 Billion in Luxury Hotel Market Shakeup - Caribbean Journal,"Fri, 14 Dec 2018 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNhcmliam91cm5hbC5jb20vMjAxOC8xMi8xNC9sdm1oLWlzLWJ1eWluZy1iZWxtb25kLWZvci0zLTItYmlsbGlvbi1pbi1sdXh1cnktaG90ZWwtbWFya2V0LXNoYWtldXAv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"By the Caribbean Journal staff

In a move sure to shake up the global luxury hotel market, luxury group LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton has announced an agreement to acquire hotel brand Belmond.

The purchase of Belmond shares represented an equity value of $2.6 billion, in a transaction with an enterprise value of $3.2 billion.

Belmond operates a substantial portfolio of both hotels and luxury travel adventures, with properties in 24 countries.

Belmond is the former Orient-Express Hotels, which was rebranded in 2014.

The company was established more than four decades ago with the acquisition of the Hotel Cipriani in Venice.

That includes Belmond’s already-strong Caribbean presence, with the Belmond La Samanna in St Martin; the Belmond Cap Juluca and the Belmond Maroma on the Caribbean coast of Mexico.

“Belmond delivers unique experiences to discerning travelers and owns a number of exceptional assets in the most desirable destinations. Its heritage, its innovative services, its excellence in execution and its entrepreneurship resonates well with the values of the Group and is complementary to our own Cheval Blanc maisons and the Bvlgari hotels activities. This acquisition will significantly increase LVMH’s presence in the ultimate hospitality world.”

The deal significantly expands what had been a comparatively tiny hotel portfolio for LVMH centered on the “Cheval Blanc” brand — one that includes the Cheval Blanc St Barth Isle de France in St Barth. That property remains shuttered in the wake of Hurricane Irma, though it is now taking bookings for the first week of January, according to its Web site.

In a statement, LVMH said the deal would “significantly increase its presence in the ultimate luxury hotel world.”

“Belmond has a seasoned management team and is an ideal complement to the Cheval Blanc masions, renowned for their exceptional service, architecture and unique gastronomy,” LVMH said in a statement.

“Following a strategic review that attracted broad and deep interest from a wide range of real estate and lodging companies, sovereign wealth institutions and other financial buyers around the world, the Board has concluded that this transaction with LVMH provides compelling and certain value for our shareholders as well as an exciting path forward with a group that appreciates Belmond’s irreplaceable assets and strong management team,” said Chairman of the Board of Directors of Belmond Ltd Roland Hernandez.

LVMH said the seven rail operations ‘provide an outstanding platform to establish the Belmond brand in new markets’ , with ‘best-in-class’ capabilities.

The agreement will see LVMH take over the Belmond brand, formerly known as Orient-Express Hotels, and its global portfolio of hotels, restaurants, trains and river cruises increasing its presence in the luxury hotel world and marking a move into the so-called ‘experiential’ luxury sector.

Tapping into the rising trend that sees consumers buying fewer products and more experiences in areas such as high-end food and wine, luxury hotels and travel, the acquisition will boost LVMH’s existing hotel collection by a further 36 properties.

In addition to its current hotel collection, which comprises the Cheval Blanc hotels in Courchevel, the Maldives, Saint-Barthélemy and Paris and the Bulgari Hotel and Resorts, the Belmond deal will add the Hotel Cipriani in Venice, Le Manoir aux Quat’Saisons in Oxfordshire, Copacabana Palace in Rio de Janeiro and Hotel Splendido in Portofino.

LVMH will also take over the ownership and operation of seven tourist trains including the Venice Simplon-Orient-Express and Belmond Royal Scotsman services as well as two river / canal cruise businesses; Belmond Afloat in France and Belmond Road to Mandalay.

In a statement released by LVMH, Chairman and Chief Executive Bernard Arnault said: ‘Belmond delivers unique experiences to discerning travellers and owns a number of exceptional assets in the most desirable destinations.’

‘We are confident that, as part of LVMH’s world-class family of brands, Belmond’s ability to deliver timeless, one-of-a-kind luxury experiences will reach new levels.’

With an equity value of $2.6 billion, and enterprise value of $3.2 billion, the transaction is LVMH’s largest since purchasing Bvlgari for $4.8 billion in 2011 and $7.3 billion for full control of Christian Dior in 2017.

LVMH will pay $25 per Class-A Belmond share in cash, a 42 percent premium over its closing price in the U.S. on Thursday. The deal represents an equity value of $2.6 billion in a transaction with an enterprise value of $3.2 billion. LVMH's shares fell as much as 3.1 percent early Friday.

The transaction is expected to close in the first half of 2019 subject to the approval of Belmond's shareholders and clearance by the relevant competition authorities.

“Following a strategic review that attracted broad and deep interest from a wide range of real estate and lodging companies, sovereign wealth institutions and other financial buyers around the world, the board has concluded that this transaction with LVMH provides compelling and certain value for our shareholders, as well as an exciting path forward with a group that appreciates Belmond’s irreplaceable assets and strong management team,” said Roland Hernandez, chairman of the board of directors of Belmond Ltd., in a statement.

Luxury Hospitality

Belmond's appeal for a buyer is understandable. In the 12 months ended September 30, Belmond recorded total revenues of $572 million and adjusted EBITDA of $140 million.

“Belmond’s acquisition by LVMH is credit positive as Belmond's luxury assets, including iconic properties such as Hotel Cipriani in Venice and the Copacabana Palace in Rio de Janeiro, will be a good fit in LVMH's luxury-brand portfolio,” said Moody’s lodging analyst Pete Trombetta. “Over the past year, the luxury segment of the lodging industry has outperformed other segments in terms of revenue per available room (RevPAR) as consumers, especially the younger generations, have placed more value on unique experiences over buying goods.”

Belmond was formerly known as Orient-Express hotels, but rebranded in 2014. The company was established more than 40 years ago with the acquisition of Hotel Cipriani in Venice. The company now owns and operates a portfolio of 46 hotel, restaurant, rail and river-cruise experiences in 24 countries. Its lodging portfolio includes Hotel Splendido in Portofino, Copacabana Palace in Rio de Janeiro, Le Manoir aux Quat'Saisons in Oxfordshire, Grand Hotel Europe in St. Petersburg, Maroma Resort & Spa in Mexico, Hotel das Cataratas in the Iguassu National Park in Brazil, and Cap Juluca in Anguilla. It also operates the Venice Simplon-Orient-Express and Belmond Royal Scotsman rail lines, as well as cruises.

While Belmond may have a stronger presence in the overall hospitality sector, LVMH is no neophyte. The company has a hotel-management group that includes properties under the Cheval Blanc name, including the Courchevel ski resort in the French Alps. It also has six hotels open under the Bvlgari brand and is poised to open hotels in Moscow, Paris and Tokyo over the next four years.

But LVMH is best known for its luxury products, including fashion and leather, watches and jewelry, perfumes and cosmetics, wines and spirits and accessories, among others. But luxury goods versus luxury travel may tilt more toward the latter in the near term. As Reuters notes, for example, concerns over the health of China’s economy and potential damage from Washington’s protracted trade spat with Beijing may drive down Chinese demand for high-end items. This acquisition, then, could be seen by observers as a good way for the company to hedge its bets after spending $7 billion last year to take full control of fashion house Christian Dior.

“Belmond delivers unique experiences to discerning travelers and owns a number of exceptional assets in the most-desirable destinations,” said Bernard Arnault, chairman and CEO of LVMH. “Its entrepreneurship resonates well with the values of the Group and is complementary to our own Cheval Blanc maisons and the Bvlgari hotels activities.

Belmond buy signals launch into experiential luxury for LVMH - Campden FB,"Fri, 21 Dec 2018 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNhbXBkZW5mYi5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS9iZWxtb25kLWJ1eS1zaWduYWxzLWxhdW5jaC1leHBlcmllbnRpYWwtbHV4dXJ5LWx2bWjSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LVMH’s $3.2 billion acquisition of luxury hotelier and travel operator Belmond is a major strategic turning point that will open up a whole new market for the world’s largest luxury company, one expert suggests.

LVMH (Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton), owned by the Arnault family, has agreed to buy Belmond as it pushes into ‘experiental’ luxury.

Belmond owns, part-owns or manages of 46 luxury hotel, restaurant, train and river cruise properties including the iconic Hotel Cipriani in Venice and the Orient Express train journey.

“Belmond already had a wealth of existing activities and holds a portfolio of real estate and experience activities that allow LMVH to become a major actor in the luxury experience sector in a very short period of time,” said HEC professor Gachoucha Kretz.

Kretz (pictured right), a marketing strategist with expertise in brand management who previously worked at Arthur Andersen and L’Oreal Paris, said for the family business it means growing the conglomerate into a mightier luxury powerhouse reducing dependence on service providers and partners.

“LVMH is moving forward at a lightning speed into a luxury lifestyle one-stop-shop for luxury consumers and particularly ultra-high net worth individuals.”

Kretz said the French business is standing out from competition in that it does not focus on fashion (like Kering) or watches and jewellery (like Richemont) or does not bolster a branded house like Chanel or Hermès.

“This strategic move makes the group more resilient to crises and global challenges and extends the brand portfolio to an astonishing number of more or less 80 brands across seven business categories and all continents,” she added.

Commenting on the acquisition, LVMH chairman and chief executive Bernard Arnault said that Belmond delivered unique experiences to discerning travellers.

“Its heritage, its innovative services, its excellence in execution and its entrepreneurship resonates well with the values of the [LVMH] Group,” he said.

LVMH was founded in 1987 by Arnault and he has long positioned his heirs in pivotal roles within the group.

Luxury giant LVMH is to extend its investment in the hospitality industry by buying London-based hotel group Belmond in a transaction worth 2.8 billion euros, the French company announced on Friday.

LVMH said it would acquire Belmond for 25.00 dollars per class A share in cash, a premium of 42 percent over their closing value of 17.65 dollars on the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday.

LVMH paid well over Belmond's equity value of 2.6 billion dollars (2.3 billion euros), putting its enterprise value, which includes debt and preferred shares, at 3.2 billion (2.8 billion euros).

""This acquisition will significantly increase LVMH's presence in the ultimate hospitality world,"" company boss Bernard Arnault said. ""Belmond delivers unique experiences to discerning travellers and owns a number of exceptional assets in the most desirable destinations.""

Demanding billionaires

Arnault himself is the world's fourth-richest individual and the Belmond purchase is a bid to please his peers, or ""satisfy the rising class of billionaires who are increasingly demanding"", as analysts Invest Securities put it.

""Across the consumer sector, the move to spending on experiences instead of things is gaining traction,"" comments Andrea Felsted in Bloomberg Opinion. ""Luxury is no different.""

As well as hotels, Belmond specialises in luxury cruises.

It also owns the Venice Simplon-Orient-Express train.

Although it is registered in Bermuda, a well-known tax haven, the company's headquarters in London.

It employs 8,000 people in 24 countries and had a turnover of 572 million dollars (507 million euros) in the year to September.

LVMH currently employs about 1,000 people in the hotels it already owns, which include the Cheval Blanc in the swish French ski resort of Courchevel and the Randheli in the Maldives.

It is planning to open two hotels in central Paris in 2020.

A transaction that marks a significant acceleration of Bernard Arnault's group on a previously confidential segment of its portfolio.

A few weeks ago, MarketScreener discussed the possibility of a return of acquisitions in the luxury sector, to offset a growth rate that should return to normal after a golden decade. The transaction announced this morning by French luxury giant LVMH confirms our sentiment. But the number one in the sector took the market against its will by hitting where it was not expected.



But what does LVMH have to do in the hotel business? Part of the answer is that the group is already there: it operates hotels, via two brands. LVMH's ultra-luxury hotel business is called Cheval-Blanc, with offices in Courchevel, the Maldives, Saint-Barthélémy and soon in Paris (La Samaritaine) and Saint-Tropez (Résidence de la Pinède). Olivier Lefebvre, Managing Director of LVMH Hotel Management, has built up his experience at Starwood, one of the major players in the sector. The group also operates through Bulgari Hotels & Resorts, in partnership (50%) with Marriott. This chain already has establishments in Milan, London, Bali, Beijing, Dubai and Shanghai (523 rooms in total). Establishments in Paris, Moscow and Tokyo are planned by 2020 (a total of 239 rooms).



Six times more hotels with Belmond



But Belmond could mark a turning point. Cheval Blanc is the version of an emblematic internal brand, which is intended to remain in the confidentiality of ultra-luxury. At Bulgari Hotels & Resorts, the Italian brand, a subsidiary of LVMH, contributes its know-how, brand and design, with Marriott providing operational management. Cheval Blanc and Bulgari Hotels & Resorts represent a total of nine very select hotels at the end of 2018.



Belmond means 46 more hotels, trains and river cruises in 24 countries. LVMH will pay $3.2 billion to buy the company listed in New York (including $600 million in debt). Belmond's sales reached $572 million and its Ebitda margin 24.5%. Until 2014, the company was still called Orient-Express Hotels. Among its most emblematic assets are the Cipriani in Venice, the Splendido in Portofino or the Copacabana Palace in Rio de Janeiro.



Belmond locations around the world (Source Slide Belmont - Click to enlarge)



An offer aimed at ""demanding customers"", with ""rare experiences"" and ""emblematic assets"" in ""some of the most exceptional places in the world"": Bernard Arnault is full of praise for Belmond's portfolio, which he considers ""perfectly complementary"" to the Cheval Blanc and Bulgari houses. It should be noted that the brand generally owns or co-owns its hotels, which is a rarity in a sector now dominated by the ""asset light"" strategy (operators rent the walls of hotels).



A new brick in the strategy?



Given the weight of the luxury items sold by LVMH, it is probably premature to imagine that the hotel industry could become a major division. At present, it is already difficult to know the financial performance of the assets concerned. They are included in the ""other activities"" segment of LVMH's accounts, which also include holding company expenses and which therefore show negative revenues of €596 million and losses of €357 million (vs. 2017 revenues of €42.6 billion). These other activities include the media division in France (Les Echos, Investir, Le Parisien-Aujourd'hui en France, Connaissance des Arts, Radio Classique), the La Samaritaine property complex under renovation in Paris and other investments in the Pierre, the Dutch yacht manufacturer Royal Van Lent, the Cova pastry shop in Milan, the Jardin d'Acclimatation in Paris and LVMH Hotel Management. These ""other activities"" employed 4,719 people as of December 31, 2017, but integrated the support functions of the headquarters.



""The interest of the operation must be seen in the light of the advantage that exceptional hotels represent in the prospects of great luxury in general, to satisfy the rising class of billionaires whose requirements are increasing,"" says the research firm Invest Securities, which notes that the market could find the transaction a little expensive given the financial performance posted. Belmond's name change was accompanied by a performance improvement plan that did not really bear fruit. At first glance, Berenberg believes that the transaction has an accretive effect of less than 1% on the group's earnings per share, in other words a drop of water. The rumour of the brand being put up for sale had been circulating for some time. ""While some investors may have some questions about this transaction, which seems a little outside LVMH's core business, I think it is consistent with the group's long-term strategy to offer consumers a whole range of high-end experiences,"" says Zuzanna Pusz, who follows the sector within the German bank.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9997990727424622}",neutral,0.9997990727424622,0
"Zara, Nike, LVMH, and the handful of other brands making nearly all fashion's profits - Quartz","Thu, 06 Dec 2018 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vcXouY29tLzE0ODUxNDEvanVzdC0yMC1mYXNoaW9uLWNvbXBhbmllcy1hcmUtbWFraW5nLWFsbW9zdC1hbGwtb2YtdGhlLWluZHVzdHJ5cy1wcm9maXRz0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The global fashion business is becoming increasingly polarized.

Take a look at the big players in the industry: On one side, you’ll find a handful of brands and retailers that, because of their scale, design, price, business model, or all of the above, generate the great majority of the industry’s profits. On the other side, pretty much everyone else.

This snapshot comes from a report on the state of fashion in 2019, produced by consultancy McKinsey & Company and media outlet The Business of Fashion. McKinsey looked at more than 500 fashion companies—about 300 of which are publicly listed, the rest private but offering enough data that they could be included—spanning geographies, categories, and price segments. Across all those companies, McKinsey calculated that the top 20% made 128% of the total profit in 2017.

How is that possible? Because the bottom 20% lost money, destroying 34% of the profit in the group.

The top 20% is still more than 100 businesses. But when McKinsey looked at just the top 20 companies, it found that they accounted for 97% of the total profit in the group, a share that has increased somewhat steadily for years. The polarization doesn’t appear to be going away either. McKinsey points out that the number of “value-destroying” companies in its set, which is to say those losing money, nearly doubled between 2010 and 2017.

There are some clear themes among the companies that are succeeding—what McKinsey dubs the super winners, including fast-fashion brands such as Inditex (parent company of Zara) and H&M, sports labels Nike and Adidas, and the luxury conglomerates LVMH and Richemont. Their sales weren’t always exceptionally high compared to the wider sample, but they had better margins and were far more efficient with their capital. They also enjoyed a big advantage from their scale.

Twelve of the companies listed have consistently been in the top 20 since 2008. “The most resilient winners included luxury, sportswear, and fast-fashion players, reinforcing the point that brand investment and operational efficiency are key drivers of sustainable business models,” McKinsey noted. Operational efficiency is a Zara hallmark, for example, while companies such as Nike and Kering, which owns fashion houses including Gucci and Balenciaga, have been remarkable brand builders.

The list also points to another form of polarization in fashion: High-end brands and those focused on value—companies that differentiate themselves on price—are thriving, while the middle is getting squeezed. That’s how you get businesses such as H&M and TJX Companies, owner of TJ Maxx and Marshalls, ranking alongside luxury powerhouses like LVMH, Hermès, and Richemont. It’s another trend that doesn’t appear to be going away anytime soon.

Of course, these aren’t the only companies making money in fashion. There are plenty of small labels generating modest incomes, and businesses that may be selling well but aren’t as efficient. When considering the large companies that dominate the global fashion business, though, these are the names that stand out.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.6547222137451172}",neutral,0.6547222137451172,0

The deal, which Wall Street said underscores the growth of the luxury travel market, closed for $3.2 billion.

“Through this acquisition, LVMH will significantly increase its presence in the ultimate luxury hotel world. Synonymous with history, heritage and timeless experiences, Belmond has a seasoned management team and is an ideal complement to the Cheval Blanc maisons, renowned for their exceptional service, architecture and unique gastronomy,” the company said.

Anti-Corruption Group Accuses Louis Vuitton Foundation of Fraud and Tax Evasion - Artsy,"Mon, 03 Dec 2018 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFydHN5Lm5ldC9hcnRpY2xlL2FydHN5LWVkaXRvcmlhbC1hbnRpLWNvcnJ1cHRpb24tZ3JvdXAtYWNjdXNlZC1sb3Vpcy12dWl0dG9uLWZvdW5kYXRpb24tZnJhdWQtdGF4LWV2YXNpb27SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Art Market

A French anti-corruption group has filed a complaint in high court in Paris accusing the Louis Vuitton Foundation of committing fraud and tax evasion in the construction of its Frank Gehry-designed contemporary art museum, which opened in 2014. The organization, Front Républicain d'Intervention Contre la Corruption (the Republican Front for Intervention Against Corruption, or FRICC), claims that the nonprofit branch of the luxury conglomerate LVMH was able to deduct some 60% of the cost of the museum from its taxes, and request tax refunds on some other costs. In all, FRICC claims that LVMH and the Louis Vuitton Foundation received nearly €603 million ($682 million) from the state toward the nearly €790 million ($894 million) construction costs of the museum. The actual cost of the museum, initially projected to be €100 million, was revealed last year to be closer to eight times that sum in a report by French magazine Marianne.

A spokesperson for the Louis Vuitton Foundation dismissed the complaint as having “as its sole goal to harm the reputation of the Louis Vuitton Foundation and the group LVMH,” according to Le Figaro. The spokesperson added that LVMH is planning legal action against FRICC for slander and will be seeking damages. The billionaire chairman and CEO of LVMH, Bernard Arnault, is a powerful art collector and currently the fourth-richest person in the world.

The accusations leveled by FRICC, which filed its complaint on November 15, coincide with a report in France’s audit court on the finances of the LVMH group and its members. The findings of that report, released last week, showed that the LVMH group’s taxes were slashed by €518.1 million ($586.3 million) between 2007 and 2017, accounting for 8.1% of the French state’s corporate patronage for that 10-year period.

“I hope that public authorities will seize upon the problems raised by the complaint and carry out a real evaluation of corporate patronage,” Joseph Breham, an attorney for FRICC, told the AFP.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9910481572151184}",neutral,0.9910481572151184,0

By edhat staff

Global French luxury brand LVMH is purchasing the upscale Belmond hotel company which includes the El Encanto on Santa Barbara’s Riviera.

LVMH, who also owns the Louis Vuitton, Moët, and Hennessy brands, will pay $2.6 billion for the Belmond company which owns 46 luxury hotel, restaurant, train, and river cruise properties.

In the twelve months ended September 30, 2018, Belmond recorded total revenues of $572 million. The transaction is expected to complete in the first half of 2019 subject to the approval of Belmond’s shareholders and clearance by the relevant competition authorities, according to a joint press release.

Roland Hernandez, Chairman of the Board of Directors of Belmond Ltd, commented: “Following a strategic review that attracted broad and deep interest from a wide range of real estate and lodging companies, sovereign wealth institutions and other financial buyers around the world, the Board has concluded that this transaction with LVMH provides compelling and certain value for our shareholders as well as an exciting path forward with a group that appreciates Belmond’s irreplaceable assets and strong management team.”

Belmond, formerly known as Orient Express, announced in August it was putting itself up for sale. They previously took seven years to renovate and reconstruct the El Encanto property and reopened it in 2013.

With a deep history in Santa Barbara, the property was established in the early 1900s with an official opening on February 2, 1918. El Encanto Hotel and Garden Villas quickly became popular with Hollywood’s elite and politicians. President Franklin D. Roosevelt enjoyed a stay as did Clark Gable, Carole Lombard, and John Kennedy, Jr.

LVMH previously stated it was looking to expand into luxury experiences as a way to introduce younger consumers to its established goods brands. The company also owns Bulgari hotels and the Cheval Blanc luxury resort properties.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999287128448486}",neutral,0.9999287128448486,0

Rodeo Drive continues to rank as the most expensive commercial real estate in Los Angeles County.

That was reinforced with the recent sale of the former Brooks Brothers flagship at 468 N. Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills, which went for $245 million. Brooks Brothers opened a new flagship in November at the recently remodeled Beverly Center.

The original asking price for the former Brooks Brothers site was $300 million. The structure was up for sale by the trust of the family of Margaret J. Anderson, who built the pink stucco Beverly Hills Hotel in 1912.

Even though no public announcement of the sale was made, documents show that a group named 468 N. Rodeo Drive LLC acquired the 22,251-square-foot two-story building in September for a price that came out to $11,010 per square foot. According to sources, luxury conglomerate LVMH, which declined to comment on the deal, is reportedly behind the transaction.

Jay Luchs, vice chairman of Newmark Knight Frank, handled the listing but declined to comment about the transaction.

LVMH, or Moët Hennessey Louis Vuitton, already has a strong presence on Rodeo Drive. It owns or leases more than eight buildings on the three-block luxury-retail street. A majority of its fashion brands, including Louis Vuitton, Dior, Celine, Givenchy, Fendi and Rimowa, have flagships on the street.

The purchase of the building might be the latest LVMH move to increase its holdings on the street, which has been a center for high-end shopping for more than 40 years.

On March 28, it was announced that LVMH spent $110 million on a 6,200-square-foot building at 456 N. Rodeo Drive. A construction barricade bearing the name Celine currently covers the exterior of the property.

In August 2016, LVMH paid $122 million for the House of Bijan building at 420 N. Rodeo Drive, a purchase considered to be one of the most expensive on the street. That purchase price came out to $19,405 per square foot, which beat out Chanel’s 2015 purchase of a Rodeo Drive store for $13,217 per square foot.

While the sale of 468 N. Rodeo Drive did not break any records, Andrew Turf, senior vice president of high-street retail services at CBRE, said the former Brooks Brothers building sale was substantial in an area where store leases cost about $50 to $75 per square foot per month.

However, Rodeo is worth every penny, Turf said. It’s one of the top-five retail streets in North America. It’s important to have a presence on the street. In the long run, owning a building is financially wiser than leasing the space, he said.

While no plans have been officially announced for the former Brooks Brothers store, Turf said that the space may not necessarily house a flagship store, which is what has dominated Rodeo Drive for more than 35 years.

“It’s a fantastic street,” Turf said. “But it’s missing a strong, cooler, younger restaurant and hotel. Younger people across the globe are driving the commerce for these brands. Rodeo Drive should have hospitality elements that match the consumer. That is the one weakness of Rodeo Drive.”

Right now, there are two hotels on the street, the Luxe Rodeo Drive Hotel and the Beverly Wilshire, on the corner of Wilshire Boulevard and Rodeo Drive.

For 13 years, Nicole Pollard Bayme has led private shopping tours of Rodeo Drive’s flagships for her company, LaLaLuxe. She begins her tours, which start at $1,200 per person, at the Beverly Wilshire. People taking the tours range from Persian Gulf oil princesses to Sweet 16 parties, who receive the tours as gifts. The tours run at least once a week because interest in Rodeo Drive never seems to wane, Pollard Bayme said.

“It’s the hub of luxury shopping in Los Angeles,” she said. “The flagship stores on Rodeo Drive often rival flagships on Fifth Avenue in New York and Avenue Montaigne in Paris.”

The flagships attract so much attention because of their store windows, and the interiors are a feast for the eyes, Pollard Bayme said. “The luxury brands cultivate clients because they have amazing craftsmanship and because they are storytellers. It’s how you fall in love with their concept. It’s why you feel okay dropping so much money on a piece,” she said.

Rodeo Drive has something for almost everyone, she added. One could spend as little as $36 on a paperback guide to Los Angeles from Louis Vuitton or on a small bottle of nail polish, but jewelry on the street can cost millions of dollars.

Since 2017, the city of Beverly Hills has been running a campaign to make Rodeo Drive more of a place to hang out. The city’s BOLD program, or Beverly Hills Open Later Days, produces musical performances and street backdrops against which to take social-media pictures. Running until Dec. 22, it calls for retailers to stay open until 8 p.m. instead of closing earlier as stores do when it is not the holiday season.

The value of flagships on Rodeo Drive has long been debated. In an interview earlier this year with the California Apparel News, Marshal Cohen, chief industry analyst for The NPD Group, said that flagship stores on high-end shopping streets are geared to be big billboards for brands.

Tyler Higgins, a director of the global consultancy AArete based in Chicago, said that flagships don’t pay their rents through volume business. They sell expensive items to people who can afford to pay vast sums, he said.

The anchors on Rodeo Drive have remained the same year after year, said Kathy Gohari, president of the Rodeo Drive Committee, a merchants group. These anchors are dominated by European fashion houses such as Prada, Cartier, Bally, Burberry and the LVMH brands.

However, the street’s merchants make a point of consistently doing something new. Next year, some of the Rodeo Drive flagships will undergo major remodels, Gohari said.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999983310699463}",neutral,0.9999983310699463,0
"In China, women winemakers are the toast of the nation - Post Magazine","Sun, 23 Dec 2018 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjbXAuY29tL21hZ2F6aW5lcy9wb3N0LW1hZ2F6aW5lL2xvbmctcmVhZHMvYXJ0aWNsZS8yMTc5MjU2L3dvbWVuLWxlYWRpbmctY2hpbmFzLXdpbmVtYWtpbmctcmV2b2x1dGlvbtIBcmh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLnNjbXAuY29tL21hZ2F6aW5lcy9wb3N0LW1hZ2F6aW5lL2xvbmctcmVhZHMvYXJ0aWNsZS8yMTc5MjU2L3dvbWVuLWxlYWRpbmctY2hpbmFzLXdpbmVtYWtpbmctcmV2b2x1dGlvbg?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Admiring the orderly vines stretching towards majestic peaks, almost as far as the eye can see, it is difficult to believe that, just 20 years ago, this enchanting part of northwestern China was little more than a forlorn stretch of sand inhabited by a scattering of subsistence farmers.

It is harvest time, the most important part of the year here on the edge of the Gobi desert.

The morning sun is high in a translucent sky and a gentle breeze sweeps the plains on the outskirts of Yinchuan, capital of the Ningxia Hui auto­nomous region. As the mist slowly evaporates to reveal the rugged Helan Mountains, scores of women begin to fill the surrounding vineyards. Dressed in jeans, light jumpers and colourful headscarves, they crouch along rows of vines, collecting ripe grapes in green plastic boxes.

“When I was a kid, I used to dig holes in the desert. I would hide there and play with my friends,” recalls 41-year-old Ren Yanling, sitting in her laboratory during a rare break.

Energetic and hardworking, Ren was born in the village of Yuquanying, close to the Helan Mountain winery. Now chief winemaker for the operation, which is owned by French multinational Pernod Ricard, her parents were growing grapes back in the 1990s. “When I was 15, I would sneak out to have a sip of our family wine,” she says, laughing. “My parents didn’t allow me to drink, but I really enjoyed it.”

Zhou Shuzhen has been involved in the Chinese wine industry since the 1980s, when the first facilities opened.

Ren is just one of a number of women winery owners, managers and winemakers leading China’s oenological revolution. Some are young, others have been in the business for decades, perfecting their skills in historical Bordeaux wineries and partnering with top international brands. In Ningxia, their eye for detail and quality have been instrumental in the industry’s boom.

“Women have an innate maternal instinct. Making wine is like taking care of a baby,” says 56-year-old Zhou Shuzhen, who was among the first winemakers in the region and now works for several estates, including the award-winning Kanaan winery. “You have to be patient and present at all stages. These are characteristics all women have,” she adds.

Thanks in part to their vision and commitment, what was once an impoverished rural province has become wine­making’s new frontier. Ningxia now has more than 40,000 hectares under vine and about 200 wineries, most of which are boutique estates focused on quality vintages with production of fewer than 100,000 bottles per year. Ningxia’s wines have won several international competitions and are now available in restaurants, hotels and shops worldwide.

Early forays into winemaking, however, did not appear promising.

East Wine Cellar, a Beijing restaurant with a cellar housing more than 10,000 bottles of top international and Chinese wines.

Although wine has been produced in China for millennia, the nation’s modern relationship with the drink developed during the 1980s and 90s, when the government decided to discourage the consump­tion of baijiu, the traditional, grain-based liquor that was swallowing up thousands of tonnes of the foodstuff in its production. State officials began praising the health benefits of wine while agrarians travelled to Europe to acquaint themselves with the product.

“At the time, China was producing a blend of grape juice, sweetener and alcohol. It wasn’t exactly wine,” says Zhou, a former Chinese literature teacher at an adult institute in Ningxia who, in 1983, was one of nine people selected for a winemaking course in the city of Changli, Hebei province. There, she took part in one of the first vinification experiments in modern China.

“It was a dry red wine. We were using some local grape varieties but we were not very familiar with fermentation. The result was a very alcoholic and harsh wine. The colour was very dark but it didn’t have much flavour.”

The wine was presented to a local government official, who deemed it disgusting, comparing it to soy sauce.

Despite this and other setbacks, a fledgling industry was born. In Ningxia, land was reclaimed from the desert, grapes were imported from Europe and the nearby Yellow River was employed to provide irrigation. Wine producers were granted discounted land leases and started hiring foreign consultants, while govern­ment scholarships were offered for oenology studies and inter­national competitions were hosted. These efforts slowly began to pay off: by 2007, wine was Ningxia’s second biggest industry, after coal.

China has several wine-producing regions, with Ningxia considered the best, due to its sandy, dry terroir, high altitude, long hours of sunshine and low levels of precipitation, which reduces the need for pesticides. About 90 per cent of production focuses on red wines, with cabernet sauvignon the most popular variety (others include merlot, marselan, Malbec, shiraz, pinot noir and, for white wine, chardonnay and Italian riesling). With vines being less than two decades old, what Ningxia wines lack in complexity and structure is compensated for by their fruitiness, freshness and minerality.

Some Ningxia wineries have at their heart grandiose chateaux built in the classical French style, others are relatively basic, in many cases opened by aficionados with limited means but a serious passion for wine. Among the latter is the Helan Qingxue winery, hosted in an anonymous two-storey building, the terrace of which offers spectacular mountain views.

Seasonal workers harvest Helan Qingxue grapes.

The winery was opened in 2005 by two industry veterans and a talented young winemaker. Eight years later, its 2009 Grand Reserve won an international trophy at the Decanter World Wine Awards.

“Ours is a small boutique winery. Even if it is not run by a family, it feels like one,” says Zhang Jing, the vineyard’s 41-year-old wine­maker and main architect of its success. “Everyone loves and supports each other because we share the same dream.”

Petite, passionate about wine and prone to contagious laughter, Zhang’s chosen career requires personal sacrifice, especially during harvest time, when she must spend weeks away from her husband and nine-year-old daughter. “I get a lot of support from my family during this time,” she says, with a grateful smile. “My daughter understands, even if she misses me a lot.”

Zhang’s first contact with wine came in 1998, when she found a job at a Ningxia wine association after graduating in agriculture from Ningxia University, in Yinchuan. “I was meeting a lot of experts from China and abroad, and I loved it straight away,” she says. “I was fascinated by their tasting abilities and the way they could detect different flavours. How could they pick all those characteristics by just smelling wine?”

Zhang Jing (right), co-founder and winemaker at Helan Qingxue winery, tastes the newly harvested grape juices.

Zhang’s philosophy of picking only the best grapes and focusing on small but high-quality production is central to Helan Qingxue’s approach. The winery produces barely 60,000 bottles a year but its output is constantly ranked among Ningxia’s finest.

“We have room for improvement as the vines get older and the flavour gets better,” says the winemaker. “Each year, I am more experienced and confident, and that is reflected in my wine.”

Weather conditions can make the production of wine in Ningxia challenging. With temperatures falling as low as minus 30 degrees Celsius, vines have to be buried in winter and dug up in spring. It is a costly and risky process that destroys 3 to 5 per cent of the plants each year.

Almost all of the equipment – from grape-sorting and pressing machines to bottling lines, barrels and even corks – is imported from Europe, at great cost. Labour, too, is expensive, especially during harvest time, when all the wineries require pickers simultaneously.

Ningxia wine is good but difficult to promote. We are very young and we need time to learn how to do things properly. It took Europe hundreds of years to understand how to produce and market good wine Sun Qiuxia

This means that Ningxia’s best wines can cost thousands of yuan per bottle – more than their European counterparts – and several wineries struggle with sales.

“Ningxia wine is good but difficult to promote,” says 39-year-old Sun Qiuxia, manager of a newly opened wine cellar in Yinchuan. “We are very young and we need time to learn how to do things properly. It took Europe hundreds of years to understand how to produce and market good wine.”

Despite these difficulties, Ningxia has attracted inter­national heavyweights, including French luxury conglo­mer­ate LVMH (owner of Moët & Chandon), as well as local investors such as Midea, one of China’s biggest manufac­turers of electric appliances. Lily Zhang, 47-year-old owner of Copower Jade, a state-of-the-art chateau that opened in September, is among those who have joined the party.

Both wine lovers, Lily Zhang and her husband originally set out to buy a chateau in France, but were persuaded to invest in Ningxia by Hao Linhai, chairman of the Ningxia International Federation of Vine and Wine of Helan Mountain’s East Foothill of China. Lily Zhang recently relocated from Hong Kong to Yinchuan to promote her wine, and Copower Jade (which cost almost 150 million yuan/US$22 million to build) won this year’s Revue du Vin China winery design award.

“The first thing we want to focus on is grape growing,” says Lily Zhang, at the chateau’s opening. “We have 11 varieties and we want to make sure all of them perform well. We are not worried about the quality of our wine but about the Chinese consumers. Many don’t know Ningxia and still think our country cannot produce good wine.”

While China is already the sixth-largest producer and the fifth-largest consumer of wine worldwide, its average per capita consumption is only 1.7 bottles per year, with baijiu and beer remaining the country’s favourite tipples. Ningxia’s boutique wines are slowly making their way to Shanghai, Guangzhou and Hong Kong, but most mainland palates are still not accustomed to the drink.

“Promoting our wines involves a lot of tastings, dinners and word of mouth,” says Gao Yuan, the 41-year-old co-owner of Silver Heights, one of Ningxia’s most famous vineyards. Gao, who studied oenology and interned in Bordeaux wineries, started producing wine in 2007, on a one-hectare property bought with her mother’s life savings. She managed to fill just 3,000 bottles, but the wine was so good that the distribution company she was working for suggested she leave to become a producer full time. Today, Silver Heights sells to leading hotels and restaurants in mainland China, France, Japan, Canada and Hong Kong, where it can be found on Hotel Icon’s wine list.

As night prepares to fall on enchanting Ningxia, workers return to their wineries carrying the plastic boxes filled with precious fruit. The grapes will immediately be sorted, pressed and the juice put into steel tanks, to begin fermenting. For winemaker Zhou, it is an exercise in patience and a way of life. “Every time I taste wine from a different barrel, I am surprised by the way it keeps changing and evolving,” she says. “Wine­making involves endless research. You cannot be conservative, you need to be creative and innovative.”

Although Zhou believes Ningxia wines do not yet match the quality of their French, Italian or New World counter­parts, she is convinced – as are her fellow female winemakers – that the region has what it takes to compete internationally.

“I feel privileged and proud to witness the stage this industry has reached,” Zhou says, smiling. “More and more Chinese winemakers are touring the world and learning new techniques, which help us improve.

“We still have a long way to go, but I am very confident in our future.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9996050000190735}",neutral,0.9996050000190735,0

Belmond La Samanna, the leading luxury resort in St Martin, is back on the scene.

Following a restyle, the resort reopened its doors this week, just as Belmond was acquired by global luxury giant LVMH.

The resort had been shuttered since Hurricane Irma last year.

The resort’s 83 rooms and public spaces, have been given a refresh by interior design firm MuzaLab, London.

Pastel blues, greens, pinks and peaches are inspired by the natural tones of the Caribbean Sea, and shells and corals and are used to complement botanical prints on fabrics, artworks, lighting and mirrors.

As guests explore the newly refreshed Baie Longue Bar, L’Oursin restaurant and main building, these color palettes aim to evoke a sense of place and allude to French romance.

elmond La Samanna has also reopened its beachfront French restaurant, Trellis – now named L’Oursin – where chefs serve up food with European finesse.

The resort’s La Cave Wine Cellar is one of the largest private wine cellars in the Caribbean.

The definitive agreement comes following the engagement of Goldman Sachs and J.P. Morgan Securities as financial advisors by Belmond shareholders in August. The sale of the company was designed as part of a full company review and restructure and will see the company acquired for USD$25 (AUD$34.82) per share, which will be paid in cash to shareholders.

Belmond’s move to sell and go private comes as part of the company review, set up to stimulate market activity for the company and improve value for shareholders.

In addition to its namesake Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton brands, LVMH also owns and operates global household names such as Dom Pérignon, Veuve Clicquot Ponsardin among its fine champagne brands and fashion labels such as Christian Dior Couture, Givenchy, Emilio Pucci, Marc Jacobs and Sephora. Timepiece manufacturers including TAG Heuer and Hublot also fall under its umbrella.

Meet the 25-Year-Old Canadian Jewellery Designer Who Just Won China's Equivalent of the LVMH Prize - fashionmagazine.com,"Thu, 20 Dec 2018 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vZmFzaGlvbm1hZ2F6aW5lLmNvbS9zdHlsZS9jaGluZXNlLWNhbmFkaWFuLWpld2VsbGVyeS1kZXNpZ25lci1lbWlseS1nYW8v0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Photography Courtesy of Emily Gao

Meet the 25-Year-Old Canadian Jewellery Designer Who Just Won China’s Equivalent of the LVMH Prize

Emily Gao considers herself an engineer as much as a jewellery designer.

The 25-year-old Torontonian behind the accessories line JY Gao harnesses everyday kinetic energy to create jewellery with independent moving parts that swing, dangle, and oscillates when activated by the movement of the wearer. “It’s partly engineering because you envision something to look great, but when you actually test it out on the human body, it might not have the same effect,” Gao says of the trial-and-error process. She often prototypes her designs using inexpensive materials such as hinges from hardwares stores before rendering the finished product using sterling silver. (If the term ‘kinetic jewellery’ sounds unfamiliar that’s because “its something I sort of invented,” she says.)

GIF

Currently, JY Gao is an under-the-radar accessories label founded in 2016 (a pair of the label’s earrings appeared in a shoot in the October 2018 issue of FASHION), but it may not stay that way for long, since Gao received a massive cash infusion after winning second place in China’s largest design competition, which awards cash prizes in excess of $1 million. (In comparison, the prestigious LVMH Prize gives out one 300,000-euro and one 150,000-euro prize each year.)

The competition, Creative Tianfu, is part of a government economic initiative to boost tourism to Chengdu, which suffered a lapse after a devastating earthquake in 2008. Entrants are tasked with designing souvenirs that help boost Chengdu’s reputation as a hub for art and fashion in addition to its status as the home of panda bears and Sichuan cuisine.

Gao designed four pairs of delicate earrings that fuse traditional Chinese embroidery with her signature geometric designs. Inspired by Chengdu’s changing seasons, the Spring Dew earrings resemble the tiny water droplets once praised by beloved local poet Du Fu, the Summer Hibiscus earrings depict the official flower of Chengdu in full bloom, the Fall Gingko earrings interpret the changing leaves of fall, and the Wintersweet earrings portray their namesake ornamental flower, which is native to China.

Her designs nabbed Gao second place in the competition, which netted her a cash prize of $80,000. Two first prize winners receive a total of $250,000 each, a second prize of $80,000 is awarded to four winners, and a whopping fourteen individuals receive a third prize of $20,000 each. The high number of winning designers may seem unusual, but it makes sense considering over 1000 people apply to Creative Tianfu each year.

Gao first heard about the competition after a representative reached out to her after a story on her label was posted on a WeChat group for Chinese-Canadian female entrepreneurs. “I had to double check the facts, I thought it was too good to be true,” say Gao. “Then I checked the Chinese media and they all reported on this competition being in its first year.”

Her minimalist, geometric designs possess an air of quirkiness. Gao says she draws equally from Western and Eastern aesthetics to come up with her ideas. For example, a pair of spiky chandelier drop earrings that resemble a maple leaf could also be interpreted as a lotus flower. Another pair of earrings with the ability to transform from a 2D square to 3D cube have drawn comparisons to Chinese lanterns.

Growing up, Gao possessed an artistic spirit and her favourite television show as a child was Art Attack. “I’d make everything along with [host Neil Buchanan] and there was tons of papier-mâché lying around the house,” she quips. But as part of a traditional Chinese family, she was encouraged to enter a stable, lucrative profession like accounting or medicine, and it took a lot of courage for Gao to break out of this prescribed cultural role. She earned a business degree at the University of Toronto’s Rotman School of Management and shortly after graduation began working for Bell doing analytics and project management.

But her creative side never left. She began to take up artistic hobbies outside work, including sewing classes at George Brown College, where she heard about a fashion entrepreneurship boot camp called Fashion Your Future, run by Toronto Fashion Incubator. Gao enrolled and ended up discovering her intense passion for jewellery design. After the boot camp ended, she decided to quit her full-time job to launch JY Gao.

Still, her parents were nervous about her new career choice. “When I first told my mom [I was quitting my job] I said, ‘I will be very logical about this and I will always find a way to feed myself, no matter what is happening,’” she says. Gao tends to approach her business with the know-how of a former commerce student, speaking in terms of investment yields and long-term gains. She also continues to take on consulting work at Bell on part-time basis and uses the money to invest back into her line. She plans to use the funds from the design competition to expand JY Gao’s online presence, funnelling the money towards digital marketing and getting her products in the hands of influencers.

Though her family was initially reluctant about Gao’s decision to become a designer, her big win at the competition has chastened them somewhat. “On the day of my presentation, [my mom] was just beaming from ear to ear. She was so happy, and I’ve never seen her more proud,” says Gao. “That was a really emotional moment for me. I felt she had really accepted and embraced that side of me.”

With her enchantingly unique designs and boundless enthusiasm, we have no doubt that side of her has a bright future ahead.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999901056289673}",neutral,0.9999901056289673,0
LVMH adds to luxury travel arm with £2.5bn buyout of Belmond - Jersey Evening Post,"Fri, 14 Dec 2018 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vamVyc2V5ZXZlbmluZ3Bvc3QuY29tL21vcmVuZXdzL3VrbmV3cy8yMDE4LzEyLzE0L2x2bWgtYWRkcy10by1sdXh1cnktdHJhdmVsLWFybS13aXRoLTItNWJuLWJ1eW91dC1vZi1iZWxtb25kL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Louis Vuitton owner LVMH is to buy luxury hotel and travel company Belmond for 3.2 billion US dollars (£2.54 billion), concluding a sales process that attracted interest from a range of high-profile bidders.

Belmond said it had received “broad and deep interest” from several potential buyers after it announced a strategic review in August.

The group runs a global portfolio of hotels, cruises, safaris and trains. In the UK this includes Raymond Blanc’s Oxfordshire hotel and restaurant Le Manoir and luxury train services British Pullman and Royal Scotsman.

Roland Hernandez, chairman of the board of directors of Belmond, said: “Following a strategic review that attracted broad and deep interest from a wide range of real estate and lodging companies, sovereign wealth institutions and other financial buyers around the world, the board has concluded that this transaction with LVMH provides compelling and certain value for our shareholders as well as an exciting path forward with a group that appreciates Belmond’s irreplaceable assets and strong management team.”

LVMH, the conglomerate which owns high-end fashion, champagne and cosmetics brands, said the acquisition would increase its presence in the luxury hotel world.

Bernard Arnault, chairman and chief executive of LVMH, said Belmond’s assets would be complementary to its existing hospitality holdings.

“Belmond delivers unique experiences to discerning travellers and owns a number of exceptional assets in the most desirable destinations,” he said.

“Its heritage, its innovative services, its excellence in execution and its entrepreneurship resonates well with the values of the group and is complementary to our own Cheval Blanc Maisons and the Bvlgari hotels activities.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.7769293785095215}",neutral,0.7769293785095215,0
