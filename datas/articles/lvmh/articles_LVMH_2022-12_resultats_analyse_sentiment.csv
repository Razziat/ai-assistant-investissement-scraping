Meet Bernard Arnault's five children vying for the LVMH empire - Fortune,"Wed, 07 Dec 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vZm9ydHVuZS5jb20vZXVyb3BlLzIwMjIvMTIvMDcvYmVybmFyZC1hcm5hdWx0LXdvcmxkcy1yaWNoZXN0LW1hbi01LWNoaWxkcmVuLWx2bWgtcmVhbC1saWZlLXN1Y2Nlc3Npb24tYmlsbGlvbmFpcmUv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LVMH chief executive Bernard Arnault, who may now be the world’s richest man, according to Forbes, is said to be deciding which of his five children will take over the empire.

The company recently moved to raise its age limit for a chief executive officer so Arnault can stay on.

Arnault has run the luxury conglomerate for decades. His net worth is estimated at $184.7 billion. LVMH includes fashion brands Louis Vuitton and Christian Dior, champagne producer Moët & Chandon, and watch company TAG Heuer.

The CEO could use this time to think about which one of his children will take over, Fortune reported in March, soon after Arnault’s 73rd birthday. The aging patriarch and his five children vying for power closely mirror HBO’s series Succession.

Meet Arnault’s five talented children who could one day run LVMH.

Delphine Arnault

The French businesswoman is 47 and the VP of Louis Vuitton. She attended the EDHEC Business School in Lille and the London School of Economics.

She began her career at McKinsey in Paris, where she worked as a consultant for two years and learned strategy, according to the Financial Times. She acquired experience in the fashion industry while working at designer John Galliano’s company in 2000, helping develop the brand.

Between 2001 and 2013, she started working in the shoe department at Christian Dior and rose to deputy managing director for the executive committee. During this time, she oversaw one of the label’s most successful periods, steering the growth of leather goods, accessories, and communication strategies.

Since then, she has become executive vice president of Louis Vuitton and is in charge of supervising the brand’s product-related activities. She follows a calm management style and tends to visit stores when they are at their busiest.

The successful businesswoman also sits on boards such as Château Cheval Blanc, The Saint-Emilion Premier Grand Cru, Les Echos, Loewe, Pucci’s, Celine, Christian Dior, 21st Century Fox, and Repossi. Since 2009, she has been a member of the supervisory board of M6, and in 2013 she joined the supervisory board of Havas.

Delphine is also a supporter of the LVMH Prize, which allows young fashion designers to be coached by LVMH professionals. In 2014, she was also named one of Fortune’s 40 under 40.

Antoine Arnault

Antoine, 45, is the head of communications and image at LVMH. He is also the chairman of Loro Piana and chief executive of Berluti. The oldest son got his first chief executive role at Berluti, transforming the luxury shoemaker into a menswear label.

In 2002, when Arnault was 25, he cofounded an internet startup and started working in LVMH’s marketing team. He then got his MBA from Insead and, in 2005, rejoined LVMH in the advertising department.

Two years later, he was made director of communications at Louis Vuitton. Under this role, he launched the “core values” campaigns, which featured international figures like Muhammad Ali, Angelina Jolie, Mikhail Gorbachev, and Bono.

In 2011, he launched Les Journées Particulières, in which members of the public were invited to visit the LVMH ateliers and witness the craftsmanship. This festival takes place across 14 countries and encourages LVMH brands to open their doors to the public. He was appointed chairman of Loro Piana two years later, after his father purchased 80% of the cashmere retailer.

In 2018, he took on his current role at LVMH and was tasked with managing the iconic fashion house’s image. A year later, after a personal friend bought Laperouse, a historic Parisian restaurant, Arnault took a minority stake.

Like his sister Delphine and his father, he sits on the board of LVMH. According to the Wall Street Journal, he is married to Natalia Vodianova, a Russian model, and is passionate about golf.

Alexandre Arnault

At 30, Alexandre is fluent in French, English, and German, and the VP at Tiffany.

He graduated from Telecom ParisTech and got a master’s in innovation from École Polytechnique. His digital experience has helped the fashion conglomerate launch 24 Sevres, its e-commerce platform.

In 2017, he was appointed to lead the luxury luggage bag maker Rimowa after LVMH announced that it would acquire an 80% stake in the company. This acquisition was a key move as Rimowa was the last luxury luggage brand left on the market after Samsonite acquired Tumi. The brand influenced LVMH’s digital strategy and collaborations with Supreme, Off-White, and Fendi.

In 2019, he took over his father’s seat on the board of directors at Carrefour, the French supermarket chain. Finally, last year he became executive vice president of product and communications at Tiffany & Co.

In that role, Alexandre has already started shaking things up with his contemporary and modern approach. According to the Wall Street Journal, CEO Anthony Ledru described him as 40% analysis and 60% gut feeling, a go-getter that made things happen sooner rather than later. Thanks to him, Jay-Z and Beyoncé agreed to do the “About Love” campaign for the jewelry company, which featured a Tiffany-blue Basquiat painting.

In 2021, he married Géraldine Guyot, a young designer. The union was first celebrated in Paris and then in Venice. A grand ceremony was held and attended by Roger Federer, Pharrell Williams, the Carters, and Kanye West, who also performed.

Frédéric Arnault

Frédéric, 27, is the chief executive at TAG Heuer, a luxury watch brand. He studied at the École Polytechnique and ran a mobile payment startup with a friend, which they later sold to BNP. He then joined TAG Heuer full-time as the director of strategy and digital.

When Frédéric was 25, he was named CEO of TAG Heuer, making him the second-youngest Arnault to obtain that position after his brother Alexandre. While he puts a lot of focus into connected watches, which now constitutes 15% of all sales, his main focus is e-commerce, which grew 329% in 2020. It was also thanks to him that TAG Heuer got a key partnership with Porsche.

In 2020 he entered the spotlight after he partnered with Ryan Gosling after taking the reins of TAG Heuer. In the beginning, the partnership seemed unusual because the actor had no social media presence and had never endorsed a product before. However, Frédéric saw an opportunity and finally signed a two-year deal with Gosling after a year and a half of negotiations.

Last year, it reported revenues of $7.1 billion from its watch and jewelry sector in the third quarter.

The young businessman’s history with TAG Heuer dates back to when he was 11 and received a TAG Heuer Aquaracer from his father. In 1999 his father bought the brand, and it has become the most significant watch brand in LVMH’s portfolio.

Frédéric is also a man of many talents and plays the piano and tennis, and is fluent in English, Italian, and German.

Jean Arnault

At 24, Jean is the director of marketing and development for Louis Vuitton watches. Louis Vuitton launched its watch factory in 2003.

The youngest Arnault got his master’s degrees in mechanical engineering from Imperial College London and financial mathematics from MIT. His interest in the watchmaking industry peaked after his brother Frédéric told him about what he was doing at TAG Heuer, and he studied at the label’s watch institute.

Even though he just started in the business world, the future is bright.

Jean told the Financial Times that he sees huge potential in mechanical watches during the digital, connected revolution. The more his generation connects their lives with devices, the more they desire something strictly mechanical.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.999983549118042}",neutral,0.999983549118042,0
How Bernard Arnault became the world's richest person - The Economist,"Tue, 20 Dec 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVjb25vbWlzdC5jb20vYnVzaW5lc3MvMjAyMi8xMi8yMC9ob3ctYmVybmFyZC1hcm5hdWx0LWJlY2FtZS10aGUtd29ybGRzLXJpY2hlc3QtcGVyc29u0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"A story Bernard Arnault likes to tell is of a meeting with Steve Jobs, the late co-founder of Apple and father of the iPhone. Jobs was on the verge of launching the Apple Store. Mr Arnault, a Frenchman whose company, LVMH , provides high society with its Louis Vuitton luggage, Christian Dior couture, Tiffany jewellery and Dom Pérignon champagne, knows more than most about turning storefronts into temples of desire. As they talked, the conversation turned to their products. Mr Arnault asked Jobs whether he thought the iPhone would still be around in 30 years’ time. The American replied that he did not know. Jobs then asked the same question about Dom Pérignon, whose first vintage was in 1921. Mr Arnault, the story goes, assured him it would still be drunk for generations to come. Jobs agreed.

In many ways Mr Arnault, the first European to rise to the top of the world’s rich lists, is the epitome of how to do business in the old continent. As his remarks to Jobs suggested, he thinks about the distant past and decades into the future, not just about next year’s profits. He relishes craftsmanship, championing outré designers, perfumers and cellar masters, while often reserving for himself the last word on product details. His own presence as a business titan is understated. Unlike Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos and Bill Gates, his most recent predecessors as the world’s richest people, he is not a household name—unless the household is a maison de couture, or palatial. He is a regular on the Parisian fashion-show circuit, yet lets the clothes and those that wear them grab the spotlight. He is soft-spoken but is no soft touch. As a writer on this newspaper put it back in 1989, he has “a charming smile but teeth, apparently, of steel”. That reputation, which goes well with his lupine looks, is one he has never seemed to mind.

Mr Arnault has been high on the rich list for more than 15 years. Some might think that his rise to the top this month, with a net worth, according to Forbes, of $180bn, is a cyclical fluke, the result of American technology stocks falling out of vogue, Mr Musk immolating his fortune, and analogue stuff—when untouched by the cost-of-living crisis—having a moment of glory. Yet however different the 73-year-old Mr Arnault is from a tech mogul, he, too, has remade the world of business. In the words of Luca Solca of Bernstein, an investment firm, he has invented a paradox: “selling exclusivity by the million”. To achieve that, he has brought American-style business tactics to one of the most traditional of industries and equipped it for a global, premiumised, Instagrammable world. It is an approach others should emulate.

His indoctrination into swashbuckling capitalism came in New York in the early 1980s, where he fled from French socialism. Little is known about his time there, but when he returned to France in 1984, he was quick to deploy the barbarian tactics emerging on Wall Street. First came the leveraged buy-out. He spotted a down-at-heel Christian Dior buried within a struggling textile conglomerate. He sold the dross and polished up Dior, the 38-year-old crown jewel. Then he went hostile, targeting Moët Hennessy-Louis Vuitton in the late 1980s, and ultimately ripping it away from the old money behind it. He was not always successful. Gucci, the Italian fashion house, continues to elude him. But his modus operandi is consistent. Make crafty use of the balance-sheet to buy musty fashion houses and turn them into megabrands. LVMH , worth almost €350bn ($372bn), now has 75 maisons.

He is more than just a dealmaker. He is a master of hype, recruiting eye-catching designers, many from outside France, to shake up the fashion establishment. Their shock value is not just confined to the catwalk. It provides publicity for high-margin fashion accessories, such as perfumes and handbags, that are LVMH ’s more mainstream bread and butter. Moreover, he imposes a machine-like efficiency on the group, modernising production processes, mainly selling through LVMH ’s own stores rather than licensees, and recruiting the best in the business.

His discipline extends to profits. Though he has his eye on long-term brand equity, quarterly results rarely miss a beat. Louis Vuitton is the flagship. Mr Solca estimates it generates €20bn in sales (about a third of LVMH ’s revenues in 2021), with operating margins close to 50%. Gucci pales in comparison. The cashflow enables him to outspend rivals on the fanciest stores and the splashiest marketing campaigns. An advertisement in the run-up to the World Cup, shot by Annie Leibovitz, showing footballers Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo playing chess on a Vuitton briefcase, is a case in point (even if Kylian Mbappé, the French striker, would have been a more inspired choice than Ronaldo).

Pitchforks and silver spoons

LVMH has vulnerabilities. Mr Arnault was early to spot the promise of globalisation, first identifying the Japanese taste for luxury, and then the Chinese one. Asia, which had more than 2,200 LVMH stores in 2021, is by far its biggest source of revenue. However, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has highlighted geopolitical threats. If the firm had to pull out of China, it would be a disaster. Moreover, premiumisation has accompanied the rise of social inequality around the world. While people believe they can emulate the rich, that is good for business. But if they feel they will never be able to join the monogrammed elite, frustrations may rise.

Yet Mr Arnault’s European heritage gives him an extra edge in the wealth stakes. He has an old-world faith in bloodlines. Unlike Mr Musk, who has squandered some of his Tesla stock on Twitter, Mr Bezos, who surrendered part of Amazon to his ex-wife, and Mr Gates, who has sold most of his Microsoft shares, his number-one priority is to retain control of LVMH, in which his family holds an unassailable 48% stake. His five children all work in the business—albeit in what Mr Solca calls a “Darwinian contest” to succeed him when he eventually retires. No one knows better than the lord of luxury the value of keeping hold of the family silver. ■

The 10th Edition of the LVMH Prize Is Open for Applications - WWD,"Thu, 01 Dec 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3dkLmNvbS9mYXNoaW9uLW5ld3MvZGVzaWduZXItbHV4dXJ5L2x2bWgtcHJpemUtYXBwbHktMTAtZWRpdGlvbi1vcGVuLTEyMzU0MzQyODEv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"On your marks, get set — apply!

Starting Thursday, young designers can thrown their names into the ring for the LVMH Prize, which has helped propel the careers of such talents as Marine Serre, Nensi Dojaka, Thebe Magugu, Simon Porte Jacquemus and Grace Wales Bonner.

The 2023 competition marks the 10th edition of the annual design prize and designers have until Jan. 29 to submit their applications to LVMHprize.com.

To qualify, designers must be between the ages of 18 and 40 and have at least two commercialized womenswear, menswear or genderless collections under their belt.

The victor of the LVMH Prize for Young Fashion Designers receives a 300,000-euro endowment and mentorship by LVMH teams in such areas as sustainability, communications, marketing, legal, production and finance.

The winner of the Karl Lagerfeld Prize receives a 150,000-euro allocation plus one year of mentorship from LVMH experts.

Both winners will also receive specific mentoring on environmental issues and receive an allowance — 20,000 euros and 10,000 euros, respectively, for the grand and runner-up prizes — on the Nona Source platform, which gathers deadstock materials from LVMH’s fashion and leather goods houses.

“Ten years after its creation, the LVMH Prize has become a benchmark, a key player in nurturing young designers,” said Delphine Arnault, Louis Vuitton’s executive vice president and a key talent scout for the group, who initiated the prize in 2013.

She noted that the prize has evolved over the years, and “reflects the developments and trends that drive fashion and, more broadly speaking, society.”

“Many influential young designers have taken part in it over the last 10 years, which shows the role the prize plays in talent spotting,” she added.

Other past winners of main, runner-up and special prizes include Hood by Air, Rokh, Doublet, KidSuper, Marques’Almeida and Hed Mayner.

Semifinalists are to be chosen by an LVMH selection committee and revealed in due course.

These contenders — there were 20 for the 2022 edition — are to display their work on March 2 and 3 during Paris Fashion Week at a dedicated showroom and meet with the experts.

The 2023 semifinalists will also be featured on the prize website and social channels from March 2. That “will be an opportunity for the public and the experts to discover and select the competing designers.” This year once again, the general public will also be able to vote for their favorite candidate.

The prize distinguishes three young fashion school graduates. Each will receive 10,000 euros and join the studios of three houses of the LVMH group for one year.

The jury that selects the winners is stacked with LVMH fashion stars. Past editions have included Maria Grazia Chiuri, Stella McCartney, Nigo, Silvia Venturini Fendi, Marc Jacobs, Nicolas Ghesquière, Kim Jones, Jonathan Anderson and the late Virgil Abloh, as well as LVMH executives Sidney Toledano, chairman and chief executive officer of LVMH Fashion Group; Jean-Paul Claverie, an adviser to Bernard Arnault and head of corporate philanthropy at LVMH, and Delphine Arnault.

LVMH also plans to recognize fashion-school graduates, who can apply until March 19.

The 2022 competition attracted some 1,900 applicants and the winner was British designer Steven Stokey-Daley, whose theatrical shows at London Fashion Week have explored the British class system through a queer lens.

There were two winners of the Karl Lagerfeld Prize last year: ERL by Eli Russell Linnetz and Winnie New York, designed by Nigerian-born, London-raised designer Idris Balogun.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999908208847046}",neutral,0.9999908208847046,0
LVMH-Owner Bernard Arnault Overtakes Elon Musk As World's Richest - Jing Daily,"Fri, 16 Dec 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vamluZ2RhaWx5LmNvbS9wb3N0cy9sdm1oLWJlcm5hcmQtYXJuYXVsdC1lbG9uLW11c2stcmljaGVzdC1wZXJzb27SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"What happened

This week, it was announced that Bernard Arnault, the chairman and CEO of LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, has taken the title of the wealthiest person in the world.

According to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index , Arnault has eclipsed Elon Musk, CEO and chief engineer of SpaceX, and CEO of Tesla and Twitter, with a total net worth of $172 billion (1.2 trillion RMB). The French business mogul was previously the highest ranked prior to Musk eclipsing him for over a year. Yet with the LVMH conglomerate’s soaring success in 2022, Arnault is back on top.

The Jing Take

From acquiring fine jewelry producer Pedemonte Group last month to stellar collaborations from the likes of Tiffany, Louis Vuitton, Christian Dior, Rimowa, and Fendi, LVMH has seen a stream of constant wins over the past 12 months. Given this — along with the fact that Tesla’s shares have dropped by 52 percent this year — the ranking comes as no surprise.

After 2022 kicked off on the back of Tiffany x Supreme which dropped in Q4 of 2021, we saw LVMH’s The Swap: Fendi and Versace Collection break the internet. Additionally, Loewe’s Spirited Away collection won over luxury consumers in China and beyond. Other collab wins of the year spearheaded by Arnault included Rimowa colliding with Adidas, RTFKT, and Daniel Arsham; and Dior’s Denim Tears and ERL collections. Not to mention Louis Vuitton’s upcoming collection with iconic artist and game-changing LV collaborator Yayoi Kusama (set for January 2023), alongside 2022’s holy grail: Nike Air Force 1s by the late Virgil Abloh.

In part down to a stellar collaborative strategy among its brands, during the first half of 2022 alone, LVMH recorded revenue of $39.3 billion (271.6 billion RMB), which was up a juicy 28 percent compared to Q1 and 2 of 2021. For the first nine months of 2022, it reported most growth from Asia, at 32 percent, followed by the U.S. at 26 percent, with total revenue of $60.5 billion (​​418.2 billion RMB).

Despite flourishing all over the world, there is yet to be a post-pandemic surge of sales in mainland China as the nation bears the brunt of the COVID-19 impact. Starting the year in confident stead, can LVMH ensure growth with the world’s second-largest luxury consumer in 2023? Let’s see.

UNESCO and LVMH strengthen their partnership to support biodiversity - UNESCO,"Sat, 17 Dec 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnVuZXNjby5vcmcvZW4vYXJ0aWNsZXMvdW5lc2NvLWFuZC1sdm1oLXN0cmVuZ3RoZW4tdGhlaXItcGFydG5lcnNoaXAtc3VwcG9ydC1iaW9kaXZlcnNpdHnSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"On the occasion of the Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity, COP 15, in Montreal, the Man and the Biosphere (MAB) programme of UNESCO is strengthening its cooperation with the LVMH Group on numerous projects around the world.

In particular, in the Amazon basin, this partnership has been working since 2019 against the direct and indirect causes of deforestation in eight biosphere reserves in Bolivia, Brazil, Ecuador and Peru.

To date, it has supported more than 41 projects to regenerate ecosystems and develop sustainable employment projects for local communities, combining scientific and local knowledge with indigenous know-how.

A new strand of activities aims to strengthen the measurement and evaluation of joint programmes, to better understand their impact and, where necessary, adapt them to new environmental challenges

Activities will include specific field data collection missions and the development of indicators to:

Reduce negative impacts on biodiversity, notably through fire prevention and control workshops, by training 480 people in three biosphere reserves;

Increase the positive impacts of agroforestry and handicrafts;

Reducing biodiversity-related risks for businesses; and,

Move towards sustainable production models.

This enhancement involves training and local capacity building so that this scientific data can be better shared within the global network of biosphere reserves and serve as good practice in LVMH Group companies.

The goal is to propose a new methodology for measuring the impact on biodiversity that can be adopted by other companies or structures. In this way, the lessons and practices of sustainable projects could be more easily integrated in the long term, but also passed on to other regions and other ecosystems to contribute to the implementation of the global framework for biodiversity currently under negotiation.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9910188913345337}",positive,0.9910188913345337,1
Bernard Arnault's Son Antoine Is Named CEO of LVMH Family Holding - Robb Report,"Mon, 12 Dec 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vcm9iYnJlcG9ydC5jb20vbGlmZXN0eWxlL25ld3MvYW50b2luZS1hcm5hdWx0LWNlby1sdm1oLWhvbGRpbmctY29tcGFueS0xMjM0Nzg0Mjk1L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"A billionaire’s heirs rising through the ranks of an omnipotent conglomerate: The Arnault children’s movements within LVMH are certainly similar to that of the Roys in the hit TV show Succession. This time, though, it’s the eldest son of LVMH chairman Bernard Arnault in the spotlight instead of Kendall or Roman.

Antoine Arnault was named CEO of Christian Dior SE and vice chairman of its board of directors at the end of last week. The family holding company owns the majority of the Arnaults’ stake in luxury titan LVMH. Arnault will replace veteran executive Sidney Toledano as outlined in a brief statement shared by the company on Friday, December 9.

The appointment comes after Bernard Arnault’s main holding company, Financière Agache, became a joint-stock partnership last Tuesday. The change in the legal structure of the family’s investment was made to ensure its long-term control of LVMH. All five Arnault children now hold senior positions within the French company.

In the case of Antoine, the 45-year-old business school graduate has been an LVMH board member since 2006 and led the group’s communications and environmental initiatives. For the past decade, he has been chief executive of Berluti and chairman of Loro Piana, as reported by Reuters.

As for the rest of the heirs, Delphine Arnault is on LVMH’s board of directors, Alexandre Arnault is an executive at Tiffany & Co., Frederic Arnault is chief executive of TAG Heuer and Jean Arnault takes care of marketing and product development for Louis Vuitton‘s watches division.

Although patriarch Bernard has not publicly named his successor, Antoine’s move into Christian Dior could make him a front-runner. The label, which was folded into LVMH in 2017, now holds 41 percent of LVMH and accounts for 56 percent of the voting rights in the group.

The children could be in for a bit of a wait, though. Their father, who has an estimated net worth of $186 billion, has shown no signs he’s ready to relinquish the top spot. LVMH also changed the maximum age of its CEO from 75 to 80. That means 73-year-old Bernard has a few years left yet.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999973773956299}",neutral,0.9999973773956299,0

The appointment comes in tandem with the conversion of Financière Agache, Bernard Arnault’s main holding company, into a limited joint-stock partnership.

More from WWD

Initiated last July, the conversion is designed to hand control of the entity to his five children: Delphine Arnault, Antoine Arnault, Alexandre Arnault, Frédéric Arnault and Jean Arnault.

All of them work for LVMH brands – including Louis Vuitton, Tiffany & Co. and Tag Heuer – and are in line to eventually succeed their father as head of the group.

Last April, LVMH shareholders voted 81.6 percent in favor of a resolution to extend to 80 the age limit for its longtime chairman and CEO, Bernard Arnault, who is 73. Previously, the company’s bylaws fixed 75 as the age limit for serving as CEO.

Bernard Arnault

At Christian Dior SE, Antoine Arnault takes over from Sidney Toledano, who decided to leave the executive management position. The changes were approved at a meeting in Paris on Thursday night of its nominations and compensation committee.

In a brief release issued Friday morning, Bernard Arnault, who is chairman of the board of directors of Christian Dior SE, said he joined the other board members to “warmly thank Sidney Toledano for the utmost professionalism he has always demonstrated while serving this mandate of trust.”

Antoine Arnault takes on the new title in addition to his roles as CEO of Berluti, chairman of Loro Piana and head of communication, image and environment at LVMH.

“This choice was made in the context of the conversion of Agache SE into a limited joint-stock partnership, which occurred on December 6th, 2022, and will permit the long-term family control over Christian Dior SE and LVMH Moët Hennessy – Louis Vuitton SE to be perpetuated,” Friday’s statement said.

Dior SE is a listed company that is highly symbolic for the family, as Christian Dior was one of the linchpin acquisitions by Bernard Arnault that initiated the construction of the world’s biggest luxury company.

Agache is the controlling shareholder of Christian Dior SE and LVMH SE.

Antoine Arnault Takes on Additional Role at LVMH Family Holding - WWD,"Fri, 09 Dec 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3dkLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy1uZXdzL2h1bWFuLXJlc291cmNlcy9hbnRvaW5lLWFybmF1bHQtYWRkaXRpb25hbC1yb2xlLWx2bWgtZmFtaWx5LWhvbGRpbmctMTIzNTQ0NDQ1My_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Further locking in family control over the LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton luxury empire, Antoine Arnault has been appointed chief executive officer of holding company Christian Dior SE, which controls LVMH, and vice chairman of its board of directors.

The appointment comes in tandem with the conversion of Financière Agache, Bernard Arnault’s main holding company, into a limited joint-stock partnership.

Initiated last July, the conversion is designed to hand control of the entity to his five children: Delphine Arnault, Antoine Arnault, Alexandre Arnault, Frédéric Arnault and Jean Arnault.

All of them work for LVMH brands — including Louis Vuitton, Tiffany & Co. and Tag Heuer — and are in line to eventually succeed their father as head of the group.

Last April, LVMH shareholders voted 81.6 percent in favor of a resolution to extend to 80 the age limit for its longtime chairman and CEO, Bernard Arnault, who is 73. Previously, the company’s bylaws fixed 75 as the age limit for serving as CEO.

At Christian Dior SE, Antoine Arnault takes over from Sidney Toledano, who decided to leave the executive management position. The changes were approved at a meeting of its nominations and compensation committee in Paris on Thursday night.

In a brief release issued Friday morning, Bernard Arnault, who is chairman of the board of directors of Christian Dior SE, said he joined the other board members to “warmly thank Sidney Toledano for the utmost professionalism he has always demonstrated while serving this mandate of trust.”

“I was really touched,” said Toledano, who continues in his role as chairman and CEO of LVMH Fashion Group, which includes Celine, Loewe, Givenchy, Kenzo, Pucci, Marc Jacobs, Patou and Moynat. “My mission continues at LVMH, working for the group and for the family.”

Toledano, who ran Christian Dior Couture, the fashion house, for 20 years, held the same title at the holding company Christian Dior SE for the same amount of time. “Mission accomplished, and I’m happy it’s Antoine; someone from the family. It makes sense,” Toledano said.

(Christian Dior Couture has been headed by chairman and CEO Pietro Beccari since 2017.)

Antoine Arnault takes on the new title in addition to his roles as CEO of Berluti, chairman of Loro Piana and head of communication, image and environment at LVMH.

“This choice was made in the context of the conversion of Agache SE into a limited joint-stock partnership, which occurred on [Dec. 6], and will permit the long-term family control over Christian Dior SE and LVMH Moët Hennessy — Louis Vuitton SE to be perpetuated,” Friday’s statement said.

Dior SE is a listed company that is highly symbolic for the family, as Christian Dior was one of the linchpin acquisitions by Bernard Arnault that initiated the construction of the world’s biggest luxury company.

Agache is the controlling shareholder of Christian Dior SE and LVMH SE. The Arnault family group cumulatively controls 48 percent of LVMH’s capital and 63.7 percent of its voting rights, according to stock market regulator AMF. Meanwhile, it holds 97.5 percent of the capital of Christian Dior SE, which controls LVMH, and 98.4 percent of voting rights.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999951124191284}",neutral,0.9999951124191284,0
"LVMH's Bernard Arnault Buys Leonardo Da Vinci's Milan Home, Vineyard - WWD","Fri, 23 Dec 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3dkLmNvbS9mYXNoaW9uLW5ld3MvZmFzaGlvbi1zY29vcHMvbHZtaC1iZXJuYXJkLWFybmF1bHQtYnV5cy1sZW9uYXJkby1kYS12aW5jaS1ob21lLXZpbmV5YXJkLW1pbGFuLTEyMzU0NTYwMjcv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LUXURY LEONARDO: Leonardo Da Vinci’s vineyard and former residence in Milan’s city center has a new luxury mogul owner, one who knows a thing or two about winemaking.

According to press reports, industry titan Bernard Arnault, chairman and chief executive officer of LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, has bought a storied building known as Casa Degli Atellani in Milan from its previous owners, the descendants of the Conti and Portaluppi families.

The value of the transaction or the purpose of the acquisition were not disclosed and LVMH representatives did not respond to requests for comment Friday.

Built around 1490, the landmark was donated by Ludovico “Il Moro” Duke of Milan to Da Vinci in 1498 while he was in town to paint his masterpiece “The Last Supper.” After changing hands and ownership over time, the Milan residence located on tony Corso Magenta was acquired in 1919 by senator and entrepreneur Ettore Conti, whose son-in-low, famed architect Piero Portaluppi, was tasked with restoring it.

The 15th-century town house hides a verdant courtyard that is home to Da Vinci’s vineyard, the only existing wine-producing estate in the center of a metropolis. Neglected and destroyed, the 16-row, or around two-acre, vineyard was carefully restored in 2014 and finally unveiled to the public during the 2015 international Expo held in Milan.

Since its reopening, the landmark has welcomed visitors and tourists and boasts six for-rent apartments. It has hosted a number of private events, including fashion shows and presentations, and cocktail receptions.

The news was first reported by Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera.

Arnault, whose net worth was estimated at $181.8 billion as of December, according to Forbes, is among the world’s richest men, often competing for the top spot with entrepreneurs including Tesla and Twitter owner Elon Musk and Amazon’s Jeff Bezos.

In addition to controlling fashion brands such as Dior, Louis Vuitton and Givenchy, among others, LVMH owns 26 firms in the wines and spirits category, including Ruinart, Dom Pérignon, Moët & Chandon and Veuve Clicquot. It also boasts a hospitality division, under the other activities moniker, which includes luxury operators such as Cheval Blanc and Belmond.

In 2013, the French group took a majority stake in storied Pasticceria Confetteria Cova Srl, owner of the Cova brand and of the Cova Montenapoleone Srl firm that manages one of Milan’s most fashionable and iconic coffee houses, located on Via Montenapoleone.

LVMH Amplifies Diverse Voices With New Initiative and Commitments - WWD,"Thu, 01 Dec 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vd3dkLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy1uZXdzL2J1c2luZXNzLWZlYXR1cmVzL2x2bWgtYW1wbGlmaWVzLWRpdmVyc2Utdm9pY2VzLXdpdGgtbmV3LWluaXRpYXRpdmUtY29tbWl0bWVudHMtMTIzNTQzNDQ2OS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"As part of its global effort to enhance inclusion within its workforce and through the consumers that it markets to, LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton has rolled out its “Voices of Inclusion Week.”

Running through Tuesday, the initiative features 50 to 100 activations that highlight varying degrees of diversity and inclusion and building upon the company’s existing programs while laying the groundwork for future plans. Primers about awareness and training, best practices and accountability are among the issues being addressed. With 180,000 to 200,000 employees — including 45,000 new recruits within this year — such efforts stand to have significant impact internally as well as through the millions of people they encounter annually through their work. The aim is to make “Voices of Inclusion” an annual event.

In an interview Thursday, Vanessa Moungar, chief D&I officer at the LVMH Group, noted that with 75 maisons operating in more than 80 countries, “There is so much going on on the ground in terms of diversity and inclusion that we wanted to have an occasion to make all of the voices louder together at the same time.”

As for what this signals to consumers about the group’s accountability, she said, “The event in itself is not the moment where something is happening. The week is to really put the spotlight on our values and engagement throughout the year. Our talent is first, because we really believe that people make the difference. We are a very big group and we are growing very fast. We want to make sure that our talent feel part of it, empowered, respected and represented. People think of us very often in terms of fashion or beauty, but we are across six different sectors. We have so many different and diverse backgrounds way beyond what you would imagine as traditional dimensions of diversity — which are gender, sexual orientation, disability, age…,” Moungar said.

One central point of the inclusive week happened when LVMH signed the LGBT+ Engagement Charter on Wednesday night. The charter was launched by the French nonprofit L’Autre Cercle in 2013 to establish equal rights and equal treatment to everyone in a work environment.

To magnify LVMH’s commitment to the charter, an event was held in Paris Wednesday night that was attended by 20 of the group’s chief executive officers. The global luxury company joins a list of 130 other companies that have already committed to the charter, which was created to ensure inclusion for LGBTQ employees. While many people expect that practices that oppose discrimination in all its forms should already be done or “already normalized” in the fashion and beauty industry, Moungar said that is not the case. Referring to the renewed commitment, she said that “ensures that everyone is aware of the things that we really believe in across our ecosystem.”

In addition, LVMH has committed to the Mitigate Racial Bias in Retail Charter, which was started by the nonprofit Open to All and Sephora in September. The charter is meant to bring together retailers to implement tactics and actions that are meant to eliminate race biases from the shopping experience and create more welcoming retail environments.

On another front, LVMH is releasing its D&I Global roadmap internally. That has three pillars for action — people, which spans recruitment, development, benefits and other areas; partners, as in the supply chain, and image, with an eye on the external work. One initiative that was started 15 years ago to increase the representation of women in key positions to 50 percent is now at 45 percent and continues with an emphasis on executive committees. An announcement about the group’s commitment to pay equity and salary by 2025 will soon be revealed publicly. A global mentoring network to further career growth and mobility is being set up.

Another goal is to increase the number of employees who are living with a disability to 5 percent from 2 percent. And in North America, the goal of having people of color comprise 30 percent of those in leadership positions has been achieved this year, Moungar said.

Voices of Inclusion Week involves workshops, master classes and conferences planned for Fendi, Make U for Ever, Sephora, Benefit Cosmetics, Acqua di Parma, LVMH China and LVMH Italy. Expanded D&I training with an emphasis on unconscious bias is also happening at Louis Vuitton, Fendi, Kenzo, Bulgari and Loro Piana. Meanwhile, Veuve Clicquot’s 50-year history of supporting female entrepreneurs through its Bold initiative will be trumpeted. Belmont is amplifying its recent “Traveling with Pride.” To tie in to the inclusion week, LVMH staged a immersive pop-up experience at Art Basel Miami featuring such diverse artists as Cruise Bogle.

While D&I has been part of LVMH’s DNA for a long time, Moungar noted, “It’s important to speak up in today’s world to say that we really care about this and everybody being included.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999121427536011}",neutral,0.9999121427536011,0
Antoine Arnault Officially Takes Over as CEO of LVMH Holding Company - HYPEBEAST,"Mon, 12 Dec 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vaHlwZWJlYXN0LmNvbS8yMDIyLzEyL2FudG9pbmUtYXJuYXVsdC1jZW8tbHZtaC1ob2xkaW5nLWdyb3VwLWNocmlzdGlhbi1kaW9yLXNlLWFubm91bmNlbWVudNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Antoine Arnault, the oldest son of French billionaire Bernard Arnault, is officially stepping in as CEO of Christian Dior SE, the holding company through which the family controls luxury goods conglomerate, LVMH. Antoine has been named both CEO and vice-chairman and replaces the 71-year-old Sidney Toledano, who was the president of LVMH’s Fashion Group and former chief of the Christian Dior Couture brand. Pietro Beccari still remains as chairman and CEO of Christian Dior Couture.

While Antoine now has a larger role within the billionaire family’s luxury empire, Bernard’s second-oldest child will continue to carry out his other roles as a member of LVMH’s board of directors, as well as continue to oversee and lead the Berluti brand in image and communications. The Christian Dior SE brand merged with LVMH’s wider portfolio in 2017 and reported identical revenues since selling its namesake to the larger group for €6.5 billion EUR. Christian Dior SE now holds 41% of LVMH. The move for Antoine to succeed Toledano stirs additional speculations of success at the group. In a statement, Bernard thanked Toledano “for the utmost professionalism he has always demonstrated while serving this mandate of trust” as CEO of Dior SE. Toledano is also the chairman of French fashion school IFM and was recently appointed president of the Chambre Syndicale de la Haute Couture, also known as the governing body for France’s prestigious haute couture designation.

All of Bernard Arnault’s five children hold senior positions at LVMH. According to Reuters, Antoine’s appointment comes after a change in the legal structure of the Arnault family’s investment to ensure its control of LVMH. Besides his new role with Christian Dior SE and continued executive position at Berluti, Antoine will also remain the chairman of Loro Piana. Antoine’s father and LVMH chairman and CEO Bernard Arnault, 73, has not yet publicly named his successor to lead the sprawling fashion luxury empire though it is widely speculated that one of his five children will take over one day.

LVMH and Kering lead fashion's input at UN's biodiversity conference - Vogue Business,"Thu, 15 Dec 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZvZ3VlYnVzaW5lc3MuY29tL3N1c3RhaW5hYmlsaXR5L2x2bWgtYW5kLWtlcmluZy1sZWFkLWZhc2hpb25zLWlucHV0LWF0LXVucy1iaW9kaXZlcnNpdHktY29uZmVyZW5jZdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"To become a Vogue Business Member and receive the Sustainability Edit newsletter, click here.

Kering, LVMH, L’Occitane, Natura and H&M are all in Montreal this week for this year’s UN Biodiversity Conference, COP15. With several attending the event for the first time, it’s a sign that the fashion and beauty industries are waking up to the biodiversity crisis and their own role in accelerating it — a major shift from just a few years ago when biodiversity was absent from fashion’s sustainability agenda.

“It’s the first biodiversity COP where the private sector is really present and pushing for an ambitious Global Biodiversity Framework, often even more ambitious than what the country-level negotiators are heading towards,” says Géraldine Vallejo, Kering’s sustainability programme director, from the event. “We are hoping that the negotiators will agree on the level of ambition that is necessary. We also expect that next year, the fashion sector will have its own dedicated stream!”

Already, fashion has made a splash with a string of announcements during the conference, which runs until Monday. Kering and L’Occitane launched a fund for protecting nature at scale, with €140 million committed out of the €300 million target, meant to “mobilise resources” from luxury fashion and beauty to protect and restore nature, as well as focusing on women’s empowerment.

LVMH is participating in the development of standards for a risk management framework intended to help companies better map their impacts on nature as a member of the Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD), which it joined last month. The conglomerate also said it’s strengthening its collaboration with Unesco and is launching a second programme to restore forest cover and strengthen the development of a regenerative economy in Indigenous communities in the southern Ecuadorian and northern Peruvian Amazon, under its partnership with the Circular Bioeconomy Alliance. (The first project, focused on agroforestry in Chad, was announced at COP27 in November.)

And H&M has come out in support (along with more than 330 other companies) of Business for Nature’s Make It Mandatory campaign, a call on governments to require companies to disclose their impact on nature. The Swedish group has also said it is engaging, with nonprofit World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF), in projects “close to its value chain to conserve and restore biodiversity in key landscapes”.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9996287822723389}",neutral,0.9996287822723389,0
LVMH's 'Guochao' Beauty Brand Cha Ling Shutters China Stores - Jing Daily,"Mon, 12 Dec 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vamluZ2RhaWx5LmNvbS9wb3N0cy9jaGEtbGluZy1sdm1oLWJlYXV0eS1jaGluYS1leGl0LWd1b2NoYW_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"What happened

A luxury skincare brand launched by LVMH as recently as 2016 has already closed all its offline stores in the China market. The tea and guochao-inspired beauty label was born following an encounter between Laurent Boillot, the then chairman of Guerlain, and environmentalists Josef Margraf and his wife Li Ming Guo.

According to the luxury conglomerate group, Cha Ling “Esprit du Thé ” is the first cosmetics name to integrate the anti-oxidant, anti-aging, and anti-pollution properties of Pu'er tea into its products. The launch was much feted with multiple solo boutiques opening in luxury malls across China. However the formula hasn’t exactly panned out after several years of Covid.

The shuttering of Cha Ling's doors as well as the termination of its official Wechat store is cited as part of its new business strategy. Instead it will now retail exclusively through LVMH’s Sephora.

The Jing Take

Cha Ling’s exit from the market is telling. Over the years, only a small number of western luxury names have attempted to launch lines just for the China market — also dubbed by the Chinese as “fake guochao” (or 伪国潮) brands. Originators of this trend include Hermes’ lifestyle company Shang Xia, which launched in 2010, and Estee Lauder's Osiao (“O-Shao”), which shuttered two years later. Neither entirely captured the high end market, not least due to competition from authentic homegrown entities. The lower end is being squeezed too: In July, L’Oréal's cosmetics firm Maybelline confirmed that it will close 14 freestanding physical stores in China nearing the end of their contract, citing a need to “adapt to the changes in the market and consumer demand.”

Now Cha Ling is also facing difficulties in the country's highly saturated beauty market, where C-beauty names have become experts in attracting local followers. Their new deal with the rapidly expanding Sephora (which added 38 new stores in China during 2021) makes sense but even still, Cha Ling will likely face challenges in the coming months.

With pharmacy/cosmetics chains like Harmay and Watsons gearing up to take more market share, LVMH and Cha Ling must continue to keep a close eye on — and react to changes in — local consumer habits. One thing is sure: the reputational damage is done. Optics matter. This swift departure does not bode well if Cha Ling is to attempt a solo bricks and mortar return.

Billionaire Bernard Arnault elevated his eldest son, Antoine , to a broader role within the world’s largest luxury conglomerate in a move that will spark fresh speculation about succession at LVMH.

Here’s what you need to know …

Europe’s most valuable company

A chocolate factory, ephemeral restaurants, cafes and even, perhaps, a hotel: the world’s leading luxury brand Louis Vuitton, which wants to be “more than a fashion brand, a culture brand”, is accelerating its diversification to better “extend its territory”. Photo: AFP

The move gives Antoine an increasingly prominent role within Europe’s most valuable company, with a market capitalisation of US$384 billion (364 billion euros) and a sprawling portfolio of high-end brands ranging from Louis Vuitton to Dom Perignon Champagne.

It’ll also revive one of the favourite parlour games in Paris – talk of which of Bernard’s five children will succeed the 73-year-old LVMH chief once he hands over the reins of the empire he began building more than three decades ago.

“The appointment of Antoine Arnault exemplifies a planned transition in a spirit of fair process around the succession of Bernard Arnault,” said Philippe Pelé-Clamour, an expert on the governance of family firms at business school HEC Paris.

Bernard Arnault isn’t going anywhere any time soon

There’s no indication that he’s going anywhere any time soon. LVMH recently lifted the age limit of its chief executive officer, allowing the family patriarch to stay at the helm until he’s 80.

Still, the appointment shows how Bernard has been moving to cement family control once he’s no longer in charge. All five of the younger generation, including Antoine, work at LVMH or one of its brands.

He has a staggering net worth that stands at USD 172 billion (approximately RM 758 billion), as on 15 December 2022. This makes one wonder how the business magnate spends his wealth and what the most expensive things owned by Bernard Arnault are. We take a look.

The French fashion mogul surpassed Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk to grab the apex position on the billionaires’ index. While Musk’s net worth plummeted by USD 107 billion in 2022 due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the Twitter row, Arnault, too, suffered a dip — but a mild one — of USD 7 billion, CNN reported.

The current richest person on the planet has many luxe assets and a lifestyle that defines grandeur and opulence at every turn.

Here are some of the most expensive things owned by Bernard Arnault

Luxury purchases portfolio

He started his journey to the top in the 1980s when he first ventured into fashion with USD15 million (RM64 million) from his father’s construction business. He got the rest of USD65 million (RM275 million) financed from Lazard to buy Boussac – the then-parent company of Christian Dior – in 1985. Since then, Arnault has been acquiring luxury brands and earned nicknames like “the wolf in the cashmere coat” in French media.

In 1987, the conglomerate LVMH came into existence with the merger of Moët & Chandon and Hennessy, the world’s largest champagne and cognac producers, respectively. Bernard Arnault then went on to conquer leading European luxury brands, including couture-brand Givenchy (1988), French perfume, makeup and skincare giant Guerlain (1994), French leather luxury goods brand Céline (1996), the Italian jewellery brand Bvlgari (2011), Paris-based couture house Christian Dior (2017), American luxury jewellery and accessory brand Tiffany & Co. (2020) and Italian luxury label Off-White (2021), bringing the total to 75 stellar brands.

Apart from luxury brands, Bernard Arnault has taken the helm of other pursuits such as hotels, artwork, yachts and culture.

Superyachts

The year 2008 marks Arnault’s passion for yachts when he first acquired the luxury Dutch yacht building firm Royal Van Lent and famed British yacht manufacturer Princess Yachts International in a consortium for over EUR300 million (RM1.5 billion) and EUR 200 million (RM1 billion), respectively.

The luxury yacht named Symphony, owned by Arnault, is among the world’s top 100 superyachts and the largest Feadship. Symphony can accommodate 36 passengers and is the first Feadship to cross the 100-metre mark and measures 101.5 metres or about 333 feet.

Designed by Tim Heywood Design, Symphony is an eco-friendly yacht featuring six decks, an aluminium structure, has a gross tonnage of near 3,000 GT and a helicopter pad. The interior of the yacht, by Zuretti Interior Design, exudes luxury with a jacuzzi, sauna, lounge and dining area to accommodate 20 people. One of the decks includes a private office and study, beach club, cinema, golf area and wellness centre.

The French yacht enthusiast also owned Amadeus, a superyacht built in 1969, which was given a luxury makeover to host many prominent personalities such as former UK Prime Minister Tony Blair and renowned rockstar Bono. It was later sold in 2015.

Wines and spirits

LVMH’s 23 houses strive together to craft high-end cognacs, wines and champagnes around the world. The key brands include Moët & Chandon, Hennessy, Krug and Château d’Yquem.

Private island

Bernard Arnault reportedly owns Indigo Island, a 135-acre private island located in the Bahamas that offers retreats for the affluent at a whopping price of approximately USD300,000 (RM1.3 million) per week.

Artwork

Known for his collection of world-class artworks, the French entrepreneur’s extensive collection of contemporary artwork includes paintings by Picasso, Andy Warhol and Henry Moore. His proximity to art and culture can be established by the fact that LVMH has ventured into many artistic pursuits, including the inception of the idea of the Foundation Louis Vuitton in 2001 — which opened for the public in 2014.

According to Bloomberg, Arnault keeps the collection of most famous artists in his Paris house.

Luxury hotels

Cheval Blanc and Belmond Hotel are owned by LVMH, which offer extravagance like no other. Cheval Blanc is a luxury hotel with 72 rooms and suites. The hotel also features on-site LV and Dior boutiques for luxury shopping.

LVMH has over 46 Belmond hotel properties across 24 countries and counting.

Saint-Tropez mansion

Arnault owns a massive chateau-style waterfront mansion in Saint-Tropez, France, featuring multiple bedrooms, an outdoor swimming pool, tennis court, movie theatre and separate quarters for staff.

Private jets

Bernard Arnault reportedly splashed USD40 million (RM170 million) on his private jet, Dassault Falcon 7X. Previously, he owned a Bombardier Global Express 6000. He also owns an ultra-long-range business jet Bombardier Global 7500 which can accommodate up to 19 passengers.

The Tesla (TSLA) and SpaceX CEO’s net worth dropped to $185.3 billion on the morning of Dec. 7, just below Arnault’s $185.4 billion, as Tesla’s stock price fell, according to Forbes’s real-time billionaire tracker. Musk regained his top spot in the early afternoon before losing it again at around 3:30pm.

Musk is back to No. 1 today (Dec. 8) after Tesla stock inched up 0.6 percent to $150 in morning trading hours.

Musk’s net worth has dropped by about $100 billion this year as Tesla’s share price plunged nearly 57 percent this year, twice the decline in the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite. His fortune has halved from its peak of $340 billion just a year ago. About a third of Musk’s wealth is tied to Tesla. The rest resides in SpaceX, Twitter, the Boring Company and cash.

Meanwhile, LVMH shares, traded in Paris, are up nearly 18 percent in the past six months, adding about $40 billion to Arnault’s fortune. LVMH owns a host of luxury fashion brands, including Christian Dior, Louis Vuitton, Fendi and others.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9996871948242188}",neutral,0.9996871948242188,0

Bernard Arnault, who with his family now tops the wealth of Elon Musk, gradually built LVMH into a global luxury empire by buying up iconic brands, sealing his reputation as a formidable and insatiable businessman.

With $184 billion last week, the 73-year-old Frenchman and his family moved to the top of Forbes' billionaire list, knocking the Tesla, SpaceX and Twitter boss off the top spot.

LVMH, the world's leading luxury group, boasts more than 75 brands, acquired over time.

They include some of the most recognisable names in fashion and prestige goods, from Louis Vuitton and Kenzo to Moet Hennessy and Tiffany.

""An essential quality in our family is patience,"" Arnault acknowledged in a 2012 TV profile of him.

A decade later, by which time LVMH's annual sales had more than doubled to over 64 billion euros ($68 billion), he told France's Radio Classique: ""We can continue to progress, but let's be patient.

""No rush,"" he said.

The businessman has also invested in the French media, a move he described during a Senate hearing in January 2022 as ""more on the patronage side"".

During a hearing in the French Senate earlier this year Arnault said he had intervened to stop LVMH advertising in the Liberation newspaper, after it irked him with a front-page article.

'Invest in something promising'

Arnault was born in the northern French city of Roubaix on 5 March 1949 and joined his father's public works building company at the age of 22.

He had just left the elite Ecole Polytechnique and convinced his father to transform the construction business into real-estate development instead.

In 1981, after socialist Francois Mitterrand was elected president, Arnault left France for the United States.

On his return three years later, he bought the debt-ridden textiles company Boussac, prevailing against several serious competitors with a promise to save jobs.

However, he embarked on a drastic reorganisation of the firm, only retaining some of its businesses, including the fashion house Christian Dior.

By then, Arnault was 35 years old.

""My father was surprised when I went to see him saying: 'We're going to redirect the family group and try to invest in something more promising, Christian Dior',"" the businessman recalled recently on Radio Classique.

It would be the foundation stone for his luxury empire.

LVMH was born out of the merger in 1987 of trunk-maker Louis Vuitton and the wines and spirits group Moet Hennessy.

Rivalry between the families owning the two companies aided Arnault's ascendancy and he took control of the group in 1989 after no fewer than 17 legal proceedings.

""He's a tough negotiator but unmatched, a visionary who knows how to surround himself with good people and who in the end always gets his way one way or another,"" Arnaud Cadart, portfolio manager at financial services firm Flornoy, told AFP.

Arnault's rise, however, has not been without some failures.

He lost Italian fashion and leather goods house Gucci to his French rival Francois Pinault, head of the PPR group, in 1999.

Arnault also tried in vain to take over Hermes, known for its silk scarves and leather handbags, by secretly building up a stake in the firm.

He rarely speaks publicly and does not like the limelight.

When the use of private jets by celebrities was being tracked on social media earlier this year, Arnault sold the LVMH jet.

""The upshot now is that no one else can know where I'm going because I lease planes,"" he said on Radio Classique.

""It's the French businessman's lot to embody, sometimes in a totally unjustified way, the criticisms of the day since the mindset has for a few years now been a bit anti-corporate,"" he lamented on France 2 in 2016.

That same year he was skewered in a satirical documentary entitled ""Merci Patron!"" (Thank you Boss!) by filmmaker and now politician Francois Ruffin, who often has Arnault in his crosshairs.

Last year, LVMH paid a 10-million-euro fine to settle a case as part of a probe into spying.

Arnault abandoned his bid to secure Belgian nationality in 2013 issuing a mea culpa after it whipped up a storm of controversy which rumbled on for months amid public debate over the tax arrangements of the wealthy.

In 2011, he was received at the White House by president Barack Obama; Russian President Vladimir Putin welcomed him to Moscow five years later; former French president Francois Hollande cut the ribbon on his Louis Vuitton Foundation, while Donald Trump did the same for a Vuitton workshop in Texas.

And when the historic Samaritaine department store, owned by LVMH, reopened last year, French President Emmanuel Macron was a guest at the inauguration.

In Japan, China and the Middle East, the luxury mogul has access to top leaders.

Arnault has five children, all of whom work for LVMH, but shows little sign of slowing down, or handing over the reins just yet.

Every week he makes a point of touring all the group's Paris-based companies.

At its last general meeting, the age limit for his role as LVMH chief executive was extended to 80 years old, ensuring the luxury conglomerate stays in family hands.

Married to a pianist and art lover, Arnault also created the Louis Vuitton Foundation, one of Paris' most prestigious exhibition locations for contemporary art.

LVMH’s Bernard Arnault Surpasses Elon Musk as the World’s Richest Person - Robb Report,"Fri, 09 Dec 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vcm9iYnJlcG9ydC5jb20vbGlmZXN0eWxlL25ld3MvYmVybmFyZC1hcm5hdWx0LWVsb24tbXVzay1yaWNoZXN0LXBlcnNvbi0xMjM0NzgzNjExL9IBXmh0dHBzOi8vcm9iYnJlcG9ydC5jb20vbGlmZXN0eWxlL25ld3MvYmVybmFyZC1hcm5hdWx0LWVsb24tbXVzay1yaWNoZXN0LXBlcnNvbi0xMjM0NzgzNjExL2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Back in October 2021, Elon Musk’s net worth surpassed a bonkers $300 billion, making him the world’s first person to reach the milestone and the richest at that time. This week, the Tesla and SpaceX CEO has been supplanted as the world’s richest person by LVMH CEO, Bernard Arnault.

The French businessman has held the title four times before—in December 2019, January 2020 as well as May and July of 2021. He surpassed Jeff Bezos as the world’s richest person last summer with a net worth of $186.3 billion. When the markets closed on Thursday, the tycoon’s net worth was reportedly $186.2 billion—$1.2 billion more than Musk’s estimated net worth of $185 billion. Musk may still top the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, but who knows for how much longer.

Given all the controversy around Musk’s $44 billion Twitter takeover—and one strange nightstand image—you’d be forgiven for thinking his choices have disrupted his finances. (And you might be right.) Yet even as Arnault’s net worth surpassed Musk’s twice on Wednesday, the Tesla leader regained the top spot by the time markets closed, with an estimated $185.4 billion that edged out Arnault’s $184.7 billion, according to Forbes.

The roles reversed on Thursday, however, with Arnault’s estimated net worth standing at a reported $185.1 billion as of 9:30 am. Musk’s net worth trailed behind at $184.1 billion. Why? Tesla shares opened trading on Thursday down by one percent, after Bloomberg reported Wednesday evening that Musk may replace some of Twitter’s debt with a personal margin loan. The loan would reportedly be backed by shares of Tesla. This news caused a drop in the marque’s stock, which opened the door for Arnault to surpass Musk in Forbes rankings.

LVMH has enjoyed robust business of late, not doubt bolstering Arnault’s staggering wealth. In October, the conglomerate—which owns Louis Vuitton, Bulgari and Tiffany & Co., among other luxury brands—saw strong third-quarter sales, leading to a rise in luxury shares despite gloomy forecasts by economists. Musk’s messy Twitter takeover, meanwhile, has weighed heavily on Tesla’s stock since he first announced the deal on April 14 (before he attempted to back out of the deal). The marque’s shares are down more than 50 percent this year with nearly all of the drop happening after his initial Twitter takeover announcement.

Musk planned to finance the acquisition of Twitter, in part, with a $6.3 billion personal margin loan. In the end, he scrapped the loan and instead financed the rest of the purchase with his own cash and $8 billion of equity, reports Forbes. Tech stocks have now crashed since mid-April, which means Twitter is likely worth less now than the $44 billion price tag Musk initially agreed to pay.

Whether the outspoken CEO will end up back on top as the world’s richest person remains is an open question. But experts believe the latest reports don’t look good for him—or Tesla investors.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9861896634101868}",neutral,0.9861896634101868,0

In his new role, Arnault (the second-oldest of Bernard’s 5 children) replaces Sidney Toledano, the 71-year-old president of LVMH’s Fashion Group and former chief of the Christian Dior Couture brand, which was merged into LVMH’s wider portfolio in 2017. Arnault will continue in his roles as a member of LVMH’s board of directors, as well as overseeing image and communications for the group and leading the Berluti brand.

Christian Dior SE’s reported revenues are identical to LVMH’s since selling its namesake brand to the larger group for €6.5 billion. The entity has historical significance, however, as the cornerstone of Bernard Arnault’s empire: after acquiring ailing textiles group Boussac in 1984, Arnault spun off the Dior brand and used it, as well as a windfall from selling his family’s engineering company, to mount a takeover of LVMH in 1988 with support from the bank Lazard and drinks distributor Guinness.

In a statement, Bernard Arnault thanked Toledano for “for the utmost professionalism he has always demonstrated while serving this mandate of trust” as CEO of Dior SE.

Toledano was succeeded by Pietro Beccari as CEO of the Christian Dior Couture brand in 2018. As president of LVMH’s Fashion Group, he now oversees most of the group’s midsize luxury fashion houses, including Celine, Loewe and Givenchy.

Toledano is also chairman of French fashion school IFM and was recently appointed president of the Chambre Syndicale de la Haute Couture, the governing body for France’s prestigious haute couture designation.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999921321868896}",neutral,0.9999921321868896,0

The unisex capsule takes cues from the brand’s signature puffer styles as well as new looks from its recent collections.

One of the statement pieces is an oversized scarf in pink and blue with the shape of a hand at both ends. The designer called it a “lovers’ cuddle scarf,” as it offers “warmth and strength to people who believe in the pure power of love.”

“We have all endured the turmoil that took place in the past three years; we hope that our fans can hug themselves with the scarves and find strength and confidence. We can also share the love with our family, friends, or lovers,” he added.

A London College of Fashion graduate, Peng designed the majority of the outfits for the performers during the opening ceremony of the Beijing Winter Olympics.

Riding on that momentum, Peng said he has applied for a show/presentation slot for the upcoming Paris Fashion Week in February. He received a spot at the PFW official showroom Sphere, as one of the rewards for winning the Yu Prize last year.

“We are trying to keep in touch with the fashion industry closely and get back to normal tempo as soon as possible since the epidemic situation is better now globally,” he added.

Maud Barrionuevo, buying and marketplace director at 24S, said the collaboration with Chen Peng is “part of our ongoing partnership with the emerging talents of the LVMH Prize, all of whom we’ve been proud to spotlight on 24S over the last few seasons.”

“This project was playful and fun, a true reflection of his poetic and dreamlike aesthetic, and we loved revisiting the puffer coat as a comforting and colorful pastel cocoon to wrap up warm in throughout the winter months,” she added.

Barrionuevo stressed that it’s “important to highlight young talents irrespective of their nationality or background.”

“We have supported Chen Peng from the beginning because we believe in his take on modern outerwear and his bold and playful vision of garments today. We are also committed to supporting Ukrainian designers like Anna October and Sleeper at this difficult time. Most of them, in addition to contending with very personal challenges, are struggling with logistical and production difficulties where their businesses are concerned,” she said.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9993051290512085}",neutral,0.9993051290512085,0

In a year of geopolitical uncertainty, pandemic lockdowns in China and returning global travel, one sector stood out for its stellar growth: luxury. Within that ecosystem, some bold companies and brands were responsible for propelling growth to new heights, convincing consumers that luxury values identified with theirs and that culture was the new coin of the realm.

Here are the winners of the top awards that Luxury Daily hands out each year. Each honoree went above and beyond to excel in a highly competitive luxury market vying for aspirational as well as affluent consumers. They deserve to take a bow.

Luxury Marketer of the Year: LVMH

Normally, this gong goes to one of the usual suspects – Louis Vuitton, Cartier, Hermès, Dior, Gucci, Chanel, Tiffany & Co. Not this round. At judging time, one thread emerged. Many brands were contenders for this title. And they dipped into the same playbook: stylish product and bold marketing chasing millennials and Gen Z to identify themselves with disparate brands all from one French conglomerate: LVMH.

To say LVMH is a juggernaut is an understatement. Nothing could stop the Paris-based company helmed by Bernard Arnault – not COVID-19, not China’s lockdown, not supply chain issues, not geopolitical turmoil. As global travel resumed early in 2022, consumers flocked to LVMH brands for retail therapy. And the unvarnished enthusiasm showed in the numbers.

LVMH’s revenue grew 31 percent – 24 percent in organic terms – to $20 billion in the first nine months of 2022. Louis Vuitton, the crown jewel of LVMH, led the charge. But that is not to say the other brands in the portfolio were slackers.

The company marshaled eye-catching ad campaigns, cross-industry brand collaborations and trendy line extensions to lift sales for Dior, Givenchy, Loro Piana, Bulgari, Sephora, Loewe Veuve Clicquot, Tag Heuer, Rimowa, Moët & Chandon, Kenzo, Celine, Hublot, Le Bon Marche and Tiffany, among its stable of luxury labels.

LVMH pays attention to nurturing talent through its eponymous prize, supports the arts and craftsmanship, and boasts initiatives to encourage minority and female participation across the company’s brands. While other holding-company competitors such as Gucci owner Kering and Cartier parent Richemont have similar efforts, what LVMH has is scale and the ability to impact across industry sectors and geographies, given its thousands of stores worldwide.

All in all, LVMH in 2022 outshone its rivals in marketing, retail, merchandising, talent recruitment, supply chain control and shareholder value generation. More impressive, it is run like a business – more in line with those in consumer packaged goods and mainstream retail. LVMH may be family controlled, but it is professionally run – and the results showed in 2022. That is why it is Luxury Daily’s Luxury Marketer of the Year.

Luxury Retailer of the Year: Saks

One thing is clear. The role of digital in omnichannel luxury retail sales is growing. But bricks-and-mortar stores have not ceded ground. Indeed, there is a dogfight for the best retail leases across luxury boulevards in London, New York, Paris, Los Angeles and other major cities with affluent populations, very often pitting brands from LVMH, Kering and Richemont as well as Hermès and Chanel against each other.

What is also clear is that luxury department stores continue to stay relevant to consumers and to the luxury brands themselves.

In that sector, digital-focused Saks, Saks Fifth Avenue, Neiman Marcus, Nordstrom and Bloomingdale’s in the United States, online giants such as Net-A-Porter, MatchesFashion, Farfetch and Mytheresa, and non-U.S. retailers such as Harrods, Lane Crawford, Holt Renfrew, Galeries Lafayette and a bunch of others continue to give affluent consumers one-stop options under a single roof.

Of that lot, one continues to stand out: Saks.

Throughout 2022, Saks cemented its standing as the premier digital platform for luxury fashion, driving innovation and growing faster than any of its luxury peers. It delivered first-of-its-kind experiences, personalized interactions and culturally influential campaigns, all while offering a wide assortment of merchandise from established and up-and-coming labels.

Through its exclusive partnership with Saks Fifth Avenue stores (SFA), Saks provided services no other digital pureplay can: alterations, buy online and pick-up in store, among other features.

Since its separation from SFA in March 2021, Saks acquired more than 2 million customers – double the online customers Saks Fifth Avenue had in 2019.

Plus, Saks’ year-to-date 2022 sales on a gross merchandise value (GMV) basis increased 38 percent compared to the year-ago period, and 122 percent versus pre-pandemic year-to-date 2019 levels.

“This year at Saks, we have been innovating to further elevate the unique experiences we deliver for our customers,” said Emily Essner, chief marketing officer of Saks, New York. “Through our marketing strategy that combines immersive digital and in-person experiences, we strive to provide Saks shoppers with opportunities to engage with us in ways they won’t find anywhere else.

“By harnessing the power of data-driven technology to personalize these interactions, we are able to further develop lasting and meaningful customer relationships,” she said.

Saks and SFA’s partnership is ostensibly working, demonstrated by ecosystem gross merchandise value increasing by 45 percent year-to-date 2022 versus year-to-date 2019, and cross-channel customers growing by nearly 20 percent year-to-date 2022 compared to the year-ago period.

Among the initiatives that elevated the Saks experience:

Saks leveraged cross-channel customer insights to optimize personalization across its online Saks Stylist, Limitless VIP stylist and store stylist programs and in nearly 90 percent of customer emails.

Saks introduced a post-purchase ambassador program providing dedicated support to higher-spending customers.

Saks’ live commerce platform, Saks Live, provided on-demand style inspiration through unique engagement opportunities with industry insiders. Through this highly advanced initiative, Saks presented 140-plus events year-to-date 2022 with strong engagement, increased conversion and higher average order value (AOV) among event participants.

Saks presented its first immersive shopping experience in Aspen, CO, bringing its assortment and services to a new market, and hosting top clients and tastemakers for unique experiences. It also presented a Saks Live, giving viewers virtual access.

Saks’ Limitless VIP program welcomed a significant number of new members who have become increasingly loyal to Saks. Members access special merchandise, experiences and services.

Saks demonstrated its fashion authority through brand partnerships, including its special presentation of Prada’s holiday collection on Saks.com and in SFA stores, driving significant cross-channel demand.

In terms of cultivating emerging talent, Saks welcomed the second class of The New Wave, supporting high-potential independent brands’ growth at Saks and industrywide, and amplifying diverse talent, furthering Saks’ commitment to increasing representation in its assortment.

The program has proven successful, with brands such as LaQuan Smith, BruceGlen and Alejandra Alonso Rojas graduating from its inaugural year.

More recently, Alicia Williams, Saks' vice president of diversity, equity and inclusion, made Luxury Daily’s prestigious Luxury Women to Watch 2023 honor roll.

Saks also unveiled Saks Beauty Recycling in partnership with TerraCycle, empowering customers to embrace sustainable practices. As the only retailer offering this online, Saks provides a convenient solution giving empty beauty containers a second life through both Saks.com and SFA.

Additionally, Saks’ brand comes to life through partnerships with influential talents, engaging numerous audiences. Each activation features digital and physical elements, from Saks Live events, exclusive online merchandise collections and social media content, to the renowned Fifth Avenue windows and parties at L’Avenue at Saks.

Saks’ spring campaign featured Oscar-winning actress Lupita Nyong'o, highlighting the fun in fashion. Its fall campaign and NYFW party featured next-generation superstar Chlöe Bailey, celebrating seasonal trends.

For the holidays, Saks partnered with Sir Elton John, who shares its passion for self-expression through fashion, and donated $1 million to the Elton John AIDS Foundation. Saks’ holiday light show and window unveiling featured Sir Elton’s final live performance in North America.

“As a standalone ecommerce company, we’ve had an opportunity to reshape the way consumers engage with Saks,” Ms. Essner said.

“The Saks Fifth Avenue brand is iconic, and our marketing strategy aims to leverage our unmatched brand awareness, while appealing to the next generation of luxury customers,” she said.

“We are working to acquire and retain these new customers by demonstrating our fashion authority and delivering the elevated, seamless cross-channel experience for which Saks Fifth Avenue is known.”

Luxury Publisher of the Year: Condé Nast’s Vogue

While Instagram and TikTok have created media moguls out of celebrities and non-entities, there is something to be said about organized publishing and publishing houses that are luxury from top to toe. Condé Nast, a veteran of Luxury Daily’s top publishing honor, easily fits the bill of a publisher with assets and nous.

Few publishers in the past year upped the ante in luxury and fashion as Condé Nast did. Though not alone in the high-end space, the New York-based company’s Vogue magazine once again set the bar with advertising, cover coups and brand extensions.

Vogue’s U.S. edition bagged Serena Williams’ retirement announcement on its cover, generating much chatter across all media. Vogue Arabia celebrated its fifth anniversary and Vogue Japan nabbed Eve Jobs for the first cover under new head of editorial content, Tiffany Godoy.

Also, in a sign of increasing synchronicity across Vogue titles worldwide, the French, Spanish and Italian editions collaborated on a common June-July issue. Was it cost saving or a stroke of brilliance? It does not matter. What does is that they found common ground to appeal to European audiences in a world flush with digital verbiage.

British Vogue, under Edward Enninful, has taken a hammer to several glass walls.

This year alone, the London-based edition featured Linda Evangelista post-cosmetic surgery, Beyoncé, Naomi Campbell and her baby, and a purple Queen Elizabeth II cover to commemorate her platinum jubilee in its lineup. There was also an issue with only African models on its cover, as well as a Pride issue with a cast of gay women and men, trans, nonbinary and queer people as cover stars. Talk of pushing boundaries with élan.

In terms of events, the Met Gala can be considered Vogue global editorial boss Anna Wintour’s finest hour, guaranteed to generate reams of publicity. This past year’s event was true to form. Add to that the new Vogue World: New York fashion week event that itself was an event to remember.

What Vogue proves, with all its initiatives, is that it is relevant. It still sets the tone for fashion. For that, it deserves Luxury Daily’s Luxury Publisher of the Year award.

Vogue sister publication Architectural Digest, under editor in chief Amy Astley, also deserves special mention.

The title, also known as AD, has tilted perceptibly to the luxury real estate industry with special advertising features every few issues. It is alone in the design publication world to capture this revenue potential from listings of luxury homes across the world. Ad-page count is up, and so are unique views for its AD Pro professional edition and ecommerce revenues.

Luxury Market Researcher of the Year: Bain & Company

Not much research out of the ordinary was produced in 2022. While platforms such as Lyst offered gobs of consumer data and others supported with trends, one management consultancy’s forecasts and analysis seems to have consistently hit the mark: Bain & Company.

It is evident that Bain’s numbers on luxury are holding up, whether it is through joint initiatives with Italian luxury lobby Altagamma or via standalone analysis. Many luxury brands rely on Bain’s predictions for the future, including warning bells and guiding lights.

Bain confidently predicts that the long-term outlook for luxury is healthy. The firm’s Milan-based analyst team estimates that the personal luxury goods market will touch $378 billion by 2025, with China playing a key role in the growth surge. Other research on millennial and Gen Z buying luxury goods sooner than previous cohorts and its digital-related data were also standout pieces of research relied on by marketers.

For numbers and predictions that held up, Bain wins Luxury Daily’s honor as Luxury Market Researcher of the Year.

Luxury Personality of the Year: Bernard Arnault, chairman/CEO, LVMH

While there were many newsmakers for this position – Stella McCartney for her sustainability advocacy that has reached new heights, Elon Musk for following his convictions and reshaping Twitter at the cost of Tesla’s reputation and stock price or Alessandro Michele for his sudden exit from Gucci after a transformational run – one name stands out: Bernard Arnault.

Who would have thought that 2022 would end with a luxury executive becoming the world’s richest person? Yes, Mr. Arnault was for many years nipping at the heels of Microsoft cofounder Bill Gates, Amazon’s Jeff Bezos and Tesla’s Mr. Musk. But his ascent to No. 1 was not simply happenstance, instead the result of a laser-focused strategy to grow his empire and offer outsized returns to investors in LVMH, which is the world’s largest luxury conglomerate with 77 brands including Louis Vuitton, Dior, Bulgari, Dom Perignon and Tiffany & Co.

Since his mid-1980s purchase of a near-broke Christian Dior, Mr. Arnault has scooped up luxury brand after brand from families, be they failing or just chugging along. He breathed new life into them and introduced new audiences to contemporized lines. In the process, the Paris-based executive has transformed fashion and leather goods, wines and spirits, perfumes and cosmetics, retail, travel and hospitality, watches and jewelry, and luxury marketing itself.

Mr. Arnault has critics galore. But his unique talent is to take a storied brand, rejuvenate it, commandeer all aspects of the supply chain, create desire for the product through astute marketing and positioning, and then charge a premium over and above competition to target aspirational and well-heeled customers.

It might be fair to say Mr. Arnault has made luxury a tad common, but that would be a disservice. He correctly understands that luxury has to move with the times, and now has more to do with culture than mere exclusivity and touting quality, both of which are considered givens. For that deftness, he is Luxury Daily’s Luxury Personality of the Year.

Who is Bernard Arnault? The 'wolf in cashmere' passes Elon Musk as world's richest person - Yahoo Finance,"Wed, 14 Dec 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy93aG8taXMtYmVybmFyZC1hcm5hdWx0LXBhc3Nlcy1lbG9uLW11c2std29ybGRzLXJpY2hlc3QtcGVyc29uLTE2MDI1ODQ0Ny5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Luxury goods mogul Bernard Arnault is now the richest man in the world, bumping Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk down to the second spot, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.

Arnault, who is chairman and chief executive of Louis Vuitton SE or LVMH (LVMUY), has seen more than a $7 billion loss in net worth in 2022 while LVMH stock is off roughly 6.58% during the same time period. It hasn't been enough to keep him from taking the top spot, though, given that Musk's net worth has plummeted more than $100 billion in 2022.

The French businessman has a net worth of $171 billion, which is more than 5% of France's economy, compared to a net worth $164 billion for Musk.

Who is Bernard Arnault? The 'wolf in cashmere'

Arnault, who is known as “the wolf in cashmere,” was born in the French city of Roubaix.

He joined his family’s construction business in 1971 and moved to the U.S. in 1981 when the socialists came to power in France.

Back then, he was considered a “a little-known real-estate developer trying to expand his venerable French family's influence in New Rochelle, N.Y,” according to a New York Times article from 1989.

Arnault entered the luxury market in 1984 with an acquisition of a near-bankrupt French textile company that owned Christian Dior.

He later sold the company’s other businesses and used the money to buy a controlling stake in LVMH, which was at that point a merger between Louis Vuitton and champagne and cognac maker Moët Hennessy.

Arnault then ousted the Louis Vuitton president and took over, a strategy he repeated over the years. The luxury goods conglomerate owns Louis Vuitton, Christian Dior, Givenchy, Marc Jacobs, and more.

In January 2021, LVMH acquired jewelry company Tiffany & Co. for $15.8 billion.

While his “brash American-style” approach to business was criticized by the French press in the past, he’s described by The Telegraph as a man of refined taste: He’s a classical pianist, an art collector, and a noted philanthropist. The French billionaire donated roughly $212 million in 2019 to help rebuild the Notre Dame in Paris after it endured a massive fire.

Story continues

And unlike Musk, Arnault prefers to stay under the radar. After some Twitter accounts started tracking private planes of French billionaires to raise climate change awareness, Arnault elected to sell his private jet.

“Indeed, with all these stories, the group had a plane and we sold it,” Arnault told an LVMH-owned radio station. “The result now is that no one can see where I go because I rent planes when I use private planes.”

LVMH-owned beauty brand Cha Ling closes offline stores in China - Dao Insights,"Thu, 08 Dec 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vZGFvaW5zaWdodHMuY29tL25ld3MvbHZtaC1vd25lZC1iZWF1dHktYnJhbmQtY2hhLWxpbmctY2xvc2VzLW9mZmxpbmUtc3RvcmVzLWluLWNoaW5hL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Cha Ling, a high-end skincare brand owned by French luxury conglomerate LVMH, has closed all its independent offline stores in the Chinese market.

According to Jiemian News, Cha Ling stated that the store shift is part of the brand’s operation plan and from now on will be sold in Sephora as an exclusive brand in China. Apart from the closure of its physical stores, the brand has also closed down its official Wechat store online.

In contrast to its 15-year plan, Cha Ling’s global expansion has been relatively slow since its debut in the market. From entering China in 2017 to closing its last offline store at Xingye Taikoo Hui in 2022, it had only opened a total of three stores in the nation – with only one located outside of Shanghai. Moreover, the Tmall flagship store did not launch until 2021. Cha Ling underperformed many high-end brands including Fresh and Guerlain, both of which belong to the LVMH group.

Meanwhile, Sephora has taken the Sino-French luxury skincare brand under its wing. In fact, Sephora showcased its products at a booth under the theme of “Reconnection” at China’s 5th CIIE.

“Sephora China is a platform that integrates East and West, offering trendy beauty items from all over the world. At the same time, we are dedicated to providing Chinese consumers with cutting-edge products,” said Maggie Chan, Managing Director of LVMH – Sephora Greater China.

“Developed by LVMH Research Center, Cha Ling organically blends together Chinese and French culture to preserve China’s cultural and spiritual heritage, further deepening our connection with the local Chinese market.”

In the past year, Sephora has continued to embrace more Chinese brands as competition heats up in the domestic market. Several of these brands are leveraging the French cosmetics retailers’ overseas sales channels to go global. As of July 2022, Cha Ling reached cumulative sales of 100 million RMB ($14 million) within Sephora channels.

By joining hands with Sephora, therefore, LVMH-owned skincare brand Cha Ling aims to continue developing more innovative products that cater to the local needs as well as the luxurious taste of Chinese consumers.

Elon Musk Loses 'World's Richest Person' Title To LVMH Mogul Bernard Arnault - Maxim,"Wed, 07 Dec 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1heGltLmNvbS9uZXdzL2Vsb24tbXVzay1icmllZmx5LWxvc2VzLXdvcmxkcy1yaWNoZXN0LXBlcnNvbi10aXRsZS10by1sdm1oLW1vZ3VsLWJlcm5hcmQtYXJuYXVsdC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Elon Musk Loses ‘World’s Richest Person’ Title To LVMH Mogul Bernard Arnault

Twitter owner and Tesla boss Elon Musk briefly lost his title of world’s richest person on Wednesday after a plunge in the value of his stake in the electric carmaker and his controversial, $44 billion purchase of the social media site.

Bernard Arnault, the CEO of luxury brand Louis Vuitton’s parent company LVMH, briefly snatched the title of world’s richest person before falling back to No. 2 with a personal wealth of $185.3 billion, according to Forbes.

LVMH’s sales and profits have soared 500 percent under Arnault’s leadership, and the company now has over 70 fashion and beauty titles in its luxe portfolio. In January 2021, LVMH-acquired jeweler Tiffany & Co. for $15.8 billion, believed to be the biggest luxury brand acquisition ever.

Arnault controls about half of LVMH, and its fashion brands include Christian Dior, Fendi, Givenchy, Marc Jacobs, Stella McCartney, Loewe, Loro Piana, Kenzo, Celine, Sephora, Princess Yachts, TAG Heuer watches, Bulgari and Tiffany & Co.

Musk, who has held the top spot on the Forbes list since September 2021, has an estimated net worth of $185.7 billion. Musk previously seized the world’s richest person title from Amazon.com founder Jeff Bezos.

Tesla shares, which have lost more than 47 percent in value since Musk made his offer to buy Twitter earlier this year, were down 2.7 percent, according to Forbes.

Musk’s net worth dropped below $200 billion earlier on November 8 as investors dumped Tesla’s shares, reportedly after widespread worries that the boss and biggest shareholder of the world’s most valuable electric carmaker has recently been preoccupied with running Twitter.

Musk recently made headlines for suspending Kanye West’s Twitter account after the troubled rap mogul–now known as Ye–shared an anti-semitic tweet.

Tesla has reportedly lost nearly half its market value and Musk’s net worth has dropped by about $70 billion since he bid for Twitter in April.

Besides Tesla, Musk also runs rocket firm SpaceX and Neuralink, a startup that is developing futuristic brain-machine interfaces to connect the human brain to computers.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.994831383228302}",neutral,0.994831383228302,0

LVMH's Bernard Arnault Surpasses Elon Musk as the World's Richest Person - Yahoo Life,"Fri, 09 Dec 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnlhaG9vLmNvbS9saWZlc3R5bGUvbHZtaC1iZXJuYXJkLWFybmF1bHQtc3VycGFzc2VzLWVsb24tMjIxNTAwNTE1Lmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Back in October 2021, Elon Musk’s net worth surpassed a bonkers $300 billion, making him the world’s first person to reach the milestone and the richest at that time. This week, the Tesla and SpaceX CEO has been supplanted as the world’s richest person by LVMH CEO, Bernard Arnault.

The French businessman has held the title four times before—in December 2019, January 2020 as well as May and July of 2021. He surpassed Jeff Bezos as the world’s richest person last summer with a net worth of $186.3 billion. When the markets closed on Thursday, the tycoon’s net worth was reportedly $186.2 billion—$1.2 billion more than Musk’s estimated net worth of $185 million. Musk may still top the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, but who knows for how much longer.

More from Robb Report

Given all the controversy around Musk’s $44 billion Twitter takeover—and one strange nightstand image—you’d be forgiven for thinking his choices have disrupted his finances. (And you might be right.) Yet even as Arnault’s net worth surpassed Musk’s twice on Wednesday, the Tesla leader regained the top spot by the time markets closed, with an estimated $185.4 billion that edged out Arnault’s $184.7 billion, according to Forbes.

The roles reversed on Thursday, however, with Arnault’s estimated net worth standing at a reported $185.1 billion as of 9:30 am. Musk’s net worth trailed behind at $184.1 billion. Why? Tesla shares opened trading on Thursday down by one percent, after Bloomberg reported Wednesday evening that Musk may replace some of Twitter’s debt with a personal margin loan. The loan would reportedly be backed by shares of Tesla. This news caused a drop in the marque’s stock, which opened the door for Arnault to surpass Musk in Forbes rankings.

LVMH has enjoyed robust business of late, not doubt bolstering Arnault’s staggering wealth. In October, the conglomerate—which owns Louis Vuitton, Bulgari and Tiffany & Co., among other luxury brands—saw strong third-quarter sales, leading to a rise in luxury shares despite gloomy forecasts by economists. Musk’s messy Twitter takeover, meanwhile, has weighed heavily on Tesla’s stock since he first announced the deal on April 14 (before he attempted to back out of the deal). The marque’s shares are down more than 50 percent this year with nearly all of the drop happening after his initial Twitter takeover announcement.

Musk planned to finance the acquisition of Twitter, in part, with a $6.3 billion personal margin loan. In the end, he scrapped the loan and instead financed the rest of the purchase with his own cash and $8 billion of equity, reports Forbes. Tech stocks have now crashed since mid-April, which means Twitter is likely worth less now than the $44 billion price tag Musk initially agreed to pay.

Whether the outspoken CEO will end up back on top as the world’s richest person remains is an open question. But experts believe the latest reports don’t look good for him—or Tesla investors.

LVMH's Sidney Toledano Talks Luxury Recruiting Challenges - WWD,"Tue, 13 Dec 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3dkLmNvbS9mYXNoaW9uLW5ld3MvZmFzaGlvbi1zY29vcHMvbHZtaC1zaWRuZXktdG9sZWRhbm8tcmltYS1hYmR1bC1tYWxhay0xMjM1NDQ3NjY5L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS — Luxury association Comité Colbert brought brands and big names together to promote careers in craftsmanship to students.

Sidney Toledano, LVMH Fashion Group chair and newly elected president of the Chambre Syndicale de la Haute Couture, joined French Minister of Culture Rima Abdul Malak on stage, along with Minister for Education and Vocational Training Carole Grandjean and Minister for Small and Medium Enterprises, Trade, Crafts and Tourism Olivia Gregoire.

The afternoon panel closed the three-day educational fair “Les de(ux)mains du luxe,” Comité Colbert’s clever play on words referencing the future of handicrafts.

Despite business booming for the luxury sector, companies across the board have expressed difficulty in recruiting young artisans to carry forward traditional methods.

Toledano reminded the crowd that Louis Vuitton, Coco Chanel, Christian Dior and Louis-François Cartier were all artisans before they were “designers.”

“They were artisans, they were entrepreneurs, they were storytellers,” he said. “Their business power rested on their savoir faire.”

Toledano was careful to note that the day’s event was to continue the ongoing quest for education and elevation of craft. He said that in his youth he grew up surrounded by artisans, but young people today are more separated from craft.

“It’s a problem that exists for our industry,” he said. “How we transmit to the next generation is a real question — is it stronger word of mouth, marketing, storytelling? — to transmit the opportunities of these careers.”

Toledano said it’s the responsibility of government programs and the private sector luxury companies to raise the status of craftsmanship careers.

“The métiers de la main need to be reinvented and young people need to discover the métiers d’art — they are in constant evolution, innovation and we need to transmit the idea of savoir faire,” said Minister Malak.

Malak said the French government is committed to five pillars of promotion for craftsmanship: spreading knowledge of the professions; education and internships alongside experienced craftspeople; investing in innovation and new technology to transmit age-old techniques before the disappear; ensuring crafts are not just centered in Paris but dispersed throughout France, and finally, that they grow internationally as well.

She cited cross-cultural programs to promote French craftsmanship in the U.S. and Japan and said the government is establishing residency programs in Africa and China to train artisans abroad.

“There’s a great potential of not just exporting our French savoir faire, but also learning from other countries and creating exchanges and cooperating with them, because it’s also this cooperation that will help reaching new markets, new citizens that are interested in it, and also pushing the boundaries of sustainability in this field and innovation in this field,” said Malak.

Other guests included LVMH director of craftsmanship development Alexandre Boquel, Van Cleef & Arpels president Nicolas Bos, Christofle president Emilie Metge and Hermès director of human resources Vincent Vaillant.

“Luxury is one of the things France is most known for — along with maybe football and cooking,” joked Christofle’s Metge. “We know how to celebrate luxury and savoir faire, but the most important thing we have to keep in mind is that luxury, without the next generation, can die out.”

Panelists agreed that government investment in manufacturing is important, but that educating and recruiting the next generation is key to keeping luxury alive. While business has been booming and luxury companies have been recording record profits, recruitment remains a weak link.

All of the panelists agreed that while craftsmanship is at the core, communication is the key.

“We have to be able to transmit to the next gen to be sure that we can stay at the top level of manufacturing and the way to design products and luxury goods,” said Metge, adding that luxury cannot continue to gate keep.

“We need to transmit to the new generation, but be sure that you don’t ‘own’ the savoir faire and that you are here to pass it on to the next generation. Be more democratic — able to talk to any generation and not only in one luxury, very high and elitist category, but we need to talk to teenagers. This is the most important message that we want to have today,” she added.

Students tend to focus on the ideas of being a designer or stylist, but students interested in the art of fashion often don’t know about the work that goes on behind the scenes.

“These types of professions, in the past, have been hidden,” said LVMH’s Boquel. “There’s been an opposition between the abstract professions versus the manual professions. The best way to change this is to communicate about the image we have. We want to showcase the beauty of the professions and to explain that there is expansion of development for talent. It’s a huge opportunity for you to create your professional path within luxury.”

Following the panel, Toledano toured the room at Paris’ innovation hub Station F, visiting various stations from some of the 23 luxury brands on show. LVMH presented the programs of its Institut des Métiers d’Excellence, Van Cleef & Arpels offered a workshop to promote its L’Ecole des Arts Joailliers, while Cartier presented its Haute École de Joaillerie.

Léonard demonstrated pattern making, Chanel showed the creation of a bag, and Christofle demonstrated gilding techniques.

Toledano even stopped by the Dior display to speak with a seamstress who was working on a tulle couture gown.

The event wrapped up a three-day educational fair that brought more than 4,000 students to learn about métiers d’art at the hands of the luxury fashion houses.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999579191207886}",neutral,0.9999579191207886,0
Antoine Arnault Takes on Additional Role at LVMH Family Holding - Yahoo Canada Sports,"Fri, 09 Dec 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vY2Euc3BvcnRzLnlhaG9vLmNvbS9uZXdzL2FudG9pbmUtYXJuYXVsdC10YWtlcy1hZGRpdGlvbmFsLXJvbGUtMDg0MzE3MjM3Lmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Further locking in family control over the LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton luxury empire, Antoine Arnault has been appointed chief executive officer of holding company Christian Dior SE, which controls LVMH, and vice chairman of its board of directors.

The appointment comes in tandem with the conversion of Financière Agache, Bernard Arnault’s main holding company, into a limited joint-stock partnership.

More from WWD

Initiated last July, the conversion is designed to hand control of the entity to his five children: Delphine Arnault, Antoine Arnault, Alexandre Arnault, Frédéric Arnault and Jean Arnault.

All of them work for LVMH brands — including Louis Vuitton, Tiffany & Co. and Tag Heuer — and are in line to eventually succeed their father as head of the group.

Last April, LVMH shareholders voted 81.6 percent in favor of a resolution to extend to 80 the age limit for its longtime chairman and CEO, Bernard Arnault, who is 73. Previously, the company’s bylaws fixed 75 as the age limit for serving as CEO.

At Christian Dior SE, Antoine Arnault takes over from Sidney Toledano, who decided to leave the executive management position. The changes were approved at a meeting of its nominations and compensation committee in Paris on Thursday night.

In a brief release issued Friday morning, Bernard Arnault, who is chairman of the board of directors of Christian Dior SE, said he joined the other board members to “warmly thank Sidney Toledano for the utmost professionalism he has always demonstrated while serving this mandate of trust.”

“I was really touched,” said Toledano, who continues in his role as chairman and CEO of LVMH Fashion Group, which includes Celine, Loewe, Givenchy, Kenzo, Pucci, Marc Jacobs, Patou and Moynat. “My mission continues at LVMH, working for the group and for the family.”

Sidney Toledano

Toledano, who ran Christian Dior Couture, the fashion house, for 20 years, held the same title at the holding company Christian Dior SE for the same amount of time. “Mission accomplished, and I’m happy it’s Antoine; someone from the family. It makes sense,” Toledano said.

(Christian Dior Couture has been headed by chairman and CEO Pietro Beccari since 2017.)

Antoine Arnault takes on the new title in addition to his roles as CEO of Berluti, chairman of Loro Piana and head of communication, image and environment at LVMH.

“This choice was made in the context of the conversion of Agache SE into a limited joint-stock partnership, which occurred on [Dec. 6], and will permit the long-term family control over Christian Dior SE and LVMH Moët Hennessy — Louis Vuitton SE to be perpetuated,” Friday’s statement said.

Dior SE is a listed company that is highly symbolic for the family, as Christian Dior was one of the linchpin acquisitions by Bernard Arnault that initiated the construction of the world’s biggest luxury company.

Agache is the controlling shareholder of Christian Dior SE and LVMH SE. The Arnault family group cumulatively controls 48 percent of LVMH’s capital and 63.7 percent of its voting rights, according to stock market regulator AMF. Meanwhile, it holds 97.5 percent of the capital of Christian Dior SE, which controls LVMH, and 98.4 percent of voting rights.

"The World's New Richest Man, Bernard Arnault, Is Hardly Better Than Elon Musk - Jacobin magazine","Wed, 14 Dec 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vamFjb2Jpbi5jb20vMjAyMi8xMi9iZXJuYXJkLWFybmF1bHQtd29ybGQtbmV3LXJpY2hlc3QtbWFuLWx2bWgtYmlsbGlvbmFpcmXSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"But hold your applause for Arnault. Just as liberals’ white-hot hate for Trump led to misplaced admiration for “normal conservatives” like George W. Bush, it’s a mistake to prefer a “ drama-free ” old world European oligarch so you can go back to brunch.

The Musk-dunking is understandable on some level. Since taking over as CEO of Twitter in October, the clown prince of Big Tech has behaved a bit like a Gen-X Donald Trump, a billionaire bad boy who makes business and personnel decisions based on arbitrary whims or wounds to his Mars-sized ego. In contrast, “Bernard Arnault lives his life as most of us might with those billions: buying art, throwing parties, helping to rebuild Notre Dame, not trolling,” tweeted a former Obama staffer turned CNN analyst.

News of Musk’s cash flow slippage has struck some liberals and leftists as cause for celebration, prompting a round of high-fives on social media. “French sophistication beats US clueless hi-tech,” read one tweet from a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council.

Thanks to the short-circuiting of Tesla’s share prices, Elon Musk is no longer Earth’s richest man. The new holder of the inglorious title of the world’s wealthiest man is LVMH CEO Bernard Arnault.

Feeling the Wrong Kind of Bern

Arnault’s bio as if assembled by typing the phrases “rich French guy” and “Bond villain” into OpenAI’s newfangled chatbot program.

He grew up wealthy in Northern France, but panicked after François Mitterrand got elected the first socialist president in 1981 and fled to Ronald Reagan’s Wall Street–friendly America at age thirty-two. That self-imposed exile lasted only a couple of years as he returned to his home country in 1983 to purchase the Boussac empire, a textile and retail conglomerate that owned the Dior fashion house.

In 2012, Arnault planned to leave his home again in objection to rising taxes, but seemingly got shamed into staying by the country’s press, which had already dubbed him “The Terminator” for his ruthless business practices, including laying off nine thousand workers. This time, they called him a traitor for seeking Belgian citizenship for tax avoidance.

Today, the seventy-three-year-old Parisian and his five trust-fund kids oversee LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, or just LVMH for short. The multinational corporation is a who’s who of overpriced luxury fashion and cosmetics brands, including Christian Dior, Marc Jacobs, and Sephora. Also among LVMH’s seventy holdings are a British yacht maker that markets $3 million boats and a champagne company that sells thousand-dollar bottles of bubbly encased in white gold.

Arnault’s fortune keeps climbing as he strengthens his monopoly on shit that rich people buy. LVMH dropped $3.2 billion in 2019 for luxury hotelier Belmond, which owns or manages forty-six hotels — including the only hotel within the Machu Picchu citadel in Southern Peru. Then last January, LVMH gobbled up American jeweler Tiffany & Co for a cool $15.8 billion, believed to be the biggest luxury brand acquisition ever.

During the COVID pandemic, the richer got richer than at any point in recorded history, according to the World Bank. Arnault was one of the world’s ten wealthiest men, who collectively doubled their fortunes from $700 billion to $1.5 trillion — at a rate of $15,000 per second or $1.3 billion daily. Arnault’s yacht of cash grew from $76 billion in 2020 to $188 billion just two years later.

More broadly, the global 1 percent — those with more than $1 million — now own nearly half (45.8 percent) of the world’s wealth. So what are these millionaires doing with all of their ill-gotten cash? Besides flying to space, buying private police forces, and prepping for the dystopia they helped create, they’re also purchasing the old material markers of wealth sold by Arnault’s companies, like a $20 million diamond necklace.

All things considered, Arnault’s rise is no cause for celebration. Sure, he has more refined taste than Elon Musk and isn’t taunting the Left on his new plaything Twitter, but his ascension to the throne is yet another sign that today’s Gilded Age: Part II may yet surpass the nineteenth-century original.

Arnault himself likes to cite the history of the eighteenth century. In a Forbes profile, he’s quoted as saying that he sees himself linked to the French heritage of “Versailles, to Marie Antoinette.” In that case, maybe it’s time to get the old Revolution-era Jacobin band back together. Or, at the very least, echo the French newspaper Libération, which once told Arnault in a front-page headline to “Get Lost You Rich Idiot.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9994226694107056}",neutral,0.9994226694107056,0
"Ben Bridge, Cartier, LVMH Join Effort to Combat Racism in Retail - National Jeweler","Mon, 19 Dec 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vbmF0aW9uYWxqZXdlbGVyLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy8xMTU0OC1iZW4tYnJpZGdlLWNhcnRpZXItbHZtaC1qb2luLWVmZm9ydC10by1jb21iYXQtcmFjaXNtLWluLXJldGFpbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"New York—Nonprofit Open to All recently welcomed 42 new retail brands retailers to its fight against racism in retail, including a few notable jewelry companies.The companies signed the organization’s “Mitigate Racial Bias in Retail” charter, a commitment to reduce racially biased experiences and unfair treatment in stores and create a more welcoming environment for shoppers.The fine jewelry sellers that are newcomers to the initiative are Ben Bridge Jeweler, Cartier, and LVMH.“For 110 years, we have believed in being a part of the fabric of each community in which we operate,” said Lisa Bridge, president and CEO of Ben Bridge Jeweler.“To us, that means embracing all members of the community and Open to All helps us both communicate that and to continue to learn and grow.”Other new signees include CBL Properties, Glossier, The Body Shop, Yelp, and URBN, the parent company of Anthropologie, Free People, Nuuly, and Urban Outfitters.The charter was launched in May by Open to All and LVMH-owned Sephora after the beauty company commissioned its “Racial Bias in Retail” study, which explored how shoppers who are Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC) are discriminated against in stores.In 2019, Sephora closed its stores for an hour to host an “inclusivity workshop” after R&B star SZA, who is a Black woman, said an employee in a California location told a security guard to follow her to make sure she wasn’t stealing.The company issued an apology and has since taken steps to combat racial profiling and discrimination in its stores.Two in five U.S. shoppers surveyed for the report said they have personally experienced unfair treatment based on their race or skin tone. BIPOC shoppers were three times more likely than white shoppers to feel judged based on their appearance.The charter began with 28 retailers on board and now has the support of more than 200 national and state public education organizations and elected officials as well as thousands of businesses and nonprofit service providers.Tiffany & Co., Movado Group, Michele, and Watch Station International joined the pledge previously. A full list of members is available on the organization’s website.“This cross-collaboration is key in working to address and prevent systemic racism in U.S. retail environments and the culture at-large,” said George-Axelle Broussillon Matschinga, vice president of diversity, equity, and inclusion at Sephora.Since the charter’s founding, the nonprofit said it has been contacted by more retailers who are aware of how pervasive discrimination is in retail and want to help address the problem and create welcoming spaces for their customers.“LVMH is proud to sign the Mitigate Racial Bias in Retail Charter alongside many of our maisons, including the co-initiator Sephora, to drive lasting change in the retail industry,” said Anish Melwani, chairman and CEO of LVMH North America.“LVMH creates products that maintain a standard of excellence by bringing together diverse talent, skills, and experiences to serve all of our customers. Signing the charter is an actionable step in our ongoing commitment to eradicating racism from the retail experience and ensuring that all of our customers feel valued and respected in our stores.”Open to All Director Calla Rongerude expressed her gratitude to the retail partners, noting that a key factor in eliminating racism in retail is preventing exclusionary treatment before shoppers even get to the store.“Open to All is grateful to our corporate and nonprofit partners, who are demonstrating a commitment to training their workforce, diversifying marketing and product assortment, and taking other tangible steps that create a culture of belonging for BIPOC shoppers and employees,” she said.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999737739562988}",neutral,0.9999737739562988,0
3 Luxury Stocks to Buy That Could Thrive in a 2023 Recession - The Motley Fool,"Sun, 11 Dec 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIyLzEyLzExLzMtbHV4dXJ5LXN0b2Nrcy10by1idXktdGhhdC1jb3VsZC10aHJpdmUtaW4tYS0yMDIzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"People with money keep on spending during tough economic times.

Worried about a recession in 2023? No wonder. The ""R"" word has been pumped on media outlets as 2022 draws to a close. With inflation still running hot, there's worry that what has been a resilient consumer up to this point could finally tighten up on spending and induce an economic downturn.

But even among consumer goods stocks, there's a way to play defense: luxury brands. Realistically, recessions have a much lower impact on wealthy households, so popular high-end goods tend to continue performing pretty well -- especially if the recession is mild as is broadly expected next year. If you're looking to play defense with your consumer discretionary stocks, you can put the rich to work in your portfolio and profit.

With that in mind, LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton (LVMUY -1.91%), Tapestry (TPR -2.93%), and Lululemon Athletica (LULU -2.38%) are three luxury stocks that could thrive even if a recession strikes in 2023.

LVMH: Good news for the world's largest house of luxury brands

The world's largest luxury conglomerate, LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, was already having a pretty decent 2022. Through the first nine months of the year, revenue across all five of its segments (wine and spirits, fashion and leather, perfumes and cosmetics, watches and jewelry, and selective retailing) grew at a strong double-digit pace. Overall sales jumped 28% compared to 2021 to 56.5 billion euros, a new record as LVMH's 75 ""maisons"" fully recovered from pandemic lockdowns and then some.

In a sign of just how well things have been going, LVMH co-founder and CEO Bernard Arnault and family have retaken the ""world's richest person"" spot from Elon Musk, according to the Forbe's Billionaire List.

Will the good times keep strutting down the runway for LVMH, though? It seems they certainly could, in part because of a development in Asia. After social unrest, China is ending parts of its ""zero-COVID"" policy, a strict set of rules that have sunk the most populous country's economy. Not incidentally, China is the second-largest market for luxury goods, accounting for tens of billions of dollars in spending in normal times. There's optimism that some normalcy might be coming back.

As of this writing, LVMH stock trades for 26 times trailing 12-month earnings per share. If double-digit sales and earnings growth continue -- and according to management's commentary they could -- it isn't an unreasonable price tag.

Tapestry: An American luxury icon making a comeback

I'll admit I used to follow Tapestry -- the parent organization of Coach, Kate Spade, and Stuart Weitzman -- much more closely. But it fell off my radar as Coach (the original corporate name before the rebrand to Tapestry) had a messy go of things integrating its acquisitions of Stuart Weitzman (2015) and Kate Spade (2017). Shares have underperformed the market as a result.

Tapestry has rebounded nicely from an early pandemic slump, though, and sales are actually at all-time highs. For fiscal 2023, management is expecting a slight decline off of these highs due to a record run-up in the U.S. dollar (which lowers the value of international sales when converted back into dollars for financial reporting).

However, in spite of this challenge, earnings per share are expected to rise in the mid-single-digit percentage range this year, helped by an estimated $700 million in share repurchases. And much like LVMH, Coach will also see some lift if China's zero-COVID policies help the economy recover again.

In all, this iconic American leather designer is in decent shape right now. And while earnings growth may not be much to show off to your friends, Tapestry stock looks cheap at less than 12 times trailing 12-month earnings per share. Who knew a leather handbag (stock) could be so affordable? If you're looking for a solid luxury retailer to help weather challenging times, Tapestry could be your ticket.

Lululemon: Part luxury, part everyday comfort for the active enthusiast

Perhaps Lululemon doesn't spring to mind as a house of ""luxury."" Yet I'd argue luxury is more than price (though a pair of women's yoga leggings are easily over $100, but I digress). Luxury is about comfort as much as it is a symbol of how much money can be blown on superfluous items. And in that department, Lululemon excels.

The blend of high-end activewear and comfort is clearly winning over fans. To wit, Lululemon just released Q3 2022 earnings, and revenue was up a sizzling 28% year-over-year, driven by an impressive 22% increase in comparable sales (a blend of foot and web traffic and average customer ticket). International revenue jumped 41% in the quarter as Lululemon stretches its reach outside of its core North American market. China's reopening could help this metric continue running hot too.

One of my favorite things about Lululemon's business model, though, is its robust profit margins. Its Q3 operating margin was 19%. A typical clothing retailer is doing well if it puts up high-single-digit or low-teens operating margins. Often running close to or over 20% in recent years, Lululemon's lucrative profitability is further proof this is a luxury brand at heart -- but one finding more mass appeal.

The shares did take a slight dip after the last earnings update due to weaker-than-expected Q4 guidance. Management thinks revenue will increase ""only"" 25% year-over-year. This is likely just a cool down as the stock has rallied more than 20% the last couple of months. Lululemon currently trades for 37 times expected adjusted earnings per share for 2022, a premium price tag. But for a company that has consistently grown as fast as this one the last few years, it could be a worthwhile purchase here.

Recession or not, Lululemon is clearly doing something right that's resonating with its patrons.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.7307140231132507}",neutral,0.7307140231132507,0

The primacy of Tuscany as a hub for luxury leather goods is thus reconfirmed, a status that continues to attract big brands and therefore big investments to the region but also allows the preservation of artisanal skills handed down from generation to generation that constitute priceless human capital.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9996292591094971}",neutral,0.9996292591094971,0

PARIS (Reuters) -Antoine Arnault, LVMH chairman Bernard Arnault's eldest son, was on Friday named chief executive of family holding company Christian Dior SE, replacing veteran executive Sidney Toledano and stirring speculations of succession at the group.

Christian Dior is a listed company that owns the bulk of the Arnault family's stake in LVMH , the world's largest luxury group.

The move raises the stature of 45-year-old Antoine, one of Arnault's five children, all of whom hold senior positions in LVMH, the group behind fashion houses Louis Vuitton and Christian Dior, as well as labels ranging from champagne to five-star hotels.

His appointment follows a change in the legal structure of the family's investment to ensure its control of LVMH, with holding company Agache, which owns shares in Christian Dior SE, becoming a joint-stock partnership on Tuesday.

The tightening of the family's grip on its empire also comes amid a wave of high-profile successions in other fashion companies in Europe.

Earlier this week, Italian fashion group Prada named former Luxottica chief Andrea Guerra as CEO as part of a strategy to ease a transition at the helm to the next generation of the founding family.

At Zara-owner Inditex, Marta Ortega, the youngest daughter of its founder Amancio Ortega, became chairperson in July.

At LVMH, Antoine Arnault, a business school graduate and a board member since 2006, oversees the group's communications and environmental issues, driving efforts to shore up its reputation.

He is married to Russian supermodel Natalia Vodianova and often makes presentations on the group's environmental efforts and hosts events such as public tours of workshops and factories.

For the past decade, he has been chief executive of high-end label Berluti, known for buffed leather shoes priced at more than $2,000, and bespoke tailoring for men. He is also the chairman of Italian label Loro Piana.

LVMH chairman and CEO Bernard Arnault, 73, has not publicly named his successor to lead the sprawling luxury empire he built through acquisitions starting with Christian Dior.

The fashion label was folded into the LVMH group in 2017, and Christian Dior SE now holds 41% of LVMH, corresponding to 56% of the voting rights in the group.

Bernard Arnault, who often speaks at company events and last week attended a dinner at the White House with French President Emmanuel Macron, has shown no signs he plans to step down soon.

LVMH in April raised the maximum age of its chief executive officer to 80 from 75.

Antoine and his older sister Delphine, 47, are children from their father's first marriage. Both are on the group's board of directors.

Alexandre Arnault, 30, is an executive at Tiffany & Co. while Frederic Arnault, 27, is chief executive of TAG Heuer. The youngest, Jean Arnault, 24, heads marketing and product development for Louis Vuitton's watches division.

Bernard Arnault and his family briefly took the title as the world's richest earlier this week but were back at No. 2, behind Elon Musk, with a personal wealth of $185.3 billion, according to Forbes.

This time, though, it’s the eldest son of LVMH chairman Bernard Arnault in the spotlight instead of Kendall or Roman.

Antoine Arnault was named CEO of Christian Dior SE and vice chairman of its board of directors at the end of last week. The family holding company owns the majority of the Arnaults’ stake in luxury titan LVMH. Arnault will replace veteran executive Sidney Toledano as outlined in a brief statement shared by the company on Friday, December 9.

The appointment comes after Bernard Arnault’s main holding company, Financière Agache, became a joint-stock partnership last Tuesday. The change in the legal structure of the family’s investment was made to ensure its long-term control of LVMH. All five Arnault children now hold senior positions within the French company.

As for the rest of the heirs, Delphine Arnault is on LVMH’s board of directors, Alexandre Arnault is an executive at Tiffany & Co., Frederic Arnault is chief executive of TAG Heuer and Jean Arnault takes care of marketing and product development for Louis Vuitton’s watches division.

Story continues

The children could be in for a bit of a wait, though. Their father, who has an estimated net worth of $186 billion, has shown no signs he’s ready to relinquish the top spot. LVMH also changed the maximum age of its CEO from 75 to 80. That means 73-year-old Bernard has a few years left yet.

Founded in 2016, Cha Ling is a luxury skin care brand based on pu’er tea culled from China‘s Yunnan Province and developed into formulations in France.

After launching at Le Bon Marché in 2016, Cha Ling expanded to Hong Kong and mainland China in 2017. In the following years, Cha Ling opened three independent stores in Chinese shopping malls, including Shanghai HKRI Taikoo Hui, Shanghai IFC, and Hangzhou’s MixC Mall.

According to Dianping, the Chinese version of Yelp, Cha Ling’s Pudong and Hangzhou stores have closed in recent years. The brand announced the closure of the HKRI Taikoo Hui store this June as the city emerged from a two-month lockdown. The store closure was aimed at “optimizing the brand’s retail strategy,” according to Cha Ling’s official Wechat account.

After ceasing independent stores’ operations, Cha Ling closed its Wechat Mini Program store, but the brand still operates an official Tmall store.

Cha Ling products can also be found in more than 310 Sephora stores in 87 Chinese cities. According to the LVMH-owned beauty retailer, sales at Sephora retail channels reached over 100 million renminbi, or $14 million, in the three years ending July.

Under Sephora, Cha Ling launched the Beau-Tea Class, a skin care workshop based on traditional acupressure massages and detoxification routines.

Cha Ling products are also featured in spas at five-star hotels, including Shanghai’s Peninsula Hotel, The Middle House Shanghai and Beijing’s Puxuan Hotel & Spa.

Cha Ling was founded by Laurent Boillot, who was Guerlain’s chief executive officer and is currently the chief executive officer of Maison Hennessy.

During a trip to Yunnan, Boillot met German ecologist Josef Margraf, who, with his wife, former journalist Minguo Li, was working on restoring the local biodiversity system.

After Margraf died in 2010, Boillot set on incubating the Cha Ling brand, which would carry on Margraf’s mission of reviving the natural ecosystem in Yunnan. A portion of Cha Ling’s profit goes to the Tea Garden project, which will continue to contribute to the reforestation and planting of tea trees in the Pu’er region of Yunnan.

This November, Cha Ling was showcased at the Sephora booth during the fifth edition of the CIIE fair. “We will continue to interact with Chinese consumers and develop more innovative products that cater to the local needs and to provide Chinese consumers with luxurious skin care experiences as well as genuinely memorable services,” Angela Shum, brand general manager of Cha Ling Greater China, said at the fair.

Cha Ling is not the first brand aimed at combining traditional Asian ingredients with Western skin care formulations.

In 2012, Estée Lauder launched Osiao, a premium skin care brand developed for the Chinese market. In 2019, Procter & Gamble set out to revive Oriental Therapy, a premium Chinese herbal medicine-inspired skin care brand initially launched in 2013.

This November, L’Oréal unveiled a K-beauty brand called Shihyo. The luxury skin care brand is infused with 24 herbal ingredients and combines fermented rice water and ginseng water.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999979734420776}",neutral,0.9999979734420776,0
LVMH's Bernard Arnault Surpasses Elon Musk as the World's Richest Person - Yahoo News,"Fri, 09 Dec 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vbmV3cy55YWhvby5jb20vbHZtaC1iZXJuYXJkLWFybmF1bHQtc3VycGFzc2VzLWVsb24tMjIxNTAwMTY2Lmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Back in October 2021, Elon Musk’s net worth surpassed a bonkers $300 billion, making him the world’s first person to reach the milestone and the richest at that time. This week, the Tesla and SpaceX CEO has been supplanted as the world’s richest person by LVMH CEO, Bernard Arnault.

The French businessman has held the title four times before—in December 2019, January 2020 as well as May and July of 2021. He surpassed Jeff Bezos as the world’s richest person last summer with a net worth of $186.3 billion. When the markets closed on Thursday, the tycoon’s net worth was reportedly $186.2 billion—$1.2 billion more than Musk’s estimated net worth of $185 billion. Musk may still top the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, but who knows for how much longer.

More from Robb Report

Given all the controversy around Musk’s $44 billion Twitter takeover—and one strange nightstand image—you’d be forgiven for thinking his choices have disrupted his finances. (And you might be right.) Yet even as Arnault’s net worth surpassed Musk’s twice on Wednesday, the Tesla leader regained the top spot by the time markets closed, with an estimated $185.4 billion that edged out Arnault’s $184.7 billion, according to Forbes.

The roles reversed on Thursday, however, with Arnault’s estimated net worth standing at a reported $185.1 billion as of 9:30 am. Musk’s net worth trailed behind at $184.1 billion. Why? Tesla shares opened trading on Thursday down by one percent, after Bloomberg reported Wednesday evening that Musk may replace some of Twitter’s debt with a personal margin loan. The loan would reportedly be backed by shares of Tesla. This news caused a drop in the marque’s stock, which opened the door for Arnault to surpass Musk in Forbes rankings.

LVMH has enjoyed robust business of late, not doubt bolstering Arnault’s staggering wealth. In October, the conglomerate—which owns Louis Vuitton, Bulgari and Tiffany & Co., among other luxury brands—saw strong third-quarter sales, leading to a rise in luxury shares despite gloomy forecasts by economists. Musk’s messy Twitter takeover, meanwhile, has weighed heavily on Tesla’s stock since he first announced the deal on April 14 (before he attempted to back out of the deal). The marque’s shares are down more than 50 percent this year with nearly all of the drop happening after his initial Twitter takeover announcement.

Musk planned to finance the acquisition of Twitter, in part, with a $6.3 billion personal margin loan. In the end, he scrapped the loan and instead financed the rest of the purchase with his own cash and $8 billion of equity, reports Forbes. Tech stocks have now crashed since mid-April, which means Twitter is likely worth less now than the $44 billion price tag Musk initially agreed to pay.

Whether the outspoken CEO will end up back on top as the world’s richest person remains is an open question. But experts believe the latest reports don’t look good for him—or Tesla investors.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9972649812698364}",neutral,0.9972649812698364,0
Bernard Arnault just became the world's richest person. So who is he? - CNN,"Thu, 15 Dec 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vMjAyMi8xMi8xNC9idXNpbmVzcy9iZXJuYXJkLWFybmF1bHQtcmljaGVzdC1wZXJzb24vaW5kZXguaHRtbNIBSmh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLmNubi5jb20vY25uLzIwMjIvMTIvMTQvYnVzaW5lc3MvYmVybmFyZC1hcm5hdWx0LXJpY2hlc3QtcGVyc29u?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"London CNN —

Bernard Arnault, the chairman of French luxury goods giant LVMH (LVMHF), has just become the first European to top Bloomberg’s list of the world’s richest people, relegating Elon Musk to second place.

Now worth $171 billion, Arnault’s wealth eclipsed the Tesla CEO’s $164 billion fortune on Tuesday, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Arnault had already ousted Musk from the top spot on Forbes’ list of “Real Time Billionaires” last week.

Musk’s net worth has tumbled by $107 billion this year, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Arnault’s wealth, which stems from his controlling stake in LVMH, has suffered a more modest $7 billion decline.

The divergence is partly down to the stock performance of the companies in which the pair own shares. Musk’s purchase of Twitter (TWTR) hasn’t helped either. Still, he is in no imminent danger of falling further down the list: His fortune remains comfortably bigger than that of Indian industrialist Gautam Adani ($125 billion) and Amazon (AMZN) founder Jeff Bezos ($116 billion), who rank third and fourth on Bloomberg’s list.

While Tesla (TSLA)’s share price has plummeted 54% this year, LVMH stock has held steady, supported by robust sales in the United States and Europe. The luxury market has remained relatively steady this year, even as surging inflation has led less-affluent shoppers to change their spending habits. LVMH has a market value of €362.4 billion ($386 billion).

Keeping a low profile

Born in Roubaix in the north of France in 1949, Arnault graduated from the prestigious École Polytechnique, an engineering school in Paris. He began his career in the family-owned construction company, Ferret-Savinel, becoming chairman in 1978 after successive promotions.

Six years later, he got wind that the French government was looking for a new investor to take over Boussac Saint-Freres. The bankrupt textile group owned a key asset: Christian Dior, a celebrated French fashion house.

Arnault bought control of the group, returning it to profitability and embarking on a strategy to develop the world’s leading luxury goods company. “In the process, he reinvigorated Christian Dior as the cornerstone of the new organization,” according to a biography on the LVMH website.

Arnault bought a controlling stake in LVMH in 1989, two years after the group was formed by the merger of Louis Vuitton and Moët Hennessy. He has been chairman and CEO of the company ever since.

Although his own name may not be immediately recognizable to many, the brands that Arnault has been instrumental in growing — from Christian Dior to Dom Pérignon — have become household names.

Over the past three decades, Arnault has turned LVMH into a luxury goods powerhouse with 75 labels selling wine, spirits, fashion, leather goods, perfumes, cosmetics, watches, jewelery, luxury travel and hotel stays. He opened China’s first Louis Vuitton store in Beijing in 1992.

In January 2021, the group completed its $15.8 billion takeover of iconic US jeweler Tiffany & Co, the luxury industry’s biggest ever acquisition.

Arnault’s philanthropic endeavors are pursued mainly through LVMH, which focuses its patronage on arts and culture. In 2019, the group donated €200 million ($212 million) to help rebuild Notre Dame after a massive fire ripped through the Paris cathedral.

Arnault has long held the title of Europe’s richest person, but the 73-year old keeps a much lower profile than Musk and isn’t personally active on any major social media platforms. In October, he told the LVMH-owned Radio Classique that he sold his private jet because he had been Twitter-shamed over his frequent use of the plane.

Arnault is married and has five children, all of whom currently work at LVMH or one of its brands, according to Bloomberg.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999420642852783}",neutral,0.9999420642852783,0
Will 2023 Be Luxury's Year of Succession? | BoF - The Business of Fashion,"Fri, 16 Dec 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzb2ZmYXNoaW9uLmNvbS9icmllZmluZ3MvbHV4dXJ5L3dpbGwtMjAyMy1iZS1sdXh1cnlzLXllYXItb2Ytc3VjY2Vzc2lvbi_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"This week, the luxury sector was abuzz with executive shuffles that appeared to open the way for a changing of the guard at some of the industry’s top companies.

Tuesday, Milan-based Prada Group — which last week announced Andrea Guerra as its first-ever external CEO — confirmed it would also hire a new CEO, Gianfranco D’Attis, to run its flagship Prada brand. The appointments are aimed at “easing the succession” between co-CEOs Miuccia Prada and Patrizio Bertelli and the next generation of their family, the company said. The pair’s eldest son Lorenzo Bertelli, who joined the company in 2017, is being positioned as the group’s future leader.

The matter of succession at LVMH was in the news, too, albeit for a more incremental appointment. Antoine Arnault, chairman Bernard Arnault’s second-oldest child, was named CEO of the holding company Christian Dior SE, replacing longtime executive Sidney Toledano at the helm of the listed entity through which the family patriarch controls his luxury empire.

Dior SE no longer has operations independent of LVMH since merging its namesake brand with the group’s wider portfolio in 2017. That makes Antoine Arnault’s appointment as CEO largely a symbolic step — but symbols have their importance, too.

The move was part of a broader plan to “perpetuate long-term family control” of LVMH, the company said. It also suggested that after years of pushing off questions regarding Bernard Arnault’s succession, taboos surrounding the topic may finally be breaking.

The stakes for fashion couldn’t be higher. Arnault, aged 73, is now the world’s richest man (after surpassing Elon Musk this week), largely as a result of luxury’s comparative resilience in a challenging global economy. Dubbed the “wolf in cashmere” for his soft-spoken but aggressive approach to business, Arnault has long been the ultimate decider for nearly all matters at LVMH, which towers above the rest of the sector with 75 brands, over €64 billion in annual revenue and 175,000 staff.

Of Arnault’s five children from two marriages, aged 24 to 47, all are now employed in various roles across the group: Antoine oversees group image and communications, as well as the Berluti brand, while his sister Delphine is executive vice-president for product at flagship Louis Vuitton. Alexandre Arnault is executive vice-president for product and communication at Tiffany & Co., while Frédéric is CEO of watchmaker Tag Heuer. The youngest, Jean, joined Louis Vuitton’s watchmaking division in 2021.

While the heirs each exhibit varying degrees of ambition, leadership skills, business acumen and creative sensibility, none has emerged as a clear successor to Bernard Arnault as the group’s chief executive.

Earlier this year, Arnault passed a motion to raise LVMH’s CEO age limit from 75 to 80, meaning he could continue to serve as chief executive of the company for another seven years. Still, he has also started to make moves to prepare the company’s transition to shared family control, restructuring his private holding companies that sit atop LVMH so that his controlling stake in the conglomerate would be controlled by a joint-stock partnership called Agache, to be held equally by his five children.

Arnault has also provided opportunities to the next generation of star managers like Dior CEO Pietro Beccari, Tiffany CEO Anthony Ledru and former Sephora CEO Chris de Lapuente, who now oversees retail and beauty at the group level, all of whose support LVMH will need to smooth a transition.

But luxury’s succession challenges go well beyond Prada and LVMH: Richemont’s chairman Johann Rupert is also in his 70s, as are the secretive Wertheimer brothers who control privately-held Chanel. The brothers recently brought in an external CEO, Leena Nair, and consolidated the firm’s governance and accounting in the UK in a bid to bolster oversight.

Plans for 88 year-old designer Giorgio Armani’s succession are similarly clouded: the designer has placed his company in a trust to ensure its perpetual independence, but in 2021 said it was exploring a deal with an Italian partner thought to be Ferrari-owner Exor, though talks have reportedly stalled.

Whether luxury giants will face more pressure to clarify their succession plans next year could depend on their performance: if most investors have stayed silent regarding their concerns for what comes after the generation of billionaire founders who have led the industry since the 1980s, that’s because the sector continues to outperform the market in terms of both growth and profits.

This year, luxury sales rose 22 percent according to Bain. Shares in LVMH are down 6 percent this year, less than a 13 percent drop in the Stoxx 600 index of Europe’s biggest companies.

But luxury growth is forecast to slow to 3 to 8 percent in 2023 due to a sluggish global economy. While LVMH has used its unrivalled marketing heft to shake off previous crises, in a murky present redirecting the narrative to its plans for future success may be smart business.

This week, fashion looked toward the future. On the fashion week calendar, Bode announced that it will show its FW23 collection in Paris this January, and Marni shared that it will take its next collection to Tokyo in February. At LVMH, Antoine Arnault officially became the CEO of Christian Dior SE, the holding company that operates the larger luxury conglomerate. Elsewhere, the industry saw some forceful collaborations — among them, Givenchy teamed up with Disney for a 100th-anniversary capsule, and Telfar and Eastpak reunited for a slew of bright-blue bag offerings.

Below, Hypebeast has rounded up the top fashion stories of the week so you can stay up to date on trends in the industry.

Antoine Arnault, French billionaire Bernard Arnault‘s eldest son, officially became the CEO of Christian Dior SE, the holding company through which the family controls luxury goods conglomerate, LVMH.

Named both CEO and vice-chairman, Antoine replaces the 71-year-old Sidney Toledano, who was the president of LVMH’s Fashion Group and former chief of the Christian Dior Couture brand. Pietro Beccari still holds the title of chairman and CEO of Christian Dior Couture.

Notably, all five of Bernard Arnault’s five children hold senior titles at LVMH. According to Reuters, Antoine’s appointment follows a shift in the legal structure of the family’s investments.

Emily Bode is taking her namesake label back to Paris for a runway show during Men’s Fashion Week in January, according to WWD.

Bode, who will reach seven years at the helm of her antique-laden imprint in 2023, first traveled overseas to Paris in 2019 for her Spring/Summer 2020 runway show and later returned for her Fall 2020 runway. Once the pandemic hit, the designer shifted her focus to growing her business domestically, with the opening of a flagship store in Los Angeles.

Bode’s largest direct-to-consumer market is in North America, but on the wholesale side, the brand performs best in Europe and the U.K. “Everyone frequents Paris for the shows,” she added. “And while we’ve had great success with virtual appointments, we felt it was important to show again.”

Bode confirmed that she might put forth a retail activation in New York during February’s fashion week, though she does not plan to replicate the Paris show elsewhere.

A purveyor of natural beauty, Simon Porte Jacquemus presented Jacquemus’ “LE RAPHIA” Spring/Summer 2023 show.

Staged outside of Paris in the Le Bourget commune, the label’s runway spoke to the brand’s strengths. Look after look, Jacquemus’ penchants for natural-colored pieces, tailoring-centric silhouettes and architectural design codes became clear. This season, the designer looked to Raffia palm, a native fiber to tropical African regions, to craft its earthy iterations. The dried wheat and sand-colored palm weaved itself into fluid tops, suiting and skirts, as well as statement bags and oversized hats.

See the full collection here.

After announcing the closure of his namesake label, Raf Simons dropped off his official Spring/Summer 2023 campaign.

Shot by Willy Vanderperre and styled by Olivier Rizzo (who’s known for collaborating with Miu Miu, Christian Dior, Coach, Raf Simons and Jil Sander), the campaign spotlights the SS23 collection with a fully-rounded vision. Where Simons’ rave runway at London’s Printworks received mixed reviews from the glitterati, the campaign provides a clear image of what’s to come from the designer’s final collection under his eponymous label.

⁠Raf-isms are on full display, with frayed details, distressing and punkish undertones, along with references to kink and workwear. House signatures, including the RS denim, now appear in baby blue, and a black denim shirt tucked into washed-out jeans and paired with a deep brown knit is true Raf.⁠

Marni will stage its Fall 2023 runway show in Tokyo this February, according to creative director Francesco Risso via WWD. The show, which is expected to host approximately 2,500 guests, will take place on February 1 at 8 p.m. local time.

Japan is one of Marni’s largest markets. The brand’s chief executive officer, Barbara Calò, previously stated that the country accounts for 23% of Marni’s total sales. In 2022, Marni was expected to see a 30% increase in sales from Japan when compared to 2021, and according to recent data, the label has surpassed that figure, with a 31% increase.

The Japan show will mark the second leg of Marni’s traveling shows, following the brand’s runway in New York City in September, which was held under the Joralemon Tunnel in Brooklyn. Risso told WWD that he has four traveling shows planned, though he does not know the remaining two locations at this time.

Enter Gucci Après-Ski, the Italian House’s official offering of bundled-up garments and accessories ideal for a gnar-shedding (or relaxing) wintertime getaway.

The collection takes inspiration from skiwear, with coordinated sets ideal for the snow, logo-covered knitwear and shiny puffer jackets. The lineup also hosts a preview of ready-to-wear and accessories from a forthcoming installment of adidas x Gucci, with co-branded emblems decorating staple silhouettes and heritage bags.

In footwear, Gucci drops off an assortment of silhouettes ranging across archetypal hiking and snow boots. Among them, the brand introduces four pairs of new Gucci x adidas lace-up boots, which appear in statement-making colorways with technical canvas, metal eyelets and rope laces.

Gucci Après-Ski will be available in Gucci boutiques, as well as on Gucci’s website, with special pop-ups in Courmayeur, Cortina, Courchevel, Verbier and Kitzbühel.

Following their inaugural collaboration in May, Givenchy and Disney reunited to craft an all-new capsule collection starring Oswald the Lucky Rabbit, in honor of Lunar New Year and The Walt Disney Company’s 100th anniversary.

For the collaboration, Oswald the Lucky Rabbit, a first in the history of character animation, makes a fashionable exit from the Disney vault, ahead of the Year of the Rabbit. Fusing the fun-loving character’s mischievious spirit into the range, Givenchy creative director Matthew M. Williams curated a “one-of-a-kind world tour” collection for the age-old character, sourcing inspiration from New York, Paris, Los Angeles, Shanghai, Tokyo and beyond.

The Disney x Givenchy capsule collection will be available beginning December 16 in China, Singapore and at the Tokyo Ikebukuro pop-up. The collection will launch at the Miami Aventura pop-up on December 19, and it will be available globally beginning December 30 on Givenchy’s website. Prices range from €220 EUR to €3,790 EUR.

After joining forces in April, Telfar and Eastpak reconnected for an all-new bag offering that blends the former label’s popular Shopping Bag designs with the latter Boston-founded brand’s signature tech fabrications.

In the new collaboration, the duo offers a slew of signature Telfar silhouettes, including the Telfar Shopper medium/large, Telfar Shopper small and the Telfar Circle. Finished in bold “Painter’s Tape,” the accessory dons black handles and straps, as well as a co-branded logo.

The Eastpak x Telfar III collaboration released earlier this week on Eastpak’s website.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999154806137085}",neutral,0.9999154806137085,0
Antoine Arnault succeeds Sidney Toledano at Christian Dior SE - Vogue Business,"Fri, 09 Dec 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZvZ3VlYnVzaW5lc3MuY29tL2NvbXBhbmllcy9hbnRvaW5lLWFybmF1bHQtc3VjY2VlZHMtc2lkbmV5LXRvbGVkYW5vLWF0LWNocmlzdGlhbi1kaW9yLXNl0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"To receive the Vogue Business newsletter, sign up here.

Antoine Arnault, the eldest son of LVMH chairman and CEO Bernard Arnault, has been appointed CEO and vice chairman of Christian Dior SE, the holding company that controls 41 per cent of the capital and 56 per cent of the voting rights in the LVMH Group.

He replaces Sidney Toledano, who has decided to leave his executive management position at Christian Dior SE after 20 years, according to a statement from the company. (Christian Dior SE is separate from Christian Dior Couture and Parfums Christian Dior, whose chief executive officers are Pietro Beccari and Laurent Kleitman respectively.)

Toledano remains chairman and CEO of the LVMH Fashion Group, which includes Celine, Givenchy, Loewe, Pucci, Kenzo, Marc Jacobs, Patou and Rossimoda. He is also chairman of French fashion school Institut Français de la Mode and was recently elected as head of the Chambre Syndicale de la Haute Couture. Antoine Arnault will remain CEO of Berluti, chairman of Loro Piana, and continue to supervise all communication, image and environment issues related to the LVMH Group, alongside his new role.

His appointment comes after Bernard Arnault’s main holding company, Agache SE, was converted into a limited joint-stock partnership on 6 December. These moves will ensure the Arnault family’s long-term control over Christian Dior SE and LVMH, according to the statement.

During LVMH’s general meeting in April, shareholders approved a modification of the company’s bylaws to extend the CEO age limit from 75 to 80 years. Bernard Arnault is 73. In July, Agache, controlling shareholder of Christian Dior SE and LVMH SE, said the share capital will be held equally between the five children of Bernard Arnault: Delphine, 47, executive VP of Louis Vuitton, a member of the LVMH board of directors and on the executive committee; Antoine, 45; Alexandre, 30, who heads up product and communications at Tiffany & Co; Frédéric, 27, CEO of Tag Heuer; and Jean, 24, director of marketing and development of Louis Vuitton Watches.

Bernard Arnault acquired Boussac group, the owner of Christian Dior at the time, in 1984 in partnership with a group of investors. In 1988, through one of its subsidiaries, Christian Dior took a 32 per cent stake in LVMH, an ownership interest that was gradually increased over the years.

He has a staggering net worth that stands at USD 172 billion (approximately RM 758 billion), as on 15 December 2022. This makes one wonder how the business magnate spends his wealth and what the most expensive things owned by Bernard Arnault are. We take a look.

The French fashion mogul surpassed Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk to grab the apex position on the billionaires’ index. While Musk’s net worth plummeted by USD 107 billion in 2022 due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the Twitter row, Arnault, too, suffered a dip — but a mild one — of USD 7 billion, CNN reported.

The current richest person on the planet has many luxe assets and a lifestyle that defines grandeur and opulence at every turn.

Here are some of the most expensive things owned by Bernard Arnault

Luxury purchases portfolio

He started his journey to the top in the 1980s when he first ventured into fashion with USD 15 million (RM 64 million) from his father’s construction business. He got the rest of USD 65 million (RM 275 million) financed from Lazard to buy Boussac – the then-parent company of Christian Dior – in 1985. Since then, Arnault has been acquiring luxury brands and earned nicknames like “the wolf in the cashmere coat” in French media.

In 1987, the conglomerate LVMH came into existence with the merger of Moët & Chandon and Hennessy, the world’s largest champagne and cognac producers, respectively. Bernard Arnault then went on to conquer leading European luxury brands, including couture-brand Givenchy (1988), French perfume, makeup and skincare giant Guerlain (1994), French leather luxury goods brand Céline (1996), the Italian jewellery brand Bvlgari (2011), Paris-based couture house Christian Dior (2017), American luxury jewellery and accessory brand Tiffany & Co. (2020) and Italian luxury label Off-White (2021), bringing the total to 75 stellar brands.

Apart from luxury brands, Bernard Arnault has taken the helm of other pursuits such as hotels, artwork, yachts and culture.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.999996542930603}",neutral,0.999996542930603,0

10 Mins Read

Hang Lung Properties’ John Haffner and LVMH’s Nicolas Martin, talk to Green Queen about their new climate and sustainability partnership.

Last month, Chinese real estate leader Hang Lung Properties and French luxury giant LVMH group announced a ground-breaking three-year climate and sustainability partnership. The collaboration, the first of its kind globally, looks to redefine the relationship between landlords and retail tenants, and includes collaboration in five areas: Climate Resilience, Resource Management, Wellbeing, Sustainable Transactions, and Sustainability Communication, Events and Progress Reviews.

Hang Lung Properties’ John Haffner, the company’s General Manager – Sustainability, and Nicolas Martin, LVMH Sustainable Store Planning Manager talk to Green Queen’s Sonalie Figueiras to share thoughts about the partnership, highlights from their recent inaugural Real Estate & Climate Forum, and what’s next.

Green Queen: Can you share more about the Hang Lung x LVMH partnership you just embarked on? What is so unique about it?

John Haffner: Sure. I think the partnership is unique in its scope, scale and depth. First, regarding the scope, we are covering a wide range of topics. We want to improve energy efficiency (as might be expected). But we are also asking, for instance, how we can do learning and development better together? How can we do social impact more effectively together? How can we think about biodiversity differently in the built environment?

Nicolas Martin: We covered 12 topics in our Forum, meaning that we are looking at all aspects of our stores’ operations within Hang Lung buildings.

John Haffner: The second is the scale. We’ve got 26 LVMH brands involved and over 90 retail stores in seven cities in mainland China. We’re talking about a lettable floor area of more than 27,000 square meters.

Nicolas Martin: This is a huge surface of stores, a large proportion of our luxury business.

John Haffner: But I think the most important feature of what makes it unique is the depth of our collaboration. And what I mean by that is we’re really, to use the language of LVMH, we’re co-creating solutions. So it’s not about the landlord saying to the tenant, ‘would you work on ABC’ or vice versa. There are some elements of that. But for the most part, we are sitting together and saying: ‘okay, how can we advance this agenda together’? We’re having the landlord and retail come together in a way that hasn’t been done in the past.

Green Queen: Absolutely, it’s not just between landlords and tenants, it’s at a much higher level than that.

John Haffner: You bring up a fourth aspect to this, which allows for those other three things to be taking place, and that is the level of organizational support. The fact that it’s Group-to-Group collaboration means that it’s not a landlord asking a specific tenant in a specific property to work on something. It’s two Groups coming together at that scale, with support for that scope, with support for that depth of collaboration. We’re not aware of another agreement like this at the group level, and neither is LVMH.

A topic discussion at the inaugural Real Estate and Climate Forum, held on 24 and 25 November 2022.

Green Queen: It is indeed unique. This partnership is really a first globally for real estate and retail. How do you see the possible impacts for both your respective industries? Is the plan to create a standard across the industry, both in real estate and in luxury retail?

John Haffner: One of the things that made this partnership exciting and fun is that we’re learning by doing. So we started with a lot of momentum and energy wanting to get going together first. But always the thought is, we want to expand beyond the two Groups later on. So now we’re thinking, what do we do a year from now?

We want to be able to collaborate with other tenants, other retail brands, other types of tenants, and LVMH wants to collaborate with other landlords. And both of us recognize that the old way of doing things hasn’t been adequate; we need to accelerate progress. Business as usual hasn’t been working. So there’s a sense of wanting to collaborate, and we are both committed to transparency with each other, I think the direction will be over time to share with others what we’ve also learned together, so you’re right, that could lead to ideas around standards, it could lead to ideas around knowledge sharing, and it could lead to ideas around good practices.

Nicolas Martin: With John, we believe that this is the way to do our part to fight against climate change. The issue we are all facing today is a systemic problem. Everything is linked together. So we need a systemic approach to fix the future together. Outside the measurable impacts of our concrete actions, I think that the most important is the design of this interaction. Our “open source” state of mind.

I feel that we are partnering for the good, not only for the business to be profitable.

Green Queen: Forging landlord-tenant relationships can be a challenge because everybody has their own interests, and then if you add shared sustainability values, that can add complexity, especially at this scale. Can you speak more about this?

John Haffner: I think we’re lucky as we have a long-standing relationship with LVMH. So I think there’s long-standing trust, which makes it easier to have an undertaking of this kind. And there’s a lot of transparency and sharing back and forth around what we’re thinking. And so this is relationship-driven, it’s driven by good relationships at the top.

I think the challenge is that we don’t have a template for what we’re doing, so we’re having to figure it out as we go. And I think it takes two organizations that are comfortable with a certain amount of ambiguity, a certain amount of discomfort.

The two Groups wasted no time and completed our Real Estate and Climate Forum just one month after our signing of the sustainability partnership. So I’d say the speed of execution in terms of organizing the Forum has been another challenge. And it’s only been possible, again, because of the trust of the two organizations and the top management support for the mandate. Without those two things, we wouldn’t have been able to do it at this speed for certain.

Green Queen: The Real Estate and Climate Forum was also quite innovative. Can you share some highlights from the event? Any major wins?

John Haffner: The Forum involved about 100 changemakers, 96, to be precise. So we had people in groups of eight engaging in discussions on 12 topics. And for each topic, we had four from each side, in a dedicated room with a facilitator discussing that topic. We nominated people that we thought would be appropriate for each conversation.

We set up a customized website, produced specifically for this Forum, where we asked all the changemakers to read learning content in their dedicated areas such as energy efficiency, water management, biodiversity, etc. prior to joining the Forum. Each of the changemakers also had to do a quiz to confirm that they had read the content.

Everybody had to go through the same process. We had some very senior people joining, such as leaders of various organizations, and they still had to do the reading and the quiz. We said to them: ‘Look, we know that you’re already an expert in this area. But we want to create a common baseline for everyone to have the same conversation, so if you’ll ’indulge us, please do the work as well.’ It was by mixing seniority levels, organizational backgrounds, and areas of expertise that we created this chemistry leading up to the Forum. Through this process, we collected more than 200 ideas. Out of those, we identified 36 for discussion in the Forum, which we further categorized into three areas- ideas for impact, ideas for collaboration, and ideas for innovation.

Nicolas Martin: The other feature of the Forum was that we didn’t focus on ‘the why,’ we focused on ‘the what’ and ‘the how.’ In our view, ‘the why there’s a need for more action around climate sustainability” is already very well established.

Another challenge we have now is managing and making sense of the large number of ideas we generated at the Forum – more than 200 altogether. And we will need to keep the momentum we generated with our beloved changemakers who contributed to the Forum.

John Haffner: It’s really been an amazing process to go into that kind of depth with another organization and to have both sides willing to engage in that kind of problem-solving together.

Green Queen: One of the topics property developers who are working on becoming more sustainable are exploring is this idea of a green lease. Is that part of this collaboration?

Nicolas Martin: Sure. A green lease is a set of obligations on sustainability for both sides, including not only targets, but an obligation of reporting and standardization of data.

The brands within LVMH may experience this as a kind of green lease at their level but the overall agreement is broader than that.

John Haffner: About a year ago, we started thinking in terms of green leases and we reached out to some of our strategic tenants and had exploratory conversations with them. And it just so happened that the counterpart that was most enthusiastic was from LVMH group. And by engaging with them at the Group level, it just went up a level from a specific lease – because they have multiple brands, and they’re trying to ensure common standards across their brands – to a wider scope.

The traditional green lease concept is based on the premise that maybe the landlord needs to motivate the tenant to do something on its side. This is a little bit different in that we’re really trying to shape solutions together. And we’re trying to figure out how to do things faster.

The accountability comes in by the fact that we’re sharing what we’re doing and learning, as in this interview.

So a year from now, we need to be able to show that we’ve made progress, that we’ve implemented certain actions against this effort together. We know that we’re going to need to be able to show data and results from this initiative.

Nicolas Martin: Without data, we cannot make any progress. So I think the green lease of the future sits also in data management.

Green Queen: Looking ahead, what’s next for this partnership? What are the big next steps?

John Haffner: We are going to be announcing the Common Charter in the first quarter of next year, which will be based on the 200 ideas we have received and the 36 ideas that were discussed in greater detail in the Forum.

We’re also going to think a year from now how we can repeat the success of the Forum and think about what worked well, what didn’t and what can we improve upon. The plan is to host the second edition of the Real Estate and Climate Forum in the fourth quarter of next year.

Nicolas Martin: I am looking forward to building our Common Charter with John. As I said this is a huge quantity of actions, and we will continue to refine our methods for managing these.

And we will look for ways through technology and events to maintain contact with our changemakers, our Maisons and suppliers, etc.

This is important to let them continue to feel a sense of ownership. Because they were authentically the authors of the good ideas that came out of our Forum!

Green Queen: Was there anything else that you wanted to add?

Nicolas Martin: Adriel Chan [Hang Lung’s Vice-Chair] spoke about the discomfort experienced by our changemakers as a good thing, and I loved that comment. It was the discomfort of trying a new approach. Because business-as-usual places us in danger, we have to be courageous.

John Haffner: We received a lot of good feedback from the participants as well, who commented on the depth of discussion and the substance, the focus on ideas and action in a way that they haven’t seen. So I think that’s quite exciting. And hopefully, we can model – with that example– a new approach that may help real estate and retail accelerate progress, because I think there’s this sense coming out of COP27 that we need to do things faster, we need to do things differently. So we’re kind of going through a ‘learning by doing’ process of figuring out how we can play our part to support that acceleration.

Nicolas Martin: Creating synergies like this will make truly exponential effects.

Paris Department Store La Samaritaine Closed Due to Protests - WWD,"Thu, 22 Dec 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3dkLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy1uZXdzL3JldGFpbC9sdm1oLXBhcmlzLWRlcGFydG1lbnQtc3RvcmUtbGEtc2FtYXJpdGFpbmUtY2xvc2VkLWR1ZS10by1wcm90ZXN0cy0xMjM1NDU1OTMxL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS – Luxury department store La Samaritaine was shut in the midst of the last-minute Christmas shopping rush as protesters took over the sales floor Thursday.

Protestors affiliated with the General Confederation of Labor, or CGT, entered the premises Thursday morning when the store opened, about 10 a.m. local time, which led to the evacuation of customers “for security reasons.”

A video posted on Twitter shows protesters pushing past the security staff to enter the store, chanting and waving the worker union’s flag.

The store remained closed the remainder of the day. CGT said about 200 protesters, wearing the union’s signature red vests, entered the store to demand wage increases and stood among the displays of luxury goods, according to AFP.

“The symbol of the class clash is immense, a luxury store whose products are inaccessible to the employees who work there,” stated the syndical organization after the protest.

“It is unfortunately the case for the entirety of the employees of the commerce and services sector who came to shout their anger and demand real wage raises,” it continued.

La Samaritaine reopened on Friday morning on its usual business hours.

Confirming the store had been closed on Thursday and that visitors and staff had been evacuated for security reason, the department store confirmed that protesters had “forced [its] entrance.”

It stated that the “near-entirety [of] these protesters were not employees of La Samaritaine” and that “the wage demands put forth were not connected” to the store.

La Samaritaine also indicated that its mandatory annual salary negotiations would begin in early January, as planned in a collective agreement signed with representative worker unions.

The iconic Left Bank department store, managed by luxury giant LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton‘s DFS arm, reopened in June 2021 after a 750 million euro revamp. It houses over 600 brands in two buildings across 215,000 square feet.

About 50 employees went on strike in November to lobby for a wage increase. Representatives for CGT said that many employees are on minimum wage and a commission structure, which remains low. Employees of the store are due to engage in mandatory salary negotiations with management beginning in January.

France’s inflation rate was 6.2 percent in October and November, the highest level since 1985. The annual inflation rate is running around 6 percent for 2022, lower than most other European countries.

The country has been rocked by protests going into the holiday weekend, with national rail carrier SNCF striking for wage increases and resulting in travel chaos.

La Samaritaine put on a massive window display for the holiday season including bringing members of the Opéra National of Paris and Théâtre du Châtelet for dance-themed displays. – with contributions from Lily Templeton.

Bernard Arnault: The new richest man in the world - DW (English),"Tue, 20 Dec 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmR3LmNvbS9lbi9lbG9uLW11c2staXMtbm8tbG9uZ2VyLXRoZS1yaWNoZXN0LW1hbi1pbi10aGUtd29ybGQtYnV0LXdoby1pcy9hLTY0MTYwMzk00gFfaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAuZHcuY29tL2VuL2Vsb24tbXVzay1pcy1uby1sb25nZXItdGhlLXJpY2hlc3QtbWFuLWluLXRoZS13b3JsZC1idXQtd2hvLWlzL2EtNjQxNjAzOTQ?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The French billionaire Bernard Arnault has built a massive and profitable luxury retail empire. Where did he come from and how did he get richer than Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos?

Elon Musk did not last long as the world's richest person. A little more than a year after reaching the top, he has been eclipsed by 73-year-old French billionaire Bernard Arnault, according to analysts at Forbes. On December 20, they estimated Arnault's fortune to be $180.2 billion (€169.8 billion), which is nearly $17 billion more than Musk's.

Arnault is co-founder, chairman and CEO of LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton, commonly called LVMH. His holding company is its largest stockholder and has a majority of voting rights in the publicly traded company.

This is not his first time as the richest person in the world. He briefly attained the position in 2019, 2020, and again in 2021. If Musk can turn around Twitter quickly, Arnault may not have the title for long. Still, the Frenchman's accomplishments are the stuff of legend.

A luxury empire

LVMH is a Paris-based conglomerate made up of 75 separate brands of mostly drinks, high-end fashion and cosmetics. In 2021, it brought in revenues of €64.2 ($68.2 billion) billion, 20% more than in 2019. Fashion and leather goods accounted for 48% of revenue.

The company — the largest luxury firm in the world — has over 175,000 employees and 5,500 stores. In November 2022, its market value was around €371 billion, according to Statista calculations, making it one of the most valuable companies in the world — ahead of Mastercard, Chevron and Nestle.

Compared to others on the world's richest list, Arnault is lowkey and not well-known outside of France. However, the company's subsidiaries are anything but lowkey and include many traditional brands like Bulgari, Dior, Fendi, Givenchy and, of course, Louis Vuitton. They also own retailer Sephora and department stores in Paris. The company's oldest brand is winemaker Chateau d’Yquem, which was founded in the late 16th century.

In America, Arnault gained attention when he bought the famous jeweler Tiffany & Co. in 2019 for nearly $16 billion. In Germany, he made headlines in early 2021 when he bought a controlling interest in Birkenstock, though it is unclear how the sandal maker can be turned into a luxury brand.

Transforming Louis Vuitton bags into billions

Arnault was born in northern France close to the Belgian border. After graduating from engineering school, he joined his father's construction company. There he focused on real estate development and soon became its president.

In 1984, he took over a bankrupt business that included Christian Dior and Le Bon Marche department store. It was his foray into the luxury market. In 1987, LVMH was formed by merging Louis Vuitton and Moet Hennessy. He soon pushed others aside in a hostile takeover and was named chairman of the executive management board in 1989 — a role he has kept ever since.

After becoming the sole boss, he went on a decadeslong, multibillion-euro buying spree vacuuming up one company after another. Many of the brands had been poorly managed and become outdated, so he brought in modern management and hired young designers to shake things up.

Reportedly called ""B.A."" within the company, Arnault was described as the ""Lord of the Logos"" by fashion critic Suzy Menkes in a 1999 International Herald Tribune profile. She also put her finger on the key to his success then and now.

""The aim is to be contemporary, modern, to make the brands speak a universal language,"" she wrote. ""And Arnault insists that keeping the individuality and uniqueness of each brand is the paramount concern, within a streamlined corporate structure."" This strategy has let each brand keep a degree of independence while becoming more professional.

The company has concentrated on expanding, especially through growth in Asia, its biggest market, followed by the United States and Europe. Its glossy advertising is aspirational. They offer less expensive items like belts, hats and anything else with a logo to pull in younger buyers and get them hooked.

Just as important, Arnault believed in the power of the internet. Everything was moving online — and so would LVMH without losing its exclusive aura. Now many of the brands have opulent websites and online shops and are no longer afraid to openly display prices.

Planning for the future

Today, LVMH is a family affair. All of Arnault's five children work with him in different capacities. Always immaculately dressed, Arnault has a full head of gray hair and is very private. Colleagues rarely talk about him. We do know that he is an avid tennis player and enjoys music and collecting art. For a few years, he owned the Phillips de Pury auction house.

In 2014, the Foundation Louis Vuitton opened in Paris. The Frank Gehry-designed contemporary art museum is home to Arnault's collection and is supposed to be turned over to the city one day. He has also donated millions to charities and for the restoration of Notre Dame cathedral.

The big question now is: What's next? Which one of his kids will take over the company? Is any one of them predestined to be his successor, or will it be divided among them? And is the company still on the prowl? Chanel, Armani, Hermes and a number of other brands are still out there. But Arnault is not alone. His tactic of gathering together family-run luxury businesses has inspired others like Richemont and Kering to do the same. They may be competitors, but Arnault created the luxury roadmap.

Jews in Fashion: Louis Vuitton Saga | Arunansh B Goswami | The Blogs - The Times of Israel,"Thu, 15 Dec 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vYmxvZ3MudGltZXNvZmlzcmFlbC5jb20vamV3cy1pbi1mYXNoaW9uLWxvdWlzLXZ1aXR0b24tc2FnYS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"“Antoine Bernheim was a mentor. He was a faithful companion, a sage, a friend,”

– Mr Bernard Arnault.

News has arrived that Elon Musk world’s richest man is not so anymore, he has lost world’s richest title to Bernard Arnault who made his fortune building the world’s largest luxury conglomerate LVMH, which includes brands like Louis Vuitton but also Tiffany, Tag Heuer, and Celine. Bernard Arnault considers a man his mentor who himself was a highly distinguished man in the history of European businesses, Antoine Bernheim, son of a proud Jewish Zionist father and one so himself.

He is known to have been mentor of wealthy industrialists Bernard Arnault and Vincent Bolloré, as well as Nicolas Sarkozy in his early days. He was recruited by André Meyer his mentor and Pierre David-Weill to join the Lazard bank. Carrier of several popular titles given to him by people, titles such as “Dean of French finance”, maker of kings, “Talleyrand of business”, Antoine Bernheim had a tragic childhood, when the Nazis were looking out to wipe out the Jewish race from the face of the earth. But this Jew like countless others struggled and made it big in his life. In this article the readers shall get to know about the life and legacy of Antoine Bernheim and the history of Louis Vuitton.

Nazis and Louis Vuitton

In her book Louis Vuitton, A French Saga, Stephanie Bonvicini details the way members of the Vuitton family made money during dealings with Germans during wartime. It has been mentioned that while researching for the book, Bonvicini was told that company documents from the year 1930-1945 had been destroyed. Leader of the Vichy puppet government controlled by the Nazis in 1940’s occupied France was Marshal Philippe Pétain who was an authoritarian-supporting, German-state-collaborating person. According to Stephanie Bonvicini, Louis Vuitton had a store on the ground floor of the Hotel du Parc in Vichy, near where Petain had established his government. All other shopkeeper’s stores were shut down. The Louis Vuitton shop was permitted to stay. Bonvicini mentions that she discovered that Gaston Vuitton, the grandson of the eponymous creator, had instructed his son to forge links with the Petain government to keep the company in business. During the occupation, Henry Vuitton was awarded La Francisque, a decoration that denoted personal and ideological loyalty to Pétain. Once Henry had sworn that he was not a Jew, he received the award following a recommendation by the Marshal’s closest aide.

Arnault and Louis Vuitton

In 1989, Mr. Arnault became the majority shareholder of LVMH Moët Hennessy – Louis Vuitton, creating the world’s leading luxury products group. Mr. Arnault has been Chairman and CEO of the company since that date. But how did it happen, let us understand, in 1984, with the help of Antoine Bernheim, a senior partner of financier Lazard Frères et Cie, Arnault acquired Financière Agache, becoming chief executive and taking control of Boussac, a beleaguered textile company which owned, among other assets, Christian Dior and the department store Le Bon Marché. Arnault used this foothold in the luxury business to begin building what would become the world’s largest luxury conglomerate. “It was I who made them,” so said Antoine Bernheim about Bernard Arnault and Vincent Bolloré. While he mentored these stalwarts he was mentored by André Meyer as per Pierre de Gasquet.

Bernheim Family

Born on September 4, 1924 in Paris, as per Pierre de Gasquet, Antoine Bernheim was the son of a Jewish Zionist lawyer, Léonce Bernheim, the son of a property dealer from an old Jewish family from Lorraine, with the heiress of textile industrialists from Franche-Comté, the Schwob d’Héricourt. Originally from Toul and Nancy, the Bernheims are an old family of Jews from Alsace-Lorraine in the same way as the Weills, the Schwobs, the Dreyfuss, the Blums or the Mandels, the author of this article was in Alsace in October, and got an opportunity to visit the Alsatian Museum in Strasbourg, which he availed, in the museum he saw the depiction of the history of Alsatian Jews.

Coming back to the Antoine Bernheim’s family, on his father’s side, Léonce descended from a long line of property developers. Antoine’s paternal grandfather, Emile, had created a real estate company, Maison Bernheim, which was one of the largest in France. In 1911, Emile Bernheim and his brother Edmond entrusted the architect Julien Flegenheimer with the construction of one of the most beautiful palaces on the Côte d’Azur: the Beauvallon hotel, on the Gulf of Saint-Tropez, between Port-Grimaud and Sainte-Maxime. A huge ocher building that stands in the middle of a park of mimosas and umbrella pines, the Beauvallon will count among its famous regulars Lady Churchill, Senator Edward Kennedy, Mohammed V and Colette. His mother’s grandfather, the industrialist James Schwob, had added d’Héricourt to his surname, the name of the canton in eastern France where he lived at the end of the 19th century. He was the uncle of Captain Alfred Dreyfus, whose children he took in when they were expelled from the boys’ high school in Belfort. The Schwob d’Héricourts had bought the textile factories of the Dreyfus family. After the Second World War, they sold the textile business to the Boussac group to reinvest part of their fortune in real estate.

Friend of Chaim Weizmann Léonce Bernheim

Antoine Bernheim’s father Léonce Bernheim as per Pierre de Gasquet was Engineer of Arts and Manufactures and lawyer registered with the Paris bar, he was also mayor of Pourcy-sur-Marne and general councilor of Châtillon-sur-Marne. “My father was a central engineer and a lawyer. He was a socialist and a great friend of Léon Blum. He also presided over a number of Jewish resistance organizations,” mentioned Antoine Bernheim effortlessly. To be honest, he doesn’t like to talk about his family. “He was linked to resistance networks, many Jews fled Germany to other European countries, in Poland, there were pogroms, in Russia too. There were persecutions everywhere. We had to find a refuge for the Jews. My father thought it was good that there was land to welcome them mentioned Antoine. He was a Zionist and was a close friends with Chaim Weizmann, the main founder and first president of the State of Israel. Incidentally, there is a street named after him in Dimona, the city in southern Israel where nuclear energy is being developed, in the desert of the Negev.



Léonce Bernheim distinguished himself in the Resistance, engaged as a volunteer in 1914, he finished the war several times decorated. During the interwar period, he played an important role at the head of the Jewish organisation ORT (Organization Reconstruction Travail, society for the development of artisanal, industrial and agricultural work among the Jews). Called up again in 1939, he was assigned to a special factory in Laudun-l’Ardoise, in the Gard. Following the law of October 3, 1940 establishing the first “Vichyst statute of the Jews” and prohibiting them from exercising public functions, he lost his post as mayor, but remained a lawyer at the Paris bar. In August 1941, his art collection was looted by the Nazis, like so many others belonging to major Jewish collectors. In January 1942, he joined his family settled in Grenoble. He then became one of the main leaders of the Zionist resistance in France. In particular, he participated in setting up the steering committee of the Zionist Organization of France, of which he became secretary general.

On May 10, 1942, it was under his patronage and that of Joseph Fischer that the founding meeting of the Zionist Youth Movement was held. In March 1943, his name was suggested for the presidency of the General Union of Israelites of France, but he declined the proposal. The following month, he will be one of the forty members of the Jewish resistance who participate in the creation of the Center for Contemporary Jewish Documentation in Grenoble, rue Bizanet. Alongside his secret resistance activities, he continued to plead in the Grenoble court.

From September 1943, following the German occupation of the department, he entered the clan-destinity. On December 7 of the same year, back in Grenoble after a meeting of the Jewish resistance in Voiron, he went down, under a false identity, to the hotel Switchboard, rue du Docteur-Mazet. This is where, the next day, he will be arrested by German police, most likely on denunciation. The police report states that he was arrested under the assumed name of Leon Bemin. in room no. 6 of the Hotel Standard, in Gre-noble. On the police file, it is indicated that he dealt with “relief for foreign Jews”. A few moments later, his wife, who had come to join him at the hotel, was in turn “picked up” by the Gestapo, along with “a friend or relative who was accompanying him”. In fact, it is his sister who will be released thanks to false papers. “The fundamental error was to return to Grenoble where they were very well known”, considers Antoine’s cousin, Bertrand Zivy, who himself quickly left the city, knowing that he was “condemned to death by the Militia”. As Myrthil Weill, François de Tessan or Léo Glaeser, other active leaders of the ORT, one of the oldest Jewish “economic relief” organizations, Léonce Bernheim fell into the hands of the Gestapo. “This remarkable man, this ardent campaigner for the rebirth of his people, sacrificed his life to the Jewish cause and the liberation of France. He fell at his post during a perilous mission,” reads the report on the role of Jewish organizations under the Occupation published by the Center for Contemporary Jewish Documentation. Transferred to Drancy on December 13, 1943, the Bernheims were both deported to Auschwitz-Birkenau, in Poland, on December 17, 1943, by convoy n° 63. They never returned.

Like Father Like Son

Antoine Bernheim became an orphan because he and his family were Jewish, he lost both his parents to the Nazi’s planned systematic extermination of Jews. Antoine Bernheim’s existence was that of a survivor, much of his disposition was due to the experience of the Occupation. He was resistant there in Grenoble and then in the Southeast and saviour of many co-religionists the Jews persecuted by the Nazis and several Europeans inspired by Nazism. Having rubbed shoulders with Italians who took on them to hide Jews, he kept an instinctive friendship for the Transalpines. So his destiny as the future boss of an insurance giant Generali based in Trieste was not only at random. The Fondation du Judaïsme Français was founded in 1974 by the Unified Jewish Social Fund, the work of social assistance for Jewish children, social action through housing and private and legal persons which included Antoine Bernheim, who lost his parents just because they were Jewish. The Fondation du Judaïsme Français is concerned with the place of Jews in France, recognition of their importance in the history of the country, their future and more globally, with the transmission of cultural / societal / historical values to younger generations. This ambitious aspiration, which is fully consistent with its object and purpose, is intended to be useful to the greatest number of entities, starting with the Jewish institutions themselves. This is the positioning that has led the Foundation to undertake various initiatives.

Marc Jacobs and Lois Vuitton

It is mentioned that it was an American Jew Marc Jacobs, the star designer who turned Louis Vuitton from a staid luggage-maker into a global fashion brand. At the age of 24, Jacobs was the youngest designer to receive the New Fashion Talent award from the Council of Fashion Designers of America. After graduating from the Parsons New School of Design, Jacobs worked for Perry Ellis after the designer passed away and shortly thereafter created his own label in 1984 with partner Robert Duffy. Marc Jacobs was the Creative Director at Louis Vuitton for 16 years, from 1997 to 2014. Jacobs not only expanded the French brand globally but also designed its first ready-to-wear line in 1998. In 2003, Jacobs collaborated with Japanese visual artist Takashi Murakami to produce one of the most beloved LV collections: the Eye Love Monogram Collection. In 2004 he launched the Louis Vuitton’s men’s line. In 2014, Marc Jacobs stepped down as creative director of Louis Vuitton in order to concentrate on his own line.

Jews and Fashion

“Based in urban centers and pushed by history toward entrepreneurship, Jews found fashion one of the fields open to them,” said Valerie Steele, historian at the Fashion Institute of Technology. The 501 blue jean was the first Jewish success story of fashion. The Jewish fashion designers went on to attain great success in the fashion industry, Ralph Lauren to Marc Jacobs.

The problem left the 62-year-old McKinsey alum taken aback. After all, Italy has always been known for its artisans, from the violin-makers, textile designers and painters of the Renaissance to the legends of modern fashion, craftsmanship and Italy go hand-in-hand.

“You have these extraordinary people, incredibly devoted, who are ready to go the extra mile,” Brunschwig says from his office in Fendi’s iconic Roman headquarters. But those traditions are at risk of petering out. “Where is the next generation?” he asks.

Brunschwig’s challenge is one that executives around the world would recognize. Despite the mounting recession risks as 2022 draws to a close, companies are struggling to find talented staff as the aftermath of the pandemic compounds long-term demographic trends shrinking workforces across the developed world.

In Italy, the struggle to recruit younger workers is not just an issue for Fendi, a division of the French luxury powerhouse LVMH. The small family firms that produce many of its supplies are facing the same problem and some are going out of business, raising the prospect that Italy could lose that precious know-how that has helped drive its economy for centuries.

Italian luxury companies are managing to fill only about half of the posts they advertise, according to Stefania Lazzaroni, director general of trade group Altagamma. That means the industry will be missing about 94,000 over the next four years.

Like his boss at LVMH, the billionaire Bernard Arnault, Brunschwig is a graduate of France’s prestigious Ecole Polytechnique, known for its military training and rigorous curriculum in science and engineering. He worked in Paris and Hong Kong during a career of more than 20 years developing LVMH’s top brands — including Dior and Louis Vuitton — before arriving in Rome with a mission to steer the fashion house through the end of Karl Lagerfeld’s 50-year reign as creative director.

His appointment of British designer Kim Jones has pushed up sales with a refreshed product line-up, but he’s worried about the consequences of Italy’s traditional skills fading away.

He considered whether it came down to money. But starting salaries in the industry bear comparison with other professions and can rise quickly. If you can turn a designer’s sketch into a beautiful shoe that fits, that can be produced in sizes and is well-stitched, that has immense value people will pay for, he said.

So Brunschwig decided that Fendi would have to take on a more active role in preserving and cultivating those traditions. He wanted to create an environment that would bring young people together with older craftsmen to learn their skills, so he chose the central region of Marche, where workshops have been producing shoes for over 500 years.

The new Fendi factory opened this year in a designer pavilion near the medieval city of Fermo. With state-of-the-art facilities and a plush canteen, it has more of a tech start up vibe than what you might expect of a shoe factory.

But even in a country with 24 percent youth unemployment, he still wasn’t seeing the sort of interest he’d expected.

The problem, he discovered, was that young Italians don’t associate the luxury industry with the traditions of renaissance craftsmen, they think of hard factory conditions and low pay of more recent history.

“People see shoemaking as a job for losers,” says Beatrice Giommarini, 18, a trainee at the Fendi factory who initially had wanted to go into hairdressing.

She says watching her mother make shoes piecemeal as a child made her frightened of ending up in the same position.

“She used to work at home for many, many hours,” she says. “It was very, very stressful.”

To change those attitudes, Brunschwig reached out to the Italian school system. In his native France, trade schools are common and effective way of preparing your people for skilled jobs, with about 240,000 students across the country. In Italy, the number is around 17,000, according to Altagamma. The problem is that many Italian families see trade schools as a second-rate option for children who struggle academically, rather than a route into a well-paid trade.

Fendi is working with the trade group Altagamma and Italy’s Education Ministry to build better links between schools and the industry providing internships for students, alongside other firms like Bulgari, Salvatore Ferragamo and Gucci.

“The presence of a prestigious brand helps a lot,” says Annamaria Bernardini, principal of a school in Fermo that is participating in the program.

Alessia Balla, an 18-year-old intern, couldn’t believe her eyes when she first visited the factory.

She looks on as an employee puts the finishing touches on a pair of elegant boots whose gravity defying heels are so complex that engineers studied how to distribute the weight effectively before production could start.

“Everything begins on paper from an idea, but then it’s wonderful to see it evolve,” says Balla. “I hope to come here to work one day.”

But Brunschwig isn’t resting on his laurels. He’s already opened a second factory in Tuscany — for handbags — and is mulling ideas for the next stage in his revolution in Italian attitudes. He quips about a TV show, inspired by the cookery programs that have encourages many young people to become chefs.

“To become a cook was no one’s dream when I was young,” he says. “There is something good in communicating the interest of this job, we just have to do the same thing.”

"Mini Succession? Antoine Arnault, Scion of Bernard, Has Been Named CEO of Christian Dior SE - Yahoo Singapore News","Fri, 09 Dec 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vc2cubmV3cy55YWhvby5jb20vcmVhbC1saWZlLXN1Y2Nlc3Npb24tYmVybmFyZC1hcm5hdWx0LTE5MzAwMDQ5MS5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"A billionaire’s heirs rising through the ranks of an omnipotent conglomerate: The Arnault children’s movements within LVMH are certainly similar to that of the Roys in the hit TV show Succession. This time, though, it’s the eldest son of LVMH chairman Bernard Arnault in the spotlight instead of Kendall or Roman.

Antoine Arnault was named CEO of Christian Dior SE and vice chairman of its board of directors at the end of last week. The family holding company owns the majority of the Arnaults’ stake in luxury titan LVMH. Arnault will replace veteran executive Sidney Toledano as outlined in a brief statement shared by the company on Friday, December 9.

More from Robb Report

The appointment comes after Bernard Arnault’s main holding company, Financière Agache, became a joint-stock partnership last Tuesday. The change in the legal structure of the family’s investment was made to ensure its long-term control of LVMH. All five Arnault children now hold senior positions within the French company.

In the case of Antoine, the 45-year-old business school graduate has been an LVMH board member since 2006 and led the group’s communications and environmental initiatives. For the past decade, he has been chief executive of Berluti and chairman of Loro Piana, as reported by Reuters.

As for the rest of the heirs, Delphine Arnault is on LVMH’s board of directors, Alexandre Arnault is an executive at Tiffany & Co., Frederic Arnault is chief executive of TAG Heuer and Jean Arnault takes care of marketing and product development for Louis Vuitton’s watches division.

Although patriarch Bernard has not publicly named his successor, Antoine’s move into Christian Dior could make him a front-runner. The label, which was folded into LVMH in 2017, now holds 41 percent of LVMH and accounts for 56 percent of the voting rights in the group.

Story continues

The children could be in for a bit of a wait, though. Their father, who has an estimated net worth of $186 billion, has shown no signs he’s ready to relinquish the top spot. LVMH also changed the maximum age of its CEO from 75 to 80. That means 73-year-old Bernard has a few years left yet.

LVMH's Bernard Arnault Overthrows Elon Musk As World's Richest Person - Grazia USA,"Fri, 16 Dec 2022 21:36:32 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vZ3JhemlhbWFnYXppbmUuY29tL21lL2FydGljbGVzL2Jlcm5hcmQtYXJuYXVsdC1vdmVydGhyb3dzLWVsb24tbXVzay13b3JsZHMtcmljaGVzdC1wZXJzb24v0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Forbes and Bloomberg have both announced that Bernard Arnault, Chairman of LVMH, has overtaken Elon Musk as the the world’s richest person, according to the Forbes’ Real-Time Billionaires List and the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. With a net worth of roughly $172 billion, Arnault is the only Frenchman on the top 10 list, as well as the only person in the consumer industry.

Whilst Tesla’s share price has witnessed a drastic 54% decline this year, LVMH’s share prices remained steady in comparison, with a market value of $386 billion. Musk’s majority purchase of Twitter also hasn’t seemed to help, as the billionaire had to sell roughly $40 billion worth of Tesla shares to compensate for his hefty $44 billion deal with Twitter. As for Bernard Arnault, luckily for him demand for luxury goods remained steadfast, despite an increase in inflation and a pandemic.

Unlike the second richest man in the world, Bernard Arnault isn’t one for social media or public appearance in general. The luxury magnate is known for being instrumental to the growth of several luxury brands and consumer companies alike, from Christian Dior to Louis Vuitton, Dom Pérignon, Moët & Chandon and several more high-end consumer brand. Bernard Arnault is not the first person in the fashion industry to reach Forbes’ richest list. Amancio Ortega, CEO of fast fashion brand Zara currently holds the title of 16th richest person in the world according to Forbes’ Real-Time Billionaires List, however he had held the number one spot a few times in the past.

Whilst in opposite ends of the fashion spectrum, with one billionaire making his fortune from luxury goods and the other from fast fashion, Arnault and Ortega are two of the very few who have earned their names on the world’s richest lists through the fashion and retail industries.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9994707703590393}",neutral,0.9994707703590393,0
LVMH's Bernard Arnault Is Once Again The World's Richest Man - Boss Hunting,"Thu, 15 Dec 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJvc3NodW50aW5nLmNvbS5hdS9odXN0bGUvbHZtaC1iZXJuYXJkLWFybmF1bHQtd29ybGRzLXJpY2hlc3QtbWFuLW5ldC13b3J0aC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Bernard Arnault – Co-Founder, Chairman, & CEO of LVMH – has dethroned Elon Musk to become the world’s richest man.

According to Forbes, Bernard Arnault’s net worth currently amounts to over US$190 billion, eclipsing the fortune of the C-suite memelord and Twitter owner. Elon Musk’s net worth now sits at just US$174 billion – “just” lol – after the significant hit Tesla’s stock price (NASDAQ: TSLA) has sustained over the past year in addition to the drama-filled US$44 billion acquisition of the aforementioned social media platform.

“Musk’s net worth has tumbled by US$107 billion this year… Arnault’s wealth, which stems from his controlling stake in LVMH, has suffered a more modest US$7 billion decline,” points out Hanna Ziady of CNN.

“While Tesla share price has plummeted 54% this year, LVMH stock has held steady, supported by robust sales in the United States and Europe. The luxury market has remained relatively steady this year, even as surging inflation has led less-affluent shoppers to change their spending habits. LVMH has a market value of €362.4 billion.”

The leading billionaire’s are followed in sequence by India’s prolific industrialist Gautum Adani (US$133.3 billion), Amazon’s Jeff Bezos (US$114.8 billion), followed by legendary investor Warren Buffett (US$107.4 billion), who rounds out the Top 5.

Bloomberg Billionaire Index Forbes Billionaire Rankings #1 – Bernard Arnault: $172 billion #1 – Bernard Arnault: $190.9 billion #2 – Elon Musk: $161 billion #2 – Elon Musk: $174 billion #3 – Gautum Adani: $125 billion #3 – Gautum Adani: $133.3 billion #4 – Bill Gates: $116 billion #4 – Jeff Bezos: $114.8 billion #5 – Jeff Bezos: $115 billion #5 – Warren Buffett: $107.4 billion

**Note: All $$$ = USD

While there’s a slight discrepancy in the numbers, as well as the #4 and #5 rankings, this development has similarly been confirmed by the Bloomberg Billionaires Index (see: above).

Of course, this isn’t the first occasion Bernard Arnault has dethroned an incumbent to become the world’s richest man. Back in August 2021, just when Jeff Bezos was beginning to enjoy his retirement from a career of empire building, LVMH’s stock price (EPA: MC) had reached a point where it allowed Arnault to seize the throne.

At the time, Forbes indicated the 73-year-old power player behind the most prolific luxury conglomerate had a net worth of US$198.9 billion against Jeff Bezos’ recently diminished US$194.9 billion; with Elon Musk sitting in third place with US$185.5 billion, followed not-so-closely Bill Gates at US$132 billion, and Mark Zuckerberg rounding out the Top 5 with US$130.6 billion. Not-so-fun-fact: Zucc’s only sitting on US$42.2 billion right about now.

“Similar to the Omega-wearing space cowboy, a decent portion of Arnault’s wealth is tied to the company market value. Having demonstrated an insatiable appetite for expanding its portfolio of luxury brands across the past 18 month,” we’d previously reported.

“Welcoming the likes of Virgil Abloh’s Off-White, Jay-Z’s Armand de Brignac, and even Birkenstock (sorta); to a family which already included Louis Vuitton, Christian Dior, Givenchy, Bulgari, TAG Heuer, Sephora, Moet & Chandon, Dom Perignon, Hennessy, Tiffany – LVMH’s acquisition run has clearly inspired some healthy optimism amongst the public and industry.”

“In 2021 alone, the LVMH stock has climbed more than 35%, surging by a far more impressive 140% since March of 2020. Amazon’s stock (NASDAQ: AMZN), on the other hand, experienced a post-earnings slump exceeding 7%, last week, which saw Bezos’ net worth slide by approximately US$14 billion in a single day.”

LVMH's online shopping platform boosts its customer experience for the holidays with F&B - Hospitality ON,"Wed, 07 Dec 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vaG9zcGl0YWxpdHktb24uY29tL2VuL2ZiL2x2bWhzLW9ubGluZS1zaG9wcGluZy1wbGF0Zm9ybS1ib29zdHMtaXRzLWN1c3RvbWVyLWV4cGVyaWVuY2UtaG9saWRheXMtZmLSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"An analysis shared by DEPUR Expériences. On the occasion of the end of year celebrations, the e-retail fashion platform 24S is opening the 24S patisserie, the ""first ephemeral fashion patisserie in Paris"". The only international multi-brand luxury player, the group, launched by Éric Goguey in 2017, has always deployed an innovative and service-centric marketing strategy. The brand is, for example, present on TikTok and WeChat and has ambitions to launch in NFT.

This is the first time that 24S has gone beyond fashion and beauty with a food supply. The ephemeral pop-up, open from 7 to 14 December, will offer for sale seven original sweet creations signed by chef and influencer Tal Spiegel and inspired by seven iconic fashion pieces, also available on the e. shopping site.

Fendi's First Bag with pistachio brown mousse and meringue, Courrèges' Réédition vinyl skirt with almond crunch and lemon mousse, Balmain's 6-button jacket with raspberry financier and cheese cake...

""Each dessert represents a flavour and a variety of textures for a true visual and culinary experience. These creations work in their minimalist form as a single piece, and come together in a collection of shapes and colours when placed side by side"" - Tal Spiegel.

The aim of the physical flagship for S24 is to link to the app and the fashion selection offered on 24S. Ipads will be installed in the patisserie, allowing customers to browse the e-commerce site's catalogue directly on site.

What to remember about it:

The restaurant spaces created by luxury houses often have the ""defect"" of wanting to reproduce the codes of luxury identically. Patisserie24 has hijacked iconic pieces and thus offers a more fun and relaxed concept that will attract fashion and pastry enthusiasts as well as the curious.

The seven sweet creations break away from the codes of classic pastry and are unlike anything else currently on the market. They play with sensoriality: each dessert represents a flavour, a texture and a colour.

Their aesthetics and the ephemeral aspect of the pop-up will recreate the same desirability that can exist with certain unique and rare luxury items.

The brand relies on a pastry chef and influencer who has as much a foot in the world of cooking as in the world of fashion. He has been popularised on his Instagram account for pairing his shoes with pastries. He therefore has a certain legitimacy in this project.

Beyond the visibility gain brought by this initiative, the e-commerce site does not forget to use this place to bridge the gap between the physical and the digital and to offer a unique customer experience.
