LVMH's digital transformation is a €40bn success. Meet the former Apple exec in charge - WIRED,"Mon, 12 Nov 2018 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndpcmVkLmNvbS9zdG9yeS9sdm1oLWJyYW5kcy1ncm91cC1kaWdpdGFsLXRlY2hub2xvZ3kv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"In 2015, in what must have been a surprise to the tech company notorious for taking executives from other brands, LVMH poached Apple’s former senior director of iTunes for its newly created position of chief digital officer. The appointment marked digital as a new focus for the world’s largest luxury conglomerate.

Previously, Rogers had an impressive career in the music industry, starting in 1993, when he ran The Beastie Boys' website while still at university in Indiana. Then followed stints running a Yahoo-owned music service and heading Topspin Media — a platform connecting artists directly to fans online.

In 2013, he joined Beats Music as chief executive, joining Apple in 2014 following the company’s $3 billion acquisition of Beats Music and Beats Electronics. As senior director of Apple Music, Rogers was in charge of the company’s music streaming services and online radio station Beats 1. However, Rogers left just two months after the launch of Apple Music to take on a role developing LVMH's online retail presence. The move signals that luxury players - previously reluctant to embrace the digital age - must step up their own e-commerce strategies.

WIRED: Chief digital officer is a relatively new role at LVMH. What does having someone in the high-level position mean for the group?

I think this chief digital officer role is potentially hazardous. What it does is act as a change agent – which also means that its life span is limited. In the music business, I watched them go from 1994, when they had ""new media"", and then in 2003, 2004, they had ""digital marketing"". Today, they just have ""marketing"". They've eradicated these digital positions. Louis Vuitton has as well. They have a digitally capable communications and retail teams, and a technology organisation that reports to the CEO, just like a tech startup would.

The rise of CDOs raises technological innovation to board level. The expectation must be more than just change?

I would agree, except that, long term, I would want to call it a CTO. I think that ""digital"" is a bit of a nonsense word. I haven't met anybody who can explain to me, really, what it means. Scott Galloway at L2 said, ""Having a chief digital officer is like having a chief electricity officer."" I think that that's really accurate. What you're doing is, you're using this somewhat technical term to mask the fact that your customer's behaviours have changed. You need to elevate technology inside of your organisation.

How far along are you with the transformation for LVMH?

We're over €40 billion in revenue and covering multiple industries. You have such a broad spectrum of types of businesses, from Sephora - which is an international e-commerce business - to a small watch company or a small perfume company. They have completely different profiles in terms of what their needs are and what this transition is. On that level, it's difficult to go, ""We're here on the timeline"". At the same time, you can look at successes. You can plot your strategic areas of focus. What are our long-term, our three- to ten-year strategies in each of the maisons?"

When Ian Rogers was appointed the new chief digital officer at LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton in October 2015, it was big news to both the technology world and luxury brands.

This article was originally written by Ruonan Zheng and was published on Jing Daily .

And how could someone with no experience in luxury lead the way?

But Rogers’ appointment has had a major impact on the fashion titan, and in 2017, digital sales accounted for about a third of LVMH’s total revenue across multiple platforms, a big leap from the less than 5 percent in 2016 that analysts estimated.



Rogers was tasked with introducing a new digital thinking into the DNA of LVMH, a group that values craftsmanship, in-person connections, and customer service – all nuances that were believed to be impossible to deliver through a screen.

We ask him about reinventing the biggest luxury group in the world ranked by sales and about the huge role China is playing in the luxury industry… and more.

What has the luxury industry missed about the mobile experience?

LVMH chief digital officer Ian Rogers at the New York Times Luxury Conference in Hong Kong.

“[If you] approach digital as a technology, then you will for sure be doing the wrong thing – the IT guy just putting the thing in the hands of the sales associate with no customer experience-driven [information] behind it,” says Rogers.

“[But] if you have the customer experience down, you are going to end up in the right place. The fact of the matter is there is some great stuff your sales associate can do with [an mobile e-commerce sales] device – but just browsing on Instagram is not one of those things.”

He grants that, in the digital beginning, the “luxury industry was smart to stay away from putting a bunch of couture dresses in a grid, add to cart, check out”.

But he emphasises: “I think they did miss the fact that consumers” do not associate luxury directly with goods any more as much as with an entire customer experience.

Rogers gives a surprising example of Uber’s app as “a pretty luxury experience” in terms of ease and immediacy of use.

How have you tried to make online shopping more luxurious?

Long before Rogers arrived at LVMH, the group had tried to create a luxury e-commerce platform, eluxury.com, but it was closed in 2009.

Six years later, Rogers helped LVMH relaunch with 24 Sèvres, a site that has brought Parisian department store Le Bon Marché online.

A number of factors made this multi-brand e-commerce platform “luxury”, according to Rogers, such as an unbeatable unique and exclusive brand selection including Louis Vuitton, Dior, and Celine, as well as the capability to one-click connect with the stylist in Paris via video call.

Even though the sales data for 24 Sèvres are not disclosed, and it may have fewer visitors than other e-commerce platforms, LVMH have created a product and project to upgrade the luxury experience and to further amass customer data.

In China, why is luxury presented differently online?

What makes online shopping luxurious may mean something entirely different in China.

Rogers gave the example of Alibaba’s Taobao, which is considered the eBay of the East.

“The way it is merchandised and the number of photos it has are incredibly valuable,” he says.

Meanwhile, LVMH is also experimenting in China with JD.com’s TopLife and using its live white-glove delivery service to enhance the sales experience.

What is WeChat’s role in luxury sales?

When Chinese consumers travel between online and offline worlds on a daily basis, digital is not one side of a coin, but rather deeply integrated with offline, such as the store level.

“When it comes to the [LVMH] sales associates, they are the savviest on the China market. Sales associates from all over the world have WeChat,” says Rogers.

“A high percentage of our customers are Chinese, a high percentage of those customers do not buy in China, 100 per cent of them have WeChat, so we see more opportunity in China than challenge.”

AFP Translated by

Nicola Mira Published

Nov 5, 2018

On Sunday, the French President’s office announced the death of Alain Chevalier, 87, one of the two founders of the world’s number one luxury group, . Chevalier was a major industrialist who turned a champagne producer, in association with the group, into a leading international luxury group.







Alain Chevalier and Bernard Arnault - AFP



Alain Chevalier “put his intelligence and talent at the service of politics and industry and, through his vision and determination, he contributed to elevating France at the top of the luxury sector,” said the French President’s office in a press release, saluting Chevalier as “a visionary.”



In a message to the AFP agency, the LVMH group, currently encompassing 70 labels with 150,000 employees worldwide, hailed the “memory” of a “major industrialist.”

On Saturday, French daily paper Le Figaro reported that Chevalier died at his home in Megève, France, on November 1. Chevalier’s family indicated that the funeral service will be celebrated on Wednesday afternoon at the Saint-Clotilde basilica in Paris.



Chevalier was born on August 16 1931 in Algiers, where his family had lived since 1880. As the son of French colonialists in Algeria, “he was loyal to the last to the memory of his native land,” in the words of the President’s office. He studied law and political science before attending the prestigious ENA civil service school (as a member of the Vauban class), where he graduated in 1959.



An auditor at the national Court of Accounts, Chevalier worked in several roles within various ministries (Algerian Affairs, National Education and Industry), before leaving the civil service for private industry.



In 1970, Chevalier became the General Manager of Moët et Chandon, then France’s top champagne producer, with the goal of gradually transforming the long-established, Reims-based maison into a luxury goods group with a global reach. Working together with the company’s President Robert de Voguë, “things went very fast, we had all the luck,” said Chevalier in 1974.



Through a string of mergers and acquisitions (Hennessy cognac, the licence for the Christian perfumes, the Roc cosmetics laboratories) Chevalier made the group a model of well-managed growth.



In 1987, to stave off a take-over threat, he merged the group, then called Moët Hennessy, with another luxury giant, Louis Vuitton, at the time headed by Henry Racamier, who died in 2003.



But this merger marked the end of the line for Chevalier’s managerial career. Indeed, he never held any shares, neither in Moët nor, later, in the LVMH group. Having no stake in LVMH, he was powerless to stop the advance of , who gradually became the group’s majority shareholder.



Management versus shareholders



Chevalier’s skill was management. “I had to stop working for several weeks, so great were the contrasts among shareholders,” he said when he left the group in 1989. “The time of the managers is past. Now, the shareholders are taking back control,” he added.



Moët Hennessy and Louis Vuitton, “which, already under [Chevalier’s] leadership, grouped together some of the most prestigious brands in the wine and spirits, fashion, perfumery and cosmetics industries, are wonderful ambassadors of French elegance and sophistication,” wrote the President’s office, adding that, “he was above all a man who believed in culture and freedom, loyal not simply to a person or party, but to what he believed was right and true.”



From 1979 to 1981, Chevalier was a board member of CNPF (the National Council of French Employers, later replaced by the MEDEF employer federation) but he always refused to head it. In 1986, he also said ‘no’ to President Jacques Chirac, a fellow ENA student, who wanted him as Minister of Industry. Between 1989 and 1991, Chevalier was in charge of the Pierre Balmain fashion label.



Chevalier was fascinated by the history of ancient Rome, and was married and the father of four children."
LVMH's chief digital officer says “digital” is a nonsense word - Quartz,"Tue, 13 Nov 2018 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vcXouY29tL3dvcmsvMTQ2MDM2OC9sdm1ocy1jaGllZi1kaWdpdGFsLW9mZmljZXItc2F5cy1kaWdpdGFsLWlzLWEtbm9uc2Vuc2Utd29yZNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The role of chief digital officer has been swiftly on the rise, in both numbers and prominence. But what if the title is a bit suspect? It’s an interesting assertion, all the more so because it was made by Ian Rogers, the chief digital officer of LVMH, in a new interview with Wired UK.

Rogers, who oversaw Apple’s music streaming service and its Beats1 radio station before LVMH convinced him to jump into luxury in 2015, argues that the trouble begins with the terminology itself. As he told Wired UK:

I think that “digital” is a bit of a nonsense word. I haven’t met anybody who can explain to me, really, what it means. Scott Galloway at L2 said, “Having a chief digital officer is like having a chief electricity officer.” I think that that’s really accurate. What you’re doing is, you’re using this somewhat technical term to mask the fact that your customer’s behaviours have changed. You need to elevate technology inside of your organisation.

His point is that being digitally savvy is no longer a nice bonus in the professional world, but integral to all parts of a modern company. Or at least it should be. “When somebody says, ‘We’re really behind on digital,’ my response is, ‘You’re behind in every aspect of your business?’ he said.

To highlight it in any job title is arguably redundant, and points to an outdated outlook. Rogers notes that many positions with “digital” in their description have been eliminated in the music business, and within LVMH. The more appropriate title in 2018 for someone with his responsibilities, he suggests, would be chief technology officer.

The luxury-goods industry was notoriously slow to go online, being very deliberate, or in some cases reluctant, about translating its exquisitely crafted, extremely expensive 3D products, and the whole branding experience around them, into little 2D images shoppable from a smartphone. But the rush is now on, as it’s become clear that shoppers may still want to buy most of their high-end products in stores, but they’re discovering them, researching them—and yes, in many cases purchasing them—online.

LVMH, the colossal luxury group that owns brands including Louis Vuitton, Tag Heuer, and Hennessy, has been among those working to create an experience for customers that doesn’t leave any boundaries between the online and offline worlds. It aims to allow for the same level of personalized service whether customers are shopping in a store or not, letting customers who want to browse the offerings at the New York boutique for its watch brand Hublot, for instance, use Skype, Facetime, or another video option to shop remotely with a sales associate.

According to Rogers, the company has digitally proficient communications and retail teams, and a technology group that reports to the CEO, ”just like a tech startup would.”

Companies should think in very concrete, practical terms such as these about how technology needs to be woven throughout the business, and forget the big, abstract buzzwords. “Lose these nonsense words like ‘digital’, like ‘data’, like ‘social media,'” said Rogers, who we presume winces every time he hands out a business card. “You have to get rid of this digital umbrella because it’s just too broad.”"

Dubin has a long career in the sector on her back. The executive has worked as senior vice-president in the sales department of Louis Vuitton for America. Previously, she had worked in Japan as executive director of Gilt Groupe Japan. Furthermore, the executive was also part of other companies in the sector such as Coach or Ralph Lauren.

The conglomerate closed the first semester of the fiscal year with a net result valued in 3 billion euros, a 41% above the figure registered during the same period last year. On the other hand, sales in the company’s fashion division stood during the first half of the fiscal year at 8.59 billion euros, a 25% more."
Nike and LVMH Are Sticking Up for China in the Piracy Fight - The Business of Fashion,"Thu, 08 Nov 2018 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzb2ZmYXNoaW9uLmNvbS9uZXdzL2NoaW5hL25pa2UtYW5kLWx2bWgtYXJlLXN0aWNraW5nLXVwLWZvci1jaGluYS1pbi10aGUtcGlyYWN5LWZpZ2h0L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"SHANGHAI, China — Nike Inc. and LVMH, who have struggled against knockoffs of their famous products, are sticking up for China when it comes to fighting piracy.

US President Donald Trump has cited the theft of American intellectual property, including the counterfeiting of major brands, as justification for imposing tariffs on Chinese imports. But executives at two of the biggest victims of such violations praised Beijing’s efforts to crack down on intellectual property abuses at the China International Import Expo in Shanghai on Thursday.

China has helped create a “much improved environment for brands” compared with a decade ago, said Valerie Sonnier, global intellectual property director at Louis Vuitton Malletier. China has done “much more than some other countries,” she said.

Government Crackdowns

Sonnier cited government crackdowns on sophisticated counterfeiting rings in Southern China’s Guangdong province that prevented exports of fake Louis Vuitton bags to Dubai and the US.

Margo Fowler, Nike’s chief intellectual property officer, echoed those sentiments, expressing appreciation for “the growth in China’s IP system in extending trademark status and protection” to Nike, its swish design and “Just Do It” slogan.

Both companies have seen a surge in sales from China as affluent consumers embrace high-end brands. Nike’s annual revenue from China last year was $5.1 billion, more than doubling since 2013.

Of 50 countries in the US Chamber of Commerce’s International IP Index, which measures commitment to protecting innovation through legal rights, China ranks 25th. It earns praise in the survey for its reforms on patents and copyright, but loses marks for the high levels of infringement and insufficient legal safeguards.

At an expo forum, several Chinese officials touted the nation’s progress on cracking down on fakes, while reiterating the country’s determination to go further. Still, some companies at the expo said IP protection remains a concern in China.

“It’s unrealistic to expect any country to root out counterfeiting and IP infringement completely,” said Wang Hejun, chief of the trade remedy and investigation bureau at China’s Ministry of Commerce. “One shouldn’t rashly impose unilateral sanctions and disrupt multilateral rules because of a few problems with IP protection.""

LVMH's IME Strengthens Partnership With Italy - WWD,"Sun, 25 Nov 2018 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3dkLmNvbS9mYXNoaW9uLW5ld3MvZmFzaGlvbi1mZWF0dXJlcy9sdm1oLWltZS1zdHJlbmd0aGVucy1wYXJ0bmVyc2hpcC1pdGFseS0xMjAyOTEyNDQwL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"FLORENCE — LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton is strengthening its vocational training model as its Institut des Métiers d’Excellence has signed three partnerships in Italy.

The announcement was made at Palazzo Pucci, which houses IME’s Italian headquarters, during a ceremony that celebrated last year’s graduates and marked the official beginning of IME’s second academic year in Italy.

The three partnerships will focus on training future talents in artisanal and retail skills. A program teaching technical expertise in assembling women’s footwear has been introduced with the Politecnico Calzaturiero in Capriccio di Vigonza, near Padua. The course includes 500 hours of theoretical and laboratory classes and 400 hours of internship in a LVMH company, including Christian Dior, Louis Vuitton and Rossimoda.

Retail-wise, a “Master in Luxury, Customer Adviser” has been added to the offer, beginning in the 2018-19 academic year. Entirely in English, the 1,500-hour course has been developed by Venice’s Università Ca’ Foscari and its Challenge School division.

Both courses will be funded by Italy’s Veneto region, while the Emilia-Romagna region will fund a third, soon-to-be-launched program training men’s shoe artisans and developed by the Berluti Académie du Savoir-faire in Ferrara.

Each apprenticeship alternates between theoretical education at the schools and practical training at the LVMH companies, including language training and original course content and master classes developed in conjunction with LVMH brands.

The programs add to the two training courses launched last year and created in partnership with Polimoda and For.Al in leather goods craftsmanship and jewelry, respectively, bringing to five the number of IME work/study programs offered in Italy.

“LVMH clearly recognizes the importance and excellence of Italian savoir-faire,” said LVMH executive vice president of human resources and synergies Chantal Gaemperle. “The development of our Institut des Métiers d’Excellence in Italy reflects the group’s commitment to playing an active role in training young people and developing job opportunities available to them.”

The institute’s director Florence Rambaud revealed that IME proved to be successful in its first year in Italy, as 93 percent of the 2017 apprentices received a distinction of excellence, and 88 percent of them found a job, including 63 percent within the LVHM group and its contractors. For the current academic year, 85 students have been enrolled in the five programs, which will count on the support of 12 LVMH brands, including Bulgari, Celine, Christian Dior, Fendi, Loro Piana and Louis Vuitton.

“This is an extraordinary initiative, as training artisans is essential for our industry,” said Fendi’s chief executive office Serge Brunschwig. “It’s important we all realize the many opportunities and potential that lay in Italy for the future generations.…The LVMH Group [contributes] a lot, but can’t do it all: It’s important that Italy, too, guarantees the training of craftsmanship and artisanal métiers.”

Serge Brunschwig Thomas Dell'Agnello

Founded in Paris in 2014, the LVMH Institut des Métiers d’Excellence aims to promote, enhance and ensure the transmission of know-how that involves artisanal craftsmanship, creative and retail skills.

The IME programs operate in a range of areas, such as jewelry, dressmaking, winemaking, leather goods, culinary arts, watches, luxury retail and design. They are supported by partner institutions including the Haute École de Joaillerie in Paris for jewelry, the École de la Chambre Syndicale de la Couture Parisienne for fashion and the Centre Européen des Professions Culinaires for gastronomy, among others.

In 2016, the IME expanded to Switzerland, inaugurating the École d’Horlogerie LVMH, before touching base in Italy last year.

Overall, the LVMH Institut des Métiers d’Excellence has internationally matriculated 500 apprentices since 2014, involved 15 partner schools and 32 labels controlled by LVMH and registered an 80 percent placement rate, including 60 percent of the graduates that have found jobs at LVMH."

The move will enable the global retailer — which owns 70 luxury brands including Christian Dior, Louis Vuitton, Bulgari, Fendi and Givenchy — to enhance the efficiency and traceability of its cross-border payments.

“Corporate treasurers are increasingly seeking to manage their payments functions in real time to enhance control and visibility of their cash flows,” Steve Evans, head of Corporate Liquidity and Bank Treasury, FIS, said in a press release. “LVMH’s volume of cross border payments presented unique challenges for the company, and we are pleased to provide the tools needed to leverage these emerging opportunities.”

FIS leveraged its Trax corporate payments factory, which provides corporate treasury functions a highly secure platform for consolidating and standardizing their accounts payments workflow, to connect LVMH Group’s partner banks to the SWIFT gpi. With more than 280 banks on board, SWIFT allows real-time tracking of payments, facilitating more accurate reconciliation and preventing costly and time-consuming investigations for missing or incorrect payments.

LVMH Group plans to expand its SWIFT gpi implementation across its full cross-border payment network, which processes more than 1.5 million payments annually.

“This has been a great collaborative effort between our banks, SWIFT, and FIS that has already delivered tangible benefits to LVMH Group in our cross-border payments operation,” said Laurent Dall’Aglio, finance project manager, LVMH. “We look forward to continuing this work and realizing the full promise of real-time cross-border payments.”

Based in Paris, about 65 percent of the multinational company’s payments go across borders. Last year, Louis Vuitton launched an eCommerce website in China to tap into the country’s booming online shopping market. And LVMH also created 24 Sèvres, a multibrand luxury eCommerce site that falls under the branding umbrella of Le Bon Marché, the company’s upmarket department store."

Qiu Yafu has been transforming the business of Chinese apparel giant Shandong Ruyi – which has traditionally been known for its textile manufacturing activities, with clients including Hugo Boss and Armani – into a conglomerate in its own right. The Shandong Ruyi chairman and controlling shareholder revealed on Monday that he is aiming to build a “globally renowned fashion powerhouse” to rival LVMH, the world’s largest luxury goods conglomerate.

LVMH – which owns Louis Vuitton, Celine, Givenchy, Dior, and Loewe, among other fashion and non-fashion brands, such as cosmetics retailer Sephora and a whole stable of wine and spirits company – “is a world renowned god-like enterprise. It is our role model,” Qiu told Reuters during an interview in Hong Kong on the sidelines of the New York Times’ luxury industry conference.

Qui says that the Chinese giant is “still a far cry from” truly being able to rival the fashion industry’s foremost powerhouse, but a Bloomberg report from early this year suggests that Shandong Ruyi is not actually too far off.

In January, Bloomberg reported that based on Ruyi’s published cash-flow statements, if the privately-held company were publicly-listed, it would “already be among the top 20 global fashion and luxury groups by revenue,” among the likes of LVMH, rival Kering (which owns Gucci, Saint Laurent, and Balenciaga, among other brands), Cartier and Net-a-Porter’s parent Richemont, eyewear giant Luxxotica, and American holding company PVH, to name a few. That same ranking puts the budding Chinese conglomerate ahead of Michael Kors Inc. (now Capri Holdings), Tapestry, Prada Group, Global Brands, and Burberry in terms of revenues.

Qui’s revelation does not come out of left field. Under his control, Shandong Ruyi has been on a busy acquisition course. Within the past several years, Qui “has built up control of a range of European luxury brands through aggressive acquisitions worth billions of dollars,” according to Reuters, including Japanese brand Renown, in which it acquired a 41 percent stake in 2010; French fashion house SMCP (which owns Sandro, Maje, and Claudie Pierlot); and Britain’s Aquascutum. Beyond those brands, Shandong Ruyi has also brought Bally and Gieves & Hawkes under its umbrella.

And Qui is not done yet. “Ruyi has firm and specific requirements and strategic positioning for fashion brands. We are always studying and watching brands that fit the positioning of high quality, high growth and high pricing,” he said on Monday. This will include “more global deals involving ‘affordable luxury’ brands,” Reuters revealed.

Early this year, Bloomberg’s David Fickling asserted that this should be worrying for fashion’s establishment. “The global luxury industry should take notice. If you’re an under-performing brand with strong recognition in Asia (Prada, say, or Salvatore Ferragamo) it might be time to start primping for a takeover.” More than that, he cautioned “the three groups that dominate the industry – LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE, Cie. Financiere Richemont SA, and Kering,” saying that they “should start worrying. China Inc. is coming for you, and it’s got its checkbook out.”"

Asians catching up on the West’s obsession with health and wellness is a trend that has created attractive investment opportunities, Ravi Thakran, chairman of private equity firm Asia and a regional boss, told a luxury conference on Tuesday.

“Health, wellness, organic to eat or put on your body have become areas of growth for the future,” Thakran, group chairman of LVMH South Asia, South East Asia, Australia and the Middle East said at the New York Times International Luxury Conference in Hong Kong.



Thakran said Asians had adopted many Western healthy habits such as running.

“Before in the 1990s, nobody ran for health, they would run only to catch a bus or run away from something. Now there are hundreds of marathons in China,” Mr Thakran said. “Same for dogs, before you would never see someone walking a dog, the only place you saw a dog was on the menu.”



Thakran said sustainability was another attractive investment area as consumers in big markets such as China increasingly wanted to know “who made that product, with what and where. They will not buy if they do not get answers to these questions,” he added.



Thakran sought to highlight the importance of Asia for the global economy and cited analysts’ estimates that around 65 percent of world economic growth between now and 2030 was expected to come from Asia.



L Catterton Asia is the product of the 2016 merger between Asia, which was set up in 2010 by Thakran with investment from LVMH, and US private equity firm Catterton, known for its focus on consumer goods. L Catterton Asia has invested in 22 companies including up-and-coming South Korean eyewear brand , which opened a shop in in London this summer and has plans to expand its footprint in Paris and the Middle East. The private equity firm also owns stakes in fashion brands , and as well as a wide range of companies including Core Power Yoga that provides yoga classes and the Protein Bar &Kitchen chain that sells protein shakes and salads in the United States.



Thakran said there was a lot of creative talent in Asia in fashion areas such as embroidery and lace to name a few but the best story-telling still came from the West. He said Japanese fashion brands, for example, were very creative but needed to “open up their chest” and tell their story to the world more loudly."
You Will Never Entertain as Well as the French - Robb Report,"Fri, 09 Nov 2018 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vcm9iYnJlcG9ydC5jb20vc2hlbHRlci9ob21lLWRlc2lnbi9sdm1oLWNsb3MxOS10ZWFjaGVzLWFydC1mcmVuY2gtaG9zdGluZy0yODI3NzE5L9IBXmh0dHBzOi8vcm9iYnJlcG9ydC5jb20vc2hlbHRlci9ob21lLWRlc2lnbi9sdm1oLWNsb3MxOS10ZWFjaGVzLWFydC1mcmVuY2gtaG9zdGluZy0yODI3NzE5L2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The Limoges was everywhere. At a private lunch at the Paris studio of the acclaimed porcelain artist Marie Daâge, before accepting a glass of rare Krug Champagne in the great room, I caught a glimpse of where we would be dining. Nothing trendy. At first look, it was a lovely table with rows of crystal and layers of porcelain. The curtains were thrown open, and sunlight poured through tall windows, adding to the ambience.

This Parisian simplicity and elegance was soothing. The visuals were the epitome of classique style. But as I would soon learn, when it comes to French hosting, the diable is in the details.

Just as a stranger can exude an allure that you can’t exactly explain, serious party planners the world over study the subtleties of French entertaining, trying to put their finger on what makes it so special. Global respect for French traditions has even been recognized by UNESCO, which includes the French gastronomic meal in its list of the world’s “intangible cultural heritage.” Intangible yes, but is it teachable?

That question inspired Stéphanie Watine Arnault, niece of the LVMH chairman and CEO, Bernard Arnault, to found Clos19. The company offers exclusive, private, and tailored cultural immersions like the one that has brought me to lunch at Daâge’s studio: L’Art de Vivre, an elaborate five-day experience for the advanced host who wants to do more than wow with interesting side dishes. The Clos19 client is studied, dedicated, and willing to travel to Paris for a deep dive into hosting from a French perspective, she says.

This was more than a few elegant pointers on how to assemble a cheese plate. “From the lesson in traditional table setting and French etiquette to the dinner in the private apartment of a Michelin-starred chef, it aims to inspire, educate, and of course ultimately be thoroughly enjoyable and memorable,” says Watine Arnault.

As we sat down at Daâge’s table, I was attuned to the series of beautiful elements that conspired to make the occasion. The table settings were a good start: Her dinnerware, sourced from a small workshop in Limoges, is entirely bespoke and the only all hand-painted Limoges still being made. Gorgeous plant centerpieces, also in hand-painted Limoges, complemented the small porcelain trays holding our name cards, while stacks of exquisite earth-toned Limoges with accents of gold made up each place setting.

Lunch was served in the classic French manner, with everyone moving into the dining room together after the apéro cocktail hour. On a French table, the heavy flatware is positioned facedown (the opposite of how we do it in the United States), revealing any family crests on the back of forks. And the food was served Franco-family style, with a server walking around the table with a huge tray as each guest took as much (or as little; this is Paris after all) as he or she liked. The celebrated sommelier Dominique Laporte selected the wines, from the 2004 Krug aperitif to a brilliant Château d’Yquem that sealed the dessert course.

From Daâge’s space, we headed to the Parisian hot spot Danico, a bar inside the Italian restaurant Daroco in the former boutique and atelier of designer Jean Paul Gaultier. Our patient mixologist, head bartender Thibault Méquignon, helped us make three holiday-party-worthy drinks that were celebratory conversation starters: the Anthemis Noble, a double-strained Cognac cocktail topped with Champagne; Go Green, a green-tea-infused vodka made with kale juice and quinoa orgeat; and a Red Shadow mocktail—made by swizzling beet and pomegranate juice, balsamic vinegar, and soda water—topped with mint.

That last one made an impression: It’s rare to see a mocktail that’s treated with the same care as an alcoholic beverage on the menu. After time behind the bar, Méquignon joined us and made a strong case for creating homemade syrups to truly embrace the evening and the art of hosting. He also advised having signature cocktails at your party—well-guided inspiration for all of us to push beyond typical, on-the-rocks standbys (but have those on hand, too, for the stalwarts).

French hosts are highly attuned to the guest experience; they think carefully about the ways that aroma, appearance, and even nostalgia build memories around food. The effect is very real. Recalling the private dinner in the home of L’Arôme head chef Thomas Boullault, who at only 28 was awarded a Michelin star, my mouth still waters thinking about his warm and creamy croque-monsieur, delicately cut into bite-sized pieces to be served as hors d’oeuvres. The recipe was his family’s, perfected over many years. He enjoys making French classics as much as he does the haute cuisine at L’Arôme. The Clos19 experts urged us to connect the food we serve with a personal story, rather than sweat over what the “perfect” menu should include.

“The French have an aptitude for bringing people together around food and wine, a skill that has been perfected over many centuries and one that I want to encourage,” says Watine Arnault. “French culture and the appreciation for gastronomy has been inspiring many cultures for years. In France, sharing a meal with friends and family is a ritual that has a precise order—how you dress the table, place the wine and water glasses down, to what order you serve the various courses, it is all part of the fun.” She then reminded us that Julia Child once deemed cooking a national sport of France.

Making macarons and choux à la crème in the storied École Ritz Escoffier at the Place Vendôme’s Ritz Paris hotel was both fascinating and demoralizing. The French take such care in making those light sweets scream of delicate, airy perfection—a skill not easily mastered—that I was surprised to learn that, while all food around the holidays should be made from scratch to add an extra layer of care and meaning, the traditional bûches de Nöel and after-dinner marrons glacées are the one place where you might get a pass for “cheating” and buying what a pastry shop might sell. Another refreshingly grounded bit of intel: This elegant culture has a custom of bringing chocolates, not wine, to a party. It’s not only a huge relief for guests, but it’s practical, since the chocolate can be served with after-dinner coffee, adding that final layer of meaning, generosity, and conviviality that honors both the party’s hosts and its guests."
How Startup Culture Helped Zenith’s CEO Chart a New Path for the Venerable Swiss Watchmaker - Robb Report,"Wed, 21 Nov 2018 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vcm9iYnJlcG9ydC5jb20vc3R5bGUvd2F0Y2gtY29sbGVjdG9yL3plbml0aC1jZW8tanVsaWVuLXRvcm5hcmUtaXMtbGVhZGluZy1hLXR1cm5hcm91bmQtYXQtdGhlLXN3aXNzLXdhdGNobWFrZXItMjgzMDA2Ny_SAYMBaHR0cHM6Ly9yb2JicmVwb3J0LmNvbS9zdHlsZS93YXRjaC1jb2xsZWN0b3IvemVuaXRoLWNlby1qdWxpZW4tdG9ybmFyZS1pcy1sZWFkaW5nLWEtdHVybmFyb3VuZC1hdC10aGUtc3dpc3Mtd2F0Y2htYWtlci0yODMwMDY3L2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Zenith has been undergoing a serious facelift. Aiming to dust itself off and forge ahead into the 21st-century, the historic brand enlisted the maverick direction of new CEO Julien Tornare. Having spent the last 17 years growing Vacheron Constantin’s business, Tornare was tapped by watch industry titan, Jean-Claude Biver—the former president of the LVMH Watch Division—to lead Zenith in a new direction.

The new CEO is tasked with a tough turnaround at the struggling brand, but he is already making big moves—not only with new product and new avenues for sales, but also within the manufacture itself. Tornare is banking on a startup-style approach to management and corporate culture, unusual in the famously traditional and rigid watch industry. He hopes the looser culture will lure in top talent and keep valued employees from jumping ship.

We caught up with Tornare, just ahead of Zenith’s launch of its new biker-inspired Ton-Up Black timepiece, to hear about his grand plans.

You’ve been at Zenith since May 2017. What are you focusing on as you head into 2019?

Zenith has amazing history and brand culture, but it’s always been a little bit hidden because it’s been a quiet brand that’s not been so clear in its direction. Now we are working on innovation, especially with the Defy collection.

In the watch industry today, you have two categories: You have brands that are completely new and they do what they want without having to honor any history, and then you have a lot of brands that have such a long history that they become almost a prisoner of [it]. I want to use our 153-year-long history to build the future. That’s one of the reasons we are developing Defy 100th of a Second, as well as the Defy Lab with the new oscillator. That’s been the new theme.

WATCH

Jean-Claude Biver recently stepped down from his role. What did you learn from him in the time you were able to work under him?

When I joined, people told me that I was the first person they had ever heard of that had been hired that came from outside of his historical team. Many people told me that it wasn’t going to be easy working under him, and I have to say, from the very beginning until today we’ve had a great relationship.

I call him and get his advice, and I try to feed him with a lot of ideas and show the dynamism I’m putting into the brand. We talk more or less every two or three days. Now, of course, there has been a big change, but Mr. Biver is staying on as a chairman. The first thing I said to him was, “Mr. Biver, for me, I need you to come to the markets and meet the clients. They want to see you, so when we do events, I would love for you to still participate.” He immediately gave me a big yes with his famous smile. He really is a legend.

What changes have you made at Zenith’s manufacture?

I had to work a lot on the atmosphere and spirit in the company and try to implement more of a contemporary, startup style of management and way of working. It’s quite unusual in the watch industry, and it’s actually working very well.

First of all, I told everyone that we need to communicate better. The manufacture at Zenith is historic, in that it was one of the first manufacture’s with all of the watchmaking crafts under one roof. The downside is that we have plenty of different buildings—we’re not a huge company, but we have 18 different buildings on the site. That’s quite complicated in terms of communication. We needed everyone to share ideas and communicate, so I began by organizing a breakfast for a group of 30 people, which we would try to do every two weeks, and we sit together and we share ideas. In the Swiss watchmaking industry, people are quite quiet and they don’t always open up that easily. The first two or three times, I was the only one sharing my day-to-day activities. But now, they’ve started to open up and it’s a really fantastic brainstorming session.

I also turned the simple restaurant we had into more of a place where people can meet and play table tennis (ping pong), snooker, and things like this, so people can have a break and socialize with each other.

You’ve made quite a few strides with the pre-owned, e-commerce, and customization. How do you see those markets shaping up in the future?

Second-hand timepieces have always been big in the U.S. market. When I was in the U.S. in 2004 or 2005, we were already talking about this trading business so it made since to move forward with it. We went with external partners, TrueFacet, for the pre-owned market initially, because they have a certain expertise and are doing it very efficiently. That doesn’t mean we won’t do it internally at some point, but you cannot do everything at the same time. I already have so many things to develop for the brand right now.

People were surprised when I signed the contract with Bamford for customization, but this guy has a huge client base and is doing a fantastic job for us. When it comes to e-commerce, we began working with MrPorter.com, JD.com, Hodinkee.com, Farfetch.com, and TMall.com in China. Eventually, we will be involved directly in pre-owned and e-commerce ourselves, but not right now.

The industry is quickly changing how its debuting new product. How do you feel about trade shows going forward?

There have been quite a few announcements recently [about brands leaving the watch trade shows]. I went back to Baselworld this year for the first time in 20 years [Tornare spent the last 17 years at Vacheron Constantin, which shows at Geneva’s SIHH watch trade show]. I think it needs to have some evolution. It needs to become more modern, more linked to this world. It could be a great show and a great platform. As you know, we have confirmed our presence for 2019. In the future, it will depend a lot on what’s going on.

The show needs to evolve and become more cost effective. Brands are not willing to pay crazy prices anymore. Another important point, and I really emphasize this, is that it has to be a B2C event. B2B we can do by simple meetings, via email, etc. But B2C is really important. Today, the show is charging 60 CHF per visitor, but once you get inside there’s not much to see. The booths are only open to press and retailers and some brands don’t even show their new watches on the outside of the booths. So the experience offered to a client is close to zero.

I think they should turn it into a worldwide meeting point for watch aficionados from all over the world with big events, more entertainment, and more things to do and really reveal pieces at the show that people could buy on site. Think about Art Basel—it became, in just a few years, a real brand. With Baselworld, you don’t even have the word “watch” in it. We need to have a new format.

What has it been like coming to a brand like Zenith from Vacheron Constantin?

It’s different and it’s not that different. Vacheron Constantin is more established, but when I started working there in December of 1999, the brand was very small size-wise. It was actually smaller than Zenith today. I think I’m bringing in all these years of experience of working on developing a brand, which are tools that I’m using at Zenith now. They are both very beautiful manufactures. They both manufacture their own movements with a long history and a long knowledge. Vacheron is much more on the classic side and wants to stay that way.

For Zenith, I believe that we need to have our feet on the heritage side, but we need to have our head in the 21st century. I strongly believe that if we want to keep the new generation interested, we need to bring something more. The Swiss watch industry tends to repeat the past and repeat the same watch complication and the same design throughout the years. You don’t want the new generation to prefer having a cell phone on their wrist instead of a watch. We have a great challenge ahead of us, but in the last five months we’ve had results that we haven’t had in eight or nine years.

Learn the Basics to Getting a Job in Europe - The Business of Fashion,"Mon, 05 Nov 2018 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzb2ZmYXNoaW9uLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy93b3JrcGxhY2UtdGFsZW50L2xlYXJuLXRoZS1iYXNpY3MtdG8tZ2V0dGluZy1hLWpvYi1pbi1ldXJvcGUv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LONDON, United Kingdom — From the haute couture maisons in Paris to the artisan workshops in Milan, Europe continues to be an aspirational place to work in the industry — and fashion job opportunities on the continent are growing. The European Commission reports five million people are directly employed in the EU fashion value chain, with the creative industries' growth in employment growing by 14.5 percent. Specifically, employment in designer fashion has increased by 23.4 percent in Europe, according to the UK Government's ""Creative Industries Sector Report"" in 2016.

Despite bleak Brexit headlines and cross-continent debates on immigration policy, Europe's fashion industry is more diverse than many other industries. Europe's dominant fashion companies are leading by example; luxury conglomerates and Parisian rivals LVMH and Kering employ 145,000 and 29,000 worldwide respectively. At LVMH, 80 percent of their workforce comes from outside France, while Kering fosters talent abroad through partnerships with universities like Parsons, Tsinghua and London College of Fashion. Leading European e-commerce companies such as Farfetch in Portugal, Yoox Net-a-Porter Group in Milan and London and Zalando in Berlin also place greater and greater emphasis on attracting international talent to solve global challenges. Farfetch employs individuals from 47 nationalities, YNAP 96 and Zalando over 100.

A number of European chief executives rank highly on the Harvard Business Review's ""100 Best-Performing CEOs in the World,"" typically a strong draw for talent. LVMH's Bernard Arnault and Kering's François-Henri Pinault were in the top 25, with both companies revealing strong financial results at the end of last quarter. First place went to Pablo Isla, chief executive of Inditex, parent company to Massimo Dutti, Zara and Pull&Bear, who has led Inditex to become Spain's most valuable company.

With President Emmanuel Macron's plans to turn France into a ""start-up nation,"" the city of light is also set to expand its endeavours in technological initiatives. However, other European cities are catering for an industry reaching further into technology and sustainability innovation. Berlin is a world-leading tech hub, second only to London in Europe, while Copenhagen gains greater traction with its annual Copenhagen Fashion Summit and Global Fashion Agenda, both championing the sustainability movement. It is a continent that caters for almost all.

So how can you take the first steps to moving to Europe?

Learn About the Industry

From France’s strength in accessories to Italy’s forte in ready-to-wear, each European destination has its own specialities and strengths for varying interests and levels of expertise.

Ensure to do thorough research before settling on your destination of choice, to find where your greatest opportunities lie. Organisations such as La Fédération de la Haute Couture et de la Mode in Paris, The British Fashion Council and Milan's Camera Nazionale della Moda Italiana work to promote and coordinate the fashion industry within their chosen country, providing valuable platforms for those wishing to research the country's experts and expertise.

Attend to the Paperwork

If you are not an EU citizen and wish to move to a country within the EU for work, you will require a work visa. This is different from the Schengen visa, which only lasts three months and is primarily used by those travelling. The process to apply for a work visa slightly differs for Denmark, Ireland and the UK.

Your work visa will also be referred to as an EU Blue Card, which is the combined work and residence permit for non-EU/EEA nationals. The Blue Card ensures the same working and salary conditions and benefits as EU citizens. Applications for visas can take up to three months, which means forward planning is of the essence. In order to apply, you must have valid health insurance.

The conditions to apply for the Blue Card states you must have “higher professional qualifications, such as a university degree, and an employment contract or a binding job offer” for at least one year’s work. The work VISA does not cover those who are or intend to be self-employed. The salary received must also exceed the average salary of your profession in that EU country.

Start Your Career Abroad, From Home

It is highly advised you apply for a job abroad before you make the international move. While you might receive a job offer on a Schengen visa, you cannot remain in the country and work on it, and you cannot ascertain a residency permit without proving work or health insurance first, the process for which might take as long as your travel visa lasts.

However, as an ever-global industry, fashion companies in Europe, whether a Parisian luxury conglomerate or e-commerce giant in Berlin, often have international offices and a multinational workforce, meaning the practice of acquiring work visas is likely more familiar and common to them. Smaller companies might also be able and willing to sponsor your visa, but the cost of it might make your application less attractive.

While you may wish to apply outright for a position abroad, you could also find positions at home in a suitable company that offers the chance to move abroad further along in your career. Multinational businesses can facilitate a transfer overseas into other offices, but register your interest in this when you apply. That way, you can ascertain the likelihood of an overseas transfer.

Hone the Job Application

As with any job application, candidates must prove their worth. However, a requirement of the work visa is that a company must sponsor you, and for that to happen they must prove they are not displacing a worker from their country capable of doing the same job — they must also pay more money to prove it.

Therefore, while your usual interview preparation must go above and beyond, you may require some additional experience or personal qualities to assist your application.

Do Your Cultural Homework

ADVERTISEMENT

Working abroad will require a basic understanding of the country and culture to which you wish to move, and the possibility of a language barrier might hinder your application process. A basic understanding of the language, or the expressed intent to learn and improve your language skills, could strengthen your job application, as well as facilitating a new start in a new country.

Taking advantage of the Schengen VISA could also assist your application, should you have experience abroad already. Demonstrating a former interest and time spent in your chosen destination strengthens your application and seriousness about the move. What’s more, you can also find some organised volunteer opportunities, which do not require a work visa, and further demonstrate your commitment to working abroad.

An Unclear Future for Britain

As the British Government continues its furore around Brexit negotiations, the March 2019 deadline looms ever larger. Politicians contest the consequences of a hard or soft Brexit, and the implications on working in the EU will differ depending on the outcome.

A soft Brexit would keep Britain closely associated with the European Union so as to avoid disrupting trade and business relations too drastically. The United Kingdom would remain within the EU’s single market and customs union, meaning that while the country would not be in the EU or retain its voice in EU affairs, it would still be bound to its rules and tariffs. Consequently, a soft Brexit offers a greater chance for freedom of movement.

Alternatively, a hard Brexit would fully remove the UK from any alignment with the EU, their single market and customs union, ensuring a divorce from the Union’s rules and tariffs. Following a hard Brexit, the right to move to the EU would end and visas would be required for British citizens, including temporary work or travel. During fashion weeks, the likes of the designers, models and buyers wishing to travel to Paris or Milan from the UK would follow a process similar to when they are traveling to New York.

A joint report from negotiators for the EU and UK, published on December 8 2017, assured British citizens who wish to move elsewhere in the EU before Brexit day can do so and retain the right to stay in that European country. However, following March 29 2019, that freedom of movement will change. There will be an Implementation Period, from March 30 2019 until December 31 2020, during which time UK nationals can move to an EU country as they can now. If you are legally a resident in the EU by December 31 2020, you will be covered by the Withdrawal Agreement, and can continue living and working in your country of residence.

The British Government’s website states it will set out “initial proposals for our future immigration arrangements with the EU in due course.”"

By way of a joint venture, the London-based luxury retail platform powered the individual e-commerce platforms for seven of Kering’s fashion brands, including Saint Laurent, Balenciaga, and Bottega Veneta, among others, with the exception being Kering’s marquee brand, Gucci, which remained separate.

According to Vogue, Kering initially enlisted YNAP’s services “to help power the online retail platforms for its labels during a time when it was still carving out a strategy.” With that in mind, the decision to bring its digital operations in-house is the “natural” next step for Kering as the industry’s key players are increasingly building up their own technology teams in an effort to maintain complete control over the branding, marketing, and sale of their products, as well as to enjoy full and unencumbered access to valuable information, such as client data.

The conclusion of the YNAP Kering joint venture – which is expected to formally wind down in the first half of 2020 but will see Kering to continue to stock its brands on Net-a-Porter even after developing its own websites for the individual brands – comes a year after Kering appointed eBay veteran Grégory Boutté as its Chief Client & Digital Officer, a role in which he will “lead the Group’s digital transformation and drive the development of e-commerce, [client relationship management], and data management.”

Meanwhile, Kering’s closest rival, LVMH, which plays parent to Louis Vuitton, Dior, Celine, and Givenchy, among a long list of other brands, has been beefing up its digital presence. The Paris-based conglomerate launched its own multi-brand website, 24 Sevres, last year under the watch of Ian Rogers, the former Apple executive who joined LVMH as its chief digital officer in 2015. Beyond 24 Sevres, LVMH developed – and maintains – websites for its many brands on an internal basis.

The move in-house of digital operations coincides with a larger trend amongst the industry’s biggest names to become as self-reliant as possible. Over the past decade, in particular, fashion’s most esteemed luxury names – such as Chanel and Hermès, as well as Kering and LVMH – have been busy buying up different aspects of their supply chains in part to ensure a sustainable supply of raw materials, whether it be crocodile skins in the case of Hermès or tulle and lace for Chanel.

Moreover, many brands are taking on formerly outsourced manufacturing. Burberry, for instance, announced this spring that it will bring a team of around 100 leather goods specialists in-house as part of the deal agreed with CF&P, one of its longstanding Italian leather suppliers in a move to “boost its handbag business and to take its brand more upmarket” with the help of former Celine CEO Marco Gobbetti and new creative director Riccardo Tisci, who comes by way of Givenchy.

As Reuters aptly noted at the time, “Luxury goods firms tend to make the largest chunk of revenues from high-margin leather accessories [as opposed to garments], and many seek where possible to cut out the middle-man, giving them more control over costs and turnaround times.”

In another attempt to exert control from the raw material to the shop shelf, no shortage of luxury names have looked to licensed goods. Despite the time-tested reliance on licensing by many established brands – LVMH’s Celine and Louis Vuitton eyewear is made by Italian eyewear giant Marcolin, for instance, while eyewear behemoth Luxottica produces LVMH-owned Bulgari’s eyewear, a shift has been underway. Brands are reining in their networks of licensing deals.

This has seen at least a few big-name brands take back control over traditionally licensed categories, such as eyewear and fragrance, which with their more affordable price tags serve to sig boost brands’ revenue figures. For instance, during the 1990’s, Christian Dior worked overtime to get a handle on its extensive web of licensing deals. Under the watch of former CEO Sidney Toledano, Dior reduced its outstanding licenses from 300 to just a few. Kering-owned “Yves Saint Laurent, which used to have more than 160 licenses around the world, spent much of the past decade buying them back,” per Reuters. As of 2012, it had just two: one with Safilo for eyewear, and another with L’Oreal for perfumes and cosmetics.

Gucci followed suit, announcing in 2014 that it would put an end to its license agreement with eyewear maker Safilo and bring its $460 million eyewear business in-house.

These are all examples of brands fashioning ways to better control the images of their brands, one of the foremost – if not exclusively the foremost – concerns in luxury."
