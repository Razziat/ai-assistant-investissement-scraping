What could an LVMH and Tiffany & Co. deal mean for Coty? - Glossy,"Wed, 30 Oct 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmdsb3NzeS5jby9iZWF1dHkvd2hhdC1jb3VsZC1hLWx2bWgtYW5kLXRpZmZhbnktY28tZGVhbC1tZWFuLWZvci1jb3R5L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"When news broke this weekend that LVMH offered to buy Tiffany & Co. for a reported $14.5 billion, analysts agreed that an acquisition would be advantageous for both parties.

LVMH would be able to expand its U.S. presence and use the Tiffany business for continued growth in China; meanwhile, Tiffany & Co. could offset some of the pressure on its diamond business and explore a fashion offering in watches and jewelry. What this means for Coty, which secured a fragrance licensing deal with Tiffany in 2016, is unclear.

LVMH is not buying Tiffany & Co. for its perfume business, of course, but the French conglomerate is hoping to build out its luxury lifestyle proposition. A revamp of the 2016 Tiffany licensing deal could, however, threaten Coty’s luxury business. This was the only Coty segment that saw growth in fiscal 2019, of 3% to approximately $3.3 billion according to the company’s annual results. Coty’s consumer beauty division saw a loss of 17% year-over-year, and its professional beauty segment saw a loss of 5%. Coty was not available for comment for this story, but it is expected to report earnings on Nov. 6.

If the LVMH and Tiffany & Co. deal goes through, LVMH could buy the Tiffany & Co. fragrance license from Coty, just three years after it took ownership. LVMH’s own fragrance and cosmetics business saw organic revenue growth of 8% in the first nine months of 2019, so the fragrance know-how and expertise exists sans Coty. A similar deal was made in 2012, when Burberry bought back its license rights from Inter Parfums for $220 million. (At the time, five years remained under the license.) Burberry reportedly made up 50% of Inter Parfums’ net sales and, subsequently, company sales took a hit the following year. Stephanie Wissink, Jefferies equity analyst, reported that Coty could receive between $90 and $140 million in a breakage payment, with six years left on the Tiffany & Co. license agreement.

Buying back the fragrance license is one clear route for LVMH and Tiffany, and Coty could easily use the cash to invest in its struggling consumer business. Still, there are synergies between LVMH and Coty already in place. Namely, the former operates Marc Jacobs’ fashion and cosmetics business, while the latter owns the fragrance license for Marc Jacobs.

Nik Modi, RBC Capital Markets consumer staples analyst called this out. “Tiffany has definitely been a nice growth driver [for Coty]. It’s done really well, but Coty already works with LVMH on certain fragrances [and cosmetics],” he said.

Which is to say that with or without the Tiffany & Co. license, Coty’s new long-term strategies do not have to be disrupted.

Some industry insiders have been saying that Coty’s business has been beyond a turnaround. This is especially true because of the losses of its consumer brands such as Covergirl; thus, it should consider going private. However, Coty needs to remain a platform for JAB Holding Company (the investment firm that owns a majority of the beauty business), especially for M&A purposes.

“A lot of folks are operating on an anchor theory with Coty, like, ‘The business has been bad, and nothing is going to change,’ but my perspective is this new management team is going to be able to turn the business around,” said Modi. “The beauty of beauty is that it is very fragmented. No woman wants the same brand for all of her needs, so having a portfolio of brands is compelling.”

Deciding on the right portfolio is the question for Coty and one that is coming into focus more clearly: It divested its stake in social selling business Younique in August and is currently trying to offload its professional business.

As Modi commented, “There are no such things as dead markets, only dead marketers.”"

Luxury goods giant LVMH makes $14.5bn Tiffany & Co approach - The Guardian,"Mon, 28 Oct 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy8yMDE5L29jdC8yOC9sdXh1cnktZ29vZHMtZ3JvdXAtbHZtaC1pbi10aWZmYW55LXRha2VvdmVyLXRhbGtz0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Europe’s richest man Bernard Arnault on Monday made a $14.5bn (£11.3bn) bid to buy Tiffany & Co, the jeweller famed for its extravagant engagement rings and white diamond necklaces worn by the likes of Audrey Hepburn for the film Breakfast at Tiffany’s.

Arnault’s €194bn (£167bn) LVMH luxury goods empire, which features brands such as Louis Vuitton, Dior and Moët & Chandon, announced it had made a $120-a-share offer to buy the US jeweller, which was founded by 25-year-old Charles Lewis Tiffany in 1837.

Tiffany said it was carefully reviewing the proposal, but said it was not in discussions with its Paris-based suitor, which it mistakenly referred to as LMVH in its statement. Tiffany employs more than 14,000 people, and operates about 300 stores around the world including its flagship store next to Trump Tower on Fifth Avenue. The shop, where Hepburn’s Holly Golightly character mused “nothing very bad could happen to you”, is undergoing a $250m refit.

News of LVMH’s approach sent Tiffany’s shares soaring by more than 30%, far above the offer price, as analysts predicted the jeweller would hold out for a higher price. Tiffany engagement rings range from £1,425 for a platinum band to £43,400 for a double-halo ring with pink diamonds, while other items include a $135,000 gold and silver chess set and a $1,500 paper clip bookmark. Its most treasured item, the $30m 128-carat yellow Tiffany diamond, was worn by Hepburn for Breakfast at Tiffany’s publicity shots for the film and was worn at the 2019 Oscars by Lady Gaga.

In a two-sentence statement LVMH, which is already the world’s largest luxury goods company, confirmed it “has held preliminary discussions regarding a possible transaction with Tiffany”, but refused to comment further.

If the deal goes ahead it would be LVMH’s biggest takeover under the 32-year reign of its chairman and chief executive, Arnault, a 70-year-old Frenchman who has built up a vast portfolio of luxury names at LVMH including Bulgari, Givenchy and Céline. It also already owns the watch brands Hublot and TAG Heuer.

Arnault has a $97bn fortune – almost twice as much as the second-most wealthy person in France, Françoise Bettencourt Meyers, according to the Bloomberg billionaires index.

Analysts said the proposed deal is part of a wave of consolidation in the industry, as the world’s biggest luxury goods groups compete to buy up brands that they hope will appeal to younger people and increasingly high-spending Chinese consumers.

Rogerio Fujimori, an analyst at The Royal Bank of Canada, said: “Hard luxury [watches and jewellery] is the only subsector where LVMH is not the leader (and we know that Mr Arnault likes to be always No 1).

“Jewellery is the least-crowded category in the sector, with only a handful of truly global players, and Tiffany has a proven brand equity in Asia, where it has consistently ranked among the top three jewellery brands in our Chinese consumer surveys over the years.”

The luxury goods sector is worth about £795bn, according to experts at Boston Consulting Group (BCG), who expect it to grow at up to 5% a year until at least 2025. Wealthy people in China, whose numbers recently eclipsed those in the US for the first time, are described as the “driving force” in the sector, accounting for a third of all spending. By 2025, that figure is expected to rise to 40%.

Tiffany is already exploiting the rise in Chinese spending as its US customers rein theirs in. Tiffany’s chief executive, Alessandro Bogliolo, said earlier this month that the company had moved some of its most expensive pieces, including diamond necklaces valued at more than $1m, from the US to mainland China. “We follow our customers where they shop,” he said.

A lower Chinese domestic sales tax introduced by the government to “repatriate consumption” by its citizens led to a double-digit decrease in sales to Chinese tourists in Tiffany’s US stores.

“LVMH’s attempt to put a $14.5bn ring on Tiffany, having already added Bulgari a couple of years ago is likely to take the fight in this sector to its closest rival Richemont, who owns Cartier, and would help LVMH in gaining better access to US markets,” said Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at spread-betting firm CMC Markets UK.

Rival luxury goods company Kering Group, which is run by the French billionaire François Pinault, owns Gucci and Saint Laurent. While Richemont, which was founded by the South African billionaire Johann Rupert, owns Cartier and Montblanc, and recently bought the Italian jewellery house Buccellati from the Chinese investment group Gangtai.

Analysts at the investment bank Jefferies said: “Tiffany is potentially the biggest prey and the only US global luxury brand … If a bid at this level, or indeed higher, was confirmed, it would be the largest M&A [mergers & acquisition] transaction to date for LVMH but one it could comfortably afford.”

They noted that in 2011, LVMH approached and acquired Bulgari in a similar manner, over the weekend. It went on to pay a 60% premium on Bulgari’s share price before it made its first offer. The offer for LVMH represented a 22% premium on Tiffany’s closing share price on Friday.

Under Bogliolo’s leadership, Tiffany is trying to appeal to younger people with more modern takes on jewellery, and this year launched a men’s collection. It is also increasing its marketing of engagement and wedding rings to same sex couples.

“Nowadays, the road to marriage is no longer linear, and true love can happen more than once with love stories coming in a variety of forms,” the company said when it launched the same-sex couples campaign in 2015. “The Tiffany engagement ring is the first sentence of the story that a couple will write together as they create a life that is deeply intimate and exceptional, which is the message we hope to convey through this campaign.”

LVMH, which made record sales of €46.8bn in 2018, opened a factory this month in Texas which was officially inaugurated by Donald Trump and his daughter Ivanka."

LVMH already owns brands such as Louis Vuitton, Christian Dior and Givenchy. The all-cash offer would value Tiffany at nearly $14.5 billion.

Rumors of the acquisition swirled over the weekend, causing Tiffany shares to soar by more than 30% on Monday. The stock was trading at $98.55 at closing on Friday and $127.65 when trading opened Monday.

Tiffany & Co. was founded in 1837 in New York City and its jewelry blue boxes have become legendary.

It currently has more than 300 international stores and over 14,000 employees. The company, however, reported a 3% decline in worldwide net sales in its second quarter earnings report in August.

LVMH did not immediately respond to ABC News' request for comment Monday but confirmed news of the proposed acquisition to The Associated Press, saying in a statement that ""there can be no assurance that these discussions will result in any agreement.""

French luxury goods giant LVMH (LVMHF) has offered to buy Tiffany & Co., the iconic New York jeweler known for its little blue boxes.

LVMH, which is run by billionaire CEO Bernard Arnault and owns brands such as Louis Vuitton and Christian Dior, confirmed its interest on Monday following media reports of an offer over the weekend.

The French fashion conglomerate said it held “preliminary discussions” regarding a “possible transaction” with Tiffany. “There can be no assurance that these discussions will result in any agreement,” it added.

Tiffany (TIF) confirmed Monday in a statement that it is reviewing an all-cash proposal from LVMH to buy the company for $120 per share. That’s a premium of more than 20% over the stock’s closing price on Friday.

Such a deal would value Tiffany at roughly $14.5 billion, but analysts believe there’s a good chance that Tiffany holds out for a sweeter offer.

Oliver Chen, an analyst at Cowen, predicts that LVMH would need to propose at least $160 per share to secure a deal. Other luxury companies — such as Richemont, which owns Cartier — could make competing bids, he said.

Shares of Tiffany skyrocketed more than 30% in premarket trading Monday to nearly $130 per share, suggesting investors also expect a more lucrative offer. LVMH’s stock barely budged in Paris.

“A takeover of Tiffany could make a lot of sense,” analysts at Bernstein wrote in a research note. While it’s one of the world’s best-known luxury brands, analysts say it still has room to grow, particularly in jewelry and watches.

Cowen’s Chen pointed to the company’s strong brand as a “diamond and bridal authority,” as well as its growth potential in China.

The deal would boost LVMH’s presence in the United States, which accounts for about a quarter of its revenue. And it would bolster the French company’s jewelry and watch lineup, which includes European legacy brands such as Bulgari, Hublot and TAG Heuer. As of January, the jewelry and watch unit only brought in 9% of overall revenue, according to a letter to shareholders.

LVMH is the world’s biggest luxury group. The company is home to 75 different brands, and it has for years been the top seller of high-end goods, according to a Deloitte analysis published this year. Last year, the retail giant took in 46.8 billion euros ($51.9 billion) in revenue.

Tiffany has had a more complicated story. The company has long dealt with slumping sales, and in 2017 it replaced its CEO after disappointing financial results. Since then, it has been working to rebrand its image to attract more millennials — adding more products that are designed to appeal to young shoppers, rolling out more targeted marketing and revamping its historic flagship store in New York City to draw in more customers.

In the company’s most recent earnings report in August, it said that global sales dropped 3% in the first half of this year. But it also said it enjoyed “strong growth” in mainland China, where the slowing economy has put pressure on the broader luxury sector.

An acquisition of Tiffany would be one of LVMH’s splashiest deals to date. In 2017, the company took over Christian Dior for $13 billion, and last year it snapped up the ritzy Belmond hotel chain for $2.6 billion.

The two-year-old label recent drew $1.8 million USD from its March seed round, enjoying funds from the likes of College Fashionista founder Amy Levin Klein and both Sweetgreen founders.

Similar to LVMH’s investment in Stadium Goods — which preempted Farfetch’s $250 million USD acquisition — the Madhappy investment was led by LVMH’s Luxury Ventures imprint. Financial details have not been disclosed, but low-end investments are reported by Reuters to range from $2 million USD to $10 million USD.

Madhappy recently expanded from its West Coast base with a temporary location in New York’s SoHo neighborhood, simultaneously planning pop-ups across America. Interestingly, BoF reports that the brand’s sales in 2018 totaled approximately $1 million USD, slightly below the sales of $2 million USD to $5 million USD that LVMH Luxury Ventures often seeks when making investments, according to Reuters.

Some analysts have noted this contrast, citing LVMH’s rising profits as rationale for the conglomerate’s willingness to experiment with emerging brands."

Tiffany needs to attract millennials. The company that hired Rihanna and A$AP Rocky wants to help - CNN,"Tue, 29 Oct 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vMjAxOS8xMC8yOS9idXNpbmVzcy90aWZmYW55LWx2bWgtbWlsbGVubmlhbHMvaW5kZXguaHRtbNIBRGh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLmNubi5jb20vY25uLzIwMTkvMTAvMjkvYnVzaW5lc3MvdGlmZmFueS1sdm1oLW1pbGxlbm5pYWxz?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"New York CNN Business —

Tiffany & Co. has been working hard to change its stodgy image to court millennials over the past few years. Luxury conglomerate LVMH, a rival that has mastered the art of marketing lavish lifestyles to young people, wants to be Tiffany’s White Knight. But Tiffany may not think it needs saving.

Tiffany on Monday said it’s examining a $14.5 billion acquisition offer from LVMH, whose high-end product lines, including Louis Vuitton, have been a hit with millennial audiences at a time when many brick and mortar retail companies have struggled to establish and maintain their own brand loyalty.

Yet industry analysts are divided on whether the move makes sense for the 182-year-old jewelry retailer, which has made great strides recently in cultivating millennial customers of its own.

Tiffany signaled it will take its time to determine whether the venture is worth accepting.

One way or another, the company said it “remains focused on achieving its goal of becoming The Next Generation Luxury Jeweler.”

“While the parties are not in discussions, Tiffany’s Board of Directors … is carefully reviewing the [LVMH] proposal, with the assistance of independent financial and legal advisors, to determine the course of action it believes is in the best interests of the company and its shareholders,” Tiffany said in a written statement Monday.

The market was intrigued by the offer, with Tiffany shares jumping 31%, closing at $129.72 on Monday. The stock fell a little more than 1% Tuesday.

The Paris-based LVMH — whose brands also include high-end fashion lines Christian Dior and Fendi in addition to spirits makers Dom Perignon, Moet and Hennessy — have set the industry standard for luxury brand notoriety among young consumers.

Lines like Vuitton and Christian Dior have become mainstays in the pop culture lexicon among young consumers, including prominent influencers like Kylie Jenner, Cardi B, and 2017 Dior pitchman A$AP Rocky.

Earlier this year, the conglomerate acquired Rihanna’s Fenty and Fenty Beauty fashion and cosmetics lines, which have enjoyed unique success marketing to young women of all shapes, sizes, hues, and cultural backgrounds globally.

“LVMH has a good track record of diving into the integration of street wear and luxury,” Oliver Chen, managing director and senior equity research analyst for retail and luxury goods at Cowen, told CNN. “They’ve made some really good creative strides which are really embracing the future of luxury. I also think that Tiffany management feels confident in its strategy so it is not going to be lured by the skills that LVMH may be able to bring via an acquisition.”

Tiffany may not have Louis Vuitton’s millennial cachet, but the brand has come a long way in terms of marketing to young people.

The American luxury standout already had long-established cultural caché with older audiences — aided by the timeless 1961 film “Breakfast at Tiffany’s,” starring Audrey Hepburn. But the company had struggled to market its wares to millennials, resulting in stagnant sales and the departure of former CEO Frederic Cumenal in 2017.

Sales have been up since Tiffany unveiled its digital campaign “Believe in Dreams,” aimed at younger audiences last year. The campaign featured a musical ad starring actress Elle Fanning and rapper A$AP Ferg remixing the Oscar-winning song “Moon River” from the movie “Breakfast At Tiffany’s” using hip-hop lyrics and dance moves.

Earlier this year, Tiffany partnered with Lady Gaga once again to promote its “Believe in Love” ad campaign after hiring the pop star for a Super Bowl ad spot in 2017. The promotion featured real-life interracial and same-sex couples telling stories of how they met, fell in love, and decided to buy Tiffany rings. It including endorsements from the likes of Nigerian writer and Beyoncé collaborator Chimamanda Ngozi Adichi as well as author David Sedaris.

Tiffany’s Blue Box Cafe on the fourth floor of its iconic flagship store in New York City has become an Instagram hotspot where influencers snap and share photos of their own “Breakfast At Tiffany’s” experiences.

“Tiffany is successfully executing on its business plan and remains focused on achieving its goal of becoming The Next Generation Luxury Jeweler,” the company noted in its statement on Monday.

Its progress also makes retail industry analyst Neil Saunders of Global Data question LVMH’s $120 per share price bid.

“At the initial price that has been offered, I don’t think this does make much sense for Tiffany,” Saunders told CNN via email. “[Tiffany & Co. is] arguably in the foothills of their reinvention and have a great deal of forward potential, so LVMH is going to have to sweeten the offer for it to be of interest.”

But Chen sees an upside for Tiffany being acquired by LVMH, which has its own, more prominent, contemporary branding profile. He says the two companies have synergies with one another.

“It’s an opportunity for both companies digitally,” Chen said. “LVMH has made some really good creative strides, which are really embracing the future of luxury. Tiffany has a big watch opportunity. Less than 1% of their total revenue is watches. Also the bridal business. Bridal is a big category as other economies use bridal as well. … We’re living in an age of brands. Brands extract buying power.”"

Its organic revenue grew 11%.

The holding maintained the rise in its third trimester despite “the difficult context in Hong Kong”. Specially, its revenue in this period rose 17% and Asia and the United States showed growths due to steady demand.

By categories, fashion and leather goods continue to be the best performing segment with a 22% growth in the first nine months of 2019, up to 15.8 billion euros.

Followed by selective retailing, which includes the cosmetics company Sephora, with a rise of 11%, up to 10.5 billion euros. Perfumes and cosmetics comes after with a revenue of 4.9billion euros, 11% more.

“In a growth environment since the beginning of the year, albeit marked by an uncertain geopolitical context, LVMH will continue to be vigilant; the group will pursue its strategy focused on innovation and targeted geographic expansion in the most promising markets; LVMH will rely on the power of its brands and the talent of its teams to further extend its global leadership in the luxury market in 2019,” concludes."

Shares of Tiffany catapulted $31.17, or 31.6 percent, by Monday’s close to $129.72. Tiffany is expected to push for a higher price, and rivals Kering and Richemont are expected to consider making offers. LVMH’s $14.5 billion offer represented a nearly 22 percent premium to Tiffany’s closing price on Friday.

For LVMH, Tiffany would help diversify its offerings that are dominated by fashion and also help them compete in the jewelry space against Richemont, the owner of Cartier and Van Cleef & Arpels. As of January, LVMH’s jewelry and watch unit — including Bulgari, Chaumet Hublot and Tag Heuer — only brought in nine percent of the company’s revenue. Tiffany is the second largest jeweler after Cartier.

Best known for its engagement rings, Tiffany would also offer a jewelry brand with somewhat more accessible price points compared to Bulgari or Cartier.

LVMH’s jewelry brands could presumably land on Tiffany’s selling floors and the jeweler could collaborate with many of LVMH’s 75 different brands. LVMH’s fashion businesses include Louis Vuitton, Christian Dior, Marc Jacobs, Fendi, Givenchy and Le Bon Marché. Other brands include Dom Pérignon, Moët and Hennessy in the spirits category; Sephora, Fresh and Benefit in beauty; and Rimowa luggage.

The move by LVMH would also boost its presence in the U.S, its second largest market after Asia, representing a quarter of revenues.

Tiffany’s current CEO, Alessandro Bogliolo, has emphasized a strategy of building sales in China and LVMH could guide the expansion.

Any acquirer would assume the challenge of reviving the 182-year-old luxury jeweler’s sales, which have been stagnant to declining in recent years. Tiffany’s U.S sales have been hurt by a slump in U.S. tourism due to the stronger dollar and a slowdown in China’s economy.

Tiffany’s is involved in more complicated revival efforts as well, such as reframing its image to make the brand hipper to Millennials who are looking for more experiences and a less formal version of luxury. The retailer has so far done an extensive revamp of its 57th street flagship, adding an Instagram-friendly cafe, its first men’s collection and an ad campaign featuring Lady Gaga."
Louis Vuitton parent company LVMH reportedly makes takeover bid for Tiffany & Co. - USA TODAY,"Sun, 27 Oct 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihgFodHRwczovL3d3dy51c2F0b2RheS5jb20vc3RvcnkvbW9uZXkvYnVzaW5lc3MvMjAxOS8xMC8yNy9sb3Vpcy12dWl0dG9uLW1ha2VyLWx2bWgtcmVwb3J0ZWRseS1tYWtlcy10aWZmYW55LWNvLXRha2VvdmVyLWJpZC8yNDc5MjcxMDAxL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Louis Vuitton parent company LVMH reportedly makes takeover bid for Tiffany & Co.

Paris-based LVMH ""has held preliminary discussions'' to acquire Tiffany & Co.

The parent company of Louis Vuitton, Moët Hennessy and other luxury brands offered about $14.5 billion for the U.S. jeweler, Bloomberg reported, citing people familiar with the matter.

In a statement, LVMH confirmed that talks had begun but added that ""there can be no assurance that these discussions will result in any agreement.''

If the transaction is completed, it will be LVMH's largest purchase ever, surpassing its $7 billion deal to gain complete control of Christian Dior in 2017, and could be among the biggest deals by a European company in 2019, Bloomberg said.

The all-cash bid values Tiffany at about $120 a share, about 22% more than the company's closing price on Friday, persons told Bloomberg. Tiffany & Co. has a market value of about $11.9 billion.

Retirement dilemma: Can $180,000 really last 65-year-old, soon-to-be retiree until 100? It depends.

LVMH, which has been looking for ways to expand its U.S. presence, made a preliminary, nonbinding offer to Tiffany earlier this month, Reuters reported.

Tiffany & Co. this month launched a new line of men's jewelry – part of its strategy to attract younger shoppers and stoke sales, which have been dampened by a decline in spending by tourists from China and elsewhere.

The jeweler's global sales for the first half of 2019 declined 3% to $2.1 billion, Tiffany & Co. announced in August. Among the factors: increased tariffs on its items shipped and sold in China.

Tiffany & Co. declined comment to USA TODAY on the report.

In a deal that would beef up its smallest business and give it a slice of the lucrative U.S. market, LVMH on Monday said it had approached Tiffany about an unsolicited non-binding offer, but gave no details.

Confirming the move, Tiffany said the offer was worth $120 per share, which would value Tiffany at nearly $14.5 billion and represents a 22% premium over the stock's closing price on Friday.

Investors piled into the New York-listed stock on the news, sending Tiffany shares up as much as 31% to one-year highs around $130 and putting them on track for their best daily performance since the 182-year-old company's market listing in 1987.

Several analysts said Tiffany might reject the offer to seek a higher price, potentially kicking off a battle for control of the company known for its signature robin's egg blue packaging.

LVMH said there was no guarantee that preliminary discussions would result in an agreement.

Analysts at Credit Suisse and Cowen said Tiffany could be worth as much as $140-$160 per share and UBS analysts estimate cash-rich LVMH has an M&A treasure chest of some 40 billion euros ($44.4 billion)."

What LVMH stands to gain with a Tiffany & Co. acquisition - Glossy,"Tue, 29 Oct 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmdsb3NzeS5jby9mYXNoaW9uL3doYXQtbHZtaC1zdGFuZHMtdG8tZ2Fpbi13aXRoLWEtdGlmZmFueS1jby1hY3F1aXNpdGlvbi_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LVMH’s potential acquisition of jeweler Tiffany & Co. could be the shot of adrenaline the group needs to stay competitive against its bolder rivals, Richemont and Kering.

Tiffany & Co., despite being one more than 150 years old, has mostly avoided the trap that many old luxury brands tend to fall into: stagnation. Luxury fashion brands tend to be resistant to change, like Chanel and its utter refusal to sell online. But Tiffany & Co. has made significant advances in technology, both online and in-store. As luxury customers increasingly embrace technology, LVMH, which offered a $14.5 billion takeover of Tiffany on Monday, could benefit from Tiffany’s savvy in the space — not to mention its strong reputation and broad customer base.

Since Tiffany & Co. CEO Allesandro Bogliolo came on in 2017, he’s made it a priority to revamp the brand’s image and target a younger and more hip consumer. Tiffany has employed virtual pop-up stores in China and partnered with Spotify on marketing activations. It’s also outfitted its sales associates with mobile devices to help pinpoint inventory and track customer profiles.

“Empowering store associates with mobile technology is where a lot of interesting things are happening in retail,” said Phil Granof, CMO at omnichannel platform NewStore. “Tiffany has really embraced that. Every associate in their store has an iPad, so every inch of the selling floor can be a mobile point-of-sale station. [To be successful], luxury businesses need to offer a high-touch experience.”

Tiffany has had success tying its online and offline businesses together. LVMH, meanwhile, has been more guarded around e-commerce. As recently as last year, LVMH CEO Bernard Arnault expressed wariness about e-commerce, worrying that it would damage a luxury brand’s reputation.

“For many years, luxury brands have achieved success through carefully crafting their image and cultivating an affluent aura via the physical in-store experience and high-quality advertisements in prestigious publications,” said Melissa Kelly, COO of creative agency Management+Artists. “Creating a luxury online environment that bolsters a brand’s carefully crafted image is a complex process requiring specific expert talent that understands digital consumers as well as genuinely understanding luxury.”

LVMH as a whole is no stranger to innovation and forward-thinking. In the past year alone, it launched a new luxury fashion line with Rihanna targeting Gen Z, bumped up its digital marketing spending by 15%, and even launched a blockchain in June starting with Louis Vuitton and Dior.

Taking a bolder stance on technology will be necessary for LVMH to stay head-to-head with rivals Kering and Richemont, both of which have acquired innovative young brands and retailers in order to diversify and learn from them. Richemont has invested heavily — possibly too heavily — in e-commerce by acquiring Net-a-Porter, while Kering has taken complete control of its e-commerce efforts in-house.

“The hardest thing for big companies to do is change,” Granof said. “Omnichannel success requires internal organization. It’s one thing to have an omnichannel strategy and another to actually get material benefits from it. If LVMH gets a brand like Tiffany into their portfolio, it can affect the rest of the brands under them. Even if they don’t share the specific tools that Tiffany uses, the philosophy there can still be inspirational.”"
Louis Vuitton and Dior drive 16% revenue growth at LVMH - Vogue Business,"Wed, 09 Oct 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZvZ3VlYnVzaW5lc3MuY29tL2NvbXBhbmllcy9sdm1oLXEzLWVhcm5pbmdzLWZpbmFuY2lhbHMtbG91aXMtdnVpdHRvbi1jZWxpbmUtZGlvctIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Key takeaways:

LVMH’s revenue increased 16 per cent to €38.4 billion during the first nine months of 2019.

Sales at Louis Vuitton and Dior buoyed the luxury group, which CFO Jean-Jacques Guiony attributed to a “winning formula”.

Despite global headwinds, LVMH has seen considerable growth so far this year, setting the tone for other luxury groups. Revenue for the world’s largest luxury group, the first of its cohort to report financial results, rose 16 per cent to €38.4 billion during the first nine months of 2019, the company said in its third-quarter financial report. Organic revenue for the group grew 11 per cent compared to the same period in 2018.

Sales in the fashion and leather goods category, the primary engine of growth at LVMH, rose 19 per cent. Analysts were forecasting growth in the mid-teens.

The company noted “remarkable momentum” at Louis Vuitton and Christian Dior as the strength of its flagships continue to buoy the fashion conglomerate. “The recipe works, and we do not change the recipe,” LVMH chief financial officer Jean-Jacques Guiony said during a call with investors. “It’s a combination of… distribution investments and product investments… There is not a particular product responsible for the growth. It’s a winning formula.”

LVMH also highlighted Louis Vuitton’s additional production capacity with a new workshop in France, Dior’s new boutique in Paris, and several new partnerships in art and music for Fendi.

“This is a testament to the strength of the Louis Vuitton and Dior brands, as well as a reality check on the current global luxury demand momentum,” says Luca Solca, a luxury analyst at Bernstein. “It dovetails with our expectations that Hong Kong would not be a material factor in the upcoming reports.”

LVMH will likely continue to outperform peers even amid sluggish growth in US sales and geopolitical tensions worldwide, according to Morgan Stanley.

Beyond Vuitton and Dior, Celine is gaining some momentum. Guiony said the initial client response to the turnaround at Celine is positive, but it’s too early to draw definitive conclusions. In Asia, the company saw a boost in spending in Japan as purchases were drawn forward ahead of a consumption tax. That trend will likely reverse in the fourth quarter, Guiony noted."
Unpacking LVMH's Donald Trump Moment | BoF - The Business of Fashion,"Fri, 18 Oct 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzb2ZmYXNoaW9uLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy9sdXh1cnkvdW5wYWNraW5nLWx2bWhzLWRvbmFsZC10cnVtcC1tb21lbnQv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"JOHNSON COUNTY, United States — LVMH has entered the political war zone that surrounds President Donald Trump, perhaps the most polarising figure in the world's largest consumer market.

On Thursday, LVMH Chairman and Chief Executive Bernard Arnault and Trump marked the opening of a new Louis Vuitton handbag factory about 50 miles southwest of Dallas near the towns of Keene and Alvarado, which comes with a commitment by the French luxury group to create 1,000 jobs over the next five years. (The initial investment is $50 million.)

""We are pleased to be able to contribute to the American economy and bring jobs to the retail manufacturing sector,"" Arnault said in a statement following a lunch and ribbon-cutting ceremony at the 100,000 square-foot ""workshop,"" dubbed Rochambeau Ranch. He was accompanied by his son, Alexandre Arnault, Louis Vuitton Chief Executive Michael Burke, Trump and Ivanka Trump.

“Today we continue the extraordinary revival of American manufacturing,” Trump said at the live-streamed press conference, Lee Greenwood's ""God Bless the USA"" playing in the background as he took to the podium. (While domestic manufacturing was on the uptick during Trump’s first two years in office, it has actually contracted as of late, due to a combination of a slowdown in the global economy, trade tensions and the decrease in automobile manufacturing.)

Louis Vuitton has manufactured products in the US for decades. Its workshop inside a nondescript suburban office park in San Dimas, Calif., about 40 minutes east of Los Angeles, makes handbags and does repairs. These factories don't necessarily produce large volumes of goods compared to some of the brand's manufacturing sites in Europe. (Rochambeau will produce six styles, including the ""Palm Springs"" backpack and ""Iena"" shoulder tote made from leather sourced elsewhere.) But they do carry the ""Made in the USA"" stamp, a designation at the centre of a passionate debate on lost manufacturing jobs in the United States, a central pillar of Trump's ""America First"" movement.

While Louis Vuitton regularly grants journalists and clients tours of its showcase workshops in France, it has remained guarded about its manufacturing operation in the US — until now.

The Texas outfit is the subject of greater fanfare, with US and French media outlets joining Arnault and Trump to document the festivities. Named after Marshal Jean-Baptiste Donatien de Vimeur, Comte de Rochambeau — the French general who supported the 13 colonies in the American Revolutionary War — the kernel for Rochambeau Ranch was planted long before a January 2017 meeting between Trump, Arnault and Arnault’s son, Alexandre. That meeting, however, cemented LVMH’s plans to open more US factories, which it said was needed in order to keep pace with growing demand.

But the decision to open in Keene is more complicated than that. The question is, why would Louis Vuitton, a brand that leans heavily on old-world European craftsmanship to market its goods feel the need to make a big push into the US, potentially in a politically charged way?

For one, additional manufacturing in the US allows LVMH to further protect itself in case Trump places further tariffs on European products. (Handbags, thus far, have not been included.) Last year, Louis Vuitton signed the administration's Pledge to America’s Workers. The initiative, signed by hundreds of companies, including Amazon, Google and Ford, is meant to support training and development for “high-demand occupations and the industries of the future.”

While automation and advanced technologies have transformed manufacturing, the production of luxury goods continues to require handwork and special skills that can take months, if not years to learn. A good percentage of the 1,000 workers that the company says will eventually populate the Rochambeau workshop will need training in leatherworking and other skills. The factory currently employs 150 people, but has the capacity to operate with 500. The plan is to build another factory on the premises that will require 500 more workers.

Finding workers to occupy those positions when the unemployment rate is currently under 4 percent — and in a culture that does not socially reward physical labour — will be challenging.

“There are great, great opportunities in these facilities, but as a concept, [people] don’t want their kids to grow up and sit behind a sewing machine; they want them to be a data engineer or another white collar position,” said Stephen Lamar, executive vice president of the American Apparel & Footwear Association (AAFA), a trade group. “But the bigger problem is attracting workers in a full-employment economy.”

However, the company is taking a risk in using this pledge to engage with Trump, who is facing an impeachment inquiry and whose immigration policies and trade war with China make it more complicated than ever for corporations to appear publicly aligned with his administration.

Since he entered office in January 2017, many major brands, including Gucci — owned by LVMH-rival Kering — and Levi's have done just the opposite, backing movements that directly oppose his rhetoric on gun control and immigration in particular. As early as two weeks into Trump's tenure, senior executives from the likes of Starbucks, Nike and Apple spoke out against his executive order banning all people from seven Muslim-majority countries from entering the US for 90 days.

More recently, companies associated with Trump — inadvertently or not — have experienced a backlash. SoulCycle, for instance, saw a decrease in signups for its indoor cycling classes after it emerged that one of its backers, real estate developer Stephen Ross, held a Trump fundraiser at his home in the Hamptons. In 2018, Ivanka Trump shuttered her fashion label, which was under significant scrutiny from the time her father took office.

The departure from corporate neutrality reflects the changing ways in which consumers interact with the brands behind the products that they buy. In a survey by Boston-based communications agency Cone conducted in 2017, 87 percent of Americans said they will buy something if the brand stood behind an issue they cared about, while 76 percent said they wouldn’t make a purchase if they disagreed with the brand’s stance.

“Companies must now share not only what they stand for, but what they stand up for,” the study underscored.

Meeting with Trump in Texas carries additional political weight. A border state with an estimated 1.6 million undocumented immigrants — second only to California — Texas is at the centre of the immigration fight underway since Trump took office.

LVMH, however, seems to be compartmentalising the work it is doing on the Pledge to American Workers. LVMH’s intention to further localise manufacturing reflects a wider industry shift in the way product is brought to market, with an increased focus on transparency, as well as storytelling. Also on Thursday, the group announced the opening of a new Celine leather goods workshop in Tuscany. In September, it said Louis Vuitton would create 1,500 more manufacturing jobs in France.

“While storytelling is not the real reason why luxury brands are important to consumers, the reputational risk associated with storytelling is increasing,” Bernstein analyst Luca Solca wrote in a recent note. “We see a specific risk in the luxury goods industry sourcing practices.” Being honest about how and where things are made can mitigate this risk.

There are also clear financial benefits to expanding in North America. LVMH has expressed that the main reason for opening another factory in North America is to keep up with demand for Louis Vuitton product in the region, both in stores and online. Arnault has said that the brand, which is estimated to generate around €12 billion in sales a year, could have grown even more in 2018 if manufacturing capacity had been increased.

“It seems to be a reflection of a broader trend of companies wanting to be closer to the consumer,” Lamar said. “Producing in the US allows you to turn quickly.”

The volume of apparel and footwear made in the US, although tiny, has increased steadily over the past few years. In 2017, over 44 million pairs of shoes were made in the country, up from 26 million in 2009, while more than 635 million garments were produced here, up from 381 million, according to the AAFA. (Whether that number continues to rise as tariffs increase remains to be seen. Domestic production shields brands from some, but a good deal of materials and supplies are still imported.)

Regardless, close-to-market manufacturing allows for more reactionary production, protecting against bloated inventory levels.

""We used to forecast — now we react,"" Burke told Bloomberg in September 2019. ""We have the highest sell-through of any brand in the world. We destroy less than anyone.""

In order to convince Louis Vuitton to break ground in Texas, Johnson County approved a 10-year, 75 percent tax abatement — the maximum allowed — mostly likely in the hopes that the brand would bring stable, decent-paying jobs to the area. (The $91,900-per year abatement is based on projected annual revenues of $29 million, according to a 2017 report in the Cleburne Times Review.) In Keene, which has a population of just over 6,500 people, the median household income is $41,869, compared to $61,937 nationwide.

It's also important to remember that Dallas and Houston are epicentres of luxury spending, and that Texas, despite its streaks of blue here and there, is a red state. Trump-voting Rockwell and Collin counties — where the median household income is $92,150 and $86,823 — rank Louis Vuitton as a top-five luxury brand, according to 2017 data from The RealReal.

So off to Texas they went.

Whether the Rochambeau event benefits Louis Vuitton or backfires, especially among young Millennial fans against Trump, may be difficult to determine. LVMH does not break out sales for Louis Vuitton, typically folding the brand’s results into a wider fashion and accessories category. But the bigger challenge for Louis Vuitton may be around training skilled workers, and navigating the increase in tariffs associated with importing certain materials and supplies. “Tariffs make it hard to do business,” Lamar said. “That cost is absorbed into the supply chain.” Of course, Louis Vuitton is not just any business.

In July, Arnault briefly topped Bill Gates as the world’s second wealthiest person (after Jeff Bezos), when LVMH shares reached an all-time high on the Paris stock exchange. As of now, with a net worth standing at $97 billion (per Bloomberg’s real-time Billionaires Index), Arnault is only a few billion dollars away from Bezos and Gates. And he might surpass the two American tech magnets soon, if his luxury empire could add an iconic American brand under its belt: Tiffany & Co.

On Monday, LVMH confirmed that it has offered to buy Tiffany & Co. in an all-cash deal that will value the New York jeweler at $14.5 billion. Tiffany’s confirmed as well that it is reviewing a proposal from LVMH to take over the company for $120 a share, a 20% premium over its closing price last Friday.

If sealed, the deal will be LVMH’s largest acquisition since its $13 billion takeover of the Christian Dior brand in 2017.

LVMH will likely have to raise its offer even higher to convince Tiffany’s to sell. After news of the acquisition talk broke on Sunday, Tiffany & Co. shares soared 30% on Monday morning to $128 (above LVMH’s asking price), a signal that investors were expecting a better offer.

Cowen analyst Oliver Chen predicts that LVMH would need to offer at least $160 per share to secure a deal, according to CNN Business. LVMH’s rival luxury groups, such as Cartier owner Richemont, might also put in competing bids, he added.

Arnault owns about 46% of LVMH, according to Bloomberg. His ownership consists of a 5.9% direct stake in the conglomerate and a 40% stake through Christian dior (CHDRY), which owns 41% of LVMH (Arnault owns 97.4% of Dior).

In addition, Arnault owns 8.6% in French luxury house Hermès and 1.9% in French supermarket chain Carrefour Market."

LVMH makes takeover bid for Tiffany & Co. - Chain Store Age,"Mon, 28 Oct 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiPGh0dHBzOi8vY2hhaW5zdG9yZWFnZS5jb20vbHZtaC1tYWtlcy10YWtlb3Zlci1iaWQtdGlmZmFueS1jb9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"A French luxury goods conglomerate is looking to add a U.S. crown jewel to its portfolio.

LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vitton has made a bid for Tiffany & Co. The U.S. high-end jeweler confirmed Monday that it received an unsolicited, non-binding proposal from LMVH for $120 per share in cash. The offer would value Tiffany at nearly $14.5 billion and represents a 22% premium over the stock’s closing price on Friday.

Tiffany issued a statement in which in noted that while the parties “are not in discussions,” it is reviewing the proposal as is “consistent with its fiduciary responsibilities.” Tiffany also said its shareholders need not take any action at this time. LVMH also issued a statement and said there was no guarantee that preliminary discussions would result in an agreement.

Several analysts said that Tiffany might reject the offer in hopes of a higher price tag. Credit Suisse analysts believe that Tiffany deserves “an exceptional premium” of $160 per share, reported CNBC. Forrester VP and analyst Suchaita Kodali noted ongoing retail consolidation and that Tiffany has had a number of ups and down in recent years.

“It comforts me if LVMH could be the buyer,” Kodali said. “That would be the scenario that preserves the brand equity most and would be a better outcome for the long term equity of the brand than a private equity buyer.”

The bid comes as the 182-year-old Tiffany, which has more than 300 stores around the world, is challenged with lackluster sales amid a slowdown in tourism and a dip in purchases by Chinese customers.

Alessandro Bogliolo, who took the reins as CEO in 2017, has worked to update the brand’s image and make it more appearling to younger shoppers. Bogliolo has also focused on building sales in China.

LVMH is the world's biggest luxury group, and home to 75 different brands. Its portfolio includes fashion brands such as Louis Vuitton, Christian Dior, Givenchy, Fendi and Marc Jacob and more. Its jewelry brands include Bulgari, Fred Hublot and Tag Heuer. In 2018, it acquired the luxury Belmond hotel chain for $2.6 billion. LVMH’s market capitalization was nearly $214 billion as of Friday, according to the New York Times."
LVMH Says Business in Hong Kong Fell 25% in Q3 - WWD,"Thu, 10 Oct 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3dkLmNvbS9mZWF0dXJlL2x2bWgtc2F5cy1idXNpbmVzcy1pbi1ob25nLWtvbmctZmVsbC0yNS1wZXJjZW50LWluLXRoaXJkLXF1YXJ0ZXItMTIwMzM0MTUyNi_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS — LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton saw a 25 percent drop in business in Hong Kong in the third quarter as tourism plummeted in response to nearly four months of violent antigovernment protests — and it expects no improvement soon.

But shares in the world’s biggest luxury group closed up 5.5 percent on the Paris Stock Exchange on Thursday, bringing their rise so far this year to almost 49 percent, as markets expressed relief that the impact was not more pronounced.

Jean-Jacques Guiony, chief financial officer of Louis Vuitton, said the loss in business would hit the group’s profits, and its brands were in conversation with landlords to renegotiate their rent contracts in a bid to cut fixed costs in the blighted region. Nonetheless, he expressed confidence Hong Kong would eventually rebound.

“The 25 percent drop in Hong Kong in Q3 was a combination of a flattish month in July and around 40 percent drops in August and September, so definitely the trend has been worsening throughout the quarter,” Guiony told a conference call the day after LVMH reported a 17 percent jump in third-quarter revenues.

As the first luxury firm to publish quarterly results, LVMH is viewed as a bellwether for the rest of the industry. The unrest in Hong Kong could have a negative impact of between 0.6 and 1.2 percent on global luxury growth this year if the fourth quarter is as badly hit as August and September, Bernstein said in a recent research report.

It estimated Hong Kong accounts for 5 to 10 percent of global luxury sales — in the higher end of the range for hard luxury, and in the lower end for soft luxury. Bernstein said it assumed the sales decline in the third quarter was 50 percent in Hong Kong, and that there would be no change in the fourth quarter.

Analysts estimate that Hong Kong accounts for around 6 percent of LVMH’s overall revenues. Guiony said the group had no hard evidence that the lost business was being redirected to other parts of Asia. “We haven’t seen many countries booming as a consequence of this situation. It’s very difficult to draw any correlation between the various geographies, particularly in Asia,” he said.

While sales in Japan were up 20 percent in the third quarter, versus 10 percent in the first half, some of that acceleration was due to shoppers rushing to beat a hike in the country’s consumption tax on Oct. 1, he said. Revenues rose 12 percent in the rest of Asia, 11 percent in Europe and 8 percent in the U.S.

In Hong Kong, the wholesale business fared better than retail operations, namely fashion, leather, jewelry and duty-free operator DFS, which makes an estimated 45 percent of its sales in Hong Kong and Macao, according to analysts. Revenues at DFS were “slightly negative” in the third quarter, Guiony said.

“This is a profitable area and we will suffer badly due to the fact that most of the businesses have fixed costs there and will experience much lower revenues,” he predicted. However, he noted the region had recovered from previous crises such as the SARS outbreak in 2003.

“It’s out of the question that we consider Hong Kong as something that may not be a strong business center in the years to come. They are undergoing some difficulties for the time being, but we are fully confident that at some point they will recover,” he said.

Elsewhere, LVMH’s business is booming on the back of continued strong demand for its Louis Vuitton and Dior brands among Chinese, American and European consumers. As reported, the key fashion and leather goods division saw organic sales rise by 19 percent in the third quarter, sharply exceeding consensus estimates.

Vuitton enjoyed “excellent momentum” driven by all its businesses, with a pickup in demand by Chinese tourists in Europe. The group has expanded its production capacity with the opening last month of a new leather goods workshop in France, and has extended its “Louis Vuitton X” exhibition in Los Angeles by two months.

Dior registered good growth in all product categories, as well as an “excellent” response to the opening of its flagship on the Avenue des Champs-Élysées during the renovation of its historic Avenue Montaigne boutique. Loro Piana, Loewe, Rimowa and Berluti performed strongly, LVMH reported.

While Celine is poised to launch its first perfume collection under creative director Hedi Slimane, the brand has yet to reap the benefits of the full creative revamp he instigated last year, Guiony said.

“The initial signs of clients’ response to the new offer are positive and particularly in terms of traffic, but yet it will take some quarters — and I don’t know how many — before the branding and the new products planned bear full fruit. I will probably make the same answer for a number of quarters,” he said.

Wines and spirits were up 8 percent in the third quarter, fueled by growing U.S. demand for cognac and spirits. Guiony said LVMH would be cautious in its response to new U.S. tariffs on French wines, and will “think twice” before raising prices.

Perfumes and cosmetics recorded organic growth of 7 percent, below consensus estimates. “The big drop is definitely the U.S., where the whole industry, in my view, has been caught by surprise with the drop in the makeup business, which used to be thriving for the last 10 years and suddenly became negative in 2019,” said Guiony.

Watches and jewelry grew 5 percent, as Bulgari maintained its momentum despite its heavy exposure to Hong Kong, while selective retailing, which includes DFS and beauty retailer Sephora, was up 4 percent.

Sephora posted double-digit same-store growth in Asia and the Middle East during the quarter, versus low- to mid-single-digit growth in Europe and the U.S., Guiony said. It opened its first store in Auckland, New Zealand, in July, followed by Hong Kong in September, and South Korea is next in the cards.

DFS, meanwhile, will gain a foothold in Paris when LVMH reopens landmark Paris department store La Samaritaine next year as a multi-use project including a Cheval Blanc hotel. While declining to confirm the date of the reopening, Guiony said the cost of the launch would be limited.

“The first months of business will be loss-making, as it is obviously the case for each large opening, but that’s something that we shall be budgeting within the DFS numbers and we don’t expect something particularly meaningful there,” he said."
LVMH Luxury Ventures Invests in Madhappy Brand - WWD,"Thu, 10 Oct 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiPGh0dHBzOi8vd3dkLmNvbS9mZWF0dXJlL2x2bWgtaW52ZXN0cy1pbi1tYWRoYXBweS0xMjAzMzQwNTgxL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LVMH Luxury Ventures has found its latest investment vehicle: Madhappy.

The investment was recently posted on the LVMH site. No one from Madhappy or LVMH could be reached to comment further.

The Los Angeles-based direct-to-consumer brand was founded in 2017 by brothers Noah and Peiman Raf along with Mason Spector and Joshua Sitt, and its mission is to make the world a more optimistic place. It offers colorful basics for men and women, much of it in unisex sizing. Madhappy, which appeals primarily to an 18- to 30-year-old, is centered around the issue of mental health and it has built an active community through its physical activations, optimistic messaging and celebrity following.

Earlier this year it received a $1.5 million seed capital investment from the founders of Sweetgreen, MeUndies founder Jonathan Shokrian, Rick Caruso’s son Justin Caruso, Thor Equities chief executive officer and Joshua Sitt’s father Joseph Sitt, Amy Levin Klein, founder of College Fashionista, and Alfred Venture Partners.

In addition to Madhappy, LVMH Luxury Ventures, an entity within the Paris-based LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, took a minority investment in Gabriela Hearst in January. It also has stakes in Stadium Goods and L’Officine Universelle Buly, a Paris-based beauty emporium.

According to its web site, the Paris-based company invests in what it believes are “desirable, high-potential brands with clear identities…[and] significant growth potential.” Companies should have revenue of between 3 million euros and 30 million euros and the equity investment range from 2 million euros to 15 million euros, or 5 to 25 percent of the brand’s ownership. It targets companies in fashion, accessories, beauty, wellness, experiential luxury and selective retailing.

Madhappy recently opened a pop-up at 11 Howard Street in New York for the holiday season. It has also operated temporary retail locations on Melrose Place and Abbot Kinney in California, as well as Denver, Miami and Williamsburg, N.Y. Earlier this year, the company said it would use the investment to increase its digital advertising presence, add more pop-ups and hire additional staff."
LVMH wants to buy jeweler Tiffany's for $14.5 billion - CBS News,"Mon, 28 Oct 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNic25ld3MuY29tL25ld3MvbHZtaC10aWZmYW55cy1vZmZlci1vZi0xNC01LWJpbGxpb24tc2VuZHMtamV3ZWxlcnMtc3RvY2stcHJpY2Utc29hcmluZy_SAWhodHRwczovL3d3dy5jYnNuZXdzLmNvbS9hbXAvbmV3cy9sdm1oLXRpZmZhbnlzLW9mZmVyLW9mLTE0LTUtYmlsbGlvbi1zZW5kcy1qZXdlbGVycy1zdG9jay1wcmljZS1zb2FyaW5nLw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"French luxury group LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton is making a play for the iconic blue box, confirming Monday it has offered to buy Tiffany & Co. for $14.5 billion in cash, sending shares in the New York jeweler soaring.

The purchase would add another glittering household name to LVMH's plethora of upscale brands such as Christian Dior, Fendi and Givenchy, as well as watchmaker Tag Heuer. It would also give LVMH a much broader foothold in the United States and widen its offerings in jewelry.

Tiffany, which is trying to transform its brand to appeal to younger shoppers, could use a company with deep pockets to help expand its business. The New York-based luxury retail said Monday it was considering the offer for $120 a share, which is about $14.5 billion. The Wall Street Journal first reported on the offer over the weekend.

Tiffany shares jumped nearly 30% or $28.81, to $127.37 in early Monday trading, although LVMH cautioned in a brief statement that ""there can be no assurance that these discussions will result in any agreement.""

The offer comes as luxury goods companies have been wrestling with changing habits of shoppers who are increasingly buying online. They're also purchasing second-hand luxury items from consignment sellers like The RealReal.com.

In addition, luxury companies are facing fears of an economic slowdown in China, a key area of business growth the past decade, while they're already dealing with a slowdown in international tourism in the U.S.

Tiffany's was founded in 1837 by Connecticut jeweler Charles Lewis Tiffany and the brand name became world famous in the early 20th century under the artistic direction of his son Louis Comfort Tiffany.

Today's Tiiffany's, with about $4 billion in revenue, is famed for diamond and sterling silver jewelry packaged in boxes shaded a distinctive blue known as ""1837 Blue"" and sold at more than 250 stores in the U.S., Europe and Asia. Its Fifth Avenue flagship store at the corner of Manhattan's Fifth Avenue and 57th Street was made famous in the 1961 movie ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"" starring Audrey Hepburn.

Under its CEO, Alessandro Bogliolo, Tiffany is trying to appeal to younger shoppers with more modern takes on jewelry. Earlier this year, it launched a men's jewelry collection, and it's increasing its marketing to a more diverse customer base like same-sex couples. It's also been renovating its flagship store in Manhattan.

Still, Tiffany's U.S. sales have been stagnating as China's slowing economy has weighed on spending by Chinese tourists, who make up a substantial portion of luxury spending. The strong dollar has also made Tiffany products more expensive for consumers outside the U.S.

""We believe Tiffany has many characteristics that are difficult to replicate and represent competitive advantages,"" wrote Oliver Chen, luxury analyst at Cowen & Co., an investment research firm. He noted Tiffany's diamond polishing facilities and long-term relationships with diamond mines as well as its bridal expertise and long-term growth potential with China.

LVMH competes with the Kering Group, which owns Gucci and Saint Laurent, and Richemont SA, which owns Cartier."
Rimowa Turned Luggage Into a Status Symbol. Can It Sell Fashion? - The Business of Fashion,"Thu, 17 Oct 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzb2ZmYXNoaW9uLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy9sdXh1cnkvcmltb3dhLWZhc2hpb24tbHZtaC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Paris, France — Did LVMH buy Rimowa for the wheels?

That’s the word on the street amongst some industry insiders, who suggest the brand’s high-tech wheels could end up on Louis Vuitton luggage in the near future. The German hardside-luggage maker’s 360-degree wheel technology is certainly nothing to sniff at: hundreds of online reviews praise the smooth ride they deliver when you’re manoeuvring your hardcase through the airport.

But it's doubtful Rimowa's wheels alone were worth the €640 million LVMH spent to acquire an 80 percent majority stake in the brand in 2016. While other brands in the group are using some elements of the manufacturer's proprietary technology in their products, the wheels remain exclusive to Rimowa for now. Besides, LVMH's ambitions for the brand are far wider.

Indeed, it's a good time to be Rimowa. Founded in Cologne, Germany in 1898, the company is uniquely positioned to benefit from the shift in discretionary spending from things to experiences, especially travel.

In 2018, tourists made 1.4 billion international arrivals, up 6 percent from 2017 and significantly outpacing the 3.7 percent growth in the global economy that same year, according to the World Tourism Organization, a United Nations agency. Chinese tourists are driving the uptick. While the World Tourism Organization says that just 9 percent of Chinese citizens owned a passport in 2018, about 149.7 million Chinese residents took international trips in 2018, up 1,326 percent from 10.5 million in 2000.

All those tourists need suitcases. So, it's no surprise that global sales of luggage are forecasted to reach $27.5 billion by 2025, up from $22 billion this year, according to market research firm Euromonitor International. What's more, for upwardly mobile Millennials, luggage is a new status symbol: something covered on Highsnobiety and Hypebeast alongside luxury streetwear and sneakers. For them, suitcases are fashion and Rimowa makes the coolest of them all, far more broadly desirable than niche players like Globe-Trotter and mass brands like Tumi and Samsonite.

Away, a New York-based direct-to-consumer travel start-up that was valued at $1.4 billion in May 2019, presents the biggest challenge to Rimowa. Away’s hardside bags — which now include aluminium — cost roughly a third of Rimowa’s products. (A large aluminium carry-on from Away is $495, while Rimowa’s comparable Original Cabin Plus bag is $1,250).

Rimowa Chief Executive Alexandre Arnault acknowledges that Away — which reportedly generated around $150 million in sales in 2018 — has captured a lot of attention in the US, especially among young professionals not quite ready to trade up to Rimowa. But he is not convinced that the customer overlap is high.

“They are the loudest ones in the US now, and we’re happy to have them shine a light on the category,” Arnault said. “But we’re very different brands in terms of quality and design. They’ve done a great job building this brand from scratch, and we’re completely coexisting.”

Over the past three years, Arnault has been working to transform Rimowa's own position in the market. With the support of former Chief Brand Officer Hector Muelas (who departed for Apple in June 2019), Arnault has worked to boost Rimowa's cool by animating what he describes as a ""bit cold, geometric"" product through storytelling. Rimowa has a lot of famous globe-trotting fans, many of whom wrote to Arnault after the acquisition, declaring their devotion. He enlisted several of them to appear in advertising campaigns, including Roger Federer, LeBron James, pianist Yuja Wang and Louis Vuitton men's designer Virgil Abloh. He has also launched collaborations with Abloh, Supreme, artist Alex Israel and Dior men's designer Kim Jones.

These partnerships have attracted the young streetwear crowd, earning plenty of media coverage. But while Millennials are set to account for half of luxury spending worldwide by 2025, Arnault insists he’s not chasing a demographic.

“One thing we have voluntarily never done is have a collaboration committee where we say, ‘Okay, we need to target 18-34-year-olds that have this net worth because we need to be cool with Millennials,’” he said. “A lot of brands are doing that today. As a Millennial myself I think it’s very dangerous and scary, because when a brand targets me like this, I feel it immediately and I kind of run away.”

In 2015, the year before LVMH bought Rimowa, it generated €440 million ($488 million) in sales. In its first two years as part of the group, Rimowa’s sales contracted as Arnault exited hundreds of unfavourable wholesale arrangements. At the time, it had more than 5,000 points of sale, many of which were independent travel stores, which could price the product any which way they like. (About 85 percent of the business was done through wholesale or franchise partnerships.) This meant that pricing was wildly inconsistent. A case could be €800 ($887) in one place, €400 ($443) in another. Arnault pulled the product out of the majority of those stores, buying back about half of the inventory, and recalibrating prices so that they were better harmonised. (Prices have increased an average 20 percent overall.)

Today, the breakdown of the business has flipped: 80 percent of sales are made directly through the company’s stores, with 20 percent contributed by multi-brand retailers and a few remaining franchise agreements. There are just 500 points of sale, including 105 directly owned stores.

Despite the necessary sales drop, Arnault said the company was able to maintain profitability over the course of the reorganisation.

“The group can afford to have some unprofitable brands... but we’ve always felt that if we were profitable and cash-generating, we’d be free to make the decisions we want to make,” he said.

This year has marked a return to growth, with 2019 sales set to be “way higher” than the €440 million figure from 2015. (LVMH does not break out sales for individual brands, so Arnault could not share a specific number.) However, sales are set to double in the next “four-to-five years,” which would set up Rimowa to hit €1 billion in revenue in less than a decade of operating within the LVMH fold.

By no means would this make Rimowa the largest brand in the group, but it wouldn’t be the smallest either. Its rate of growth is outpacing that of most soft luxury labels, which can take more than a decade to achieve similar results, even with a hit handbag (or three).

Arnault was able to make the shift so quickly, in part, because of LVMH’s vast real estate portfolio, which allowed him to open up — and renovate — Rimowa stores at a steady clip. The label is also in the viable position of being underpenetrated in both the US and Asia, with zero presence in the Middle East prior to the acquisition. (Germany remains its largest market.) There’s digital opportunity, too. Online sales have grown from zilch to 10 percent of the business since 2015, and Arnault hopes to get that number to 20 percent.

But he also updated the product, changing the design of 100 percent of the offering and working with Rimowa’s vertically integrated factories in Germany, as well as suppliers of spare parts, to improve the quality of the goods. He also worked on improving lead times on popular styles, which were once up to a year-and-a-half in certain circumstances, by building a 50-person-plus team dedicated to supply-chain efficiency.

“We’re taking inspiration from the Apples and Teslas of the world, not the luxury brands,” he said. In part, that means reducing the number of products on offer, but increasing the number of colours and customisation possibilities in order to appeal to different audience segments.

We're taking inspiration from the Apples and Teslas of the world, not the luxury brands.

To market Rimowa’s new look, Arnault did away with print advertising, making it the only LVMH-owned brand to devote all of its advertising spend to digital, noting that he prefers the transparent, data-driven analytics offered by online advertising.

According to LVMH Chief Digital Officer Ian Rogers, who works across the group, Arnault's success has come from his ability to balance the new with the old. ""He's not losing what's great about the way LVMH does things,"" he said, citing Rimowa's ramped up retail network and refined distribution system. ""He's modernising very selectively. There's a lot of subtlety to it.""

But in order to maintain such momentum, Arnault plans to take Rimowa far beyond the baggage carousel.

“Ultimately, the dream is to sell the experience of not having a suitcase; that you go to Tokyo and your suitcase will be there, with everything you need inside. But this is a bit utopian,” he said. “Right now, the brand is only linked to the terrible parts of travelling: to the airport and from the airport. When it comes to the enjoyable parts, there is zero interaction. I want the customer to interact with the brand a bit more on a day-to-day basis.”

With Dior, Rimowa recently made its first foray into handbags, including clutch bags and backpacks for Kim Jones’ Spring/ Summer 2020 runway show.

“In a way, it’s not farfetched. Louis Vuitton was also born in luggage to then move into handbags,” said Luca Solca, a luxury analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein Schweiz. “So why not Rimowa? I wonder how you can translate the hard-shell design DNA into handbags, though.”

Credibly moving Rimowa into handbags will be challenging. Prada and Louis Vuitton both successfully transitioned from luggage to fashionable accessories, but their material of choice was nylon and canvas, respectively. Hard metal and plastic, on the other hand, are less adaptable to the soft-goods model.

But Arnault is undeterred.

The third-born, 27-year-old son of LVMH Chairman and Chief Executive Bernard Arnault, Alexandre did not attend business school, instead earning a postgraduate degree in research innovation from the École Polytechnique, his father's alma mater. Nonetheless, he talks in the vernacular of a Harvard MBA, trying to build a new kind of culture at Rimowa. The brand's wood-panelled offices feel more start-up than luxury, complete with ping pong tables and stand-up desks, resulting in an upbeat, crackling energy that feels less reserved than elsewhere at LVMH.

“We’re trying to build a case study within the group,” Arnault said. “The main thing that is driving us is culture. We’re more American than European, and definitely not luxury [in that way].”

Rimowa is not the only experiment bubbling at LVMH. There's Rihanna's Fenty fashion play, as well as Guillaume Henry's new Patou. But these projects are relatively small in comparison to Rimowa. And, critically, they don't have an Arnault at the helm.

LVMH 16% Revenue Growth Louis Vuitton and Dior - HYPEBEAST,"Fri, 11 Oct 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vaHlwZWJlYXN0LmNvbS8yMDE5LzEwL2x2bWgtdGhpcmQtcXVhcnRlci1yZXZlbnVlLWdyb3d0aC1sb3Vpcy12dWl0dG9uLWRpb3LSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LVMH recently released its third quarter financial report, which detailed an astonishing 16 percent increase in total revenue, as well as a 15 percent organic revenue growth for the company’s fashion and leather goods group alone. According to the report, the world’s largest luxury group earned a total of €38.4 billion EUR (approx. $42.4 billion USD)​ in revenue during the first nine months of 2019.

Vogue Business reported that LVMH confirms high sales from Louis Vuitton and Christian Dior largely contributed to the impressive statistics. LVMH CFO Jean-Jacques Guiony noted in a recent call with investors that when it comes to both brands, “the recipe works, and we do not change the recipe.” He continues to explain that the “winning formula” is “a combination of distribution investments and product investments,” also stating that “there is not a particular product responsible for the growth.” Perhaps appointing Virgil Abloh as Louis Vuitton’s menswear designer and Kim Jones as Dior’s artistic director are continuing to pay off.

To accommodate growing sales, Louis Vuitton recently announced that it aims to create around 1,500 new jobs through new production facilities in its home country of France, and Dior recently opened a new boutique in Paris.

Sylvie Bénard works with LVMH’s brands to manage the trade-off between environmental impact and creating “the perfect product”.

The length and complexity of fashion’s supply chains means that some brands have been slower to reduce their impact compared to counterparts in other industries.

LVMH is taking a wait-and-see approach to the Kering-led Fashion Pact, which it is concerned doesn’t account for its many activities in other sectors.

NEW YORK— Sylvie Bénard, the senior vice president of environment at LVMH, has been focused on sustainability long before it was a fashion industry buzzword. “We’ve been working on this for a very long time, but nobody is aware of that because we weren’t talking about it and it wasn’t a hot topic,” she said during a recent series of interviews in New York and Cape Town.

As the world’s largest luxury group, LVMH’s environmental impact is currently very much under the spotlight. LVMH chairman and chief executive Bernard Arnault made headlines recently during a September sustainability event in Paris when he charged climate activist Greta Thunberg with “surrendering completely to catastrophism”.

The company’s name was also absent from the list of 56 signatures to the Fashion Pact, an initiative to combat climate change spearheaded by arch-rival Kering. Bénard chalks this up to LVMH being “more than just a fashion and leather goods group” — 59 per cent of its €38.4 billion in annual revenue comes from non-fashion and leather businesses — whose environmental goals aren’t necessarily similar to those of companies in the pact.

Mild-mannered and warmer than one might expect for a luxury fashion executive, Bénard’s increased public visibility comes as luxury companies face a surge in consumer demand for more transparent and eco-friendly practices. She admits that this shift is challenging for luxury groups with immense global carbon footprints and a history of burning excess goods. “We’re used to saying that our products are perfect… but when it comes to the environment, there is no perfect product. The perfect product is the one that doesn’t exist.”

Hiring the right people

LVMH has made significant investments in becoming more eco-friendly. Earlier this year, the French group acquired a minority stake in Stella McCartney and appointed the namesake designer as a special advisor on sustainability to Arnault. It also made an investment in Gabriela Hearst, who recently worked with the consultancy Eco Act on her first carbon-neutral runway show. “Becoming more sustainable is not a straight line — it’s a practice like yoga, where it’s really challenging in the beginning, and you need to be consistent,” said Hearst during a sustainability-themed event at the IAC building in New York on 24 October."
Forget Tapestry's 5% Dividend -- LVMH Is Still the Better Luxury Stock - The Motley Fool,"Sun, 20 Oct 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDE5LzEwLzIwL2ZvcmdldC10YXBlc3RyeS1sdm1oLWlzLXRoZS1iZXR0ZXItbHV4dXJ5LXN0b2NrLmFzcHjSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Why buy a mid-range underdog when you can buy the high-end king?

Tapestry (TPR -2.93%), the parent company of Coach, Kate Spade, and Stuart Weitzman, has disappointed investors as its stock plunged roughly 40% over the past 12 months. During the same period, shares of its upscale rival LVMH (LVMUY -1.91%) -- which owns Louis Vuitton, Dior, and Sephora -- surged nearly 40%.

Tapestry struggled with sluggish sales growth (especially at Kate Spade), declining margins, and tariffs. Meanwhile, LVMH's revenue growth and margins stayed robust as demand for its broad portfolio of luxury goods rose.

But after Tapestry's big drop, some value-seeking investors might be drawn to the stock's forward P/E ratio of 9 and its forward yield of 5.2%. LVMH trades at nearly 30 times earnings and pays a forward yield of 1.6%. However, Tapestry is cheap for obvious reasons, while LVMH's strengths justify its premium.

A better diversified business

Tapestry's top brand is Coach, which generated 71% of its revenue in fiscal 2019 (which ended on June 29). Kate Spade generated 23% of its revenue, while Stuart Weitzman accounted for the remaining 6%.

LVMH owns 75 brands across five main businesses: fashion and leather goods (41% of its revenue in the first nine months of 2019), selective retailing (27% of revenue), perfumes and cosmetics (13% of revenue), wines and spirits (10% of revenue), and watches and jewelry (8% of revenue).

Tapestry generated 61% of its revenue from North America in 2019, followed by 17% from Asia (excluding China), 15% from China, and 7% from other markets. Coach's massive exposure to North America and China could be major liabilities as the trade war escalates. It's already struggling with a 25% tariff on its Chinese-made handbags and the new 10% tariff on products like apparel and footwear.

LVMH's revenue is more evenly distributed, with sales to the U.S. and China accounting for less than half its total revenue. As a French company, LVMH isn't exposed to the trade war between the U.S. and China, although the U.S. recently hit its wines and spirits business with higher tariffs.

Tapestry sells ""affordable luxury"" brands for middle class shoppers, who generally rein in their spending during economic downturns. Most of LVMH's brands serve higher-end customers who don't struggle as much during recessions. All these factors make LVMH a more well-rounded luxury company than Tapestry.

Better growth rates

Tapestry's total revenue rose just 3% (4% in constant currency terms) to $6.03 billion in 2019. Coach's revenue and global comparable store sales both rose 2% on a constant currency basis. Kate Spade's revenue rose 7% on the same basis, driven by new store openings, but its comps declined 7%, indicating that its stores weren't retaining customers. Stuart Weitzman's revenue rose 6%, but the brand remains too small to move the needle.

LVMH's total revenue rose 16% annually (11% on an organic basis) to 38.4 billion euros ($42.4 billion) in the first nine months of 2019. All of its business units posted strong organic growth, with the fashion and leather goods group leading the charge with an 18% jump.

LVMH noted that its sales in Hong Kong fell 25% annually during the third quarter, but it easily offset that softness with the stronger growth of other markets like mainland China. That's a stark contrast to other luxury retailers like Tiffany & Co. (TIF), which remains dangerously overexposed to the Hong Kong market.

Tapestry's adjusted net income, which excluded a big tax benefit, fell 1% to $749 million in 2019 as its margins contracted in the fourth quarter. LVMH's net income rose 18% to 6.35 billion euros ($7.01 billion) in 2018, and climbed another 9% to 3.27 billion ($3.61 billion) in the first half of 2019.

In other words, LVMH is several times larger than Tapestry, but still consistently generates better revenue and profit growth than its American rival.

The key takeaway

When Tapestry was still known as Coach, it acquired Kate Spade and Stuart Weitzman to diversify its portfolio. However, all three are fickle mid-range brands that are less resilient than upscale powerhouse brands like Louis Vuitton and Dior.

Tapestry's growth is plateauing due to market saturation and macro challenges, while LVMH is still charging ahead. That's why LVMH should remain a better luxury stock than Tapestry for the foreseeable future, and why it deserves its premium valuation."
How did Louis Vuitton’s Bernard Arnault make US$5 billion in 3 days? - Style,"Tue, 15 Oct 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjbXAuY29tL21hZ2F6aW5lcy9zdHlsZS9uZXdzLXRyZW5kcy9hcnRpY2xlLzMwMzI5NTgvaG93LWRpZC1sb3Vpcy12dWl0dG9ucy1iZXJuYXJkLWFybmF1bHQtZWFybi1tb3JlLWRydWfSAXZodHRwczovL2FtcC5zY21wLmNvbS9tYWdhemluZXMvc3R5bGUvbmV3cy10cmVuZHMvYXJ0aWNsZS8zMDMyOTU4L2hvdy1kaWQtbG91aXMtdnVpdHRvbnMtYmVybmFyZC1hcm5hdWx0LWVhcm4tbW9yZS1kcnVn?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Most of Arnault’s wealth comes from the 41 per cent stake in LVMH he controls through his company Christian Dior, according to his Bloomberg profile. Shares in LVMH – which holds around 60 brands including fashion houses Louis Vuitton, Fendi, Givenchy and Kenzo – are up over 50 per cent in 2019 so far, according to Forbes.

The LVMH conglomerate he manages enjoyed a sudden stock surge, following the release of an earnings report showing strong second-quarter sales, on October 9 – adding a total of US$5.1 billion to its CEO’s holdings in just 72 hours.

Luxury CEO Bernard Arnault earned more than US$5 billion in just three days, according to Forbes.

Here are five facts that show how fast Arnault’s fortune has grown

1. In January, Arnault was ranked as the world’s fourth richest person – fast forward six months to mid-July and he had jumped two major spots

The 70-year-old was the fourth-richest person alive at the start of 2019, according to both the Bloomberg Billionaires Index and Forbes’ The World’s Billionaires List. Since then, he has made so much money that he displaced both Warren Buffett and Bill Gates to rank second, for a time. He has since returned to third place on the real-time Bloomberg ranking.

His net worth was US$68.6 billion on January 1, according to Bloomberg. Now, he is ranked third on the same list and his net worth stands at US$96.3 billion.

2. In the first three months of 2019, Arnault added more than US$14 billion to his net worth – roughly the equivalent of Mexican drug lord Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán’s entire empire

By March, Arnault had already added more than US$14 billion to his net worth, overtaking Buffett’s wealth. Law enforcement estimates that El Chapo’s entire drug empire is worth US$14 billion, Business Insider previously reported.

3. Arnault is one of only six people to ever rank second on Forbes' list of the richest billionaires

The others are current number one Jeff Bezos, Gates, Buffett, Zara co-founder Amancio Ortega and Mexican telecoms magnate Carlos Slim Helú. In July, Arnault overtook Gates to become the second-richest person in the world, Business Insider reported.

4. Arnault has made more money in 2019 than anyone else listed in the Bloomberg Billionaires Index

Bill Gates, who is now back at No 2, has made US$16 billion so far in 2019. Jeff Bezos, who holds onto his No 1 spot, has lost about US$1 billion, according to the index. And Arnault has earned more than US$28.5, according to Bloomberg.

5. Arnault’s personal wealth gains in the first six months of 2019 – a reported US$39 billion – are on par with Apple’s App Store and Google Play’s combined revenue in the same period, as reported by TechCrunch.

LVMH's Luxury Ventures Fund Invests in 2-Year Old Streetwear Brand Madhappy - The Fashion Law,"Thu, 10 Oct 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWZhc2hpb25sYXcuY29tL2x2bWgtbHV4dXJ5LXZlbnR1cmVzLWludmVzdHMtaW4tc3RyZWV0d2Vhci1icmFuZC1tYWRoYXBweS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton has added a new brand as a recipient of investment in its roster of emerging-stage fashion, cosmetics or accessories companies. The Paris-based luxury conglomerate’s LVMH Luxury Ventures subsidiary revealed that it has taken a stake Madhappy, the 2-year old streetwear-slash-loungewear brand that has found a core following amongst 18 to 30 year-olds thanks to its color streetwear-esque wares and positivity-centric messaging.

Founded in April 2017 by 20-somethings Peiman Raf and his brother, celebrity stylist Noah Raf, along with partners Mason Spector and Joshua Sitt, the buzzy young brand has swiftly found fans both in consumers and investors. Madhappy – which now has outposts on Melrose Place in Los Angeles and Howard Street in New York, and has hosted a score of popups in places, such as Miami and Aspen – is fresh from a $1.8 million seed round in March, drawing funds from MeUndies founder Jonathan Shokrian, College Fashionista founder Amy Levin Klein, founders from Sweetgreen, and Justin Caruso, the son of American retail real estate magnate Rick Caruso.

While the financial details of the deal from LVMH Luxury Ventures standpoint have not been disclosed, a spokesman for LVMH said in 2017 that investments made by the newly-formed subsidiary – which has backed sustainable luxury brand Gabriela Hearst and sneaker/streetwear consignment company Stadium Goods, the latter of which has since been acquired by Farfetch – would generally range from 2 million euros to 10 million euros.

As for the targets of its investments, Reuters reported in the past that LVMH Luxury Ventures “will buy stakes in luxury companies with sales of between 2 million and 5 million euros and a high-growth potential.” While Madhappy’s annual revenues, for its first full year in business at least, fall below that, totaling $1 million for 2018, Business of Fashion notes that LVMH’s “bet on a tiny streetwear label is a sign of the luxury giant’s eagerness to get on board with start-up culture and emerging fashion business models, even as its parent steers some of the industry’s biggest brands.”

“LVMH is not trying to recreate [streetwear] from a distance by copying after the fact,” Shireen Jiwan, founder of Sleuth Brand Consulting told BoF. Instead, by way of investments like this and the appointment of figures like Virgil Abloh to top spots under its main umbrella, “they’re getting in front of it by collaborating with the organic creators of this new way of living, working, wanting, shopping, being.”"

Oct 10, 2019

Luxury conglomerate has acquired a stake in Madhappy, the American direct-to-consumer casualwear brand.

The Paris based luxury behemoth made the investment via LVMH Luxury Ventures, a vehicle with the group.



The move marks the latest surprising investment by LVMH Luxury Ventures, which had previously taken minority stakes in Gabriela Hearst; and Officine Universelle Buly, an ancient French beauty marque.

Madhappy bills itself as “an inclusive community of local optimists.” According to Madhappy’s website: “We create exceptional products with our own flair. Host impactful experiences around the world. And strive to give a platform to mental health conversation.”



The brand is rather distant from LVMH’s couture houses like Christian or with their $250,000 wedding dresses. Its entry-level crewneck sweatshirt, tagged with Optimism, is priced at $160.



LVMH Luxury Ventures confirmed the investment in a statement made to FashionNetwork.com: ""This decision is part of our desire to diversify our portfolio of investments in recognized brands, be it Gabriela Hearst or in emerging brands, such as Madhappy, which demonstrate an interesting approach and that we want to support in their development.”



Madhappy had no comment on the development.



Madhappy was co-founded in Los Angeles in 2017 by Peiman Raf, his brother Raf, and friends Joshua Sitt and Mason Spector, creating a limited range of hoodies, sweatpants, T-shirts and hats, all carrying the brand’s sans-serif logo. Since then, the brand has opened over a half-dozen pop-ups in LA; two in New York; two in Aspen and one in Miami. While building a cult following by collaborating with brands like Jon and Vinnys, Pencils of Promise and Alfred Coffee. With 45,000 followers and fans like , Anwar Hadid and The Weeknd, the brand certainly built momentum.



In March, Madhappy raised some $2 million in a founding round from strategic investors that included Sweetgreen, MeUndies and Justin Caruso, son of real estate magnate Rick Caruso. Funds used to develop its website and open new pop-ups, like one in Williamsburg.

Naomi Campbell Discusses Her Iconic Fall on Vivienne Westwood’s Runway (Youtube)

One of Vivienne Westwood’s hallmark designs are her sky-high platform heels. They’re so tricky to walk in, that even a pro like Naomi Campbell had trouble. In fact, she took a tumble on Westwood’s runway in 1993. Recently, British Vogue had the designer and the model sit down in conversation, and naturally the big fall came up. Campbell admits she was embarrassed about the fall. “I felt like I should have practiced more. And that comes from my training in dance,” she explains. “I know how to walk in those shoes now. There’s a trick to walking in those shoes!” The trick being to put your weight on your toes, not your heel.

But Westwood refused to let Campbell take the blame, instead noting that the model was also wearing tricky rubber stockings that hindered her movement. There seems to be some truth to this — when Campbell hit the runway again in the show, she did so without the tights, and nailed her walk in the shoes. The whole interview is worth a watch, especially when the duo discuss the aftermath of the fall. Campbell explains that the amount of press it generated sparked other designers to ask her to fall on their runway.

The Rise of “Closet Accounts” on Instagram (New York Times)

Teenagers are leading a burgeoning industry on Instagram: closet accounts, which identify the pieces of clothing worn by celebrities and influencers. Those who run the accounts scour the internet to track down the exact brands worn, and the prices of the pieces. It might be a niche genre on the ‘gram, but it’s quite competitive. New accounts pop-up every day, all racing to be the first to find items. Running these pages is hard work, but it’s easy to see why followers are so interested in them — it’s the easiest way to know the exact brands and pieces their favorite celebs, TV characters, and influencers are wearing.

LVMH’s revenue in the third quarter was 13.3 billion, up 17% compared to the same period in 2018. Organic revenue growth was 11% for the first nine months of the year and the company stated despite the difficult context in Hong Kong, the region had a good performance."

Big names have been paired up with brands before, Nicole Kidman in a Baz Lurhrman Moulin Rouge-esque creation for Chanel No 5, Charlize Theron wrapped up in slinky gold for Dior, but few have made such a mark as Audrey Hepburn for Tiffany & Co. What she did for the brand, jewelled up for a Breakfast at Tiffany’s publicity poster in a 128.54 carat diamond necklace, is a timeless piece of marketing. A timeless piece of elegance, where the beauty of the jewel is finally matched by the beauty of the beholder. Perhaps it’s something that has contributed to they company’s recent valuation at roughly $14.5 billion?

The valuation follows a bid by the world’s biggest luxury group, LVMH, run by French billionaire – and the country’s richest man – Bernard Arnault. It’s a company that has the likes of Moët & Chandon, Louis Vuitton and Fendi within its roster. Tiffany & Co would be one of its splashiest deals to date; other high dollar acquisition deals include Christian Dior for $13 billion, and last year it snapped up the chic Belmond hotel chain for $2.6 billion."
YG Entertainment To Pay LVMH Over 64 Billion Won Following Investment Maturity - soompi,"Thu, 10 Oct 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNvb21waS5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS8xMzU4MDY2d3BwL3lnLWVudGVydGFpbm1lbnQtdG8tcGF5LWx2bWgtb3Zlci02NC1iaWxsaW9uLXdvbi1mb2xsb3dpbmctaW52ZXN0bWVudC1tYXR1cml0eS1kYXRl0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"On October 10, YG Entertainment officially announced that the company will be returning 64.7 billion won (approximately $54.1 million) to Great World Music Investment.

Great Music World Investment is a subsidiary of LVMH Moët Hennessy – Louis Vuitton SE (hereafter LVMH). In October 2014, LVMH invested money in redeemable convertible preference shares (RCPS) of YG Entertainment. At the time of investment, LVMH set the option of converting into common stock at 43,574 won (approximately $36.46) per share or a repayment of 67 billion won (approximately $56 million), which includes an annual interest of two percent, after five years.

If YG’s stocks were priced higher than 43,574 won per share, LVMH would have profited by converting their shares into common stock. However, YG’s stock prices have continued to fall due to recent controversies surrounding the company. The agency’s stocks are currently priced at 23,550 won (approximately $19.73), leading LVMH to choose the latter option.

Regarding the payment, YG Entertainment explained, “It was made following the maturity date of the RCPS that was issued on October 15, 2014.”

Why Louis Vuitton opened a factory on a ranch in Texas - Yahoo Finance,"Fri, 18 Oct 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy93aHktbG91aXMtdnVpdHRvbi1vcGVuZWQtZmFjdG9yeS0xNzM3NTU2NjkuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"U.S. President Donald Trump speaks next to Louis Vuitton's Chairman and CEO of Luxury goods group LVMH Bernard Arnault during his visit to the Louis Vuitton Rochambeau Ranch leather workshop in Texas.

Johnson County, Texas, a sparse stretch of grassland just south of Fort Worth, is not the place you imagine France’s Louis Vuitton producing luxury handbags. But since June, a workshop on a ranch there has been busy making six styles of bags and backpacks for the world’s biggest luxury brand.

Why Texas? Money, of course.

Louis Vuitton is the largest brand of LVMH, the luxury conglomerate, and the US one of its most lucrative markets. Despite an overall decline in US spending on handbags, LVMH’s US sales have continued to grow. In a statement, the company said the new facility is opening to “meet the ever-growing demand for Louis Vuitton products in the American market.”

In 2018, LVMH did about $12.5 billion in sales (pdf) in the US. Technically Asia brought in more, but that was across all of Asia, excluding Japan. “The US market is number one for LVMH in the world,” Bernard Arnault, CEO and chairman of LVMH, Louis Vuitton’s parent company, said at a ribbon-cutting ceremony yesterday (Oct. 17), according to a local NBC affiliate. Joining him was US president Donald Trump. They spoke and took pictures with the workshop’s employees against a backdrop that included the flags of France, the US, and Texas.

Local manufacturing has long been a key part of its business. The company already runs two manufacturing workshops in California. Over the past 30 years, the New York Times notes, about half the bags Louis Vuitton has sold in the US were made in the US.

U.S. President Donald Trump holds a purse as he visits the Louis Vuitton Rochambeau Ranch leather workshop in Texas.

Trump inspects the goods with Michael Burke, CEO of Louis Vuitton, and Arnault.

Being able to produce more bags within US borders offers some important advantages. One, Louis Vuitton can avoid import duties on its products, including any new tariffs Trump may impose as his trade spats escalate. (So far those haven’t been a major issue for Louis Vuitton.)

Story continues

Perhaps more importantly, it allows the company to respond quickly to demand. Louis Vuitton has been bolstering its supply chain, improving its speed and data-crunching ability as it works to keep up with rising sales globally. The faster it gets, the fewer products it has to produce in advance, cutting down waste and costs. “We used to forecast—now we react,” Louis Vuitton CEO Michael Burke told Bloomberg last month.

Rather than ship products from Europe to stores in US cities, it can do it much more quickly and cheaply from Texas and California. The company told the New York Times it chose Texas for its central location, giving it easy access to the coasts, as well as its history as a leatherworking center. Johnson County gave it a 10-year, 75% tax abatement worth about $91,900 a year, though it said that wasn’t central to its decision to open the new facility.

Louis Vuitton says the workshop will ultimately create about 1,000 jobs for the area. At the ribbon-cutting, Trump praised the company for its $50-million investment in Texas. “Today, we continue the extraordinary revival of American manufacturing, and we proudly celebrate the opening of the brand-new Louis Vuitton—a name I know very well,” he said. “It cost me a lot of money over the years.”

Op-ed: LVMH's CEO Bernard Arnault's second meeting with Donald Trump puts fashion's political pyramid into ... - nss magazine,"Thu, 17 Oct 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5zc21hZy5jb20vZW4vZmFzaGlvbi8xOTc3My9sdm1oLWFybmF1bHQtdHJ1bXAtdGV4YXPSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Every now and then, in between seasons, the collections of a few fashion houses may be influenced by the highly political times in which we live. Some designers may often use fashion as a vessel to tell stories or stand in solidarity against certain social issues. For instance, the past few seasons Maria Grazia Chiuri has used her Christian Dior collections as a championing voice for the cause of feminism and female rights; Stella McCartney uses her clothing and her personal platforms to raise awareness around climate change and sustainability; Virgil Abloh since his appointment at Louis Vuitton depicts alternate ideas of black identity; and Rihanna, the owner of Fenty Maison & Fenty Beauty, has clear ideas of issues such as immigration rights. These brands are only a few of the LVMH-owned names that have expressed their clear liberal stances against a few controversial social issues both through the designing of collections and through their personal platforms.

Yet, this Thursday, the pinnacle of this luxury fashion conglomerate, LVMH chairman and CEO Bernard Arnault along with a few of his executives are set to once again join hands with Donald Trump — a republican who denies the existence of climate change, has been accused of sexual assault on several accounts and proudly holds a “build the wall” stance in regards to immigrants.

Now some may classify the meeting set for today as strictly and simply business seeing that its purpose is for Louis Vuitton to follow up on their pledge to provide a number of new jobs for American workers. Yet a few things including Bernard Arnault’s recent comments in referral to climate Activist Greta Thunberg as “demoralizing” and the mere fact of them meeting and turning into a photo op for the press makes us wonder if the world’s second-richest man may have a bit more in common with Trump than we thought. Louis Vuitton already has two workshops in California, so it may be in question as to why they are now opting to open a new factory in the middle of the woods in Texas, however, it seems as if the French company is getting a pretty good deal. Two years ago, the Johnson County implemented a 75 percent tax abatement, which allows businesses registered in Texas like this Louis Vuitton factory to have around $91,900 deducted from the amounts which they would have had to pay for taxes. The local commissioners meeting to approve this deal was apparently filled with residents in opposition, but regardless, it was approved.

It may not seem like much now, but in the context of fashion, everything is representative of something greater, “just business” also comes with expectations. Brands, designers, and even magazines are held responsible not only for their actions but for the actions of who they choose to associate and do business with. Last season, a few New York-based brands pulled their shows from the famous Hudson Yards building after finding out the brand’s developer Stephen Ross was financially supporting Trump’s re-election; Net-a-Porter & Yoox pledged to pull Dolce & Gabbana products from their Chinese platforms following the D&G scandal and Vogue ceased their relationships with photographers Mario Testino & Bruce Weber after multiple allegations of sexual assault. If any of these platforms hadn’t made the necessary steps to disassociate themselves from their controversial business acquaintances, it’s likely they would have then experienced the social and financial consequences which came with it.

So it’s safe to say in fashion we try to hold our people to higher moral standards including within our business relations. So does this exempt French billionaires? If any designer was photographed shaking hands with Donald Trump or any of his counterparts, their brand would possibly experience major backlash following the photo’s release, but the truth is Arnault sits too high on the throne of his 100.1 billion USD net worth to currently suffer any real backlash of partnering with someone such as Trump. A multiple brand boycott would only leave scores of innocent workers without jobs as they get caught in the crossfire, which would make no sense. However if not more careful with whom they shake hands, the French conglomerate could suffer consequences in regards to shaping the future of their brands, as the new wave of promising upcoming designers including names like Marine Serre, Kerby Jean Raymond, and Richard Quinn come with strong political views that do not include the likes of figures such as Trump."
LVMH reports robust growth for first nine-months revenue - DFNIonline.com,"Wed, 09 Oct 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRmbmlvbmxpbmUuY29tL2xlYWQtc3Rvcmllcy9sdm1oLXJlcG9ydHMtcm9idXN0LWdyb3d0aC1maXJzdC1uaW5lLW1vbnRocy1yZXZlbnVlLTA5LTEwLTIwMTkv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Luxury brand house LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton has reported a 16% increase in group revenue, reaching €38.4 billion in the first nine months of 2019. Organic revenue grew 11% compared to the same period in 2018.

In the third quarter, revenue was up 17% compared to the same period in 2018. Organic revenue growth was 11%, a performance in line with the trend recorded in the first half of the year. The United States and Europe saw good progress in the third quarter, as did Asia, despite the difficult context in Hong Kong.

For its Selective Retailing business division, where DFS sits, the group achieved organic revenue growth of 6% (11% reported) in the first nine months of 2019. This was despite the challenging retail environment in Hong Kong where DFS has seen a downturn in sales.

At DFS, the company said, “the Venice Galleria location is enjoying good momentum, benefiting in particular from strong demand from international travellers. DFS continued to grow over the first nine months of the year despite the slowdown in Hong Kong.”

LVMH has recently made cuts to its DFS workforce in Hawaii as a response to a downturn in Asian tourist numbers to the region. In addition its Singapore business is to be reduced further to the recent news that DFS is to exit from the Changi Airport liquor & tobacco concession, as previously reported.

For its key Perfumes & Cosmetics, Jewellery & Watches and Fashion & Leathergoods divisions, LVMH detailed its success stories over the nine month period:

The perfumes & cosmetics business group recorded organic revenue growth of 8% in the first nine months of 2019, driven mainly by the momentum of its flagship brands. “Parfums Christian Dior performed well”, said LVMH, particularly with the vitality of its iconic fragrances and the new Joy and Sauvage ranges. Makeup and skincare were significant areas of growth. Guerlain made remarkable progress, driven by the Abeille Royale skincare and the Rouge G and L’Essentiel makeup lines. Parfums Givenchy saw rapid growth of its new fragrance, L’Interdit, and its makeup line. Fresh, Fenty Beauty by Rihanna and Acqua di Parma made good progress.

In the first nine months of 2019, the watches & jewellery business group recorded organic revenue growth of 4%, driven by jewellery. Bvlgari enjoyed an “excellent performance, especially in its own stores”, said LVMH. Its iconic lines Serpenti, B.Zero1, Diva and Fiorever, as well as the new Serpenti Seduttori watch collection contributed to this performance. In watches, TAG Heuer continued to focus on its iconic lines. Hublot made solid progress, continuing to enrich its lines with new models from several collaborations.

The fashion & leather goods business group achieved organic revenue growth of 18% in the first nine months of 2019. Louis Vuitton enjoyed a remarkable performance in all its businesses and in all regions. Louis Vuitton continued to strengthen its production capacity with the inauguration in September of a new workshop in France. Christian Dior also made remarkable progress. The new Champs-Elysées boutique in Paris, which combines innovative experiences with architectural virtuosity, has been very well received. Fendi unveiled several partnerships in the world of art and music. Celine launched its first haute parfumerie collection, for which a dedicated boutique will open soon in Paris. Loro Piana, Loewe and Rimowa enjoyed good progress."
"Family owned Fiat Chrysler, LVMH move on multi-billion dollar mergers - Campden FB","Thu, 31 Oct 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNhbXBkZW5mYi5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS9mYW1pbHktb3duZWQtZmlhdC1jaHJ5c2xlci1sdm1oLW1vdmUtbXVsdGktYmlsbGlvbi1kb2xsYXItbWVyZ2Vyc9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"European family business titans Fiat Chrysler and LVMH look to consolidate their dominance in their automaking and luxury goods markets in an uncertain world by eyeing multi-billion dollar mergers.

The Italian Agnelli family, which controls Fiat Chrysler through its holding company Exor, was expected to approve the proposed $48 billion union with Peugeot-owner PSA, itself 12.2% owned by the French Peugeot family.

John Elkann (pictured), 43-year-old US-born fifth-generation heir to the Agnelli dynasty, chairman of $143 billion revenue FCA, chairman and chief executive of the $159 billion revenue Exor, plus chairman of Ferrari since last year, will chair the supersized automaker. Carlos Tavares will transfer his role as chief executive of PSA to the new entity, which would be headquartered in the neutral Netherlands.

The 50/50 combination would create the world’s fourth largest carmaker, with sales of 8.7 million vehicles, revenue of $189 billion and profit of more than $12 billion. The deal ushered in a “new era” of electric vehicles, autonomous driving, sustainable mobility and digital connectivity, FCA said.

The deal rose from the ashes of the family’s attempt to merge FCA with another French marque earlier this year.

The FCA-PSA combination would ramp up its rivalry with Volkswagen, the world’s largest automaker by sales, a €236 billion ($260 billion) conglomerate of 12 brands and 660,000 employees. Controlled by the reclusive fourth-generation Porsche-Piech family, VW electrified its own EV development in the wake of its emissions scandal.

This same week, LVMH, the world's largest luxury goods company, responded to market rumours to confirm it had held unsolicited “preliminary discussions regarding a possible transaction with Tiffany.”

The Paris-based Moet Hennessy—Louis Vuitton conglomerate, owned by the Arnault family, sought to downplay the all-cash takeover offer, worth about $14.5 billion: “There can be no assurance that these discussions will result in any agreement.”

Tiffany and Co said its directors were “carefully reviewing the proposal”.

The struggling 182-year-old jeweller, considered to be the sole US luxury brand with global recognition, would consolidate LVMH’s position in North America. The acquisition would be the Arnault family’s largest in value since Christian Dior was bought out in 2017 for $13.1 billion.

Bernard Arnault (pictured), 70, chairman of LVMH, and family owns 47% of shares in LVMH. The Arnaults look likely to climb the ranks of the world’s richest people from fourth place, according to Forbes, just behind Warren Buffett at #3, Bill Gates at #2 and Jeff Bezos at #1.

The group of almost 80 brands, including Fendi, Givenchy and Dom Perignon, was voraciously collected by Arnault since 1984. It recorded a 16% increase in revenue, reaching €38.4 billion ($42.8 billion) in the first nine months of 2019. Organic revenue grew 11% compared to the same period of 2018.

The International Monetary Fund in October forecasted global growth at 3% for 2019, its lowest level since 2008-09 and a 0.3 percentage point downgrade from its April 2019 World Economic Outlook.

Growth was projected to pick up to 3.4% in 2020 (a 0.2 percentage point downward revision compared with April), based on improved economic performance in Latin America and the Middle East. However, Europe was under “macroeconomic strain” and a “slowdown” was projected in China and the United States due in part to trade tensions.

More than half (55%) of families surveyed by Campden Wealth for The Global Family Office Report 2019 said they believed an economic downturn would be experienced by 2020. In preparation for an expected recession, 45% said they were realigning their investment strategies to mitigate risk. Up to 42% were increasing their cash reserves while another 42% were preparing to capitalise on “opportunistic events”."
LVMH Invests in Streetwear Label Madhappy - Sourcing Journal,"Tue, 15 Oct 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vc291cmNpbmdqb3VybmFsLmNvbS9kZW5pbS9kZW5pbS1icmFuZHMvbHZtaC1pbnZlc3RzLW1hZGhhcHB5LWx1eHVyeS1zdHJlZXR3ZWFyLTE3NDYxMy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Streetwear label Madhappy has caught the attention of one of the world’s largest luxury conglomerates.

On Thursday, Los Angeles-based Madhappy announced a $1.5 million seed round of funding in which Louis Vuitton Moet Hennessy (LVMH) was the lead investor. Other contributors include Tommy Hilfiger and the founders of Sweetgreen.

LVMH, which owns some of the world’s best-known luxury brands, made waves in 2018 when it launched an accelerator program to support innovations in fashion. Now, it’s investing in Madhappy, a startup that it considers especially promising.

What makes this streetwear company stand out from the rest—and what inspired investors to contribute big money—is its mission. Madhappy launched in 2017 as a way to promote mental health awareness and create a line that boasts inclusivity. Celebrities such as Gigi Hadid, Steph Curry, Katy Perry and Cardi B have been spotted in the brand’s streetwear staples, which feature bold colors and uplifting messages.

“Growing up, we found that many streetwear labels seemed to be very exclusive, and we wanted to create a brand that was the opposite of that,” Madhappy’s co-founder Peiman Raf told Fast Company. “But we want to take it a step further and start conversations about mental health. Many of our events are focused on talking about mental health issues that most people don’t often talk about publicly.”

Madhappy maintains retail spaces in Los Angeles and New York City. The brand offers streetwear basics at a higher price point. Hoodies retail for $160, sweatpants for $140 and T-shirts for $70. And the brand equally appeals to both men and women, which is uncommon for streetwear brands, as they typically skew male.

This signals a bigger shift in the luxury and streetwear industries, which have been getting a makeover since the likes of Virgil Abloh and collaborations between Supreme and Louis Vuitton emerged on the scene."
"Kering CEO François-Henri Pinault Ousts LVMH's Bernard Arnault from Number 3 Spot on Harvard's ""Best CEOs"" List - The Fashion Law","Tue, 22 Oct 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiQFodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGVmYXNoaW9ubGF3LmNvbS9rZXJpbmctY2VvLWZyYW5vaXMtaGVucmktcGluYXVsdC1vdXN0cy1sdm1ocy1iZXJuYXJkLWFybmF1bHQtZnJvbS1udW1iZXItMy1zcG90LW9uLWhhcnZhcmRzLWJlc3QtY2Vvcy1saXN0L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"An enduring battle between two of the biggest luxury goods conglomerates has extended beyond acquisitions and handbag sales, and is under way in the upper echelon of Harvard Business Review (“HBR”)’s annual “Best-Performing CEOs in the World” list. The highest-ranking fashion industry figure for 2019, Kering’s François-Henri Pinault has landed in the number 3 spot (following Nvidia’s chief executive Jensen Huang and Salesforce’s Marc Benioff), and in doing so, has ousted rival conglomerate LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton’s chairman and CEO Bernard Arnault from the spot he held on last year’s list.

In its annual ranking of chief executive officers, HBR focuses on gains that companies make over the long-term, “relying on objective performance measures over a chief executive’s entire tenure.” As such, HBR’s key financial metrics include: the company’s total shareholder return (adjusted for country and industry performance), industry-adjusted total shareholder return, and its market capitalization.

In addition to considering financial success (and assigning a value based on that from 1 (best) to 881 (worst), since HBR reviewed the metrics for 881 different CEOs), since 2015, HBR’s ranking has included Environmental, Social and Corporate Governance (“ESG”) considerations, i.e., a set of standards for a company’s operations that socially conscious investors use to screen investments, criteria tends to include how a company performs as a steward of the natural environment; how it manages relationships with its employees, suppliers, customers and the communities where it operates; and how it approaches leadership, executive pay, audits and internal controls, and shareholder rights.

To come up with the ranking, HBR combines the overall financial ranking (weighted at 80 percent) and the two ESG rankings (weighted at 10 percent each) to obtain an overall financial rank.

With that in mind, a handful of fashion industry figures appear in the 2019 ranking, with François-Henri Pinault, the CEO and Chairman of Kering, the luxury goods conglomerate that owns brands, such as Gucci, Saint Laurent, Balenciaga, Bottega Veneta, and Alexander McQueen, taking the highest position of all fashion CEOs. According to HBR’s calculations, Pinault and his company Kering have a financial ranking of 30 and ESG scores of 137 and 118 from the two separate companies, CSRHub and Sustainalytics, that HBR gets ESG data from.

Comparatively, LVMH’s Arnault – whose conglomerate owns over 70 fashion and non-fashion brands, such as Louis Vuitton, Givenchy, Dior, and Celine – dropped from the number 3 spot on last year’s list to number 10 this year, although its financial ranking – 7 – was higher than Pinault/Kering’s. As for ESG, it trailed behind Kering with scores of 337 and 154.

Arnault’s 2018 ranking included a financial score of 7 (the same as this year), and ESG scores of 226 and 186, while last year, in his number 4 spot, Pinault’s financial score was 35, with ESG scores 65 and 133.

As for some of the fashion, apparel, and/or cosmetic brand CEOs on the list …

19. L’Oreal’s Jean-Paul Agon, who has a financial rank of 142, and ESG rankings of – notably – 129 and 1;

20. Nike’s Mark Parker, who has a financial rank of 22, and ESG rankings of 522 and 183;

39. Estée Lauder’s Fabrizio Freda, who has a financial rank of 26, and ESG rankings of 585 and 271;

49. Gildan Activewear’s Glenn Chamandy, who has a financial rank of 174, and ESG rankings of 182 and 84;

52. Shiseido’s Masahiko Uotani, who has a financial rank of 104, and ESG rankings of 330 and 303; and

54. Uniqlo’s parent company Fast Retailing’s Tadashi Yanai, who has a high financial rank of 7, and low ESG rankings of 486 and 625."
"Donald Trump, Louis Vuitton, and the Fashion Scandal That Wasn't - The Daily Beast","Tue, 22 Oct 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWRhaWx5YmVhc3QuY29tL2RvbmFsZC10cnVtcC1sb3Vpcy12dWl0dG9uLWFuZC10aGUtZmFzaGlvbi1zY2FuZGFsLXRoYXQtd2FzbnTSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"If you like your fashion scandals with a side of pyrotechnics—see: Dolce & Gabbana fans setting fire to their designer merchandise, or tweens taking matches to James Charles eye shadow palettes—you will be sorely disappointed by the LVMH non-troversy of last week.

After LVMH CEO and chairman Bernard Arnault accompanied Donald Trump to a ribbon-cutting ceremony at the new Louis Vuitton factory in Johnson County, Texas, there would be no mass burning of logo’d satchels or luggage. Those who do not work in the brand, were the loudest in their disapproval; the actress Debra Messing, a noted nemesis of the president, tweeted against the photo op, as did celebrity stylists Karla Welch, Elizabeth Stewart, Alexandra Mandelkorn, and makeup artist Rachel Goodman.

Shannon Coulter, founder of the #GrabYourWallet Alliance, which tracks companies profiting from the administration's policies, called for a boycott of LVMH. After The New York Times fashion critic Vanessa Friedman reported on the snafu, a few shoppers replied to her tweet promising to throw their Vuitton wallets away or return their newly-purchased handbags.

But despite the chatter, other big names who work under the LVMH name, like Fenty’s Rihanna, Givenchy’s Clare Waight Keller, Fendi’s Silvia Fendi, Marc Jacobs (the man), Dior’s Maria Grazia Chirui, and Kenzo’s Felipe Oliveira Baptista, stayed silent. Those creative directors did not respond to inquiries from The Daily Beast.

Only one designer went rogue—Nicolas Ghesquière, artistic director for womenswear at Vuitton. He punctuated his weekend by posting a screenshot of the album cover for Evelyn Thomas’ 1984 synth classic High Energy. Ghesquiere captioned the photo, “Standing against any political action. I am a fashion designer refusing this association #trumpisajoke #homophobia.”

A representative for Ghesquière declined The Daily Beast’s interview request. Friedman called Ghesquière’s post “a pretty radical move” and labeled him the potential “poster boy for fashion-against-Trump.”

Maybe. It’s admirable that Ghesquière would speak out while most of his peers stay silent. Most people understand the schism between corporate higher-ups and creatives. Ghesquière didn’t have to say anything, but by doing so he’s leading the dissent—if taking a photo of the Spotify song one is listening to and hitting “post” on Instagram can be considered a protest.

With no angry, wealthy mobs throwing a match and gasoline into a trash can full of shoulder bags, Ghesquière’s statement may very well be it. As Robin Givhan of The Washington Post wrote, LVMH seems to accept Trump with a “public shrug.”

“The ribbon-cutting was jarring in its utter nonchalance, in its unflinching fealty to corporate normalcy during these most abnormal times,” Givhan wrote. “Can there be neutral ground when the players are a president who has made women in general, along with immigrants and members of the LGBT community, feel as though they are under siege, and a billionaire mogul who reaps tremendous profits from those very people?”

But yet, as those who dismiss fashion as frivolous are always quick to point out these days, there are more pressing reasons to call out Trump. Impeachment could be near, his administration is in shambles, and more than 10,000 Kurds have died trying to fight the Islamic State.

Do we really need to talk about purses at a time like this? Especially if those pricey bags will now come with “Made in the USA” tags, giving jobs to a reported 150 Texans, according to the Dallas Morning News? (As part of singing the Trump administration’s “Pledge to American Workers,” LVMH promised to open 1,000 more positions over the next five years.)

“ Louis Vuitton is a 150 year-old brand that is so coveted and desired, so expensive, that people probably choose to forgive and forget ”

Another important question: Do those who can afford the leather goods, which retail from $740 for a monogrammed wallet to $2,900 for a “lightweight and feminine” backpack, care at all about who christened the workshop that made it?

“Consumers choose to forget or turn a deaf ear because they don’t want their brand spoken about in a negative light, and they want to own their products without any kind of baggage,” Laurence Newell, managing director of the Americas for consultancy company Brand Finance told The Daily Beast. “Louis Vuitton is a 150-year-old brand that is so coveted and desired, so expensive, that people probably choose to forgive and forget.”

The fashion establishment has a spotty history when it comes time to stand up to its rich, but perhaps ethically compromised, benefactors. Just this summer, The Washington Post revealed that billionaire real estate developer Stephen Ross and his wife Kara would host two events in the Hamptons that raised $12 million for Trump’s reelection campaign.

At the time, Kara sat on the board of the Council of Fashion Designers of America. Though some in the industry called for Kara’s ousting, chairman Tom Ford told WWD those requests were “totally wrong.”

“To have done that would have been the same kind of censorship that our current administration tries to do with the press—tries to manipulate, in a sense, real freedom of speech,” Ford said.

Any debates over the validity of this argument were rendered mute when Ross exited the board in September to make room for new and more diverse members. As reported by The Daily Beast, Stephen Ross’ seat on the board of arts venue The Shed led to criticism from New York City Council Speaker Corey Johnson. None of the New York Fashion Week shows expected to be held at the Shed took place.

Is it all that surprising that Trump, a notorious showboat who joked at the ribbon cutting that shopping Vuitton “cost me a lot of money over the years,” would be a fan of the brand? With its manic, repeated logo and penchant for slapping huge shiny buckles over cowhide, LV has worked hard to align itself with the ostentatious.

To quote one astute Twitter user, “No authentically fashionable person carries LV. And I felt that way *before* the Trump pic.”"
"Louis Vuitton Has a Factory in Texas Now, Marking its Third in the U.S. - The Fashion Law","Fri, 18 Oct 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWZhc2hpb25sYXcuY29tL2xvdWlzLXZ1aXR0b24tb3BlbnMtdXAtc2hvcC1pbi10ZXhhcy1tYXJraW5nLWl0cy10aGlyZC1tYW51ZmFjdHVyaW5nLW91dHBvc3QtaW4tdGhlLXVzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Louis Vuitton officially opened a 100,000-square-foot factory in rural Texas this week, adding yet another non-French outpost to its manufacturing fleet. The goal of the Paris-based brand’s newest factory is straightforward: in its own words, the new manufacturing hub will help Louis Vuitton “to meet the ever-growing demand for Louis Vuitton products in America.” As the Wall Street Journal put it, the new factory is part of Louis Vuitton’s larger strategy of “selling luxury goods to the masses without lowering prices.”

Hardly an unheard of move, the Johnson County, Texas factory is Louis Vuitton’s third in the United States to date. Two outposts in San Dimas and Irwin, California have enabled Louis Vuitton to make “approximately half the bags” it has sold in the U.S. over the past 30 years on domestic soil, the New York Times’ Vanessa Friedman reported on Friday.

While not unchartered territory, the opening of the Texas factory comes at an interesting time, nonetheless. The largest luxury brand in the world, Louis Vuitton earns the vast majority of its income from its leather goods offerings, and given that the U.S. is the largest luxury market in the world (at least for now), Louis Vuitton’s latest American endeavor gives it the ability to “hedge against the risk of trade disputes between the U.S. and European Union” under the watch of President Donald Trump.

More than that, as demand for Louis Vuitton’s leather goods continues to increase – growth for its Fashion & Leather Goods division was up 19 percent for the most recent quarter, thereby, remaining the group’s fastest-growing segment – the brand’s strategy depends on its ability to “streamline manufacturing and build an agile supply chain,” according to the Wall Street Journal, which is why it has been busy building factories both in its native France and internationally.

Last year, Louis Vuitton announced that the addition of two French factories – aimed at helping it “to meet the growing demand for its leather goods” – would enable it to cut production time on internal orders in half. “The expansion will enable store managers to react to sales trends and deliver handbags within a week of internal orders coming in. The current production time is two weeks,” Vogue reported at the time.

Just like their California-made cousins, the new bags coming out of Texas will be stamped with “Made in the USA” tags. However, there will be some differences in play. “Unlike Louis Vuitton products from France,” the WSJ stated in a lengthy article on Thursday, “the Texas bags won’t be produced by ‘petites mains,’ the French artisans at the center of the brand’s history and mystique.” Instead, Louis Vuitton has been busy “recruiting and training employees locally,” with hourly pay starting at $13. It currently employs 150 people, and plans to boost that number to 500 after it opens another factory on the same property, further bolstering its ability to churn out bags and other leather goods.

Despite the benefits that come with its new Texas outfit, it has not been smooth sailing since Louis Vuitton first set up a temporary factories in Texas in 2017. In fact, given that claims of “sweatshop” conditions and at least one the Texas Workplace Commission complaint are in the mix, it is safe to say that Louis Vuitton’s Texan endeavor has gotten off to a rough start.

Early hires told the WSJ’s Matthew Dalton that they “worked through sweltering heat without air conditioning, surrounded by a chain-link fence.” One former employee “filed a complaint with the Texas Workplace Commission alleging the lack of air conditioning and other working conditions were a form of discrimination against the Hispanic and female workforce.”

Louis Vuitton refused to comment on the working conditions or the pending complaint, but did reveal that it appointed Sébastien Bernard-Granger to “oversee manufacturing in Texas and ensure the facilities, including the new plant, met French standards,” and according to “some of the former employees, working conditions improved [after] the brand moved into the permanent plant.”

Bloomberg’s Robert Williams reported on Thursday that the factory opening is a demonstration of LCMH “following through on a pledge to create more U.S. manufacturing jobs, part of plan by Bernard Arnault, chairman of the French luxury conglomerate, to hedge against trade tensions and build on the rapport he’s established with President Donald Trump.”

The President and his daughter Ivanka took part in a ribbon-cutting ceremony, alongside Arnault, his son Alexandre (who is the co-CEO of LVMH-owned luggage brand Rimowa), and Louis Vuitton CEO Michael Burke, in Johnson County, Texas on Thursday. The enduring ties between Trump and Arnault are curious, leaving “businesspeople picking their way through a minefield of moral questions,” according to Washington Post’s fashion critic Robin Givhan.

In a conversation with reporters on Thursday, Arnault made his view on the matter clear: “I am not here to judge his types of policies,” he said, speaking of Trump. “I have no political role. I am a business person. I try to tell him what I think for the success of the economy of the country, and the success of what we are doing.”

In short: for LVMH – which is trudging ahead and abroad and “increasingly letting industrial logic and geopolitics govern supply-chain decisions,” per Dalton, while competitors, “such as Gucci, Hermès and Chanel have kept most [of their] production in Italy and France” – this is just business. And considering that LVMH’s Fashion & Leather Goods division, alone, brought in $15.8 billion in sales in the first 9 months of the year– with the group as a whole reporting revenues of $42.14 billion for the same period, it is big business.

But as Givhan dared (in spite of Louis Vuitton’s sheer power as an advertising giant) to ponder aloud: can there really be “neutral ground when the players are a president who has made women in general, along with immigrants and members of the LGBTQ community, feel as though they are under siege, and a billionaire mogul who reaps tremendous profits from those very people?”"

But since June, a workshop on a ranch there has been busy making six styles of bags and backpacks for the world’s biggest luxury brand.

Why Texas? Money, of course.

Louis Vuitton is the largest brand of LVMH, the luxury conglomerate, and the US one of its most lucrative markets. Despite an overall decline in US spending on handbags, LVMH’s US sales have continued to grow. In a statement, the company said the new facility is opening to “meet the ever-growing demand for Louis Vuitton products in the American market.”

In 2018, LVMH did about $12.5 billion in sales (pdf) in the US. Technically Asia brought in more, but that was across all of Asia, excluding Japan. “The US market is number one for LVMH in the world,” Bernard Arnault, CEO and chairman of LVMH, Louis Vuitton’s parent company, said at a ribbon-cutting ceremony yesterday (Oct. 17), according to a local NBC affiliate. Joining him was US president Donald Trump. They spoke and took pictures with the workshop’s employees against a backdrop that included the flags of France, the US, and Texas.

Local manufacturing has long been a key part of its business. The company already runs two manufacturing workshops in California. Over the past 30 years, the New York Times notes, about half the bags Louis Vuitton has sold in the US were made in the US.

Being able to produce more bags within US borders offers some important advantages. One, Louis Vuitton can avoid import duties on its products, including any new tariffs Trump may impose as his trade spats escalate. (So far those haven’t been a major issue for Louis Vuitton.)

Perhaps more importantly, it allows the company to respond quickly to demand. Louis Vuitton has been bolstering its supply chain, improving its speed and data-crunching ability as it works to keep up with rising sales globally. The faster it gets, the fewer products it has to produce in advance, cutting down waste and costs. “We used to forecast—now we react,” Louis Vuitton CEO Michael Burke told Bloomberg last month.

Rather than ship products from Europe to stores in US cities, it can do it much more quickly and cheaply from Texas and California. The company told the New York Times it chose Texas for its central location, giving it easy access to the coasts, as well as its history as a leatherworking center. Johnson County gave it a 10-year, 75% tax abatement worth about $91,900 a year, though it said that wasn’t central to its decision to open the new facility.

Louis Vuitton says the workshop will ultimately create about 1,000 jobs for the area. At the ribbon-cutting, Trump praised the company for its $50-million investment in Texas. ”Today, we continue the extraordinary revival of American manufacturing, and we proudly celebrate the opening of the brand-new Louis Vuitton—a name I know very well,” he said. “It cost me a lot of money over the years.”"
Tiffany takeover approach is all about chasing Chinese money - The Guardian,"Mon, 28 Oct 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy8yMDE5L29jdC8yOC9iaWxsaW9uYWlyZXMtZmlnaHQtbHV4dXJ5LWdvb2RzLWJyYW5kcy10aWZmYW55LWNoaW5lc2UtZGVtYW5k0gFuaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAudGhlZ3VhcmRpYW4uY29tL2J1c2luZXNzLzIwMTkvb2N0LzI4L2JpbGxpb25haXJlcy1maWdodC1sdXh1cnktZ29vZHMtYnJhbmRzLXRpZmZhbnktY2hpbmVzZS1kZW1hbmQ?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Two of Europe’s wealthiest families, and one from South Africa, are fighting it out for control of the world’s most-sought after luxury goods brands, and with them, for the pounds, euros, dollars and yuan the richest 1% are spending on trying to make themselves look good.

The attempt by France’s richest person, Bernard Arnault, to snap up the US jeweller Tiffany for $14.5bn (£11bn) via his LVMH group is the latest in a wave of consolidations in the luxury goods industry that is tilting towards the “Fuerdai” – a new generation of wealthy Chinese consumers.

The luxury goods sector is worth about £795bn, according to experts at Boston Consulting Group (BCG), who expect it to grow at 4%-5% a year until at least 2025. Wealthy people in China, whose numbers recently eclipsed those in the US for the first time, are described as the driving force in the sector, accounting for a third of all spending. By 2025, that figure is expected to rise to 40%.

Tiffany, which was founded by the jeweller Charles Lewis Tiffany in 1837, has already noted the rise in Chinese spending as its US customers rein theirs in. Earlier this month, Tiffany’s chief executive, Alessandro Bogliolo, said the company had moved some of its most expensive pieces, including diamond necklaces valued at more than $1m, to mainland China. “We follow our customers where they shop,” he said.

A lower Chinese domestic sales tax introduced by the government to “repatriate consumption” by its citizens has led to a double-digit decrease in sales to Chinese tourists in Tiffany’s US stores.

Buying Tiffany would be LVMH’s biggest acquisition to date and bring the 182-year-old jeweller into a growing stable of luxury brands including Moët & Chandon, Marc Jacobs, Celine, Givenchy and Dom Pérignon.

Arnault, LVMH’s chairman and chief executive, and the world’s third-richest person with an estimated $97bn fortune, according to the Bloomberg billionaires index, has been rapidly expanding the group he has run for the past four decades. In past year, LVMH has also bought the Italian jeweller Repossi, and the Orient Express rail service as part of a $3.2bn high-end hotels deal.

His billionaire rivals are also on acquisition sprees, looking for brands that appeal to Chinese high rollers. Richemont, a luxury goods house founded by the South African billionaire Johann Rupert, recently bought the Italian jewellery house Buccellati from the Chinese investment group Gangtai.

Meanwhile, Kering, the luxury French fashion house run by the billionaire François Pinault and his family, who have a 40% stake, is also looking to buy up established brands to add to its portfolio, which includes Gucci, Balenciaga and Alexander McQueen.

Jean-Marc Duplaix, Kering’s chief financial officer, said Chinese spending had helped the company to a “remarkable” 2018, with sales up 29% to €13.7bn (£11.8bn). “The fourth quarter remained extremely dynamic with Chinese customers,” he said."
Why Trump Helped Open a Louis Vuitton Workshop in Rural Texas - Business Insider,"Fri, 18 Oct 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vdHJ1bXAtb3BlbmVkLWxvdWlzLXZ1aXR0b24td29ya3Nob3AtcnVyYWwtdGV4YXMtd2h5LTIwMTktMTDSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"President Donald Trump appeared alongside one of his allies in the luxury world to help open a Louis Vuitton (LV) workshop in rural Texas.

The opening marked the first luxury brand to seemingly align itself with the controversial president, though LV leaders at the appearance wouldn't claim any formal association with Trump.

Bernard Arnault, the CEO of Louis Vuitton's parent company LVMH, is a French billionaire who is the third richest person in the world and has had business interests wrapped up with Trump's presidency before.

Though the legendary French company has workshops in California, Trump has touted the Texas site opening as a milestone for boosting American industry.

The workshop could also help shield Louis Vuitton from future trade battles between the US and the European Union, making the rollout a win-win for the company and the Trump administration.

President Donald Trump's attendance at the opening of a Louis Vuitton workshop in rural Texas may seem like a fairly random agenda item, but the move placed Trump alongside one of his longtime major allies from the fashion world.

The appearance with LVMH CEO Bernard Arnault came 40 miles south of Fort Worth in Alvarado, Texas to open the luxury brand's Rochambeau Ranch production facility. Previously, Arnault was a guest at Trump's first state dinner and one of the first CEOs to meet with Trump after his 2017 inauguration.

The name of the ranch seemed particularly significant for the brand and its new neighbors as the site was named after the French general who aided the colonies in the American Revolution in melding French and American culture.

""This workshop will soon employ 500 of the most highly skilled workers anywhere in the world,"" Trump said. ""No one can match the precision and perfection of an American artisan.""

Arnault told reporters he was honored to have the president in attendance but stopped short of calling him a friend, saying only that they had known each other since the 1980s, when the two met in New York around the time when Arnault founded LVMH, or Louis Vuitton Moet-Hennessy, which has grown to include 75 luxury, fashion, and beauty brands including Christian Dior, Givenchy, Dom Pérignon, and Sephora.

The billionaire is currently the third-richest person in the world and has caused controversy when he met with Trump shortly after the 2016 election, much to the chagrin of American designers like Marc Jacobs, Tom Ford, and Philip Lim who vowed they wouldn't dress first lady Melania Trump. The first lady has since worn custom designs from the French house and is seen traveling with multiple pieces of the brand's luggage.

Reports of the meeting pointed to Arnault's possible concerns about the Louis Vuitton flagship, which is situated in Manhattan at Fifth Avenue and 57th Street, just blocks away from Trump Tower and in the midst of heavy security barricades and checkpoints to protect the president-elect, which some retailers say cut business by around 30%.

At the time of the 2016 meeting, Trump praised Arnault, who said he was planning an American expansion of Louis Vuitton, and said he would be involved in ""wonderful things in this country, great things,"" including ""jobs, a lot of jobs.""

Brands associating with Trump have proven divisive, but the economic implications could mean a win-win move

The luxury brand could be the next business to experiment with loose associations with Trump. Since his emergence as a Republican presidential frontrunner, multiple brands have taken hits for connections to the controversial figure, like New Balance sparking controversy in 2016 for apparently celebrating the Trump-championed demise of the Trans-Pacific Partnership and the calls for boycotts of Equinox and Soul Cycle memberships after the owner of their parent company hosted a Trump fundraiser in the Hamptons.

The opening already sparked controversy despite Trump's popularity in Johnson County, where NPR reports 77.5% of voters backed him in 2016. Residents protested the workshop by appearing at public meetings to speak out about concerns of low wages for local workers and generous tax breaks for the luxury brand.

However, the Louis Vuitton workshop is a key part of Trump's Pledge to America's Workers, and his generally touted initiative to boost US industry. The leather will be processed in a different facility and won't be made from Texan cattle, but bags will still carry ""Made in the USA"" labels after leaving the $50-million facility and will create 1,000 jobs."

And yes, it was odd. - The Washington Post","Fri, 18 Oct 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndhc2hpbmd0b25wb3N0LmNvbS9saWZlc3R5bGUvMjAxOS8xMC8xOC9sb3Vpcy12dWl0dG9uLXdlbGNvbWVkLXRydW1wLW9wZW5pbmctaXRzLW5ldy1mYWN0b3J5LXllcy1pdC13YXMtb2RkL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The president is radioactive. Entering his orbit means stepping into the white-hot heat of a brutal sun or into a deadly nuclear meltdown. Wherever he travels, Donald Trump is at the center of a volatile cloud of unknowable proportions. Thursday afternoon, French businessman Bernard Arnault stepped into that cloud. Arnault, the chairman of LVMH, was in Johnson County, Tex., for the formal opening of his company’s Louis Vuitton Rochambeau Ranch, a new production facility for the luxury fashion house that is expected to generate 1,000 jobs over five years. The factory currently employs about 150 people and enjoys a 10-year property tax abatement, according to the Dallas Morning News.

The factory at the Rochambeau Ranch, once called the Rockin’ Z Ranch but renamed after Marshal Jean-Baptiste Donatien de Vimeur, comte de Rochambeau — the French nobleman and general who helped the 13 Colonies win their independence — is set on a hilly, 260-acre site. There, workers in nifty khaki work smocks will breathe in the Louis Vuitton mythology as they learn to assemble the brand’s signature handbags and backpacks. Those bags will all be labeled Made in the USA.

This isn’t the first Louis Vuitton factory in the United States, but this one was aligned with the Trump administration’s Pledge to America’s Workers — a fuzzy-math political initiative aimed at showcasing how much the federal government is doing to improve job opportunities for the average worker. So, after a fundraising luncheon in Fort Worth and before a campaign rally in Dallas, the president attended the factory’s ribbon-cutting, along with his daughter Ivanka, who is a presidential adviser and co-chair of the National Council for the American Worker. He also brought along the U.S. ambassador to France, son-in-law Jared Kushner, former Texas governor and outgoing Energy Secretary Rick Perry, Labor secretary Gene Scalia and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, which is quite a crowd for a factory that isn’t boasting any new technology and has a workforce smaller than some neighborhood supermarkets.

The presidential entourage toured the airy factory, and Trump received a tutorial from one of the workers on the wonders of Louis Vuitton bags. There was a lot of smiling and joking — at least from the president, who made several references to “Bernard’s” business savvy and called him “an artist and a visionary.”

The late afternoon grip-and-grin was a tightly choreographed double back slap at the highest corporate level. It was business as usual … which is what made it such a curious occurrence.

The ribbon-cutting was jarring in its utter nonchalance, in its unflinching fealty to corporate normalcy during these most abnormal times. Can there be neutral ground when the players are a president who has made women in general, along with immigrants and members of the LGBTQ community, feel as though they are under siege, and a billionaire mogul who reaps tremendous profits from those very people?

Is a public shrug permissible anymore when all around there is chaos?

Louis Vuitton is one of the crown jewels of the Paris-based LVMH, which is the world’s largest luxury conglomerate and includes such iconic brands as Dior, Givenchy and Marc Jacobs, as well as Fenty Beauty and Fenty, which are in collaboration with the entertainer Rihanna. Arnault is worth nearly $100 billion. In 2017, he was one in a steady stream of visitors who met with the then-president-elect in his office in New York’s Trump Tower. These visits, for whatever substance they entailed, were supremely performative as the powerful and the power-hungry lobbed hollow compliments at Trump in front of the pool of journalists that assembled daily in the high-rise’s lobby. Arnault dutifully complied with the ritual, smiling and shaking hands with Trump in front of the whirring cameras and gamely briefing reporters on his interest in expanding Louis Vuitton manufacturing facilities in the United States. (LVMH has 33,000 employees in the country, which makes for an annual investment of more than $1 billion, according to Arnault.)

Normalcy seemed possible.

Since that meeting, Trump has revealed himself to be, at various turns, racist, petty, vulgar and dishonest. And now he is the subject of an impeachment inquiry. Nothing about his administration has been in keeping with tradition. Every ceremonial gesture comes with an asterisk. The most anodyne events are freighted with the possibility of, well, anything.

Members of the fashion community, including those within the LVMH family, have made their displeasure with the administration plain. Early on, Jacobs said he had no interest in dressing first lady Melania Trump. Dior creative director Maria Grazia Chiuri has imbued her collections with feminist ideology that runs counter to Trump’s degrading commentary about women. And Rihanna has used social media to lambaste the president on the subject of gun violence.

Alarm bells are all around Arnault. Businesspeople are picking their way through a minefield of moral questions. When the real estate mogul Stephen Ross hosted an August fundraiser in his Hamptons home for Trump’s reelection, the backlash against fitness companies in his portfolio such as Equinox and SoulCycle was swift, with workout fanatics canceling memberships and threatening boycotts. Both companies quickly issued statements disavowing any support of the fundraiser. In 2017, when Trump equated those who were protesting racism with the white nationalists marching in Charlottesville, the president’s business councils disbanded in protest. Apple CEO Tim Cook was among the business leaders who spoke out against the administration’s immigration policies. And, of course, there are business folks who support the president’s agenda.

The Louis Vuitton ribbon-cutting wasn’t a fundraiser, but it was a vivid backdrop for Trump’s reelection chest-beating. His walk-on music included his campaign favorites: “God Bless the USA” and “You Can’t Always Get What You Want.” The factory is situated in a state on the front lines of the immigration crisis. The afternoon was in celebration of a factory that will manufacture products aimed at women, and its workers — neatly lined up like a tableau vivant behind the president — were a diverse lot. What did Arnault make of these contradictions and misdirections?

The businessman noted “the commitment of President Trump to the American workers.”

And then he shrugged."

At present, Louis Vuitton operates 24 workshops worldwide, most of which are in Europe. Two facilities are located stateside, in California. LVMH plans to create 1,000 jobs at the Texas workshop over the next five years.

The job creation is part of Trump’s Pledge to America’s Workers initiative, which is aimed at expanding education and training opportunities for American students and employees. Over 350 companies have signed onto the initiative, with 14,000,000-plus opportunities pledged over the next five years.

Throughout Trump’s candidacy and presidency, he has emphasized the importance of job creation — speaking of his intent to bring positions back to the states from overseas. In 2019, the manufacturing sector is adding an average of 5,000 jobs per month, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, down from an average of 22,000 jobs added monthly in 2018. The U.S. unemployment rate has hit its lowest number since 1969, dropping to just 3.5%.

LVMH reports double-digit surge in nine-month revenues; DFS posts growth despite Hong Kong slowdown - The Moodie Davitt Report,"Wed, 09 Oct 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiggFodHRwczovL21vb2RpZWRhdml0dHJlcG9ydC5jb20vbHZtaC1yZXBvcnRzLWRvdWJsZS1kaWdpdC1zdXJnZS1pbi1uaW5lLW1vbnRoLXJldmVudWVzLWRmcy1wb3N0cy1ncm93dGgtZGVzcGl0ZS1ob25nLWtvbmctc2xvd2Rvd24v0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"INTERNATIONAL. LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton recorded a +16% increase in revenue to €38.4 billion in the first nine months of 2019. Organic revenue grew +11% compared to the same period in 2018.

The Selective Retailing business group achieved organic revenue growth of +6% (+11% reported) in the period, despite a sharp downturn in the Hong Kong market for DFS.

LVMH said: “At DFS, the Venice Galleria is enjoying good momentum, benefiting in particular from strong demand from international travellers. DFS continued to grow over the first nine months of the year despite the slowdown in Hong Kong.”

As we reported recently, the DFS business has been hit hard in Hong Kong, traditionally a highly significant share of the company’s profitability. As reported in our 17 September eZine, DFS’s business there was down by well over -50% in August due to the impact of the Hong Kong protests on tourism.

DFS Group also recently announced big cuts to its workforces in Hawaii and Singapore, driven principally by an Asian tourism slump in Hawaii and the impending exit from the Changi Airport liquor & tobacco concession.

In the same Selective Retailing division, Sephora recorded steady growth in revenue and gained market share while online sales continued to grow, said LVMH.

In the third quarter, LVMH revenue was up +17% compared to the same period in 2018. Organic revenue growth was +11%, a performance in line with the trend recorded in the first half of the year. The USA and Europe saw good progress in the third quarter, as did Asia, said LVMH, despite the difficult Hong Kong business.

The Wines & Spirits business group recorded organic revenue growth of +7% (+10% reported) in the first nine months. Growth was strong in China as well as in the USA due to steady demand. Champagne volumes were down slightly over the period. Prestige vintages experienced strong growth while continuing a price increase policy throughout the range. Hennessy Cognac volumes increased by +10%, driven by the VS ranges.

The Fashion & Leather Goods business group achieved organic revenue growth of +18% (+22% reported) in the period. Louis Vuitton enjoyed “a remarkable performance in all its businesses and in all regions,” said LVMH. Highlights included the opening of a new workshop in France and the creation of a “Louis Vuitton X” exhibition in Los Angeles, which traces the history of the Maison.

Christian Dior also made progress, including through a new Champs-Elysées boutique in Paris. Fendi unveiled several partnerships in the world of art and music. Celine launched its first haute parfumerie collection, for which a dedicated boutique will open soon in Paris. Loro Piana, Loewe and Rimowa delivered good progress. The other Maisons continued to strengthen, noted LVMH.

The Perfumes & Cosmetics business group recorded organic revenue growth of +8% (reported +11%) in the first nine months, driven mainly by the momentum of its flagship brands. Parfums Christian Dior performed well, particularly with the vitality of its main fragrance lines. Makeup and skincare were significant areas of growth. Guerlain made “remarkable progress, driven by the Abeille Royale skincare and the Rouge G and L’Essentiel makeup lines”. Parfums Givenchy saw rapid growth of its new fragrance, L’Interdit, and its makeup line. Fresh, Fenty Beauty by Rihanna and Acqua di Parma made good progress, said the group.

The Watches & Jewelry business group recorded organic revenue growth of +4% (+8% reported), driven by jewellery. Bvlgari lines Serpenti, B.Zero1, Diva and Fiorever, as well as the new Serpenti Seduttori watch collection contributed to this performance. After Beijing in 2017 and Tokyo in 2018, this summer, Chaumet presented its new exhibition in Monaco called Chaumet in Majesty.

Commenting on the wider market, LVMH said in a statement: “In a growth environment since the beginning of the year, albeit marked by an uncertain geopolitical context, LVMH will continue to be vigilant. The group will pursue its strategy focused on innovation and targeted geographic expansion in the most promising markets.”"

Model Alliance Brings Respect Program to Paris to Protect Models - WWD,"Fri, 18 Oct 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3dkLmNvbS9mZWF0dXJlL21vZGVsLWFsbGlhbmNlLXJlc3BlY3QtcHJvZ3JhbS1sdm1oLWtlcmluZy1leGVjdXRpdmVzLTEyMDMzNDkxNDkv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The Model Alliance founder and executive director Sara Ziff on Friday met in Paris with the French Minister of Gender Equality Marlene Schiappa and representatives from LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, Kering, Chanel and other brands to discuss fashion’s human trafficking problem. To offer a firsthand account, Airica Kraehmer traveled with Ziff to tell her experience, during the multibrand meeting, which was held to mark European Anti-Trafficking Day, according to information provided by the Model Alliance. As a potential solution, the alliance presented its “Respect” program as a way to prevent trafficking and abuse of models and others who help market French fashion’s most powerful brands.

Introduced in May 2018, the program calls for brands, modeling agencies and media outlets to sign a legally binding agreement to protect models. Their aim was to create an environment of mutual respect and to stop sexual harassment in the industry. In the past several years, numerous male photographers have come under fire for allegedly mistreating or abusing models. Mario Testino, Bruce Weber, Patrick Demarchelier and Terry Richardson are among those who have been accused of misconduct, largely via media exposés — although some have denied the allegations. Karen Elson, Doutzen Kroes, Teddy Quinlivan, Bryce Thompson and Jason Fedele were among the 100 well-known models that helped to launch the program.

The focus on European fashion houses follows more than a year of trying to get American brands to commit to the program. A Model Alliance spokeswoman said Friday the group “is in negotiations with several companies.” She declined to pinpoint how many have committed thus far.

By the alliance’s assessment, the Models’ Charter introduced in 2017 by Kering and LVMH was ”a first step toward better compliance with human rights.” Describing the self-regulation approach as “insufficient,” the alliance noted the need for a neutral third-party monitor so that more models would have the incentive to come forward. As a result, the hotline for the Models’ Charter was ended since it was not being used, with the belief that models were fearful of being blacklisted by brands if they came forward.

Most working and aspiring models who fall victim to trafficking or abuse are unaware of their rights, or what to do when exploitation occurs, according to Ziff. Many models are afraid of retaliation when deciding whether or not to report abuse. The alliance believes the Respect program could create a safe and fair work environment. The initiative offers an enforceable code of conduct for the fashion industry, with mandatory consequences for brands, modeling agencies, photographers and other service providers who violate the terms of the code. Respect also creates a neutral third-party Standards Council that will be charged with receiving and investigating complaints, issuing corrective action plans to address work-related abuses and, ultimately, to work toward prevention. Finally, the program includes avenues for models to file complaints and seek guidance, which are improvements on the alliance’s existing support line.

In advance of Friday’s event in Paris, the alliance offered Kraehmer’s prepared remarks, noting that her modeling career started at the age of 12. She planned to attest that her manager sexually assaulted her, and her New York modeling agency turned out to be a criminal escort ring. “When I was trafficked, I was taken against my will to a house I had never seen before. I was kidnapped, assaulted and raped repeatedly — sometimes a dozen times in one day, and beaten any time I tried to fight back. I wanted to die,” said Kraehmer regarding abuses she suffered in 2015. “How could my dream of working for brands like Alexander McQueen and Dior — a dream that seemed within reach when I first moved to New York — result in scars on my body, broken bones, deep trauma and so much more?”

Regarding the timing of the European initiative, the alliance’s material referenced how the Jeffrey Epstein case “brought to light the problem of trafficking in the modeling industry, and highlighted how the issue is not only domestic but across borders.”

The alliance press material also cited the French modeling scout Jean-Luc Brunel, who was an associate of Epstein’s. French prosecutors have accused Brunel, the founder of Karin Model and MC2 Model Management, of sexual harassment. As a former companion of Epstein’s, Brunel is reportedly part of a larger investigation led by French officials into the alleged sexual exploitation of women and girls by Epstein and his circle. “Now, models are urging companies not only to address these abuses, but also to work toward prevention. With traffickers frequently posing as agents, photographers, or other professionals working in the industry, models are especially vulnerable to trafficking because few standards or norms exist regarding models’ recruitment and work conditions. When exploitation occurs, models are often unaware of their rights and lack adequate support,” the alliance’s material said.

“I know I am just one model,” said Kraehmer. “But there are thousands of stories like mine out there, thousands of models being taken advantage of. Some of their stories are told, but most are not.”"

Fendi unveiled several partnerships in the world of art and music during the period and it said the other brands continued to strengthen too.

Overall reported revenue growth for the business was 16% on 2018 to €38.3bn (£33.4bn)."
