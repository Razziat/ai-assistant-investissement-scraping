LVMH Puts Down $100M to Join Rush into Outlet Malls - Mingtiandi,"Sun, 25 Jan 2015 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1pbmd0aWFuZGkuY29tL3JlYWwtZXN0YXRlL3JldGFpbC9sdm1oLXB1dHMtZG93bi0xMDBtLXRvLWpvaW4tcnVzaC1pbnRvLW91dGxldC1tYWxscy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"China’s tigers and flies may be hiding their Gucci bags and Prada purses in the closet this year, but an investment fund belonging to one of the world’s largest luxury purveyors is betting $100 million that demand for logos and fine leather will rebound soon.

According to an article this week in the Wall Street Journal, L Capital Asia, a Singapore-based fund manager backed by LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton SA is putting its money into Sasseur Cayman Holding Ltd, a Chinese developer of outlet malls which now has four such projects selling discounted luxury items in China.

The investment by L Capital is a bet that outlet malls, long a staple of cost-conscious shoppers in the US, but only recently introduced to China, will catch on with the country’s famously label-driven consumers. However, the private equity firm and its partners will face stiff competition from other outlet developers on the mainland.

Planning for 20 New Malls

Sasseur opened its first mall in Chongqing in 2008, and armed with its new funding plans to add four more outlets this year. Within the next five years the developer is targetting 20 shopping centres nationwide.

Many analysts fear that China’s cities may be on their way to an oversupply of mall space and that developers may have overshot consumer demand. Dalian Wanda alone has opened more than 100 shopping centres in the last ten years, but recently announced plans to close or restructure at least 30 of its department stores.

According to a 2014 survey by Knight Frank, due in part to an anti-corruption drive by China’s government, most luxury retailers missed their targets for store expansions in 2013, and anecdotal reports since then have been increasingly negative regarding demand for luxury items.

However, Sasseur and L Capital are betting that outlets offering big brands at deep discounts will be the exception to the luxury rule.

“Outlet malls are countercyclical,” Sasseur’s founder and chairman Vito Xu was quoted as saying in the Journal account. “When retail sales fall, there is more excess inventory that needs to be cleared and more demand for bargain shopping.”

Sasseur Set to Compete with International Outlet Developers

While Sasseur is able to boast of strong performance for its malls to date, saying that sales have increased 30 percent per year since it opened in 2008, international developers are also busy building suburban shopping temples for luxury lovers.

US outlet developer Value Retail, which has developed and operates a chain of luxury outlet malls across Europe opened its first China shopping centre in Suzhou in April last year, and also has big plans for more malls in China.

Value Retail’s Shanghai outlet, located next to the city’s Disneyland resort, is expected to offer shoppers in China’s biggest city 50,000 square metres of discounted luxury brands when it opens in autumn this year, and the US company is targetting three more outlets in China within the next four years, with a total investment of around $450 million.

Another international company, Florentia Village, is building a chain of faux-Italian villages in China also offering discount luxury merchandise.

Florentia, which is invested by Silk Road Holdings, a joint venture of Gaw Capital Partners, Chinese-American investment group Waitex, Italy’s RDM, and TIAA Henderson Real Estate, opened its first outlet in Wuqing near Tianjin in 2011.

The private-equity backed mall developer is nearly ready to open a Florentia Village in Pudong, not far from the city’s international airport. Now Florentia has plans for more projects in Guangdong’s Foshan (also this year), Chongqing, Chengdu, Wuhan and Qingdao."

The move followed strong financial results by PVR, which did not disclose the purchase price.

PVR revealed net profits of $5.11 million (INR316 million), up 127%, for the third quarter, the three months to December 2014. Ticket sales were up 12% and revenue was up 25% to $66.7 million (INR4.12 billion).

Footfalls were boosted by the strong performance of Bollywood titles “Haider,” “Bang Bang,” “Happy New Year” and “PK.”

Just months after Jean-Claude Biver voiced harsh criticism over Apple Watch, the TAG Heuer interim CEO and head of timepieces at luxury monolith LVMH is furiously backpedalling, saying on Tuesday that the wearable is 'an incredible achievement' and that he plans to wear one.

In an interview with Bloomberg, Biver revealed TAG Heuer's upcoming smartwatch will not be ""Swiss Made,"" a designation that invokes thoughts of precise, fine craftsmanship. Luxury watchmakers often use the label as a marketing tool and the term can be found emblazoned on the cases of many pricey timepieces.

To earn the ""Swiss Made"" moniker, 50 percent of a watch's movement must be manufactured in Switzerland. The country may be on the cutting edge of mechanical watch design, but the region is leagues behind Silicon Valley when it comes to computer technology, miniaturization and software, all requisite components in realizing a smartwatch.

""We can't produce the engine, the chips, the applications, the hardware — nobody can produce it in Switzerland,"" Biver said. ""The hardware and the software will come from Silicon Valley. But the watch case, the dial, the design, the idea, the crown, that part of the watch will, of course, be Swiss.""

In many ways, the term ""smartwatch"" is a misnomer considering timekeeping is one of the last features in mind when picking one out.

According to Biver, however, Apple Watch represents the biggest threat to traditional watches in the sub-$2,000 range, a category in which TAG Heuer competes. LVMH's watch division includes other big-name manufactures like Hublot and Zenith, but pieces from those brands usually command much higher prices.

To make its smartwatch a reality, TAG Heuer was forced to partner with companies well beyond Swiss borders. Biver plans to announce the partnerships within the next six weeks. Internally, Biver has split TAG Heuer's R&D department into two teams, one dealing with watch engineers and another with technology experts.

When Apple first announced Apple Watch, Biver was dismissive, saying the device ""has no sex appeal"" and ""looks too much like the smartwatches already on the market."" At the time, he hinted that TAG Heuer would field its own wearable, but offered little in the way of details.

""It's a fantastic product, an incredible achievement,"" Biver said of Apple Watch. ""I'm not just living in the tradition and culture and the past, I also want to be connected to the future. The Apple Watch connects me to the future. My watch connects me to history, to eternity."""

Chinese Luxury Shoppers' Next Southeast Asia Hotspot: Cambodia - Jing Daily,"Mon, 12 Jan 2015 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vamluZ2RhaWx5LmNvbS9wb3N0cy9jaGluZXNlLWx1eHVyeS1zaG9wcGVycy1uZXh0LXNvdXRoZWFzdC1hc2lhLWhvdHNwb3QtY2FtYm9kaWHSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"A rendering of LVMH-owned, Hong Kong-based travel retailer DFS's planned Siem Reap location.

With a combination of riots, political instability, and multiple air disasters, many Southeast Asian countries had a hard time attracting China’s expanding number of outbound tourists in 2014. One notable exception, however, is Cambodia, which is quickly attracting the attention of luxury retailers as its Chinese visitor boom remains strong.

Cambodia’s luxury shopping scene saw the start of what is set to be a rapid transformation when China Duty Free Group (CDFG) opened its first location there on December 30, 2014, just in time for the upcoming Chinese New Year travel rush. Located in Siem Reap, the 4,500-square-foot location features over 200 brands including Dior, Laneige, SK-II, Shiseido, Lancôme, Estée Lauder, Clinique, Burberry, Hugo Boss, Bally, Michael Kors, Longines, Tissot, and Rado. As tariffs on imported luxury goods remain high in most of mainland China, duty-free travel retail has become an important source of growth for brands as Chinese consumers search for lower prices abroad. The Cambodia opening marks CDFG's first opening outside China, and a second location is slated to open in Phnom Penh in October 2015.

Following close behind these two landmark openings will be LVMH-owned, Hong Kong-based luxury travel retailer DFS’s newly announced 8,000-square-meter T Galleria location that will open its doors in 2016. Attached to the city’s Angkor National Museum in Siem Reap, the shopping center will sell a selection of its 700-plus luxury label portfolio including Chanel, Dolce & Gabbana, Louis Vuitton, and Bottega Veneta.

These retailers are moving in based on predictions that a recent surge in leisure-focused Chinese visitors will maintain momentum in the coming years. For the first 10 months of 2014, China was the source of Cambodia’s second-largest group of tourists after Vietnam with a 21 percent year-on-year growth rate, taking up 12.7 percent of all international tourist arrivals in the country. Although the total number is still likely to have fallen short of 1 million for the end of the year with 455,465 total Chinese visitors through October, the vast majority of these travelers cite their prime reason for visiting to be holiday travel (405,552), making their double-digit growth rate even more attractive for retailers.

In addition to retailers, luxury hoteliers are also planning to follow Chinese tourists to Cambodia. In June 2014, Starwood’s CEO noted that the company is looking to expand in countries with significant Chinese traveler growth, stating that “Cambodia’s opportunities are expanding.”

Cambodia remains a bright spot after a difficult recent year for Southeast Asian countries when it came to Chinese tourist growth. Malaysia’s multiple airline disasters, Vietnam’s anti-China riots, and Thailand’s political strife all led to slumping Chinese visitor numbers for 2014. Even countries not associated with these crises suffered—Singapore also lost out on Chinese tourist revenue as travelers canceled multi-country tours that often combined visits to Singapore and Malaysia.

These developments demonstrate how important it is for expanding luxury brands to closely follow Chinese tourists’ rapidly changing preferences. Although Asian destinations receive the vast majority of outbound Chinese tourists, regional issues can lead to dramatic changes from year to year regarding where this important and high-spending group of travelers decides to visit. This can be a challenge for brands and hoteliers looking to make a significant investment in a new location, making it vitally important to evaluate the long-term growth outlook for any country attracting large numbers of Chinese visitors."
The Grandmaster Aldo Magada Takes Over Zenith - Haute Time,"Sun, 04 Jan 2015 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhhdXRldGltZS5jb20vZ3JhbmRtYXN0ZXItYWxkby1tYWdhZGEtdGFrZXMtemVuaXRoL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The watch industry is one in which players make slow, calculated moves, and Jean-Claude Biver’s first as the new head of the LVMH Watches & Jewelry division was to place Aldo Magada as president and CEO of Zenith. The appointment isn’t so surprising. The two men have been rubbing shoulders ever since their partnership saved Omega in the 1990s. Zenith’s throne is a “dream” position, said Aldo Magada, and one he’s been preparing for his entire career. After more than three decades in the industry, working with brands across the board, he tells us why he’s finally ready to cross paths with Jean-Claude Biver once more, and explains their shared vision for Zenith’s future.

Your arrival at Zenith was announced shortly after Jean-Claude Biver’s appointment as the head of the watches division at the LVMH group. The two of you have known each other very well since your days at Omega. How beneficial is this reunion for Zenith?

AM: I joined Jean-Claude Biver as vice president of marketing for product communication at Omega, and I’ve been close to him ever since. The way we work has never changed. He has always had that same entrepreneurial attitude, ever since he sold Blancpain to the Swatch Group Ltd. That was before he started working for Omega [also Swatch Group]. So I was working with a man who loved the brand and who wanted to put the brand back on the map. We shared that common goal, so working with Jean-Claude was incredible. Not only does he have the qualities of a gentleman, but his vision is also unique. He sees an issue in a way that most people can’t even imagine. He’s also a great partner to work with. He is always challenging you, and that for me proved to be great training before the upper echelon.

After Omega, you worked closely with several brands such as Gucci, TechnoMarine, and Breitling. How did these experiences shape you, and what can you take from them into your new role at Zenith?

AM: After a first experience as Head of Watches at Gucci, I joined TechnoMarine. It was more as a consultant than as a member of the company. But for me it was the only way to see what it was like working with a startup. And with Reuge and Badollet, it was exactly the same kind of thing. The only problem was sometimes you have to work with people to finance a project and that was a painful experience. But it’s always an experience. It was interesting to see how you have to manage a small startup company to try to succeed because you don’t have the power that a Gucci, a Prada, or an Omega brand has. So it was interesting for me to look at another side of the business and it was the first time I was in control of the situation.

AM: You’ll be in control once more at Zenith, but this time, you will be backed by LVMH, another large group. That must be very exciting.

Working for Zenith is a dream for anyone in this industry. It’s one of the very few true manufactures in Switzerland, and it’s a great brand. It’s still a small company but it has a lot of potential. As a manager, I’d have to say it’s interesting because it is still scaled at a human level. We have 270 people working in-house and another hundred outside. As a marketer it’s a great challenge to make sure that people can hear our message. The vision is that one-day, people will know about Zenith before the marketing campaigns even reach them. Now to work once more with Mr. Biver, I have to say, is another luxury for me. Of course, he’s more mature and I’m more mature, and we have also built a trusting and informal relationship today. And it’s easier for me because I’m working with one of the most knowledgeable people in the industry. I’m very proud to be a part of LVMH. It’s an incredible shareholder to have because it is respectful of the brands, of course. LVMH wants real growth, not fictitious growth. When we need help, financial or otherwise, it’s definitely a plus to have the premier luxury financial group in the world by our side.

Having settled into your new role, what are the objectives that you are setting for yourself and the brand?

AM: At a brand like Zenith, the CEO is serving the brand, and not the other way around. So the strategy that the brand currently has won’t be changing. Mr. Jean-Frédéric Dufour [Zenith’s former CEO] did a terrific job with the manufacture and did a terrific job restoring Zenith’s place on the market. But as a brand, we are now looking towards the next phase of our evolution. Because of my background in product development, I can really help the management community here to push the brand and the vision Jean-Claude Biver and I share. The backing of the group will of course allow us to move forward. Of course, we are talking about increasing the turnover; we are talking about the image of the brand, and brand awareness. But what’s the most important is customer satisfaction, and the many years that follow the purchase of a Zenith watch. I’m concentrating on maximizing this aspect of our service.

If you were one of those customers, which models would you currently pick from Zenith’s collection, past or present?

AM: There are a lot of incredible watches in the Zenith collection of course, but the watch that stands out, apart from the Haute Horlogerie pieces such as the Christopher Columbus, has to be the Zenith El Primero Chronomaster 1969. It’s the quintessential Zenith, because it combines the work of Thierry Nataf (another former Zenith CEO) with the modern twist that is the opening on the dial. And it has a great classical case, which was made by Mr. Dufour. It’s a great synthesis of what Zenith is about. Zenith is about movement; Zenith is about design; Zenith is about heritage.

Besides having such a rich past to draw from, Zenith is also exploring new territory with contemporary partnerships with Felix Baumgartner, the Rolling Stones, and Russell Westbrook all featuring limited edition models in recent years. Will we see more of that in the future?

AM: We’ve always featured on the wrists of the adventurous, whether it be on Louis Blériot, the first person to cross the channel, or even Mr. Mohandas ‘Mahatma’ Gandhi, who also wore a Zenith. And we will definitely continue to do so. We are now looking for new possibilities with people who are defining the future. We also continue to work with and celebrate the Stones because it’s important for us to be with someone such as the Rolling Stones. These guys are classic because they belong to the music history, but are definitely not traditional. And Zenith is exactly like that in regards to the history of watchmaking.

And where do you see it in the future of that industry?

AM: Well, I cannot share specifics, but Zenith is the leader of the high-frequency chronograph. And I would like Zenith to be the number one destination for people who are looking for a mechanical watch priced between $6,000 to $20,000.

The Parsons School of Design graduate and her husband, Lev Glazman, borrowed $10,000 and created one bar of soap, and it led to their creation of international beauty brand Fresh. LVMH purchased the brand in 2000, but Roytberg and Glazman remain co-presidents of the company. Here, Roytberg shares how her definition of success has changed, the challenges and rewards of building a business and the advice she’d give her daughters.

The dry cleaning business was a transition into our roles in beauty; it was our first retail space. It was a good lesson in customer service! After running our beauty store for a few years, Lev and I were ready to put our signature on a product: a line of soaps. Soap is like the bread of personal care, a commodity product we wanted to make special with a moisturizing formula, compelling scents, and aesthetically pleasing packaging.

Our biggest challenge was funding. Lev and I borrowed $10,000 from our parents to pay for initial inventory and rent. We did cosmetic renovations ourselves, and my architect friend helped build the checkout fixture, which was important for gift wrap, hospitality and sales. Another challenge: Our location was a destination venue, so traffic in that area was slight. We later relocated to Newbury Street (a major retail area), and are still there. Our dream for Fresh was bigger than one store location, and we were unstoppable in finding ways to grow it.

I was in my 20s in the 1980s and wore a punk look, so eye makeup and lipstick were a big part of my beauty ritual. I regret wearing eight eye shadow colors at once! Every decade of your life comes with its own adventures. Now, it’s about skincare and minimal makeup. I really enjoy going without makeup on many days in my office in Boston.

Success in my 20s was more about the individual, whereas now, I am proud of our teams and having built a community of passionate, dedicated people who enjoy their work. The response to our products is so rewarding. People recommending them and giving them as gifts to their friends and families confirms the need for our concept.

In my 20s, I wanted to be a fashion designer. There was a clear path from an assistant designer to a designer for a fashion house to possibly starting my own label. However, seeing how my work life turned out, I’d advise being open to anything. Design opportunities came from everywhere. At Fresh, I designed graphics and packaging. I was fortunate to have a good design education, and a designer is a designer regardless of field. I would advise my two daughters [Thais, 21, and Dalia, 7] to value themselves, do the best they can and believe in their individual beauty. Knowledge and experience are the best ammunition for having confidence in anything you do. Always try to learn more than is required; there is no such thing as useless information."
Work on Parisian former department store La Samaritaine stops again - The Guardian,"Tue, 06 Jan 2015 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS93b3JsZC8yMDE1L2phbi8wNi93b3JrLXBhcmlzaWFuLWRlcGFydG1lbnQtc3RvcmUtbGEtc2FtYXJpdGFpbmUtc3RvcHPSAWFodHRwczovL2FtcC50aGVndWFyZGlhbi5jb20vd29ybGQvMjAxNS9qYW4vMDYvd29yay1wYXJpc2lhbi1kZXBhcnRtZW50LXN0b3JlLWxhLXNhbWFyaXRhaW5lLXN0b3Bz?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The controversial development of the former department store La Samaritaine in Paris has been halted once again after a court withdrew building permission.

The decision came just three months after a court decision stopping work on the art nouveau and art deco landmark on the right bank of the Seine was overturned.

Luxury group LVMH, owned by France’s richest man, Bernard Arnault, is behind the €460m development of the site into a palatial hotel, duty-free shops, designer stores and offices as well as social housing, a day centre and a creche.

Campaigners have objected to the knocking down of several historic buildings at the rear of the site on the popular Rue de Rivoli and the replacement of their historic facades with what the Japanese architects describe as a “set of etched glass waves” but which opponents say will look like a shower curtain.

Two of the three pre-Haussmannian buildings on the Rue de Rivoli were pulled down during a brief period in the stop-start scheme when demolition was authorised before a new court order froze the bulldozers in their tracks. The owners of La Samaritaine, who have the backing of the city authorities, will now seek a final ruling from the Council of State.

The row over the future of La Samaritaine, which was acquired by LVMH in 2001, has rumbled on since the store was closed in 2005 for safety reasons. LVMH says the project will create 2,100 jobs and was approved by the relevant government and local authorities. The redeveloped site was due to open next year.

Campaigners fighting the development hailed Monday’s court decision as a victory for Paris.

In a statement, the Society for the Protection of the Countryside and the Beauty of France and SOS Paris said the ruling by the administrative appeals court was wise and studied.

“Quite apart from La Samaritaine, which is a symbolic case, is the problem of the place of contemporary architecture in ancient areas. Today, Parisians must grasp this victory, which is the fruit of a democratic battle fought by the associations,” it said."

On Tuesday media reported that LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton’s private equity arm L Capital is in talks to acquire a stake in Bateel, four people with knowledge of the matter said.

L Capital, backed by the LVMH Group and the billionaire chairman Bernard Arnault’s family holding company, is seeking a minority stake in the Riyadh-based firm, the people said, asking not to be identified as talks are private.

Yesterday Ata Atmar, managing director of Bateel, said in a statement: “We are poised to accelerate Bateel’s expansion beyond our current core markets in the Gulf”.

Bateel has a presence in 14 countries across Africa, Europe, Asia and the Middle East including in the UAE. It has its own date groves at Al Ghat in central Saudi Arabia.

The company has also launched a chain of cafes and bakeries for gourmet food and beverages.

“With the world seeking healthier and newer options, we believe the Bateel franchise has tremendous potential, and we hope to work closely with the company to take the brand to more people across the globe,” said Ravi Thakran, chairman and managing partner of L Capital Asia.

L Capital, based in Singapore, was formed in 2009 and focuses on investments in retail and luxury industries, among others.

The Future of Tag Heuer: Philippe Alluard - The Peak Singapore,"Thu, 22 Jan 2015 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXBlYWttYWdhemluZS5jb20uc2cvaW50ZXJ2aWV3cy90aGUtZnV0dXJlLW9mLXRhZy1oZXVlci1waGlsaXBwZS1hbGx1YXJkLTIv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"To stay ahead, you sometimes have to change direction. Such agility, you would imagine, would be second nature to a 155-year-old watch company that also happens to be the biggest brand within French luxury group LVMH. It’s a notion that Tag Heuer’s global sales vice-president Philippe Alluard reinforces during his recent interview with The Peak.

“We have no sacred cows,” says the French-American executive, who is both friendly and disarmingly frank. He is referring not just to Tag Heuer’s industry-disrupting innovations such as its belt-driven Monaco V4 timepieces, but to the brand’s recent strategic repositioning. The new direction will see Tag Heuer – which has an estimated annual turnover of one billion euros (S$1.6 billion) – focusing on its mid-range offerings and slowing its shift towards the higher end of the market.

He says matter of factly: “We tried to shift the brand upwards too quickly and the market castigated us.”

The brand is “still growing”, notes Alluard, but “not at the rate we had been growing before”. He adds: “Traditionally and for many years, Tag Heuer has been the epitome of access to selective Swiss watchmaking. In the last five years, we strayed a little from that segment. We were heavily promoting our manufacture movements at higher price levels, and we lost part of that customer base. We want to regain this territory, and also be that sporty, nice-looking watch for the affluent person who wants to go to the beach or on a motorcycle ride on the weekend.”

Under the direction of Jean-Claude Biver, head of the LVMH Watches Division, Tag Heuer will streamline its collections, concentrating on its watches in the 1,500 Swiss francs (S$2,030) to 5,500 Swiss francs price range. Last June, the company announced that it would be putting the production of its new CH80 chronograph movement on hold, less than a year after it was presented. The personnel changes that have taken place in recent months show the extent of the brand’s recalibrations. Last September, it was reported that several management and production jobs had been cut, followed by news of the resignation of CEO Stephane Linder in December.

Accompanying this change in course is the new (and perhaps, telling) “Don’t Crack Under Pressure” campaign, which features brand ambassadors such as Maria Sharapova and Cristiano Ronaldo. The latest advertisements draw attention to – and parallels between – the physical and mental strength of these star athletes, and the sturdiness and innovative qualities of the watches.

But make no mistake: Its renewed focus on its more affordably priced pieces does not mean that one should stop expecting game-changing horological surprises from the brand, which unveiled cutting-edge watches such as the Tag Heuer Carrera Mikropendulum Tourbillon at special events in Singapore last November.

Says Alluard: “We are working on several projects, and we hope to be the first watch brand to enter in certain territories. The brand is going to be more affordable, but it is still going to be very exciting.”"
