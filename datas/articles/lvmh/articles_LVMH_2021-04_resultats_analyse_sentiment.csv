"Louis Vuitton, Dior Drive LVMH's COVID Comeback - Jing Daily","Tue, 13 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiO2h0dHBzOi8vamluZ2RhaWx5LmNvbS9wb3N0cy9sb3Vpcy12dWl0dG9uLWRpb3ItbHZtaC1xMS0yMDIx0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LVMH is starting off the new year with some celebratory results.

On April 13, the world’s largest luxury group reported that revenue jumped 32 percent in the first quarter of 2021 to 14 billion euros (16.7 billion), thanks to strong sales in Asia and the US. This growth wasn’t just good for pandemic-stricken times; it actually beat out 2019 numbers, with total organic sales rising 8 percent compared to the same period two years ago.

While all activities, except selective retailing, contributed to LVMH’s comeback, it was fashion and leather goods that saw the most success. Bolstered by its big name brands, this segment posted record levels of revenue growth, up 52 percent compared to 2020 and 37 percent compared to 2019. As expected, these results were led by reigning champs Louis Vuitton and Dior, which doubled down on serving their local clients.

One only has to look at China — which helped drive LVMH’s 86 percent sales surge in Asia — to see this strategy in play. In January, Louis Vuitton appointed “Mulan” actress Liu Yifei as its new brand ambassador, leveraging her 68 million Weibo followers and international appeal to strengthen its digital performance. Meanwhile, Dior drew 11 million viewers with its Spring 2021 Couture livestream and star-studded discussion panel that month, following the welcomed launch of its Lunar New Year Collection.

This quarter also marked the integration of Tiffany & Co. for the first time since its acquisition closed in January, which more than doubled the size of the watches and jewelry segment and offset negative currency impact. Little was said, however, other than the jewelry Maison “saw an excellent start to the year.”

Looking ahead, the luxury giant stated that it “is well-equipped to build upon the hoped-for recovery in 2021 and regain growth momentum for all its businesses.” And so far, between Dior’s Shanghai Fashion Week appearance and scheduled pop-up stores, as well as the launch of Louis Vuitton’s Objets Nomades exhibition in Hong Kong this month, it looks like LVMH may be popping champagne by the year’s end as well.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9999998807907104}",positive,0.9999998807907104,1
"LVMH Has No Plans to Take On Resale Market, Says Antoine Arnault - WWD","Fri, 30 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3dkLmNvbS9mZWF0dXJlL2x2bWgtbm8tcGxhbnMtdG8tdGFrZS1vbi1yZXNhbGUtbWFya2V0LXNheXMtYW50b2luZS1hcm5hdWx0LTEyMzQ4MTE1NDAv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS — LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton does not plan on getting involved in the secondhand market, according to Antoine Arnault, head of image and environment for the French luxury group, who spoke to WWD international editor Miles Socha at Fairchild Media Group’s Sustainability Summit on a range of topics, including live fashion shows, sustainability rankings and cooperating with competitors.

“It’s definitely a business that’s been thriving, as we see and read, but as I was just mentioning, we have such long-lasting products and we repair them, we for the moment will stick to that and proposing as beautiful new products, as creative and thrilling new collections as we can,” he said.

“For the moment we will stay away from that secondhand market,” added Arnault.

The secondhand market has been heating up lately and Kering earlier this month revealed an investment in luxury resale platform Vestiaire Collective, a company that has embraced data and digital means for global expansion.

Arnault instead emphasized his company’s focus on repairing products, and characterized his group’s focus on fashion that lasts as opposed to fast-fashion.

“Our products are very long-lasting,” he asserted, suggesting that the company produces things “in very small quantities” and offers products that one should “never throw away.”

“I don’t think we have anything to do with this fast-cycle industry, we have long-lasting very ‘durable products,’” he said, drawing on an argument often employed in the high-end industry in response to questions about the environmental impact of activities.

LVMH is expanding repair services as a way to improve the lifespan of products, noted Arnault, who is also chief executive officer of Berluti, a brand that reshines shoes with a fresh patina after use.

When it comes to the issue of fashion shows, the executive said that the group had convened experts in the sector, including Marine Serre and Alexandre de Betak, to discuss issues around the future of luxury, including the necessity of fashion shows.

“As always, with these topics that seem simple, they are not,” he said. While bringing people across the planet for a cruise show was probably “a bit too much,” fashion weeks mean brisk business for hotels and restaurants, noted the executive.

“But even probably more importantly so, countless designers, young designers who have their only opportunity of the year or of the season to show what they do to buyers, to press, to opinion makers, to celebrities that will maybe pick on that one look that they have and suddenly become a success,” he said.

Still, the pandemic has brought lasting change to the sector’s approach, noted Arnault.

“We probably have reached the end of a cycle at the beginning of this pandemic and the end of a system in a way,” he remarked.

“We recognize that there was some sort of frenzy in the past few years and maybe we ourselves in a way have been swept into a whirlwind to always want to offer something extravagant and novel,” said Arnault.

Before, physical events came first, while their translation into the digital realm were thought up after, he noted.

“Now it’s the other way around — it completely shifted that paradigm.”

“However I do think that physical shows will absolutely continue,” he continued, suggesting that a lack of physical shows would benefit the biggest fashion houses.

“But that’s not the way we see it — we need also young designers to thrive and through fashion weeks do they thrive,” he said.

“Keeping these fashion shows alive, I think, is also a priority,” said Arnault.

Asked about the role of Stella McCartney since she joined the group in 2019, the executive described her as “our internal activist.”

“But she’s very open-minded and she doesn’t impose her views on everyone else, she works very intelligently with the rest of the designers and the rest of the teams, she is not selfish about her findings or her technology — she gives them away, it’s a sort of open source with her,” he said, citing her focus to upcycling and supply chains as an influence. Louis Vuitton offered upcycled sneakers this spring and Fendi is monitoring suppliers.

When it comes to policies on fur and exotic leathers, the group leaves it up to individual brands to make their own decisions, he said.

“When you address the issue seriously and when you talk to experts, it’s the sad truth that through commerce of these animal skins or animal furs, you manage to help to preserve the species,” he noted.

“It’s a sad fact, I’m not saying it’s something great, but it’s the scientific and the absolute truth,” he said.

“So we took the decision as a group — and I’m not saying it’s courageous and I’m not saying it’s any kind of bravery — but we took the decision to continue to help these economies, to help these people who often live only through the commerce of these animals and skin and to continue to propose them to our clients,” said Arnault.

Reflecting on the group’s efforts related to biodiversity, through Unesco’s ‘Man and the Biosphere’ program, the executive noted the group relies on materials from nature.

“Biodiversity and protection of nature’s ecosystems has always been at the heart of what we do,” he said. “We are are very reliant on nature and raw materials, probably more than any other group — I mean flowers with perfumes, vines for our wines and spirits, cotton, leather, stones, you name it, we depend — our future depends on the fact that nature continues to offer us its wonders,” he said.

When it comes to sustainability rankings, he said the group is not “obsessed” about them.

“There are more and more of these rankings, and while we take the matter very seriously as you can imagine and hold ourselves accountable for progress — the methodology of these rankings is sometimes not very transparent, and we strive to do our best efforts of transparency and publish the most relevant information,” he said.

“We feel very confident that we are taking the right track. I think in the long run we’re taking the right decision not to be obsessed by this or that ranking,” added Arnault.

Asked about cooperating with others in the industry — LVMH raised eyebrows for not signing up to the Fashion Pact, set up by Kering last year — the executive said there was “healthy emulation” in the sector on sustainability issues even as there is competition in other areas.

“On very important topics we see groups that unite sometimes and if it leads to good decisions, you saw we partnered up with the rest of the industry for the model charter for instance,” he said.

“We tend to cooperate more than people think with our competitors for the simple reason that we often have the same suppliers and we speak more often than people think with them, so trying to enhance best practices, create new standards, I think it’s important that we keep a good relationship.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9998573064804077}",neutral,0.9998573064804077,0
LVMH Increases Stake in Tod's to 10 Percent - The Business of Fashion,"Thu, 22 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzb2ZmYXNoaW9uLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy9uZXdzLWFuYWx5c2lzL2x2bWgtaW5jcmVhc2VzLXN0YWtlLWluLXRvZHMtdG8tMTAtcGVyY2VudC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"French luxury goods group LVMH will increase its stake in fashion company Tod’s to 10%, Tod’s said on Thursday, in a move which sources described as “friendly support” for the Italian struggling leather goods maker.

Tod’s said in a statement that LVMH would buy a 6.8% stake from Tod’s founder and Chairman Diego Della Valle. LVMH, led by French billionaire Bernard Arnault, already owned a 3.2% stake in Tod’s.

“Through this transaction, the twenty-year friendship between the Arnault and Della Valle families is reinforced”, Tod’s said in its statement.

A source close to the matter said the French giant does not expect to raise its stake further for now. Diego Della Valle has been a member of LVMH’s board of directors since 2002.

The Italian luxury leather goods maker has performed worse than most rivals as a result of the coronavirus pandemic in 2020. It said in January sales had fallen by almost a third last year, marking the fifth year in a row of falling annual sales.

The group, known for its loafer shoes, launched a new strategy in late 2017 to revamp its brand and lure younger consumers, but the health crisis has hampered its efforts. Earlier this month, Italian influencer Chiara Ferragni joined its board, in a move that pushed shares sharply higher and was seen as a bid to rejuvenate its image.

There has been recurring market speculation that Tod’s could be the target of a takeover by a bigger group, although Della Valle, who has increased his stake in the company in the past couple of years, has repeatedly denied this possibility.

“This may represent an excellent reason to consider further opportunities to be taken in the future ahead”, Della Valle said of LVMH’s stake increase on Thursday, without elaborating.

LVMH, which has more than 70 brands after building up an empire through a string of acquisitions, last week reported surging sales in the first quarter, beating market expectations and fuelling hopes it may be putting the health emergency squarely behind it this year.

The group is often rumoured as a predator, even though it has just completed a $15.8 billion takeover of U.S. jeweller Tiffany and has said it is focused on absorbing that purchase for now. However, Jefferies analyst Flavio Cereda said in a note late on Thursday there could be speculation of a further LVMH stake increase in Tod’s.

The price agreed for LVMH’s stake purchase is 33.10 euros per share, a 10% discount to Tod’s share price. Tod’s shares closed at 35.3 euros on Thursday.

After the transaction, which is expected to be executed on April 28, Della Valle will own 63.64% of Tod’s outstanding shares.

“We are very happy to reinforce further this partnership”, LVMH boss Arnault said in the statement.

Cutting down on waste: LVMH to sell deadstock fabrics on new resale site Nona Source - Fortune,"Tue, 27 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiqQFodHRwczovL2ZvcnR1bmUuY29tLzIwMjEvMDQvMjcvbHZtaC1sdXh1cnktZGVhZHN0b2NrLXJlc2FsZS1zaXRlLWZhc2hpb24taW5kdXN0cnktbm9uYS1zb3VyY2UtZGlzY291bnQtZmFicmljLWxvdWlzLXZ1aXR0b24tZGlvci1mZW5kaS1jZWxpbmUtbWFyYy1qYWNvYnMtZ2l2ZW5jaHktbG9ld2Uv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Luxury goods conglomerate LVMH is launching an online market platform to sell off its deadstock high-end fabrics instead of letting them pile up in warehouses, or worse, having them destroyed.

The new online marketplace called Nona Source will re-sell fabrics and leathers that were once carefully selected by designers working at one of the many fashions houses owned under the LVMH brand.

The fabrics could come from any of the LVMH-owned brands, including Louis Vuitton, Christian Dior, Fendi, Givenchy, Celine, Loewe, and Marc Jacobs.

All materials on sale will be certified LVMH Maisons’ deadstock and will be sold at around 70% of the original wholesale price.

Grassroot idea

The idea began from inventory managers working at Givenchy and Kenzo and was brought to LVMH’s DARE program which is a platform within the company that allows workers to propose ideas that promote a more circular fashion economy.

Unused fabric costs the industry $120 billion per year, according to online deadstock marketplace Queen of Raw, who note wasted fabrics either end up burned or buried.

""@LVMH coming out there and publicly stating what they are doing…is extremely valuable,"" @queenofraw says. ""Everybody's got this waste…But now…we can do better with our waste, make money, save money, have a sustainable story to tell."" https://t.co/jBvCttNKrb — Queen of Raw (@queenofraw) April 26, 2021

However, the new market place is careful not to sell any LVMH exclusive patterns or branded fabrics so as not to devalue its brands.

LVMH is a hugely profitable business and is doing well even despite the drop in footfall at its stores.

LVMH was in hot water previously about its disposal of excess clothes to ensure they were not reused or sold on. The firm was not the only one to do this. Upmarket British fashion label Burberry burned its unsold clothes, accessories and perfume worth £28.6m in 2018 to protect its brand. LVMH rival Richemont, which owns jewelry and watch brands Cartier, Piaget, and Baume & Mercier, admitted in May 2018 that in an effort to keep its products out of the hands of unauthorized sellers, it had destroyed about $563 million worth of watches.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999338388442993}",neutral,0.9999338388442993,0

LVMH Sees No Danger to China Business From Xinjiang Cotton Issue - WWD,"Tue, 13 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3dkLmNvbS9mZWF0dXJlL2x2bWgtY2hpbmEteGluamlhbmctY290dG9uLWNvbnRyb3ZlcnN5LTEyMzQ4MDA1NDMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS — LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton is not worried about the potential fallout from the ongoing controversy over Xinjiang cotton.

In recent weeks, China has cracked down on foreign companies like Hennes & Mauritz AB that have said they won’t source cotton from Xinjiang due to concerns over alleged forced labor. The U.S. in January banned all goods made of cotton from China’s Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region.

A host of foreign brands have been ensnared, including Nike, Adidas, Uniqlo and Burberry, but H&M is the only one to have had its online stores on all the major Chinese e-commerce sites blocked.

During a conference call with analysts after LVMH published first-quarter sales, chief financial officer Jean-Jacques Guiony was asked whether he felt that any of the group’s major brands might be at risk from the Chinese boycott, which has seen Chinese brand ambassadors cut ties with the companies concerned.

Neither LVMH nor its brands have made any statement on the issue of Xinjiang cotton so far.

While he did not address the controversy directly, Guiony indicated he did not perceive a threat to the French luxury conglomerate, which generated 41 percent of its revenues in Asia in the first quarter, making it by far the most important geographic region for its business.

“I’ve never seen a big threat in being successful in a given country. Everybody’s talking about China being an issue. As far as I’m concerned, it’s more an opportunity than anything else,” he said.

“We are very happy with the business we do there and we believe that it’s a complex country, like any other business, I would say, and we are not particularly worried that something very bad could happen there,” Guiony added.

"LVMH, Richemont and Prada Join Forces in Blockchain Consortium - WWD","Tue, 20 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3dkLmNvbS9mZWF0dXJlL2x2bWgtcmljaGVtb250LXByYWRhLWJsb2NrY2hhaW4tY29uc29ydGl1bS0xMjM0ODA1Mjc2L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Three European rivals are joining forces in an “unprecedented collaboration” to help consumers trace the provenance and authenticity of luxury goods.

LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, which in 2019 initiated the Aura platform, will be joined by Prada Group and Compagnie Financière Richemont in the Aura Blockchain Consortium, which will promote the use of a single blockchain solution open to all luxury brands worldwide.

Bulgari, Cartier, Hublot, Louis Vuitton and Prada are already keyed into the platform, which will give consumers direct access to a product’s history, proof of ownership, warranty and maintenance record.

According to a joint release revealing the creation of the consortium, it is in “advanced” discussions with several independent brands, and “brands within founder groups” to join soon since the blockchain “offers flexibility to support companies of various sizes and to adapt to individual needs.”

LVMH, Prada and Richemont worked together to create a “single solution to address the shared challenges of communicating authenticity, responsible sourcing and sustainability in a secure digital format.”

Known as a “multinodal private blockchain,” the platform records information in a secure and non-reproducible manner and generates a certificate for its owner, “enhancing the desire for beautiful objects made with savoir-faire and high-quality sustainable materials,” the consortium said.

It stressed that “luxury brands have a unique story to tell on the quality of their materials, craftsmanship and creativity” and that the blockchain would “increase customer trust in the brands’ sustainable practices and product sourcing.”

The Aura platform was developed in partnership with Microsoft and New York-based blockchain software technology company ConsenSys, and the consortium will operate out of Geneva.

In an interview, Toni Belloni, group managing director of LVMH, said consumer demand to know more about what they buy — from authenticity to traceability along the supply chain — is growing and has not been fully satisfied, until now. The blockchain will allow a jewelry purchaser to have information on ethical sources of diamonds, for example.

What’s more, luxury clients will be better served by “an industry standard rather than having to deal with the complexity of each brand having its own approach. The customer will have one known and trusted platform,” Belloni said.

Lorenzo Bertelli, head of marketing and corporate social responsibility at Prada Group, agreed, mentioning the confusion engendered by having various operating systems for mobile telephones.

“It was a common-sense decision,” he said when asked about joining forces with rivals. “It’s easier for everyone to build something together, instead of everybody investing by himself only to find out that is better to find a common platform, a common language.”

He noted Prada has yet to launch its consumer-facing app and online “environment,” but has been readying for the Aura blockchain by embedding radio-frequency identification chips, or RFID, into “millions” of products, which began reaching stores in the second half of 2020. Consumers can register their products retroactively as soon as its app goes live.

“In our eyes, it’s a service,” he said, speaking over Zoom, noting that the “hardest part” is deciding how to best leverage the blockchain as another differentiator for makers of luxury goods. “Every brand will have his own strategy.”

Louis Vuitton was the first to leverage the Aura platform and has already issued a “very significant” number of certificates, Belloni said, characterizing the blockchain as a tech-enhanced update on guarantee certificates sold with products such as high-end watches. “This is another way of protecting the brand and the purchaser.”

For brand marketers, the blockchain also offers a weapon against counterfeiters and gray-market distribution, he added.

“This is a clever and appropriate initiative,” said Luca Solca, senior research analyst at Bernstein. “The whole industry will benefit from having common systems and standards that consumers can use to check product history and authenticity. I would indeed expect more brands to converge on a common platform – neutral and flexible for each brand to use it as appropriate.”

Belloni said LVMH invested “a few millions” to establish the initial Aura blockchain, and there is a mechanism so the shared investments of the consortium founders are refunded over time, while ensuring that monies be invested to continue improving the technological platform for future needs. Participating luxury brands pay an annual licensing fee and a volume fee, he said, noting that the consortium is not-for-profit.

Belloni said the platform will be dedicated to all manner of luxury goods, even potentially cars, and any brand where “high standards of quality, traceability, transparency and authenticity” are a given.

“To be sure, the industry is very competitive and will stay very competitive. But this is one area where we have decided that an industry approach would be beneficial,” he said.

Bertelli agreed, calling the consortium a “deep collaboration” between major luxury groups, and one that opened the door to future possibilities.

“I see a lot of potential for collaboration with key players in the sector,” he said. “I don’t set limits. It’s something that never happened before. I really believe that we would be surprised how much [potential] we can unlock if we work together instead of independently.”

The executives also stressed a desire to have brands of all scales join the consortium. Belloni confirmed French conglomerate Kering has had discussions with the consortium.

“We want a platform that is really an open-source platform, open to everybody, consumer brands, smaller brands. We’re going to be more than happy to welcome niche brands in the luxury sector,” Bertelli said.

The emergence of secure digital identities for luxury goods comes at a time when the commerce of online counterfeit and knockoff products is accelerating along with online fraud and the sale of stolen luxury goods. A blockchain provides clarity on where an item was originally purchased and when it is offered for resale, which will cast a spotlight on gray-market trading, such as China’s thriving daigou networks.

Resale site The RealReal applauded the Aura development: “We believe that commitment to authenticity is fundamental to expanding the luxury resale market. We welcome and support the efforts of all brands to develop and implement tools to ensure authenticity in the secondary market and extend the life cycle of luxury goods.”

“The luxury industry creates timeless pieces, and must ensure that these rigorous standards will endure and remain in trustworthy hands,” said Cyrille Vigneron, president and chief executive officer of Cartier and a member of Richemont’s senior executive committee and board. “Blockchain is a key technology to enhance customer service, relationship with partners and traceability…We therefore invite the entire profession to join this consortium to design a new luxury era enabled by blockchain technology.”

Richemont also uses Arianee solutions for some of its watch brands.

“Although the ambition is to attract as many brands as possible on Aura, the group’s brands are free to choose, the idea being that competition will further raise the standards,” said a spokeswoman for the consortium.

LVMH has started the 2021 financial year with a return to sales growth led by demand for fashion and leather goods from Asia and US shoppers, even as its European store network remains closed.

The fashion and leather goods category posted 52 per cent growth compared with 2020. Financial market analysis firm Visible Alpha anticipated an increase of 31 per cent. Louis Vuitton and Dior were the two standouts, with performance strength across the handbag, ready-to-wear and shoe categories, chief financial officer Jean-Jacques Guiony said. He also noted strong performances at Fendi, Loewe, Celine and Marc Jacobs.

LVMH, the world’s largest luxury goods conglomerate, is outpacing the market as it continues to spend on marketing while rivals hold back, and demand from luxury consumer shoppers, who still can’t spend on travel and experiences, continues. For the group, sales rose 30 per cent compared with 2020, and 8 per cent compared with the pre-pandemic period in 2019. That’s a rebound from the overall fourth-quarter sales decline of 19 per cent. Watches and jewellery rose 35 per cent, the perfumes and cosmetics division climbed 18 per cent, with Selective Retailing, which includes Sephora and DFS, the outlier, dropping 5 per cent in the quarter.

“The hefty market share gains at Louis Vuitton should carry on as product flow continues to impress and the ‘buy less, buy better’ attitude of consumers remains supportive,” wrote HSBC global head of consumer and retail research Erwan Rambourg. “Dior Couture is on a soaring trajectory, which has no rationale for being halted any time soon.”","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9999990463256836}",positive,0.9999990463256836,1
LVMH ups Tod's stake as footwear brands surge back into fashion - Fortune,"Fri, 23 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vZm9ydHVuZS5jb20vMjAyMS8wNC8yMy9mYW5jeS1mb290d2Vhcmx1eHVyeS1ncm91cC1sdm1oLXJhaXNlcy1zdGFrZS1pdGFsaWFuLXRvZHMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Unlike its peers which have done increasingly well in the last year, Tod’s S.p.A. has been faltering, but that didn’t stop LVMH, the ultimate firm in the luxury market, from raising its stake in the leather-goods maker.

LVMH raised its stake in the group to 10% from 3.2% for €74.5 million ($89.9 million). The move is expected to help shore up Tod’s, which has been pursuing a makeover of its own to bring in younger clientele.

“This may represent an excellent reason to consider further opportunities to be taken in the future ahead,” said Tod’s CEO, Diego Della Valle, in a press release. That led Jefferies analyst Flavio Cereda-Parini to say in a research note that speculation could emerge over whether LVMH will further increase its position.

Tod’s stock was up 11.3% at €39.28, while LVMH was down 0.6% at €628.30 mid-afternoon European time.

Tod’s, which is known for its classic loafers, also owns a stable of three other luxury brands including Roger Vivier, Hogan, and Fay. But the company is dwarfed by LVMH—owner of brands including Moët & Chandon Champagne, Louis Vuitton, and Christian Dior—which has a reputation for buying up fashion firms.

The Tod’s Group launched a new strategy in 2017 to lure younger customers to its brands and revamp its image. Earlier this month, the group brought on Italian influencer Chiara Ferragni to join the board and leverage her “knowledge of the world of young people.”

Tod’s itself has performed worse than many rivals during the COVID-19 pandemic, but sales had been steadily declining even before that, with revenue falling five years in a row.

Elsewhere in the footwear industry, strong sales and the prospect of future earnings drove a flurry of purchases this year, creating a flock of new billionaires.

Exor—the holding company owned by the Italian business mogul Agnelli family—bought a 24% stake in Christian Louboutin for $1.2 billion in March, while Birkenstock was acquired by L Catterton for an eye-watering $4 billion in February.

Cult British footwear firm Dr. Martens floated stock on the London Stock Exchange in January giving it a valuation of $3.7 billion.

Luxury goods in general have had a good period during the pandemic, with LVMH last week revealing a surge in revenue in the first quarter, surpassing pre-pandemic numbers backed by strong demand in Asia and the U.S. Sales in Europe were still down owing to the lack of tourist footfall and continued lockdowns.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9389445185661316}",neutral,0.9389445185661316,0

Growth is probably the most important factor in the valuation of a company. GuruFocus research has found that growth is closely correlated with the long term performance of a company's stock. The faster a company is growing, the more likely it is to be creating value for shareholders, especially if the growth is profitable. The 3-year average annual revenue growth rate of LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE is 1.6%, which ranks in the middle range of the companies in the industry of Retail - Cyclical. The 3-year average EBITDA growth rate is 9.1%, which ranks in the middle range of the companies in the industry of Retail - Cyclical.

Another method of determining the profitability of a company is to compare its return on invested capital to the weighted average cost of capital. Return on invested capital (ROIC) measures how well a company generates cash flow relative to the capital it has invested in its business. The weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is the rate that a company is expected to pay on average to all its security holders to finance its assets. When the ROIC is higher than the WACC, it implies the company is creating value for shareholders. For the past 12 months, LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE's return on invested capital is 6.45, and its cost of capital is 4.84.

LVMH Ups Stake in Tod's to 10% for Total of 74.5 Million Euros - WWD,"Thu, 22 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3dkLmNvbS9mZWF0dXJlL2x2bWgtdXBzLXRvZHMtc3Rha2UtMTAtZm9yLTc0LTUtbWlsbGlvbi1ldXJvcy0xMjM0ODA4MzU4L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"MILAN — LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton may have just revealed it wants to focus on its latest acquisition, U.S. jeweler Tiffany & Co., but late on Thursday evening, Diego Della Valle, chairman and chief executive officer of the Tod’s Group, revealed the French group had increased its stake in his company up to 10 percent.

Diego Della Valle & C S.r.l., a company controlled by the Italian entrepreneur, has entered into a sale and purchase agreement with Delphine S.A.S., a fully owned subsidiary of LVMH, for the sale of 2.25 million shares of Tod’s SpA, representing 6.8 percent of the capital. LVMH is a longtime investor in Tod’s, already owning 3.2 percent. The price per share is calculated at 33.10 euros, the average price of Tod’s shares over the 15 trading days preceding the signing, for a total of 74.5 million euros. The transaction will be executed on April 28.

As a result, Della Valle will own, directly and indirectly, 63.64 percent of Tod’s outstanding shares and LVMH will own 10 percent.

“The friendship with Diego Della Valle and his family goes back over 20 years, a relationship cemented by common human and professional values,” said LVMH chairman and CEO Bernard Arnault. “We are very happy to reinforce further this partnership.”

A “delighted” Della Valle echoed Arnault, saying that he and his family “share the values of luxury, quality and products appeal” with the French luxury tycoon. “This may represent an excellent reason to consider further opportunities to be taken in the future ahead,” he concluded cryptically.

Analysts have for quite some time speculated on a possible sale of the Tod’s Group, which — in addition to the Tod’s brand — includes Hogan, Fay and Roger Vivier, pointing to Arnault and LVMH as a possible buyer. Della Valle has repeatedly denied the company was for sale and has over time bought back shares with his brother Andrea.

Tod’s has been rejuvenating its offer, reaching out to Gen Z, most recently appointing digital entrepreneur Chiara Ferragni as a board member, focusing on digitalization and working on streamlining its wholesale distribution, but the company has been reporting sets of results that left analysts hoping for a turnaround.

Ferragni’s appointment caused Tod’s shares to spike 12.1 percent on April 9, meaning Arnault would have paid more for his most recent share purchase than earlier in April.

As reported, solid double-digit growth in Tod’s online business and in China in the fourth quarter failed to offset a fall in revenues for the full year at the group, which was impacted by the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.

In the 12 months ended Dec. 31, Tod’s reported a 30.4 percent decrease in preliminary sales, which amounted to 637.2 million euros, compared with 916 million euros in 2019.

Tod’s also revealed it had signed a credit agreement with a pool of banks, coordinated by Intesa Sanpaolo SpA with IMI Corporate and Investment Banking Division, for a maximum total of 500 million euros. The sustainability-linked loan has a five-year maturity and is structured in a term facility of 250 million euros and a revolving credit facility of an additional 250 million euros.

“We have further strengthened our capital structure, to be ready to evaluate any opportunities that the market can offer in times like this,” Della Valle said in January commenting year-end results.

There has been a brisk uptick in M&A deals in Italy, in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, in light of the generational shift and the need for companies to build mass and power. Earlier this week, Etro admitted it was open to consider partnerships as L Catterton was rumored to be eyeing the Italian brand. OTB buying Jil Sander and Moncler the Stone Island label are two recent examples.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.999984622001648}",neutral,0.999984622001648,0

"With a Whopping $17 Billion in Sales, LVMH’s First Quarter Revenues Increase 30% Over 2020 - Robb Report","Wed, 14 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vcm9iYnJlcG9ydC5jb20vc3R5bGUvbWVuc3dlYXIvbHZtaC1tYWRlLW5lYXJseS0xNy1iaWxsaW9uLTIwMjEtZmlyc3QtcXVhcnRlci0xMjM0NjA3NDcyL9IBZGh0dHBzOi8vcm9iYnJlcG9ydC5jb20vc3R5bGUvbWVuc3dlYXIvbHZtaC1tYWRlLW5lYXJseS0xNy1iaWxsaW9uLTIwMjEtZmlyc3QtcXVhcnRlci0xMjM0NjA3NDcyL2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Luxury’s biggest names are continuing to bounce back from pandemic-induced slumps with gusto. Shortly after Rolls-Royce posted its best quarter ever, LVMH’s stock has risen to record highs thanks to surging sales in the US and Asia, as well as a strong performance in the fashion and leather goods category.

The French conglomerate’s shares, which have soared around 20 percent since the start of 2021, were up by 2.7 percent in early session trading on Wednesday. This caused the stock of big-name luxury rivals Kering and Hermès to also spike.

The uptick comes after LVMH posted its eye-popping first-quarter revenues late yesterday. The figures well exceeded those achieved even before the global pandemic and subsequently prompted analysts to upgrade their growth estimates for the year. It also caused stocks to skyrocket.

Bernard Arnault’s luxury behemoth netted roughly $16.7 billion (€14 billion) in the first three months of 2021. That marks a 30 percent increase in organic revenue compared to the same period in 2020 and an 8 percent increase compared to 2019. Analysts had expected the first-quarter revenue to total $15 billion (€12.7 billion).

According to LVMH, fashion and leather goods fared particularly well in the year’s early months, achieving record levels of revenue with 52 percent growth year on year. This can be attributed to the enduring appeal of houses such as Christian Dior and Louis Vuitton.

It seems LVMH is experiencing the polar opposite of the “lipstick effect,” which posits that consumers are more likely to buy smaller luxury items, like lipstick, than big-ticket items during times of economic crisis. LVMH’s perfumes and cosmetics did indeed grow by 18 percent year on year, but they were outperformed by the watches and jewelry and fashion and leather goods categories that tend to comprise more expensive items.

WATCH

The group also stated that the United States and Asia enjoyed strong growth with each market up 23 percent and 86 percent year on year, respectively. The European market, meanwhile, is still largely affected by the Covid-19 crisis with store closures across several countries. As such, sales were down 9 percent compared to last year.

As for the rest of 2021, LVMH remains hopeful for more growth. “In a context that remains turbulent, LVMH is well-equipped to build upon the hoped-for recovery in 2021 and regain growth momentum for all its businesses,” the group said in a statement.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9999969005584717}",positive,0.9999969005584717,1

‘aura’ utilizes blockchain technology, which also enables the existence of cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, and NFTs. the system records various types of data, like financial ledger entries or records of transaction, in time-stamped blocks that are then stored online in a digital chain. these blocks are autonomously updated and data in any block cannot be altered in later time without altering all subsequent blocks. the platform is secure and reliable, and can provide benefits like proof of authenticity and ownership. however, its operation consumes vast amounts of energy, raising concerns about the environmental cost in further adopting blockchain technology.

LVMH, prada and cartier have come together in an unprecedented collaboration between competitors to address issues common to all luxury brands. ‘aura’ represents a single, innovative solution to shared challenges of communicating information on authenticity, responsible sourcing and sustainability in a secure, digital format. the objective is to provide consumers with a high level of transparency and traceability throughout the lifecycle of a product. the technology of ‘aura’ blockchain matches a product ID to a client ID, providing the infrastructure to enable consumers to access the history of a product and proof of its authenticity at every step of the value chain. image © LVMH

the ‘aura’ blockchain consortium is multi-nodal, private blockchain secured by consensys technology and microsoft. the platform is open to all luxury brands, not just the founders, and offers flexibility to support companies of varying sizes and adapt to individual needs. among LVMH maisons, hublot, bvlgari and louis vuitton are already active on the platform. hublot, for example, has launched a digital e-warranty, which is stored in the aura infrastructure and allows customers to verify the authenticity of their watch via a simple photo taken with a mobile phone.

‘the aura blockchain consortium is a great opportunity for our sector to strengthen our connection with customers by offering them simple solutions to get to know our products better,’ said LVMH managing director, toni belloni. ‘by joining forces with other luxury brands on this project, we are leading the way on transparency and traceability. I hope other prestigious players will join our alliance.’

although the benefits of blockchain are undeniable, the amounts of energy consumed for its operation raise concerns about whether its further adoption takes into account the environmental cost. ‘the “proof of work” system that bitcoin uses to validate transactions, for example, consumes vast amounts of computational power,’ writes investopedia editor luke conway in ‘blockchain explained’. ‘in the real world, the power from the millions of computers on the bitcoin network is close to what denmark consumes annually.’ similar to bitcoin but in a much smaller scale, ‘aura’ employs blockchain to store information in a way that cannot be changed, tampered with, or hacked. according to conway, solutions are beginning to arise with the use of alternative energy resources, such as solar or wind power.

How Diversity Leaders at Gap and LVMH Are 'Operationalizing Inclusion' - Yahoo Life,"Fri, 02 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnlhaG9vLmNvbS9saWZlc3R5bGUvZGl2ZXJzaXR5LWxlYWRlcnMtZ2FwLWx2bWgtb3BlcmF0aW9uYWxpemluZy0xMjAwMDQ5OTMuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"When Bahja Johnson, Gap Inc.’s head of customer belonging, reflects on the success stories she’s really proud of, she thinks of Banana Republic’s True Hues line.

“Rooted in redefining the word ‘nude,’” Johnson said, the collection offers camisoles, pumps and other basics in 11 skin tone-matching shades. Its debut in April 2019 marked the first time the Color Proud Council — a product inclusion initiative Johnson cofounded — worked hand-in-hand with one of Gap’s brands from the first sketch to the online and in-store launch, she said.

More from WWD

“We did not get it right the first time,” Johnson added. “We had some great learning opportunities…and to look at where we started to now where we are, I think just speaks to the fact that you can grow, you can iterate. You cannot be afraid to start, you have to get after this work; it is the business imperative, and you’re going to learn along the way.”

Johnson was speaking on a panel with diversity leaders from P&G Beauty and LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton to discuss how their companies have approached inclusivity.

We can sometimes be creating an environment that freezes people.

Corey Smith, LVMH’s vice president of diversity and inclusion for North America, divided the Louis Vuitton parent’s outlook into three parts. The first element, the people, encompasses how the group recruits and retains its workers, from minor considerations like job descriptions to ensuring employees want to remain part of the organization. The second component, the business, relates to “operationalizing inclusion,” Smith said, such that every voice is valued and heard and everyone feels like a part of the decision-making process. The final part, the brand, covers external components like marketing and ad campaigns.

“What we really want to do is empower people with the education and the awareness to be more inclusive in their thought process as they are going through the design aspects,” Smith said.

Lela Coffey, vice president of brands, North America, hair care and multicultural hair brands at P&G Beauty, also raised the importance of education and, in particular, giving employees a “safe space” to ask questions and learn. P&G, she said as an example, offers its sales people — many times white men — a “textured hair academy” so they can better understand their customers and how they feel about their hair.

“We can sometimes be creating an environment that freezes people,” Coffey said. “They’re so afraid of making a mistake, that they don’t act. You don’t want people to be in that space….People need to feel like they can experiment, that they can take that first step, so that we can get along the journey where we need to be.”

As the head of customer belonging, Johnson sees her work as more than just saying whether something looks good for Black History Month or Asian American and Pacific Islander Heritage Month. Instead, she too came back to the idea of education, of working with teams “to say ‘What questions do we need to ask to get a different result here?’”

“People always ask me, ‘What’s the goal for you in this work and in this role?’” Johnson said. “My goal actually would be to not even have a customer belong group because…the standard for the retail leader is that you design with inclusion in mind, point blank, period.”

Because LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE is significantly overvalued, the long-term return of its stock is likely to be much lower than its future business growth, which averaged 1.6% over the past three years and is estimated to grow 8.56% annually over the next three to five years.

Companies with poor financial strength offer investors a high risk of permanent capital loss.

Growth is probably the most important factor in the valuation of a company. GuruFocus research has found that growth is closely correlated with the long term stock performance of a company. A faster growing company creates more value for shareholders, especially if the growth is profitable. The 3-year average annual revenue growth of LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE is 1.6%, which ranks in the middle range of the companies in the industry of Retail - Cyclical. The 3-year average EBITDA growth rate is 9.1%, which ranks in the middle range of the companies in the industry of Retail - Cyclical.

Another way to look at the profitability of a company is to compare its return on invested capital and the weighted cost of capital. Return on invested capital (ROIC) measures how well a company generates cash flow relative to the capital it has invested in its business. The weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is the rate that a company is expected to pay on average to all its security holders to finance its assets. We want to have the return on invested capital higher than the weighted cost of capital. For the past 12 months, LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE's return on invested capital is 6.45, and its cost of capital is 4.87.

LVMH First Quarter 2021 Financial Result Report - HYPEBEAST,"Wed, 14 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vaHlwZWJlYXN0LmNvbS8yMDIxLzQvbHZtaC1maXJzdC1xdWFydGVyLTIwMjEtZmluYW5jaWFsLXJlc3VsdHMtdGVwb3J00gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"With optimistic end of year report for 2020 and a booming market cap, LVMH was poised for success in 2021; even with the sunny forecast, its investors will undoubtedly be pleased to hear just how cheery its first quarter results are. The conglomerate reported a 30 percent revenue rise over the first quarter of 2020 — recorded prior to the COVID-19 pandemic wreaking havoc across the world — and it even beat the results from Q1 2019 by eight percent.

As detailed in LVMH’s report for investors, the company enjoyed immense growth courtesy of its fashion portfolio, with Louis Vuitton and Dior proving key sales drivers, though CELINE, Fendi and Marc Jacobs all proved successful, if not profitable. The Business of Fashion notes two crucial elements of Louis Vuitton and Dior’s success: price hikes and unparalleled spending power.

Louis Vuitton, especially, boosted prices in 2020 to balance the effects of the pandemic, which still couldn’t fend off occasional revenue dips but did tap into the ceaseless demand for the brand’s bags and footwear.

The second factor — deep pockets — ties into LVMH’s ability to be everywhere at once, constantly reminding consumers of its wares. Louis Vuitton opened new stores, Dior hosted digital fashion shows and both kept dishing plenty of new product, maintaining a heavy presence on social media.

In the end, the strategy paid off, as LVMH’s fashion and leather goods sector reported 37 percent growth over Q1 2019 and 52 percent organic growth over Q1 2020. There are some caveats — perfumes and cosmetics dipped below Q1 ‘19 and watches and jewelry only grow by one percent, though each stood tall about Q1 ‘20 — but the takeaway is that the LVMH stable is in a very good place to conquer the rest of the year.

Tiffany & Co. is a particular bright spot for LVMH as the conglomerate touts big plans for the Alexandre Arnault-helmed company, putting it “under pressure to deliver short term results,” according to WWD.

In an call with investors, chief financial officer Jean-Jacques Guiony claimed that Tiffany’s revenue was approximately eight or nine percent higher than Q1 ‘19 (Tiffany also boosted prices in 2020). Guiony also revealed that Dior was LVMH’s only brand to beat out its fashion division’s average growth figures.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9999990463256836}",positive,0.9999990463256836,1
"Cartier, Prada Link Up with LVMH in Blockchain Alliance - The Business of Fashion","Tue, 20 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzb2ZmYXNoaW9uLmNvbS9uZXdzL25ld3MtYW5hbHlzaXMvY2FydGllci1wcmFkYS1saW5rLXVwLXdpdGgtbHZtaC1pbi1ibG9ja2NoYWluLWFsbGlhbmNlL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Richemont-owned Cartier, the world’s biggest jewellery brand, and Milanese fashion house Prada have joined the blockchain platform Aura, a product verification and tracing system launched by LVMH.

The companies’ “Blockchain Consortium” builds on technology the French luxury conglomerate first developed in 2019 with help from Microsoft and ConsenSys, and is a rare instance of the rival groups working in concert.

The shared platform, which the companies say will now be open for all luxury brands to join, issues unique codes for individual products that will allow consumers and sellers to access tamper-proof ledgers containing information about the item, including authenticity, ownership history, maintenance and the provenance of materials.

LVMH brands including Louis Vuitton, Bulgari and Hublot have taken the lead on rolling out the system since it was first announced two years ago. But consultations with Cartier and Prada have been going on behind-the-scenes since the project’s early phases with the aim of creating a shared system that could be tailored to the different segments and brands.

“It’s really important that there’s been a democratic process so we could create a governance structure and a standard that works for both smaller brands and big brands,” Timothy Iwata-Durie, Cartier’s global innovation officer and a member of the Aura board said. Brands will maintain control of their own data. “Competitively sensitive” information on clients and supply chains will not be exchanged among brands in the platform, the statement said.

The attempt to establish an industry-wide blockchain system comes amid exploding interest in secondhand fashion from environmentally conscious and price-sensitive consumers. Resale’s rise has spurred more brands to get involved in the space, with the likes of Stella McCartney, Gucci and Alexander McQueen all partnering on initiatives with second-hand marketplaces.

It’s a major shift for the luxury market, which has long held reservations about the impact second-hand sales could have on brand value. Chanel and The RealReal are still embroiled in a years-long legal dispute.

That’s raised the stakes for brands and platforms to be able to efficiently and unimpeachably verify the authenticity of shoes, handbags and jewellery long after they leave the store.

A shared system could also help brands accelerate progress on the traceability of materials. While components like gemstones, furs and exotic leather skins can increasingly be traced all the way back to the mines or farms they came from, tracking commodities like cotton and wool remains an elusive objective for most brands.

Not being able to guarantee that their wares weren’t made with cotton harvested by prison labourers in China’s Xinjiang region, for example, is a challenge proponents say more consistent use of blockchain in fashion’s supply chain could help prevent.

Executives from Cartier, Prada and LVMH will now share power equally at the partnership’s board level. The Aura Blockchain Consortium will be governed as a non-profit, with any eventual proceeds reinvested in efforts aimed at “enhancing customer relationships as well as brand protection.”

Alexandre Arnault Asks His Followers What LVMH Should Do With Tiffany - WWD,"Fri, 02 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3dkLmNvbS9mYXNoaW9uLW5ld3MvZmFzaGlvbi1zY29vcHMvdGlmZmFueS1jb2xsYWJvcmF0aW9ucy1sdm1oLWFybmF1bHQtMTIzNDc5MjYxMC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"FOCUS GROUP: Does Tiffany, now owned by LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, plan to do collaborations?

“Oh, we will,” Alexandre Arnault, executive vice president, product and communications at the American jeweler, said on his personal Instagram account, which boasts 117,000 followers.

On Thursday, Arnault posted a yellow Tiffany ring box (more on that later) with an invitation on the platform’s Stories feature to answer this question: “What would you like to see us do at Tiffany?”

There were 18 takers for this impromptu focus group, suggesting everything from dog leashes – “We have them!” he answered along with a pic of an adorable pooch – to teeth grills and custom rapper chains.

Collaborations were a key tactic Arnault employed at his previous job as chief executive of Rimowa, unfurling tie-ups with Supreme, Dior, Off-White and Anti Social Social Cub.

On Instagram, people suggested projects with artist Daniel Arshem, streetwear brand Aimé Leon Dore, Nike and Château d’Yquem, the elite dessert wine owned by LVMH.

“Sweet nectar,” Arnault mused in his reply. Of course someone suggested a Tiffany collaboration with Rimowa, to which Arnault retorted wryly: “I know a guy.”

Supreme and Rimowa’s collaboration. Courtesy

The playful exercise yielded some interesting brand lore, including that Andy Warhol painted Christmas cards for Tiffany in the 1960s, and that the jeweler has already been name-checked in a rap song, “Omertà” by Drake.

When someone suggested reviving Tiffany lamps, Arnault noted that was “the only piece of furniture Steve Jobs thought was good enough to have in his house” and posted a picture of Apple’s founder seated cross-legged on the floor next to a light fixture.

In any event, Arnault does not seem opposed to having Blackpink’s Rosé as a brand ambassador, or introducing non-fungible token.

Pressed to explain the yellow ring box that cued the discussion, Arnault responded “Tiffany yellow!” – feeding what was clearly an April Fool’s Day stunt.

"LVMH, Richemont and Prada Team Up for New Blockchain Venture Aimed at Tracing, Authenticating Luxury Goods - The Fashion Law","Wed, 21 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihwFodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGVmYXNoaW9ubGF3LmNvbS9sdm1oLXJpY2hlbW9udC1hbmQtcHJhZGEtdGVhbS11cC1mb3ItbmV3LWJsb2NrY2hhaW4tdmVudHVyZS1haW1lZC1hdC10cmFjaW5nLWF1dGhlbnRpY2F0aW5nLWx1eHVyeS1nb29kcy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"In May 2019, LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton made headlines when it announced that it was working on something big in the blockchain space. By way of a partnership with blockchain company ConsenSys and Microsoft, the Bernard Arnault-run luxury goods conglomerate teased the launch of Aura, a platform that it said would “serve the entire luxury industry with powerful product tracking and tracing services, based on Ethereum blockchain technology and utilizing Microsoft’s [cloud computing service] Azure.” At the time, LVMH was relatively tight-lipped about what – exactly – the project would entail and what the timeline behind it looked like.

While few hints were offered about the status of the project in the wake of the initial announcement, it turns out that it has very much been in the works behind the scenes. In the two years since LVMH’s revelation, the Paris-based group’s marquee brand Louis Vuitton has been quietly working to link a “very significant” number of new products to blockchain-hosted digital certificates of authenticity that exist alongside those physical goods and give consumers insight into the providence of the products. At the same time, in a nod to LVMH’s vow that it would make the system available to other industry entities (for a licensing fee), including those that do not fall under its sweeping ownership umbrella, Lorenzo Bertelli, head of marketing and corporate social responsibility at Prada Group, told WWD this week that Prada is using LVMH’s technology, and has “been readying for the Aura blockchain by embedding radio-frequency identification – or RFID – chips into ‘millions’ of products, which began reaching stores in the second half of 2020.”

“To thwart counterfeiting, suppliers and manufacturers can join a single blockchain platform and use ‘smart tags’ (i.e., unique cryptographic identifiers) to track and confirm the provenance and location of each item,” BCG explained in a 2019 report exploring the applications of blockchain and the Internet of Things (“IoT”) in the context of the counterfeit market. The tags, which can “capture the complete genealogy of a product and are hard to replicate,” the consultancy asserts, come in “a variety of forms, including security labels with unique QR codes, RFID, and digital tags that contain an individualized software component.” It notes that “counterfeit tags will not show up on the blockchain, for instance, and if a smart tag is somehow duplicated, a quick scan of the blockchain will indicate when and where the genuine item was manufactured and sold, thus revealing the duplicate item as a fake.”

Not to be outdone, Swiss conglomerate Compagnie Financière Richemont – which owns Cartier, Vacheron Constantin, Piaget, and Van Cleefs and Arpels, among other hard luxury brands – has also signed onto what is being called the Aura Blockchain Consortium in furtherance of its existing quest to equip its products, namely, its high-end timepieces, with digital certificates of authenticity. (Richemont maintains a partnership with Arianee, an Ethereum-based project, that aims to aid in a more seamless resale market by way of its “NFT digital passports for luxury goods,” which go so far as to digitize service history and repairs).

As for how the Aura system works, LVMH previously stated that newly-made products will be “recorded on the shared [blockchain] ledger, irreproducible and containing unique [product] information.” At the time of purchase, consumers will be given access to the individual Aura certificate – or certificates – for the goods they buy, and thereby, granted access to all information associated with those goods. At initial sale, this information, including “responsible sourcing and sustainability” stats, may be compelling in that it will allow consumers to see where the products were made. (It is easy to be at least a bit skeptical about how precise brands will be in this regard given the appeal of designations like “Made in France” and “Made in Italy” and given the fact that various national labeling laws enable brands to legally go without mentioning when products are manufactured in part in traditionally less “luxurious” locales outside of the final finishing factories on their home turf, as is often the case).

The use of an industry-wide blockchain that securely holds information about luxury goods would “increase customer trust in the brands’ sustainable practices and product sourcing,” LVMH, Richemont, and Prada claimed in a joint statement on Tuesday.

More compelling, of course, will be how these blockchain-based records will apply in a post-initial-sale capacity. The immutable information written into individual products’ ledgers will, at least in theory, not only verify authenticity of a product, but will securely track changes in ownership, and thus, the technology could make it possible for consumers to access the product history and corresponding proof of authenticity of luxury goods downstream and over time. In the counterfeit-filled resale market, where issues of authenticity are pressing (partially as a result of many brands’ unwillingness to partner with resale companies and verify authenticity), the ability to trace the provenance of a product could prove a significant advantage for resale companies and consumers, alike, especially as the value of the luxury resale market continues to climb seemingly unabated.

At the same time, brands may be able to take advantage of such traceability and ensure that products are, in fact, legitimate after the initial point of sale. This will be increasingly relevant as a growing number of circularity-minded brands offer up repair services to their customers (something that Hermès, for instance, has been doing for a while) and/or launch buy-back and resell programs of their own in order to exert more control over the booming resale market and to capitalize on their pre-owned goods, as opposed to losing out in this revenue stream to third parties.

And even more fundamentally, BCG says that “manufacturers and suppliers can use the blockchain platform to authenticate items, flag deviations from agreed-upon sourcing arrangements, and prevent defective and inferior components from entering the production system.” With that in mind, digitizing and storing the identification and authenticity information associated with a luxury product, as opposed to relying exclusively on physical authenticity cards or records, would prove compelling for brands given that largescale theft of “it” accessories and/or authenticity cards, alone, is not unheard of. Chanel, for instance, revealed in connection with a currently ongoing lawsuit that one of its authorized factories was robbed in 2012, and the thieves got away with authenticity cards, which were then paired with counterfeit bags and sold.

While the scale of the benefits of such provenance-tracing ventures “varies across businesses” and industries, BCG found that generally speaking, “blockchain with IoT could be a source of significant financial and competitive advantage for many.” This is likely to be especially true for luxury goods brands, which routinely invest significant time and resources “tracking [product] parts, validating provenance, communicating with partners, and filling out copious documentation to ensure the authenticity of their products and to protect customers” and their valuable brand images, all while operating against the background of a counterfeit industry that is worth an estimated $4.5 trillion per year, some 60 to 70 percent of which is tied directly to sales of fake luxury goods.

As for what the collaboration means in the highly competitive upper echelon of the luxury sphere, LVMH Managing Director Antonio Belloni said that fight against counterfeiting is one area where it makes sense for brands to work together and share resources as opposed to developing individual technologies. He confirmed that Aura has had discussions with Gucci-owner Kering, but did not elaborate. As for LVMH, he said that Louis Vuitton, Bulgari and Hublot have made use of the Aura the technology, and the newly-acquired Tiffany & Co. is the next “obvious” brand to give it a go.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999805688858032}",neutral,0.9999805688858032,0

Nona Source wants to offer emerging creatives and brands in Europe access to high-quality fabrics and leathers at competitive prices to encourage the re-use of materials.



Created by three sourcing and digitization experts from LVMH (Marie Falguera, Romain Brabo and Anne Prieur du Perray) Nona Source is a startup incubated by LVMH’s DARE entrepreneurial program (Disrupt, Act, Risk to be an Entrepreneur) to support LVMH’s environmental strategy by rethinking sourcing and supporting the circular economy.



The trio designed a platform to re-use deadstocks, the “sleeping beauties” stored in the warehouses of LVMH Fashion & Leather Goods Houses. Because stocks are located in France, the platform will for the time being deliver within Europe (including the United Kingdom).



The Nona Source catalogue proposes a variety of materials, from lace to leathers in different compositions, weights, colors and patterns (only exclusive patterns or branded fabrics are not available).

French luxury conglomerate LVMH is expected to set up its largest e-commerce sales and storage hub for cosmetics in the Asia-Pacific region in Shanghai, underscoring the confidence of the luxury brand in the Chinese market to achieve a rebound in revenue from the pandemic-hit business.The hub will be located in the Xinzhuang Industrial Zone, Minhang District, Shanghai and is currently under construction, a company source told the Global Times on Saturday.According to a new media outlet affiliated with Minhang District, the project covers an area 90,000 square meters, with an estimated investment of nearly 1 billion yuan ($154 million). Construction will take 18 months, and will operate by the end of 2022.It will serve as the LVMH group's e-commerce packaging sorting and sales base, serve the group's high-end cosmetics and perfume business platform, and integrate the business network from e-business terminal, merchandise storage and sorting and packaging to the shipping and logistics system.In 2020, the Asia market, excluding Japan, accounted for 45 percent of LVMH Group's perfumes and cosmetics sales, according to the company's annual report, making it the largest regional market for these categories. The China market for its quick economic rebound from the pandemic played a key role in the growth of brands owned by LVMH, according to the company's annual report.The company said in its annual report that Parfums Christian Dior improved gradually in the second half of 2020, with a notable acceleration in the fourth quarter, especially in China. Its cosmetic brand Fresh has developed digital marketing campaigns and its online sales, particularly in China, the report said.China's share of the world luxury goods market nearly doubled last year, growing from about 11 percent in 2019 to 20 percent in 2020, while the global luxury market declining at an expected rate of 23 percent in 2020, according to a report issued by global management consulting firm Bain & Company.It is predicted that China is on track to become the biggest luxury market by 2025 and e-commerce as the biggest channel for luxury spending globally by 2025, according to the consulting firm.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9965367317199707}",positive,0.9965367317199707,1

“Those of you who know me know that I’m a bit of a specialist in circular economy — at any rate, that I believe strongly in this new economic model — and we are applying it and interpreting it in a very specific manner,” said Hélène Valade, group environmental development director at LVMH.

She noted that this emphasis on circular economy, applied to the luxury industry, allows for an inventive approach to materials.

It starts with the conception of products, and choosing the materials to make them, she explained, citing materials that have been recycled or come from regenerative agriculture as examples.

“There is a lot of innovation in this field of eco-design,” she said.

As part of a series of targets unveiled Thursday as part of its so-called “Life 360” program, the group plans for all of its new products, by 2030, to come from eco-design — which it described as being produced with a minimal environmental footprint from the extraction of materials to their transformation.

Luxury groups have stressed the longevity of their products to shore up their environmental credentials, and Valade expanded on this, noting plans to bulk up services for clients like repair and polishing, as well as upcycling and recycling precious materials like leather and fur.

“What is driving us, it’s not secondhand but it’s a second life for our products, both for our clients and for us,” she added.

Offering examples of the group’s approach, the executive cited upcycled pieces from luxury brands in the group, like upcycled sneakers designed by Virgil Abloh for Louis Vuitton’s spring collection, and a woven leather handbag from Loewe made from leather scraps.

“It’s a new type of luxury that we would like to see emerge, a cleaner form of luxury that’s less about abundance, and that has a different relationship with time and nature,” explained the executive.

Packaging is another area the group addressed Thursday, pledging not to use any plastic that is not recycled by 2026.

The group also said it would beef up efforts in the area of transparency.

“Traceability is absolutely crucial, at the same time it’s extremely complex,” she said.

The executive defined the term as offering a view on the entire value chain of primary materials — “from the field to the store” — she said, noting that the stakes are different when it comes to leather or grapes. The group aims for all products to come with a system to provide information for clients by 2026. By 2030, the group pledges to have a specific traceability system for each type of primary material, using technology like blockchain.

“This will allow us to devise systems for providing information to all of our clients — we are quite advanced but we’d like to reinforce transparency,” she said, citing Guerlain’s Bee Respect platform, and a scan system at Patou whereby a QR code links to information about the makeup of an item of clothing.

“This is a direction that will be reinforced even more through Life 360,” said Valade.

The group said through its Life 2020 program, it has increased the proportion of renewable energy use in the group to 40 percent, reduced energy consumption of its stores by 31 percent, and recast packaging, with an enveloping film on Ruinart Champagne bottles for example. In terms of sourcing, the bulk of diamonds and gold used by the group are certified by the Responsible Jewellery Council.

When it comes to the climate, the group, which has calculated its carbon footprint at 4.8 million tons of CO2 equivalent, seeks to reduce greenhouse gases by 50 percent by 2026, compared to a baseline from 2019, by using renewable energy, and cutting scope 3 emissions by roughly half in the next 10 years.

Asked why objectives were set at time frames of three, six and 10 years, Valade noted that it was important to have various meeting points to concentrate on different subjects at specific times.

“The crisis has affected our relationship to time, and there are some subjects we felt we absolutely needed to speed up — 2023 seemed like an important date,” she said.

Meanwhile, some objectives call for a longer period, she added.

Asked about the environmental impact of physical fashion shows versus digital presentations, the executive said that, along with the Fédération de la Haute Couture et de la Mode, they are working on calculating the impact of the various formats.

“What is clear is that digital shows have a real environmental impact, so this will have to be compared in a very rigorous manner because we can’t say that digital fashion weeks don’t have an impact, we need to be able to evaluate the proportion compared to a traditional fashion week and we’ll happily debate it then,” she said.

She added that the economic contribution to the local economy, and the fashion ecosystem also needed to be taken into account, noticing that fashion week events serve to help young designers boost their notoriety.

“Our approach to fashion week is to consider it in function of its contribution to the environment, the economy, to culture, too, of the place where the fashion week is happening. This seems very important to us — that’s why it’s a subject we’re working on extensively,” said Valade.

Valade said LVMH was working to reinforce sharing environmental innovations between brands of the group, through working groups on subjects like regenerative agriculture and packaging.

“Innovation is shared, and we are doing everything we can to reinforce sharing,” she said.

“LVMH serves as magnificent grounds for a circular economy,” she said, citing a start-up that has emerged from an internal program called Dare that has resulted in a platform for a brand’s unused fabrics to be purchased by another label, set to be revealed at the end of the month.

Asked if the group could get involved in the secondhand market, Valade emphasized a focus on making the group’s products last.

“What makes sense to us is to push the durability to the extreme, with services to give our products and materials a second life, with upcycling, and relooking some of our pieces, either directly by our creative directors or because clients bring back objects that we give a second life to,” she said.

“Luxury is like a sphinx that is constantly being reborn, that is in this movement of perpetual reinvention, at the service of something that lasts and is a bit eternal,” added the executive.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999464750289917}",neutral,0.9999464750289917,0

LVMH Has Partnered with a Deadstock Startup to Offer Up its Brands' Excess Textiles - The Fashion Law,"Mon, 26 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWZhc2hpb25sYXcuY29tL2x2bWgtaGFzLXBhcnRuZXJlZC13aXRoLWEtZGVhZHN0b2NrLXN0YXJ0dXAtdG8tb2ZmZXItdXAtaXRzLWJyYW5kcy1leGNlc3MtdGV4dGlsZXMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LVMH is getting into the resale business – albeit not by way of pre-owned garments and accessories but in the form of deadstock materials from its roster of luxury brands. In a statement on Monday, the Paris-based conglomerate announced the launch of Nona Source, “the first online resale platform for ‘re-sourcing’ exceptional materials” – which will make “high-quality fabrics and leathers in different compositions, weights, colors and patterns” that have been “stored in the warehouses of exclusive LVMH Fashion & Leather Goods Houses” – available for sale to “emerging creatives and brands in Europe at competitive prices to encourage creative re-use of materials.”

The brainchild of co-founders Marie Falguera and Romain Brabo, who were selected to join LVMH’s DARE startup incubator, and who have since been joined by former LVMH finance and digital transformation director Anne Prieur du Perray, Nona Source offers up a digital catalogue for fashion companies, complete with “a wide variety of prestigious materials” – from Harwick Watersnake skins and Shetland Wools to Natural Linens and Silk Crepes. The “game-changing platform” provides a “concrete solution to address the challenges and opportunities of circularity, a key pillar of LVMH’s environmental strategy,” according to the luxury goods giant. As of now, the business-to-business platform, which offers up “carefully selected materials that are re-valued at competitive prices,” has more than 165,000 years of the finest fabrics, enough to make 75,000 new garments.

Reflecting on the project, Romain Brabo, who previously served as a materials buyer at LVMH-owned brand Givenchy, said that in the course of his employment, he saw the process of warehousing excess textiles, and wanted to find a way to “collect the materials, evaluate them, and unlock their value [by] making them available via a platform” like Nona Source. Marie Falguera, who was the materials development manager at LVMH-owned Kenzo before launching Nona Source, echoed this sentiment, asserting that she and Brabo wanted to “revolutionize sourcing,” something that is difficult to translate to a digital experience given the “touch and feel” element associated with the selection of fabrics.

“At the end of a production cycle, Maisons’ fabrics and leathers become unused excess stocks, which [are stored] in warehouses,” Falguera observed in connection with her work, and ultimately, “are devalued and sold to discounters.” Amid the rise of a new generation of designers that are approaching fashion more sustainably, with many seeking to use deadstock fabrics, she says that “access to these materials can be difficult and [the process] often lacks transparency.” This gave way to the creation of Nona Source, which is “a perfect example of the new ambition that the Group will be supporting” as part of its new LIFE 360 environmental performance roadmap, Hélène Valade, director of Environmental Development at LVMH, says of the budding young re-sourcing startup.

While Nona Source does not specify which LVMH-owned brands the various textiles come from, LVMH does, of course, assert in its announcement that “exclusive patterns [and] branded fabrics,” i.e., materials that bear copyright and/or trademark-protected patterns or marks – “are not available” via the Nona Source site.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999682903289795}",neutral,0.9999682903289795,0

Announced on Tuesday, the Aura Blockchain Consortium hopes to leverage blockchain technology to create a global, digital ledger that registers all their products, providing a trusted database against that they can be authenticated and tracked. It builds on technology developed by LVMH with help from Microsoft and ConsenSys back in 2019.

Since blockchains are decentralized and virtually impossible to alter, the shared platform – which the companies say will now be open for all luxury brands to join – issues unique codes for individual products. The code will allow consumers and sellers to track everything from the item's authenticity, warranty, ownership history, and maintenance, to the environmental impact it has.

A luxury blockchain could also be a game-changer for the ethical traceability of materials. While components like gemstones, furs, and exotic leather skins can increasingly be traced all the way back to the mines or farms they came from, tracking commodities like cotton and wool is much harder. This could bring much-needed accountability into the fashion supply chain.

While the technology is impressive, it's also unprecedented to see rival groups working together on a shared system on this scale. LVMH brands such as Louis Vuitton, Bulgari, and Hublot have been leading the system rollout since it was first announced two years ago, however, Cartier and Prada's joining sets the stage for more brands and retailers to have a seat at the table.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.6056076884269714}",positive,0.6056076884269714,1
LVMH Boss Bernard Arnault 'Reasonably Optimistic' About 2021 - WWD,"Thu, 15 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3dkLmNvbS9mZWF0dXJlL2x2bWgtYm9zcy1iZXJuYXJkLWFybmF1bHQtb3B0aW1pc3RpYy1vdXRsb29rLTIwMjEtMTIzNDgwMjA3MS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS — Bernard Arnault, chairman and chief executive officer of LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, said Thursday he was feeling “reasonably optimistic” about the outlook for 2021, as global vaccination campaigns herald the end of the coronavirus pandemic.

Speaking at the company’s annual general meeting, which was held online for the second consecutive year after France entered its third nationwide lockdown in a bid to curb the spread of COVID-19, the French billionaire said that his luxury conglomerate emerged from the crisis stronger.

Reflecting investor confidence, LVMH’s market capitalization this week crossed the threshold of 300 billion euros, having tripled since 2017. The share price rose to a record high on Wednesday after the company reported that revenues jumped 32 percent in the first quarter, fueled by its key fashion and leather goods division, which saw sales soar 52 percent year-on-year.

“Even if the future is uncertain with regard to the pandemic, one can be reasonably optimistic. The hope of vaccination allows us to contemplate an end to this health crisis, and I’m convinced that LVMH is in an excellent position to build on the recovery the world is hoping for in 2021 to further reinforce our leadership in the global market of high-quality products,” he said.

Arnault said he was guided throughout the crisis by the motto of World War II French army general Jean de Lattre de Tassigny: “ne pas subir,” which translates roughly as “never give in.”

“I wanted to transmit this spirit of resistance against fate to the entire group. A year on, I can say proudly that LVMH has proved remarkably resistant,” he said.

“Crises make us stronger. Our houses have been through a number of them over the last decades, and they always teach us valuable lessons that provide a powerful foundation for the years of growth that follow. As we have done before, we will successfully transform the current challenge into success,” Arnault added.

Questions submitted online by shareholders ranged from the impact of this month’s frosts in France, which have ravaged the nation’s wine industry, to the integration of Tiffany & Co., after LVMH in January completed its $15.8 billion acquisition of the U.S. jeweler, the largest deal in the history of the luxury sector.

Putting last year’s bitter legal wrangles with Tiffany behind him, Arnault reiterated his confidence in the brand. “It’s an American icon. It’s a brand synonymous with love, whose famous blue box is recognized the world over. I’m convinced that we will make it shine even more,” he said.

Antonio Belloni, group managing director of LVMH, said it was too early to evaluate the impact of the weather disaster on the company’s Champagne brands, though he noted the sector was somewhat protected from annual variations because most Champagne is made by blending wines from different years.

In response to a now-annual question from animal rights organization People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, Belloni reiterated that LVMH has no plans to stop using fur and exotic skins, provided they are responsibly sourced. “We believe in freedom of choice, both for our customers and for our houses,” he said.

He added that LVMH was also exploring the production of vegetable leather alternatives such as cactus leather produced by start-up Desserto, one of the finalists for the LVMH Innovation Award last year.

Belloni declined to give a definitive opening date for La Samaritaine. The department store was originally due to open in April 2020 after being closed for 15 years, and will now open gradually beginning this summer, Belloni said.

The French luxury giant, whose market capitalization reached 300 billion euros this week, tops the 2021 ranking conceived by Universum, an employer branding firm based in Stockholm that surveyed more than 50,000 students and asked them to identify their most ideal employers from a provided list of 130 firms.

LVMH has held the number-one spot for 16 years running, and French beauty giant L’Oréal has been in second place since 2018, when it dethroned Google. Breaking into the top-three this year is Chanel, which bumped Google down to fourth place. Apple remains at number five.

Other fashion, retail and beauty firms in the top 100 include Amazon, ranked 17th; Groupe Galeries Lafayette, ranked 22nd; Decathlon, ranked 25th; Printemps, ranked 29th; Kering, 31st; Compagnie Financière Richemont, 51st; Unilever, 52nd: Proctor & Gamble, 59th; Carrefour, 56th, and Veepee, previously Vente-Privée, ranked 76th.

Reflecting the impact of the pandemic, companies in the hospitality and aviation sectors slipped in the 2021 ranking, while supermarkets gained favor.

The top priority for business students in choosing their ideal employer is high earning potential, bumping challenging work to second place in the 2021 study.

Only 22 percent of those surveyed preferred to work for start-ups, with 78 percent of students wishing to get hired by established businesses.

From 3 May, the world leader in luxury goods, LVMH, will see a reorganisation of its legal department. This change comes after the withdrawal of Bernard Kuhn, who was legal director for thirty years and now retains his role as secretary to the group’s board of directors. As a result, Caroline Bergeron Plantefève has been appointed Group Legal Director and Jérôme Sibille Director of General Administration and Legal Affairs.

Caroline Bergeron Plantefève is currently Deputy General Counsel. She is a graduate of IEP Paris, HEC and holds a postgraduate degree in international taxation.

Elle a fait ses débuts en tant qu’avocate au sein du cabinet Siméon & Associés en 1994, elle exerce d’abord en tant que juriste en droit des affaires, avant de devenir responsable du pôle corporate finance en 2001.

She then joined the legal department of LVMH in 1996. She worked on all issues related to the development of the group such as M&A, private equity, financial law, competition law, contracts, real estate and new technologies ed-nederland.com. She worked in interaction with the group’s financial management, the strategy department and the general management.

Jérôme Sibille holds a DESS-DJCE from the University of Nancy and a DEA from the University of Paris La Sorbonne. He began his career as a lawyer with Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer in Paris, before joining Davis Polk & Wardwell. He has also taught at the University of Nancy and Paris Dauphine.

A member of the Paris Bar, he specialises in mergers and acquisitions and related litigation.

Jérôme Sibille will report directly to Bernard Arnault and will oversee all legal matters with Caroline Bergeron-Plantefève, who reports to him in her new role as General Counsel.

He will be responsible for the various legal, corporate and business, ethics and compliance, and personal and asset security departments, for example. He or she will manage these different divisions at the level of the group and its companies and will also be involved in the company’s strategic issues, particularly those relating to its development.

LVMH launches luxury deadstock resale site—making good on the fashion industry's past mistakes - Yahoo Finance,"Tue, 27 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9sdm1oLWxhdW5jaGVzLWx1eHVyeS1kZWFkc3RvY2stcmVzYWxlLTE2MzEyMjM2Ni5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Luxury goods conglomerate LVMH is launching an online market platform to sell off its deadstock high-end fabrics instead of letting them pile up in warehouses, or worse, having them destroyed.

The new online marketplace called Nona Source will re-sell fabrics and leathers that were once carefully selected by designers working at one of the many fashions houses owned under the LVMH brand.

The fabrics could come from any of the LVMH-owned brands, including Louis Vuitton, Christian Dior, Fendi, Givenchy, Celine, Loewe, and Marc Jacobs.

All materials on sale will be certified LVMH Maisons’ deadstock and will be sold at around 70% of the original wholesale price.

Grassroot idea

The idea began from inventory managers working at Givenchy and Kenzo and was brought to LVMH’s DARE program which is a platform within the company that allows workers to propose ideas that promote a more circular fashion economy.

Unused fabric costs the industry $120 billion per year, according to online deadstock marketplace Queen of Raw, who note wasted fabrics either end up burned or buried.

However, the new market place is careful not to sell any LVMH exclusive patterns or branded fabrics so as not to devalue its brands.

LVMH is a hugely profitable business and is doing well even despite the drop in footfall at its stores.

LVMH was in hot water previously about its disposal of excess clothes to ensure they were not reused or sold on. The firm was not the only one to do this. Upmarket British fashion label Burberry burned its unsold clothes, accessories and perfume worth £28.6m in 2018 to protect its brand. LVMH rival Richemont, which owns jewelry and watch brands Cartier, Piaget, and Baume & Mercier, admitted in May 2018 that in an effort to keep its products out of the hands of unauthorized sellers, it had destroyed about $563 million worth of watches.

The recovery hasn’t happened everywhere though. Sales in Asia may be taking off, and business in the US is bouncing back strong, but in Europe, home to these giants and the cradle of the modern luxury fashion industry, the struggles continue.

At Hermès, sales in Europe were down 4.4% (pdf) versus last year. LVMH reported a 9% decline (pdf), and Kering registered a 34% drop (pdf).

Through the end of March, new cases of Covid-19 spiked in the region, where the rollout of vaccines has been “unacceptably slow,” according to the World Health Organization. Luxury sellers are still contending with numerous store closures.

On top of that, tourist traffic has vanished and seems unlikely to rush back anytime soon. It’s had a noticeable effect on luxury shops, which do a significant share of their sales to traveling shoppers from countries such as China and the US. With tourism to Europe still on pause, these shoppers are making their purchases closer to home, contributing to the uneven sales across regions.

Even before the pandemic, Europe’s fashion houses were growing increasingly reliant on China for their sales. The past year has only accelerated the trend.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9854426383972168}",positive,0.9854426383972168,1

LVMH reported sales of US$16.7 billion (€13.96 billion) in the first quarter, an increase of 30 per cent on an organic basis from the same period a year ago when the coronavirus pandemic triggered the first lockdowns and store closures. The revenue even exceeded 2019 levels, before anyone heard of COVID-19, by eight per cent.

If the trends in the first quarter continue, LVMH, whose Chair and CEO is billionaire Bernard Arnault, is on track for its annual revenue to exceed pre-pandemic levels this year. Fashion and leather goods, which account for nearly half of the company’s revenues, achieved record levels of revenue. The US and Asia experienced strong growth, while Europe is still suffering badly from the pandemic due to continual store closures across several countries and the lack of tourism. Sales in Asia, excluding Japan, were up 86 per cent from a year ago, and rose around 23 per cent in the US.

“The Fashion & Leather Goods business group achieved organic revenue growth of 52 per cent in the first quarter of 2021 compared to the same period of 2020 and 37 per cent compared to that of 2019,” LVMH said in a statement.

“Louis Vuitton, driven by its strong creativity, enjoyed a remarkable performance. The timelessly elegant Capucines bag was showcased and several innovations were unveiled during the runway shows. In Japan, Louis Vuitton reopened its historic flagship store in the Ginza district of Tokyo following extensive renovation work.

“Christian Dior enjoyed an excellent start to the year. The Lady Dior bag continued to be very successful and the new ready-to-wear collections have had an excellent reception. Fendi unveiled the first collections by Kim Jones. Loro Piana presented its new collections. Celine had great success with the creations of Hedi Slimane. Loewe continued its very successful expansion of the lines created by J W Anderson. Marc Jacobs performed very well.”

The watches and jewellery division recorded organic revenue growth of 35 per cent in the first quarter of 2021 compared to the same period of 2020 and one per cent compared to the same period in 2019. The quarter also marked the integration of the iconic Tiffany & Co brand for the first time, which “saw an excellent start to the year”, LVMH said.

Several innovations were unveiled at other brands during the quarter, including the Serpenti Viper collection by Bulgari, the new Joséphine creations by Chaumet and the Pretty Woman collection by Fred. In watchmaking, TAG Heuer announced a major collaboration with Porsche, including launching the TAG Heuer Carrera Porsche Chronograph.

LVMH finished the US$15.8 billion acquisition of Tiffany in early January after a legal battle.

Investors have warmed to the future of the sector. LVMH shares have risen 52 per cent since the end of the second quarter, while smaller rivals Richemont and Kering have grown by 54 per cent and 30 per cent, respectively.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 1.0}",positive,1.0,1

Following an increasingly prevalent trend in the luxury industry since the start of the pandemic, LVMH has again prioritized internal recruitment, choosing to value the rich experience and skills of 49-year-old Motte, a former student of École Centrale Paris, who holds a Masters in Economics from the University of Cambridge and an MBA from France's Insead.

Is China’s luxury market really ‘Covid-proof’? - Style,"Sat, 17 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjbXAuY29tL21hZ2F6aW5lcy9zdHlsZS9uZXdzLXRyZW5kcy9hcnRpY2xlLzMxMjk4NjUvY2hpbmFzLWx1eHVyeS1tYXJrZXQtcmVhbGx5LWNvdmlkLXByb29mLWNoaW5lc2UtZGVtYW5k0gF3aHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAuc2NtcC5jb20vbWFnYXppbmVzL3N0eWxlL25ld3MtdHJlbmRzL2FydGljbGUvMzEyOTg2NS9jaGluYXMtbHV4dXJ5LW1hcmtldC1yZWFsbHktY292aWQtcHJvb2YtY2hpbmVzZS1kZW1hbmQ?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The 750 guests lined the catwalk to watch models strutting to disco tunes, one in a sequin jumpsuit, another in a bright pink dress, as creative director Maria Grazia Chiuri’s collection was live-streamed around the world. Those inside weren’t even wearing masks.

If evidence were needed of how far China has moved beyond the pandemic, perhaps the strongest was the scene at Christian Dior’s autumn fashion show earlier this week, hosted at an art museum in Shanghai.

Asia has been a lifeline for luxury companies like Dior parent LVMH , thanks to its quick exit from the strictest lockdowns that have bogged down Europe and the US. As the first of the major fashion houses to report first-quarter results, LVMH posted sales growth on Tuesday, April 13, that smashed analysts’ estimates, driven largely by demand from the region.

That suggests more good news to come from fashion houses, even if growth varies widely across regions, brands and product categories. After recovering from a steep downturn in 2020, luxury is benefiting in particular from the appetite among millennial and Gen Z Asian shoppers for high-end shoes and handbags.

And those shoppers are increasingly spending their money at home and online , rather than travelling to the expensive luxury emporiums of Paris and Milan as they would have done pre-pandemic.

“It does seem this sector is Covid-proof,” said Andrew Shipilov, professor of strategy at French business school Insead. Luxury is “still the sector that people spend money on when they cannot spend on travel – it’s one of the winners” of the pandemic era.

The luxury goods market in China grew 48 per cent last year as travel disruptions boosted domestic spending, according to a December report from Bain & Co. The consultancy expects this growth will forge ahead, putting the country on track to claim the biggest share of the market by 2025.

“The Chinese are already the first nationality buying luxury goods and will be the first engine for this market going forward,” said Federica Levato, partner at Bain.

LVMH, which also owns Louis Vuitton, derived almost half of its revenue from Asia in the first quarter, and sales from the region excluding Japan surged a staggering 86 per cent on an organic basis. That was followed by the US, which grew 23 per cent. Sales were still down in Europe, where countries are struggling to control renewed virus outbreaks.

Shares of LVMH rose as much as 3.2 per cent on Wednesday, April 14. The gain increased the company’s market value by about 8 billion euros to 308 billion euros (US$9.6 billion to US$369 billion), making it Europe’s largest company by that measure. That has in turn catapulted founder Bernard Arnault to become the fourth-richest person in the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, worth US$135 billion, just behind Bill Gates.

Shares of luxury rivals Hermès International and Gucci owner Kering SA also rose. They report first-quarter sales on April 20 and 22, respectively.

With catwalks having gone virtual for most of the past year in the dominant fashion capitals like Paris or Milan, Dior and Louis Vuitton tried to entice customers by showcasing collections through Instagram and other platforms. At LVMH’s largest unit, fashion and leather goods, revenue surged 52 per cent in the first quarter.

“The appetite of the Asian customer is driven partially by their inability to travel to Europe,” Shipilov said. “They still want to signal their love for luxury and their appreciation for European cultural heritage; this is how they’re trying to stand out.”

‘The Chinese never stopped buying’: Bulgari CEO on future of luxury - South China Morning Post,"Fri, 09 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjbXAuY29tL2xpZmVzdHlsZS9mYXNoaW9uLWJlYXV0eS9hcnRpY2xlLzMxMjg0MjkvYnVsZ2FyaS1jZW8tYnV5aW5nLWpld2VsbGVyeS1vbmxpbmUtbHZtaHMtdGlmZmFueS1kZWFs0gF0aHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAuc2NtcC5jb20vbGlmZXN0eWxlL2Zhc2hpb24tYmVhdXR5L2FydGljbGUvMzEyODQyOS9idWxnYXJpLWNlby1idXlpbmctamV3ZWxsZXJ5LW9ubGluZS1sdm1ocy10aWZmYW55LWRlYWw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"“Jewellery is always more resilient and always recovers faster than the rest of the luxury market,” says Jean-Christophe Babin, chief executive of Bulgari, the Italian jeweller founded in 1884 that since 2011 has been part of LVMH, the world’s largest luxury group.

You would think that indulging in diamonds amid one of the worst economic slowdowns in recent history may seem incongruous, even for wealthy individuals who have continued to do well thanks to a booming stock market. But both in China and the US – the world’s top luxury markets – jewellery has been one of the most resilient categories.

At the height of the coronavirus pandemic last year, while much of the world’s population was stuck at home clad in cosy loungewear or trying out skincare routines in their bathrooms, the world’s rich were buying fine jewellery.

“If you think about it, jewellery is the oldest form of luxury; it started 15,000 years ago to celebrate the mating between a man and a woman in every civilisation and corner of the world. Fifteen thousand years later, the role of jewellery has remained the same: the celebration of things in life like mating, and today it can be a man and a woman or two men.”

Babin sees the pandemic as an opportunity for Bulgari and the entire luxury industry.

French-born Babin has been at the helm of Bulgari since 2013, after 12 years as the chief executive of LVMH watch brand Tag Heuer . Affable and talkative, Babin is one of the most dynamic CEOs in the industry and has turned Bulgari into one of the success stories of LVMH, a company known for taking over historic houses and transforming them into global brands.

As Babin sees it, it was a confluence of factors – some predating the pandemic – that have helped Bulgari, and other jewellery brands, weather the crisis.

“If you buy a piece from Bulgari now, it will still be worth a lot of money in one century, but if you buy a pair of shoes, it’s worth nothing,” he says.

He also mentions an increase in working women’s purchasing power as a factor in propelling jewellery sales in the last two decades. “Traditionally, jewellery was a gift from a man to a woman, but with [more women now working worldwide], they like to reward themselves, so for all these reasons jewellery is the most resilient category in luxury.”

This doesn’t mean, however, that Bulgari has not been affected by the pandemic. Temporary store closures, travel restrictions and the inability to hold physical events accelerated a shift to digital channels that Babin says was already happening before the crisis.

In the US, for instance, e-commerce is the number-one retail channel for Bulgari, even for big-ticket items that luxury consumers are used to buying in physical stores.

“Fifteen years ago when you started buying online, you would buy more affordable items because maybe you weren’t sure about things like shipping, but now people are very confident and buy expensive products online, like electronics, so it’s the same for jewellery,” Babin says. He believes that in five years the number-one store in all the countries where the brand offers online sales will be the digital one.

Like many other luxury CEOs who have risen to prominence in the last decade, Babin has witnessed first-hand the growth of China as the top luxury market in the world. He says that Bulgari is one of the most desirable brands in China, which accounts for more than a third of its jewellery and accessory sales.

The pandemic has not affected Bulgari’s busy schedule of customer events and marketing activations in China, where the coronavirus was first detected in December 2019 and where lockdowns were relatively short-lived compared to those in Europe or the US.

“The Chinese never stopped buying and once things reopened [in March and April last year] they massively returned to stores,” Babin says.

“They were saving on travel, hotels, entertainment and spent that money on luxury goods within China. This has boosted sales in a way that nobody expected, with triple-digit growth. The beauty of it is that it has continued and 11 months after the reopening of stores, the trend in mainland China is the same.”

The repatriation of luxury spending within China has been a saving grace for luxury brands that have long relied on travellers from rising economies such as China and the Middle East for most of their sales in places like France, Italy, Singapore and Hong Kong.

To make up for lost sales due to the collapse of travel retail in tourist-driven markets, Bulgari has shifted its focus onto local consumers, a demographic that Babin admits had been neglected for years, especially in places like Hong Kong.

The special administrative region has long been a magnet for Chinese tourists, who have always taken advantage of favourable prices to go on shopping sprees in the city, but months of anti-government protests in 2019 , followed by travel bans imposed during the pandemic, have battered the city’s formerly thriving retail scene.

“Just two years ago, Hong Kong was the number-one market for most brands, mainly because of tourism,” Babin says. “With [Covid-19], tourism has come to a total halt, so luxury brands had to rely on domestic clients, who had been neglected much more than in other countries because the number of tourists coming to Hong Kong was quite overwhelming.”

I am confident that Hong Kong remains Hong Kong, like Paris and New York, a place you want to visit Jean-Christophe Babin

Bulgari directly operates seven stores in the city – compare that to New York, where the brand only has one – and has had to adapt to these difficult times by reducing working hours for retail staff, negotiating better terms with landlords and pivoting to wealthy locals.

Babin says that it’s likely that Bulgari will close “a couple of stores in the city”, those that were already underperforming even before the crisis, but he has confidence in Hong Kong as a regional and global retail hub for years to come.

“It’s still the easiest destination for Chinese tourists to go, a short flight away,” Babin says. “They will come back and the Hong Kong government knows very well that the quicker the vaccination campaign goes the better, because this is a condition from the Chinese government to allow Chinese tourists to travel to Covid-free destinations.

“We’ve seen this in Macau, which has partly reopened, and business has been good, so when I look at Macau next door already booming back I am confident that Hong Kong remains Hong Kong, like Paris and New York, a place you want to visit. Timing will be about the vaccination campaign and a peaceful climate.”

Babin’s upbeat outlook on Hong Kong, and the luxury industry in general, reflects his can-do spirit and bold approach as a chief executive.

Even during the pandemic, Bulgari, which partnered with Britain’s Oxford University to support antiviral research, has hosted large-scale events in Europe. While digital channels will remain important for the brand, Babin agrees that physical events are vital for high-touch segments like jewellery and watches, and says that the brand plans to hold high-profile events in Milan and Geneva this summer.

Babin’s confidence in the strength of the jewellery segment reflects the importance of the category for LVMH, which until recently had lagged behind rival Richemont, the owner of brands such as Cartier and Van Cleef & Arpels, in the jewellery and watches sector.

Earlier this year, LVMH acquired Tiffany, one of the most recognisable and beloved jewellery brands in the world, for US$16 billion, the luxury sector’s largest-ever deal.

“The move towards Tiffany was obvious strategically speaking because jewellery has been so resilient and fast-growing,” Babin says. “So you want not only to grow organically, which we have been doing with Bulgari, but you also want to be the world leader because it’s an amazing market, so the Tiffany acquisition was strategic but also logical.

“Bulgari and Tiffany are competitors like Dior and Louis Vuitton are, but we’re also very different. Tiffany is very American and is the bridal brand. Bulgari is more about precious jewellery and watches, which is a category that is still small at Tiffany. There is some overlap between us but we have our strategy and they have theirs, and at a certain point we will try to find some synergies.”

Looking ahead, Babin sees the crisis as an opportunity for Bulgari – and the entire luxury industry – thanks in no small part to the growth of luxury sales within mainland China, which he thinks will continue even after the Chinese will start to travel again.

“I’m very optimistic when I look at the future of Bulgari post-pandemic,” he says. “The pillar of mainland China, the Chinese travelling again and the focus on local customers – these three things will all continue. Covid has taken us to the next level of clientelling excellence. We had to be creative and proactive and eventually we will benefit from all this as an industry.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.5559520125389099}",neutral,0.5559520125389099,0
Dior Demand in China Gives LVMH a $10 Billion Covid-Proof Boost - Caixin Global,"Thu, 15 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNhaXhpbmdsb2JhbC5jb20vMjAyMS0wNC0xNS9kaW9yLWRlbWFuZC1pbi1jaGluYS1naXZlcy1sdm1oLWEtMTAtYmlsbGlvbi1jb3ZpZC1wcm9vZi1ib29zdC0xMDE2OTE1NzguaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"(Bloomberg) — If evidence were needed of how far China has moved beyond the pandemic, perhaps the strongest was the scene at Christian Dior’s fall fashion show earlier this week at an art museum in Shanghai.

Champagne and Cognac sales grow for LVMH in 2021 - Decanter.com,"Wed, 14 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlY2FudGVyLmNvbS93aW5lLW5ld3MvY2hhbXBhZ25lLWFuZC1jb2duYWMtc2FsZXMtZ3Jvdy1mb3ItbHZtaC1pbi0yMDIxLTQ1NjQyOS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The strong performance from the wine and spirits arm of luxury goods giant LVMH helped its parent company to post first-quarter revenues of just under €14bn, up 30% on last year and 8% higher than the first three months of 2019.

Moët Hennessy’s first-quarter revenues of €1.51bn were 36% higher than the same period in 2020, and 17% up on the first three months of 2019, the company said. That made the wine and spirits division the second-best performer for LVMH, behind Fashion & Leather Goods.

LVMH highlighted ‘good performances’ for its wine and spirits brands in Europe and the US, adding that sales volumes of Hennessy Cognac were 28% higher than in 2020. ‘China, which is the first market to have been affected by the pandemic, experienced a strong rebound,’ LVMH said. ‘Demand in the United States remained robust.’

COVID-19 severely impacted LVMH’s business in 2020: the company’s first-quarter revenues of €10.6bn were down 17% on the same period of 2019, with Moët Hennessy’s sales falling 14% to €1.18bn.

Champagne volumes suffered a ‘significant’ drop in the second quarter of 2020, but rebounded somewhat later in the year, especially in the US.

The year also saw the integration into the business of 2019 acquisitions Château d’Esclans and Château du Galoupet, makers of high-end Provence rosé wine, including d’Esclans’ popular Whispering Angel label.

In February this year, Moët Hennessy bought a 50% stake in luxury Champagne brand Armand de Brignac from rap star and entrepreneur Jay-Z for an undisclosed sum.

The company has taken over global distribution for the Champagne, also known as ‘Ace of Spades’ Champagne and famed for its metallic bottles, pewter labels and high price-tags.

Following two generations of female designers in her family, Cynthia is shattering the glass ceiling as the first female Middle Eastern designer to ever be nominated for the LVMH Prize.

Talking about her Lebanese identity, she noted on Instagram, “It was not lost on me the way our stories were time and time again being appropriated and simplified into tragic or exoticized narratives.”

“However, our lives are not simply backdrops for these narratives, they are incredibly complex stories. Interwoven with our great pain and tragedy is an abundance of joy, humor, and above all great beauty,” she superbly put forward.

“My desire to give this incredible poetry a voice is the reason I founded @renaissance_renaissance. Being born into a special heritage of female founders and designers, I wanted to explore this through our traditions of garment making.”

Cynthia returned to Beirut in 2016 after pursuing Visual Communication at the Royal College of Art and Central Saint Martins in London. She is the third generation of women in her family to launch their own atelier.

Her craft has thus far survived the pandemic, the economic collapse in Lebanon, and the harrowing Beirut explosion that took place on August 4, 2020, and is pushing through the harsh reality Lebanese have to live with.

If she wins the LVMH Prize, Cynthia will receive a grant of €300,000 ($356,724) that will help her develop the brand and put her label into hyperdrive right from Beirut.

Every year, LVMH rewards up-and-coming designers chosen for their talent and creativity. Cynthia can be this year’s winner. People can support her raw Lebanese talent by voting for her brand here. Votes are open until April 11th.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999134540557861}",neutral,0.9999134540557861,0
Soaring demand for luxuries propels Bernard Arnault to second place in world rich list - Fortune,"Mon, 19 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vZm9ydHVuZS5jb20vMjAyMS8wNC8xOS9iZXJuYXJkLWFybmF1bHQta25vY2tzLWVsb24tbXVzay1vbi13b3JsZC1iaWxsaW9uYWlyZS1yYW5raW5ncy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The pandemic has made the rich richer. And a man who sells expensive handbags and Champagne has risen one spot to No. 2 on the rich list, knocking off Tesla’s Elon Musk en route.

Bernard Arnault, the chief executive of the world’s biggest luxury goods group LVMH, is now the world’s second richest person, behind Jeff Bezos, thanks to a revival in demand for luxuries.

Last week, LVMH revealed a surge in revenue in the first quarter, surpassing pre-pandemic numbers and allowing Arnault—who owns 47.5% of LVMH—to jump to second place on the Forbes Real-Time Billionaires List.

Owning an arsenal of luxury names, LVMH is behind drink labels such as Moët & Chandon and Hennessy and fashion brands Louis Vuitton, Loewe, Christian Dior, and Kenzo.

In November, the French firm also realized a long-held dream in clinching a $16 billion takeover of storied U.S. jeweler Tiffany & Co., which is currently being integrated into the LVMH portfolio. So crucial is the acquisition that LVMH has said it is not considering any other purchase until its integration is complete.

Arnault’s entire family net worth is now $182 billion, $2 billion higher than Elon Musk’s but lagging $16 billion behind that of Jeff Bezos.

Arnault, whose riches depend largely on the old-world charms of tried and tested luxury brands, was briefly the world’s richest person in December 2019 and again in January 2020. But that didn’t last. When the COVID-19 pandemic broke in China, the company’s largest growth market, shares in the luxury goods group fell, knocking Arnault off the top ranking.

But demand from Chinese consumers has revived, with LVMH’s sales in Asia, excluding Japan, jumping 86% higher in the first quarter compared with a year ago. Overall, LVMH’s revenue was up 32% from the same period in 2020 and 8% higher than in 2019, driven by demand in Asia and the U.S.

Revenue in Europe was still in the red as countries in the region are grappling with renewed lockdown orders and a lack of tourist footfall. If much of Europe comes out of lockdown and shops reopen, Arnault’s riches might still continue to grow.

Luxury goods group LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton posted Q1 revenues of €14 billion, up by +32% year-on-year (+30% on an organic basis). The performance marks a return to growth after several quarters of decline in 2020 due to the global pandemic. Organic revenue grew +8% compared to the first quarter of 2019.

All divisions posted growth except for Selective Retailing, which includes DFS Group (majority owned by LVMH) and Starboard Cruise Services. This business group was hit by the continued restrictions on international travel, with organic revenue declining -5% compared to the first quarter of 2020 and -30% compared to that of 2019.

LVMH said: “DFS continued to experience a significant decline in activity in most destinations due to the lack of international travel.”

Group-wide, the US and Asia enjoyed strong growth, while Europe remains affected by the crisis due to store closures and the suspension of tourism.

The Wines & Spirits business group recorded organic revenue growth of +36% compared to the same period in 2020 and +17% compared to that of 2019. Champagne volumes were up +22% compared to Q1 2020. Hennessy Cognac saw its volumes increase by +28% year-on-year. China experienced a strong rebound.

The Fashion & Leather Goods business group achieved organic revenue growth of +52% compared to Q1 2020 and +37% compared to Q1 2019. This was driven by “a remarkable performance” from Louis Vuitton plus a strong showing from Christian Dior.

In Perfumes & Cosmetics, organic revenue grew +18% in Q1 2021 compared to the same period in 2020 and was down -4% compared to the same period in 2019. LVMH said: “The major brands continued to be selective in their distribution and limit promotions. They benefited from the continued growth in online sales from local customers, which offset the impact of the suspension of international travel and the closure of many points of sale.”

The Watches & Jewelry business group recorded organic revenue growth of +35% in Q1 2021 compared to the same period of 2020 and +1% compared to that of 2019. The quarter marked the integration for the first time of Tiffany & Co, which saw an “excellent” start to the year.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9999997615814209}",positive,0.9999997615814209,1
PETA US Asks LVMH to Drop Fur and Exotic Skins Ahead of Its Annual Meeting - PETA UK,"Wed, 14 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiNmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBldGEub3JnLnVrL2Jsb2cvbHZtaC1hbm51YWwtbWVldGluZy0yMDIxL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"When will LVMH make the sensible decision to move away from the dangerous and cruel trade in the skins of minks, alligators, foxes, and pythons and invest in the future?

PETA US submitted this question ahead of the fashion group’s annual general meeting on Thursday, 15 April. PETA US has been an LVMH shareholder since 2017.

LVMH executives need to join Chanel, Calvin Klein, and Tommy Hilfiger, and numerous other brands that have committed to banning fur and exotic skins. Their socially responsible decision spares billions of sentient individuals suffering and helps safeguard public health.

What’s Wrong With Fur and Exotic Skins?

Behind every item made with fur or exotic skin is an animal who’s endured pain and suffering.

On fur farms, animals typically spend their entire lives confined to cramped, filthy cages, where they have no opportunity to engage in natural behaviour, such as playing, running, finding food, and raising a family.

Jo-Anne McArthur / #MakeFurHistory

The stress of this extreme confinement often drives them insane, and fighting, self-mutilation, and cannibalism are common. At the end of their miserable lives, they face a horrific death – often by gassing, electrocution, or poisoning.

The exotic-skins industry is just as barbaric and cruel. Bernard Arnault, CEO of LVMH, is aware of a PETA’s brand-new exposé of the industry. The footage shows workers inflating snakes to death with compressed air and electrocuting, trampling, and stabbing crocodiles who were presumably still conscious.

These are common practices in the exotic-skins trade, and yet, LVMH refuses to cut ties with the industry.

Fur and Exotic Skins Could Cause the Next Pandemic

LVMH’s stubbornness puts public health at risk. By continuing to use exotic skins and fur, the fashion house supports the unsanitary confinement of stressed and sick animals and their slaughter in appalling conditions.

The fur industry is directly involved in the spread of the novel coronavirus. Outbreaks have been recorded on fur farms in Canada, Denmark – where a variant of the disease in minks has infected humans – France, Greece, Italy, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, and the United States, resulting in the emergency slaughter of millions of animals.

What You Can Do

PETA is calling on LVMH to eliminate the risk that its crocodile-skin bags and fur coats pose to public health and stop supporting animal suffering.

Kris Van Assche Exits Berluti | BoF - The Business of Fashion,"Tue, 20 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzb2ZmYXNoaW9uLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy9sdXh1cnkva3Jpcy12YW4tYXNzY2hlLWV4aXRzLWJlcmx1dGkv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LVMH’s Berluti is parting ways with designer Kris Van Assche, its artistic director since 2018, and will rethink its presentation schedule moving forward. His last collection for Berluti, Autumn/Winter 2021, was presented on April 8.

At Berluti, the Belgian designer was charged with bringing a more fashion-centric perspective to a brand primarily known for shoes, leather accessories and suiting and for building a larger audience in Asia. He was also responsible for expanding the label’s ready-to-wear collection and redefining its identity following the exit of designer Alessandro Sartori, who left in 2016. Sartori was first replaced by Haider Ackermann, who left after three seasons.

Van Assche, who is known for his layered, draped designs and who counts Tilda Swinton and Kanye West as fans, joined the traditional men’s luxury label after 11 years leading Dior Homme. His appointment to the top design job at Berluti came during a wider shuffling of the design talent among LVMH’s men’s collections to capitalise on the rise of more casual, streetwear-influenced style in the category.

LVMH acquired Berluti in 1993 and it remains the only men’s focused label within its portfolio. Berluti added leather goods in 2005 and ready-to-wear in 2011. It is run by chief executive Antoine Arnault.

“In order to maintain our commitment to both savoir-faire and innovation we have decided to let Berluti lead its own rhythm and give freedom to its presentation schedule,” said Arnault in a statement that also thanked Van Assche. “He has brought his own vision to Berluti, particularly by integrating new codes into its signatures.”

Americans are drinking lots of champagne and cognac - Quartz,"Tue, 13 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vcXouY29tLzE5OTU3ODgvYW1lcmljYW5zLWFyZS1kcmlua2luZy1sb3RzLW9mLWNoYW1wYWduZS1hbmQtY29nbmFj0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Americans may be known to love a cold beer, but lots of them are also sipping champagne or cognac as they ride out the pandemic.

One company taking advantage of Americans’ refined tastes is French luxury giant LVMH, owner of brands including Moët and Hennessy. “We benefited there from a brilliant cognac market,” Jean Jacques Guiony, LVMH’s chief financial officer, said on a call with investors and analysts today. “We could certainly sell more if we had more bottles.”

Guiony said LVMH has been selling cognac in the US as fast as it can bottle it for some time, and sales of champagne have been strong too. Its champagne inventory in the US started to run low at the end of last year, so as retailers restocked to start 2021, sales rose. Many had also rushed to buy ahead of a price increase LVMH implemented at the end of the recent quarter. (The company didn’t say whether the decision by the US in March to suspend tariffs it had levied on French goods, including cognac and wine, at the start of the year had any effect.) The demand helped LVMH’s global volume sales of cognac and champagne to increase 28% and 22%, respectively, compared to last year.

Why Americans are splurging on high-end liquor

Americans started to drink more during the pandemic as they looked for ways to occupy their time and, in some cases, to self-medicate. Many splurged on premium liquor as a way of treating themselves to small luxuries while they’re stuck at home. The Distilled Spirits Council of the United States, a trade group representing distillers and marketers, said sales of high-end spirits rose in 2020 as shoppers who couldn’t go to events or dine out spent more on themselves and tried to bring a restaurant or bar experience into their homes.

Liquor companies have noted similar patterns. “They’re not able to go out to concerts and sports events and those types of things, and so they’re spending more money on food and beverage,” Kathryn Mikells, CFO of Diageo, which owns numerous brands including Johnny Walker and Ketel One, said on a call with analysts and investors this January. “They’re interested in treating themselves.”

Mikells added that the taste for premium booze actually began before Covid-19 hit the US. The past year just heightened it, and she expects it to stick around for a time. That’s good news for makers of top-shelf liquor, including LVMH.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9982308745384216}",neutral,0.9982308745384216,0

LVMH reports first-quarter financial results on April 13 and holds its general meeting on April 15.

The owner of Louis Vuitton, Dior and dozens of other brands typically sets the tone for the rest of the luxury industry each earnings season.

The US and China, luxury’s biggest markets, are booming, though whether that will translate into surging sales remains to be seen.

There’s less clarity than usual about how luxury’s biggest brands have fared so far in 2021. The industry is likely to see strong economic data out of the US and China translate into booming sales from its two biggest markets. But lockdowns across much of Europe can’t be good for business. LVMH will release first-quarter results on Tuesday, and with a global presence in ready-to-wear, leather goods, beauty and hotels, its outlook will set the tone for competitors. The latest report will be followed soon after by LVMH’s annual shareholder meeting on Thursday, an opportunity for executives to give a detailed outlook for the coming months and, occasionally, to make some news. Last year, CEO Bernard Arnault predicted a gradual recovery from the pandemic, setting expectations low for what turned out to be a surprisingly robust rebound for the conglomerate’s brands. The normally bullish Arnault is unlikely to be quite so circumspect this time.

The Bottom Line: One area to watch is LVMH’s travel retail business. Air passenger volumes are rising rapidly in the US and some other countries, but it’s not yet clear whether the international shopping trips that are so important to global luxury brands are making a comeback.

RAMADAN, REIMAGINED

ADVERTISEMENT

Ramadan, a month of prayer, fasting and spiritual reflection celebrated across the Muslim world, begins this week.

The holiday, and particularly its closing Eid-al-Fitr festival, is typically a major source of business for fashion brands in Muslim-majority nations.

Net-a-Porter, Shein, Farfetch and Zalora are among the e-tailers producing special edits or collections for Ramadan.

Last year Ramadan, which rotates around the calendar based on the lunar calendar, happened to fall in late April when global lockdowns were at their strictest. Sales from what was normally the Muslim world’s biggest shopping event of the year were effectively wiped out. In 2021, fashion brands and retailers are hoping to make up for lost time. They just might: Dubai’s malls have been open since last summer, and the emirate, along with nearby Bahrain and Qatar, has been among the world’s fastest at vaccinating its population. Retailers who depend on the “Ramadan Rush” of Muslim tourists arriving to the UK and other destinations are out of luck, however. And some of the largest Muslim-majority countries by population, including Indonesia, have been slower to roll out vaccinations.

The Bottom Line: Global retailers are hedging their bets with renewed e-commerce investments in Ramadan edits and collections. These proved popular before the pandemic and will be decisive in reaching consumers looking to dress up even in countries where gatherings are still prohibited.

CLOSING FASHION’S SUSTAINABILITY GAP

Join us on April 14 for a four-hour live broadcast featuring conversations about fashion’s biggest sustainability challenges and opportunities with leading global experts, thought leaders and activists.

Fashion sustainability pioneer Stella McCartney will close the summit with a keynote address in conversation with Imran Amed.

The summit will dig deeper into the findings of The BoF Sustainability Index, which benchmarks the performance of fashion’s biggest companies against ambitious environmental and social goals.

The coming decade is a critical period to achieve global sustainability goals, but fashion’s actions are falling short. Scandals over labour exploitation remain commonplace. The process of making clothes continues to rely on toxic chemicals and emissions-intensive manufacturing and shipping. The whole business of fashion is engineered to thrive on habits of wasteful over-consumption. Pressure to change is ratcheting up from consumers, regulators and investors. But what should companies be doing? Join us on April 14 for BoF’s first Professional Summit of 2021, Closing Fashion’s Sustainability Gap to hear solutions and opportunities from a top line-up of expert speakers.

The Bottom Line: The financial and reputational risks presented by fashion’s inaction on sustainability are increasingly significant. Getting to grips with the challenges and solutions is critical for the industry.

"Kris Van Assche Leaves Berluti, LVMH Confirms - HYPEBEAST","Tue, 20 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vaHlwZWJlYXN0LmNvbS8yMDIxLzQva3Jpcy12YW4tYXNzY2hlLWJlcmx1dGktY3JlYXRpdmUtZGlyZWN0b3ItbGVhdmluZ9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Creative director Kris Van Assche is leaving Berluti, The Business of Fashion reported. The decision was made as part of a push to “let Berluti lead its own rhythm and give freedom to its presentation schedule,” Berluti CEO Antoine Arnault said in a statement quoted by the BoF.

Van Assche joined the LVMH-owned luxury label in 2018, about a month after LVMH brought on Virgil Abloh for Louis Vuitton and Kim Jones at Dior. There, Van Assche oversaw ready-to-wear and the house’s signature leather goods alike, replacing creative director Haider Ackermann, who left after presenting only three collections. Before landing the gig at Berluti, Van Assche spent over a decade at Dior Homme as artistic director.

His run at Berluti was denoted by an appreciation for the label’s signature leathercraft, with leather suits, footwear and accessories often hand-painted or stitched in homage to Berluti’s patina-laden shoes. Artist partnerships, akin to Jones’ collaborative streak at Dior, invited plenty of splashy colors and street-leaning outerwear as part of LVMH’s bid to lure a younger audience to Berluti. However, Van Assche’s emphasis on contemporary tailoring also attracted plenty of musicians and celebrities, who made Berluti a red carpet staple.

Berluti wasn’t cited by name in LVMH’s most recent quarterly report, which otherwise heaped praise on the boosted incomes of stable brands Louis Vuitton and Dior. Because LVMH didn’t include specifics, it’s impossible to say how well Berluti was doing under Van Assche’s purview.

CEO Arnault lauded Van Assche’s tenure in his statement regarding the director’s departure. “He has brought his own vision to Berluti, particularly by integrating new codes into its signatures,” said Arnault. HYPEBEAST has reached out for Arnault’s full comment.

Van Assche’s final collection for Berluti was the recent Fall/Winter 2021 presentation, which included a collaboration with artist Lev Khesin.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999939203262329}",neutral,0.9999939203262329,0
Anya Taylor-Joy Said to Shoot Ad for Tiffany & Co. Amid Shakeup - WWD,"Thu, 15 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3dkLmNvbS9hY2Nlc3Nvcmllcy1uZXdzL2pld2VscnkvdGlmZmFueS1jby1sdm1oLWFueWEtdGF5bG9yLWpveS1qZXdsZXJ5LTEyMzQ4MDE2Nzcv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Tiffany & Co. is seeing major changes to its marketing mechanics. The first tides of the jeweler’s overhaul by LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton are being felt in the company’s public positioning and advertising.

WWD has learned that after 30-plus years, Tiffany has recently discontinued its daily print ad within the New York Times. The jeweler’s stalwart ad had appeared each day in the top right corner of page three, a premium placement that was essentially at eye level as soon as readers turned the page from the paper’s cover. Tiffany is said to have run its first ad in the New York Times in the late 1800s.

Tiffany is reevaluating its ad strategy under the direction of Alexandre Arnault — who had previously pivoted Rimowa’s marketing strategy toward mostly digital buys. Tiffany is said to be continuing its relationship with the New York Times with nearly similar spends, just on a primarily digital front. There are also plans for more impactful print ad packages. A Times spokesperson did not respond to requests for comment.

This comes as Tiffany sharpens its messaging, particularly on social media where the jeweler’s account is now taking a decidedly less corporate tone. There is a new emphasis on the jeweler’s rich archives and more enterprising designs. Arnault himself has also opened up his personal social media account for questions and comments as he steers Tiffany in a new direction.

Tiffany’s marketing creative is now being led by Ruba Abu-Nimah, whose vast connections within New York’s underground creative field should make for a more forward-thinking brand image.

No doubt, Abu-Nimah’s eye was involved on set in New York City on Tuesday where budding A-list actress Anya Taylor-Joy was photographed for Tiffany’s first campaign under LVMH’s watch. Paparazzi photos see Taylor-Joy strolling arm-in-arm with model Alton Mason along Fifth Avenue, not too far from the Tiffany & Co. flagship.

In photos, the actress is seen wearing a statement gold necklace molded to look like two cables intertwined in a knot. Matching earrings and rings indicate that these designs are part of a new commercial collection to be launched in the coming months. Taylor-Joy has been making the virtual awards ceremony rounds in Tiffany & Co. jewelry this year but it’s unclear if she’s signed on as an official brand ambassador. A spokesperson declined to elaborate on the collection and campaign but did confirm that the shoot was for Tiffany.

Regardless, it seems that the spend is on at Tiffany — which LVMH noted is a big priority where the company will “devote all our resources,” Jean-Jacques Guiony, LMVH’s chief financial officer, said Tuesday during a call about the company’s first-quarter earnings. With the addition of Tiffany, sales in LVMH’s jewelry and watch division grew by more than double.

“It will take years to do what we want to do with this brand from a distribution, merchandising and marketing viewpoint. It’s a lot of work. We are committed to doing it. We are very hopeful that with the strength of the brand, we can achieve our objectives, and we will report them as they unfold,” added Guiony.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999926090240479}",neutral,0.9999926090240479,0
Tiffany Executive Alexandre Arnault Said Joining Board of Birkenstock - WWD,"Fri, 30 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3dkLmNvbS9mYXNoaW9uLW5ld3MvZmFzaGlvbi1zY29vcHMvYmlya2Vuc3RvY2stYWxleGFuZHJlLWFybmF1bHQtYm9hcmQtMTIzNDgxMzg4MC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"FEET FIRST: Alexandre Arnault, executive vice president, product and communications at Tiffany & Co., has quietly joined the supervisory board of Birkenstock, WWD has learned.

According to market sources, Arnault played a key role in the February deal that saw private equity giant L Catterton and family holding Financière Agache, investment vehicles backed by LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton and luxury titan Bernard Arnault and his family, respectively, acquire a majority stake in the German sandal maker.

L Catterton revealed the completion of the acquisition today. It also noted that Birkenstock appointed six members to the supervisory board, including L Catterton’s Michael Chu, global co-chief executive officer, and Nik Thukral and Luigi Feola, managing partners; Birkenstock CEO Oliver Reichert, and one representative each from GIC, a sovereign wealth fund from Singapore, and Financière Agache. A spokeswoman for L Catterton declined to comment on the names of the representatives from GIC and Agache.

Alexandre Arnault is the second-eldest son of Bernard Arnault and was named as part of a management trio at Tiffany to lend his strong digital acumen, Millennial perspective, branding expertise and network of connections in Silicon Valley. Before joining the American jeweler last January in the wake of LVMH’s takeover, he had been CEO of German luggage firm Rimowa since 2017.

Industry observers have suggested that Birkenstock may develop the same way Rimowa has since LVMH bought a majority stake from that family-owned brand’s heirs in 2016. Since then, LVMH has pushed Rimowa toward more designer collaborations, including with streetwear stalwarts such as Supreme and Off-White, as well as with LVMH stablemate Dior, and opened more Rimowa stores.

The two remaining relatives of the founder of Birkenstock, Christian and Alex Birkenstock, stayed on with the company and hold a minority share, as reported. The firm dates back to 1774.

The news, which will surely make young designers happy, then comes together with the possible decision by France to prohibit the disposal of unsold goods by brands, a choice that could inevitably force many brands to review their production and company policies.

According to the Queen of Raw website, unused material costs brands around $120 billion each year. A reckless figure, which in addition to weighing on the coffers of companies, also weighs on the planet. LVMH's initiative, in addition to being able to remedy a situation that is in many ways out of control, closely resembles that of MSCHF. Last February the collective had imagined a possible collaboration between Birkenstock and Hermès using pieces of some Birkin bags to create the new Birkinstocks.

If the initiative of the American collective was halfway between criticism and irreverent gimmick, that of LVMH seems instead to be a decisive step forward towards a fashion system that is more aware of its defects, but above all open to change in the name of sustainability.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9988594055175781}",neutral,0.9988594055175781,0

LVMH shares hit record high after strong sales figures | Mint - Mint,"Wed, 14 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxpdmVtaW50LmNvbS9jb21wYW5pZXMvbHZtaC1zaGFyZXMtaGl0LXJlY29yZC1oaWdoLWFmdGVyLXN0cm9uZy1zYWxlcy1maWd1cmVzLTExNjE4MzkwMDgzMzU4Lmh0bWzSAXFodHRwczovL3d3dy5saXZlbWludC5jb20vY29tcGFuaWVzL2x2bWgtc2hhcmVzLWhpdC1yZWNvcmQtaGlnaC1hZnRlci1zdHJvbmctc2FsZXMtZmlndXJlcy9hbXAtMTE2MTgzOTAwODMzNTguaHRtbA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS: LVMH's shares rose to record highs on Wednesday after the world's biggest luxury goods company posted sales figures that showed it had bounced back far more quickly than expected in early 2021.

LVMH shares were up by 2.7% in early session trading, hitting new record levels, and also lifting up the shares of rival luxury goods companies such as Kering and Hermes.

Late on Tuesday, LVMH posted first-quarter revenues that even exceeded 2019 levels, before the pandemic.

Its like-for-like sales, which strip out the effect of currency changes and its acquisition of U.S. jeweller Tiffany, rose by 30% year-on-year in the three months to March to 14 billion euros ($16.75 billion).

""LVMH noted that Q1 was a 'good start to the year', but to us this is much better than 'good' and will once again stand as an absolute outperformance vs the rest of the sector,"" wrote JP Morgan in a research note.

LVMH shares are up by around 20% since the start of 2021.

($1 = 0.8360 euros)
