LVMH Gets Competitive About Sustainability | BoF - The Business of Fashion,"Thu, 26 Sep 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzb2ZmYXNoaW9uLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy9zdXN0YWluYWJpbGl0eS9sdm1oLWdldHMtY29tcGV0aXRpdmUtYWJvdXQtc3VzdGFpbmFiaWxpdHkv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS, France — The parent of Louis Vuitton, Dior and other luxury brands doesn't think much of how the rest of the industry is tackling fashion's climate problems.

""We prefer acts to pacts,"" LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton executive and board member Antoine Arnault said at the opening of an event the conglomerate hosted in Paris to outline its environmental agenda.

The remark was a reference to a sustainability agreement signed by more than 30 brands and presented to world leaders last month by François-Henri Pinault, chief executive of Kering, LVMH's main rival in the luxury space. LVMH was not among the signatories, and Arnault dismissed the initiative as a ""textile pact"" on Wednesday.

Kering, which owns Gucci and Saint Laurent among other brands, has been particularly vocal on sustainability issues. Earlier this week it announced plans to go completely carbon neutral. The company declined to comment on LVMH's remarks.

LVMH has come under fire in the past for lagging behind its rivals on climate action, though it has had an environmental program in place for decades. In addition to fashion, the company makes wine, sells spirits and dominates perfume, skincare and cosmetics markets, adding an extra layer of complexity to the environmental challenges it faces.

The conglomerate says that’s a key reason it has eschewed many industry-wide sustainability initiatives, including the fashion pact spearheaded by Pinault at the request of French President Emmanuel Macron. That initiative aims to mitigate fashion’s impact on the climate, biodiversity and oceans, though exactly how that will be achieved is still a work in progress.

We prefer acts to pacts.

Such efforts are getting underway as consumers and regulators are becoming more aware of the industry’s negative impact, making it increasingly important for fashion companies to show that they are taking a leading and active role on climate. The sector slurps water for raw material production and manufacturing, spews pollution into the atmosphere and churns toxic chemicals into waterways. There’s growing pressure to change.

On Monday, 16-year-old Swedish activist Greta Thunberg condemned world leaders for their lack of action on climate in an emotional speech at the United Nations. Her words reflect the views of millions of young people — fashion’s future consumers.

""She is indulging in an absolute catastrophism about the evolution of the world,"" LVMH Chief Executive Bernard Arnault said of the young climate activist. ""I find it demoralising."" Instead, Arnault told the company's Paris gathering of around 300 members of the press, senior executives and employees that he wanted to focus on solutions that could enable economic growth while tackling the challenges of global warming.

LVMH’s own actions were the focus of the three-hour-long conference on Wednesday. The company is nearing the deadline for targets it set to reduce its impact by the end of the decade.

LVMH said it is on track to meet or exceed its 2020 goals to procure 30 percent of its energy from renewable sources and reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 25 percent across its own operations, despite sales growth. Companies are increasingly facing pressure to include their supply chains in these targets, as this is where the vast majority of fashion’s impact takes place. It is aiming to reduce the overall environmental impact of its packaging by 10 percent — an important part of the footprint for a company with large cosmetics and perfume holdings. Elsewhere it is set to hit goals to improve its sourcing of precious stones, leather and animal furs.

We will have ambitious objectives after 2020.

""You have to keep in mind, this was the ambition we set in 2013,"" the head of LVMH's environmental department Sylvie Bénard told The Business of Fashion. The company will set new goals after next year once it has all the results of the current program. ""We will have ambitious objectives after 2020,"" Bénard said.

The company already teased new initiatives, including updated guidelines on how to source animal-based raw materials like fur, leather, exotic skins, wool and feathers, providing aid to fight fires in the Amazon and collaborating with the Solar Impulse Foundation to develop new technologies that can combat environmental issues.

The company noted that it has doubled the amount it contributes to its internal carbon fund — a pot of money used to finance efforts to bring down operational carbon emissions — to €30 ($33) per ton of carbon, and is focused on reducing rather than offsetting its footprint. The fund is currently valued at nearly €12 million ($13 million).

Kering already has standards in place for sourcing and manufacturing raw materials. It’s working to reduce emissions across its entire supply chain 50 percent by 2025, and reduce its broader environmental impact by 40 percent. It’s expected to spend millions of dollars on its new offsetting program to achieve carbon neutrality, which is intended as an additional stop-gap measure to mitigate the emissions the company can’t currently avoid.

“They are talking about objectives and initiatives, we talk about our results,” the head of LVMH’s environmental department Bénard said.

They are talking about objectives and initiatives, we talk about our results.

Still, LVMH looks cautious compared to some of its peers, many of which already have similar initiatives in place or have gone further with more ambitious targets. Across the sector, new environmental initiatives have been released at a dizzying rate over the last 12 months. A suite of companies have pledged to reduce the industry’s emissions by 30 percent over the next decade as part of UN charter for climate action within fashion. LVMH is not a signatory.

Perhaps the biggest leap LVMH has taken into embracing sustainable fashion came in July, when the company took a minority stake in Stella McCartney's brand, a little over a year after the label split from Kering. The sustainable and ethical luxury brand has been at the forefront of the growing conversation amongst consumers and regulators around responsible fashion.

Other LVMH brands are also becoming more vocal on the subject. Dior used its Paris catwalk show this week as a platform to highlight climate issues.

McCartney has also been brought on as an advisor to LVMH Chief Executive Bernard Arnault and the group's executive committee.

""I am a firm believer that you have to infiltrate from within,"" she told Wednesday's gathering when asked why she took on the advisory position. “For me, it's an opportunity to work with the leaders in your business and make great change.""

LVMH CEO criticizes Greta Thunberg at sustainability event - Quartz,"Thu, 26 Sep 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vcXouY29tLzE3MTY4MjgvbHZtaC1jZW8tY3JpdGljaXplcy1ncmV0YS10aHVuYmVyZy1hdC1zdXN0YWluYWJpbGl0eS1ldmVudNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"At an event touting the sustainability efforts of luxury giant LVMH, the group’s chairman and CEO, Bernard Arnault, criticized teenaged environmental activist Greta Thunberg.

According to Business of Fashion (paywall), Arnault said she is “indulging in an absolute catastrophism about the evolution of the world.” He added: “I find it demoralizing.”

Bloomberg, which also reported from the event, noted that Arnault called the 16-year-old Thunberg a “dynamic young girl” but said her views are “demoralizing for young people.”

They might disagree with that assessment. Though she’s not its only leader, Thunberg has become the de facto face for a movement of millions of young people protesting insufficient action on climate change by world leaders and businesses.

Arnault’s comments came two days after Thunberg delivered an impassioned speech to the UN General Assembly condemning that inaction. One particular comment from her speech drew a response from Arnault. “We are at the beginning of a mass extinction and all you can talk about is money and fairy tales of endless economic growth,” Thunberg said. Noted environmentalist Bill McKibben lauded her for calling out the “fairytale of eternal economic growth.”

At the LVMH event, which included senior executives and employees at the company as well as press, Arnault responded, “If we don’t want to go backwards, we still need growth.” He pointed out that economic growth of the past decades had raised many out of poverty and improved health globally. He said he wanted to focus on what a business like LVMH could do to promote growth while also addressing the problems of climate change.

Arnault has an interest in promoting growth, of course. It’s the astounding growth of the luxury group he built, owner of brands such as Louis Vuitton, Fendi, Moët, Hennessy, and more, that recently propelled him to the status of second-richest person in the world.

That growth is also among the biggest sustainability challenges a business such as LVMH faces. To fuel it, LVMH needs to sell more products, while making them uses up resources and results in more greenhouse gas emissions. The company says it has made good progress on its targets to use more renewable energy and reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 25% across its operations. Though on climate action it still arguably trails its largest rival, French luxury group Kering. The owner of brands such as Gucci and Saint Laurent recently announced a commitment to reduce emissions 50% across its operations and its supply chain, where most of the environmental impact occurs, by 2025.

But Arnault does have a point about economic growth. It’s been instrumental in slashing extreme poverty around the world. As science writer Tom Chivers has pointed out, the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) itself predicts that in 2050 malnutrition will be less of a problem globally than it is today because of economic growth and technological improvements, even as climate change spurs food insecurity and fuels a host of other very serious problems. Poor nations are the ones most likely to suffer from the effects of global warming, but they’re also those that stand most to benefit from the improvements that economic growth brings.

Though how much the expanding fortunes of a French luxury group can play in assisting that growth is debatable, and climate change is itself likely to hamper the sort of growth Arnault wants to see more of.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9995928406715393}",neutral,0.9995928406715393,0
Entrupy Authentication Solution Selected for LVMH Accelerator - WWD,"Wed, 11 Sep 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiOmh0dHBzOi8vd3dkLmNvbS9mZWF0dXJlL2VudHJ1cHktYXV0aGVudGljYXRpb24tMTIwMzI3NDc2MC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"In LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton’s third edition of La Maison des Startups, which received more than 1,000 applicants, U.S.-based product authentication solution Entrupy was among the 26 companies chosen for this season’s program — and the only one focused on product authentication.

Vidyuth Srinivasan, chief executive officer and cofounder of Entrupy, whose solution helps prevent counterfeits from entering the supply chain, expressed his excitement in collaborating with start-ups “who understand the challenges facing the industry.”

Other areas of focus for the participating start-ups include omnichannel logistics, clienteling, in-store experience and personalization. Entrupy is an artificial intelligence-powered app and handheld hardware solution for authentication that operates with 99.1 percent accuracy, founded in 2012 officially.

With a focus on luxury handbags, Entrupy supports verification of 15 luxury brands, including Balenciaga, Chanel, Dior, Fendi, Gucci, Hermès and Louis Vuitton, among others.

A Chanel bag, for example, can warrant as many as 500 data points that are mapped during Entrupy’s guided, hand-held authentication process during which a handful of images are collected. Within minutes, the device tells whether the product is authentic or “unidentifiable,” — not “fake,” as Entrupy must again take in the variances from user error.

Best to retest with a steady hand.

The LVMH accelerator will allow closer collaboration between brand and start-ups such as Entrupy, with a hope to remedy industry pain points as it relates to authentication.

In the U.S. alone, some 35,000 shipments were seized by the U.S. Customs and Border Protection and U.S. Immigration and Customs enforcement agencies in 2017. Of the seized shipments, 15 percent were apparel and accessories.

Entrupy’s solutions are tapped by governments, (including the commercial compliance and consumer protection sector in Dubai), retailers (such as Goodwill Orange County), online marketplaces and manufacturers, in addition to third-party resellers.

Fellow French luxury goods tycoon François Pinault, the founder of Kering, and his son, François-Henri Pinault, the group’s chief executive, are due to sign a deal with the Catholic charity next Monday to donate €100m.

The payments from Arnault and Pinault should extend over several years, in line with restoration needs. As major patrons, the two billionaires will be part of the committee monitoring the restoration project, set up by the French culture minister Franck Riester.

Michel Aupetit, the archbishop of Paris and president of the Fondation Notre Dame, has hailed Arnault and Pinault for their philanthropy. “These contributions are obviously important for this building project, perhaps [the restoration] of the century,” he said in a statement, expressing his “keen and profound gratitude to these great entrepreneurs, as well as to the multitude of other donors”.

Arnault had pledged €200m in the immediate aftermath of the fire that blazed through Notre Dame on 15 April. Amid speculation that his family holding company may benefit from tax breaks, he told LVMH shareholders in April that the firm was ineligible, having reached its limit after building the Louis Vuitton Foundation. France’s court of auditors reported last November that the group benefited from €518m in tax relief for the €790m museum project, under the 60% deductions offered by the 2003 Aillagon law.

Pinault’s holding company Artemis also announced in April that it would not seek tax breaks on its €100m pledge towards the reconstruction of Notre Dame.

The Fondation Notre Dame has received €380m in donations and pledges to date, including €36m from 46,000 individuals, 60 companies and 29 French and foreign public bodies, as well as the contributions from Arnault and Pinault. The Ile-de-France region, which includes Paris, will sign an agreement to donate €10m in October.

The Fondation Notre Dame is one of four bodies designated by the French government to collect donations for the cathedral, alongside the Centre des Monuments Nationaux, the Fondation du Patrimoine and the Fondation de France.

The budget for the current phase of consolidating the Medieval cathedral is estimated at €85m. By mid-October, the Fondation Notre Dame will have transferred €31m to the French culture ministry, including €20m from the major patrons, to foot the bill.

The final cost estimate for the restoration will not be known until next spring, as nine more months are needed to secure the building and complete a full assessment of the damage.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9997865557670593}",neutral,0.9997865557670593,0

Thebe Magugu, the South African designer who launched his namesake label in 2017, has been awarded the 2019 LVMH Prize. Magugu – who was also named the winning designer at London’s International Fashion Showcase earlier this year – will receive a grant of 300,000 euros (about $331,000), as well as a year of “technical and financial support” from the luxury conglomerate.

The prize was decided by a panel of over 60 experts, including Vogue Paris editor-in-chief Emmanuelle Alt, British Vogue editor-in-chief Edward Enninful, supermodel Naomi Campbell, Vogue China editor-in-chief Angelica Cheung and makeup artist Pat McGrath. Magugu was one of eight finalists, alongside the brands Anrealage, Bethany Williams, Bode, Hed Mayner, Kenneth Ize, Phipps and Stefan Cooke. Actor Alicia Vikander presented Magugu with the award.

Israeli designer Hed Mayner was awarded the Karl Lagerfeld Prize, formerly known as the Special Prize, and will receive 150,000 euros (about $165,000) as well as a year of mentorship from LVMH. Three recent fashion graduates – Daisy Yu, of Central Saint Martins, Juliette Tréhorel, of Atelier Chardon Savard, and Alice Paris of Accademia Costume & Moda – will receive a grant of 10,000 euros (about $11,000).

Yu, Tréhorel and Paris will also each join an LVMH brand for a year: Yu will join Louis Vuitton, Tréhorel Dior and Paris Givenchy.

Magugu grew up in Kimberley, South Africa before moving to Johannesburg to study fashion design and photography at the LISOF Fashion School. Speaking to CNN earlier this year, he said his goal was to “create clothes that merge [his] South African heritage with contemporary shapes and proportions.”

The designer debuted his first collection in March 2017, while one of his creations – a faux ostrich coat – has already entered the Fashion Institute of Technology’s permanent collection in New York.

“I come from a very rich culture: there’s a lot of beadwork, a lot of craft. I want to merge these references with my global outlook,” Magugu told in a February 2019 interview. “It’s a project that reflects a more authentic Africa, one that recognizes that we are forward-looking, open to the world.”

“My primary concern is to design clothes that make women feel beautiful but that are also functional,” he said. “And I want my clothes to tell a story, because fashion is such an intelligent medium and I want to make as much use of it as possible.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999971389770508}",neutral,0.9999971389770508,0

The 26-year-old designer, originally from Kimberley, South Africa, is known for his contemporary style and use of local suppliers. He launched his womenswear label in 2016 after studying fashion design, photography and media at the LISOF School of Fashion in Johannesburg. He has operated out of his home, and had never been to Paris before this year.

Magugu will receive a €300,000 grant and a year-long mentorship from executives at the French luxury conglomerate. He said he plans to put the money toward a studio space and to employ more artisans in South Africa.

“Winning the prize means the world to me. €300,000 [goes] a very long way,” said Magugu. “The unemployment rate is 30 percent of the youth in South Africa. That is massive. I want to do my part.”

Earlier this year, Magugu won the overall award for curation and fashion content at the International Fashion Showcase, supported by the British Fashion Council and others before receiving the LVMH Prize from Louis Vuitton's brand ambassador Alicia Vikander on Wednesday at the Louis Vuitton Foundation.

The winner was selected from a shortlist of eight brands, which included a second African brand, Kenneth Ize from Nigerian designer Kenneth Izedonmwen. The six other finalists were Kunihiko Morinaga (Anrealage), Bethany Williams, Emily Adams Bode (Bode), Hed Mayner, Spencer Phipps (Phipps) and Stefan Cooke and Jake Burt (Stefan Cooke).

The decision was made by a jury of industry figures, comprising designers Kris Van Assche, Maria Grazia Chiuri, Jonathan Anderson, Nicolas Ghesquière, Marc Jacobs and Clare Waight Keller alongside Delphine Arnault, the force behind the initiative, Jean-Paul Claverie and Sidney Toledano of LVMH.

Magugu describes his work as “eclectic”.

“South Africa is a place where there are so many dualities. It is both very beautiful and violent. It informed my work,” he said.

He wants to stay in South Africa.

“That’s my mission as a designer. I want to show the world that from South Africa you can get the entire cycle of production,” he said. “There are challenges I am not going to lie, in terms of infrastructure and system but the promise is there. There’s so much talent in the country.”

One of the biggest hurdles he said he faces is logistics. He said he told the jury that he hoped to tap into LVMH’s global network of stores.

“The one thing I really struggle with is distribution, particularly shipping. It’s so easy to import in South Africa but getting out is what’s very tricky,” he said. “[LVMH] really understands how to get a product where it needs to be.”

That impressed at least one of the judges.

“It’s the first time that I listen to someone who has more interest in the infrastructure support that we can bring than the money itself,” said Chiuri. “He has the idea - so young - to develop a global brand.”

He impressed the jury with his feminine, contemporary collection for Spring/Summer 2020 that included a pleated white and red dress, using a specific African mud instead of a print, adding a few agents in the mix so that it doesn’t fade when you wash it.

“It’s about trying to build silhouettes with what you have and how do you make that system work. I think that that money will make that start from the very beginning on the right track,” Anderson said.

“I feel that Africa has some of the best craft,” Anderson added. “For the panel, having someone say ‘I want to make a business in Africa’ was really compelling. I think we are in this moment where it is about giving opportunity, about transformation.”

Having someone say 'I want to make a business in Africa' was really compelling.

Magugu incorporates a microchip in every garment, using an app called Verisium. The technology can be used to display a description of the fabrication, a picture of everyone who worked on the garment and the general story behind the collection.

“The entire story is all in there. Every six months for example, it can send a notification, thus engaging with the consumer,” Waight Keller said.

The newly titled Karl Lagerfeld Prize was also awarded to the Hed Mayner label helmed by its 32-year-old namesake designer. Mayner receives a grant of €150,000 and a year-long mentorship from the LVMH group. Mayner, who studied in Jerusalem and is based in Tel Aviv and Paris, presented a collection involving cotton, linen and a play with proportions.

“His garments feel timeless. There’s something quite poetic,” Waight Keller said.

Mayner, who distributes in 70 stores worldwide, said that the grant will help structure the team. “We are a small team -four including me- so the minute you can hire somebody, it changes the whole environment.”

The LVMH Prize was launched in 2014. The first three recipients were London-based designers who graduated from Central Saint Martins: Thomas Tait, Marques'Almeida and Grace Wales Bonner. In 2017, Paris-based designer Marine Serre scooped the prize while Masayuki Ino of the Japanese streetwear label Doublet was crowned the winner in 2018. Last year the Special Prize was awarded to Rokh, with other previous winners including Simon Porte Jacquemus and Vejas.

The LVMH Prize winner’s collection will be available online at LVMH-owned multi-brand e-commerce platform 24S.com. Some 50 pieces from the collections of the eight finalists are already exclusively available on the site for the occasion.

Stella McCartney Steps Up as LVMH Sustainability Sherpa - WWD,"Wed, 25 Sep 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiigFodHRwczovL3d3ZC5jb20vYnVzaW5lc3MtbmV3cy9idXNpbmVzcy1mZWF0dXJlcy9sdm1oLWFubm91bmNlcy1hbmltYWwtcHJvZHVjdHMtcmF3LW1hdGVyaWFscy1zb3VyY2luZy1jaGFydGVyLXN0ZWxsYS1tY2NhcnRuZXktMTIwMzMxMjg0Ny_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS — Stella McCartney made her first outing as the new public face of LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton’s green initiatives, exhorting the French luxury conglomerate’s key executives on Wednesday to become part of the global conversation about climate crisis.

“I’m not nervous at all,” the British designer quipped as she took the stage with Antoine Arnault, head of communication and image at LVMH, at the “Future Life” event, where the group revealed it was launching a raw materials sourcing charter for animal products such as fur and leather.

McCartney, who split from French rival Kering last year after a 17-year partnership, revealed in July she had sold a minority stake in her brand to LVMH, which has appointed her as special adviser to its chairman and chief executive officer Bernard Arnault and executive committee members.

Antoine Arnault asked the famously vegan designer, who was making her first appearance at the LVMH headquarters on Avenue Montaigne, whether she was hesitant about joining forces with the group, given that its luxury houses — including Louis Vuitton, Dior, Fendi and Celine — work with fur and leather.

“I’m a firm believer that you have to infiltrate from within,” she replied, to laughter and applause. “And so obviously to be personal adviser on sustainability to Monsieur Arnault, I take as a huge privilege, and the opportunity of really dramatic, impactful change is the most exciting thing that I could ever have dreamt of.”

The designer said growing up on an organic farm with her parents, Paul and Linda McCartney, had prepared her for the most effective part of her job, which is working with suppliers. “I’m excited to bring the solutions that I’ve worked on for maybe 23 years now,” she said.

“I’m not going to pretend that what I do is easy. If it was easy, I think more people would be doing it. But I personally don’t see it as a constraint. I see it as a huge inspiration. You know, we’re having this conversation in a week of climate crisis and the entire world is talking about this, and people are practicing this in their lives, so why shouldn’t they be able to practice it in their place of work?” McCartney asked.

Noting that LVMH launched its environmental division 27 years ago, Bernard Arnault said the group was committed to accelerating its work in the field. “Today, protecting the environment is no longer an option,” he said. “We have to accentuate our leadership on environmental issues. We have the legitimacy to do so.”

By 2025, LVMH will ensure full traceability for animal products, compliance with the most advanced animal welfare standards for 100 percent of raw materials, and a reduction of the environmental impact of the processing of all animal-based materials, it said.

The group also touted its progress on meeting its 2020 targets for reducing carbon dioxide emissions and using renewable energy, saying CO2 emissions fell by 16 percent between 2013 and 2018, even as its revenues increased from 29 billion euros to 47 billion euros.

LVMH is joining a chorus of green initiatives at Paris Fashion Week, where everyone from buzzy young designers to high-end brands, industry federations, tech entrepreneurs and governments officials are vying to take the lead on sustainability issues — starting at the top with French President Emmanuel Macron.

Bernard Arnault sided with Macron in warning that climate activist Greta Thunberg risked discouraging young people with her alarmist world view. After her blistering speech at the U.N. Climate Summit on Monday, Thunberg filed a complaint against five countries, including France, for not doing enough to ward off global warming.

The LVMH chief said while the Swedish teenager was a spokeswoman for her generation and was right to address the urgent issue of climate change, he regretted that she failed to offer any solutions.

“She has an unremittingly pessimistic view of the world, and I think that’s depressing for young people. All she does is criticize,” he said. “I’m impressed by young people with solutions, ambitions and optimism, because at the end of the day, I’m convinced we will get through this.”

As part of the event spotlighting the achievements and objectives of its LVMH Initiatives for the Environment, or LIFE, program, the group invited the heads of brands including Louis Vuitton, Fendi, Loro Piana, Guerlain, Loewe and Christian Dior Parfums to talk about how they’re helping to protect the environment.

Maria Grazia Chiuri, artistic director of women’s collections at Dior, described her collaboration with the Paris-based landscape and urbanism collective Coloco on the set for her show, held the previous day, which featured 164 trees that will subsequently be replanted in four locations in and around the French capital.

“What makes us at Louis Vuitton very proud is that we participated in the repopulation of the American alligator,” said Michael Burke, chairman and ceo of Louis Vuitton. Laurent Boillot, president and ceo of Guerlain, highlighted its efforts to protect bees. “No bees, no flowers. No flowers, no Guerlain,” he summed up.

LVMH noted that 48 percent of the leather used by its houses is sourced in tanneries certified by the Leather Working Group, a multistakeholder group that aims to promote sustainable environmental business practices within the leather industry. This proportion should rise to 70 percent by the end of 2019, it added.

Its new sourcing charter, which covers fur, leather, exotic leather, wool and feathers, sets out commitments under three pillars: traceability of origin; farming and trapping conditions, and respect for workers, the environment and biodiversity.

The LVMH standard for responsible crocodile leather sourcing, unveiled in February, is also part of the new charter. As part of the project, the group has appointed a scientific committee to assess research and pilot scientific projects.

“We keep a cool head in environmental matters as in other issues. We don’t want to cave in to any short-lived ideologies. Before embarking on an environmental project, we study the scientific rationale for taking action,” said Bernard Arnault.

LVMH said it would likely exceed its targets for 2020, which include using 30 percent renewable energy, and reducing its CO2 emissions by 25 percent compared with 2013.

The group also detailed how it will allot the 10 million euros it pledged toward safeguarding the Amazon rain forest, after images of raging wildfires shocked the public over the summer.

Half the sum will go toward operational assistance to fight fires, and the rest to a special project within the Man & Biosphere partnership between UNESCO and LVMH signed last June, focused on fire management.

The group has signed a strategic partnership with the Solar Impulse Foundation designed to find innovative and efficient clean technologies to combat environmental issues. It will hold a second edition of the “Future Life” event, focused on the U.S. market, in New York City on Oct. 24.

The LVMH event came a day after Kering said the entire group would become carbon-neutral within its own operations and across the entire supply chain. Kering pledged to offset its annual greenhouse gas emissions from 2018.

The group has previously said it is targeting a 50 percent reduction in its carbon emissions by 2025, and in May published new animal welfare standards.

Hermès, meanwhile, expects to become carbon-neutral within its own operations by 2020, its ceo Axel Dumas told reporters earlier this month. “We are a global group in terms of revenues, but our carbon emissions are equivalent to those of a small or medium-sized business,” he said.

All these announcements come as the French Senate is examining a draft law that would prevent companies from destroying unsold clothing, potentially setting new standards that could become a blueprint for the industry. The measure fits into the country’s broader roadmap for a circular economy.

Kering spearheaded the “Fashion Pact,” signed by 32 companies and presented by its ceo, François-Henri Pinault, in August at the G7 Summit in Biarritz, France, pledging to eliminate single-use plastics, use renewable energy and promote regenerative agriculture practices, among other commitments.

Signatories include high-street retailers H&M and Zara-owner Inditex; sportswear labels Adidas and Nike; American-based companies Capri Holdings Ltd., Gap Inc., PVH Corp., Ralph Lauren Corp. and Tapestry Inc.; European luxury groups Chanel, Hermès, Prada, Ferragamo, Giorgio Armani and Burberry, and Asia-based Fung Group.

McCartney is also a signatory, while LVMH declined to sign. Antoine Arnault said it did not make sense for the group to be lumped together with fast-fashion and sportswear brands, especially because its activities extend to areas as diverse as winemaking and hospitality.

“We have nothing against them, but we have nothing in common with Nike, Zara, Gap and H&M,” he said. “We’re not in the habit of signing pieces of paper to ease our conscience. We prefer acts to pacts.”

With consumers ratcheting up the pressure, McCartney exhorted the group’s executives to step up their efforts internally.

“I guess my advice is listen to your children. I think that we work in an industry that’s so much about numbers, it’s so much about targeting people, targeting a generation. You don’t have to target anyone, you just need to listen to your children and look around, and observe what’s happening,” she said.

“Take pride in making change, because you want to be part of the conversation — you don’t want to be left behind,” she concluded.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9997493624687195}",neutral,0.9997493624687195,0

LVMH bought a minority stake in Stella McCartney's ethical fashion brand in July

The designer is also serving as an advisor to LVMH leadership and the public face of the conglomerate's environmental efforts

LVMH is the world’s largest luxury conglomerate, but has lagged other major fashion companies in addressing the industry’s impact on the environment. Archrival Kering - which owned 50 percent of McCartney's label until last year - is pitching itself as a global leader on sustainability. Meanwhile, LVMH says it's in favor of ""acts not pacts,"" a direct attack on Kering's Fashion Pact, and LVMH chairman Bernard Arnault has criticised teen climate activist Greta Thunberg as ""demoralising."" This gap is likely one reason why the conglomerate took a stake in Stella McCartney's brand and named the designer a special advisor on sustainability to Arnault and the group's executive committee. Last week, she described her mission as to "" infiltrate from within. "" Her main role for now is to act as the public face of LVMH's sustainability efforts, starting with Monday's show. McCartney hasn't revealed her plans, but some sort of statement is likely, as so many designers now routinely mix social issues and fashion on the runway.

The Bottom Line: LVMH likely expects McCartney's sustainability message to perform double duty, helping to grow the brand's sales globally while burnishing the conglomerate's reputation.

Dover Street Market Branches Into Beauty

Dover Street Market is opening its first beauty shop in Paris on Oct. 2

Consultant and Colette founder Sarah Andelman Comme des Garçons

The luxury fashion mecca has also launched a brand incubator, Dover Street Market Paris

It's not enough to merely be a retailer these days, and Dover Street Market is the latest wholesaler looking to expand its horizons. The mini-chain of luxury multi-brand boutiques is applying its strength as a curator of high-end products to a new market, stocking a new Paris shop with ultra-trendy fragrances and beauty lines from the likes of Edward Bess and Gucci Westman, as well as exclusive products. To curate its assortment, the retailer hired Sarah Andelman, former creative director of Colette, the Parisian concept store renowned for its selection and displays, which closed in 2017. The luxury beauty business is booming, and so are retailers like Dover Street Market that can convince consumers they are ""destinations"" and brand platforms of their own rather than mere stores.

The Bottom Line: Retailers need to build their reputations as curators and brand builders as the appeal of the wholesale model wanes. A similar goal drove Farfetch's $675 million acquisition of New Guards Group earlier this year, bringing the incubator behind Off-White and Heron Preston in house.

The Business of Fashion

This year's theme is inclusivity, both assessing the industry's track record and exploring how progress can be achieved

The event in Paris will feature discussions about the industry's progress and shortcomings on this front, plus musical performances and more

The fashion industry has spent much of the last year lurching from PR crisis to PR crisis, whether it's Gucci's ""blackface"" balaclava sweater or Nike's Betsy Ross flag sneakers. The common thread tying these incidents together is inclusivity - or lack thereof. After each misstep, brands have acknowledged their lack of internal diversity, which has in turn hampered their ability to communicate to an increasingly diverse customer base. But there's more to it than that: inclusivity is also good for innovation. This year, our BoF 500 special print issue takes a close look at the industry's track record when it comes to inclusivity, as well as the innovators, artists and businesspeople who are moving the conversation forward. The issue will be released, along with new additions to our BoF 500 community, at a gala event at the Hôtel de Ville in Paris this Monday night.

The Bottom Line: The fashion industry is slowing waking up to the fact that inclusivity is not just a matter of being politically correct and avoiding PR scandals; it's also good for business.

Thebe Magugu Wins the 2019 LVMH Prize for Young Designers - WWD,"Wed, 04 Sep 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vd3dkLmNvbS9mZWF0dXJlL3RoZWJlLW1hZ3VndS13aW5zLTIwMTktbHZtaC1wcml6ZS0xMjAzMjUyMTczL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS — Thebe Magugu on Wednesday became the first African designer to win the LVMH Prize for Young Designers, underscoring the continent’s potent appeal as a source of both creative talent and future luxury consumers.

“Tomb Raider” star Alicia Vikander, speaking in French, revealed the winner at the Fondation Louis Vuitton in the presence of jury members including Dior’s Maria Grazia Chiuri, Louis Vuitton’s Nicolas Ghesquière, Clare Waight Keller of Givenchy, Loewe artistic director Jonathan Anderson and Berluti’s Kris Van Assche.

The South African women’s wear designer beat some 1,700 applicants from 100 countries to walk away with a grand prize of 300,000 euros, plus a year of coaching from experts at luxury giant LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, parent of brands including Vuitton, Guerlain, Dom Pérignon and Sephora.

“I really couldn’t believe it,” an elated Magugu told WWD after the ceremony. “I have the deepest respect for LVMH and the brands it houses, because I’ve looked up to every single one of them since high school days, so to be recognized in this way is a very deep honor.”

At 26, he was the youngest designer in the competition and one of two Africans to make the list of eight finalists, alongside Nigerian designer Kenneth Ize.

While Magugu considered the win symbolic, he was quick to point out that he represents a deep well of untapped creativity. “There are so many brilliant designers in South Africa, in Africa in general, who are doing such incredible work, so yes, even if it is a win, it’s always just been there anyway,” he said.

It was the first edition of the prize held since the death of Karl Lagerfeld, the doyen of LVMH designers, who was creative director at Fendi for a record 54 years.

The runner-up Special Prize, renamed the Karl Lagerfeld Prize in his honor, went to Israeli designer Hed Mayner, underscoring the growing importance of talents from outside the traditional fashion capitals of Paris, Milan, New York and London.

Mayner, who has won plaudits for his gender-fluid designs that play on proportions and layering, will receive 150,000 euros and a one-year mentorship program provided by a dedicated LVMH team offering expertise in such areas as intellectual property, sourcing, production, distribution, image, communication and marketing.

“It’s a very open prize, and the beauty of it is also to have amazing talents like them, who are not very well-known, win the prize and be able to develop their business thanks to LVMH,” said Delphine Arnault, the force behind the award and a key talent scout at the group.

“That’s really the specificity of the prize: it’s not about nationalities. You can apply from anywhere in the world. The only thing you need to have is basically a computer,” she said, noting the competition was open to anyone between the ages of 18 and 40 who has commercialized at least two collections.

Magugu’s collection, titled African Studies, blended the codes of men’s and women’s wear with a mix of tailored silhouettes in sturdy outerwear fabrics and fluid pleated silhouettes, some printed with entries from the journals in which he used to record his nightmares as a child.

Arnault noted that the clothes were a combination of the traditional and the experimental, playing with volumes and South African know-how.

“The philosophy of the LVMH prize is to find a super-creative talent who has a lot of potential and to help them grow,” she said. “I think that’s going to bring a lot of awareness to his brand and it’s going to help him grow his business. The potential is really there — he’s extremely talented.”

Sidney Toledano, chairman and chief executive officer of LVMH Fashion Group and a member of the prize jury, lauded the “excellent” quality and “maturity” of the winners — plus the storytelling, sustainability and technology baked into their collections. But he said none of that overshadowed the strong design appeal of their clothes.

“It’s better to be sustainable today and so on, but at the end you have to create the desire — and both of them achieved that,” Toledano said.

Ghesquière said he was impressed by Magugu’s commitment to building a business in Johannesburg, where he lives.

“His wish is to stay at home, stay in his country and develop an international brand, and I think that made a big echo during the presentation: to really have this new language, not to migrate to a big fashion capital to get credit — to be very brave and to try to build a house elsewhere,” he said.

The Vuitton designer said the jury was aware of breaking new ground by spotlighting a talent from Africa, a hitherto neglected source of fashion inspiration. “We are conscious of everything. This world is absolutely evolving quickly and it’s amazing, especially with news like today, so yes, we are a part of this world,” he said.

Waight Keller noted that LVMH could help Magugu resolve hurdles such as exporting his clothes. “We wanted just to say that this prize is about giving opportunity and really to invest in people that we think are going to make a difference where they come from,” the Givenchy designer said.

Magugu said he planned to expand his staff of three. “Up until now it’s just been me and those three people, and a lot of it is on me, from a lot of bookkeeping to the drafting of the patterns to some of the cutting, so it’ll be really great to breathe for the first time and get people to occupy those positions, and then I’ll also get a studio where I can work really comfortably from,” he said.

With just five wholesale accounts, he also plans to meet key buyers at the NOB showroom in Paris later this month, though he has no plans to show abroad soon.

“I really don’t want to do anything grand with this money. I really want to look at what my immediate needs are and use the money toward that. Making sure the foundation is solid will allow me one day to show at the main capitals’ fashion weeks,” Magugu explained.

It is the second award this year for Magugu, who also won the overall award for curation and fashion content at the International Fashion Showcase in London in February.

His win coincides with a surge in interest in African design, from Beyoncé wearing Senegalese label Tongoro in her “Spirit” video to Naomi Campbell investing in Arise Fashion Week in Lagos, where she also walked in several shows last April.

Bernard Arnault, the chairman and ceo of LVMH, is taking notice. The most recent issue of Eyes, the luxury conglomerate’s in-house magazine, quotes consultant Coralie Omgba as forecasting the continent’s market for luxury goods — worth $5.9 billion in 2017 — will grow by 30 percent in the next five years

In April, LVMH’s Dior brand chartered two planes to fly guests to its cruise show in Marrakech. In addition to being a striking display of corporate might — the fashion spectacle at the El Badi Palace featured more than 110 looks — it also acted as a showcase for guest designers from Africa and beyond.

Magugu’s work has frequently tackled political issues. The shirt he wore to collect his prize featured an illustration by Phathu Nembilwi alluding to a series of highly publicized femicides in South Africa, while his latest collection referenced the Black Sash women’s resistance movement during the apartheid era.

“I think people are very interested in things outside of Europe and America. I think with places, for example like South Africa, there’s so many things that people don’t know at all. I think there’s an entirely new style and even design lexicon,” he noted.

“My collection is about the women of the Black Sash, and up until now, people didn’t really know who they are, but after telling them, they’re just so blown away by the contributions they had to South Africa. So I think there’s just newness from emerging markets and places the world is just hungry for,” Magugu added.

Mayner, the first Israeli to make the final round of the competition, agreed. “I think that other places in the world have a place now, and there is interest from the capitals in what is happening in other places, and it’s wonderful,” he said.

The Tel Aviv-based designer, who has 70 points of sale worldwide, plans to open a studio in Paris, where he shows his collections. “It means that I can be more focused on the creative aspect and have help in other matters,” he said of the prize money.

In addition to Ize, the other finalists, selected by a committee of 63 fashion industry experts, were Anrealage, designed by Kunihiko Morinaga; Bethany Williams; Bode by Emily Adams Bode; Phipps by Spencer Phipps, and Stefan Cooke by Stefan Cooke and Jake Burt.

Delphine Arnault noted they shared a focus on green issues. “The environment and sustainability and upcycling: all these themes are extremely important to them,” the executive said.

She lamented the absence of Lagerfeld, who championed the prize from its launch in 2013, frequently recalling that his career took off after he won a Woolmark prize alongside Yves Saint Laurent in 1954.

“We miss him a lot. Fashion misses him a lot. The prize is never going to be the same without him. He was really generous with his time, with his advice,” Arnault said.

“He was so nice to those young designers. He was always coming to the showroom in March and it was two days before his show, but he came for one hour, he said hello to everybody, saw the work of everybody,” she added.

The past five winners of the main prize are Thomas Tait, Marques’ Almeida, Grace Wales Bonner, Marine Serre and Doublet’s Masayuki Ino, and the award has also boosted the careers of its runner-up special-prize winners: Hood by Air, Miuniku, Jacquemus, Vejas, Kozaburo Akasaka and Rok Hwang’s Rokh label.

The prize-giving ceremony, traditionally held in June, was postponed this year, with a source familiar with the situation citing calendar conflicts among some of the senior executives and designers expected to attend the event. LVMH plans to hold the next edition in June 2020.

For the first time this year, online retailer 24S — formerly known as 24 Sèvres — has launched a capsule collection of outfits designed by the finalists, which it celebrated with a cocktail party at Paris institution Lapérouse on Tuesday night.

Eric Goguey, ceo of 24S, said the collection appealed to the site’s most fashion-forward customers. “They are fashion enthusiasts who are interested by these kinds of pieces because they are slightly unusual and none of their friends will be wearing them. It’s important for our image to have all these young designers,” he said.

He explained that each designer contributed as many pieces as he was able to deliver. Magugu offered 13 references, more than any other designer, noting that his tiny production structure was actually an advantage when producing small orders.

“It’s just me and my machinist — he’s exceptionally good at creating garments. It was three to four units per style, so we just had to plan it out,” Magugu said. “I know some other designers can only start at a certain number, but I can really start at the very bottom because the production is set up in such a way.”

He was gratified to learn from the 24S team that his pieces were among the bestsellers. “I really just want to show the world that all this can be made in South Africa. For them to have such good feedback really means quite a lot to me and it’s pushing me, in a way,” the designer said.

Nonetheless, Magugu said Africa has a long way to go in terms of building the infrastructure to support its burgeoning fashion industry. “It’s one thing to say, ‘Our time is now,’ but there’s still a lot of work to do,” he concluded.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999001026153564}",neutral,0.9999001026153564,0

Bernard Arnault, CEO of luxury fashion house LVMH, has publically criticised activist Greta Thunberg in relation to her speech last Wednesday at the United Nations, Reuters reports. Arnault derided her lack of optimism on climate issues, describing her message as “demoralising”, subsequently backing the efforts of the fashion industry towards a more sustainable future.

On Wednesday, teen climate activist Greta Thunberg delivered a moving speech on the climate emergency we are facing as a planet. In the speech, Thunberg appeared emotional as she spoke scathingly about the international approach to the environment, saying,

“People are suffering. People are dying. Entire ecosystems are collapsing. We are in the beginning of a mass extinction, and all you can talk about is money and fairy tales of eternal economic growth. How dare you!”

The leader of the luxury fashion brand LVMH, responsible for designer labels like Dior, Givenchy and Louis Vuitton, hit back at the speech. He spoke out in defense of LVMH’s sustainable credentials of late, which include a partnership with UNESCO back in March and Dior’s environmentally themed “garden” catwalk at Paris Fashion Week this season for example. Arnault said Thunberg’s approach was overly pessimistic, Reuters reports, describing her words as “doom-mongering.”

The world’s biggest luxury goods conglomerate has revealed it is in the process of cutting carbon emissions, much like Kering-owned Gucci, who this week went fully carbon neutral as London Fashion Week began. LVMH has also pledged to ensure full traceability for all of its raw materials by 2025.

Arnault told journalists that he preferred “positive solutions that allow us to get towards a more optimistic position”, as opposed to what he views as negative rhetoric put forth by Greta Thunberg. The French chairman went on to say that her vision “has a demoralising side to it for young people”, concluding, “she’s not proposing anyway, aside from criticism.”

A UK spokesperson from Greenpeace told Euronews Living following the news,

""Greta Thunberg's actions have inspired millions of young people to do what their parents' generation should have done but failed to - taking responsibility for their future. If there's anything depressing and demoralising, it's the fashion industry's huge impact on our planet.""

According to the same spokesperson, each year the equivalent of 1.2 billion tonnes of CO2 is contributed by the textile industry, more than international flights and shipping combined. He added that £140m worth of clothes goes to landfill every year in the UK alone, concluding ""If Bernand Arnault's own industry made some real progress in cutting waste and climate-warming emissions, we would all have good reasons for cheering up.""","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9979362487792969}",neutral,0.9979362487792969,0

Bernard Arnault, president of LVMH, announced yesterday all the actions that the group plans to carry out in terms of animal protection. The announcement was made at an meeting with the management team, the first one that Stella McCartney attended.

The owner of Louis Vuitton anticipated the launch of a charter to regulate the raw materials of animal origin used by the group, which goes from tracking the origins of the leather and fur to guaranteeing certain standards of animal welfare.

By 2025, LVMH plans to offer full traceability of its animal-origin products and reduce the environmental impact during the production process of this type of items.

The announcement of this new initiative comes just two months after LVMH bought a stake in Stella McCartney, one of the benchmarks of sustainability in the luxury sector and a pioneer in eliminating the use of fur and leather from its collections.

In the span of just one day alone last month, the U.S. Customs and Border Protection reported the seizure of 5,300 counterfeit goods at LAX, including a total of 1,263 fake handbags. In 2017, total handbag and wallet seizures were valued at $234,451,926 USD.

LVMH’s third edition of its La Maison des Startups program took note of this growing industry issue by selecting authentication service Entrupy as one of 26 companies that will participate in the incubator. Founded in 2012, Entrupy is an artificial intelligence app and handheld device that aims to help stop counterfeits from entering the supply chain. Of the 26 companies selected by LVMH, the startup is the only one that addresses product authentication.

Entrupy focuses on luxury handbags and is currently able to verify 15 different brands, including Balenciaga, Chanel, Dior, Fendi, Gucci, Hermès and Louis Vuitton. During its guided authentication process, the artificial intelligence system collects a series of images based on around 500 data points per bag to determine whether the item is authentic or not. A result is announced within four seconds, and the system has proven to be 99.1 percent accurate.

Through participating in LVMH’s startup program, Entrupy will be exposed to more collaboration opportunities with government organizations, retailers, online stores and even third-party resellers in hopes of combating the thriving counterfeit market.

Peter Lindbergh Has Passed Away (Instagram)

Legendary fashion photographer Peter Lindbergh passed away yesterday at the age of 74. The news was announced on his official Instagram account. Lindbergh shot for Vogue as far back as the 1970s, but he exploded into prominence in the late ’80s for his photographs of the supers. Particularly, his January ’90 cover of British Vogue, which featured Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista, Tatjana Patitz, Christy Turlington, and Cindy Crawford and is considered the kick-off to the era of the supermodel.

Louis Vuitton brings fashion to League of Legends video game - Style,"Wed, 25 Sep 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjbXAuY29tL21hZ2F6aW5lcy9zdHlsZS9sdXh1cnkvYXJ0aWNsZS8zMDMwMjYzL3doeS1sb3Vpcy12dWl0dG9uLWRyZXNzaW5nLXlvdXItZmF2b3VyaXRlLWxlYWd1ZS1sZWdlbmRz0gF0aHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAuc2NtcC5jb20vbWFnYXppbmVzL3N0eWxlL2x1eHVyeS9hcnRpY2xlLzMwMzAyNjMvd2h5LWxvdWlzLXZ1aXR0b24tZHJlc3NpbmcteW91ci1mYXZvdXJpdGUtbGVhZ3VlLWxlZ2VuZHM?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"While a Ghesquiere dress might normally cost a few thousand dollars, skins typically sell for US$9 to US$25. It’s the first time that Riot Games has let a luxury brand place designs within its games.

The creative director of French fashion house Louis Vuitton is designing clothing for characters in the popular fantasy video game League of Legends, part of a new partnership between the LVMH unit and publisher Riot Games. The first of these outfits, called skins in gaming parlance, will be unveiled during the League of Legends World Championships, which take place in Paris in October and November.

The partnership, which also features a small collection of Ghesquiere-designed real-world clothing, comes as Riot Games has pushed the League of Legends brand into other parts of the entertainment world.

The approach, similar to one taken by Fortnite maker Epic Games Inc., is intended to broaden the audience beyond gaming circles. League of Legends is part of a storyline on the HBO show Ballers. The company worked with The Simpsons on a recent episode and partnered with Marvel to produce comic books around characters from the game.

As part of the Louis Vuitton partnership, the fashion house is designing a carrying case for the League of Legends World Championship trophy, known as the Summoner’s Cup. The company already makes a travel case for the World Cup, the biggest sporting event on the soccer calendar.

The League of Legends World Championship finals last year drew 99.6 million unique viewers. The event is “where the world of sports and entertainment come together in celebration of new legends to be born,” said Louis Vuitton chairman Michael Burke. “Louis Vuitton has long been associated with the world’s most coveted trophies, and here we are today, alongside the Summoner’s Cup.”

This isn’t Louis Vuitton’s first foray into digital clothing. In 2016, the company started using characters from the popular sci-fi game Final Fantasy as models. It also designed an outfit for Japanese hologram pop singer Hatsune Miku.

Not only does it attach a sense of comfort and approachability to an otherwise untouchable figure, it also provides hopeful inspiration and confidence to a wide population of civilians who love to get dressed.

Michael Fassbender, majestic in his own right, came up for air Wednesday at the LVMH Prize for Young Fashion Designers 2019 Event. The shirt he is wearing costs $79.50. The shoes he is wearing cost $95. The moment he has graced us with is priceless.

What's so admirable is not just that Fassbender dressed affordably for an event—it's that he dressed affordably for this event, and still managed to look the part of someone attending an event honoring such high levels of fashion brilliance. On the surface, his look is subdued and chic. Underneath, he's wearing workwear and Allbirds sneakers. It is inspiring. It is a high-low masterpiece.

Madewell Button-Down Workshirt Madewell Button-Down Workshirt Now 31% Off $55 at Madewell

The shirt is from Madwell's relatively new menswear line, and it's one of the brand's top sellers. Its textural cotton twill and double pockets say Blue Collar. Its crisp white collar says...White Collar. The streamlined shirt is a high-low mix in its own right. It's the kind of shirt you can wear however you want. Keep it unbuttoned with a graphic tee underneath. Roll up the sleeves, or leave them down. Beat it up—wash it as much as you want and watch as it wears into perfection. Button it all the way up with a pair of chinos. Hell, slap a tie on this bad boy and wear it with one of your more rugged looking suits.

Allbirds Tree Loungers Allbirds Tree Loungers $95 at Allbirds

The shoes are from Allbirds' follow-up to its widely popular runners, endorsed by Esquire and Barack Freakin' Obama. Allbirds' calls their Tree Loungers a breathable co-pilot. I call them Michael Fassbender's DGAF flex of the century.

The entire fit is wholly inspiring to any and every person looking to put together a solid outfit. You can wear this look anywhere—yes, even a capital-F Fashion event. Michael Fassbender, as we wears it, exudes eternal cool—he is Michael Fassbender, after all. But get yourself a full enough mustache and a solid pair of black sunglasses, and maybe—just maybe—you might walk with the swagger of a thousand suns, too.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999047517776489}",neutral,0.9999047517776489,0

Every year, the prestigious LVMH Prize for Young Fashion Designers awards a Grand Prize, alongside a secondary special prize and recognition of three graduates.

The secondary prize was renamed earlier this year to be the Karl Lagerfeld Prize, in memory of the designer who died in February this year aged 85.

Alongside Mayner, South African-designer Thebe Magugu took home the Grand Prize for 2019.

Delphine Arnault, director and executive vice president of Louis Vuitton, started the prize schemes to ""recognise the emergence of fresh talent is essential to the vitality and diversity of the fashion ecosystem"".

Since the launch of the prize in 2014, Lagerfeld was a returning member of the Louis Vuitton Moët Hennessy (LVMH) jury panel whilst working as artistic director of houses Chanel and Fendi.

Winners of both the grand and Karl Lagerfeld prizes were chosen from eight finalists, where each applicant is required to be under the age of 40 have sold two previous collections in either women's or men's wear.

The judges' pick for the Karl Lagerfeld Prize went to Hed Mayner who ""seduced the jury"" with layered shirts worn underneath boxy, oversized suit jackets that created the voluminous silhouettes of his gender-neutral collection.

""His collections question the notion of gender through an aesthetic that blends soft lines and structure, simplicity and luxury,"" said Arnault.

26-year-old designer Thebe Magugu marks another first for the LVMH Prize as the first African and youngest candidate to be awarded the Grand Prize.

Based in Johannesburg, Magugu's winning womenswear collection titled Prosopography was created in homage to the Black Sash – a ""revolutionary group of women"" who fought for the rights and dignity for people of colour during the apartheid.

""My mission as a designer is to build a global fashion brand that acts as a sort of sanctuary women can turn to for not only beautiful and functional clothes, but a place to learn about our culture and heritage, reinterpreted through a modern lens,"" he explained in a post on Instagram.

Arnault praised his work, saying his collection appropriates the traditional and the experimental codes of womenswear and menswear, playing with volumes and traditional South-African know-how.

As winner of the Grand Prize, Magugu will receive a €300,000 grant, in addition to one year of mentorship working with a designated LVMH team.

Israeli designer, and first winner of the renamed Karl Lagerfeld Prize, Mayner will receive €150,000 and a mentorship programme.

Through the mentorship scheme, both will be taught and advised in skills to help future businesses, including production, distribution and sustainable development.

Paris, September 25 2019 (AFP) - International luxury giant announced on Wednesday that it will take over, through its company , the eyewear production for Christian , once the licence deal with Italian group will expire in December 2020, officialising news reported this summer by FashionNetwork.com.







Fall/Winter 2019-20 eyewear collection by Dior - JANETTE BECKMAN



In partnership with Marcolin, another Italian eyewear group, LVMH set up a joint-venture company called Thélios in 2018, with the goal of controlling its eyewear supply chain directly by internalising production, a break with the long-established practice of licensing - the manufacturing and especially commercialisation of eyewear by third parties.



Thélios operates a factory in Italy, north of Venice, where it already produces eyewear for many LVMH labels, like , , Fred, and .

On Wednesday, Thélios announced the signing of “a partnership deal for the design, production and distribution of Dior eyewear worldwide.” Within LVMH, Christian Dior is the most important label, in volume and value terms, for the sunglasses and eyeglasses category.



“The first Dior eyewear collection developed with Thélios will be presented in January 2021, with the spring/summer season, and will become available at Dior stores worldwide and at select retailers belonging to Thélios’s network,” indicated the press release.



The name ‘Thélios’ is a contraction (in French) of ‘Théia’, the goddess of sight, and ‘Hélios’, the sun god. The factory has an output capacity of up to 1.5 million pairs of glasses per year. A second, adjoining plant, currently under construction, will enable Thélios’s capacity to increase to over 4.5 million pairs.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999926090240479}",neutral,0.9999926090240479,0

The winner was selected by a jury of industry figures including Kris Van Assche, Maria Grazia Chiuri, Jonathan Anderson, Nicolas Ghesquière, Marc Jacobs, and Clare Waight Keller, alongside Delphine Arnault, Jean-Paul Claverie, and Sidney Toledano of LVMH. Previous winners include Marine Serre, Marques’Almeida, and Jacquemus, while finalists have included Virgil Abloh, Molly Goddard, Demna Gvasalia, and Syrian designer Nabil El Nayal.

“It’s an incredible honor,” Magugu says. “I have had the deepest respect for LVMH for the longest time because they house brands I’ve looked up to forever. To be part of this incredible initiative means the world to me.”

The 26-year-old Magugu, whose eponymous brand is based in Johannesburg, hails from Kimberley, a small mining town in South Africa’s Northern Cape province. After studying fashion design at LISOF in Johannesburg and winning best graduate collection, he worked in the local fashion industry for two years before launching his womenswear brand, THEBE MAGUGU.

His collections are personal and empathetic, inspired by the lived experiences of South African women, especially those who have played important roles in his life. “I’ve always been surrounded by women,” he recently told T Magazine. “Independent, strong, headstrong women at that.” His designs also highlight his love and respect for education, with collection names like Home Economics and African Studies. Magugu also told T that he aims to “create an African brand with truly international implications,” and the prize will help propel that dream forward. As this year’s winner, he will receive a €300 000 grant and a year-long mentorship under LVMH executives. He’ll also have a collection made available online at LVMH-owned multi-brand e-commerce platform 24S.com, where a selection of designs by this year’s finalists are already available for purchase.

“I think they [LVMH] are very interested in the cultural aspect of my work, and I think it goes over and above the exoticism people feel for brands coming from emerging markets,” Magugu says about his win. “I think they’re interested in the stories and everything I was saying with the collection but it was also good-quality products that they enjoyed, so it’s those two worlds coming together.”

Of Magugu’s win, Grazia Chiuri commented, “I’m very happy because I think this guy has a vision, very precise, about his creativity. He really believes in creating a wardrobe for women.”

Receiving the Jury Prize, now known as the Karl, was designer Hed Mayner, who will also receive a year-long mentorship from LVMH, along with a grant of €150 000. The other finalists included Kunihiko Morinaga (Anrealage), Bethany Williams, Emily Adams Bode (Bode), Kenneth Izedonmwen (Kenneth Ize), Spencer Phipps (Phipps), and Stefan Cooke and Jake Burt (Stefan Cooke). Magugu and Izedonmwen are the first African designers to be selected for both the shortlist and the finals of the competition.

As an exclusive purveyor of Dior and CELINE online, the shopping destination also features brands such as Balenciaga, Givenchy, Prada, Gucci, Fendi and more. Today, 24S launches the new menswear site with a 20-brand collaboration that includes 40 exclusive pieces from luxury fashion labels.

Eric Goguey, 24S Chief Executive Officer, explains the new addition of menswear to the online platform:

“We believe that there was a gap in the market for menswear fashion with a highly curated but uncomplicated point of view. Our approach to menswear recognizes that wanting to look good, feel good, stand out from the pack and blend into the crowd don’t necessarily have to be mutually exclusive components of men’s style. To us, launching menswear simply means adapting to the versatile needs of a man’s daily life today.”

The menswear site will reflect the constantly evolving expectations of an urban consumer while maintaining the style, quality and effortlessness of Parisian fashion. 24S will focus on exclusive releases for its menswear site, along with regular brand capsules and limited-edition releases. Maud Barrionuevo, Global Buying Director for 24S, says that the collaboration with 20 brands is “representative of our overarching menswear buy: we chose to work alongside brands who are already well established in the menswear space like Dior, Off- White and Prada, as well as quintessentially Parisian labels which we love, such as APC and Ami.”

In October 2014, LVMH Moët Hennessy – Louis Vuitton SE (hereafter LVMH) invested 61 billion won (approximately $51.6 million) in redeemable convertible preference shares (RCPS) of YG Entertainment. At the time of investment, LVMH set the option of converting into common stock at 43,574 won (approximately $36.83) per share or a repayment of 67 billion won (approximately $56.6 million), which includes annual interest, after five years.

If YG’s stocks are priced higher than 43,574 won per share, LVMH can profit by converting into common stock. However, following recent controversies surrounding the company, YG’s stock prices have continued to fall, priced at 23,500 won as of September 15. As a result, financial industry representatives predict that LVMH will choose to receive the repayment of 67 billion won on the set five-year date of October 16, 2019.

When the Paris-based luxury conglomerate LVMH announced its new partnership with Stella McCartney in July, many of the specific details were kept under wraps, but one of the biggest – specifically what made the eco-conscious, London-based vegan fashion designer an attractive partner in the first place – was not one of them.

When Gucci … Prada and Versace announce [going fur-free] on Instagram, I think they’re looking to reach Gen Z … The buying power of that generation is going to be so much bigger than the boomers Carry Somers, co-founder, Fashion Revolution

That move came on the heels of July’s Ralph Lauren announcement of a slate of ambitious do-gooder goals including using 100 per cent sustainably sourced key materials by 2025, increasing female representation in factory management by 25 per cent in the same time frame, and having greenhouse gas reduction targets in place by the end of next year.

In June it was French luxury group Kering – a partner in McCartney’s label until early last year – making headlines with the announcement that its fashion houses, Gucci, Balenciaga and Saint Laurent among them, would hire only models aged 18 and older for its runway shows starting from next year.

Also in May, Prada and the Humane Society issued a joint statement declaring that the Italian luxury group’s stable of brands would not use animal fur from the spring and summer 2020 women’s collections onwards.

That made it the latest in a rapidly growing list of high-profile luxury labels to forswear fur, including Michael Kors, Coach, Burberry and Chanel (in the latter half of 2018 alone).

A model wears a fur helmet from a 2006 men’s runway show by Prada, which says it will no longer use animal furs in its designs from the spring and summer 2020 women’s collections onwards. Photo: AP

Also in May, American fashion designer Tracy Reese, who had taken her eponymous label on hiatus two years ago, returned with a sustainably and ethically focused Hope for Flowers by Tracy Reese line, the first collection of which used textiles hand-printed and sewn into garments in the US state of Michigan.

What’s behind the fashion industry’s “Great Awokening” – the American phrase that plays on the popular word “wokeness” now widely used to describe a state of awareness, especially in matters of social justice?

It’s definitely a generational thing. Younger kids are doing climate drives for schools and we’ve seen a rise in veganism. People want change … to see better policies and practices [in place] for brands Carry Somers

Why have these traditional standard bearers of aspirational luxe – the same companies that for decades have tried to convince consumers they could never be too thin, too rich or have too many pretty things – seemingly reversed course?

While some of the shift is obvious – top-down forces such as recently passed laws fur-sale bans, for example, have been passed in West Hollywood and Los Angeles and a US statewide fur ban is currently under consideration. In 2017 France passed a law requiring all models to obtain a doctor’s certificate confirming their physical health. But much more of it seems to be bubbling up from below.

Carry Somers, who co-founded the British-based Fashion Revolution organisation in the aftermath of the 2013 Rana Plaza fire in Bangladesh (with more than 1,100 killed, it ranks as the deadliest disaster in the history of the garment industry), says her group’s efforts at encouraging transparency – particularly via its annual survey of top global fashion brands – have started to pay off.

The 2019 Fashion Transparency Index, which ranked Adidas, Reebok and Patagonia in a three-way tie for the most transparent of 200 global brands surveyed, revealed some interesting shifts, Somers said.

This latest wave [of fashion brands becoming more open] has to do with consumers’ changing attitudes towards animals … they [know Gen Z cares] about sustainability and animal welfare … the generation coming up that has the buying power Carry Somers

“[The survey] has really opened up the conversation among the biggest fashion brands,” she said.

“We’ve found brands that weren’t disclosing anything at all [are now doing so] – like Chanel, which this year published its first report. There’s not much in it, but it’s a start.

“A great change we’ve seen is in publishing factory lists; that’s something we’ve been specifically asking brands to do and two years ago only 12.5 per cent of brands were publishing [a list of] their first-tier factories and this year that’s gone up to 35 per cent.”

Somers cites the influence of a changing demographic. “It’s definitely a generational thing,” Somers said. “The younger kids are doing climate drives for schools and we’ve seen an increase in veganism over the last few years that’s been really incredible.

“People have been calling for change because they want to see better policies and practices [in place] for brands.

“This latest wave has to do with consumers’ changing attitudes toward animals, this new drive for transparency, what’s now available on the internet for people to see and the generation coming up that has the buying power.

When Gucci announces [it is going fur-free] on Instagram, and Prada and Versace announce [going fur-free] on Instagram, I think they’re looking to reach Gen Z. … The buying power of that generation is going to be so much bigger than the boomers’, and they know that that consumer cares about these issues – sustainability [and] animal welfare.”

Studies of the postmillennial Gen Z demographic – those people born in the late 1990s and early 2000s – support Somers’ assessment.

According to Cone Communications’ 2017 Gen Z corporate social responsibility study, by next year Gen Z will account for 40 per cent of global consumers, with a full 94 per cent of Zs surveyed believing that companies should address social and environmental issues.

By 2020 Gen Z will account for 40 per cent of global consumers, with a full 94 per cent of Zs surveyed believing that companies should address social and environmental issues Cone Communications 2017 Gen Z survey

By comparison, 87 per cent of millennials and 83 per cent of Gen Xers felt that way.

The Cone study also found that 89 per cent of Gen Z respondents said they would rather buy from a company that was addressing social or environmental issues over one that was not, and that nearly half of this mobile-first generation reports spending 10 hours a day online.

“Social media plays a huge role,” said Summer Rayne Oakes, a model, environmental activist and author who has been calling for transparency in the fashion industry for over a decade.

“More so than ever, people and [non-governmental organisations] can use the power of social media to ‘shame’ companies for values that don’t align with their values. What are the practices that are contentious and that would be a social media liability?

“People are far more outspoken now – from the lack of diversity seen in Victoria’s Secret to the sexual abuse happening in the fashion and entertainment world.”

With the social-media-savvy, always-online Gen Zs in the driver’s seat, even small, mostly symbolic moves – such as Ralph Lauren’s Earth Polo (each shirt is made from about 12 recycled plastic bottles diverted from landfills and oceans and is itself 100 per cent recyclable), and Reese’s Hope for Flowers capsule collection for Anthropologie (made with certified organic linen and cotton and non-harmful dyes) – have the potential to help companies aiming to do good also do well.

Customers are [getting] more and more involved in what brands are doing and asking more questions about sustainability as well as animal welfare. … Now most brands understand that thinking about sustainability is not an option, it’s a necessity Marie-Claire Daveu, chief sustainability officer, Kering

Yet Reese is quick to dismiss the notion that fashion brands are getting “woke” as a way to woo the Zs, at least in her case.

“My average customer is about 40 years old,” she said, “so [Gen Z] is not my customer – not that they might not grow into my customer at some point … As for why now?

“It’s because there is a great sense of urgency to change how we’re working; to recognise that how we’re currently working is not healthy and it’s not sustainable – as in it can’t last – and that we can’t just use up all these resources and go on and on forever.

“If we don’t make dramatic change in the next 10 years then we won’t survive, so there’s a real push for real change to happen immediately.

Companies that aren’t recognising … how we are working is not healthy and sustainable … that aren’t making dramatic changes in sourcing and supply chains, they’ve got their heads buried in the sand Tracy Reese, fashion designer

“I think the companies that aren’t recognising that – [those] that aren’t making dramatic changes in their sourcing and their supply chains, they’ve got their heads buried in the sand.”

Marie-Claire Daveu, Kering’s chief sustainability officer, agrees with Reese.

“Customers are [getting] more and more involved in what brands are doing and they’re asking more questions about sustainability – both environmental and social [sustainability] – as well as animal welfare.

“I think now most brands understand that thinking about sustainability is not an option, it’s a necessity. And, more than that, it’s becoming a duty if you want to continue to develop your company.”

As consumers we really have power over brands, we can use our voice and our power to bring about change – and we really need to do that. So asking the question ‘Who made my clothes?’ is really powerful

As consumers we really have power over brands, we can use our voice and our power to bring about change – and we really need to do that. So asking the question ‘Who made my clothes?’ is really powerful Carrey Somers

While the flurry of recent pronouncements by luxury fashion brands trying to do the right thing has generated positive coverage – not to mention reframed the notion of what, exactly, luxury means in the era of the woke wardrobe – it has barely begun to address the industry’s biggest, dirtiest secret of all: the exploitative use of cheap foreign labour.

It’s on this front that Somers says demanding supply-chain transparency is crucial.

“[Transparency] really makes a difference to the workers on the ground because it means issues get remedied much faster,” she said.

“And it’s also really good for the brands because it helps protect them. If one of their suppliers has contracted to a factory that shouldn’t be making their clothes and they’re found not to be compliant, they can say ‘They’re not a registered supplier and shouldn’t have been making the clothes’. It should be a win-win. I don’t know why all brands aren’t doing it.”

The most important catalyst to that change, Somers says, isn’t a single demographic, but a single question.

“As consumers we really have power over these brands, we can use our voice and our power to bring about change – and we really need to do that,” she said.

“So asking the question ‘Who made my clothes?’ is really powerful. I’ve been told that for every one person who asks [that question], the brands take that as representing 10,000 people that think the same way, but can’t be bothered to do anything about it.”

Benjamin Beaufils is the new president of North America for TAG Heuer, filing a position that has been vacant since the departure of Kilian Müller earlier this year.



Beaufils spent the last four years working as the Miami-based regional vice president for Louis Vuitton North America. Prior to that, he was with beauty company L’Occitane en Provence for 11 years, working in both the United States and Europe.



With TAG Heuer, he will work out of New York, shuttling between the company’s offices in Manhattan and Springfield, New Jersey. He will report to Yann Bouillonnec, TAG Heuer vice president of sales.



In a news release, the company said Beaufils will spend the next few months visiting stores and meeting with teams, partners and clients across North America before launching projects for the market in 2020.



Prior to Beaufils’ appointment, Müller had spent nearly five years as president and CEO of TAG Heuer/LVMH Watch & Jewelry for North America. He left the company in January to return to his native Switzerland and take a job as an executive with Bucherer Group.



The announcement of Beaufils’ appointment comes almost exactly a year after parent company LVMH Moёt Hennessy Louis Vuitton appointed a new chairman and CEO, Stéphane Bianchi, to oversee its watch division globally.



In addition to TAG Heuer, LVMH owns Zenith and Hublot as well as Bulgari, which produces both jewelry and watches.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999935626983643}",neutral,0.9999935626983643,0

To conclude the purchase, which would involve the Elliott fund, Arnault would be willing to shell out a figure even higher than one billion euros, even if for the moment the multinational (which controls something like 70 different brands like Bulgari, Dior, Givenchy and Fendi) has immediately officially denied the negotiation. The suggestion, however, given the current corporate situation of AC Milan and the economic availability of the 70-year-old French magnate, is certainly possible.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999892711639404}",neutral,0.9999892711639404,0

PARIS: Environmental activist Greta Thunberg's discourse on climate change was overly pessimistic and demoralising for young people, LVMH boss Bernard Arnault said on Wednesday, as the group behind brands like Louis Vuitton raised its ""green"" goals.

LVMH, the world's biggest luxury goods conglomerate, which like its peers is seeking to improve its environmental credentials and keep young consumers onside, said it was further cutting emissions and improving sourcing on materials like animal fur.

But the group's billionaire owner and CEO Bernard Arnault said he rejected what he called Thunberg's doom-mongering.

The 16-year-old Swedish campaigner berated world leaders and business executives at a United Nations climate summit in New York this week for failing to act more decisively on climate change, saying they had ""stolen her dreams.""

Her vision ""has a demoralising side to it for young people. She's not proposing anyway, aside from criticism,"" Arnault, 70, told journalists. ""I prefer positive solutions that allow us to get towards a more optimistic position.""

Fashion and textile groups are under pressure from consumers and environmentalists to try and reduce industry waste, including unsold clothing, and improve their manufacturing methods.

Luxury companies turn out pricey products that are not mass produced, but they also face questions on everything from animal welfare to carbon emissions involved in exporting their wares around the world.

Many LVMH fashion brands, which include Fendi, Christian Dior and Givenchy, make accessories such as handbags from exotic skins like python or crocodile.

The group said it was bringing in a charter to ensure full traceability for all of its raw materials by 2025, which would allow it to track them back to precise farms in the case of farmed fur.

Some rivals have dropped fur altogether, including France's Chanel, Britain's Burberry and Kering's Gucci.

LVMH said it was on course to exceed its goal to cover 30% of its energy needs from renewable sources by 2020 and also on track to cut its CO2 emissions by 25% by the same time.

The group was glaringly absent from an industry ""fashion pact"" launched under the auspices of Kering in August with broad targets to reduce emissions.

Signatories included France's Hermes as well as lower end and sportswear groups like Zara-owner Inditex and Adidas.

Stella McCartney, a pioneer in vegan-friendly fashion and whose namesake brand is now part-owned by LVMH, also backed the agreement.

Arnault said the deal did not make sense for LVMH - beyond clothing brands it also owns champagne labels like Moet & Chandon - and that its business model was a world away from that of fast fashion firms.

""We prefer action to pacts,"" Arnault said.

Younger luxury consumers - including the ""millenials"" in their late 20s and mid-30s who are driving industry sales - are more readily influenced in their purchases by sustainability matters than their elders, a Boston Consulting Group survey this year showed.

Kering said earlier this week that it would become fully carbon neutral by offsetting all greenhouse gases from 2018 within the group and across its supply chain.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9806824922561646}",neutral,0.9806824922561646,0

Stella McCartney on Monday unveiled her first collection since linking up with the French luxury group LVMH, showing fluid dresses, wide-legged pants and floral prints that she said were the most sustainable clothes she had made.With her father, ex-Beatle Paul McCartney, in the audience, the British designer held her Paris Fashion Week show in the Palais Garnier, the ornate home of the Paris National Opera. The show started with outfits in a natural palette, followed later by designs with touches of bright colour and bold graphic stripes.Over 75 per cent of the ready-to-wear collection is eco-friendly, according to the label, using recycled polyester, organic cotton and sustainable raffia. Amber Valletta and Adut Akech strutted down the catwalk in blue-green utility garments while Kaia Gerber, top model Cindy Crawford's 18-year-old daughter, wore a light floral dress.The spring and summer 2020 collection is McCartney's first one since LVMH took a minority stake in her eponymous brand. The deal came a few months after the designer bought back a 50 per cent stake from Kering, ending a 17-year partnership with the French conglomerate.""There is a lot to be done at LVMH in a positive way and I am very excited and open to find some solutions (to sustainability issues)"", McCartney told Reuters after the show.A pioneer in using recycled fabrics and one of the first major designers to ban leather, fur and animal-derived glues, Stella McCartney has been appointed special adviser to Bernard Arnault, LVMH's chairman and chief executive.""If I say to LVMH to stop using leather, they may find that pretty difficult,"" McCartney said.
