The Western European country has just welcomed a particularly special new arrival of Cheval Blanc St-Barth Isle de France inhabiting the once famous Hotel Saint-Barth Isle de France. In 2013, LVMH Hotel Management acquired Hotel Saint-Barth Isle de France and lovingly restored it to its original grandeur.



The recently opened hotel is the third Maison in the Cheval Blanc portfolio joining Cheval Blanc Randheli in the Maldives and Cheval Blanc Courchevel. Located on the Flamands beach, The Cheval Blanc St-Barth Isle de France consists 40 rooms, suites and villas. The Maison’s stylish interiors in Cheval Blanc’s signature taupe with daring blush pink take its design cues from the Caribbean turquoise waters and colorful local facades.

Maison has also partnered with French hair pioneer Leonor Greyl to develop an exclusive nourishing product line for guests to protect their hair from exposure to sun and sea. To further enrich the hospitality experience, guests will be surprised with Tropical Chic, a new signature fragrance composed by Thierry Wasser, the nose at Guerlain.

Guests can set course on Big Blue Escape, a wonderful journey across the Caribbean seas. After exploring the underwater marvels, guests can savor a romantic fresh lobster lunch on the pristine Saline Beach, and indulge in an exclusive Guerlain spa ritual onboard.

The island Maison is home to Cheval Blanc Spa offering signature treatments by Guerlain such as St-Barth solar Escape. Cheval Blanc will also introduce a brand new fitness centre in October 2015, offering personal training sessions and the latest technology equipments.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999963045120239}",neutral,0.9999963045120239,0

For weeks now the Australian fashion industry has been buzzing with rumours that LVMH, through its Asian-based arm, private equity firm L Capital, would either take a slice or buy the brand outright.

Beach essence: Seafolly celebrates its 25th anniversary in 2000 by plumbing its archives for swimwear from its first collection.

Seafolly's annual revenue is more than $100 million and it has become one of the most successful swimwear labels in the women's fashion market, not just in Australia but also around the world.

In April 2013, another iconic Australian apparel brand, RM Williams, was also snapped up by LVMH.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9814557433128357}",positive,0.9814557433128357,1

Australian brands a hit

Thakran, who has worked at Swatch Group and Nike, is also managing partner of LVMH’s Singapore-based private equity fund, L Capital Asia, which is emerging as a serious threat to the aspirations of more established private equity firms in the Asia-Pacific region by snapping up more than a dozen iconic and up-and-coming consumer and lifestyle brands, including in Australia.

Thakran says he can’t get enough of Australia or Australian brands and is keen to take them to consumers around the world, starting in Asia.

“Australian-ness is a unique phenomenon – it’s hip and cool, it’s very trendy, it’s free and easy. The spirit of Australia is very different . . . all our four brands are connected to the spirit of Australia,"" he says.

L Capital has made four investments in Australia, outlaying $52 million for a 49.9 per cent stake in bush outfitter RM Williams, $75 million for 40 per cent of performance sportswear company 2XU in 2013, about $20 million for gourmet food chain Jones the Grocer in 2012, and $70 million for 70 per cent of family-owned swimwear company Seafolly last week.

It has a triple-A investment strategy, seeking out affordable, aspirational and alternative brands that are capable of delivering three-fold returns in three to five years.

“Australians practically live on the beach in summer and a brand like Seafolly is a fantastic reflection of that – it should truly be a global brand,"" Thakran says.

“Australia is also one of the most sporting nations in the world – whether you’re a real sportsman or not . . . sporty by nature.

“And it’s a market where the outback is something that’s celebrated in a big way and people want to stay connected to that. RM Williams, the way it expresses itself, it should be a global brand.""

Ready market in Asia

L Capital was established in 2009 by LVMH and Groupe Arnault, the private company of LVMH’s chairman and chief executive Bernard Arnault, as part of a strategy to pursue growth by taking minority or majority stakes – rather than full ownership – in the “affordable luxury"" market.

The firm has raised more than $US1.6 billion ($1.9 billion) from investors and now has about a dozen companies in its portfolio, ranging from Ku De Tha, a trendy nightclub in Singapore, YG Entertainment, the Korean music label behind Psy of Gangnam Style fame, Crystal Jade, a Chinese restaurant chain in Singapore, and Charles and Keith, an upscale Singapore accessories brand.

It is also attracted to Australia because of its focus on corporate governance and emphasis on transparency.

Thakran says L Capital can waste a year conducting due diligence on potential targets only to find out that all is not what it seemed once they take control.

“The law of the land provides great comfort on that, whereas in countries like China, India and Indonesia, companies often come up short on that front – [they] are used to taking shortcuts and avoiding aspects of compliance and governance to get ahead. In Australia, you have that comfort that here things will be far better.""

One of the areas where Australia lags the rest of the world is taking brands to Asia.

A recent survey of more than 1000 Australian businesses by PwC found that only 9 per cent were operating in Asia, only 12 per cent had any experience of doing business in Asia and 65 per cent had no intention of doing so in the next few years.

Thakran says if consumer brands can survive and thrive in Australia – with its high labour, rent and logistics costs and small market – they can survive just about anywhere. “If you are able to create success with all these constraints, you pretty much are ready for anywhere in the world,"" he says.

“International doesn’t mean the UK and the US . . . if they can build a footbridge to Asia, it’s almost the easiest market they can go to, even though they think it’s the most ­difficult.""

He says there is a ready market in Asia for well-developed, innovative and credible Australian brands as consumers become increasingly sophisticated and as young Asians who have studied in Australia return home with a taste for the Antipodean lifestyle. He cites the overseas success of Jones the Grocer, L Capital’s first and smallest Australian investment.

Jones the Grocer going global

Jones the Grocer opened its first store in Woollahra in 1996 – giving Australian foodies their first taste of walk-in cheese rooms and artisanal bread – but went into voluntary administration briefly in 2002. It now has 16 stores – four in Australia, two in New Zealand, three in Singapore and seven in the UAE, where it has recently been awarded the country’s first liquor licence.

“It’s super-successful in the Middle East,"" says Thakran, who plans to open the first Jones the Grocer store in New York next year. “We have already multiplied the business since we took it over and we believe we can multiply by two for the next few years – it’s still at a very early stage.""

Thakran has similar ambitions for Seafolly, 2XU and RM Williams.

L Capital’s strategy is to provide its partners with enough capital to fund growth for five years and support founders by giving them access to the considerable resources of LVMH.

This can range from negotiating better deals on store rentals, advising on local sizing, store design and point of sale systems to contributing management expertise from within LVMH or identifying executives from outside the group.

For example, Raju Vuppalapati, the managing director of Levi Strauss (Australia, Africa and the Middle East) has taken the helm at RM Williams, and former RM Williams chief executive Hamish Turner is taking up a directorship at L Capital Asia.

“CEOs can take comfort from the fact that a company like LVMH is behind these companies – they’re not leaving a multinational and joining a small family-owned company, they know that they’re joining a company that is backed by LVMH,"" says Thakran.

“If it’s only capital needed, we are not necessarily the right player, but if you need knowledge skills and value-add to become global or a regional major, we certainly can add that value and are very interested.""

Leadership critical

For this reason, companies such as Seafolly and RM Williams have embraced L Capital after rejecting numerous approaches from other would-be suitors.

“I’ve had many approaches over the years but, until meeting L Capital, I didn’t come across anyone who could give us what we need,"" says Seafolly chief executive Anthony Halas.

Most of L Capital’s Asia team are ex-LVMH, and members of LMVH’s leadership team sit on the fund’s strategic advisory board.

Thakran says working with founders can prove problematic, so L Capital vets owners just as closely as it crunches the numbers.

“You can study the P & L and the balance sheet, but if the leadership doesn’t smell right and if the company does not have the right culture, eventually it will hit the wall,"" he says. “Private equity has only a few years with a company, we don’t have a lifetime, and you want to make a difference.""

After unveiling the Seafolly partnership on Monday and opening Sephora’s first store in Australia on Friday, Thakran is heading to Byron Bay this weekend to check out health and wellness brands.

He is also eyeing a few Australian wine labels and would love to add a pawpaw skincare product to the mix. “I was very surprised to learn about this product – every Aussie woman knows about it, but it’s not known to the world. “Australia has some hidden gems which can be taken to the world.""","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9993256330490112}",neutral,0.9993256330490112,0
Jonathan Anderson - Interview,"Mon, 15 Dec 2014 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmludGVydmlld21hZ2F6aW5lLmNvbS9mYXNoaW9uL2pvbmF0aGFuLWFuZGVyc29uLWxvZXdl0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"There will always be something that turns me on in the dichotomy between men’s and women’s clothing. Jonathan Anderson

When it was announced in September 2013 that Jonathan Anderson—the young designer of conceptual, unisex-minded London label J.W. Anderson, known for past collections that gleefully upended gender codes (knit crop tops and ruffled bloomers for men; boxy, sculptural silhouettes and sweeping trousers for women)—was to take the reins as creative director of Loewe, the 168-year-old Spanish luxury leather goods house, the entire fashion world took notice. It was validation of the Irish designer’s auspicious talent, giving him a place at the table among the heavyweights of the LVMH empire (namely, Nicolas Ghesquière, Phoebe Philo, and Riccardo Tisci), and it was also a stamp of approval for Anderson’s larger fashion vision, with LVMH simultaneously acquiring a minority stake of his eponymous label.

This past summer—prior to his well-received, breezily sensual womenswear debut at the UNESCO building at Paris Fashion Week in October—Anderson unveiled an all-new Loewe that he re-engineered from the ground up. His new vision for the Loewe house was heralded by an update of the logo by art directors M/M (Paris); a new bag design, the Puzzle; and an inaugural ad campaign that, alongside new images photographed by Steven Meisel, appropriated shots from a 1997 Meisel Italian Vogue editorial featuring Maggie Rizer and Amber Valletta. Loewe’s first U.S. flagship is also slated to open in Miami in early 2015. The campaign, certainly atypical, is an indicator of Anderson’s fashion sensibility—as not just a creator, but as an aggregator and translator of fashion for the image-hungry Instagram generation. As the 30-year-old Anderson explained to his friend, DJ and sound designer Michel Gaubert, during a phone call this past November, fashion is now in the ownerless age of the internet—and he just wants to show us his sketchbook.

JONATHAN ANDERSON: Hey, Michel. Whereabouts in the world are you?

MICHEL GAUBERT: I’m in New York. I’m going to San Francisco this afternoon.

ANDERSON: I’m in Paris—back at work again.

GAUBERT: How do you feel being between London and Paris?

ANDERSON: I feel like I’m always on the Eurostar. [laughs] Years and years ago, I hated Paris because I didn’t know anyone, but now that I spend half my time there and half my time in London, I find there are two aspects of my life. I feel like it’s me having an affair with a country. I’m living in a hotel, but hopefully, by next year, I’ll have an apartment.

GAUBERT: I think a French lover is not a bad thing. [laughs] You often talk to me about your parents. Your parents took you on vacation to Ibiza; your father was in Argentina. Do you speak Spanish from that?

ANDERSON: I unfortunately don’t speak any Spanish at all. When I was younger, we went to Ibiza a lot because my parents bought an apartment there. I feel like that has always stuck with me. My parents are huge influences on me. My mother was an English teacher. My father played professional rugby and coached rugby for the Irish rugby team. He went to Argentina many years ago—it was during the ’80s. He was touring with the Penguins [rugby club].

GAUBERT: When you were a kid, what were you like? What were you into?

ANDERSON: My brother and sister were very sporty. They all did rugby. I was very into performing arts. I went to the National Youth Music Theatre. I was one of those singing, clapping children. When I became a teenager, I got very into clothing. I remember cutting Gucci advertisements and sticking them on my wall. [laughs] My wall used to be covered in advertisements. I remember buying a pair of Gucci jeans.

GAUBERT: Tom Ford, I suppose.

ANDERSON: It was that Tom Ford era. Then as I got older, it was Patrick Cox shoes and Dior Homme. But my access to fashion was actually through an American store called T.J. Maxx. In North Ireland, it’s called T.K. Maxx. I would buy everything that was probably rejected from stores. I remember buying a pair of leopard-print, faux-fur skinny jeans by Jean Paul Gaultier. I got them for, I think, 12 pounds. I never wore them, but they were always there. [laughs]

GAUBERT: I’m a bit of a collector myself so I understand that kind of thing.

ANDERSON: It’s interesting: When I look back at things I’m into today, I always think it’s things between 8 and 15 that influence you the most. Color—I think you learn color when you’re a child.



I don’t see myself as a designer-designer. I’m not an Alaïa. I am fundamentally a creative director. It is about character building in the end. Jonathan Anderson

GAUBERT: But how did you start getting into fashion as a profession?

ANDERSON: I was studying at the Studio Theatre in Washington, D.C., and I started to befriend a guy in the costume department. They had these giant rooms of clothing. I was working on A Midsummer’s Night Dream and became obsessed by the costumes and this idea of characters and clothing. I was very young when I was there. I was obsessed by James Dean: I read the biographies, I bought jeans, I wore white T-shirts, I started smoking. I was mega-influenced by everything.

GAUBERT: Did you have a red leather jacket, too?

ANDERSON: I had a red nylon jacket and red leather jacket—it was pretty tragic. So I ended up dropping out of a three-year course. I went back to Northern Ireland. My parents were very disappointed in the amount of money I had spent and hadn’t actually gotten a degree. I worked in the men’s department in [Irish luxury department store] Brown Thomas to try to earn the money back. When I was there, the Prada team came in and said to me, “You have to meet Manuela Pavesi [Miuccia Prada’s right-hand woman], she will love you. And if you ever come to London, we’ll give you a job.” I thought they were just joking, so I never took them up on it. I ended up applying for all the universities in London to go to fashion school. I did this course at the London College of Fashion for menswear. One day, I walked into Prada and Manuela was there. She said, “When can you start?” and, “Can you do this rack?” So I did the rack, and a week later I was working at the company [as a visual merchandiser] and left university.

GAUBERT: How long did you last there?

ANDERSON: I lasted there two years.

GAUBERT: Oh my God. That’s a long time!

ANDERSON: I learned so much there. She was the most incredible person.

GAUBERT: So what about when Loewe, the big Spanish label, went shopping for you? Was it a big surprise?

ANDERSON: Delphine Arnault and Pierre-Yves Roussel from LVMH approached me to buy part of my own brand [J.W. Anderson]. During the process of that, Delphine and Pierre-Yves said, “Would you be interested in another brand?” Delphine was like, “Why don’t you go to this factory? It’s a brand called Loewe.” And I said, “Sure, why not?” So I remember going to the factory in Spain pretending I was writing for a magazine. Undercover. [Gaubert laughs] I’ll never forget the day I turned up, going into a room filled with all different leathers. I was just like, “This is the brand I want to work for. I hope they give it to me now.” [laughs] I did this book for them, kind of like a scrapbook, and I presented it. Then it was Paris Fashion Week and it was announced.

GAUBERT: Earlier on you were talking about how you had magazine photos on the walls in your room when you were growing up. The Loewe campaign is a lot of older images from magazines. Is there a connection? Do you have passion for image?

ANDERSON: I’m obsessed by fashion editorial. I love good fashion imagery. If there’s a talent that I would love to be able to do, it is to take a picture. It’s the most incredible thing because it summarizes what’s happening. When I was interviewing for the job, there was this story by Steven Meisel in Italian Vogue in ’97. When I went to the factory and came back, that story for me was the brand. Two images in particular—one was a beach and one was a girl drinking a glass of water. I said to LVMH, “This is the woman, and if Madrid was to have a beach in the city center, that beach would look like that.”

GAUBERT: That’s crazy, right?

ANDERSON: It was kind of crazy. [laughs] When I started working on everything, these images kept coming up. I brought M/M (Paris) in to do the art direction. I wanted this idea that fashion is referenced. I am not scared of referencing. I just thought, “I want to show people my scrapbook for this brand.” I wanted people to see the intimate moment that I had when I got the job. So then we talked to Steven [Meisel]. We were lucky that he agreed to do it. So for the campaign, you have Loewe at the top, which M/M recut, and then you have the image and below it says: “An Interpretation.”

GAUBERT: It’s very nice that you say you like to show your references, because I think now, everything is referenced everywhere. Today, that’s what it’s all about. It’s very obvious in music. It’s about what you grew up with, what you reference, and the way you turn things into something different and something new.

ANDERSON: When I first joined Loewe and we were dealing with this whole thing, this idea crossed in my head, which had never really occurred to me, “Why become obsessed by owning something?” I do love fashion. I have a fashion history. That’s what the point is—it’s transferring of information. But I don’t want to own anything I’ve designed. I want it to just become public domain. I think we live in the day of Google. Everything’s public domain.

GAUBERT: A lot of your designs are influenced by—I wouldn’t say androgyny, because I don’t like that word—I would say a modern community or modern masculinity. Are you going to do the same thing for Loewe, or are you more separate for your own label?

ANDERSON: I think there will always be something that turns me on in the dichotomy between men’s and women’s clothing. That’s something that’s just embedded in me. As much as they’re two different brands, there is me in the middle. I don’t want the brands to crossover, but I think there will always be that trait of trying to tug at people’s sensibilities with clothing. There are always fantasy characters of what you’d want to be. I’d love to be able to wear a crop top, but I will never be able to do it. [Gaubert laughs] It’s the fantasy of seeing that, you know? It’s the idea of that character. Fashion ultimately is about selling characters per season. I don’t see myself as a designer-designer. I’m not an Alaïa. I am fundamentally a creative director. It is about character building in the end.

GAUBERT: When I saw the first catalog of pictures you did for Loewe menswear, I thought the pictures were beautiful, and I also liked the fact that the models could be either a woman or a man. The clothes were for anyone—shirts, pants, everything. I thought it was extremely desirable and just right for the time. What do you see yourself doing in the future?

ANDERSON: I’m very goal-driven. My American trait probably comes from my dad, who reads a lot of positive thinking books—team building and that kind of thing. In the next five years, I want to turn this brand around; I want to work hard at that. It’s a very different part of my brain I’m using with it. I want J.W. Anderson to be able to stand on its own legs as a brand internationally. But at the same time, fashion is obsessive. It can become a drug. I’ve started to realize that. You start to fight more for your own personal space. You want to get into a moment where you’re in love; you want to be in a moment where you’re at home decompressing. As long as I’m as happy as I am now, then I’m happy, you know? That’s all that matters.

MICHEL GAUBERT IS A PARIS-BASED DJ AND SOUND DESIGNER.

Famed Crown Building on market for up to $2B - New York Post,"Fri, 05 Dec 2014 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vbnlwb3N0LmNvbS8yMDE0LzEyLzA1L2FydC1kZWNvLXRvd2VyLWluLW1hbmhhdHRhbi1vbi1tYXJrZXQtZm9yLXVwLXRvLTJiL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The Crown Building, the Fifth Avenue landmark at the intersection of the city’s most expensive real-estate crossroads, is on the block.

The price for the trophy building at 730 Fifth Ave. on the southwest corner of W. 57th Street could sell for a princely sum between $1.5 billion and $2 billion, sources said.

Bergdorf Goodman, LVMH and Tiffany anchor the other three corners of the intersection, making this property a once-in-a-lifetime luxury prize.

Eastdil Secured’s Douglas Harmon, Adam Spies and Kevin Donner are selectively marketing the building, sources said.

The sellers of the tower where Bulgari and Mikimoto ply gems and pearls are the Winter family and the Spitzer family, now headed by former Gov. Eliot Spitzer.

Famous for its golden top, the striking Art Deco tower was once owned by Ferdinand and Imelda Marcos before a military-backed revolt toppled their regime.

The 400,000 square-foot tower’s tenants include talent and literary agency ICM, private-equity giants KKR and Apollo Global Management and men’s designer Ermenegildo Zegna.

Some 35,000 square feet is retail that includes Bank of America and Piaget along with Bulgari and Mikimoto.

Ferdinand Marcos’ secret purchase of the building through a web of companies sparked years of court battles and international intrigue before the Philippine government sold it at auction in 1991.

The original buyers were Jerome L. Greene, Marvin Winter and Bernard Spitzer, whose company, Spitzer Enterprises, is now controlled by son Eliot. Bernard Spitzer died last month.

The group laid out more than $93.6 million for the half-empty, 25-story building in the court-ordered sale.

In a funny coincidence, the Crown once had many men’s-shoe showrooms. Imelda Marcos was famous for her shoe collection.

It later took 1,363 ounces of 23-karat gold leaf to restore the façade, statues and gilded elevators. The building is 97.8 percent full, according to CoStar data, and was recently renovated.

It not uncommon for new area retailers to be charged $4,000 per foot and office tenants to pay more than $150 per foot for the best Plaza District locations.

Designed in 1921 by Grand Central Terminal’s architects, Warren & Wetmore, the building is distinguished by its tall gilded crown.

There are numerous terraces and views to Central Park, making it a possible residential or hotel conversion candidate.

The Crown offering follows the pending sale of 1095 Sixth Ave. for $2.25 billion also marketed by the Eastdil team.

Neither the sellers or the brokers would comment.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999995231628418}",neutral,0.9999995231628418,0
Seafolly swims into private equity arms of LVMH - The Australian Financial Review,"Tue, 02 Dec 2014 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFmci5jb20vY29tcGFuaWVzL3JldGFpbC9zZWFmb2xseS1zd2ltcy1pbnRvLXByaXZhdGUtZXF1aXR5LWFybXMtb2YtbHZtaC0yMDE0MTIwMi0xMXkwZ2fSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"“I was immensely impressed by them and by what they had to offer us to help us build the business internationally – no-one else could offer us that .""

Seafolly’s sales have risen to $120 million from $6 million in the last 18 years, fuelled by a shift in strategy from private-label supplier to a globally recognised brand.

Mr Halas believes sales could reach $500 million in four to five years as Seafolly taps L Capital and LVMH’s global retail, property and management expertise and expands into new categories such as accessories, sleepwear and activewear and new products such as skincare and sun protection.

“The world is our oyster – it depends how far we can take it ,"" Mr Halas said.

“We want to develop Seafolly into a true lifestyle brand,"" he said.“Whilst we have been doing apparel and accessories it’s only about 20 per cent of the business – with the help of L Capital we’re going to ramp up that non-swim part of the business, improve the product offering and quality.""

Seafolly has almost 40 concept and Sunburn stores in Australia and New Zealand and is stocked in more than 1200 stores in 46 countries, including Nordstrom in the US, Harrods and Selfridges in the UK, Galeries Lafayette in France and Ireland’s Brown Thomas.

Mr Halas said with L Capital’s backing Seafolly would expand more aggressively into Asia, where it only has “a toe in the water"", and existing US, UK and European markets. International sales, which now represent one third of total sales, are expected to reach 60 to 70 per cent of sales within a few years.

Australia has been a happy hunting ground for L Capital Asia, which has raised more than $US1.6 ($1.9 billion) billion from investors over the last four years.

The fund has a “triple-A"" strategy – it targets aspirational, affordable and alternate segments – and focuses on consumer businesses that will benefit from growing discretionary spending in Asia.

L Capital bought 49.9 per cent of iconic bootmaker RM Williams for $52 million in April 2013 and took a 40 per cent stake in performance sportswear brand 2XU last December. It also owns gourmet grocer Jones the Grocer.

LVMH’s Asia and Middle East president and L Capital Asia’s managing partner, Ravi Thakran, said Australia was such an attractive market that L Capital planned to set up an Australian office.

“Originally when we started L Capital our focus was in the Asia-Pacific region, mainly in emerging markets China and India. Then we realised Australia is a great base for us and there are a few reasons for that – it’s a market that in terms of creativity, brand development and innovation, it’s as good as the US or UK,"" he said.

“In the Australian market, the cost of logistics is higher, labour costs are very high, rental costs are very high ... if the brand is still able to create a profitable model – like Seafolly has – then it’s going to be easier to take that brand to another market which has lower costs,"" he said.

“Thirdly, in Asia, particularly China and India, because they are emerging markets governance transparency is not necessarily of the highest order. Australia is different in that respect.""

Mr Thakran said L Capital planned to take advantage of the brand equity in Seafolly to develop it into a fully fledged lifestyle brand.

“LVMH has 69 brands and we can draw on that knowledge and experience and sheer presence in Asia Pacific , whether it be locations, store decision, product development, or strategy,"" Mr Thakran said.

“I would say the focus for the next four years will be to go global. Second is to focus wider on categories. And third is to build a bigger talent bench,"" he said. Seafolly was a potential IPO candidate “but there are also various strategic options.""","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9971659779548645}",positive,0.9971659779548645,1
Seafolly owner: Why I'm selling up to Louis Vuitton in “emotional” deal - SmartCompany,"Tue, 02 Dec 2014 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNtYXJ0Y29tcGFueS5jb20uYXUvZ3Jvd3RoL3NlYWZvbGx5LW93bmVyLXdoeS1pLW0tc2VsbGluZy11cC10by1sb3Vpcy12dWl0dG9uLWluLWVtb3Rpb25hbC1kZWFsL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"article-article-body

Australian swimwear brand Seafolly is hoping to make a bigger splash in international markets, after its founders sold a majority stake in the company to L Capital Asia, the private equity arm of fashion powerhouse and luxury goods retailer Louis Vuitton Moet Hennessy.

Anthony Halas, who in 1998 took over the reins of the company his mother and father had founded, told SmartCompany this morning he has been approached “almost daily by potential suitors” over the past few years, but L Capital Asia stood out from the pack as a company that could “truly add value and help us meet our goals”.

“I started talking with [L Capital Asia managing director] Ravi Thakran in December last year and he really impressed me,” Halas says.

“He understood brands and fashion and the space we’re in.”

The deal is worth more than $100 million and Halas confirmed his family will retain a “significant” stake in the business of more than 20%.

The deal is L Capital’s fourth Australian investment, having previously purchased stakes in iconic Australian retailer RM Williams, sportswear label 2XU and gourmet food store Jones the Grocer.

The LVMH group is well known for its high-end fashion labels, including Fendi, Givenchy, Marc Jacobs and Tag Heuer, as well as alcohol brands Moet and Chandon and Belvedere vodka.

Halas has two goals for Seafolly, which he says L Capital Asia will help him achieve.

“The first is we want to become a true beach lifestyle brand, maximising our swimwear, apparel and accessories,” he says.

“We want to take it as far as we can and they can really help us do that.”

To achieve this goal, Halas and Thakran have already begun discussing potential new products for the Seafolly brand, with skincare and sun protection at the top of this list.

“We’ve recently started selling sunglasses, which is an example of how well we can expand into other categories.”

Secondly, Halas wants Seafolly to become an “international iconic breach brand” and he says L Capital Asia’s international connections, including landlords and other retailers, will “open doors for us”.

With stand-alone Seafolly stores already operating in the United States, Halas says developing the brand’s presence in Asia is a key area of focus.

“We have a small presence in Singapore but outside of that, we don’t do a lot in the Asian market,” he says.

“It’s a part of the world that L Capital really understands.”

Halas’ parents Peter and Yvonne founded Seafolly in Sydney in 1975. The swimwear brand now turns over more than $120 million each year, with sales in 42 countries.

In Australia, aside from its online presence, Seafolly has 10 stand-alone stores, as well as numerous stockists and a partnership with Myer.

Halas describes the decision to sell as “an emotional one” but necessary to continue growing the business.

“It’s been going for nearly 40 years and I am 47, so I have grown up with it, it’s part of the family,” Halas says.

“But we wouldn’t be doing justice to the brand if we didn’t sell. It’s the next step that needs to be taken.”

Looking further ahead, Halas says taking Seafolly public with L Capital’s help is “definitely” on the cards, saying it’s an option he is “very much” interested in.
