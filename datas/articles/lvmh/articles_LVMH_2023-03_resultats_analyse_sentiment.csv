Former L’Oréal Exec Named CEO of LVMH Beauty - Retail TouchPoints,"Tue, 07 Mar 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldGFpbHRvdWNocG9pbnRzLmNvbS90b3BpY3MvbWFya2V0LW5ld3MvZm9ybWVyLWxvcmVhbC1leGVjLW5hbWVkLWNlby1vZi1sdm1oLWJlYXV0edIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LVMH has appointed Stéphane Rinderknech as Chairman and CEO of its Beauty Division in addition to his current role as head of LVMH Hospitality Excellence. Rinderknech will now also take global responsibility for the company’s beauty roster, with brands including Parfums Christian Dior, Guerlain, LVMH Fragrance Brands (Parfums Givenchy and Kenzo) and Kendo now reporting directly to him.

Rinderknech began his career with the Travel Retail America Division of L’Oréal in 2001. He has held roles of increasing responsibility at L’Oréal in various global markets, including President and CEO of L’Oréal China and then President and CEO of L’Oréal USA in 2019. In 2022, he joined the LVMH Group as Chairman and CEO of LVMH Hospitality Excellence and he is a member of the LVMH Group Executive Committee.

“Stéphane has, since his arrival, guided the rebound of our hotel activities with considerable strategic agility, driving tremendous momentum across the entire organization,” said Bernard Arnault, Chairman and CEO of LVMH in a statement. “This experience in a new industry confirmed his ability to adapt, his leadership and direct engagement with teams. His deep understanding of the beauty industry will help him leverage the unique assets of each of our Maisons.”

Rinderknech’s promotion has precipitated additional reshuffling in the division, including:

LVMH reshuffles beauty C-suite as it eyes more beauty opportunities - Glossy,"Wed, 08 Mar 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmdsb3NzeS5jby9iZWF1dHkvbHZtaC1yZXNodWZmbGVzLWJlYXV0eS1jLXN1aXRlLWFzLWl0LWV5ZXMtbW9yZS1iZWF1dHktb3Bwb3J0dW5pdGllcy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"On the heels of the recent appointment of Raffaella Cornaggia as CEO of Kering Group’s new beauty division in February, LVMH is also reshuffling its beauty C-Suite.

On Tuesday, LVMH announced a slew of promotions alongside completing a reorganization of the portfolio by category. It appointed Stéphane Rinderknech as CEO of its beauty division. In his new role, Rinderknech will oversee the group’s beauty businesses, which include Parfums Christian Dior, Guerlain, Maison Francis Kurkdjian, Kendo and 11 other brands. He will also continue to manage the Hospitality Excellence division.

Stéphanie Médioni, executive president of the Beauty Division, will report to Rinderknech. Additionally, reporting to Rinderknech are new appointments. That includes Véronique Courtois, who will lead Parfums Christian Dior as president and CEO, and Gabrielle Saint-Genis Rodriguez, leading Guerlain as president and CEO.

Rinderknech spent 19 years at L’Oréal working in foreign markets, both in the Americas and Asia Pacific. Described by then-L’Oréal Group CEO Jean-Paul Agon as an energetic man, Rinderknech was promoted to CEO of L’Oréal China in 2016, which, under his management, became the L’Oréal Group’s second largest subsidiary and its fastest growing market. In October 2019, Rinderknech was appointed president and CEO of L’Oréal USA, the company’s largest subsidiary, and evp of North America. He joined LVMH in 2022 and has been leading the group’s Hospitality Excellence division, which includes Hôtels Cheval Blanc and Belmond Hotels and Trains.

“Stéphane has, since his arrival, guided the rebound of our hotel activities with considerable strategic agility, driving tremendous momentum across the entire organization,” said Bernard Arnault, chairman and CEO of LVMH, in a statement.

The appointments follow LVMH’s recent revenue growth of 23% to $82.6 billion for 2022, with a “record performance” from Sephora boosting overall sales. Yet, its wine and spirits, perfume and cosmetics, and watch and jewelry divisions underperformed against analyst expectations. The luxury and prestige beauty categories are seeing intense competition as they work to solidify their positioning. The Estée Lauder Companies recently shored up its ownership over Tom Ford Beauty by acquiring the entire brand for $2.8 billion. And with the successful introduction of Gucci Beauty in 2019, other fashion houses have jumped into the space, including Valentino Beauty (licensed by L’Oréal), Victoria Beckham and Jason Wu. Kering Group, which owns the Gucci fashion house, has signaled its interest in establishing a stronger beauty portfolio. Gucci Beauty is currently in a licensing agreement with Coty Inc. that will expire around 2028.

Arnault, in LVMH’s fourth-quarter and year-end 2022 earnings call, stated that Celine has reached the €2 billion revenue mark. He said it “bodes well for the future of this iconic brand” because of its desirability and attraction to young people, adding that Celine fragrance has performed well in sales. LVMH recently launched Stella McCartney Beauty in 2022. Past LVMH fashion houses to try their hand at beauty include Kenzo, circa 2004, and Marc Jacobs. The latter was managed by LVMH beauty incubator Kendo and wound down operations in 2021. Its other notable fashion houses include Louis Vuitton, Emilio Pucci, Fendi and Loewe.

How much more luxury and prestige beauty the world can easily absorb is hard to say. Still, there are other pressing concerns in the industry. That not only includes the increased legacy competition and challenger luxury brands like Augustinus Bader, but also the macroeconomic climate and downward pressure from China’s Covid-19 sales recovery. Arnault, in the fourth-quarter and year-end 2022 earnings call, remained confident, claiming that LVMH has continued to grow market share since 2019 despite headwinds.

“The consequence of the great work put in by the teams in the various Maisons … has allowed us, during these difficult years marked by the economic and health crisis, to increase our market share,” he said.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9998810291290283}",neutral,0.9998810291290283,0
"LVMH Affiliate Buys Retail Property As It Builds Portfolio in Beverly Hills, California - CoStar Group","Tue, 28 Mar 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNvc3Rhci5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS8zNjQxOTE0MS9sdm1oLWFmZmlsaWF0ZS1idXlzLXJldGFpbC1wcm9wZXJ0eS1hcy1pdC1idWlsZHMtcG9ydGZvbGlvLWluLWJldmVybHktaGlsbHMtY2FsaWZvcm5pYdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"An entity related to French luxury retailer LVMH, the owner of such exclusive brands as Louis Vitton, Tiffany and Bulgari, is building up its property holdings with an acquisition in Beverly Hills, California, one of the world's most high-profile shopping destinations.

The affiliate bought the roughly 14,100-square-foot retail property at 357 N. Beverly Drive in the 90210 ZIP code for $43 million, or about $3,000 per square foot, according to public records and someone with direct knowledge of the deal. That's nearly three times the Beverly Hills retail market average of $1,100 per square foot, according to CoStar data.

Public records show the recorded buyer as an entity named 357 N Beverly Drive LLC, which is tied to Dennis Ferrazzano. Ferrazzano is a partner at Chicago-based Barack Ferrazzano, the primary North American real estate counsel for LVMH, the parent company of Louis Vuitton.

An LVMH representative declined to comment. A representative for Ferrazzano did not respond to requests to comment from CoStar News.

Multiple entities were involved in selling the property, and a representative for the sellers did not respond to a request to comment from CoStar News. The building previously sold for $40 million in July 2015, according to CoStar data. The building is fully leased to clothing retailer COS, which is owned by H&M, under a lease that runs through September 2028, according to CoStar data.

Will Stifel, a senior associate with Pasadena-based real estate firm Arbor Realty Capital Advisors, said the sales price reflects the strong demand for retail in Beverly Hills despite COVID-19 putting a damper on shopping sales in the pandemic's early months. Stifel was not involved in the deal.

""Beverly Hills remains a worldwide beacon for shopping and international travelers in the U.S.,"" Stifel said.

The sale is the latest Beverly Hills acquisition for entities related to LVMH. An entity related to Ferrazzano and LVMH bought the former 80-room Luxe Hotel at 360 N. Rodeo Drive for an eye-popping $200 million, or about $2.5 million a room, in December 2021.

Entities related to LVMH own at least six other properties in Beverly Hills along Beverly Drive and Rodeo Drive, according to CoStar data.

Meanwhile, LVMH is attempting to redevelop a former Brooks Brothers store at 468 N. Rodeo Drive into a luxury Cheval Blanc hotel. The hotel project, though, has run into some resistance. A special election is being held on May 23 in Beverly Hills that will decide whether the hotel project can be built, according to Beverly Press.

The Beverly Hills retail market is among the most desirable in the world. The market's average rent is $99.33 per square foot on an annual basis, well above the greater L.A. average of $35.53 per square foot, according to CoStar data. The market's vacancy rate is 6.4%, above the greater L.A. average of 5.3%.

Why LVMH's Acquisition Of Cartier From Richemont Is Unlikely - Jing Daily,"Wed, 01 Mar 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vamluZ2RhaWx5LmNvbS9wb3N0cy9sdm1oLWNhcnRpZXItcmljaGVtb250LWFjcXVpc2l0aW9uLXJ1bW9y0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"What happened

Rumors are swirling of a major luxury takeover. According to a report from Swiss newspaper Finanz und Wirtschaft , LVMH is looking to acquire Cartier from Richemont as a complement to Tiffany & Co, acquired in 2021. According to the report, Johann Rupert, patriarch of the Rupert family which founded Richemont in 1988, has been resistant to giving away control of the company.

The Jing Take

So far, there has been little substantiation that Richemont is selling Cartier. And why would Richemont sell?

The jewelry division, which includes Cartier, accounts for most of its parent company’s total sales and performs solidly, growing 8 percent in the three-month period to December 31, 2022. The buyout would make it more difficult to compete with LVMH, especially after it reported annual revenue of more than 83 billion in 2022, far ahead of Richemont’s 20 billion.

Plus, LVMH does not have a shortage of high jewelry brands in its wheelhouse. Not only did the French conglomerate acquire American jewelry Tiffany & Co. just two years ago, but it also owns several heritage jewelry names including Chaumet, Bulgari, and Fred — all of which are profitable. In fact, Tiffany boasted a record year in 2022 that saw its high jewelry revenue double and profit exceed 1 billion euros.

But to entertain the idea that this acquisition did proceed: If it’s anything like the Tiffany purchase — which more than doubled LVMH’s watches and jewelry sales after just one year — the addition of Cartier could help close the gap between the jewelry division and its frontrunner, the selective retailing division (which includes Sephora and DFS), and put it more on par with the powerful leather goods and bags segment. It could also mean a major makeover for Cartier in order to appeal to younger shoppers.

These aren’t the only rumors about LVMH’s expansion. In February 2022, the owner of Louis Vuitton and Christian Dior was reportedly toying with the idea of buying Ralph Lauren to make greater inroads in the US market. Earlier this year, LVMH made headlines again for reportedly being at the center of a bidding war with L’Oréal for Aesop , an Australian luxury cosmetics label.

Whether any of these rumors come to fruition remains to be seen. However, signs certainly point to LVMH’s dominance over the luxury sector and, more crucially, its drive to defend its seat on the throne.

Luxury goods titan LVMH makes moves along NYC's Billionaires' Row - New York Post,"Tue, 21 Mar 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vbnlwb3N0LmNvbS8yMDIzLzAzLzIxL2x1eHVyeS1nb29kcy10aXRhbi1sdm1oLW1ha2VzLW1vdmVzLWFsb25nLWJpbGxpb25haXJlcy1yb3cv0gFdaHR0cHM6Ly9ueXBvc3QuY29tLzIwMjMvMDMvMjEvbHV4dXJ5LWdvb2RzLXRpdGFuLWx2bWgtbWFrZXMtbW92ZXMtYWxvbmctYmlsbGlvbmFpcmVzLXJvdy9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"French luxury goods conglomerate LVMH is making moves around its pocket of Billionaires’ Row on East 57th Street.

First, there’s a lease out to relocate its US headquarters to 550 Madison Ave. — and another to shuffle its Louis Vuitton store to the Trump Organization’s 6 E. 57th St., while the fashion house’s own location across the street is being renovated.

Those 36,000 square feet at 6 E. 57th St. are still occupied by Tiffany & Co. — which is also an LVMH subsidiary — and the luxury retailers will play musical chairs of sorts once the jeweler moves next door to its own redeveloped digs on the corner of Fifth Avenue this spring.

(Tiffany’s landmarked headquarters space, 727 Fifth Ave., has been getting an entire facelift by OMA architects that includes a new, multi-level glass penthouse and an outdoor terrace, while Peter Marino has been tapped for the interiors. It’s completing elevator installations and waiting for signoffs before holding a grand opening celebration, sources said.)

LVMH is headed by French billionaire Bernard Arnault — the richest man in the world. He bought Tiffany in 2021 in a $13 billion-plus deal while the jeweler’s renovations were already underway. It has been operating out of the former NikeTown space, at 6 E. 57th St., under a sublease.

The deal for the Louis Vuitton move there was cut directly with former president Donald Trump. The space is connected to both Trump Tower and the atrium that links to the IBM office tower at 590 Madison Ave.

Although two, five-year options to renew at low rents remained on that NikeTown lease, Trump sealed a short-term deal with Arnault’s son, Alex.

“The deal was done at huge numbers,” one real estate source told The Post, believed to be just five years. Another source pegged the rent at $20 million per year.

The French company’s exclusive retail broker, Robin Zendell, the Trump Organization and LVMH did not respond to requests for comment.

The possibility of LVMH using the Nike spot for one of its numerous luxury brands has been buzzed about since Feb. 15, when Trump posted on his Truth Social feed that he had dinner with Alex Arnault and his wife Géraldine at Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach.

“We were celebrating the deal we made on the former Nike Store on East 57th Street and Fifth Avenue,” Trump wrote. “Alex is very excited about the re-opening of Tiffany. It will be a truly spectacular renovation, and bring Tiffany into a new Era of fabulous Success and Growth!”



Alex is the second oldest son of Bernard Arnault, and has been focused on Tiffany’s as EVP and head of communications since 2021.

The Wall Street Journal reported last week that Alex just paid some $18 million to buy a penthouse at 30 Park Place downtown, which sits above the Four Seasons hotel.

Louis Vuitton’s offices and store are in a 15-story building at 1 E. 57th St. that, at one time, was the Warner Brothers store. LVMH has been methodically updating the upper office floors, but will soon refresh the three-level store itself.

LVMH’s city headquarters is to the east, at 19 E. 57th St. It is a mere 62 feet wide and was designed by Pritzker-winning architect Christian de Portzamparc. Opened in December 1999, it’s technologically ancient and, despite its glass curtain wall bumps and pretty details, its 23 stories are a warren of small offices.

Executives have been touring spaces in the neighborhood, but a short-term deal has eluded them because it would take extremely high rents to offset the needed capital improvements that are typically spread over a long lease.

LVMH finally settled on the long-term deal at 550 Madison Ave. where sources say there’s now a lease out for 150,000 square feet. Asking rents are $190 per foot.

The former Sony Building has undergone a complete transformation including a new public atrium between East 55th and 56th streets.

Neither Mary Ann Tighe of CBRE who represents the building ownership, the Olayan Group, nor Jeffrey Peck of Savills who represents LV North America returned requests for comment.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999990463256836}",neutral,0.9999990463256836,0
Meet the Nine Finalists of the 2023 LVMH Prize for Young Designers - WWD,"Fri, 24 Mar 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3dkLmNvbS9mYXNoaW9uLW5ld3MvZmFzaGlvbi1mZWF0dXJlcy9sdm1oLXByaXplLWFubm91bmNlcy1uaW5lLWZpbmFsaXN0cy0yMDIzLWVkaXRpb24tMTIzNTU5Mjg5MS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS — The LVMH Prize for Young Fashion Designers on Friday unveiled the nine finalists for this year’s award, spotlighting a group of pragmatic designers grappling with the major challenges facing society.

Reflecting the broad international reach of the competition, which marks its 10th anniversary this year, finalists come from the four corners of the globe but are mostly based in Europe and the U.S., with three working out of the U.K., three out of Italy, two in the U.S. and one in France.

The U.S.-based contingent consists of Luar by Raul Lopez and Diotima by Jamaican designer Rachel Scott. They are joined by London-based brands Aaron Esh; Bettter by Ukrainian designer Julie Pelipas, and Paolina Russo, headed by Canadian designer Paolina Russo and French designer Lucile Guilmard.

Rounding out the group are Paris-based designer Burç Akyol; Italian designer Luca Magliano’s Magliano label, Quira by Veronica Leoni and Setchu by Satoshi Kuwata, which is based in Milan.

Reflecting the new mood of realism at Paris Fashion Week, the finalists selected by a jury of experts and a public vote offered credible wardrobe choices that reflected concerns with gender identity, the environment and craftsmanship.

“The semifinal of the 10th edition of this prize has highlighted a great maturity in the approach and work of the designers,” said Delphine Arnault, the force behind the initiative and a key talent scout at family-controlled luxury conglomerate LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, parent of brands including Louis Vuitton, Fendi, Givenchy, Loewe and Dior, where she is chairman and chief executive officer.

Several of the finalists worked in a variety of luxury and contemporary brands before striking out on their own, and have carefully considered every aspect of their label, from sourcing and production to marketing and image.

“Cultural diversity, celebration of traditional crafts and creative audacity define this selection. Naturally, the finalists are fully engaged in dealing with environmental issues and play with the boundaries between menswear and womenswear. Their expertise, their creativity, their uniqueness and their commitment have truly impressed me,” Arnault said.

The annual design prize has helped propel the careers of such talents as Marine Serre, Nensi Dojaka, Thebe Magugu, Simon Porte Jacquemus and Grace Wales Bonner. Last year’s winner was British designer Steven Stokey-Daley with his S.S. Daley menswear label, whose fans include Harry Styles.

The grand prize winner receives a 300,000-euro endowment and mentorship by LVMH teams in such areas as sustainability, communications, marketing, legal, production and finance. The winner of the Karl Lagerfeld Prize receives a 150,000-euro allocation plus one year of mentorship from LVMH experts.

To qualify, designers must be between the ages of 18 and 40 and have at least two commercialized womenswear, menswear or genderless collections under their belt. In addition, three fashion school graduates are to be awarded 10,000 euros each and a one-year placement in the design studio of an LVMH brand.

The 2023 edition of the prize drew a record of more than 2,400 applicants. A jury made up of LVMH’s famous creative directors will ultimately select the victors ahead of a prize ceremony on June 7 at the Louis Vuitton Foundation in Paris.

“Ten years ago, when I had the idea for this prize, we could not have imagined this journey. Today, the LVMH Prize is an international and essential player in design. Each year, the number of entries increases: it is very difficult to choose between them, given the quality of the candidates and of their creations,” Arnault said.

Aaron Esh

Barely a year after launching his namesake brand, London-based designer Aaron Esh has made a name for himself with his romance-tinged menswear, which reflects his aesthetic influences as much as the realities of living in post-Brexit Britain.

Esh studied menswear at London College of Fashion before earning a scholarship from Alexander McQueen to complete his MA at Central Saint Martins. His designs contrast traditional tailoring with constructions and details borrowed from the womenswear lexicon. Examples include puff-skirt jeans, a halter-neck waistcoat and hoodies with tie fastenings.

“I look at subversion of the masculine archetype, showing there can be allure to menswear with softness and elegance — redefining what masculinity means within a wardrobe,” he said.

Bettter

Ukrainian designer Julie Pelipas launched her womenswear brand Bettter on the cusp of the coronavirus pandemic, and had barely overcome that hurdle when the Russian invasion threw her country into chaos. Since then, she has focused on keeping her team safe, in addition to creating a platform showcasing Ukrainian creatives in need of work.

The former fashion director of Vogue Ukraine conceived Bettter as an upcycling system that reworks secondhand garments and deadstock materials. Her first collection focused on the signature oversize suits she was often photographed wearing to fashion shows, and she’s since expanded to more casual pieces, including shirts made from vintage towels and reconstructed T-shirts.

“I just wanted people to know that upcycling can be really sexy,” Pelipas told WWD. Now based in London, she’s looking to make connections that will allow the label to scale and become a solution for the stock currently clogging brands.

Burç Akyol RTW Spring 2023 Courtesy of Burç Akyol

Burç Akyol

Having discovered fashion via his father, a tailor, Burç Akyol gave up a budding acting career to enroll at the École de la Chambre Syndicale de la Couture Parisienne. After stints at Christian Dior and Balenciaga, he worked alongside Esteban Cortázar at the Colombian designer’s namesake brand. In 2019, Akyol left to create his own unisex label.

Akyol is known for creations that marry sexiness with austerity. His signature metal hands bustier has been modeled for editorial shoots by celebrities including Cate Blanchett and Cardi B, while Kendall Jenner and Elizabeth Debicki have worn his designs on the red carpet.

For him, challenging rules through fashion is a way to trigger change. “I don’t want to gender clothing. It’s about you being comfortable with what you’re wearing. It has a gender: the one that you choose,” he told WWD.

Diotima Pre-Fall 2023 Courtesy of Diotima

Diotima

Rachel Scott launched her womenswear brand Diotima during the pandemic, after watching how the shutdown of the fashion industry impacted workers on the bottom rungs of the supply chain. Based in Brooklyn, New York, she saw an opportunity to provide work for women specializing in traditional crochet techniques in her home country Jamaica.

Having studied fashion design at Istituto Marangoni in Italy, Scott began her career as an assistant designer at Costume National before moving to the U.S., where she worked with brands such as J. Mendel, Elizabeth and James, and Rachel Comey.

Named after Diotima of Mantinea, an ancient Greek character in Plato’s “Symposium,” her label balances artisanal, sensual styles with mannish, sophisticated tailoring, referencing dance hall and her Jamaican roots. “I seek to present a seductive and nuanced vision of Caribbean style, looking to the future while remaining grounded in history and my experience as a Jamaican,” she said.

Luar Spring 2022 Courtesy of Luar

Luar

Raul Lopez is on a roll. The New York-based designer recently won the CFDA’s American Accessory Designer of the Year Award, and shopping search platform Lyst named Luar as the Brand to Watch in its “Year in Fashion 2022” report, citing a 106 percent increase in demand for its popular Ana bag.

Lopez, who also cofounded cult-favorite label Hood By Air with Shayne Oliver, channels his experience as the child of Dominican immigrants into his coed collections, which frequently reference his upbringing and his admiration for the opulence of Manhattan’s elite.

Celebrities including Dua Lipa and Julia Fox are fans of his work. “As a Latino gay child born in Brooklyn to immigrant parents, my brand is part love letter to the child that I was, part love letter to those, who like me, are looking to see themselves in a world that often ignores them,” he said.

Magliano Spring 2023 Paolo Zandrini/Courtesy of Magliano

Magliano

Luca Magliano’s label has been gaining heat on the Milan scene with its meticulous take on downbeat, vintage-looking menswear.

A fashion design graduate of Bologna’s Libera Università delle Arti, Magliano cut his teeth on Alessandro Dell’Acqua’s team in Milan prior to moving back to Bologna in 2013 to work with designer Manuela Arcari on the Ter et Bantine fashion line. Arcari, who is also the president of Arcari e Co., offered him the chance to launch his own collection under license in 2017.

Known for his tailoring and color sense, at times evoking grunge or vintage aesthetics, Magliano is positioned in the affordable luxury segment and is carried at around 60 retailers globally. In December, the company sold a minority stake to Underscore District, a newly established fashion business accelerator, to support the next stage of its growth.

Paolina Russo Fall 2022 Courtesy of Paolina Russo

Paolina Russo

Founded by Canadian designer Paolina Russo in 2020, this knitwear-focused womenswear brand draws on her experiences of growing up in Ontario, where the two major pastimes were craft and team sports.

French designer Lucile Guilmard, a fellow Central Saint Martins graduate, joined as codesigner last year, bringing her folklore references and contemporary cutting methods to the mix.

Known for its signature lenticular knitwear, the London-based brand is a finalist for the 2023 International Woolmark Prize and has several capsule collections with Adidas under its belt. Using upcycled and unconventional materials, Paolina Russo channels suburban nostalgia with items like its Warrior top, a knit corset inspired by “The Legend of Zelda.”

Quira

Having cut her teeth with Jil Sander and Phoebe Philo, Veronica Leoni is ready to make her own statement with her womenswear label Quira. Its blend of strictness and sensuality mirrors the female-centric approach of her mentors.

Named after her seamstress grandmother, Quirina, the brand made its debut at Milan Fashion Week in 2021 and has garnered more than 20 stockists, including Bergdorf Goodman, H.Lorenzo and Ssense, thanks to sparse and quiet fare cut from exquisite materials.

For her fall 2023 presentation in Paris, Leoni worked with a mostly black palette, focusing on shape with layered silhouettes that gave off a protective aura. “I feel in a way that it’s a very strong point of view on style, the black itself, and gives a very sharp point of view on modern womanhood. I think it’s quite necessary at the moment and I feel a responsibility there,” she told WWD.

Setchu Spring 2023 Courtesy of Setchu

Setchu

Born in Kyoto, Japan, Satoshi Kuwata moved to London at the age of 21 to pursue his dream of becoming a fashion designer. During his studies at Central Saint Martins, he worked for Huntsman in Savile Row, where he learned to master his tailoring skills.

Kuwata went on to work with brands including Gareth Pugh in London; Kanye West and Givenchy in Paris; Edun in New York City and Golden Goose in Milan before launching his unisex label in 2020. The brand name Setchu represents the fusion of Japanese and Western concepts, with items like foldable jackets in origami-like constructions.

A winner of Vogue Italia’s “Who Is on Next?” talent search last year, Kuwata grounds his designs in a deep knowledge and respect for different cultures and crafts. “I place all my efforts into a design process imbued with storytelling,” the globe-trotting designer said.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999798536300659}",neutral,0.9999798536300659,0

“The semifinal of the tenth edition of this prize has highlighted a great maturity in the approach and work of the designers,” said Delphine Arnault, the executive vice president of LVMH and CEO of Dior. “Cultural diversity, celebration of traditional crafts and creative audacity define this selection. Naturally, the finalists are fully engaged in dealing with environmental issues and play with the boundaries between menswear and womenswear. Their expertise, their creativity, their uniqueness and their commitment have truly impressed me.”

This year’s panel of judges for the prize include designers like Marc Jacobs, Jonathan Anderson, and Stella McCartney, editors including Edward Enninful and Mel Ottenberg, and models—Bella Hadid and Karlie Kloss among them. On June 7th, the group will commune to choose the winner of the 2023 prize—joining the ranks of past honorees like S.S. Daley, Nensi Dojaka, and Marine Serre—and it seems like they have their work cut out for them. Get to know the nine finalists vying for the ultimate prize, below.

Aaron Esh

Designer: Aaron Esh

Location: United Kingdom

Speciality: Menswear

Many designers create collections as an ode to their city, but Aaron Esh’s BA collection at the London College of Fashion in 2020 was more like a piece of hate mail. Esh, who was living with five flatmates in London and dealing with the aftermath of Brexit and the pandemic as he created his collection, channeled his feelings into the clothes. Loafers detached at the soles, pants slung low, jackets were held together by pins—it was the visualization of London: a fabulous, unaffordable city. By the time he moved on to his MA at Central Saint Martins (a program for which he received the Alexander McQueen scholarship), though, he was ready to look at his native town through a kinder lens, designing a romantic collection of elegant menswear pieces with themes that are still present in his work today. While Esh mostly creates clothes for men, the female influence is obvious, allowing for a modern take on the centuries-old practice of fine tailoring.

Bettter

Designer: Julie Pelipas

Location: Ukraine

Speciality: Womenswear

For years, Julie Pelipas attended fashion shows as a stylist and Vogue Ukraine’s international fashion director; many of her peers admired her impeccable, minimalist street style, often mistaking her sleek, oversize jackets and slouchy pants as Phoebe Philo-era Céline. In reality, they were all prototypes for Bettter. After a decade-and-a-half of working with others’ designs, Pelipas finally took to the sketchbook herself in 2019, creating a line of tailored pieces and chic sportswear for the modern woman. During a season in which “real dressing” has returned to the runway, Pelipas is wholly prepared; designing for real women seems to be the only way she knows how to create garments. Plus, Pelipas is dedicated to sourcing her materials from secondary markets, using deadstock fabric taken from factories. In the past year, Pelipas has brought new life to over 7,000 pieces of clothing that already existed, reissuing old jackets, sweaters, and even sneakers in Bettter’s collections.

Burc Akyol

Designer: Burc Akyol

Location: France

Speciality: Womenswear, menswear, and genderless

Fans: Elizabeth Debicki and Kendall Jenner

Burc Akyol defines his brand as a mixture of sexy and austerity—and yes, he’s aware those are two conflicting adjectives. Looking at his clothes, however, the contrasting descriptors do both seem relevant, especially in a tailored jacket (no shirt worn underneath) paired with satin pants, or a gala-worthy dress whose neckline hangs low enough to allow for just the right amount of cleavage. Akyol—who spent years working in French maisons before launching his eponymous line in 2019—toes a line walked by so many designers: elegant but not stuffy, sexy but not ostentatious. Likely, you’ve already seen Akyol’s work before, on Kendall Jenner at last year’s LACMA Art + Film Gala. Her dress for the event—consisting of a sheer, long-sleeve top and a metallic, low-slung skirt—exemplifies Akyol’s ethos.

Diotima

Designer: Rachel Scott

Location: Jamaica

Speciality: Womenswear

Fans: Gabrielle Union and Ari Lennox

The first LVMH finalist to hail from Jamaica, Rachel Scott uses Diotima to expand the definition of luxury beyond its Euro-centric confines. Jamaican influences are obvious in Diotima’s clothes, as Scott works with artisans in her home country to achieve the crochet technique she has become known for since starting her brand in 2021. Over the past few seasons, the designer has also explored more tailored pieces—cropped suit jackets in muted linen, pencil skirts with an added crochet frill down the side. Scott’s goal is to acknowledge the past without being too nostalgic in order to push Caribbean fashion forward, into the future.

Designer: Raul Lopez

Location: United States

Speciality: Womenswear, menswear, and genderless

Fans: Dua Lipa, Anok Yai, and Julia Fox

If you’re familiar with anyone’s work on this list, it’s likely Raul Lopez’s at Luar. The designer recently won the CFDA’s American Accessory Designer of the Year Award, and last month, his spring 2023 presentation closed out New York Fashion Week. Beginning with the extremely popular Ana bag, Lopez has expanded his label to include streetwear-adjacent, sophisticated, ready-to-wear pieces, at least partially inspired by his previous brand Hood By Air, which he cofounded with Shayne Oliver. Cutout sweaters add flair to traditional workwear, jean shirts are upgraded with comically padded shoulders, and Lopez’s “calle pero elegante” or “street but elegant” influence is clear in each piece he sends down the runway.

Magliano

Designer: Luca Magliano

Location: Italy

Speciality: Menswear

Fans: Dua Lipa

Founded in 2017, Luca Magliano’s namesake brand quickly made a mark on the Italian fashion scene with its grunge and vintage-inspired take on classic menswear. The basics were there—suits, trousers, sweaters—but they were rendered in offbeat colors, with superfluous pockets, and added styling elements that pushed Italian men’s design into a modern era. Clearly, the clothes have resonated with the public, as Magliano is currently carried at over 60 retailers globally. Plus, in December, Milanese holding company and fashion business accelerator Underscore District bought a minority stake in the brand, a deal that will aid Magliano as it enters its next stage of growth.

Paolina Russo

Designers: Paolina Russo and Lucile Guilmard

Locations: Canada (Russo) and France (Guilmard)

Speciality: Womenswear

Fans: Solange Knowles, Rihanna, and NewJeans

Childhood pastimes in Ontario, Canada meet the folkloric French countryside at the knitwear-focused label Paolina Russo. Founded by Russo in 2020, the Canadian designer was joined by her fellow Central Saint Martins graduate, Lucile Guilmard, a year later. With Guilmard came a European sensibility along with new cutting techniques. The result is a line that can be described as: a video game heroine cozies up in her dad’s old Fair Isle sweater. Bright colors, clashing fabrics, and layering are hallmarks of Paolina Russo, and the brand’s clear stage presence is likely why their designs have become favored by artists across genres.

Quira

Designer: Veronica Leoni

Location: Italy

Speciality: Womenswear

Quira is a minimal luxury brand in the vein of Jil Sander and Phoebe Philo’s Céline, two labels Veronica Leoni spent time working at earlier in her career. Named after her seamstress grandmother, Quirina, Quira provides clothing for the stylish CEO and her art gallerist little sister. Tailored coats with tapered waists paired with sheer midi skirts stand next to bright red ruffled knit dresses. But that’s not to say there’s a disconnect between Leoni’s designs—the thread of playful elegance, bold styling, and modern womanhood runs throughout.

Setchu

Designer: Satoshi Kuwata

Location: Japan

Speciality: Genderless

The name of Satoshi Kuwata’s brand, Setchu, comes from the Japanese phrase “wayo setchu,” with “wayo” denoting Japan and the West and “setchu” meaning compromise. According to Kuwata, that says it all: Setchu represents the designer mergning his upbringing in Kyoto with his experiences working in London, Paris, New York, and Milan. Traditional Japanese techniques like origami inspire Kuwata’s designs, but his use of modern fabrics and styling allow for a combination of cultures. Models are (literally) wrapped in leather; cuffs fold up to reveal another one underneath. There’s a playfulness to Setchu that is contrasted by Kuwata’s impressive tailoring skills, and the result is something wholly original.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9987977743148804}",neutral,0.9987977743148804,0

Véronique Courtois, who has headed Guerlain since November 2019, will move across to become president and chief executive of Parfums Christian Dior. She succeeds Laurent Kleitman, who has headed the brand since November 2019, but has decided to leave to pursue other opportunities, according to the company. During this tenure, Kleitman oversaw the business during a “health crisis” and also contributed to its “rapid” digital transformation, LVMH said. Courtois was previously brand general director at Parfums Christian Dior for seven years before moving to Guerlain in 2019.

“The success of Sauvage, the world’s leading fragrance, is a prime example of her remarkable contributions [while at Dior],” said Arnault. “Since 2019, Véronique has also done a tremendous job elevating and rejuvenating Guerlain.”

Read More Dior CEO Beccari to lead Louis Vuitton in LVMH management shuffle Pietro Beccari will replace Michael Burke, Louis Vuitton’s CEO of 10 years, and Delphine Arnault has been named CEO and chairman of Dior in a major executive shakeup.

Gabrielle Saint-Genis Rodriguez, who has headed Make Up For Ever since June 2019, succeeds Courtois as president and chief executive of Guerlain. Charles-Henri Levaillant, who has been digital and client development director at Louis Vuitton since December 2020, has been named president and chief executive of Make Up For Ever.

Arnault said Rodriguez has “spurred dynamic momentum at Make Up For Ever with innovative products and highly effective initiatives”. He also praised Levaillant’s “successful entrepreneurial background” having joined LVMH originally in the strategic department, before moving across to Louis Vuitton in 2020, where he accelerated growth and improved the client experience.

Claude Martinez is taking on the new role of president and CEO of Gaia, LVMH’s group research and innovation centre. He was named managing director of LVMH Perfumes and Cosmetics in 2019 ​​after running Parfums Christian Dior for 19 years, before handing over to Kleitman.

The shakeup comes less than two months after LVMH announced its largest executive reshuffle in years, during which Pietro Beccari became chairman and CEO of Louis Vuitton, and Delphine Arnault took the reins at Christian Dior Couture.

"At LVMH, the legendary Gérald Genta brand is born again - Financial Times","Mon, 27 Mar 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZ0LmNvbS9jb250ZW50L2E2ZjY1YWNjLTYyOTQtNDE3Yi04ZmU2LTRkOTU3OThhMjcwY9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Print this page

The Monégasque ambassador to the Court of St James’s (and, idiosyncratically, Kazakhstan) has been a fixture on London’s diplomatic circuit for more than a decade. You might have seen her at one of the national-day celebrations: the bedrock upon which the ambassadorial social scene is constructed. And if you have ever wanted to relocate to Monaco, then you will have had an interview with her to establish your suitability for life in the principality. A skilled diplomat and the personification of poise and elegance, she gives the impression of having done this all her working life. But this is Evelyne Genta’s second professional incarnation — she was once the business brain behind one of the greatest names in watch design, Gérald Genta.

“I met Gérald at a dinner party in Monte Carlo in the early ’80s,” she says brightly, adding with a smile, “he spent the evening telling me that my watch was ugly.”

It proved to be an unusual but effective chat-up line – the pair married six months later, and she spent much of the final two decades of the 20th century selling remarkable horological creations to the world’s super-rich. Back in the ’80s and ’90s if you were a sultan or sheikh, a king or prince, who had a taste for what she describes as “grande horlogerie” and the money to indulge it, you would have known Madame Genta.

Having died in 2011, Gérald Genta did not live long enough to see the frenzy that has recently surrounded his watches, specifically, the Patek Philippe Nautilus and Audemars Piguet Royal Oak he designed in the 1970s. And his posthumous fame has been a source of pain as well as pride for his widow. “I didn’t want Gérald to be forgotten,” she says. “But nor do I want him to be remembered for just the Nautilus and the Royal Oak. He is so much more than that.”

As if on cue, the handsome, floppy-haired man sitting beside her on the leather sofa interjects. “There are a number of people credited with pulling the Swiss watch industry out of the quartz crisis. And when you look at the watches that the Gérald Genta brand produced during that time: the grande sonnerie, the minute repeaters and the perpetual calendars, he is definitely one of them,” he says.

Gérald is so much more than just the Nautilus and the Royal Oak

Jean Arnault speaks with the impassioned intensity of the young idealist. And he has mastered his material. He can tell you in great detail the difference between grande and petite sonnerie, or rattle off production dates, serial numbers and all manner of other abstruse watchmaking trivia. Such youthful horological experts are more common than you might think. However, this one is unique: as well as knowing the back catalogue of Gérald Genta like a priest knows his catechism, he can actually do something with this knowledge, like reviving the brand.

Now 24, the fifth and youngest son of Bernard Arnault (founder, chairman, and chief executive officer of LVMH) joined the family business in September 2021 when he started working in the watch division of Louis Vuitton. In less than two years he has galvanised what was essentially just another LV-branded product sector into a boutique horology brand to watch. In 2021, Louis Vuitton won two prizes at the Grand Prix d’Horlogerie de Genève.

As a member of the family, he can make things happen. “I was discussing watchmaking with my father and Genta’s name came up,” recalls Arnault. “He said, ‘Don’t we own Genta?’” Gérald Genta had indeed been relatively quiet for the past 20 years as part of Bulgari. “He then said to me: ‘Why don’t you run it?’” Unable to think of a good reason why not, Arnault is relaunching the brand. Gérald Genta will be revived and operated as a standalone brand that will be manufactured at La Fabrique du Temps, LVMH’s state-of-the-art watchmaking factory in Switzerland.

And the first thing that Arnault did was invite Madame Genta to La Fabrique du Temps. “It was incredibly moving for me because I met Enrico Barbasini and Michel Navas,” she says of the complications specialists who have run LFDT since it opened in 2014. “They had been our star watchmakers and had worked really closely with us. Gérald and I would see them every morning.”

There was another surprise reunion awaiting Madame Genta in Arnault’s office. “He had brought four fabulous Gérald Genta pocket watches; they were masterpieces,” she reveals. “When I saw them, I nearly cried because I remembered selling them.”

That was a year ago and they have remained in constant touch since. “From the multiple exchanges we’ve had in the past year, I think I’ve grasped a little bit of the essence of what Genta was back then,” says Arnault.

“He knows his Gérald Genta better than me,” corrects Madame Genta. “He’s gone into great detail. He is a real watch fanatic.” Arnault is clearly rapt with Madame Genta’s anecdotes of life with Gérald: there’s the time he had to fix an emerald bracelet with his Swiss army knife while she distracted a wealthy potentate’s attention. On another occasion, when she tried to tell a wealthy head of state that he could not afford a metre-high solid gold Ferris wheel automaton (each gondola occupied by enamelled Commedia dell’arte figures), because it was destined for another, far wealthier client, His Majesty answered: “Madame, this poor King may not be as rich as your favourite client, but there is still some money in the treasury.”

But for all the entertaining stories this is far from being a nostalgia trip. “I’m not a fan of one-to-one re-editions of what was done in the past, so we’re not going to do that,” says Arnault. “Instead, we are going to take inspiration from what was done with the Gérald Genta brand in the past, and from the thousands of detailed drawings he made, but bring it into the 21st century. We’re keeping volumes very, very low and focusing on the high watchmaking side of things.”

Further details of the watches are expected to be announced later this year, with the first pieces available next year (for hundreds of thousands of pounds). As Arnault is not keen on tribute editions, the watches are intended to be what Genta would be making today, with Navas and Barbasini described as incubators of the project having previously worked for him. As Arnault says, they know the spirit of the brand and can interpret it in a way that is relevant to the third decade of the 21st century.

It is a strategy of which Madame Genta says her late husband would have approved. “Gérald never looked back. He was never interested in the past. It was always the next watch. I am happy that we are moving forward with young people,” she casts a fond glance in Arnault’s direction, “and with some models that Gérald designed, which are very forward-thinking. We can ensure the perennity of the brand – a brand that I was very hurt to see being forgotten. It feels like…” she pauses. “It feels like Gérald is coming home.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999802112579346}",neutral,0.9999802112579346,0

In the role, he oversees all of the group’s 15 beauty brands, organized under Parfums Christian Dior, Guerlain, LVMH Fragrance Brands and Kendo. Rinderknech, who entered LVMH in 2022, also continues leading LVMH Hospitality Excellence, which includes Hôtels Cheval Blanc and Belmond Hotels and trains. He remains a member of the group’s executive committee as well.

“The appointment of Stéphane Rinderknech at the head of the beauty division completes the reorganization of the group by category,” said Bernard Arnault, chairman and CEO of LVMH and head of Financière Agache, the main family holding company, in a statement.

His deep understanding of the beauty industry will help him leverage the unique assets of each of our maisons.”

Reporting to Rinderknech in new appointments are Véronique Courtois, who takes up the reins of Parfums Christian Dior, and Gabrielle Saint-Genis Rodriguez, who now steers Guerlain.

Véronique Courtois

“I am delighted with the appointment of Véronique Courtois, who continues her exceptional career path within the LVMH group,” Arnault said. “Over the seven years during which she was in charge of products and image at Parfums Christian Dior, she significantly elevated the desirability of the maison.

“The success of Sauvage, the world’s leading fragrance, is a prime example of her remarkable contributions,” he added. “Since 2019, Véronique has also done a tremendous job elevating the maison Guerlain. She will draw on her experience to open a new chapter in the growth of Parfums Christian Dior.”

At Dior, Courtois succeeds Laurent Kleitman, who is leaving the company.

“The LVMH group extends its sincere thanks to Laurent for his contributions to the growth, especially during the health crisis, and to the rapid digital transformation of Parfums Christian Dior, as well as for his remarkable human qualities,” LVMH said in the statement. “The group wishes him every success in his future endeavors.”

Saint-Genis Rodriguez for the past four years has served as Make Up For Ever’s CEO.

“Gabrielle Saint-Genis Rodriguez, who has been in the LVMH group for 11 years, followed an admirable journey, meeting many challenges,” Arnault said. “With her leadership and commercial expertise, she was responsible for increasingly important markets at Parfums Christian Dior, contributing to the success of the maison. More recently, she has spurred dynamic momentum at Make Up For Ever with innovative products and highly effective initiatives. Gabrielle has all the required qualities to add wonderful new chapters to the story of maison Guerlain.”

It is the first time Parfums Christian Dior and Guerlain have female CEOs.

Succeeding Rodriguez at Make Up For Ever is Charles-Henri Levaillant, since November 2020 digital and client development director at Louis Vuitton.

“With his successful entrepreneurial background, Charles-Henri Levaillant joined the LVMH group after holding key positions in several other industries,” Arnault said. “At LVMH, he first held a role in the strategic department, gaining a global vision of our business. Since 2020, he has successfully overseen digital developments at Louis Vuitton, accelerating growth and improving the client experience. He will now leverage his experience as he takes up a new operational challenge at the head of Make Up For Ever.”

Meanwhile, Claude Martinez has been appointed chairman and CEO of GAIA, LVMH’s research and innovation center and becomes an adviser on innovation to Arnault.

In November 2019, Martinez stepped down from steering Parfums Christian Dior and took on the title of managing director of LVMH Perfumes and Cosmetics, with oversight of Guerlain, Parfums Givenchy, Parfums Kenzo and Parfums Christian Dior.

“I want to thank Claude for his achievements at Parfums Christian Dior for more than 20 years,” Arnault said. “With his sharp eye and remarkable determination, he has led this magnificent maison to a global leadership position at the very high-end of the market, spreading its unique values of elegance thanks to innovative products, coupled with refined and contemporary communication.

“More recently, he took on a broader role within the beauty division,” the executive said. “I am delighted to see Claude take on the leadership of an initiative with great potential for the LVMH group, our new GAIA research center. I am also pleased that we will benefit from his experience through is role as advisor to topics related to innovation.”

A seasoned beauty executive, Rinderknech spent most of his career at L’Oréal, lastly — between 2019 and 2022 — as the company’s president of the North America Zone, CEO of L’Oréal USA and a member of the group’s executive committee.

For decades there has been no one executive helming LVMH’s Perfumes and Cosmetics division. It’s a big and fast-growing business. In 2022, the division generated sales of 7.72 billion euros, up 17 percent on-year.

LVMH ranked sixth in the most recent WWD Beauty Inc Top 100 listing of beauty manufacturers, which reflected 2021 sales and was published in April 2022.

The grouping of all of LVMH’s fragrance and cosmetics holdings under one executive’s purview comes at a time when the beauty industry’s competitiveness is ramping up.

As groups like L’Oréal keep gaining market share, LVMH’s rival Kering is diving back into the beauty game full-force. As previously reported, Kering in early February revealed it had hired a seasoned Estée Lauder Cos. executive, Raffaella Cornaggia, to develop the beauty category, taking brands such as Bottega Veneta, Balenciaga and others in-house, as starters.

The executive shift in LVMH’s Perfumes and Cosmetics division comes two months after a spate of leadership changes shook the top of Louis Vuitton and Dior, LVMH’s flagship fashion houses. Pietro Beccari was named chairman and CEO of Louis Vuitton and Delphine Arnault was named CEO of Dior.

Rinderknech is a graduate of ISG Business School in Paris. He began at the world’s largest beauty company in 2002, within its American travel retail division, then accrued additional responsibilities when taking on positions in Japan and South Korea.

Rinderknech moved to China in 2011, first as general manager of L’Oréal’s Luxe division, then as head of the Consumer Products division before being promoted to president and CEO of L’Oréal China for all divisions and corporate operations.

Rinderknech became a member of L’Oréal’s executive committee in 2018 and a year later assumed the management helm of L’Oréal USA.

Hailed as a rising star and viable candidate to be CEO of L’Oréal’s global operations one day, Rinderknech was responsible for increasing the company’s China business by 30 percent during his time as CEO of that division. His strength in digital marketing — e-commerce accounted for 40 percent of L’Oréal’s sales in the country when he left — was a key driver behind his appointment in the U.S., where Rinderknech was charged with accelerating L’Oréal’s digital transformation.

At LVMH under Rinderknech is also Stéphanie Medioni, executive president of LVMH Perfumes and Cosmetics, who will retain the responsibility for Aqua di Parma, Benefit Cosmetics, Fresh, Make Up For Ever, Maison Francis Kurkdjian, Loewe Parfums Officine Universelle Buly and Stella by Stella McCartney.

Also reporting to Rinderknech will be Hugues Dusseaux, deputy president of the beauty division; Maud Alvarez-Pereyre, global senior vice president of human resources at LVMH Beauty; Bruno Bavouzet, R&D executive vice president at LVMH, and Jean-Michel Moutin, chief operating officer of LVMH Beauty.

While LVMH is known for growing and grooming executive talent from within, it has recruited a number of high-profile L’Oréal executives in recent years, including Renaud de Lesquen, president and CEO of Givenchy; Damien Bertrand, CEO of Loro Piana, and Pierre-Emmanuel Angeloglou, executive vice president, strategic missions for fashion and leather goods at Louis Vuitton.

The last person to oversee all of LVMH’s beauty holdings was Patrick Choël, who held the title of president of LVMH’s Perfume and Cosmetics division for six-and-a-half years, until retiring from that role in March 2004. That division was restructured after his departure. Under the-then new organization, brand chiefs no longer reported directly to one executive on all business matters.

Martinez, who at the time was president and CEO of Parfums Christian Dior, began also overseeing brand synergies, such as research and development and purchasing, and reported directly to Arnault. Other brand heads began reporting to Antonio Belloni, LVMH’s group managing director.

Belloni and Chantal Gaemperle, executive vice president of human resources and synergies at LVMH, have helped spearhead the divisional shifts at the group.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.998261034488678}",neutral,0.998261034488678,0
Maturity and Community Emerged at 2023 LVMH Prize Showroom - WWD,"Thu, 02 Mar 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigwFodHRwczovL3d3ZC5jb20vZmFzaGlvbi1uZXdzL2Rlc2lnbmVyLWx1eHVyeS9tYXR1cml0eS1jb21tdW5pdHktMjAyMy1sdm1oLXByaXplLXNob3dyb29tLWRlbHBoaW5lLWFybmF1bHQtc29waGllLXR1cm5lci0xMjM1NTYwMjg4L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS — As far as the 22 semifinalists of the 2023 LVMH Prize gathered at the luxury conglomerate’s headquarters during Paris Fashion Week to showcase their collections are concerned, everyone’s a winner.

After all, they have already managed to distinguish themselves among a record 2,400 applications.

And now, they had two days to meet industry experts — not just to impress them, but to spark all manner of future-thinking conversations.

“It’s remarkable how the LVMH Prize showroom has evolved over the years,” said Delphine Arnault, the force behind the 10-year-old initiative and a key talent scout at family-controlled luxury conglomerate LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton. “This year’s 22 semifinalists are showing great maturity.”

Not only did the group have the creative chops to make the cut, but “they have thought through their business plans, brand positioning, sourcing and production, and — thanks primarily to Instagram — they are already savvy about communication, which is a major shift,” she continued.

Add to that the fact that all competitors are well-versed in key issues of responsibility, diversity and inclusiveness, and “it’s going to be a tough choice,” Arnault predicted.

Hailing from the U.K., Ukraine, France, Nigeria, South Korea, Jamaica, Brazil, Estonia, India, China, the U.S., Italy, Taiwan, Canada, Japan and Sweden, the semifinalists highlighted the talent competition’s “truly international reach,” according to Arnault.

The LVMH Prize showroom was certainly a must on the busy and buzzy Paris calendar, with guests deeming its cocktail the party of the week. The guest list was a who’s-who of fashion, from LVMH executives, including the group’s director of image and environment Antoine Arnault and LVMH Fashion Group chairman and CEO Sidney Toledano, to designers Stella McCartney, Proenza Schouler’s Jack McCollough and Lazaro Hernandez, as well as the prize’s 2019 winner, Thebe Magugu.

Sophie Turner, who has long been an ambassador for Louis Vuitton, said she’d jumped at the opportunity to be the ambassador of the semifinal and host the evening. “Working with an established brand like Louis Vuitton is great, but I’ve never been lucky enough to witness the birth of a great brand,” she said.

As an actress, she said it’s inspiring to see creatives from another genre, especially after an hour spent hearing all the nitty-gritty details from concept to materials that went into each collection. “It’s a meeting of the minds, and I thrive on that creativity. While it’s not my world, I appreciate and love it so much,” she said, wishing the prize could go to all of them.

And inspired by the candidates, she revealed she would love to do a collaboration with a fashion house, although she didn’t feel she could design on her own, as she hadn’t put in the kind of hard work these designers had put in over the years.

Coco Rocha said it was heartening to see the culturally diverse group of young designers, which demonstrated how the industry is changing. Plus, it felt like the ushering of a new generation since “when you have someone like LVMH, who knows what they’re doing, backing these designers, that person is probably going to thrive,” she added.

Magugu, who won the prize in 2019, remembered nothing of the night he won, except that he felt extremely nervous. “I hope that everyone here tonight doesn’t have that feeling and can actually absorb where they are and what they have already achieved,” he said.

Earlier in the day, the class of 2023 explained the many ways they had their eyes on the Prize — and beyond.

Marrknull’s Wei Wang and Tian Shi said being shortlisted for the LVMH Prize was the beginning of a new chapter for their Beijing-based label. With the visibility it brought, the pair were keen to use this opportunity to expand their international awareness and business, after “a good few years” in China before the pandemic.

“It’s a very good step for the next steps,” said Paris-based designer Burç Akyol, keen to meet a whole spectrum of professionals over the two-day showcase. “It’s the best room in the world for this.”

This Galliano-era Dior and Ghesquière-era Balenciaga alum was showcasing the latest designs of his unisex brand which “still have the heritage of [his] father,” a tailor who worked for Paris’ couture houses.

A win at the prize would help him grow categories that will allow him to “dress you from the moment you wake up to the red carpet” but also ensure he serves those who resonate with his universe. “I hate the idea of letting people go home and think [the brand] is not for them because it’s too expensive,” he said.

But even without, he’s going to make the most of the experience to get his name out there, with or without wholesale business, too.

After the ravages the pandemic wrought on retail, he feels being agile is “the clever way to go because at the end of the day, we’re artists and artisans as well. Let’s not forget what we can do because you’re going to stand alone at some point with your sewing machine — [Azzedine] Alaïa did for years,” he said.

Likewise, Rome-based designer Veronica Leoni, a “veteran of the system who is trying to apply the best of it to a mini [brand],” felt the prize and its proximity to fashion heavyweights was already her win.

“I would rather be visible for my product than for a [position], so I think it was a nice way to put the focus on the collection and the brand, and be into a system that I recognize as familiar with my training” working alongside the likes of Jil Sander, Phoebe Philo and designing for The Row.

Quira, launched in 2021, is meant as a brand with a lighter footprint fit for a tough moment in the industry. Now in its fourth collection, it has garnered more than 20 stockists, including Bergdorf Goodman, H.Lorenzo and Ssense, thanks to sparse and quiet fare cut from exquisite materials.

Or, as Leoni quipped, she’s “hoping to build up a community through addiction to beautiful product.”

Beyond their own brands, designers were also keen to continue nourishing the communities they’d build, from crafters to consumers.

Designer Faith Oluwajimi produces his collection in Lagos, Nigeria, and calls on local artisans to produce the knitwear and tailored garments of eight-year-old label Bloke.

An ethical brand, it uses organic yarns and deadstock fabrics, non-animal leather and accents of recycled wood and coconut shells. It incorporates traditional dyeing and artisanal embroidery, and Oluwajimi’s built a workshop to keep those handicrafts alive.

“We work with artisans from the community and that is a focus of our collection, and we try to input a lot of personal practices in our work,” he said. “It’s very important to build that community, because it’s the soul of the brand. So with that there are new ideas springing forward. Of course, everything has to fall in line with the ethos and ambition of the brand, but at the end of the day what drives that ethos and identity are all the amalgamations of these creatives and artisans that I work with.”

Now, the time feels right to bring them and the other creatives emerging from Lagos, which has become a hotspot for design, film production and global music superstars in recent years, to the world.

“It’s become this very important melting pot and all that energy goes into the collection. It’s been an amazing experience to be me, from Nigeria, here in Paris as a self-taught designer. It’s a lot, and we’ll see more of that,” he said.

The showcase and ensuing exposure was also the perfect moment for messages that went beyond putting product in the hands — or on the radar — of a consumer.

“I just wanted people to know that upcycling can be really sexy,” said Bettter founder Julie Pelipas, who feels being able to see and touch her designs that started their life as “boring menswear” and are now evening gowns, sexy multiwear trousers or a punk take on a wedding dress showed “how cool, how fun” rethinking existing items is.

Launched in 2020 in the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic, the brand “lost a year” as she delicately put it, due to the war in Ukraine, but she’s raring to make connections that will allow the brand to scale and truly become a solution for the stock currently clogging brands.

For Giseok Cho, best known in the industry for his haunting photographic work, said being shortlisted cemented the fact that his five-year-old label Kusikohc is not a hobby, he joked.

“The worst-case scenario is that you just meet people you’ve admired for ages,” quipped Kartik Kumra, the 23-year-old self-taught designer behind Indian craft-focused menswear label Karu Research.

Working with traditional handcraft textiles that require no electricity to produce thanks to the use of handlooms and natural dyes for its prints, the two-year-old brand stocked at Mr. Porter and some 30 doors around the world counts the U.S. as its largest market since Kumra launched it while studying economics at the University of Pennsylvania.

“Sustainability is inbuilt into the design because the only way to make the product is the way it’s been done for hundreds of years,” rather than something being an afterthought, he explained.

Whether or not he wins, Kumra is already saving up for a brick-and-mortar store as he feels that would benefit the brand and its tactile focus, based on previous pop-up experiences. “It will go a long way because wholesale margins aren’t that great,” he said, naming New York as a potential destination that would create a foothold for international development by making it easier to ship from than India.

He credits the brand’s early success to having “tapped into some sort of South Asian diasporic pride” that had people traveling to discover the brand “because they’re excited about their culture being shown in a way it hadn’t before.”

“To us, this is not a competition but a celebration for our family,” said Michael Hsieh, who founded Taiwan-based label Namesake with brothers Steve and Richard three years ago, after initially opening a select shop carrying brands they found cool.

On the rack behind them were pieces highlighting the blend of weaving fabrications and sportswear inspirations with a dash of tailoring that they built their brand on. A hand-crocheted but still machine-washable blouson using yarn and recycled paper was a striking example.

What they want to get of this whole LVMH Prize experience is the creative boost that stems from talking with their peers and industry insiders but also the exposure that will attract those who recognize themselves in this trio of basketball-loving, science-graduated fashion entrepreneurs.

“Being from Taipei, growing up in Tokyo and moving to the U.S., we’ve been outsiders to any community our whole lives,” he continued. “Our community is this outsider power that has love for basketball, sports or fashion and [is] using clothing as a language to make friends.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9958617687225342}",neutral,0.9958617687225342,0
Who owns Sephora? - Business Model Analyst,"Tue, 21 Mar 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiMmh0dHBzOi8vYnVzaW5lc3Ntb2RlbGFuYWx5c3QuY29tL3doby1vd25zLXNlcGhvcmEv0gE2aHR0cHM6Ly9idXNpbmVzc21vZGVsYW5hbHlzdC5jb20vd2hvLW93bnMtc2VwaG9yYS9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Who owns Sephora? Sephora is owned by LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, which is a luxury goods conglomerate. LVMH owns several other brands that are organized into various divisions. Sephora brand, in particular, is organized under the “perfumes and cosmetics” division of LVMH. The LVMH conglomerate is currently being led by Bernard Arnault, who is the CEO and chairman of LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton.

Brief History of Sephora

Dominique Mandonnaud founded Sephora in 1970. He opened the first Sephora store in Limoges, France. Dominique Mandonnaud wanted his beauty store to be different from the traditional ones, as he was dissatisfied with the way traditional stores focus only on sales. He designed Sephora to offer personalized experiences to customers. He was able to achieve the aim by organizing his products by category instead of by brand. Also, he hired beauty advisors to advise customers and provide recommendations when necessary. He even allowed customers to test products before they bought them to let customers see how the products felt and looked on them. Sephora started expanding in the 1990s. LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton acquired Sephora in 1997. LVMH provided large financial resources to help Sephora grow internationally after the acquisition. In 1998, Sephora opened its flagship store in New York City. The company soon began to acquire a number of smaller chains in foreign countries to expand as quickly as possible.

Sephora has now grown into a reputable company operating over 2600 stores in 38 countries across the world. To date, Sephora specializes in the sales of beauty products like cosmetics, fragrances, and skincare products. However, unlike in its early days, the company now has a strong online presence. Hence, customers don’t usually walk into Sephora stores to learn about beauty products anymore. Instead, they check Sephora’s website to learn about various beauty products. The company tries its best to enhance the online shopping experience. For instance, Sephora invested well in technologies like augmented reality and artificial intelligence so that its online customers can enjoy experiences very similar to the ones they get from physical Sephora stores.

Brief History of Dominique Mandonnaud

Dominique Mandonnaud is a French entrepreneur born in 1951 in Marseille, France. His family operated a chain of perfumeries while he was growing up. He worked for his family business at a young age, and that was when he developed an interest in fashion stores. He was able to expand Sephora’s business considerably after he founded it in 1970. His unique approach that focuses on personalized customer experience has had an impact on the industry to date. Dominique Mandonnaud is credited with revolutionizing how beauty products are marketed and sold.

Brief History of Bernard Arnault

Bernard Arnault, the CEO and chairman of LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, is a key figure regarding Sephora’s ownership. In 1989, he became the majority owner of LVMH Moët Hennessy. Bernard Arnault was born in Roubaix, France, in 1949. He studied engineering at the École Polytechnique in Paris. He started his career as an engineer in his father’s construction firm, Ferret-Savinel. Furthermore, he eventually became chairman of the construction firm and renamed the company to Férinel Inc, shifting the company’s focus to real estate. Bernard Arnault started acquiring some French luxury brands in the 1980s. In 1987, Henri Racamier, the chairman of LVMH, invited Bernard Arnault to invest in LVMH, which he did. In 1989, he was able to increase his investment further to become the majority owner and chairman of LVMH.

Impact of LVMH Ownership on Sephora

Boosts Sephora’s Reputation

The brand value of Sephora has increased greatly ever since LVMH acquired it. Sephora now enjoys LVMH’s luxury image. The boosted Sephora’s reputation has helped the brand to build trust among its customers and stand out among its competitors.

Provision of Larger Resources

LVMH provides both financial and non-financial resources to Sephora. These resources have helped Sephora grow bigger and serve its customers better. For instance, Sephora now has access to various in-store technologies to operate more efficiently. The company also has abundant financial resources to carry out research and product development.

Provision of Luxury brands

LVMH has lots of luxury brands under its portfolio. Sephora has access to all those luxury brands. Such easy access to lots of luxury brands differentiates Sephora from its competitors. Sephora’s customers can confidently walk into any Sephora store when they need products from luxury brands like Christian Dior, Fendi Givenchy, and lots more.

Provision of Marketing Support

LVMH has an outstanding wealth of marketing experience. LVMH’s team of marketing professionals provides support and guidance to Sephora when necessary. Also, LVMH cross-promotes Sephora with the other luxury brands under its management. These practices have helped Sephora create a very broad awareness.

Favorable Collaborations

LVMH helps Sephora secure favorable collaboration and partnership deals. For instance, LVMH once helped Sephora secure a partnership deal with Huda Beauty. At that time, newly launched products of Huda Beauty were available only at Sephora, driving lots of traffic to Sephora’s stores. LVMH’s relationship with top companies and its team of experienced negotiators are extremely instrumental to Sephora while seeking collaborations.

Who Controls Sephora?

Although LVMH owns Sephora, LVMH exerts only a small level of control over Sephora’s operation. Sephora operates as a separate entity, having its own management team and board of directors. The Sephora board of directors oversees the company’s operation, so LVMH doesn’t really do too many overseeing roles. However, a few representatives of LVMH are part of Sephora’s board of directors.

Conclusion

Sephora is one of the largest beauty retailers worldwide, and it is owned by LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, though it operates independently, having its own board of directors. LVMH’s ownership of Sephora is a mutually beneficial arrangement for both Sephora and LVMH. The ownership has helped Sephora expand internationally to the level where it is today.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999923706054688}",neutral,0.9999923706054688,0

From Tiffany to Daniel Roth: LVMH's Hard Luxury Push - The Fashion Law,"Tue, 28 Mar 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWZhc2hpb25sYXcuY29tL2Zyb20tdGlmZmFueS10by1kYW5pZWwtcm90aC1hLWhhcmQtbHV4dXJ5LXB1c2gtaXMtdW5kZXJ3YXktYXQtbHZtaC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"At LVMH, fashion and leather goods are the name of the game. While soft luxury is the clear bread winner for the group – driving almost 50 percent of its $71.5 billion in revenue in 2021, the luxury giant (and similarly-situated companies) is placing increased emphasis on hard luxury, angling to bolster its Watches and Jewelry division, a category where rivals like Swiss conglomerate Richemont have traditionally held the upper hand. The most obvious indication of this focus was its mega-merger with Tiffany & Co., which saw LVMH splash out a cool $15.8 billion in 2021 to acquire the New York-headquartered jewelry brand. It has since embarked on a sweeping revamp of iconic jewelry brand, complete with an aggressive attempt to lure millennials by way of buzzy marketing and new offerings, including a bracelet, the Lock, that is being positioned to compete with Cartier’s much-coveted Love bracelet.

Since the Tiffany & Co. merger, LVMH also indicated its growing ambitions in the hard luxury realm by way of a recent reorganizational effort, in which it brought most of its watches and jewelry brands under the purview of Stéphane Bianchi, president of the group’s Watches and Jewelry Division. The move serves to “frame [each brand’s] focus within a total hard luxury strategy,” per LVMH, and “enhance sharing of knowledge and resources for faster progress.”

Now look beyond these headline-garnering developments, and a quieter endeavor appears to be in the works. LVMH is revamping a formerly dormant name under its umbrella: Daniel Roth, the Swiss watch brand that the group added to its arsenal when it acquired Bulgari back in 2011 in a 3.7 billion euros ($5.2 billion at the time) deal that reportedly saw it beat out rivals Richemont and Kering (then still PPR) in the process.

Reviving Daniel Roth

A reintroduction of the Daniel Roth is still in relatively early stages. In September, counsel for Louis Vuitton Malletier filed two applications for registration for the “Daniel Roth” name for use in Classes 9 (spectacles, smart watches, etc.) and 14 (jewelry, wristwatches, etc.) in France and Switzerland, respectively. (Bulgari Horlogerie SA amassed dozens of trademark registrations for “Daniel Roth” for use on similar goods in the late 1990s and early 2000s in countries ranging from Singapore and Japan to Switzerland and Italy. It was also granted a few registrations for the source-indicating face of Roth’s Small Seconds timepiece – but it is not necessarily clear whether those registrations, if challenged, would be deemed valid in light of a lack of consistent use by Bulgari.)

Speaking briefly about the budding revival effort, Jean Arnault, Louis Vuitton’s Marketing and Product Development Director for watches, told the Financial Times, “We decided with Bulgari that we would jointly build the [Daniel Roth] company as a separate entity of LVMH, respecting its high watchmaking roots.” 24-year-old Arnault’s focus right now is primarily on the twentieth anniversary of Louis Vuitton’s Tambour timepiece and a new watch-making prize, but he hinted that 2023 will be the year for Daniel Roth, saying, “Next year is going to be something interesting.”

LVMH formally unveiled the “revival [of Daniel Roth] as an independent brand” on February 23, complete with the launch of the company’s website, which teases a “limited series” of 20 pieces of the Tourbillon Souscription watch.

Heritage, History & Scale

As for why LVMH is opting to position Daniel Roth to sit prominently alongside its other watch brands, including Bulgari, Chaumet, TAG Heuer, Fred, Hublot and Zenith, as well as Louis Vuitton, Dior, and Tiffany & Company, which also offer up timepieces, the move falls neatly in line with a broader practice of companies – including LVMH – reviving dormant luxury brands.

From a practical standpoint, it is generally a bit more straightforward – and maybe a bit less risky – to revive existing brands than to create entirely new ones. “For designers, it is easier to start from something than a blank page,” according to Arnaud de Lummen, whose private investment company Luvanis has successfully reintroduced and sold formerly defunct brands, such Moynat, Vionnet, and Poiret. “On the business side,” he previously told WWD that reviving a dormant brand “can be less onerous” than starting a new brand or taking over and revamping an existing one that might come with “large management and creative structures, existing supplier relations, and a risk of [things like] hidden debts.”

At the same time, defunct-but-storied names bring with them something that groups like LVMH look for in acquisition targets: Heritage that can be leveraged to attract luxury consumers (and premium pricing), and the Daniel Roth brand is no exception. The draw for LVMH likely stems from Mr. Roth’s prevailing reputation as “a genius of modern independent watchmaking, who is respected amongst the best watch collectors in the world,” and the company’s “unparalleled history” in the contemporary watchmaking space, WatchBox chairman Danny Govberg tells TFL.

Also not to be overlooked is the value that comes with the unique shape of what Govberg calls the “iconic” Daniel Roth watch case, which acts as a well-established indicator of source for the brand in the eyes of true watch aficionados.

Logistically, Govberg says that LVMH is smart to separate the Daniel Roth brand out from Bulgari, where it has lived since the 2011 acquisition. In the wake of the Bulgari deal, which also saw LVMH snap up Gérald Genta SA, along with the manufacturing “teams and knowledge” from both the Roth and Genta brands, LVMH would incorporate elements of the celebrated watchmakers’ designs into Bulgari offerings. “Their decades of expertise helped lay the foundation for Bulgari as an unrivaled force in the world of Haute Horlogerie,” the Italian luxury brand boasts on its website. Since then, Bulgari has taken off in its own right, and does not need to rely on Genta or Roth to drive demand, per Govberg, thereby, paving the way for each of these brands to stand on their own. He also notes that attempts by Bulgari to offer up mashups of sorts of Bulgari and Genta, and Bulgari and Roth timepieces “never really took off,” likely further incentivizing LVMH to facilitate a spin-off, of sorts, of the Roth brand.

Not limited to a reintroduction of Daniel Roth, “Gérald Genta will be revived and operated as a standalone brand that will be manufactured at La Fabrique du Temps, LVMH’s state-of-the-art watchmaking factory in Switzerland,” the FT confirmed on March 28, reporting that “further details of the watches are expected to be announced later this year, with the first pieces available next year (for hundreds of thousands of pounds).”

In terms of timing, revamping the Daniel Roth and Genta brands makes sense, as demand for the offerings of independent (and in Roth and Genta’s cases, formerly independent) watch companies has “exploded over the past four or five years,” Govberg contends. Watch collectors – from the wealthiest players in this space to budding younger collectors – have increasingly educated themselves about some of these more niche names in the world of horology, in many cases, during Covid-19 lockdowns, and added to their collections accordingly. This has led to a spike in popularity and prices, and chances are, demand for and the price tags of watches in this segment of the market have room to grow even further.

As for what LVMH has planned for Daniel Roth, the French conglomerate will almost certainly not attempt to aggressively scale the brand to match the volumes and revenues associated with other properties under its umbrella. What is more probable, according to Govberg, is that the group will approach the revamp with a “long term view,” releasing Daniel Roth watches in “very small” quantities, maybe 500 to 1,000 watches per year at most. Such an effort may not necessarily move the needle significantly in terms of LVMH revenue, but it will undeniably impact the credibility of its Watches & Jewelry group to be able to say that it is offering such “top of class” timepieces.

The timing also makes sense in light of LVMH’s broader efforts to compete in the hard luxury segment, where it has room to grow. MT Capital Research analysts asserted in a note in October that “there is a structural opportunity” for the group as a result of “the lack of name-brand penetration in this area (approximately 20 percent worldwide).” Pointing to continued growth of LVMH’s main jewelry and watch brands, such as Bulgari and Tiffany & Co., as well as the impending re-introduction of names like Daniel Roth, MT Capital says that this represents “an exciting prospect, [and] an interesting opportunity for the next decade.”

LVMH chooses limestone-based material for Ole Henriksen's new CC Stick - Premium beauty,"Mon, 20 Mar 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnByZW1pdW1iZWF1dHluZXdzLmNvbS9lbi9sdm1oLWNob29zZXMtbGltZXN0b25lLWJhc2VkLDIxNzI20gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"On their way to switch the components of their beauty packaging to more environment friendly options, LVMH has chosen a material partly derived from limestone for the launch of Olehenriksen’s new Banana Bright+ Vitamin CC Stick.

The product’s primary packaging is made of Limex pellets, a material containing more than 50% inorganic material like calcium carbonate. Developed and distributed by Japanese supplier TBM, Limex is presented as a more sustainable alternative to petroleum-based ABS and PP resins typically used in cosmetic packaging components.

Environmental benefits

Thanks to is composition, Limex helps reduce greenhouse gas emissions compared to conventional plastics while being recyclable, claims TBM.

According to the supplier, the injection molding grade of Limex can be used to produce a large variety of cosmetic containers – from lipsticks to jars – with the existing plastic molding equipment and without any additional machinery.

Combined with a secondary packaging made of recyclable FSC-certified cardboard, TBM says the material offers significant benefits in terms of sustainability, while being in line with the aesthetic expectations of the brand thanks to a luxurious matte texture and feel.

Earlier this year, LVMH’s beauty division announced a partnership with Dow in order to integrate biosourced, recycled and recyclable plastics into their packaging. The goal of the luxury giant is that its packaging will contain zero plastic from virgin fossil resources in a near future.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9175352454185486}",positive,0.9175352454185486,1
What is 'cosmetopoeia' and why is LVMH getting behind it? - Vogue Business,"Tue, 07 Mar 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZvZ3VlYnVzaW5lc3MuY29tL3N1c3RhaW5hYmlsaXR5L3doYXQtaXMtY29zbWV0b3BvZWlhLWFuZC13aHktaXMtbHZtaC1nZXR0aW5nLWJlaGluZC1pdNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The programme seeks to understand and preserve the “huge cosmetopoeia potential” that exists in African forests, in the form of ingredients such as Padouk (pterocarpus soyauxii), a large tree in Gabon from which a powder can be used as a traditional mask or mixed with oil for use in traditional cosmetics. Another tree, Moabi (Baillonella toxisperma), produces seeds that communities collect to make butter for cooking and cosmetics, and according to Cosmetic Valley, cooperatives in northern Gabon collect the fruit and market cosmetic products made from it.

Preserving this knowledge is crucial to biodiversity conservation, Cosmetic Valley argues. “The scientific progress of the 20th century has often left aside traditional knowledge in medicine, as in cosmetics. That this magnificent world cultural and natural heritage is not — or is so little — recorded, becomes a systemic problem. The erosion of [traditional] knowledge could lead to the disappearance of an important part of the common history that unites humans and their environment,” the coalition says in the statement, explaining that climate change and biodiversity loss threaten the survival of plants that are linked to traditional practices. “Cosmetopoeia is thus a lever for biodiversity conservation that drives a new dynamic for a better knowledge of the traditional uses of plants.”

Cosmetic Valley, which formed as a “competitiveness cluster” of French perfume and cosmetics companies in 2005 — and counts Puig France, L'Oréal and Guerlain among its members and LVMH general secretary Marc-Antoine Jamet as president — says the endowment fund will be supported by an industry consortium of about 10 companies. These have not been finalised yet, but will include both “large corporations and SMEs”. The consortium will then define the strategy and priorities of the fund.

As a concept, it seems like a stretch for LVMH, which is not only one of the world’s largest corporate behemoths, but has also lagged behind some of its biggest competitors when it comes to embracing ambitious sustainability initiatives. However, the group has changed its tone significantly in the last year and a half, and if the cosmetopoeia effort proves effective — and is welcomed and embraced by local communities — it could symbolise a victory for Indigenous communities, biodiversity conservation advocates and other activists who have been saying, in increasingly unequivocal terms, that the world can only achieve global conservation targets “with the leadership of Indigenous peoples and local communities and with full recognition of their rights”. These calls have grown in tandem with the increasing body of research finding higher levels of biodiversity on Indigenous-managed lands.

“Cosmetics are as old as the world. They relate to humanity, children or the elderly, women or men, on the whole Earth. They originate in natural resources. Preserving them is an imperative,” Jamet says in the statement. “Knowing their multiple properties is a wealth for all — those who collect and produce as well as those who enjoy their benefits. From there, our aim is to contribute to the constitution of sustainable sectors, respectful of the planet, local traditions and ecosystems, and meeting the needs of our research and of the current cosmetics market.”

Will LVMH Try to Take Over Richemont (Or Cartier)? - JCK,"Mon, 06 Mar 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmpja29ubGluZS5jb20vZWRpdG9yaWFsLWFydGljbGUvbHZtaC10YWtlLW92ZXItcmljaGVtb250LWNhcnRpZXIv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Last week, Swiss newspaper Finanz und Wirtschaft reported there were “whispers” that LVMH wanted to acquire rival conglomerate Richemont—and had its sights particularly set on Richemont star performer Cartier.

The story was pretty vague on its sourcing, and some publications, such as the newsletter Miss Tweed and the Chinese luxury publication Jing Daily, dismissed it outright. Bloomberg argued that Kering would be a better partner. (Richemont reportedly spurned a merger offer with Kering in 2021.) Richemont’s stock didn’t move much following the report.

But there are reasons there might be something to it.

For one, LVMH hasn’t shot this down, which would be extremely easy to do. It hasn’t even declined comment, nor has it issued the standard “we don’t comment on rumors.” It seems to not mind this story being out there.

For another, LVMH likes to buy things. A former Signet exec once told me its chairman was an “acquisition junkie.” But he has nothing on Bernard Arnault, who not only has around 75 companies under his wing but also famously engaged in frenzied but fruitless attempts to win control of Hermès and Gucci. Last year, Axios reported LVMH had held “exploratory discussions” about buying Ralph Lauren.

Arnault has quite the trophy case, but when he looks at what prestige brands he’s missing, Cartier is probably up there.

Finally, this isn’t the first time this has been discussed. When it looked like LVMH would cancel its deal to buy Tiffany, Bloomberg suggested it might instead go for Richemont.

LVMH’s 2021 acquisition of Tiffany was an attempt to gain a greater foothold in jewelry—the one area where Richemont’s traditionally topped it. Cartier is a big reason for that. Arnault always “likes to be number one,” an analyst said in 2019.

Some might say that LVMH’s $16 billion acquisition of Tiffany—its biggest buy ever—would keep it busy. But Tiffany’s results have been strong, and LVMH is already doing a victory lap with the brand, with Fast Company proclaiming Tiffany has executed “the fastest turnaround ever.” (The pandemic almost certainly helped.)

Last year, activist investor Bluebell tried to get former LVMH exec Francesco Trapani a seat on the Richemont’s board. That was shot down, after Richemont chair Johann Rupert argued Trapani “has a long history of close relationship with the LVMH group and its main shareholder.”

“Clearly, Rupert thought Trapani could be seen as a Trojan horse,” Jon Cox, an analyst at French financial services firm Kepler Chevreux, told Finanz und Wirtschaft. “That was one of the reasons for the strong opposition to the proposal.”

Perhaps they were aware what happened a previous time Trapani joined a board. In 2017, he joined the board of Tiffany, thanks to pressure from a different activist investor (Jana Partners). According to WWD, Trapani pushed for Bulgari veteran Alessandro Bogliolo to take over as CEO.

In 2019, LVMH made its initial bid for Tiffany. A later lawsuit noted that LVMH’s bid came one day before Tiffany’s board meeting, the date of which was “not publicly disclosed.”

Tiffany eventually “advised Trapani that he would not be indemnified in his role as director in the event that he breached his duty of loyalty to Tiffany,” the court papers said. He was recused from discussions about the acquisition and resigned after LVMH’s bid was accepted.

In a post-mortem, Reuters said:

Arnault relied on the close-knit connections that [LVMH managing director Antonio] Belloni had forged with Tiffany’s CEO [Alessandro] Bogliolo and board member Francesco Trapani back in 2011 when the pair worked at Bulgari, the sources said.

Their established relationship helped move the deal along swiftly and gave LVMH an advantage in its approach to Tiffany that few rivals could have emulated, they added.

Some feel that Cartier occupies a bit of a real estate in LVMH’s mind. According to a lawsuit filed in 2022—it was recently settled—Tiffany employees “repeatedly and knowingly solicited and received confidential Cartier information” from an ex-employee who came to work at the store. Tiffany denied the allegation.

This could come down to the personalities and egos of the people involved.

The initial Swiss report said that Richemont chair Rupert opposed a deal with LVMH. On the other hand, there’s been ongoing questions about whether the 72-year-old chair has a succession plan. He’s certainly been cagey on the subject, arguing “the minute you disclose it, the designated person immediately is under scrutiny.” But if he does want to cash out, he’d likely sell the entire business, not just one large component.

LVMH and Richemont are the two largest luxury conglomerates in the world. A tie-up would be huge. If LVMH won control of just Cartier, that would also be huge. A few years back, that might not have been a problem. But now, antitrust officials in both Europe and the United States have gotten more aggressive. Any possible merger of this size and scale would be carefully looked at.

Does LVMH want Cartier? Let’s just say, it seems to want everything. That doesn’t mean it will get it.

There’s a lease out for the company to move its American headquarters to Olayan Group’s 550 Madison Avenue, the New York Post reported. It will be relocating from its digs at 19 East 57th Street.

Should a long-term lease be finalized, LVMH will occupy 150,000 square feet of Olayan’s redesigned tower with an asking rent of $190 per square foot.

LVMH would have some fashionable company at 550 Madison Avenue. Hermès signed a lease to relocate its headquarters to 72,000 square feet at the property, while insurance firm Chubb has signed on for 240,000 square feet at the 800,000-square-foot property.

LVMH is also planning to move its Louis Vuitton store to the Trump Organization’s 6 East 57th Street, taking 36,000 square feet of retail space. Tiffany & Co. — an LVMH subsidiary — occupies the space, but is set to move to 727 Fifth Avenue after that property’s redevelopment is complete.

NikeTown formerly occupied the space, where Tiffany has a sublease. Negotiations for the Louis Vuitton deal directly involved former president Donald Trump and the space is connected to Trump Tower.

Trump himself hinted at a possible move last month when he took to Truth Social to detail a Mar-a-Lago dinner with Alex Arnault, Tiffany executive and new owner of an $18 million home at 30 Park Place.

Louis Vuitton’s lease is reportedly for five years, pegged at as much as $20 million per year. The luxury French brand has occupied a 15-story building at 1 East 57th Street, used for both retail and offices.

Robin Zendell represented LVMH in-house as its exclusive retail broker. Zendell did not respond to the Post’s request for comment.

Trump has been looking for tenants to fill the 74,000-square-foot lease after the expiration of the Tiffany’s lease. The space was controlled by SL Green and Wharton Properties, which decided not to extend their lease upon its expiration last year.

One will soon get the golden ticket to propel their brand to new heights.

Since its dawn, the LVMH Prize has trampolined mass talent into fashion’s stratosphere. Each year we’re brought face-to-face with audacious designs reflective of modern challenges. At the end of the cycle, one lucky finalist walks away with a 300,000-euro endowment and a tailored mentorship by LVMH. With this mentorship, they’ll learn the ins and outs of sustainable development, communication, copyright and corporate legal aspects, as well as marketing and the financial management of a brand from the experts themselves.

Today, a star-studded panel of experts—including Jonathan Anderson, Maria Grazia Chiuri, Nicolas Ghesquière, Marc Jacobs, Kim Jones, Nigo, Stella McCartney, Silvia Venturini Fendi, Delphine Arnault, Jean-Paul Claverie, and Sidney Toledano—announces the nine competing panelists to ascend to the next ring.

The nine competing finalists are Aaron Esh from the United Kingdom, BETTTER by Julie Pelipas from Ukraine, Burc Akyol from France, DIOTIMA by Rachel Scott from Jamaica, LUAR by Raul Lopez from the United States, Magliano by Luca Magliano from Italy, Paolina Russo by Paolina Russo—from Canada— and Lucile Guilmard—from France, Quira by Veronica Leoni from Italy, and SETCHU by Satoshi Kuwata from Japan.

This edition of the LVMH Prize for Young Fashion Designers is markedly distinguished from the rest. For one, it’s the Prize’s 10-year anniversary. It’s also worth noting that 2023’s eclectic range of finalists might just be the most diverse the Prize has seen yet. Whether in their cultural backgrounds or experience in the industry, each participant brings a unique skill set to the table.

Take a peek at this year’s nine finalists. One will soon get the golden ticket to propel their brand to new heights.

Aaron Esh

A Central Saint Martins graduate and founder of his namesake brand, Aaron Esh challenges the bygone concept of stoic masculinity with designs that embrace fluidity, romance, and vulnerability through the male gaze.

BETTTER

Julie Pelipas launched BETTTER, an upcycling system and platform, in 2019, where she specializes in sustainable womenswear. While BETTTER might be relatively new to the scene, Pelipas is no rookie. Former Fashion Director of Vogue Ukraine, she has a lofty 15 years of experience under her belt. Pelipas, a savant in sustainability and creative direction consultancy holds an extensive resume in advising brands.

Burc Akyol

With a resume boasting legendary fashion houses, including Christian Dior and Balenciaga—not to name drop or anything, Burc Akyol zooms into LVMH’s legendary race with a heritage of sartorial savoir-faire coursing through his veins. Exposed to the art of sewing through his father’s work as a tailor, Akyol overlaps couture and the everyday wardrobe. A graduate of L’Institut Français de la Mode, Burc Akyol strives to secure a non-disposable philosophy with his namesake brand.

DIOTIMA

Let’s talk DIOTIMA. Headed by Rachel Scott, the Jamaican brand investigates fashion as the unifying thread between intellectual, aesthetic, and corporeal planes. Founded in 2021, the fashion house reimagines Caribbean style through the lexicon of sensuality. Sustainability and ethical production practices are deeply embedded within the DIOTIMA algorithm as it prides itself on its made-to-order business model.

LUAR

You might already be familiar with LUAR from its viral ANA bag. What you probably don’t know is that LUAR is an anadrome of its founder Raul Lopez’s first name. Raul Lopez, co-founder of Hood By Air, taps into the love affair between uptown and downtown aesthetics of New York City with his needle and thread. First being taken away by fashion design at 12 years old, Lopez merges New York City and the Dominican Republic through his craft.

Magliano

Bologna-born Magliano is a fashion brand that weaves Italian subcultures and movements into its threads. Founded by Luca Magliano, the namesake brand surfaces a dark and off-beat spin on classic menswear staples. Drawing inspiration from Bologna’s underground LGBTQ+ scene, Magliano experiments with gender codes to introduce a new mode of menswear.

Paolina Russo

Where the Avant-Garde and nostalgia intertwine, you’ll find Paolina Russo. The duo that merges founder Paolina Russo’s Canadian upbringing with co-founder Lucile Guilmard’s French Folklore references arrives at threads that—to put it succinctly—embody futuristic fantasy.

Quira

Born from the visionary mind of Veronica Leonis, Quira pays tribute to the fashion designer’s seamstress grandmother. From her tenures at Celine and Jil Sander to her creative direction of womenswear for 2 Moncler 1952, Leonis views fashion as a soulful and raw reflective process. Unraveling in a narrative of heritage, Quira perhaps is the epitome of her philosophy.

SETCHU

Last, but certainly not least, SETCHU is a cumulative study of all the places traversed and design experiences held by its founder Satoshi Kuwata. With a decadent repertoire at H. Huntsman and Sons on Savile Row as well as collaborations with Givenchy, Edun, Kanye West, and Gareth Pugh, Kuwata is no stranger to sharp tailoring and intricate designs. Toying with volume, gender, culture, and craft, SETCHU playfully merges Eastern and Western cultures to arrive at Kuwata’s idiosyncratic fits.

Trace back to earlier this month when The Semi-Final of the LVMH Prize for Young Fashion Designers took place on March 2nd and 3rd. Amongst a sea of 2,400, tides of relentless aspiration and fierce vision roared and crashed. Designers presented their collections in a showroom in Paris and on the digital platform LVMHprize.com. Then, 22 designers emerged on the horizon as semi-finalists.

“The semi-final of the tenth edition of the Prize has highlighted a great maturity in the approach and work of the designers,” reflected Delphine Arnault, “Cultural diversity, celebration of traditional crafts and creative audacity define this selection. Naturally, the finalists are fully engaged in dealing with environmental issues and play with the boundaries between menswear and womenswear. Their expertise, their creativity, their uniqueness and their commitment have truly impressed me.”

With a jury composed of LVMH designers and some of fashion’s greatest trailblazers, it’s no easy feat to impress—much less save oneself from the chopping block. As the competition heats up and the playing field narrows, the LVMH Prize heads to its final round, where its jury will announce the winner of the LMVH Prize and Karl Lagerfeld award on June 7th.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999923706054688}",neutral,0.9999923706054688,0
LVMH: “Web 3.0 Ideology” Is Hurting Adoption – Paris Blockchain Week - DailyCoin,"Wed, 22 Mar 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vZGFpbHljb2luLmNvbS9sdm1oLXdlYjMtaWRlb2xvZ3ktaXMtaHVydGluZy1hZG9wdGlvbi1wYXJpcy1ibG9ja2NoYWluLXdlZWsv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LVMH suggests that decentralization ideology hinders the adoption of Web 3.0.

The panel advocates for a less-intense version of Web 3.0, described as Web 2.5.

Web 2.5 combines old user habits and new Web 3.0 technologies.

The cross-over of luxury brands into Web 3.0 is picking up as brands look for a piece of the meta-pie. There have been several pitfalls and triumphs by luxury brands that reign supreme in Web 2.0.

Louis Vuitton, Porsche 911, and Yves Saint Laurent (YSL) are some of the famous names that delve into the Web 3.0 space. However, their levels of success and mainstream adoption vary.

Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton (LVMH) representatives spoke at Paris Blockchain Week on March 21st, 2023. The panel by the luxury multinational conglomerate said that decentralization-focused “Web 3.0 ideology” is slowing down user adoption.

Sponsored

According to Nelly Mensah, VP of Digital Transformation and Emerging Solutions, LVMH advocates for “Web 2.5.”

LVMH on Web 2.5 vs. Web 3.0

The main banner over the LVMH panel read “Web 3 is about ideology.” At the core of Web 3.0 are principles that aim to create a more decentralized, secure, and user-controlled web.

Furthermore, Web 3.0 aims to break free from centralization by creating a more decentralized and distributed web architecture. This architecture places the user in control instead of a centralized governing entity.

Sponsored

Mensah has described Web 2.5 as a softer, ‘less ideological’ approach to Web 3.0. Web 2.5 is thus where the old user habits meet the new technology made available by Web 3.0.

Web 3.0 ideology is the system of beliefs tied to decentralization. In particular, Mensah explicitly mentioned the phrase “not your keys, not your coins” as an example. These beliefs make it more difficult for users to access Web 3.0 products, according to the VP.

According to Mensah, this slows down the adoption of the mainstream, posing a threat to the significance of Web 3.0 technology.

A lack of mainstream adoption would be detrimental to the ultimate goal of Web 3.0 technologies. A greater focus on Web 3.0 technology and a lesser focus on the overarching goal of decentralized systems are set to propel adoption, Mensah suggests.

Web 2.5 in Practice

LVMH owns globally-recognized luxury brands such as Louis Vuitton, Dior, and Fendi.

In 2021, LVMH announced that it was partnering with the blockchain platform ConsenSys to create a blockchain-powered platform called Aura. Aura is designed to provide customers with a secure and transparent way to track the authenticity and origin of their luxury goods, from raw materials to finished products.

Source: Aura Luxury Blockchain

By using blockchain technology, LVMH aims to address issues such as counterfeit products and supply chain transparency, which are important concerns for luxury consumers.

Through Aura, customers can access a digital certificate of authenticity that details the product’s manufacturing process, materials, and environmental impact. The platform also allows customers to resell their luxury goods in a trusted and secure way, creating a new secondary market for luxury items.

The Aura platform exemplifies how luxury entities like LVMH leverage Web 3.0 technology and Web 2.5 user habits.

Will luxury goods multinational LVMH sponsor the 2024 Paris Olympics? - Euronews,"Mon, 20 Mar 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmV1cm9uZXdzLmNvbS9jdWx0dXJlLzIwMjMvMDMvMjAvd2lsbC1sdXh1cnktZ29vZHMtbXVsdGluYXRpb25hbC1sdm1oLXNwb25zb3ItdGhlLTIwMjQtcGFyaXMtb2x5bXBpY3PSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"By Saskia O'Donoghue

Rumours are still circulating that LVMH might sponsor the 2024 Paris-based Olympic Games as it's confirmed none of their companies will be designing the French team's uniforms

The 2024 Olympic Games are only 494 days away and they have yet to find a significant luxury sponsor.

Set to kick off next year, on 26 July, the Paris-based sporting event has announced a number of supporters, including Panasonic, AIRBNB and AliBaba. However, despite the city being one of the most famous homes of fashion, very few style leaders have been confirmed as partners. Only Omega, the luxury watch brand, has been declared as the ‘official timekeeper’ of the Games.

Marking a glaring absence is the world leader in luxury goods LVMH.

Also known as LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, the French multinational conglomerate is headquartered in Paris, making it - to the layman at the very least - a perfect sponsor for the city’s Olympics spectacular.

While rumours have been swirling about a potential partnership between LVMH and the 2024 Games since Paris won the bid, nothing has been confirmed.

Home to some of the highest end brands, including Christian Dior, Tiffany & Co and Fendi, the hugely successful company is worth over €400 billion, making it the most valuable business in all of Europe.

Even though their involvement in the Olympic Games is still at the rumour stage, it’s still been somewhat marred in controversy. People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) reached out to the International Olympic Committee last year to try to get their support in an ongoing effort to stop fashion brands using fur and exotic skins in their offerings.

In a 2022 letter sent to IOC president Thomas Bach, PETA urged the committee to “only accept sponsorship from LVMH or any other fashion company if it agrees to stop selling fur and exotic skins”. The letter went on to cite the fabrics as sources of risk for future pandemics.

The 2024 Olympics are likely to be something of a resurgence of the style of past Games, given that the 2020 Tokyo Olympic and Paralympic Games were postponed to July 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics were held behind closed doors, with hardly any spectators.

Whether PETA’s calls will affect LVMH’s decision whether to partner with the Olympic Games remains up in the air, one thing is certain - no member of the conglomerate will design the uniforms for the French Olympic and Paralympic teams.

Instead, it will be Parisian designer Stéphane Ashpool, who has been named artistic director in charge of the uniforms. Alongside the Pigalle Paris founder, French athletic brand Le Coq Sportif - who are not owned by LVMH - will manufacture the performance wear for sports across the board. Ashpool was chosen by the IOC from a shortlist of five designers and Le Coq Sportif was selected from three manufacturers.

Founded in 1882, the well-established French brand has announced it’s able to produce the majority of the uniforms in France, many of them just an hour away from Paris in Romilly-sur-Seine.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9997827410697937}",neutral,0.9997827410697937,0
Top Fashion Stories of the Week: March 3 - HYPEBEAST,"Fri, 03 Mar 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vaHlwZWJlYXN0LmNvbS8yMDIzLzMvdG9wLWZhc2hpb24tbmV3cy1sdm1oLWFjcXVpcmUtY2FydGllci1yaWhhbm5hLWZlbnR5LXB1bWEtbWljaGFlbC1iLWpvcmRhbi1jYWx2aW4ta2xlaW7SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"This week, fashion’s headlines set new tones for the future.

Among the biggest, new reports revealed that LVMH is looking to acquire Cartier’s parent company Richemont. The Switzerland-based luxury goods company boasts a massive portfolio of 26 brands that Bernard Arnault has his eyes on. In another sector, Rihanna confirmed the return of the much-loved and very-missed Fenty x PUMA collaborations, after the partnership quietly disappeared in 2017. And on the runway, Paris has the spotlight, with several labels, including Saint Laurent, Acne Studios, Balmain, Rick Owens, Off-White™, and LOEWE, among others, pulling back the curtain on their Fall/Winter 2023 designs this week.

Below, Hypebeast has rounded up the top fashion stories of the week so you can stay up to date on trends in the industry.

Leading luxury conglomerate LVMH, run by the globe’s richest man Bernard Arnault, is looking to take over Switzerland-based luxury goods holding company Richemont, according to reports from Swiss newspaper Finanz und Wirtschaft, which spoke of “whispers behind closed doors.”

Arnault reportedly has his eyes set on Cartier, viewing the high-end jewelry brand as a significant addition to its growing accessories wing, which presently hosts Tiffany & Co., Bvlgari, and Chaumet. Richemont ranks as the fourth-largest luxury company in the world, with a massive portfolio of 26 brands that includes Cartier, Chloé, Montblanc, IWC, A. Lange & Söhne, Van Cleef & Arpels, Jaeger-LeCoultre, Panerai, Piaget and Vacheron Constantin.

Stay tuned for more details as they become available.

On Wednesday, Rihanna revealed the official comeback of Fenty x PUMA, with a concise message posted to social media: “She’s back.” In classic Bad Gal fashion, details on the re-established partnership are being kept largely under wraps, but news of Rih’s fashion revival will suffice for now.

Rihanna has a longstanding relationship with the German sportswear company that dates back to 2014 when she joined the brand as creative director of womenswear. During her tenure, Rihanna successfully established identifiable design codes that left critics and customers satisfied. With an emphasis on athleisure, the visionary’s collections oftentimes included an assortment of chunky footwear, oversized loungewear and vivid bodysuits, among other playful activewear iterations. It’s likely that the return of Fenty x PUMA will lean further into Rihanna’s vision of inclusivity, with styles that adhere to a contemporary aesthetic.

At this time, there is no information on the collaboration’s launch date.

Exiting Milan, fashion-week showgoers booked it to Paris to see the latest Fall/Winter 2023 collections from the French capital’s top brands. At the top of the week, a bevy of headlining designers put forth impressive efforts for the forthcoming season.

Saint Laurent debuted a Winter 2023 collection that offered a womenswear wardrobe with masculine themes, Acne Studios showed a range that was rooted in futuristic mysticism, and HELIOT EMIL set the whole place on fire. Meanwhile, Balmain‘s FW23 collection recalled its founder’s heroic brilliance, and Off-White™ uncovered Ib Kamara‘s debut collection at the brand’s helm. As the week continues, see Hypebeast’s coverage here.

Calvin Klein began the rollout of its much-anticipated Spring/Summer 2023 campaign — and among the stars appearing scantily clad in support of this season’s collection is actor, producer and director Michael B. Jordan. The campaign not only spotlights the imprint’s latest loungewear and underwear staples but also champions Jordan’s sheer star power in a bevy of confident portraits.

Shot by legendary photographers Mert & Marcus, the sartorial imagery marks Jordan’s first time working with Calvin Klein. Jordan’s Spring/Summer 2023 campaign imagery is now posted on Calvin Klein’s famous Houston St. and La Cienega billboards, as well as on the brand’s social channels. Calvin Klein’s full Spring 2023 campaign will be unveiled on March 15.

Louis Vuitton opened an all-new exhibition, titled White Canvas: LV Trainer in Residence, dedicated to the first line in a series of artistic reinventions of its LV Trainer.

On view from February 24 to March 16, the exhibition launches inside Louis Vuitton’s Milan store at Garage Traversi with three renovated editions of the emblematic sneaker. Curated by Sky Gellatly, the initial installment features iterations made by Ecuador-born, New York-bred graffiti artist Lady Pink, Puerto Rico-hailing subway artist Lee Quiñones and the Estate of Rammellzee. An invitation for creative collaboration, the exhibition expands upon Louis Vuitton’s deep-rooted relationships in the artistic spheres.

BTS’ Jimin joined Tiffany & Co. as the brand’s latest ambassador. Made official with an image of the South Korean vocalist wearing a stack of the luxury jewelry purveyor’s “Lock” bracelets, Jimin’s work with the brand is set to begin immediately — and his first campaign will arrive later this year, according to WWD.

Under the contract, Jimin will front forthcoming advertising campaigns and show face at the jeweler’s key brand events. According to the label’s announcement, “Jimin will showcase his unique approach to jewelry styling as he wears iconic Tiffany & Co. designs in forthcoming campaigns.”

“It is a great honor to partner with Tiffany and embody the values of a brand that has a passion for design, innovation and artistry,” Jimin said in a statement.

Pharrell Williams‘ worldwide auction house JOOPITER announced its first high jewelry auction, titled A Journey Through Gems. The digital-first auction includes a partnership with high-jewelry maven and third-generation diamond dealer Lorraine Schwartz, who boasts a longstanding reputation in the industry for connecting A-list celebrities with highly-coveted accessories.

A Journey Through Gems will include a range of rare stones and unique pieces from throughout Schwartz’s career. Specifically, the auction features a 50-carat D Flawless Type II heart-shaped loose diamond, a pair of 18k white gold, four-panel diamond shape earrings with natural purple sapphire, natural paraiba and diamonds, along with an 18k white gold diamond and Colombian emerald bib necklace with matching earrings.

The auction will open for global bidding on March 17.

Mitchell & Ness named Don C its new Creative Director of Premium Products, in an effort to elevate the lifestyle brand’s influence among sports, entertainment and business.

Don’s relationship with the brand dates back to 2021, when he teamed up with Mitchell & Ness on a series of luxury “Just Don” caps. Following their success, Don C continued to work on the brand’s premium apparel and headwear collections, as well as its NBA Jam and No Name collections.

“Working with Mitchell & Ness is a dream come true,” said Don in a statement. “I grew up on throwbacks and sportswear, so it’s an honor to be able to impact something that affected me so much through my creative journey and love of sports. I’m looking forward to storytelling and creating more timeless products alongside the Mitchell & Ness team.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9998778104782104}",neutral,0.9998778104782104,0
LVMH Wants to Buy Richemont: Report - Rapaport,"Wed, 01 Mar 2023 15:17:02 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiPWh0dHBzOi8vcmFwYXBvcnQuY29tL25ld3MvbHZtaC13YW50cy10by1idXktcmljaGVtb250LXJlcG9ydC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LVMH, the owner of Tiffany & Co. and Bulgari, is rumored to have its eyes on acquiring rival Richemont, according to Swiss newspaper Finanz und Wirtschaft.

There are “whispers” in the luxury industry that LVMH founder and CEO Bernard Arnault is particularly targeting Cartier, Richemont’s flagship jewelry and watch brand, the report said last week.

LVMH and Richemont’s share prices were fairly stable following the speculation, which the international media only carried several days later. Neither company had responded to a request for comment from Rapaport News by press time.

Astrid Wendlandt, a luxury-industry author and editor at online publication Miss Tweed, played down the significance of the rumor.

“Luxury investors got excited last week after…Finanz und Wirtschaft published a story suggesting LVMH was interested in buying Richemont,” Wendlandt noted in a LinkedIn post. “It turned out to be fake news. The market didn’t take it seriously, and Richemont’s shares hardly moved.”

LVMH acquired Tiffany in January 2021. Richemont’s other jewelry and watch brands include A. Lange & Söhne, Buccellati, Jaeger-LeCoultre, Piaget, and Van Cleef & Arpels.

"LVMH’s Bernard Arnault Runs His Luxe Conglomerate From a Swanky $5,300 Office Chair - Robb Report","Fri, 17 Mar 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vcm9iYnJlcG9ydC5jb20vc2hlbHRlci9ob21lLWRlc2lnbi9iZXJuYXJkLWFybmF1bHQtbHZtaC1hcm1jaGFpci0xMjM0ODE5NzI2L9IBWGh0dHBzOi8vcm9iYnJlcG9ydC5jb20vc2hlbHRlci9ob21lLWRlc2lnbi9iZXJuYXJkLWFybmF1bHQtbHZtaC1hcm1jaGFpci0xMjM0ODE5NzI2L2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"It turns out the king of luxury has a fittingly lavish throne.

LVMH’s founder, chairman, and CEO Bernard Arnault manages his portfolio of 75 prestigious brands while sitting on one of Mascheroni’s swanky leather armchairs.

The Italian furniture maker, which surprisingly isn’t owned by the French luxury conglomerate, was founded by Piero Mascheroni in 1973. Located just outside of design-centric Milan in the town of Cabiate, the workshop produces everything from sofas and chaises to tables and desks. Oh, and let’s not forget office chairs for multimillionaires. Over the past half century, Mascheroni has garnered a reputation for meticulous upholstering and beautifully tanned hides. It has also gained a loyal following of deep-pocketed design cognoscenti.

“Arnault is not the only one, but he is the most representative among our customers who are not looking for big brands but want items that others do not know about,” Silvio Mascheroni, son of the founder, told the local Italian press. “And therein lies our difference, that of having found the right balance between notoriety and exclusivity.”

LVMH’s fearless leader opted for the Congress 135. The chair features a solid wood frame that has been covered in non-deformable rubber padding to ensure it holds its shape. The silhouette is that of a classic executive chair, with a long back to support the spine and armrests for added comfort. The supple natural ox leather that runs over the exterior has been finished in a classic, cream hue. The chair also sports a plate engraved with “Mascheroni srl Made in Italy” to highlight its provenance.

As you might expect, the statement piece does not cheap. The Congress 135 starts at about $5,300 (€5,000). That’s a mere pittance for Arnault, of course. The Frenchman is currently the world’s richest person, with a net worth of $184 billion, according to Bloomberg’s Billionaire Index. His luxury titan also reached a market capitalization of $434 billion (€400 billion) for the first time in history back in January.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999946355819702}",neutral,0.9999946355819702,0
LVMH CTO Antoine Tessier Joins Bonder’s Advisory Board Exclusively to Revolutionize the Retail Industry - Tech Times,"Tue, 07 Mar 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMingFodHRwczovL3d3dy50ZWNodGltZXMuY29tL2FydGljbGVzLzI4ODYzOS8yMDIzMDMwNy9sdm1oLWN0by1hbnRvaW5lLXRlc3NpZXItam9pbnMtYm9uZGVyLXMtYWR2aXNvcnktYm9hcmQtZXhjbHVzaXZlbHktdG8tcmV2b2x1dGlvbml6ZS10aGUtcmV0YWlsLWluZHVzdHJ5Lmh0bdIBogFodHRwczovL3d3dy50ZWNodGltZXMuY29tL2FtcC9hcnRpY2xlcy8yODg2MzkvMjAyMzAzMDcvbHZtaC1jdG8tYW50b2luZS10ZXNzaWVyLWpvaW5zLWJvbmRlci1zLWFkdmlzb3J5LWJvYXJkLWV4Y2x1c2l2ZWx5LXRvLXJldm9sdXRpb25pemUtdGhlLXJldGFpbC1pbmR1c3RyeS5odG0?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"(Photo : Antoine Tessier)

The COVID-19 pandemic had a complicated effect on the retail industry, with supply chain shortages and brick-and-mortar storefronts closing, putting an enormous strain on the sector. Fortunately, technological innovators like the location-based communication platform Bonder have created ways for retailers to adapt to consumers' rapidly changing needs. This innovation is what drew LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton CTO Antoine Tessier to join the company's Advisory Board, serving as Bonder's new CTO.

With over 17 years of experience in the retail industry, Tessier has a deep passion for and understanding of the evolving retail landscape. Tessier worked at Louis Vuitton for 12 years, taking on multiple roles, including Project Leader, Senior Manager of Digital and Retail, Director of Digital and Retail, and Chief Technology Officer. He then became the Vice President and Chief Technology Officer of LVMH Americas, and brings this experience to his new role as CTO of Bonder.

A new social retail platform

Bonder is a new social and retail platform that represents the intersection between people, businesses, and communities. The Bonder Pro Retail platform aims to allow retailers to connect their space to their customers' phones, creating a more social - and profitable - retail ecosystem.

""Retail spaces are consistently trying to improve the in-store customer experience and stay better connected to their guests before, during and after a visit knowing most trail off into the social media abyss,"" said Scott Swanson, Bonder's CEO and Founder. ""Our platform empowers the store to invite their visitors into a private community we call 'Circles' which are specific to each store. The members receive a handful of cool benefits by joining these Circles, from instant employee chat and offers upon arrival, to access to private streaming sales, other helpful events, and e-gift cards - all accessible within an eco-system of people helping people. Say good-bye to '800' numbers because we just leveled up the entire support experience by enfolding you into a community of locals who shop and network with each other specific to that stores location.""

Bonder can eliminate the need for numerous retail brand apps. Consumers can use the Bonder app as a direct tool to instantly find and buy products, chat with in-store employees, apply exclusive discounts, and join private communities within local stores they frequent. Users can connect with not only every staff member in each department - individually or collectively - but also other shoppers using the platform in the immediate vicinity.

Tessier believes Bonder represents the future landscape of retail. ""The Bonder team's vision is to create a new retail landscape to keep up with the changing demands of consumers,"" says Tessier. ""Consumers are now seeking local, curated, and personalized relationships from their retail experiences. During the pandemic, there was a yearning for human interaction and community building among retail consumers, and Bonder is the revolutionary answer to this yearning.""

A more personalized and collaborative retail experience

As part of this shift towards more personalized retail experiences, many brands have already incorporated customers' needs for engagement, collaboration, and discussion of mutually important topics to humanize the brand. Unfortunately, many retailers have yet to see the potential this approach could have on their businesses.

""Retail, which struggled during the pandemic, is catching up fast, and people are at the center,"" Tessier said in a recent press release. ""Consumers have realized the importance of human interaction, and Bonder answers this need that every retailer and consumer has.""

For the Bonder team, retail will always have the advantage over e-commerce because e-commerce lacks the necessary personal touch. Bonder partners with retailers to create deeper, ongoing connections between stores and customers that e-commerce platforms could only dream of. In other words, Bonder has found an audience that wants to connect and has given them a way to do so.

Technology like Bonder has the potential to drive further sales and increase customer engagement by nurturing loyal customer bases and encouraging them to stay connected with a particular store's community. Tools like access to updates, special events, and exclusive services and offers might seem simple, but can help make customers more engaged with retailers.

However, it is important to note that sales aren't the first and foremost priority when it comes to the use of a platform such as Bonder, but a happy side effect. ""The local relationships built by Bonder are less about the sale and more done in the interest of genuine interactions and businesses and consumers talking to and learning from each other,"" says Tessier. ""This investment in genuine interactions builds trust and will translate to repeat customers and additional organic sales.""

Under the guidance of Antoine Tessier as Bonder's CTO and a member of their Advisory Board, Bonder can revolutionize the retail industry. Consumers are demanding shopping experiences that are more connected and attuned to their social needs, and an innovative platform like Bonder is exactly what retailers need to fulfill that need.

"Pucci Goes Back Home, Dior Lands in Michigan, LVMH's Board Pick - WWD","Thu, 16 Mar 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3dkLmNvbS9mYXNoaW9uLW5ld3MvZmFzaGlvbi1zY29vcHMvcHVjY2ktZ29lcy1ob21lLWRpb3ItbGFuZHMtaW4tbWljaGlnYW4tbHZtaHMtYm9hcmQtcGljay0xMjM1NTg0Nzg5L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"HOMETOWN GLORY: Emilio Pucci’s next collection will be unveiled at a fashion show in the house’s hometown of Florence on May 4, WWD has learned.

It will mark the first runway showcase for Pucci artistic director Camille Miceli, who has preferred multiday lifestyle “experiences” since she arrived at the creative helm in September 2021.

The venue for the evening display and other details are still under wraps. The summer collection that will be unveiled, dubbed “Initials E.P.,” is expected to pay tribute to the founder by “freshly exploring the roots of the maison.”

An image from the Pucci archives shows models on the barrel-clay-tile rooftop of Palazzo Pucci wearing the spring-summer 1967 collection of flowing evening dresses, terrycloth capes and wide-legged jumpsuits.

Controlled by luxury giant LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton since 2000, Pucci is now a resort-focused brand that unveils collections on a see-now, buy-now basis, although each unveiling includes several drops.

Miceli unveiled her debut collection in April 2022 over a two-day event that included a yoga class and dining on the beach in Capri, the island where founder Emilio Pucci opened his initial boutique in 1951.

She followed up with a three-day event last December at the glamorous Swiss mountain resort of St. Moritz, where she unveiled a Pucci x Fusalp skiwear collection.

Founder Emilio Pucci, who died in 1992, was a member of the Italian Olympic ski team in 1932. He began designing skiwear out of jersey fabrics in 1947 and opened his house in Florence in 1949.

Considered one of Italy’s fashion pioneers in outfitting the jet set, Pucci quickly became synonymous with dazzling, colorful prints and glamorous lifestyles. — MILES SOCHA

The womenswear area furniture was supplied by various galleries and designers. Featured pieces include a Bruno Moinard sofa, Eros console by Angelo Mangiarotti and a side table Fetiche by Negropontes Gallery Paris. The menswear area’s furniture was selected from special designers. Featured pieces include Gio Ponti armchairs, a Neri & Hu side table and a Steiner armchair. Dior commissioned unique works of art for the store, including artwork by Louis Frydman. — DAVID MOIN

BOARD PICK: LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton plans to add a seasoned finance executive to its board.

At its next annual general meeting, due to be held on April 20, the French luxury conglomerate will propose the appointment of Laurent Mignon, group chief executive officer of investment firm Wendel, whose core shareholder is the Wendel family.

In addition, Mignon is vice chairman of the board of global certification firm Bureau Veritas and sits on the board of specialty materials manufacturer Arkema and AROP, the association of the Friends of the Paris Opera.

He is also a non-voting member of Franco-German financial services group Oddo BHF.

Prior to taking up his post at Wendel in December 2022, Mignon spent more than 12 years at Groupe BPCE, where he was CEO of corporate and investment bank Natixis and chairman of the executive board of Groupe BPCE from May 2018 to December 2022, among other positions.

After graduating from French business school HEC in 1986 and completing the Stanford Executive Program, Mignon worked for more than 10 years for Banque lndosuez, first in capital markets and then in corporate and investment banking. He has also held positions at Schroders Bank in London; insurance and financial services firm AGF, and Oddo & Cie.

CHOOSING TILDA: South Korean skin care brand Sulwhasoo has tapped Tilda Swinton as its latest global brand ambassador.

According to the brand, through this position Swinton will be promoting Sulwhasoo’s global mission of “building a world of beauty powered by art and heritage.”

The Academy Award-winning actress joins Blackpink member Rosé, who was appointed as a global brand ambassador in 2022. This news comes on the heels of the brand’s recent announcement of a one-year partnership with The Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City, through which the two will create programming to celebrate global heritage.

To kick-start her new role, Swinton, who has been a longtime fan of Sulwhasoo, appears in the brand’s second “brand universe” style video shot at the House of Sulwhasoo Bukchon in Seoul, South Korea. Rosé featured in the first “brand universe” style video last September. These videos aim to bring consumers into the Sulwhasoo world to experience the origin of the brand and its products.

In a quote featured on the brand’s Instagram, Swinton said, “I think spirit and heritage are really beyond valuable. There’s really a reason to focus on things that don’t change because they never will.”

In the new video titled “I Am Ginseng,” Swinton discusses her love for ginseng, an ingredient that has been at the core of the brand since its origin. The ingredient is featured in several of the brand’s current bestsellers, including the Concentrated Ginseng Renewing Cream, $260, and the Concentrated Ginseng Renewing Serum, $210.

This appointment follows Sulwhasoo’s recent rebranding initiative, unveiled last August through a campaign tagged #SulwhasooRebloom. Through this, the brand committed its efforts to showcasing how Sulwhasoo’s heritage led to it “blooming” into a modern, luxury global brand.

With rebranding and recent partnership news, Sulwhasoo plans to scale its presence globally, further expanding its footprint and presence outside of Korea. — EMILY BURNS

VIRTUAL TRY-ON: Maria Tash has launched virtual try-on software that lets shoppers plot out their piercing schemes before they even step foot in her store.

The jeweler’s Tash Studio software has been in development for more than five years and is more than just a sticker-type application.

“It’s fully rendered jewelry that uses AI to employ real piercing principles — it knows where rings and studs actually go on the ear and has principles of gravity built in. It knows the inner diameter of earrings and how much gravity sits on a ring. You can rotate studs 360 degrees,” Tash said of the program, which also knows where to not allow certain piercings on the ear.

Tash’s brand has been building out its collection of earring charms recently — allowing customers to add a little more zing to their look. In the Tash Studio program, charm use is encouraged: “You can take a charm and drag it onto a ring, and it knows which charm goes with which ring and it hangs appropriately,” she said.

Tash sees the software, which is now available for use on her brand’s site, as a multipronged opportunity. It enables a wider sense of comfort among consumers, helping them make decisions about body jewelry before they even enter her store. The program is already proven to boost online sales for those who already have piercings and want to plot out a new earring scheme.

“Initial data shows that our consumers spend more time and money [on our site]. Confidence is up and returns are down because of sizing,” Tash said.

The designer added that, “I have a vision for Maria Tash. This will not only live online in e-commerce, but it’s something we can deploy in-store when shoppers queue up. We do think it will create a bump in revenue for obvious reasons.”

That’s not the end of Tash’s ambition with the software. She plans to license it to other piercing and jewelry brands in the future.

“Right now we are in observation mode but we have high hopes for the software. We would like to work with other brands and think we can expand this in the future with partners,” Tash said. — MISTY WHITE SIDELL

CHILD’S PLAY: Ramy Brook, the women’s contemporary firm, is getting into the children’s business.

The first collection will launch on Thursday at ramybrook.com and at Ramy Brook’s Madison Avenue boutique.

A mommy-and-me look from Ramy Brook.

The collection includes dresses, cover-ups and swimwear for girls ages 18 month to 12 years old. Many of the looks are matching versions of the women’s line and can be worn for mommy-and-me occasions.

The collection retails from $98 to $168.

A look from Ramy Brook’s children’s colleciton.

Ramy Brook has always appealed to a multigenerational customer, and designing for both moms and their daughters has always been one of founder and chief creative officer Ramy Sharp’s goals.

“I’ve always designed clothing that both mothers and daughters could enjoy wearing, and since the start, we’ve done mother-daughter shoots for Ramy Brook. Creating a collection for little kids has been a longtime dream of mine that I’m now so excited to bring to life. Sharing clothes and inspiration with my daughter Stevie is something so special for me. With this new extension of Ramy Brook, I hope it sparks the same kind of joy for other mothers and daughters,” said Sharp. — L.L.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.999998927116394}",neutral,0.999998927116394,0
LVMH's Ultra-Premium Tequila Volcan X.A Is Finally Available to Purchase - Yahoo Finance,"Thu, 30 Mar 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9sdm1oLXVsdHJhLXByZW1pdW0tdGVxdWlsYS12b2xjYW4tMjMwMDAwODczLmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"If you purchase an independently reviewed product or service through a link on our website, Robb Report may receive an affiliate commission.

LVMH launched Volcan X.A last summer as a luxury tequila that you could only find in select upscale restaurants and clubs around the world—just 250 locations to be precise. But now you can find this sipping tequila in 13 new markets in the U.S., as well as online, so get your bottle sparklers ready and pop this bottle in the comfort of your own home.

More from Robb Report

Volcan X.A is the newest expression from Volcan de mi Tierra, a tequila brand owned by Moet Hennessy that was relaunched as a revamped product back in 2017. Volcan is already positioned as a high-end option in the crowded tequila world, but X.A seems to have been intended specifically to compete with others that fall within a certain price range like Don Julio 1942, Clase Azul, and the new Patron El Alto. There’s also the fact that tequila is set to outpace domestic sales of American whiskey in the very near future, as the category continues its upwards trajectory in popularity.

Like Patron El Alto in particular, X.A is a blend of aged tequilas that includes reposado, anejo, and extra anejo (so technically it’s a reposado tequila, given that is the youngest style included in the blend). No additives were used in the production of X.A, according to the brand, and it was aged in proprietary barrels called Grace Casks. These are lightly toasted virgin American oak barrels that are made from trees from different plots to give the spirit a unique flavor profile, a practice that had been used in the wine industry that the team at Volcan thought would suit tequila equally well. The agave used to produce Volcan comes from highlands and lowlands fields, and is grown in volcanic soil that surrounds the volcano that gives the brand its name.

Story continues

Last summer, there were a few parties to celebrate the launch of Volcan X.A as an on-premise tequila, including events in Las Vegas and Ibiza. If you didn’t get the invite to one of those exclusive events, you’re in luck because now the release is expanding to 13 U.S. markets, including California, Florida, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Texas, and Washington, D.C. You can also find it for sale (SRP $175) at websites like ReserveBar if you’d rather have it delivered straight to your door (sparklers not included, of course).

LVMH eager for luxury merger with Richemont - Retail Detail Europe,"Fri, 03 Mar 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldGFpbGRldGFpbC5ldS9uZXdzL2Zhc2hpb24vbHZtaC1lYWdlci1mb3ItbHV4dXJ5LW1lcmdlci13aXRoLXJpY2hlbW9udC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Is the largest luxury group in the world soon becoming even larger? French LVMH is said to be considering a takeover of the world’s number four, Swiss Richemont, which owns luxury brands such as Cartier, Piaget and Yoox.

Numbers one and four

The Swiss luxury group, specialised in high-end watches, has Cartier as the jewel in its crown- and it is no secret that Cartier has long been a firm favourite of LVMH’s CEO Bernard Arnault. Now rumours are circulating that his group LVMH is ready for a takeover. The resulting merger company would be huge: as two of the four biggest luxury companies in the world, LVMH and Richemond have a market capitalisation of 390 billion and 74 billion euros, respectively.

By acquiring the world’s fourth largest luxury company, LVMH would strengthen its position in the jewellery and watch markets. The Franco-Swiss combination would see LVMH’s TAG Heuer, Hublot and Zenith stand shoulder to shoulder with historic brands such as Vacheron Constantin, Panerai, Jaeger-LeCoultre and IWC. In turn, Cartier and Van Cleef & Arpels would come under the same flag as Bulgari and Tiffany & Co.

For now, though, these are just unconfirmed “whispers behind closed doors“, Swiss financial medium Finanz und Wirtschaft reports. Richemont has been managed by Johann Rupert, the son of founder Anton Rupert, since 2006. He did make it clear earlier that he does not (yet) want to give up control of the company.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999722242355347}",neutral,0.9999722242355347,0

The love story between luxury brands and Web3 continues.

At this year’s Paris Blockchain Week, LVMH presented the latest developments around its Aura Blockchain Consortium.

First launched in 2021, the consortium, which includes Prada Group, OTB Group, and Cartier, focuses on promoting more sustainable trends in the fashion world and helping members upgrade their products’ traceability via blockchain technology.

“When you talk about luxury, you are talking about long-term products, repair, and care,” Frank Le Moal, vice-chairman of Aura Blockchain Consortium and LVMH’s CIO, told Decrypt. “Digital passports backed by a blockchain are a way to provide better repair and care services to customers, and to develop a better one-to-one relationship with them.”

OTB Group, which holds famous brands like Diesel, Maison Margiela, Marni, Viktor&Rolf, and Jil Sander, was one of the first entities to join the Consortium.

The CEO of the group’s web3 subsidiary BVX, Stefano Rosso, is convinced that blockchain technology is going to “change the way we interact, consume, socialize, and communicate,” he told Decrypt.

“For us, it was fundamental to jump on the boat now. It was the right moment to experiment and join other fellows in this space,” Rosso said. “The sky is the limit.”

The Consortium’s real challenge was at some point to convince other luxury brands, most of them competitors, to join the project.

“The luxury industry is very competitive, people are fighting most of the time,” said Le Moal. “But we managed to develop a collaborative concept, involving many brands. We want to offer this as a solution to the world of luxury.”

Luxury brands build in public

More than a collection of luxury brands, Aura is also a private blockchain built on ConsenSys’ Quorum.

And this week, LVMH also rolled out a new feature for its network called the “Multi-Token minter” (MTM).

Source: Aura Blockchain Consortium.

The MTM lets consortium members build out smart contracts that can be deployed on Aura’s blockchain, but also on any public blockchain, including Ethereum, Solana, or Cosmos.

“We want to allow every luxury brand to enjoy the possibilities of Web3. We are already more than pleased to have 24 brands on board, 21 of them using NFTs,” Frank Le Moel. “But with MTM, we feel a strong excitement. Because we know that some brands prefer to go on a public blockchain.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9991733431816101}",neutral,0.9991733431816101,0

The appointments follow LVMH's recent revenue growth of 23% to £69.5 billion (€79.1 billion) for 2022, with a ""record performance"" from Sephora boosting overall sales.

The company's Selective Retailing division saw revenue increase 26% to £13 billion (€14.8 billion), driven by a ""remarkable rebound"" from Sephora. This follows the relaunch of Sephora in the UK in October 2022.

Sephora is due to open its first UK location tomorrow, 8 March.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9065432548522949}",positive,0.9065432548522949,1

Five to six strategic investors recently submitted their letters of intent to purchase 59.2 percent of shares in Able C&C, currently owned by IMM Private Equity, according to industry sources on Friday.

IMM became the largest shareholder of Able C&C, best known for its Missha brand, by acquiring stakes worth 40 billion won ($31 million) back in 2017. Now the company is seeking an exit after six years. The deal, including the operational rights, is estimated to be about 100 billion won.

LVMH P&C, a cosmetics and perfume subsidiary of French luxury giant LVMH Group, is reportedly one of the participants in the preliminary bidding. LVMH P&C manages a global portfolio of makeup brands, including Make Up Forever, Givenchy and Sephora, the retail chain.

Other global beauty companies such as L’Oreal and the Estee Lauder Companies also reportedly joined the bid. Back in 2018, L’Oreal acquired Korean makeup and fashion company Nanda for about 600 billion won, pinning high hopes on its makeup brand 3CE.

“Many of the bidders are foreign entities. Aside from that, we cannot disclose any details of the bidders,” a public relations official for IMM told The Korea Herald.

IMM plans to release the shortlist of bidders in the coming weeks, with the final bidding set to be held in May.

Sources say investors are paying keen attention to Able C&C’s growth potential, especially its upbeat growth in overseas markets in recent years when its bigger rivals suffered from pandemic disruptions. The company posted 74 percent and 15.5 percent sales growth in the US and Japan, the two biggest markets, in 2020-2022.

Largely buoyed by the sales growth abroad, the company swung to the black last year, reporting 20 billion won in earnings, before interest taxes and depreciation.

The robust growth also boosted its stocks, with prices soaring some 24 percent over the last six months.

In an interview with The Korea Herald earlier this month, Able C&C CEO Kim Eugene shared her views about Korea’s “fast beauty” industry.

""South Korea has a unique cosmetics ecosystem, as opposed to France and the United States -- the original powerhouses of the global cosmetics industry,"" she said.

""Korea has long produced its cosmetics products with OEM (original equipment manufacturing) and ODM (original design manufacturing) processes, which allowed for fast production of diverse range of makeup products.”

She also showed confidence in the company’s growth potential.

""The overseas market is a completely open market. With our endless growth potential in the overseas market, and there still being markets that have not been actively targeted, like Southeast Asia, we will aim for aggressive expansion, based on our greatly improved profitability,"" she added.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9991648197174072}",neutral,0.9991648197174072,0

This news comes just days after the French company announced changes in its Perfumes and Cosmetics Division, with Véronique Courtois taking the helm of Parfums Christian Dior.

Farnier succeeds Bruno Angibeau, who has served as Parfums Christian Dior’s Managing Director since 2011. In his new role, Philippe will be responsible for both local markets and travel retail of Parfums Christian Dior. He will report directly to Courtois.

This move is somewhat of a homecoming for Farnier, who was the General Manager of Perfums Christian Dior from 2008 to 2013, before a 7 year stint at Rémy Cointreau.

Philippe Farnier takes on the new role after leading LVMH’s Travel Retail for the Beauty division for the past year. During this time, he created an integrated organisation to leverage the group’s strength, whilst elevating the expression of each brand and controlling distribution.

He will keep his responsibilities as CEO of Travel Retail LVMH Beauty, working closely with Stéphane Rinderknech, the recently appointed chairman and CEO of LVMH’s Beauty Division.

Véronique Courtois commented: ""I am delighted to see Philippe take charge of the commercial activities for Parfums Christian Dior.

LVMH Group, the world's largest luxury group, which operates the global beauty store Sephora, has joined a preliminary takeover bid to acquire a controlling stake of Able C&C, the operator of cosmetics brand Missha, according to media reports and sources.



While the global luxury conglomerate's participation is not officially confirmed as of yet, investment banking (IB) sources say that Asian strategic investors (SI) from Japan, Korea and China joined the bidding war to acquire the Korean cosmetics company.



According to sources, more than five overseas strategic investors, mostly Asian distribution and biopharma corporations from China and Japan, along with local fashion businesses, participated in the preliminary bid earlier this week to acquire a 59.2 percent stake as well as the management rights of Able C&C. It is expected that the sale price will be set at around 100 to 150 billion won ($76 to 114 million).



Given that the main bid is slated to be held sometime in May, the short list of potential buyers for the deal could still change. Market watchers are paying attention to whether IMM Private Equity (PE) will be able to make an exit from its investment into the cosmetics company this time.



It has been six years since IMM PE acquired the controlling stake of the company for about 400 billion won in 2017. Following the private equity firm's takeover, the cosmetics company suffered a series of blows to its earnings, due to the COVID-19 pandemic as well as changing fads in the purchasing of cosmetics.



The annual revenue of 434.6 billion won posted in 2016 went down to 262.9 billion won in 2021. During the same period, its operating profits of 24.4 billion won turned into an operating loss of 22.4 billion won in 2021. Amid the plunge in earnings and the subsequent free fall of Able C&C's stock price, IMM PE faced an event of default (EOD) last year as it failed to extend some of the financing. It forced the private equity firm to sell the cosmetics company despite the financial losses it incurred.



Despite IMM PE's pain, Able C&C had a successful turnover. It posted an operational profit of 10.1 billion won last year. With the country's mandatory mask-wearing obligation lifted as of Monday, the company's earnings are expected to grow further.



Operating over 30,000 stores in 46 countries, Able C&C has long been recognized as a powerhouse of major K-beauty brands, including Missha, A'pieu, Stila, Chogongjin, Lapothicell, Cellapy and more.

By Kim Jae-heun



LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton Chairman Bernard Arnault is a global fashion magnate who owns dozens of world-class luxury brands such as Louis Vuitton, Dior, Tiffany & Co. and Dom Perignon.



The chairman made regular visits to Korea between 2016 and 2019 until the pandemic. These visits have always drawn attention among local fashion firms' chiefs. A good opportunity arose for them to invite Arnault to their department stores and discuss business on the spot.



In 2010, Hotel Shilla CEO Lee Boo-jin went to Incheon International Airport herself to greet Arnault and successfully convinced him to open a Louis Vuitton boutique at her duty free shop ― beating out rival Lotte Duty Free.



This time, Lotte stood in the front of the line to meet Arnault. On Monday, he visited Lotte Avenuel Mall in southern Seoul's Jamsil.



Lotte Group Chairman Shin Dong-bin, accompanied by Lotte Shopping CEO Kim Sang-hyun and Lotte Department Store CEO Jung Jun-ho, welcomed the French chairman and took him on a tour around the luxury department store and duty free shop in the mall.



""It is unknown what Shin discussed with Arnault, but Shin probably came out because of his duty free business. He wanted to appeal to Arnault while he is in Korea,"" a local retail firm official said.



Lotte needs to expand luxury boutiques at its department stores as Lotte Duty Free, the country's No.1 duty free shop, has failed to enter Incheon International Airport recently.



Shin is also predicted to have come out himself and greeted Arnault to build the relationship, which could help his retail affiliate's partnership with LVMH in the luxury business sector.



""It is already meaningful only by inviting the chairman of the world's largest luxury firm to Lotte Avenuel Mall. Shin probably wanted to take this chance as a stepping stone in increasing the number of French luxury brand boutiques at his department stores on the outskirts of Seoul,"" the official added.



Lotte Department Store declined to comment.



Lotte is the country's largest retailer but its department stores operate fewer luxury brand stores compared to its competitors. LVMH is well-known for not allowing its luxury brand to open a store if the destination does not satisfy certain conditions such as sales volume, public profile and location.

Arnault held a series of separate meetings with top executives of three local department stores — Shinsegae Department Store, Hyundai Department Store and Hanwha Group’s Galleria Department Store — as well as Lotte Group Chairman Shin Dong-bin.

He has discussed potential partnerships with the executives, as he visited key department stores, officials said, without elaborating.

Arnault, who is accompanied by his daughter, Delphine Arnault, chairman and CEO of Christian Dior, also met with Hotel Shilla Co. CEO Lee Boo-jin and her mother, Hong Ra-hee.

The visit — the first in more than three years — came as the world’s largest luxury house is pushing to increase its presence in South Korea, which has become one of the most important markets for luxury brands.

LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE owns such brands as Louis Vuitton, Christian Dior, Givenchy, Fendi and Bulgari, as well as TAG Heuer and Tiffany & Co.

South Koreans were the world’s biggest spender of personal luxury goods per capita in 2022, according to Morgan Stanley, with the nation’s per capita spending amounting to US$325.

This far exceeds the $55 and $280 per capita spending by Chinese and Americans, respectively.

The trip also reflects the group’s deepening love for South Korean consumers. Louis Vuitton Korea’s sales swelled 40.2 per cent on-year to over $1.1 billion in 2021.

The group has collaborated with various K-pop celebrities, including BlackPink’s Jisoo and BTS’ J-HOPE, who were named global ambassadors of its house brands.

Considering his label’s boldly organic start—with its pilot offering having launched on the gaming interface Discord—his inclinations have served him well. The Gurugram-based brand has found a shelf at vetted retailing spaces like Ssense, with a number of eyeballs on Instagram for the work he puts out, with no PR gimmicks to cajole the audience.

“I don’t really know anyone from the industry and I don’t know what the science behind getting press is, so to not do anything is probably not a good practice. But while we have this organic momentum, it’s going well,” he says. The brand’s celebrity clientele, such as rapper Kendrick Lamar—also an outcome of this organic growth—is a natural manifestation of each step that Kumra has taken so far. “The amount of money I spent on sending out products to people which were never worn...” shares Kumra, shaking his head.

Text Hannah Bertolino

“This is who we are,” Steve Hsieh – one-third of the brother-founded Taiwanese fashion label Namesake (以父之名) – says, propping up a bright red, 3D-printed basketball shoe in front of his Zoom camera. Modelled on adidas’ Kobe 2 trainers and embedded with rows of crisscrossed netting along the sole, the shoe pays homage to the Hsieh family’s fishing business – juxtaposing their father’s traditions with the aesthetic flavour of Steve, Michael, and Richard’s own generation. “Fishing plus basketball plus futuristic, technical stuff really represents Namesake,” Steve adds. Namesake, which translates to “In the Name of the Father” in Mandarin, is the second time all three brothers have collaborated on a business venture. In 2013, after years spent between Taiwan, Japan, and the US – where they studied sensible, academic degrees encouraged by their parents – they opened up NE. SENSE, a Taipei-based concept store stocking high fashion and streetwear brands running the gamut of Rick Owens to Diesel, Wales Bonner, and GmbH. Seven years later, the brothers launched Namesake as a tribute to their father, who was the first to introduce them to the artful side of fashion.

The brothers approach Namesake as a way to honour the disparate cultures they grew up in, even if they often felt like outsiders. “We always feel like we’re not ‘in’ yet,” Michael says. But with its genderless tailoring, futuristic accessories, and sustainably-sourced fabrics, the label’s high-end take on basketball culture has garnered a cult following from NBA basketball players and streetwear fanatics alike. Now, just weeks after debuting their latest collection, the brothers have been shortlisted for fashion’s prestigious LVMH Prize. Below, we catch up with Steve and Michael Hsieh on their reaction to the nomination, the inspiration behind their AW23 collection, and balancing family traditions with their own voices.

Congratulations on the LVMH Prize nomination! How did it feel finding out that you’d made the shortlist? Steve Hsieh: It feels unreal. We’ve been in the industry for almost ten years since starting out as a buyer. Our dream was always to have our own voice, create our own brand, and tell our own story, but we thought that by starting our own shop it’d be easier to gather a community behind us. We just want to let people know that there are a lot of different routes to get here. You don’t have to go to design school to be able to be recognised. I think we showed a different route for people, and that’s the most important thing for us, to inspire the next round of people. To be recognised by LVMH is just an extra boost for us to work harder. When did you decide you wanted to work in fashion? Were you all on similar paths? Steve Hsieh: We all went to different schools for university. I went to a school in California for civil engineering, Michael went to school for psychology, and Richard went to school for biology. When we were growing up, our parents wanted Richard to become a doctor, me to become an engineer, and Michael to become a lawyer. Before I applied to college, I knew I wanted to do design, but my parents weren’t really supportive because I had pretty good school grades, so they thought it was a waste of talent. When I went to California on my own, I found out that design was what I wanted to do, so I got an internship and started working in a warehouse and slowly worked my way up to becoming a designer for the brand. It was around that time that we all gathered together and decided to do our own thing – and to not go down the paths our parents wanted us to.

“We just want to let people know that there’s a lot of different routes to get here. You don’t have to go to design school to be able to be recognised” - Steve Hsieh

Namesake draws a lot of inspiration from your father and the way he introduced you to art and creativity. Are there any specific moments from your childhood that stand out today? Steve Hsieh: Originally, my dad wanted to be a designer, but in an Asian family you usually have to take over the family business, so he couldn’t. Growing up, I feel like he used us as a way of showing his desire to design. He’d dress us in the stuff he wanted to wear – always suits or Ralph Lauren. He’s so interested in fashion and now he houses a tonne of magazines and things. I think we were subconsciously in this design environment and that influenced us a lot. Michael Hsieh: We all went to Japan for high school and when we went there, our dad showed us a lot of Japanese magazines, so we’d sit around, flipping through them. We three brothers were more interested in Japanese brands and Harajuku style but our dad introduced us to high fashion. I remember he brought us to Dover Street Market in Ginza. You grew up between Taiwan, Tokyo, Los Angeles, and Seattle. How do those places come through in your designs? Steve Hsieh: Our mindset is that we want to keep Chinese traditions, Japanese elegance, and American freedom; those are the three things we want to represent our brand. When we went to Tokyo, we realised the social structure was very rigid but, at the same time, there’s a lot of elegance and craftsmanship which influences what we’re doing right now. When we went to America, the sudden release of freedom was what we wanted to express to ourselves as well. For us, there’s always a juxtaposition – we want to be free, but our family background is so traditional. It’s a combination of the two.



Your collections also explore the juxtaposition between past generations and your own. Why does it feel important to your work? Steve Hsieh: We always feel like we’re the outsiders in any community that we go into because when we moved to Tokyo it was hard for us to get used to the environment. When we were in America, it was a totally different background. When we moved to Taipei, it felt very familiar, but still very distant. That’s the juxtaposition: we always try to bring together two contrasts but find the common ground between them. I think that’s the engineering part of me – I always like to give myself questions that I can answer through the collection. Having two contrasting things and finding similarities is like finding the answer to these questions. Michael Hsieh: That outsider mentality is something that we always keep in mind, because it's something that’s kept us grounded and humble and honest. Even though we’re in the fashion world, we’ve always felt like there’s a lot of creativity to improve on. I really enjoy being an outsider because sometimes it means you can really see what’s going on on the inside. Can you please tell us a bit about the inspiration behind your AW23 SILK ROAD show? Steve Hsieh: Each collection starts from a family story which we then translate into sports. We make it into a bigger story so that it resonates with more people. For AW23, the story is about myself. When I was growing up, I was sent to a fake Buddhist camp where all the kids were physically abused by the monks – it was pretty big news at the time and they’re all in jail right now. But the moral of the story is that even though it was a really tough experience for me, I feel like I wasn’t that traumatised by it. The motto of AW23 is talking about tenacity. I feel like I learned it from this experience. I always compare life to horse riding. You feel like you’re going in the direction that you want to go towards, but you can’t control it. Life is like the horse, and the horse is in control, so you can only enjoy the ride. This is why horses are a really symbolic reference this season, plus my Chinese name has a horse letter in it and our parents’ favourite brands have the horse symbol in them – they like Ralph Lauren and Hermès, which both became a big inspiration behind the style of the collection.

“The most important thing about basketball is the ethos of life lessons and teamwork. We feel like that can resonate bigger than basketball” - Steve Hsieh

Is there a piece from this collection that you feel represents Namesake as a brand? Michael Hsieh: Each one of us has a different opinion on this! That’s something interesting about Namesake because normally families all dress in different ways, but you can still look at them and see that they’re family. I think that’s what Namesake represents. I like a more formal style, which resonates with my dad. We made this big suit crew neck – it looks like a crewneck, but we constructed everything in really fine tailoring and then included a rip on it. It’s like a Ralph Lauren cardigan, but we turned it into a crew neck to represent casualwear with a sports, basketball vibe. You can put your suit on without thinking and go out. Craftsmanship has always remained an integral part of your work – taking basketball fashion into a luxury space. Why is that important to you? Steve Hsieh: We grew up in a fishing harbour, and our parents wouldn’t let us play any games. They just gave us a basketball and said ’Go to the harbour and play’. So we grew up with basketball while looking at the harbour and agriculture. From there, basketball became the common language between us brothers. We loved it so much, but before we started Namesake we felt like there was no basketball brand that really resonated with people who love both fashion and basketball. There’s definitely a community for that and that’s why we wanted to start Namesake. To us, the most important thing about basketball is not the act of playing it, but the ethos of life lessons and teamwork. We want to translate that to everyone, and we feel like that goes beyond basketball, too.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999841451644897}",neutral,0.9999841451644897,0

As for shoes, the 27-year-old Brit chose a pair of timeless yet modern strappy sandals that seamlessly complemented her outfit. The high-heeled stiletto style featured two slender toe straps and another diagonal strap across the vamp.

Meanwhile, she kept her accessories minimal and wore her hair slicked back in a neat bun for the glamorous gathering in the City of Light.

The French luxury brand will relocate its store from 1 East 57th Street across the street to 36,000 square feet at the Trump Organization’s 6 East 57th Street while 1 East 57th undergoes renovations, the New York Post reported. LVMH — Louis Vuitton’s parent company — signed a five-year deal for the space with an asking rent of around $20 million a year, the Post reported.

The Trump Organization, LVMH and LVMH’s broker Robin Zendell did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Louis Vuitton will take over the storefront from LVMH subsidiary Tiffany & Co., which was on a sublease with Nike for the 6 East 57th space while Tiffany added new elevators, a glass penthouse and an outdoor terrace to its nearby 727 Fifth Avenue store.

Ex-president Donald Trump and Alexandre Arnault, son of LVMH owner Bernard Arnault, handled the deal themselves, the Post reported. Trump previously posted on his social media site Truth Social that the two had met at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach in February.

“It was great having Alex Arnault of LVMH, and his wonderful wife, Géraldine, for dinner at Mar-a-Lago,” Trump wrote on Truth Social on Feb. 15. “We were celebrating the deal we made on the former Nike Store on East 57th Street and Fifth Avenue. Alex is very excited about the reopening of Tiffany.”

But that’s not the only big deal on the horizon for LVMH. The fashion giant is reportedly in talks to consolidate its U.S. headquarters at 1 East 57th Street and 19 East 57th Street and relocate to the Olayan Group’s 550 Madison Avenue, though the deal has not yet closed, the Post reported.

As it currently stands, Cartier is one of the few remaining global watch and jewellery brands that stand as serious competition against the $626 billion market cap group, making it a prime mark for Bernard Arnault to consider.

While talk of the acquisition is little more than a murmur at this point, the Swiss newspaper Finanz und Wirtschaft reported there were “whispers behind closed doors” about the possible deal, the enthusiasm for which has likely been bolstered by Richemont’s “all-time high” performance of which Cartier is a significant part. Alongside Cartier, the Richmont stable includes the likes of Buccellati, Van Cleef & Arpels, Chloé, IWC Schaffhausen, Montblanc, Purdey, Vacheron Constantin and many more.

While the watches and jewellery portion of LVMH’s portfolio is currently led by TAG Heuer, Bulgari, Hublot, Chaumet and De Beers, its fashion and wine and spirits brands are relatively unrivalled in their scope, with Louis Vuitton, Dior, Céline, Lowebe and Givenchy leading the charge in fashion, while Moët & Chandon, Dom Perignon, Hennesy, Belvedere, and Ardberg are among the wine and spirits. We’ll need to wait and see if these whispers become concrete statements, but LVMH is always on the hunt for quality businesses and the acquisition of Cartier would be a very significant feather in Arnault’s cap.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.999599039554596}",neutral,0.999599039554596,0

For now, there is no further information about the deal.

The brand A.P.C. was born in 1987 and is now recognised worldwide for its minimal silhouettes, subtle style and production of jeans in selvage denim, a raw fabric that for designer and founder Touitou «can last for three generations.» The simplicity of its imagery and the longevity of the garments are the main reasons why the brand has managed to maintain a niche and loyal customer base for more than 30 years. With around 80 shops worldwide, 80% of sales come from abroad, and 30% from online platforms. Founded in 1989, L. Catterton owns a long list of medium-sized brands, all characterised by strong growth potential and the need for the support of a major partner.

But it will surely buy back its shares from the market. The group’s leader, Bernard Arnault, is betting that the price of LVMH’s shares will increase. The luxury giant at the center of “Swiss” rumors saying that it wishes to buy Cartier or even the entire group that owns it: Richemont. Analysts remain skeptic however, and explain why. What we do know is that the French conglomerate will, by July 20th, enact a buyback worth at least a billion.

Not going to happen

According to Swiss news source Finanz und Wirtschaft, LVMH is allegedly looking to buy Cartier away from Richemont. But Johann Rupert, the leader of the multinational, is opposing it, just like when he opposed Kering’s interest. The market also believes it unlikely that the sale will be actualized. LVMH doesn’t lack jewelry brands after having purchased Tiffany. Thus, there are no apparent reasons leading operators to believe that Richemont is interested in selling its top brand.

Years of rumors

“For years rumors over a potential merger between Kering and Richemont were heard. Now it’s LVMH’s turn to enter the mix. It’s a rumor that is cyclically brought forward, but I don’t expect it concretize in the short term”, summarizes Carole Madjo of Barclays to Milano Finanza. Luca Solca, of Bernstein, pointed out issues with anti-trust authorities: “The greatest challenge to the acquisition is the obtainment of approval from antitrust authorities in markets where this operation would be evaluated on the terms of market share per specific price segment. In China, for example”.

A buyback worth a billion

For the moment, all we know is that Bernard Arnault (on the left in the photo from Imagoeconomica), patron of LVMH, believes the value of its group’s shares to grow in the future. That’s why LVMH states it plans on starting a buyback process for a value of 1.5 billion euro. The process will end on July 20th. “Re-acquired shares will eventually be nulled”, said the group on an official statement.
