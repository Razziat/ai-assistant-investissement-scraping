"Meet Alexandre Arnault, the dashing son of LVMH billionaire Bernard Arnault - Style","Wed, 13 Jul 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjbXAuY29tL21hZ2F6aW5lcy9zdHlsZS9jZWxlYnJpdHkvYXJ0aWNsZS8zMTg1MDE4L21lZXQtYWxleGFuZHJlLWFybmF1bHQtaHVua3ktc29uLWx2bWgtYmlsbGlvbmFpcmUtYmVybmFyZNIBeGh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLnNjbXAuY29tL21hZ2F6aW5lcy9zdHlsZS9jZWxlYnJpdHkvYXJ0aWNsZS8zMTg1MDE4L21lZXQtYWxleGFuZHJlLWFybmF1bHQtaHVua3ktc29uLWx2bWgtYmlsbGlvbmFpcmUtYmVybmFyZA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Among his equally competent offspring is Alexandre Arnault – his third child and his first with his second wife, concert pianist Hélène Mercier-Arnault. Alexandre has already made a mark as a young chief executive of the high-end luggage brand Rimowa. Since 2021, he’s taken up a new challenge at the iconic jewellery brand Tiffany & Co.

So, who exactly is the 30-year-old son of LVMH’s chairman, and does he have what it takes to inherit the keys to his father’s kingdom?

He’s shaking things up at Tiffany & Co.

After being named Rimowa’s CEO when he was only 25, Arnault rose to the challenge of transforming a 120-year-old luggage brand by pairing up with global designers and introducing limited-edition suitcases and accessories that attracted the celebrity and millennial jet-set crowd.

Now, as the EVP of production and communication of Tiffany and Co., Arnault is giving the American jeweller a makeover by scoring big names such as Beyoncé and Jay-Z , Blackpink’s Rosé and Chinese freestyle skier Eileen Gu , and launching exciting products such as the Patek Philippe Tiffany Blue Nautilus.

As someone who hails from the most influential family in the fashion industry, it is only apt that Arnault got hitched to Géraldine Guyot, the founder of French accessories label D’Estree and a Central Saint Martins alum.

The stylish couple first held an intimate ceremony in Paris, in June 2021, followed by a two-day wedding in Venice in October of the same year. Beyoncé, Jay-Z, Pharrell Williams and Roger Federer were all in attendance , per Vogue.

Kanye West also came and performed at the fashion royals’ grand union.

While his dad, Bernard, previously expressed concern about entering the NFT world, Alexandre couldn’t be more thrilled to be a part of the community . To signify his membership, the youthful scion proudly changed his Twitter and Instagram profile pictures to a beanie-wearing pixelated face in 3D glasses. Per Vogue Business, the NFT was titled Punk 3167 and purchased for around US$416,400 (Eth 160).

In 2022, Alexandre even turned his NFT profile picture into a gem-studded pendant designed by Tiffany & Co.

Europe’s wealthiest person is turning Agache, his family holding company, into a joint-stock partnership. The change will guarantee that Agache’s “control over the LVMH group will be maintained over the long term,” according to a statement Thursday.

The conversion will not affect the current shareholding of Agache, the statement added.

Control of Agache will be exercised by Agache Commandite SAS, whose share capital will be held equally between the five children of Bernard Arnault. But he will be the managing general partner of Agache.

Earlier this year, shareholders approved a plan to lift the limit of the retirement age of the LVMH chief executive from 75 to 80. Arnault, the current chief, is 73.

Arnault’s wealth is estimated at $134.8 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. LVMH is the owner of luxury brands such as Louis Vuitton and Christian Dior.

The Arnault family has a 48 percent stake in LVMH, according to a regulatory filing.

LVMH Is Launching an Ultra-Premium Tequila - Robb Report,"Fri, 01 Jul 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vcm9iYnJlcG9ydC5jb20vZm9vZC1kcmluay9zcGlyaXRzL2x2bWgtdWx0cmEtcHJlbWl1bS10ZXF1aWxhLXZvbGNhbi14YS0xMjM0Njk1ODgyL9IBXmh0dHBzOi8vcm9iYnJlcG9ydC5jb20vZm9vZC1kcmluay9zcGlyaXRzL2x2bWgtdWx0cmEtcHJlbWl1bS10ZXF1aWxhLXZvbGNhbi14YS0xMjM0Njk1ODgyL2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"As we reported recently, the tequila category continues to explode in the US, and virtually every major spirits corporation now has a horse in the race.

Wine and spirits conglomerate Moët Hennessy (owner of brands including Dom Perignon, Hennessy and Glenmorangie) launched Volcán de Mi Tierra in 2017. While the brand name had existed for about two decades before that, it was reimagined as a luxury tequila label with blanco, cristalino and reposado expressions eventually making their way to market. And now the latest bottle from Volcán is set for release this summer, and this one is meant to compete with other high-priced, ultra-premium tequilas like Clase Azul and Don Julio 1942.

Volcán X.A (X.A stands for “Extra Ages”) took over 50 different trials to develop, according to the brand, and is produced using three levels of aging for a period of 36 months. What this apparently means is that the tequila is a blend of different ages, and in that regard it “broke the rules,” according to president and CEO of Volcán, Julien Morel. It seems that is why the “X.A” designation is used instead of an indicator like reposado, anejo or extra anejo.

These bottles won’t be available at retail (at least not yet), instead rolling out exclusively at clubs and restaurants in places like Las Vegas, New York, Los Angeles, Tulum, and Ibiza. “What we created will be scarce by definition,” said Morel in a statement. “Tequila is an appellation which is protected. And the savoir faire, its 300 years of history… We thought that adding to this tradition, we could really leverage the 250 years of expertise on the Moët Hennessy side of blending and aging. And we believe that we could bring something to the world of tequila, and that was our goal for the last five years.”

Volcán X.A was first introduced to the public at a party this past June at Ushuaïa Ibiza Beach Hotel, and will premiere in the US in Las Vegas on July 16 at Zouk Nightclub. According to Morel, one of his main goals in the future will be to keep up with soaring demand. “​​Today, my biggest concern, but also most of my work and biggest job of my team,” he said, “is to accelerate the development of the distillery so we can produce more tequila for the future.”

LVMH Focused on Managing Luxury Goods Demand - PYMNTS.com,"Wed, 27 Jul 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnB5bW50cy5jb20vbmV3cy9yZXRhaWwvMjAyMi9sdm1oLWZvY3VzZWQtb24tbWFuYWdpbmctZGVtYW5kLWZvci1sdXh1cnktZ29vZHMtaW5zdGVhZC1vZi1iZWluZy1lY29ub21pc3RzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"In a year where most consumers have experienced growing financial stress and had to alter their spending habits in the face of rampant inflation, the well-heeled customers of the world’s largest consortium of luxury brands, LVMH, are on a totally different track.

“All business groups achieved double-digit organic revenue growth over the period,” the $300 billion Paris-based company said of its results for the first half of 2022, which it succinctly characterized as “excellent.”

Specifically, beneath the 28% headline increase in total sales collectively reported by Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, the company’s Fashion & Leather Goods business, which accounts for half its revenue, saw sales rise 31% so far this year, followed by 20, 22 and 23 percent respective topline growth at its Perfume & Cosmetics, Watches & Jewelry, and Wine & Spirits divisions.

Further delineating the experiential chasm that currently exists between LVMH’s luxury consumers and pretty much the rest of the world was the liberal usage of now-scarce superlatives such as “exceptional momentum” or “remarkable performance” and “rapid growth,” despite a business climate it called disrupted.

Luxury vs Recession

One question that emanates from this starkly contrarian corporate and sector-specific performance is not so much why luxury’s resilience is happening, but rather, whether or not the world’s wealthiest consumers will scale back their consumption and high-cost habits as concerns about inflation and recession mount in a world filled with geopolitical tensions in the East and West.

“We are not particularly gloomy and pessimistic about the outlook,” LVMH CFO Jean-Jacques Guiony told investors Tuesday (July 26) on the company’s earnings call, acknowledging widespread talk about a coming recession but not playing into it.

“We are not economists, we are managing a business and [that] means taking advantage of the strength in the demand,” he added, after delivering a $10 billion profit from continuing operations that was up 34% through the end of June.

If — and when — demand for what LVMH calls “high quality products” should weaken, Guiony said the company would “react swiftly, cut costs and delay store openings” exactly as it has in other down times, but noted this does not appear to be one of those periods just yet.

“So again, we are not making any economic forecasts. That’s not our job. We are trying to manage the business for the growth that it can generate,” Guiony said, pointing to a luxury uptrend that has lasted for close to a decade. “I would say we are planning the business for growth. If things happen to be not as good as we anticipated, we’ll react,” he said.

European Vacations

To be sure, the ongoing state of health restrictions in China as well as continued delays in the supply chain continue to present challenges for LVMH as they are for all multinational brands and retailers.

That said, the French owner of dozens of different premium brands has been able to somewhat compensate for its setbacks in Asia with a surge in summer tourism that’s been led by a legion of American travelers that are armed and looking to spend their suddenly strong U.S. dollars on everything from designer bags and watches to champagne.

“Champagne volume rose 16% in the [first half]. The strong demand can largely be attributed to the reopening of restaurants and renewed influx of tourists in the U.S. and Europe, as well as price increases which have also contributed to revenue gains,” LVMH Investor Relations lead Chris Hollis said on the call.

In addition, Hollis called out the omnichannel innovation and logistical advancements at the company Sephora brand, as well as the 250 store-in-store locations that it has opened with Kohl’s so far this year as drivers of success behind its retail operations.

Taken together, it may come as no surprise that LVMH is not planning any major changes at a time when things look to be running smoothly, with the Group maintaining its focus on “continuously strengthening the desirability of its brands” through exceptional product quality and excellence of their distribution ahead of a year that will mark the company’s 100th anniversary in 2023.

"Meet Jean Arnault, youngest heir to Bernard Arnault’s LVMH empire - Style","Thu, 21 Jul 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjbXAuY29tL21hZ2F6aW5lcy9zdHlsZS9jZWxlYnJpdHkvYXJ0aWNsZS8zMTg1OTMzL21lZXQtamVhbi1hcm5hdWx0LWJlcm5hcmQtYXJuYXVsdHMteW91bmdlc3QtbHZtaC1oZWlyLW1pdNIBeGh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLnNjbXAuY29tL21hZ2F6aW5lcy9zdHlsZS9jZWxlYnJpdHkvYXJ0aWNsZS8zMTg1OTMzL21lZXQtamVhbi1hcm5hdWx0LWJlcm5hcmQtYXJuYXVsdHMteW91bmdlc3QtbHZtaC1oZWlyLW1pdA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"This budding French heir may only have got his foot in the LVMH door recently, but he’s already proving a force to be reckoned with. Here are five things to know about him.

Jean Arnault is far from the average 23-year-old. For starters, he is the fifth and youngest child of Europe’s richest man, Bernard Arnault. Jean also doesn’t have a regular job since his family owns the world’s largest luxury conglomerate, LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton. He might even run the empire himself someday.

He oversees Louis Vuitton watches

The youngest Arnault joined Louis Vuitton as the marketing and product development director for watches in 2021. Per Fashion Network, he splits his time between LV’s headquarters in Paris, and the label’s watch production site in Switzerland.

Jean’s older brother Frédéric, CEO of Swiss luxury watchmaker Tag Heuer, apparently awakened his interest in watchmaking.

“I was a student in London when Frédéric started working at Tag Heuer ,” Arnault told the Financial Times. “We have a close relationship and he started talking to me about the new watches and all the different things he was working on. I was fascinated. And that’s really the turning point. Once you start getting interested in it, it’s a bit of a rabbit hole.”

He has two master’s degrees

At just 23, Jean Arnault already has a BA and two master’s degrees under his belt. Photo: @arnaultjean/Instagram

Of course he does! Jean Arnault graduated with a baccalaureate degree in science with the highest honours at Saint Louis de Gonzague-Franklin in Paris in 2016. Later, he obtained a master’s degree in mechanical engineering from Imperial College London and another in financial mathematics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

Before coming on board at Louis Vuitton, Arnault also did stints as a financial analyst at Morgan Stanley and as an engineering intern at McLaren Racing, according to his LinkedIn profile.

He’s very active in sports

Even off duty, you can expect this Arnault heir to be as active as he is studious. Based on his Instagram posts, he’s quite the sporty sibling. He enjoys playing golf, going on ski trips and motor racing!

The 23-year-old likes to hike with his older brothers, Alexandre and Frédéric. These three young men are Bernard’s children with his second wife, concert pianist Hélène Mercier-Arnault.

He loves to travel and snuggle animals

Dogs, elephants, deer – you name it, Arnault has a photo of himself cuddling with these adorable animals on his Instagram. The charming scion clearly has a soft spot for furry friends.

Arnault, who can undoubtedly afford to travel anywhere in the world, often shares snaps of himself in foreign countries, too. He has an eye for great architecture and breathtaking scenic views. His travel buddy nowadays is often fellow jet-setter, girlfriend Zita d’Hauteville.

A French “it” girl and model has already captured the heart of this young luxury executive. Zita d’Hauteville, however, is not just anyone. Per W Magazine, she is the daughter of Belgian arts consultant Isabelle de Séjournet and Oxygen watches owner Eric d’Hauteville, also known as the Count and Countess d’Hauteville.

How LVMH Dominates the Luxury Business | BoF - The Business of Fashion,"Wed, 27 Jul 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzb2ZmYXNoaW9uLmNvbS9vcGluaW9ucy9sdXh1cnkvaG93LWx2bWgtZG9taW5hdGVzLXRoZS1sdXh1cnktYnVzaW5lc3Mv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LVMH kicked off a “super week” of luxury results with a strong second-quarter performance. Group sales grew by 19 percent to €18.73 billion, beating consensus expectations of €17.13 billion, despite soaring inflation and fresh Covid-19 lockdowns in the critical China market. EBIT also surpassed expectations by 8 percent, and the strong performance sets a high bar for luxury rivals set to report later this week.

LVMH is the world’s biggest and most diversified luxury goods conglomerate with leading positions in multiple businesses, including fashion and leather goods, jewellery and beauty distribution. Sheer scale, diversification and the exceptional resilience of its leather goods megabrand Louis Vuitton allow the group to consistently generate strong revenue and profit growth, giving the group a less cyclical profile, adding to its overall strength and valuation multiple.

Luxury conglomerates are only as strong as the megabrand at their core. Kering has Gucci, Richemont has Cartier. LVMH has Louis Vuitton, the king of the luxury jungle.

Vuitton has top consumer appeal rankings across geographies. It also has complete control over its distribution (100 percent retail), total price discipline (100 percent full-price), significant headroom for category diversification and a multi-pronged product innovation engine.

But above all, it has scale, setting in motion a virtuous cycle that is critical to profit generation.

Vuitton is the biggest luxury brand in the world with approximately €18 billion in 2021 sales, about 40 percent more than pre-pandemic levels. It’s also one of the most profitable players in the luxury sector, with an EBIT margin of over 45 percent.

The Megabrand Virtuous Cycle

Much of the growth in the luxury industry is driven by new wealth creation in China and other fast-growing markets, where new middle-class consumers are naturally attracted to megabrands like Vuitton and Dior, as these are the brands they know. This gives such megabrands stronger growth tailwinds and further expands their scale advantage.

In a largely fixed-cost industry like luxury, greater scale means higher margins or discretionary cost power. More discretionary cost power, for example in marketing spend, means the strongest brands get stronger, securing even more consumer awareness.

Scale provides megabrands with other advantages in branding and marketing, too. As megabrands are bigger, they can be first movers into new markets and therefore imprint themselves on new sets of customers. Scale also brings the opportunity to dwarf competitors on absolute marketing spend, while at the same time committing a smaller slice of sales to this spend.

What’s more, scale gives megabrands an edge in securing and retaining talent: a key advantage in an industry that’s getting faster and more complex every day. LVMH has notably been able to repeatedly attract top creative talent away from peers. This drives innovation — in products, in store design, in marketing strategies — which drives more traffic to stores.

More traffic to stores provides better retail economics, which largely hinge on productivity per square metre. Furthermore, shopping mall landlords are happy to offer better rental terms, higher capital contributions and better locations to megabrand traffic magnets.

Higher retail productivity, in turn, gives a brand the ability to achieve higher downstream retail integration, which allows higher price discipline and go-to-market grip. This helps to reduce brand trivialisation risk, and allows higher pricing stretch. Greater retail integration (both in stores and online) also provides better customer data, which offers advantages in customer relationship management.

Year after year, Vuitton has tapped this virtuous cycle to successfully defuse brand equity risks, while continuing to generate strong revenue and profit growth. A decade ago, Vuitton saw the risk of overwhelming the market with its popular canvas handbags and has since pushed its bag prices higher, curbing growth of handbag volumes, while offering entry-level consumers lower-priced products in small leather goods and newly introduced fragrances, with eyewear and beauty products no doubt to come.

Now, LVMH stablemate Dior is on its way to becoming a second fashion and leather goods powerhouse for the group. Our estimates suggest that, under chief executive Pietro Beccari and designer Maria Grazia Chiuri, the brand has grown revenues to almost €10 billion in 2021, while materially widening its profit margin.

A Future Jewellery Pillar

Meanwhile, LVMH’s Tiffany revamp is on the right track. After acquiring the jeweller in 2021, the group hit the ground running with a new heavyweight management team, who quickly deployed an effective “shock and awe” marketing strategy, reemphasised high-end products and pushed the brand online.

The branded jewellery category is structurally appealing, with plenty of blank space for expansion. Here, the risk of brand trivialisation is eminently manageable as jewellery is more discreet than handbags or shoes, and consumers attach higher intrinsic value to jewellery items, probably because of their connection to precious metals and gems and longer product lifespans. Jewellery has high average ticket value, doesn’t require large stores to be displayed and offers high gross margin. Plus, jewellery appeals to a broad consumer audience and has benefitted from market tailwinds through the pandemic.

LVMH’s Tiffany acquisition came on the back of the group’s successful integration of Bulgari. Between 2010 and 2019, Bulgari doubled sales while multiplying profit by five, according to LVMH chief Bernard Arnault. If Tiffany, starting from a much bigger base, follows the Bulgari blueprint, it could become one of LVMH’s top three brands, turning jewellery into another major pillar for the world’s largest luxury group.

LVMH Q2 Sales Up 27 Percent as Weak Euro Fuels Sales - WWD,"Tue, 26 Jul 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3dkLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy1uZXdzL2ZpbmFuY2lhbC9sdm1oLXNlY29uZC1xdWFydGVyLXNhbGVzLXVwLTI3LXBlcmNlbnQtaGVscGVkLWJ5LXdlYWstZXVyby0xMjM1MjYyMzI1L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS — Wait and see.

That was the watchword from LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton as the world’s largest luxury group, coming off a strong second quarter, assessed the threats of recession, surging inflation, supply chain disruptions, Chinese lockdowns and the war in Ukraine.

Jean-Jacques Guiony, chief financial officer at LVMH, used the expression repeatedly as he answered analysts’ questions after the company reported a 27 percent increase in revenues in the three months to June 30.

Asked about prospects in China, where business was down “heavy double digits” in the second quarter, he said it was too early to predict the timing of a turnaround. “We’ve seen some form of improvement toward the end of the quarter, but nothing very significant and nothing worth really reporting. We are very much in a wait-and-see attitude,” Guiony said.

Questioned about Russia, where LVMH earlier this month shuttered its Sephora beauty business, he described a similar waiting game. “We keep our businesses in a frozen state,” Guiony said, “in a wait-and-see attitude.”

The weakness of the euro against the dollar? You guessed it. “What currencies create, currencies can undo fairly quickly, so we tend to look at it very much in a wait-and-see attitude,” Guiony opined.

That’s not to suggest that LVMH is entering the third quarter under a cloud. On the contrary, the owner of brands including Louis Vuitton, Dior, Tiffany & Co. and Sephora is feeling positively bullish, though shouting it from the rooftops might come across as unseemly in the current climate.

“The first half of 2022 has seen an excellent performance despite the difficult environment, and clearly reflects the strengths of LVMH’s strategy of having a diverse and balanced portfolio of brands sold all around the world,” Guiony remarked.

Reporting first-half results after the market close, LVMH posted a net profit of 6.53 billion euros in the first six months of 2022, up 23 percent versus the same period in 2021.

Profit from recurring operations totaled 10.24 billion euros, representing an increase of 34 percent year-over-year, with fashion and leather goods, or FLG, accounting for 7.51 billion euros, up 33 percent.

Total revenues in the three months to June 30 totaled 18.73 billion euros, exceeding a FactSet consensus estimate of 17.42 billion euros.

And while uncertainties lie ahead, the group has a strong hand. Guiony noted that it benefits from good demand momentum; the aforementioned geographic balance and diversification, and financial strength that allows it to invest significantly in marketing and selling its brands.

“All this does not mean that we are immune to any external shocks, but it just means that we have the ability to face more adverse conditions and to emerge from them stronger than ever,” he reasoned.

LVMH remains optimistic about the U.S. market, regardless of a surge in inflation, tanking stock and cryptocurrency markets, and the rising risk of a recession. Its U.S. revenues were up 22 percent in the second quarter, despite a tough comparison with the same period last year.

“We see no tangible signs of slowing down,” Guiony said. Market share is growing, with the U.S. accounting for 27 percent of LVMH’s total revenues in the first half of 2022, up from 25 percent in the same period last year.

“We are not particularly gloomy and pessimistic as to the outlook. Obviously we hear what a lot of people are saying about the coming recession,” he added. “We are planning the business for growth. If things happen to be not as good as we anticipated, we will react and we will cut costs, openings, etc., as we always do. The key of this is to react swiftly.”

Likewise, the group is positive that China will recover fairly swiftly from its current woes, despite the continued weakness of store traffic. The country’s poor performance dragged down revenues in Asia in the second quarter, which fell 8 percent after a rise of 8 percent in the prior three months.

“It’s painful, but it shouldn’t last, or it will last as long as restrictions are being enforced and when it is over, we are fully confident that the strength of demand will kick back and will enable us to recover shortly,” Guiony said.

Even the prospect of a global downturn did not appear to spook the executive.

“If we end up with a sort of worldwide recession, with everybody staying at home and not shopping in luxury, as it happened in 2008, we’ll be affected. We were affected in 2008, but we’ve seen from previous recessions that they don’t last long, and we have a very strong rebound capacity,” he said.

To be sure, LVMH has plenty of reasons to be confident.

In the short term, the euro’s slide to parity against the U.S. dollar has boosted top-line revenues for companies that sell many of their goods abroad. In addition, U.S. tourists have taken advantage of the cheap euro to splurge on luxury goods in Paris this summer.

Stripping out the impact of currency fluctuations, overall revenues at LVMH were up 19 percent year-over-year in the second quarter, indicating a slowdown from the first quarter, when organic revenues increased 23 percent. Revenues in Europe were up 48 percent, versus 45 percent in the prior quarter.

“Being more or less at parity with the dollar is obviously having some positive impact on our business, and it will be the case as long as it lasts,” said Guiony, adding that LVMH had not noticed a spike in gray market activity as a result of the price differential between the U.S. and the euro zone.

“It creates a bit of activity with U.S. clients in Europe, which is something that we haven’t seen in a very long period of time. All in all, for the time being, it’s not a big issue and it doesn’t call for urgent action,” he said.

The key FLG division posted sales of 9.01 billion euros in the second quarter, up by 19 percent on a like-for-like basis versus the same period last year, reflecting not only the dominance of star brands Louis Vuitton and Dior, but also the progression of houses such as Fendi, Celine, Loewe, Loro Piana and Marc Jacobs.

Although the segment’s improvement was down from the 30 percent organic revenue growth recorded in the first three months of the year, it was above the market consensus forecast for a 17 percent increase.

The division’s operating margin grew to 41.4 percent in the first half, versus 40.8 percent in the same period last year, according to Chris Hollis, head of financial communications at LVMH.

Guiony believes that margins of more than 40 percent are here to stay, even without the kind of price increases seen in the first half, thanks to the growing profitability of Dior and smaller labels.

He noted that most brands have increased price tags by 3 percent to 7 percent this year to preempt inflation. “I don’t think we’ll be very active on pricing [in the second half] because we did most of the action in [the first half], but we’ll see,” he said. “We haven’t seen any pushback from customers.”

Bernard Arnault, chairman and chief executive officer at LVMH, also sounded a positive note. “LVMH has enjoyed an excellent start to the year, to which all of our business groups contributed,” he said in a statement.

Organic sales of wines and spirits were up 30 percent in the second quarter, while watches and jewelry posted a 13 percent increase. Perfumes and cosmetics were up 8 percent, and selective retailing rose 20 percent.

“We approach the second half of the year with confidence, but given the current geopolitical and health situation, we will remain vigilant and count on the agility and talent of our teams to further strengthen our global leadership position in luxury goods in 2022,” Arnault added.

By comparison, Compagnie Financière Richemont said sales at constant exchange rates rose 12 percent in the April-to-June period, while Burberry reported that the Chinese lockdowns dented its growth in the fiscal first quarter. At constant exchange rates, retail revenue was flat in the 13 weeks to July 2.

However, Brunello Cucinelli said sales jumped 46.4 percent in the second quarter, helped by a favorable comparison basis, and strong demand in Europe, North America and the Middle East. French group Kering is scheduled to publish its first-half results on Wednesday, followed by Hermès International on Friday.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9998045563697815}",positive,0.9998045563697815,1
"Meet Frédéric Arnault, Tag Heuer’s tech savvy CEO and Bernard Arnault’s son - Style","Sat, 23 Jul 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjbXAuY29tL21hZ2F6aW5lcy9zdHlsZS9jZWxlYnJpdHkvYXJ0aWNsZS8zMTg2MjQyL21lZXQtZnJlZGVyaWMtYXJuYXVsdC10YWctaGV1ZXItY2VvLXZ5aW5nLXJ1bi1sdm1o0gFxaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAuc2NtcC5jb20vbWFnYXppbmVzL3N0eWxlL2NlbGVicml0eS9hcnRpY2xlLzMxODYyNDIvbWVldC1mcmVkZXJpYy1hcm5hdWx0LXRhZy1oZXVlci1jZW8tdnlpbmctcnVuLWx2bWg?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The Arnaults are the world’s first family when it comes to luxury goods. Headed by Bernard Arnault – aka Europe’s wealthiest man – the family have created an impressive empire out of the merger that is LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton.

As time passes, whispers about who will replace Bernard have grown louder, made worse by the fact that the family refuse to address the topic in public. One of those in the running, Bernard’s third son Frédéric, has been making a name for himself thanks to his ongoing success as chief executive at Tag Heuer.

So who is this 27-year-old business whizz, and what more is there to know about him?

He studied computer science and interned at Facebook

Frédéric graduated from École Polytechnique, one of France’s most prestigious universities, with a degree in applied mathematics and computer science. Per his LinkedIn profile, he also interned at Facebook and with McKinsey & Company before joining Tag Heuer. He speaks English and French fluently and is also able to converse in Italian and German.

He first joined the company in a temporary role as head of connected technologies in 2017. Back then, Stéphane Bianchi, former head of Tag Heuer, was tasked with preparing the younger Arnault to become CEO. According to The New York Times, Bianchi acknowledged that it was not the easiest transition. “We clashed everywhere in the beginning, but now we laugh about it,” he revealed. “You can have a big brain and not be a leader. He has both.”

Since then, Frédéric has made several changes within the luxury watch line and steered the company to new heights. Most notably, he recently scored Hollywood actor Ryan Gosling as Tag Heuer’s ambassador – the Golden Globe winner’s first-ever deal with a brand.

He is a huge fan of NFTs

Like his older brother Alexandre , the up-and-coming business magnate knows that cryptocurrencies and NFTs are part of the future of transactions. “We believe it’s a new technology, a new asset class that has been created and Tag Heuer has a voice there,” Frédéric said onstage at the Watches & Wonders fair, Vogue Business reported.

As a testament to this, Tag Heuer now accepts several cryptocurrency payments through Bitpay, which includes bitcoin and Dogecoin.

He also recently shared the Tag Heuer Connected Calibre E4 on his social media, which allows owners to view their NFT portfolios on their luxury timepieces. The head of Tag Heuer is known to share a cryptocurrency wallet with Alexandre.

He plays tennis, chess and piano

The young executive likes to make good use of his time outside work and spend it with his loved ones. He plays the piano like his concert pianist mum, Hélène Mercier-Arnault.

The dating life of someone as high-profile as Frédéric will always be the subject of online speculation.

Given his responsibilities, it’s perhaps not surprising he hasn’t found time to go on dates, but it’s likely not long before we hear more about a special someone. Is it beyond the realms of possibility he could catch the eye of Blackpink’s Jisoo ? We think not …","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9971066117286682}",neutral,0.9971066117286682,0
Bernard Arnault reorganizes the Agache holding company and secures control of LVMH - Luxus Plus,"Fri, 22 Jul 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vbHV4dXMtcGx1cy5jb20vZW4vYmVybmFyZC1hcm5hdWx0LXJlb3JnYW5pemVzLXRoZS1hZ2FjaGUtaG9sZGluZy1jb21wYW55LWFuZC1zZWN1cmVzLWNvbnRyb2wtb2YtbHZtaC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Bernard Arnault is reorganizing his holding company Agache SE in order to turn it into a family group, controlled by the Arnault family.

Agache SE is the holding company controlled by Bernard Arnault, which owns LVMH. The press release issued on Thursday, July 21, states that the group was transforming the company into a limited partnership: “The LVMH group is a family-owned group whose mission is to support the long-term development of each of its brands while respecting their uniqueness and strength. In this respect, the transformation of Agache into a limited partnership announced today, which does not change its current shareholding, ensures the long-term continuity of its control over the LVMH group,” said Bernard Arnault, quoted in the Agache press release.

This choice is not a coincidence, as the limited partnership is recognized for its characteristics facilitating the transmission within a family business. It allows to dissociate management and ownership of the capital and also constitutes a dissuasive weapon against hostile takeover bids. It can be found in some large groups such as the tire manufacturer Michelin, the luxury brand Hermès, or Sofibol, the holding company of the Bolloré group.

Family transmission and control

The control of the company Agache will be exercised by its general partner Agache Commandité SAS, a company whose capital will be held equally by the five heirs of Bernard Arnault, explains the press release. With this operation, Bernard Arnault does not designate his successor and does not intend to hand over in the near future.

Namely, the five children of the businessman are already working in the LVMH group: Delphine Arnault is deputy CEO of Louis Vuitton and Antoine Arnault is both head of image and communication of LVMH and CEO of Berluti. Alexandre is Executive Vice President of Tiffany, Frédéric is CEO of Tag Heuer and Jean is Director of Marketing and Watch Development for Louis Vuitton.

The share capital of Agache will continue to be fully owned by the Arnault family group, now as a limited partner with Bernard Arnault as the first and only general manager of Agache, Agache Commandité SAS, which will be appointed general manager thereafter. The Supervisory Board will be composed of representatives of the limited partners. This new structure will ensure the long-term survival of family control and the uniqueness of the voice of the controlling shareholder within the Christian Dior and LVMH groups.

LVMH Reports $37.15 Billion in Revenue for H1 of 2022 - The Fashion Law,"Tue, 26 Jul 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWZhc2hpb25sYXcuY29tL2x2bWgtc2Vlcy0zNy0xNS1iaWxsaW9uLWluLXJldmVudWUtZm9yLWgxLW9mLTIwMjItZGVzcGl0ZS1jaGluZXNlLXNsb3dkb3duL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton reported revenue of 36.7 billion euros ($37.15 billion) in the first half of the year, up 28 percent compared to the first six months of 2021, with the French luxury goods group touting “double-digit organic revenue growth” for all of its business groups during the first half and strong growth coming from Europe, Japan and the U.S. In addition to “exceptional momentum” in champagne and cognac and “rapid growth” in fragrances and skincare, LVMH revealed that Fashion & Leather Goods had a “remarkable performance,” as consumers continue to double-down on luxury goods purchases in the wake of the pandemic.

Focusing specifically on its biggest division, LVMH revealed that Fashion & Leather Goods generated revenue of 18.1 billion euros ($18.32 billion) during the first half of the year, up 24 percent (on an organic basis) for H1, and up by 19 percent (to 9.1 billion euros) for the second quarter, which ended on June 30. In addition to revenue growth, Fashion & Leather Goods reached new “record highs” for profitability, per LVMH, with profit from recurring operations growing by 33 percent to 7.51 billion euros for H1, and its operating margin as a percentage of revenue growing by 0.6 points to 41.4 percent. (A nod to the success of enduring price hikes from Louis Vuitton, Dior, and co., which increased prices from 3 to 7 percent in H1, with “no push back from customers,” per LVMH management.)

In a note following the LVMH earnings call, Bernstein analyst Luca Solca stated that the 40 percent-plus margins for Fashion & Leather Goods” are the new normal particularly due to the performance of Dior,” which contributes “significantly” both in terms of revenues and margins, and on top of that, “Loewe, Fendi and Celine are also improving margins significantly – most brands within the divisions are reaching a profitability level which is satisfactory and commensurate to their size, which was not the case in the past.”

Reflecting on the “strong progress” of Fashion & Leather Goods group, LVMH primarily name-checked Louis Vuitton, Christian Dior, Fendi, Celine, Loro Piana and Loewe – leaving out the likes of Givenchy. In an apparent effort to keep up with demand for Louis Vuitton, LVMH revealed the inauguration of two new workshops for its most robust brand in France, including one for precious leathers. As for its other Fashion & Leather Goods leader, Dior, LVMH pointed to “outstanding growth in all product categories,” including “continued success of [its] Lady Dior bag.”

Meanwhile, LVMH mentioned the “success of iconic bags Peekaboo and Baguette” for Fendi; the planned opening of two new workshops in Italy in H2; and the Fendace capsule collaboration with Versace, which “generated major media coverage and commercial success, with its best-selling products selling out in the space of a few days.” It also cited “strong progress of ready-to-wear” for Celine, as well as the success of new high-end leather offerings; and in terms of Marc Jacobs, the brand boasted “fresh momentum” during H1, per LVMH, with “an impressive surge in online sales and new stores that opened in the U.S. and Europe.”

Elsewhere under its umbrella, the group revealed that the Perfumes & Cosmetics division – which recorded organic revenue growth of 13 percent for H1, reaching 3.6 billion euros – saw “excellent momentum in Perfumes” and a rebound in makeup.” LVMH also cited the impact of health restrictions in China on the division, in particular, along with its “intensification of selectivity in distribution” and its practice of “limiting promotions.”

The Watches & Jewelry division – which posted revenues of 4.9 billion euros for H1, an organic increase of 16 percent – was led by the success of Tiffany & Co., which “enjoyed an excellent half-year, still driven by strong momentum in the U.S.,” as well as sales at Bulgari and watch-maker Tag Heuer. And still yet, LVMH noted a “strong rebound from Sephora” and a “recovery in hotel activities,” with luggage-maker Rimowa similarly benefitting from an uptick in travel, “stepp[ing] up its performance considerably as borders reopened around the world.” Similarly, Wine & Spirits – which saw revenues grow to 3.3 billion euros for H1 (up 14 percent on an organic basis) – felt a lift from travel resuming, as strong demand in the U.S. and Europe was “led by restaurants reopening and tourism recovery.”

Regionally speaking, LVMH saw revenue grow by 24 percent in the U.S. market for the first half of the year. Sales grew by 47 percent in Europe, 33 percent in Japan, and 1 percent in Asia (excluding Japan). As for the revenue by region breakdown, the group generated 32 percent of total H1 revenue in the Asian market (vs. 38 percent in H1 2021), followed by 27 percent of sales in the U.S. (vs. 25 percent in H1 2021), 15 percent from Europe – excluding France (vs. 14 percent in Q1 2021), 7 percent in France (vs. 5 percent in H1 2021), 7 percent in Japan (the same result as H1 2021), and 12 percent from “Other Markets” (vs. 11 percent in H1 2021).

As for the “painful” impact of the Chinese market on the group’s results, LVMH chief financial officer Jean Jacques Guiony said on an earnings call on Tuesday that sales in China, which is facing strict lockdown measures in the face of the latest wave of COVID-19, were down by “heavy double digits.” While the group saw “some improvement” towards the end of Q2, it was “not significant.” Nonetheless, management is confident that the Chinese market “will bounce-back” once the health restrictions are lifted thanks to strong, underlying demand.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 1.0}",positive,1.0,1
"LVMH sales growth slows as Europe, US gains fail to offset China lockdowns - Vogue Business","Tue, 26 Jul 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZvZ3VlYnVzaW5lc3MuY29tL2NvbXBhbmllcy9sdm1oLXNhbGVzLWdyb3d0aC1zbG93cy1hcy1ldXJvcGUtdXMtZ2FpbnMtZmFpbC10by1vZmZzZXQtY2hpbmEtbG9ja2Rvd25z0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"To receive the Vogue Business newsletter, sign up here.

LVMH said sales growth slowed in the second quarter as a strong performance in Europe and the US failed to fully offset the impact of China’s Covid restrictions.

Revenues rose 19 per cent in the second quarter of 2022 to €14.7 billion, compared to 23 per cent growth in the first quarter, LVMH said in a statement today. Still, the sales beat analyst expectations. The luxury conglomerate also said its business in China is “normalising”, but still lags behind where it was last year. Sales in the fashion and leather goods division, its largest, rose 19 per cent in the second quarter, compared with a 30 per cent rise in the first quarter. Europe and the US were the key growth drivers (up 48 and 22 per cent respectively) in the second quarter, while Asia was down 8 per cent.

LVMH joins Richemont and Burberry who also reported an ongoing hit to China sales from Covid-19 lockdowns. Chief financial officer Jean-Jacques Guiony dismissed concerns and stressed LVMH’s resilience in a call with analysts, noting a trend in Americans shopping in Europe particularly as the US dollar strengthens. “Bear in mind that in the last three months, we have been doing plus 22 per cent growth in the US on top of a 30 per cent growth last year. Needless to say that we are not particularly gloomy and pessimistic as to the outlook.” Still, he added if things worsen, “we'll cut costs, openings, etc. The key is to react swiftly.”","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9980329871177673}",positive,0.9980329871177673,1
Here's Jay-Z's Perspective On Selling Half of Champagne Brand To LVMH: 'It Was A Beautiful Marriage' - Black Enterprise,"Wed, 20 Jul 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5ibGFja2VudGVycHJpc2UuY29tL2hlcmVzLWpheS16cy1wZXJzcGVjdGl2ZS1vbi1zZWxsaW5nLWhhbGYtb2YtY2hhbXBhZ25lLWJyYW5kLXRvLWx2bWgtaXQtd2FzLWEtYmVhdXRpZnVsLW1hcnJpYWdlL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Billionaire rap mogul Shawn Carter, famously known as Jay-Z, is dropping gems on ownership.

In 2021, Jay-Z made headlines for his massive Ace of Spades sale to LVMH’s spirit and wine division Moët Hennessy. He sold a 50 percent stake in his champagne brand, which astounded many, but means he raked in at least $315 million from the deal, per Revolt TV.

The move was a “beautiful marriage,” Jay-Z said during a recent appearance on Kevin Hart’s Hart to Heart series on Peacock. But the father of three digs a little deeper, referencing the late Apple CEO Steve Jobs, and more.

According to the New York rapper, Jobs only had about a one percent stake in Apple at the time of his death. But the percentage is minute in comparison to what the multi-trillion dollar tech company had generated before his death.

“We’ve been trained to look at the percentage of something you own. It ain’t what you own; you can own 100 percent of nothing,” he explained. “It’s whatever the strategy calls for. Like Ace, LVMH was a brilliant strategic partner for me.”

According to Forbes, the deal valued Jay-Z’s champagne brand, Armand de Brignac, at over $600 million. While the numbers are massive, the “Empire State of Mind” rapper seems to be more proud of his emergence in the champagne industry as a Black man.

He said, “There’s no one that looks like us in champagne. It’s such a small place, very small.”

Jay-Z continued to explain further that his partnership with LMVH is an intention to propel his brand forward. Most importantly, the Carter patriarch is considering the futures of his children and the next generation.

“I owned a 100 percent. I could’ve said, ‘I want to own a 100 percent of this thing,’ or I could own 50 percent of it and … push it even further,” he continued.”It’s still an asset that I can pass on to my kids.”

“The ideal really is to create these things and these foundations to pass on to the next generation.”

"LVMH Parfums Christian Dior Beauty as a Legacy 2030 sustainability plan highlights flowers, collaboration - CosmeticsDesign-Europe.com","Tue, 19 Jul 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiogFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jb3NtZXRpY3NkZXNpZ24tZXVyb3BlLmNvbS9BcnRpY2xlLzIwMjIvMDcvMTkvTFZNSC1QYXJmdW1zLUNocmlzdGlhbi1EaW9yLUJlYXV0eS1hcy1hLUxlZ2FjeS0yMDMwLXN1c3RhaW5hYmlsaXR5LXBsYW4taGlnaGxpZ2h0cy1mbG93ZXJzLWNvbGxhYm9yYXRpb27SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"In May this year, prestige perfume and cosmetics house Parfums Christian Dior unveiled its Beauty as a Legacy 2030​ sustainability roadmap outlining a range of goals designed to mitigate the company’s impact on planet and communities – part of parent firm LVMH’s wider action plan launched last year.

Parfums Christian Dior had divided its sustainability agenda into five pillars: regenerative cultivation; cultural responsibility; responsible beauty; eco-design; and climate. And amongst the raft of measures within the strategy were goals to ensure all gardens and partner gardens used organic and/or regenerative agriculture practices; the aim to keep more than 50% of women in key positions and build on this; ensure 80% of its products contained more than 90% ingredients of natural origin; phase-out virgin fossil plastics in favour of fully recyclable or refillable packaging; along with reducing its carbon footprint across Scope 1, 2 and 3 by 46% compared to 2019.

“The science is very clear; businesses need to step up, need to accelerate the pace of change,”​ said Isabelle Sultan, chief sustainability officer at Parfums Christian Dior.

“Just reading the latest IPCC [United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change] reports​, we all know it’s a warning – it’s now or never. The cost of inaction will be much higher than the cost of action and we really need to collectively address the biodiversity and climate emergencies,”​ Sultan told CosmeticsDesign-Europe.

Parfums Christian Dior’s 2030 strategy was merely just the “short-term”​ agenda to achieve this, she said, because of the urgency for “immediate action”.​ But it had been developed with “long-term investments in mind”,​ she said. The goal to almost half the company’s full scope of carbon emissions by 2030, for example, was not a net-zero trajectory at this stage, she said, but instead critically focused on reduction.

The power of flowers – ‘it’s part of our DNA’​

A significant part of Parfums Christian Dior’s short- and long-term sustainability vision centred around its work with flowers, Sultan said, used both for fragrances and active ingredients throughout its portfolio.

And this year the company had therefore kickstarted a biodiversity impact assessment to better understand regeneration opportunities throughout its supply chain. It had also partnered with Paris-based agricultural campus HECTAR to launch an education program focused on regenerative flower farming, starting next year.

“We are speaking about flowers because it’s part of our DNA. Monsieur Dior grew up in a garden, he was a passionate gardener and his deep love for flowers was very visible and at the heart of his work since 1947. It remains a legacy which drives our house today,”​ she said.

“…Wild flowers are often perceived only as delicate or ornamental, but they are vital to ecosystems and very powerful drivers for biodiversity because they are the origin of fruits and grains, because they are flowering plants. They capture CO2 back into the soil, they play a key role in the water cycle, and they provide livelihood to growers and farmers. So, that’s what we need to have in mind; to look at them as powerful drivers.”​

And these flowering plants, or flowers, Sultan said, were facing distinction “far quicker”​ than insects, birds or mammals. “I think that very few people have in mind that everything is linked and that it’s also these flowers and flowering plants that we need to invest in, to both preserve them and reintroduce them into ecosystems to drive positive impact.”​

To do so, she said collaboration would be “absolutely critical”​ – within industry but also with external partners, at grower level and throughout the wider supply chain.

“My wish is that, together, we are able to rethink and redefine the codes of what success looks like, what beauty is, and to stand for enhanced harmony.”​

Sustainability is a ‘no-brainer’ for any business​

Sultan said expectations around conducting sustainable business had fast evolved in recent years, including for beauty, and was now simply a “no-brainer for any business in any industry”. ​Sustainability today, she said, had to be placed at the core of every business strategy.

And this pressure was equally relevant to every part of the beauty category – both mass and prestige. “I think we really should acknowledge the importance of all industries, and both mass and prestige beauty coming together to create a more sustainable beauty industry overall.”​

What a brand like Parfums Christian Dior could contribute, she said, was influence, because it was such a well-known and loved brand. “Of course, as a premium, luxury business, our customers expect the highest quality ingredients and products, and this inherently aligns with the use of sustainable ingredients and aligns with our impact on planet and society.”​

But there remained challenges up ahead, Sultan said, the biggest being the “urgency and speed” ​required.

Industry, collectively and individually as businesses, had to not only mobilise quickly to collaborate and trigger wider action, it also had to speed up its capabilities in measuring environmental impacts at every stage of the supply chain, she said.

“We really believe we have a role to play in beating today’s global challenges and basically accelerating our sustainability agenda. And that is exactly the purpose of our Beauty as a Legacy strategy: outlining our roadmap to create more sustainable ways of operating through our value chain within the coming decade,”​ Sultan said.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9997997879981995}",neutral,0.9997997879981995,0
High Jewelry Shines in First Half for LVMH - National Jeweler,"Wed, 27 Jul 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vbmF0aW9uYWxqZXdlbGVyLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy8xMTExNy1oaWdoLWpld2Vscnktc2hpbmVzLWluLWZpcnN0LWhhbGYtZm9yLWx2bWjSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Paris—A strong performance by Tiffany & Co. in the United States and record sales of high jewelry drove were the growth drivers for LVMH’s watch and jewelry brands in the first half of the year.

LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton reported Tuesday that revenue in its Watches & Jewelry division grew 22 percent in the first half of the year (16 percent with comparable structure and constant exchange rates, i.e., on an organic basis) to €4.91 billion ($4.98 billion).

Profit from recurring operations was up 26 percent.

In jewelry, Tiffany had an “excellent” first half of the year, LVMH said, driven by U.S. sales, continued demand for the “Knot” collection and record sales of jewelry from “Blue Book,” the retailer’s annual high jewelry release. “Wonder Woman” actress Gal Gadot fronted the campaign for the collection, “Botanica: Blue Book 2022.”







For Bulgari, legacy lines “Bzero1 Classic” and “Serpenti” drove sales growth as did its high jewelry and high watchmaking collection, “Eden: the Garden of Wonders,” and the new “Octo Finissimo Ultra” watch.

Though jewelry and watches showed growth in the first half, they were not the top sellers for the Paris-based luxury conglomerate.

Sales in the company’s Fashion & Leather Goods division posted the highest revenue and the greatest percentage increase in organic revenue at 24 percent, followed by Selective Retailing, which includes Sephora and DFS. The division posted a 22 percent increase thanks largely to a return to in-store shopping at Sephora.

Overall, LVMH said it had an “excellent first half in a still-disputed environment,” with sales totaling €36.7 billion ($37.13 billion), a 28 percent year-over-year increase (21 percent on an organic basis).

Profit from recurring operations rose 34 percent to €10.24 billion ($10.36 billion).

In the second quarter, revenue was up 27 percent (19 percent on an organic basis) against a strong second quarter in 2021.

LVMH said sales in the U.S. and Europe have risen sharply so far this year, while growth in China has been muted due to the COVID-19 lockdowns in cities like Shanghai.

Commenting on the half-year ahead, LVMH Chairman and CEO Bernard Arnault said: “We approach the second half of the year with confidence but given the current geopolitical and health situation, we will remain vigilant and count on the agility and talent of our teams to further strengthen our global leadership position in luxury goods in 2022.”","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 1.0}",positive,1.0,1
Luxury Tycoon Bernard Arnault Locks In Family Ownership of Holding Company - Yahoo Finance,"Thu, 21 Jul 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9sdXh1cnktdHljb29uLWJlcm5hcmQtYXJuYXVsdC1sb2Nrcy0xNjUxNDk3MDQuaHRtbD9mcj1zeWNocF9jYXRjaGFsbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS — Financière Agache, Bernard Arnault’s main holding company, said Thursday it plans to convert into a limited joint-stock partnership in a move designed to hand control of the entity to his five children.

Following the conversion, the control of Agache will be exercised by its general partner, Agache Commandité SAS, the share capital of which will be held equally between the children of the chairman and chief executive officer of LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton: Delphine Arnault, Antoine Arnault, Alexandre Arnault, Frédéric Arnault and Jean Arnault.

All of them work for LVMH and are in line to succeed their father as head of the group.

Agache is the controlling shareholder of Christian Dior SE and LVMH SE. The Arnault family group cumulatively controls 48 percent of LVMH’s capital and 63.5 percent of its voting rights, according to stock market regulator AMF. Meanwhile, it holds 97.5 percent of the capital of Christian Dior SE, which controls LVMH, and 98.4 percent of voting rights.

Bernard Arnault, 73, will be the first and only managing general partner of Agache. Thereafter, Agache Commandité SAS is due to be appointed as managing general partner, suggesting that responsibility for the family group will fall to the five children equally.

“This new structure will permit to perpetuate the family control over the long term and will permit a unified expression of the controlling shareholder’s voice regarding Christian Dior SE and LVMH SE,” Agache said in a statement published after the market close on Thursday.

Bernard Arnault said: “LVMH, a family-owned group, works to ensure the long-term development of each of its maisons while preserving their unique characters and their strengths. In this respect, the conversion of Agache into a limited joint-stock partnership (société en commandite par actions) announced today, which does not change its current shareholding, will ensure that its control over the LVMH group will be maintained over the long term.”

Story continues

The new structure locks in ownership of the holding group’s shares. In a regulatory filing, the AMF said shares in Agache Commandité could not be sold or transferred for 30 years, unless decided unanimously by a five-person administration committee, which will consist initially of the five siblings.

At the end of this period, only descendants of Bernard Arnault or legal entities wholly owned by these descendants may hold shares, and any transfer of shares in Agache Commandité will be subject to a right of first refusal as set out in the shareholders’ agreement, the AMF specified.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999951124191284}",neutral,0.9999951124191284,0
Jay Chou's New Single Gives Boost to LVMH's La Samaritaine - Jing Daily,"Wed, 06 Jul 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiOmh0dHBzOi8vamluZ2RhaWx5LmNvbS9wb3N0cy9qYXktY2hvdS1uZXctbXYtbGEtc2FtYXJpdGFpbmXSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"What happened

The King of Mandopop is back. After six years, Jay Chou is finally dropping a new album on July 15. Ahead of the release, the Taiwanese singer-songwriter shared a music video for his latest single on July 6 titled “Greatest Works of Art,” which includes visual and lyrical references to famous artists such as Salvador Dalí, Monet, Matisse, Munch, and Van Gogh. Interestingly, the video opens and closes with a shot of the artist performing at La Samaritaine , an LVMH-owned department store in Paris that reopened last June after 16 years of renovations.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1emA1EFsPMMamp;t=302s

The Jing Take

Living up to his moniker, the multi-hyphenated artist is famous for fusing Chinese and western music styles and has sold over 30 million records over the course of his career. In addition to gracing stages and music stations around Asia, he has also appeared in Hollywood movies such as The Green Hornet and Now You See Me 2, and served as the ambassador for Swiss luxury watchmaker Tudor. This new music video sees him back in the global spotlight, garnering over 109 million views on Weibo (plus 3 million on YouTube) within nine hours of being posted.

But Chou isn’t the only one who could receive a publicity boost. By highlighting La Samaritaine in the video and lyrics — “I’m playing a magical symphony, wandering in Samaritaine, renovated throughout the years” — the musician could bring greater brand awareness to the iconic Paris retail building. After all, this wouldn't be the first time Chou has called attention to a travel destination: his 2020 single “Mojito ,” which was filmed in Cuba, spurred a flurry of memes, tribute videos, articles, and mojito promotional deals, and even got a shout out from the Cuban Embassy in China in hope of attracting more Chinese tourists to the island.

Of course, with borders back home still largely closed because of the pandemic, it could be a while before Paris sees an influx of holidaying mainlanders. However, with this group spending roughly 260 billion on travel in 2019 , putting La Samaritaine in the front of their minds certainly doesn’t hurt. Featuring seven levels of luxury, beauty, and niche labels, the building is, as Chou’s video encapsulates, one of the greatest works of art — and the perfect place to splurge.

The Arnault clan and its factory of heirs - Le Monde,"Wed, 13 Jul 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlbW9uZGUuZnIvZW4vc3VtbWVyLXJlYWRzL2FydGljbGUvMjAyMi8wNy8xMy90aGUtYXJuYXVsdC1jbGFuLWFuZC1pdHMtZmFjdG9yeS1vZi1oZWlyc181OTg5OTc5XzE4My5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Investigation'Successions' (Season 1, 1/5). Bernard Arnault, the CEO of LVMH world's leading luxury group, has strictly supervised his children's education and the five heirs to the company are currently learning the ropes while waiting for the patriarch to choose his successor.

Season 1 of ""Successions"" was originally published in French in the summer of 2021. Season 2 will be published in French and English as part of our 2022 Summer Reads.

Every month the six of them get together in one of the lounge rooms on the ninth and top floor of the LVMH headquarters at 22 Avenue Montaigne, Paris. The five children, born from two different marriages – Delphine, Antoine, Alexandre, Frédéric and Jean – surround their father, Bernard Arnault. They look strikingly similar: tall, slender, with high foreheads and light-colored eyes, all perfectly polite, with an impeccable, composed look thanks to the group's brands – Dior, Vuitton, Berluti, etc. – giving them a permanent ""fresh out of the dry cleaners"" kind of look.

The six of them speak to each other several times a day. Most of them are neighbors in the chic districts of Paris. They regularly cross paths at fashion shows, and one of the five will always accompany the father, owner and CEO of the world's number one luxury goods company, on his weekly tour of the group's stores on Avenue Montaigne, at the Le Bon Marché department store, or in the recently-renovated Samaritaine department store in the center of Paris. The monthly meeting at the headquarters, however, is special. It is partly a family lunch, partly a mini-board of directors meeting and, above all, it is a high-flying course in business practice.

The eldest son Antoine Arnault, 44, has a soft look and a three-day beard. He is anxious to humanize the clan's public image. He does not quite see it like this, calling the meeting ""an opportunity to get together and talk about our lives."" But his father quickly corrected him: ""Let's face it, we mostly talk about issues relating to the business."" It is Arnault Senior who draws up the agenda for the lunch each month on his iPad, with his usual chilling rigor. The meal, strictly healthy, should not last more than an hour and a half. The hiring of a designer, the opening of a boutique, the acquisition of a new brand... The patriarch submits everything to the judgment of his children, allowing them all to have their say.

'Our father, our boss'

""Don't be fooled,"" said Jean, the youngest, who just finished his studies and is preparing to enter the business like his older siblings. ""Ultimately, he is always the one to make the final decision."" The five heirs are learning the ropes under their father's guidance, like young lions learning to hunt in front of the king of the clan, who will, one day, decide who will be his successor. Alexandre, the third in line, finds it hard to mask his appetite for power, and sums up in one sentence the strange mixture of blood ties and business: ""He is our father, of course, but also our boss.""

LVMH Skincare Brand Puts Fresh Spin on Influencer Marketing - Jing Daily,"Thu, 07 Jul 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vamluZ2RhaWx5LmNvbS9wb3N0cy9mcmVzaC1za2luY2FyZS1jeW5kaS13YW5nLW5vc3RhbGdpYS1tYXJrZXRpbmfSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"What happened

Skincare brand Fresh has chosen Taiwanese singer Cyndi Wang 王心凌 to front the campaign of its latest release, a skin resilience activating serum called Tea Elixir. While leaning on KOLs is not new, the 39-year-old star is not the typical influencer that youth-obsessed beauty brands turn to. However, as one of the standout contestants on Season 3 of Chinese reality show Sisters Who Make Waves 乘风破浪的姐姐, Wang can help the LVMH-owned label not only boost its brand awareness but recruit a diverse pool of new consumers: namely, men and women of all ages.

Founded in 1991, American company Fresh is known for sensorial skincare. It was acquired by LVMH in 1999 and entered China via Tmall two decades later in 2017.

The Jing Take

International brands have stepped up their efforts to tap into China’s lucrative skincare market, which is expected to reach 69 billion (465.5 billion yuan) by 2025. This is especially true for Fresh. With functional and medical skincare rising in demand, it’s little wonder it has started doubling down on marketing and expansion.

In addition to Wang, Fresh has partnered with Olympic speed skater Wu Dajing to promote Tea Elixir. Photo: Fresh

In particular, appointing Wang allows Fresh to capitalize on nostalgia marketing. An icon of the early 2000s (some netizens even refer to her as “sweet grandma”), her recent performance of her 2004 hit song “Love you” has been watched more than 2.5 million times on Douyin, evoking vivid memories for young adults who grew up with her songs. Funnily enough, videos of young fathers dancing along with their babies have especially flourished on social media — some of which have gained 28,000 likes and 60,000 reshares — serving as a testament to Wang’s popularity.

Besides sparking memories of simpler times, Wang also attracts a large following across the gender and age spectrums. Her willingness to reinvent herself on the show while staying authentic has struck a chord with Gen Z, who are known for being more individualistic than previous generations. Thus, Wang hits the sweet spot between drawing older consumers with nostalgia and recruiting younger fans with her trending performances.

While the endorsement of the Tea Elixir product received a paltry 2,200 likes on the brand’s Weibo page, it earned 20 times more likes on Wang’s personal page at 46,300 likes. Companies should note that this is normal; brand pages don’t collect a massive number of likes, but a celebrity’s page is where all the action will be.

"With Parallels at Play, What Does the Tiffany v. LVMH Case Mean for Twitter v. Musk? - The Fashion Law","Thu, 21 Jul 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWZhc2hpb25sYXcuY29tL3doYXQtaWYtYW55dGhpbmctZG9lcy10aGUtdGlmZmFueS12LWx2bWgtY2FzZS1tZWFuLWZvci10d2l0dGVyLXYtbXVzay_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Twitter has landed a win in the first round of the case that it is waging against Elon Musk in the wake of the Tesla and SpaceX chief executive attempting to back out of a $44 billion agreement to acquire the social media platform. Between the high-profile nature of the case and the claims that Musk’s legal team is waging in an attempt to get him out of the deal that the parties reached in April, the lawsuit – which was filed in the Delaware Chancery Court on July 12 – draws something of a neat line to a similarly-closely-watched, deal-centric case that landed before the Delaware court in September 2020: the since-settled one that Tiffany & Co. filed against LVMH when it sought to walk away from a $16.2 billion deal to acquire the famed jewelry brand.

For a bit of background, Twitter sued Musk earlier this month for allegedly failing to uphold his end of a $44 billion deal to buy the social media platform. “Musk apparently believes that he – unlike every other party subject to Delaware contract law – is free to change his mind, trash the company, disrupt its operations, destroy stockholder value, and walk away,” the San Francisco-based social media company asserted in its complaint. The basis for Musk’s move to pull the plug on the deal? Twitter allegedly “materially” breached the parties’ agreement by making “false and misleading representations” about the number of spam accounts on the platform, with such alleged misrepresentations amounting to a “material adverse event.”

Beyond that, Musk has argued that between the time of signing off on the binding merger agreement and the deal’s closing (slated for October 24, 2022 at the latest subject to a potential 6-month extension), Twitter engaged in activities that fall outside of the ordinary course of business and that are not in line with the Jack Dorsey-founded company’s past practice, namely, by ousting two high-level executives and one-third of its talent acquisition team. (Twitter has argued that it was able to negotiate the “past practices” term out of the parties’ deal agreement – more about that in a minute.)

In short: Musk is arguing, among other things, that he should be able to walk away from the deal without being penalized because: (1) Twitter’s “false and misleading representations” about the number of spam accounts, which Musk says he relied on in entering into that deal, give rise to a “material adverse effect” (“MAE”); and (2) Twitter has failed to comply with the “ordinary course” covenant in the merger agreement by terminating certain employees, slowing hiring, and failing to retain key personnel. (Musk also claims that Twitter breached information-sharing and cooperation covenants related to information about the number of bots.)

If these arguments sound familiar it may be because they were central to the case that Tiffany & Co. levied against LVMH when the French luxury goods group tried to walk away from their deal – albeit the MAE and “ordinary course” claims in that case stemmed from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. (After reaching a deal in November 2019 to acquire Tiffany & Co. for $135 per share, Bernard Arnault-run LVMH attempted to formally back out almost a year later, arguing that Tiffany had failed to “follow an ordinary course of business, notably in distributing substantial dividends when the company was loss making,” and also claiming that “the operation and organization of [Tiffany] are not substantially intact” and that the company was in the midst of suffering from a “durationally significant downturn,” thereby, invoking the MAE clause in the parties’ merger agreement, which they signed-off on ahead of the onset of COVID.)

While the Tiffany v. LVMH suit did not play out in court for long (the parties salvaged the deal for a renegotiated $131.5 per share), Brian JM Quinn, a professor at Boston College Law School, who focuses on corporate law, M&A, and transaction structuring, told TFL this week that had LVMH fought to get out of the deal, instead of renegotiating and settling the suit, it “may have had a reasonable chance of winning on the ordinary course argument given that AB Stable won on the same argument.” (In deciding AB Stable v. MAPS Hotels and Resorts One in December 2021, the Delaware Supreme Court upheld the Court of Chancery’s finding that the seller breached the ordinary course covenant in the merger agreement when it made significant business changes in response to the COVID-19 pandemic without either securing the buyer’s consent or providing it with notice.)

The outcome in AB Stable could – on its face – seems meaningful for Musk, as the ordinary course claim is the one where he “might have some purchase,” per Quinn. However, this is still not likely to be a homerun for Musk, not least because Twitter alleges that while a draft version of the merger contract included a covenant that required Twitter to get Musk’s consent before firing employees at the level of VP and above, that term was ultimately negotiated out of the final agreement, thereby, making it difficult for Musk to successfully argue now that the company breached their deal by firing executives without his consent.

Additionally, Quinn says that Musk is similarly facing an uphill battle in taking issue with Twitter’s failure to retain employees between signing the merger contract and closing the deal. The kicker here is that, according to Twitter, it sought Musk’s consent – on two separate occasions – to establish an employee retention program to beat some of the traditional turnover that follows from mergers, but he allegedly rejected the idea. And finally, Musk is likely to have little luck in gaining traction for his claim that Twitter is not operating “consistent[ly] with past practice,” as Twitter argues that it negotiated this term out of the parties’ final agreement. As such, Quinn contends that Twitter need only “run the business,” and it need not do so in a way that “looks exactly like what they did in the past,” especially in the face of a downturn in the economy, which would not, for example, require it to employ “the same number of people as in they have in the past.”

The seemingly bad news for Musk is that the “ordinary course” claim – which “seems to fall apart once you add additional facts to the picture,” per Quinn – is still a stronger claim that the MAE argument, which centers on Twitter’s routine disclosures to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) about the number of bot accounts on its platform. (In its SEC filings, Twitter estimates that less than 5 percent of Twitter accounts are “false or spam” accounts, but also states a sentence later that “in making this determination, we applied significant judgment, so our estimation of false or spam accounts may not accurately represent the actual number of such accounts, and the actual number of false or spam accounts could be higher than we have estimated.”)

Ann Lipton, a business and securities professor at Tulane, stated on Twitter this week that there simply is “no evidence of an MAE” – or an event or series of events that has caused a significant or material deterioration in the financial health of the target or in the stability of the target’s business between the signing of the agreement and the closing. According to Lipton, it is “not clear how spam accounts would evidence that Twitter made any false statements (it always warned its estimates could be wrong), and [Musk] has not articulated why the information [that] he has is not sufficient to close” to deal.

LVMH and Tiffany famously found their way back to the negotiating table and closed the deal (complete with a 2 percent discount for LVMH and formalized assurances for Tiffany that if LVMH tried to renege again, it would not have any walkaway rights, and thus, the price that would be used by the court for determining damages would be the original $135 per share price”) – making for the largest luxury deal to date, beating out LVMH’s acquisition of Dior for $13.1 billion in 2017. As for whether that will happen for Twitter and Musk is yet to be seen.

The potential outcomes in the event that the parties do not renegotiate the deal for a lower price and subsequently settle the suit are twofold: (1) the court orders specific performance and force Musk to buy Twitter for the agreed-upon price, or (2) the parties reach a settlement in connection with the deal (as distinct from a settlement of the lawsuit) in furtherance of which the two parties agree to get their separate ways and Musk pays some sum of money. That sum would be something larger than the $1 billion termination fee set out in the merger agreement but less than $44 billion.","{'label': 'Negative', 'score': 0.550268292427063}",negative,0.550268292427063,-1
"Bullish on China's Duty-free Future, LVMH, Kering Show at Hainan Expo - WWD","Thu, 28 Jul 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3dkLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy1uZXdzL2dvdmVybm1lbnQtdHJhZGUvbHZtaC1rZXJpbmctaGFpbmFuLWV4cG8tMjAyMi0xMjM1MjY0MzkyL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"SHANGHAI — The tropical city Haikou in Hainan hosted the second China International Consumer Products Expo this Tuesday.

Postponed from April to July due to COVID-19-related restrictions, the second edition of the Expo featured more than 1,322 brands from 58 countries and regions. The Expo is the largest consumer products exhibition in the Asia Pacific region.

LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, Kering, Richemont, Tapestry and Burberry were among the luxury and fashion exhibitors at this year’s fair, showing their commitment to the nascent event and Hainan’s future as a free-trade port shopping paradise.

Andrew Wu, LVMH group president of Greater China attended the Expo to sign a partnership agreement with The Haikou Integrated Free Trade Zone. LVMH will set up a bonded warehouse in the zone dedicated to the group’s perfume and cosmetics travel retail business.

“We have established our presence here through pop-up shops and other retail formats. In the future, consumers all over the world will come here to shop, we think Hainan is very important, and we are highly optimistic about the market,” said Wu.

LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton brought DFS Group, Hublot and Moët Hennessy to the show.

Despite media speculation that Louis Vuitton might set up shop in the zone, the brand denied claims that it is considering any options within the licensed duty-free market.

Kering highlighted jewelry brand Qeelin at the Expo, where the Hainan Gibbon Bo Bo piece made its debut. The unique item will be auctioned off by Christie’s, with proceeds donated to Hainan Provincial Forestry Bureau to support the Hainan tropical rain forest and Hainan gibbon conservation efforts.

Burberry brought a range of products to the fair, including the signature Lola bag and TB Summer Monogram collection. It’s one of the few luxury brands with products that can be directly purchased at the booth.

As an extension of the Lola bag pop-up series, Burberry created an immersive camel-colored space with metallic frames, large golden chains from the ceiling, and merchandising shelves that echoed its iconic Check. The brand also brought along Chinese influencers to celebrate the event.

In April, Tapestry announced Hainan as the new headquarters for China travel retail. The American fashion group showcased Coach, Kate Spade and Stuart Weitzman products at the Expo.

With COVID-19-related travel restrictions, mainland China shoppers had to trade shopping in Paris, London or Milan for shopping locally. According to Bain & Co., the Hainan-trade port has become an emerging market for luxury goods, accounting for 13 percent of sales nationwide in 2021.

Bain & Co. believes China’s luxury market will pick up the pace of recovery and return to 2021 levels by the end of this year or early 2023.

“With retail projects like Haitang Bay on the rise, more non-duty-free businesses launching here, Hainan free-trade port’s strategic position will become more prominent,” said Xing Weiwei, partner at Bain & Co.

Set up by Hainan in 2021, the free-port zone aims to become the world’s largest duty-free consumer market by 2025, with sales exceeding 160 billion renminbi, or $23.7 billion. Hainan Expo serves to showcase Hainan’s ambition and promote consumption.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999963045120239}",neutral,0.9999963045120239,0
LVMH Acquires California's Joseph Phelps Vineyards - VinePair,"Thu, 07 Jul 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiPGh0dHBzOi8vdmluZXBhaXIuY29tL2Jvb3plLW5ld3MvbHZtaC1hY3F1aXJlcy1qb3NlcGgtcGhlbHBzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"In what seems to be a recent trend in the winemaking industry, yet another piece of California vineyard real estate has been snatched up by a large company.

French luxury company LVMH’s Moet Hennessy division shared on Wednesday that it recently closed a deal to acquire Joseph Phelps Vineyards in Napa Valley, according to CNBC. While the financial terms of this acquisition were not disclosed, the company states that this particular vineyard was chosen for its commitment to high-quality wines and shared values with LVMH.

The longstanding, family-owned vineyard was founded in March 1973 and started with a 600-acre plot of land in Napa Valley. Joseph Phelps Vineyard has since grown to include winemaking properties on the Sonoma Coast. It’s known for its Pinot Noir and Chardonnay, which are offered at the Freestone Winery alongside the Sonoma Coast vineyard.

Moet Hennessy chairman and CEO Philippe Schaus remarked that the brand is an “iconic name and iconic winery.” It now has grown from its humble beginnings in Napa Valley to produce a whopping 750,000 bottles a year. One of its most recognizable offerings, Insignia, retails for roughly $250.

LVMH holdings oversees numerous luxury goods brands such as Givenchy, Tiffany & Co., Fendi and Céline. The Moet Hennessy division, under LVMH, manages brands such as Dom Perignon, Hennessy, and Belvedere.

Earlier this month, Foley Family Wines acquired properties held by Silverado Vineyards, another family-owned California winery, for $150 million. It’s another move by a larger wine company to build its already growing portfolio with California vineyard properties.

LVMH's Strategy in Asia is a Multi-Pronged Approach - LUXUO,"Fri, 01 Jul 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmx1eHVvLmNvbS9lZGl0b3JzLXBpY2tzL2x2bWhzLXN0cmF0ZWd5LWluLWFzaWEtaXMtYS1tdWx0aS1wcm9uZ2VkLWFwcHJvYWNoLmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Business / Business of Luxury

Despite the potential of Asia as a major market for the conglomerate, LVMH is not putting all of its eggs in a single basket.

Luxury fashion brands are no stranger to presenting its fashion runway show in Asia. The world’s largest luxury conglomerate, LVMH, had already done its presentations in cities across the region in recent months. While these past presentations were typically spin-offs from the original shows, the decision to re-show in Asian cities unveils the strategic importance of engaging with consumers in this part of the world.

In its recent financial report for Q1, LVMH reported stronger-than-expected sales growth of €18 billion, which is a 29 per cent increase compared to the same period last year. Breaking down the figures, revenue earned from Asia (excluding Japan) registered a modest increase of eight per cent. Overall in 2021, the rest of Asia represented 35 per cent of the total revenue for the Parisian company. To only grow by eight per cent is a worrisome sign, and LVMH is determined to boost sales through vigorous engagement with the region.

Over the past year, brands under the LVMH group have devoted more resources to Asia by staging fashion shows in major capital cities. Last year in April, Dior re-showcased its Fall 2021 show in Shanghai as a guest of honour of Shanghai Fashion Week. Labelmate Louis Vuitton presented its spin-off womenswear show in Singapore last March, and that occasion marked the return of physical shows. A week ago, Louis Vuitton staged its Fall/Winter 2022 spin-off in Bangkok. Apart from its Fashion & Leather division, jewellery brands like Bvlgari and Tiffany & Co. also organised exhibitions to connect with local clients.

To understand the reason why LVMH places importance on Asia is simple: it is the fastest growing region in terms of GDP. According to The Financial Times, “Over the next two years, gross domestic product will rise faster in Asia than in the Americas and Europe, strengthening its position as the largest and fastest-growing economic bloc.” Asia’s GDP is expected to expand from US$33 trillion to US$39 trillion by 2023. This means that with economic growth, the income of its citizens will likely increase, which creates a pool of mass consumers who have the money to buy luxury goods.

Furthermore, luxury goods have been known to be a status signifier and this line of thinking is still prevalent in Asian countries. Capitalising on this phenomenon, companies like LVMH ensure that its presence is felt throughout with regular interactions. The idea that the world has entered an “Asian Century” has been echoed by many over the past few years and this further strengthens Asia’s strategic importance.

Being the main engine of growth in Asia, China has been accredited as the primary market that brands aim to target. The country’s double-digit economic expansion is a significant boon for LVMH as luxury goods have a high income elasticity of demand. In other words, as people become wealthier, they will buy more of the luxury goods. Coupled with the predominance of social media as a platform to flaunt one’s wealth, owning a Dior Saddle Bag has increasingly become a necessity.

Understanding the market’s potential, brands under LVMH have also chosen to appoint more Asian ambassadors. At Louis Vuitton, South Korean boyband BTS is its global ambassador, alongside tennis superstar Naomi Osaka and Jung Ho-Yeon of Squid Game fame. While Dior appointed Jisoo of girl group Blackpink to be its global ambassador while her other group members Lisa is the face of Celine and Rosè representing Tiffany & Co. The various representatives are to galvanise further support for its brands, and results have shown, especially in the Fashion & Leather division — it grew by 30 per cent in Q1, so the strategy of leveraging on the fame of these Asian celebrities has worked to LVMH’s advantage.

However, while China remains to be one of the key markets that LVMH is targeting, there is also a need to decouple from the Chinese market. Earlier in March this year, the Chinese government ordered a lockdown in multiple major cities like Beijing, Shanghai, and Shenzhen to pursue a zero-Covid policy. Many stores had to close including luxury brands under the LVMH group. Perhaps, this was why two shows were conducted in Southeast Asia, to diversify its sales channels. The economies in ASEAN remain positive, and growth is estimated to hit seven per cent, according to a forecast by the Asian Development Bank.

Opportunities are abound in Southeast Asia. The region is one of the world’s fastest growing in terms of income, and its youths are leading the charge in consumer spending on luxury goods. Brands under the LVMH group are still top choices for the burgeoning young spenders in ASEAN, and this could be attributed to pop culture influence as mentioned earlier.

LVMH’s strategy in Asia is quite clear-cut. It is definitely putting more emphasis on engaging with the region, but it does not base its business decisions on a blanket approach. The group is cognizant of its over-reliance on the Chinese market and is attempting to minimise any future impacts through diversification. As the saying goes, “Don’t put all your eggs in one basket”, its stronghold in Japan and South Korea has proven some results and it is continuing its efforts in the Southeast Asia region.

Diesel Jeans Founder Wants Italian Luxury Line - PYMNTS.com,"Mon, 11 Jul 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5weW1udHMuY29tL25ld3MvcmV0YWlsLzIwMjIvZGllc2VsLWplYW5zLWZvdW5kZXItY3JlYXRpbmctaXRhbGlhbi12ZXJzaW9uLW9mLWZyZW5jaC1sdXh1cnktY29uZ2xvbWVyYXRlcy1sdm1oLWtlcmluZy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Diesel founder Renzo Rosso told Financial Times he envisions his Italian luxury fashion empire, including sister brands Jil Sander and Marni, as one that’s modeled after — and will compete with — Kering, LVMH and other large, well-known names in the space.

Rosso, chair of holding company Only The Brave, founded Diesel in 1978 when he was 23 and today employs more than 6,000 workers at seven fashion brands around the world, according to the report Sunday (July 10).

“Italy doesn’t have a domestic luxury conglomerate like the French ones,” he told FT. “My plan is to create one.” That includes a stock market listing and plans to hire bankers to advise him, the report said.

“Of course our [market capitalization] will be different from the big French groups, but my ambition is to show that Italian brands can come together and strengthen each other,” Rosso said. “It’s not easy, but we are on the lookout for brands that can strengthen our luxury positioning. We will demonstrate to the world that even Italy can have its own luxury conglomerate.”

The European Union banned the export of goods worth more than 300 euros ($302) to Russia in March, putting a crimp in luxury fashion sales in that region, but Russia is only the 14th-largest global trade partner for Italian luxury labels, according to Italy’s national fashion chamber, with 1.4 billion euros ($1.4 billion) in luxury goods exported there last year.

Russia and Ukraine account for about 2% of OTB’s annual revenues, at 1.53 billion euros ($1.54 billion) in 2021, up from 1.3 billion euros ($1.3 billion) in 2020. The company has no stores in either country.

Japan, meanwhile, makes up about 25% of OTB’s total revenue. The company opened a store in South Korea last year, and about one-third of its investments in the next three years will be focused on Chinese expansion, looking to double the 80 stores and 1,000 employees there today by 2024.

Phelps Sale Shows Fine Wine Still Hot - Wine-Searcher,"Tue, 05 Jul 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndpbmUtc2VhcmNoZXIuY29tL20vMjAyMi8wNy9waGVscHMtc2FsZS1zaG93cy1maW5lLXdpbmUtc3RpbGwtaG900gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The sale of a prestigious Napa winery to French luxury giant LVMH shows how recession-resistant wine is.

© LVMH | The Joseph Phelps Insignia was a crucial wine for Napa and has remained one of the region's most sought-after cuvées.

If you want a statement about the strength of the luxury wine market, look no further than last week's purchase of Napa Valley's Joseph Phelps Vineyards by the French luxury company LVMH.

First of all, there's the purchase price. I have heard $725 million; LVMH would neither confirm or deny it. If true, it dwarfs the prices for other Napa wineries sold in recent years, like the $315 million paid for Frank Family, $250 million paid for Shafer Vineyards and the $150 million paid for Silverado Vineyards. The deal comes with 425 acres of vineyards in Napa Valley and 100 in Sonoma County, which may account for the high price.

The interest-rate hike by the US Federal Reserve bank last month just made the Phelps deal cost many millions more for LVMH, but that wasn't enough to slow it down. Nor, apparently, will it stop other big deals in the works. Azur Associates, a wine business consultancy company based in Napa, posted after the deal: ""We believe there are some very notable Napa Valley transactions yet to come in the near future.""

LVMH chairman Bernard Arnault is the richest man in Europe. He could afford to buy a winery for fun, but that's not how he operates. Neither do the buyers in other recent transactions. Shafer was bought by a Korean high-end department store chain and Silverado by Foley Family Wines, which is run by a guy who got rich in the insurance underwriting business. Foley bought a hockey team for fun; he bought Silverado to make money.

The wine industry is struggling at the low end, with bottles under $11. But at the higher end, it's still smooth sailing, even as we might be entering a recession. Rob McMillan, executive vice president of Silicon Valley Bank's wine division, says that while wine is not recession-proof, it is recession-resistant.

Moreover, Napa Valley producers are in a strong position right now paradoxically because of the troubled 2020 vintage. Inventories are low; that means demand is ahead of supply.

""We are seeing good demand,"" McMillan said. ""The growth rate in 2019 had been trending down, to 5 percent for premium wine as I define it. It went up in the early days of the pandemic, after the initial panic phase. We're still exceeding where we were in 2019 in sales growth at the fine wine side.""

Search for a ""strong red""

The Phelps deal was announced by Philippe Schaus, CEO and Chairman of LVMH's wine division. He told CNBC that the company wants to serve ""all the different moments of consumption"", including fine dining and bars, clubs and cocktails. He also said that the company has Cloudy Bay for white wine and Whispering Angel for rosé, but ""we were missing a strong red wine"".

LVMH owns Cheval freakin' Blanc! The White Horse of Bordeaux recently expanded by buying its neighbor, but still, even for wealthy people, Cheval Blanc has become more of an investment than a beverage. LVMH also owns Cape Mentelle in Margaret River. I would love to have been a fly on the wall there when the ""strong red wine"" quote came out because I could use some new Australian profanity. LVMH also owns Numanthia in Toro and Terrazas de los Andes in Mendoza.

But its investment in California wine to this point has been the sparkling house Domaine Chandon (whose tete-de-cuvée I personally drank to celebrate the Warriors' recent title 'cause it's that good), a majority share in the tiny cult winery Colgin Cellars, and Newton Vineyard. Newton may have been LVMH's plan for a Napa red-wine venture when it bought a majority share in 2001, but the winery was badly damaged in the 2020 Glass Fire. Even before that, though, Newton has never gained the attention of buyers of upscale California red wines in the way that Phelps has.

Joseph Phelps was a building contractor who won a bid to build Souverain Winery and caught the wine bug, buying a 600-acre cattle ranch in Napa Valley in 1973, when cattle ranches still existed there, and planting vineyards on it. In 1974 he did something so incredibly obvious that it boggles the mind that he was the pioneer of it in California: he released a red Bordeaux blend called Insignia. That became one of the most consistently sought after wines for decades; the 2002 vintage was named Wine Spectator's Wine of the Year for the entire world in 2005.

Phelps also was among the first Napa vintners to realize that cooler, coastal Sonoma County is where it's at for Chardonnay. When he first planted in Freestone people wondered if it was going to be warm enough to ripen grapes, but now cool climate is hot and he has 100 acres there.

What made Phelps attractive is its combination of size – 60,000 cases a year, nearly twice as much as Shafer – with the price its wines can attract. Insignia sells for $315, and LVMH can easily make more of it because it's not a single-vineyard or monovarietal wine. That doesn't mean the quality will drop: LVMH understands luxury goods as well as any wine company. But I did mention that Cheval Blanc bought its neighbor, right? There are ways to quietly expand, and they're worth pursuing when the fine-wine market is as robust as it apparently is.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9997543692588806}",neutral,0.9997543692588806,0
LVMH posts double-digit revenue and profits growth in first half - The Moodie Davitt Report,"Tue, 26 Jul 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vbW9vZGllZGF2aXR0cmVwb3J0LmNvbS9sdm1oLXBvc3RzLWRvdWJsZS1kaWdpdC1yZXZlbnVlLWFuZC1wcm9maXRzLWdyb3d0aC1pbi1maXJzdC1oYWxmL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"FRANCE/INTERNATIONAL. Leading luxury goods group LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton posted revenue of €36.7 billion in the first half of 2022, up +28% compared to the same period in 2021. Organic revenue growth was +21%. All business groups achieved double-digit organic revenue growth in the period.

Profit from recurring operations climbed +34% to €10,235 million in the half. Operating margin reached 27.9% of revenue, up 1.3 points compared to the first half of 2021. Group share of net profit was €6,532 million, up +23% compared to the first half of 2021.

In Selective Retailing, which includes DFS Group (co-owned by LVMH and DFS Co-Founder Robert Miller) and Starboard Cruise Services, revenue climbed +22% in the first half of 2022. Profit from recurring operations was up +181%.

LVMH noted that DFS was affected during the first half “by persistent weakness of international travel, notably due to the tightening of health restrictions in China”.

Addressing DFS performance in its results presentation, LVMH cited the “almost complete closure of important destinations such as Hong Kong and Macau” due to COVID restrictions as well as a “slow start of activity in Hainan”.

More positively it hailed progressive reopenings in Australia, Middle East and North America and “good success of La Samaritaine Paris Pont-Neuf with both Parisians and tourists”.

The Wines & Spirits business group recorded organic revenue growth of +14% in the first half. Profit from recurring operations was up +25% compared to the first half of 2021. Against a backdrop of strong demand, Champagne volumes rose +16% year-on-year, leading to increasing pressure on supplies.

For Cognac Hennessy, the impact of health restrictions in China and logistical disruptions in the US was offset by a rebound in the second quarter linked to a catch-up in deliveries to the US and a firm policy of price increases. Moët Hennessy strengthened its global portfolio with the signing of an agreement to acquire the Joseph Phelps Vineyards, a leading wine property in Napa Valley, California.

The Fashion & Leather Goods business group recorded organic revenue growth of +24% in the first half. Profit from recurring operations rose +33%. Louis Vuitton maintained its profitability “at an exceptional level” while Christian Dior posted “remarkable growth” in all its product categories.

Fendi recorded solid growth, driven by the success of the Kim Jones collections. Celine was boosted by the ready-to-wear and leathergoods created by Hedi Slimane, while Loewe showed strong momentum. Loro Piana and Marc Jacobs also enjoyed an excellent first half of the year, said LVMH.

The Perfumes & Cosmetics business recorded organic revenue growth of +13% in the first half. Profit from recurring operations was down -1% due to its highly selective policy in distribution and promotions. Parfums Christian Dior performed well, with fragrance and makeup contributing. Guerlain continued to grow, driven by its Abeille Royale skincare, its Aqua Allegoria collection and its Parfumerie l’Art et la Matière.

The Watches & Jewelry business achieved organic revenue growth of +16% in the first half with profit from recurring operations up +26%. In jewellery, Tiffany & Co. turned in an “excellent” performance, with momentum from the US business.

At Bvlgari, the Serpenti and Bzero1 Classic lines were important growth drivers, while new records were set by the recently launched High Jewelry and High Watchmaking collection Eden The Garden of Wonders and its watch lines. Chaumet and Fred performed well over the first half.

Chairman and CEO Bernard Arnault said: “We approach the second half of the year with confidence, but given the current geopolitical and health situation, we will remain vigilant and count on the agility and talent of our teams to further strengthen our global leadership position in luxury goods in 2022.”","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9999998807907104}",positive,0.9999998807907104,1

Central to this recognition is Ms. Tu Yanping, a delivery rider with Dada Now, who received the prestigious “Gold Rider of the Year” title from Luckin Coffee. She is one of only four national recipients and the only woman to be honored.

Tu, who has been with Dada Now for nearly two years, has served at various Luckin Coffee stores within the Haimen District of Nantong City in Jiangsu Province. Her commitment ensures that every cup of coffee is delivered promptly to eagerly waiting customers. To date, she has completed over 20,000 orders, maintaining an exceptional on-time delivery rate of 99.9%. Dada Now has a high-quality coffee delivery standard with a strict “30-minute delivery within 3 kilometers” guarantee.

“I always make it a point never to exceed the delivery time limit to ensure that the coffee’s taste is preserved,” Tu said in an interview. She recognizes that for coffee lovers, each cup of coffee represents a unique experience, and timely delivery is crucial for maintaining its quality. Additionally, after delivery, she offers thoughtful instructions to customers on how to enjoy their coffee at its best, immediately after delivery.

“While many riders can deliver quickly, Tu’s exceptional attention to detail sets her apart, ensuring she maintains exceptionally high customer satisfaction ratings,” said Juanjuan Shen, who oversees Tu’s delivery station in Haimen. In instances when customers cannot receive their coffee orders in person, Tu diligently takes and sends photos to provide reassurance. Moreover, in the event of mishaps such as coffee spillage, she promptly contacts the customer and arranges for the coffee to be remade and delivered. This meticulous service has consistently upheld her customer satisfaction at a remarkable level.

As a mother of three, Tu finds that her role at Dada enables her to balance her family duties with personal fulfillment. Her dedication demonstrates that women can thrive in the delivery industry and set a strong example for others.

Nantong is a prime example of the rapid growth in coffee culture among China’s second- and third-tier cities. The close collaboration between Dada and Luckin, along with other leading chains, supports this trend and contributes to the growth of China’s local coffee delivery market.

Tu’s accolade serves not only as a personal achievement but also as a validation of the collaborative efforts between Dada Now and Luckin Coffee. Looking ahead, the two companies are committed to furthering their partnership, aiming to introduce innovative solutions in the instant delivery sector and provide even more efficient and convenient services to customers.

Why are waiting lists for luxury watches getting even longer?

“We have a shortage and there is very little chance to get one without a long waiting time,” said Julien Tornare, the president and chief executive officer of LVMH-owned Zenith.

Customers seeking to buy Zenith brand watch models – including the popular Chronomaster Sport and Defy Skyline – are now having to join waiting lists as sales for the Swiss brand surge.

The Zenith models join brands like Rolex, Audemars Piguet and Patek Philippe with watches where demand outstrips supply. The manufacturer has revived interest in the brand thanks to newer releases like the Chronomaster Sport and retro pieces including the Chronomaster Original, featuring tricoloured subdials.

Zenith watch sales are also rising overall, Tornare said, with sales in the first seven months of the year up about 45 per cent compared with last year’s record performance, which was the highest since the storied Swiss brand was acquired by LVMH in 1999.

“It’s very positive in an environment which is still not perfect,” Tornare said, referring to continued disruptions in China because of Covid-19 lockdowns and concerns of weakening economies in the US and Europe.

The Chronomaster Sport, a chronograph powered by Zenith’s El Primero movement, sells for about US$11,300 and is the company’s top selling watch model.

The Defy Skyline, another El Primero calibre-powered model, retails for about US$8,700. It was launched earlier this year, taking design cues like the octagonal case from the original watch first introduced in the 1960s.

Analysts at Morgan Stanley and LuxeConsult estimate that Zenith, based in the Swiss town of Le Locle, had sales of about US$116 million in 2021. LVMH does not disclose sales for its individual watch brands, which also include Tag Heuer and Hublot.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9993322491645813}",neutral,0.9993322491645813,0

Jay-Z Reveals Reasoning Behind Why He Sold Half Of His Champagne Brand To LVMH: 'You Can Own 100 Percent ... - Yahoo News,"Mon, 18 Jul 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vbmV3cy55YWhvby5jb20vamF5LXotcmV2ZWFscy1yZWFzb25pbmctYmVoaW5kLTE3NDcxMjc5Ny5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Reaching the greatest of all time (GOAT) status is no easy feat. In basketball, many argue that Michael Jordan is the GOAT. Serena Williams can be seen as the GOAT of tennis, but when it comes to this music thing, specifically Hip-Hop — many would suggest that Jay-Z holds the title.

Since “Reasonable Doubt” in 1996, Shawn Carter has given the world several top hits that pushed his superstar status through the roof. The New York native has been able to leverage all of his success and become a significant investor and businessman. However, his perspective about ownership might be shocking.

It's All About Perspective

In a recent interview with Kevin Hart on his show, “Hart to Heart,” the comedian discussed various topics with the mogul, ranging from music to business. Plus, at one point, the “99 Problems” rapper gave us insight into his mindset when it comes to ownership.

Referencing Steve Jobs, the rapper mentioned that the previous CEO only had about a one percent stake in the company at the time of his death. Many people would view this as minimal, but compared to the company’s value, it was worth a ton. Now, it seems Jay-Z has taken on a similar perspective.

“We’ve been trained to look at the percentage of something you own … It ain’t what you own; you can own 100 percent of nothing,” he explained.

To break it down, he mentioned his partnership with LVMH and how that group helped push his champagne business forward.

“I owned a 100 percent. I could’ve said, ‘I want to own a 100 percent of this thing,’ or I could own 50 percent of it and … push it even further,” Hov further explained.

Based on the interview, the father of three seemingly makes decisions based on what’s suitable for specific situations. And in all that, he ensures he is creating wealth and a legacy to pass down to his children.

The Ownership Of Creativity

Also in the conversation, Jay-Z offered a nuanced perspective on ownership — his creativity. Kevin Hart asked how he approaches being attached to someone else’s work.

“It’s mostly relationships,” Jay-Z responded. “It’s mostly — it’s actually always been mostly relationships. Sometimes it’s talent and sometimes someone asks me to be on some.”

Going forward, the business will be operated under the historical Île de Beauté (Иль де Ботэ) brand, the name of the retail network that Sephora acquired in 2016, after having bought a minority stake in 2008.

The operation is subject to clearance by relevant authorities, including anti-trust authorities.

Luxury Tycoon Bernard Arnault Locks In Family Ownership of Holding Company - WWD,"Thu, 21 Jul 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiQFodHRwczovL3d3ZC5jb20vYnVzaW5lc3MtbmV3cy9maW5hbmNpYWwvbHZtaC1jaGFpcm1hbi1jZW8tYmVybmFyZC1hcm5hdWx0LWxvY2tzLWluLWZhbWlseS1vd25lcnNoaXAtb2YtYWdhY2hlLWhvbGRpbmctY29tcGFueS0xMjM1MjU5MDE5L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS — Financière Agache, Bernard Arnault’s main holding company, said Thursday it plans to convert into a limited joint-stock partnership in a move designed to hand control of the entity to his five children.

Following the conversion, the control of Agache will be exercised by its general partner, Agache Commandité SAS, the share capital of which will be held equally between the children of the chairman and chief executive officer of LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton: Delphine Arnault, Antoine Arnault, Alexandre Arnault, Frédéric Arnault and Jean Arnault.

All of them work for LVMH and are in line to succeed their father as head of the group.

Agache is the controlling shareholder of Christian Dior SE and LVMH SE. The Arnault family group cumulatively controls 48 percent of LVMH’s capital and 63.5 percent of its voting rights, according to stock market regulator AMF. Meanwhile, it holds 97.5 percent of the capital of Christian Dior SE, which controls LVMH, and 98.4 percent of voting rights.

Bernard Arnault, 73, will be the first and only managing general partner of Agache. Thereafter, Agache Commandité SAS is due to be appointed as managing general partner, suggesting that responsibility for the family group will fall to the five children equally.

“This new structure will permit to perpetuate the family control over the long term and will permit a unified expression of the controlling shareholder’s voice regarding Christian Dior SE and LVMH SE,” Agache said in a statement published after the market close on Thursday.

Bernard Arnault said: “LVMH, a family-owned group, works to ensure the long-term development of each of its maisons while preserving their unique characters and their strengths. In this respect, the conversion of Agache into a limited joint-stock partnership (société en commandite par actions) announced today, which does not change its current shareholding, will ensure that its control over the LVMH group will be maintained over the long term.”

The new structure locks in ownership of the holding group’s shares. In a regulatory filing, the AMF said shares in Agache Commandité could not be sold or transferred for 30 years, unless decided unanimously by a five-person administration committee, which will consist initially of the five siblings.

At the end of this period, only descendants of Bernard Arnault or legal entities wholly owned by these descendants may hold shares, and any transfer of shares in Agache Commandité will be subject to a right of first refusal as set out in the shareholders’ agreement, the AMF specified.

Luxury rival Hermès International used a similar legal structure to protect itself against a creeping acquisition by LVMH. In 2011, the Court of Appeal in Paris handed Hermès a major victory by authorizing it to group family-owned shares into a non-listed holding company. In a court-brokered agreement, LVMH eventually agreed to distribute its Hermès stake to shareholders.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999949932098389}",neutral,0.9999949932098389,0

PARIS (Reuters) - French billionaire and LVMH chief Bernard Arnault has changed the legal structure of his family holding company Agache to a joint-stock partnership to ensure family control over LVMH in the long term, the company said on Thursday.

The change does not affect its current shareholding, Arnault said in a statement.

Under the new legal set-up, the family holding company will be controlled by Agache Commandite SAS, which will be held equally by Arnault's five children.

A filing with the French market authority showed that the Arnault family, through various legal entities, owns 47.99% of LVMH and has 63.5% of voting rights in the luxury group.

Arnault, 73, is CEO and chairman of LVMH and has not publicly named a successor for the sprawling luxury empire he built through acquisitions.

LVMH bylaws were changed at the annual shareholder meeting in April to raise the maximum age of its chief executive officer to 80 from 75.

All five children hold senior management positions at labels in the group.

The eldest, Delphine Arnault,47, and Antoine Arnault, 45, children from his first marriage, are also both on the group's board of directors.

Alexandre Arnault, 30, is an executive at Tiffany & Co. while Frederic Arnault, 27, is chief executive officer of TAG Heuer.

The youngest, Jean Arnault, 23, joined the group a year ago, directing marketing and development for Louis Vuitton's watches division.

Never heard of that term before? Neither had we, but we suppose it’s probably due to the fact that it only has three members.

Just three. Only three individuals in the world have a net worth north of US$100 billion. Let that sink in for a moment.

Arnault scraped in on Tuesday when LVMH’s stock jumped 2.9 per cent (€368.80 EUR), confirming his revised net worth of US$100.4 billion, roughly 3 per cent of France’s economy.

To no one’s surprise, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos is still the king of the castle with US$157.54 billion (his divorce settlement doesn’t come into effect until July), followed by Bill Gates, who’s not that far above Arnault himself, sitting on US$103.05 billion, according to Forbes‘ real-time billionaires list.

LVMH’s success this year has attributed to a wealth increase of $32 billion USD for Arnault this year alone.

His five children will have to have some patience, however, as the 73-year old billionaire is not going anywhere soon.

Who will be crown prince(ss)?

Arnault is setting up a new company above his family holding company, whose shares will be divided equally among his five children. However, there is a catch: the children, who are all active in the company, are not allowed to sell their share in the new partnership for thirty years, Reuters reports.

In this way, the world’s second richest man wants to avoid an outsider seizing power or a hostile takeover. Arnault hopes that in the coming decades at least one of his children will want to take over the torch from him. Although they all have leading positions, there is not yet a clear successor to the throne.

However, the succession problem will not arise immediately: for the time being, Arnault is still holding the reins. At the previous general meeting, he had already ensured that he could remain CEO until the age of 80. He will only have to step down as chairman of the board at the age of 75. Bernard Arnault owns 48 % of the listed company LVMH. The company promises that this shareholding will not change, but the new company only guarantees that “the family will retain control in the long term”.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999502897262573}",neutral,0.9999502897262573,0

Fashion industry collaboration to create lab-grown fur | Imperial News - Imperial College London,"Mon, 25 Jul 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmltcGVyaWFsLmFjLnVrL25ld3MvMjM4NTMxL2Zhc2hpb24taW5kdXN0cnktY29sbGFib3JhdGlvbi1jcmVhdGUtbGFiLWdyb3duL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Luxury fashion house Fendi, part of LVMH, wants a sustainable alternative to fur. Researchers from Imperial and Central Saint Martins are on the case.

Finding an integrative alternative to fur in the fashion industry means replicating the luxury qualities of the original material. If it feels fake, then it is a failure. Professor Tom Ellis in the Department of Bioengineering at Imperial thinks he has part of the answer: use genes from fur-producing animals such as fox and mink to grow substitute hair fibres in the laboratory.

This approach is now being put to the test in a two-year project with Central Saint Martins, part of the University of the Arts London, and luxury goods company LVMH, whose Fendi fashion house specialises in fur. “In the last decade, our understanding of biological materials and how they are made by nature has increased dramatically,” Professor Ellis explains. “It is now the perfect time to initiate the idea of designing fibres for fashion made sustainably from microbes.”

Fur under the microscope.

Professor Ellis and his group have a lot of experience growing different proteins in the laboratory. This is done by selecting the gene for the protein in question and patching it into a modified form of yeast, which then produces the protein as it grows in a bioreactor. The protein can then be extracted, purified and used according to its properties, for example as a medicine or a component in a material.

Keratin combinations

In the case of the fine hairs that make up fur, the protein of interest is keratin. The first challenge is that there are between 100 and 200 keratin genes in the typical mammal genome. “Keratin is incredibly abundant in animals,” says Professor Ellis. “It gets made into hair and nails, but it also forms structural components in every tissue and every cell. It’s the material that holds things up.”

Protein fibres can be grown from yeast cells in the lab.

Then you have to find not one but two kinds of keratin to give the desired effect. “The diversity in our hair, in our skin, and in our nails is down to different pairs of keratin. So, we will be testing a variety of different combinations of keratins, from the available genome sequences of typical fur-producing animals, to see which is the combination we need.

These pairs of keratins then need to be brought together in the bioreactor to form a basic animal hair. “Our aim within this pilot project is to make enough of the right keratins to have a self-assembly of a fibre that is an appropriate length for a fur-like material.”

Meanwhile, Professor Carole Collet at Central Saint Martins will be looking into how these fibres might be turned into fur, and how this new material might be received. “Learning from nature, and working at the intersection of design and biotechnology research, is key to the exploration of such future-facing innovation,” she says.

Regenerative luxury

Together with LVMH and Fendi, Professor Collet will look into the market-fit of a new kind of fur such as this, what designers would make of it, and how the public might react. The expectation is that it will be more luxurious than fake furs made from plastics, with better environmental credentials. This will be explored with a thorough life-cycle analysis of the new product.

LVMH and Central Saint Martins have been working together on this and other issues in “regenerative luxury” since 2017, through a collaboration called Maison/0. “Inventing new materials, new regenerative practices, and new technologies will enable our Maisons to achieve their climate and biodiversity ambitions,” explains Hélène Valade, Environmental Development Director of LVMH.

There is great potential for crossovers between the sort of deep science that Imperial is famous for and the creative industries. Professor Tom Ellis Department of Bioengineering

Professor Ellis is quick to credit Professor Collet with putting the fur project together. “The idea came from Central St Martins, and they made the match between Imperial and the fashion houses,” he says. “It’s incredibly exciting to begin this new collaboration with luxury leader LVMH and globally recognised fashion brand Fendi, and Professor Collet, a world-leading expert in biodesign.”

If this approach works, it need not stop at familiar luxury furs, such as fox and mink. “If you look at the genomes that have been sequenced, perhaps you might want lab-grown mohair or cashmere, or even a fur coat made from the woolly mammoth genome. These things could be possible: all you need to start is a DNA sequence on a database.”

There is a bright future for further collaborations between Imperial and the creative industries. ""The sort of deep science that Imperial is famous for is not normally seen working hand-in-hand with the creative industries, but we think there is great potential for crossovers between these areas,” Professor Ellis concludes. “We can influence and accelerate their innovation, and I'm sure they will be doing the same for us.""","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999920129776001}",neutral,0.9999920129776001,0

Restaurant Oro Reopens Under Executive Chef Riccardo Canella - Hospitality Net,"Mon, 25 Jul 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiOWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmhvc3BpdGFsaXR5bmV0Lm9yZy9hbm5vdW5jZW1lbnQvNDEwMDgyOTMuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Venice is set to welcome the reopening of the one Michelin-starred restaurant, Oro located within Cipriani, A Belmond Hotel, Venice tomorrow, Tuesday, July 26th. Situated on the stunning Giudecca Island, the hotel is only a short five-minute boat journey by complimentary shuttle from St. Mark's Square and can be easily accessed via a private boat from anywhere in Venice.

Executive Chef Riccardo Canella and his team are delighted to relaunch Oro, introducing their new menu celebrating Venice's produce and food culture. From the wealth of local seafood to exquisite artisanal produce from the surrounding regions, Oro offers an immersive Venetian dining experience. The elegant dining room, adorned with glass chandeliers from the island of Murano, overlooks the canal on the tranquil side of the city, where the bustle gives way to the views.

Taking the reins of the award-winning restaurant, Chef Riccardo reconnects with his ancestry, Veneto, Italy, after a period overseas. From traditional Italian three Michelin starred icons to cutting-edge Nordic innovation, his professional journey has covered some of the world's greatest restaurants and food cities. Venice, with its long history of artistic creativity, is the perfect setting for chef Riccardo Canella's cuisine.

Riccardo's enthusiasm for natural, seasonal, and often overlooked ingredients delivers a sense of familiarity and context to his menu. At the same time, his aim is to heighten the flavour of each ingredient in every dish, delivering his expression of Oro, of Venice, and one of the most desirable restaurants in La Serenissima.

Together with his team, they offer two seasonal eight-course tasting menus, showcasing hyper-local and regional producers. Dishes, while complex in their execution, appear simple and elegant in their presentation, with clarity of flavour heroing the ingredients that speak of this diverse city steeped in history. Expect dishes like Ossi di seppia raw cuttlefish (from the Adriatic sea) and rose oil, and a dessert made of Woodruff ice cream with oyster sorbet, blue cheese infused cream, and tarragon oil.

Local seafood is championed on the ""Divenire"" tasting menu, and the second menu is a vegetable-focused menu that is equally complex. Both features produce from the hotel's own fruit, vegetable, and herb garden.

The dishes mirror the beauty of the restaurant's location, with its panoramic views over the waters of the city's stunning lagoon.

The fish and seafood from the Adriatic Sea play a considerable part in the menu, and relationships with independent fishers have been forged. Chef Riccardo states: ""After searching for weeks, I finally found a fish buyer that only brings his fish to a few select markets - now we have his catch in Oro. The last time I had fish this good was in Japan! ""

The curated wine selection hosts more than 800 labels and an extension of additional local wines that sit alongside vintage champagnes. Oro also showcases vintages that have been chosen by Chateau d'Yquem as one of its 30 lighthouses around the world with an invitation to discover the wine by the glass, or simply as an aperitif with a view on the laguna.

LVMH sales jumped in the second quarter as the owner of Louis Vuitton bags and Dom Perignon Champagne continued to thrive despite lockdowns in China and soaring inflation.

Organic revenue in the French company’s key fashion and leather goods unit soared 19%, compared with estimates of a 17% rise, according to analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. In addition to Louis Vuitton, brands such as Fendi, Dior and Celine helped drive the uplift, the company said in a statement Tuesday.

The world’s largest seller of luxury goods followed Richemont and Burberry Group Plc in posting results that show the appetite for luxury goods remains even as prices increase, the global economic outlook deteriorates, and China continues to pursue its Covid-zero policy.

Consumers in the US and Europe have stepped up spending on luxury items as China remains subdued. LVMH’s update also demonstrates that well-heeled customers are not yet feeling the effects of a global surge in inflation that’s causing shoppers with smaller budgets to rein in spending at retailers such as Walmart Inc.

“We approach the second half of the year with confidence, but given the current geopolitical and health situation, we will remain vigilant,” chief executive officer Bernard Arnault said in the statement.

LVMH’s wines and spirits division, which has suffered some supply constraints in the past, bounced back with organic revenue jumping 30%, helped in particular by demand for Champagne in Europe, the US and Japan but also price increases for its Hennessy Cognac.

First-half profit from recurring operations rose to 10.24 billion euros ($10.35 billion). Analysts expected 9.51 billion euros.

Louis Vuitton, which was likely the biggest profit driver last year according to HSBC, maintained its profitability “at an exceptional level,” during the first half, the statement added.

It is Rosso himself who affirms this in an interview with the British newspaper ""Financial Times"", in which he recalls that ""Italy does not have a national luxury conglomerate like the French ones"". ""My plan is to create one,"" said Rosso, president of the holding Only The Brave (OTB). Rosso founded Diesel in 1978 at the age of 23, and has gone on to build a fashion business that employs 6 employees worldwide across seven brands. The entrepreneur is evaluating Otb's listing on the stock exchange and is availing itself of the advice of some banks. “Obviously our market capitalization will be different from that of the big French groups, but my ambition is to show that Italian brands can unite and strengthen each other,” said Rosso. “The closures in some areas of China have been of much greater concern to me than the war in Ukraine in terms of their impact on our business,” Rosso said.





Focusing on the war, Rosso downplayed its effects on his holding company. Russia and Ukraine account for around 2 percent of OTB's annual revenues, which grew to € 1,53 billion in 2021, compared to € 1,3 billion the previous year. The holding has no sales outlets in either country, while Asia is a key market for the group. Otb opened a branch in South Korea last year, and Japan alone accounts for 25 percent of its overall revenues. Rosso said one-third of the group's investments over the next three years will focus on expansion in China. Otb currently has 80 stores in the country, where it employs nearly a thousand people. The goal is to double the number of stores and staff by 2024.

Jay Chou's New Single Gives Boost to LVMH's La Samaritaine | - China Film Insider,"Mon, 11 Jul 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vY2hpbmFmaWxtaW5zaWRlci5jb20vamF5LWNob3VzLW5ldy1zaW5nbGUtZ2l2ZXMtYm9vc3QtdG8tbHZtaHMtbGEtc2FtYXJpdGFpbmUv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Jay Chou’s latest video, featuring La Samaritaine, has racked up over 90 million views. Will Chinese tourists now flock to the Paris department store?

What Happened: The King of Mandopop is back. After six years, Jay Chou is finally dropping a new album on July 15. Ahead of the release, the Taiwanese singer-songwriter shared a music video for his latest single on July 6 titled “Greatest Works of Art,” which includes visual and lyrical references to famous artists such as Salvador Dalí, Monet, Matisse, Munch, and Van Gogh. Interestingly, the video opens and closes with a shot of the artist performing at La Samaritaine, an LVMH-owned department store in Paris that reopened last June after 16 years of renovations.

The Jing Take: Living up to his moniker, the multi-hyphenated artist is famous for fusing Chinese and western music styles and has sold over 30 million records over the course of his career. In addition to gracing stages and music stations around Asia, he has also appeared in Hollywood movies such as The Green Hornet and Now You See Me 2, and served as the ambassador for Swiss luxury watchmaker Tudor. This new music video sees him back in the global spotlight, garnering over 109 million views on Weibo (plus 3 million on YouTube) within nine hours of being posted.

But Chou isn’t the only one who could receive a publicity boost. By highlighting La Samaritaine in the video and lyrics — “I’m playing a magical symphony, wandering in Samaritaine, renovated throughout the years” — the musician could bring greater brand awareness to the iconic Paris retail building. After all, this wouldn’t be the first time Chou has called attention to a travel destination: his 2020 single “Mojito,” which was filmed in Cuba, spurred a flurry of memes, tribute videos, articles, and mojito promotional deals, and even got a shout out from the Cuban Embassy in China in hope of attracting more Chinese tourists to the island.

Chief executive Daniel Lalonde recently said the Milan-based company, which is owned by private equity firms Investindustrial and Carlyle, could become the “LVMH of design”, nodding to his former employer that built the world’s biggest luxury empire by acquiring numerous European labels.

Design Holding, created as a joint venture in 2018 by its two private equity backers, already controls furniture and lighting brands such as Flos and Fendi Casa, which was part of the luxury fashion group.

Lalonde said the group wants to expand through more acquisitions and that there were plentiful opportunities given many high-end furniture and interior design companies are small or midsized.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9888848066329956}",neutral,0.9888848066329956,0
How Much It Costs To Stay At Cheval Blanc Paris - Preview,"Sun, 03 Jul 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiggFodHRwczovL3d3dy5wcmV2aWV3LnBoL2N1bHR1cmUvaW5zaWRlLWNoZXZhbC1ibGFuYy1wYXJpcy1sdm1oLXMtbmV3ZXN0LWx1eHVyeS1ob3RlbC1hMTk3MS0yMDIyMDcwMy1zcmMtZXNxdWlyZXBoP3JlZj1ob21lX2ZlZWRfMTg30gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"No one can do luxury quite like LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton. The global luxury conglomerate has been steadily expanding its portfolio over the years and recently launched its wildly successful, billion-dollar mall, La Samaritaine. The long-awaited department store opened its doors a few weeks ago and quickly became known as the most luxurious mall in the world housing LVMH’s countless brands. The mall itself is already a huge tourist attraction, but LVMH wants to solidify its presence in the first arrondissement with even grander ventures—a hotel.

Located right next to LVMH’s La Samaritaine is LVMH’s Cheval Blanc Paris, which just opened its doors. The ultra-luxury hotel matches the vibes of the designer stores next door as it costs €1,650 (approximately Php95,300) to stay just one night in Paris’ latest posh establishment. The 72-room hotel is the epitome of top-tier hospitality, featuring a 100-foot infinity pool in the lower levels and a 41-foot pool for the VIPs who book the top floor's 11,000 square foot penthouse. Other amenities of the hotel include four five-star restaurants led by some of Paris’ culinary masterminds, and a private hotel elevator leading to the luxury department store next door.

Unlike the growing contemporary trend of Parisian hotels, Cheval Blanc Paris stands by its quintessentially French tastes despite its modern touches. One reason for this is its purely French backers—LVMH and the Arnaults. While more and more hotels in the heart of France are run by the ultra-rich of China and the Middle East, Cheval Blanc Paris bleeds French, from its Parfums Christian Dior beauty amenities to the Tiffany & Co gems lining the windows.

Dripping in six-star luxury, Cheval Blanc Paris pays homage to the city’s ‘20s era with an Art Deco theme accompanied by the priceless art decorating common rooms and hallways.

Like La Samaritaine, Cheval Blanc Paris was decades in the making, with architect Peter Marino hiring almost 600 artisans to bring the building to life.

With all of its glamor, the best thing about Cheval Blanc Paris is something priceless altogether—its coveted location along the Seine that gives almost every room of the hotel a view that its competitors would die for. With the Seine on one side and the Louvre on the other, La Samaritaine and Cheval Blanc Paris are positioning themselves as the new center of luxury in Paris.

The beauty retailer's stores in Russia have been closed since early March, when LVMH and other luxury goods companies announced they were suspending operations in the country in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

LVMH said in March that it had a total of 124 stores and 3,500 employees in Russia.

Leading European luxury labels Burberry, Hermes, Cartier-owner Richemont, Kering and Chanel temporarily closed their stores in Russia after the Ukraine invasion, which prompted a wave of sanctions from the US and the European Union.

An In-Depth Analysis of LVMH & The Acquisition of Tiffany & Co.

Expansion into the jewelry sector – a fast-growing area of the luxury goods market!

Formed in 1987 after a merger between fashion house Louis Vuitton and wine and spirits company Moët Hennessy, LVMH has since become one of the two most valuable companies in Europe! Only to become rivaled by Swedish food giant Nestle!

LVMH now boasts a market capitalization of 414.19 billion Euros!

The French luxury conglomerate now consists of 75 independently-managed subsidiaries that fall under six branches: Wine & Spirits, Fashion & Leather Goods, Perfumes & Cosmetics, Watches & Jewelry, Selective Retailing, and Miscellaneous Activities.

Notable brands include, as the name suggests:

Moët & Chandon

Hennessy

Louis Vuitton

Christian Dior

Fenty

and now Tiffany & Co.

In 1989, Bernard Arnault acquired the largest stake in LVMH through an internal takeover that culminated in his ownership of 43.5% of LVMH stock and 35% of voting rights. As chairman and CEO, he has run the company under six central principles: decentralized organization, organic growth, vertical integration (i.e., owning entire supply and distribution chains), creation of synergies, sustained savoir-faire, and balance across business segments and geographies. These philosophies have guided the company to a prolific number of acquisitions over the past three decades, including Celine in 1996, Sephora in 1997, Fendi in 2001, and more recently, Fenty in 2019 and Tiffany & Co. in 2021.

In 2020, the luxury conglomerate earned €44.7 billion in revenue, employed 150,000 workers, and maintained over 5,000 stores across the globe despite the global pandemic. While the company did suffer a 17% fall in revenue (down from €53.7 billion in 2019) due to the effects of the pandemic on consumer spending, it maintained strong sales from fashion houses Louis Vuitton and Dior, as well as cognac-producer Hennessy.

These mainstays not only buoyed LVMH’s loss in revenue throughout 2020, but have also been essential to the conglomerate’s rebound in the first quarter of 2021.

In their mid-April press release, the company reported a revenue of €14 billion for Q1 2021, up 32% from the same period in 2020 and even up 8% from Q1 2019, indicating overall growth of the company rather than mere recovery. Although LVMH does not report revenues from individual houses, it reported record levels of sales from their Fashion & Leather Goods sector, especially in the US and Asia, where vaccine distribution is accessible and stores are reopening.

LVMH is notorious for its expansion of its vast network of luxury subsidiaries through mergers and acquisitions, and it dwarfs its competing conglomerates Richemont and Kering in terms of size. In investing in small modern brands and revitalizing older maisons, LVMH continues to grow its profits and expand its reach in the luxury sector. Two particularly notable examples include increased investment in Rihanna’s Fenty lines and LVMH’s recent acquisition of Tiffany & Co. during the pandemic.

Case Study of Rihanna’s Fenty

In 2017, Rihanna launched Fenty Beauty, a cosmetic line developed with LVMH through its subsidiary Kendo, a beauty incubator that creates and acquires beauty brands and develops them into international powerhouses. Her mission in creating Fenty was to introduce more diverse offerings “so that people everywhere would be included” in the beauty industry; the industry has long struggled to provide an inclusive range of foundation shades that caters to people of color, especially those of darker skin tones.

Upon the product launch of Fenty Beauty’s Pro Filt’r Soft Matte Longwear Foundation, Fenty Beauty offered 40 different shades, for all skin tones and types, and has since expanded their range to 50 shades. Additionally, all Fenty Beauty products were sold at midpoint prices (between drug-store and designer price points) both in-store at Sephora’s and online at Fenty Beauty’s website, making Rihanna’s products accessible to a wide audience. In addition, in its first 40 days, Fenty made $100 million in sales. Moreover, in 2020, Fenty Beauty generated an estimated revenue of $570 million.

In 2018, after the success of Fenty Beauty. Furthermore, Rihanna proceeded to launch her lingerie line Savage x Fenty, which followed the same philosophy as its predecessor and sought to make intimates more accessible to all body types.

This marked a departure from the decades-long industry norm defined by powerhouse Victoria’s Secret, where “beauty” was synonymous with “white and thin.” Rihanna’s subversion of this norm through inclusive size offerings and marketing toward women of all races rapidly increased her market share. As of 2021, Savage x Fenty has reached a valuation of $1 billion and posted revenue growth of over 200%. It also increased its VIP membership base by more than 150% in the past year.

“The brand strikes a unique balance between affordability, fashion and comfort, stands deeply for inclusivity and diversity, and has differentiated itself by building an extraordinary level of affinity and unmatched customer loyalty,” says Jon Owsley, co-managing partner of L Catterton’s growth fund. Savage x Fenty is favored to be the global lingerie market leader by 2025.

In 2019, Rihanna continued to expand her Fenty empire, announcing her partnership with LVMH to launch her luxury fashion label Fenty.

The new maison offered ready-to-wear clothing, handbags, and other accessories. LVMH provided Fenty access to its global supply chains, expertise in luxury retail, and investment funds, banking on Rihanna’s celebrity status and previous record of success for a monumental break into the high fashion industry. However, Fenty’s sales failed to take off and only further slowed during the pandemic. Consequently, LVMH and Rihanna came to the joint decision of indefinitely hitting pause on the new fashion house. LVMH pledged continued support for Rihanna’s existing Fenty lines, including her Fenty Skin venture that launched in 2020. In a joint statement to WWD, LVMH and Rihanna “reaffirmed their ambition to concentrate on the growth and the long-term development of [the] Fenty ecosystem focusing on cosmetics, skincare, and lingerie.”

LVMH’s investment in Rihanna’s Fenty lines marked a shift toward modernity through the embracing of not only modern social values (e.g., diversity and inclusion in sizing, access, and marketing) but also the power of celebrity. The accessibility of Rihanna’s products through both skin and body range and price point, in conjunction with her significance in pop culture (most downloaded recording artist of all time, according to the Recording Industry Association of America) and her presence on social media (100 million followers on Instagram and 102.4 million on Twitter), have been the main drivers behind her commercial success. In short, as W magazine puts it, “[Rihanna] has made an empire out of putting an emphasis on making sure that any person of all genders and body types can feel confident…”, and has converted her loyal musical fan base into a large consumer base for her Fenty products.

Case Study of Tiffany & Co.

In the fourth quarter of 2019, media outlets broke the news that LVMH had approached luxury jeweler and specialty retailer Tiffany & Co. with a takeover offer, with a starting bid price of $120 per share (i.e. valuing Tiffany at approximately $14.5 billion, 14 times the target’s projected earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization). Analysts attributed this to the conglomerate’s desire to expand into the global jewelry market; according to Bain & Co., the market expanded 7% in 2018, establishing itself as the fastest-growing industry in the luxury sector.

Tiffany appeared to be an ideal purchase, as the house has few competitors at its caliber (only Richemont-owned Cartier and LVMH-owned Bulgari) and runs their own diamond-finishing facilities (aligning with Mr. Arnault’s philosophy of vertical integration). Furthermore, LVMH noted that buying an American company would expand their presence not only in the US, giving the French conglomerate increased exposure to US dollar-denominated revenue and decreased foreign exchange risk, but also in China, where Tiffany has been planning to build additional flagships.

Prior to the acquisition, Tiffany & Co. boasted 300 store locations worldwide and an annual revenue of approximately $4 billion. However, when the jeweler started experiencing stagnating sales that fell behind its European competitors, LVMH saw an opportunity to acquire the company.

Arnault is known for acquiring older houses with established heritage and revitalizing them by capitalizing on modern interpretations of brand classics, as seen through his acquisitions of Dior and Louis Vuitton.

It was expected that Tiffany would receive similar treatment, as the brand not only champions the classic Tiffany Blue color, but is also built into modern pop culture via Breakfast at Tiffany’s, starring fashion icon Audrey Hepburn.

Later in the fourth quarter of 2019, LVMH and Tiffany & Co. settled on an asking price of $135 per share, valuing the deal at $16.2 billion–a 12% increase from the initial offer and 16.3 times the target’s projected earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. It was announced that the conglomerate would pay all cash for Tiffany’s shares and finance the deal through bonds. LVMH announced their confidence in the future potential of their pending acquisition; it promised to provide liquidity to launch new product lines, upgrade existing boutiques, and market to younger audiences (especially through its wide range of prices, from a few hundred for sterling silver pieces and up to millions for fine jewelry). Mr. Arnault also signaled that he would invest more heavily in Tiffany’s high-end jewelry offerings (such as its high-carat diamond necklaces) and work to launch new product lines to modernize the brand.

However, the unprecedented pandemic caused a large drop in consumer spending in the luxury-goods market.

With restrictions on travel, tourist shoppers (the lifeblood of the luxury industry) could no longer purchase in-store at Tiffany flagships and boutiques. According to Oppenheimer & Co., foreign spending accounts for over 20% of Tiffany’s sales. Additionally, 94% of Tiffany’s sales are made in-store. Consequently, depressed foreign demand and temporary store closures resulted in a 37% fall in worldwide sales in the second quarter. In June 2020, LVMH began expressing doubts about their impending acquisition of Tiffany, as many once attractive aspects of the company had been whittled away by pandemic-induced circumstances.

More specifically, the conglomerate had wanted to capitalize on its expertise in European in-store retail and its relationship with European landlords to grow Tiffany’s presence in Europe, where tourist shopping accounts for about 50% of luxury sales. Travel restrictions and public health safety concerns could serve as a long-term hindrance to sales growth. RBC analysts estimated that Mr. Arnault had not expected the Tiffany deal to make a return on his investment until 2025, but the pandemic would only lengthen this timeline even further.

In addition, amidst the pandemic, LVMH found it especially difficult to cut costs due to their commitment to the business model of vertical integration (where they produce their goods in-house and operate the boutiques that sell their fashion and leather goods, cosmetic products, and watches and jewelry).

Thus, while other companies were able to cancel orders from their third-party manufacturers in anticipation of depressed demand, LVMH had to absorb the costs of their own paused supply chains and closed distributors.

As a result, in the first half of 2020, LVMH’s profits plunged 84% while revenue declined by 27% compared to the same period in 2019. This strained LVMH’s finances, and in conjunction with Tiffany’s performance during the pandemic, led the conglomerate to reconsider their upcoming purchasing and to find ways out of their acquisition contract with Tiffany. The terms of the original agreement dictated that Tiffany could pay a termination fee of $575 million to abandon the deal. However, LVMH did not have an exit option written in the deal.

The conglomerate took three different exit routes in order to invalidate the deal.

In September of 2020, LVMH’s chief financial officer Jean Jacques Guiony announced that the French government had sent the conglomerate an unsolicited, valid and legally binding order to hold off on closing the Tiffany deal until January 2021, due to a brewing trade dispute between the Trump administration and France over tariffs on luxury goods. This ordered delay would violate the terms of the deal, which set the closure deadline to November 2020. If an agreement could not be reached by then, the deal would be void. Mr. Guiony claimed that LVMH had “no other choice but to apply this decision,” but Tiffany Chairman Roger Farah responded that “LVMH [was seeking] to use any available means in an attempt to avoid closing the transaction on the agreed terms” and that there was “no basis under French law for the Foreign Affairs Minister to order a company to breach a valid and binding agreement.” To ensure enforcement of the merger, or at least payment of damages in the case that LVMH walked out on the deal, Tiffany filed a lawsuit against LVMH in Delaware Chancery Court, which historically sided with companies who were being bought out in merger and acquisition cases. It was later leaked that LVMH had approached the French government for assistance to back out of the Tiffany deal, invalidating LVMH’s claim that the letter they had received from the French foreign affairs minister was unsolicited. This led the conglomerate to resort to two alternative methods.

LVMH countersued, arguing that Tiffany had suffered a material adverse event (MAE), which under the merger agreement, would have allowed the conglomerate to walk away from a deal before closing. Although the merger contract had never explicitly stipulated that a pandemic was a material adverse event, LVMH claimed that the coronavirus crisis was considered a change in circumstances that significantly reduced the value of the company, and would continue to in the long-run due to the secondary effects of the pandemic (e.g., shift toward e-commerce and reduced travel). However, their argument was weakened by the fact that a MAE cannot be called upon if the event or economic downturn impacts an industry as a whole, rather than a specific company. LVMH overall faced long odds, as the Delaware court had historically only allowed one previous buyer to back out of a merger under the argument of a MAE.

The luxury conglomerate also claimed that the merger was invalidated due to Tiffany’s mismanagement of the firm during the pandemic, filing in a complaint that Tiffany “[was] a mismanaged business that over the first half of 2020 hemorrhaged cash for the first time in a quarter century, with no end to its problems in sight.” More specifically, LVMH cited Tiffany’s decision to cut capital and marketing investments, take on additional debt, and most notably, pay shareholders full dividends during the pandemic despite a 37% plunge in sales and a loss of $32.7 million through the first half of 2020 (although sales did improve and the company earned profits in the second quarter). However, the conglomerate found it hard to prove that the company had been underperforming relative to other jewelers in the luxury sector, as LVMH’s own sales in their watches & jewelry division dropped 39% in the first half of 2020 versus the same time period last year. Additionally, data collected from online traffic and social media analytics showed that Tiffany had outperformed LVMH’s Bulgari during the summer months. Tiffany’s Mr. Farah said “LVMH’s specious arguments are yet another blatant attempt to evade its contractual obligation to pay the agreed-upon price for Tiffany.”

In October 2020, Tiffany agreed to new terms set by LVMH to purchase shares at $131.50 apiece (down from the original $135, a modest 2.6% cut), saving the conglomerate approximately $440 million and settling their ongoing litigation set for Delaware court in January 2021.

LVMH Chief Executive Bernard Arnault put out a statement in support of the ongoing merger, announcing that “We are as convinced as ever of the formidable potential of the Tiffany brand and believe that LVMH is the right home for Tiffany and its employees during this exciting next chapter.” In buying Tiffany, the French conglomerate advanced itself against their Swiss competitor Richemont, who owns watchmaker and jeweler Cartier.

In December 2020, Tiffany shareholders signed off their approval on the new deal terms, establishing LVMH’s purchase of Tiffany as the largest and most expensive acquisition in the luxury market, at a sticker price of $15.8 billion. The deal closed within the first seven days of January and LVMH moved to replace top executives at Tiffany, with Louis Vuitton executive vice president Anthony Ledru returning to Tiffany as chief executive (he had previously been head of Tiffany’s North American operations before joining LVMH), Michael Burke taking on the role of Tiffany chairman alongside his current position as CEO of Louis Vuitton, and Alexandre Arnault departing his role as CEO of Rimowa to serve as executive vice president of product and communications.

Over the course of 2021, Tiffany has expanded its marketing strategies as well as released new product lines.

On April Fools Day, the brand subverted tradition. With an announcement on social media that Tiffany had changed its brand color! From its classic Tiffany blue to yellow! And proceeded to capitalize on the social media buzz that ensued! To open up a Tiffany Yellow pop-up shop in Los Angeles. The American jeweler has also modernized its marketing strategies. With new house ambassadors, most notably Anya Taylor Joy (who shot to fame after her acclaimed role in Netflix’s The Queen’s Gambit) and ROSÉ (a member of K-pop group BLACKPINK). These choices reflect Tiffany’s attempts to appeal to a younger consumer base, specifically in the US and Asia.

In May of 2021, Tiffany also launched new product line Charles Tiffany Setting. A collection of engagement rings for men, amid the increase in same-sex marriage and the growing popularity of gender-fluid fashion. Given LVMH’s record of taking jewelry brands upmarket. (As seen by Bulgari, who witnessed a tripling in their operating margin from 8% to 25% after being bought out by the conglomerate). There is no doubt that Tiffany will experience similar success under the watchful eye of Mr. Arnault.

Further Analysis into LVMH’s Fashion and Leather Goods Sector

The transition of the fashion industry in the past 75 years from independently-owned maisons with unique brand identities. To massive luxury conglomerates who own said maisons has revolutionized the commercial workings of the industry. While LVMH does make strong efforts to maintain individual brand values and heritage. The luxury conglomerate’s first and foremost priority in the modern world is profit. Their fashion houses must produce clothing that sells in high volumes. Thus placing more importance in commercial success rather than artistic endeavor.

The conglomerate recognizes that to optimize volume. Its individual houses must cater to a broad range of customers while staying true to their origins.

Powerhouses Louis Vuitton and Dior have fused logomania with both their brand classics. And new streetwear items to grow their revenue in the past few years. In 2017, Louis Vuitton menswear-designer Kim Jones made the monumental decision. To collaborate with streetwear-brand Supreme. Citing that “you can’t have the conversation of New York menswear without Supreme right now. Because it’s such a massive global phenomenon”.

The decision to fuse these two logo-heavy brands to appeal to the streetwear consumer base. Created a bridge between streetwear and high fashion, introducing more mainstream consumers into the luxury market. LVMH capitalized on this migration. Through its controversial decision to hire Virgil Abloh. Founder and creative director of streetwear-brand Off-White. Another brand that relied on hype and logomania to generate sales. As a menswear-designer for Louis-Vuitton.

This move attracted these new streetwear-turned-luxury consumers to Louis Vuitton and began to lay the foundations for brand loyalty.

Virgil’s initial work at the brand made heavy use of the easily-recognizable LV monogram. And damier checkerboard patterns on the maison’s leather good accessories. E.g., bags, belts, and other small leather goods. Leading to strong sales to the new consumer base and putting the house in competition with Gucci. For hypebeast- and streetwear-focused customers.

Both of these brands have become mainstream through their popularization in pop culture, particularly through the rap industry.

Dior under the creative direction of Maria Grazia Chiuri has experienced a similar blockbuster success. Her re-revival the 2001 Oblique monogram pattern. Designed by Marc Bohan and reinvigorated by John Galliano. Has led to brand best-sellers. Most notably Dior bags (e.g., the classic saddle bag and the relatively-new book tote) and streetwear-inspired high-top canvas sneakers. LVMH has also replaced former Givenchy creative director Claire Waight Keller. With streetwear-designer Matthew Williams to revamp the brand to incorporate streetwear elements in their designs. Overall, the use of logos in both old brand classics. And new streetwear-inspired products have opened the luxury market to everyday consumers. In addition, boosted LVMH subsidiary sales to record high volumes.

On the other end of the spectrum. LVMH’s Celine and Loewe offer a selection of timeless and minimalist clothing. That emphasizes quality through tailoring and fabrics to attract more discreet luxury buyers. Celine gained a cult following during Phoebe Philo’s tenure as creative director between 2008 and 2018. As she was heralded for creating clothes for women under the female gaze. Her designs catered to wealthy and professional women who wanted to buy understated clothing of exceptional quality. When Ms. Philo left the brand in 2018. Her successor Hedi Slimane re-invented the brand with his own aesthetics. Which have been apparent in his work at Saint Laurent and Dior. Choosing to create designs inspired by bourgeois French femininity.

Today, the brand continues to carry high-quality basics that are made to last.

And to the joy of Phoebe Philo fans. She is slated to return to the fashion world in the coming months. Announcing in July 2021 that she is launching an eponymous label with the support of LVMH. Who retains a minority stake in the business). Similarly, Loewe fixates on craftsmanship and modernity–the brand aims to produce clothing that stays modern due to its timeless nature. Led by creative director Jonathan Anderson. Recipient of both the 2015 Menswear and Womenswear Designer of the Year awards by the British Fashion Awards. The house continues to find new technologies and revolutionary ideas that innovate their craft.

While these minimalist brands may not receive as much media attention as Louis Vuitton and Dior. They also retain their positions as commercial successes under the LVMH fashion and leather goods sector.

Although the logo-dependent and minimalist ready-to-wear business models are commercially successful ones that rely on high volume. The tradeoff is the loss of designer brands’ artistic exploration. And exclusivity–the very essence that motivates people’s fascination with the fashion industry. However, a few fashion houses have maintained intimacy with their customers through their haute couture collections. In which designers create custom-fitted clothing for only their top clientele. These pieces are made from high-quality, expensive, and even unusual fabrics. And are handcrafted by the artisans (i.e. embroiderers, weavers, jewelers, pleaters, etc.) in ateliers.

Given the time and effort expended in the creation of these pieces. Haute couture epitomizes supreme technical mastery and virtuoso execution. And comes at a high price tag that makes it only affordable to a small proportion of luxury consumers. The customers that are able to afford fashion houses’ couture pieces. Maintain strong relationships with the brands’ corresponding creative directors. In addition, testifies to the continued existence of personalization and intimacy between brands and their clients.

LVMH maintains the art of haute-couture through maisons Dior and Givenchy. And is currently in the process of reviving Fendi couture under the direction of newly appointed creative director Kim Jones.

Looking forward, it is logical to wonder which brand will be the next capstone of LVMH. After the commercial successes of Louis Vuitton and Dior.

If following historic trends. It is easy to eliminate the possibility of a newly launched luxury fashion and leather goods house. When considering Fenty’s failure to take off.

However, the revival of a maison that they already own or may acquire in the future has potential. Given the formula of commercial success that has been derived from previous profitable brands. This formula requires a fashion house with has existing traditions and heritage. Iconic brand classics that can be reinterpreted in a modern context, and a logo monogram print that will sell well. Since few maisons remain independent. Chanel, Hermes, and Goyard to name a few. And even fewer are up for sale or susceptible to a takeover. The house will most likely be found in LVMH’s existing portfolio of fashion and leather goods houses.

Following the pre-established formula for success, the conglomerate’s next big bet seems to be the maison Fendi. All of the elements are there: Fendi has a history of expertise in crafting fur and leather goods. A history that can become used to revive the maison. A brand classic in the form of the Fendi Baguette bag (popularized in the ‘90s by its appearance on Sarah Jessica Parker as Carrie Bradshaw in Sex and the City). And the iconic Fendi Zucca logo created by the esteemed Karl Lagerfeld. Fendi also clinched 9th place on the Q2 2020 Lyst Index. Which tracks online search data and social media engagement to rank fashion’s best-selling brands and products on a quarterly basis. With the appointment of Kim Jones and the revival of its couture line. The brand should become one of the largest commercial successes within the fashion industry.

Future Outlook of LVMH’s Expansion

Over the past decade. The fashion industry has also been reckoning with the ever-growing influence of Eastern consumers in the luxury sector. LVMH’s next biggest challenge is to compete with rivals Richemont and Kering for customers in Asia. European luxury conglomerates are betting most heavily on sales growth in China. As the nation’s booming economy has spurred Chinese consumers’ rapid income growth. And thus transformed the country into the home of the fastest growing market for luxury goods in the world. According to Bain & Co., the luxury goods market in mainland China achieved 48% growth in 2020. Doubling China’s share in the global luxury market. Growth is expected to continue into 2025. As a result, fashion houses have been scrambling to expand their marketing strategies to advertise to their Asian consumer base. Two notable methods include putting fashion shows on tour to China and signing on Asian brand ambassadors.

LVMH Stock Analysis : An Analysis of LVMH : Behind European Luxury

LVMH’s expansion into China through fashion shows dates back to as early as 2007. When Chinese consumers only accounted for about 2% of global consumption of luxury goods.

Mr. Arnault’s foresight on the future of China’s importance in the luxury market. Resulted in Fendi’s then creative director Karl Lagerfeld showing his monumental 2008 Spring-Summer collection at the Great Wall of China. Mr. Burke, then CEO of Fendi. Revealed later in an interview that Fendi “wanted to do something when the city was still in its transformative state. When it’s like a moth turning into a butterfly,” referencing China’s pending emergence as an economic power.

More recently, Louis Vuitton showed their 2021 Menswear Spring-Summer collections in Shanghai. While Dior presented their disco-themed 2021 Pre-Fall show in Shanghai as well. Due to the pandemic’s long-lasting effect of reduced travel. And reduced capacity in-person shows, LVMH has moved toward the digitization of their shows. With Louis Vuitton distributing their 2022 Menswear Spring-Summer collection in image, live-stream. And short video formats through prominent Chinese digital platforms Wechat and Weibo.

According to Morgan Stanley, the show broke records with over 130 million livestream views; the hashtag #LVMenSS22 gathered 520 million views within 24 hours, marking huge engagement growth for the brand in China.

LVMH Stock Analysis

To further market their brands to an Asian consumer base. Prominent fashion houses have also announced a flurry of partnerships with Asian brand ambassadors. Louis Vuitton has picked up both Chinese and Korean celebrities. Most notably Chinese rapper Kris Wu in 2018, as well as internationally acclaimed K-pop group BTS in 2020. Their appearances at red carpet events, ad campaigns. And fashion shows while donned in Louis Vuitton garments have gained not only media spotlight. But also the attention of their fans worldwide. Dior has also signed on K-pop group BLACKPINK’s Jisoo. As an ambassador for both their fashion and beauty lines in 2021. It would not come as a surprise if LVMH’s subsidiaries continue to sign on new Asian representatives. And to host more fashion shows in China. In order to further grow their customer base and compete for a larger market share in the luxury goods sector.

Conclusion : LVMH Stock Analysis

LVMH’s constant expansion through mergers and acquisitions. As seen by the case studies of Fenty and Tiffany and Co. Growth of its existing houses. In addition, global marketing strategies will continue to grow the reach of the luxury conglomerate on a worldwide scale. Especially in the Asian market. Its ongoing work in digitizing the fashion industry through its partnership with Google Cloud. Will only further revolutionize the consumer’s shopping experience and merits further analysis in a later article. At the end of the day, LVMH epitomizes luxury and remains true to its mission: “A family-run group. LVMH strives to ensure the long-term development of each of its Houses. In keeping with their identity, their heritage and their expertise.”
