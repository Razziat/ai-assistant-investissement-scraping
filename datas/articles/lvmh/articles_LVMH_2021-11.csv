What the Death of Virgil Abloh Means for LVMH & the Luxury Industry - Jing Daily,"Mon, 29 Nov 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vamluZ2RhaWx5LmNvbS9wb3N0cy92aXJnaWwtYWJsb2gtbHZtaC1sdXh1cnktaW5kdXN0cnktbGVnYWN50gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"In many interviews, Abloh stated that he is designing for his former 17-year-old self. By doing so, he created some of the most relevant pieces for Generation Z.

Bernard Arnault and Michael Burke understood that to extend the leadership of Louis Vuitton and connect it with Gen Zers, it had to hire a personality like Abloh, who could translate the brand's historic codes into today's styles.

While most designers would be more than happy to work for Louis Vuitton, Abloh’s ambitions were much larger, and he saw opportunities that others did not.

When the announcement of the death of Virgil Abloh at 41 from a rare and aggressive form of cancer came out, the luxury and fashion world was shocked. Celebrities, fashion designers, musicians, and friends gave their condolences. Kayne West, Marc Jacobs, Pharrell Williams, BTS, Lenny Kravitz, and Hailey Bieber all gave emotional statements. Gigi Hadid wrote , “He was 1 of 1,” and Kourtney Kardashian posted, “you changed the world.” The chairman and chief executive officer of LVMH, Bernard Arnault, wrote in a statement , “We are all shocked after this terrible news. Virgil was not only a genius designer, a visionary, he was also a man with a beautiful soul and great wisdom.”

These statements show what Virgil Abloh meant to the luxury and fashion industry, not just as a highly acclaimed creative and designer but also as a person. It is safe to say that he was the most influential creative director of the last decade, redefining much of the codes and expressions of luxury.

The story of Abloh’s ascent to the top of the world’s number one luxury brand, Louis Vuitton, from an internship with Kayne West at Fendi has become the stuff of legends. That was where Michael Burke, then the CEO of the fashion brand and now the CEO of Louis Vuitton, discovered his talent early. But Abloh was also instrumental in the career of Kayne West as the creative director of West’s Donda creative agency, and he founded Off-White — the disruptive and highly-influential brand that made luxury streetwear fashionable and created new visual codes for an entire generation.

In many interviews, Abloh stated that he is designing for his former 17-year-old self. By doing so, he created some of the most relevant pieces for Generation Z, positioning Off-White as a trailblazer for this critical consumer group that so many traditional luxury brands are unable to reach. When LVMH appointed Abloh as artistic director for Louis Vuitton’s men’s collection, he was the first black designer at the top of a global luxury brand. He was an American from Illinois whose family was from Ghana, and he defined the presence and future of the symbol of French luxury.

Bernard Arnault and Michael Burke understood that to extend the leadership of Louis Vuitton and connect it with Gen Zers, they had to hire a personality like Abloh, who could translate the brand's historic codes into today's styles. While many brands have failed to transition to a new generation, Louis Vuitton fired from all cylinders once Abloh joined. His collections became acclaimed, and Louis Vuitton was soon one of the most inspiring and influential luxury brands out there. It wasn't afraid to take risks, reinvent icons like its classic trunks, or launch entirely new categories like earphones or loudspeakers.

While most designers would be more than happy to work for Louis Vuitton, Abloh’s ambitions were much larger, and he saw opportunities that others did not. Designers like Abloh, who can translate a traditional luxury to a FOMO-inducing must-have without sacrificing the fundamentals of the brand, are extremely rare. Combining an understanding of the brand, the consumers, and the zeitgeist with disruptive elements the world has not yet seen, is indeed an exceptional talent. As such, “1 of 1” is a precise description of how unique Abloh was in the fashion industry. That was confirmed by the larger role LVMH created for him, tapping Abloh to oversee the artistic development of all 75 of the company's Maisons.

His are enormous shoes that will be hard to fill. As the luxury world transitions into a fluidity between digital and physical experiences, streetwear and formal wear, and functional and inspirational objects of desire, Abloh's exceptional talent will be difficult to replace.

Whoever follows Abloh can learn from how he excelled in understanding what Gen Z wants, taking bold risks, and innovating without losing the brand's fundamental DNA. Abloh played to win, which is a lesson for the luxury industry at large — make your mark and be relevant and inspiring. Thank you, Virgil Abloh. You were an inspiration who wrote history. You will be missed.

SMX and LVMH Métiers d'Art collaboratively enable complete traceability of origin for its raw materials. - PR Newswire,"Sun, 14 Nov 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMingFodHRwczovL3d3dy5wcm5ld3N3aXJlLmNvbS9uZXdzLXJlbGVhc2VzL3NteC1hbmQtbHZtaC1tZXRpZXJzLWRhcnQtY29sbGFib3JhdGl2ZWx5LWVuYWJsZS1jb21wbGV0ZS10cmFjZWFiaWxpdHktb2Ytb3JpZ2luLWZvci1pdHMtcmF3LW1hdGVyaWFscy0zMDE0MjMxNjkuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"MELBOURNE, Australia, Nov. 14, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- Security Matters (https://smx.tech/home) (ASX: SMX) (""SMX"" and ""the Company"") a next-generation brand protection and authentication service provider announces a new collaboration with LVMH Métiers d'Art on a series of R&D projects aimed at improving traceability for raw materials in the luxury fashion industry.

Clothes hanger / closet in the woods / forest. Concept for organic clothes, eco-friendly, ecological fashion.

SMX offers an attractive technological solution due to its easy drop in solution, that consists of a marking technology that can permanently and irrevocably mark any kind of material, whether it be a solid, liquid or gas. And with the same integrated digital reader, the user is able to read the embedded data across all the different types of materials and products in real time without any need for extensive lab tests.

The unique and ground-breaking technology allows for the complete tracing of products to verify ESG ethical sources, enable efficient sorting of materials for waste and provide full transparency of the value chain from source through the manufacturing processes, to retail and recycle/reuse.

Successful completion of the joint projects will enable complete traceability of origin and subsequently lay the foundations for a tangible and measurable transition to the sustainable circular economy in-depth knowledge of the supply chain for LVMH Métiers d'Art. The first of its kind project is expected to be completed in early 2022.

Commenting on the partnership, CEO and Founder of SMX, Haggai Alon, said, ""Companies are increasingly championing a new vision to epitomize the leadership role it plays in society and the impact of its operations and products on the environment. Major luxury & lifestyle brands are actively transitioning from a linear to a circular business model.

Creating a closed-loop, sustainable supply chain for the luxury fashion industry

An estimated 92 million tons of textile waste is produced each year by the fashion industry, a figure that's expected to rise 60 per cent by 2030.

In December 2020, SMX launched the Fashion Sustainability Competence Centre to help slow this trend and enable brands to become more efficient and environmentally friendly.

By using SMX's marking technology and digital blockchain platform, fashion brands can efficiently sort, reclaim and reuse raw materials in unwanted or discarded products. Effectively reducing the number of virgin materials required, the amount they send to landfills and their carbon emissions to deliver on the ESG expectations of their consumers and stakeholders.

""With SMX's white label B2B offerings, luxury brands can shape the future of the industry by creating desire inducing narratives that connect tangible sustainable ESG practices with their transparent traceability strategy to create a profitable lifetime relationship with their customers - that is circular rather than linear or transactional. We are helping to craft tomorrow's sustainable luxury with SMX's innovative technology."" Alon concluded.

Virgil Abloh's Legacy Will Be Seen in Future Generations - WWD,"Tue, 30 Nov 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijgFodHRwczovL3d3ZC5jb20vZmFzaGlvbi1uZXdzL2Zhc2hpb24tZmVhdHVyZXMvdmlyZ2lsLWFibG9ocy1sZWdhY3ktd2lsbC1iZS1zZWVuLWluLWZ1dHVyZS1nZW5lcmF0aW9ucy1hY2NvcmRpbmctdG8tbXVzZXVtLWN1cmF0b3JzLTEyMzUwMDQ5Mzcv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"While many designers see themselves as a multihyphenated talent, Virgil Abloh lived up to that mantle through his ambidextrous creativity and boundary-breaking pursuits.

The Off-White founder and Louis Vuitton’s artistic director for men’s wear, who died earlier this week at the age of 41, was a multidisciplinarian through and through. Art, architecture, music, industrial and automotive design, street life and other elements were infused in his seemingly nonstop pursuits, which extended beyond the realm of fashion. However straightforward some of his designs might have appeared to be, Abloh often delivered the subversive and, in doing so, upended an hierarchy that had been decades in the making. Along with Nike, Levi’s and Moncler, other powerhouse brands like Ikea and Mercedes-Benz enlisted Abloh to help envision a smattering of their next-level designs.

The rise of a Rockford, Ill.-born artist, architect and fashion designer inspired legions of other creatives and consumers to carve new roads to their definitions of success. By his own account, he first learned to fuse the fields of art, craft and design as a postgraduate student at the Illinois Institute of Technology, where he was introduced to a curriculum established by Mies van der Rohe that had sprung from the Bauhaus movement.

High-minded, but ironic and seemingly always in-on-the-joke, Abloh stoked the dualism of his work on his personal site. Visitors will find a breakout for “The Struggle of Polar Opposites,” including such pairings as “Suit vs. Tracksuit,” “Day Job vs. Night Job” and “Sport vs. Spectator.” Skilled at reiterating different designs and themes for new meanings, Abloh first broached the “Polar Opposites” concert through an Off-White x Nike Air Presto drop in 2019. More recently, he had taken a group of architectural and design students under his wing through a London-based studio that he set up.

Michael Darling, a former curator at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Chicago, first reached out to Abloh in 2016 about the prospect of working together. Intrigued by Off-White, his furniture design, Chicago upbringing and engineering and architectural background, Darling decided upon meeting him that they should do something significant. After debuting at MCA Chicago in 2019, “Virgil Abloh: Figures of Speech” has been shown at Atlanta’s High Museum of Art and the ICA Boston, and is now on view at The Firehouse in Qatar until April. Next summer, it will bow at the Brooklyn Museum.

By the time that the show opened in Chicago in 2019, Abloh had morphed into a household name and the turnout reflected that. Following Abloh’s death, Darling said he has been thinking a lot about the designer’s legacy. “So much of what he’s done has happened quite quickly and before our eyes. The impact of it is still unknown. So many young people who he has impacted are just getting started; we haven’t seen the full impact of his influence yet.”

In addition to encouraging the younger generations to not feel bound by genres or certain ways of doing things, Abloh has also encouraged young designers of color to go out and chase their dreams, Darling said. Whether lending a hand or offering contacts, the designer helped them. Recognizing the influence of Abloh’s work with Kanye West’s Donda group, as well as Matthew Williams (now at Givenchy), Heron Preston and Samuel Ross (now of A-Cold-Wall), Darling said, “there was the incredible group of people, who were all working together and tormenting this new wave of creativity in the early 2010s that is still totally under recognized.”

Too young and too generous to be thinking about his legacy, Abloh wasn’t an egomaniac but was someone “who was always thinking about the broader culture and his generation of creatives, and wanting that whole group to succeed and leave their mark,” he added. Although he always made time for his family and a bevy of projects, Abloh was always all-in, when’re he was working. “He always questioned any path forward to make sure it was the best or most interesting or exciting one. He usually had multiple projects in his head at one time. As you were walking down regarding street with him, he would be texting, Instagramming and seeing things that he was making notes of. He was just constantlyprocessing that way, which was pretty amazing to witness,” Darling said, who is now Museum Exchange’s chief growth officer.

Andrew Bolton, the Wendy Yu curator in charge at the Metropolitan Museum of Art’s Costume Institute, said Monday, “Virgil both appreciated and explored the power of fashion as language, employing linguistic tropes such as irony and metaphor as cultural commentary. Placing fashion at the very center of contemporaneity, he was a semiotician of our times, encoding clothes with meaning and purpose. His singularity and magnanimity will be greatly missed.”

The Brooklyn Museum’s senior curator of fashion and material culture Matthew Yokobosky said news of Abloh’s passing prompted such images as “the prismatic carpet that he created for his first Louis Vuitton men’s wear collection that was walked by an international cast of models, thereby staging the vocabulary of gay pride and inclusivity into one of the most anticipated, photographic events of recent years, and transmitting a seriously new perspective at the house.”

He was also reminded of an Off-White leather bag emblazoned with the word “sculpture,” which prompted viewers to consider what is art, what is fashion and is a handbag sculpture. Yokobosky also recalled the industrial hazard striping used as a brand/collection signifier for Off-White that Abloh chose to blur and explore the black-and-white lines that society has created through fashion — a challenge to the status quo. Also fond of Off-White’s precursor brand name Pyrex Vision, the curator asked, “Can anything be more clear and precise? While Virgil was asking us to question and reason through his designs or ‘makes,’ he was being very clear and purpose-driven about the visual ‘awareness’ journey that he wanted to take us on.”

Another admirer of Pyrex Vision was the Museum of Modern Art’s senior curator of architecture and design and director of research and development, Paola Antonelli. Instead of tagging items like a graffiti artist as he had in the past, Abloh “blossomed” at Louis Vuitton, where he was “innovating the essence of the objects and using different typologies for the garments and rethinking them from scratch with new forms and configurations,” she said. Using a leather harness or belt across the chest or shoulder that was reminiscent of Geoffrey Beene, for example, was a very elegant way to give a completely new turn to a suit without losing its essence, she said. “It’s a moment, where fashion is experimenting so much, especially men’s fashion, which is not even gendered any more. He really gave it a push in that direction.”

Abloh’s long-range legacy “will be the abundance of young people, who have been introduced to a world that they didn’t think was theirs, and they will just feel comfortable in it,” Antonelli said. “We will remember the objects, the branding and the logos. But he always opened my heart, because he was always like the Pied Piper with all these kids following him all the time…his most important legacy will be the inspiration that he has given so many kids all over the world and of all different backgrounds and especially kids of color.”

His ability to always design for his 17-year-old self was a point of distinction and a gift that gave him “a different way to be attuned to reality,” she said.

Valerie Steele, director of the Museum at the Fashion Institute of Technology, recalled Monday visiting the exhibition in 2019 with a group of other museum directors. Seeing clothes included in the show “just on a rack” rather than on a mannequin or on a pedestal with a light shining on it, raised the question of “‘This is how you’re showing them in an art gallery?’ But he was showing them in conjunction with other kinds of art projects. He was looking at it all like an art project,” Steele said. “In that way, he was very much like Andy Warhol or Jeff Koons — someone who is doing things that [make] some people go, ‘That’s not art’ or, ‘Oh well, it seems like it’s art.’ I’m an artist. I’m doing it. In that way, it’s very interesting conceptually.”

As was the case with a Haruki Murakami exhibition, the exhibition had a shocking element — the show had racks of clothes, and the gift shop did too for purchase, Steele said.

She expects his lasting impact to be twofold: “One, as a Black person who became super important in the international luxury fashion industry at a very high level as influential and given quite a free range to go across different parts of the LVMH empire. That fits into the second aspect of why I think he is important — his disruptive ability to break down what seemed like barriers between different areas of culture and visual culture.”

As someone, who was interested in fashion from a young age, Abloh wasn’t interested in just fashion, but also art, music, skateboarding, luxury and streetwear, said Steele, noting that he was breaking down the distinctions between some of these things. “I’ve spent years thinking about, ‘How can you look at fashion in connection with art?’ He was there as a maker [considering] ‘Are there distinctions? What would they be? What kind of a maker am I?’”

In the same way, Abloh argued how streetwear could be just like designer fashion or luxury fashion, Steele said. “The lines between those categories are getting blurrier and blurrier. That disruptive quality is something that we only see quite rarely in an art form. We saw it when Bob Dylan started playing an electric guitar, when all of the fogeys started to get freaked out,” Steele said.

Shai Baitel, inaugural artist director of the Modern Art Museum Shanghai, expects Abloh’s legacy to be not only the first designer who dared “blending and mixing elements from the street that relate not only to imagery, but mainly for energy, for the vibe and for the entire rich culture that otherwise never would have been part of such a luxurious brand.”

Abloh grasped that there is no design without art, Baitel said. “Any design — fashion, product, cars, architecture — there would never have been any of those [categories] if it wasn’t for art. Art came first. What Virgil did so brilliantly was to allow these things to mix so seamlessly and be integrated into a sophisticated brand like LVMH that is hundreds of years old. It had been consumed by the elitist of the elite. Now everybody can say, ‘I have an LV as well,’ whereas it’s not just the same as canvas. It’s an incredible achievement. He never compromised the original DNA. And DNA, like any DNA is an evolution.”

In addition, Abloh will be remembered for taking Louis Vuitton to new audiences. Baitel spoke of the importance “to understand the consumption of product or a brand that stands for certain ideology or values, as well as the way that we consume content that is not necessarily tangible. Everything that is too excluding and too snobbish was no longer welcome. Every brand needs to think not just about the present, but mainly about the future. You could see how such a brilliant creative director such as Virgil and others immediately had their interpretations of how this and future generations look into products and brands and luxury. Even if it is a little less exclusive, it speaks loudly to allowing everybody to be part of it.”"

"Star designer Virgil Abloh dies at 41 after a private battle with cancer, LVMH says - CNBC","Sun, 28 Nov 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tLzIwMjEvMTEvMjgvc3Rhci1kZXNpZ25lci12aXJnaWwtYWJsb2gtZGllcy1hdC00MS1hZnRlci1wcml2YXRlLWJhdHRsZS13aXRoLWNhbmNlci1sdm1oLXNheXMuaHRtbNIBeWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tL2FtcC8yMDIxLzExLzI4L3N0YXItZGVzaWduZXItdmlyZ2lsLWFibG9oLWRpZXMtYXQtNDEtYWZ0ZXItcHJpdmF0ZS1iYXR0bGUtd2l0aC1jYW5jZXItbHZtaC1zYXlzLmh0bWw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Virgil Abloh, a leading designer whose groundbreaking fusions of streetwear and high couture made him one of the most celebrated tastemakers in fashion and beyond, has died of cancer. He was 41.

Abloh's death was announced Sunday by the luxury group LVMH (Louis Vuitton Moët Hennessy) and Abloh's own Off-White label, which he founded in 2013. Abloh was the artistic director for Louis Vuitton's menswear, but his ubiquitous, consumer-friendly presence in culture was wide-ranging and dynamic. Some compared him to Jeff Koons. Others hailed him as his generation's Karl Lagerfeld.

""We are all shocked after this terrible news. Virgil was not only a genius designer, a visionary, he was also a man with a beautiful soul and great wisdom,"" Bernard Arnault, chairman and chief executive of LVMH, said in a statement.

A statement from Abloh's family on the designer's Instagram account said Abloh was diagnosed two years ago with cardiac angiosarcoma, a rare form of cancer in which a tumor occurs in the heart.

""He chose to endure his battle privately since his diagnosis in 2019, undergoing numerous challenging treatments, all while helming several significant institutions that span fashion, art, and culture,"" the statement read.

In 2018, Abloh became the first Black artistic director of men's wear at Louis Vuitton in the French design house's storied history. A first generation Ghanaian American whose seamstress mother taught him to sew, Abloh had no formal fashion training but had a degree in engineering and a master's in architecture.

Abloh, who grew up in Rockford, Illinois, outside of Chicago, was often referred to as a Renaissance man in the fashion world. He moonlighted as a DJ. But in a short time, he emerged as one of fashion's most heralded designers. Abloh called himself ""a maker."" He was named one of Time magazine's most influential people in 2018.

In 2009, Abloh met Kanye West — now called Ye — while he was working at a screen-printing store. After he and Ye interned together at the LVMH brand Fendi, Abloh was Ye's creative director. Abloh was art director for the 2011 Ye-Jay-Z album ""Watch the Throne,"" for which Abloh was nominated for a Grammy.

Abloh's work with West served as a blueprint for future border-crossing collaborations that married high and low. With Nike, he partnered his Off-White label for a line of frenzy-inducing sneakers remixed with a variety of styles and Helvetica fonts. Abloh also designed furniture for IKEA, refillable bottles for Evian and Big Mac cartons for McDonald's. His work was exhibited at the Louvre, the Gagosian and the Museum of Contemporary Art Chicago.

Abloh's death stunned the entertainment world. Actor Riz Ahmed said on Twitter that Abloh ""stretched culture and changed the game."" Fashion designer Jeff Staple wrote, ""You taught us all how to dream."" Pharrell Williams called Abloh ""a kind, generous, thoughtful creative genius.""

Abloh took what he called a ""3% approach"" to fashion — that a new design could be created by changing an original by 3%. Critics said Abloh was more brilliant at repackaging than creating something new. But Abloh's style was also self-aware — quotation marks were a trademark label for him — and high-minded.

""Streetwear in my mind is linked to Duchamp,"" Abloh told the New Yorker in 2019. ""It's this idea of the readymade. I'm talking Lower East Side, New York. It's like hip-hop. It's sampling. I take James Brown, I chop it up, I make a new song.""

Stars lined up to be dressed by Abloh. Beyoncé, Michael B. Jordan, Kim Kardashian West, Timothée Chalamet and Serena Williams have worn his clothes.

Abloh's Off-White label, which LVMH acquired a majority stake in earlier this year, made him an arbiter of cool. But his appointment at Louis Vuitton brought Abloh to the apex of an industry he was once a scrappy outsider in — and made Abloh one of the most powerful Black executives in a historically closed fashion world.

As Abloh prepared for his debut menswear show in 2018, he told GQ, ""I now have a platform to change the industry.""

""We're designers, so we can start a trend, we can highlight issues, we can make a lot of people focus on something or we can cause a lot of people to focus on ourselves,"" Abloh said. ""I'm not interested in (the latter). I'm interested in using my platform as one of a very small group of African-American males to design a house, to sort of show people in a poetic way.""

Abloh is survived by his wife Shannon Abloh and his children, Lowe and Grey."
"LVMH Names Stéphane Bianchi President Of Watch, Jewelry Division - JCK","Fri, 05 Nov 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmpja29ubGluZS5jb20vZWRpdG9yaWFsLWFydGljbGUvbHZtaC1iaWFuY2hpLXByZXNpZGVudC13YXRjaC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Stéphane Bianchi (pictured) has been appointed president of LVMH’s watch and jewelry division, so he will now oversee not only the company’s watch brands but also retailers such as Bulgari and Chaumet, the luxury giant announced.

Bianchi will also become a member of LVMH executive committee, the company said.

In 2018, Bianchi was tasked with heading LVMH’s watch division, as well as directly lead TAG Heuer. The watch division consists of TAG Heuer, Zenith, and Hublot.

in addition to the watch business, Bianchi has lately taken jewelry brands Fred and Chaumet under his wing. This new reshuffle adds Bulgari to the mix.

Tiffany & Co., its latest—and largest—jewelry acquisition, will continue to be managed outside the jewelry and watches division, the announcement said.

Jean-Christophe Babin, CEO of Bulgari since 2013, will now report to Bianchi, instead of LVMH’s top management, as in the past.

The announcement said that putting Bulgari in Babin’s portfolio “is a key step which rounds up his responsibilities. It [is] also a rationalization of the group’s organization, bringing watch and jewelry activities under a single point of leadership. Each Maison will continue to be managed individually to perpetuate its differentiation. We will frame their focus within a total hard luxury strategy, and enhance sharing of knowledge and resources for faster progress.”

Prior to coming to LVMH, Bianchi spent most of his career at Yves Rocher Group, the beauty and cosmetics company. Beginning as head of business development and CEO of its Brazil unit, he served as the group’s CEO from 1998 to 2015. Before that, he was a consultant for Arthur Andersen.

“I am very happy to welcome Stéphane as a member of the executive committee, and see our watches and jewelry activities come together under his leadership,” said LVMH chairman and CEO Bernard Arnault in the statement.

The news was first reported in WWD.

According to the report, executives are mulling over plans for a store in Sanya’s Haitang Bay shopping centre and a partnership with its state-owned operator, China Duty Free Group — one of the many beneficiaries of the country’s post-pandemic domestic tourism boom and the world’s largest travel retailer. A link-up would allow LVMH to tap directly into the mainland’s burgeoning travel retail opportunity, and marks a U-turn for the Louis Vuitton brand, which is known for avoiding mark-downs. At present, shoppers in Hainan can only find beauty and fragrance offerings from LVMH’s top brands.

Louis Vuitton confirmed it is looking at opportunities in Hainan, but denied it was considering any options in the licensed duty free market. China Duty Free Group did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

"Strong quarters by LVMH, Hermès and Kering buoy global luxury | Marketing - Campaign Asia","Thu, 11 Nov 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNhbXBhaWduYXNpYS5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS9zdHJvbmctcXVhcnRlcnMtYnktbHZtaC1oZXJtZXMtYW5kLWtlcmluZy1idW95LWdsb2JhbC1sdXh1cnkvNDczOTEy0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Third-quarter results for LVMH, Gucci’s parent Kering, and Hermès were a confidence boost for the global luxury business. Growth continued, yet, in some cases, at a slower rate than earlier in the year. But this was expected since some retail reopenings happened over the same quarter in 2020, making for a tricky comparison.

Hermès

The smallest of the companies, Hermès, delivered consolidated revenue of $2.7 billion (€2.37 billion), up 31% year-on-year (at constant exchange rates) but below the 57% rise recorded over the first nine months of 2021. In Q3, the brand saw an upturn in European sales (40%) and acceleration in the Americas (48%), while Asia stayed consistent at 29%. Nevertheless, all geographical areas (led by Asia-Pacific) posted strong double-digit growth during the period, compared to pre-pandemic 2019.

Hermès described Greater China’s performance as “remarkable,” as it is maintaining momentum with new and revamped boutiques. The brand just opened a second store in Shenzhen (pushing its China total to 28) on the Mainland, and it unveiled its newly renovated flagship at Plaza 66 in Shanghai last week on October 29.

In a statement, the executive chairman of Hermès, Axel Dumas, said: “In a world that remains unstable, the balance between our sixteen métiers and between our locations around the world, allows us to move forward with optimism and caution.”

Year-to-date, Hermès stock is up 60% and 18% over the past month.

LVMH

The world’s biggest luxury group, LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, generated a growth of 11% in the third quarter versus the same period in 2019, with revenue rising to $18 billion (€15.5 billion).

The Fashion & Leather Goods business group accounted for almost half of those sales at $8.6 billion (€7.45 billion), up 38% from Q3 2019. The division almost single-handedly drove the majority of LVMH’s 11% growth over those two years.

By geography, Asia remained vibrant, growing by 26% versus 2019 while the US pushed forwards with 22%. Japan was sluggish and is still contracting (by 6% in the quarter). Meanwhile, Europe’s double-digit declines became single-digit (down 6%), suggesting a swing to positive territory could be coming as retail conditions normalize.

DFS continued to be a drag on LVMH’s second-biggest division, Selective Retailing. The business group was the only one of five to show a contraction in Q3 at a hefty 19% versus 2019. LVMH singled out travel retailer DFS for “revenue still lower than 2019,” blamed on the lack of international travelers, the Chinese, in particular. Meanwhile, Sephora showed strong momentum while the recently opened DFS-operated Samaritaine in Paris is expected to bear fruit in the coming years.

Year-to-date, LVMH stock is up 34% and nine% in the past month.

Kering

Gucci-led Kering Group generated total sales of $4.8 billion (€4.19 billion) in Q3, up 10% (at comparable rates) over the same period in 2019. Almost $2.5 billion (€2.2 billion) of the total came from Gucci, which had lackluster growth of just two% over 2019. While just one-third the size of Gucci, the St Laurent brand did much better, growing by 37% versus 2019 as brand awareness and market penetration increased quickly, most notably in the Asia Pacific.

Revenue from all Kering’s directly-operated luxury stores, including e-commerce, grew by 11% relative to Q3 2019. In addition to Gucci and St Laurent, those houses include Alexander McQueen, Balenciaga, and Bottega Veneta, which all saw strong momentum in North America.

Kering, which is going fur-free beginning with its Fall 2022 collections for all brands, noted that Western Europe and Japan are still being affected by the absence of tourists, but sales continued to improve there. Meanwhile, after solid growth in the first half of the year in the Asia-Pacific, sales “were held back by rising COVID-19 case numbers during the summer,” though they remained above 2019 levels. Online’s pace was particularly strong—up 148% versus Q3 2019.

Kering chairman and CEO François-Henri Pinault praised Saint Laurent, Bottega Veneta, and the group’s other luxury houses, as well as Kering Eyewear for their “outstanding performances” in Q3. On Gucci, he said the brand would face “an intense fourth quarter.”

Year-to-date, Kering stock is up 17% and up to five% in the past month."
Benefit Cosmetics is upping its global DTC checkout experience - Glossy,"Mon, 08 Nov 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmdsb3NzeS5jby9iZWF1dHkvYmVuZWZpdC1jb3NtZXRpY3MtaXMtdXBwaW5nLWl0cy1nbG9iYWwtZHRjLWNoZWNrb3V0LWdhbWUv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LVMH’s Benefit Cosmetics is revamping its checkout experience with a new partner.

Benefit Cosmetics announced on Tuesday that it has partnered with checkout and shopper network company Bolt for its U.S., U.K., France and Germany e-commerce sites. This marks U.S.-based Bolt’s foray into Europe as third-party checkout competition heats up. Benefit Cosmetics is the first LVMH brand to use a third-party checkout service, opening the possibility for more brands in the conglomerate to adopt the practice in the future. On Monday, Bolt also announced that it is partnering with Shopify competitor PrestaShop, allowing shoppers to check out in one step across PrestaShop sites in the U.S., U.K., France, Spain, Italy and Portugal.

Already active on these sites since October 14, the new checkout system requires users to register with Bolt in order to access one-click checkout on any site using the platform.

“Benefit has built and maintained our own checkout experience for years, but it’s super complex and there’s always so much to do. Our checkout roadmap was never-ending,” said Cindy Shen, vp of global e-commerce and CRM at Benefit Cosmetics. The brand decided to go with a third party “who could offer a seamless experience, preferred payment methods and a global footprint.”

Setting up checkout in Europe is typically more complex than in the U.S. market due to compliance with GDPR, 3D Secure to verify identity, and adjustments for language and currency.

“[It takes] a lot to launch a full, European-ready checkout,” said Ryan Breslow, founder and CEO of Bolt.

Higher conversion and lower cart abandonment are some of the biggest goals for brands hoping to optimize their checkout systems. Bolt claims its one-click checkout can reduce cart abandonment by 50%. According to Breslow, some of the biggest reasons for cart abandonment include being required to set up passwords or being prompted to register.

“Asking for users to save a password is high friction,” said Breslow. “The average site loses 70% of their customers at the last step of checkout. After they paid all this money and created ads for marketing brand awareness, to lose them in the last step is a tragedy.”

“It’s been a few weeks post-launch, and we’ve already seen significant gains in conversion across all our websites, with the biggest uplift from our U.S. website,” said Shen. In Europe, she said Benefit’s Germany site is seeing the strongest increases from the new checkout system, due to a more seamless PayPal and Klarna integration.

“Checkout is both an art and a science. There are so many intricate details and [a lot of] technical work that need to happen on the back end, but to a shopper, it just needs to be fast and easy,” said Shen.

Bolt is in talks with other LVMH brands, which would allow users to have one-click checkout across the LVMH portfolio.

“We’re having a lot of success with portfolio groups because their accounts are disparate,” said Breslow. The company also works with beauty brands including Milk Makeup, Bliss Beauty, Osmotics Skincare, SkinMedix, Rescue Spa and The Hair Factory. Bolt has 10 million users and announced $393 million in series D funding in October, giving it a valuation of $6 billion.

For premium and luxury brands, Bolt is differentiating itself with more freedom in checkout design than the standard Shopify checkout. According to Breslow, Bolt is “working with them on stylization options for checkout customization, and allowing our checkout to be designed to every brand’s own look and feel.” Brands under the LVMH umbrella are “obviously quite opinionated about design,” he said."
Designer Virgil Abloh dies at 41 - Vogue Business,"Mon, 29 Nov 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZvZ3VlYnVzaW5lc3MuY29tL2Zhc2hpb24vZGVzaWduZXItdmlyZ2lsLWFibG9oLWRpZXMtYXQtNDHSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"To receive the Vogue Business newsletter, sign up here.

Virgil Abloh, the artistic director of Louis Vuitton menswear, founder of streetwear brand Off-White and a true disruptor of fashion, has died of cancer aged 41.

“LVMH, Louis Vuitton and Off-White are devastated to announce the passing of Virgil Abloh, on Sunday, 28 November, of cancer, which he had been battling privately for several years,” LVMH posted on Instagram on Sunday night in Paris.

“We are all shocked after this terrible news. Virgil was not only a genius designer, a visionary, he was also a man with a beautiful soul and great wisdom. The LVMH family joins me in this moment of great sorrow, and we are all thinking of his loved ones after the passing of their husband, their father, their brother or their friend,” LVMH chairman and CEO Bernard Arnault said in a statement.

Abloh got his start in fashion in the aughts working alongside his friend Kanye West at Fendi, where the artist and musician functioned as interns, and each earned $500 per month, according to a person familiar with the arrangement. The person said they brought a new street energy to the brand while learning Italian tailoring techniques and exploring the European fashion manufacturing system. The job at the LVMH-owned brand introduced Abloh to executives at the luxury giant, building a relationship that would soon become fruitful for both.

Abloh later became known for defining a new era for luxury streetwear and unexpected collaborations by creating Off-White with New Guards Group in 2013, bringing a designer sensibility to streetwear. In March 2018, he took over the creative helm for Louis Vuitton menswear and in July 2021, LVMH acquired a majority stake in Off-White while deepening its relationship with Abloh to launch new brands and partner with existing ones in a variety of sectors beyond fashion.

In the first sign of his impact on the wider LVMH group, Kenzo tapped Japanese designer and DJ Nigo as artistic director of the house. Nigo and Abloh had collaborated on a capsule collection, LV².

“His influence as an American designer globally is untouchable. He believed in innovation and disruption and changed our industry for the better,” said Steven Kolb, chief executive of the CFDA. Ralph Toledano, president of the Fédération de la Haute Couture et de la Mode, described him as “a visionary fashion designer. But above all, he was an exceptional man through his humanity, his openness to others, his generosity of heart and his willingness to break down barriers.” In a joint statement, British Fashion Council's chair Stephanie Phair and chief executive Caroline Rush commented, “We are devastated to hear the passing of beloved Virgil Abloh. Virgil was a creative force of change, who throughout his career focused on inclusivity and philanthropy across fashion, art, music, design and architecture, making him one of the most influential designers of his generation."""
"Virgil Abloh, a Multi-Hyphenate Design Visionary, Dies at Age 41 - The Fashion Law","Sun, 28 Nov 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWZhc2hpb25sYXcuY29tL2Zhc2hpb24tc3RyZWV0d2Vhci12aXNpb25hcnktdmlyZ2lsLWFibG9oLWRpZXMtYXQtYWdlLTQxL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, Louis Vuitton, and Off-White announced the death of Off-White founder and Louis Vuitton menswear director this weekend, saying that they “are devastated to announce the passing of Virgil Abloh, on Sunday, November 28th, of cancer, which he had been battling privately for several years.” In a statement, LVMH chairman and CEO Bernard Arnault said, “We are all shocked after this terrible news. Virgil was not only a genius designer, a visionary, he was also a man with a beautiful soul and great wisdom. The LVMH family joins me in this moment of great sorrow.”

The news comes after LVMH announced in July that it was taking a majority stake in Off-White, the upscale streetwear brand that Virgil Abloh, a DJ-slash-designer, launched in 2013. In a statement at the time, Paris-based LVMH revealed that in addition to taking a 60 percent stake in Off-White, it has entered into a new “arrangement” with Abloh to “jointly pursue new projects across luxury categories.” The new partnership would “leverage the Group’s expertise to launch new brands and partner with existing ones in a variety of sectors beyond the realm of fashion,” with initial discussions already underway, according to the French luxury goods conglomerate.

Abloh has been widely recognized as helping to herald in a new approach to fashion and luxury, and as TFL previously asserted, it is impossible to deny the sheer force that has catapulted Off-White to the forefront of the minds of young, hip, fashion-focused consumers. Much has been made of Virgil Abloh in the press since he launched Off-White in 2014 after garnering fans with his (now-defunct) streetwear brand, Pyrex Vision.

A statement on Abloh’s own Instagram account read on Sunday, “For over two years, Virgil valiantly battled a rare, aggressive form of cancer, cardiac angiosarcoma. He chose to endure his battle privately since his diagnosis in 2019, undergoing numerous challenging treatments, all while helming several significant institutions that span fashion, art, and culture. Through it all, his work ethic, infinite curiosity, and optimism never wavered. Virgil was driven by his dedication to his craft and to his mission to open doors for others and create pathways for greater equality in art and design. He often said, ‘Everything I do is for the 17-year-old version of myself,’ believing deeply in the power of art to inspire future generations.”"
Fashion Steps Up Climate Commitments | BoF - The Business of Fashion,"Mon, 08 Nov 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzb2ZmYXNoaW9uLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy9zdXN0YWluYWJpbGl0eS9mYXNoaW9uLXN0ZXBzLXVwLWNsaW1hdGUtY29tbWl0bWVudHMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Fashion’s flagship climate initiative upgraded its ambitions Monday and added the world’s biggest maker of luxury goods in a major update to the industry’s climate ambitions announced at COP26.

The UN Fashion Industry Charter for Climate Action laid out new goals for its 130 signatories, aligning commitments with efforts to cap global warming at no more than 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels — an internationally agreed limit intended to stave off the worst effects of climate change.

LVMH, which has remained on the outside of fashion’s collective efforts to address environmental issues, also added its name to the list of participating companies. The owner of Louis Vuitton, Dior and other labels said it decided to join the initiative because of its links to the institution of the UN and focus on concrete issues that could address fashion’s climate impact. The company updated its own climate goals in the last year and appointed Stella McCartney, a founding signatory of the UN Fashion Charter, as a sustainability advisor in 2019 after taking a stake in her brand.

Under the updated charter, signatories must pledge to reach net-zero emissions by no later than 2050 and either halve their emissions by the end of the decade or set science-based targets within the next 24 months. The charter previously called on signatories to reduce emissions by 30 percent by 2030.

“It’s time to accelerate progress,” said Stefan Seidel, Puma’s head of corporate sustainability and chair of the Fashion Charter steering committee. “Now with the new ambition level, we’re all clear on where we need to go.”

The new commitments are part of a flurry of initiatives that have been announced at the UN climate summit taking place in Glasgow, Scotland. The two-week gathering of politicians, business leaders and environmental advocates is widely viewed as a critical moment to address the fact the world is currently well off track to keep global warming within the recommended parameters.

While fashion’s contribution to climate change is notoriously tricky to pin down, the industry is a significant polluter and has faced criticism for failing to match high-profile commitments with tangible action. Recent studies peg its contribution to greenhouse gas emissions at between two and 10 percent of the global total. Unchecked, fashion’s emissions are expected to grow more than 50 percent by 2030, according to estimates in a new report from the Apparel Impact Institute and World Resources Institute.

“We cannot ignore fashion and fashion cannot ignore its role here,” said UN Climate Change’s manager of global climate action Niclas Svenningsen at the launch of the Fashion Charter’s updated commitments Monday.

Alongside updated emissions reductions targets, signatories to the Charter have also committed to concrete steps like shifting all electricity in their own operations to renewable sources and phasing out coal from the supply chain by the end of the decade. Neither will be easy. Shifting the industry will be “tantamount to getting [a] supertanker to make a U-turn with skid marks on top of that,” said Svenningsen.

Critics say the updated targets still don’t go far enough, with environmental advocacy group Stand.Earth calling for fashion to make even stronger commitments to adopt renewable energy throughout the supply chain.

Signatories must submit action plans within the next 12 months detailing their pathway to achieve the Charter’s upgraded goals, with Monday’s announcement accompanied by a flurry of recommendations for further action.

Nonprofit Textile Exchange launched a call backed by more than 50 fashion and textile companies, requesting changes to trade policy that would encourage the use of so-called preferred materials, like organic cotton or recycled fibres. Backers pushing for incentives like lower tariffs and import duties for such materials include Gucci-owner Kering, Gap Inc. and H&M Group.

“We know that incentives change the market very quickly,” said Textile Exchange’s chief operating officer Claire Bergkamp. When it comes to adopting better materials, “price is the issue that comes up over and over again, and most of the options involve farmers getting paid less. This is a way to level costs without negatively affecting farmers.”

The industry will also have to grapple with one its trickiest challenges: decoupling production growth from profits. While around 60 percent of the industry’s required emissions reductions can be achieved through taking steps like eliminating coal from manufacturing and accelerating material innovations, consumption remains an elephant in the room, according to a report published Monday by the World Resources Institute and Apparel Impact Institute.

“It’s really hard to do this without addressing growing consumption,” said Michael Sadowski, one of the report’s authors.

That will also require fashion to address the way it markets its products, an area of growing interest for regulators concerned about greenwashing. The United Nations Environment Programme said it is working on a series of guidelines to publish next year.

Many brands have already announced renewed commitments around COP26, indicating increasing engagement with efforts to move beyond reducing impact to find ways of operating that can restore and reverse environmental damage through practices like regenerative farming.

“Being less bad is simply not good enough anymore,” said former Unilever chief executive and co-founder and chair of climate-focused business network Imagine, Paul Polman, speaking at the launch of the renewed Fashion Charter. “We need to move to an economy that is net positive, restorative and regenerative.”

Disclosure: LVMH is part of a group of investors who, together, hold a minority interest in The Business of Fashion. All investors have signed shareholders’ documentation guaranteeing BoF’s complete editorial independence.

Bernard Arnault

In just a few years, Virgil Abloh changed the landscape of the fashion world with his various creative jobs and numerous exclusive collaborations. Abloh founded his label Off-White in 2013, before presenting his first collections during Paris Fashion Week in 2015.

He was a multi-disciplinary creative - a DJ, architect, artist and designer - and was known for his exclusive capsule collections, made in collaboration with brands such as Nike, Jimmy Choo and Ikea. His very first show for the house Louis Vuitton was a historic moment. Abloh had succeeded in fusing his trademark streetwear style with the codes of the luxury industry."

He first came to global prominence in 2010 when Kanye West, with whom Abloh interned at Fendi the year prior, made him creative director of his creative agency Donda. In 2011, his art direction for West and JAY-Z's album Watch The Throne received a Grammy nomination. The following year, his line Pyrex Vision stirred acclaim, controversy, and undeniable influence with its $40 Polo shirts screen-printed and resold for $550.

In 2013, Abloh founded Off-White, the company that would solidify his growing prestige in the fashion world. Abloh was nominated for the LVMH Prize for Young Fashion Designers in 2015, the only American nominated that year, and Off-White storefronts around the world soon followed. 2018 saw Abloh named as artistic director at Louis Vuitton. ""I now have a platform to change the industry,"" Abloh, the first African American to hold the role, told GQ at the time. ""So I should.""

His career would be marked with dozens of collaborations with some of the biggest brands in the world, including Nike and Ikea, but Abloh never lost an intense enthusiasm for and engagement with the world of hip-hop. An avid DJ who played festivals around the world, Abloh would oversee the art direction for rap projects such as Kanye West's My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy and Yeezus, Lil Uzi Vert’s Luv Is Rage 2, and A$AP Rocky’s Long.Live.ASAP. He released his debut EP ORVNGE, a collaboration with Boys Noize, in 2018.

“I’m always ­trying to prove to my 17-year-old self that I can do creative things I thought weren’t possible,” Abloh told W Magazine in a 2017 profile. ""Everything I do references something that influenced me.”

Cheval Blanc Opens in Paris - Luxury Travel Advisor,"Thu, 11 Nov 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmx1eHVyeXRyYXZlbGFkdmlzb3IuY29tL2hvdGVscy9jaGV2YWwtYmxhbmMtb3BlbnMtcGFyaXPSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"La rentrée always brings a special energy to Paris. After a lengthy summer vacation, urbanites return to the city with renewed gusto — and an enormous appetite for the autumn’s packed cultural calendar and restaurant openings. But there’s a unique excitement this year as a dramatic COVID recovery coincides with great hope for the hospitality sector decimated by the pandemic. A symbol of this optimism is the hotly anticipated launch of the Cheval Blanc Paris on the Seine. Years in the making, the first Paris hotel for LVMH represents the rebirth of an entire neighborhood right in the heart of the city.

The legendary department store complex known as La Samaritaine, originally founded in 1870, had been closed in 2005 for safety concerns, effectively shuttering a swath of prime Paris real estate. After a no-holds-barred restoration, the newly reborn Samaritaine Paris Pont-Neuf was unveiled in June, with the Cheval Blanc following on September 7.

The setting couldn’t be more central. From this first arrondissement perch overlooking Pont Neuf, the city’s oldest bridge, all of Paris is at your doorstep — from the nearby Louvre museum and gourmet delights of the revitalized Les Halles district to the chic boutique shopping of the Marais and Saint-Germain-des-Prés.

The week of the opening brought warm summer temperatures to Paris. The hotel’s enormous glass windows reflected the blue skies; two Cheval Blanc flags on the rooftop fluttered in the breeze. Fully booked, the hotel also drew a fashionable crowd to its four restaurants to savor the Seine views along with the cuisine.

Inside the lobby, the luminosity is striking. Instead of standing at a reception desk, guests are seated and greeted as if in a connoisseur’s living room. Monumental artwork, like the blue canvas by artist Georges Mathieu, stands out against a warm gold and white palette. Beneath the painting, a bookcase showcases coffee-table books wrapped in colorful African prints.

This was the first hotel project for Peter Marino, arguably fashion’s favorite interior architect, and a partner of LVMH for decades. He approached the design in the scrupulous style of haute couture, selecting art, prized vintage décor alongside bespoke furniture and exquisite materials like Sophie Mallebranche’s finely woven metal fabric that decorates the grand staircase leading to the spa. This painstaking approach was also employed by architect Edouard François, who renovated the Art Deco building that’s classified a historic monument; he even reopened a closed quarry in order to source the exact stone used by architect Henri Sauvage in the original construction.

The Cheval Blanc Paris is a showcase of the LVMH universe down to the smallest details: The white horse sculpture by Frank Gehry in the lobby, the custom fragrance by perfume “nose” François Demachy diffused throughout the hotel, the staff uniforms by Patou’s artistic director Guillaume Henry, and the iconic Dior 999 lipstick, engraved with Paris images and sold as a limited edition item in the Dior spa.

With just 72 rooms, it’s a small hotel…but one with a big wow factor. Case in point: The elevator leading to the seventh floor restaurants. Completely dark as the doors close, suddenly a cinematic scene is illuminated as the elevator ascends, immersing you in a moving tableau of Paris in all its enigmatic beauty.

Step outside and into Le Tout-Paris, the contemporary brasserie, and the real Paris panorama stretches out below you. Not just on the terrace, but even the seats farthest from the windows have knock-out views (these booth-like alcoves are raised to a higher elevation). Here in this bright aerie, the colorful décor matches the energy of the crowd. Also situated on the seventh floor, Langosteria is the first international outpost for the popular Milan seafood restaurant. Top Tip: Request a seat on the west-facing terrace to watch the sunset (keeping in mind that sunset time changes dramatically throughout the year’s seasons). Note: There’s also a landscaped terrace on the seventh floor, called the “garden,” where you can sit and sip.

In a city celebrated for its Michelin stars, Cheval Blanc Paris is adding to the galaxy by tapping the talented Arnaud Donckele to oversee the gastronomic restaurant called Plénitude. The chef holds three Michelin stars at La Vague d’Or, the restaurant at Cheval Blanc St-Tropez, which he will continue to manage in season. (Insiders tell us that he even brings special produce with him from the south when he makes the commute.) Named “Chef of the Year” by Gault & Millau in 2020, Donckele prides himself on direct sourcing the finest ingredients from local producers in a network he’s taken years to develop. At Plénitude, he has concocted a menu based on fine sauces — infused, aged and perfected like a perfume over many months. Note: The restaurant is situated on the first floor, not the rooftop, because food is the focus here, not the views. Tip: Don’t miss the artistic wine vault featuring precious bottles like a Chateau Cheval Blanc 1945.

Pastry chef Maxime Frédéric has the reins at Limbar, the stylish ground-floor café that takes its name from the exotic wood lining its walls. The ambiance changes as the menu evolves throughout the day starting with fine baked goods at breakfast, continuing through lunch and the afternoon goûter (French-style teatime), where you can try one of the herbal infusions created from potted herbs on the bar, and concluding with after-dark soirées enhanced by cocktails by Florian Thireau.

Another feature that wows? The 100-foot spa swimming pool, decorated with a swirling mosaic by Michael Mayer that required a year of work. On the wall, photos by the artist Oyoram depict images of the Paris cityscape outside, the monuments and bridges placed in their exact geographic position. Even emerging from the spa, robe-wrapped clients — fully relaxed after treatments like the six-hand Couture Dream massage — can’t help but whip out their phones to snap a photo of this chef-d’œuvre. Speaking of the spa, the menu is so vast (43 treatments), reach out to Spa Director Sophie Levy Kraemer to help make your choice.

Margaux Médeau leads the concierge team; a member of clefs d’or, she is one of the rare women to hold this position in France. Her goal is to provide guests with exclusive access to parts of Paris that are off the beaten path, like the Sorbonne observatory, master artisans’ workshops and untouristed corners of Montmartre. She can also arrange private shopping with a stylist at Samaritaine and a trip to Champagne country by helicopter.

Booking Tips: Even the smallest guestroom is generously sized at 485 square feet, filled with light from large bay windows and equipped with a separate dressing room and marble bathroom with both tub and walk-in hammam shower. Note that some rooms have balconies, others overlook the Louvre or Notre-Dame, and for families or friends traveling together, a number of rooms interconnect.

The best room in the house is known as “L’appartement,” comprised of two penthouse duplexes on the eighth and ninth floors that can be combined into one massive suite measuring 10,780 square feet. Accessed by private entrance, L’appartement offers seven bedrooms, several lounges, a private pool, a wellness area, a projection room and a terrace with panoramic vistas. For VIP bookings, reach out to Director of Sales Céline Thillaye ([email protected]). Christian Boyens, formerly the general manager at the Ritz Paris, is the head of operations, Urban Hotels for LVMH Hotel Management.

Designer Virgil Abloh has died, much to the shock of the fashion and entertainment industries. According to a Twitter post from luxury goods company LVMH, the Off-White founder and artistic director of men’s wear at Louis Vuitton passed away on Sunday (November 28) following a private battle with cancer.

“LVMH, Louis Vuitton and Off White are devastated to announce the passing of Virgil Abloh, on Sunday, November 28th, of cancer, which he had been battling privately for several years,” the post reads. “‘We are all shocked after this terrible news. Virgil was not only a genius designer a visionary, he was also a man with a beautiful soul and great wisdom.

“The LVHM family joins me in this moment of great sorrow, and we are all thinking of his loved ones, after the passing of their husband, their father, the brother or their friend.'”

A trained architect, Abloh made his foray into international fashion with an internship at Fendi in 2009 alongside Kanye West. Their artistic collaboration ultimately led to founding Off-White. Just two years later, Abloh was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Recording Package for his work on JAY-Z and Kanye West’s celebrated Watch The Throne album.

In 2018, he became the first person of African descent to be named artistic director at a French luxury fashion house when Louis Vuitton put him in charge of men’s wear. He then earned the unique distinction of being named one of the 100 most influential people in the world by TIME magazine that same year. In 2019, Abloh was appointed to the board of directors of The Council of Fashion Designers of America.

But behind the scenes, he was apparently fighting a rare, aggressive form of cancer called cardiac angiosarcoma. Diagnosed in 2019, he chose to kept his health issues close to home, which his family explained in a separate Instagram post.

“We are devastated to announce the passing of our beloved Virgil Abloh, a fiercely devoted father, husband, son, brother, and friend,” the caption read. “He is survived by his loving wife Shannon Abloh, his children Lowe Abloh and Grey Abloh, his sister Edwina Abloh, his parents Nee and Eunice Abloh, and numerous dear friends and colleagues. For over two years, Virgil valiantly battled a rare, aggressive form of cancer, cardiac angiosarcoma. He chose to endure his battle privately since his diagnosis in 2019, undergoing numerous challenging treatments, all while helming several significant institutions that span fashion, art, and culture.

“Through it all, his work ethic, infinite curiosity, and optimism never wavered. Virgil was driven by his dedication to his craft and to his mission to open doors for others and create pathways for greater equality in art and design. He often said, ‘Everything I do is for the 17-year-old version of myself,’ believing deeply in the power of art to inspire future generations.

A director's tour of London's revamped Courtauld Gallery - Art Newspaper,"Fri, 19 Nov 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWFydG5ld3NwYXBlci5jb20vMjAyMS8xMS8xOS9hLWRpcmVjdG9ycy10b3VyLW9mLWxvbmRvbnMtcmV2YW1wZWQtY291cnRhdWxkLWdhbGxlcnnSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"London’s Courtauld Gallery is something of a hidden gem: a renowned art collection with masterpieces by Cézanne, Van Gogh, Monet and Gauguin, tucked away unobtrusively in a wing of Somerset House. Its neoclassical 18th-century building comprises a warren of spaces originally designed to house government offices and specialist societies including the Royal Academy of Arts.

The gallery reopens to the public on 19 November after the biggest renovation in its history, costing £57m and spanning three years of closure (extended slightly by the pandemic). The “real challenge” of the project by Witherford Watson Mann architects has been to unify the collection with the building's historic architecture, says the Courtauld Gallery’s director, Ernst Vegelin van Claerbergen. Many of the changes “by themselves weren’t necessarily so radical but cumulatively they have transformed the enjoyment of the building and the ability of the collection to sing”, he says.

That transformation “starts from the moment of arrival” with a remodelled entrance that enables step-free access directly to the front hall for the first time (wheelchair users previously had to come through a back entrance, “a very unsuitable way to welcome people”). The once-cramped ticketing desk has moved into what used to be the early Renaissance and Medieval gallery. A new staircase to the expanded basement visitor facilities replaces the awkwardly steep and narrow “servants’ stair round the back”. Before the redesign, Vegelin admits, “many never found their way down there”.

Upstairs, a complete rehang of around 300 works has been guided by quality and variety over quantity. “We were clear that the project was never about putting more on display,” Vegelin says. “We wanted to display things better and in a much more engaging way—to give a richer account of the collection”. Conceived as a teaching resource for the Courtauld Institute of Art, the UK’s smallest university, the collection ranges from the early Medieval period to the 20th century and has at its core a bequest from Samuel Courtauld, an English textile manufacturer.

“The challenge we set ourselves in the installation was to provoke delight and inspiration and curiosity,” Vegelin says. “At every turn there is something thought-provoking and intriguing to discover.” Punctuating the famous paintings—now released from their old-fashioned hanging chains—are relevant selections from the decorative arts holdings and “little episodes” such as a display of oil sketches by Rubens examining his working processes.

A broadly chronological sequence leads from the “reborn” Medieval and early Renaissance gallery on the first floor to the Blavatnik Fine Rooms, six second-floor galleries including a “sensational” principal showcase for Renaissance works with a newly restored Botticelli altarpiece at its heart. A project space on the same level will “open a window for the public” on to the research activities of the Courtauld Institute, with scope for future initiatives to be developed by the students, faculty members or conservation department. Another new addition is a third-floor gallery devoted to the Bloomsbury Group, showing significant materials that were widely lent but only rarely exhibited at the gallery itself.

The “climactic moment of the whole visitor experience”, Vegelin says, is the LVMH-sponsored Great Room on the top floor, which has been restored to its original proportions as the first purpose-built gallery space in London, home to the Royal Academy’s summer exhibitions until 1837. Removing the old subdivisions and false ceilings has brought “natural light and volume”. Here, Samuel Courtauld’s celebrated Impressionist and Post-Impressionist pictures are re-installed and looking “better than I’ve ever known them”, Vegelin says. “Now in that wonderful soaring space, I think people will fall in love with them again.”

Leading off from the Great Room, the temporary exhibition galleries have also been rethought. Carved out of former back-of-house spaces, they will continue to host the kind of “high-quality, focused exhibitions” in which the Courtauld specialises, starting with 25 modern and post-war drawings recently donated by the artist Linda Karshan. Following in February 2022 is a show of Van Gogh’s self-portraits, departing from the Courtauld’s own with a bandaged ear and reuniting star loans from around the world. The programme dovetails with the approach to the permanent collection, Vegelin says: “It’s not about scale but about looking closely and enjoying the details.”

"Nike, H&M and LVMH linked to Amazon deforestation - Latest Retail Technology News From Across The Globe ... - Charged Retail","Tue, 30 Nov 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNoYXJnZWRyZXRhaWwuY28udWsvMjAyMS8xMS8zMC9uaWtlLWhtLWFuZC1sdm1oLWxpbmtlZC10by1hbWF6b24tZGVmb3Jlc3RhdGlvbi_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Nike, H&M and LVMH are all amongst a number of brands which are at risk of contributing to the deforestation of the Amazon rainforest.

New research into the global fashion industry’s supply chains has shown that the brands may already be contributing to the destruction of the rainforest due to their connections with tanneries and other companies that are involved in the manufacture of leather goods.

The report, which was released on Monday by Stand.earth, analysed nearly half a million rows of customs data and discovered that brands including Coach, LVMH, Prada, H&M, Zara, Adidas, Nike, New Balance, Teva, UGG and Fendi have multiple connections to an industry that is involved with the deforestation of the Amazon.

Over 50 brands have multiple links to the largest Brazilian leather exporter, JPS, which is known to engage in the practise of destroying the rainforest for commercial gain.

JPS recently committed to stopping deforestation across all of its supply chains by 2035, a commitment which has been branded as in sufficient by environmental groups.

The findings come at a time when a number of the brands involved in the survey have recently pledged to distance themselves from brands practising deforestation.

“With a third of companies surveyed having some kind of policy in place, [you’d expect] that would have an impact on deforestation,” one of the report’s authors Greg Higgs said.

“The rate of deforestation is increasing, so the policies have no material effect.”

Luxury fashion house, LVMH, which is still reeling from the shock death of artistic director Virgil Abloh, was found to have a high risk of connections to companies that contribute to deforestation, despite the fact it had promised to protect the vulnerable region with Unesco.

Brazilian Indigenous Peoples’ Alliance (APIB) executive coordinator Sônia Guajajara said that brands have “the moral responsibility, the influence and the economic resources” to stop working with suppliers contributing to deforestation in the Amazon today, “not in 10 years, not in 2025”."

The 21 Club’s Union Is In Turmoil as the Midtown Institution’s Future Remains Unclear - Eater NY,"Fri, 19 Nov 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vbnkuZWF0ZXIuY29tLzIwMjEvMTEvMTkvMjI3ODk2MTEvMjEtY2x1Yi11bmlvbi1sYWJvci10dXJtb2lsLXJlc3RhdXJhbnQtc2h1dGRvd24tbnlj0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Throughout the past year, staff turmoil has been roiling behind the scenes at shuttered Midtown institution 21 Club. Eleven months after the club officially shut down, five former workers in the restaurant’s decades-old union say members are still fighting to secure a substantial severance package from the company, or the right to their old jobs if 21 Club’s owner, billion-dollar luxury conglomerate LVMH, chooses to reopen the club. While the staffers rallied together at first, publicly protesting LVMH’s decision to close the club, the union has started to become unglued as neither severance packages nor job assurances have materialized in nearly a year, workers say.

Last December, 21 Club announced that it was permanently closing, another apparent restaurant casualty of the pandemic. The news drew national headlines: The 90-year-old Midtown icon was a regular haunt for presidents, celebrities, and storied New York personalities over the years. Then, in March, a representative for hospitality group and LVMH subsidiary Belmond told the New York Times that, actually, the restaurant as New York knew it wasn’t coming back, but something different and “distinctive” might be rising up in its place.

A month later, a Belmond representative reiterated the same sentiment to the New York Post, saying that the luxury group was “exploring potential opportunities” for bringing the space back to life, but they were “not ready to announce any final concept or timeframe.”

No one has followed these breadcrumbs hinting at a 21 Club revival more closely than the restaurant’s stronghold of unionized staffers, represented by local restaurant workers union Unite Here Local 100. Out of the club’s roughly 150 staffers, only a handful are nonunionized, and were offered severance packages at the time of their termination, unionized staffers say. But the majority of staffers, who are unionized, have not been paid severance nearly a year after the restaurant closed down while the terms of the payout remain unsettled.

The issues started with the original severance agreement outlined in 21 Club’s union contract, which Eater has reviewed. The contract specified two weeks severance pay in total for any staffer who worked at the club for more than five years, which some staffers — who spent the better part of their careers at 21 Club — refused outright to accept at the time.

Chauncey Duren, the first Black bar room captain at the establishment and a 15-year employee at the club, estimates that he made an annual income in “the high five figures,” with tips, at his position when the club was open. He says the severance package in the union contract would have guaranteed him about $600 in total. “It’s a disgraceful shame,” Duren says.

LVMH did make a more lucrative offer when the permanent closure was announced — one week’s pay per year for up to 13 years of service, according to documents reviewed by Eater — but it still seemed low to staffers like John Papaliberios, who worked as a server at 21 Club for 29 years, and is a leader on the union’s bargaining committee. According to Papaliberios, future job security and a larger severance package more commensurate with years of service was a fair request for LVMH — owned by Bernard Arnault, who jockeys with Amazon’s Jeff Bezos for the title of the richest man in the world — amid the shutdown. “They’re using the pandemic as an excuse just to throw the union out,” Papaliberios says.

“It’s a disgraceful shame.”

In an emailed statement to Eater, a Belmond representative declined to comment on specific questions related to the union, including the state of the unionized staff’s severance packages, citing ongoing conversations with the union.

Without an agreed-upon severance package, some staffers began to doubt that the union’s bargaining committee, including Papaliberios, were fighting for the full staff’s best interests. Sergio Caplan, a union worker and former bargaining committee member who was a bartender for 21 Club for four years prior to the citywide shutdown, says that some in the union eventually simply wanted access to a payout — even a lesser one — in order to help pay bills and move on from the club. Caplan pushed for the union’s leaders to survey each member to determine what to prioritize in negotiations, but the union’s bargaining committee didn’t want to focus on severance talks, he says. Instead, he claims that they were more focused on assuring that 21 Club workers would still have jobs if the restaurant were to return. (Papaliberios disputes the characterization. He says that members were asked on a Zoom call in December 2020 whether anyone wanted to take LVMH’s severance package at the time, although he acknowledges that committee members advised the union to fight for a better package. Since then, he says that LVMH has not responded to negotiations. “We’re doing our best, but there’s nothing we can do,” Papaliberios says.)

That didn’t sit well with some staffers who have since found new jobs and simply wanted the union to secure a reasonable severance package for them. “21 Club is not going to open up again,” Flavio Moure, another former bar room captain who now works at another restaurant in the city, says. “We’re not going to get our jobs back.”

“We’re not going to get our jobs back.”

In February, Caplan says that he was removed from the bargaining committee and allegedly cut out from union communications after continuing to argue for full staff surveys in meetings. “I did not let up with the union,” Caplan says. “I was like, ‘We’re not doing it right.’”

Caplan then filed a complaint with the National Labor Relations Board against 21 Club’s union in March, which Eater has reviewed. He was then added back to union communications, he says, although he remained off the committee.

Other staffers, some of whom have worked at the restaurant for decades and viewed the job as the pinnacle of their career, prioritized job security over severance provisions. Duren says that he would rather see the union secure jobs for its members in the possible next iteration of 21 Club, but so far, neither Belmond nor LVMH have indicated to the union what form 21 Club will be returning in, or a timeframe for the reopening, according to Duren and other staffers who spoke with Eater.

The Belmond representative reiterated in a statement to Eater what the company has said publicly in the past about future plans for the 21 Club. “Following the guidance of government and public health officials, 21 Club closed in March 2020 in order to protect its guests and employees,” the representative said in the statement. “In November 2020, in light of the pandemic’s impact and the extended recovery period for the hospitality industry, the difficult decision was made to keep 21 Club closed. Belmond has not made any decisions on how the space will be used going forward.”

The murky responses have left staffers searching for bits of information elsewhere. Caplan noticed in May that a message had popped up on 21 Club’s TripAdvisor page listing the establishment as temporarily closed until May 9, 2022, but a Belmond spokesperson told Eater at the time that was an error that Belmond’s digital team was working to correct (as of publication, the date still stands). Duren heard a rumor that the spot would reopen as a private club with a luxury retail component, but the spokesperson reiterated that the company was not ready to announce “any final concept or timeframe.”

“They definitely plan to reopen,” Duren says. “Just not with the union.”

As time dragged on, 21 Club’s unionized staffers watched as elsewhere in the hospitality sphere, NYC’s hotel unions secured industry-wide pandemic labor protections including severance agreements amounting to four days of pay for each year worked — with no cap — plus recall rights, or the right to be called back to the same job if it were to open up again. Mayor Bill de Blasio also signed a bill into law in October requiring closed-down hotels to pay severance of $500 per week for 30 weeks for each laid-off employee if the property did not reopen by November 1.

In the meantime, the workers were cut off from the company’s health insurance plan in September, according to emails reviewed by Eater, and 21 Club’s union contract expired at the end of October. The Belmond representative says that the company will continue to negotiate with the union’s leaders past the contract expiration, although they did not disclose the details or goals of those talks. According to NYC-based employment lawyer David Glanstein, companies with a unionized workforce are still generally required to bargain with union members past contract expiration, in accordance with federal labor laws.

For the former employees of the 21 Club, the past year has been a bitter end to what many saw as one of the best jobs in the industry, in part because of its union protections. “This was the last restaurant I wanted to work in,” Duren says. “I had no plans to go anywhere else.”"

He was 41.

LVMH announced the death Sunday via a statement posted on Twitter. “LVMH, Louis Vuitton and Off-White are devastated to announce the passing of Virgil Abloh, on Sunday, November 28th, of cancer, which he had been battling privately for years,” it read.

According to a statement on the designer’s own Instagram account, Abloh was diagnosed in 2019 with a rare form of cancer known as cardiac angiosarcoma. Despite his diagnosis, Abloh remained active in his design work. Highsnobiety described his S/S ’22 collection for Louis Vuitton as “Abloh at his best.”

Born on September 30, 1980, Abloh had climbed the ranks of luxury fashion and design through his collaborations with Kanye West and his distinctive, graphic-driven creations. Earlier this year, LVMH purchased a majority stake in Off-White, the label he founded in 2013 that had become a staple of the streetwear scene and collaborated with retail giants like IKEA.

In 2018, Abloh was named artistic director of Louis Vuitton’s menswear, making history as the first Black designer to be appointed to the role.

The designer is survived by his wife, Shannon Abloh, as well as his children, Lowe Abloh and Grey Abloh, his sister Edwina Abloh, and his parents, Nee and Eunice Abloh.

Bernard Arnault, chief executive officer of LVMH, shared his condolences through the LVMH Twitter account. “We are all shocked after this terrible news. Virgil was not only a genius designer, a visionary, he was also a man with a beautiful soul and great wisdom. The LVMH family joins me in this moment of great sorrow, and we are all thinking of his loved ones after the passing of their husband, their father, their brother or their friend.”"

The report, which cites Sephora Australia’s accounts filed with ASIC this week, states the makeup retailer’s losses hit $7.87 million in the year to December 2020 – signaling a need for further funding from global parent, LVMH.

LVMH has agreed to increase its support to keep Sephora trading as a going concern, after loaning the business $70 million during the past year, but Sephora’s losses seem to be mounting: with the $7.87 million loss coming after 2019’s loss of $6.5 million.

The physical beauty space has taken a hit throughout the pandemic, with fewer people needing to buy cosmetics while in lockdown and working from home, or turning to proven online providers such as Adore Beauty.

With Christmas coming and face-to-face work back on the cards in many states, however, Sephora’s struggles could ease over the course of the next year.

That’s not to say the business failed to act throughout the pandemic: Sephora commissioned a study aimed at helping the retail industry understand and tackle racism across the industry, and also increased the number of people with disabilities it employs – though this move was also criticised."

PARIS - Virgil Abloh, fashion's highest profile Black designer and the creative mind behind Louis Vuitton's menswear collections, died on Sunday of cancer, Vuitton's owner LVMH said.

The French luxury goods giant said Abloh, 41, had been battling cancer privately for years.

""Virgil was not only a genius designer, a visionary, he was also a man with a beautiful soul and great wisdom,"" LVMH's billionaire boss Bernard Arnault said in a statement.

Abloh, a U.S. national who also worked as a DJ and visual artist, had been men's artistic director for Vuitton, the world's biggest luxury brand, since March 2018.

His arrival at LVMH marked the marriage between streetwear and high-end fashion, mixing sneakers and camouflage pants with tailored suits and evening gowns. His influences included graffiti art, hip hop and skateboard culture.

The style was embraced by the group as it sought to breathe new life into some labels and attract younger customers.

In July this year, LVMH expanded his role, giving him a mandate to launch new brands and partner with existing ones in a variety of sectors beyond fashion.

LVMH also bought a 60% stake in Abloh's Off-White label, which it folded into the spirits-to-jewellery conglomerate.

""For over two years, Virgil valiantly battled a rare, aggressive form of cancer, cardiac angiosarcoma,"" a message posted to his Instagram said.

""He chose to endure his battle privately since his diagnosis in 2019, undergoing numerous challenging treatments, all while helming several significant institutions that span fashion, art, and culture.""

Abloh drew on messages of inclusivity and gender-fluidity to expand the Louis Vuitton label's popularity, weaving themes of racial identity into his fashion shows with poetry performances and art installations.

With an eye to reaching Asian consumers grounded by the coronavirus pandemic, the designer sent his collections of colourful suits and utilitarian-flavoured outerwear off to Shanghai last summer, when many labels cancelled fashion shows.

""Virgil Abloh was the essence of modern creativity,"" said an Instagram post by Alexandre Arnault, one of Bernard Arnault's sons and executive vice president for product and communications at U.S. jeweller Tiffany, which LVMH bought this year."

A-List Celebs turn up in big numbers for Virgil Abloh's memorial “He is survived by his loving wife Shannon Abloh, his children Lowe Abloh and Grey Abloh, his sister Edwina Abloh, his parents Nee and Eunice Abloh, and numerous dear friends and colleagues. “For over two years, Virgil valiantly battled a rare, aggressive form of cancer, cardiac angiosarcoma. He chose to endure his battle privately since his diagnosis in 2019, undergoing numerous challenging treatments, all while helming several significant institutions that span fashion, art, and culture. “Through it all, his work ethic, infinite curiosity, and optimism never wavered. Virgil was driven by his dedication to his craft and to his mission to open doors for others and create pathways for greater equality in art and design. He often said, “Everything I do is for the 17-year-old version of myself,” believing deeply in the power of art to inspire future generations. “We thank you all for your love and support, and we ask for privacy as we grieve and celebrate Virgil’s life.

CHA LING announced the launch of the brand-new ""Name a Tree"" campaign under its unremitting practice of the ""Tea Garden Project"" aiming for reforestation reservation. Starting now, customers who have purchased CHA LING The Cream or its refill at the brand's Shanghai TaiKoo Hui Store, Tmall Flagship Store or Sephora's website, APP, WeChat Mini Program and selected Sephora stores will have the opportunity to name a tea tree under the ""Tea Garden Project"". By joining hands with brand partners to lay a solid foundation for the development of a sustainable beauty consumption ecosystem, Sephora brilliantly illustrated its leading position in the premium beauty industry by continuously focusing on sustainability topics and actively fulfilling its beauty commitment in the Group's LIFE 360 initiative.



Sephora partners with CHA LING at the 4th CIIE

Sephora's CIIE booth is situated at the center of the LVMH exhibition area. Its classically concise and dynamic black-and-white stripes were combined with CHA LING's symbolic tea tree greenery, giving the booth a touch of nature-powered vitality. CHA LING The Cream, Eau de Toilette and other products were showcased for visitors to experience and appreciate the power of skin care deeply rooted in Yunnan's tea forests.

CHA LING Made CIIE Debut, Empowering Beauty Power with Sustainability

As a Sephora exclusive brand, CHA LING made its CIIE debut at the Sephora booth. Born from an ecological dream, CHA LING was created in 2012 by LVMH Research with the hope of guarding tea forests deep in Yunnan's Jingmai Mountain. With the brand philosophy ""Beauty with a meaning, for you, for the others and for the world"", CHA LING hopes to share its sustainable skincare philosophy of ""CHUN CUI"" with consumers while promising to commit a portion of its proceeds to the conservation of Yunnan tea forests.



CHA LING’s hero product CHA LING The Cream

At the CIIE, CHA LING presented its hero product, CHA LING The Cream, renowned among consumers as ""the Cream for Queens"". To create The Cream, LVMH Research journeyed deep into the Jingmai Mountain region, 1,200 meters above sea level in Xishuangbanna, Yunnan. The first tender leaves in early spring were selected from the thousand-year-old ancient Pu'er tea trees growing in this ecosystem. After five years of natural fermentation, eight polyphenols were extracted from the fermented Pu'er tea, and then blended with horse-chestnut flower polyphenols, from which LVMH Research created the P12 COMPLEX – the exclusive iconic ingredient of CHA LING. The highly concentrated active polyphenolic complex deeply nourishes the skin and accelerates the regeneration of collagen while revitalizing the cells and illuminating the skin. The complex also significantly tightens the contours and smooths out dry lines and fine lines.

CHA LING also reflects the brand's sustainable beauty philosophy from its packaging: the eco-friendly rose gold jar of The Cream is reusable, while the ceramic inner core is made of hand-crafted porcelain from Limoges, France – the ""capital of porcelain"". Inheriting the superb quality of European royal porcelain, the inner core is fired by hand yet easily recyclable. Consumers can purchase refills separately to reduce the carbon footprints of the packaging production process, a simple step to further protect the environment.



CHA LING's Eau de Toilette collection

In addition, CHA LING's Eau de Toilette collection was also presented at CIIE, including the latest CHA LING Eau de Toilette LINDA and VANDA*, which incorporated the brand's natural inspiration in its packaging design. The scent of tea leaves is intertwined with the fragrance of pears, white flowers, and white musk, whisking wearers back to the tranquil lands of Yunnan's tea forests in between scented breaths.

The entire line of CHA LING products, including The Cream and Eau de Toilette collection, are exclusively available on Sephora's omnichannel retail platforms. In fact, earlier this year CHA LING and Sephora China have established a strategic partnership. With Sephora's premium membership and omnichannel retail resources, CHA LING will continue to deepen its efforts in the Chinese market and bring consumers more premium C-beauty experiences while contributing to sustainable development. Ms. Angela Shum, Brand General Manager of CHA LING Greater China, said, ""As a brand that organically weaves together Chinese and French cultures, CHA LING blends the skin care philosophies of the East and West. From the star ingredients to the brand philosophy, CHA LING is inseparable from Chinese culture; meanwhile its products are imported from France. We are looking forward to bringing this luxury skin care experience from Yunnan tea forests to more domestic consumers, meanwhile reciprocating the local ecosystem so that personal and environmental beauty can blossom together.""

She further introduced that at this CIIE, CHA LING officially announced the new ""Name a Tree"" campaign, where consumers can buy the ""the Cream for Queens"" at CHA LING's Shanghai TaiKoo Hui Store, Tmall Flagship Store or Sephora's website, APP, WeChat Mini Program and selected Sephora stores, and then choose a tea tree to name in the brand's tea forest reservation in Yunnan. Through such interaction, CHA LING can safeguard its ecological beauty power in the name of consumers.

Consistency in Environmental Protection, Social Responsibility and Beauty Power in One



CHA LING’s “Tea Garden Project”

The new ""Name a Tree"" campaign is an extension of CHA LING's ""Tea Garden Project"". Since the brand's inception, CHA LING has been committed to conserving and cultivating the ecological and biodiversity balance of Yunnan tea forests through sustainable practices. Through the ""Tea Garden Project"", CHA LING has been working closely with Yunnan TianZi Biodiversity Development Center for 10 years, investing part of the brand's proceeds in the conservation of tea forests in Yunnan, where over 110,000 tea trees and 6,000 other trees are planted in a 20-hectare conservation area. In this ecosystem built by beauty power and goodwill, a variety of flora and fauna flourish by the grace of nature, bringing rich biodiversity to the local ecology and fulfilling the brand's sustainability vision.



CHA LING adheres to LVMH’s LIFE 360 initiative

As the parent company of Sephora and CHA LING, LVMH has always placed sustainability and social responsibility at the forefront of its development strategy. The Group works with its brands to develop acts that support the environment through its sustainability initiative LIFE 360, which places the circular economy, the protection of biodiversity, the fight against climate change and the transparency of product traceability as the 4 core pillars. It aims to build a new alliance between the Group and the nature, demonstrating LVMH's bold and avant-garde vision of luxury of the future.

Being a premium beauty retailer of the Group, Sephora has consistently advocated for sustainable beauty consumption in response to the Group's environmental vision. Over the years, Sephora has adhered to a green brand and product portfolio strategy and has collaborated exclusively with a number of brands embodying eco-friendly philosophies, including CHA LING. Sephora has followed a variety of sustainability principles in the process, ranging from raw materials and product production to packaging, aiming to combine social responsibility and beauty power into one. Ms. Maggie Chan, Managing Director of LVMH - Sephora Greater China, said, ""Sephora is well versed in the fact that the environment is closely related to individual's beauty power. As a member of LVMH, Sephora adheres to the Group's LIFE 360 initiative. Not only do we empower the brand's sustainable development with the belief of My Beauty Power, but we also infuse the concept of green beauty consumption into multiple aspects, including the brand philosophy, operation model and business ecosystem. Sephora is looking forward to working with all industry partners to build a better tomorrow for the beauty industry.""

After 16 years of exploration in the Chinese market, Sephora has tapped into the rising trend of C-beauty among local consumers, committed to introducing more high-quality C-beauty products to better deliver a unique beauty experience for consumers. Sephora also hopes to reduce the environmental footprints of beauty consumption and incrementally protect the earth with beauty offerings focused on sustainability while empowering consumers to elevate their beauty power. Through the platform of CIIE, Sephora and CHA LING serve as important representatives of LVMH as they look forward to jointly bringing more sustainable C-beauty possibilities to fulfill their beauty commitment to consumers.

They spent their wonderful childhood in the rainforest, their love for the rainforest is as deep as their parents' and they are committed to carrying on the ecological dream of protecting the rainforest. To commemorate the childhood of the rainforest fairies, CHA LING has incorporated the scenes of their growth in the tea forest and their very different personalities into the bottle design, customizing two special editions of LINDA & VANDA for the classic CHA LING Eau de Toilette.

Gulf Today Report



The artistic director of the Louis Vuitton men's collection Virgil Abloh passed away after fighting cancer for several years at the age of 41, the French owners of the fashion and luxury house LVMH announced.



""We are all shocked by this terrible news,"" LVMH CEO Bernard Arnault said in a statement.



“Virgil was not only a brilliant designer, a visionary, but also a man with a beautiful soul and great wisdom.



“The LVMH family joins me in this period of great sorrow and we all think of their loved ones after the passing of their husband, their father, their brother or their friend,” he added in the statement posted on the LVMH Twitter account.



The group said that he had been ""struggling privately"" with cancer for several years.



Abloh, famous for bringing streetwear to catwalk glitz, was the first black American creative director of the best French fashion house when he was chosen as artistic director of the Louis Vuitton men's collection in 2018.



LVMH also announced earlier this year that it will acquire a controlling stake in Abloh-created luxury streetwear brand, Off-White. LVMH took 60% of Off-White's capital and Abloh kept 40%.



Abloh addressed environmental and social issues in his work with Louis Vuitton, with anti-racist and anti-homophobic messages during his January parade in Paris. He said earlier this year that he planned to use his partnership with LVMH ""to expand opportunities for diverse individuals and promote greater equity and inclusion in the sectors we serve.

He transcended the fashion world and his untimely death at the peak of his career sent shockwaves across the globe, with tributes pouring in from rival design houses but also actors and sportspeople for a man seen as a deeply humane visionary.

“We are all shocked by this terrible news. Virgil was not only a genius designer, a visionary, but also a man with a beautiful soul and great wisdom,” LVMH chief executive Bernard Arnault said in a statement.

“The LVMH family joins me in this moment of great sorrow and we are all thinking of his loved ones after the passing of their husband, their father, their brother or their friend,” he added in the statement posted on LVMH’s Twitter account.

Alexandre Arnault, the former CEO of high-end luggage brand Rimowa, is now an executive at Tiffany & Co., the 28-year-old announced on Instagram on Friday.

He will be based in New York as the executive vice president of product and communications at the iconic jewelry brand.

LVMH, the world’s largest luxury goods conglomerate that owns Rimowa as well as 74 other luxury brands, bought Tiffany for $15.8 billion in October.

Alexandre Arnault’s father, Bernard Arnault, has run LVMH since 1989 and is the world’s fourth-richest man, with a $117 billion net worth.

Three other of Bernard’s children hold leadership positions at LVMH brands Louis Vuitton, Tag Heuer, and Berluti.

Alexandre Arnault, the son of Europe’s richest man, is coming on board as an executive at Tiffany & Co. after four years as CEO of high-end luggage brand Rimowa, Arnault and Rimowa announced on Friday.

At Tiffany & Co., 28-year-old Arnault will be the executive vice president of product and communications, according to a press release. Tiffany & Co. is the newest acquisition of LVMH, the world’s largest luxury goods maker, which is run by Arnault’s father, billionaire Bernard Arnault. After a monthslong dispute, LVMH closed its deal to buy the iconic jewelry brand for $15.8 billion in October 2020.

Arnault announced his career move on Friday on Instagram, a platform he frequently uses to highlight new Rimowa products as well as personal news like that of his recent engagement to Geraldine Guyot, founder of French accessories brand D’Estrëe.

«I am now leaving the reigns of Rimowa to join Tiffany & Co in New York,» Arnault wrote in the post. «I am honoured to have been part of the Rimowa family.»

A post shared by A.A (@alexandrearnault)

The post included a photo carousel of «a few snapshots of our incredible ride together,» as Arnault put it, including Rimowa’s collaborations with artist Alex Israel and streetwear brand Supreme.

«No matter the distance, Rimowa will always be in my heart,» Arnault wrote.

Bringing change to Rimowa

Arnault, who leaves Rimowa after four years as CEO, will stay on as the non-executive chairman of Rimowa, according to a company press release. In 2016, Arnault convinced his father to acquire Rimowa and spearheaded a modern reimagining of the 122-year-old German luggage brand, collaborating with trendy brands like Supreme and Virgil Abloh’s Off-White. Last year under Arnault’s leadership, Rimowa launched a bevy of new products including backpacks and sunglasses.

As Arnault told Business Insider in a phone call in November, «Even before the pandemic, we thought that our products needed to be more part of people’s everyday lives rather than just being at the airport or in the hotel room at the destination.»







LVMH has been led by his father, Bernard Arnault, since 1989. Bernard is the richest man in Europe by far and the fourth-richest person in the world, with an estimated $117 billion net worth, according to Bloomberg’s Billionaires Index. In the early months of the pandemic, Bernard saw more than $30 billion wiped out from his net worth as retail stores were forced to close and LVMH’s share price plummeted. But his empire has since rebounded, leaving his net worth $8 billion higher than it was before the pandemic.

The luxury goods empire is a family operation. In addition to Alexandre, three other Arnault children hold leadership roles at LVMH brands. Delphine Arnault, 45, is Louis Vuitton’s executive vice president. Antoine Arnault, 43, is the CEO of Berluti as well as LVMH’s head of image, communications, and the environment. Both Delphine and Antoine sit on LVMH’s board of directors. And 26-year-old Frederic Arnault is the CEO of Tag Heuer. (Bernard’s youngest son, Jean, is still in school, according to Bloomberg.)

Rimowa’s new CEO will be Hugues Bonnet-Masimbert, Rimowa’s former executive vice president of sales and client operations, who also spent 10 years at Louis Vuitton.

«At my side for the past three years, Hugues has been one of the primary artisans behind this success, and I am delighted to see him promoted to this new role,» Arnault said in a press release.

Another Louis Vuitton veteran, Anthony Ledru, will take over as Tiffany’s CEO, replacing Alessandro Bogliolo.

Arnault’s first day at Tiffany & Co. in his new home city of New York City was Friday, according to his Instagram, where he followed his big announcement with a photo of his Tiffany employee badge.

A post shared by A.A (@alexandrearnault)

Arnault’s fiancée, Guyot, is also relocating to New York, where she’ll continue to run her company, the designer said on Instagram."
