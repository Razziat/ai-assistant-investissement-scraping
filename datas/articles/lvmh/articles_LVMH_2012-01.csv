As Ermenegildo Zegna opens the Milan winter 2012 men‚Äôs season on Saturday, the company has recorded a 14 percent increase in sales in 2011, pushing total revenues to ‚Ç¨1.1 billion, or $1.4 billion.

‚ÄúWe are coming out from a jolly good 2011,‚Äù says Gildo Zegna, the brand‚Äôs chief executive. ‚ÄúBeside the good news in Asia, we finally have double digit increase in the United States ‚Äî and Europe, too, is doing fine because of a lot of visitors, from Russia, from Brazil and incredibly strong from China.‚Äù

The film, made with Arnault's full co-operation, shows the luxury mogul in home movies from his childhood; demonstrating his considerable skill on the piano; attending a Dior event in Shanghai; and visiting his childhood home, school, his grandparents' grave site, and his first office. As well as looking into his own past, the film explores how his father's entrepreneurship inspired him to create his own empire.

Fashion boss Antoine Arnault signals the end of 'bling' - Telegraph - The Telegraph,"Sat, 21 Jan 2012 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicmh0dHA6Ly9mYXNoaW9uLnRlbGVncmFwaC5jby51ay9uZXdzLWZlYXR1cmVzL1RNRzkwMzAwNjQvRmFzaGlvbi1ib3NzLUFudG9pbmUtQXJuYXVsdC1zaWduYWxzLXRoZS1lbmQtb2YtYmxpbmcuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Fashion boss Antoine Arnault signals the end of 'bling'

Fashion houses are set to end the use of 'bling', the ostentatious use of jewellery, diamonds and gold accessories, the heir to the Louis Vuitton Moet Hennessy empire has predicted.

It is the label-flashing form of conspicuous consumption beloved of wannabe rappers, Russian oligarchs at play and taste-deprived reality television stars.

Now - at long, long last - the signs at the Paris men's fashion shows this weekend are that the era of ""bling"" is drawing, unlamented, to its close.

Antoine Arnault, the 34-year-old heir to Louis Vuitton Moet Hennessy, (LVMH) a luxury and fashion empire valued at close to ¬£60 billion, said: ""We are going to enter an era in which logo and ostentation is going to be less successful.

""It will be about real quality.""

Mr Arnault is well placed to make this prediction. The group founded by his father, Bernard - France's wealthiest man, and according to Forbes magazine the fourth richest in the world - spans fifty of the world's best known high-end brands.

They include Christian Dior, Krug, Tag Heuer, Bulgari, Givenchy, and Glenmorangie as well as Louis Vuitton itself, of which Mr Arnault was head of communications for five years.

Despite worldwide financial turmoil, the sector is enjoying an ""anti-crisis"" he says: between June and September last year LVMH reported sales of ¬£4.9 billion, an 18 per cent increase across the group.

Arnault said he believes that the global appetite for luxury goods is poised for a bling-busting shift.

""People are going to want more quality, and less ostentation,"" he said.

""Especially in a world in economic crisis: you don't want to be seen with evidently expensive products. Just something that is beautiful.""

The most surprising aspect of the luxury industry's 14 per cent boom in the face of broader economic gloom is that it is driven by male consumers, who are now spending ¬£155 billion a year on luxury clothes and accessories for themselves, according to a new study.

This bodes ill for Natalia Vodianova, the Russian supermodel with whom Arnault has been romantically linked.

""The only explanation is that people still want to please themselves,"" Mr Arnault said.

""Men seem to be a little bit more selfish these days, and spend a bit more on themselves and a little bit less on their wives or girlfriends.""

To meet this growing male market, Arnault is spearheading the launch of a new, men-only business to provide the bling-free, inconspicuously luxurious clothes he believes these men want.

Berluti, a venerable LVMH-owned maker of handmade ¬£1000-and-up leather shoes launched its first menswear collection here on Friday night.

Mr Arnault said ""The collection is more Aston Martin than Ferrari. I love Aston Martin. And you know we had the file on our desk [to possibly purchase the company]. A few years ago we talked about it, it's luxury too. But it was too much.""

Despite passing on Aston Martin, Arnault says he hopes LVMH will buy more old, high-end luxury companies. He said: ""The group needs to continue to grow, to preserve savoir faire, craft and heritage.""

Yet LVMH is sometimes portrayed as the Roman Empire of fashion: a voracious acquirer of territory with its eye fixed only on profit and power.

The family that controls Hermes is currently mounting a spirited campaign against what its claims is an attempt to LVMH to mount a surreptitious takeover.

Last year Patrick Thomas, Hermes' chief executive, said of LVMH's purchase of more than 20 per cent of his company: ""If you want to seduce a beautiful woman, you don't start by raping her from behind.""

Citing an imminent shareholders' meeting - he sits on the LVMH board - Mr Arnault declined to discuss the Hermes hoo-ha.

Yet he insisted the LVMH empire's emphasis is not conquest, but civilisation too.

""This image, that we are [only] here to make money, it is just the opposite,"" he said.

""Speak to people in Berluti, in Dior, in Dom Perignon: not once have we worked with a brand that we didn't glorify. I don't know why, but some people really want to push that button, to say 'they are evil'. We hear it [the criticism], but we do not accept it.""

It is almost a year since John Galliano was fired as head designer at Christian Dior after his notorious drunken, anti-semitic comments in a Paris bar were broadcast online. LVMH's hunt for Galliano's successor continues: the most recently-touted candidate is Raf Simons, of Jil Sander.

Before that it was the American designer Marc Jacobs, who currently runs his eponymous brand and Louis Vuitton - both of which are owned by LVMH.

Mr Arnault said of Dior: ""They will wait until they find the perfect fit for the job. You have to speak to people, look around. They have patience.

People say ""what's going on?"" but inside [Dior] people are absolutely Zen about it. There is no urgency at all.""

Of Jacobs, he said: ""Whether he's at Vuitton or Dior, the guy is a genius. An incredible artist. I feel when I'm with him that I'm close to Picasso, in a way.

""The only thing I want is that he stays with us. The discussions were very peaceful, very calm with Marc and my father, and everything is fine between us.""

The paradox of high-fashion's high sales during this period of financial decline has, Mr Arnault believes, every chance of continuing.

""If you have trouble in your private life, who are you going to speak to?,"" he said.

""Not the new friend you made the day before, but people you trust and have known forever. Vuitton, Berluti, Hermes: it is those brands that have never compromised on quality or values that people turn to."""
Louis Vuitton v/s Warner Bros.: Let‚Äôs Get Ready to Rumble! - MissMalini,"Mon, 09 Jan 2012 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1pc3NtYWxpbmkuY29tLzIwMTIvMDEvMDkvbG91aXMtdnVpdHRvbi12cy13YXJuZXItYnJvcy1sZXRzLWdldC1yZWFkeS10by1ydW1ibGUvYW1w0gFfaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubWlzc21hbGluaS5jb20vMjAxMi8wMS8wOS9sb3Vpcy12dWl0dG9uLXZzLXdhcm5lci1icm9zLWxldHMtZ2V0LXJlYWR5LXRvLXJ1bWJsZS9hbXA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LV vs WB!

I suppose you‚Äôve already heard about the epic lawsuit that Louis Vuitton slapped Warner Bros., the makers of The Hangover Part II, with, that too right before Christmas (22nd Dec, 2011, exactly ‚Äí talk about being the Grinch!). No? Alright then, I‚Äôve got the entire scoop on this comedy gold of a legal scuffle, for you üôÇ

Spot the ‚Äúlegal‚Äù baggage!

‚ÄúCareful, that is‚Ä¶ that is a Lewis Vuitton.‚Äù ‚Äí Remember this line from Hangover-2, that Alan (played by Zach Galifianakis) mouths out to Stu (played by Ed Helms) at the airport? It was quite funny, right? But those po-faced ones over at LVMH headquarters failed to get the humour of this scene. Of course, they didn‚Äôt take too kindly to the mispronunciation: they claim it may cause ‚Äúconsumer confusion.‚Äù But what got them really, really, really worked up is the piece of luggage itself, which is clearly a fake (it bears the ‚ÄúLVM‚Äù monogram instead of the ‚ÄúLV‚Äù found on originals). That is, they have gripe about the film‚Äôs use of its trademark, and the characterization of the knockoff ‚Äí manufactured by Diophy group of companies, which is also being sued, before the International Trade Commission, to prevent them selling their goods in the US ‚Äí as a real one. According to the suit, WB‚Äôs ‚Äúexplicitly misleading the public about the source of the Diophy Bag‚Äù and undermining LV‚Äôs efforts to stamp out counterfeits of its products.

Apparently, LV objected to WB after the film‚Äôs release to remove that offending footage but it fell on deaf ears. When DVDs came out containing THAT scene, LV (must have) thought, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs it! Enough is enough.‚Äù And filed a lawsuit they did! They‚Äôre seeking profits from the film ÔÄ≠‚Äí which raked in $580 million ‚Äí and triple damages, along with an injunction to prevent copies of the film containing the airport scene from being distributed. Pretty ambitious, methinks.

Isn‚Äôt it a massive sense-of-humour failure from LV‚Äôs part? It‚Äôs a film shot in Thailand, a haven for knock-offs, for crying out loud. Is Alan the sort to tote around a fake LV bag? Ha! No way. We don‚Äôt think so. Isn‚Äôt it the joke that Alan, while so protective of his luggage, can‚Äôt even pronounce the brand name? Doesn‚Äôt it seem very much in keeping with the screwball character development that idiotic Alan would invest in what turns out to be a suite of counterfeit designer luggage? And moreover, don‚Äôt the clever folks at LVMH know that they are giving even more exposure to a relatively forgettable scene from the film? Agree with me, anyone?"
Robert Duffy is sued by former Marc Jacobs employee | British Vogue - British Vogue,"Tue, 03 Jan 2012 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZvZ3VlLmNvLnVrL2FydGljbGUvcm9iZXJ0LWR1ZmZ5LWlzLXN1ZWQtYnktZm9ybWVyLW1hcmMtamFjb2JzLWVtcGxveWVl0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Updated Tuesday January 3, 10.12am: The lawsuit between a former Marc Jacobs executive and the company has been settled out of court, papers filed in New York in late December show. The lawsuit was ""resolved to the satisfaction of both parties,"" an LVMH spokesperson told the Huffington Post.

Patrice Lataillade, who was Marc Jacobs International's chief financial officer, claimed he was fired for complaining about company president Robert Duffy's behaviour in the workplace. The company countered that Lataillade was dismissed over ""serious financial misconduct"" unrelated to his allegations, which Lataillade denied.

SEE WHY JACOBS DOESN'T WANT THE DIOR JOB

Updated Tuesday June 21, 10.39am: LVMH has further outlined the reasons as to why former Marc Jacons executive Patrice Lataillade was fired. Lataillade is currently suing the brand, claiming he was dismissed after objecting to a sexually discriminative environment - apparently imposed by Robert Duffy.

""The filing focuses on a purely technical matter and is simply an attempt to deflect attention from the facts concerning the serious financial manipulations of Patrice Lataillade, which were the sole reason he was terminated by Marc Jacobs,"" a spokesperson for LVMH said.

According to WWD, the company's counterclaim read that Lataillade was sacked after he""overstated by several million dollars to give the appearance that budget and bonus targets had been met"". On Friday Lataillade demanded that Robert Duffy himself should personally respond to the claim.

Updated Thursday March 31, 10.06am: LVMH has defended Robert Duffy against claims made by a former Marc Jacobs chief operating officer, alleging that the company's president is guilty of sexual discrimination and using company money for personal expenses. Patrice Lataillade, who was discharged in September, has this week filed a lawsuit against Duffy and is seeking lost wages, compensatory damages and reasonable attorneys' fees and costs.

""The allegations contained in the complaint are false,"" an LVMH spokesperson told WWD. ""Patrice Lataillade was terminated as chief financial officer and chief operating officer of MJI for serious matters unrelated to the allegations contained in the complaint. MJI, LVMH Inc. and Robert Duffy will vigorously defend the case in court.""

Examples of Duffy's wrongdoings, according to Lataillade, include a book that includes ""photos of MJI staff in sexual positions or nude"" and ""Duffy's use of a nude photograph for a billboard advertisement"". Lataillade said he was fired in retaliation for objecting ""to a discriminatory environment offensive to him"".

Lataillade started his LVMH career at Donna Karan in May 1996, before joining Marc Jacobs Inc in November 2002 as chief executive officer. He was promoted to chief operating officer in 2006.
