How LVMH Dominated Luxury and Where the “Bling Supremacy” Goes Next - Jing Daily,"Fri, 08 Oct 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vamluZ2RhaWx5LmNvbS9wb3N0cy9sdm1oLW91dHBlcmZvcm0tbHV4dXJ5LXRpZmZhbnktZGlvctIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LVMH shares what many other successful luxury companies have: a family shareholder and a long-term view.

LVMH differs from its peers through its decentralized model, which favors entrepreneurial attitudes, speed, and the spirit of conquest.

As the biggest group in the sector, it is LVMH's role to help redefine luxury itself.

LVMH has become the proxy for the luxury industry, thanks to its strong organic sales growth and acquisitions. In fact, after having published The Bling Dynasty in 2014 and Future Luxe a year ago, I might have to publish another book in 2030 called LVMH: A Luxury Supremacy.

Indeed, the only element of guidance the group has ever offered is its commitment to taking market share. In Churchill’s spirit of “you should never let a good crisis go to waste,” the group pushed its leading brands (Louis Vuitton, Dior, Tiffany, Hennessy, and more) further ahead and welcomed new ones into its sprawling portfolio. Meanwhile, some others went stale over the past 18 months. I don’t think there is “secret sauce” at LVMH, but I would like to point to four differentiating factors:

When LVMH announced it was purchasing Tiffany, the group said it would enable the jewelry brand to move away from a quarterly focus, as it was a victim of being a listed company that came under investor scrutiny every three months. The irony of this comment was lost on no one, given that LVMH is a listed company itself. But with a family shareholder, a proper next-generation view, and a long-term target of gaining market share, few decisions could be made in the short-term that even remotely affect brand equity or long-term prospects.

One of the 21 projections I made in my book is that CEO Bernard Arnault would eventually become the richest man in the world (and he has topped Amazon’s Bezos a few times since then, depending on equity market vagaries). And while many will argue there are more important things in life, you don’t build wealth in the luxury sector by having a “take the money and run” attitude. Put the work in, be ambitious, take risks, stay hungry and keep in mind that success does not happen overnight.

Dior has undoubtedly been a phenomenal success of late, tripling sales over the past three years and likely approaching 6 billion euros this year — steady growth in the face of COVID-19 constraints. But this strength wasn't built overnight. The brand many consider Bernard Arnault’s “baby” for which no expense should be spared and which has only one external benchmark, Chanel, has had the best retail locations, talent, and financial means. But ""consistency"" has only recently enabled it to break out.

Just because you think long-term, it doesn't mean you can’t be quick. Witness what is happening at Tiffany. Nine months after taking it in, LVMH has hired a dream team for the jeweler while launching new products (when that usually takes more than a year to accomplish) and a global media campaign (don’t tell me you missed Jay Z and Queen B).

It is difficult to imagine that happening anywhere else. And, yes, it likely helps the process that one of Bernard Arnault’s gifted sons works at Tiffany. But six months in, most observers already said LVMH had turned it around when, more than four years in, Burberry's turnaround is still a point of contention, and the CEO responsible for the repositioning of that brand has chosen to move on. There is a sense of urgency and execution that is almost dizzying at LVMH, which, sure, implies risk. But consumers want to have fun, and the “same, same” won’t cut it.

Having a good track record and a very diversified brand portfolio helps attract top talent. But the group is also good at moving star managers around quite efficiently, and many top CEOs have gone through the “Louis Vuitton school” and then applied their magic on other assets.

That is the case for the Dior and Tiffany CEOs, but it is also true at the helm of cognac and Champagne leader Moët Hennessy (the “MH” in LVMH). While the group has decidedly been influenced by Mr. Arnault and his family, key assets at LVMH are run by some of the best professionals in the luxury business (in management and creative roles.) The rise of Virgil Abloh within the group is the most visible example.

As an innovative independent company, Moncler has successfully defined “new luxury” as the space between Chanel and Nike. As the sector's leader, it is the role — in my view — of LVMH to define where luxury goes next and how it should capture an incremental portion of wealthy consumer wallets. Travel? Sure, welcome, Rimowa. Hospitality? Why not. Welcome, Belmond. What’s the next Champagne-like category? Rosé wines? Perhaps they have taken that on board, as well.

With its financial means, the group has the luxury to look at M&A, JVs, and other approaches to continue to reshape and redefine the industry. As Abraham Maslow once said (yes, the same Maslow whose pyramid luxury consumers are climbing): “In any given moment, we have two choices: step forward to growth or step backward into safety.” LVMH is not drawn to safety.

Erwan Rambourg has been a top-ranked analyst covering the luxury and sporting goods sectors. After eight years as a Marketing Manager in the luxury industry, notably for LVMH and Richemont, he is now a Managing Director and Global Head of Consumer & Retail equity research. He is also the author of Future Luxe: What’s Ahead for the Business of Luxury (2020) and The Bling Dynasty: Why the Reign of Chinese Luxury Shoppers Has Only Just Begun (2014)."
LVMH Snaps Up Officine Universelle Buly 1803: Exclusive - WWD,"Tue, 05 Oct 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3dkLmNvbS9mZWF0dXJlL2V4Y2x1c2l2ZS1sdm1oLWFjcXVpcmVzLW9mZmljaW5lLXVuaXZlcnNlbGxlLWJ1bHktMTIzNDk2NTg0OS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS ­— LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton has added another bijou to its portfolio: the prestige perfume and cosmetics brand Officine Universelle Buly 1803, WWD has learned.

Terms of the deal were not disclosed.

“Buly perfectly matches the philosophy that we find in the maisons of the LVMH group, combining an unparalleled heritage, craftsmanship and a unique experience in exceptional boutiques,” Bernard Arnault, chairman and chief executive officer of LVMH, said in a statement.

“Its refined products enjoy a significant success around the world, and we will do everything we can to ensure that this great family entrepreneurial adventure, led by Victoire de Taillac and Ramdane Touhami, continues to grow within the LVMH family,” he added.

LVMH, through its Luxury Ventures minority investment fund, has supported and assisted Buly for almost four years.

“When Mr. Arnault gave me the authorization to launch the fund, I reached out immediately to Ramdane and Victoire,” Julie Bercovy, founder and head of LVMH Luxury Ventures, said in an exclusive interview. “Buly became the first investment in the fund in October 2017. There were only two stores at the time, and now they operate almost 30.

“We’ve been very happy to support Buly,” she continued. “When Ramdane and Victoire decided to sell the company, it was natural for us to make an offer and to continue with this very strong relationship that we have built so far.”

The Buly acquisition marks the only time a brand supported by LVMH Luxury Ventures has been acquired by the LVMH group, which has 75 other brands in its portfolio.

De Taillac said she and Touhami jointly decided to sell Buly.

“Buly has been doing great,” said de Taillac, highlighting the brand’s network of 28 stores, plus 10 counters in Australia. “But the last two years have been very challenging due to COVID-19 and travel restrictions. It was difficult for us to work in the way we used to, when we were going everywhere.”

So to continue growing, the pair felt they needed a larger partner, and that LVMH was a natural fit.

De Taillac will remain Buly’s director of product strategy, image and communication, while Touhami is to keep focusing on the brand’s stores and products through his design agency. He will, however, step down from the CEO role. A new CEO should be named shortly and is to report to Stéphanie Medioni, executive president at LVMH Perfumes and Cosmetics.

Buly was relaunched in April 2014 by Touhami and de Taillac. “I sell dreams,” said Touhami in August 2014, during an interview with WWD, while discussing the natural beauty brand.

Buly has a fictional quotient, too. Its idea came partially from reading Honoré de Balzac’s novel “César Birotteau,” which was inspired by a late 18th-century perfumer named Jean-Vincent Bully, whose signature brand helped establish French perfumery.

More concretely, Touhami had long wanted to mine the world’s time-proven beauty secrets. He did that for three years to help stock Buly’s boutique with the likes of emu oil from Australia (for its healing and antiseptic qualities); poppy powder from Morocco (for its lip-coloring ability), and water-based fragrances (for their gentleness and moisturizing properties).

There were even boxwood hair combs painstakingly handmade in Japan, boar’s hair toothbrushes, scented matches and an expansive clay selection with green desert, blue, illite green and yellow clay, each with various beautifying purposes.

Buly’s namesake products, made in France the old-fashioned way, sans parabens, phenoxyethanol or silicon — including body, face and home items — are housed in handsome wooden display units crafted in 18th-century style. The floor tiles in the initial store on Rue Bonaparte were fired in Sicily’s ancient Etruscan kilns, and tabletops are made of marble.

Said Touhami: “When you come here, you need time, because it’s a trip.”

Personalized service makes up a large quotient of the Buly experience, with offers including people’s names being written on products in calligraphy and special wrapping services.

Two years after the brand’s launch, it went abroad into Taiwan and Korea. Next, de Taillac end Touhami moved their family to Tokyo to open Buly’s first store there, in April 2017.

“That was a big step, because we decided to do it without any partners,” said de Taillac, who explained that Japan is now Buly’s second largest market, where it will open three more stores before year-end.

Korea and France are the brand’s other biggest geographic markets.

Buly two years ago teamed with the Louvre museum to collaborate on channeling some of the museum’s most iconic works into perfume.

“I long dreamt that perfumers interpret artists’ great works,” Touhami told WWD at the time. “There’s always just been a visual interaction. Why not an olfactive one, too?”

“A lot of people in the world discovered us through the Louvre perfumes,” said de Taillac on Thursday.

Buly has around 800 stock keeping units in its portfolio. The water-based scents generate between 30 and 40 percent of the brand’s revenues. Other bestsellers include scented body oils, hand creams and lip balms, which can be personalized with initials.

Bercovy said it’s key that Buly — like all the brands at LVMH — remains autonomous to express its personality.

“The founders of Buly and the employees are at the heart and the soul of the company, of the brand, and obviously, we don’t want to change that,” she said. “So our priority is to keep this magic that happens, and that is so important and inherent to the success of Buly.”

There is lots afoot for the brand before yearend. Buly is opening new stores in Europe — in Milan and Munich — in November. In total, 23 Buly stores are expected to open by yearend.

Upcoming product launches include bath salts and some scents linked to the Louvre tie-in. A perfume for sneakers just came out.

Walk into a Buly store, and time is meant to stop, explained de Taillac.

“The selling ceremony of Buly is so sophisticated,” explained Bercovy, adding it sets the standard for many brands. “It is very impressive.”

She said LVMH is proud to have Buly joining the group.

“Our intention when we invest is not to acquire the brand at the end of the investment period, but the alchemy was so good that it was quite natural for LVMH now to get closer to Buly,” said Bercovy.

LVMH Sold $50.9 Billion Worth of Luxury Goods in the First Nine Months of 2021 - The Fashion Law,"Tue, 12 Oct 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWZhc2hpb25sYXcuY29tL2x2bWgtc29sZC01MC05LWJpbGxpb24td29ydGgtb2YtbHV4dXJ5LWdvb2RzLWluLXRoZS1maXJzdC1uaW5lLW1vbnRocy1vZi0yMDIxL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton sold 44.2 billion euros ($50.9 billion) worth of luxury goods – from handbags and ready-to-wear to wine and spirits – in the first nine months of 2021, up 46 percent from the same period in 2020 and up 11 percent from the first nine months of pre-pandemic 2019. During most recent 3-month quarter, which ended on September 30, the Paris-based conglomerate, which owns upwards of 75 luxury goods brands, revealed that sales grew by 20 percent to 15.51 billion euros ($17.90 billion), which appears to be something of a stabilization of the whopping 84 percent growth that it saw in Q2 of this year amid further loosening of pandemic restrictions and growth of vaccination campaigns.

Specifically addressing the Fashion & Leather Goods group, which is responsible for almost half of the group’s revenues as a whole, LVMH asserted that sales reached “record levels” and posted growth of 24 percent, driven in large part by “sustained demand” in the U.S. and a “strong rebound” in China. The individual division boasted sales of 21.32 billion euros ($24.58 billion) for the first 9 months of 2021, up from 13.93 billion euros ($16.06 billion) for the same period in 2019.

LVMH states that the “remarkable performance” in the first 9 months of the year was driven in large part by sales at Louis Vuitton, Christian Dior, Fendi, Loewe and Celine, and thanks, in part, to an “enlarged product offering in all categories” at Louis Vuitton, the “great success” of Dior’s new Caro bag, “strong demand” for Hedi Slimane’s ready-to-wear at Celine and for the brand’s Triomphe leather goods line, and the success of Loewe’s new Goya bag. (It is worth noting that Celine got a specific ready-to-wear mention in a round-up of points that mainly highlighted leather goods sales; although, that is largely unsurprising given Slimane’s enduring ability to sell clothing as opposed to just accessories.)

On the jewelry front, LVMH revealed that its newest powerhouse brand, Tiffany & Co., had an “excellent” first 9 months, with its momentum proving to be “particularly strong in the U.S.,” where a major marketing revamp for the iconic jewelry company is underway. Specifically, LVMH noted the “solid performance of [the] Tiffany T line,” as well as the “successful launch of « ABOUT LOVE » campaign starring Beyoncé and JAY-Z,” among other new developments.

Perfumes & Cosmetics bounced back to 2019 levels for Q3 “thanks to continued strong progress in US and China, and improvement in Europe,” and in terms of the Selective Retailing group, which includes beauty retailer Sephora and duty-free entity DFS, revenues for Q3 were up by 15 percent compared to Q3 in 2020 but still down by 19 percent compared to the same quarter in 2019. Sephora had a “good performance” for the quarter “despite sanitary constraints,” per LVMH, driven by strong online sales, as well as “strong momentum in skincare and haircare.” Unsurprisingly, DFS’s recovery is still largely stunted by a recurring downturn in international travel, which has meant that its revenue is still lower than 2019 levels.

As for the geographical breakdown, for the first 9 months of the year, consumers in Asia (excluding Japan) were responsible for 36 percent of all of LVMH’s revenues, up from 34 percent in 2021 but more importantly, up 31 percent from 2019, a nod to the increasingly robust spending power of the Asian market. The U.S., which is LVMH’s second largest market, generated 25 percent of the group’s revenues, up by 24 percent (from 2020) and 23 percent (from 2019).

Looking ahead to the rest of the year, LVMH stated, “Within the context of a gradual exit from the health crisis, the Group is confident in the continuation of the current growth; it will maintain a strategy focused on continuously strengthening the desirability of its brands, by relying on the authenticity and quality of its products, the excellence of their distribution and the reactivity of its organization.”

In a corresponding conference call, LVMH management touched on the Chinese government’s push against wealth inequality, with CFO Jean-Jacques Guiony stating that they have not seen any major shift in consumer “sentiment” in response to the “Common Prosperity” agenda or crackdowns on celebrity culture, and does not anticipate any major blows from their main customers who occupy the upper middle class.

As for takeaways from its individual brands, LVMH revealed that Tiffany & Co. is performing particularly well in connection with the overarching revamp, which Guiony shed light on, saying that the aim is to give the brand “a broader appeal to a larger scope of clients,” both from a marketing and products perspective.

Reflecting on the groups’ two biggest Fashion & Leather Goods brands, LVMH said that Louis Vuitton has benefitted from strong growth in volume, which has made for greater growth than price increases, which not only tend to make up a smaller portion of growth but are also limited, per LVMH, when it comes to “evergreen” products compared to more novel offerings. Guiony emphasized the strength of Dior, which benefits from a greater diversity of products that Louis Vuitton, and still has room for development in terms of its physical footprint, asserting that LVMH can – and is looking to – develop the brand even further without fear of overexposure.

And finally, LVMH shed light on its stance supply and distribution, LVMH management stated that despite widespread supply shortages across industries, “Our supply chain is good enough so that we do not face a lot of shortage, but the cost is definitely rising. So that’s where we are, but is not not a particular burning issue for us.” In terms of distribution by way of third-party retailers, such as Farfetch, LVMH revealed, “We are still very doubtful as to our participation to outside platforms, even if they offer e-concession models due to the fact that we cannot have access to client data, which is a big issue for us.”"

The other founders include luxury conglomerate LVMH, Prada Group and Richemont’s Cartier.

OTB owns eight fashion brands, including Diesel, Maison Margiela, Marni, Viktor&Rolf, and Jil Sander and has more than €1.3 billion ($1.5bn) in revenues.

LVMH initiated the blockchain platform in 2019 as an anti-counterfeit solution enabling customers to verify that its products are originals. However, since then, the objectives have evolved to include sustainability.

“We aim to provide our strong contribution to this strategic collaboration focusing on a circular business model, transparency for the customer, innovation and sustainability,” said Stefano Rosso, Board Member of OTB Group.

Brands already active on the platform include Bulgari, Cartier, Hublot, Louis Vuitton, Hennessy and Prada.

In June, Daniela Ott joined AURA as General Secretary and is now accelerating its rollout. It’s adding AURA Light, a software as a service solution, to lower the barriers to adoption. It’s also developing a non-fungible token (NFT) solution for luxury brands. We believe the anti-counterfeit solution is already an NFT at a technical level, but not in the popular collectible sense.

Meanwhile, another luxury blockchain consortium is Arianee which is working with Breitling, Richemont brand Vacheron Constantin and others.

Several luxury brands are dipping their toes in the water with NFTs, each in their own way. Louis Vuitton launched an online gaming experience to celebrate its 200th anniversary. Dolce & Gabbana sold a collection of nine NFTs for $5.65 million. And Gucci is exploring 3D clothing."

LVMH fashion sales climb despite concerns in China - Vogue Business,"Wed, 13 Oct 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZvZ3VlYnVzaW5lc3MuY29tL2NvbXBhbmllcy9sdm1oLWZhc2hpb24tc2FsZXMtY2xpbWItZGVzcGl0ZS1jb25jZXJucy1pbi1jaGluYdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"To receive the Vogue Business newsletter, sign up here.

Concerns about potential taxes on China’s wealthy citizens failed to dent LVMH’s fashion unit in the third quarter as gains at powerhouse brands Dior and Louis Vuitton continued and marketing efforts at Tiffany boosted sales.

The luxury conglomerate’s fashion and leather goods division posted growth of 24 per cent over the third quarter of 2020 (beating analyst expectations of 21 per cent), driven by its two powerhouses Louis Vuitton and Dior as well as Fendi, Celine, Loewe and Marc Jacobs. “The dynamics within the division were at play again in the third quarter,” Jean-Jacques Guiony, LVMH chief financial officer, told investors on Tuesday. The division grew 38 per cent versus the third quarter of 2019. Total group sales rose 11 per cent versus the third quarter of 2019.

“We believe this should come as a relief to investors, especially after the August wobble in the sector and the doubts on Chinese demand trends,” says Bernstein analyst Luca Solca. China’s President Xi called for “common prosperity” following on from a regulatory crackdown, which worried investors. “All in all, we expect the update — and constructive commentary on future growth — should help to support the stock.”

Exane BNP Paribas analysts echoed the sentiment in a note: “After a significant de-rating since June, what matters the most in our view is that the third quarter did not disappoint, management did not issue any cautious comments about China nor US, and confirmed the positive full year 2021 margin outlook given late July.”

“We are not particularly concerned,” Guiony said about China. “For the time being, we don’t see a change in consumer sentiment in China. The volatility that we have seen is linked to the Covid-19 restrictions,” Guiony said. Jewellery was subject to some pressure in Asia, he noted. The watches and jewellery division, excluding Tiffany & Co., grew 18 per cent versus the third quarter of 2020, against a 71 per cent growth in the first half of the year. “[The] numbers were a bit soft in August due to Covid constraints, and better in September,” Guiony said."

Fabio d’Angelantonio, a former marketing executive at Luxottica who became Loro Piana’s chief executive in 2016, will leave the brand, the French luxury group said in an internal announcement seen by BoF.

The change comes as Loro Piana seeks to bounce back from the pandemic. The brand, which is known for its suede walking shoes and cozy, understated daywear made from cashmere and other top-end fibers like vicuna, is also looking to expand its presence in the lucrative handbag market.

Following LVMH’s 2013 acquisition, the brand grew by rolling out boutiques in luxury shopping districts dominated by flashier brands like Paris’s Avenue Montaigne and Tokyo’s Ginza. But prime real estate isn’t the magic bullet it once was, with international tourist flows still depressed by the pandemic. Instead, brands increasingly need to catch the attention of consumers on social media and through their e-commerce sites before they’ll consider buying in store.

Loro Piana’s conservative positioning has won it a cult following among older wealthy shoppers, but has been slow to attract an online audience—a key ingredient for brands’ post-pandemic recoveries.

LVMH, which does not break out sales for individual brands, has not highlighted the unit’s financial performance in recent earnings presentations.

In October the brand released its first-ever collaboration, with the Japanese streetwear star Hiroshi Fujiwara, in a bid to revamp its image and win attention from younger customers.

The French brand, known for its perfumes, skincare products, balms, oils, accessories and scented candles, was relaunched in 2014 by husband and wife Ramdane Touhami and Victoire de Taillac. Since then, the label has become popular for its signature fragrances and vintage-style packaging inspired by the heritage of traditional pharmacies and the creations of Jean-Vincent Bully, an emblematic French perfumer of the 19th century. Buly currently operates over 25 stores around the world.

Spotted by LVMH for several years for the quality and refinement of its products, Buly had received funding from LVMH Luxury Ventures in 2017. In the wake of the acquisition, LVMH intends to accelerate the brand’s development., especially on foreign markets

“Buly perfectly embodies the philosophy that we find in the Houses of the LVMH group, combining an incomparable heritage, craftsmanship and a unique experience in exceptional boutiques. Its refined products are very successful around the world and we will do everything in our power to ensure that this great family entrepreneurial adventure, led by Victoire de Taillac and Ramdane Touhami, continues to grow in the LVMH family,” commented Bernard Arnault, CEO of the LVMH Group.

Stéphane Bianchi to Lead LVMH's Watches and Jewelry Activities - WWD,"Fri, 29 Oct 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3dkLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy1uZXdzL2h1bWFuLXJlc291cmNlcy9sdm1oLXByZXNpZGVudC13YXRjaGVzLWpld2VscnktYnVsZ2FyaS0xMjM0OTg2NzE4L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Bringing almost all hard-luxury activities under one leader, LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton has named Stéphane Bianchi president of its watches and jewelry division, and a member of the LVMH executive committee.

The executive, who has moved swiftly up the ranks since joining the group in 2018, saw his purview expanded last year from its watchmaking division to the jewelry houses Fred and Chaumet.

He now adds Bulgari to his remit. Jean-Christophe Babin continues in his role as chief executive officer of Bulgari, and now reports to Bianchi. Previously, Babin reported to Toni Belloni, group managing director of LVMH.

Bernard Arnault, chairman and CEO of LVMH, lauded Bianchi’s “great passion for these categories, and true dedication to product quality and innovative ideas.”

“He has also proven the ability to attract and coach strong talents, a key to the future of our group. I am confident he will do a great job leading our watches and jewelry maisons to the next level,” he added in an internal announcement seen by WWD.

Bianchi was CEO of the Yves Rocher Group, which includes the Petit Bateau brand, from 1998 to 2015.

At LVMH, he initially focused on the watch maisons Tag Heuer, Hublot and Zenith, “building the business fundamentals and organization for these brands, and developing his expertise in hard luxury,” LVMH said in the announcement, also lauding his oversight of Fred and Chaumet, ensuring a “strong rebound from the difficulties of the pandemic.”

The addition of Bulgari “rounds up his responsibilities” and rationalizes the group’s organization.

Tiffany & Co., only recently integrated into the group, will continue to be managed outside the watches and jewelry division.

“Each maison will continue to be managed individually to perpetuate its differentiation,” LVMH noted. Among prominent brand executives is Frédéric Arnault, CEO of Tag Heuer.

“We will frame their focus with a total ‘hard luxury’ strategy, and enhance sharing of knowledge and resources for faster progress,” LVMH added.

Belloni said Bulgari has “made great progress over the years” and credited Babin, its CEO since 2013, for “excellent” results. “He has refocused the maison on its core ‘métiers’ and unique Italian heritage with high energy and vibrant ideas. Together with Stéphane, they will make a great team, and continue to elevate the attractiveness of the maison.”

The integration of Tiffany has more than doubled the size of LVMH’s watches and jewelry business, which posted revenues of 6.16 billion euros in the first nine months of 2021, versus 2.26 billion euros during the same period in 2020.

Excluding Tiffany, third-quarter sales in watches and jewelry rose 1 percent in comparable terms versus 2019, after a 9 percent increase in the second quarter, with the group blaming volatility in Asia, which impacted jewelry in particular.

While shares of leading companies, including LVMH, fell sharply in the wake of Xi’s speech, the French conglomerate’s third-quarter sales suggest there has been little impact in its stores in China so far.More from WWDFront Row at Louis Vuitton RTW Spring 2022

“We don’t see a change in sentiment,” Jean-Jacques Guiony, chief financial officer of LVMH, told analysts during a conference call on Tuesday. The luxury group posted revenues of 15.51 billion euros in the three months to Sept. 30, up 11 percent in organic terms versus 2019, considered a more reliable benchmark due to the disruptions caused by the coronavirus pandemic last year. This was comparable to sales growth in the first half, whether by activity or by region, the group said in a statement after the Paris stock market closed.Organic sales in Asia, excluding Japan, rose 26 percent in the third quarter versus 2019. This compared with an increase of 34 percent in the second quarter, but the decrease was due mainly to measures to contain a resurgence in COVID-19 cases in August, Guiony said. He declined to comment on what he labeled as “internal policy decisions by political leaders,” but said LVMH was not concerned about the impact of the new Chinese policy, which also includes a crackdown on celebrities who have traditionally driven sales for luxury brands.“The only thing I could say is that when we look at it, we don’t see any reason to believe that this could be detrimental to the upper middle class, affluent class, that is the bulk of our customer base,” Guiony said. “So we’re not particularly worried or concerned with the recent announcements.”Double-digit growth in Asia and the United States fueled growth at one of LVMH’s star brands, Tiffany & Co. While the group did not break out the U.S. jeweler’s performance, Guiony reported good progress with the house since LVMH completed its acquisition in January for a record $15.8 billion.As a result, Tiffany has axed most of its wholesale business, he reported. “Tiffany has really two cylinders, and the two are firing at full speed,” Guiony said. “The business is doing well. It’s doing well in Asia, it’s doing well in the U.S. As I said before, all the initiatives, be it product or marketing, are getting a good response from the client base, wherever it takes place, so we are pretty happy.”The most visible change has been in the brand’s communications strategy, with a controversial guerrilla-style campaign with the slogan “Not Your Mother’s Tiffany” launched in July, and a high-profile advertising push featuring Beyoncé and Jay-Z unveiled in August. Under the leadership of Ruba Abu-Nimah, its new executive creative director of marketing and communications, Tiffany is also reviewing all its product categories to determine what to keep and what to lose. “We want the brand to have a broader appeal to a larger scope of clients, and it is exactly what we are implementing from a marketing viewpoint, but also from a product viewpoint,” Guiony said. He explained that Tiffany is less exposed to Millennials since it has traditionally relied on the U.S. market, which accounts for 45 percent of revenues.“We want to develop the rest of the business on a worldwide basis, but not at the expense of the U.S. business,” Guiony said. ”Obviously, our aim is to develop our business with young people, but we don’t have particular quantitative goals in that respect.”The integration of Tiffany has more than doubled the size of LVMH’s watches and jewelry business, which posted revenues of 6.16 billion euros in the first nine months of 2021, versus 2.26 billion euros during the same period in 2020. Excluding Tiffany, third-quarter sales in the segment rose just 1 percent in comparable terms versus 2019, after a 9 percent increase in the second quarter. Guiony said the sector suffered from the volatility in Asia, which impacted jewelry in particular.The fashion and leather goods division, home to cash-cow brands Louis Vuitton and Dior, remained the key driver of the business, with revenues of 7.45 billion euros in the third quarter, up 38 percent in organic terms versus 2019. This represented a slight deceleration from the second quarter, when the division posted a 40 percent sales jump, but was in line with the first-half average.Organic growth in the segment was up 24 percent compared to the same period a year go, which marked a return to growth after a sharp decline in the first half of 2020. This was better than expected by analysts, who had penciled in a 21 percent increase, according to a consensus forecast.“Louis Vuitton, which celebrated the 200th anniversary of the birth of its founder, performed remarkably well, driven by constant innovation and by the quality of its products. Christian Dior showed exceptional momentum,” LVMH said. It also cited the good performance of Celine, Fendi, Loewe and Marc Jacobs.Guiony said there was still plenty of growth potential for Dior, which saw organic sales soar by more than 80 percent in the first half, according to market sources, prompting analysts to anticipate a slowdown. While declining to provide precise figures, Guiony noted that Dior was still smaller than many other luxury brands and benefited from a diversified product range. “This gives us some headroom,” he said. “We are nowhere near the time when the brand is becoming too big or overexposed, even in terms of number of stores. I will not go into details, but we have way less stores than the biggest brands of the fashion and leather universe, so that’s also something we can count on to develop the business further.”He expects the U.S. market to continue powering global luxury sales, dismissing the significance of a slowdown in organic revenue growth in the region to 22 percent in the third quarter from 31 percent in the previous three-month period. Guiony noted that LVMH’s sales in the U.S. have increased on average by 10 percent annually for the past 12 years. “This is a growing area for luxury. I mean, we have no reason to believe that what has been playing in our favor over the last 12 years will not be there tomorrow,” he said. Organic sales of perfumes and cosmetics were flat in the third quarter compared with 2019, while the selective retailing division, which includes LVMH’s travel retail business DFS, recorded a 19 percent decline. Both segments were hit by the continued dearth of international travelers and ongoing store closures.“Sephora returned to its 2019 level of activity despite the tough commercial environment, marked by the closure of several stores during part of the year,” LVMH noted, while also reporting a “promising start” for its new La Samaritaine department store in Paris, which opened in June.Meanwhile, sales of wines and spirits were up 7 percent, fueled by growth in the U.S. and Europe, which benefited over the summer from the reopening of restaurants and the gradual recovery of tourism. The third quarter marked the integration of Armand de Brignac, after LVMH’s acquisition of a 50 percent stake in Jay-Z’s prestige Champagne brand in February.Analysts had expressed caution about prospects for the luxury sector heading into the results season.Edouard Aubin, analyst at Morgan Stanley, said the recent correction in the LVMH share price was proof that the market has priced in a slowdown in growth rates. LVMH shares closed up 0.3 percent at 633.90 euros on the Paris Stock Exchange on Tuesday, down from an intra-year high of 712 euros on Aug. 12. “Like other personal luxury goods names, LVMH will face a number of risks in the coming months,” Aubin said in a recent research note. “The group will likely not be in a position to sustain the growth rate of the last one or even four years. However, we would argue that this is more than anticipated by the market.”Kering is due to report third-quarter results on Oct. 19, followed by Hermès International on Oct. 21.SEE ALSO:

The Parisian Buly brand now joined LVMH’s 75-strong ‘maisons’ or brands, including Parfums Christian Dior, Guerlain and Benefit Cosmetics. Financial details of the acquisition were not disclosed.

‘Unique identity’ to match LVMH philosophy​

Relaunched in 2014, Buly was renowned for quality products and original and refined stores, LVMH said. “Thanks to a unique identity, between heritage and modernity, tradition and innovation, L’Officine Universelle Buly has become an iconic brand.”​

Bernard Arnault, chairman and CEO of the LVMH Group, said: “Buly perfectly matches the philosophy that we find in the Maisons of the LVMH Group, combining an unparalleled heritage, craftsmanship and a unique experience in exceptional boutiques.”​

“Its refined products enjoy a significant success around the world and we will do everything we can to ensure that this great family entrepreneurial adventure, led by Victoire de Taillac and Ramdane Touhami, continues to grow within the LVMH family,”​ Arnault said.

Victoire de Taillac, co-founder of Officine Universelle Buly 1803 and incoming director of product strategy, image and communication of the brand at LVMH, said the last six years had seen Buly 1803 draw inspiration from “forgotten or little-known beauty secrets” ​in a bid to “revive”​ this iconic Parisian brand.

Taillac said the LVMH acquisition would change little of that, enabling the brand to remain “true to its unique identify” ​within the group that housed many other “authentic and powerful” ​brands.

Prestige beauty and fragrance push​

Potential in prestige beauty and fragrances had continued to evolve in recent months, with L’Oréal and Prada recently launching their first co-developed fragrance​ – part of wider plans to create a highly competitive ‘code-disrupting’ global beauty brand.

Luxury retailers received a boost on Wednesday after LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton (MC.PA) revealed a rise in demand in its third quarter last night.

Sales at the French group’s fashion and leather goods division jumped 38% to €7.4bn (£6.3bn, $8.6bn) on an organic basis compared to the same period in 2019.

Its Louis Vuitton brand, which brings in the majority of profit, continued to see strong demand in the US and China, it said, with quarterly revenue across the business at €15.5bn. Analysts had expected revenues of €15bn.

The company, which owns brands including Dior, Givenchy, and Marc Jacobs, said it was “confident” the current momentum would continue even if the recovery from the pandemic is becoming less dramatic. Its luxury products also span Moët & Chandon champagne and Bulgari timepieces.

The world's biggest luxury firm added that there were no signs that a feared crackdown on the mega-rich in China, its second-biggest market, was affecting sales. However, overall revenue growth in Asia and the United States eased from their strong first-half.

In August, China’s president Xi Jinping called for ""common prosperity"" and wealth redistribution, causing investors to worry that Beijing might promote measures to reduce the country’s wealth gap.

Jacques Guiony, chief financial officer, said: “It’s difficult to analyse the potential impact but there is nothing alarming so far. The bulk of our customers in China are not billionaires but the affluent and upper middle classes.”

He added: “Our growth rate remains strong and we have almost completely erased the impact of the health crisis in under a year.”

The news pushed shares in the company 1.5% higher in Paris while Gucci owner Kering (KER.PA) was up 0.3%, and Hermes (RMS.PA) saw a climb of more than 1.1%. Both Kering and Hermes will report third-quarter sales later this month.

""LVMH delivers another strong quarter,"" analysts at Jefferies said in a note. ""While we remain cautious on the sector in the short term, we continue to view LVMH as the structural winner.""

Meanwhile, Christopher Rossbach, manager of the World Stars Global Equity Fund, said: ""We believe that market concerns about ‘common prosperity’ are misplaced. Its essence is a policy reset to reduce income inequality, address the income gap between rich and poor and form an ’olive-shaped’ social structure that has large share of middle class in the middle and a small number of people being very rich or very poor.

“LVMH, the leader in the luxury sector, offers an incredible breadth of products to offer and has price points to suit all budgets. We believe it is positioned for share gain and will emerge as a major beneficiary of the ‘Common Prosperity’ policy.”

Henkel, L’Oreal, LVMH, Natura &Co and Unilever joined forces to create the consortium – open to all cosmetic companies to join – in a bid to offer beauty consumers worldwide “clear, transparent and comparable”​ information that considered a product’s entire life cycle.

The voluntary and brand-agnostic system would be built around four key principles: a common method for measuring environmental impacts throughout product life cycle; a common database of environmental impacts for standard ingredients and raw materials; a common tool to calculate environmental impact per product; and a harmonised scoring system that enabled easy comparison for consumers. Importantly, the companies said its science-based methodology would be verified by independent parties, including external sustainability consultants and experts, scientists, academics and NGOs.

“The work developed by the consortium will be published and made accessible on a strictly voluntary basis by both consortium participants and all other interested parties,”​ Henkel, L’Oréal, LVMH, Natura &Co and Unilever said.

So, as news of the consortium continued to garner interest among industry, CosmeticsDesign-Europe caught up with executives from the founding companies to find out just exactly what the consortium meant for business, consumers and the future of green and circular beauty.

Consumers need to be able to compare ‘like-for-like’ beauty products​

Asked why the consortium and impact system was such an important move for the global beauty sector, Joachim Kremer, senior manager of global sustainability at Henkel Beauty Care, said: “We have already made great progress in developing lifecycle assessment methodologies for our own products, but we need to find a way to collaborate as one beauty industry. Thereby, we want to facilitate the launch of a voluntary industrial standard, a consistent approach to measuring and communicating the environment impact of cosmetic products.”​

Consumers are demanding greater transparency around the environmental impact of cosmetics [Getty Images]

The aim of the initiative, Kremer said, was to enable consumers to compare “like-for-like products across different brands”​ and make “informed purchasing decisions”.​

Alexandra Palt, executive VP and chief corporate responsibility officer at L’Oréal, agreed and said it was critical industry responded to “growing consumer demand”​ for greater transparency around the environmental impact of cosmetic products.

“Certain companies have made progress in developing environmental impact assessment methodologies for their products. At L’Oréal, for instance, we have developed a product environmental and social labelling system. To ensure greater impact, however, we felt the need to work with other players to facilitate the launch of a voluntary industrial standard, a consistent approach to measuring and communicating the environment impact of cosmetic products,”​ Palt said.

Hélène Valade, group director of environmental development at LVMH, said the aim was to develop a “science-based footprinting and scoring system”​ based on life cycle analysis (LCA) principles.

“The methodology developed will be aligned with the principles of PEF [Product Environmental Footprint] methodology defined by the European Commission and will include adaptations to ensure it addresses specificities within the cosmetics industry,”​ Valade said.

‘Vital’ for the health and wellbeing of people and planet ​

Louise Scott, VP of R&D at the Natura &Co Group, said the creation of such a consistent system that was “clear, transparent and effective”​ at communicating environmental impact was “vital for the health and wellbeing of the people and the planet”.​

“Consumers are, rightfully, increasingly demanding greater transparency of the origin of products and their environmental impact. There is a proliferation of environmental scoring initiatives across the cosmetics industry but with no standard, comparable, industry-wide approach to communicating the environmental impact of cosmetics products, it’s hard for consumers to make comparisons,” ​Scott said. The beauty consortium aimed to address that, she said.

Sunny Jain, president of beauty and personal care at Unilever, agreed: “What we need is a clear, transparent and harmonised approach to help consumers compare products like-for-like and ultimately make more sustainable shopping choices. That’s what this consortium is setting out to achieve for the first time in the beauty sector.”​

Asked how each company planned to contribute its expertise and experience to consortium efforts, Henkel’s Kremer said its team would bring 20+ years of experience in science-based environmental assessment and lifecycle analysis. L’Oréal’s Palt said its team would share the labelling system launched by Garnier in June 2020 that considered 14 planetary impact factors, measured at every stage of a product’s lifecycle. LVMH’s Valade said its team would onboard a significant number of global historic fragrance, cosmetic and skin care brands to the voluntary system, as well as young brands with plenty of future potential. Natura &Co’s Scott said its team would bring forward experience from the Natura brand as it had been quantifying environmental impact since 2016 via its environment profit and loss (EP&L), social profit and loss (SP&L) and integrated profit and loss (IP&L) methodologies. Unilever’s Jain said its team would bring forward worldwide experience in carbon impact communication, built up over years of involvement in pilots and projects globally.

‘We need to work together – as one industry’​

Asked how important it would be to onboard more cosmetic companies, Kremer at Henkel said: “We hope that the rest of the industry will recognise the value in the consortium – why it has been set up and what it intends to do – and wishes to become a part of collectively realising the vision to help consumers make more informed purchasing decisions. We need to work together – as one industry.”​

Palt at L’Oreal agreed: “The greater the industry representation, the bigger the impact this initiative can have. The consortium will be developed in such a way as to be brand-agnostic, with the aim of attracting many brand owners, regardless of their size and resources. The scoring tool will be designed (…) to be usable by non-experts.”​

Scott at Natura &Co, added that the consortium hoped to attract “as much of industry as possible”​ and it would be “crucial for more cosmetic companies to join”.​

Valade at LVMH added though that the system would remain “entirely voluntary”​ in compliance with competition laws.

Jain at Unilever, said: “All companies within the cosmetics sector who meet the membership criteria are welcome and encouraged to sign up. This includes, but is not limited to, cosmetics manufacturers, distributors, brand owners and brand owner trade associations representing them.”​"

By Alice Brooker

The wine and spirits arm of LVMH saw sales rise by 30% during the first nine months of 2021, aided by the ‘gradual recovery’ of tourism.

Luxury goods company LVMH has revealed its year-to-date and third quarter sales.

Revenue for the firm’s wine and spirits unit reached €4.25 billion (US$4.91bn) over the first nine months of the year, an increase of 30% compared with the same period in 2020.

The figure represents a 10% organic increase in sales when compared with same period of 2019.

Meanwhile, LVMH posted €1.55bn (US$2.1bn) in wine and spirits revenue in the third quarter of 2021, a 10% jump from 2020’s Q3.

LVMH is the owner of spirits brands including Scotch whiskies Ardbeg and Glenmorangie, Belvedere Vodka and Hennessy Cognac.

Despite being ‘limited by supply constraints’, the firm said Hennessy Cognac grew volume sales by 4% compared with the same period in 2019.

The group reported ‘particularly strong’ growth in the US and in Europe this year due to the reopening of restaurants and the slow but steady recovery of tourism.

China also experienced a strong rebound in 2021, according to LVMH.

In July this year, the Moët Hennessy owner reported a 44% rise in sales during the first half of its financial year, with revenues hitting €2.71 billion (US$3.19bn). The firm attributed this to ‘sustained demand’ in the US and a ‘strong rebound’ in China.

LVMH said: “Within the context of a gradual exit from the health crisis, the group is confident in the continuation of the current growth; it will maintain a strategy focused on continuously strengthening the desirability of its brands, by relying on the authenticity and quality of its products, the excellence of their distribution and the reactivity of its organisation.”"
Climate change protester crashes Louis Vuitton catwalk show in Paris - FRANCE 24 English,"Wed, 06 Oct 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZyYW5jZTI0LmNvbS9lbi9ldXJvcGUvMjAyMTEwMDYtY2xpbWF0ZS1jaGFuZ2UtcHJvdGVzdGVyLWNyYXNoZXMtbG91aXMtdnVpdHRvbi1jYXR3YWxrLXNob3ctaW4tcGFyaXPSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Extinction Rebellion climate activists burst onto the catwalk at Louis Vuitton's Paris Fashion Week show Tuesday to blast the industry's impact on the environment, with a banner condemning the effect of excessive consumption on the environment.

An activist walks on the ramp with a banner that says ""Overconsumption = Extinction"" after crashing the women's ready-to-wear collection show of designer Nicolas Ghesquiere for fashion house Louis Vuitton during Paris Fashion Week on October 5, 2021.

Carrying a sign reading ""overconsumption = extinction,"" the woman, representing Amis de la Terre (Friends of the Earth) France, Youth for Climate and Extinction Rebellion, marched down the same path as the models, causing a stir in the audience, a Reuters witness said.

She climbed onto the catwalk set up in the Louvre art gallery even as models were showing off the latest styles, before being wrestled to the ground and hustled away by security guards.

Extinction Rebellion, Amis de la Terre and Youth For Climate said in a statement that around 30 people were involved in planning the protest, with two arrested.

They called on the government to enforce ""an immediate cut in production levels in the sector, given that 42 items of clothing were sold per person in France in 2019"".

Amis de la Terre France said it targeted the LVMH-owned label to throw a spotlight on the issue of overconsumption. ""LVMH is the world leader of luxury and has a responsibility when it comes to trends that push the textile industry to constantly renew collection faster and produce more,"" Alma Dufour, a group spokesperson, told Reuters.

In the front row, French cinema stars Catherine Deneuve and Isabelle Huppert hardly flinched, while some members of the Arnault clan, seated next to LVMH chief executive officer and chairman Bernard Arnault, glanced at each other.

The disruption hardly interrupted the flow of models who charged down the cobblestoned runway in a corridor of the Louvre to dramatic organ music punctuated with bell tolls.

Louis Vuitton did not immediately comment on the incident when contacted by AFP.

The show itself had a punk flavour, with sleeves ripped off suit jackets, leaving arms bare, and accessories including studded boots and chainmail headpieces.

The division of has appointed Matteo de Rosa as its new managing director. The Italian executive has a wealth of experience in the luxury industry, having worked in the sector in Europe, China and Australia. He succeeds Daniel Peterlin who, since the division was first set up in 2015, has developed it into the luxury group's prime hub for sourcing high-grade raw materials and for disseminating exclusive craft skills. Peterlin will leave his post in mid-December.

Previously, de Rosa worked for nearly six years for Chinese-Canadian ready-to-wear label , of which he became managing director in 2016, and then for the Kennedy Luxury Group in Australia, as head of Fashion & Lifestyle and commercial director. Early in his business career, de Rosa had founded leather goods label Sartie.

LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton released their Q3 performance earlier this week on October 12, 2021, reporting a 46 per cent increase in revenue compared to 2020. This translates to a €44.2 billion revenue for the world’s leading luxury group in the first nine months of 2021.

In terms of organic revenue growth for its Q3, LVMH achieved a 40 per cent growth compared to 2020, and an 11 per cent growth compared to 2019. Between the months of July to September 2021, the luxury group had revenues of €15.51 billion and this figure (11 per cent) corresponds to those in the first half of 2021. The United States and Asia continued to see double-digit growth.

Notably, the group’s Fashion & Leather Goods businesses posted a 38 per cent organic growth when using 2019 as a benchmark. This exceptional growth of this business unit can be attributed to LVMH’s powerhouses such as Louis Vuitton and Christian Dior. The former is celebrating its 200th anniversary of the birth of its founder.

A slew of initiatives was planned across the year and this helped to keep the brand a constant conversation point. Artistic Director of Louis Vuitton menswear, Virgil Abloh’s many collaborations also helped the Maison to remain popular.

At Christian Dior, its latest fashion shows in Athens, Paris and Shanghai were all well-received by many. Maria Grazia Chiuri’s collections continue to appeal to fans and with the added star power of its global ambassador, Jisoo from Blackpink, the brand is showing exceptional momentum.

On the menswear side, Kim Jones’ collaboration with Travis Scott marked the return of physical runways when it debuted the Spring/Summer 2022 collection. Social media was buzzing and searches for the brand drastically increased during the period. At the other Maisons, Celine, Fendi, Loewe and Marc Jacobs have all performed very well.

For the Watches & Jewellery business group, LVMH recorded a modest 4 per cent organic revenue growth for the first nine months of 2021 when compared to 2019. The figure balloons to 49 per cent when compared to 2020. The heart of this business unit would definitely be Tiffany & Co. which has recently undergone a structural change within its management level. The most visible change would be the American jeweller’s communication strategy: “Not Your Mother’s Tiffany” advertising campaign and the high-profile celebrity feature of Beyoncé and Jay-Z.

Its other brands, such as Bvlgari, Chaumet and TAG Heuer have all been slowly getting back to action. Bvlgari’s High Jewellery collection, Magnifica and its Serpenti creations received wide-spread recognition when celebrities wore it to various red carpets such as Zendeya wearing the 93-carats diamond serpent necklace to the Venice International Film Festival. While TAG Heuer’s limited-edition Super Mario smartwatch gained the attention of gaming enthusiasts.

LVMH’s overall growth for this quarter also signals that Chinese President Xi Jinping’s call for “common prosperity” has had no impact on the sales of its products across the different business units. When first announced that a crackdown will be carried out on the ultra-rich in China, many investors feared and the luxury sector would lose its major engine of growth. Shares for LVMH and its competitors fell dramatically in the wake of President Xi’s speech.

Over the past few months, governments around the world have accepted Covid-19 to be endemic in the population and have slowly started to open up its markets. As that is the context, LVMH is confident that it will continue its growth momentum. “LVMH is counting on the dynamic nature of its brands and the talent of its teams to further strengthen its global leadership position in luxury goods once again in 2021.”

LVMH kicks off £210m-plus UK and France media pitch - Campaign US,"Thu, 28 Oct 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNhbXBhaWdubGl2ZS5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS9sdm1oLWtpY2tzLW9mZi0yMTBtLXBsdXMtdWstZnJhbmNlLW1lZGlhLXBpdGNoLzE3MzE2NjfSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"French luxury goods giant LVMH has begun a review of its media business in the UK and France – two of its largest markets, Campaign understands.

The review will place MediaCom on notice, but is a straight shoot-out between the Group M agency and Publicis.

Publicis won a pan-European review in 2019 that did not involve the UK and France, the latter being where the company has its headquarters.

Dentsu handles LVMH media in Italy, which is not part of the pitch.

A hybrid Group M team handles LVMH's media in France, meaning that this pitch is about whether Publicis can wrestle the rest of the European media business away from Group M.

The stakes are huge. In the UK, Campaign estimates LVMH spends about €100m (£84m) on media each year; in France the figure is above €160m (£135m).

The review is designed to consolidate media spend from two key European markets not covered by the previous review, Campaign understands.

It includes media planning, buying and optimisation and covers all 75 brands in the LVMH stable.

One interesting aspect of the review is what will happen with the media planning and buying of LVMH’s latest acquisition, Tiffany & Co. In the UK, that is handled currently by MediaCom’s sister agency, Wavemaker.

Some of the better-known brands in the world’s largest luxury goods group include Louis Vuitton, Dior, Moët Hennessy, Tag Heuer, Tiffany, Givenchy, Marc Jacobs and Kenzo.

The group posted annual global revenues of €44.7bn (£38bn) in sales in 2020, which was down 17% on the previous year due to Covid. The group is estimated to spend about $6bn (£5.1bn) on global marketing each year.

Campaign approached IDComms, which is handling the process, for comment, but it declined.

None of the agencies involved would comment on the review, which Campaign understands started this week.

Recently, Omnicom won the global media-buying account of Chanel in a competitive pitch, ending a 20-year relationship with WPP."
LVMH acquires perfumer Officine Universelle Buly 1803 - GlobalCosmeticsNews,"Fri, 08 Oct 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmdsb2JhbGNvc21ldGljc25ld3MuY29tL2x2bWgtYWNxdWlyZXMtcGVyZnVtZXItb2ZmaWNpbmUtdW5pdmVyc2VsbGUtYnVseS0xODAzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"THE WHAT? Luxury group LVMH has acquired French perfume company Officine Universelle Buly 1803.

THE DETAILS The buy out comes four years after LVMH made an initial investment in the perfumer via its minority investment fund LVMH Luxury Ventures.

The perfumer will join 75 other Maisons under LVMH, and is said to be ‘recognized for the quality of its products (in perfumes, face and body care, among others), the diversity of its universe, and the passion that this brand arouses,’ according to a statement.

THE WHY? LVMH’s acquisition is said to be the ‘next chapter’ in Buly’s history, with the luxury giant set to help it pursue growth and overseas expansion.

Bernard Arnault, Chairman and CEO of the LVMH Group, said, “Buly perfectly matches the philosophy that we find in the Maisons of the LVMH Group, combining an unparalleled heritage, craftsmanship and a unique experience in exceptional boutiques. Its refined products enjoy a significant success around the world and we will do everything we can to ensure that this great family entrepreneurial adventure, led by Victoire de Taillac and Ramdane Touhami, continues to grow within the LVMH family.”"
LVMH Celebrates Experts in Craft at IME Apprenticeship Ceremony - Yahoo Life,"Tue, 19 Oct 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnlhaG9vLmNvbS9saWZlc3R5bGUvbHZtaC1jZWxlYnJhdGVzLWV4cGVydHMtY3JhZnQtaW1lLTIwMzE1NTI4My5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS — “We pretended to have the know-how but it was all make-believe. But what I try to teach her is that you need a craft, not a job,” said French actress Nathalie Baye, standing on the stage of the Théâtre des Champs-Elysées surrounded by emerging and confirmed talents of the Institut des Métiers d’Excellence, the training program put in place by LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton in 2014.

The actress was speaking at the end of the “Show Me” event, where an extract of her latest film, “Haute Couture,” was shown. In it, she plays a chief seamstress at Dior — which supported the film by providing dresses and access to its archives — on the cusp of retirement who is moved to teach her craft to a young pickpocket, played by French-Algerian actress Lyna Khoudri.

Students from partnering middle schools in the IME’s “Excellent!” program will have previews of the film, ahead of its Nov. 10 release in cinemas.

“The spirit of the film summarizes what moves us at the [IME],” said Chantal Gaemperle, LVMH’s group executive vice president, human resources and synergies, introducing the two-act event with the reminder that luxury, beyond its glittering facade, was supported by know-how that needs to be preserved.

“We are in a theater… it’s these women and men who are the main actors of this ceremony,” she said, describing the program as a “live, oral magazine” on the skills in the group, as told by the artisans, designers and executives who took turns on stage to explain their paths.

Among them were Gaemperle herself, who nodded to her homeland of Switzerland where apprenticeship is successful and strongly encouraged as a path; fourth-year watchmaking apprentice Antoine Metral, who works at Bulgari and his tutor Eric Cart-Lamy, who is in charge of the training center for Hublot, and Bertrand Tefra, the chief operating officer of Parfums Christian Dior, who spoke about an ailing factory bought by the perfume house and which has since been turned around.

Alexandre Boquel, the group’s director of development of the métiers d’excellence, delighted the room by recounting how he got his start in the group as an intern selling ties at Le Bon Marché, where he realized the chain of crafts involved in the strip of fabric in his hands — and was put off wearing them for good.

Nicolas Ghesquière, in a conversation with Louis Vuitton’s head of atelier Mario Lefranc, characterized his seven-year tenure at the creative helm of the brand’s women’s collections as an experience of learning, where “creative vision is only beautiful when it is shared.”

“The success of this group which I founded in the 1990s relies on the success of our products… which rest upon your desire to make them ever better,” said LVMH’s chief executive officer Bernard Arnault, adding that success was founded on desire itself and that long-term desirability was the essential motor which “counted more than results.”

Insisting on the role of artisanal excellence in the image of France, he thanked the artisans and those who had worked toward the group’s success, although “in the offices… we do a lot of paper and not a lot of product,” he quipped.

“I love going into ateliers and stores, rather than watching through a screen. Working over Zoom, you lose the contact of the product. In our [fields], reality and being on the ground is important,” he concluded.

France’s labor minister Elisabeth Borne addressed the craftspeople in the room as “the country’s pride,” telling them they illustrated the “cultural shift that we defend with [French President Emmanuel Macron], where we wanted to give apprenticeship its nobility through reforms [of educational tracks],” aiming at combating unemployment, particularly among youths.

Beyond kicking off the eighth year of IME and its 339 new apprentices, the occasion served to distinguish the “Virtuoses LVMH,” a worldwide group of 66 craftspeople considered virtuoso in their field. Thirty-eight of them were present at the event and were presented with an “IME” pin specially created by Bulgari.

After thunderous applause for the IME students and their predecessors, the event spilled out into the concourses of the theater, where booths highlighted the professions taught at the institute.

“I didn’t even know my job existed until I practiced it. I can’t wait to share it with as many as possible,” said Sophie Estève, a stylist specialized in prints working alongside Guillaume Henry at Patou, standing between an eyewear specialist and a vineyard worker demonstrating how she pruned a grapevine.

Other initiatives highlighted the outreach programs and partnerships LVMH is involved in.

The Prix des Artisanes, created in collaboration with French Elle’s fashion, food and decoration editions, supported by France’s National Conservatory of Arts and Crafts and the Chamber of Trades and Crafts, will focus on the contribution of female craftspeople to the preservation of French patrimony.

La Fabrique Nomade, which helps migrant and refugee artisans continue their careers in France, showcased its first collaboration, between female artisans and artist Jérémy Gobé on the topic of coral preservation. It will be exhibited at the FIAC art fair that opens on Thursday in Paris.

“If there is something beyond career perspectives and hope, it’s that [all this] is about humans. The company wouldn’t be what it is without the women and the men — not just creative directors and CEOs — but throughout the whole hierarchy,” said Gaemperle, adding that giving the incoming class “a glimpse of what their predecessors have achieved and of the community will join is the best message we can give them.”

LVMH's Tiffany Is on the Right Track - The Business of Fashion,"Wed, 13 Oct 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzb2ZmYXNoaW9uLmNvbS9vcGluaW9ucy9sdXh1cnkvbHZtaHMtdGlmZmFueS1pcy1vbi10aGUtcmlnaHQtdHJhY2sv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LVMH’s Tiffany reboot is working, delivering what the group called a “remarkable performance” in its third quarter results.

The revamp certainly hit the ground running. Following its acquisition of the American jeweller in January 2021, LVMH lost no time in appointing a heavyweight management team, speed being a vital ingredient in successful M&A and brand turnarounds.

Chairman Michael Burke, one of Bernard Arnault’s most trusted lieutenants, is surely applying lessons learned at Louis Vuitton to sell ‘exclusive’ products by the millions of units. CEO Anthony Ledru brings almost 15 years of experience working not only for Vuitton, but for some of the top fine jewellery companies in the world: Cartier, Harry Winston and Tiffany itself. Meanwhile, Alexandre Arnault, EVP of product and communication, is largely onboard to bring millennials to the brand through blockbuster collaborations and a new brand identity, much as he did at Rimowa. In March, Tiffany & Co also announced a new creative director: Ruba Abu-Nimah, a jewellery outsider and a wild card worthy of a “big bang” revival.

‘Shock and awe’ marketing

ADVERTISEMENT

Since then installing its new team, Tiffany has deployed an effective “shock & awe” communication strategy, dusting off the company’s brand image. It started in July 2021 with a provocative guerilla-style campaign. The slogan — “Not your mother’s Tiffany” — appeared on posters plastered around New York and Los Angeles featuring denim-clad models wearing the brand’s edgiest pieces, a clear rupture with Tiffany’s past and a nod to the zeitgeist. Social media response was divided: some saw it as a “dis” to loyal customers, but it certainly succeeded in grabbing attention.

Tiffany has also begun to emphasise its high-end products, in sharp contrast to some of its past communications, bolstering perception that the jeweller is a legitimate luxury brand. The brand “broke the internet” with its August 2021 ‘’About Love’' campaign, its most visible piece of marketing since the reboot, featuring Beyoncé and Jay-Z, a rarely-seen Basquiat painting from 1982 whose dominant colour closely resembles Tiffany’s signature blue and the 128.54-carat Tiffany Diamond, one of the largest yellow diamonds ever discovered. (The Tiffany Diamond, which has only been worn by five women — among them Audrey Hepburn and Lady Gaga — will also appear on the big screen in February 2022, worn by Gal Gadot in Death on the Nile)

To further highlight the stone, Tiffany has turned its April Fool’s joke (a yellow rebranding of the iconic Tiffany blue) into the theme of a new pop-up concept: currently on Rodeo Drive, but soon to travel the world, the store features the Tiffany Diamond itself, along with yellow furniture, yellow bags and a Yellow Diamond Café serving yellow-hued turmeric lattes and honeycomb ice cream.

LVMH has also pushed Tiffany online with new vigor. The new campaigns have been heavily promoted on social media, with Tiffany seeing an 8 percent increase in Instagram uploads in Q3 versus Q2 2021, more than double hard luxury peers.

While Tiffany is currently gaining followers at a slower rate than Bulgari, Van Cleef & Arpels and Cartier, the brand is among the top jewellery brands on Instagram (12.6 million followers) and new campaigns and ambassadors should boost these metrics.

Indeed, new brand ambassadors are at the core of Tiffany’s rebranding. In the age of influencers, the use of actors, musicians and athletes seems an old-fashioned marketing strategy. However, Tiffany & Co. has chosen well, drafting in the likes of British tennis star Emma Raducanu, alongside Jay-Z and Beyoncé. In terms of marketing ROI, ambassadors are as important as all the other media channels taken together, generating on average almost half of total media impact for luxury brands.

Luxury houses have, over time, used association with the arts as a way to upgrade their brand positions and enrich their brand equity. Tiffany debuted a collaboration with popular artist Daniel Arsham on September 6, 2021, to recontextualise its iconic blue box and launch its Tiffany Knot collection. The resulting Bronze Eroded Tiffany Blue Box — building on Arsham’s signature “Future Relics” series — updates Tiffany’s packaging for the 21st century and is available for purchase in limited edition.

New products

Tiffany needed to fill the $2,000 to $10,000 price range with more design jewellery and the September launch of its Knot collection did just that. While it only features 23 products at the moment, the core of the collection is priced in the $2,000-to-$10,000 sweet spot. Adding more design jewellery is bound to increase both space productivity and operating margin. In fact, our analysis suggests that gross margin can be significantly higher for design jewellery (where the cost of precious metals is marked up about 10x) than with stone jewellery, Tiffany’s original focus.

Tiffany is also benefiting from market tailwinds. Jewellery is the fastest growing segment in personal luxury goods, expanding by 10% CAGR in the 5 years leading up to the pandemic. What’s more, fine jewellery has been one of the most resilient categories during the Covid-19 crisis because hard luxury is seen as both an investment and a collectible item by consumers. The smaller price premiums on watches and jewellery also mean the category benefits more from spending repatriation to China compared to other categories. And, in the short term, pent-up demand for weddings and other events will provide a further boost for jewellery sales.

There remains much for LVMH to do. But the group seems to have taken a page from Kering’s playbook (as well as its own) in implementing a “big bang” revival at Tiffany. It’s a recipe based on mixing creativity (the ability to come up with strong new creative ideas that resonate with the zeitgeist but link to the brand DNA), commercial acumen (the ability to articulate these ideas into a commercially smart collection and pricing architecture) and entrepreneurial courage (the ability to go “full in” with all the company functions and resource to support the new creative and commercial ideas.

LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton today reported revenues of €44.2 billion for the first nine months of 2021, a rise of +46% year-on-year. Organic revenue growth over the period was +40% compared to 2020, and +11% compared to 2019, with trends in the third quarter (+ 11%) comparable to those of the first half, both by activity and by region.

In Selective Retailing, which includes DFS – the company jointly held by LVMH and Robert Miller (the company’s Co-Founder) – along with Sephora and Starboard Cruise Services, reported a +13% rise in organic revenue year-on-year, but the figure was down -23% compared to 2019.

“DFS remained heavily constrained by the very limited recovery in international travel to most destinations. La Samaritaine, which reopened in June following an ambitious renovation, is enjoying a promising start,” said LVMH.

The Wines & Spirits business group recorded organic revenue growth of +30% in the first nine months of 2021 compared to the same period of 2020 and +10% compared to 2019. Champagne volumes were up +7% compared to the first nine months of 2019. Growth was particularly strong in the US and Europe, which notably benefited over the Summer from the reopening of restaurants and the gradual recovery of tourism.

Hennessy Cognac performed well with a +4% increase in volumes compared to 2019 while being limited by supply constraints. China and the US experienced a strong rebound. The third quarter marked the integration for the first time of Champagne Maison Armand de Brignac, in which LVMH has taken a 50% stake.

Led by Louis Vuitton and Christian Dior, the Fashion & Leather Goods business group recorded organic revenue growth of +57% in the first nine months of 2021 compared to the same period of 2020 and +38% compared to 2019. Growth in the third quarter of 2021 remained “exceptional” compared to the third quarter of 2020, which marked a return to growth after a declining first half of 2020.

The Perfumes & Cosmetics business group recorded organic revenue growth of +30% over the first nine months of 2021 compared to the same period of 2020. On an organic basis, revenue was down -2% compared to the first nine months of 2019. LVMH hailed the performance of Christian Dior, buoyed by the success of the new Miss Dior edp and Sauvage Elixir. Guerlain enjoyed an “excellent performance”, driven by Abeille Royale and Orchidée Impériale.

The Watches & Jewelry business group recorded organic revenue growth of +49% in the first nine months of 2021 compared to the same period of 2020 and +4% compared to 2019 (excluding Tiffany, which was consolidated for the first time in 2021). Tiffany enjoyed a “remarkable performance”, said LVMH, particularly in its major market, the USA. Bvlgari rolled out its new line of high jewellery, Magnifica, among other highlights."

The Hollywood A-list descended on Venice this weekend for the nuptials of French society couple Alexandre Arnault and Géraldine Guyot, with Beyoncé, Jay-Z and Pharrell Williams all in attendance.

Alexandre is the second son of LVMH boss Bernard Arnault, one of the richest men in the world, among the likes of Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk. The 29-year-old works for his father's company, as executive vice president at fine jewellers Tiffany & Co, and previously worked at luggage brand Rimowa. His wife is also in the fashion business, and is the founder of the accessories brand D'Estrëe - with many of the celebrity contingent being fans of her designs.

The bride wore a stunning high-neck lace gown, featuring a full skirt and long sleeves, with her long blonde hair elegantly pinned in a low chignon, with a long veil attached. She was photographed alongside milliner Stephen Jones, as well as her father, ahead of the ceremony. Meanwhile her adorable flower girls and page boys wore matching white and burgundy outfits, with flower crowns for the girls and corsages for the boys."
Bernard Arnault – 'Paris is booming' - Financial Times,"Tue, 12 Oct 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZ0LmNvbS9jb250ZW50LzhjMzFlZTFmLWMzNjgtNGZlOC05MWQwLTAwMWZhYjk1NGNiOdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Print this page

When I ask Bernard Arnault what his primary concern is about the Cheval Blanc – the hotel that forms part of his €750m redevelopment of the Samaritaine building in central Paris – his answer is typically emphatic. He wants it to be “the best”.

“Best” is a favourite word of the chairman and chief executive of the LVMH group. It punctuates his every sentence. It is also the standard by which he compares the 75 brands in the LVMH stable, including the fashion houses Dior, Givenchy and Louis Vuitton and the drinks brands Moët & Chandon, Hennessy and Château d’Yquem (the last dates back to 1593). It also includes the suitcase maker Rimowa, acquired in 2016, the fine-jewellery brand Bulgari and the watchmaker TAG Heuer. He expects each to be the best.

The Cheval Blanc brand began life in Courchevel in 2006 as a boutique, seasonal 34-room ski resort. It now consists of five properties, including this new Paris outpost in the deco section of the landmark building on the Seine. The project has been 15 years in the making and marks a city debut for the hotel group better known for exotic faraway locales. It’s an interesting development for LVMH, which also acquired Belmond in 2019 for $3.2bn. Is this Arnault’s bid to conquer the hospitality market? Or simply to become the best hotelier in the world?

“The goal is not to do a big chain with Cheval Blanc,” says the 72-year-old over breakfast. A slight, 6ft presence with a looming statesmanlike authority, Arnault arrived at the hotel for our appointed meeting at exactly 8.30am. “We don’t need to be a group with 50 hotels. We want to concentrate on being the best – to have the best location, the best team, the best interior design, the best architecture. And this takes time. We are not in any rush.”

La Samaritaine was founded by Ernest Cognacq as a small apparel shop in 1870, and expanded over the next few decades to become the sprawling temple to art nouveau and art deco – as well as commerce – it is recognised as today. After safety issues were discovered in the building, and decades of financial losses, the store was closed in 2005: five years later LVMH took full control. It was only while redeveloping the original department store that Arnault was inspired to build a hotel on the Seine side of the building when he realised that its greatest asset was its uninterrupted views.

The completed Cheval Blanc opened in early September following months of Covid-19 delays. It has 72 suites, four restaurants and a spa, with suites costing from €1,150, but today Arnault is unveiling the hotel’s most exclusive residence: a 1,000sq m apartment incorporating seven bedrooms, a vast living area, marbled bathrooms and a private gym. Called The Apartment, it will cost tens of thousands per night.

The world is different. But I think the economy is going to boom”

The Apartment has secure and independent street access, a team of dedicated staff ready to tend to every ministration, and – the kicker – a substantial private pool. The hotel already has a guest pool in its basement, surrounded by a dazzling video map conceived by the artist Oyoram. By contrast, the apartment’s aquatic facility is more modest, but it does boast a picture window through which bathers can admire the Sacré-Coeur. The apartment, like the hotel and a vast number of other LVMH-owned buildings, was designed by the architect Peter Marino and it contains an inventory of museum-quality artworks. A James Siena painting, Ssonsunurrhth, hangs in the library, alongside a sculpture, Bull, by William Byl. The living suite is furnished with a Steinway grand piano – Arnault is himself an accomplished player, and his second wife, Hélène Mercier, is a concert pianist (she sometimes plays with her sons Alexandre, an executive vice president at Tiffany and Chopin enthusiast, and Frédéric, CEO of TAG Heuer and the fourth of Arnault’s five children). In the apartment dining room, an abstract painting, T1989-L42 by Hans Hartung, hangs over a row of citrine-yellow chairs. A gilded guardrail of flowers unfurls along a stairwell: commissioned in addition to a loveseat and two sculptures, Arnault explains proudly, it represents some of the final work undertaken, in 2018, by the artist Claude Lalanne.

The deco details such as the window casements, which were all listed, have preserved the building’s historic integrity, while the prestigious furnishings lend everything a just-so, very contemporary air. “We asked Peter Marino to design the inside as though it were a private home,” says Arnault of the light-filled decor. “And you can see that in the rhythm of the rooms. You may have, also, access to the top terrace, where you can do cocktails and other things. I think it is the best experience in town.”

Arnault stands suddenly. “We should go on the terrace for one minute.” He leads me to a spacious terrace revealing a 360-degree panorama that shimmers under a blue sky hung with perfect cumulus clouds. Here is Paris delivered in a cinematic landscape where the Bastille, the Seine, the Louvre and Montmartre are laid out in one great gulp of Stendhal-inducing wow.

It also illustrates quite deftly the sweep of Arnault’s power. To the left is the Louis Vuitton headquarters, the house which contributes the majority share of the group’s revenues, reported to be €44.7bn in 2020. Earlier this year, Arnault’s personal fortune was estimated to be $194bn, a number that has since grown bigger to earn him the sometime title of richest human in the world. To the right is the Louvre, the world’s most visited museum, which has been hosting LV fashion shows amid its priceless relics since Nicolas Ghesquière first staged a womenswear collection in the Cour Marly in September 2017. And across the river stand the charred remains of Notre-Dame. In the aftermath of the fire that devastated the cathedral in 2019, Arnault pledged a €200m donation towards its restoration (doubling that pledged by his arch rival, Kering CEO François-Henri Pinault). Just beside Notre-Dame, on the Tribunal de Commerce, a giant advertising hoarding promotes the LVMH-owned Celine.

Aside from being a stunning building, the Samaritaine has become a symbol. It’s a marvel: the art nouveau façades, cast-iron signs and glass-filled atrium that first characterised the department store have been painstakingly restored. It’s a social enterprise: the development also contains 96 low-cost housing units, a nursery and office space that have been built alongside the hotel and store. It’s a place of civic pride: since the reopening, the Samaritaine has seen an average of 35,000 visitors daily walking through its doors. And it’s a morale boost for the city, which, following the Bataclan and Charlie Hebdo massacres, the tumult of the gilets jaunes demonstrations, the Notre Dame catastrophe and 18 months of pandemic, is finally emerging from a long period of disquiet. “It’s a symbol of the reopening of Paris,” says Arnault. “It’s a symbol of a return to normal life.”

The same observation is made by Olivier Lefebvre, chief executive of the Cheval Blanc group, and as jolly and avuncular as Arnault is cool and lean. “We have had a very nice surprise with the occupancy and in the bookings for the restaurants,” he says as he briskly marches through the Le Tout-Paris restaurant, with its graphic 1980s carpet and Roger Capron coffee tables, along the handcarved, burned, brushed and varnished wall of wine vault inside the Plénitude restaurant and through the warren of beauty treatment rooms, where the scent of Cheval Blanc, a bespoke fragrance made by Dior Parfums, gently mists the air. “The local clientele has been very present as guests, even among those staying at the hotel,” adds Lefebvre. “Overall the market is doing quite well again – Paris has experienced a good return.”

When the project was first conceived, it was probably anticipated that a lot more foreign tourists would be here. I wonder to what extent the pandemic has derailed the plan? “The Americans are coming back gradually, but not the Chinese, not a lot of countries,” says Arnault of the challenges faced by the hospitality industry. “But, you know, tourism is important but you should not overestimate it. When Covid arrived and we saw, for the luxury activities, that the Chinese were not going to travel, we thought it might be difficult. But, in fact, the Chinese started buying in their own country, and we compensated for what we lost on the tourism of people buying in Paris, or for the loss in airport sales.” If the absence of Asian tourists in Europe is a situation, it’s not something that is causing Arnault undue stress. “I don’t think there will be one tourist coming to Paris that will not want to see Samaritaine, both the department store or the hotel,” he says of his expectations for the future. “For 15 years, this plaza was completely empty. Now, you see, it’s full of life.”

Arnault insists on thinking long term about his investments. And shoring up different assets around the world. “We don’t have the constraints of the stock market value every quarter. And it is the same thing for my brands. I always say to people working in the company, you should not look at the profitability. Profitability is a consequence of work done well, and a consequence of desirability of the product. And so too for this project. We were not looking at immediate profitability. We were looking at taking advantage of the beauty of this historic architecture and the fantastic location just in the middle of Paris. Because, you know, a project like this could not have been done by anybody. It took us 15 years of investment, with no profit at that time.”

It’s arguable that Covid-19 has done much to rehabilitate Arnault’s reputation. Early on in the pandemic, the group was quick to pivot its resources to help make hand sanitiser where there was a shortfall. He was also instrumental in securing a supply chain through which France could secure more PPE. That the company remains in France, employs some 170,000 people (a number increasing by 10,000 every year, according to Arnault), and manufactures mostly French-made products is something that the country might regard with patriotic pride. “I think people know that the group is good for the country,” says Arnault, who last night had dinner with Sergio Mattarella, the president of Italy, and President Macron. “Good for durability and good for the people. They know the group as a whole is good for France.”

Does he think, as predicted by some financial analysts, we’re about to enter the Roaring Twenties? It would be fitting after all, considering the Samaritaine was the archetypal Twenties building the first time they roared around. “I think there will be a high level of optimism when all this is finished and things return to normal,” replies Arnault. “And there is an appetite for high-quality goods, yes. In perfume, for instance, what is striking is the success of the very special perfume made by Christian Dior. It’s more expensive. It’s more unique. You can personalise your perfume, and the success of it is incredible. And what is interesting, because I was reviewing it only yesterday, is that the clientele is maybe 10 years younger than the clientele for the very famous brands like J’adore or Miss Dior.” He is cautiously optimistic about the future. “I think the world is different,” he continues. “But I think the economy is going to boom.”

In his own life, however, it’s business as usual. Arnault is already focused on a new Cheval Blanc in Beverly Hills, there are meetings with other foreign presidents to schedule, and he longs to travel so that he can check in on his many hundreds of retail points around the world. Being static doesn’t really suit him; he is frustrated by Zoom meetings and he likes to address people face-to-face. It seems ironic that beyond his customary blue Dior suits and shirts with monogrammed initials, one of the chief architects of modern luxury appears to thrive most in the un-luxuriously relentless business of hard work.

His description of the Cheval Blanc brand as a “couture house” leads me to wonder which specific personalisations he might request of his own hotel. His answer is almost disappointingly normal. For all the wealth of services at his disposal, the thing Arnault values most significantly when he travels is some peace and quiet. “And then in the room,” he adds, “I care about the light. Sometimes in the hotel, you switch off the light and you see something blinking. Or a TV or something. I don’t like this.”

It’s a thought you might wish to savour, if you find yourself checking into the Cheval Blanc. Peter Marino may have created the most aspirational of environments. But you probably have Arnault to thank for the bedroom’s blackout switch.

Loro Piana Names New CEO - Yahoo Finance,"Thu, 28 Oct 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQmh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9sb3JvLXBpYW5hLW5hbWVzLWNlby0wOTA4MTgzMzQuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Damien Bertrand has been named chief executive officer of Loro Piana, effective Nov. 15, WWD has learned.

A rising talent within LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, Bertrand is currently managing director at Christian Dior Couture in Paris, collaborating closely with creative and management teams across its women’s, men’s and children’s wear businesses.

More from WWD

Bertrand succeeds Fabio d’Angelantonio, who is leaving Loro Piana after five years at the management helm.

According to an internal announcement seen by WWD, Bertrand is to “lead a new phase of evolution at Loro Piana and the development of new product categories,” while ensuring the maison stays true to its “extraordinary fabrics and understated elegance.”

In recent years, d’Angelantonio has steered the Italian brand in a younger direction, recently asking Hiroshi Fujiwara of Fragment fame to design a capsule collection for Loro Piana, a first for the brand.

Toni Belloni, group managing director at LVMH, said Bertrand has “shown the ability to deliver great results through his sense of product excellence, daring ideas and commitment to brand desirability.

“He is a well-rounded leader, able to get the best from people, while maintaining a strong team spirit,” Belloni added.

Antoine Arnault, chairman of Loro Piana, thanked d’Angelantonio for “steering the transformation of Loro Piana from a family business to an LVMH maison, with great respect for its heritage and passion.”

Arnault also credited him for “leading performance improvement and the modernization of key functions and products.”

LVMH acquired an 80 percent stake in Loro Piana for 2 billion euros in 2013.

Bertrand joined Dior in 2016 from L’Oréal group, where he held successive roles for over eighteen years, including chief executive officer of L’Oréal U.K.; president of Maybelline New York, and ceo of L’Oréal Brazil.

Story continues

A graduate of elite French school HEC, he began his career at LVMH in 1998 as Guerlain’s marketing director for Australia.

LVMH has a strong track record of grooming executives from within, particularly at star brands Dior and Louis Vuitton.

The result delivered a 13% leap (+9% reported) for the period year-on-year, but this was down by 23% (organic) versus the same period in 2019.

While Sephora returned to its 2019 level of activity, grew its online revenue and expanded distribution links despite the tough commercial environment (which resulted in the closure of several stores), DFS Group remained ‘heavily constrained’ by the ‘very limited recovery in international travel to most destinations’.

GROUP REVENUE LIFTS 40% YOY

As reported, Samaritaine Paris Pont-Neuf by DFS unveiled in June dovetailing with the re-opening of the iconic La Samaritaine department store in the heart of central Paris (to view a picture gallery, click here), shortly before LVMH posted its half-year 2021 results.

The Bernault Arnault fronted luxury goods giant earned €44,177 million in the first nine months of 2021, up 46% (reported) year-on-year.

Organic revenue growth was +40% year-on-year and +11% compared to the same period in 2019.

Trends in the third quarter (+11%) were comparable to those in the first half, both by activity and by region.

“Within the context of a gradual exit from the health crisis, the Group is confident in the continuation of the current growth; it will maintain a strategy focused on continuously strengthening the desirability of its brands, by relying on the authenticity and quality of its products, the excellence of their distribution and the reactivity of its organisation,” LVMH Group said in a statement.

“LVMH is counting on the dynamic nature of its brands and the talent of its teams to further strengthen its global leadership position in luxury goods once again in 2021.”"

The review will place MediaCom on notice, but is a straight shoot-out between the Group M agency and Publicis.

Publicis won a pan-European review in 2019 that did not involve the UK and France, the latter being where the company has its headquarters.

Dentsu handles LVMH media in Italy, which is not part of the pitch.

A hybrid Group M team handles LVMH's media in France, meaning that this pitch is about whether Publicis can wrestle the rest of the European media business away from Group M.

The stakes are huge. In the UK, Campaign estimates LVMH spends about €100m (£84m) on media each year; in France the figure is above €160m (£135m).

The review is designed to consolidate media spend from two key European markets not covered by the previous review, Campaign understands.

It includes media planning, buying and optimisation and covers all 75 brands in the LVMH stable.

One interesting aspect of the review is what will happen with the media planning and buying of LVMH’s latest acquisition, Tiffany & Co. In the UK, that is handled currently by MediaCom’s sister agency, Wavemaker.

Some of the better-known brands in the world’s largest luxury goods group include Louis Vuitton, Dior, Moët Hennessy, Tag Heuer, Tiffany, Givenchy, Marc Jacobs and Kenzo.

The group posted annual global revenues of €44.7bn (£38bn) in sales in 2020, which was down 17% on the previous year due to Covid. The group is estimated to spend about $6bn (£5.1bn) on global marketing each year.

Campaign approached IDComms, which is handling the process, for comment, but it declined.

None of the agencies involved would comment on the review, which Campaign understands started this week.

Can Independent Brands Survive Without Luxury Conglomerates? - Jing Daily,"Tue, 05 Oct 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vamluZ2RhaWx5LmNvbS9wb3N0cy9pbmRlcGVuZGVudC1icmFuZHMtbHV4dXJ5LWNvbmdsb21lcmF0ZS1jaGluYdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"During the pandemic, the biggest luxury conglomerates have preserved their status quo and consolidated their assets through new acquisitions.

Chanel, Hermès, Burberry, Missoni, Salvatore Ferragamo, and Ermenegildo Zegna prove that family ownership and investments from private equity firms remain appealing alternatives to conglomerates.

The continued success of family-owned businesses depends on access to capital and affordable financing, the relationship they build with their customers over the years, their strategic adaptability to market volatility, and even the resilience of their supply chain.

With the COVID-19 pandemic wreaking havoc in retail and luxury, some brands might consider an association with a luxury conglomerate. Glossy rightfully highlights that “the ongoing pandemic has only increased conglomerates leverage over the industry, putting them in a perfect position to snap up even more struggling independent brands.”

Indeed, recent developments have pushed some independent brands into bankruptcies while others lost revenues because of an unexpected shutdown of consumer activity. On the other hand, the biggest luxury conglomerates have preserved their status quo and consolidated their assets through new acquisitions.

The simple answer is yes. Take, for example, Chanel, Hermès, Burberry, Missoni, Salvatore Ferragamo, and Ermenegildo Zegna. These independent global fashion brands prove that family ownership and investments from private equity firms remain appealing alternatives to Mamp;As and conglomerates.

While getting acquired by LVMH or Kering could be the path forward for many brands saddled with massive debt, not every problem can be solved with a merger or an acquisition. Moreover, many family-owned businesses are not open to conceding a controlling stake in their company in exchange for funding, know-how, and protection from market volatility. Sure enough, the continued success of family-owned businesses depends on access to capital and affordable financing, the relationships they build with their customers over the years, their strategic adaptability to market volatility, and even the resilience of their supply chains.

In 2012, Credit Suisse surveyed nearly 280 family businesses from the Family Business Network across 33 countries for research. On average, the respondents were representatives from large companies, some fourth-generation businesses or older. The research showed that during the 2011-2012 recession, family-owned businesses outperformed their competitors in revenue growth.

“In the midst of the tough economic climate, the majority experienced material revenue increases in the 12 months to June,” says the report. Indeed, around 60 percent of these companies registered increases of above 5 percent, and more than 10 percent of them saw increases of over 15 percent.

In China, Confucianism preaches the virtue of filial piety (孝, xiào). Accordingly, younger family members are bound to respect, honor, and obey the elderly. The same interaction is present in a family business. And while we encourage youngsters to find their path and develop personal skills in the West, the youth in China are motivated to seek continuity in family businesses.

In fact, a 2019 survey by PwC on Chinese family businesses showed that 42 percent of Chinese entrepreneurs plan to ensure their company's legacy by passing on its leadership or ownership to a next-generation family member.

Overall, this approach has led to high trust in family-owned businesses. Meanwhile, conglomerates have seen a decline in trust that's been linked to capitalist and corporate values. Accordingly, luxury companies that remain in family ownership might hold a special appeal in China, as they are associated with loyalty, trustworthiness, and family values. It also helps that some of the most successful Chinese companies are family-owned (Wanda Group, Amer International Group Ltd, etc.)

Overall, independent luxury brands can have a second life in a post-pandemic reality if they seize the opportunities that come within today's new retail environment and build a foundation based on shared values and beliefs."

Bulgari CEO Jean-Christophe Babin on driving growth in a post-pandemic future - The Peak Singapore,"Tue, 12 Oct 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXBlYWttYWdhemluZS5jb20uc2cvaW50ZXJ2aWV3cy93YXRjaGVzLXRpbWVwaWVjZXMtbHV4dXJ5LWJ1bGdhcmktaG90ZWwtcmVzb3J0L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"It is a sunny September morning in Geneva when Bulgari Group CEO Jean-Christophe Babin appears onscreen for our video interview. While he bears a relaxed demeanour and the telltale tan of a European summer, there’s no doubt it has been a busy year for the head of the Rome-headquartered luxury brand.

For one, the pandemic has upended the traditional watch-event calendar, giving rise instead to smaller events taking place throughout the year. This year, Bulgari participated in LVMH Watch Week in January, Watches and Wonders in April and the recently concluded Geneva Watch Days in August and September.

Recovery for Bulgari and its parent company LVMH is pretty positive, to say the least. In July, LVMH recorded a solid first-half performance, reporting organic revenue growth of 53 per cent compared to 2020 and 11 per cent compared to 2019. The report highlighted Bulgari’s “good growth in jewellery” and to this, Babin adds that “Bulgari is seeing double-digit growth in watches compared to 2019”. The CEO shares his thoughts on the changes in the watch industry and his plans for driving growth across territories and sectors.

Bulgari has been present at several key watch events throughout the year. Even post-pandemic, will this format be around?

Broadly speaking, we have five collections: Octo and Bulgari Bulgari for men, and Lucea, Serpenti and Diva for ladies. Each year, we also have several novelties in each of those collections. We group them into three different batches and release one of those three batches at each event. Organising new launches in batches allows us to focus on a few collections at a time.

If you show everything at one event, you can create confusion for retailers and the media. We try to make life simpler for everyone, including those in our workshops who cannot craft everything at the same time. More and more, we want to deliver what we show at the same time. This batch approach is a good way to execute the “see now, buy now” concept as it allows for a production sequence that’s consistent with the human resources behind the craftsmanship.

LVMH’s first-half results were excellent, and jewellery stood out as a growth driver. What have been Bulgari’s strongest growth areas and regions?

Mainland China remains very strong for us, as it is the main driver for the whole industry. Additionally, the US has demonstrated quite robust growth for us, which is a very good sign. Besides those two markets, the Middle East and Japan have also been performing very well. The most difficult remains Europe, where travel retail has suffered since travel was stopped.

According to many brands, China has been driving growth during the pandemic. How is Bulgari’s China business strategy different from the rest of the world?

We are perfectly aware of the strategic necessity of a good balance in terms of territories. This has always been our motto. During the pandemic, we have improved our processes in running the business differently. Despite the dominance of China, we do see growth in other regions. Our local events have ensured visibility and appeal in key markets, and we have been able to stay in touch with local clients.

Building e-commerce is one of your biggest priorities. What are your plans on this front?

E-commerce has allowed us to partially compensate for the loss of physical sales during the lockdown periods. The onset of the pandemic last year has been a powerful accelerator for developing our e-commerce platforms in almost all our markets. The challenge of e-commerce is to find the right balance with the physical, brick and mortar stores – to have a good mix of products and price points between the digital and physical channels. In hard luxury, it’s part of an omnichannel journey that often involves the stores, among many touchpoints.

You are also focused on developing Bulgari’s hotels. What is your outlook for travel and hospitality in the months and years to come?

The Bulgari Hotels & Resorts division is moving fast. We have several projects and openings in the pipeline, starting with Paris in a couple of months and then Rome, Tokyo, Moscow and Miami in 2022 and 2023. Other than Bali, the Bulgari hotels have not been too badly affected by the pandemic, welcoming local guests rather than international ones. Each offers a Bulgari-branded, exclusive immersive experience that is unlike anything else. Travel will resume a certain level of normality with ongoing vaccinations around the world, so we are extremely optimistic.

Is Fur Really Banished From Luxury Markets? - - HOLR Magazine,"Thu, 07 Oct 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vaG9scm1hZ2F6aW5lLmNvbS9pcy1mdXItcmVhbGx5LWJhbmlzaGVkLWZyb20tbHV4dXJ5LW1hcmtldHMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"French luxury conglomerate Kering recently banned the use of fur by all of its fashion brands. Meanwhile, Fendi, a label belonging to the world’s largest luxury group, LVMH, showed fur pieces in its latest collection, presented during Milan Fashion Week. Now the question remains: can fur really be banished from luxury markets?

Influenced by the urgent need to promote sustainability, as well as by veganism, and animal activism – all praising for a world where less and less products come from animal sources – some brands have chosen to stop using animal fur in their products. Kering, the French luxury conglomerate group, announced on September 24th its decision and commitment to go entirely fur-free. On the other hand, Fendi, a member of the rival LVMH group, had presented its Milan Fashion Week show – where a number of models walked the runway wearing fur pieces – just two days before Kering’s declaration.

In fact, Kering was never a seller of huge volumes of fur. Besides, most of the brands owned by the conglomerate had already committed to stop using animal fur: Gucci and Bottega Veneta for example had banished the material years ago. The only two Kering brands selling fur were Saint Laurent and Brioni. To François-Henri Pinault, Kering’s chief executive, fur is something “symbolic; it’s a material that was very much linked to the luxury industry historically”.

The group’s decision follows a larger market trend, with consumer demand and interest for the material declining over the past few years – a movement accelerated by the current Covid-19 pandemic – mainly due to social activism and governmental regulation. In 2019, the state of California became the first one to ban fur sales and production, and earlier this year, Israel made the same decision, becoming the first country to ever ban the material, with a few religious exceptions. On top of that, Kering’s fur banishment is also correlated to the group’s internal strategy of embracing ethics, sustainability, and environmental responsibility, as manners to approach today’s consumer’s mindset. “Through this lens, some materials have no place in luxury”, said Pinault.

But both LVMH and its brands – even with their higher level of independence from the conglomerate group when compared to Kering – have been silent about the fur issue. While for other labels such as Prada, Chanel, Burberry, and Versace it was “easier” to ban fur, with a relatively small impact on their sales figures but a huge reflection on their public relations, the same cannot be said about LVMH. When Gucci went fur-free in 2017, its fur sales accounted for only 0.2 percent of the label’s revenue. In the meantime, Gucci’s Instagram post announcing this new fur policy received over 180,000 likes, which probably generated the brand a lot more revenue.

Even if a number of its brands do not use fur, LVMH rarely advertises it. That’s because some of the group’s bigger companies like Dior and Louis Vuitton constantly present the material in their collections and, regarding Fendi, the label started in 1925 as a furrier, so removing animal fur would directly affect the brand’s legacy and heritage. According to PJ Smith, Humane Society’s director of fashion policy, “As long as Fendi is part of that group and Fendi has a close association with fur, it’s going to be a long time before LVMH goes fur-free”.

Other alternatives are left for the LVMH conglomerate: the group defined strong fur sourcing standards for animal well-being, Fendi has diminished its fur usage and has been experimenting with recycled fur, and other brands have been trying out faux fur alternatives. In the end, it all comes down to one thing: revenue. While fur still brings companies large profits, it won’t be disappearing anytime soon.
