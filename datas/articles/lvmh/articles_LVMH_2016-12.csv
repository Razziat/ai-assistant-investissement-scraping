Christian Dior & LVMH Holding Company Sails Through Investor Assembly - WWD,"Wed, 07 Dec 2016 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vd3dkLmNvbS9mZWF0dXJlL2NocmlzdGlhbi1kaW9yLWJyZWV6ZXMtaW52ZXN0b3ItYXNzZW1ibHktbHZtaC0xMDcyMDc3MS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS — Christian Dior SA — the company that holds Christian Dior Couture as well as a controlling stake in LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton — sailed through its general assembly Tuesday, passing 24 resolutions in rapid succession.

With president Bernard Arnault and his family maintaining a 70 percent stake and 84 percent of voting rights at the company, shareholders who gathered at the Carrousel du Louvre had little possibility of contesting the board’s proposals — which included a share buyback of 300 million euros, $333 million at current exchange rates, and renewing the compensation agreement for Dior’s chief executive Sidney Toledano.

One, however, took the floor to ask how much money Dior was spending for the brand’s numerous celebrity ambassadors, which include Marion Cotillard, Natalie Portman, Jennifer Lawrence, and Rihanna.

“The compensation for these women is confidential,” Dior chief executive Sidney Toledano answered. “Investors will have to trust the directors of the brand to make sure there is a return on investment for this sort of operation.”

Another attendee asked if Donald Trump’s election would have an effect on Dior SA’s performance in the U.S., which currently accounts for 26 percent of the group’s sales.

Toledano declined to make predictions, and simply commented that the U.S. remained an important market where the group enjoyed solid growth.

The group’s annual report, published Oct. 28, showed 37.97 billion euro, or $42.14 billion at average exchange rates, in sales for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2016, with organic growth at 4.6 percent. The group’s 40.9 percent stake in LVMH accounted for 95 percent of those sales, with 1.85 billion euro, or 2.05 billion dollars, in sales at Christian Dior Couture making up the rest.

Christian Dior Couture, which encompasses the brand’s apparel, accessory, and jewelry businesses — the perfume and cosmetics line are exercised under the LVMH umbrella — reported an 8 percent drop in operating profit for the 2015-2016 fiscal year, despite a 5 percent increase in sales.

Financial director Florian Ollivier attributed the drop to amortizations and investments in stores — including new U.S. locations in Washington, D.C., San Francisco and Miami. He said EBITDA for the company was up slightly on the year.

The profit slump at Dior didn’t stop operating profits for the holding from climbing to 6.8 billion euros — up 8 percent on the year — thanks to strong revenues across a number of business areas at LVMH.

The continued profitability of Louis Vuitton as well as strong performance by Kenzo and Céline were drivers of LVMH’s growth in fashion and leather goods, the company said, while a comeback for Hennessy in the Chinese market helped boost the group’s wine and spirits division.

Following the departure of designer Raf Simons from Christian Dior in October 2015, the house presented a fall 2016 collection in March that had been realized by the studio with no artistic director to sign it. The new director, Maria Grazia Chiuri, showed her first women’s ready-to-wear collection in September.

Investors voted their continued approval for Toledano’s compensation package from Christian Dior SA, which paid out 2.4 million euro plus 1.5 million in stock during fiscal year 2015-2016.

The previous year, Toledano was paid 9.7 million euros plus stock — the difference owing to irregular payments under a “medium term” incentive plan that shareholders voted to keep in place.

Dior has seen a jump in sales in the quarter following the fiscal year captured by the annual report, HSBC Global Research said in a note Monday. Dior has outperformed the luxury sector, analysts Antoine Belge and Erwan Rambourg wrote, and uneven sales are more likely due to broader fluctuations in the luxury market than designer changes.

“[T]he Q3 16 rebound (sales up 8% organically) was achieved with products which had not yet been designed by [Grazia Chiuri],” HSBC said.

The bank projected organic sales growth for the group at 7 percent per year for 2017 to 2019."

CEO Fausto Pinarello, whose father founded the Villorba, Treviso-based business, remains in his position and retains a significant, but minority stake in the business.

LVMH has been rumoured to be keen to move into the sports and leisure sectors, and last week was linked with a bid for upscale British cycle clothing brand Rapha.

As we suggested last week, L Catterton - formed earlier this year through a partnership of Catterton, LVMH and the family holding company of the French group's CEO, Bernard Arnault, would seem the most likely vehicle for such an acquisition.

With its impressive roster of brands – 15 in the fashion and leather goods division, including Loewe, Louis Vuitton, Thomas Pink and Marc Jacobs, with total turnover of around €12.4bn (£10.6bn) – there is no ignoring LVMH’s dominance in the luxury sector.

Under the direction of chairman and chief executive Bernard Arnault, who has held the role since 1989, LVMH began 2016 with a bang. It announced that it had achieved a record revenue rise of 16% year on year to €35.7bn (£27bn) in 2015, as “strong momentum” in Europe, the US and Japan offset a weaker performance in Asia.

Sales have continued to increase since. Meanwhile, in July LVMH struck a $650m (£494m) deal to sell Donna Karan International to US firm G-III Apparel, which is expected to close at the end of this year or in early 2017."
DKNY Designers and C.E.O. Leave. Where Does It Go Next?

Such was the case after the announcement late Thursday that Maxwell Osborne and Dao-Yi Chow, the creative directors of DKNY, and Caroline Brown, the brand’s chief executive, were leaving after less than two years.

This would normally have been kind of a big deal. The departure of three top executives at once is a rarity. Such dramatic change at the top has happened only twice in contemporary fashion: in 2004, when Tom Ford and the chief executive Domenico Del Sole left Gucci; and in 2014, when Gucci dismissed the designer Frida Giannini and the chief executive Patrizio di Marco.

But the crazy rate of churn in fashion over the last year and the agreement this year for LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton to sell DKNY to G-III Apparel Group, a manufacturing and licensing company that produces Ivanka Trump’s brand, among other American names; and the fact that the sale just officially closed — an occurrence that tends to cause executive change — meant that there were no big shock waves."

Also, probably not coincidentally, where its customer base is.

Last week, the conglomerate announced a new parental-leave policy that, to many, might seem like a luxury itself: a minimum of 14 weeks of paid maternity or adoptive leave and five days of paternity or partner leave, beginning Jan. 1, 2017 for all employees who have worked there for more than a year.

What made the move unusual was that the group, which operates in nearly 60 countries and employs more than 38,000 people, established the policy across all brands and all locations."

Alec Monopoly's face is always hidden behind a bandana to preserve his anonymity, but what is he famous for? The artist owes his fame to the character who shares his name. Mr. Monopoly, the diminutive and debonair banker that he depicts in different scenarios.

""When I started out, I did my graffiti in New York,"" Monopoly said. ""The city was a huge source of inspiration.""

In 2008, he quit the Big Apple for California. This was the year that the financial markets crashed. The finance world experienced its darkest days, and this found its echo in Monopoly's work, and his career took off.

""This was my way of making a statement about what was happening,"" he said.

Since then, he has depicted the little banker in every conceivable situation. His rich, colorful works using this character, known throughout the world, are filled with humor. Monopoly has also started recontextualizing other icons of popular culture such as Scrooge McDuck and Richie Rich.

"Crocodiles Cut Open, Skinned in Vietnam for Leather Bags - PETA Australia","Fri, 23 Dec 2016 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBldGEub3JnLmF1L25ld3MvY3JvY29kaWxlcy1jdXQtb3Blbi1za2lubmVkLXZpZXRuYW0tbGVhdGhlci1iYWdzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PETA has exposed suffering on reptile farms in the U.S. and Africa, and now eyewitness footage reveals the horrifying reality for tens of thousands of crocodiles in Vietnam raised and violently killed to make “luxury” leather bags sold around the world.

Two of the farms investigated supply crocodile skins to Louis Vuitton’s parent company LVMH and “some of the biggest brands,” according to a farm owner.

Please take a look at what purchases of crocodile-skin bags, belts, or watchbands could be supporting, and then take action to help stop this abuse.

Necks Cut Open and Rods Rammed Down Spines While Alive

Workers electroshocked crocodiles then attempted to kill them by cutting into their necks and ramming metal rods down their spines. The animals shake vigorously as this happens. One crocodile’s leg can be seen raising up after he was cut open. Then workers leave him to bleed out.

This killing method has long been shown to be inhumane, and experts have found that crocodilians remain conscious for over an hour after their spinal cord has been severed and their blood vessels cut.

A reptile expert who watched footage of the crocodiles being slaughtered said that “the neck incisions would have been very painful and inhumane,” and “There is no probability that these animals ‘died instantly.'”

Skinned While Still Bleeding and Moving

Workers took the crocodiles into an adjacent room and cut off their skin—a process that takes 15 to 20 minutes per animal. Footage shows that one crocodile continued to move after being skinned.

Confined to Small, Barren Enclosures

The investigator visited a farm that holds tens of thousands of crocodiles and slaughters 1,500 of them every three months. At this farm—which supplies skins to Louis Vuitton—about 5,000 crocodiles were kept in small, concrete enclosures—some narrower than the length of their bodies. The investigator was told that they are kept in these conditions, which a reptile expert called “overly-restrictive, understimulating, and inhumane” for large crocodiles, for 15 months before finally being slaughtered.

Packed Into Concrete Pits

At this farm and another one that supplies skins to LVMH, crocodiles were packed into concrete pits. When several animals are housed together, it’s likely that aggression and injuries will result, and these commonly lead to infection and disease. One crocodile was missing a tail.

Skin Cut and Pulled Off

After the crocodiles were slaughtered, workers cut and pulled off their skin—all just to make “luxury” crocodile-skin bags, wallets, and other items to be sold by Louis Vuitton and other brands.

You Can Help Stop This Cruelty!

PETA has exposed cruelty at reptile farms on three continents, and the story is always the same: grim, close confinement and a violent death. Before buying items made out of exotic skins like these, please stop and think of the animals they come from and their intense suffering. Don’t support this cruelty with your purchases.

Do more: Urge LVMH to shed exotic skins from Louis Vuitton and all of its brands. A moment of your time will make a huge difference for these forgotten animals.
