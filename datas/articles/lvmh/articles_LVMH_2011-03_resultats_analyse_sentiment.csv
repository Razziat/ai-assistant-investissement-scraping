LVMH Takes Control of Bulgari in Merger Deal - WWD,"Mon, 07 Mar 2011 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3dkLmNvbS9mYXNoaW9uLW5ld3MvZGVzaWduZXItbHV4dXJ5L2x2bWgtYnV5cy1idWxnYXJpLTM1NDIyODkv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The luxury megadeal is back, thanks to Bernard Arnault.

In a transaction with a total value of more than $6 billion, Arnault’s LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton on Monday agreed to acquire 50.4 percent of Rome-based jeweler Bulgari in a cash-and-share swap, and launched a bid for the remaining shares. In typical Arnault fashion, the acquisition will immediately reshape the landscape of the fine jewelry and watch sector, stepping up pressure on LVMH’s competitors Swatch Group and Compagnie Financière Richemont SA and potentially stirring other deals in the luxury sector. The shares of luxury companies worldwide climbed on Monday in the wake of the news despite sharp declines in global stock markets amid heightened worries over the soaring price of oil.

The purchase of Bulgari also represents a bit of bait-and-switch by Arnault, who only last month downplayed the likelihood of LVMH making acquisitions as he reiterated the group’s strategy of investing heavily in its high potential brands.

Instead, the Bulgari deal will:

• Double the size of LVMH’s watch and jewelry division in one fell swoop;

• Make the Bulgari family the second-largest family shareholders in LVMH after Arnault himself, with a 3.3 percent stake;

• Give Bulgari the financial muscle to further expand its product categories and retail footprint.

The purchase comes in the midst of a turbulent period for Arnault following last week’s beginning of termination proceedings against John Galliano at Dior, one of the jewels in Arnault’s empire, and a stepped-up war of words from another family-owned company, Hermès, in which Arnault has quietly been amassing a 20.2 percent stake. The turmoil apparently hasn’t distracted him too much, however — also on Monday, Arnault tapped a new global chief executive officer for specialist beauty retailer Sephora, another of his holdings.

While the owning families of Hermès might see Arnault as a raider as welcome as Attila the Hun, the Bulgari clan believes that joining the LVMH stable offers nothing but synergies and growth potential. Francesco Trapani, who has been ceo of Bulgari for 27 years, said his family “wanted to remain entrepreneurs, we were not looking to retire and cash out.”

“We were not ready to sell, but to change the profile of our entrepreneurial activity,” he added. “LVMH is the perfect partner and there is no question about its scale and global high quality management structure.”

Trapani said he had been in talks over the years with “the majority” of luxury companies about a possible sale, but that “they were not open to a situation like this, they were afraid of losing full control, especially Italians, who are jealous of their companies. My view of having a more industrial approach did not convince them.”

Bulgari is not coming cheap for Arnault, the world’s seventh richest man with a worth estimated at $26 billion. Not only will the luxury titan have to shell out a substantial amount of cash, but he also is slightly loosening his family’s grip on LVMH itself.

The structure of the deal is unique in that LVMH will, for the first time in 23 years, issue shares to partially pay for Bulgari.

Under the terms of the purchase, LVMH is set to pay a total of 4.3 billion euros, or $6.01 billion at current exchange. The French luxury giant will issue 16.5 million shares in exchange for the 152.5 million Bulgari shares currently held by the jeweler’s founding family, who own 50.4 percent of the company. The LVMH shares are worth 1.86 billion euros, or $2.6 billion at current exchange. The Bulgaris also could buy another 14.5 million LVMH shares on the basis of the same exchange ratio. In that case, the purchase of Bulgari would be financed with 48 percent in LVMH shares and 52 percent in cash and financial debt.

If the Bulgaris do not buy the additional shares, 2.4 billion euros, or $3.3 billion, of the purchase price would be financed with available cash and new financial debt, or 56 percent of the total price. This would have a limited impact on LVMH’s debt, according to the company, which currently has a debt-to-equity ratio of 16 percent and free cash flow of more than 4 billion euros.

LVMH will make a tender offer for the remaining 49.6 percent of Bulgari’s shares outstanding at 12.25 euros, or $17.12 a share. This represents a 59.4 percent premium on the closing price of Bulgari shares on March 3. On Monday, Bulgari’s shares soared 59.4 percent on the Milan Stock Exchange, closing at 12.10 euros, or $16.91.

Following completion of the deal, Bulgari will be delisted and the Bulgari family will have two representatives on the LVMH board. Paolo and Nicola Bulgari will remain chairman and vice chairman of the Bulgari board, respectively. Trapani is to join the executive committee of LVMH and take the management helm of the French group’s watch and jewelry division in the second half, succeeding incumbent Philippe Pascal.

In a conference call with analysts, Antonio Belloni, LVMH group managing director, said Trapani will remain ceo of Bulgari “in the short term, to assist in this important transition, but that, in the context of larger responsibilities, a new leader will be put in place.” As for Pascal, Belloni said that, as a “valued resource who has done an excellent job, we have an excellent assignment for him in the future,” following the transition period. He declined to provide details.

LVMH’s watch and jewelry division was created in 1999 with the acquisition of Chaumet, Zenith and Tag Heuer. In 2001, LVMH set up a joint venture with De Beers to establish a diamond jewelry retailing platform, followed in 2008 by the acquisition of Hublot. “We are relatively young in this category and we cannot say we had a leadership, but at LVMH we do like to be leaders, so we will be doubling the size of our watch and jewelry division and strengthening our group [with the Bulgari deal],” said Belloni.

The LVMH watch and jewelry division registered sales of 985 million euros, or $1.3 billion, in 2010, up from 764 million euros, or $1.06 billion at average exchange rate, in 2009. Including Bulgari, the division’s pro-forma sales would be 2.05 billion euros, or $2.71 billion. Bulgari had sales of 1.06 billion euros, or $1.4 billion, last year, with jewelry accounting for almost half of that, followed by fragrances, watches and accessories. Bulgari operated 173 directly owned stores worldwide as of the end of December.

“This is a significant step for our family as well as for Bulgari, occurring at a time of strong revenue growth,” said Trapani during the call, adding that Bulgari sales in the first two months of the year were up 25 percent at a comparable exchange rate, and that its order book more than doubled as of the end of February.

But Bulgari’s trajectory in recent years hasn’t been continually upward. The company struggled following the recession of 2008, as did many of its competitors, and also stumbled slightly several years before that with the expansion of its watch line. Recently, however, Bulgari has registered strong increases in profits and sales, although its profit margins at about 10 percent continue to lag those of the rest of the industry.

“Our entrance into LVMH will allow Bulgari to reinforce its worldwide growth and to realize noteworthy synergies, in particular in the areas of purchasing and distribution,” said Trapani. “My vision is that the luxury market will continue to grow in the next 10 years, become progressively and increasingly more competitive, and in more geographical areas. We need to be more competitive in new areas, from Russia to China, India and the Middle East, to prosper.”

Armando Branchini, deputy chairman of Milan-based consultancy InterCorporate, concurred, saying that consumer spending is expected to grow over the next few years and that, as part of LVMH, Bulgari will be able to open more stores around the world. “This is a win-win-win situation: LVMH buys a firm with a strong positioning, that is consistent and has a big global potential; Bulgari obtains a 3 percent share in LVMH, becoming second majority shareholder, and the share price is at such a premium.”

A Milan-based analyst who requested anonymity said Bulgari secured a very high price, in “a sector that hasn’t seen this kind of values since 2007.”

Luca Solca, a senior analyst with Bernstein Research in Zurich, said “the price seems to be hefty versus our general M&A guidelines. Expensive as it may be, the absolute deal size is small for LVMH,” with earning dilutions in 2011 and 2012 “likely to be minimal.” Solca said “the deal makes strategic sense and should be beneficial for LVMH. Bulgari is a potential megabrand with much to gain (media buying, retail development) from LVMH’s muscle. LVMH’s watch and jewelry are among the weakest areas — in need of a stronger brand lineup.”

René Weber, analyst at Bank Vontobel, said Bulgari gets a “very attractive price” at 21 times its EBITDA, and LVMH secures a “bigger size” in the watch and jewelry market. “As LVMH just has a very small leverage (debt-equity ratio 2010: 16 percent) and 50 percent of the deal is paid by shares, it does not have a big impact on their balance sheet.”

By doubling its watch and jewelry division in terms of sales, LVMH “gets closer” to producers such as Swatch and Richemont.

However, Weber estimated that the new LVMH watch business would still be less than half the size of the three big watch groups — Swatch, Rolex and Richemont. The new division will account for roughly 10 percent of LVMH’s group sales, he said.

Richard Lowe, head of retail and wholesale at Barclays Corporate in London, said “the deal did not come as a surprise to me. You would expect LVMH to be on the lookout for global brands, with cross-continental appeal much like Richemont did with Net-a-porter.com. And clearly, LVMH has bought the management’s vision for the brand. I doubt that they would upset the applecart by changing management now.”

Belloni said LVMH values the synergies of the deal, and it fits in with LVMH’s philosophy of “one model nurturing the uniqueness and differentiation of culture and integrity and creativity of each brand. There will be an opportunity to gain from putting the businesses together, and we will be stronger in development and retail, we can gain critical market, optimize our purchase of media and our organization around the world.”

Antitrust authorities are expected to approve the deal by the end of April. The closing of the share contribution is expected in mid-May and the launch of the cash tender offer is expected at the end of May, followed by the closing of the cash tender offer at the end of June. Trapani said there was no exit clause and that the final agreement is unconditional.

In the conference call, Jean-Jacques Guiony, chief financial officer at LVMH, said this was “the first share swap in 23 years and the largest acquisition and not a precedent for any other transaction,” although he mentioned Christian Dior “did something similar” with Guerlain in the past.

Bulgari was founded in 1884 by Greek expatriate Sotirios Boulgaris, who later changed his name to Sotirio Bulgari, as a tiny silverware store established in Rome. Trapani, Sotirios’ great-grandson, and the nephew of Paolo and Nicola Bulgari, became ceo in 1984 at age 27. In the mid-Seventies, Bulgari branched out with high-end Swiss-made watches, such as the top-performing Bulgari design, where the logo is etched into the bezel. Trapani was instrumental in listing the company on the Milan bourse in 1995.

He also is credited with substantially expanding Bulgari in terms of its breadth of products and its retail reach. He has aggressively moved the company into accessories such as watches, silk products and leather goods and tapped Matthew Williamson to design a capsule collection. In light of the deal, Belloni said LVMH is still deciding on strategies regarding Bulgari’s perfumes and accessories categories, but that, for the latter, given the group’s expertise, “we’d be very smart to reason [on it],” he said.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999157190322876}",neutral,0.9999157190322876,0

France’s giant luxury group LVMH has announced a €4 billion deal to take over Italian luxury watch and jewellery maker Bulgari.

AP - French fashion colossus LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton is adding another jewel to its crown.

The Paris-based holding company behind luxury brands Christian Dior gowns, Dom Perignon champagne and Guerlain perfume has agreed to buy Rome-based jeweler Bulgari SpA in a cash-and-shares deal worth €4.3 billion ($6 billion).

The deal will see Bulgari’s founding family become the second largest family shareholders in LVMH behind that of Chief Executive Bernard Arnault.

France’s richest man, Arnault has grown LVMH into a €20 billion company since its creation in 1987, acquiring an impressive portfolio of luxury brands that extends to Chateau d’Yquem wine and TAG Heuer watches.

His latest takeover adds the fabled jeweler favored by Hollywood stars like Elizabeth Taylor, whose collection included an 18-carat emerald brooch surrounded by diamonds - the only piece of jewelry she wore to her first wedding to Richard Burton.

The jeweler also designed the 1967 gold, emerald, ruby and sapphire necklace worn by Keira Knightley at the Oscars in 2006

LVMH said in a statement it will exchange 16.5 million of its own shares for the 56 percent stake in Bulgari owned by the company’s founding family.

LVMH will offer the remaining Bulgari shareholders €12.25 ($17.10) per share in a public offering. Following the deal, the Bulgari family will own 3 percent of LVMH.

Bulgari is the smallest among the major luxury watch and jewelry makers. It was started in 1884 by Greek immigrant Sotirios Bulgari, who opened the flagship Via Condotti store in Rome in 1905, and has expanded to more than 260 stores.

LVMH's Bernard Arnault persists in his pursuit of Hermès - The Guardian,"Tue, 08 Mar 2011 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy8yMDExL21hci8wOC9tZXJnZXJzLWFuZC1hY3F1aXNpdGlvbnMtcmV0YWls0gFQaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAudGhlZ3VhcmRpYW4uY29tL2J1c2luZXNzLzIwMTEvbWFyLzA4L21lcmdlcnMtYW5kLWFjcXVpc2l0aW9ucy1yZXRhaWw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The ink had barely dried on Louis Vuitton Moët Hennessy's takeover of Italy's Bulgari – after a decade-long courtship – when Bernard Arnault, the dogged boss of the sprawling LVMH luxury-goods empire, turned his attention back to another long-term target, French rival Hermès.

In an interview with Le Figaro, Arnault, the LVMH chief executive and 46.5% shareholder, said his €3.7bn (£3.2bn) takeover of the Italian watch and jewellery group might just boost his chance of securing a deal with the family-owned Hermès – the super-luxe business behind the famous Birkin handbags that dangle from the arms of movie stars and oligarchs' wives.

LVMH has built a 20.2% stake since October – but Hermès is unimpressed and has rebuffed Arnault's overtures .

""I hope that this partnership [with Bulgari] will demonstrate that some families are able to understand the meaning of a merger with LVMH,"" Arnault told the French newspaper.

""Regarding Hermès, I can only repeat that we are a peaceful shareholder and that we will support the shareholders and the strategy that they are conducting despite the comments we are hearing there or here,"" added Arnault, who has built the group from virtually nothing to the world's biggest luxury-goods empire, with 60 brands, through dozens of acquisitions in his 21 years at the helm.

These brands include haute-couture houses Christian Dior and Givenchy, as well as luxury champagne grandes marques such as Dom Pérignon and Krug, and fashion labels Donna Karan, Céline and Marc Jacobs. And their acquisition has established LVMH and, in turn, France, as the undisputed leader of the luxury-goods world, analysts say.

Sixty-two-year-old Arnault's comments to Le Figaro demonstrate just how determined he can be in the pursuit of assets he really wants. He controls the world's largest luxury-goods group, which last year reported a 19% surge in global sales to a record €20.3bn, as profits breached €4bn for the first time.

Meanwhile, Hermès' three controlling families, who collectively own 73.4% of the shares, could not have been more dismissive of his efforts to build a relationship with the French luxury-goods company, which, with barely 10% of LVMH's revenues, would hardly transform its larger domestic rival in the event of a takeover.

Yet Arnault continues his pursuit of Hermès. The Paris-based maker of Birkin and Kelly bags shocked many last week when the chief executive, Patrick Thomas, dismissed Arnault's stealthy acquisition of Hermès shares: ""If you want to seduce a beautiful woman, you don't start by raping her from behind.""

Given the deeply offensive nature of Thomas's comment, it is perhaps ironic that Hermès, a symbol of French gentility with bags that fetch more than €100,000, should dismiss Arnault, also a Frenchman, of being a flash, brash, American-style pile-'em-high-and-sell-'em-cheap merchant who would contaminate his brand.

Nonetheless, that is how Hermès is seeking to portray LVMH, as it seeks to fend off Arnault's advances, in part, through the creation of a holding company that locks up a 51% controlling stake and makes a takeover of the company virtually impossible.

As Thomas told the New York Times last weekend: ""There is a part of our world that is playing on abundance, on glitz and glamour. And there is another part that is concentrated on refinement, basically making beautiful objects.

""We don't want to be a part of this financial world, which is ruining companies and dealing with people like they are goods or raw materials. It's not a financial fight, because we would lose that. It's a cultural fight,"" Thomas adds.

Arnault's reputation as a tough American-style operator, it seems, is not entirely undeserved. He is no stranger to acrimonious bid battles – such as the 1999 contest for Gucci, in which he lost out to arch-rival Pinault-Printemps-Redoute (PPR) – and has a habit of pouncing on companies in turmoil, for example, taking advantage of a family feud to seize control of Chateau d'Yquem, one of the greatest dessert wines. Furthermore, in his own accession to the throne at LVMH, Arnault punched his way to the top in an acrimonious battle involving Henry Racamier, president of the Louis Vuitton business, and Alain Chevalier, the chief of the Moët Hennessy operation. And his very first deal, in 1984, involved more than a touch of corporate-raider tactics, with Arnault buying Boussac, a struggling textile and nappy company that also happened to own Dior.

After the buyout, Arnault promptly wound down the textile businesses, with the loss of thousands of jobs and concentrated on Dior. Not long afterwards, Arnault bought into LVMH and by 1990 had taken control of the group.

However, Hermès extreme rejection of Arnault's overtures, brings to mind the reaction of the Bancroft family, which controlled Wall Street Journal-owner Dow Jones, upon Rupert Murdoch's, ultimately successful, pursuit of the US media group. Murdoch, completed his turbulent $5bn (£2.5bn) takeover of the influential financial newspaper's publisher in 2007.

Like Murdoch, Arnault covets trophy assets and plays a long game – and, again like Murdoch, he usually wins.

One LVMH source said: ""Arnault would buy Hermès tomorrow if he could. Otherwise, he will wait it out, even if it takes a generation or two. That's what he's like.""

Arnault has not always been successful. In addition to losing the battle for Gucci, his foray into the auction world was short-lived, selling the Phillips auction house in 2002, reportedly for a multimillion-dollar loss, just three years after buying it. Furthermore, Europatweb, an internet investment firm set up in 1999 by Arnault with €500m of his own cash began winding down in 2002 in the wake of the dotcom bust.

However, with a personal fortune of $27.5bn (£17bn) – making him the richest man in France and the seventh wealthiest in the world, Forbes says – and with LVMH's shares trading at more than double their level a decade ago, Arnault must be doing something right.

And he may not be quite the devil Hermès is making him out to be.

""Hermès like to portray themselves as a group of elves lovingly handcrafting each shoe and Arnault as a ruthless industrialist. In fact, Hermès are a lot more industrialist than they make out and LVMH are more elves-like,"" said the LVMH source.

This view is shared by others. Luca Solca, an analyst at Bernstein Research, said: ""Arnault seems to be saying, 'you know what guys, we've just made an agreement with the Bulgari family and they're comfortable with us taking care of the brand, so why aren't you?'.

""I don't think Hermès' grounds [for rejection] are entirely rational. They seem afraid that LVMH would trivialise the brand and introduce cheaper products. I don't think LVMH would do that,"" Solca adds.

René Weber, analyst at Bank Vontobel in Zurich, says: ""Arnault is not afraid of a fight and a lot of his battles have been successful for him and his shareholders. Whether he can eventually succeed with Hermès is still an open question.

""He hasn't always been successful, but overall LVMH is most definitely a success story.""","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9998966455459595}",neutral,0.9998966455459595,0
Why did LVMH pay over the odds for Bulgari? - The Jewellery Editor,"Tue, 08 Mar 2011 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWpld2VsbGVyeWVkaXRvci5jb20vamV3ZWxsZXJ5L2FydGljbGUvd2h5LWRpZC1sdm1oLXBheS1vdmVyLXRoZS1vZGRzLWZvci1idWxnYXJpL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"On Monday 7th March LMVH announced that it had acquired of 51% of Bulgari shares for 3.7 billion euros at a 60% premium to the closing price on Friday. Bernard Arnault, Chairman and CEO of LVMH has long had his eye on Bulgari but just why was Arnault willing to pay over the odds to add this family-owned brand to his already glittering line-up of maisons? Afterall, LVMH as well as top-end fashion and drinks brands, also own big watch and jewellery brands TAG Heuer, Fred, Dior, Chaumet and Zenith. The simple answer is because Bulgari is a very rare beast: an iconic brand with a unique heritage. It is one of the few century-old jewellery houses to walk the fine line between respecting a venerable heritage yet without being fusty or stiff and relevant to new generations. While LVMH has been busy creating jewellery and watch opportunities such as the joint venture with De Beers, Bulgari has been a shimmering mirage of temptation. Only two years ago Louis Vuitton unveiled its first ever high jewellery collection and LVMH fashion brands such Dior has been increasing its jewellery and watch offer. That Bulgari has successfully diversified into new product areas such as watches can only add to its appeal. LVMH too has been busy beefing up on the watch front and a decade ago bought TAG Heuer and Zenith. Bulgari's watch production facilities could prove useful in expanding production with components in short supply. But perhaps most alluring to Arnault is the fact that Bulgari has that enigmatic X Factor. Richard Burton remarked of his 1963 visit to the Condotti shop to buy Elizabeth Taylor a ring: ""I introduced her to beer, and she introduced me to Bulgari."" Andy Warhol would stop by the shop when he visited Rome ""because it is the best exhibition of contemporary art"". The queen of Italian glamour, Sophia Loren was often snapped darting through the elaborately faceted glass door of the Condotti boutique. Priceless assets in the eyes of someone like Arnault who knows how to harness glamour to the power of marketing that translates dreams into cash. Being Italian only makes Bulgari more desirable alongside LVMH's all-French line-up of jewellery brands. There is no clash between the brand positioning of Chaumet, tiara maker to Napoleon's court nor Dior's bright and edgy creations. It is likely that in LVMH-style Bulgari will be managed as a separate brand and the power of the conglomerate focusing on how best to profitably articulate the Bulgari magic across the globe. And LVMH has a rich vein of history to tap. Bulgari was founded by Sotirio Boulgaris in 1844, a Greek silversmith who at the outbreak of war in the Balkans emigrated from his native Greece to Italy. By 1900, Bulgari, as he then became known, set up his first shop selling silver, antiques, jewels, bric-a-brac and ""curiosities"" at 28 via dei Condotti. In 1905 the business moved to 10 via dei Condotti and Sotirio's grandsons Gianni, Paolo and Nicola nurtured the fame and strong style of the house that attracted the dolce vita crowd. A strong visual identity has been forged by a persistent emphasis on design. The last time I visited the Bulgari headquarters on the banks of the Tiber in Rome was three years ago. The design team of 25 was still supervised day in, day out, by septuagenarian Paolo Bulgari, the current CEO's uncle. Signor Paolo's office has a smoked glass door straight into the studio showing how active he was in both the jewellery and watch design. But Bulgari hasn't stood still and CEO and Bulgari family-member Francesco Trapani has expanded the brand offer to fragrances, leather goods, beauty and even hotels. When Trapani became CEO in 1984, the house had only five boutiques selling jewellery. Today there are some 250 Bulgari boutiques selling a range of Bulgari products. But despite this impressive expansion, Bulgari has never had the advantage of the distribution and logistics of competing houses owned by luxury conglomerates such as Cartier. Italians may be smarting from the loss of another luxury brand to the French. Fendi belongs to LVMH and Gucci to PPR. But it seems that to become a player in the global world of luxury, the power of a large conglomerate is what it takes to conquer the world.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9997219443321228}",neutral,0.9997219443321228,0

Bulgari takeover 82% costlier than Hermes for LVMH - Business Standard,"Wed, 09 Mar 2011 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzLXN0YW5kYXJkLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL2NvbXBhbmllcy9idWxnYXJpLXRha2VvdmVyLTgyLWNvc3RsaWVyLXRoYW4taGVybWVzLWZvci1sdm1oLTExMTAzMDkwMDAzNl8xLmh0bWzSAX1odHRwczovL3d3dy5idXNpbmVzcy1zdGFuZGFyZC5jb20vYW1wL2FydGljbGUvY29tcGFuaWVzL2J1bGdhcmktdGFrZW92ZXItODItY29zdGxpZXItdGhhbi1oZXJtZXMtZm9yLWx2bWgtMTExMDMwOTAwMDM2XzEuaHRtbA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Six weeks after LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton said it wouldn’t overpay for acquisitions, the world’s largest maker of luxury goods is now spending more than ever to purchase Bulgari.

LVMH, which sells everything from Louis Vuitton bags to Dom Perignon champagne and Royal Van Lent yachts, agreed yesterday to pay ¤3.7 billion ($5.2 billion) for the Rome-based watch and jewelry maker in its biggest takeover in at least a decade, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Including net debt, the deal values Bulgari at as much as 28.2 times earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation, higher than LVMH has offered for any other company and 82 per cent more than it paid for a stake in Hermes International in October.

Chief Executive Officer Bernard Arnault, who built Paris-based LVMH through acquisitions over more than two decades, is paying the biggest premium in 10 years to gain control of the world’s third-largest jeweller from Bulgari’s founding family. While Bulgari’s earnings slumped 67 per cent in the past three years and the company has a lower operating margin than any of its largest rivals, Arnault is betting he can boost profitability as Bulgari’s sales reach a record this year.

“It’s priced on the assumption that they’ll do well with it,” said James Moffett, who helps oversee $20 billion in Kansas City, Missouri, at Scout Investments, which owns about 675,000 shares of LVMH. “They’re obviously paying a fairly full price for it. There’s always a risk that it doesn’t work.”

Still, “they’re skilled operators and they’re used to dealing in the luxury-goods business,” Moffett said. “There are a lot of ways that they could mess it up, but the odds are that they won’t.”

LVMH, founded in 1987 from the merger of Moet Hennessy and Louis Vuitton, has completed more than two dozen acquisitions in the past decade as Arnault forged a luxury goods maker now valued at $77 billion. Sales have almost doubled in that span to ¤20.3 billion.

Bulgari would be Arnault’s biggest takeover attempt since shareholders rejected his $6.15 billion bid for Gucci Group in 1999, the data show.

LVMH will buy the 50.4 per cent stake owned by Bulgari’s founding family using stock and then make a tender offer for the rest in cash, the companies said yesterday. The deal values the family’s stake at ¤1.91 billion, while LVMH’s ¤12.25 per share offer to minority investors will cost almost ¤1.84 billion.

Including options and the purchase of a convertible bond, the company is paying a total price of ¤4.3 billion, LVMH said on a conference call yesterday.

The stock portion of the acquisition gives Bulgari an enterprise value, or its equity and debt minus cash, of ¤4.04 billion, or 28.2 times its Ebitda of ¤143.3 million in the past 12 months, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The tender offer was struck at 25.8 times Bulgari’s Ebitda.

LVMH’s deal for the controlling stake held by Bulgari’s founding family would be more than twice as expensive as the median Ebitda multiple of 11.9 times the company has historically paid in acquisitions.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999504089355469}",neutral,0.9999504089355469,0

""Hennessy has [a request for proposal] out to three creative agencies,"" said a spokesperson for parent LVMH Moet Hennessy. ""We are making a greater investment in our advertising campaigns this year and are considering agencies that will help the Hennessy brand make an imprint in a new and innovative way.""

The incumbent agency, WPP's Berlin Cameron, was invited, but declined to participate in the review, LVHM said. According to people familiar with the pitch, the contenders vying for the business are Interpublic Group of Cos.' McCann Erickson; MDC Partners' Kirshenbaum Bond Senecal & Partners; and an agency team compiled by Havas. Hennessy's media agency is Havas' MPG and its public relations agency is Publicis Groupe's MSL Group.

In 2010, Hennessy spent $9 million on domestic measured media on its various cognac lines, including Hennessy, Hennessy Black and Hennessy Paradis, up from $4 million the year before, according to Kantar Media. The brand calls itself the No. 1 cognac worldwide, selling 50 million bottles a year. In the U.S., sales were up 2.4% in 2010 to $57.4 million, according to SymphonyIRI.

Founded in 1765 by Irish aristocrat Richard Hennessy, the cognac has been bolstered in recent years by its popularity in the hip-hop community. Hennessy Black, which carries the tagline ""Done different,"" is billed as a lighter, fresher cognac and promotes its own lineup of DJs, including ""DJ Vice"" and ""D-Nice.""

LVMH to acquire luxury Italian jeweller Bulgari - The Globe and Mail,"Mon, 07 Mar 2011 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWdsb2JlYW5kbWFpbC5jb20vcmVwb3J0LW9uLWJ1c2luZXNzL2x2bWgtdG8tYWNxdWlyZS1sdXh1cnktaXRhbGlhbi1qZXdlbGxlci1idWxnYXJpL2FydGljbGU1OTE1NzAv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Italian jeweller Bulgari’s outlet in Tokyo's Ginza shopping district.ISSEI KATO Share

French luxury group LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SA will take over Italy's Bulgari SpA in a €3.7-billion ($5-billion) deal, paying a premium of almost 60 per cent for the high-end watches and jewellery maker.

LVMH, the world's number-one luxury goods company, will add Bulgari to its stable of brands – that includes Louis Vuitton handbags, Chaumet jewellery and Krug champagne – in order to tap surging demand from emerging markets.

Bulgari has long been seen as a potential target after it embarked on major investments when its sales were falling in the 2009 spending slump.

LVMH will buy 50.4 per cent of Bulgari, issuing 16.5 million shares in exchange for 152.5 million shares held by the Bulgari family, the companies said in statements on Monday.

The French company will launch a buyout offer for the rest of Bulgari shares at €12.25 a share. The shares closed at €7.59 on Friday and the offer carries a 59.4 per cent premium over the average price of the last month.

At Friday's closing price of €111.55 for LVMH shares, and using €12.25 for the free-floating Bulgari shares, the deal values the jeweller at about €3.7-billion, according to Reuters calculations.

Bulgari, established in 1884, agreed to the takeover ""in order to reinforce, in accordance with its history, values, craftsmanship and identity, the long-term development of the Bulgari Group"", it said.

Under the deal, the Bulgari family will become the second-biggest family shareholder in LVMH.

The Bulgari family will name two representatives to the LVMH board. Bulgari chief executive Francesco Trapani will join LVMH's executive committee and take on management of LVMH's watches and jewellery activities in the second half of the year.

""We expect the investors' community to welcome this deal given the operational improvements possible at Bulgari,"" a French broker said.

""This should be a catalyst for possible targets in the sector. As such, we would (see...) that as a positive for Burberry Group Plc notably.""

Mr. Trapani told Reuters last summer that his family had no plans to relinquish control of the group. ""We have not had any (takeover) proposal in our life,"" he said.

LVMH raised its stake in handbag maker Hermes to more than 20 per cent in December. LVMH chief executive Bernard Arnault told Reuters in January he was not seeking control of Hermes.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9784761071205139}",neutral,0.9784761071205139,0
LVMH to take over Bulgari in share deal - The Guardian,"Mon, 07 Mar 2011 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy8yMDExL21hci8wNy9sdm1oLXRha2Utb3Zlci1idWxnYXJpLWluLXNoYXJlLWRlYWzSAVVodHRwczovL2FtcC50aGVndWFyZGlhbi5jb20vYnVzaW5lc3MvMjAxMS9tYXIvMDcvbHZtaC10YWtlLW92ZXItYnVsZ2FyaS1pbi1zaGFyZS1kZWFs?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"French luxury group LVMH, famous for its silk scarves, handbags and champagne, is to take control of the Italian family owned jewellery maker Bulgari at a time when the luxury market is booming again.

The Bulgari family has decided to tender its 50.43% stake in a share swap that will make it the second-biggest family shareholder in LVMH. The all-share deal brings together Bulgari watches and jewellery with LVMH's TAG Heuer, Zenith and Hublot brands. The world's largest luxury group, which owns 50 brands ranging from Christian Dior perfume to Louis Vuitton bags and Dom Pérignon, toasted a record 2010 recently.

The deal values Bulgari at €3.7bn (£3.18bn), a 60% uplift on Friday's close of €2.3bn.

Evolution Securities analyst Simon Hales said: ""Financially then, the deal looks uninspiring for LVMH, but strategically it is an excellent move, bulking LVMH up in watches and jewelry, one of the fastest-growing areas of luxury. With the luxury industry in strong recovery mode, the financials will fall into place.""

The watches and jewellery division is the fastest-growing of LVMH's main business groups, but remains the company's smallest, with €985m in revenues, less than 5% of LVMH's total. Bulgari, founded in 1884 by Sotirio Bulgari, makes nearly half of its revenues from jewellery, and a fifth from watch sales.

Bulgari's chief executive Francesco Trapani will join LVMH's executive committee and head up the merged watches and jewellery operations from the second half of 2011. Philippe Pascal, the current head of the division, is to be given a new role. The Bulgari family will be able to appoint two representatives to the LVMH board, while Paolo and Nicola Bulgari remain chairman and vice-chairman of Bulgari respectively.

Under the deal, hammered out over the weekend and announced by both companies on Monday, LVMH will issue 16.5m new shares in exchange for the 152.5m Bulgari shares held by the Bulgari family and the French firm will submit a public offer of €12.25 a share for the stock held by minority shareholders.

It has also emerged that Prada, the Italian family-owned fashion house known for its Miu Miu bags, is gearing up for a stock market flotation in Hong Kong, rather than Italy, because Asia is its fastest-growing region.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9856770038604736}",neutral,0.9856770038604736,0

The exhibition to mark the bicentenary of Pernod Ricard's champagne brand Perrier Jouet celebrates ""iconic examples of family legacy"", and among the living embodiments of the high-minded mission at this week's launch party were actress Catherine Deneuve and her son Christian Vadim, as well as French artists Jean-Charles de Castelbajac and his son Louis-Marie. There was even rock'n'roll royalty in the shape of Jerry Hall and daughter Georgia May Jagger sipping elegant flutes of £600 champagne.

Unlike in the UK, many of France's most successful businesses are examples of ""family capitalism"", from the descendants of the Pernod and Ricard clans, who populate what is now the world's second-largest drinks group's senior ranks, to Bernard Arnault, who founded LVMH, maker of Krug champagne and Fendi purses, and is grooming daughter Delphine and nephew Harry Seaman. At PPR, owner of luxury brands Gucci and Yves Saint Laurent, the retail group is run by François-Henri Pinault, the son of founder François Pinault.

It is estimated that more than half of European companies are family-controlled, but that rises to nearly 65% in France. In the UK, where, after the hostile takeover of Cadbury by Kraft there are concerns about the short-termism of investors, the figure is less than 25%.

Last year research by Paris-based investment firm Oddo Asset Management suggested that family-controlled listed companies outperform their rivals. ""We believe families are better aligned with corporate interests than external shareholders,"" said its analysts. ""When your own money is involved, you are careful about the way you make returns. Family companies also use debt cautiously: they prefer to self-finance their growth or strengthen their capital.""

Value creation

Bernard Charlès, chief executive of Dassault Systèmes, part of the aviation and software giant founded by French industrialist Serge Dassault, is blunt about the benefits of having the family's might behind him: ""If we did not have this shareholder structure, I think Dassault Systèmes would be in foreign hands by now. In the hi-tech industry, M&A happens at the speed of light and deals are not always happening for value creation. They can be about value destruction by removing a competitor.""

The Dassaults own 43% of Dassault Systèmes and 51% of the voting rights and the stability provided by the arrangement ""has been fundamental to the company's success"" says Charlès: ""We talk about a different cycle [from our competitors]... we can invest and take risks with acquisitions or fundamental research, which I think is healthy in the long term.""

But happy families are not always the norm, as a recent legal battle between L'Oréal heiress Liliane Bettencourt and her estranged daughter, Françoise, shows. Bettencourt, France's richest woman, settled a row with her daughter over management of the family fortune following lavish gifts to a photographer friend. Similarly, the family shareholders behind Hermès are fighting to keep Arnault's LVMH at bay, after it quietly built up a 20% stake in the maker of coveted Birkin and Kelly bags in a predatory move seen as a prelude to a full takeover.

Elisabeth Ponsolle, chief executive of French luxury goods association Comité Colbert, whose members include Chanel, Cartier and Hermès, says the presence of wealthy family investors has been key to the success of the French luxury goods industry: ""Family ownership is very specific to French luxury. Even what we call the ""groups"" are owned by families. Even LVMH is a family – it's Bernard Arnault, but his son and daughter are also working there.""

Ponsolle says family owners accept that luxury is a long game: ""If they need to invest for 10 years without receiving a financial return, they do it, like Bernard Arnault at Dior. He invested and invested and invested... investment funds want a return in six months and a sale in three years. Brands talk about having been founded in the 18th, 19th or 20th centuries and having a history, but it takes time to develop a brand and you need to invest in the long term to do that.""

Fully committed

Not everybody is a fan of the model, with some investment banks accusing families of being too cautious, but that criticism could not be laid at the door of Pernod Ricard. Patrick Ricard told one interviewer that when he took the helm of the pastis maker founded by his father, Paul, his ambition was to expand outside France. Today, after a 20-year buying spree, it is a global business with annual sales of €7.2bn (£6.3bn) and owns brands such as Absolut vodka, Beefeater gin and Ballantine's whisky. Sales in China are expected to overtake those in France to become its second-largest market after the US this year.

There are four members of the founding families on the Pernod Ricard board and chief executive Pierre Pringuet says the family, who own 14%, ""are fully committed"" to the company, not least because ""their entire wealth is tied up in it"". His main concern, he says, is ""to preserve efficiency"".

Its structure is not typical anyway because, following the merger of Pernod and Ricard in the mid-1970s, the rival pastis makers were not bashed together. The company instead opted for a model whereby a federation of companies manages the brands and deals with the sales forces in each country.

Discussing his investment philosophy, celebrated US investor Warren Buffett says he likes to back family companies that share Berkshire Hathaway's work ethic and ""respect for a strong corporate culture"", but is quick to dismiss what he calls members of the ""lucky sperm club"" who are undeserving recipients of the boardroom power they inherit.

Pringuet, 61, declines to comment on speculation that he is holding the fort for another Ricard, Alexandre, who runs its Irish Distillers subsidiary, but says: ""The company retirement age for the chief executive is 65, and I plan to stay until I'm 65. After that, the directors decide.""

FAMILY FORTUNES

Bernard Arnault €22.7bn

The chief executive of LVMH is France's richest man, having built the luxury empire that produces everything from Veuve Cliquot champagne to Fendi purses. A renowned art collector, he is close to Nicolas Sarkozy and was a witness at his wedding to Cécilia Ciganer-Albéniz. He also owns French newspaper Les Echos. The 62-year-old is a father of five and his daughter Delphine is now involved in running LVMH, as is nephew Harry Seaman.

Gérard Mulliez €19bn

France's Mr Hypermarket. Mulliez opened his first shop in his home town of Roubaix in 1961 and over the next four decades turned the Auchan group into one of the world's biggest retail businesses with sales of €42.5bn and stores in 12 countries. Mulliez, who never finished high school, handed over the reins to his nephew Vianney Mulliez in the mid-90s.

Liliane Bettencourt €14.4bn

The only child of L'Oréal founder Eugène Schueller, she is France's richest woman. Bettencourt started working as his apprentice, mixing cosmetics and labelling shampoo bottles, when she was just 15 and inherited the company in 1957. At nearly 90, the heiress continues to be front page news in France due to a recent legal battle with her estranged daughter Françoise as well as allegations that she made an illegal donation to Sarkozy's 2007 election run.

Bertrand Puech €8.6bn

A descendant of the saddle-maker who founded Hermès in 1837, he is currently fighting the latest round of Paris's bitter ""handbag wars"" after LVMH secretly amassed a 20% stake. Various branches of the founding family still own 73.4% of the group that is famous for its silk scarves and waiting lists for its Birkin bags. However, they are not all singing from the same hymn sheet.

Serge Dassault €6.8bn

The aerospace and armaments tycoon is the main shareholder in family holding company Dassault Group whose interests span aviation, computer software and electric cars. The octogenarian is a senator for Sarkozy's party, the UMP, as well as proprietor of Le Figaro. The business was founded by his father Marcel and a third generation, including heir apparent Olivier, is now involved.

François Pinault €6.2bn

The founder PPR is best known for his victory in the tug of war with LVMH over control of Gucci. A friend of former French president Jacques Chirac, the businessman began buying modern art more than 30 years ago and is judged to have one of the most important private collections in the world. He has four children and his son François-Henri Pinault is the current boss of PPR.

Alain Wertheimer €4.5bn

Together with his brother Gérard, the Wertheimers are carrying on where Coco Chanel left off. They own a controlling interest in the House of Chanel which was co-founded by their grandfather Pierre. The brothers are keen horsemen and own a thoroughbred horse racing stable in the US. Their interests also include several vineyards including the Rauzan-Ségla vineyard in Margaux and Château Canon in Saint-Emilion.

Patrick Ricard €2.4bn

The chairman of Pernod Ricard joined the pastis maker founded by his father Paul in 1967 and is credited with the deal-making spree that has transformed the French group into a global drinks giant. He says doing something else was not an option: ""Papa would have regarded it as a form of betrayal had I not joined Ricard."" He has three children and lists his interests as hunting and opera.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999305009841919}",neutral,0.9999305009841919,0
