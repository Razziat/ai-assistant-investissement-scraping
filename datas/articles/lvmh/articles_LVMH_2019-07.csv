The deal calls for Ms. McCartney, the house’s founder, to continue in her role as the brand’s creative director, and as the majority owner of the Stella McCartney business. She will also become a special adviser to Bernard Arnault, LVMH’s chairman, and to the LVMH board on the topic of sustainability, or how the fashion industry can reduce its famously negative impact on the environment.

Financial details of the partnership were not disclosed. The full scope of the agreement is to be disclosed in September.

Mr. Arnault said in a statement that Ms. McCartney’s longtime commitment to sustainability and ethical issues had been “a decisive factor” in bringing the parties together. He also cited the company’s creation of its own sustainability department more than 25 years ago. “Stella will help us further increase awareness on these important topics,” he said ."

Stella McCartney and LVMH announce a new partnership to further develop the Stella McCartney House"
Why LVMH Struck a Deal with Stella McCartney - The Business of Fashion,"Mon, 15 Jul 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzb2ZmYXNoaW9uLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy9uZXdzLWFuYWx5c2lzL3N0ZWxsYS1tY2NhcnRuZXktbHZtaC1hY3F1aXNpdGlvbi1rZXJpbmcv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS, France — A little over a year after French luxury group Kering SA split with Stella McCartney, arch rival LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton has inked a deal with the ethical fashion label.

While the companies won’t disclose full details of the new arrangement until September, LVMH said Stella McCartney will stay as creative director of her namesake brand and retain majority ownership, marking a rare instance where LVMH has been willing to take a minority stake.

The move comes after Stella McCartney bought back Kering's 50 percent stake in her brand last March, ending a 17-year-long partnership. LVMH and Kering have clashed in the past over control of fashion assets, but it's unusual for a label's ownership to pass from one to the other.

Stella McCartney said in a statement that she had received multiple approaches from investors since breaking up with Kering, but ""none could match the conversation I had with Bernard Arnault and his son Antoine,"" referring to the LVMH chairman and his eldest son, who is CEO of Berluti and chairman of Loro Piana, which are both owned by the group.

LVMH said its investment in Stella McCartney is intended to accelerate the global growth of the brand. ""We are convinced of the great long-term potential of her house,"" said Bernard Arnault. Yet the scale of the Stella McCartney label is a drop in the bucket for the group, which posted a record annual revenue of €46 billion in 2018.

Kering does not break out financial performance for its smaller fashion brands, but Stella McCartney is thought to currently generate about €300 million in annual revenue, according to estimates. (The retail value of Stella McCartney products is likely higher thanks to branded collaborations like an activewear collection with Adidas).

That said, the label has been at the forefront of the growing conversation amongst consumers and regulators around sustainable and ethical fashion. McCartney is a life-long vegetarian and a vocal advocate of animal rights. Her brand — which does not use leather, fur or other animal products — is perhaps the most prominent symbol of sustainability in the luxury market.

For many, fashion's efforts to clean up its act aren't happening fast enough. A recent report by the Global Fashion Agenda, Boston Consulting Group and the Sustainable Apparel Coalition found that efforts to reduce fashion's negative social and environmental impact aren't keeping pace with the industry's rapid growth.

It's an area where LVMH has been seen to be lagging Kering, which publishes an annual environmental profit & loss report and is spearheading an initiative mandated by French President Emanuel Macron to rally the industry around sustainability goals. Kering cash cow Gucci publicly renounced the use of animal fur in 2017.

“A decisive factor was that she was the first to put sustainability and ethical issues on the front stage, very early on,” added Arnault, commenting on the Stella McCartney deal. ""It emphasizes LVMH Group's commitment to sustainability. LVMH was the first large company in France to create a sustainability department, more than 25 years ago, and Stella will help us further increase awareness on these important topics.""

As part of the transaction, McCartney will become a special advisor on sustainability to Arnault and the group's executive committee.

""It's another concrete step that the group is looking at sustainability as structural trend to invest on,” said industry analyst Mario Ortelli. “This is clearly this is not a deal that will change the balance sheet for LVMH.”

The group's previous foray into ethical fashion ended badly. Last summer, LVMH divested from failed made-in-Africa brand Edun, transferring its 49 percent stake back to founders Ali Hewson and Bono after the label ceased operations.

Disclosure: LVMH is part of a group of investors who, together, hold a minority interest in The Business of Fashion. All investors have signed shareholders’ documentation guaranteeing BoF’s complete editorial independence.

The company uses “fur-free fur,” vegetarian leather and natural, sustainable materials such as wool and silk in its designs. Last year, McCartney announced a new charitable branch of the business (Stella McCartney Cares Green) focused on sustainability and public policy.

On Monday, McCartney’s London-based brand and the global luxury group LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton announced that they are teaming up, with McCartney “to hold a specific position and role on sustainability as special advisor to Mr. [Bernard] Arnault and the executive committee members,” according to a press statement from LVMH, which further noted that the companies “have reached an agreement to further develop the Stella McCartney house.”

Further financial details about the deal will not be disclosed until September, except that McCartney will continue as creative director and majority owner of her brand. Arnault, chairman and CEO of LVMH, said in a statement: “It is the beginning of a beautiful story together, and we are convinced of the great long-term potential of her House. A decisive factor was that she was the first to put sustainability and ethical issues on the front stage, very early on, and built her House around these constraints. It emphasizes LVMH Groups’ commitment to sustainability. LVMH was the first large company in France to create a sustainability department, more than 25 years ago, and Stella will help us further increase awareness on these important topics.”

In March, McCartney announced that she would buy then-parent company Kering’s 50 percent share in her namesake fashion label to take back control of her brand. (The French luxury conglomerate’s stable of fashion labels includes Gucci, Saint Laurent, Balenciaga and Alexander McQueen, and it had had a share in McCartney’s business since the time it was founded in 2001). The business move marks an alignment with Kering’s chief rival. Under LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton’s umbrella are Rihanna’s new Fenty label, as well as Dior, Louis Vuitton, Givenchy, Celine and Fendi (one of the last major luxury brands to still use fur, as featured in its fall 2019 couture show in Rome earlier this month).

In May, French president Emmanuel Macron tapped Kering CEO Francois-Henri Pinault (known for his leadership on sustainable business practices) to helm sustainability goals for a group of luxury brands ahead of the G7 summit in August in Biarritz, France. The partnership with McCartney is a coup for LVMH, which has also made efforts in the arena, launching its program LIFE (LVMH Initiatives for the Environment) in 2012 to improve energy efficiency, reduce its carbon footprint, support programs to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and more.

McCartney added in the statement that, while approached by “various parties” since parting ways with Kering last year, “the passion and commitment [LVMH] expressed towards the Stella McCartney brand alongside their belief in the ambitions and our values as the global leader in sustainable luxury fashion was truly impressive.”

McCartney’s spring 2020 menswear collection, shown in Milan last month, had the theme of “Forces for Nature” with models holding protest signs with phrases such as, “We are entirely free to live differently,” inspired by Jonathan Safran’s forthcoming book We Are the Weather: Saving the Planet Begins at Breakfast on global climate change. The collection, made of 60 percent sustainable fabrics such as organic cotton and recycled polyester, was also nature-friendly in appearance, blooming with floral prints and patterns of the Earth viewed by satellite."

Arnault, the chairman and CEO of the luxury goods conglomerate LVMH, saw his net worth jump to US$107.6 billion on July 16 following a spike in his company's shares.

French billionaire Bernard Arnault has became the second wealthiest person in the world, according to Bloomberg.

Money is just a consequence. I always say to my team, don’t worry too much about profitability. If you do your job well, the profitability will come Bernard Arnault, chairman and CEO, LVMH

The 70-year-old had started 2019 as the fourth richest person in the world, but after earning US$39 billion since then he surpassed both the American magnate and investor Warren Buffett, and Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.

Arnault’s increased net worth saw him move ahead of Gates by more than US$200 million.

Over the years, Arnault has shared his thoughts on money, success, leadership, and power. His outlook can serve as a blueprint to entrepreneurs aspiring to follow in his footsteps.

Check out 13 of Arnault’s best quotes.

1. “All that interests me is promoting my brands, never myself.”

2. “My work is to help innovators and designers understand that the success of their creativity is in large part based on the success of their products. Creativity – yes, but executed in a way that people like and can use.”

3. “The goal of a start-up is not to stay a start-up. The goal of a start-up is to grow and to become, if possible, a large company.”

Happiness for me is really leading the team and, if possible, leading them to the top Bernard Arnault

6. “I remember people telling me, it does not make sense to put together so many brands. And it was a success, it was a recognised success, and for the last 10 years now, every competitor is trying to imitate. I think they are not successful, but they try.”

What I have fun with is trying to transform creativity into business reality all over the world. To do this, you have to be connected to innovators and designers, but also make their ideas liveable and concrete Bernard Arnault

7. “What I have fun with is trying to transform creativity into business reality all over the world. To do this, you have to be connected to innovators and designers, but also make their ideas liveable and concrete.”

8. “In business, I think the most important thing is to position yourself for long-term and not be too impatient, which I am by nature, and I have to control myself.”

9. “I often say to my team we should behave as if we're still a start-up. Don’t go to the offices too much. Stay on the ground with the customer or with the designers as they work. I visit stores every week. I always look for the store managers. I want to see them on the ground, not in their offices doing paperwork.”

10. “I am very competitive. I always want to win.”

11. “What feels good is choice. Having the freedom of choice. The only thing that is imposed on me professionally speaking is my own long-term vision of things.”

12. “People think of politicians having true power, but that’s less and less true. After all, they are often constrained or being edged into a corner by a whole series of contingencies ... I’m lucky in that I can say, ‘I want my group to be in such and such a situation in 10 or 20 years’ time’ and then formulate a plan to make that happen.”

I am very competitive. I always want to win. Bernard Arnault

13. “You have to be just as mistrustful of straightforward rationality in business as you do of a uniquely gut approach.”

Stella McCartney signs deal with French luxury group LVMH - The Guardian,"Mon, 15 Jul 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9mYXNoaW9uLzIwMTkvanVsLzE1L3N0ZWxsYS1tY2NhcnRuZXktc2lnbnMtZGVhbC13aXRoLWZyZW5jaC1sdXh1cnktZ3JvdXAtbHZtaNIBaWh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9mYXNoaW9uLzIwMTkvanVsLzE1L3N0ZWxsYS1tY2NhcnRuZXktc2lnbnMtZGVhbC13aXRoLWZyZW5jaC1sdXh1cnktZ3JvdXAtbHZtaA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Stella McCartney has signed a deal with France’s largest luxury group, LVMH, to “accelerate its worldwide development in terms of business and strategy”.

The news, announced on Monday, comes just over a year after McCartney ended her 17-year business partnership with LVMH’s rival conglomerate, Kering, and bought back its 50% stake in her eponymous brand. Further details of the deal will be announced in September, although it has been confirmed that McCartney will remain majority owner and continue as creative director. She currently oversees womenswear, menswear and childrenswear collections.

McCartney said on Monday that she had been approached by “various parties expressing their wish to partner and invest” since she gained full ownership, but “none could match the conversation” she had with LVMH owner Bernard Arnault and his son Antoine. “The passion and commitment they expressed towards the Stella McCartney brand alongside their belief in the ambitions and our values as the global leader in sustainable luxury fashion was truly impressive.”

The news follows LVMH’s announcement in May that it is partnering with Unesco on a five-year deal, allowing the fashion houses in the group access to “a network of experts at the regional level and in different disciplines to drive the development and success of their initiatives to protect biodiversity” and secure transparent supply chains.

The acquisition by LVMH, which owns Louis Vuitton, Christian Dior and Givenchy, comes as the fashion industry grapples with major questions concerning sustainability. Bringing McCartney – the most famous figurehead for sustainability in the industry – into the fold will be seen as a major coup.

In a statement released by the group, Arnault took the opportunity to point out that “LVMH was the first large company in France to create a sustainability department, more than 25 years ago” and expressed his happiness at the deal. “It is the beginning of a beautiful story together, and we are convinced of the great long-term potential of her House. A decisive factor was that she was the first to put sustainability and ethical issues on the front stage, very early on, and built her House around these issues.”

McCartney is LVMH’s second high-profile signing this year. In May it announced it was launching an upmarket fashion label with the singer Rihanna, making her the first black woman to head up a fashion house at the company."

RAPAPORT... Sales and profit from watches and jewelry at LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton grew in the first half of 2019 amid a strong performance by its Bulgari brand, the company reported Wednesday.



Revenue for the categories rose 8% to EUR 2.14 billion ($2.38 billion) in the six months ending June 30, while profit increased 5% to EUR 357 million ($397.4 million).



“Bulgari made good progress in its stores, and continued to gain market share,” the group said. Lines such as Serpenti, B.Zero1, Diva and Fiorever performed well, as did the new high-end jewelry collection, Cinemagia, LVMH added.



Additionally, Chaumet’s Bee My Love, Liens and Josephine lines saw strong improvements, while watch brand Hublot continued to develop its store network, the company noted.



LVMH’s group revenue jumped 15% to EUR 25.08 billion ($27.92 billion), with increases across all categories. The US and Asia saw strong growth, as did Europe, particularly in France, which performed better in the second quarter than the first as protests in the country became less intense. Net profit climbed 14% to EUR 5.3 billion ($5.89 billion).



Last week, LVMH CEO Bernard Arnault edged out Bill Gates for the number-two spot on Bloomberg’s Billionaire’s Index, the first time in the list’s seven-year history Gates has been pushed out of that slot. Arnault’s fortune has increased to $107.6 billion as LVMH’s share price continues to grow, Bloomberg noted. The company’s stock price had risen around 1% at press time Thursday.

The world’s largest luxury group reported revenue of €25.1 billion, up 15 per cent from the year-ago period. Sales in the fashion and leather goods category, which accounts for about 50 per cent of profit at LVMH, grew by 18 per cent year-on-year to €10.4 billion.

This was ahead of analyst predictions of a 15 per cent increase and whether LVMH could beat that benchmark was the “million-dollar question”, says Luca Solca, a luxury analyst at Bernstein. LVMH released earnings after market close in Paris on Wednesday, but the results for that division should push the shares higher though they are currently trading near record highs, he says.

Luxury is booming globally

The company said that sales were strong globally, with turnover increasing in its four main markets of the US, Europe, Japan and the rest of Asia. France was a particular bright spot. LVMH’s home base posted double-digit gains after lagging in prior periods, with particular uplift in the second quarter when gilets jaunes protests that had shut down much of central Paris on Saturdays petered out.

The company also saw strong growth in Asia, with the political unrest in Hong Kong yet to impact the company’s business there, said chief financial officer Jean-Jacques Guiony on a call with analysts. He warned, however, that it was too soon to say how the violent protests might affect July sales in the Chinese territory, which accounts for between 5 to 10 per cent of global luxury goods consumption.

Stalwart brands are key

Keeping true to form, Guiony declined to give detailed comparisons on the performance of individual brands. However, Guiony noted that Dior’s “exceptional” growth was faster than the 18 per cent notched by the fashion and leather goods category, with Dior’s new 30 Montaigne handbag line a standout success.

Meanwhile, Louis Vuitton recorded “remarkable growth”, with both mainstay items and newer pieces from the likes of men’s creative director Virgil Abloh doing equally well."

The French luxury conglomerate, owner of brands such as Louis Vuitton, Celine or Dior, has closed the first half of its fiscal year with a rise of 8.7% in its net benefit, up to 3.2 billion euros (3.5 billion dollars).

Sales of the group have doubled its digits during the period. LVMH has registered a revenue of 25 billion euros (27.8 billion dollars) in the first half of its fiscal year, 15.3% more than the same period last year.

By categories, the group has risen its fashion and leather good sales during the first semester, with an increase of 21.3%, up to 10.4 billion dollars (11.6 billion dollars). Perfumes and cosmetics division have risen its income in 12.3%, while watches and jewelry have registered a rise of 7.9% compared to last period.

LVMH grew 33% its sales in Asia during the fist half

By regions, Asia, excluding Japan, has taken the lead. The company grew 33% in its sales in Asia, while in Japan revenues increased 7%.

In Europe, without including France, LVMH registered a growth of 17%, while in local sales, the group rose 9%. In United States the group’s incomes have also achieved double digits, with a rise of 23%."
"Kenneth Ize, the LVMH-prize finalist redefining African luxury - CNN","Tue, 16 Jul 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vc3R5bGUvYXJ0aWNsZS9rZW5uZXRoLWl6ZS1mYXNoaW9uLXByb2ZpbGUvaW5kZXguaHRtbNIBQWh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLmNubi5jb20vY25uL3N0eWxlL2FydGljbGUva2VubmV0aC1pemUtZmFzaGlvbi1wcm9maWxl?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"CNN —

Kenneth Ize’s name is on everyone’s lips. The Nigerian fashion designer and finalist for this year’s prestigious LVMH Prize, whose pieces have been worn by Naomi Campbell and Donald Glover, is giving a luxury finish to local artisanal aesthetics, rendering them desirable for high-end markets both at home and abroad.

As a result, Ize has never been busier. Speaking on the phone from Lagos, he often had to pause our conversation so he could speak with those around him about ongoing projects – the photoshoot he was overseeing, the production of his most recent menswear collection, which he presented in Paris at the end of June.

Laughing, Ize said his recent busyness had turned extreme multi-tasking into a way of life, which, as an emerging designer, he enthusiastically embraces.

“As a younger brand and as a millennial, I am in the space to do more things … and not have anybody (telling me) how to do it,” he said. “The actual beauty people can see in the work is (because) we have freedom to create what we want to create. And the whole point for me is about being really real.”

Authenticity and conviction come through in his work, which has seen him modernize the ancient craft of aso oke handweaving, a technique developed by the Yoruba people of south-western Nigeria.

Within Yoruba communities, Ize explained, the work of master weavers is highly regarded, and families often pass down fine fabrics as heirlooms or use them to create traditional Nigerian formalwear.

However, Ize’s aso oke fabrics, woven by his team in the western Nigerian town of Illorin, are fashioned into clean, contemporary silhouettes, expanding their appeal while celebrating the culture behind them.

“The goal now is to actually bring weaving into the Nigerian school curriculum,” he said. “But we also want to train adults, so we are building a site in Ilorin, as I want people to be able to come to my home country and learn something.”

As a graduate from Vienna’s Institute of Design, Ize knows first-hand the benefits of educational and cultural exchange, especially as fashion continues to grapple with questions about diversity: “At the same time we are teaching people … we are shifting the narrative,” he said.

To Ize, shifting the narrative also means using his line to tell “the stories that we as Nigerians have to tell.”

“For this season’s menswear, it’s a story about what happens after Christmas, a time when our parents – I mean the privileged ones – gave us pocket money, so there are new coats in the wardrobe,” he said.

The addition of his personal history, tastes and fantasies add honesty and piquancy to Ize’s work. But his clothes also resonate with customers because, as Ize explained, he’s making “pieces for today.”

For many of his customers, Ize’s clothes might be their first engagement with high-fashion made in Africa, which, as a continent, has long been excluded from conversations about luxury.

“I believe I am a professional in this industry and I force myself to do more each season,” he said. “I am telling the international audience it’s possible here.”"
"Greener Pastures: LVMH, Stella McCartney Ink a Deal With Eco Ambitions - WWD","Tue, 16 Jul 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3dkLmNvbS9mZWF0dXJlL2dyZWVuZXItcGFzdHVyZXMtbHZtaC1zdGVsbGEtbWNjYXJ0bmV5LWluay1kZWFsLWVjby1hbWJpdGlvbnMtMTIwMzIyMDcyNy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LONDON — Goodbye, François-Henri. Hello, Bernard.



In a deal that speaks to grand ambitions in the sustainability space and protecting the planet — and a major leap from one luxury titan, François-Henri Pinault and Kering, to his larger rival, Bernard Arnault — LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton has surprisingly taken a minority stake in the house of Stella McCartney. It also has tapped the green campaigner as a special adviser to LVMH chairman and chief executive officer Bernard Arnault and the executive committee members.

Having launched a Millennial-focused luxury maison with Rihanna under the Fenty label earlier this year, LVMH is now planting its flag firmly in the fields of green: Not only will the luxury giant support the growth of McCartney’s brand, it plans to give the designer, who has described herself as an “eco-weirdo,” carte blanche to preach the environmental gospel at LVMH.

While LVMH has long been committed to environmentally aware practices, it has been shy about touting its credentials, unlike some of its competitors. Yet it was the first large company in France to create a sustainability department, more than 25 years ago, and during its 2019 annual general meeting, it outlined its goals in eco-design, the responsible supply chain, combating climate change and improving the environmental performance of sites and stores.

Now, with Stella on board, it’s ready to roar.

Arnault said he was “extremely happy” about the partnership, and a decisive factor in the deal was McCartney’s early decision “to put sustainability and ethical issues on the front stage, and built her house around these constraints. It emphasizes LVMH Group’s commitment to sustainability.”

The luxury titan called Monday’s announcement “the beginning of a beautiful story together, and we are convinced of the great long-term potential of her house.” Although LVMH tends to take majority stakes or buy companies outright, it sometimes structures deals differently, working with partners or taking minority stakes, as it did with Jonathan Anderson and his JW Anderson brand.

For her part, McCartney got just what she wanted: She has retained a majority stake in her company, while under former partner Kering she had a 50-50 deal. She also has a new business partner who will be as, if not more, supportive on the eco-front, and that is key as sustainable practices don’t come cheaply.

In fashion and luxury, McCartney has been at the forefront of helping to source and develop textiles and manufacturing processes that are animal-friendly and sustainable. She was one of the first Kering brands to undertake an environmental profit-and-loss audit, which sees a company measure its impact on the environment.

She dubbed her women’s 2020 resort collection “Force of Nature” and the men’s spring 2020 collection “Eco Weirdo.”

“I think that’s important to take on board that we are still weirdos to the majority of the world, and we are fine with that. I am fine with being a weirdo, and it will probably never change,” said the buoyant designer during a walk-through of both collections last month in London.

T-shirts shouted “Eco Weirdo,” “Handle With Care, You’re Holding Planet Earth” or “SOS,” while fabrics included a type of viscose that was three years in the making, organic cotton, regenerated cashmere and nylon. Bags were made from eco Alta Napa leather and PVC was nowhere to be found. Since 2010 all products — both from Stella McCartney and the brand’s collaboration with Adidas — have been PVC-free.

McCartney said at that time that she always starts with the soil. “It is a big conversation with whomever we want to work with. Animal welfare is first and foremost. How are you are nurturing the soil? How do the animals live in their environment? At the end of the day, fashion is farming and it is raping the environment,” she said.

While it is understood that McCartney’s friendship with Arnault’s eldest son, Antoine Arnault, the ceo of Berluti and chairman of Loro Piana, helped to seal the deal, LVMH’s own green ambitions were also a clincher.

McCartney said Monday that nothing could match the conversation she had with Bernard and Antoine Arnault before she signed. “The passion and commitment they expressed toward the Stella McCartney brand alongside their belief in the ambitions and our values as the global leader in sustainable luxury fashion was truly impressive.

“The chance to realize and accelerate the full potential of the brand alongside Mr. Arnault and as part of the LVMH family, while still holding the majority ownership in the business, was an opportunity that hugely excited me.”

While Stella McCartney’s full revenue was never disclosed and always consolidated onto the Kering balance sheet, it is thought to be about 300 million euros. The company’s valuation when it split from Kering was estimated to be about 600 million euros, according to sources.

Melania Grippo, luxury analyst at Exane BNP Paribas, said the partnership with LVMH “should speed up the development of the brand, which aims to remain faithful to its commitment to sustainable and ethical luxury fashion.”

Grippo added that the transaction would have a limited impact on LVMH’s accounts — less than 1 percent of total sales — and that LVMH “has confirmed once again its ability to attract, nurture and develop brands.”

The deal, a win-win one for LVMH and McCartney, came as something of a surprise.

McCartney had been 50-50 partners with Kering for 17 years. In an interview with WWD, McCartney had described the split as amicable and said their relationship would steam ahead, with the designer planning to remain a board member of the Kering Foundation and continuing to collaborate with the French luxury giant on sustainability in fashion.

Those plans will likely have been undone by the LVMH deal. A McCartney spokesman did not return phone calls at press time, and a Kering spokesman declined to comment.

Stella McCartney and Kering parted ways after the latter began restructuring its portfolio. McCartney’s contract gave her the option to repurchase Kering’s stake, exercisable by March 31, 2018.

In the end, the designer went for the buyout, deciding she didn’t want to hand over full control to Kering, or remain 50-50 partners. At the time, McCartney said she wanted to strike out as an indie brand and explore the possibility of new partnerships.

“I have had an incredible relationship with Kering, and first and foremost with the Pinault family, whom I consider to be great friends. I’m incredibly close to them. We had such a successful business together, an incredible partnership. We never had any hiccups,” said McCartney during an interview from her airy new offices near Westfield London.

Over the years, McCartney had worked closely with Kering on building values around environmental sustainability and best practice, and had been a promoter of the group’s five-year partnership with London’s Center for Sustainable Fashion to support eco-friendly practices and innovation in the fashion industry.

Last year, Kering and London College of Fashion revealed the creation of the first open-access digital course in luxury fashion and sustainability called “Fashion & Sustainability: Understanding Luxury Fashion in a Changing World.”

The separation deal with Kering was to have taken two years, with the first and most important phase ending on March 31 this year, and Kering helping the Stella McCartney business tie up loose ends in back-office operations, and make a smooth exit by March 31, 2020.

Over the past few months, McCartney’s longtime ceo Frederick Lukoff left his job to take up a similar role at the contemporary brand Scotch & Soda, while Stephane Jaspar quit his role as chief marketing officer to assume the position of chief brand officer of The Webster.

The closing of the partnership with LVMH is subject to the usual conditions, in particular the approval of the competition authorities. LVMH said it will reveal more details about the partnership in September."

The sustainable luxury company has sealed an agreement with France’s other luxury giant, LVMH, which has acquired a minority stake in the brand. The new partners will detail the full scope of this deal in September, LVMH said in a press release.

McCartney will continue as creative director and ambassador of the brand, while holding majority ownership. She will also hold a specific position and role on sustainability as special advisor to Bernard Arnault, CEO of LVMH, and the executive committee members.

“The goal of this partnership will be for the Stella McCartney House to accelerate its worldwide development in terms of business and strategy, while of course remaining faithful to its long-lasting commitment to sustainable and ethical luxury fashion”, said LVMH.

Stella McCartney will serve as special advisor on sustainability to Bernard Arnault and the executive comittee

Bernard Arnault insisted that sustainability was “a decisive factor” in the operation. The closing of this partnership will be subject to the usual conditions, in particular the approval of the competition authorities.

Stella McCartney held a 50-50 joint venture with Kering until last year, when the designer bought back 100% of the company. The move was also part of Kering divestment in non-strategic businesses to focus on Gucci and fast-growing brands like Saint Laurent and Bottega Veneta.

This will be LVMH’s second venture in sustainability fashion, after the failure of Edun, a brand founded in 2005 by Ali Hewson and U2 singer Bono to promote trade in Africa by sourcing production throughout the continent. LVMH bought 49% of the company in 2009 but cut ties with three years later. The company then announced that was “restructuring its operations in preparation for its next chapter” following a joint review of the business."

News of the partnership, which is subject to regulatory approval, comes a year after McCartney acquired full control of her namesake brand from Kering, which had held a 50 per cent share for 17 years. LVMH said in a statement that the move would allow the brand to “accelerate its worldwide development in terms of business and strategy, while of course remaining faithful to its long-lasting commitment to sustainable and ethical luxury fashion.”

McCartney will remain majority owner and creative director of the brand. Financial terms were not disclosed, although LVMH said further details would be released in September. McCartney will also be appointed as a special advisor on sustainability to LVMH’s executive committee and to chairman and chief executive Bernard Arnault.

Stella McCartney has undergone significant changes since its split with Kering. Its longtime president Frederick Lukoff left the brand this year to join Scotch & Soda as chief executive, while McCartney’s deputy Stephane Jaspar also departed after more than 15 years at her side.

The designer said in an interview with Vogue Business earlier this month that while it was a privilege “as a woman [and] as a mother” to run an independent brand, she was open to a commercial partnership so long as she retained majority ownership.

Large companies usually have institutions as shareholders, and we usually see insiders owning shares in smaller companies. We also tend to see lower insider ownership in companies that were previously publicly owned.

LVMH Moët Hennessy - Louis Vuitton Société Européenne is a pretty big company. It has a market capitalization of €193b. Normally institutions would own a significant portion of a company this size. In the chart below below, we can see that institutions own shares in the company. Let's delve deeper into each type of owner, to discover more about MC.

ENXTPA:MC Ownership Summary, July 12th 2019

What Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About LVMH Moët Hennessy - Louis Vuitton Société Européenne?

Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.

LVMH Moët Hennessy - Louis Vuitton Société Européenne already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own 22% of the company. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong.

Insider Ownership Of LVMH Moët Hennessy - Louis Vuitton Société Européenne

While the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.

Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.

Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of LVMH Moët Hennessy - Louis Vuitton, Société Européenne in their own names. However, it's possible that insiders might have an indirect interest through a more complex structure. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amount to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own €761m worth of shares (at current prices). It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling.

General Public Ownership

The general public holds a 32% stake in MC. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.

Private Company Ownership

It seems that Private Companies own 46%, of the MC stock. Private companies may be related parties. Sometimes insiders have an interest in a public company through a holding in a private company, rather than in their own capacity as an individual. While it's hard to draw any broad stroke conclusions, it is worth noting as an area for further research.

Next Steps:

While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important.

I like to dive deeper into how a company has performed in the past. You can find historic revenue and earnings in this detailed graph.

Ultimately the future is most important. You can access this free report on analyst forecasts for the company.

Bernard Arnault replaces Bill Gates as world’s second richest billionaire - Style,"Wed, 17 Jul 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjbXAuY29tL21hZ2F6aW5lcy9zdHlsZS9jZWxlYnJpdHkvYXJ0aWNsZS8zMDE4OTY5L2JpbGwtZ2F0ZXMtb3V0LWJlcm5hcmQtYXJuYXVsdC1sdm1oLWJvc3MtdGFrZXMtc2Vjb25k0gF0aHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAuc2NtcC5jb20vbWFnYXppbmVzL3N0eWxlL2NlbGVicml0eS9hcnRpY2xlLzMwMTg5NjkvYmlsbC1nYXRlcy1vdXQtYmVybmFyZC1hcm5hdWx0LWx2bWgtYm9zcy10YWtlcy1zZWNvbmQ?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"However, that run ended on Tuesday when the Microsoft co-founder dropped to No 3 behind the new No 2, France’s Bernard Arnault, chairman and CEO of the luxury goods maker, LVMH Moët Hennessy.

Bill Gates has never been ranked lower than No 2 in the seven-year history of the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.

LVMH enjoyed record profits in 2018 with revenue of €46.8 billion (US$52.5 billion) – an increase of 10 per cent over the previous year.

This has pushed Arnault’s net worth to US$107.6 billion – ahead of Gates by more than US$200 million.

Arnault has added US$39 billion to his fortune in 2019 alone, the biggest individual gain by far among the 500 people in Bloomberg’s ranking.

This year has been particularly good to French tycoons, with Bernard Arnault, Kering’s Francois Pinault and cosmetics heir Francoise Bettencourt Meyers tacking on a combined US$57 billion

Arnault, 70, joined Gates and Amazon.com founder Jeff Bezos, the world’s richest person, in the most exclusive wealth club last month, when his fortune surpassed US$100 billion for the first time.

The trio’s collective wealth exceeds the individual market values of almost every company in the S&P 500 Index, including Walmart ExxonMobil and Walt Disney.

This year has been particularly good to French tycoons, with Arnault, Kering’s Francois Pinault and cosmetics heir Francoise Bettencourt Meyers tacking on a combined US$57 billion.

Arnault and his family are among luxury titans who pledged more than US$650 million in April for the reconstruction of Notre Dame Cathedral after fire ravaged the landmark church.

He controls about half of Paris-based LVMH through a family holding company and also owns a 97 per cent stake in Christian Dior, the fashion house founded three years before his birth in 1949.

Jeff Bezos’ net worth is up slightly this year to US$125 billion, even after reaching a divorce settlement with MacKenzie Bezos, which saw her keep a 4 per cent stake in his company, Amazon, worth US$38 billion

Arnault entered the luxury-goods market in 1984 by acquiring a textile group that owned Christian Dior.

Four years later, he sold the company’s other businesses and used the proceeds to buy a controlling stake in LVMH. His art collection of modern and contemporary paintings includes pieces by Jean-Michel Basquiat, Damien Hirst, Maurizio Cattelan, Andy Warhol and Pablo Picasso.

Were it not for Gates’s philanthropic endeavours, he would still be the world’s richest person.

Gates has donated more than US$35 billion to the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.

Bezos’ net worth is up slightly this year to US$125 billion, even after finalising his divorce settlement with former wife MacKenzie Bezos, which saw her keep a 4 per cent stake in his multinational technology company worth US$38 billion.

LVMH Signs Stella McCartney as Sustainability Fashion Focus Surges - Fortune,"Mon, 15 Jul 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vZm9ydHVuZS5jb20vMjAxOS8wNy8xNS9sdm1oLXNpZ25zLXN0ZWxsYS1tY2NhcnRuZXktc3VzdGFpbmFiaWxpdHktZmFzaGlvbi1sdXh1cnkv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LVMH will enter a partnership to develop the Stella McCartney fashion brand as luxury companies race to show consumers and regulators their commitment to reducing their environmental impact.

McCartney, whose namesake line is known for snubbing animal products like leather, fur, and feathers, while pioneering eco-friendly designs like glue-free sneakers, will maintain majority ownership of the brand. The move follows her decision to buy back a 50% stake in her label that was owned by LVMH’s rival, Kering, last year.

“We are convinced of the great long-term potential of her house,” LVMH Chairman and CEO Bernard Arnault said in a statement, adding that McCartney’s focus on sustainability and ethical issues had been decisive. “Stella will help us further increase awareness on these important topics.”

Concerns about sustainability in apparel has shifted from fast-fashion makers like H&M and sportswear giants like Nike to the luxury industry, with its reliance on animal-based materials like leather and cashmere. Prada SpA pledged last month to transition to recycled nylon for its iconic belt bags and backpacks, while Kering chief Francois-Henri Pinault—whose company owns Gucci and Saint Laurent—is spearheading an effort to get fashion makers to commit to new sustainability targets.

Officials in the French environment ministry have said it hopes to ban the practice of destroying unsold goods, widespread among luxury goods makers that don’t want to be seen discounting their products.

An LVMH spokesman declined to say how much the company would invest in the McCartney brand as part of the deal, the details of which are set to be outlined in September.

LVMH's Bernard Arnault Keeps Spending Money to Make Money - WWD,"Wed, 24 Jul 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3dkLmNvbS9mZWF0dXJlL2Jlcm5hcmQtYXJuYXVsdC1zcGVuZHMtbW9uZXktdG8tbWFrZS1tb25leS0xMjAzMjI2NjY0L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS — Bernard Arnault may be raking in the cash as LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton posted another quarter of strong growth, but he is also spending lavishly to make sure that Louis Vuitton, Dior and his other luxury brands maintain their market dominance once demand loses steam.

Shrugging off ongoing trade tensions, the group’s overall revenues were up 15 percent in the three months ended June 30 to 12.54 billion euros, helped by another strong performance in its key fashion and leather goods division. Sales were up 12 percent on an organic basis.

But profitability came under pressure as LVMH ramped up spending on marketing and stores by 15 percent in the first half.

Net profit rose 9 percent to 3.27 billion euros during the period, while profit from recurring operations advanced 14 percent to 5.29 billion euros, below consensus estimates. Operating profit margin stood at 21.1 percent, down from 21.4 percent in the same period a year ago, including an adverse foreign exchange hedging impact.

The numbers continue a string of strong results for the world’s luxury players, coming on the same day Moncler posted double-digit increases in profits and sales and a day after Hermès reported stellar figures.

“We are not milking the brands in good times,” Jean-Jacques Guiony, chief financial officer of LVMH, said on a conference call. “We are definitely investing behind the brands and we are investing behind all of them.”

Dior, for instance, recently opened a temporary boutique on Avenue des Champs-Élysées while its historic flagship on Avenue Montaigne undergoes renovations. Duty-free retailer DFS is gearing up for the opening next year of its T Galleria store in Paris as part of the long-delayed renovation of department store La Samaritaine.

“Investments into the brands[…]come when the business is good, with a view not only of supporting the existing momentum, but also reinforcing the brands to make them more resilient in the global environment, if the global environment was to become more difficult,” said Guiony.

“It’s certainly the right thing to do now if we want to strengthen further the strategic value of the portfolio,” he added.

“The message is that management is willing to reinvest the dividends of scale to accelerate market share gains, especially for its most profitable fashion and leather division,” said Rogerio Fujimori, an analyst at RBC. “This should make life tougher for smaller competitors fishing in the same pond, in our view.”

In addition, LVMH remains active on the acquisition front after snapping up luxury-travel operator Belmond for $2.6 billion last year.

The group said last week it had taken a minority stake in Stella McCartney’s fashion brand, and in May, it added another prestigious wine label to its collection with the purchase of Château du Galoupet, a maker of high-end rosé.

At the same time, the conglomerate has set up a luxury maison with singer and entrepreneur Rihanna under the Fenty label, making it the first fashion brand Arnault has launched from scratch since Christian Lacroix in 1987.

“The concept is definitely to invest in different brands, not necessarily something we have experienced in the past,” said Guiony, adding that it was too early to comment on the performance of the Fenty fashion label. “There will be some learnings, there will be some value, and it’s up to us to be good enough to extract it.”

LVMH can certainly afford its largesse. Its key fashion and leather goods division, which includes Louis Vuitton, Dior and Fendi, saw revenues jump 20 percent on a like-for-like basis to 5.31 billion euros during the second quarter, zooming past consensus estimates.

The division had posted organic growth of 13 percent in the same period a year ago, and recorded a 15 percent rise in like-for-like sales in the first quarter. “The global momentum is very good for most of the brands, if not all of them, and for most of the geographies, if not all of them,” said Guiony.

Vuitton and Dior led the pack, with Vuitton seeing a “noticeable improvement” in demand from Chinese consumers versus the first quarter, and Dior growing faster than the division as a whole, the executive reported. Meanwhile, France bounced back after a first quarter marred by gilets jaunes, or yellow vests, protests.

Yet Guiony said there was no “compelling” explanation for the division’s rapid progress.

“The comparison basis is not particularly easy. The Chinese customers are there, but not the only ones,” he said. “When we look at American customers, at European customers, all of them are double-digits, so it comes really from everywhere, so it’s really a testimony to the strength in the brand, not to a specific factor.”

Even Hong Kong seems to be immune so far to protests against a controversial extradition bill. “So far, we have not experienced a very deep impact on the business,” Guiony said.

Fashion and leather goods performed better than all other segments. Wines and spirits were up 4 percent, with momentum particularly strong in the United States, Asia and emerging markets, while perfumes and cosmetics recorded organic growth of 10 percent.

Selective retailing grew 7 percent as Sephora continued to improve its performance in the U.S. against a challenging market for makeup, and growing competition from the likes of Ulta and Amazon, which is pushing into beauty with initiatives including the launch of Lady Gaga’s Haus Laboratories makeup line.

“For the time being, I don’t think there is particular evidence that Amazon will bite into Sephora or will not. It’s a bit early to say. We don’t have very precise numbers on what Amazon does on this segment,” Guiony demurred.

Online retailer 24 Sèvres, which re-branded as 24S during the quarter, remains in a “learning phase” and hopes it will capitalize on the fact that it is the only multibrand e-commerce site to stock the LVMH-owned Vuitton, Dior and Celine labels, he noted.

Watches and jewelry posted a 4 percent increase. Organic growth at Bulgari was flat compared to the first quarter, as it continues to clean up its jewelry and perfume wholesale channels, while Tag Heuer’s ongoing reengineering had a significant impact on the watchmaker’s margins.

The figures were the first to take into account IFRS 16, an accounting rule that requires companies to record all future lease rents as debt on the balance sheet. The impact on the balance sheet was an increase of 12 billion euros in non-current assets and non-current liabilities, Guiony said.

There was a positive impact of 77 million euros on profit from recurring operations, a negative effect of 68 million euros on profit before tax, and the accounting rule change gave rise to a financial charge of 145 million euros.

“All in all, I would say much ado about nothing. I would just point out the fact that the norm doesn’t allow us to restate 2018 numbers and therefore adds complexity to an already obscure and byzantine accounting modification, but that’s the way it is,” Guiony said.

Despite its heavy investments, the group sounded its customary cautious note about the economic outlook. “Obviously, the various threats to international trade should run first among our priorities. We are neither pessimistic nor optimistic, but we know our business is sensitive to tariffs and trade barriers,” said Guiony.

LVMH does not provide guidance, merely reiterating in familiar wording its plan to reinforce its global leadership position in luxury goods. “Despite buoyant demand, we will continue to manage costs and remain vigilant into the second half of the year,” Arnault said in a statement.

The luxury conglomerate’s share price is up 47 percent so far this year, propelling Arnault near the top of the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, where he briefly replaced Bill Gates as the world’s second richest person after Amazon founder and chief executive officer Jeff Bezos. Arnault is now back in third position, with a net worth of $106 billion."
LVMH Expected to Bring its Nearly $150 Million-Earning Dior Eyewear In-House in Larger Licensing Trend - The Fashion Law,"Mon, 01 Jul 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWZhc2hpb25sYXcuY29tL2x2bWgtZXhwZWN0ZWQtdG8tYnJpbmctaXRzLTE0My1taWxsaW9uLWVhcm5pbmctZGlvci1leWV3ZWFyLWluLWhvdXNlLWluLWxhdGVzdC1saWNlbnNpbmctdHJlbmQv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Christian Dior eyewear accounted for a whopping 13 percent of Safilo’s 2018 annual revenues of $1.1 billion, making the quickly approaching end of the Paris-based fashion brand’s licensing deal with the Italian eyewear group a particularly significant one. According to Reuters, Dior’s parent company Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton is expected to assign Dior’s eyewear license “to a joint venture it has with Marcolin, a rival to Safilo” beginning in 2020 in furtherance of its attempt to exercise greater control over the eyewear offerings of its roster of brands and “pocket the profit margins” that had previously been snapped up by third-party licensees.

In February 2017, LVMH and Italy-based Marcolin announced the formation of a “design and manufacturing joint venture,” in which LVMH holds a 51 percent stake. More than that, LVMH announced that it would take a 10 percent stake in Marcolin, itself, which subsequently revealed it will produce the eyewear for LVMH’s Celine and Louis Vuitton brands, with the number of LVMH-specific brands under its umbrella expected to grow over time. The two hope that the venture will result in a tripling of LVMH-branded eyewear to more than 4.5 million pairs of glasses each year.

The Marcolin-LVMH partnership – which, like any other licensing deal, sees brands trade off the right to use their names and logos in certain goods categories, such as eyewear, fragrance, beauty, and jewelry, among others, in exchange for oft-hefty royalties – has proven to be a sizable loss for Safilo. As of 2017, before the enactment of the Marcolin-LVMH venture, Safilo maintained coveted contracts giving it the right to manufacture and market eyewear for LVMH brands that were “worth $366 million, more than a quarter of its annual sales.”

While it is unclear what percentage of LVMH’s annual revenues that the sales from its eyewear licenses amount to, Kering – which first announced in 2014 that would put an end to its license agreement with eyewear maker Safilo and build an eyewear division “to tighten control over the business and gradually take back all of it licenses” – revealed in April that its eyewear division saw a 23% increase in sales for the first quarter of 2019, bringing sales to $145 million, a small but growing portion of the group’s total $4.3 billion revenues for the quarter.

Prior to bringing its eyewear in-house, Kering – which owns Gucci, Saint Laurent, Balenciaga, Bottega Veneta, and Alexander McQueen, among other brands – was reportedly bringing in more than $56 million in annual eyewear licensing royalties.

Both Kering and LVMH’s decision to more closely align themselves with their eyewear manufacturing and marketing comes amidst a larger trend among the industry’s biggest names of bringing traditionally licensed categories, such as eyewear and fragrance, in house in order to better control the image of their brands, diversify their businesses offerings, and boost sales on internally-made products.

However, it is worth noting that no small number of high fashion brands continue to rely on licensing deals to reap boost their bottom lines. The brand partners that eyewear giant Luxottica boasts – such as Burberry, Chanel, Coach, Dolce & Gabbana, Miu Miu, Prada, Versace, and Valentino, etc., and the ones that cosmetics company Interparums maintains – such as Coach, Jimmy Choo, Karl Lagerfeld, Lanvin, Oscar de la Renta, and Rochas, among others, plus those held by Coty – which produces fragrances for Burberry, Marc Jacobs, Gucci, Miu Miu, Balenciaga, Alexander McQueen, and Jil Sander, among others), demonstrate that many big names certainly are not shunning the practice at all."

Bernard Arnault dethroned the Microsoft co-founder as the second richest person in the world on Tuesday after the LVMH Moet Hennessy - Louis Vuitton chairman’s net worth hit $108 billion, according to the Billionaires Index. Gates, whose net worth is estimated to be $107 billion, has remained in the top two positions on the index since it was created seven years ago.

Holding on to the top spot is Jeff Bezos with a net worth of $125 billion.

Forbes also listed Arnault as the second richest person in the world with a net worth of $105.1 billion as of Wednesday. Gates’ estimated net worth by Forbes stood at $103.7 billion.

Arnault is relatively new to the exclusive “centibillionaires” club. He officially joined Bezos and Gates last month as the only people in the world worth more than $100 billion when LVMH hit a record 368.80 euros a share.

The LVMH chair is the richest person in Europe and his total worth is equivalent to more than 3 percent of France’s economy.

LVMH posted record sales and profits in 2018, and, in May, the French luxury giant made headlines when Rihanna announced the launch of her new fashion brand, Fenty, with LVMH. While he controls about 50 percent of LVMH, Arnault owns a 97 percent stake of the fashion house Christian Dior.

Gates would be the world’s richest person if you add in his charitable donations, Bloomberg reported. Gates and his wife Melinda donated more than $35 billion through their foundation.

"LVMH pairs with Stella McCartney, igniting fashion rivalries - Yahoo Finance","Mon, 15 Jul 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9sdm1oLXBhaXJzLXN0ZWxsYS1tY2NhcnRuZXktZXRoaWNhbC0xNjM5MzExMjUuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS (Reuters) - French luxury goods group LVMH <LVMH.PA> on Monday announced a tie-up with Stella McCartney, just months after the British designer known for her animal-friendly ethics ended a long-term partnership the conglomerate's arch-rival Kering <PRTP.PA>.

LVMH, which owns fashion labels including Givenchy, Louis Vuitton and Christian Dior, gave no financial details, though it said Stella McCartney would have majority ownership of her namesake label and stay on as creative chief.

Like industry rivals, LVMH has been increasingly vaunting its environmental credentials at a time when young shoppers in particular have shown a penchant for ""greener"" fashion and an interest in issues such as brands' use of animal fur.

McCartney has long been known as a trailblazer in this area, relying on imitation leather for her handbags or participating in initiatives to promote the second-hand luxury market.

""A decisive factor was that she was the first to put sustainability and ethical issues on the front stage, very early on,"" LVMH's billionaire boss Bernard Arnault said of the deal in a statement. The designer will advise LVMH's executive committee on these matters, the group added.

But LVMH's swoop also ramps up the competition with Kering.

The group - run by another French billionaire, Francois-Henri Pinault - is still a lot smaller than LVMH, which also owns champagne labels. But its crown jewel is Gucci, a brand long coveted by LVMH, and Kering had helped McCartney develop her brand over a 17-year joint venture.

That only ended when she fully bought back her 50% stake this March.

The designer was coy about her reasons for leaving, telling Reuters before the split was finalised: ""Having control of the company is important when your name is above the door and I think if you have that option it's rude not to.""

On Monday McCartney said in a statement that she had received interest from other investors.

Story continues

""While these approaches were interesting none could match the conversation I had with Bernard Arnault and his son Antoine,"" McCartney said, adding the group wanted to ""accelerate the full potential of the brand.""

The label has never broken out its full results, but was one of Kering's smaller brands, dwarfed by others like Saint Laurent and Balenciaga.

London-born Stella McCartney, daughter of the Beatles' Paul McCartney, first made her mark at Richemont-owned fashion label Chloe. She launched her eponymous label in partnership with the Gucci Group, formerly a division of what is now Kering, in 2001.

"LVMH, Stella McCartney Brand Form Partnership - JCK","Tue, 16 Jul 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmpja29ubGluZS5jb20vZWRpdG9yaWFsLWFydGljbGUvbHZtaC1zdGVsbGEtbWNjYXJ0bmV5LXBhcnRuZXJzaGlwL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LVMH has bought a minority stake in the Stella McCartney brand, a year after the designer’s split with rival luxury conglomerate Kering.

McCartney will continue as the brand’s creative director and brand ambassador and will retain majority ownership, a statement said. She will also advise LVMH chairman and chief executive officer Bernard Arnault and the group’s executive committee on sustainability, it added.

The “full scope” of the new partnership will be announced in September, it said.

While primarily known for its clothes, the McCartney brand also produces jewelry, including an Alice in Wonderland–themed costume jewelry collection for Disney.

McCartney, the daughter of musician Paul, launched her brand in 2001 as a 50-50 venture with Gucci Group, which has since been renamed Kering. In March 2018, the conglomerate and designer went their separate ways, and McCartney became its sole owner.

“It is the right moment to acquire the full control of the company bearing my name,” she said at the time.

Now, she is back with another, even bigger conglomerate. McCartney didn’t explain the reason for change of heart, but said in a statement that the brand has received “many approaches” from interested parties since the Kering split.

“While these approaches were interesting, none could match the conversation I had with Bernard Arnault and his son Antoine,” she said. “The passion and commitment they expressed toward the Stella McCartney brand alongside their belief in the ambitions and our values as the global leader in sustainable luxury fashion was truly impressive.”

In the same statement, Arnault said the reason LVMH became interested in the brand was that McCartney “was the first to put sustainability and ethical issues on the front stage, very early on, and built her house around these issues. It emphasizes LVMH Group’s commitment to sustainability.”

In May, LVMH announced it was launching a luxury line with singer Rihanna.

"Kering, LVMH Host Roundtable Talks on Well-being of Models - WWD","Thu, 11 Jul 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3dkLmNvbS9mYXNoaW9uLW5ld3MvZmFzaGlvbi1mZWF0dXJlcy9rZXJpbmctbHZtaC1ob3N0LXJvdW5kdGFibGUtdGFsay1vbi1tb2RlbC13ZWxsLWJlaW5nLTEyMDMyMTk1NDYv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS — Luxury rivals LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton and Kering teamed up to host a day of spirited roundtable discussions on the well-being of models, nearly two years after the groups joined forces to draft a charter aimed at improving working conditions for models. Two new signatories were announced: Publicis and Oscar de la Renta.

There were plenty of nods to progress made, but sticky issues were also highlighted, such as the need to improve support for models in early and late stages of their careers — which everyone agreed are getting shorter in these fast-paced times — as well as the importance of vetting modeling agencies from countries where there is less oversight.

“To me, it seemed important to organize a day that can be seen as a step but that also allows us to conclude the first chapter, so to speak — that’s the objective of this day,” said Marie-Claire Daveu, chief sustainability officer and head of international institutional affairs at Kering, in opening remarks to an auditorium filled with around 150 people, including models, editors and representatives from modeling agencies.

In fall 2017, in a context of increased social media scrutiny on working conditions of models, the companies challenged the industry to change entrenched habits, throwing their combined weight behind a charter introducing measures such as banning size-zero and under-16 models for shows of their fashion houses, including Louis Vuitton, Gucci, Saint Laurent and Celine. The charter was sponsored by Kering chairman and chief executive officer François-Henri Pinault and Antoine Arnault, who heads communication and image at LVMH and is ceo of Berluti. Neither of the executives was present Thursday, but their names came up more than once during the discussions.

“When it was written, the charter was a fairly novel idea, bringing together two competitors in an act born of shared conviction that it is our ethical and social responsibility to ensure the well-being of all models who work in our houses,” said Daveu.

The companies both stressed that there is work still to be done.

“Of course two years have not transformed everything, resolved everything,” said Marc-Antoine Jamet, secretary-general of LVMH, noting the effort on both parties to carve out time to reflect on the issue.

“There is a collective responsibility, it’s not exclusively up to models, artistic directors, agencies or companies,” he added.

Both executives addressed a point of difference between the two groups. Kering in May revealed it will raise the minimum age of models it works with to 18 starting next year, while LVMH executives declined to follow suit, saying they work with a small proportion of models under 18, but do so in an environment with strict oversight.

“It can happen that we bring different solutions; to shared goals there can be separate methods,” said Jamet.

The executives stressed they felt there was a “before” and an “after” the signing of the charter, with Jamet noting it brought issues like confidence, self esteem and moral values into the debate. Meanwhile, Daveu expressed satisfaction with how fashion houses have adopted the terms and the spirit of the effort.

Cyril Brulé, founder and director of Viva Model Management and president of the National Union of Modeling Agencies, which goes by the French acronym SYNAM, agreed.

“Before the existence of the charter, there wasn’t this discourse, there wasn’t this exchange with fashion houses, with groups. I think what has been done is important at all levels,” he said.

“Models finally felt listened to, recognized and understood — it was an enormous relief for them,” he added.

Caroline de Maigret spoke about the importance of education. Being French, and equipped with an education that helped give her perspective helped her in her modeling career, she said, while she has seen young women today who have families relying on their success, making it more difficult to deal with defeat and humiliation.

“People told me to redo my nose, which I found absurd — but it can be harder for others when they are faced with humiliation,” she said. De Maigret suggested models be briefed upon arrival at an agency, including helping them understand when to say “no.”

At break time, a clutch of LVMH and Kering executives huddled together briefly to exchange thoughts on the morning discussions. Aaron Miller, a model from London, surveyed the room, noticing the canvas bags marked “wecareformodels.com” — a web site to promote the charter — against a salmon backdrop.

“I thought it was very feminine-based — even the bag is pink — they keep on saying ‘women.’ We have very different problems, men and women,” he said. Men have a lot of insecurities, too, he added.

“A lot of 16-year-olds are traveling from China, Russia, Japan to Milan who don’t have a clue what they’re doing, they’re just left to walk to castings,” Miller said."

French luxury and fashion giant LVMH said on Monday that it will take a 10 per cent stake in Stella McCartney’s design house, which has cut ties with LVMH’s fierce rival Kering after 17 years.

The accord will help “accelerate the worldwide development” of the company, it said, adding that further details on the deal would be forthcoming later this year.

Stella McCartney – noted for her environmental credentials and concerns – will also become a “special adviser” to LVMH head Bernard Arnault on sustainable development policies, it added.

LVMH is the world’s biggest luxury and fashion company which Arnault has built up steadily in rivalry with Francois-Henri Pinault’s Kering group.

“I am extremely happy with this partnership with Stella. It is the beginning of a beautiful story together, and we are convinced of the great long-term potential of her [company],” Arnault said.

“A decisive factor was that she was the first to put sustainability and ethical issues on the front stage, very early on, and built her [company] around these issues,” he added.

Stella McCartney said that since her decision to quit the Kering tie-up and take back control of her company, there had been many approaches “from various parties expressing their wish to partner and invest”.

“While these approaches were interesting none could match the conversation I had with Bernard Arnault and his son Antoine,” she said.

LVMH announced in May that it was backing pop idol Rihanna in the launch of her own luxury brand.

LVMH Chairman Bernard Arnault is Now the 2nd Richest Person in the World - The Fashion Law,"Wed, 17 Jul 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWZhc2hpb25sYXcuY29tL2x2bWgtY2hhaXJtYW4tYmVybmFyZC1hcm5hdWx0LWlzLW5vdy10aGUtMm5kLXJpY2hlc3QtbWFuLWluLXRoZS13b3JsZC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Bill Gates is no longer the second-richest person in the world, per Bloomberg’s and Forbes’ respective billionaires lists; LVMH Moët Hennessy chairman Bernard Arnault is. 70-year old Arnault – who made headlines last month when his fortune topped $100 billion, thereby making him a centibillionaire, a position currently held by just three people in the world – has a net worth of $107.6 billion, putting him just ahead of Microsoft founder Gates, who is worth $107 billion.

The LVMH chairman, whose conglomerate owns Louis Vuitton, Dior, Givenchy, Celine, Loewe, and Marc Jacobs, among 70 or so other fashion and non-fashion luxury brands, has been inching up the upper echelon of Forbes’ “World’s Richest” list over the past year, in particular. He first ousted Spanish billionaire Amancio Ortega – the force behind retail conglomerate Inditex and its roster of Zara, Zara Home, Massimo Dutti, Bershka, Oysho, Pull and Bear, Stradivarius and Uterqüe – from the number 4 spot on the world’s richest list, as well as for the titles of the wealthiest figure in Europe and the wealthiest figure in fashion.

Arnault advanced again recently, this time surpassing 88-year old American business magnate Warren Buffett thanks to an LVMH stock surge after the group released its first quarter earnings report in April. That landed him in the top three, following behind Amazon’s Bezos and Microsoft-founder Gates, only to overtake Gates almost 4 months later when LVMH’s stock advanced to a record high on Tuesday, thereby, pushing Arnault’s net worth to $107.6 billion.

Over the past year, alone, Arnault has added nearly $40 billion to his fortune, “the biggest individual gain by far among the 500 people on Bloomberg’s ranking,” the publication noted, largely thanks to gains in LVMH’s shares.

Bloomberg asserted on Tuesday that “were it not for Gates’ philanthropic giving,” largely by way of his Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which had given away $50.1 billion as of Q4 in 2018, “he’d still be the world’s richest person.”

Warren Buffett – who has pledged to give away 99 percent of his wealth either during his lifetime or upon his death – would similarly rank higher but for his launch of the Giving Pledge. A campaign that Buffett and Gates created together in 2010, the Giving Pledge calls on the world’s wealthiest individuals and families to pledge to donate at least 50 percent of their wealth to charitable and/or philanthropic causes during their lifetimes or in their wills.

Buffett and Gates have persuaded others in the top 10 richest category, such as Mark Zuckerberg and Larry Ellison, to join its long list of more than 200 participants, who, according to the Pledge, have promised to “give to a diverse range of issues including poverty alleviation, refugee aid, disaster relief, global health, education, women and girls’ empowerment, medical research, arts and culture, criminal justice reform, and environmental sustainability.”

Neither Jeff Bezos, who holds the top spot on Bloomberg and Forbes’ billionaires lists, nor Bernard Arnault have opted to join the Giving Pledge campaign."
Moncler and LVMH Set the Bar High for Luxury Competitors - The Business of Fashion,"Wed, 24 Jul 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzb2ZmYXNoaW9uLmNvbS9uZXdzL25ld3MtYW5hbHlzaXMvbW9uY2xlci1hbmQtbHZtaC1zZXQtdGhlLWJhci1oaWdoLWZvci1sdXh1cnktY29tcGV0aXRvcnMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"NEW YORK, United States — Jacket maker Moncler joined Louis Vuitton owner LVMH on Wednesday in reporting a pick up in sales growth in the second quarter, as the luxury firms capitalised on strong Chinese demand and investments in marketing and new designs.

The industry's top players are riding high on demand for branded goods across Asia and particularly in mainland China, in spite of a Beijing-Washington trade war that could ultimately weigh on consumer sentiment.

""With Chinese customers, there was a noticeable improvement between the first quarter and the second quarter,"" LVMH's Financial Director Jean-Jacques Guiony told analysts.

That benign backdrop has so far boosted sales at fashion labels in turnaround mode like Britain's Burberry as well as sector stalwarts such as Birkin bag maker Hermes in the April to June period.

Kering and its Gucci brand, due to report first-half earnings on Thursday, should benefit too.

But Moncler and LVMH — two of the top luxury performers on the stock market so far this year — also owe their momentum to attempts to attract young shoppers with novel marketing techniques, investments in e-commerce and a shake-up in their products and designs.

Within Paris-based LVMH, the world's biggest luxury conglomerate, Vuitton is betting on temporary pop-up stores to spike consumer interest and has turned to DJ-turned-designer Virgil Abloh to grow its menswear lines.

Its Christian Dior brand, while still estimated to be less than a third of Vuitton's size, was also one of the standouts of the second quarter, with sales growth exceeding the 20 percent of the broader fashion and leather goods unit, according to Guiony.

Overall, LVMH, whose other labels include champagne maker Moet & Chandon, said second quarter sales across the group rose 15 percent to €12.5 billion ($13.9 billion), up 12 percent at stable exchange rates and a comparable number of stores.

Analysts had expected like-for-like sales growth of around 10 percent, following 11 percent in the first quarter.

At the end of June, operating margins were a touch below forecasts, however, at 21.1 percent, in part due the step-up in spending on advertising and its brands.

RIGHT DIRECTION?

Moncler, known for its wintry down coats, has tried to jazz up its ranges with special edition jackets from a roster of famous designers, and has stepped away from traditional catwalks shows to host edgier events in its stores.

Its sales growth accelerated further in the second quarter, with the firm posting an 18 percent revenue increase at constant exchange rates, after 14 percent in the first quarter.

""We have evidence we're moving in the right direction,"" CEO Remo Ruffini told analysts. Chief Operating Officer Robert Eggs said the buoyant sales trend had extended into July.

Other brands trying to revive more sluggish sales are also experimenting with similar models and now making a push in social media marketing, including Italian shoemaker Tod's and fashion house Prada.

Both LVMH and Moncler said sales had bounced back in France in the second quarter, in another potential boost for peers, helped by a decline in street protests that had hurt business at the start of the year and put off tourists.

Stella McCartney Heads to LVMH — The Daily Front Row - Daily Front Row,"Mon, 15 Jul 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiOGh0dHBzOi8vZmFzaGlvbndlZWtkYWlseS5jb20vc3RlbGxhLW1jY2FydG5leS1sdm1oLWRlYWwv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Stella McCartney is independent no longer. According to Business of Fashion the designer has signed a deal with LVMH. Specific details of the partnership have yet to be announced.

The news comes over a year after McCartney bought her brand back from LVMH’s rival, Kering. For 17 years Kering held a 50 percent stake in McCartney’s brand. The original contract featured a long-standing clause giving her the option to purchase the company’s stake in her brand. But she had to exercise that option by March 31 of 2018, or potentially lose it forever. At the time of the Kering separation it was unclear how McCartney would finance buying out her half of the brand.

UPDATE: Business of Fashion reports that McCartney will not only retain majority ownership, she will also stay on as creative director. More details of the deal will be released in September.

LVMH's decision to partner with the designer is part of the company's plan to accelerate its support of sustainability, having also partnered with Unesco.

Although exact details of the deal will remain under wraps until September, it has been revealed that McCartney will remain the majority stakeholder of her company and will continue to be the house's creative director, overseeing menswear, womenswear and childrenswear.

About a year ago, McCartney announced that she would be ending her 17-year partnership with Kering by buying back the 50 per cent stake she had sold to them. In an interview that was published last week, the designer said she had found the buy out ""reinvigorating"".

""[I did it to] protect my name, my history – it was kind of about heritage and family and continuation,"" she told The Observer.

The designer has clearly found more of what she was looking for in a partnership with LVMH, who also owns Dior, Givenchy and Louis Vuitton, and recently acquired Rihanna's luxury label, Fenty. In a statement about the deal, McCartney explained why she chose the company despite being approached by ""various parties expressing their wish to partner and invest"".

""None could match the conversation [I had with LVMH],"" she said. ""The passion and commitment they expressed towards the Stella McCartney brand alongside their belief in the ambitions and our values as the global leader in sustainable luxury fashion was truly impressive.""

LVMH's acquisition of Stella McCartney will be seen as an ongoing commitment to sustainability in the fashion industry, having also signed up to a five-year deal with Unesco, an opportunity that will give the company's brands access to a network of experts that will help them build more sustainable supply chains.

Bernard Arnault Net Worth: How His Fashion Empire Made Him the World's Second-Richest Person - Fortune,"Sat, 20 Jul 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vZm9ydHVuZS5jb20vMjAxOS8wNy8yMC9iZXJuYXJkLWFybmF1bHQtbmV0LXdvcnRoLXNlY2luZC1yaWNoZXN0LWJpbGxpb25zL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Louis Vuitton (LVMH) boss Bernard Arnault, 70, overtook Bill Gates to become the second richest person in the world, the Bloomberg Billionaires Index announced Wednesday—and he did it in style.



The French businessman, who is the force behind many of the biggest names in luxury, pushed to the second spot after a stellar year for LVMH, which saw company shares rise 43%. His net worth is now estimated at $107.6 billion—an increase of $39.1 billion in a single year.



This remains way short of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos’ $124 billion fortune. Yet Europe’s richest person—whose fortune is estimated to be equivalent to 3% of France’s GDP—is one of only three members in the ultra-exclusive centibillionaire’s club.



But just who is Bernard Arnault? And how did he make his fortune? More importantly, how does he manage to spend all that cash?

A fateful taxi ride

After studying engineering at the prestigious Ecole Polytechnique in Paris and graduating in 1971, Arnault joined his family’s construction company, Ferret-Savinel, as an engineer. Yet it was a chance meeting in New York that proved to have a far more dramatic impact.



Sitting in a yellow cab, Arnault asked the driver what he knew of France. “He could not name the president but he knew Dior,” Arnault recently told the Financial Times.

From there, Arnault’s course was set: within three years—and by the age of 30—he’d reinvented Ferret-Savinel as a real estate firm called Férinel, and replaced his father as company president. And in 1984, he embarked on an even more drastic venture. After lobbying the French government, he left Férinel and took up the reins of faltering textile company, Boussac—whose portfolio included the house of Dior—and systematically turned the company into the launchpad for his luxury empire. The purchase price? One Franc.

A luxury shopping spree

In 1987, Arnault was asked to mediate in the rancorous merger of Möet Hennessy and Louis Vuitton, largely because LV held the rights to Dior perfume and Henry Racamier, the 77-year-old chairman of LV, saw him as an ally, according to a report from the New York Times.



Arnault had other plans, however, and instead sided with Moet Hennessy boss, Alain Chevalier, and bought 27% of LVMH in combination with Guinness. This grew to 37% in 1988 and by 1989 Arnault was the biggest shareholder. A year later Racamier resigned from his own family firm and Arnault become both chairman and CEO of LVMH.



It was part of a rapid expansion that saw Arnault snap up luxury firms including Céline (1988), Berluti (1993), Guerlain (1994), Marc Jacobs (1997), Thomas Pink (1999), Fendi (2001), and DKNY (2001).

LVMH itself now comprises 75 ‘houses,’ including Dom Pérignon, Bulgari, Givenchy, and TAG Heuer. Alongside the 23-story LVMH Tower on New York’s 57th Street, the company owns the Cheval Blanc ski resort in Courchevel, the Hotel Cipriani in Venice (site of George Clooney’s 2016 wedding), the Orient Express, and luxury resorts in the Caribbean, Maldives, St. Tropez, and Paris.



In 1999, Arnault also invested in a small but enterprising DVD rental firm. It’s name? Netflix.

A bet pays off

Arnault was one of the first overseas businessmen to take the gamble of investing in China at the start of Deng Xiaoping’s market-economy reforms, opening a Louis Vuitton store in Beijing in 1992.



The risk has massively paid off over the years. In the first quarter of this year, for instance, LVMH reported a revenue increase of 16% to $14.10 billion, largely fueled by Chinese buyers, who account for over a third of the luxury sector’s sales.

“With the Chinese, the business is really moving from strength to strength,” Financial Director Jean-Jacques Guiony told reporters in April.

Going after Gucci

Like all business leaders, Arnault has suffered his fair share of failures along the way. Most notably, his 1999 attempt to takeover Gucci—described as “the bloodiest fight in fashion” by the New York Post—which resulted in litigation that Arnault ultimately lost. To his chagrin, the fashion house fell into the arms of arch-rival François Pinault for $2.92 billion.



In 2014, Arnault also admitted defeat in a four-year attempt to purchase luxury scarf-maker Hermès, after then-Hermès Chief Executive Patrick Thomas launched court proceedings to prevent LVMH from mounting a takeover. Arnault eventually agreed to relinquish his 23% stake in Hermès as a result.



Elsewhere, Arnault has unsuccessfully challenged the dominance of luxury auction houses Christie’s and Sotheby’s by buying British auctioneers Phillips in 1999 and got his fingers badly burnt with online retailer Boo.com, which went into liquidation in 2000.

Rising to second place

An April 10 release detailing first-quarter trading for LVMH, stated that, “All geographic regions are experiencing good growth.



“This includes a 20% increase in sales of fashion & leather goods, a 13 % rise in sales of wines & spirits and a 12 % increase in sales of perfumes & cosmetics. Overall, LMVH showed first-quarter growth of 16% and organic growth of 11% compared to 2018. Its overall revenue was around $14.3 billion.

These better-than-expected results have led to a 27% rise in LVMH shares since January 29, when the group announced record sales for 2018.



Arnault is not resting on his laurels, either. On April 17, LVMH announced the completion of its $3.2 billion deal for Belmond, making them part-owners or managers of 45 luxury hotel, restaurant, train, and river cruise properties.

Rihanna and Stella

On May 10, they followed this up with the creation of the new Fenty fashion line, centered around Barbadian pop star Rihanna.



“Designing a line like this with LVMH is an incredibly special moment for us,” Rihanna said in a release. “Mr. Arnault has given me a unique opportunity to develop a fashion house in the luxury sector, with no artistic limits. I couldn’t imagine a better partner both creatively and business-wise.”

More recently, LVMH announced a partnership with Stella McCartney’s name sake brand, which was publicly owned by rival company Kering until last year. The pair did not disclose the terms of the deal, but said it will allow McCartney to continue as creative director and majority owner of the brand.



“The chance to realize and accelerate the full potential of the brand alongside Mr. Arnault and as part of the LVMH family, while still holding the majority ownership in the business, was an opportunity that hugely excited me,” McCartney said in a release.



“It is the beginning of a beautiful story together, and we are convinced of the great long-term potential of her House,” said Arnault, before stressing that McCartney’s ethical principles were “a decisive factor”.



With the fashion world increasingly drawing criticism for its environmenal footprint, McCartney’s brand is clearly one that Arnault and LVMH can draw from.



“She was the first to put sustainability and ethical issues on the front stage, very early on, and built her House around these issues,” Arnault added about McCartney. “LVMH was the first large company in France to create a sustainability department, more than 25 years ago, and Stella will help us further increase awareness on these important topics.”

LVMH Boss Bernard Arnault Just Dethroned Bill Gates as the World’s Second-Richest Person - Robb Report,"Wed, 17 Jul 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vcm9iYnJlcG9ydC5jb20vbGlmZXN0eWxlL25ld3MvbHZtaC1iZXJuYXJkLWFybmF1bHQtd29ybGRzLXNlY29uZC1yaWNoZXN0LXBlcnNvbi0yODU4NDc5L9IBZGh0dHBzOi8vcm9iYnJlcG9ydC5jb20vbGlmZXN0eWxlL25ld3MvbHZtaC1iZXJuYXJkLWFybmF1bHQtd29ybGRzLXNlY29uZC1yaWNoZXN0LXBlcnNvbi0yODU4NDc5L2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"There’s still money left in luxury goods. Lots of it, in fact. Need proof? LVMH Chairman and CEO Bernard Arnault just dethroned Bill Gates as the second-richest person in the world with a total net worth of $108 billion.

On Tuesday, Arnault supplanted Gates as the new No. 2 on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, which is updated at the end of trading each day. The trading of spots marks the first time that the Microsoft co-founder, who the financial news service says is worth $107 billion, has fallen out of the top two since the list’s advent in 2012. The American philanthropist still sits above the French businessman on Forbes’ famed billionaires’ list as of press time. The financial publication puts the men’s worth at $103.4 billion and $103.1 billion, respectively.

Arnault’s leapfrogging of Gates is largely due in part to his wealth growing by $39 billion in 2019, according to Bloomberg Businessweek, by far the biggest individual gain by any of the 500 people included in the Billionaire Index. This year also marks the first time Arnaut’s net worth has eclipsed $100 billion.

Under his stewardship, LVMH has grown into a global luxury powerhouse over the past thirty years, and counts venerable brands such as Christian Dior, Louis Vuitton and Givenchy among its holdings. The last two months have seen the company launch the fashion house Fenty with Rihanna and ink an unexpected deal with Stella McCartney, who left the company’s chief rival, Kering, last year. According to Bloomberg, Arnault’s jump up the Billionaire Index ranking coincided with shares in LVMH climbing to a record high on Tuesday.

Despite the changes at no. 2 and 3 on the Billionaires Index, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos remains the world’s richest man by a comfortable margin, with a net worth of $125 billion. CNN notes that if it weren’t for his philanthropic giving—the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation has donated $35 billion to causes worldwide—Gates would be atop both Bloomberg and Forbes’ richest billionaires’ lists."
Luxury House LVMH Acquires Stella McCartney Brand in Sustainability Bid - vegconomist - the vegan business magazine,"Wed, 17 Jul 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vdmVnY29ub21pc3QuY29tL2Zhc2hpb24tZGVzaWduLWFuZC1iZWF1dHkvbHV4dXJ5LWhvdXNlLWx2bWgtYWNxdWlyZXMtc3RlbGxhLW1jY2FydG5leS1icmFuZC1pbi1zdXN0YWluYWJpbGl0eS1iaWQv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The Stella McCartney label has announced it has reached an agreement with luxury goods company LVMH (Moët Hennessy – Louis Vuitton SE) with Ms McCartney being taken aboard as a sustainability advisor. The acquisition comes at a time when several fashion labels are discontinuing the use of fur and becoming desperate to appear sustainable and gain credibility with ethically conscious milennials.

LVMH, which owns Louis Vuitton, Christian Dior and Givenchy, has acquired the Stella McCartney brand with Ms Mcartney retaining the majority share and remaining as creative director, and has allocated to McCartney a newly created role on sustainability as special advisor to Mr. Arnault and the executive committee members.

The Stella brand offers vegan leather alternatives and “fur-free fur”, launched a vegan clothes line last spring and released the popular vegan Stella McCartney Stan Smith shoes last September. Although her label declares itself as sustainable, and states that, “As a vegetarian brand, we never use leather, skin, fur or feathers,” it must be noted that due to its use of wool, silk, and cashmere, it is not a vegan brand.

Bernard Arnault, Chairman and CEO of LVMH, declared: “I am extremely happy with this partnership with Stella. It is the beginning of a beautiful story together, and we are convinced of the great long-term potential of her House. A decisive factor was that she was the first to put sustainability and ethical issues on the front stage, very early on, and built her House around these issues. It emphasizes LVMH Groups’ commitment to sustainability.”

It will be interesting to see how the role of McCartney will develop and whether LVMH (which to the present day has frequently used animal skins in its luxury accessories and reportedly still tests its cosmetics on animals) may or may not update its ethical standards in its apparent bid to commit to sustainability.

On Monday, McCartney commented, “The passion and commitment they expressed towards the Stella McCartney brand alongside their belief in the ambitions and our values as the global leader in sustainable luxury fashion was truly impressive.”"

PARIS/MILAN (Reuters) - Jacket maker Moncler <MONC.MI> joined Louis Vuitton owner LVMH <LVMH.PA> on Wednesday in reporting a pick up in sales growth in the second quarter, as the luxury firms capitalised on strong Chinese demand and investments in marketing and new designs.

The industry's top players are riding high on demand for branded goods across Asia and particularly in mainland China, in spite of a Beijing-Washington trade war that could ultimately weigh on consumer sentiment.

""With Chinese customers, there was a noticeable improvement between the first quarter and the second quarter,"" LVMH's Financial Director Jean-Jacques Guiony told analysts.

That benign backdrop has so far boosted sales at fashion labels in turnaround mode like Britain's Burberry <BRBY.L> as well as sector stalwarts such as Birkin bag maker Hermes <HRMS.PA> in the April to June period.

Kering <PRTP.PA> and its Gucci brand, due to report first-half earnings on Thursday, should benefit too.

But Moncler and LVMH - two of the top luxury performers on the stock market so far this year - also owe their momentum to attempts to attract young shoppers with novel marketing techniques, investments in e-commerce and a shake-up in their products and designs.

Within Paris-based LVMH, the world's biggest luxury conglomerate, Vuitton is betting on temporary pop-up stores to spike consumer interest and has turned to DJ-turned-designer Virgil Abloh to grow its menswear lines.

Its Christian Dior brand, while still estimated to be less than a third of Vuitton's size, was also one of the standouts of the second quarter, with sales growth exceeding the 20% of the broader fashion and leather goods unit, according to Guiony.

Overall, LVMH, whose other labels include champagne maker Moet & Chandon, said second quarter sales across the group rose 15% to 12.5 billion euros ($13.9 billion) euros, up 12% at stable exchange rates and a comparable number of stores.

Story continues

Analysts had expected like-for-like sales growth of around 10%, following 11% in the first quarter.

At the end of June, operating margins were a touch below forecasts, however, at 21.1%, in part due the step-up in spending on advertising and its brands.

RIGHT DIRECTION?

Moncler, known for its wintry down coats, has tried to jazz up its ranges with special edition jackets from a roster of famous designers, and has stepped away from traditional catwalks shows to host edgier events in its stores.

Its sales growth accelerated further in the second quarter, with the firm posting an 18% revenue increase at constant exchange rates, after 14% in the first quarter.

""We have evidence we're moving in the right direction,"" CEO Remo Ruffini told analysts. Chief Operating Officer Robert Eggs said the buoyant sales trend had extended into July.

Other brands trying to revive more sluggish sales are also experimenting with similar models and now making a push in social media marketing, including Italian shoemaker Tod's <TOD.MI> and fashion house Prada <1913.HK>.

Both LVMH and Moncler said sales had bounced back in France in the second quarter, in another potential boost for peers, helped by a decline in street protests that had hurt business at the start of the year and put off tourists.

""This is not only a Chinese show,"" Guiony said.

LVMH's Institut des Métiers d'Excellence Introduce New Training Programs in Italy - WWD,"Thu, 04 Jul 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3dkLmNvbS9mZWF0dXJlL2x2bWhzLWluc3RpdHV0LWRlcy1tZXRpZXJzLWRleGNlbGxlbmNlLWludHJvZHVjZS1uZXctdHJhaW5pbmctcHJvZ3JhbXMtaW4taXRhbHktMTIwMzIxNDg0OS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"MILAN — LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton’s Institut des Métiers d’Excellence has expanded its scope with two new partnerships in Italy.

Founded in Paris in 2014, the luxury group’s vocational training program aims to promote, enhance and ensure the transmission of know-how that involves artisanal craftsmanship, creative and retail skills.

The training programs focus on women’s dressmaking and knitwear manufacturing.

The former, kicking off in October, will enable eight students to learn the skills and techniques to become creators of exceptional garments through one-year courses at the Roman Maria Antonietta Massoli Tailor Academy, which was established in 2015 in collaboration with Fendi.

“The IME-Accademia Massoli partnership is an important initiative for Fendi, confirming our commitment to transmitting unique savoir-faire in tailoring,” said Fendi chairman and chief executive officer Serge Brunschwig.

“It also embodies our desire to show young generations that métiers in craftsmanship in the luxury industry represent a real opportunity. This new program with Accademia Massoli is thus a unique chance to train the tailors of the future,” he added.

The knitwear program actually kicked off in June at the Accademia dei Mestieri Loro Piana, founded in 2015 in Italy’s Lombardy region. Nine students are taking part in the six-month training to learn the fundamentals of knitwear.

“Knitwear is a Loro Piana excellence, for which we are widely recognized. Our mission is to share the savoir-faire and great passion of our craftsmen with younger generations, showing them the opportunities related to the beauty of creating something unique with their hands,” said Loro Piana ceo Fabio d’Angelantonio. “The partnership between our Accademia dei Mestieri and IME is crucial as it is an opportunity to build on our work in synergy with the other IME programs.”

The launch of these two initiatives brings to seven the number of IME work/study programs offered in Italy.

They include a program teaching technical expertise in assembling women’s footwear in collaboration with the Politecnico Calzaturiero in Capriccio di Vigonza, near Padua; a “Master in Luxury, Customer Adviser” developed by Venice’s Università Ca’ Foscari and its Challenge School division; a program training men’s shoe artisans developed by the Berluti Académie du Savoir-faire in Ferrara, as well as two programs with Polimoda and For.Al in leather goods craftsmanship and jewelry, respectively."

Then, in less than a month, Arnault’s net worth continued to grow so quickly that he officially surpassed Gates on Tuesday to become the world’s second wealthiest person—after shares of his luxury conglomerate LVMH, trading on the Paris exchange, jumped to a new record high.

SEE ALSO: ‘Billionaire Town’ Where Jeff Bezos & Bill Gates Live Has No Money

Arnault’s net worth currently stands at $107 billion, about $200 million ahead of Gates, while still $20 billion behind Bezos.

Per Bloomberg’s calculation, Arnault is getting richer faster than anyone else on the list of the world’s 500 richest people. In 2019 so far, the 70-year-old tycoon has gained $39 billion in paper worth, thanks to his 50 percent ownership in LVMH (LVMHF) and 97 percent stake in Christian Dior, whose shares are also traded on the Paris exchange.

By contrast, Gates’ net worth is much less tied to equity ownership in a public company. Since his retirement in 2000, Gates has gradually reduced his stake in Microsoft from 24 percent to just 1.3 percent and transferred most of his equity ownership to his philanthropic vehicle, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. (Gates held the top spot on the list of the world’s billionaires for 18 years before Bezos dethroned him in 2017.)

Meanwhile, Arnault is just starting to establish his presence on the charity circuit. In April, his family pledged €200 million ($226 million) toward the restoration of the Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris after the cultural landmark was seriously damaged in a fire. However, since then, only €10 million ($11.2 million) of his committed funding has been released, Observer recently reported, as the reconstruction committee and big donors disagree on how the money should be spent."

After the once-innovative concept of cross-branded fashion collaborations exploded at the start of the new millennium, it was only a matter of time before the hospitality and travel industry wanted in on the action. The traditional formula of clothing brand “X” meets clothing brand “Y” eventually led to more unconventional partnerships, opening the door to categories like food, alcohol and even cars. Versace’s Lamborghini Murcielago from 2006, for example, is one for the books.

Hotels eventually fell in line, adopting the trend in their own ways. In 2010, Claridge’s London tapped Diane von Furstenberg to revamp its Grand Piano Suite with her eclectic touch. Over in New York, the St. Regis opened its Dior and Tiffany & Co. suites in 2011, and later followed up with rooms by Bottega Veneta and Bentley at its Istanbul and Rome locations, respectively. Meanwhile in Hong Kong, Éclat Beijing incorporated a BAPE-themed suite in 2013, complete with the label’s furniture and artwork.

Some brands opted out of the collaborative approach and instead launched entire hotel franchises all their own. Versace has been at the forefront of this game, opening its first Palazzo venue in Australia back in 2000. LVMH’s Cheval Blanc “Maisons” have expanded to include four locations and counting since the first edition landed in Courchevel, France in 2006. And Armani’s namesake chain kicked off right at the end of the decade, claiming a spot in Dubai’s iconic Burj Khalifa skyscraper in 2010.

“Today’s luxury travelers are looking for a truly one-of-a-kind experience, something that is customized and bespoke to fit their interests and desires,” St. Regis New York explained.

HYPEBEAST has gathered up seven such luxurious hotels and suites from around the world that were created by or in collaboration with fashion brands and designers. Read on for a closer look at offerings from LVMH, Ralph Lauren and more.

Stella McCartney has announced a partnership with luxury group LVMH in a bid to increase the global profile of her eponymous fashion brand.

According to a statement released on the LVMH website, the primary aim of the partnership is to boost the label's ""worldwide development in terms of business and strategy"", while also ensuring that it continues to promote ""sustainable and ethical luxury fashion"".

The British fashion designer will maintain majority ownership of the Stella McCartney brand, while also retaining her positions as its creative director and ambassador.

""Since the announcement of my decision to take full ownership of the Stella McCartney brand in March 2018 there have been many approaches from various parties expressing their wish to partner and invest in the Stella McCartney House,"" McCartney said.

The fashion designer added that she had been impressed by the ""passion and commitment"" expressed by Bernard Arnault, chairman and CEO of LVMH, and his son Antoine, CEO of menswear brand Berluti.

""The chance to realise and accelerate the full potential of the brand alongside Mr Arnault and as part of the LVMH, while still holding the majority ownership in the business, was an opportunity that hugely excited me,"" McCartney stated.

The ""full scope"" of the collaboration between McCartney and the French luxury conglomerate will be revealed in September, the news release states.

Arnault said he is ""extremely happy"" to be working closely with McCartney on the development of her brand.

""It is the beginning of a beautiful story together, and we are convinced of the great long-term potential of her house,"" the business investor stated.

""A decisive factor was that she was the first to put sustainability and ethical issues on the front stage, very early on, and built her house around these issues. It emphasises LVMH Groups' commitment to sustainability.""

McCartney launched her fashion label in 2001, in partnership with French luxury group Kering (then-called Gucci Group).

Last year, it was announced that Kering had sold its 50 per cent stake in the Stella McCartney brand to the designer.

Earlier this month, McCartney unveiled her new Beatles-inspired clothing collection.

The line consists of apparel inspired by the animated Beatles film Yellow Submarine, featuring a range of graphics, motifs and slogans which make direct reference to classic songs by the English rock band.

In May, Rihanna launched her debut fashion label Fenty under LVMH, making her the first black woman to lead a brand under the prestigious luxury group."

French luxury goods group LVMH (LVMH.PA) on Monday announced a tie-up with Stella McCartney, just months after the British designer known for her animal-friendly ethics ended a long-term partnership the conglomerate’s arch-rival Kering (PRTP.PA).

PARIS (Reuters)

LVMH, which owns fashion labels including Givenchy, Louis Vuitton and Christian Dior, gave no financial details, though it said Stella McCartney would have majority ownership of her namesake label and stay on as creative chief.

Like industry rivals, LVMH has been increasingly vaunting its environmental credentials at a time when young shoppers in particular have shown a penchant for “greener” fashion and an interest in issues such as brands’ use of animal fur.

McCartney has long been known as a trailblazer in this area, relying on imitation leather for her handbags or participating in initiatives to promote the second-hand luxury market.

“A decisive factor was that she was the first to put sustainability and ethical issues on the front stage, very early on,” LVMH’s billionaire boss Bernard Arnault said of the deal in a statement. The designer will advise LVMH’s executive committee on these matters, the group added.

But LVMH’s swoop also ramps up the competition with Kering.

The group – run by another French billionaire, Francois-Henri Pinault – is still a lot smaller than LVMH, which also owns champagne labels. But its crown jewel is Gucci, a brand long coveted by LVMH, and Kering had helped McCartney develop her brand over a 17-year joint venture.

That only ended when she fully bought back her 50% stake this March.

The designer was coy about her reasons for leaving, telling Reuters before the split was finalised: “Having control of the company is important when your name is above the door and I think if you have that option it’s rude not to.”

On Monday McCartney said in a statement that she had received interest from other investors.

“While these approaches were interesting none could match the conversation I had with Bernard Arnault and his son Antoine,” McCartney said, adding the group wanted to “accelerate the full potential of the brand.”

The label has never broken out its full results, but was one of Kering’s smaller brands, dwarfed by others like Saint Laurent and Balenciaga.

London-born Stella McCartney, daughter of the Beatles’ Paul McCartney, first made her mark at Richemont-owned fashion label Chloe. She launched her eponymous label in partnership with the Gucci Group, formerly a division of what is now Kering, in 2001.

The man behind Dior and Louis Vuitton unseated Bill Gates as second richest person - Quartz,"Wed, 17 Jul 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vcXouY29tLzE2NjgyMTcvYmVybmFyZC1hcm5hdWx0LXVuc2VhdGVkLWJpbGwtZ2F0ZXMtYXMtc2Vjb25kLXJpY2hlc3QtcGVyc29u0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"There are three people on the planet with fortunes greater than $100 billion. One is the world’s current richest tycoon, Jeff Bezos, founder and CEO of Amazon. Another is Bill Gates, co-founder of Microsoft, who was the world’s second-richest human—until now.

The newest claimant of the No. 2 slot, according to Bloomberg’s Billionaires Index, is the final man in the $100 billion club: Bernard Arnault, chairman and CEO of LVMH.

Arnault and his family are the majority owners of Christian Dior and LVMH, parent of such brands as Louis Vuitton, Celine, Fendi, Moët, Hennessy, Dom Pérignon, and others. (Dior is now under LVMH too, but it was held separately until 2017.) As LVMH’s share price has soared this year, so has Arnault’s worth. It now stands at about $107.6 billion, more than $200 million ahead of Gates, Bloomberg estimates.

Arnault’s new ranking comes with one caveat: If not for Gates’s tremendous philanthropic giveaways, Gates would be the richest person, even ahead of Bezos. Arnault isn’t likely to complain either way.

The French entrepreneur entered the luxury industry in 1984, when he bought Boussac, a textile empire in the midst of bankruptcy that owned Dior. The famed label by then had deteriorated by licensing its name out to companies producing sub-par products. Arnault set about reviving it, turning it into a vertically integrated company that did its own production, distribution, and marketing. He would go on to buy up other brands, such as Céline, and in 1988 engineered the deal that made him the majority shareholder of LVMH.

By then he had displayed a talent for shrewd maneuvering that would assure his success, as journalist Dana Thomas detailed in her book Deluxe: How Luxury Lost its Luster. According to Thomas, Arnault was brought into LVMH by its vice chairman, Henry Racamier, to help him in his power struggle with chairman Alain Chevalier. Arnault then secretly negotiated a bargain with Chevalier to take a controlling stake. Racamier and Arnault became entangled in a rancorous public battle dubbed the “LVMH Affair.” Arnault emerged the winner, and in 1990 Racamier resigned from the company. Thomas notes in Deluxe, “The French daily Libération called Arnault ‘the Machiavelli of finance.'”

Arnault would go on to help build the model for much of luxury today. He acquired more fashion houses, installed star designers to make headline-grabbing runways collections, and used the shows as marketing spectacles to sell the real moneymakers: bags, accessories, and perfume that attracted high-end shoppers and offered the mass market an entry into the world of luxury. LVMH tightly controlled the production and distribution of its brands, and margins grew.

Forbes currently ranks Dior as the world’s largest fashion brand based on sales, profits, assets, and market value. LVMH on the whole, meanwhile, keeps attracting customers around the world, with China being the latest highly profitable frontier."

The fashion house did not disclose revenue by brand but said Christian Dior had had a “remarkable performance during the first half”, while Spanish fashion house Loewe had an “excellent performance”, driven in particular by the success of its new collections.

Revenue grew by double-digit percentages across some of its other sectors, including perfumes and cosmetics (12%), selective retailing (12%) and watches and jewellery (8%). Wine and spirits revenue rose by 9%.

Overall reported revenue growth for the business was 15% on 2018 to €25bn (£22.3bn).

Meanwhile, the fashion and leather goods division’s profits from recurring operations for the first half of 2019 increased by 17% to $3.2bn (£2.85n). Overall reported profit growth rose by 14% to $5.2bn (£4.6bn).

Bernard Arnault, chairman and chief executive of LVMH, said: ”LVMH has made an excellent start to the year. These results once again illustrate the effectiveness of our strategy and the exceptional desirability of our Maisons, whose products transcend time. Their constant demand for quality and their consistently refreshed creativity are key to LVMH’s success, always guided by a long-term vision, combining exemplarity and responsibility in all the company’s actions. Despite buoyant demand, we will continue to manage costs and remain vigilant into the second half of the year.

“We are therefore entering the second half of the year with confidence and count on the talent of our teams and their shared entrepreneurial passion to further increase, once again in 2019, our leadership in the world of high-quality products.”

Last week Arnault became the world’s second-richest person, overtaking Microsoft founder Bill Gates. Arnault is worth $300bn (£240bn), Forbes magazine reported."
"Sustainability helps Benetton, LVMH reputations as well as the planet - Campden FB","Fri, 19 Jul 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNhbXBkZW5mYi5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS9zdXN0YWluYWJpbGl0eS1oZWxwcy1iZW5ldHRvbi1sdm1oLXJlcHV0YXRpb25zLXdlbGwtcGxhbmV00gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Benetton and LVMH are the latest global family businesses to enhance their brands by touting their sustainability commitments, but family experts note the value-adds of marketing authenticity to millennials and reputational rehabilitation.

From 2020, Benetton Group collections will be increasingly sustainable with the use of mono-fibre, organic cotton, natural fibres, cellulose-based labels, natural dyes and laser and ozone treatments.

LVMH snapped up a minority stake in the eponymous fashion house of Stella McCartney (pictured above), an influential sustainability figurehead. The deal this week followed LVMH’s signing in May of a five-year partnership with UNESCO to support the agency’s Man and Biosphere biodiversity programme, and natural and sustainable resource management.

How families are ramping up their sustainability initiatives was the much-talked about theme of the CampdenFB European Families in Business Awards 2019 earlier this month. Konstantin von Unger (pictured right), a fifth-generation member of Henkel’s Shareholder Committee, accepted the Top Sustainable Family Business of the Year award on behalf of his family and urged business principals to make sustainability their “top priority” as Henkel had done for generations.

Last month Benetton Group published its 2018 Integrated Report on financial results and social and environmental sustainability. Benetton was listed among the leading firms to have joined the Detox Commitment, an agreement to eliminate 11 groups of chemical substances which are harmful to the environment from production processes by next year. The report certified, among other things, that half of Benetton garments were produced in mono-fibre materials, which are easier to recycle, and that one quarter of the cotton used in the United Colors of Benetton and Sisley collections were sustainable.

The Benetton Group campus, near Treviso, is powered exclusively by renewable energy sources. Some 70% of employees were involved in training programmes over 2018. The group carried out compliance tests on almost 1,000 suppliers in Italy and the rest of the world to assess their adherence to the company’s Code of Conduct.

The report underlined a turbulent year for the family business. Co-founder Luciano Benetton (pictured left) returned as chairman in the bid to return the company to profit. French designer Jean-Charles de Castelbajac took control of its artistic direction, and Oliviero Toscani was put in charge of the brand image. However, Luciano’s co-founding brothers Carlo and Gilberto died, aged 74 and 77 respectively. The family faced public and political criticism over the lethal collapse of the Morandi Bridge in Genoa, which was operated by Atlantia, the construction and toll-road subsidiary controlled by the Benettons. No cause for the collapse has been determined so far.

Alfredo De Massis (pictured below right), Professor of Entrepreneurship & Family Business at the Free University of Bozen-Bolzano and Lancaster University Management School, researched corporate social reporting in family businesses. De Massis found that family firms were more likely than non-family firms to proactively and voluntarily provide a wider range of sustainability-related reports.

He told CampdenFB that Benetton Group and its family had always paid strong attention to sustainability issues, so he would consider their sustainability efforts as authentic.

“At the same time, I also believe that the family shareholders are trying to leverage on this sustainability drive to improve their public perception that has been recently threatened by recent events such as the [Morandi] bridge collapse,” De Massis said.

“Strategically, the disclosure of the 2018 Integrated Report on sustainability is also a move to recover from some reputational losses.”

Mike Rosenberg (pictured below), Associate Professor in the Strategic Management Department of IESE Business School, told CampdenFB Benetton’s move met millennial consumer expectations, but questioned if its sustainability drive went far enough.

“Benetton has several high profile sustainability initiatives, such as being a leader collaborator in Greenpeace’s Detox programme which strives to take harmful chemicals out of its clothes and manufacturing facilities,” Rosenberg said.

“My guess is that the family has realised that the young people that are their core clients care about these topics and thus they need to do as much as they can within their basic business model.

“A deeper question is if we really need to buy new colours every season, but so far Benetton, like most companies, is working to do less harm in the current business paradigm and that is certainly a good thing.”

LVMH took the opportunity to say it was the first large company in France to create a “sustainability department”, more than 25 years ago, when it announced its new partnership with McCartney.

LVMH said the tie-up would accelerate the global potential of the Stella McCartney brand and she would advise executive committee members on sustainability.

Family principal Bernard Arnault (pictured above right), chairman and chief executive of LVMH, overtook Bill Gates to become the world’s second richest person in the Bloomberg Billionaires Index this week. Arnault said a “decisive factor” in acquiring the minority stake was that McCartney “was the first to put sustainability and ethical issues on the front stage, very early on, and built her House around these issues. It emphasises LVMH Groups’ commitment to sustainability.”"

The industry's top players are riding high on demand for branded goods across Asia and particularly in mainland China, in spite of a Beijing-Washington trade war that could ultimately weigh on consumer sentiment.

""With Chinese customers, there was a noticeable improvement between the first quarter and the second quarter,"" LVMH's Financial Director Jean-Jacques Guiony told analysts.

That benign backdrop has so far boosted sales at fashion labels in turnaround mode like Britain's Burberry <BRBY.L> as well as sector stalwarts such as Birkin bag maker Hermes <HRMS.PA> in the April to June period.

Kering <PRTP.PA> and its Gucci brand, due to report first-half earnings on Thursday, should benefit too.

But Moncler and LVMH - two of the top luxury performers on the stock market so far this year - also owe their momentum to attempts to attract young shoppers with novel marketing techniques, investments in e-commerce and a shake-up in their products and designs.

Within Paris-based LVMH, the world's biggest luxury conglomerate, Vuitton is betting on temporary pop-up stores to spike consumer interest and has turned to DJ-turned-designer Virgil Abloh to grow its menswear lines.

Its Christian Dior brand, while still estimated to be less than a third of Vuitton's size, was also one of the standouts of the second quarter, with sales growth exceeding the 20% of the broader fashion and leather goods unit, according to Guiony.

Overall, LVMH, whose other labels include champagne maker Moet & Chandon, said second quarter sales across the group rose 15% to 12.5 billion euros ($13.9 billion) euros, up 12% at stable exchange rates and a comparable number of stores.

Story continues

Analysts had expected like-for-like sales growth of around 10%, following 11% in the first quarter.

At the end of June, operating margins were a touch below forecasts, however, at 21.1%, in part due the step-up in spending on advertising and its brands.

RIGHT DIRECTION?

Moncler, known for its wintry down coats, has tried to jazz up its ranges with special edition jackets from a roster of famous designers, and has stepped away from traditional catwalks shows to host edgier events in its stores.

Its sales growth accelerated further in the second quarter, with the firm posting an 18% revenue increase at constant exchange rates, after 14% in the first quarter.

""We have evidence we're moving in the right direction,"" CEO Remo Ruffini told analysts. Chief Operating Officer Robert Eggs said the buoyant sales trend had extended into July.

Other brands trying to revive more sluggish sales are also experimenting with similar models and now making a push in social media marketing, including Italian shoemaker Tod's <TOD.MI> and fashion house Prada <1913.HK>.

Both LVMH and Moncler said sales had bounced back in France in the second quarter, in another potential boost for peers, helped by a decline in street protests that had hurt business at the start of the year and put off tourists.

""This is not only a Chinese show,"" Guiony said.

"Records for luxury: LVMH beyond the 25 billion line in 6 months, Moncler keeps going - LaConceria | Il portale dell'area ... - laconceria.it","Thu, 25 Jul 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxhY29uY2VyaWEuaXQvZW4vbHV4dXJ5L3JlY29yZHMtZm9yLWx1eHVyeS1sdm1oLWJleW9uZC10aGUtMjUtYmlsbGlvbi1saW5lLWluLTYtbW9udGhzLW1vbmNsZXIta2VlcHMtZ29pbmcv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Louis Vuitton and Dior help LVMH go beyond the semester’s 25-billion euro line (for the first time). An amazing result strengthened by operating income beyond 5 billion. To be noted: 5 years ago, during the first semester of the year, the French group had only sold goods for 14 billion. But LVMH isn’t the only luxury brand performing brilliantly. Even though the turnover is “only” of 570,2 million euro, Moncler is also not giving sign of stopping. Remo Ruffini’s brand beats the forecast (562 million) and showcases a trend of strong acceleration for the second semester of 2019.

LVMH’s flight

The French giant had revenues for 25,1 billion euro in the first quarter of 2019: +15%. The growth at constant rates is of 12% in comparison to the previous year of 2018. EBIT grew by 14% to 5,3 billion euro, just below the forecasted result. Operating margin: 21,1%, in line with one year ago. Profits at 3,268 billion euro, up 9%.

Fashion and leather goods

In an official note, LVMH emphasizes “Louis Vuitton’s notable momentum, during which profitability remains at an exceptional level and Christian Dior Couture’s performance, which is impressive”. The Fashion & Leather Goods division grew by 18%. In value: 10,425 billion euro, more than 41% of the total. Beside from LV and Dior, the group also highlights the good prerformances of Fendi, CELINE, Loro Piana (thanks to the “new personalized footwear service”), Loewe and Rimowa.

Moncler’s acceleration

Moncler closes its first 2019 semester with revenue at 570,2 million euro. Financial forecasts had predicted 562 million. The increment is of 13% at constant rates and 16% at current rates. The second quarter’s acceleration is significant: +18% at constant rates and +19% at current rates. Ebitda: 143,6 million euro, +16%. EBIT: 94,6 million. Profits: 71,3 million, up 16% over the same period the previous year. Good performance by Italy (+8%), better ones from United Kingdom, Germany and France. Yet, Asia is the one growing the most: +18%.

The secret is speed

The note published by the group reads: “Today’s consumers of luxury goods are evolving at an increased speed in comparison to the past. Moncler decided to open a new chapter of its history also to face these changes. Moncler Genius One House Different Voices will accompany the group on its future path”. Another strategic pillar is the focus on the consumer: “To have a direct relationship with one’s own clients, whether they are retail, wholesale or digital. Making sure they are involved and that the brand can offer relevant experiences with all its touchpoints, all while understanding their expectations”."
Will Rihanna's Fenty Beauty Take Off in China? - Jing Daily,"Wed, 03 Jul 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vamluZ2RhaWx5LmNvbS9wb3N0cy93aWxsLXJpaGFubmFzLWZlbnR5LWJlYXV0eS10YWtlLW9mZi1pbi1jaGluYdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Amassed largely by the popularity of its superstar creator, Rihanna, Fenty beauty achieved a whopping 100 million in sales just 40 days after launching. An instant overnight sensation, to be sure. But would this success translate to China, the second-largest beauty market in the world? What’s concerning is that Fenty’s two winning weapons — star power and its message of diversity — have appeared to gain little traction in China’s vast mainland beauty market.

Fenty Beauty was launched in 2017 by the singer, who is also the first woman of color to oversee a fashion house under LVMH. Largely betting on the star’s worldwide influence, Fenty is the first new LVMH brand since 1987 built by the group. But the star’s halo effect has yet to translate into a selling point in China, as it has in the West. If anything, it’s been the Chinese actress and beauty blogger Lin Yun that has created the buzz for the brand.

It’s no wonder. Lin Yun has about 10 times the Weibo following of Rihanna in China. And after introducing the brand to her fans, Lin quickly became the celebrity name associated with the brand. This is not a Rihanna-only phenomenon – Kim Kardashian's KKW beauty line, notoriously flatlined when first launched on the Chinese social shopping platform, Little Red Book (Red). Cases like these demonstrated the power of localization in China — even with celebrity-based products — and the importance of having mainland KOLs to help translate the brand’s influence to a local Chinese audience may be still necessary.

The lack of Rihanna’s global celebrity effect, however, hasn’t stopped people from buzzing about the brand online. On Red, there are some 30,000 posts from consumers sharing Fenty product reviews, with many asking if it’s for Asian skin color. Even though diversity and inclusivity are two of the most important messages delivered by Fenty, (it does offer 40 shades of foundation to accommodate a wide range of diverse skin colors), many Chinese consumers have struggled to find right color, as the Chinese market is racially less diverse than the U.S. and European markets, and where white or lighter skin tones are considered the beauty standard. To their credit, savvy Chinese consumers have figured out that Fenty’s Skinstick in Amber was a natural match to Asian light skin tone, and has quickly become one of the most discussed items on Red.

Whether Fenty will succeed in China is far too early to say, but before any foreign makeup brands hit the shelves in China, they have to undergo animal testing, and the manufacture of Fenty Beauty, Kendo, has long made it clear that they will only produce cruelty-free products . This regulatory concern seems to be an unconcealable barrier for Fenty to officially sell in China. So far fans can only purchase through overseas shoppers like Daigou or traveling to the closest destination, such as Sephora at Hong Kong.

But this doesn’t mean the brand has no plans to expand into China. Fenty Beauty launched Weibo account on May 29, and quickly amassed 15,205 followers (about one percent of Rihanna’s personal Weibo page followers). So far, the brand also set up a blank profile on Red."

Arnault has been chairman and CEO of LVMH since 1989. In April, he and the group donated €200m (£172.6m) to help finance the reconstruction of Notre-Dame Cathedral, after it was ravaged by fire.

LVMH reported a 20% jump in reported sales in its fashion and leather goods division to £5.1bn for the three months to 31 March.

Earlier this week the group snapped up a minority stake in British designer Stella McCartney’s eponymous brand. McCartney will maintain ownership, as well as her position as creative director and ambassador of Stella McCartney."

Oliveira Baptista left Lacoste in 2018 and was succeeded by Louise Trotter, but will now join the LVMH-owned brand. The designer will reveal his first collections for both men and women in February 2020 during Paris Men’s Fashion Week FW20. Humberto Leon and Carol Lim left KENZO after eight years to focus on Opening Ceremony.

Sylvie Colin, CEO of KENZO, told WWD, “What made us choose Felipe above other candidates is the fact that he has a global artistic approach… He has a 360-degree creative vision and will oversee artistic direction globally, dealing both with collections and communication.”

She added, “Felipe’s style is very compatible with our DNA… It’s about a certain daily sophistication, silhouettes that are both chic and sporty, which is pretty much the essence of KENZO.”

LVMH fashion group chairman and CEO Sidney Toledano said in a statement, “Felipe’s talent as a designer, his expertise in clothing and his personal attachment to diverse cultures will be valuable assets in rejuvenating the creative energy at the maison.”

KENZO has not said how Oliveira Baptista intends to change the company, however it did state that Felipe Oliveira Baptista’s partner Séverine will be associated with a number of collaborative collections. Séverine Oliveira Baptista has previously worked with Felipe at both Lacoste and his namesake brand.

LVMH launches Fenty Beauty by Rihanna in Asian travel retail - The Moodie Davitt Report,"Fri, 19 Jul 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vbW9vZGllZGF2aXR0cmVwb3J0LmNvbS9sdm1oLWxhdW5jaGVzLWZlbnR5LWJlYXV0eS1ieS1yaWhhbm5hLWluLWFzaWFuLXRyYXZlbC1yZXRhaWwv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"ASIA. LVMH-owned makeup brand Fenty Beauty is expanding its presence in Asia with new travel retail doors to open September. Fenty Beauty has announced locations in T Galleria by DFS in Hong Kong and Macau, as well as Sephora and Harvey Nichols stores. The brand will also be introduced to the South Korean markets through Lotte Duty Free and Shinsegae Duty Free’s stores in downtown Seoul and The Shilla Duty Free in Jeju.

Fenty Beauty was launched by Rihanna in 2017 and achieved a record US$100 million in sales just 40 days after its debut. It is the first new brand built by LVMH since 1987 and international singer and actress Rihanna is the first woman of colour to manage a fashion house in LVMH. Her star power and inclusive brand messaging has made Fenty Beauty a resounding success in Western markets. One of the brand’s key unique selling points is that it sells 40 different shades of foundation.

Despite its success, Fenty Beauty has struggled to break into China, which is now the second-largest beauty market in the world. According to The Moodie Davitt Report’s content partner, Jing Daily, Rihanna’s star power has failed to captivate Chinese audiences, which demonstrates the importance of having mainland KOLs help translate brand messaging to a very localised Chinese audience. In China, it is Chinese actress Lin Yun, who has become an unofficial global ambassador for Fenty Beauty.

The decision to launch into new markets particularly in Hong Kong, Macau and Korea is part of the beauty brand’s larger strategy to break into the beauty category’s most dynamic region. On 29 May, Fenty Beauty launched a Weibo account, which only amassed 1% of Rihanna’s personal following, and a blank profile on Little Red Book."

Saint Laurent’s S/S 2020 Menswear Show Violated Environmental Regulations in Malibu

Anthony Vaccarello’s ‘70s rock-influenced S/S 2020 menswear collection for Saint Laurent took place on a placid beach in Malibu and featured glitter suits, skintight pants and plenty of men in eyeliner. It also, according to a recent report, violated a host of local environmental regulations in place to preserve the integrity of Malibu’s fragile beach ecosystem. Matt Meyerhoff, a spokesman for Malibu City Hall, told Vogue Business, “They built a boardwalk all the way across the beach. They shored it up with plastic sandbags, which are illegal in the city. People were outraged.” Apparently, local government had denied Saint Laurent an event permit to host their show at idyllic hidden beach Paradise Cove, but decided to evade the decision by applying for a filming permit from a city contractor instead. Malibu also has a local “dark sky” ordinance banning bright lights in the evening so residents can see the stars and wildlife aren’t confused by artificial light, which Saint Lauren also ignored in favour erecting towering lights. Such controversy highlights the need for fashion brands to be accountable for the impact they have on local environments. (Vogue Business)

Stella McCartney Enters Partnership With LVMH

After parting ways with Kering in March 2018, Stella McCartney has entered into a partnership with the luxury conglomerate’s biggest rival, LVMH. According to WWD, “the goal of the partnership will be for the house of Stella McCartney to accelerate its worldwide development in terms of business and strategy, ‘while of course remaining faithful to its long-lasting commitment to sustainability and ethical fashion.’” McCartney’s brand has long been at the forefront of sustainability, offering organic cotton as early as 2005 and supporting environmental causes consistently through philanthropy; LVMH was one of the first large companies in France to instigate a sustainability department, over 25 years ago. LVMH CEO Bernard Arnault claimed to be “extremely happy” about the new partnership, and McCartney stated, “I look forward to a brilliant future together.” Congratulations to the happy couple! (WWD)

Bernard Arnault Overtakes Bill Gates as World’s Second-Richest Person

LVMH CEO Bernard Arnault has made almost $200 million dollars every single day this year. This astonishing figure – totalling $39 billion in wealth accumulation for 2019 alone — puts him right behind Amazon’s Jeff Bezos on the list of the world’s richest people, knocking Microsoft Bill Gates from his long-held number-two post. “Officials at LVMH declined to comment on the ranking, which fluctuates daily in tandem with stock market prices,” WWD reported. Just last year, LVMH overtook Total, an oil company, as the top-listed company on France’s stock market. This egregious level of income inequality is so. frankly, sickening, we won’t be surprised if the French Revolution 2.0 targets Arnault as opposed to Marie Antoinette. (WWD)

Mejuri’s worldwide takeover continues apace, as the millennial-friendly Canadian jewellery brand is set to open a new store on Melrose Avenue on August 10th. This is the first store the brand has opened since receiving $23 million in Series B funding, which it receives after garnering waitlists of over 70,000 people for a neutral-coloured jewellery travel case. Mejuri’s brick-and-mortar locations technically serve as showroom instead of stores. The store exist so customers can try on samples of the jewelry and anything they chose to purchase will be shipped out at a later date. “California has always been an important market for Mejuri and there’s nothing more valuable to us than meeting our community where they are,” CEO Noura Sakkijha told WWD. “The Los Angeles customer embraces our mission to make luxury an everyday habit, and we’re excited to bring Mejuri to the West Coast.” (WWD)"
YG Prepares to Repay 50 Million Euros of Investments to Louis Vuitton (LVMH) - K-Sélection,"Mon, 15 Jul 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vYWx0c2VsZWN0aW9uLmNvbS9lbi95Zy1wcmVwYXJlcy10by1yZXBheS01MC1taWxsaW9uLWV1cm9zLW9mLWludmVzdG1lbnRzLXRvLWxvdWlzLXZ1aXR0b24tbHZtaC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"With the butterfly effect of the Burning Sun case, YG will reimburse Louis Vuitton Moe Hennessy 67 billion won!

According to sources, YG is preparing to make the payment using its own cash flow, as it is having difficulty converting its own shares due to the recent fall in stock price. The reason for this difficulty is due to the drop in YG's stock price by more than 40% in 6 months, following the prostitution scandal and ongoing tax investigations involving its former leader, Yang Hyun Suk, as well only 'Burning Sun Gate' involving the former BIG BANG member Seungri.

YG Entertainment received a total of 61,15 billion won from Louis Vuitton in October 2014, with a promise to convert the shares into stock or cash 5 years later. The 135 shares will be converted at a price of 99688 won. If LVMH chooses not to convert the shares and requests a refund, YG will have to repay 44 billion won plus 400% annual interest.

According to an investment banking (IB) expert, “YG Entertainment announced that it is raising funds for LVMH's convertible preferred shares and has reportedly started the process. YG Entertainment is reportedly seeking a repurchase request and not a share conversion after a formal request for Louis Vuitton due to falling stock prices. “

He stated: “Even if Louis Vuitton executives decided not to buy back and instead opted for a conversion with a claim for damages, YG would still be liable to a criminal fine at that time and would therefore ultimately repay the investment . This repayment obligation was therefore only a matter of time. »



According to the IB official, “YG has been struggling to manage investment since the beginning of the year when the “Burning Sun” scandal broke. Due to constant news in the media and falling stock prices, Louis Vuitton sent YG Entertainment a preliminary letter requesting a refund if the situation does not improve. The official refund request is expected to be sent to YG Entertainment by the end of July or August as usual. “



YG Entertainment stated that even if they are required to repay this investment, it will not affect the company's financial situation.

"Fenty Beauty Accused of ""Intentional Discrimination"" in New Lawsuit Over the Accessibility of its e-Commerce Site - The Fashion Law","Fri, 12 Jul 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiggFodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGVmYXNoaW9ubGF3LmNvbS9mZW50eS1iZWF1dHktaGl0LXdpdGgtaW50ZW50aW9uYWwtZGlzY3JpbWluYXRpb24tc3VpdC1vdmVyLXRoZS1hY2Nlc3NpYmlsaXR5LW9mLWl0cy1lLWNvbW1lcmNlLXNpdGUv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Fenty Beauty has been slapped with a new lawsuit, accusing it of engaging in “intentional discrimination” by “making it impossible” for visually impaired customers to “properly and fully utilize its [e-commerce] website.” According to the case that Beatriz Gutierrez filed against Fenty Beauty in state court in a Los Angeles, the industry-disrupting beauty brand – which is a joint venture between music mega-star Rihanna and French luxury goods conglomerate LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton – is the latest in a growing list of brands being taken to court for allegedly running afoul of California state civil rights law.

In her complaint, Ms. Gutierrez asserts that she is legally blind and thus, requires “screen-reading software to access and read website content using her computer.” Under California’s Unruh Civil Rights Act (“UCRA”), which specifically outlaws discrimination based on sex, race, color, religion, ancestry, national origin, age, disability, medical condition, genetic information, marital status, or sexual orientation, places of public accommodation must ensure that disabled individuals have as full and equal enjoyment to its website as those who are not disabled. This includes access to websites.

The plaintiff argues that she and all other visually impaired individuals are being denied equal access to the online information and goods and services offered on the Fenty Beauty website because it is “not fully accessible to screen-reading technology used by blind individuals,” and thus, subjects visually impaired customers of Fenty Beauty to “a second-class experience.”

“Despite readily available methods to render websites fully accessible to all,” Fenty Beauty has failed to “make correct and proper use of alternative text, accessible forms, descriptive links, resizable text, and labels” to ensure that its website provides equal access for blind and visually-impaired consumers. As such, Gutierrez claims that Fenty Beauty’s actions constitute intentional discrimination.

Gutierrez – who has filed near-exact suits over the past six months against LVMH-owned brands Sephora and Brioni, Breitling, Net-a-Porter, Ferrari, Proenza Schouler, Isabel Marant, and Alexander Wang, among others – is seeking relief in the form of preliminary and permanent injunctions, which would bar Fenty Beauty from committing further violations of the UCRA, and an array of monetary damages.

In addition to joining a number of California state suits filed by the same plaintiff, the Fenty Beauty case comes amidst an ever larger trend in litigation: one that is sweeping number of federal lawsuits are being filed against brands for allegedly violating the Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”) for the very same conduct.

Brands including H&M, the Kardashians’ Dash stores, Lacoste, Jo Malone, Coach, Giorgio Armani, Gucci, Versace, Vera Wang, Valentino, Urban Outfitters, Tory Burch, Bally, Glossier, Hugo Boss, Louis Vuitton, New Balance, Nike, and J. Crew, among others, have been targeted with ADA-centric suits – many of which have quietly settled out of court, presumably not without a monetary damages component and a pledge from the brands to recalibrate their websites to make use of specific software to enable access by both visually and hearing impaired individuals.

The frequency with which these lawsuits are being filed should serve as a wakeup call for brands, particularly as there is expected to be an uptick in litigation over ADA violations, especially in New York state, which attorney Adam Michaels says “has proven particularly welcoming to these cases, with nearly 300 ADA website lawsuits filed in New York’s federal courts in the first quarter of 2018,” alone.

As Michaels stated last year, “A business can minimize the risk and achieve the best possible position to defend itself against an ADA web accessibility claim by taking the following steps: Conducting an ADA compliance audit of its website and digital content, and engaging a vendor to help bring its website into compliance with [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0 AA] guidelines.”

Bill Gates loses ‘second richest man’ seat to LVMH’s Bernard Arnault - Punch Newspapers,"Fri, 19 Jul 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vcHVuY2huZy5jb20vYmlsbC1nYXRlcy1sb3Nlcy1zZWNvbmQtcmljaGVzdC1tYW4tc2VhdC10by1sdm1ocy1iZXJuYXJkLWFybmF1bHQv0gFaaHR0cHM6Ly9wdW5jaG5nLmNvbS9iaWxsLWdhdGVzLWxvc2VzLXNlY29uZC1yaWNoZXN0LW1hbi1zZWF0LXRvLWx2bWhzLWJlcm5hcmQtYXJuYXVsdC8_YW1w?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Bill Gates has been unseated as the second richest man in the world, losing the position to Bernard Arnault, the chairman and CEO of LVMH.

News Agency of Nigeria reports that in the latest ranking by Bloomberg’s Billionaires Index, Arnault is in second place with Jeff Bezos still retaining first place.

Arnault and his families are the majority owners of Christian Dior and LVMH, parent of such brands as Louis Vuitton, Celine, Fendi, Moët, Hennessy, Dom Pérignon, and others.

As LVMH’s share price has soared in 2019, so has Arnault’s worth. It now stands at about $107.6 billion, more than $200 million ahead of Gates, Bloomberg estimates.

The report also states that Gates would have been ranked the richest person, even ahead of Bezos if not for his philanthropic giveaways which gave Arnault more room to climb.

The French entrepreneur entered the luxury industry in 1984 when he bought Boussac, a textile empire in the midst of bankruptcy that owned Dior.

The famed label by then had deteriorated by licensing its name out to companies producing sub-par products.

Arnault set about reviving it, turning it into a vertically integrated company that did its own production, distribution, and marketing.

He went on to buy up other brands, such as Céline, and in 1988 engineered the deal that made him the majority shareholder of LVMH.

Forbes currently ranks Dior as the world’s largest fashion brand based on sales, profits, assets, and market value.

Louis Vuitton Owner Bernard Arnault Replaces Microsoft’s Bill Gates as World’s 2nd Richest Person

Louis Vuitton Owner Bernard Arnault Replaces Microsoft’s Bill Gates as World’s 2nd Richest Person

Bernard Arnault became the world's second-richest person with a whopping US$39 billion gain, pushing Bill Gates to the third position in the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.

Bernard Arnault, Bill Gates

New Delhi: In a biggest individual gain, Louis Vuitton Moët Hennessy owner Bernard Arnault replaced Microsoft Corporation co-founder Bill Gates to take the world’s second-richest person spot, stated a report. The net worth of Arnault, the owner of Luxury goods LVMH increased to US$107.6 billion, which is US$200 million greater than that of Microsoft co-founder’s net worth, stated a Bloomberg Billionaires Index on Tuesday.

Notably, in 2018, LVMH earned revenue of €46.8 billion (US$52.5 billion) which was a 10 percent increase when compared to the previous year. Besides, in 2019 alone, Arnault has earned a whopping US$39 billion gain. This is the biggest individual gain so far received by LVMH owner who entered the list of 500 people in Bloomberg’s ranking, pushing Bill Gates to the third position.

As per the Hurun Global Rich List 2019 published in the month of February, Microsoft founder Bill Gates ranked second with a wealth of $96 billion followed by Warren Buffett, the chairman of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. with a net worth of $88 billion. Meanwhile, LVMH’s Bernard Arnault at $86 billion was at the fourth slot.

A notable mention by a report stated that the combined wealth of Jeff Bezos, Bernard Arnault and Bill Gates is now greater than the individual market values of almost every company listed under the S&P500 index. Some of the companies that in the S&P500 index are Walmart Inc, Exxon Mobil Corp and Walt Disney Company.

French Stocks Set For 12-Year High as LVMH Surges to New Record - BNN Bloomberg,"Thu, 25 Jul 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJubmJsb29tYmVyZy5jYS9mcmVuY2gtc3RvY2tzLXNldC1mb3ItMTIteWVhci1oaWdoLWFzLWx2bWgtc3VyZ2VzLXRvLW5ldy1yZWNvcmQtMS4xMjkyMzc00gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"(Bloomberg) -- Stellar earnings put French stocks on track to close at the highest level since 2007, capping a decade of outperformance over the euro zone.

The CAC 40 index rose 0.9% as of 2 p.m. in Paris as a slew of French companies posted results that beat estimates. The gauge, like equities across the region, got an added boost as the European Central Bank signaled further monetary stimulus, with lenders jumping after the authority said it’s considering a tiering system for rates that could help the sector.

Among French stocks to rise on better-than-expected results Thursday were Schneider Electric SE, Orange SA and Danone. But the crown jewel was LVMH, which notched a new record as creative revamps at its Louis Vuitton and Christian Dior brands won over shoppers and helped weather slowing Chinese economic growth. The CAC’s second-largest stock is up 584% in the past 10 years, compared with the benchmark’s 68%.

LVMH, with its turbocharged sales expansion, has been especially alluring to investors desperate for high-quality stocks posting reliable growth regardless of the economic cycle. The luxury conglomerate’s second-quarter results would indicate that reputation is well-deserved.

Bill Gates unseated as world’s ‘second richest man’ - P.M. News,"Fri, 19 Jul 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vcG1uZXdzbmlnZXJpYS5jb20vMjAxOS8wNy8xOS9iaWxsLWdhdGVzLXVuc2VhdGVkLWFzLXdvcmxkcy1zZWNvbmQtcmljaGVzdC1tYW4v0gFcaHR0cHM6Ly9wbW5ld3NuaWdlcmlhLmNvbS8yMDE5LzA3LzE5L2JpbGwtZ2F0ZXMtdW5zZWF0ZWQtYXMtd29ybGRzLXNlY29uZC1yaWNoZXN0LW1hbi8_YW1wPTE?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Bill Gates has been unseated as the second richest man in the world, losing the position to Bernard Arnault, the chairman and CEO of LVMH.

In the latest ranking by Bloomberg’s Billionaires Index, Arnault is in second place with Jeff Bezos still retaining first place.

Arnault and his family are the majority owners of Christian Dior and LVMH, parent of such brands as Louis Vuitton, Celine, Fendi, Moët, Hennessy, Dom Pérignon, and others.

As LVMH’s share price has soared in 2019, so has Arnault’s worth. It now stands at about $107.6 billion, more than $200 million ahead of Gates, Bloomberg estimates.

The report also states that Gates would had been ranked the richest person, even ahead of Bezos if not for his philanthropic giveaways which gave Arnault more room to climb.

The French entrepreneur entered the luxury industry in 1984, when he bought Boussac, a textile empire in the midst of bankruptcy that owned Dior.

The famed label by then had deteriorated by licensing its name out to companies producing sub-par products.

Arnault set about reviving it, turning it into a vertically integrated company that did its own production, distribution, and marketing.

He went on to buy up other brands, such as Céline, and in 1988 engineered the deal that made him the majority shareholder of LVMH.

Forbes currently ranks Dior as the world’s largest fashion brand based on sales, profits, assets, and market value.

Meanwhile, LVMH on the whole keeps attracting customers around the world, with China being the latest highly profitable frontier."
"Interview: Alexandre Arnault, CEO of Rimowa - Gulf Business","Thu, 11 Jul 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQGh0dHBzOi8vZ3VsZmJ1c2luZXNzLmNvbS9pbnRlcnZpZXctYWxleGFuZHJlLWFybmF1bHQtY2VvLXJpbW93YS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"If there’s one thing that defines Alexandre Arnault’s approach to business, it is this: Controlled risk-taking.

Shortly after taking over as CEO of the luxury luggage manufacturer Rimowa at the age of 24 in January 2017, he decided that legacy wasn’t going to be the guiding principle of his management of a brand that was almost 120-years-old at the time, and was only ever managed by the founding family in all those decades.

Never mind that the then chief executive of Rimowa, Dieter Morszeck – the grandson of the founder – was leading the company for more than two decades before Arnault was even born.

“We used to have 16 different suitcase sizes for one line – from a small cabin to large check-in luggage. In those 16 sizes, six-seven were selling, the others weren’t. It was an operational nightmare, so we decided to rationalise the number of suitcase sizes from 16 to seven.

“That was a big risk to take, because we were giving our clients less freedom but more advice into what they needed to buy and so they were left less confused. That was a big risk, but was very controlled,” Arnault explains to Gulf Business.

Need another example of his bold-faced decision-making? Consider that much-hyped Rimowa x Supreme collaboration last year. While Supreme was a cool millennial-focused streetwear brand, Arnault – himself a millennial – risked significant blowback by attempting to very quickly recast a youthful image for a brand that was considered slightly old-school back then.

Arnault stuck to his guns, and in April last year, when the Rimowa x Supreme collection dropped, it was sold out online in 16 seconds. “We took a risk in partnering with Supreme. We knew what we would do with the brand and where we would take it, and that’s another example of controlled risk taking. Risk taking is definitely something that’s key in our family and in our group.”

The family that Arnault grew up in controls one of the world’s most powerful and influential luxury conglomerate, LVMH. His father, Bernard, is the co-chairman of LVMH and has an estimated net worth of over $100bn, making him France’s richest man, and the third person to cross the $100bn mark along with Bill Gates and Jeff Bezos.

After Arnault graduated from Télécom ParisTech, and later acquired a master of research in innovation from École Polytechnique, he wasn’t prepared to accept a management position handed to him on a platter in any of the brands controlled by his father.

Instead, he was keen to blaze his own entrepreneurial trail, but first he decided to start at the grassroots and gain some experience. That took him across the Atlantic to America where he led the investments of his family holding company into tech start-ups in New York and San Francisco.

“I sat on the boards of some of those start-ups,” he recalls.

“It was great seeing how those companies were being built from scratch, how fast they were growing and what their challenges were.”

When it was time to strike out on his own, he did his due diligence on Rimowa – one of the few independent family-owned brands that had potential to be something much bigger than it was in at the time. He convinced his father to let LVMH purchase an 80 per cent stake for $716m in January 2017. He was also appointed as the co-chief executive of the brand.

That same month, he was the only other member of the Arnault family who accompanied his father to a private meeting with the then president-elect Donald Trump in Trump Towers – a Rimowa suitcase in tow, he confirms.

Hitting its stride

Arnault says that the global travel and tourism industry is a $9 trillion industry and growing at 5-7 per cent per year. The luggage market alone is around $40bn.

“We were roughly one per cent of the market when we bought the company. Every percentage point is $400m so we can’t grow 10 per cent in two years but we definitely want to reach two or three per cent very quickly.”

To get there, he’s had to disrupt the status quo. He began by internally restructuring the way the team brainstormed.

“Being younger than people in the company and other CEOs too, I try to eliminate hierarchy and make sure everybody gets a seat at the table.

“I like to involve people from other departments in decisions that don’t directly impact them. So sales can get involved in operational discussions, operations can get involved in marketing discussions.

“I’m not running the show, but it is the team that is growing the company. Obviously, they’re allowed to question me, as they have on many occasions. Sometimes I don’t agree with them and sometimes I listen to them and then go against my initial thoughts.”

Although there’s a treasure trove of product experience in the LVMH group, Arnault says that for the most part, all the brands in the group operate independently so that they don’t kill each other’s creativity. While you’d think that the young scion would turn to the other brands to learn from them, it’s proving to be the other way around. When Louis Vuitton showcased their Marc Newson Horizon suitcases, they turned to Rimowa to use its patented wheel system, for example.

Conversely, there is also LVMH clout that Rimowa can leverage.

“Because we [LVMH] are big, we are able to have a lot of economies of scale on things. Real estate is one example. When we enter a mall or a shopping centre, we are able to go in with 15-20 brands. Another example is the ability to negotiate with agencies when it comes to media buying.”

But even there, Rimowa has been the renegade by becoming the first LVMH brand to pull all print advertisements and focus solely on digital marketing.

E-commerce is a major focus area for Rimowa. It currently accounts for less than 10 per cent of Rimowa’s sales, but Arnault who played a key role in the launch of 24 Sèvres, LVMH’s multi-brand e-commerce platform, says that he wants that number to account for at least 15-20 per cent of its business within the next two-three years.

To that end, Rimowa relaunched its European e-commerce website last year with new features like the ability to book repair appointments online. It also launched its first e-commerce site in the US a few months later.

Arnault says that the team globally consists of around 2,000 employees and has three main manufacturing facilities – one each in Cologne, Czech Republic and Canada.

“Cologne is the first and historic site where we make all the aluminium products. The Czech Republic facility was opened in 1997 and it makes all the polycarbonate parts – we couldn’t make that in Cologne because the factory is too small. The Canadian factory is for the North American market. Our products have a large volume and so it’s not very eco-friendly to send these products by plane and it costs a lot of money. So we decided to build a factory where we can build the suitcases and then send them by truck throughout the North American market.”

As for the retail model, there have been a few changes made to it since Arnault took over. Rimowa now has around 100 stores worldwide.

“We used to have a lot of third parties in Asia who ran the stores for us that we’ve now taken over. If you look at the stores that we manage with our staff, we’ve doubled that number approximately from 50 to 100 since January 2017.”

Arnault acknowledges that the Middle East has the potential to become a key market for Rimowa. They already have a store in Abu Dhabi and another one that was opened in The Dubai Mall earlier this year, with a third store opening at the Mall of the Emirates this month.

“We are now also thinking of other places in the UAE and the entire GCC as well. I’m also very adamant on Kuwait and Saudi Arabia that I think are very big and we need to have a presence because people there travel. I think you’ll see us grow in those countries quite quickly.”

The future of Rimowa

“Sometimes on the weekend, I go to the stores and I literally spend the afternoon selling products, which is interesting because customers don’t know they’re talking to the CEO. I just keep asking them questions to understand better how their journey works,” says Arnault when asked if he still manages to get a sense of the market at the customer level.

He also tracks reactions to the products on social media and spends a significant amount of time reading comments and messages.

And in terms of rebranding the company as a hip, moderm-day lifestyle accessory, Arnalut has been proactive in setting up smart collaborations. Apart from Supreme, Rimowa works with Fendi, Off-White and more recently with American artist Daniel Arsham. Rimowa partnered with Sotheby’s to auction one of his limited-edition cases. It fetched $14,000, which was donated to charity.

Another tool that Arnault is deploying deftly is ad campaigns fronted by mega influencers like Kim Jones and LeBron James. King James alone has nearly 50m followers on Instagram.

And for the next phase of the company’s growth, Arnault wants to go beyond suitcases.

“We’re definitely going to expand our products – not just suitcase but accessories, backpacks. It’ll be fun to see how the brand develops itself on that front.”

Rimowa also wants to ramp up the experiential perks of owning and travelling with a Rimowa.

“We’re trying to partner with airlines and airports. We’re trying to build on experiences where we make it easier for clients who own a Rimowa to travel.”

Whatever happens you can be sure that Arnault’s controlled risk-taking will continue to put Rimowa in the hands of increasingly more customers. And all before his 30th birthday."
