Slower-than-expected LVMH growth in Q3 sees luxury market tremble - Jing Daily,"Thu, 12 Oct 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vamluZ2RhaWx5LmNvbS9wb3N0cy9zbG93ZXItdGhhbi1leHBlY3RlZC1sdm1oLWdyb3d0aC1pbi1xMy0yMDIz0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"What happened

Luxury company share prices plunged today after LVMH Group, the world's largest luxury goods company, yesterday reported slowing sales growth.

LVMH shares dipped to a year-to-date low, while Kering and Richemont also declined.

The Bernard Arnault-owned conglomerate’s sales growth came in at 9 percent in Q3 2023, down from 17 percent the previous quarter.

In the first nine months of the year, the entire group, which includes lifestyle, beauty and jewelry brands such as The Belmond Group, Fenty Beauty, Moet & Chandon and Tiffany & Co., posted revenue of €62.2 billion, up 9.1 percent year on year when currency fluctuations and non-core revenue are accounted for.

A bright spot was the conglomerate’s fashion and leather goods business (a stable of 14 brands), its biggest component, which generated revenue of 32.8 billion (€30.9 billion) in the same period, up 10 percent year on year.

Expansion was attributed to ""remarkable growth in all product categories"" at Christian Dior, which has reportedly tripled in size in the past seven years , as well as the popularity of Loewe’s new leather goods designs, particularly under the aegis of Jonathan Anderson. Rimowa, Marc Jacobs, Berluti, and Fendi also performed well, according to LVMH.

However, in Q3 2023, LVMH’s wines and spirits business saw revenue decline 26 percent year on year.

The Jing Take

With a multitude of high-caliber brands operating under its umbrella, LVMH’s strategy has produced a broad, yet select portfolio of elite labels, each with its own unique identity and consumer market. This diversification cushions the business during challenging economic times.

However, the financial markets took a dim view of LVMH’s results, with its stock price falling up to 8.5 percent in early Paris trading today. Other luxury stocks like Hermès, Richemont and Kering also tumbled with it .

While the whole LVMH Group comprises over 75 brands, the fashion and leather goods arm is the largest division and includes coveted labels like Dior, Loewe, Fendi, Celine, Kenzo, Givenchy, and popular quiet luxury brands Berluti, Loro Piana and Rimowa. Bulgari, Tiffany & Co. top LVMH’s jewelry division. Then of course there is Louis Vuitton, the jewel in the group’s luxury crown.

With the much hyped debut of Pharrell Williams helming LV’s menswear line this year, the brand again hit headlines when it announced a pre-fall mens collection show in Hong Kong for November 30, its first ever show in the city.

Yesterday, the brand launched its first-ever Chinese-language podcast series, ""Louis Vuitton [Extended],"" which invites listeners to listen to creatives from different industries, including writers, actors and directors. The inaugural season will kick off with a fresh perspective on Shanghai, exploring the city's past, present, and future. This is all indicative of LV’s investment in the China market, its largest driver of revenue in Asia.

And while stock investors are getting skittish amid a luxury slowdown, people working in the industry will see new consumption patterns emerge. Perhaps some of the most significant will be in rapidly evolving markets, such as Greater China, Singapore, South Korea and Thailand. Many of the labels in their stable still enjoy high brand equity here compared to the rest of the world. With this in mind, perhaps it's no surprise that the LVMH Group is going long on investing in its relationship with Asian consumers.

Bernard Arnault's LVMH sees slow quarterly sales growth - Fortune,"Wed, 11 Oct 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vZm9ydHVuZS5jb20vZXVyb3BlLzIwMjMvMTAvMTEvYmVybmFyZC1hcm5hdWx0LWx2bWgtbG91aXMtdnVpdHRvbi1zZWNvbmQtcmljaGVzdC1tYW4tbHV4dXJ5LXNwZW5kaW5nL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Big gains in luxury spending helped LVMH boss Bernard Arnault overtake Tesla CEO Elon Musk as the world’s richest man earlier this year. At its peak, Arnault’s wealth was north of $200 billion, thanks to handsome returns on LVMH’s key brands including Christian Dior and Louis Vuitton.

His wealth has since dropped—he holds second-place in the list of billionaires now—and it stands to fall further as consumers bite the bullet by curbing luxury spending amid economic woes.

LVMH’s third quarter earnings, released Tuesday, reveal that shoppers are pulling back from indulging in luxury products—especially in the U.S. and Europe. The group’s sales rose 9% to €19.9 billion ($21.1 billion) during the period—a slower pace compared to 17% in the previous quarter.

“After three roaring years, and outstanding years, growth is converging toward numbers that are more in line with historical average”, LVMH’s CFO Jean-Jacques Guiony told analysts.

Revenue growth was slower in some of the conglomerates’ crucial divisions, including fashion and leather goods. Sales also slid 10% in wines and spirits, which LVMH said was a factor of “post-Covid normalization of demand and the continued high inventory levels of its retailers.” There were a few other factors that pulled earnings figures down, such as a stronger euro against the U.S. dollar.

COVID hangover

The easing pace of sales growth points to a correction in the luxury industry after the COVID-19 pandemic drove people to spend generously on high-end goods with their piled-up lockdown savings. LVMH benefited from it as the company saw its top line jump during the peak of the pandemic.

But signs that the appetite for luxury goods may be waning are becoming apparent—for instance, an index tracking 10 European luxury stocks including LVMH and British fashion house Burberry reported its biggest quarterly decline since 2020 earlier this week. Arnault’s company also lost its position as Europe’s most valuable company in September to Danish pharma giant Novo Nordisk.

LVMH, which is among Europe’s largest companies by market capitalization as well as a leader in the luxury space, is seen as a bellwether of sorts for the industry. LVMH’s results could set the tone for other brands, including Hermès and Kering, on their earnings due later this month.

UBS analysts said LVMH’s results “confirmed the ongoing normalisation in the sector, driven by weakening macro,” but said the company’s stock is the best one to own in the luxury space amid economic pressures.

“We continue to believe that LVMH’s best-in-class brand portfolio, the sound LT (long-term) fundamentals of the industry and its pricing power still position it as one of the best stocks to own in the sector in this uncertain context,” UBS analysts said in a note Wednesday, viewed by Fortune.

And for its part, LVMH is sure of its ability to bounce back and keep growing despite the headwinds.

“In an uncertain economic and geopolitical environment, the Group is confident in the continuation of its growth,” LVMH said in a statement Tuesday.

Ebbs and flows of Arnault’s wealth

The French billionaire has an estimated $169 billion in personal wealth now, per the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. But as the chairman and CEO of LVMH, his wealth is largely tied to the shares of the luxury conglomerate, including a 97.5% stake in Dior.

His wealth has fluctuated with the ups and downs of the luxury industry. Investor angst over the dampening economic prospects and high inflation have reflected on the stock price of luxury stocks like LVMH which, in turn, have hurt Arnault’s wealth. In May, for instance, the tycoon’s wealth plunged $11.2 billion in a day as the company’s share price took a hit.

But whenever the luxury company made strides, Arnault’s net worth was boosted, leading him to surpass Musk a handful of times in the last year. Between 2020 and 2021, the LVMH boss’ fortune more than doubled from $76 billion to $186.3 billion, according to Forbes’s estimate.

Although one of the 74-year-old executive’s five children, who already occupy senior roles in the luxury empire, are poised to take on the mantle from Arnault, he might stay on a little longer. Last year, LVMH extended the retirement age of its chairman and CEO from 75 to 80.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9959308505058289}",positive,0.9959308505058289,1
LVMH Stock: Is the Party Over for Luxury Goods? - The Motley Fool,"Fri, 20 Oct 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIzLzEwLzIwL2x2bWgtc3RvY2staXMtdGhlLXBhcnR5LW92ZXItZm9yLWx1eHVyeS1nb29kcy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LVMH Moët Hennessy's Q3 revenue results caused some investors to sell the stock as concerns over luxury retail linger.

When it comes to market-beating returns, sectors such as technology and software tend to come to mind. However, one of the more under-the-radar industries that has historically been generous to shareholders is luxury goods. One of the most recognizable luxury companies in the world is LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton (LVMHF -1.57%), home to iconic brands such as Fendi, Tiffany & Co., and Tag Heuer.

LVMH just published revenue results through the first nine months of the year. While an initial glance might present the notion that everything is progressing smoothly, a look underneath the hood may tell a different story. Let's dig into the company's financial data and assess if now is a buying opportunity for the stock, or if luxury retail may be in trouble.

A close look at the financials

The table below illustrates LVMH's revenue by product segment for the first nine months of 2023 and compared to the same period last year.

Category ($ in millions of euros) Year to Date 2023 Year to Date 2022 % Change Wines and spirits 4,689 5,226 (10%) Fashion and leather goods 30,912 27,823 11% Perfumes and cosmetics 6,021 5,577 8% Watches and jewelry 7,951 7,575 5% Selective retailing 12,431 10,095 23% Other activities and eliminations 201 189 N/A Total LVMH 62,205 56,485 10%

At first glance, these results look respectable. Wines and Spirits is the only product group that is declining year over year, and fashion and retail are both achieving double-digit growth. Considering the impacts that inflation and high borrowing costs are having on the average consumer, these results are encouraging.

But as I wrote about previously, the products that LVMH sells are not necessarily marketed for most consumer cohorts. For this reason, the company's high-end buyers may be more immune to hefty price tags regardless of macroeconomic conditions.

With this said, looking at these results on a deeper level may shed some light on broader consumer buying patterns. According to the company's investor presentation, revenue growth decelerated in key geographic areas such as the U.S. and Europe. Moreover, concerns over reopening efforts in China due to COVID-19 appear to linger.

Investors can see in the chart above that the results from LVMH caused a brief sell-off. The stock is now trading about 29% off highs from earlier this year. Given the slowdown and waning consumer slowdown, some investors may be wondering if the party is over for luxury goods. In the following section, I'll outline some interesting trends in the luxury market and make a case for why it may simply be experiencing a new beginning.

The advent of luxury resale

On the surface, the results above provide good reason for investors to believe that luxury retail is taking a breather. But with that said, there are some new trends emerging that Wall Street may not be fully considering.

According to a recent study by management consulting firm McKinsey, well over 50% of younger demographics such as Gen Z and Millennials expressed an ""intent to splurge"" in 2023. McKinsey's survey also found that areas such as apparel, beauty and personal care, footwear, and jewelry ranked in the top 10 of all categories among the entire study group, which included Gen X and Baby Boomers as well.

There are a couple of undercurrents when digesting the data above. First, it's interesting to see that so many Gen Zers and Millennials are willing to spend even during times of uncertain macroeconomic conditions. However, it's important to keep in mind that younger age groups likely do not have the same spending power as older generations do, given they have not had as much time to save.

Another thing to consider is why younger demographics may be so attracted to high-end brands. One of the easier conclusions to make is that younger age groups are big users of social media platforms. While posting pictures of yourself wearing nice clothes may give off the appearance of building a luxury lifestyle, I think there is more to the picture.

Another study by McKinsey estimated that the luxury resale market was worth up to $30 billion in 2020 and expected to grow by at least 10% per annum over the next decade. Given these parameters, the luxury resale market is likely worth significantly more today than it was just three years ago. Perhaps unsurprisingly, McKinsey attributed a significant portion of the boom in luxury resale to Gen Z and Millennials. Platforms such as Poshmark, The RealReal, Farfetch, and StockX have essentially democratized access to luxury goods.

Keep long-term investing in mind

Given the size and pace of growth for secondhand luxury goods, some investors may be concerned about the impacts this will have for LVMH. In years past, competition was seen in the form of new fashion trends or shifts in consumer preferences. But now, high-end brands are seeing an entirely new channel by which their products are sold. In turn, simply showing off new items in eye-catching window displays may not be enough to reach consumers quickly.

While the threat of resale markets appears to be very real, it's too early to know for certain just how much it's impacting luxury retailers. It's important to keep in mind that consolidation in the space is very much an ongoing theme, as smaller fashion houses look to compete with the behemoths. Moreover, the total return over the last decade for LVMH stock speaks for itself.

Although the shopping patterns from younger consumers in particular may be contributing to some reshaping of broader trends, LVMH's reputation and brand identity were built from fierce customer loyalty over generations. I think it's short-sighted to believe the company will continue to experience shrinking growth in the long run.

Given the heavy sell-off in the stock, now looks like a terrific opportunity to lower your cost basis and hold for the long term.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9756771922111511}",neutral,0.9756771922111511,0
LVMH Sales Growth Slows as Global Luxury Demand Cools - The Business of Fashion,"Tue, 10 Oct 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzb2ZmYXNoaW9uLmNvbS9uZXdzL2x1eHVyeS9sdm1oLXNhbGVzLWdyb3d0aC1zbG93cy1hcy1nbG9iYWwtbHV4dXJ5LWRlbWFuZC1jb29scy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LVMH’s sales growth softened in the third quarter as shoppers reined in spending on high-end Cognac and costly handbags, more evidence the post-pandemic luxury boom is waning.

Organic revenue at the French group’s crucial fashion and leather goods unit — which includes the Louis Vuitton and Christian Dior labels — rose 9 percent, the company said Tuesday. Analysts expected an 11.2 percent increase. Sales at the wines and spirits unit tumbled 14 percent, much worse than expected.

LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE, a favorite of investors in recent years, has lost some luster as China’s recovery underwhelms and demand from US consumers cools. The luxury group passed the crown of Europe’s most valuable company last month to drugmaker Novo Nordisk A/S.

Shares of the Tiffany & Co. owner dropped by almost a fifth from a record in April, though are still up 7.9 percent this year.

Overall, the group posted 9 percent organic revenue growth, also below estimates. LVMH is considered a bellwether for the luxury sector, and rivals Hermes International and Gucci owner Kering SA report later this month.

LVMH Revenues Up 1% in Third Quarter as Fashion Sales Slow - WWD,"Tue, 10 Oct 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd3dkLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy1uZXdzL2ZpbmFuY2lhbC9sdm1oLXJldmVudWVzLXVwLTEtcGVyY2VudC1pbi10aGlyZC1xdWFydGVyLWFzLWZhc2hpb24tc2FsZXMtc2xvdy0xMjM1ODY3ODY0L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"This story was updated on Oct. 10 at 4:24 p.m.

PARIS — Will the slowdown in luxury spending be a blip, or a protracted slump?

Market leader LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton said it was too early to tell, after its third-quarter revenues confirmed that consumers in Europe and Asia are tightening their purse strings as the euphoria of the post-pandemic period wears off.

The luxury conglomerate, parent of brands including Louis Vuitton, Dior, Tiffany & Co. and Sephora, said revenues rose 1 percent in the third quarter, reflecting a normalization of growth rates in its key fashion and leather goods division as inflation and high interest rates weigh on discretionary spending.

Chief financial officer Jean-Jacques Guiony said it was difficult to make projections for the fourth quarter and beyond based on the quarterly performance.

“Time will tell, depending on the depth and the length of the cycle, whether it was a real cycle in consumption or merely a sort of blip after three extraordinary years,” he said on a webcast with press and analysts.

“Growth is converging toward numbers that are more in line with the historical average. Will we stay there? I don’t really know. There is no reason to believe neither that we will crash, nor that we will come back to the type of 20 percent growth that we enjoyed for a certain period of time,” he added.

Group revenues in the three months to Sept. 30 totaled 19.96 billion euros, below a Bloomberg consensus estimate of 21.15 billion euros. Stripping out the impact of currency fluctuations, third-quarter revenues at LVMH were up 9 percent year-on-year, indicating a slowdown from the second quarter, when organic revenues increased 17 percent.

The fashion and leather goods division posted sales of 9.75 billion euros in the third quarter, up by 9 percent on a like-for-like basis versus the same period last year.

The segment’s progression was down from the 21 percent organic revenue growth recorded in the second quarter, and below a Bloomberg consensus forecast for 11.2 percent growth.

The LVMH results come against an uncertain economic backdrop in Western economies, and a challenging macroeconomic environment in China, with negative factors including falling property prices, high levels of youth unemployment, a drop in export demand and a weakening currency.

Describing the macroeconomic headwinds as the “worst in 50 years,” a recent report by RBC Capital Markets said that aspirational customers were especially affected. This group accounts for 165 million out of a global luxury consumer pool of roughly 400 million people, it estimated.

Although LVMH does not break out sales for individual brands, Guiony said the Dior juggernaut was settling into cruise speed after the brand tripled in size in less than seven years. The moderation comes as revenues at the house, including beauty, exceed 15 billion euros, according to a recent Bernstein report.

“The slowing down in the growth is absolutely normal after these fabulous and outstanding years that we’ve been through,” Guiony remarked. “You can’t grow a business 30 percent per annum for forever, so the business has to consolidate. We cannot open that many stores, otherwise we would end up overdistributing the brand.”

Going forward, Dior will focus on having the optimal amount of stores and category mix.

“This should generate healthy growth going forward. We are not worried at all about the quality of the business at Dior,” he said, indicating there was no change in strategy since Delphine Arnault succeeded Pietro Beccari as chief executive officer in February.

By region, LVMH reported that demand softened in Europe and Asia, while trends were unchanged in the U.S. following a weak second quarter.

Organic revenues in Asia, excluding Japan, were up 11 percent in the third quarter versus a 34 percent jump in the prior three months, reflecting a more challenging comparison basis and a recovery in Chinese tourism outside of Asia.

“We are extremely pleased with the level of the business we do with Chinese clients,” said Guiony, adding that the main difference is that the proportion of Chinese spending on fashion and leather goods taking place offshore has doubled versus last year to around 30 percent.

In Europe, sales rose 7 percent following a 19 percent increase in the second quarter, while in the U.S., they were up 2 percent on the heels of a 1 percent decline. Revenues in Japan were broadly stable, up 30 percent in the third quarter after a rise of 29 percent in the second quarter.

While negative currency effects should impact group margins in the second half, LVMH does not plan to rein back marketing spending after a period marked by bombastic shows and mega-flagship openings, Guiony said.

“You’ll see some initiatives that will be as spectacular as what we’ve done over the last quarters and we expect the second half or the last part of the year to be extremely full with a large number of initiatives,” he pledged.

By division, wines and spirits continued to be the weakest segment, with organic sales down 14 percent in the third quarter, while selective retailing led the pack, posting a 26 percent rise. Watches and jewelry recorded a 3 percent increase, and perfumes and cosmetics were up 9 percent.

Jewelry performed slightly better than watches in the third quarter, and Bulgari was ahead of Tiffany due to its greater exposure in Asia.

Guiony also singled out their smaller stablemate Fred, lauding the performance of CEO Charles Leung, who recently launched a high-jewelry set featuring lab-grown blue diamonds, as well as an 8.88-carat diamond, presented loose.

“Frankly, the amount of PR surrounding the blue diamond has been much bigger than the diamond itself so we are pretty satisfied with this. Is it a long-term trend that we could develop elsewhere? Too early to say,” he commented.

“The artificial diamonds come with some issues that are different from the natural ones. They have to be weighed and assessed carefully and we are not in a position to comment any further,” Guiony added.

Meanwhile, LVMH has big plans for Hainan. Its travel retail business DFS earlier this month revealed plans to open its first “seven-star” luxury retail and entertainment destination on the Chinese island.

Guiony said this was motivated by China’s plan to transform Hainan into a free-trade port with its own customs system by 2025.

“The way the brands could operate in this environment will be entirely different from what it is. Given the number of people visiting Hainan on a yearly basis, it’s worth considering as an important market and therefore all our brands are contemplating opening stores in a selected way in Hainan,” he said.

The DFS Yalong Bay project is to stretch more than 1.38 million square feet and carry 1,000-plus luxury brands. Guiony said it aims to be among the two or three biggest commercial developments in Hainan. “Hopefully we’ll be as successful in Hainan as we have been in Macau,” he added.","{'label': 'Negative', 'score': 0.9567427039146423}",negative,0.9567427039146423,-1

LVMH to Open Dedicated Space for Craftsmanship in Paris - WWD,"Tue, 17 Oct 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3dkLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy1uZXdzL2h1bWFuLXJlc291cmNlcy9sdm1oLXRvLW9wZW4tZGVkaWNhdGVkLWNlbnRlci1mb3ItY3JhZnRzbWFuc2hpcC1pbi1wYXJpcy0xMjM1ODc4MTg0L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS — LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton is launching a new house in Paris.

In a move calculated to give it a competitive edge amid a shortage of skilled workers, the world’s largest luxury group said on Tuesday it would open a dedicated space for craftsmanship in the eighth arrondissement, a stone’s throw from the Dior ateliers and Avenue Montaigne, home to the French capital’s most exclusive boutiques.

During a preview visit to the construction site, Chantal Gaemperle, group executive vice president of human resources and synergies at LVMH, said the Maison des Métiers d’Excellence would allow visitors to touch and feel the breadth of the 280 skilled trades represented across its 75 brands, which range from Louis Vuitton to Dom Pérignon, Tiffany & Co. and Sephora.

“You can do Zoom meetings, you can do videos. But having direct contact with makers and apprentices is inspiring,” she said. “The pandemic has fueled people’s need to find meaning and make something that they can understand and touch. There’s a desire to have a concrete impact and be together.”

Spanning 21,500 square feet, the location on Rue Bayard will be open to the public as well as provide a physical home for LVMH’s Institut des Métiers d’Excellence, the vocational training program aimed at promoting, enhancing and ensuring the transmission of know-how in partnership with leading schools.

Since it was founded in 2014, the scheme has trained more than 2,700 people in seven countries, and this year saw a record intake of 700 apprentices, up from 450 in 2022.

While LVMH declined to reveal how much it is investing in the project, the group said it spent 215 million euros on training in 2022. It plans to hire 22,000 specialized craftspeople worldwide by the end of 2025, including 8,000 in France, according to Alexandre Boquel, head of development for LVMH’s Métiers d’Excellence division.

To meet those targets, LVMH has intensified its outreach efforts to counter a dearth of personnel in fields including retail and leather goods.

It hopes that having a physical showcase will help fuel interest in professions that have been handed down from generation to generation, but are not always well known or understood. “We need to find the people and we need to make these jobs attractive, and we believe that this house will contribute to that,” Gaemperle said.

The group is constantly registering new job categories as it acquires brands and identifies niche skills. It recently added to its list the métier of glyptician, or gem sculptor, but lesser-known professions also include shoemaking and eyewear manufacturing, both sectors that need to attract fresh talents, Boquel said.

“This place is a tower of transmission,” he said. “It will be open to all and the promise is that the moment you walk in here, you will learn a physical gesture, whether you’re a novice, a member of the public or a researcher in craftsmanship.”

The main building, dating from 1880, will act as a learning center, with hands-on workshops where visitors, in groups of 10 to 12 people, will don white blouses and learn from LVMH employees some of the techniques used in fashion and leather goods, perfumes and cosmetics, and watches and jewelry.

The academy will also welcome external craftspeople such as feather-makers or straw marquetry experts. Courses can be booked online and will last between one and three hours, Boquel said.

In addition, the building will house a training academy for apprentices and employees, as well as a research library. An annex will be home to a café, store and exhibition space, all themed around craftsmanship.

Construction work is due to begin next year and the center is expected to open at the end of 2025, LVMH announced during the third edition of Show Me Paris, its annual event spotlighting the group’s efforts to attract future generations to careers in the creative, craftsmanship and client-experience fields.

I know that the majority of visitors won’t become craftspeople, to be honest.” Alexandre Boquel, head of development for LVMH’s Métiers d’Excellence division

As part of the showcase at Salle Pleyel, which drew 1,400 people, it unveiled a scale model of the project by paper artist Hannah Levesque.

“In terms of the look and feel of this space, we will try not to make it too imposing or majestic, but rather welcoming, because we also want to attract the kind of people who don’t feel comfortable walking into luxury stores, and in particular Gen Z, who love luxury brands but can feel very intimidated,” Boquel said.

The center will also highlight the ways that houses are using technology to spur innovation.

“It’s extremely important to talk about that, because when we talk to young people, they’re always afraid that these are jobs from 200 years ago and they won’t be able to relate. Letting them know that these professions also use digital technology reassures them,” he explained.

Gaemperle said the group is open to applicants of all origins and abilities. For instance, Guerlain has hired five youths with autism at its cosmetics factory in Chartres. “Not only have they met their targets, but they have evolved towards other roles,” she reported.

Meanwhile, the Institut des Métiers d’Excellence is launching a new course called Access Retail to train people with disabilities to become sales advisers, Boquel said.

LVMH had announced in 2017 plans for a center dedicated to artists, live performances and the applied arts, to be located inside the former Musée des Arts et Traditions Populaires in the Bois de Boulogne. Originally set to open in late 2018, it was due to include an academy of fine arts and craftsmanship.

Gaemperle said that project was still moving ahead. “There is a large renovation underway, but we didn’t want to wait,” she said. “We also realized that compared to other institutions who have done this outside of Paris, there is an added attraction [to being in a central location].”

Chanel last year inaugurated Le19M, its hub for its specialty workshops, on the border between Paris and its northern suburb of Aubervilliers. Meanwhile, Hermès in 2013 opened a sprawling facility for craftspeople, creative teams, service personnel and communications staff in the suburb of Pantin.

Boquel expects the Maison des Métiers d’Excellence to benefit from being close to La Galerie de Dior, the French fashion house’s permanent exhibition space, and other major attractions. “Being in central Paris is absolutely key,” he said, adding that he expects between 300 and 350 visitors a day on average.

“I know that the majority of visitors won’t become craftspeople, to be honest. It might be 30 percent, or 20 percent or 15 percent, but it doesn’t matter because first of all, we’ll be happy to have those 15 percent if it can solve our recruitment problems. And secondly, it’s extremely important to help people understand what we do,” Boquel said.

“People want to know what is behind our products, and what are our concerns in terms of the environment, society and human resources. Revealing this to the general public will help to better understand the value chain of high-quality products,” he added.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999586343765259}",neutral,0.9999586343765259,0
LVMH Reports Increased Revenues of €19.96 Billion EUR in 2023 Q3 - HYPEBEAST,"Tue, 10 Oct 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vaHlwZWJlYXN0LmNvbS8yMDIzLzEwL2x2bWgtMjAyMy1xMy1maW5hbmNpYWwtcmVwb3J0LXJldmVudWUtaW5jcmVhc2XSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton revealed its third-quarter financial results on Tuesday, reporting a 1% increase in revenues as inflation and heightened interest rates continue to influence consumer purchasing decisions.

Home to more than 75 brands, including Louis Vuitton, Dior and Tiffany & Co., LVMH recorded revenues of €19.96 billion EUR in the three months ending on September 30. While the figure marks a small increase from last quarter’s tally, it did fall below Bloomberg’s consensus estimate of €21.15 billion EUR, per WWD.

LVMH’s 2023 Q3 revenues are up 9% from those reported during the same period in 2022. However, the luxury conglomerate’s 2023 Q2 results increased by 17% year-on-year, meaning the company experienced a slow-down on a quarter-to-quarter basis.

From a divisional perspective, LVMH’s fashion and leather goods category reported €9.75 billion EUR in sales, earning a 9% increase from last year’s numbers. While the results were positive, it’s worth noting that the division reported a much-higher 21% increase in the last quarter. Additionally, this quarter’s results fell below the Bloomberg consensus estimate of 11.2% growth.

Elsewhere, the perfumes and cosmetics category reported a 9% increase; selective retailing skyrocketed by 26%; watches and jewelry saw a 3% increase, and wines and spirits fell by 14%.

"LVMH Miss, Luxury Slowdown Spook Investors and Send Shares Tumbling - WWD","Wed, 11 Oct 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3dkLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy1uZXdzL2ZpbmFuY2lhbC9sdm1oLW1pc3MtbHV4dXJ5LXNsb3dkb3duLXNwb29rLWludmVzdG9ycy1zZW5kLXNoYXJlcy10dW1ibGluZy0xMjM1ODcwNzc4L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LONDON — “Normalization,” a usually harmless term, has struck fear into investors’ hearts and sent European luxury shares tumbling Wednesday.

Shares in LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton fell to their lowest level this year after the group missed consensus estimates by up to 6 percent when it reported third-quarter revenues on Tuesday.

The fall, and the market’s anticipation of an upcoming “normalization” in luxury revenue growth, also weighed on shares at Richemont, Hermès, Kering and Burberry.

At the close of trading on Wednesday, LVMH was down 5.7 percent to 692 euros; Richemont, 4 percent to 109.40 Swiss francs; Kering, 1.3 percent to 428.50 euros, and Hermès, 1 percent to 17.58 euros. Burberry shares were down 3.2 percent to 17.77 pounds.

The LVMH miss was just the latest indication of the direction that the luxury goods business could take in the next months.

Last week, RBC Capital Markets had already sounded a warning about the fate of luxury goods, and said that Richemont, which specializes in fine jewelry, could be the hardest hit of all the major groups.

RBC downgraded Richemont’s share price target to 130 Swiss francs from 170 Swiss francs for the next 12 months based on new, and lower, earnings estimates.

The bank declared that the “the luxury cycle is turning,” and argued that the macro headwinds that luxury is facing, such as higher inflation, interest rates, and a waning consumer appetite, are “the worst in decades.”

As reported, LVMH said revenues rose 1 percent in the third quarter, reflecting a normalization of growth rates in its key fashion and leather goods division as inflation and high interest rates weigh on discretionary spending.

Group revenues in the three months to Sept. 30 totaled 19.96 billion euros, below a Bloomberg consensus estimate of 21.15 billion euros.

Chief financial officer Jean-Jacques Guiony said it was difficult to make projections for the fourth quarter and beyond based on the latest performance figures.

“Time will tell, depending on the depth and the length of the cycle, whether it was a real cycle in consumption or merely a sort of blip after three extraordinary years,” he said on a webcast with press and analysts.

In response, Barclays cut its estimates for the luxury giant, the parent of brands including Louis Vuitton, Dior, Tiffany & Co., and Sephora.

Barclays trimmed its full-year 2023 sales forecast by 1 percent and lowered its price target to 820 euros from 835 euros. The bank said that LVMH’s third-quarter sales update “now appears as negative … for the rest of the sector. Overall more subdued growth is also likely to be felt by peers.”

On Wednesday, Bernstein added to the downbeat chorus, saying it’s likely that luxury stocks will continue “trading sideways” until a positive catalyst such as a China stimulus “or the acceleration of the reverse repatriation trend is confirmed.”

It added that regardless of the current scenario, LVMH remains Bernstein’s top pick “and the current pullback offers an attractive buying opportunity for long-term investors.”

Earlier this week, HSBC said in a report that sales momentum in luxury is likely to slow in the third quarter.

The bank said that growth from European and Japanese clients is “normalizing; mainland China is facing a tougher basis of comparison and unsupportive macro data points, and the U.S. is still not improving” despite easier comparisons with last year.

“We expect a broad-based normalization of growth across all geographies,” said the bank. As a result of the macro pressures, HSBC said it now expects Kering’s luxury division to be down 8 percent in the third quarter. The company is set to report those results on Oct. 24.

The luxury slowdown should not have come as any surprise to investors.

Last April, Mytheresa, the publicly quoted retailer that stocks major luxury brands, issued a sales and profit warning for fiscal 2023.

Mytheresa said that a toxic brew of rising interest rates, stubborn inflation and heightened promotional activity by its peers would dampen growth of the top and bottom line for fiscal 2023, which ended over the summer.

Last month, in its year-end earnings report, Mytheresa said that big-spending consumers helped prop up the top and bottom lines in fiscal 2023 in what remains a brutal market for luxury fashion that won’t start improving until well into 2024.","{'label': 'Negative', 'score': 0.7940511703491211}",negative,0.7940511703491211,-1

The stock opened at $41 per share, below the $46 offer price determined Tuesday. Its IPO will include some 32.2 million ordinary shares.

The company first officially disclosed its IPO plans back in mid-September, when it submitted a preliminary prospectus with the Securities and Exchange Commission. It will use ""BIRK"" as the ticker for its stock.

Birkenstock has called L Catterton its majority owner for over two years. Catterton, LVMH and LVMH CEO Bernard Arnault’s company Groupe Arnault formed the private equity firm in 2016, per its website.

STEVE JOBS' OLD BIRKENSTOCK SANDALS FETCH OVER $218,000 AT AUCTION

Acquiring that majority stake cost $4.8 million, the Wall Street Journal reported.

In its prospectus, Birkenstock had said L Catterton-affiliated entities would ""control a majority of the combined voting power of our outstanding ordinary shares"" post-IPO.

The Journal reported ahead of Birkenstock’s planned IPO that the sandal maker might see an increase in ownership from Arnault, who apparently expressed a desire to potentially do so. FOX Business has reached out to LVMH for comment on the matter.

Arnault has a $191.3 billion personal fortune, with only Tesla CEO Elon Musk having a net worth bigger than him, according to Forbes.

In an SEC filing last week, Birkenstock said Financiere Agache ""has indicated an interest in purchasing up to an aggregate of $325 million of ordinary shares in this offering at the initial public offering price."" The firm, described by L Catterton as Arnault’s family investment company, has a pre-existing indirect stake, according to the filing.

Birkenstock also indicated Alexandre Arnault has received a nomination to serve on the board and is expected to do so post-IPO. He is one of the LVMH CEO’s five children and holds the title of executive vice president of products and communications at Tiffany & Co.

LVMH counts Louis Vuitton, Fendi, Christian Dior, Givenchy, Tag Heuer, Bulgari and Tiffany & Co. among its numerous brands.

The French house lauded the athlete for “his sense of effort, excellence and determination,” while the group highlighted his “creativity, excellence and perseverance,” in statements unveiling the sponsorship and Lefort’s new role.

Born in French Guiana, the 32-year-old foil fencer is a three-time Olympian, four-time team European and two-time individual world champion. In July, he scored a bronze medal at the 2023 World Championship in Milan.

Beyond the fencing strip, Lefort picked up film photography in 2017 and published “Behind the Mask,” a photography book in which he paid homage to the diversity of the French national fencing team. His second monograph, titled “Olympic Backstage,” in which he gave a behind-the-scenes view of life for the athletes during the 2020 Tokyo Olympics that were postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, was recently released.

His athletic career is told in a manga titled “Enzo,” which he coauthored with Paris-born illustrator Tony Lourenço.

Lefort also launched in February a French language podcast titled “Le Rebond,” (or the rebound, in English), where he talks with fellow athletes, including veteran track and field champion Ladji Doucouré and Paralympian cyclist Marie Patouillet, about turning setbacks into fresh motivation.

Lefort joins swimmer Leon Marchand among Vuitton’s ambassadors in the world of sport, which also includes tennis players Carlos Alcaraz and Naomi Osaka; skier Eileen Gu, and soccer player Sam Li Sirong, among others.

He is the third in LVMH’s all-star cohort of sponsored athletes that already includes gymnast Mélanie de Jesus dos Santos, who was tapped by Dior, and Marchand. All will benefit from financial support and privileged introductions to the group’s houses.

In addition to representing Louis Vuitton in the run-up to the Games, Lefort will support the 2023-24 edition of the LVMH Master GaMEs, an annual competition for apprentices at the LVMH Institut des Métiers d’Excellence that will hold events in five countries for the first time.

He will challenge apprentices to reinterpret the codes of fencing through their crafts. The finest examples will be showcased in the LVMH Pavilion during Paris 2024.

The French group signed on to become a premium partner of the Paris 2024 Olympic and Paralympic Games in July, which will have medals designed by jeweler Chaumet. Several other houses will also take part, including Vuitton, Dior, Berluti, Sephora and the Moët Hennessy wines and spirits division.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999948740005493}",neutral,0.9999948740005493,0

Paris, October 10, 2023



LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, the world’s leading high-quality products group, recorded organic revenue growth of 14% in the first nine months of 2023 compared with the same period in 2022. All business groups reported sustained organic revenue growth over the period, with the exception of Wines & Spirits, faced with a high basis of comparison. After taking into account the negative 4% exchange rate impact, revenue for the Group was up 10%. Europe, Japan and the rest of Asia achieved double-digit organic growth. In the third quarter, organic revenue growth came to 9%.

The Wines & Spirits business group saw a revenue decline (-7% organic) in the first nine months of 2023, faced with a high basis of comparison with the same period in 2022. Driven by its value-based strategy, the Champagne business grew over the period, despite more moderate demand in the third quarter. Hennessy cognac was affected in the United States by the economic environment, the post-Covid normalization of demand and the continued high inventory levels of its retailers. Among Provence rosé wines, LVMH acquired the prestigious, world-leading Minuty estate.

Story continues

The Fashion & Leather Goods business group achieved organic revenue growth of 16% in the first nine months of 2023. Louis Vuitton delivered an excellent performance, once again buoyed by the creativity and quality of its products, and by its strong ties to art and culture. Many new designs were unveiled in leather goods and watches, in particular the new Tambour, a fusion of Swiss watchmaking expertise and Louis Vuitton’s Parisian elegance. Following the immense enthusiasm generated in July by the first show of new Men’s Creative Director Pharrell Williams, held on the Pont-Neuf bridge in Paris, Nicolas Ghesquière’s boundless creativity continued to captivate audiences, with the Women’s Spring/Summer 2024 ready-to-wear show held at the Maison’s future location at 103 avenue des Champs-Élysées. Christian Dior continued to deliver remarkable growth in all its product categories. Fashion shows curated by Maria Grazia Chiuri and Kim Jones gave center stage to excellent craftsmanship in freshly elegant collections. The Dioriviera collection was unveiled throughout the summer in a series of spectacular pop-up stores around the world. Victoire de Castellane’s new high jewelry collection, Les Jardins de la Couture, was inspired by two worlds very dear to Christian Dior’s heart: couture and gardens. Celine continued to enhance its desirability, driven by the success of Hedi Slimane’s designs and fashion shows. Loewe’s growth continued to be driven by J.W. Anderson’s bold, creative leadership and by the success of the latest new leather goods designs. Loro Piana saw strong growth and launched the first capsule collection made with recycled cashmere. Fendi expanded its retail network. Rimowa, Marc Jacobs and Berluti all turned in an excellent performance.

The Perfumes & Cosmetics business group achieved organic revenue growth of 12% in the first nine months of 2023, driven by its powerful innovative momentum, and maintained its highly selective distribution strategy. Christian Dior achieved a remarkable performance, extending its lead in its key markets. Fragrances saw major growth, carried by the success of women’s scents Miss Dior and J’adore, which was enriched with Francis Kurkdjian’s latest creation, L’Or de J’adore, and the continued worldwide success of Sauvage. Dior Addict in makeup and Prestige in skincare also contributed to the Maison’s rapid growth. Guerlain continued to grow, driven in particular by its popular Aqua Allegoria scents and premium fragrance collection l’Art et la Matière, as well as the excellent response to its Terracotta Le Teint makeup. Parfums Givenchy was buoyed by its fragrances’ ongoing success. Benefit’s growth was driven by the successful launch of its new Fan Fest mascara and the popularity of Pore Care.

The Watches & Jewelry business group achieved organic revenue growth of 9% in the first nine months of 2023. Following the successful reopening of “The Landmark”, its iconic New York store, Tiffany continued its store network renovation program, in Tokyo in particular, where two new exceptional stores were opened, in the Ginza and Omotesando districts. The new Lock collection continued to be rolled out worldwide and expanded to new jewelry categories, and the second part of the Blue Book: Out of the Blue high jewelry collection was launched. Bulgari, which experienced strong growth, celebrated the 75th anniversary of its iconic cross-category Serpenti collection. To mark the occasion, a new exhibition was held in Dubai after the Shanghai, New York and Seoul shows that took place in the first half of the year. High jewelry, which saw the launch of the Mediterranea collection, turned in an outstanding performance. Chaumet held its A Golden Age: 1965-1985 retrospective exhibition in the historic salons of its 12 Vendôme location, while Fred unveiled Audacious Blue, the Maison’s first lab-grown blue diamonds, with both Maisons posting strong growth. In watchmaking, highlights of the quarter included the opening of TAG Heuer’s flagship store in New York and Hublot’s appointment as the Official Timekeeper for the FIFA Women’s World Cup in Australia.

In Selective Retailing, organic revenue growth was 26% in the first nine months of 2023. Sephora performed exceptionally well and continued to gain market share, with particularly strong momentum in North America, Europe and the Middle East. Its distribution network continued to expand, particularly in the United Kingdom, where a second store is due to open soon, following the huge success of its first store opening at the beginning of the year. DFS benefited from the gradual recovery in international travel and, in particular, from the return of tourists to the flagship destinations of Hong Kong and Macao. Le Bon Marché, which is growing steadily, continued to develop innovative concepts and benefit from a loyal French customer base as well as a return of international travelers.

OUTLOOK

In an uncertain economic and geopolitical environment, the Group is confident in the continuation of its growth and will maintain a strategy focused on continuously enhancing the desirability of its brands, drawing on the authenticity and quality of its products, excellence in distribution and agile organization.

LVMH will draw on its powerful brands and the talent of its teams to further strengthen its global leadership in the luxury goods market in 2023.

Apart from the information mentioned in this press release, during the quarter and to date, no events or changes have occurred that could significantly modify the Group’s financial structure.

"Inflation Keeps Aspirational Shoppers Deflated, LVMH Observes - PYMNTS.com","Wed, 11 Oct 2023 14:04:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnB5bW50cy5jb20vbmV3cy9yZXRhaWwvMjAyMy9pbmZsYXRpb24ta2VlcHMtYXNwaXJhdGlvbmFsLXNob3BwZXJzLWRlZmxhdGVkLWx2bWgtb2JzZXJ2ZXMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The state of the aspirational shopper has remained the same since the last quarter, according to LVMH.

As a refresher of the unchanged shopper, in the previous quarter, the luxury conglomerate said that last year middle-income shoppers with disposable income indulged in luxury handbags and perfumes, bolstering LVMH’s profits. However, the current year presents a different scenario, with inflation, economic uncertainty and reduced savings prompting the majority of U.S. consumers to be more cautious in their expenditures.

“The aspirational customer is suffering a bit,” said Jean-Jacques Guiony, LVMH’s CFO, during the company’s last quarter earnings call, citing lower sales online and in “second-tier cities.”

What that means for LVMH in the current quarter is an 9% increase in third-quarter revenue, reported Tuesday (Oct 10), which represents a slowdown in growth from the strong post-pandemic spending.

“After three roaring years, and outstanding years, growth is converging toward numbers that are more in line with historical average,” Guiony said.

LVMH is encountering reduced demand for luxury goods in both the United States and Europe. Within these areas, rising prices have prompted shoppers, particularly among younger generations, to dial down their spending. Simultaneously, the recovery in China has stumbled.

Guiony said that even though business in Europe slowed down in the quarter, the demand for fashion and leather goods from China remained fairly consistent compared to two years ago. The change is that more of these purchases are now taking place beyond the mainland as travel resumes.

According to Guiony, trends in the United States remained relatively stable.

What Aspirational Shoppers Need

In order for LVMH to captivate and entice aspirational shoppers they’ll need to remind consumers of the quality and craftsmanship that make their products a worthwhile investment and expand its product portfolio with emerging designers.

LVMH should also continue to expand into product categories that align with shifting consumer preferences. An example of this approach is the conglomerate’s investment in lab-grown diamonds. However, a question lingers: Will LVMH extend these strategic ventures across its portfolio, encompassing brands like Tiffany & Co.?

Moreover, luxury brands should never underestimate the significance of the customer experience,. Be it through the provision of personal shopping assistants, the hosting of exclusive events, or the delivery of exceptional service, it is the exclusivity of these encounters that stimulates consumer spending.

PYMNTS reported that despite inflation consumers are splurging on “experiences.” But depending on the consumer, one could argue what an “experience” truly means.

LVMH by the Numbers

In the third quarter of 2023, LVMH’s revenues rose by 9% compared to the same period in 2022. However, when comparing the results to the second quarter of 2023, there was a slowdown in growth as that quarter experienced a 17% year-over-year (YoY) increase.

Breaking it down by divisions, LVMH’s fashion and leather goods category recorded €9.75 billion in sales, a 9% YoY increase.

In other categories, perfumes and cosmetics rose 9%, selective retailing jumped 26%, watches and jewelry rose 3%, while wines and spirits fell by 14%.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.7011228203773499}",neutral,0.7011228203773499,0
LVMH Bernard Arnault probed over links to Nikolai Sarkisov - Fortune,"Mon, 02 Oct 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vZm9ydHVuZS5jb20vZXVyb3BlLzIwMjMvMTAvMDIvYmVybmFyZC1hcm5hdWx0LWx2bWgtaW52ZXN0aWdhdGlvbi1wYXJpcy1ydXNzaWFuLW9saWdhcmNoLW5pa29sYWktc2Fya2lzb3Yv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Bernard Arnault, the world’s second richest man and CEO of LVMH—one of Europe’s most valuable companies—is the subject of an investigation over financial transactions linked to Russian oligarch Nikolai Sarkisov.

An investigation into the matter was first opened in 2022, the prosecutors’ office said. But news about it was made public last week when French outlet Le Monde reported that authorities were probing Sarkisov’s purchase of a ski resort in the French Alps using a loan from Arnault. The report cited Tracfin, an anti-money laundering unit within the French economy ministry, which flagged the transaction as a suspicious financial transaction.

The start of an investigation doesn’t imply guilt for the parties involved, and no one has been charged yet.

Arnault’s lawyer has dismissed allegations of Arnault’s involvement in the fraudulent deal as “absurd and groundless.”

“The transaction that allowed for the expansion of the Hotel Cheval Blanc in Courchevel is perfectly known and was conducted in accordance with the law and with legal support,” Jacqueline Lafont, Arnault’s attorney, said in a statement to Fortune. “Furthermore, who could seriously imagine that Bernard Arnault, who has developed over the past 40 years the leading French and European company, would pursue money laundering to expand a hotel?”

Le Monde cited an unidentified associate of Arnault’s who said the deal was carried out within France’s legal confines.

Sarkisov owns the Russian insurance company RESO-Garantia along with his brother. The Moscow-based company is one of the most prominent insurance players in the country, and offers a wide range of coverage for individuals and legal entities.

RESO-Garantia’s spokesperson told the New York Times that Sarkisov had neither met nor was involved in the transaction under investigation.

“The transaction was managed by a small investment unit which invests professionally in European real estate,” RESO-Garantia spokesperson Igor Ivanov said in a statement, adding that some of those properties were based in Courchevel, where the ski resort purchased by Sarkisov is located.

“All transactions were carried out by French companies, through French notaries by French lawyers on all sides,” he said.

RESO-Garantia has also been under investigation by French authorities for a different case involving former French President Nicolas Sarkozy for “influence peddling” after he was hired on a roughly $3 million contract by the group as an advisor.

The prosecutor’s office could not be reached for further comment on the ongoing investigation. Tracfin didn’t immediately return Fortune’s request for comment.

LVMH’s footprint

French multi-billionaire-owned LVMH, which owns luxury brands including Louis Vuitton and Christian Dior, is among Europe’s largest companies by market capitalization. Arnault’s net worth is $167 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaire Index. The group made a revenue of €42.2 billion ($44.5 billion) in the first half of 2023, up 15% from the same period last year. In July, the company agreed to be a premium sponsor of the 2024 Summer Olympics in France, pumping millions of dollars into the sporting event.

The company has rapidly grown to become one of the key luxury companies in the world—which in some cases has also brought it under scrutiny.

Earlier this year, Arnault lost a case to French tax investigators regarding a raid of LVMH’s headquarters in 2019 relating to its operations in Belgium. The company said it was any tax discrepancy was likely a “procedural issue” under European Law and its activities were known to French authorities.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9990240335464478}",neutral,0.9990240335464478,0
LVMH Ramps Up Métiers d'Excellence Apprenticeship in the U.S. - WWD,"Thu, 05 Oct 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3dkLmNvbS9mYXNoaW9uLW5ld3MvZGVzaWduZXItbHV4dXJ5L2x2bWgtYXBwcmVudGljZXNoaXAtdXMtcmhvZGUtaXNsYW5kLXJpc2QtdGlmZmFueS1iZW5lZml0LTEyMzU4NjIxMjQv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton is expanding its Métiers d’Excellence Institute initiative through programs in North American launched by Tiffany & Co. in collaboration with Rhode Island School of Design and Benefit Cosmetics.

LVMH has also committed to increasing the hiring of apprentices in the U.S. with new maisons joining the program in 2024.

LVMH’s Métiers d’Excellence Institute in Europe was established in 2014 to ensure the transmission of savoir faire to the next generation via apprenticeship programs, mentoring, school visits and tours. In an ongoing effort to diversify the luxury industry, LVMH said its maisons continue to recruit talented apprentices from a range of backgrounds, to fill roles that drive forward the artisanal, design and retail excellence.

LVMH officially launched the M.E. program in North America last year with Tiffany in New York to train the next generation of craftspeople. LVMH completed its acquisition of Tiffany in January 2021.

“The Métiers d’ Excellence program contributes to the transmission of savoir faire to the next generation, which ensures the sustained success of the group and our maisons,” said Gena Smith, chief human resources officer of LVMH North America. “The United States and its pool of talented craftspeople represent an important frontier for the group. Both our U.S. and U.S.-based maisons continue to recruit new apprentices who will learn the métiers synonymous with our maisons and carry forward the talents needed to build upon the group’s longevity in the luxury industry.”

Tiffany recently began a new, two-year program in partnership with Rhode Island School of Design and the Rhode Island Department of Labor and Building Futures Rhode Island. While Tiffany has eight M.E. apprentices training in its New York workshop, another seven apprentices just began training in its Rhode Island workshop in the past weeks. This program markets Tiffany’s significant efforts to hire in key craftsmanship roles, with additional cohorts to launch in both M.E. programs in New York and Rhode Island in 2024.

“Tiffany & Co. is committed to identifying talented craftspeople from various backgrounds to mentor and train them in the skills of high jewelry,” said Mary Bellai, global chief human resources officer at Tiffany. “Growing our diverse group of talent is foundational to our continued success; we are excited to be able to expand our reach into new markets to find and nurture talent while delivering on the goals outlined under our social impact platform, Tiffany Atrium.”

In July 2022, Tiffany launched a social impact platform that hosts its varied diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, as reported. The platform aims to bring more women and marginalized communities into creative professions, with a bent toward jewelry-industry training programs.

“We’re thrilled to embark on this unique partnership with Tiffany & Co. to prepare the next generation of practitioners through apprenticeship training,” said Touba Ghadessi, RISD provost. “Thanks to Tiffany & Co.’s generous investment, RISD Continuing Education in partnership with RISD Jewelry + Metalsmithing devised a customized workforce development program, which leverages rigorous instruction and education centered on foundational skills and industry standards devised by our world-class Jewelry + Metalsmithing program. Both of our institutions have such a rich history in Rhode Island, with many meaningful collaborations over the past century, and we look forward to this newest collective endeavor.”

As part of their commitment to the collaboration with LVMH and Tiffany, the workshops in New York and Rhode Island ensure all participants are recognized as registered apprentices under the Department of Labor. This recognition offers the participants a transferable credential that equips workers with marketable skills sought in high-demand industries like luxury.

“We are proud of our work with LVMH to tailor a Registered Apprenticeship program unique to their industry needs through the Apprenticeship RI joint initiative of Building Futures and DLT RI, [Department of Labor and Training Rhode Island],” said Andrew Cortés, executive director of Building Futures Rhode Island. “We celebrate LVMH’s leadership in developing this outstanding workforce development opportunity for Rhode Islanders.”

Benefit Cosmetics is the newest LVMH brand participating in the M.E. program by hosting a Benefit Beauty Immersive program at their San Francisco headquarters this past summer. The initiative was aimed at welcoming high school students to the prestige beauty industry, and nurtured the talents of eight dedicated apprentices from the Ruth Asawa High School of Arts in San Francisco. Apprentices completed the Benefit Brow Certification and received a Métiers d’Excellence Participation Certificate that will support their pursuit of a beauty and cosmetics focus within higher education or post-graduate studies.

LVMH has also launched M.E. Excellent!, a series of high school mentoring activities in New York City aimed at growing awareness of the Métiers amongst the younger generation. The program is anchored in LVMH’s time-honored savoir-faire of craftsmanship and client experiences and has worked with more than 40 students since May. LVMH aims to expand through new partnerships with New York City public schools in 2024.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.988982617855072}",neutral,0.988982617855072,0
LVMH's fashion division rose 9% in third quarter as growth slows in Europe and Asia - Vogue Business,"Tue, 10 Oct 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZvZ3VlYnVzaW5lc3MuY29tL2NvbXBhbmllcy9sdm1ocy1mYXNoaW9uLWRpdmlzaW9uLXJvc2UtOS1pbi10aGlyZC1xdWFydGVyLWFzLWdyb3d0aC1zbG93cy1pbi1ldXJvcGUtYW5kLWFzaWHSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"To receive the Vogue Business newsletter, sign up here.

On Tuesday, LVMH reported that its fashion and leather goods division grew 9 per cent to €9.75 billion in sales in the third quarter, while group sales were also up 9 per cent (to €19.96 billion).

Growth is slowing for the fashion group compared to the first half of the year, when the division’s sales were up 18 per cent in Q1 and 21 per cent in Q2. Tougher comps — this quarter last year saw a big rebound in China, plus strong sales in Europe and the US — played a role, Bernstein analyst Luca Solca said in a note. Now, North American sales growth has faltered and Asia and Europe growth is slowing as well.

“This seems a sign of continuing moderation, as consumers sober up after the post-pandemic euphoria,” Solca wrote. Most luxury stocks, including LVMH, Kering and Richemont, have decreased in the double digits since July. In after-hours trading on Tuesday, LVMH stock had fallen 1.5 per cent.

The boom times for high luxury, it seems, are coming to an end. “Growth is converging — after three roaring and outstanding years — towards numbers that are more in line with the historical average,” LVMH CFO Jean-Jacques Guiony told analysts. “Will we stay there? I don’t know. There is no reason to believe that we will crash, nor that we will come back to the type of 20 per cent growth that we enjoyed for a period of time.”

By region, Asia (excluding Japan) and Europe sales were up 11 per cent and 7 per cent, respectively, modest gains compared to 34 per cent and 19 per cent increases in Q2. Japan was up 30 per cent year-on-year, while the US returned to positive territory, up 2 per cent.

Pressed to comment on the momentum of individual brands, Guiony said that Louis Vuitton and Dior are close to the fashion and leather goods division’s average growth rate of 9 per cent, while Celine, Loewe, Loro Piana and Marc Jacobs are outperforming the average.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9989369511604309}",positive,0.9989369511604309,1

Revenue from the category decreased 5% year on year to EUR 2.52 billion ($2.68 billion) in the three months ending September 30, LVMH reported Tuesday.

However, for the first nine months of the year, sales of jewelry and watches grew 5% to EUR 7.95 billion ($8.43 billion) with the launch of Tiffany & Co.’s renovated flagship New York store and a strong performance at Bulgari.

The reopening of The Landmark proved “successful,” as did the introduction of two new Tiffany stores in Tokyo. LVMH attributed Bulgari’s solid growth to the 75th anniversary of its iconic Serpenti collection and the resulting dedicated exhibition in Dubai. Meanwhile, Chaumet and Fred, which unveiled its first blue lab-grown collection, both showed “strong growth,” LVMH noted.

Group revenue for the third quarter increased 1% to EUR 19.96 billion ($21.18 billion) and was up 10% to EUR 62.21 billion ($66 billion) for the nine months to September 30.

LVMH's Duty-Free Unit Bets on China Luxury Hub With Mega Mall - The Business of Fashion,"Tue, 03 Oct 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzb2ZmYXNoaW9uLmNvbS9uZXdzL2NoaW5hL2x2bWhzLWR1dHktZnJlZS11bml0LWJldHMtb24tY2hpbmEtbHV4dXJ5LWh1Yi13aXRoLW1lZ2EtbWFsbC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"DFS Group, the travel retail arm of luxury conglomerate LVMH, plans to build a major shopping and entertainment complex on China’s tax-free Hainan island in a bid to capture a growing tourism market that’s shown resilience to slowdowns.

DFS is making “an unprecedented investment” in the 128,000-square meter project, which will open by 2026 and feature over 1,000 luxury brands including those from LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE, the firm said in a statement. The complex, expected to pull in 16 million visitors a year by 2030, will also include accommodation, dining and entertainment, the company said.

The project marks DFS’s first physical branch in mainland China — the company currently has 12 stores in Hong Kong and Macau, according to the company’s website. It’s part of a series of commitments the company is making in the country, DFS China President Nancy Liu said in the statement.

The expansion highlights global brands’ increasing understanding that China’s wealthy consumers are shifting to purchasing luxury goods — and traveling — more often domestically in Covid’s wake. Hainan, which has emerged as a domestic hub for high-end duty-free shopping, has continued to see a sales boom even after Beijing dropped the strict Covid Zero restrictions that made international travel easier again.

Still, a post-pandemic economic slowdown and slumping youth jobs market has rattled the country — and some consumers’ confidence. While LVMH’s expansion shows longer-term optimism for China’s luxury market, it’s fighting an economy that only recently began showing signs of recovery, and triggered a rout on European luxury stocks amid softening demand.

Domestic tourism has defied the slowdown, becoming a rare consumer bright spot, as Chinese residents seek instant gratification amid an uncertain economic outlook. With the addition of the DFS complex, Hainan could become an even stronger competitor to existing shopping hubs like Hong Kong, which has already seen a decline in regional relevance for international luxury brands.

The new complex is “the clearest commitment we can make to the long-term development” of China’s tourism market, DFS chairman and chief executive officer Benjamin Vuchot said, “with Hainan on course to become one of the world’s largest luxury retail markets in the next five years.”

Bernard Arnault, worth $173.1 billion dollars, according to the Forbes Real-Time Billionaire List on Oct. 27, recently created a limited partnership called Financière Agache to control his LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton (LVMH) high-fashion empire.

Until 2016 it was illegal for retail investors to invest in high-growth startups. Thanks to changes in federal law, this Kevin O’Leary-backed startup lets you become a venture capitalist with $100.

With returns as high as 300%, it’s no wonder this asset is the investment choice of many billionaires. Uncover the secret.

In a recent report from Italy's Il Sole 24 Ore newspaper via Fashion United, future control of the company shifted to a holding company called Financière Agache. Under this structure, the company features general partners, management authority and limited partners with economic rights. The chiildren of Arnault's late sister Dominique Watine-Arnault, who died in 2006, are Ludovic Watine, 42, and Stéphanie Watine, 33. They control 19% of Agache and will receive economic benefits but do not hold managerial power over the company.

Arnault divided control of Agache Commandité among his five children. Agache Commandité is the group of general partners who have management power over the company. For the next 30 years, they cannot sell shares, which ensures long-time control for the Arnault family. At 74, Arnault is still the director of the company and has unlimited power until he reaches 95.

LVMH is one of the largest and most influential fashion brand conglomerates in the world. The luxury company recently reported 10% growth in the past nine months on sales of €62.205 billion ($65.81 billion). It also noted organic revenue growth of 14% for the nine months ending fiscal 2023 and 9% in the third quarter of the year.

LVMH includes a number of family-founded luxury brands that have long kept the Arnault family at the top of the fashion world. The brands include Louis Vuitton, Dior, Tiffany & Co., Celine and Loewe. Under Bernard Arnault's leadership, LVMH developed into a global powerhouse in the luxury industry, renowned for its innovation and craftsmanship. He is also a keen investor. Groupe Arnault invested in Netflix Inc. in 1999, Spotify Technology in 2014 and Airbnb Inc. in 2015. Through the venture capital firm Aglaé Ventures, backed by Groupe Arnault, he has led investments into firms including TikTok parent company ByteDance Ltd. Lyft Inc. and Databricks Inc.

In recent years, the luxury fashion industry has seen a significant focus on securing the futures of family-controlled empires, especially as billionaire founders age. The Armanis, Fendis and Ferragamos are examples of families that created and continue to run family-controlled high-fashion brands.

Video Transcript

JOSH LIPTON: Let me ask you this, though. Do you think it's possible that LVMH's results, which disappointed some investors, do you think maybe that could be weighing a bit here on investor demand for consumer-facing brands like Birkenstock?

PAULINE BROWN: For sure. And not because this is a luxury brand in the same way that most of LVMH's brands are. But it is premium priced. And in fact, if you look at the growth in the last few years under new ownership, a good part of that growth was through price inflation. The price per pair is quite a bit higher than it was historically.

And part of that is because they are going for more of a fashion-forward segment. They've been doing collaborations with Rick Owens, with Phoebe Philo, with Valentino, with several other brands. And they've done it to great fanfare. But that does put it in a category of stock that is much more vulnerable in the environment we're in than the original basic footwear that they were playing in.

JULIE HYMAN: Well, and Josh brought up LVMH. Of course, you're a veteran of that company. And we got their results as well, that stock has been under pressure. And I think kind of the theme I got from the LVMH results was normalization. In other words, that it had seen sort of uneven demand, but more recently, a spike in demand for luxury. It seems like now that's sort of coming back to Earth. So what is a normal level of growth for the luxury sector? What should investors expect?

PAULINE BROWN: Well, when I look at the 5 subsectors of LVMH, and one of them is up over 20%, and the other one is down about 15%. I don't think of that as normalizing in either case. I think it was a very mixed bag. I think that there were a few large brands within the LVMH portfolio that served as a heavy anchor. Hennessy Cognac, which is about 50% of their wine and spirits division, was probably the heaviest anchor. I think Tiffany is growing much slower than was expected and obviously at great expense because it was, by far, the biggest acquisition the company ever did.

The fashion portfolio, Vuitton, Dior, several others like Celine, that actually did OK. It's not doing nearly what it was just a year ago this time. It's not even doing, in growth, what it was one or two quarters ago. So I would say with fashion and accessories, there is a so-called normalizing. I think the others, there are some much more fundamental challenges that are taking it out of a normal zone of contraction.","{'label': 'Negative', 'score': 0.8870556950569153}",negative,0.8870556950569153,-1
LVMH's Andrew Wu Talks 'Next China' at WWD-SKP Chengdu Summit - WWD,"Mon, 30 Oct 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3dkLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy1uZXdzL2J1c2luZXNzLWZlYXR1cmVzL2x2bWgtY2hpbmEtY29uc3VtZXItZGVtb2dyYXBoaWMtdHJlbmRzLXd3ZC1za3AtMTIzNTg4NTM3Ny_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Goodbye smog alerts, and hello reforestation and the world’s hungriest market for electric cars.

And forget about blunt, hard-sell livestreaming, and expect poetry, literature and other “cultural elegance.”

Those were among the signposts of the “next China” described by Andrew Wu, LVMH group president of Greater China, at the WWD Global Fashion & Beauty Summit, hosted in partnership with Chinese retailer SKP.

In an entertaining address themed around blockbuster Hollywood films, Wu explained why China remains “Forever Young,” “Fast & Furious” and, at times, “Rocky,” stacking his presentation with statistics about everything from pet ownership to Chengdu’s burgeoning panda population.

“There are different generations of China, mainland Chinese in particular, and each generation is different,” he said, suggesting that the speed of change in the vast country occurs every half generation — or even faster. “We have the Cultural Revolution generation that has been very dominantly influencing the China development in the last 30 years, but we need to be really embracing the younger generation segments.”

Roughly 60 percent of mainland China’s 1.4 billion citizens are under age 40, with 15 percent older than 65 and the balance between those two age cohorts.

Some 201 million people were born in China between 1990 and 1999, 163 million between 2000 and 2009, and 173 million between 2010 and 2019, Wu said.

Echoing other speakers at the one-day summit, the executive touted Chengdu as home to one of the youngest, most fashionable and best-looking urban populations. “And I think they can rival any other international cities,” he added.

He flashed a slide showing about a half a dozen famous Chinese athletes from a variety of sports, each looking as if they were modeling in an activewear campaign for a famous brand.

China’s top rapper (MaSiWei), skateboarder (Xiang Li) and street dancer (Kai Yang) all hail from Chengdu, and “it’s influencing the whole country, not just the city,” according to Wu.

He noted that the coronavirus pandemic did not impede affluent young Chinese from pursuing studies abroad, with 180,000 students returning in the second quarter of 2020, at the start of the health crisis.

This year, an estimated 1.2 million mainland Chinese will study abroad, up from 835,000 in 2022 and 662,000 in 2021.

Wu said these numbers reflect the “continued determination of Chinese people for internationalization. This is a very important message that might get lost when the world is so divided, and we’re so burdened by geopolitical tensions.”

Pet ownership exploded during the health crisis, as in other countries, with cat ownership vaulting 48.1 percent to 44.1 million felines, while dog ownership increased 7 percent to 55 million.

Wu’s explanation for their preference? No need to walk cats.

The executive said new generations of Chinese are wholeheartedly embracing more ecological ways of living, and are projected to purchase 348 million “new energy” cars in 2023, up 35 percent versus last year. China’s share of global electric car sales reached 61 percent in the first nine months of this year.

Reforestation is thriving, and the population of pandas has more than doubled since 1980 to more than 2,350, enough to take the cute creatures — a symbol of China ubiquitous in Chengdu — off the endangered species list.

He described 2013 as the year Chinese awoke to the hazards of severe smog. Fast forward to the first half of this year, and the mainland’s main cities boasted that “good air quality days” occurred 82.3 percent of the time.

Cue a new wave of outdoor shopping venues, headlined in Chengdu by the mixed-use Sino-Ocean Taikoo Li Chengdu development and the new park-like, subterranean SKP mall, which is largely open-air and filled with fresh flowers and green spaces — not forgetting “some of the most fashionable young people in China,” according to Wu.

While shopping remains a popular pastime in China, Wu described a blossoming of cultural attractions, including modernized theater shows, sold-out concerts for Taiwanese pop stars, guided city tours and Chinese musicals, which boast a particularly strong female fan base.

This increased sophistication is reflected in livestreamed shopping events, which have rapidly evolved from transaction-based, bargain-hunting bonanzas to more nuanced selling sessions that prize emotional connections.

“This shows us that the landscape is getting more and more differentiated, reminding us that…we may not need to go after every one of the 1.4 billion people,” Wu said.

All that said, the executive stressed that China’s ascent as an economic power has hardly been smooth. While GDP per capita has improved from 10th place among developed nations in 1993 to second place by 2013, China’s GDP is still at 70 percent of America’s and per capita income stands at only $5,600 this year.

But Chinese citizens are world champions in preparing for rainy days, with the household savings rate standing at 43.5 percent, versus 20.7 percent in Germany and 4.9 percent in the U.S. That means some 14.42 trillion yuan are awaiting spending.

“The savings accumulated this year to date, by end of September, is equivalent to 110 percent of the entire China GDP of last year,” Wu marveled.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.999994158744812}",neutral,0.999994158744812,0

U.S. sales growth was also muted.



U.S. sales were up 2 percent in the third quarter and up 3 percent in the first nine months on an organic basis.



The U.S. is LVMH’s second largest market in terms of revenue, just behind Asia.



The U.S. accounted for 24 percent of revenue, down from 26 percent in the previous first nine months.



For the first nine months, LVMH reported double-digit organic growth in Europe, Japan, and the rest of Asia.



LVMH remains silent on its financial future.



As in previous quarters, the company did not provide fiscal guidance for the year ahead, noting only, “In an uncertain economic and geopolitical environment, the group is confident in the continuation of its growth and will maintain a strategy focused on continuously enhancing the desirability of its brands, drawing on the authenticity and quality of its products, excellence in distribution and agile organization.”



As for its future plans, the company said it will rely on the power of its brands and the talent of its employees to strengthen its leadership position in the luxury goods market.

French luxury conglomerate LVMH reported a bigger slowdown than expected - Finimize,"Wed, 18 Oct 2023 15:16:44 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vZmluaW1pemUuY29tL2NvbnRlbnQvbHZtaHMtcmVzdWx0cy13ZXJlLW1vcmUtZGVtdXJlLXRoYW4taGF1dGUtY291dHVyZdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"What’s going on here?

French luxury conglomerate LVMH reported results that were far less glamorous than expected.

What does this mean?

LVMH was hanging celebratory banners around the office back in April, when the owner of brands like Louis Vuitton and Christian Dior became the first European company to boast a market value of over $500 billion. Thing is, the conglomerate was projected to cash in when China – a motor for the luxury industry’s record sales since 2020 – abandoned its strict pandemic restrictions. No luck: the country’s economic stumbles have tripped up consumer confidence. LVMH’s organic revenue – excluding the effects of currency swings and acquisitions – in Asia (not including Japan) ticked up just 11% last quarter, well short of analyst expectations and the 34% recorded the quarter before. And because that’s LVMH’s prime market for sales, the firm’s overall organic revenue only managed to inch up by 9% – roughly half the pace notched over the first half of the year.

Why should I care?

The bigger picture: Fatigue’s contagious.

After three years of properly luxurious sales figures in the high-end industry, LVMH warned that growth is now headed toward historical averages instead. And because the firm’s by far the world’s biggest luxury group, it’s considered a bellwether for the sector as a whole. So that warning may well ring out again when rivals Hermès and Gucci-owner Kering report later this month.

For markets: London’s luxury life.

LVMH’s stock fell 6% on Wednesday. And because together, LVMH, L’Oréal, Hermès, and Kering make up almost a fifth of the French CAC 40 stock market index, any more bad news for the squad could really weigh on the French stock market. In comparison, 14% of the UK’s FTSE 100 consists of energy companies, a sector that’s been riding high thanks to towering oil prices since the summer. So unless trends change, London could well overtake Paris as Europe’s biggest stock market, less than a year after relinquishing that title.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9865017533302307}",neutral,0.9865017533302307,0
LVMH quarterly sales lag despite positive boost from prestige fragrance - Cosmetics Business,"Wed, 11 Oct 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vY29zbWV0aWNzYnVzaW5lc3MuY29tL2x2bWgtcXVhcnRlcmx5LXNhbGVzLWxhZy1kZXNwaXRlLXBvc2l0aXZlLWJvb3N0LWZyb23SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LVMH revenues increased by 9% to €19.96bn in Q3 2023, following a boost in prestige fragrance sales.

The earnings are down when compared with the luxury goods conglomerate’s stellar half-year performance, which saw revenues rise 15% to €42.2bn.

This was the result of a 4% negative exchange rate impact, despite the Fenty Beauty owner reporting double-digit organic growth in Europe, Japan and Asia.

LVMH’s Perfumes & Cosmetics division helped bolster its performance during the quarter, with organic revenue growth up 12%.

Christian Dior in particular saw significant growth, with Miss Dior, J’adore and Francis Kurkdjian’s latest creation, L’Or de J’adore, benefiting from strong sales.

Dior Addict and Prestige also contributed to the business’ earnings during the quarter across both its make-up and skin care categories respectively.

Benefit Cosmetics, meanwhile, experienced an uplift from its newly launched Fan Fest mascara and consistent sales from its Pore Care range.

Despite fragrance’s strong performance during Q3, CFO Jean-Jacques Guiony did note an overall slowdown in the growth of its Dior brand specifically.

“The brand has tripled in size in less than seven years, so [even though] I wish it would be the case, it cannot go on like that forever,” said Guiony.

“You cannot grow a business 30% per annum forever, the business has to consolidate as we cannot open in that many stores - otherwise we will end up over distributing the brand.

LVMH acquired Benefit Cosmetics in 1999

Looking forward to 2024, Guiony also referred to the potential impact on earnings due to LVMH’s price increases this year.

He continued: “There will be a limited impact from pricing, despite the fact that we have passed on price increases in most markets.”

The US market was left largely untouched, for example, but the business did implement price hikes in both China and Europe and more significantly in Japan.

“There will be some elements of pricing seen next year, but in a limited way, and we do not expect that to be the basis for growth in 2024,” Guiony added.

The brand owner is ultimately confident of its growth going into Q4 and the new year, and said it will maintain its strategy of continuously increasing awareness of its brands.

“LVMH will draw on its powerful brands and the talent of its teams to further strengthen its global leadership in the luxury goods market in 2023,” LVMH said in a statement.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9999998807907104}",positive,0.9999998807907104,1
Bernard Arnault Secures Control of LVMH for the Next 30 Years - HYPEBEAST,"Tue, 24 Oct 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vaHlwZWJlYXN0LmNvbS8yMDIzLzEwL2Jlcm5hcmQtYXJuYXVsdC1sdm1oLWNvbnRyb2wtbmV4dC0zMC15ZWFycy1zZWN1cmVk0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"French billionaire Bernard Arnault has officially secured the line of succession for his LVMH empire for the next three decades. The transition to his children leading the LVMH Group was expected to occur upon the passing of the most senior Arnault. The plans have now been kicked into gear by his youngest son Jean Arnault turning 25.

In a recent report from Italy’s 11 Sole 24 Ore newspaper via Fashion United, the transition has now shifted to control to a limited partnership called Financière Agache. In this limited partnership structure, the company features general partners, management authority and limited partners with economic rights. Children of Bernard’s late sister, Ludovic and Stéphanie Watine would hold the economic prerogative, however, the ultimate control lies with the Agache Commandité, the general partner.

Arnault has divided Agache Commandité amongst all five of his children. For the next 30 years, the children are prohibited from selling any shares, which has in turn ensured long-time family control from the Arnault family. At 74, Bernard is still the director of the company and has unlimited power until he reaches 95. The luxury company recently reported a 10% growth in the past nine months. It houses an abundance of family-founded luxury brands that have long kept family at the top to lead its business. Outsiders often find it difficult to penetrate leadership positions since the company often values the emotional familial history.

In other fashion news, Champion and Hélas come together for basketball-focused FW23 capsule collection.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999945163726807}",neutral,0.9999945163726807,0
LVMH CEO Bernard Arnault passed by Amazon's Jeff Bezos - Fortune,"Tue, 17 Oct 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vZm9ydHVuZS5jb20vMjAyMy8xMC8xNy9iZXJuYXJkLWFybmF1bHQtbHZtaC1qZWZmLWJlem9zLWFtYXpvbi13b3JsZHMtcmljaGVzdC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Cooling customer demand has seen luxury tycoon Bernard Arnault—once the world’s richest man—now lose his place as the second-wealthiest person on earth.

The LVMH CEO will be familiar with his successor to the number two spot—it’s Jeff Bezos, the billionaire founder of online giant Amazon.

According to the Bloomberg Billionaire’s Index, Arnault—who oversees brands including Tiffany & Co, Christian Dior, Fendi, Givenchy, and more—has seen his fortune shrink by nearly $7 billion this year.

The 74-year-old entrepreneur, previously the richest person in the world, has seen his wealth increase—even in the past couple of days—where the Bloomberg index chartered a surge of $1.6 billion between Oct. 15 and Oct. 16.

However, the increase isn’t enough to defend the title from former Amazon CEO Bezos.

With the index stating Arnault is now worth approximately $155 billion, he has been overtaken by Bezos by around a billion dollars.

In 2023 alone Bezos has seen his wealth increase by more than $43 billion, and was boosted to the number two spot on Bloomberg’s list courtesy of a $2.6 billion lift on Oct. 15.

Bezos is buoyed by increases to his biggest asset: Amazon stock.

Bezos owns around 12% of the company worth $1.37 trillion dollars, meaning any increase to the share price—up from $129 on Friday to just under $134 by Monday—has a massive effect on his personal wealth.

Arnault’s issues

Slipping from second to third place on a billionaire’s index is a far cry from the issues of reality—indeed, Arnault’s personal net worth is still more than the entire economy of Morocco.

However, Arnault may have a headache on his hands courtesy of luxury shoppers who are beginning to crack under the pressure of global fiscal tightening and economic headwinds.

LVMH’s third quarter earnings, released Oct. 10, confirmed shoppers are pulling back from indulging in luxury products—especially in the U.S. and Arnault’s native Europe.

The group’s sales rose 9% to €19.9 billion ($21.1 billion) during that period—a far more sluggish pace than the 17% reported in the previous quarter.

“After three roaring years, and outstanding years, growth is converging toward numbers that are more in line with historical average,” LVMH’s CFO, Jean-Jacques Guiony, told analysts.

Guiony’s warning echoes that of Citigroup CEO Jane Fraser, who cautioned that consumers—on the lower end of the spectrum at least—were beginning to show cracks.

And while Fraser was optimistic about the health of consumers, she did caution the toughest times may be to come.

“What gives everyone pause” is history, Fraser told CNBC, outlining that in the past the second half of an economic shift—such as the Fed deliberately pushing down inflation with higher rates—is the “tougher half.”

“We’re starting to see the economy do some of the work for the Fed now,” Fraser added. “So it’s definitely softening and if we start seeing another few sets of datas in the coming weeks then I think that will make the Fed’s job easier.”

Amazon and the Magnificent Seven

Unlike LVMH, Amazon has not been suffering from the economic shift. The online retailer’s most recent quarter was its strongest since the fourth quarter of 2020, when pandemic-fueled shoppers turned online during lockdowns.

On the call in August, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy reported figures well ahead of analysts’ expectations: Revenue sat at $134.4 billion while EPS climbed to 65 cents instead of the 35 cents predicted.

“We’re encouraged by the progress we’re making on several key priorities, namely lowering our cost to serve in our stores business, continuing to innovate on and improve our various customer experiences, and building new customer experiences that can meaningfully change what’s possible for customers in our business long term,” Jassy told analysts on the call, hinting his tough cost-cutting measures are beginning to bear fruit.

Analysts are divided on Wall Street over whether the market—led by the so-called Magnificent Seven stocks including Apple, Microsoft, Google owner Alphabet, Amazon, Nvidia, Tesla, and Meta—has edged too close to the sun.

But while analysts from JPMorgan warn the market could be in for a tumble, Morgan Stanley’s Andrew Slimmon believes the Magnificent Seven could push higher yet.

“One of the things I would point out is that—I know it’s hard to believe—as much as these companies have had a very good year to date, they’re still below where they ended in 2021—Nvidia’s the exception,” Slimmon told CNBC’s Street Signs in August.

“It’s very easy to be bearish on companies that have done well, but with companies that have improving fundamentals, calling a top on those stocks, to me, is as naive or dangerous as trying to call a bottom to a stock with deteriorating fundamentals.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9981600642204285}",neutral,0.9981600642204285,0

The Wines & Spirits business group saw a revenue decline (-7% organic) in the first nine months of 2023, faced with a high basis of comparison with the same period in 2022. Driven by its value-based strategy, the Champagne business grew over the period, despite more moderate demand in the third quarter. Hennessy cognac was affected in the United States by the economic environment, the post-Covid normalization of demand and the continued high inventory levels of its retailers. Among Provence rosé wines, LVMH acquired the prestigious, world-leading Minuty estate.

The Fashion & Leather Goods business group achieved organic revenue growth of 16% in the first nine months of 2023. Louis Vuitton delivered an excellent performance, once again buoyed by the creativity and quality of its products, and by its strong ties to art and culture. Many new designs were unveiled in leather goods and watches, in particular the new Tambour, a fusion of Swiss watchmaking expertise and Louis Vuitton’s Parisian elegance. Following the immense enthusiasm generated in July by the first show of new Men’s Creative Director Pharrell Williams, held on the Pont-Neuf bridge in Paris, Nicolas Ghesquière’s boundless creativity continued to captivate audiences, with the Women’s Spring/Summer 2024 ready-to-wear show held at the Maison’s future location at 103 avenue des Champs-Élysées. Christian Dior continued to deliver remarkable growth in all its product categories. Fashion shows curated by Maria Grazia Chiuri and Kim Jones gave center stage to excellent craftsmanship in freshly elegant collections. The Dioriviera collection was unveiled throughout the summer in a series of spectacular pop-up stores around the world. Victoire de Castellane’s new high jewelry collection, Les Jardins de la Couture, was inspired by two worlds very dear to Christian Dior’s heart: couture and gardens. Celine continued to enhance its desirability, driven by the success of Hedi Slimane’s designs and fashion shows. Loewe’s growth continued to be driven by J.W. Anderson’s bold, creative leadership and by the success of the latest new leather goods designs. Loro Piana saw strong growth and launched the first capsule collection made with recycled cashmere. Fendi expanded its retail network. Rimowa, Marc Jacobs and Berluti all turned in an excellent performance.

The Perfumes & Cosmetics business group achieved organic revenue growth of 12% in the first nine months of 2023, driven by its powerful innovative momentum, and maintained its highly selective distribution strategy. Christian Dior achieved a remarkable performance, extending its lead in its key markets. Fragrances saw major growth, carried by the success of women’s scents Miss Dior and J’adore, which was enriched with Francis Kurkdjian’s latest creation, L’Or de J’adore, and the continued worldwide success of Sauvage. Dior Addict in makeup and Prestige in skincare also contributed to the Maison’s rapid growth. Guerlain continued to grow, driven in particular by its popular Aqua Allegoria scents and premium fragrance collection l’Art et la Matière, as well as the excellent response to its Terracotta Le Teint makeup. Parfums Givenchy was buoyed by its fragrances’ ongoing success. Benefit’s growth was driven by the successful launch of its new Fan Fest mascara and the popularity of Pore Care.

The Watches & Jewelry business group achieved organic revenue growth of 9% in the first nine months of 2023. Following the successful reopening of “The Landmark”, its iconic New York store, Tiffany continued its store network renovation program, in Tokyo in particular, where two new exceptional stores were opened, in the Ginza and Omotesando districts. The new Lock collection continued to be rolled out worldwide and expanded to new jewelry categories, and the second part of the Blue Book: Out of the Blue high jewelry collection was launched. Bulgari, which experienced strong growth, celebrated the 75th anniversary of its iconic cross-category Serpenti collection. To mark the occasion, a new exhibition was held in Dubai after the Shanghai, New York and Seoul shows that took place in the first half of the year. High jewelry, which saw the launch of the Mediterranea collection, turned in an outstanding performance. Chaumet held its A Golden Age: 1965-1985 retrospective exhibition in the historic salons of its 12 Vendôme location, while Fred unveiled Audacious Blue, the Maison’s first lab-grown blue diamonds, with both Maisons posting strong growth. In watchmaking, highlights of the quarter included the opening of TAG Heuer’s flagship store in New York and Hublot’s appointment as the Official Timekeeper for the FIFA Women’s World Cup in Australia.

In Selective Retailing, organic revenue growth was 26% in the first nine months of 2023. Sephora performed exceptionally well and continued to gain market share, with particularly strong momentum in North America, Europe and the Middle East. Its distribution network continued to expand, particularly in the United Kingdom, where a second store is due to open soon, following the huge success of its first store opening at the beginning of the year. DFS benefited from the gradual recovery in international travel and, in particular, from the return of tourists to the flagship destinations of Hong Kong and Macao. Le Bon Marché, which is growing steadily, continued to develop innovative concepts and benefit from a loyal French customer base as well as a return of international travelers.

CAC 40: Global Luxury Downturn Hits LVMH Sales Growth in Q3 - TipRanks.com - TipRanks,"Wed, 11 Oct 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRpcHJhbmtzLmNvbS9uZXdzL2dsb2JhbC1tYXJrZXRzL2NhYy00MC1nbG9iYWwtbHV4dXJ5LWRvd250dXJuLWhpdHMtbHZtaC1zYWxlcy1ncm93dGgtaW4tcTPSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"CAC 40-listed luxury company LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, or LVMH (FR:MC) reported lower sales growth in its third quarter as the global luxury market faces a downturn. The company witnessed a slowdown in its demand as the post-pandemic luxury surge lost steam, and rising inflation affected consumer spending.

Despite the uncertainties, the group remains optimistic about its ongoing expansion, relying on the vibrancy of its brands to bolster its position in the global luxury market.

The LVMH share price yesterday gained 3.21% after the company reported its trading update for the first nine months of 2023. Over the last six months, the stock has lost 12% in trading, losing its spot as the most valuable company in Europe.

LVMH is a prominent European conglomerate well-known for its ownership of around 75 luxury brands, including Dior, Louis Vuitton, Sephora, Fendi, Bulgari, and others. The company’s extensive product portfolio spans diverse categories such as bags, watches, cosmetics, spirits, perfumes, and beyond.

Trading Update

The company reported a 14% increase in its organic revenue for the first nine months, falling behind analysts’ expectations. In the third quarter, organic revenue growth was 9%.

Among its segments, sales in the Wines and Spirits segment witnessed a sharp decline of 14% in Q3, mainly hit by reduced Cognac sales in the U.S. and the normalization of the previous high demand. Sales for the company’s largest division, Fashion and Leather Goods, grew by 9%. In the third quarter, as compared to analysts’ forecast of 11.2%. However, this growth rate was slower compared to the robust 21% increase observed in the second quarter.

The company’s segment, Selective Retailing, which includes travel retail and Sephora, demonstrated the highest growth, surging by 26% during the quarter. Its brand, Sephora, exhibited outstanding performance, consistently capturing additional market share in North America, Europe, and the Middle East.

In terms of its regional performance, there is a widespread normalization of growth across all geographical regions.

What is the Future Price of LVMH Stock?

MC stock has received a Strong Buy rating on TipRanks, backed by a total of 14 recommendations from analysts. It includes 11 Buy and three Hold ratings. The LVMH share price target is €890.86, which is 29.13% higher than the current trading level.

'Games are the social networks of the future': LVMH and Gucci have taken note - Jing Daily,"Thu, 19 Oct 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiPWh0dHBzOi8vamluZ2RhaWx5LmNvbS9wb3N0cy9nZWVpcS1yZXBvcnQtbHZtaC1ndWNjaS11Z2MtZ2FtZXPSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Today’s Gen Z consumers are shifting from traditional games to user-generated content (UGC) games like Roblox and Fortnite. UGC games allow users to create their own content and experiences, which appeals to Gen Z's desire for creativity and self-expression.

The interactive component of UGC gaming has led more brands to embrace these platforms. Video game advertising spending in the US nearly doubled from 3.1 billion in 2019 to 5.8 billion in 2022, according to Statista . Brands like Gucci, Balenciaga, and Louis Vuitton are leading the pack in terms of luxury activations on virtual platforms.

“There’s a clear correlation between Gen Z’s favorite fashion brands and the number of activations they’ve done,” says a new report by metaverse intelligence platform Geeiq titled ""The State of Virtual Brand Experiences."" Moreover, 75 percent of Roblox users said they plan to spend money on digital fashion, according to the 2022 Metaverse Fashion Trends Report .

""We live in an attention economy where brands are increasingly looking at virtual environments as a means to capture this attention, and build new communities around their values, and open up new revenue streams. These environments are a natural evolution of print, TV, radio, and later social media, elevating traditional brand engagement to a new, deeper, and immersive form of interaction,” says Geeiq CEO and co-founder Charles Hambro.

In June this year, LVMH announced a partnership with Fornite’s parent company, Epic Games, to develop immersive customer experiences and integrate new 3D technology tools into its design process. The parent company of Louis Vuitton and Dior shared that the partners would use various tools from Epic's arsenal, including Unreal Engine real-time 3D creation technology and Reality Capture for 3D modeling.

Additionally, LVMH will employ Epic Games' Twinmotion and MetaHuman technology to establish virtual fitting rooms and fashion shows and create 360-degree product displays, augmented reality (AR) experiences, and digital replicas of physical items.

“The partnership with Epic Games will accelerate our expertise in 3D tools and ecosystems, from the creation of new collections to ad campaigns and to our maisons’ websites. We will also engage more effectively with young generations who are very much at ease with these codes and uses,” said LVMH group managing director Antonio Belloni.

In 2021, Gucci's Roblox-based Gucci Garden attracted 19 million visitors in its initial fortnight, according to McKinsey , while Balenciaga's Fortnite collaboration introduced its virtual collection to gamers. These platforms, with their large user bases, provide an avenue for luxury brands to connect with Gen Z consumers. In May 2022, Gucci enhanced its presence on Roblox by creating a “Gucci Town” world on the platform.

The number of new virtual brand experiences, as well as persistent experiences like Roblox’ “Gucci Town,"" will continue to grow, reaching new heights in 2023, according to Geeiq’s report.

“Games are the social networks of the future. Our strategy is to help players make new friends, build their social networks, and create community. In-game social experiences were rolled out in FIFA 23. Among players that interacted with the new feature set, engagement increased over 150 percent,” writes Andrew Wilson, CEO of video game publisher EA, which has launched best-selling games like the Sims, in Geeiq’s report.

The top platforms are Roblox, Minecraft, and Fornite, with Roblox boasting over 200 million monthly active users (MAUs). Minecraft, another popular world-building game, has almost 180 million active users while Fornite boasts 70 million.

Moreover, Apple is expected to launch its own “mixed reality” (MR) headset in the first quarter of 2024. The headset will provide a more immersive and interactive experience than current VR headsets.

The fashion and apparel industry stands to benefit from Apple’s latest release as the MR headset will be integrated within the wider Apple ecosystem.

Luxury brands can prepare for the launch of Apple's upcoming headset by developing metaverse activations that are specifically designed for the platform. For example, brands could develop virtual worlds or experiences that can only be accessed using Apple's headset.

“The Vision Pro unlocks a new dimension of interactivity that is not possible in existing AR solutions,"" Matt Robison, founder of marketing agency Robotproof, told media outlet Digiday. “And if brands and marketers are looking to stand out, they should consider how to use this interactivity to engage users.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.6250813603401184}",neutral,0.6250813603401184,0

SEANA SMITH: Shares of LVMH fell to its lowest level of the year today after the luxury brand saw revenue slow more than expected in the third quarter. The business grappling with an underwhelming China reopening and also a pullback in US sales.

And digging into some of these numbers, why we're looking at the stock off just about 5% while sales growing just about 9% in the third quarter. That's down from 17% growth in the previous quarter. So certainly a massive moderation here in terms of sales. And also I think more broadly the takeaway here is what this could signal about the luxury consumer, market consumer industry over the next couple of months.

We talk about the fact that the US economy might be weakening. Consumers pulling back on spending. The US was one of the spots that did see some weakness there. LVMH did see some weakness, as well as Europe in terms of the softer than expected sales. So what this could signal about some of the other competitors within this space when you're thinking about Kering, which is the owner of Gucci and some of those other higher end products. The fact that we might start to see a bit of a deterioration in the luxury consumer, it's a bit concerning here when you talk about the broader economy.

BRAD SMITH: All brands I aspire to have in my closet, don't yet, but hey, maybe there's hope.

SEANA SMITH: One day.

Story continues

BRAD SMITH: One day. Bain and Company actually had an interesting look at the luxury landscape. And they published it at the midpoint of this year and looked ahead to the back half of this year. And there's this correlation between some of the luxury spending and travel.

Luxury shopping in the US is slowing down they noted due to economic uncertainties, while Europe was actually on the rise thanks to tourism. So tourism driving some of the luxury spending. And this was a big year where some of the reinitiation of that cross border travel as we've heard about it from not only the US airlines here, Delta, American Airlines, some of those that go international, United, or have partnerships therein, and how all of those luxury companies that we just showed on the screen there were also pointing to that luxury traveler or that tourist traveler having more of a propensity to spend perhaps while they are there.

But look across the categories here. And this could be interesting to track here because there are little luxuries even within luxury. Top performing categories, they've continued to include watches and jewelry. Customers looking for less but better purchases here. So that less but better could point to some of the little luxuries versus some of the larger purchases that people have made in the past, especially on luxury vehicles too.

SEANA SMITH: Yeah. And that's a good point when we talk about the buying patterns there and exactly what people are spending on and what people are not spending on. So we are seeing a bit of a negative reaction, or not a bit. We are seeing a negative reaction in the stock price today.

But there are still some analysts out there on the street who are saying this might be an overreaction when we talk about the pressure that some of these stocks have been under in recent weeks. Bernstein, one of those names, one of the analysts out there in the street saying that the sector correction has been overly done, also adding that they are spending on marketing, they're easing up on the price increases, and that is among the reasons that make them best placed in an uncertain economic environment. So we'll see whether or not buying picks up here in the very, very critical holiday quarter for the company.

BRAD SMITH: I was just looking at Canada Goose. We had that on the screen a moment ago here. Canada Goose is down like 20% year to date here. And the problem there within that luxury play is that you buy one Canada Goose jacket, how many more do you need, or how many more do you want to buy? I mean I'm still looking for a dry cleaner to be able to clean the one that I bought several years ago at this point. So if a good one, let me know.

But at the end of the day, I think that's what's really the closet replenishment rate could be one of the hindrances in terms of the way forward, at least in the back half this year, especially if you do see more of those dollars continue to go into the experience economy out there.

SEANA SMITH: Well, now would be when you're buying a new winter coat, at least here. So you could see the sales tick up just a bit in the holiday period.

BRAD SMITH: Yeah, that's true. All right, all your markets--

SEANA SMITH: It's fancy that you have one.

BRAD SMITH: You know, I thought it was too.

SEANA SMITH: Yeah.

BRAD SMITH: And now--

SEANA SMITH: Apparently, he spilled something all over it and might have ruined it, so.

BRAD SMITH: It doesn't look great right now.

SEANA SMITH: Money well spent.

BRAD SMITH: Yeah, it's murky at best.","{'label': 'Negative', 'score': 0.9999047517776489}",negative,0.9999047517776489,-1
LVMH CEO Bernard Arnault Calls Money Laundering Reports 'Absurd' - PYMNTS.com,"Mon, 02 Oct 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnB5bW50cy5jb20vbmV3cy9yZXRhaWwvMjAyMy9sdm1oLWNlby1iZXJuYXJkLWFybmF1bHQtY2FsbHMtbW9uZXktbGF1bmRlcmluZy1yZXBvcnRzLWFic3VyZC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The CEO of luxury conglomerate LVMH reportedly dismissed money laundering allegations against him.

The Paris prosecutor’s office said it is undertaking a preliminary investigation into financial transactions between Bernard Arnault and Russian oligarch Nikolai Sarkisov, CNBC reported Monday (Oct. 2). The transactions — involving the Hotel Cheval Blanc — had the appearance of money laundering.

Spokespeople for Arnault — the world’s second-richest person – and Sarkisov, a senior executive at Russian insurance company RESO-Garantia, have denied any wrongdoing, per the report.

Arnault’s attorney, Jacqueline Laffont, said the allegations were “absurd and unfounded,” according to the report.

“The transaction that allowed for the expansion of the Hotel Cheval Blanc in Courchevel is perfectly known and was conducted in accordance with the law and with legal support,” she said. The investigation, seemingly underway, will demonstrate these facts. Furthermore, who could seriously imagine that Bernard Arnault, who has developed over the past 40 years the leading French and European company, would pursue money laundering to expand a hotel? I believe the senseless nature of these allegations will be recognized by all.”

A report last week by France’s Le Monde newspaper claimed Sarkisov bought several properties in Courchevel in 2018 via intermediary companies, with Arnault as the ultimate buyer for those properties, Bloomberg reported Saturday (Sept. 30).

The investigation alleged Arnault paid Sarkisov approximately $21.2 million for the properties with Sarkisov making a 10% profit, Bloomberg reported, citing Le Monde. Authorities hope to determine if the transactions were designed to conceal the funds and the identity of the ultimate buyer.

At the start of the year, LVMH briefly traded at over 800 euros (about $840) per share, boosting the company’s market capitalization to 400 billion euros (about $420 billion) for the first time and making the company Europe’s most valuable business.

Arnault had been the world’s richest person for a time, supplanting Tesla/X/Starlink head Elon Musk. (The two have since swapped places for the No. 1 and No. 2 spots).

Luxury goods proved resilient last year, even as other retailers struggled. However, LVMH Chief Financial Officer Jean-Jacques Guiony in July reported a drop in sales, which he attributed to a reduction in spending by aspirational consumers on entry-level products.

A $245 Billion Selloff Signals Less Sparkly Future for Luxury Stocks - The Business of Fashion,"Wed, 11 Oct 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzb2ZmYXNoaW9uLmNvbS9uZXdzL2x1eHVyeS9hLTI0NS1iaWxsaW9uLXNlbGxvZmYtc2lnbmFscy1sZXNzLXNwYXJrbHktZnV0dXJlLWZvci1sdXh1cnktc3RvY2tzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The wealthy shoppers who fuelled LVMH’s rise to Europe’s most valuable company and made its founder the world’s richest man are showing signs of fatigue.

Disappointing sales figures from the owner of Louis Vuitton and Christian Dior sent a shudder through a luxury industry that had grown accustomed to stellar growth at the world’s biggest purveyor of high-end consumer goods.

LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE suffered its biggest intraday share decline in almost two years on Wednesday, falling as much as 8.5 percent and briefly wiping out its once-hefty gains for the year. Smaller rivals such as Richemont, Gucci owner Kering SA and Hermes International were dragged down with it.

Signs of a softening performance for luxury goods aren’t new. The industry had already lost luster as China’s recovery sputtered and demand from US consumers cooled. Yet LVMH’s good-but-not-great sales figures accelerated a selloff that has wiped some $245 billion from the market value of Europe’s seven largest luxury companies since April.

“I used to say that I liked LVMH because they typically do better than expected, but it’s the first time in a while that they disappointed,” said senior portfolio manager Bruno Vacossin at Palatine Asset Management. “Overall, this shows that the sector is not immune to a slowdown.”

LVMH ceded its position as Europe’s most valuable company to Danish drugmaker Novo Nordisk A/S last month, and its founder and chief executive officer, Bernard Arnault, earlier this year fell to second place on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index behind Elon Musk.

Organic revenue at LVMH’s biggest unit, fashion and leather goods, rose 9 percent in the third quarter. While hardly a collapse in demand, the growth was below analysts’ estimates and half the pace of the first six months.

The results poured cold water on any hopes for a strong demand recovery, notably in China, and showed that weakness had spread. Revenue growth in Asia excluding Japan slowed to 11 percent from 34 percent in the previous quarter. Europe’s growth more than halved.

Sales at the wines and spirits unit tumbled 14 percent, well below expectations, briefly sending shares of Cognac-maker Remy Cointreau spiraling down. LVMH owns Champagne labels such as Dom Perignon and Hennessy Cognac, which has seen US demand slide amid a pushback against price hikes there.

“After three roaring years and outstanding years, growth is converging toward numbers that are more in line with the historical average,” LVMH Chief Financial Officer Jean-Jacques Guiony said during the quarterly presentation.

Guiony also warned investors not to expect that its second-biggest fashion brand, Christian Dior, will continue to see the 30 percent annual growth rates of the past few years.

LVMH now trades at a discount to the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 Index in the US, after trading at a premium to technology companies for most of the last decade — calling into question the premise that high-flying luxury stocks were Europe’s answer to the US’s technology dominance.

Hermes and Kering will follow LVMH with sales figures later this month. Hermes has historically been resilient to economic turbulence because demand for its Birkin and Kelly bags outstrips supply, creating a backlog of orders. The stock is still up more than 20 percent this year.

Kering has been struggling through a transition following recent management changes, and with a new creative director at Gucci — its biggest brand — whose creations won’t hit store shelves until February. That stock is down about 10 percent this year.

The considerable ownership by private companies in LVMH Moët Hennessy - Louis Vuitton Société Européenne indicates that they collectively have a greater say in management and business strategy

A total of 2 investors have a majority stake in the company with 50% ownership



If you want to know who really controls LVMH Moët Hennessy - Louis Vuitton, Société Européenne ( ), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. We can see that private companies own the lion's share in the company with 49% ownership. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).

Meanwhile, individual investors make up 30% of the company’s shareholders.

Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about LVMH Moët Hennessy - Louis Vuitton Société Européenne.

What Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About LVMH Moët Hennessy - Louis Vuitton Société Européenne?

Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.

As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in LVMH Moët Hennessy - Louis Vuitton Société Européenne. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see LVMH Moët Hennessy - Louis Vuitton Société Européenne's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.

We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in LVMH Moët Hennessy - Louis Vuitton Société Européenne. Financière Agache Société Anonyme is currently the company's largest shareholder with 47% of shares outstanding. Capital Research and Management Company is the second largest shareholder owning 2.9% of common stock, and BlackRock, Inc. holds about 2.4% of the company stock.

A more detailed study of the shareholder registry showed us that 2 of the top shareholders have a considerable amount of ownership in the company, via their 50% stake.

There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.

The 21,500 square foot building will serve a physical space for LVMH’s training program Institut des Métiers d’Excellence, which was founded nearly ten years ago in 2014. The institute is open to the public and teaches 280 different trades and vocations. The house has already trained over 2,700 people across seven countries, enrolling 700 students this year alone. With this new development, the luxury house will include niche fields, including gem sculpting and eyewear manufacturing, hiring 22,000 specialized artisans.

“This place is a tower of transmission,” Alexandre Boquel, Head of Development for LVMH’s Métiers d’Excellence shares. “It will be open to all and the promise is that the moment you walk in here, you will learn a physical gesture, whether you’re a novice, a member of the public or a researcher in craftsmanship.”

Much like Bottega Veneta’s recent venture into education, the new center will focus primarily on learning with career success in mind. “It’s extremely important to talk about that because when we talk to young people, they’re always afraid that these are jobs from 200 years ago and they won’t be able to relate,” Boquel adds. “Letting them know that these professions also use digital technology reassures them.”

Construction is scheduled to begin next year with a possible opening at the end of 2025.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999306201934814}",neutral,0.9999306201934814,0

Serving as the physical sanctuary for the eminent Institut des Métiers d’Excellence, LVMH’s acclaimed vocational training initiative since 2014, this hub celebrates the graduation of over 2,700 individuals from seven countries. And 2022 alone witnessed an impressive 700 new faces!

LVMH’s Executive VP of HR/Synergies, Chantal Gaemperle, expressed the irreplaceable value of human touch, “In an age of virtual meetings, the magic lies in real encounters. Post-pandemic, there’s a tangible hunger to connect, create, and collaborate.”

With an ambitious vision in sight, Alexandre Boquel, the torchbearer for LVMH’s Métiers d’Excellence, shared grand plans to onboard 22,000 crafts maestros globally by 2025’s end. He emphasized, “This establishment is more than just bricks and mortar. It’s an educational beacon, promising every visitor an enriching experience, whether you’re a curious soul, a passionate researcher, or just someone who appreciates the fine art of craftsmanship.”

Adding a sprinkle of digital to the mix, the center will debunk the myth that traditional crafts are outdated. Boquel enlightens, “Today’s crafts integrate cutting-edge digital tech, appealing to the younger generation.”

With construction gears set to roll in 2023, the world awaits the grand curtain-rise of this craftsmanship citadel by 2025’s twilight.

Gucci's Kering reports sales drop after LVMH slowdown - Fortune,"Wed, 25 Oct 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vZm9ydHVuZS5jb20vZXVyb3BlLzIwMjMvMTAvMjUva2VyaW5nLWVhcm5pbmdzLWd1Y2NpLXNhbGVzLWRlY2xpbmUtbHZtaC1sdXh1cnktc3BlbmRpbmcv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Shoppers aren’t splurging on Gucci bags or Balenciaga shoes like they used to, and the “roaring 20s” of the post-COVID boom might be over.

Signs of slowdown in the luxury industry began with easing sales reported at LVMH, the parent company of Louis Vuitton and Christian Dior. French company Kering, which has been struggling to match up to rivals in recent years, was next in line.

Kering’s revenues declined by 9% to €4.5 billion ($4.7 billion) in the third quarter, the company reported Tuesday. The fall was tied to a plunge in sales at two of the French fashion company’s biggest labels—Gucci and Yves Saint Laurent—by 7% and 12%, respectively on a comparable basis.

“Beyond the challenging macroeconomic conditions and softening demand across the luxury industry, the change in our revenue performance in the third quarter reflects the impact of our decisions to further elevate our brands and their distribution,” CEO François-Henri Pinault said in a statement.

Kering’s weak earnings come at a delicate time for the company as it has faced strong competition from other luxury brands and charts its path through management changes at Gucci, which makes up more than half of Kering’s annual sales.

The conglomerate is still reeling from the impact of a controversial ad campaign for Balenciaga, which hurt its U.S. and Europe sales. Kering is also working on streamlining its wholesale distribution networks to control pricing, a transition set to be completed in 2024, which has further dragged revenues down this year.

For its part, Kering is making deals to bolster its position as a luxury juggernaut, including one worth $3.8 billion for perfume label Creed in July. Top executives, many of whom have been appointed in the last few months, have been tasked with turning Kering around to its old glory.

“The organization we put in place in July will enable us to strengthen the steering of our Houses in the current market environment and to reclaim our positions and influence. With the acquisition of Creed completed last week, one of the world’s most distinguished high fragrance houses has joined our family, propelling our ambitions in beauty onto the next stage,” Pinault said.

Reshaping Gucci—Kering’s most lucrative brand

Italian brand Gucci, known by its iconic logo with two “G” letters facing each other, has proved a crown jewel for Kering over the years. But it has steadily lost market share to its rivals and hasn’t been able to reap the benefits of COVID-19-induced luxury spending—the new “roaring 20s”—quite like its counterparts at LVMH.

In an effort to revive the label and shake up its leadership, a new creative director, Sabato De Sarno, was appointed in January. He launched his debut collection in September, which is set to go on sale next year. De Sarno’s addition to Gucci’s legacy could be a key determinant in how Kering’s future shapes up.

“We remain cautious on Kering’s turnaround story as it remains to be seen whether key brand Gucci will be able to successfully relaunch brand momentum through its new aesthetic,” analysts at Barclays wrote in a note this month, the Financial Times reported.

Not all doom and gloom for luxury

Although Kering’s challenges stretch beyond the tightening of consumer spending, it has company as it navigates a tricky luxury retail market. Bernard Arnault’s LVMH saw a slower pace in sales growth for the third quarter compared to the previous quarter, pointing to a possible end to the extended heyday in luxury shopping. The group, seen as a bellwether in the luxury industry, attributed the results to “post-Covid normalization of demand and the continued high inventory levels of its retailers.”

It isn’t all doom and gloom for the industry’s players—on Tuesday, the French maker of Birkin bags, Hermès, saw third-quarter sales beat analyst forecasts, instilling hope that spending will bounce back and benefit luxury brands.

“Some people in the industry think there could be a slowdown, particularly for more affordable items. But at this juncture we are not seeing that trend,” Hermès’s CFO Éric du Halgouët told the FT.","{'label': 'Negative', 'score': 0.9999195337295532}",negative,0.9999195337295532,-1
LVMH tests the market for lab-grown diamonds in luxury watches and jewellery - Style,"Tue, 17 Oct 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMipwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5zY21wLmNvbS9tYWdhemluZXMvc3R5bGUvbHV4dXJ5L2pld2VsbGVyeS9hcnRpY2xlLzMyMzgxODcvbGFiLWdyb3duLWRpYW1vbmRzLWx1eHVyeS13YXRjaGVzLWFuZC1qZXdlbGxlcnktdGlmZmFueS1jby1vd25lci1sdm1oLXRlc3RzLW1hcmtldC1pdHMtZnJlZC1sYWJlbNIBpwFodHRwczovL2FtcC5zY21wLmNvbS9tYWdhemluZXMvc3R5bGUvbHV4dXJ5L2pld2VsbGVyeS9hcnRpY2xlLzMyMzgxODcvbGFiLWdyb3duLWRpYW1vbmRzLWx1eHVyeS13YXRjaGVzLWFuZC1qZXdlbGxlcnktdGlmZmFueS1jby1vd25lci1sdm1oLXRlc3RzLW1hcmtldC1pdHMtZnJlZC1sYWJlbA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"In private appointments with clients at its Paris flagship on Rue de la Paix in recent weeks, LVMH’s Fred label has been showing a new high-end jewellery set built around lab-grown diamonds in an unusual blue hue – meant to evoke the sea and reflect founder Fred Samuel’s nautical roots – which are surrounded by natural, white diamonds.

LVMH, owner of natural diamond jeweller Tiffany & Co., has begun showing clients watches and jewellery featuring lab-grown diamonds , testing luxury buyers’ interest in using man-made stones at the very top end of the market.

One of the pieces, a 240,000 euro (US$255,000) necklace, features the blue synthetic diamond in half a carat, a colour that took years of research to develop, according to the label.

Asked if LVMH could broaden its use of artificial stones at Tiffany, finance chief Jean-Jacques Guiony said: “Is it a long-term trend that we could develop elsewhere? It’s too early to say.” He also noted that the group’s bets on man-made stones must be “weighed and assessed carefully”.

Within the sprawling luxury empire, Tag Heuer CEO Frédéric Arnault , one of five LVMH heirs, made the first moves to use lab-grown diamonds, incorporating them in some of the brand’s priciest watches, including a US$90,000 timepiece with a 1.3-carat pink lab-grown diamond as the crown, unveiled earlier this year.

Fred’s Force 10 high jewellery ring, incorporating the Audacious Blue diamond

The use of man-made diamonds in luxury products comes as LVMH remains focused on marketing natural diamonds, particularly at Tiffany, where efforts are led by Frédéric’s older brother Alexandre Arnault , head of product and marketing.

By creating diamonds in unusual hues, LVMH is hoping its synthetic stones will also become highly prized

The label, which is pushing into China, emphasises the provenance of the American jeweller’s diamonds, which are sourced from countries such as Australia, Botswana, Namibia, South Africa and Canada.

Lab-grown diamonds have become more accepted in the United States, where cheaper brands like Pandora and Signet have been increasing their offers of artificial stones.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999880790710449}",neutral,0.9999880790710449,0
Moët & Chandon Celebrates Collection Impériale Collaboration With Daniel Arsham - WWD,"Tue, 03 Oct 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQmh0dHBzOi8vd3dkLmNvbS9leWUvcGFydGllcy9tb2V0LWNoYW5kb24tZGFuaWVsLWFyc2hhbS0xMjM1ODU5MDM1L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"IN THE BUBBLE: Moët & Chandon celebrated the launch of its Collection Impériale in the splashiest of ways — by throwing a lavish dinner at the Hôtel de Bourrienne, an 18th century private mansion that often received Napoleon as a guest. It was the first time the home had been opened for a private event.

Cellar master Benoît Gouez welcomed guests with candlelight and cellos, past an electronic clock projected on the wall, into the garden where a new work from artist Daniel Arsham was on display.

The piece was inspired by a stained-glass window the two discovered while spending time in the chateau’s wine cellar. The house was inspired to commission Arsham for the piece, as well as a unique bottle case, because of the connection.

“We are blending wines from different universes, as Daniel really does in his work. He loves to blend different materials together,” said Gouez of the collaboration. It also marks the 280th anniversary of the LVMH-owned house founded by Claude Moët in 1743.

Gouez has been dreaming of creating a Champagne like this for almost 20 years. It will be a first for the luxury segment, and only 5,000 bottles will be produced.

“Nobody thought before to blend so largely and to play with so many ingredients, and to age the wines in different environments and walls,” he said of the ambitious project. “It’s a new concept, a new vision.”

Blends are typically from different grapes or regions, but Gouez’s blend is bringing together grapes that are aging in various materials — meaning stainless steel, oak cask and bottle.

“It has a never-before-seen complexity,” he said. Five reserve vintages aged in oak from 2012, 2010, 2008, 2006 and 2000 — a “mischievous” year Gouez said — along with a bottle-aged 2004 vintage and a “fresh” 2013.

Arsham spent time with Gouez at the domain to immerse himself in winemaking when they found the window. He took cues from the work including the cherubs, trumpets, vines and a drawing of the chateau itself for his piece. He created his sculpture in four parts, cracked and fragmented to appear ancient.

Now his piece will return to the chateau to be installed near the window that inspired it. The work is also rendered on a limited-edition sculptural carrier that houses the bottle; only 85 will be made.

He also learned about winemaking from Gouez.

“He’s crazy knowledgeable about all of these things that have to go into making the wine — from the composition of the earth that is in the region, to the weather to the blending of the Champagne,” he said. He showed him what works in wine, and what doesn’t.

“You never really get that experience when you’re drinking wine or Champagne. It’s always prepared for you in the way that it should be. So understanding what doesn’t work in a blend was informative.”

Arhsam said learning about the process made him understand how scientific it is — and he will stick to art. “It’s a little bit too technical for me. Making art is more loose, there’s not really any rush to it,” he said. “I’m happy to drink a lot of Champagne though.”

Parisian gallerist Emmanuel Perrotin, British director Nia DaCosta, actress Saffron Hocking, creative director Austin Snyder, photographer Tyler Mitchell, and jewelry designer Jury Kawamura, alongside Moët & Chandon creative director Khoa Dodinh, were among the creative crowd.

Michelin star chef Yannick Alléno prepared the meal, and reminded the guests of their esteemed company. “I’ve cooked twice this month — one for King Charles and tonight for you.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999958276748657}",neutral,0.9999958276748657,0
French billionaire collector Bernard Arnault under investigation for money laundering in connection to Russian oligarch - Art Newspaper,"Thu, 05 Oct 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiogFodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGVhcnRuZXdzcGFwZXIuY29tLzIwMjMvMTAvMDUvZnJlbmNoLWJpbGxpb25haXJlLWNvbGxlY3Rvci1iZXJuYXJkLWFybmF1bHQtdW5kZXItaW52ZXN0aWdhdGlvbi1mb3ItbW9uZXktbGF1bmRlcmluZy1pbi1jb25uZWN0aW9uLXRvLXJ1c3NpYW4tb2xpZ2FyY2jSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"France's richest man, Bernard Arnault, the owner of the LVMH luxury goods conglomerate and the founder of the Fondation Louis Vuitton in Paris, is reportedly under investigation in France on suspicion of money laundering. The investigation, first reported by Le Monde , is a “preliminary one”, according to the Paris prosecutor's office, meaning that Arnault has not been accused of money laundering.

The Paris district attorney confirmed to AFP that Arnault is included in an investigation launched in 2022 into real estate deals allegedly conducted by the Russian oligarch Nikolai Sarkisov, following information provided by the ministry of finance's anti-money laundering service, Tracfin.

Sarkisov is not listed under European sanctions following Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine, but he is included on the list of businesspeople sanctioned by Ukraine for his close ties with the Kremlin.

The probe concerns properties in the luxury French ski resort Courchevel. Arnault owns two hotels there, one of them being Le Cheval Blanc. According to investigators, quoted by Le Monde, Sarkisov, in 2018, bought 17 units in a building next to this hotel, for €18.3m. The name of the oligarch, who made his fortune in the insurance business in Russia, does not appear in these transactions. Rather, the buyer is listed the company La Flèche. But, according to Tracfin, a series of complex financial transactions across a string of European companies leads to a Cyprus based firm, Arrowband, whose sole holder is Sarkisov.

The entire €18.3m operation was funded by Métropole 1850, a subsidiary of Bernard Arnault’s private holdings, according to Trafcin's investigation. A few months later, the same Métropole 1850 acquired the company that owned the building from Sarkisov, for €1.8m. Tracfin's investigation aims to discover the discrepancy in these prices. The sale of the real estate to himself allowed Sarkisov to make a profit of €1.2m, according to Le Monde.

Tracfin’s investigators state that Sarkisov acted as “a straw man hired to conceal the actual beneficiary, ie Bernard Arnault”.

Both parties have denied wrongdoing. Arnault’s lawyer, Jacqueline Laffont, stated “the transaction was perfectly legitimate” and that the allegations from the media are “absurd”. She adds: “Who could possibly imagine that the man who built Europe’s leading company would resort to money laundering for the extension of a hotel?“

A source close to Sarkisov confirmed the deal to Le Monde, but said his real estate firm had “taken all the risks” by buying the units one by one before reselling the building, which then became more valuable. ""If any of the owners had refused to sell, the whole operation would have failed,"" he said.

Although the transaction took place four years before the current sanctions against Russia, Tracfin has renewed its investigations into Russian-owned properties in France, including those owned by Sarkisov. Another investigation for “bribery” and “criminal laundering” has been opened into a €3m consultant contract he signed in 2019 with former French President Nicolas Sarkozy.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9997134804725647}",neutral,0.9997134804725647,0
The First LVMH Lab-Grown Diamond High Jewelry Is Here - National Jeweler,"Wed, 18 Oct 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vbmF0aW9uYWxqZXdlbGVyLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy8xMjM3Ni10aGUtZmlyc3QtbHZtaC1sYWItZ3Jvd24tZGlhbW9uZC1oaWdoLWpld2VscnktaXMtaGVyZdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"



The maison, owned by LVMH, has focused lately on a specific shade of blue, a hue reminiscent of the vibrant French Riviera.



The color was particularly special to the brand’s late founder and lover of the sea, Fred Samuel.



The tone served as a warm reminder of his childhood and the palette of the Mediterranean Sea, changing and sparkling as the sun moves across the sky.



This summer, the brand unveiled the “Happy Blue Shades,” a collection of pieces featuring its Riviera blue through stones such as aquamarine, blue topaz, sapphire, lapis lazuli, turquoise, and amazonite, all meant to channel the glistening waters of the sea.



The color was integrated into pieces in the “Force 10,” “Chance Infinie,” “Pretty Woman” and “Pain de Sucre” lines, four of the brand’s well-known collections.



Recently, Fred announced its newest offering on the theme—a lab-grown diamond in its beloved Riveria blue.



Named the “Fred Audacious Blue,” the brand billed it as, “the very first blue lab-grown diamond, the first in the maison’s history.”



The 8.88-carat “Fred Audacious Blue” is the first lab-grown diamond French brand Fred has used in its jewelry.

Fred also introduced four smaller diamonds of the same color.



The gemstones, 0.5-carat each, are featured in four new pieces that are part of an exclusive high jewelry set, “Force 10 Duality,” inspired by the brand’s original Force 10 collection.



In each piece, the blue lab-grown diamonds are set with natural white diamonds, which Fred calls a “union between tradition and technology.”



Each stone was graded by the Gemological Institute of America (GIA) and cut in the brand’s proprietary 36-facet “Hero Cut,” first unveiled in 2022 and intentionally chosen for its appearance of a boat sail combined with a shield.

Making The Grade

Creating the lab-grown blue diamond required what Fred said was a “skillful blend of savoir-faire and strong technical expertise.”



The 8.88-carat final product required a sizeable rough stone, specifically one weighing about 36 carats.

The company said replicating the Audacious Blue took 18 months of technique development to “perfect and stabilize” the color.

While GIA uses a D-to-Z grading system for white diamonds to indicate the level of colorlessness, fancy color diamonds are graded in order of increasing color strength, from faint, very light, light, fancy light and fancy to fancy intense, fancy vivid, fancy dark and fancy deep.



Naturally occurring colored diamonds have been found in a full spectrum of colors, but GIA said only one in 10,000 natural diamonds has a fancy color, with blue diamonds among the rarest.



Colored diamonds occur because of impurities or structural defects within the chemical composition of the gemstone.



Some environments produce colored diamonds with a secondary color. In that case, GIA includes a modifier to indicate it. Blue diamonds can have secondary colors like gray, green or violet.



Larry West, a wholesaler specializing in natural colored diamonds and an owner of LJ West Diamonds Inc., said that generally, a grade of a single color is rarer, but factors like size and strength of color all help determine the stone’s true value.



“Two colors is not as good as the straight color,” said West. “In general, people pay less for the greenish-blue [than a straight blue], but once you get into the ultra, best colors, it becomes so rare, especially regarding the size.



“Theoretically, if you have a vivid greenish-blue, it could be worth as much or more, in general.”



The Question of Price

As is the case with all natural colored diamonds, those with fancy intense and fancy vivid grades generally command the highest prices. For blues, especially large sizes, that can mean a



However, just like with colorless diamonds, lab-grown colored diamond prices are much lower than their natural counterparts.

Green Rocks produced the stones in partnership with Fire Diamonds, which performed the color treatment. Parisian luxury brand Fred Jewelry is regarded for its exquisite and distinctive creations.The maison, owned by LVMH, has focused lately on a specific shade of blue, a hue reminiscent of the vibrant French Riviera.The color was particularly special to the brand’s late founder and lover of the sea, Fred Samuel.The tone served as a warm reminder of his childhood and the palette of the Mediterranean Sea, changing and sparkling as the sun moves across the sky.This summer, the brand unveiled the “Happy Blue Shades,” a collection of pieces featuring its Riviera blue through stones such as aquamarine, blue topaz, sapphire, lapis lazuli, turquoise, and amazonite, all meant to channel the glistening waters of the sea.The color was integrated into pieces in the “Force 10,” “Chance Infinie,” “Pretty Woman” and “Pain de Sucre” lines, four of the brand’s well-known collections.Recently, Fred announced its newest offering on the theme—a lab-grown diamond in its beloved Riveria blue.Named the “Fred Audacious Blue,” the brand billed it as, “the very first blue lab-grown diamond, the first in the maison’s history.”The loose diamond weighs 8.88 carats, symbolic of Samuel’s birthday in August 1908 and his first store opening in the eighth arrondissement of Paris.Fred also introduced four smaller diamonds of the same color.The gemstones, 0.5-carat each, are featured in four new pieces that are part of an exclusive high jewelry set, “Force 10 Duality,” inspired by the brand’s original Force 10 collection.In each piece, the blue lab-grown diamonds are set with natural white diamonds, which Fred calls a “union between tradition and technology.”Each stone was graded by the Gemological Institute of America (GIA) and cut in the brand’s proprietary 36-facet “Hero Cut,” first unveiled in 2022 and intentionally chosen for its appearance of a boat sail combined with a shield.

Last year at JCK , wholesaler Green Rocks Diamonds displayed a variety of lab-grown colored diamonds, some set in jewelry, in a range of hues—including blues—and sizes of up to 13 carats. Green Rocks produced the stones in partnership with Fire Diamonds, which performed the color treatment.

When National Jeweler reported on the partnership, the offering consisted of 15 pieces with retail price points ranging from $2,499 to $65,000.



Leung told WWD the four pieces in the Force 10 Duality set are priced at 540,000 euros total, or $569,808, on par with the price if Fred had used white natural diamonds as center stones, according to Leung.





The “Force 10 Duality” bracelet features two parallel rows of brilliant-cut and princess-cut natural diamonds connected by Force 10’s signature buckle. The buckle features a 0.5-carat lab-grown blue diamond set in the center, surrounded by white gold and natural white diamonds, and punctuated by a blue sapphire cabochon and natural white diamond on either end. The Force 10 Duality necklace is a choker with a detachable asymmetrical pendant. It features a row of natural princess-cut diamonds on one side and a row of natural brilliant-cut diamonds bezel-set on the other. The buckle is set with a half-carat blue lab-grown diamond. The Force 10 Duality ring, along with a single earring, completes the Force 10 Duality set.



However, he said the 8.88-carat loose lab-grown blue diamond does not yet have a price.



When I asked West what he thought, ballpark, the Fred Audacious Blue would be priced at in comparison with a natural 8-carat fancy vivid greenish blue diamond, he said a mined stone of that size and with a color distinction of vivid, likely may never exist.



If it did, it would be the largest of its kind, and would fetch an incredibly high price.



Setting Itself Apart

Colorless lab-grown diamonds today are indistinguishable from their mined counterparts, and the side-by-side comparison is a tool often used to accentuate the difference in pricing.



However, once lab-grown colored diamonds reach a certain caliber, like the Audacious Blue, they may not have a comparable mined mate due to the rarity of these stones in nature.



With the capability to manufacture diamonds with no mined counterpart for comparison, it not only raises the interesting question of price, but also that of new opportunities in the colored lab-grown diamond space.

Former LVMH Chairman of North America Pauline Brown joins Yahoo Finance to discuss her views on how Birkenstock has fared in recent years and what the brand will have to achieve to keep the company strong going forward.

Brown expresses her thoughts on the valuation: ""They were too greedy at coming out at $46 a share... I think it was too aggressive and a bit reckless.""

Brown continues, looking at the company's shift away from functionality and doubling down as a fashion brand, which she feels is ""a much harder audience to sustain or to build on than the original audience of orthopedic and hippies who were living with it for a good generation.""

Video Transcript

JOSH LIPTON: Let me start with Birkenstock, kind of, a bumpy debut here. What do you make of Birkenstock and at least the initial public market reaction?

PAULINE BROWN: Well, I think the reaction is more a reflection of the pricing than it is the quality of the stock. On the one hand, this is a blockbuster deal for its owners L Catterton, the Arnault group, a few others. They just bought it a little over two years ago at a price that is about half of the valuation that it is today even on the 10% drop. So on the one hand, I say my hat's off to them. In two years to have that kind of appreciation is pretty astounding.

On the other hand, I say they were too greedy in coming out at 46 a share. I mean, that is a valuation that, from a multiple basis, is closer to Nike than it is to Adidas and it is way in excess of Adidas as a multiple of EBITDA. So I think it was too aggressive and a bit reckless.

JULIE HYMAN: Pauline, let's talk about Birkenstock as a company, right, and as a product. And as someone who is in that world, obviously, Birkenstock already has had a lot of staying power and even in its modern iteration has managed to have a lot of staying power. How does that evolve as a public company? Does it, sort of-- will it rise to the demands of being a public company in terms of sales and in terms of still appealing to customers?

PAULINE BROWN: Well, first of all, I would argue that I'm not sure the staying power is quite as you just characterized. For the first 250 years of its existence, it went from $0 to about $300 million in sales. It was only in the last decade that it went from around 300 million to around $1.3 billion in fiscal '22.

So the run up in a very short slice of time relative to its long history, it says to me that this is a fashion play. This is not a company that is selling on its functionality. Its functionality was there for two and a half centuries in terms of it being a well-produced shoe, one that historically targeted hippies and those in need of orthopedic support.

Nowadays, if you look at who's buying it, it is more akin to sneakerheads and fashionistas. So a lot of the newer growth is built up on a more modern-day branding and that will be tested as to whether that's sustainable. That is a much harder audience to sustain or to build on than the original audience of orthopedic and hippies who were living with it for a good generation.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.999198853969574}",neutral,0.999198853969574,0
Birkenstock tripped over its own sandals trying to take a step in the IPO world - Fortune,"Thu, 12 Oct 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vZm9ydHVuZS5jb20vZXVyb3BlLzIwMjMvMTAvMTIvYmlya2Vuc3RvY2staXBvLXN0b2NrLXByaWNlLWFuYWx5c3RzLWx2bWgv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"With their unique chunky sole and often colored straps, it’s hard to mistake a pair of Birkenstocks for anything else. Though unassuming in appearance, the one-time hippie sandals have lately become synonymous with comfortable yet chic footwear, and have found fans among the elite—Apple cofounder Steve Jobs owned a pair of Birks, and his beloved sandals sold for a whopping $218,000 last year. The sandal then achieved more mainstream celebrity status when it featured in the Barbie movie.

Now, the once frumpy anti-brand has made what is arguably the biggest jump in its 250-year history, as its shares began trading Wednesday on the New York Stock Exchange after an IPO that initially valued the company at $8.6 billion.

But after the highly anticipated public offering ultimately slumped 13% in what was the worst first-day trading for a U.S. listing valued at over $1 billion in the last two years, Birkenstocks’s leap to public markets has raised bigger questions about the brand, and the wider industry as a whole.

“It’s always tricky to comment on one-day share price performance,” said Javier Gonzalez Lastra, a consumer sector expert at Tema ETFs. “But the timing of the IPO was in a way unfortunate as it followed LVMH Q3 results, in which management stressed how European consumers had deteriorated in a significant way…dragging down the share prices of many consumer discretionary stocks.”

Senior broker at Clear Capital Markets Ron Faulkner said: “Birkenstock was heavily overvalued at IPO, it’s the valuation that private equity firms put on these type of companies coming to market so they can see an exit. An $1 billion valuation [is] very optimistic, inflation rising at 15-year highs and consumer spending dwindling doesn’t bode well for luxury consumer brands.”

Why are Birkenstocks so special?

Birkenstock’s humble beginnings go back to 1774 in the German village of Langen-Bergheim where Johann Adam Birkenstock hand-made shoes at a time when people owned a single pair of shoes their entire lives, but it wasn’t until some 130 years later that an initial design of the breakthrough rounded “footbed” heel that features in the sandals today was created.

The Birkenstock family’s descendants continued to dabble with the sandal’s design before the first one resembling those sold in the millions today was introduced in 1963.

As the brand introduced more models, its fame began to reach average people, but also celebrities. Birkenstocks had clearly begun to crack open a market far beyond medical, functional purposes—it was an object of fascination, and luxury, even.

An iconic moment in Birkenstock’s path to becoming the in style was when LVMH-owned French fashion brand Céline introduced a furry, bejeweled pair of sandals, according to market research firm Circana’s footwear and accessories analyst, Beth Goldstein.

“This kicked off the renewed and broader interest in the brand,” Goldstein told Fortune. “Birkenstock began partnering with various designer brands, releasing these collaborations just as the comfort and casual movement was really taking hold.”

Birkenstock remained in the family for six generations before being acquired by private equity firm L Catterton and Financière Agache, the family holding company of LVMH boss Bernard Arnault, in 2021. The deal valued the company at $4.3 billion, according to Reuters.

The company has since been expanding investment in its production sites, including a multimillion-dollar site in Pasewalk, Germany. It sold 30 million pairs of shoes in the 2022 fiscal year, while its revenue rose 21% in the nine months ending June 30 to €1.12 billion ($1.20 billion).

Birkenstock’s appearance in the Barbie movie reaffirmed its cultural zeitgeist.

One of the “Arizona” sandals is shown alongside a high-heeled shoe as a choice between glamorous “Barbieland” and the real world, which Barbie hesitantly chooses but is ultimately happy with. The short plug of the sandal in the movie had a big impact on the company—searches for Birkenstock shoes reportedly jumped over 500% in the U.K. alone.

“BIRK” comes to NYSE

While Birkenstock’s launch into public markets symbolizes its rise from what CEO Oliver Reichert called a “sleeping giant” to a major international fashion brand, it continues to face challenges, including economic pressures that have prompted shoppers to pull back on spending.

This reluctance has been reflected in the earnings of companies, starting with one that has a distant connection with Birkenstock—LVMH. The French conglomerate saw sales growth slow as consumers cut spending, especially in the U.S. and Europe, which also happen to be Birkenstock’s core markets—they account for 90% of its customers.

“Clearly, the consumer environment has become more difficult,” Javier Gonzalez Lastra told Fortune. “There’s a lot of upside…but there’s also concerns by many investors that this may be just a fad and then things reverse, which is not the first time it would happen with a successful consumer brand.”

Is Birkenstock a good stock to buy?

Birkenstock’s path as a public company is likely to face obstacles in the near future.

In recent months, chip company Arm and delivery app Instacart have been trading below their offer prices, while tech platform Klaviyo has seen a slight increase in its stock price since its September listing. Shoemakers like Dr. Martens and On Holdings have seen market value slide since their public listing in 2021.

Crocs—another player in the comfy footwear market loved by some and detested by others—is a clear example of the reticence of investors to reward ever-growing companies.

It has posted strong quarterly earnings with consolidated revenues up 12% for the third quarter of 2023, but its stock has slid nearly 20% this year.

Still, some shareholders have already make handsome gains—and are expecting more. Birkenstock’s heirs have already become $3.4 billion richer following the company’s IPO on Wednesday.

And L Catterton’s managing partner Nikhil Thukral told Bloomberg before the shares began trading that despite the tricky timing of the IPO amid global uncertainties, the firm was not planning on exiting Birkenstock anytime soon.

“What is a great brand? You find out in markets like this, if you have something extraordinary,” he said.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.999902606010437}",neutral,0.999902606010437,0

The stock opened at $41 per share on the New York Stock Exchange on Oct. 11 after being priced at $46 per share, marking it the worst debut by a company worth over $1 billion in nearly two years, Reuters reported.

A week later, Birkenstock stock is looking to claw back a gain after sliding as much as 21% in the first week of trading. Shares rose Tuesday but moved lower again in early trading on Wednesday, trading over 4% off its Oct. 11 opening price.

The stock's rocky debut puts the 249-year-old German premium footwear maker alongside other major companies to IPO this year, including SoftBank-backed Arm (ARM), Instacart (CART), Cava (CAVA), and Klaviyo (KVYO), all of which are trading below their IPO prices.

""I think a big issue has been the reset in valuations for growth companies,"" University of Florida professor Jay Ritter said. ""With a company like Birkenstock, which is much more mature, there's less uncertainty. But there's still uncertainty about its ability to grow future profits.""

Investors hoped the recent slate of major companies going public would solidify a comeback in the IPO market. However, the class was subject to slumping shares and volatility, signaling doubt amongst investors. Companies eyeing IPOs will likely think long and hard about coming to the public markets.

""When you look at what's happened with the recent IPOs, it has not been the performance that anyone has wanted,"" PitchBook US venture capital lead analyst Kyle Stanford told Yahoo Finance Live. ""These IPOs are just not finding the interest that they were hoping for. ... So it doesn't bode well for the rest of 4Q or even early 2024.""

Birkenstock faces other challenges that go beyond a disappointing initial public offering, such as concerns about consumer spending, particularly as it has repositioned its brand.

The brand falls under the ""nice to have"" category, Torch Capital founder Jon Keidan told Yahoo Finance's Brooke DiPalma last week. Although the product became known for its functionality and orthopedic support, it has since become a luxury and, therefore, more vulnerable to weakening discretionary demand.

""Nowadays, if you look at who's buying it, it is more akin to sneakerheads and fashionistas,"" Brown said. ""So a lot of the newer growth is built upon a more modern-day branding, and that will be tested as to whether that's sustainable.""

LVMH Results May Mean An End To Luxury's 3-Year Party 10/13/2023 - MediaPost Communications,"Fri, 13 Oct 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1lZGlhcG9zdC5jb20vcHVibGljYXRpb25zL2FydGljbGUvMzkwMTM1L2x2bWgtcmVzdWx0cy1tYXktbWVhbi1hbi1lbmQtdG8tbHV4dXJ5cy0zLXllYXItcC5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"by Sarah Mahoney @mahoney_sarah, October 12, 2023

The latest quarterly results from LVMH, parent of Louis Vuitton, Tiffany and Dior, sent jitters through the luxury sector. Overall, company sales climbed 9% for the quarter after currency adjustments, when luxury insiders expected gains of 11%. But news of the conglomerate’s slowing growth in Europe and China, weakness in the U.S., and a downturn in wine and spirits also set alarm bells off throughout the entire category.

The company is coming off several quarters of solid growth and three years of robust expansion. So, while it is still putting up enviable numbers, the third-quarter results seemed alarmingly low by comparison. Sales in Asia (excluding Japan) rose just 11%, compared to 34% in the previous quarter, as much of China reopened, for example. And sales in Europe were up 7%, down from a 19% jump in the last quarter.

In the U.S., sales added 2%, an improvement over last quarter’s 1% decline. In a conference call webcast for investors, Jean-Jacques Guiony, LVMH’s chief financial officer, said that those U.S. results “improved marginally a little bit across the board, doing better in fashion, watches and jewelry -- and, unfortunately, not in cognac.”

Weakness in cognac in the U.S. and China dragged sales in the wine and spirits division down 14%. Watch and jewelry sales slowed to a gain of just 3%, compared to 14% in the previous quarter.

Fashion and leather goods sales rose 9%, as did results in perfumes and cosmetics. In the selective retailing division, which includes Sephora and Bon Marche, sales again achieved an impressive 25% increase.

Guiony said differences in spending between aspirational shoppers -- under more economic pressure -- and wealthy individuals, are consistent across divisions and geographies, as well as previous quarters.

“Overall, the report reiterated previous indications of a slowing luxury sector, with incrementally negative takeaways on domestic European demand,” writes Mark Altschwager, an analyst at Baird. While Baird does not cover LVMH, it follows Tapestry, Coach's parent, and Capri Holdings, owner of Michael Kors, Versace and Jimmy Choo. (Tapestry’s acquisition of Capri is expected to close next year.)

“Bigger picture, we remain cautious on the North American demand backdrop for the remainder of 2023 and into 2024 given challenged consumer spending power, which we expect will limit upside to management guidance near-term.”

In June, Bain & Company projected the luxury goods market would grow between 5% and 12% in 2023 despite uncertain economic conditions.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9491626024246216}",positive,0.9491626024246216,1
Bernard Arnault Is No Longer the World's Second Richest Man - HYPEBEAST,"Wed, 18 Oct 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vaHlwZWJlYXN0LmNvbS8yMDIzLzEwL2Jlcm5hcmQtYXJuYXVsdC1sdm1oLW5vdC13b3JsZHMtc2Vjb25kLXJpY2hlc3QtbWFuLWplZmYtYmV6b3MtYW1hem9uLW5vdy1oYXMtdGl0bGXSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Fashion mogul and LVMH CEO Bernard Arnault is no longer the world’s second richest man. Amazon founder Jeff Bezos has now surpassed Arnault, as LVMH recently faced a slip in stocks.

The French tycoon’s wealth has now fallen below Bezos’ net worth amidst the slowdown in demand for luxury goods, losing $7 billion USD this year alone, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Over the course of three trading sessions last week, the company’s shares slid 10%, and are now down 3% this year. In contrast, Bezos’ fortune has seen a growth from $49 billion USD to $156 billion USD to put him ahead of Arnault’s $155 billon USD.

Thanks to the share surge at Amazon, Bezos’ net worth has climbed 58% this year. Due to the interest in AI, many mega-cap technology stocks have saw an increase. Both Bezos and Arnault have previously held the title for world’s richest man. In June, Elon Musk dethroned Arnault. At the time his wealth increased 40.3% to $192 billion USD with his 13% ownership of Tesla. Now, the X owner’s fortune has gone up to $234 billion USD thanks to Tesla’s surge in stock price by over 100%. In the race to who’s the next billionaire, it remains to be seen who will come out on top next.

LVMH and Dior Tap Gymnast Mélanie de Jesus dos Santos Ahead of 2024 Olympics - WWD,"Mon, 09 Oct 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiwFodHRwczovL3d3ZC5jb20vZmFzaGlvbi1uZXdzL2Zhc2hpb24tc2Nvb3BzL2d5bW5hc3QtbWVsYW5pZS1kZS1qZXN1cy1kb3Mtc2FudG9zLWx2bWgtc3BvbnNvcnNoaXAtZGlvci1hbWJhc3NhZG9yLXBhcmlzLW9seW1waWNzLTEyMzU4NjQwMzQv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"AGILE MOVE: French gymnast Mélanie de Jesus dos Santos has scored a double win ahead of the 2024 Paris Olympics.

Dior tapped the 23-year-old athlete as its latest brand ambassador, and she will also be sponsored by LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton ahead of the Paris Olympics, the French luxury house and its parent group said Monday.

“Animated by the same values of audacity, creativity and excellence dear to Christian Dior, Mélanie de Jesus dos Santos builds every day her dream: that of an Olympic medal in Paris,” said the group in a statement revealing de Jesus dos Santos’ new role.

Considered a headliner of France’s artistic gymnastic team, de Jesus dos Santos is a four-time European champion in her field and was a finalist at the Tokyo Olympics. Having moved to the U.S., she trains in Houston alongside Olympian and fellow gymnast Simone Biles.

Last week she and her teammates of the French gymnastics team made headlines for winning a bronze medal at the World Gymnastics Championships, a first for the country since 1950.

The Martinique-born athlete strongly contributed to the win when she distinguished herself with a stunning performance on the beam during the world contest.

Dior said in a separate communication that the deal embodied the “passionate link in the name of excellence” and its desire to “encourage the dreams and talent of new generations.” The house also counts British tennis player Emma Raducanu, South Korean figure skater Yuna Kim and China speed skater Zhang Hong among its ambassadors.

De Jesus dos Santos becomes the second athlete to be sponsored by LVMH, in the wake of swimmer Léon Marchand.

The French group signed on to become a premium partner of the Paris 2024 Olympic and Paralympic Games in July, with Antoine Arnault, the group’s head of communication, image and environment, saying several of its houses would play a special role during the games.

A cohort of four or five Olympic and Paralympic athletes will benefit from financial support and privileged introductions to the group’s houses.

The next athlete is expected to be revealed at the end of October.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9990001320838928}",neutral,0.9990001320838928,0
