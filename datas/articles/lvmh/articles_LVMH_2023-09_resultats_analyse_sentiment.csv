In the front row sat four of his five adult children — the fifth was watching from New York, where he is an executive at Tiffany & Company. Their father had raised all of them since they could walk to one day run the LVMH conglomerate.

The occasion was Mr. Arnault’s announcement that LVMH would provide 150 million euros (about $161 million) to sponsor the 2024 Paris Olympics. LVMH companies will play a starring role. Chaumet, a Paris jeweler whose clients once included Napoleon’s wife Joséphine, will design the Olympic medals, and Moët Hennessy wines will flow in hospitality suites.

“The partnership will help promote France throughout the world,” Mr. Arnault declared. As television cameras zoomed in, his eldest son, Antoine, the head of communications and image for LVMH, uttered what could be a tagline for this huge company his father has built: “For a dream, there is no price.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999961853027344}",neutral,0.9999961853027344,0
Bernard Arnault spent $230 million on LVMH shares after disappointing earnings hit stock - Fortune,"Fri, 08 Sep 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vZm9ydHVuZS5jb20vZXVyb3BlLzIwMjMvMDkvMDgvYmVybmFyZC1hcm5hdWx0LWJ1eXMtZGlwLWx2bWgtc2hhcmVzLWFmdGVyLWRpc2FwcG9pbnRpbmctZWFybmluZ3Mv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Billionaire Bernard Arnault has bought €215 million ($230 million) of LVMH shares since the luxury conglomerate’s disappointing earnings in late July contributed to a drop in the stock price.

Arnault’s Financiere Agache and Christian Dior SE vehicles began buying LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE three days after the July 25 earnings report, French regulatory filings show. The stock has slumped 14% since then, weighed down by slowing economies in China and the US, persistent inflation and rising interest rates.

The French businessman and his family own about 48% of LVMH’s shares with almost 64% of the voting rights. Arnault, the world’s second-wealthiest individual, regularly buys LVMH stock, with breaks for the blackout periods around earnings reports, the filings show.

A representative for Arnault declined to comment.

LVMH’s second-quarter results showed the luxury behemoth, owner of brands such as Louis Vuitton and Tiffany & Co., has been struggling in the US, with organic revenue falling 1% there. That performance spooked investors, with shares dropping 5.2% the next trading session, a move that dragged the whole sector down as well as the CAC 40 Index.

The 7.8% drop in LVMH shares last month was the biggest monthly decline since December. The slump last week dethroned LVMH as the biggest European company by market value, with Danish drugmaker Novo Nordisk A/S overtaking the luxury giant thanks to booming sales of its Ozempic obesity treatment.

That means Arnault’s wealth has come down from a record $212.4 billion in mid-July. As of Thursday, it stood at $170.4 billion, behind Elon Musk’s $230.7 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.

LVMH shares are still up by about 8.8% for the year.","{'label': 'Negative', 'score': 0.9998947381973267}",negative,0.9998947381973267,-1
Report: LVMH CEO Bernard Arnault Faces Money Laundering Investigation - PYMNTS.com,"Fri, 29 Sep 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnB5bW50cy5jb20vbGVnYWwvMjAyMy9yZXBvcnQtbHZtaC1jZW8tYmVybmFyZC1hcm5hdWx0LWZhY2VzLW1vbmV5LWxhdW5kZXJpbmctaW52ZXN0aWdhdGlvbi_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"French billionaire Bernard Arnault, the CEO of luxury conglomerate LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE, is reportedly under investigation for possible money laundering.

The investigation, initiated by the Paris public prosecutor’s office, focuses on Arnault’s dealings with Russian businessman Nikolai Sarkisov and their transactions related to properties in the exclusive ski resort of Courchevel, Bloomberg reported Friday (Sept. 29), citing an article by Le Monde newspaper.

LVMH did not immediately reply to PYMNTS’ request for comment.

Sarkisov purchased several properties in Courchevel in 2018 through intermediary companies, according to the report. It was later found that the ultimate buyer of these properties was Arnault. The investigation alleges that Arnault paid Sarkisov approximately 20 million euros ($21.2 million) for these assets, while Sarkisov reportedly profited around 2 million euros ($2.1 million) from the deals.

The investigation is focused on whether these transactions were used to conceal the origin of the funds and the identity of the ultimate buyer, the report said.

Le Monde cited sources familiar with Arnault, who claimed that the deals were conducted within the boundaries of the law.

It was reported in January that Arnault gained an even greater lead as the world’s richest person when LVMH’s market capitalization reached a record high. When the fashion and luxury goods group’s share price rose to over 800 euros (about $863 at the time) on Jan. 17, the company’s market cap reached 400 billion euros (about $431.5 billion) for the first time, Reuters reported at the time.

More recently, LVMH reported in July that it had seen a drop in U.S. sales during the second quarter, attributing the change to a decrease in shopping activity among aspirational shoppers on entry-level products compared to their previous habits.

Company executives added that LVMH’s high-priced goods are performing well in the U.S., possibly because wealthier shoppers are less affected by inflation, student debt and economic fluctuations.

LVMH is also involved in the potential initial public offering (IPO) of German footwear brand Birkenstock, as LVMH backs the brand’s owner, private equity firm L Catterton. L Catterton and the family investment company of Arnault acquired a majority stake in Birkenstock two years ago in a deal that valued it at roughly 4 billion euros ($4.2 billion).","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999573230743408}",neutral,0.9999573230743408,0
LVMH boss Bernard Arnault under investigation in Paris over Russian oligarch transactions - CNBC,"Fri, 29 Sep 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tLzIwMjMvMDkvMjkvbHZtaC1ib3NzLWJlcm5hcmQtYXJuYXVsdC11bmRlci1pbnZlc3RpZ2F0aW9uLWluLXBhcmlzLW92ZXItb2xpZ2FyY2gtdHJhbnNhY3Rpb25zLmh0bWzSAXpodHRwczovL3d3dy5jbmJjLmNvbS9hbXAvMjAyMy8wOS8yOS9sdm1oLWJvc3MtYmVybmFyZC1hcm5hdWx0LXVuZGVyLWludmVzdGlnYXRpb24taW4tcGFyaXMtb3Zlci1vbGlnYXJjaC10cmFuc2FjdGlvbnMuaHRtbA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Bernard Arnault, Chairman and CEO of LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton, attends a news conference to present the 2022 annual results of LVMH in Paris, France, January 26, 2023.

The prosecutor's office declined to comment further on the ongoing investigations. A preliminary investigation does not necessarily imply wrongdoing, and Le Monde cited a close associate of Arnault as saying the deal was carried out within the scope of French law.

The Paris prosecutor's office confirmed Friday that a preliminary investigation had been underway since 2022, and that a Tracfin report ""drawing the attention of the prosecutor's office to operations concerning Mr. Bernard Arnault and Mr. Sarkisov, likely to characterize acts of money laundering, has been attached to this procedure.""

French newspaper Le Monde reported Thursday, citing France's Tracfin financial intelligence unit, that Sarkisov had bought real estate at an Alpine resort with the help of a loan from Arnault.

Arnault, founder, CEO and chairman of the world's largest luxury goods company and one of the world's richest men, lost a high court case against French tax investigators in February over the legality of a 2019 raid on LVMH's headquarters. The raid related to a tax fraud probe linked to activities in Belgium.

Nikolai Sarkisov is a senior figure at his brother Sergey's Russian insurance company, RESO-Garantia.

RESO-Garantia Deputy CEO Igor Ivanov told CNBC on Friday that neither the company, nor Nikolai Sarkisov personally had been involved in the transaction, and that Sarkisov had never met Arnault.

""The transaction was managed by a small investment unit which invests professionally in European real estate. It consisted of acquiring flats in an old building in Courchevel from various private owners, with the view to sell them later to a developer once the entire building was bought out,"" Ivanov said in an email.

""All transactions were carried out by French companies, through French notaries by French lawyers on all sides. This was a usual real estate deal.""

He added that neither the company nor Sarkisov had received any request for documents from French authorities.

LVMH this weekend sent CNBC a comment from Jacqueline Laffont, Arnault's lawyer, who said the allegations of money laundering were ""as absurd as they are unfounded.""

""The operation that was conducted to allow the expansion of the White Horse Hotel in Courchevel is well known and was conducted in compliance with the laws and with the support of councils. The investigation, apparently in progress, will not fail to recognize this,"" she said, according to the statement.

""Moreover, who can seriously imagine that Mr. Bernard Arnault, who for the past 40 years has built France and Europe's top company would engage in money laundering to expand a hotel? I think that the senseless nature of these allegations cannot escape anyone.""

LVMH Share Price: What are Analysts Predicting for This French Luxury Giant? - TipRanks.com - TipRanks,"Thu, 14 Sep 2023 12:55:56 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRpcHJhbmtzLmNvbS9uZXdzL2dsb2JhbC1tYXJrZXRzL2x2bWgtc2hhcmUtcHJpY2Utd2hhdC1hcmUtYW5hbHlzdHMtcHJlZGljdGluZy1mb3ItdGhpcy1mcmVuY2gtbHV4dXJ5LWdpYW500gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"According to analysts, the share price of the French luxury company LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, or LVMH (FR:MC) is expected to grow by around 30%. Analysts have an optimistic outlook on the stock, rating it a Strong Buy. However, they have lowered their price targets and anticipate some short-term volatility.

Recently, LVMH stock lost its spot as the most valuable company in Europe to Danish healthcare giant Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO). This ended a 2.5-year long run for the company, hit by growing concerns about the Chinese economy and a slowdown in U.S. revenues. This further added to investors’ woes, particularly in light of the company’s underwhelming performance in the U.S. in Q2 2023. Consequently, the LVMH share price has been on a downward trend over the last six months, experiencing a 9% decline in trading.

LVMH is a leading European conglomerate renowned for its ownership of approximately 75 luxury brands, including Dior, Louis Vuitton, Sephora, Fendi, Bulgari, etc. The company’s diverse product portfolio includes bags, watches, cosmetics, wine, perfumes, and more.

What are Analysts Predicting?

Today, Barclays analyst Carole Madjo downgraded her rating on the stock from Buy to Hold. Madjo believes that luxury product companies are struggling to improve their sales in China, which will “weigh further on their stock prices.” She lowered her target price from €932 to €835 (upside of 14.6%). Madjo also remains concerned about the luxury goods sector due to worsening macroeconomic indicators from China, and changed her industry view from positive to neutral.

On the contrary, analyst Piral Dadhania from RBC Capital confirmed his Buy rating on the stock today, suggesting a growth of 22%. He reduced his price target from €940 to €890.

Yesterday, Luca Solca from Bernstein reiterated his Buy rating on the stock with a price target of €953. This implies an upside potential of 30.8% in the share price.

What is the Future Price of LVMH Stock?

MC stock has received a Strong Buy rating on TipRanks, backed by a total of 12 recommendations from analysts. It includes 10 Buy and two Hold ratings. The LVMH share price target is €932.92, which is 28% higher than the current trading level.

BMI and Stella McCartney celebrated the 50th anniversary of Hip-Hop at her SoHo boutique during New York Fashion Week. Located at 112 Greene Street, the store was previously the landmark location of the historic Greene St. Recording studio. The Greene Street Soirée presented by BMI, LVMH and Stella McCartney, brought together voices bridging music, fashion and art and featured performance by next-gen rapper Kaliii, a special guest appearance by Lil’ Kim, music by DJ Will, and murals by Thrive Collective.

BMI President & CEO Mike O’Neill, alongside EVP, Chief Revenue & Creative Officer Mike Steinberg, SVP Chief Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Officer Sandye Taylor, VP Creative, Atlanta, Catherine Brewton and Creative Director, Atlanta Reggie Stewart, presented Lil’ Kim with a unique piece by acclaimed artist DL Warfield to celebrate her part in the legacy of Hip-Hop.

“BMI was thrilled to collaborate with Stella McCartney and LVMH in celebrating the 50th anniversary of Hip-Hop and its undeniable influence on music, culture, fashion and beyond,” said Sandye Taylor. “We were honoured to have two BMI songwriters, the legendary Lil’ Kim and breakout artist Kaliii, with us to celebrate this historic milestone and highlight the impact that women have made on the genre. The party was epic, with music, fashion and philanthropy coming together to ensure Hip-Hop’s legacy for generations to come.”

“It was an honor for Kaliii to be invited by BMI to perform at such a prestigious event commemorating 50 years of Hip-Hop,” said Kaliii’s manager, Chanté Knox. “Thank you, BMI,” added Kaliii, “for trusting me to perform! I really enjoyed myself and look forward to our continued work in the future.”

Paying tribute to Hip-Hop’s American roots and its influence on global culture, the party honoured the genre’s creative talents past and present, while raising funds for the Universal Hip-Hop Museum. This is grounded by Stella’s own love for and heritage in music, and she was thrilled to learn of the 112 Greene Street space’s heritage when she chose it as her New York City flagship in 2011.



Greene St. Recording was an iconic Hip-Hop studio from the early 1970s through its closure in 2001, with legendary acts such as Run-DMC, LL Cool J, The Black Eyed Peas, Beastie Boys, Mos Def and more having recorded there. Imagery and vintage vinyl records honoring its storied history were displayed in the boutique. Guests enjoyed specialty cocktails and champagne provided by Moët Hennessy.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999961853027344}",neutral,0.9999961853027344,0
LVMH-Backed Luxury Watch Site Hodinkee Cuts a Fifth of Jobs - The Business of Fashion,"Tue, 05 Sep 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzb2ZmYXNoaW9uLmNvbS9uZXdzL2x1eHVyeS9sdm1oLWJhY2tlZC1sdXh1cnktd2F0Y2gtc2l0ZS1ob2RpbmtlZS1jdXRzLWEtZmlmdGgtb2Ytam9icy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Hodinkee, an online watch retailer and news site backed by Bernard Arnault’s LVMH Luxury Ventures, is cutting almost 20 percent of its staff as prices for pre-owned timepieces slump.

The company has eliminated about two dozen positions, according to people familiar with the matter.

Hodinkee, which also counts musician John Mayer and Superbowl winning quarterback Tom Brady as investors, acquired watch dealer Crown & Caliber in 2021 during a frenzied surge in prices for used luxury timepieces. The loss-making business has weighed on Hodinkee, which was profitable before the deal, said the people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.

Hodinkee confirmed it’s reducing staff in operations, technology and photography as part of the integration of Crown & Caliber, without confirming numbers.

“We have restructured areas of the business that were either duplicative, redundant or inefficient,” chief executive officer Jeffery Fowler said by email. Hodinkee will continue investing in its business for growth, he added.

The purchase of Crown & Caliber, which sells used Rolex and other top brands, boosted Hodinkee’s annual revenue above $100 million.

Founded in 2008 by former UBS analyst Benjamin Clymer, Hodinkee is among the most important online sources for watch information and content, particularly for the US market. The country is now the top destination for Swiss watch exports after overtaking China in 2021.

Online luxury watch trading site Chrono24 GmbH cut about 13 percent of its workforce in January.

In addition to selling new and used watches and producing limited edition collaborations with top brands, Hodinkee also sells watch insurance products and provides bespoke services for high-net-worth collectors.

Other Hodinkee investors include The Chernin Group LLC and True Venture Management LLC.

Prices for many high-end watches on the secondary market — including Rolex, Patek Philippe and Audemars Piguet models — have been falling for more than a year after surging during the pandemic.

The Bloomberg Subdial Watch Index, which tracks prices for the 50 most-traded watches by value, has dropped 12 percent in the past year.

“While the pre-owned market has been in transition since April of 2022, we’ve seen pre-owned watch prices remain stable for several quarters now, with the most popular references still commanding a premium above pre-Covid prices,” Fowler said.

Ozempic maker overtakes LVMH as Europe's most valuable company - New York Post,"Fri, 01 Sep 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vbnlwb3N0LmNvbS8yMDIzLzA5LzAxL296ZW1waWMtbWFrZXItb3ZlcnRvb2stbHZtaC1hcy1ldXJvcGVzLW1vc3QtdmFsdWFibGUtY29tcGFueS_SAV9odHRwczovL255cG9zdC5jb20vMjAyMy8wOS8wMS9vemVtcGljLW1ha2VyLW92ZXJ0b29rLWx2bWgtYXMtZXVyb3Blcy1tb3N0LXZhbHVhYmxlLWNvbXBhbnkvYW1wLw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The pharma giant behind popular weight loss drugs Ozempic and Wegovy assumed the top spot as Europe’s most valuable company on Friday, overtaking French luxury empire LVMH, according to a report.

Novo Nordisk, the Danish multinational company, saw its market capitalization surge to $424.7 billion during Friday trading in London, beating out the luxury retail conglomerate owned by the family of Bernard Arnault.

LVMH, which has been Europe’s most valuable company for two-and-a-half years, had a market capitalization of $420.1 billion, according to Refinitiv data cited by the Reuters news agency.

Novo’s market capitalization also factored in unlisted shares that cannot be bought on any stock exchange.

In February 2021, LVMH, whose brands include Louis Vuitton, Dior, Sephora, and Dom Pérignon, dethroned Nestle, the Swiss food and drink conglomerate, to become Europe’s most valuable company.

Novo’s share price has roughly tripled in the past three years while LVMH’s has doubled.

The Danish firm’s shares have been up by some 17% since it announced last month that a large study had shown Wegovy also had a clear cardiovascular benefit, boosting the company’s hopes of moving beyond its image as a lifestyle drug.

Sales of Ozempic, a diabetes drug that doctors have been increasingly prescribing off-label to treat obesity as well as heart failure, have exploded, generating $3.2 billion in the second quarter — up from $2.1 billion in the same period last year.

Wegovy and Saxenda, Novo drugs that have been approved to treat obesity, more than tripled their combined sales to $1.6 billion in the second quarter.

Other pharmaceutical players are looking to capitalize on the anti-obesity craze.

Eli Lilly’s diabetes drug Mounjaro generated $980 million in sales for the second quarter — up 72% from the first quarter of this year.

Lilly’s shareholders have seen a handsome return on their investment. In the last year, Lilly’s stock has soared by more than 80%.

LVMH reported a drop in sales for the second quarter — an indication that spending on luxury retail goods among inflation-saddled Americans was on a downward keel.

Concerns about China’s weakening economy have also hurt investor sentiment towards LVMH.

Arnault and his family still boast the second-largest fortune in the world. They have a net worth valued by Bloomberg Billionaires Index at $186 billion.

Who Needs the Roys?

That leaves some pretty big shoes to fill when Arnault inevitably retires (the mandatory retirement age for the LVMH chief executive and chairman is 80; Arnault is currently 74).

Thankfully, he’s been training his children to take over the luxury-goods conglomerate, as has previously been reported. Now Arnault and his kids are spilling the—limited—details on how succession might play out. For the first time, in an interview with The New York Times, the Arnault family spoke on the record with an international newspaper. And they want to make clear that their family dynamic is nothing like a rather volatile one portrayed on TV: that of the Roy family on Succession.

“The best person inside the family or outside the family should be one day my successor,” Arnault told the Times. “But it’s not something that I hope is a duel for the near future.”

Arnault’s five children all hold cushy roles within the LVMH empire: Delphine is chairman and CEO of Christian Dior; Antoine is the head of communications and image for LVMH; Alexandre is executive vice president of product and communications at Tiffany & Co.; Frédéric is CEO of Tag Heuer; and Jean is the watch director for Louis Vuitton. But Succession fans hoping the kids are ready to spar in a way similar to Shiv, Kendall, and Roman are in for some disappointment.

The Arnault children share a group chat in which they send each other baby pictures. At Alexandre’s wedding, the other three boys served as groomsmen. And they all get together with Arnault at least once a month for lunch on the top floor of the LVMH headquarters in Paris, where they talk business.

“I know it’s disappointing for a lot of people,” Antoine told The New York Times, “but we actually get on well.”

While the handing over of the LVMH reins may not play out in a way fit for television, it’s still possible that someone other than an Arnault kid ends up taking over. And if that’s the way it has to be, they’re okay with that, too, the Times noted. “There’s the risk that none of us is able to run the business as well as he has,” Alexandre said.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.999983549118042}",neutral,0.999983549118042,0

By the end of the trading day, Novo had cemented its position ahead of LVMH with a market capitalization of $428 billion, compared to the luxury conglomerate’s $419 billion.

The pharma giant briefly passed LVMH in market cap on Friday, but slipped lower by the end of the trading day.

Wegovy’s release was highly anticipated in the U.K., where obesity rates are the highest in Europe. Britain will be the drug’s fifth market, and follows a £40 million ($50 million) government-sanctioned pilot program that kicked off in June.

At the time, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said that obesity was a “huge pressure on the NHS” and that Wegovy could be a “game-changer.”

Novo’s growth

The Danish pharma giant is a familiar name when it comes to diabetes treatment, as the company makes close to 50% of the world’s insulin. But it catapulted to fame when Ozempic and Wegovy became widely talked about on social media. It also helped that among the company’s A-list users was Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who tweeted about using Wegovy to look “ripped.”

Novo’s blockbuster drugs Ozempic and Wegovy contain the same active chemical, which reduces blood sugar and helps curb appetite, leading to weight loss. A recent study published by the company found that Wegovy also cut the risk of heart attack and stroke by 20%, adding to the success of the drug.

Since the end of 2020, the company’s stock has more than tripled as the company expands its footprint around the world, beating other European majors like Nestle along the way.

The company said in August that its drugs catering to weight loss and diabetes had helped 39 million people globally in just the first half of 2023. For the same period, the sale of obesity care treatments skyrocketed 157%, the company reported last month.

“We are serving more patients than ever before,” Novo CEO Lars Fruergaard Jørgensen said in a statement following the earnings release. The company raised its full-year sales and earnings target amid booming demand.

Supply crunch clashes with expansion

The drug will be available by prescription via NHS as well as in the private market for around a fifth of the prices that Wegovy sells for in the U.S., according to Bloomberg. Britain prices the drug at between £199 ($251) and £299 ($377) a month, while America’s prices are higher than any other market at over $1,300 a month.

Although Wegovy’s Britain release is being done in a “limited and controlled manner,” the deluge in seekers for the buzzy weight loss drug clashes with the company’s supply shortage.

Due to pent-up demand, the number of patients for the weight loss drug is expected to soar in the U.K. Novo has already implemented supply restrictions on some doses of the drug, and said it expects constraints to remain in a “number of products and geographies” during its Q2 earnings call last month.

The NHS told Fortune that it has enough supply to prescribe 50,000 patients in England.

“Despite global supply constraints, NHS England is taking action to begin implementing NICE [National Institude of Health and Care Excellence] guidance for weight management, while at the same time working to restore supplies of this class of drug for people with type 2 diabetes,” an NHS spokesperson said in a statement.

Private retailers, like Superdrug, already have a 20,000-person-long wait list for Wegovy.

Novo didn’t immediately return Fortune’s request for comment.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9966509938240051}",positive,0.9966509938240051,1
‘Saint-Tropez has become LVMH Ville’: locals slam super-rich ‘takeover’ - The Guardian,"Fri, 29 Sep 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy8yMDIzL3NlcC8yOS9zYWludC10cm9wZXotc3VwZXItcmljaC1sdm1oLXRha2VvdmVyLWJpbGxpb25haXJlc9IBY2h0dHBzOi8vYW1wLnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy8yMDIzL3NlcC8yOS9zYWludC10cm9wZXotc3VwZXItcmljaC1sdm1oLXRha2VvdmVyLWJpbGxpb25haXJlcw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"It’s probably the world’s only fishing village where it’s easier to buy a €25,000 “mini” Celine handbag, a €4,000 Christian Dior trench or a €2,000 Rimowa suitcase than it is to pick up a rod and tackle.

Ever since Brigitte Bardot started cavorting on its beaches in the 1950s, Saint-Tropez has been better known as a place to catch a glimpse of a celebrity than a fresh sea bass. But now longsuffering locals are warning that the annual influx of the global super-rich is becoming too much – even for them.

“Independent restaurants, hotels and cafes are all being bought by luxury groups,” says Vérane Guérin, a municipal councillor. “It’s becoming not Saint-Tropez, but LVMH Ville.”

LVMH, the luxury goods company founded and run by Europe’s richest person, Bernard Arnault, owns the town’s Celine, Dior and Rimowa stores as well outlets for several of its other brands, including Fendi and Loewe.

The conglomerate, whose official name is LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, also owns two of the town’s fanciest hotels: the Cheval Blanc and the White 1921.

There are LVMH restaurants serving its Moët & Chandon champagne, a Dior cafe, and even “LV by the Pool” – a beach club with branded sun loungers and parasols.

Guérin, who unsuccessfully stood as an independent to become the mayor of Saint-Tropez at the last election, said that if she had won the vote she would have done more to prevent the super-rich “takeover” of the town. “The feel of Saint-Tropez is changing so rapidly; no more is it for artists and artisans,” she says.

The number of super-rich people – including Arnault, the world’s second-wealthiest person after Elon Musk – descending on the Côte d‘Azur resort has sent property prices soaring, forcing many local people to move away permanently.

“People who have been here for generations are having to move miles inland, and drive back to work. The houses, the flats, the apartments – it has all been taken,” says Guerin. “These are people who lived here all year round, while the rich people only come for weeks in the summer. In the winter there are so few people that it is hard for the grocery shops to keep going.”

A recent surge in big names with big money buying homes or holidaying with wealthy friends – Drake, Uma Thurman, Diplo and Zac Efron were all spotted partying there this summer – has led to such a rapid change of demographics of the town of just over 4,000 people that academics say that “before long there will be nothing but billionaires”.

“There have always been rich people here,” says Géraldine, who works in a Saint-Tropez public library, tucked away near the Dior cafe that charges €12 (£10.30) for an ice tea and the White 1921 hotel, where rooms start at €600 a night. “But now there are so many of them, and everything is so ‘luxe’ it makes you want to throw up.

“Brigitte Bardot and the other film stars that followed her were still part of the community, and they would play pétanque on Place des Lices [the central square],” Géraldine says. “But now, the billionaires, they don’t interact with us, they just want to show off to their friends and stay in their bunkers on ‘Les Parcs’ or on their superyachts. They don’t want to be real Tropéziennes.”

Les Parcs de Saint Tropez is a gated community on a hill overlooking the old town from the east so as to provide picture perfect sunsets. Homeowners include Arnault, as well as another billionaire, Vincent Bolloré, who owns a third of the media group Vivendi among a vast portfolio of assets, François-Henri Pinault, the founder of Kering, the luxury company that owns Gucci, Balenciaga and Bottega Veneta, Francis Holder, who owns most of the macaron brand Ladurée as well as the Paul bakery chain, and the late Mohamed Al Fayed.

When a Guardian reporter attempted to cycle up Chemin de la Fontaine-du-Pin, they were met by three security guards about 50 metres before reaching the gatehouse that bars the way to the community. The almost 100 security cameras that monitor the estate had apparently alerted them to a “suspicious presence”.

Property prices there are some of the highest in the world, according to the estate agents Knight Frank and Sotheby’s. While the estate has always been expensive, the average price of its almost 200 homes has risen from about €5m a decade ago to more than €13m today, though they rarely change hands.

A water’s-edge villa called Octopussy, after the 1983 Bond film, was recently advertised for offers in excess of €40m. The nine-bedroom house – which can be accessed by boat or helicopter – is now available to rent for €71,400 a night.

“The prices are frankly ridiculous,” says Guérin. “They’re now so high that even people we would have previously considered to be rich can’t buy in the best locations. The world’s 0.1% have bought everything, and it’s pushed up prices of everything.”

Henley & Partners, a London-based firm that advises the super-rich on buying residence and citizenship abroad while spending large chunks of their lives in the UK, Europe and America, recently singled out Saint-Tropez as a world hotspot for the super-rich to buy property but not live.

Its research found that more than 100 people who each had more than $100m in disposable income visited second homes in Saint-Tropez last year, but only 11 of them lived there all year.

Some of the restaurants in Saint-Tropez have been accused of reserving space only for those that they expect – from a database of previous visits – to be big spenders and big tippers. A hospitality worker told the Nice-Matin newspaper: “It’s basically: are you likely to splash the cash, or are you small fry?”

The mayor, Sylvie Siri, who declined to speak to the Guardian, told the Nice-Matin that the “despicable practices” were “extremely shocking to me because they are unfortunately true”.

“These practices are odious for the resort, and therefore for our clientele, but also for local people. We have already been chased out of our flats, and pretty soon we’ll be chased out of our restaurants too, unable to eat out.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999759197235107}",neutral,0.9999759197235107,0
"A McQueen Bombshell, an LVMH Mystery & Fashion Week Gossip - Puck","Mon, 11 Sep 2023 23:30:11 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vcHVjay5uZXdzL25ld3NsZXR0ZXJfY29udGVudC9hLW1jcXVlZW4tYm9tYnNoZWxsLWFuLWx2bWgtbXlzdGVyeS1mYXNoaW9uLXdlZWstZ29zc2lwL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Hi, and welcome back to another New York Fashion Week edition of Line Sheet. I gotta say, I’m downright overwhelmed, and very flattered, by all the nice things you’ve said to my face at the shows, at dinner, on the street. Behind my back, who knows! (But I will find out!) I have witnessed so much these past few days—from the elaborate PDA of Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sanchez (front row at Staud), to the snoozeist PETA fashion show crash of all time. (Really, you’re gonna go after Coach for using recycled leather? Nobody cares.) Today, along with fun intel and observations, I’ve got some juicy tidbits from the bowels of the human resources department. With that said, I could have written five times what I’ve put forth to you here, so if I’m missing something good, hit reply. I’ll have another dispatch from the front lines on Thursday, where I’ll be covering Michael Kors, Tory Burch, and the best of the rest. Mentioned in this issue: Sarah Burton, Bernard Arnault, Ozempic, Alexandre Arnault, Anish Melwani, inflation, Chioma Nnadi, François-Henri Pinault, Zendaya, The Pool Room, Zoë Kravitz, Malala Yousafzai, IMG, Oprah Winfrey, Raf Simons, J. Lo, Peter Do, Voss water, Ralph Rucci, Italo Zucchelli, Kazumi Yanai, Cate Holstein, Nina Khosla, Andy Weissman, Chris Burch, The Plaza, Sarah Staudinger, and many more. Question of the week: Why is Sarah Burton leaving McQueen? As you’ve likely heard by now, the one-time right hand to Lee Alexander McQueen is leaving the brand 13 years after she stepped into the creative director role when he died, and 26 years after she joined the business. September’s show in Paris will be her last. What happened? Well, when you’ve been doing a job for nearly 30 years, maybe it’s time to take a break. (See Fabio Zambernardi and Prada .) From what I know, McQueen is far from a blockbuster—leather goods have never been as strong as any brand of that level would like—but it has performed well under Burton. Although I did hear her departure was sudden. As for who might be in the running to succeed her, my educated guess is that they haven’t decided yet. It’s a tremendous responsibility, given the weight of McQueen’s work in the fashion canon, his untimely death by suicide, and the careful work Burton did to burnish his legacy. Peter Copping , currently in the couture studio at Balenciaga, could be a choice. But I’m just thinking out loud here.

As you’ve likely heard by now, the one-time right hand to is leaving the brand 13 years after she stepped into the creative director role when he died, and 26 years after she joined the business. September’s show in Paris will be her last. Second question of the week : It’s Chioma , right? Right. Right! Everyone is saying that London-native Nnadi, currently the editor of Vogue.com, will be named “head of editorial content” for the international markets any day now, and that British Vogue deputy editor Sarah Harris , the other top candidate—who also happens to currently be on maternity leave—bowed out of the running to (sort of) replace Edward Enninful at some point or another. Everyone here is great, of course, but this is the latest sign of the great downward trend of print media wherein a legendary or quasi-legendary (or just overpaid) person leaves for greater economic pastures only to be replaced by a much more junior successor while everyone smiles and pretends not to notice.

: It’s , right? Right. Right! Everyone is saying that London-native Nnadi, currently the editor of Vogue.com, will be named “head of editorial content” for the international markets any day now, and that British deputy editor , the other top candidate—who also happens to currently be on maternity leave—bowed out of the at some point or another. Everyone here is great, of course, but this is the latest sign of the great downward trend of print media wherein a legendary or quasi-legendary (or just overpaid) person leaves for greater economic pastures only to be replaced by a much more junior successor while everyone smiles and pretends not to notice. Third question: Ozempic or anorexic? Who’s on it, who’s not, who knows? All I’m sure of is that skinny is in, and everyone is desperate to out everyone else. Someone even asked me if my husband was taking “the shot” because of a photo I posted recently on Instagram where I suppose he looked thinner than usual. Please, this man’s business is called The New Consumer : if he was anywhere near semaglutide, he’d be documenting it in real time. (We’re still about willpower, or lack thereof, in this household. At least until there’s a Type 2 diagnosis.) Anyway, I’m not going to expose anyone’s prescribed drug use in this safe space, but if you are on Ozempic and you’re a fashion writer, you should do something on it.

LVMH H.R.: A New Line Sheet Public Service Last week, I heard from the most reliable of well-placed sources that Anish Melwani, chairman and C.E.O. of LVMH in North America, was potentially on his way out for a new opportunity, and was heading to Paris imminently—possibly to break the news, negotiate, get a counter, etcetera. “I know for a fact that he has another job,” this person said. But when I contacted LVMH for comment, several spokespeople denied that there was any truth to the information, calling it “fake news.” (Prior to joining LVMH in 2016, Melwani was at McKinsey for 16 years, where Alexandre Arnault was once his intern.) Look, this person wasn’t lying about what they were told. “Perhaps he’ll use that trip to resign or negotiate a new role within the group,” they added. I followed up with some people in the world of executive recruiting, who had also heard that Melwani was interviewing. (Look, that isn’t a crime: The Spencer Stuarts and Russell Reynolds of the world make their money by constantly engaging top executives with other opportunities.) Anyway, their hunch was Richemont. And remember, even if Melwani were to leave LVMH, there’s a chance he has a non-compete agreement as long as two years (though this is why lawyers were created). In this case, I believe it’s just a matter of information being shared with me way, way before it’s typically leaked to the press, if it’s disseminated at all. Whatever the real deal, it’s worth keeping an eye on movement within the company. Melwani’s been around for a time of tremendous growth for LVMH in the U.S.—the Covid bump (a combination of boredom and stimulus checks), the ginormous acquisition of Tiffany, etcetera. While regional C.E.O.s of individual brands report into Paris, not to him, he’s involved in a bunch of different things, and played an integral role in the plan to build a Cheval Blanc hotel on Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills, which got derailed by shortsighted yokels. It’s also a transitional moment for the company. On Friday, Bloomberg reported that LVMH Chairman and C.E.O. Bernard Arnault bought $230 million worth of shares of the company as the stock continues to dip, down 14 percent since July on weaker performances both in the U.S. and China. (The industry thought that as American consumers slowed their roll, China would pick up the slack. Hasn’t happened.) The buyback, which happened a few days after the earnings report, is a message to the market that they’re getting a deal right now on LVMH stock. Given the trajectory of the industry over the past two decades, that’s probably true, but there’s also no denying this is going to be a tricky time for an industry that relies on consumers’ insatiable appetite for spending money. I’m sure you’ve also read that Novo Nordisk, which makes hunger-killer Ozempic, has overtaken LVMH as the largest company in Europe. Don’t forget, it can help curb other addictions, too… like shopping. Pinault’s Hollywood There’s plenty of speculation going around about who from the François-Henri Pinault camp will end up at CAA. I heard whispers that Susan Chokachi, the Gucci veteran who recently left the company, may be headed there, but that appears to be wishful thinking. Here’s why I think this rumor is going around: Chokachi is far from an unknown quantity in Los Angeles, where she’s been based for years, overseeing everything from Gucci’s sponsorship of the LACMA gala to celebrity deals. She’s already embedded in the Hollywood machine. But alas, I hear it’s not happening. Who knows what the future holds? As for what people are saying about the tie up: Some are convinced that LVMH and other major players are going to penalize CAA moving forward. Are they going to want to give a CAA client money if it means essentially dropping a few pennies in Pinault’s piggy bank? As I mentioned in my Puck partner Matt Belloni’s newsletter last week, I asked some people in Paris—people who control the budgets for advertising at luxury brands—about the acquisition. Interestingly, they sort of brushed it off with a so-what attitude. Underneath, though, it is viewed by some as an overt power play, which is much more American than French. However, I’m still adamant that everyone is going to want to play nice. There are no exclusivity terms in the deal, and it’s in nobody’s best interest to box anyone out. If a CAA client is the best fit for an LVMH brand (Zendaya, for instance, is currently signed with Louis Vuitton), then LVMH is going to do what is going to make them the most money. I’m sure there will be plenty to observe at Kering’s Caring for Women dinner on Tuesday night at the Pool Room. Co-chairs Zoë Kravitz, Olivia Wilde, and Salma Hayek (Pinault’s wife) are all represented by CAA, while Malala Yousafzai and Oprah Winfrey are with UTA and WME, respectively. September Issues My latest notes on the romp through fashion’s busiest week—the moguls, financiers, canoodling billionaires, shows, designers, and theater of it all. LAUREN SHERMAN At the Coach dinner on Thursday night at the New York Public Library, a friend asked me if I thought that brands would still be staging fashion shows in 30 years. Yes, I said, if the world doesn’t blow up before that: Fashion always finds an excuse. His question, though, was reasonable. We all know runway shows are no longer a tool of the trade. Coach’s sales are now something like 90 percent direct: buyers don’t buy it, editors are obliged to cover the brand largely because it’s a name people know and because it’s an advertiser. For Coach, the biggest brand in the Tapestry portfolio, the show—a display of oversized leather blazers and pointy-toe jelly flats embossed all over with Cs, with J.Lo in the front row—is a customer acquisition cost. Could they do it another way? Perhaps. But it’s part of the formula devised by creative director Stuart Vevers, who moved to the U.S. 10 years ago for the job. He’s a well-liked, commercially-minded leader, who has managed, whether you’ve taken to it or not, to give Coach an identity that rises above off-price and discounting strategies that drive the business. I wouldn’t be surprised if Tapestry uses Coach as the template for each of the brands in its growing portfolio, which is set to include Michael Kors, Versace, and Jimmy Choo, once the acquisition of Capri is completed by the end of the year. Is that a good idea? Seems very private equity, and there’s plenty of skepticism around it. Of course, the skeptics were out at Helmut Lang, too. Now designed by young talent Peter Do, misalignments abound at this company. Looking around as I pounded a bottle of Voss water before the show, the audience told me everything I needed to know. Regarded designers Ralph Rucci and Italo Zucchelli (he of Calvin Klein menswear fame) came out to support Do, but the Seventh Avenue garmentos were there, too, not to mention Kazumi Yanai, the Fast Retailing heir. The Uniqlo owner bought Helmut Lang in 2006, and has never quite known what to do with it, other than debate selling it. Where does it belong? Dormant, I’d argue. Helmut Lang is ground zero for so much of today’s fashion, and the particulars of Lang’s exit from the industry—at his peak of influence, to pursue fine art—means its perfection is preserved in a way that normally doesn’t happen. There is virtually nothing Do, who started working on the collection four months ago, could have done to have succeeded. Especially since Raf Simons’ debut at Calvin Klein in February 2017 was such a sharp homage. (Funny, since Klein was accused of copying Lang late in his career.) Do seemed to be looking at Lang directly, but also at Simons’ interpretation. I thought the pants were good, but it just wasn’t enough. I like Peter: I think he’s talented and thoughtful, and he’s young. Plus, every creative choice someone like him makes is so scrutinized now. But my question for a while has been, is his work limited by being in New York, or is he limited by his capabilities? He shows his namesake collection in Paris in two weeks. It may give us a better indication. Commercially, this season of Helmut Lang may sell better than it ever has for Fast Retailing. Walking out of the show, I asked a store owner if she planned on buying the collection, and she seemed keen on the blazers and jeans, which are reasonably priced. (Reasonable, in this case, means between $300 and $600.) And then, a shop-and-copy master (who worked for a big specialty retailer for decades and still consults for many of them) sent me a diatribe about how old Helmut is informing the look on the street right now. He really liked Do’s take, and seemed to like Proenza Schouler’s even more. “Art and Commerce”: (Mainly Commerce) Those two! Backstage at Proenza, designers Jack McCollough and Lazaro Hernandez said that they don’t do well with the “scrum” interview, where journalists ask designers questions like, “What’s your inspiration?” or “What fabric did you use on that dress?” I’d say they’re better at it than most (low bar on both sides). Really, though, the clothes did all the requisite talking this season. It was a good looking, unfussy collection of high V-neck sweaters, low-slung pants, and basketweave gowns. (An ultra polished, super slick version of what the Shopping Newsletter Ladies are already wearing, like sheer red tights, as one of them pointed out.) Their soundbite was about “art and commerce,” and these designers, maybe more than any in New York, have struggled with balancing the two. I haven’t checked in on their business since I did a big story on their ups and downs in February 2022, but it feels like they’ve regained a good amount of confidence during the past two years. I hope that’s reflected in the numbers. Proenza’s current investor is Mudrick Capital, a hedge fund, so they’ll certainly be looking for an exit at some point soon. But this is par for the course: Proenza already went through the private equity ringer, years ago. Now, it’s Khaite’s turn. The Cate Holstein-designed label is now under the watch of Stripes, one of the few investment firms that regularly takes bets on fashion. Backstage at that show, I asked Holstein how the money has empowered her: I expected her to mention supply chain upgrades or more freedom with show budgets. (The Park Avenue Armory staging wasn’t extravagant, but it definitely felt like an upgrade from previous seasons.) Instead, she reminded me that she doesn’t have to be the C.E.O. anymore. (That title goes to Brigitte Kleine, who helped build Tory Burch before joining Stripes as an operating partner in 2016.) It’s interesting to see who likes Khaite in fashion circles and who doesn’t. Many fashion journalists and editors feel a distance from it. I asked a friend if he had any inkling as to why. He said, They hate success. (Another guess: they don’t understand money.) To understand Khaite, you’ve got to view it like a merchant. (I liked the pin-tucked gazar dresses; they reminded me of this Marc Jacobs look from his Spring 1998 collection.) Holstein is very much in touch with what women with money want to wear. When I saw Yael Aflalo, founder of Reformation—another Stripes investment, which turned out very well for everyone involved—sitting front row at the show, I thought, Yep, that’s right. Aflalo, who made a fortune with the backing and support of Stripes, is now Holstein’s target audience. More Commerce… For years, investors have backed away from fashion because it’s such a tough business to get right. But now the power players are recognizing just how lucrative luxury can be, thanks to the success of LVMH and Kering, and I suspect we’re going to see an influx of new money flowing into the space. One person recently likened LVMH to me as a private equity firm with 40 percent carry rather than 20 percent carry. Not a bad deal. At Fforme, I was introduced to Union Square Ventures’ Andy Weissman, who was there to support Nina Khosla, daughter of Vinod Khosla (of Silicon Valley’s Khosla Ventures) and co-founder of the Paul Helbers-designed label. Nina Khosla just hired Joey Laurenti to be the brand’s C.E.O. What a choice, given that Laurenti was the co-founder and C.E.O. of Sies Marjan, another label designed by an incredibly talented European and backed by wealth made far away from the industry. (In that case, Nancy Marks, wife of the famous investor Howard Marks.) As you may remember, Sies Marjan ceased operations during the pandemic—for the usual reasons—and I’m sure Laurenti learned plenty from that experience that he will apply to this. I could also see Nancy Marks, famously a client of Ralph Rucci’s before buying his label, firing him, and re-imagining it under Sander Lak as Sies Marjan, being a Fforme client. The Paris-based Helbers, whose résumé includes Louis Vuitton and The Row, is a world-class designer, and there is a whiff of Rucci in the silhouettes he clearly puts a lot of work into defining. The question, of course, is whether the world needs more sculptural clothes made with very expensive materials. If Fforme can become the American version of Arts & Sciences (the Japanese label every minimalist adores) then I think it has a fighting chance to differentiate. The styling of those clothes needs work, though, in order to communicate how special they are. Ari, Bezos & Sanchez Chris Burch is one of the few fashion financiers who made his fortune there, and he’s still in it. Last night at Staud, which he backs, designer Sarah Staudinger staged a throwback to ’90s runway shows, constructing an elevated runway in the Grand Ballroom at the Plaza Hotel. (No one really does elevated runways anymore, other than Sergio Hudson, who showed earlier in the evening. Everyone just walks on the ground now.) Styled by Danielle Goldberg, whose sister, Arielle Charnas, was in the audience—and has been out and about all week—it was an obvious homage to Isaac Mizrahi and that candy-colored ball gown look he helped make so famous, with the models smiling and vogue-ing in an unserious way. While Staud is on the precipice of becoming a huge-ass business (close to $100 million in annual sales), this was all about the show, especially the front row, populated with friends of Staudinger and her husband, WME C.E.O. Ari Emmanuel. There was no Larry David sighting this time, but Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sanchez were there, seated front and center, not far from Jeffrey Deitch and Annabelle Dexter Jones, Rachel Sennott, Jeremy O’Harris, Justin Bartha (!), and company men like WME president Mark Shapiro. (Was he on social media duty or something? He seemed to be documenting every second of this show with his iPhone.) There were woots every time a model twirled. Front row curation is an essential element of what makes a good fashion show, and Staud’s assemblage was rivaled only by Area, who welcomed Mary J. Blige and her green exotic leather Hermès to the Williamsburg Savings Bank. There, it was much about what they were wearing as who they were; the Piotrek Panszczyk-designed label, known for its couture-inspired, intentionally outrageous creations, has a robust private client business, and made more than $10 million in revenue in 2022, according to a BoF report. It’s gala garb for progressives. On the runway, Panszczyk made the unexpected choices we expect from him, such as inserting fossil-like lacquered pieces into gowns and coats. (Show me one review of this show that won’t include a Flintstones reference.) I normally really admire his work, but this time it felt a little too unfinished and conceptually disorganized for me to totally get behind it. I can’t judge a show like Staud against Area or Proenza or Helmut Lang. But was it a satisfying experience? Absolutely. And will those ball gown skirts sell? Sure. Who else is making money this week? Mike Eckhaus and Zoe Latta designs have a ton of commercial potential, and they want people to see that they’re good at cutting clothes. So they staged this show not in a raw space in East Williamsburg or a schoolyard on the Lower East Side, but at a green-marbled office building in Midtown. Brilliant. Also, they’ve been doing great denim of the Helmut Lang variety for years. Calvin Klein, hire these two. What really works in American fashion is consistency. I’m usually pretty bored by Ulla Johnson’s shows, but on Sunday morning I couldn’t help feeling dazzled by her three-dimensional florals and dizzying zig-zag knits. (Made me think she’d be a great designer for Missoni, but that brand needs help, and she’s too smart to take on some impossible post like that.) Each season, nothing really changes, and yet she is good enough to keep people hooked. We talk a lot about “the next Ralph Lauren,” or that “there will never be another Ralph Lauren,” but in many ways, I don’t think anyone of her generation is as clear about their identity. And that brings me to the man himself, who showed in the Brooklyn Navy Yards on Friday night, in a venue constructed to mimic the RL Ranch in Colorado, with the models drowning in denim and gold and piles of jewel-toned jewels. I used to get all huffy about Ralph Lauren shows because they don’t budge one bit forward. Maybe I’ve softened, but I not only don’t care about that any more, I don’t think they should. Lauren is really like Lagerfeld of America, and his ideas hold up. The revolution will come when it’s time.

I’ve been waiting for that future to arrive, but I’ve never come across it in my daily life.

I’d recently bought the bag, and a little white card was tucked away in a pocket. On the piece of 100 per cent recycled fibre, it read: “This authentic Prada product’s certificate has been uploaded on Aura Blockchain Consortium’s platform to record and guarantee its integrity.”

Miu Miu’s parent company, Prada Group, is one of several major luxury houses investing in hi-tech ways to track their most coveted and most expensive products. Over the past year, brands including Loro Piana, Louis Vuitton and Maison Margiela have launched services built on the Aura Consortium’s blockchain that allow customers to verify that their item isn’t a knock-off.

The rise in counterfeit luxury bags

The hope is that tracking handbags, coats and diamond rings this way could be a game changer in the industry’s fight against the ballooning counterfeits market . As much as US$464 billion worth of counterfeit and pirated products change hands each year, accounting for 2.5 per cent of world trade, according to a 2019 estimate by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development.

Blockchain technology is just one of the weapons deployed by the sector in a years-long battle against fakes. Recent efforts include Richemont’s new platform for sharing information about lost or stolen watches and jewellery, and LVMH-owned Patou launching an AI-based verification system called Authentique Verify.

Giving customers a more reliable way to prove their products are real could help raise the appeal of originals, while making it harder to sell fakes on the second-hand market. And by making it easier for customers to pass on or resell their products, the technology could help prove the case that many of these highly priced items have some investment value

“A digital certificate of authenticity is a huge, huge problem solver,” says Stefano Rosso, chairman of the French fashion house Maison Margiela and chief executive officer of BVX, which are both part of OTB Group. “In parallel, it helps us market the product and track its origins.”

OTB is a member of the Aura Blockchain Consortium, which runs blockchain technology specifically for luxury brands. The consortium was founded in 2021 by LVMH, Prada Group and Richemont, and joined later by OTB and Mercedes-Benz. When customers look up one of the 600,000 OTB products registered, they don’t just do it on any random website; the brands control which goods are registered on the platform.

Deployment of blockchain

The concept of a blockchain – where transactions are recorded online, on a system run by many computer servers – first gained notoriety as the system underpinning such cryptocurrencies as bitcoin . Information on blockchains is hard to tamper with, which many believe makes them an ideal tool for complex record-keeping, such as tracking a product’s origin or supply chain. It helps solve a big problem in the online world – lack of trust – that some believe is transferable to products in the real world.

Other sectors have been toying with the technology for years, but have yet to implement any applications at scale. Wall Street, for instance, has been at the forefront of developing blockchain systems, but things have moved more slowly in a highly regulated environment with complex systems already in place. The consequences of an outage, say, in a system clearing equities trades would be quite different from a glitch in a system that tracks handbags. Some progress is still being made, but many projects announced years ago have yet to be implemented, while others have been scrapped.

Despite the billions of dollars invested, you’d be hard-pressed to find mainstream adoption of applications beyond cryptocurrencies . The deployment of blockchain across luxury goods will be a significant test of whether the technology has any utility at a scale beyond its original use case.

OTB’s service allows customers to tap their smartphone, for example, on a new pair of Maison Margiela Tabi shoes, which have NFC chips embedded in them. The chip instructs the phone to open a website with the product’s authenticity certificate, which is provided by the Aura Blockchain Consortium, and information about where the shoes were made (Italy).

Similarly, earlier this year, LVMH’s Loro Piana launched a service allowing customers to scan a QR code on labels of its high-end Gift of Kings garments to verify their authenticity – pretty important when buying one of its T-shirts, which can cost US$2,100. Customers can also register themselves as the garment’s owner and find information about its origins, down to the batch of fine merino wool used to make a T-shirt. (It’s very soft and comes from select sheep farms in Australia and New Zealand.)

“We believe that blockchain is a strong enabler to augment everything related to traceability, origin, authenticity from the beginning of the story starting at the raw material level,” Franck Le Moal, LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton’s group IT and technology director, said in an interview. “One day every product in the luxury industry will be able to benefit or be augmented by a digital product passport or certificate.”

Not everyone buys it

Some experts think it won’t. “I remain sceptical about the robustness or usefulness of blockchain solutions that attempt to bridge physical assets with the esoteric nature of blockchain networks,” says Colin Platt, who advises and consults companies on blockchain projects. “What happens if I pull that NFC chip out of the bags, make 10,000 copies and put them in 10,000 fake bags? Who owns the real bag?”

Applications built using the Aura Consortium’s technology use different layers of security including encrypted NFC chips, a spokesperson said. Platt also wonders what would happen if people sell the bags without registering the change of ownership on the system. “If you sell the bag to your friend and don’t update the blockchain, who owns the bag?” he says. “You or your friend?”

Prada Group integrated blockchain tracking into its new Fine Jewelry Eternal Gold line as it began work on building its sustainable supply chain for recycled gold that took more than one year to set up. The line made its debut in October and uses 100 per cent certified recycled gold and stones bought from suppliers who meet high standards on human rights, labour safety, environmental impact and business ethics.

Customers can use their phones to tap a jewellery’s card – including that accompanying a yellow gold chain necklace that costs US$31,800 – to pull up a certificate of authenticity, its carbon footprint and information on the material used.

This helps tell the brand’s sustainability story, as customers can verify that the materials use effectively meet the criteria that is advertised, Timothy Iwata, Prada Group’s managing director of fine and high jewellery, said in an interview.

A digital certificate and tamper-proof online records of who owns a product could make it easier for customers to pass items on to family and friends, executives say. Traditionally, certificates of authenticity have been plastic or paper cards with serial numbers, which can easily get lost or thrown out over the years. An inherited item might not come with that certificate, making it hard for the recipient to know whether the product is real. Instead, the ownership information is stored online.

In theory, digital certificates are supposed to assuage customers’ fear of coveting fake second-hand goods. Photo: Handout

The technology would also make it less risky for luxury houses to enter the second-hand market, says Daniela Ott, Aura Blockchain Consortium’s general secretary and a former chief operations officer at Kering’s luxury division. Companies could facilitate second-hand sales without worrying that they’re fencing fakes.

The technology can also help track the product’s sale and repair history, says Pierre-Nicolas Hurstel, CEO of Arianee, a start-up that works with consumer brands to build blockchain applications. Sitting at a cafe in Paris earlier this year, Hurstel showed information about the authenticity and history of his Panerai watch, which he’d scanned with his phone. It included the date of sale, warranty expiry and more.

Soon, Hurstel said, consumers could have a digital wallet on their phone containing certificates for all the valuable products they own. This could have an unexpected downside for luxury goods purveyors – a stronger second-hand market could make customers a bit too confident.

“This is not good for brands trying to avoid ubiquity and selling the promise of exclusivity,” says Luca Solca, a global luxury goods, senior research analyst at Alliance Bernstein.

The importance of authentication in designer handbags

After I pulled the card out from my Miu Miu bag, I thought, “OK, so now what?” The card had no instructions for how to gain access to the digital certificate to verify its registration on a blockchain network. Was my bag actually on the blockchain?

After several rounds of questioning, Aura Consortium’s and Prada’s press teams said I couldn’t yet certify the bag myself, but Prada Group could access the information through an NFC chip inserted in the item.

“By having the Aura label on their products, Prada Group is telling their customers that it has been injected onto the blockchain,” Prada said in a statement. “They have the comfort of knowing that it is authentic and has its immutable own identity.”

In other words, “trust us”, But my comfort levels were minimal. Especially after the bag’s strap broke in April and I took it to Miu Miu’s store on London’s New Bond Street for repairs. No one scanned it in front of me to verify its authenticity.

Instead, a salesperson looked up my details on a tablet. The store’s system pulled up the products I owned from the group. The bag and parts were collected, and shipped abroad for repairs.

A few weeks later, a representative messaged me on WhatsApp to tell me the bag had arrived. I collected it by giving them my name and the bag model – and that was that.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999333620071411}",neutral,0.9999333620071411,0

Novo Nordisk's stock price kept climbing in European trading on Tuesday morning after the Danish drugmaker dethroned French LVMH (Louis Vuitton Moet Hennessy) as the continent's most valuable company, based on its market capitalisation.

Its exact worth may vary as stock prices fluctuate, but Novo Nordisk's share price was hiking at 11:00 CET and valued at about DKK1,317 ($190), putting the company's total worth at about US$428 billion.

The company appears to be solidfying its place on the top spot after it briefly overtook LVMH on Friday last week.

Its market position means it's worth more than the GDP of its home country: Denmark's yearly GDP was a little more than $400 billion last year.

Meanwhile, the share price of LVMH, the world's biggest luxury retailer, keeps sliding as Tuesday's trading continues.

It stood at below €760 as of 11:00, an 1.8% reduction from its position at close on Monday (€772.60). LVMH's market value is a bit more than $410 billion.

Novo is meanwhile riding a wave of demand for its diabetes and weight-loss drugs Ozempic and Wegovy, which has sent its earnings and shares to record highs.

The increasing price further reflects investors' faith in the Danish drugmaker's decision to launch Wegovy in the UK on Monday.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.6861332654953003}",neutral,0.6861332654953003,0

LONDON, Sept 1 (Reuters) - Danish drugmaker Novo Nordisk briefly unseated LVMH LVMH.PA as Europe's most valuable listed company in intraday trading on Friday, ending the French luxury group's 2-1/2 year-long reign at the top.

LVMH, the world's biggest luxury retailer, has been hurt by growing concerns about the outlook for the Chinese economy.

Novo Nordisk meanwhile is riding a wave of sky-high demand for its highly effective diabetes and weight-loss drugs Ozempic and Wegovy, which has sent its earnings and shares to record highs.

At 0843 GMT, Novo Nordisk NOVOb.COhad a market capitalisation of $421 billion including unlisted stock, according to Refinitiv data and company disclosures of its share count.

The French-listed LVMH LVMH.PA had a market cap of $420.97 bln at the same time, having been Europe's biggest listed company since February 2021 when it knocked consumer goods group Nestle NESN.S off the top spot.

Novo Nordisk said earlier in August that a large study had shown that its highly effective obesity treatment also had a clear cardiovascular benefit, boosting the company's hopes of moving beyond its image as a lifestyle drug.

Its share price has roughly tripled in the past three years while LVMH, home to fashion labels Louis Vuitton and Dior, has doubled.

""Novo closing in on LVMH as Europe's biggest market cap stock is a reflection of Novo's recent product success while LVMH's recent trends have been more mixed,"" said Marcel Stotzel, co-portfolio manager of Fidelity European Fund and Fidelity European Trust.

Stotzel said both stocks remain key holdings in its funds.

Launched earlier this year and developed with Camera Nazionale della Moda Italiana and the Confartigianato association, the initiative is aimed at raising awareness around the importance of local craftsmanship and its preservation; attracting media attention to the cause, and offering financial aid to some of its exponents.

As reported, the project was first teased last year when LVMH hosted the Show Me event here and said that each year a different group brand will partner with the Italian fashion chamber to acknowledge three master artisans, starting with Fendi. On Tuesday, it was revealed that the sophomore edition will see the Roman fashion house passing the baton to Loro Piana.

In particular, the prize aims to celebrate artisans from all backgrounds across three categories: honoring experienced talents who have distinguished themselves for the quality of their work throughout their career; emerging artisans developing a promising and ongoing project; as well as professionals who have distinguished themselves with their capacity for innovation, preserving historical knowledge and skills while reinterpreting them in a modern way.

Selected from among nine finalists, the three winners in these categories were Fabio Ottaviano, Ilaria Soncini and the Verabuccia brand, respectively.

Specialized in the ancient art of cameo engraving, Ottaviano stood out for the variety of materials used in his craft, encompassing shell, mother-of-pearl and semiprecious stones. A milliner, Soncini founded her brand Ilariusss in 2013 with the desire to create new concepts of headgear while rediscovering this artisanal tradition.

Verbuccia was founded in 2020 by Francesca Nori and Fabrizio Moiani with the goal of rethinking and repurposing unused and inedible organic waste, turning food byproduct into resources for other sectors, like pineapple peel into a fabric for the fashion industry.

Each winner received a monetary prize of 10,000 euros to reinvest in their companies, as well as mentoring sessions with experts from Fendi.

The international jury to pick the winners included Toni Belloni, group managing director at LVMH; Fendi’s artistic director for accessories and menswear Silvia Venturini Fendi; Fendi’s chief executive officer Serge Brunschwig; Chantal Gaemperle, executive vice president human resources and synergies at LVMH; Francesco Pellerano, worldwide industrial director at Fendi, and Camera Nazionale della Moda Italiana’s president Carlo Capasa, among others.

“The name of the initiative itself speaks already of the nobility of these jobs,” said Belloni, before revealing the winners.

He underscored that the project embodies the coordinated effort of different players in the industry. “On one side there are small to medium-sized companies, often family-run, but with a unique know-how built over time, which makes them a competitive and peculiar asset of this country,” Belloni said. “On the other, there’s the role of a big company. We have access to customers from all over the world and we are devoted to constant innovation in order to offer them products that are desirable and make them dream.”

In Italy, LVMH employs more than 13,000 people — including 7,000 working in Métiers d’Excellence — counts 258 stores and 35 manufacturing sites. These add to an ecosystem of partners involving around 5,000 small to medium-sized companies and 200,000 people.

“We rely on this network of excellence,” Belloni continued. “Together we invent new shapes, assemble new materials and colors. And we are very demanding: everything needs to be done for yesterday, in high quantities, with an ever-increasing quality, while we require high environmental and social standards from our partners. This collaboration makes this ecosystem virtuous,” he added, stressing the importance of continuing to improve the efforts in order to scale them up and safeguard them.

“We hope that celebrating these crafts today would be of inspiration to attract many young people to these jobs that are so noble and creative,” Belloni concluded.

Brunschwig underscored the relevance of the project from a communication point of view, highlighting the need for publicly acknowledging these crafts.

“The emergency is to find a new generation of artisans. We need to motivate people. We as Fendi have a name [that can help] but for all those smaller businesses, motivating people can be a challenge,” the executive noted.

Fendi’s commitment to shine a light on and amplify craftsmanship is not new, as the brand has previously implemented the “Hand in Hand” initiative, for one. Launched in 2020, the project has the brand tapping local artisans to reinvent the iconic Baguette bag that Venturini Fendi designed in 1997, with activations and a dedicated tome further spotlighting the collaborations.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9988711476325989}",neutral,0.9988711476325989,0

Thelios, which aims to “restore the brand’s former glory”, said that Vuarnet’s expertise in mineral lenses would help the group expand its know-how in this area.

LVMH CEO Bernard Arnault Is Being Investigated for Money Laundering - Robb Report,"Fri, 29 Sep 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vcm9iYnJlcG9ydC5jb20vbGlmZXN0eWxlL2ZpbmFuY2UvYmVybmFyZC1hcm5hdWx0LXByb2JlZC1mb3ItcG9zc2libGUtbW9uZXktbGF1bmRlcmluZy0xMjM1MTIxOTQ4L9IBbWh0dHBzOi8vcm9iYnJlcG9ydC5jb20vbGlmZXN0eWxlL2ZpbmFuY2UvYmVybmFyZC1hcm5hdWx0LXByb2JlZC1mb3ItcG9zc2libGUtbW9uZXktbGF1bmRlcmluZy0xMjM1MTIxOTQ4L2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"French officials are keeping a close eye on the king of luxury.

On Friday, the Paris public prosecutor’s office revealed that Bernard Arnault’s dealings with Russian businessman Nikolai Sarkisov are being investigated for possible money laundering. The office’s research, started in 2022, is focused on transactions related to property at Cheval Blanc Courchevel, a luxury ski resort in the French Alps owned by Arnault’s LVMH conglomerate. Le Monde reported that Sarkisov purchased a series of properties there in 2018 via intermediary companies—but the end-buyer turns out to be Arnault, investigators say.

The French billionaire is alleged to have paid Sarkisov about $21.2 million to own the assets, while the Russian businessman raked in a profit of about $2 million from their deals. These transactions worked to mask the origin of the funds and the identity of the final buyer, or Arnault. A spokesperson for the CEO reportedly declined to comment to Bloomberg, while reps for Sarkisov couldn’t be reached. Despite this, sources familiar with Arnault claim the deals were legally completed.

Sarkisov is known to control the RESO-Garantia insurance company with his brother Sergey. According to French documents, he also became the Armenian consul to the city of Lyon in 2014—which is just about two hours away from Courchevel. Sarkisov reportedly left this post in 2019, a year after his property purchase at the ski resort, according to Forbes Russia. The publication later estimated his fortune in 2021 to stand at $850 million.

Arnault, the CEO of LVMH, is widely known and respected as a shrewd businessman and reigns as the undisputed king of the luxury world. Through his conglomerate, he’s acquired a variety of globally beloved brands, most recently the American jewelry purveyor Tiffany & Co. He’s currently the second-richest man in the world, behind Elon Musk, with an estimated net worth of $164 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999926090240479}",neutral,0.9999926090240479,0

Video Transcript

RACHELLE AKUFFO: All right, now for today's chart of the day. As consumers stay increasingly cost conscious, it's been a tough year for luxury stocks. Shares in French luxury giant LVMH, Cartier owner Richemont, and Gucci parent company Kering have all nearly erased their year-to-date gains, and that trend isn't expected to reverse anytime soon. Morgan Stanley lowering its organic growth and 2024 profit forecasts for most luxury companies, warning that demand could soften in both China and European markets.

Morgan Stanley's Edouard downgraded Richemont to equal weight while also lowering his price targets for LVMH and Kering as well. I mean, a lot of people are wondering when we were going to see some of that luxury market-- those luxury consumer spenders start to bite a little bit. Starting to see those cracks, especially when it comes to Chinese consumers, Akiko.

AKIKO FUJITA: Yeah, and that's going to be a tough headwind for these brands, especially going into what is typically the busiest shopping season of the year. But you're right to point out the headwinds that we have seen in China. You know, you go back to where we were at the first-- you know, the first half of the year.

The expectation that there would be a bounce back in that market which has been so important for these luxury brands, that just hasn't happened. And we've heard more and more that consumers are getting increasingly cautious. Yes, last year we were talking about the resilience of the luxury brand, but it feels like that has really started to trickle over into some of these names.

Story continues

RACHELLE AKUFFO: It's true. And even this idea of stealth wealth-- perhaps people not wanting to be quite as showy at the moment. We're seeing a lot of premium goods that don't necessarily have all the logos splashed across them, so perhaps some consumer trends to watch in terms of what they're spending on as well as them being more discretionary as well.

AKIKO FUJITA: I don't know, Rachelle. If you're spending that money, I think consumers still want that branding out there, but we'll see. I am not the one that's spending thousands of dollars on some of these products, so not one to speak.

RACHELLE AKUFFO: Same here. I might treat myself a little bit. For the most part, yeah, that's not what my budget is looking at.","{'label': 'Negative', 'score': 0.993384063243866}",negative,0.993384063243866,-1

Tessier, who had spent 12 years with the French luxury conglomerate, most recently as chief technology officer of LVMH Americas, has been named chief executive officer of DuPont Registry Group, a platform for the luxury automotive lifestyle. DuPont Registry’s portfolio includes Sotheby’s Motorsport, Canossa Events, Cavallino and FerrariChat, and the company hosts events and creates a community centered around the luxury car market.

“Antoine Tessier is a visionary leader with a passion for driving innovation and growth,” said Christian Clerc, chairman of DuPont Registry Group. “We’re excited to have him on board, as he has a proven track record for strong leadership skills and a collaborative approach.

Sanderson's CEO is bringing the secrets of the LVMH playbook to home - Business of Home,"Mon, 25 Sep 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vYnVzaW5lc3NvZmhvbWUuY29tL2FydGljbGVzL2xpc2EtbW9udGFndWUtc2FuZGVyc29uLWJvaC1wb2RjYXN00gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"“Most people actually gasp when they see it,” says Lisa Montague, the CEO of Sanderson Design Group, a family of fabric and wallcovering brands that includes Morris & Co, Zoffany and many others. “It” is not violent, avant garde or erotic—it’s Disney. This summer, Sanderson partnered with the house that Mickey built and released a line of patterns inspired by classic Disney animation: One Hundred and One Dalmatians, Dumbo, Snow White and Winnie the Pooh all feature. It’s an unexpected move for an extremely dignified 160-year-old British pattern company (hence the gasps), but that’s the point. Montague, who joined Sanderson fresh off a stint at the LVMH-owned Spanish luxury fashion brand Loewe, says that surprising collabs are one of the keys to revitalizing a heritage brand—a skill that has become her calling card.

“[I’ve found that] the notoriety of these beautiful heritage brands doesn’t compute to the size of the business,” she tells host Dennis Scully on the latest episode of The Business of Home Podcast. “You have to do something to dust it off and make it sing.”

Elsewhere on the show, Montague discusses secrets of the LVMH playbook, the home industry’s surprising lack of data and how AI will impact design.

Crucial insight: In America, it can be easy to obsess about the ups and downs of the market. The view from across the pond is a lot simpler. Montague sees the U.S. as an incredible market, and her number-one target for growth. “It’s inconceivable to me that the U.K. business for our brands is significantly greater than our U.S. business, which is a far greater market,” she says. “Why is a mystery to me.”

Key quote: “One of the things I really enjoy about the slightly slower pace of the home industry compared to fashion is that we have the luxury of developing product until it’s right to launch,” says Montague. “It’s not rushing, [as one might in fashion] because ‘if you’ve missed September you’ve missed the season.’ In home, it doesn’t matter which day a product launches, as long as it is the best version it can be.”

King Charles and Luxury Tycoon Bernard Arnault Are Meeting in Paris Today - Robb Report,"Thu, 21 Sep 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vcm9iYnJlcG9ydC5jb20vbGlmZXN0eWxlL25ld3Mva2luZy1jaGFybGVzLW1lZXRpbmctbHZtaC1jZW8tYmVybmFyZC1hcm5hdWx0LTEyMzQ5MDA1MDgv0gFjaHR0cHM6Ly9yb2JicmVwb3J0LmNvbS9saWZlc3R5bGUvbmV3cy9raW5nLWNoYXJsZXMtbWVldGluZy1sdm1oLWNlby1iZXJuYXJkLWFybmF1bHQtMTIzNDkwMDUwOC9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The king of the United Kingdom will be united with the king of luxury in Paris later today.

Charles III will meet with billionaire LVMH CEO Bernard Arnault on Thursday afternoon, according to Reuters. The one-on-one will take place at 5:30 p.m. (3:30 p.m. local time) at the British Embassy in Paris.

King Charles arrived in France on Wednesday for a three-day state visit designed to revive the two nations’ bilateral connection after the fallout from Brexit. The British monarch was welcomed by French President Emmanuel Macron with a lavish banquet at the Palace of Versailles on Wednesday night. More than 150 A-listers were seated at one 197-foot-long “king’s table” inside the spectacular 17th-century palace. The guest list included celebrities such as Mick Jagger and Hugh Grant, as well as entrepreneurs, athletes, and politicians. Arnault was also present, as reported by The Guardian.

The 74-year-old businessman has been the chairman and CEO of LVMH since 1989. Over the past three decades, he has expanded the French company into the successful luxury conglomerate that it is today. Arnault’s 75-brand empire is now valued at $500 billion, while his personal fortune totals roughly $170 billion. He is currently the second-richest person in the world, behind Elon Musk and his $241 billion. For comparison’s sake, the king’s personal net worth is estimated at $2.3 billion (£1.8 billion).

The monarch’s trip follows a Franco-British summit that was held earlier this year in a bid to mend relations between the two countries. Repairing the alliance between Britain and France may result in significant mutual benefits, from unlocking trade and investment to boosting economic growth. (Not that Arnault needs any help with that.) King Charles did his part to bolster the bond by making a poignant toast at the banquet.

“I would like, if you would allow me, to raise a toast to President and Madame Macron and to the French people, as well as to our entente cordiale—a sustainable alliance,” the royal said. “Whatever lies ahead, may it endure, faithful and constant, for centuries to come.”

Macron’s toast was equally positive.

“Despite Brexit and because our ties are so old, I know that we will continue to write together part of our continent’s history,” he added.

We’ll have to wait and see what the king of luxury has to say.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999496936798096}",neutral,0.9999496936798096,0
Bernard Arnault's 'Succession'-Like Drama: Who Will He Choose? - Entrepreneur,"Thu, 14 Sep 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVudHJlcHJlbmV1ci5jb20vYnVzaW5lc3MtbmV3cy9iZXJuYXJkLWFybmF1bHRzLXN1Y2Nlc3Npb24tbGlrZS1kcmFtYS13aG8td2lsbC1oZS80NTkwNDHSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The billionaire, once the richest man in the world, is keeping his options open.

Seventy-four-year-old Bernard Arnault, who currently serves as chairman and CEO of LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, is thinking about the future of the sprawling luxury goods company he's built.

Despite convincing the LVMH board to raise the mandatory retirement age for the chairman and chief executive from 75 to 80, per Bloomberg, the French business magnate, investor and art collector, once the richest man in the world, must consider who will replace him at the helm.

Although he's considering each of his five children for the role, he told The New York Times it's not inevitable that one of them will succeed him. ""The best person inside the family or outside the family should be one day my successor,"" he said.

Arnault bought Boussac Group, which owned Christian Dior, in 1984. The NYT notes the businessman bought the company for 1 franc and fired 9,000 people. That investment ""was the acorn he used to amass control of LVMH,"" the New York Times Magazine reported in 1989.

Arnault's cutthroat dealmaking and sense of style earned him his ""Wolf in Cashmere"" title, per the outlet. In France, he's a high-profile, controversial figure amid unpopular pension reforms: Earlier this year, more than 100 protestors swarmed LVMH's Paris headquarters and called for the rich to contribute more to the state pension, Reuters reported.

French media and TikTokers often draw parallels between Arnault's succession planning and the American HBO drama Succession, which followed the Roy siblings' battle over their father's CEO position. The Arnault family hates the comparison and tries to downplay it, according to the NYT.

Who are the heirs vying for Arnault's role?

The oldest and only daughter is Delphine, 48, chairman and chief executive of Christian Dior Couture and a member of the LVMH executive committee and its board. Antoine, 46, manages the group's image and sustainability efforts and is chief executive of its men's wear brand Berluti, chairman of the Italian luxury house Loro Piana, chief executive of Christian Dior S.E. and a member of the LVMH board. Both are from Arnault's first marriage to Anne Dewavrin.

The youngest three are from Arnault's second marriage to Canadian concert pianist Hélène Mercier. Alexandre, 31, is executive vice president of product and communications at Tiffany. Frédéric, 28, is chief executive of Tag Heuer. Jean, 24, is Louis Vuitton's watch director.

From a young age, the Arnault children were prepared to be potential successors. They were expected to get perfect grades in school and were paired with mentors who taught them the business and tracked their performance — but they also accept the fact that the next leader might not be one of them, according to the NYT.

Even so, they continue to prepare for the possibility.

Today, Arnault controls roughly half of LVMH, which has a market valuation of nearly $390 billion, per CNBC. Arnault created a corporate structure wherein each of his children gets a 20% stake that can't be sold for 30 years without unanimous board approval, per the NYT. The siblings attend monthly hour-and-a-half meetings with their father at LVMH headquarters to talk business. They're also preparing their own children for the same.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999171495437622}",neutral,0.9999171495437622,0

"Luxury stocks bet stumbles on inflation, China woes - Fortune","Sun, 10 Sep 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vZm9ydHVuZS5jb20vZXVyb3BlLzIwMjMvMDkvMTAvbHV4dXJ5LXN0b2Nrcy1iZXQtc3R1bWJsZXMtb24taW5mbGF0aW9uLWNoaW5hLXdvZXMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Problems are stacking up for Europe’s hottest sector.

A warning from the chairman of Cartier-owner Richemont that stubborn inflation was starting to affect demand in Europe prompted a swoon in luxury stocks last week. That downbeat message added to a string of worrying economic signals from China and signs of softer trends in the US.

It’s all testing investors’ faith in this pricey sector and raising questions about the theory that luxury stocks are Europe’s strongest response to Wall Street’s high-flying tech stocks. Some $180 billion has already been wiped out since a recent peak in July, leaving gains for the year hanging by a thread. LVMH accounted for about 60% of that slump alone and the maker of Louis Vuitton bags got overtaken by drugmaker Novo Nordisk A/S as Europe’s largest company in the process.

A stuttering recovery in China, the source of as much as a fifth of European luxury retailers’ sales, has dealt the biggest blow to the sector. But the malaise has spread to the high-end shopping districts of Paris, Madrid and London. “In Europe, ongoing inflation is starting to impact local demand,” Rupert told Richemont shareholders at its annual meeting in Geneva on Wednesday.

“What we are seeing on luxury is the end of a consensual ‘long,’” said Gilles Guibout, a portfolio manager at Axa Investment Managers in Paris, referring to a rush by investors toward this sector in the first half of the year. “Europe is typically very sensitive to world growth and this is hurting luxury as there is evidence of a slowdown.”

Guibout has an underweight position on luxury and doesn’t plan to buy the stocks until a further pullback makes them more attractive.

The latest survey of China’s services industries revealed more negative data for luxury names, with the slowest expansion this year in August. That suggests the nation’s consumers aren’t optimistic about their future income because of the faltering economy and are tending to save rather than spend.

And soaring bond yields have proved bruising for a group of companies which, like technology firms, relies heavily on capital for expansion and benefits from low interest rates. Benchmark US Treasury yields hit the highest level since 2007 in August, dealing a further blow to sentiment on the stocks.

LVMH CEO Bernard Arnault’s status as the world’s wealthiest person has been a high-profile casualty of the 15% slump in an MSCI Inc. index of luxury stocks since mid-July. Arnault’s wealth has dropped from an all-time high of $212.4 billion to $170.4 billion as of Sept. 7. Still, the French businessman has continued a history of purchasing shares in LVMH, buying about €215 million ($230 million) worth of stock since late July, according to regulatory filings.

For other investors, the sector’s high valuations leave little tolerance for any disappointments. The MSCI Europe Textiles Apparel & Luxury Goods Index trades at 24 times projected earnings, above its historical averages and a massive 90%-plus premium to benchmark indexes.

Bruno Vacossin, a Paris-based senior portfolio manager at Palatine Asset Management, said this is a good time to trim holdings and lock in gains. “I don’t think that the drivers of luxury stocks are broken but simply, the growth trend is weaker,” he said.

Along with worries about Europe’s misfiring economy, where activity is fading while price pressures persist, and a seemingly endless stream of bad news out of China, the latest US earnings season has served up evidence of weakening consumer patterns. In the face of this, analyst projections for luxury companies still look over optimistic to some investors.

“Many brokers have revised their target prices and I think that the consensus was a little too high,” Vacossin said, adding that he has reduced his positions in LVMH and Hermes. Those two companies, like Moncler SpA and Swatch Group AG, are expected to post double-digit growth in their current reporting years.

HSBC Holdings Plc analysts broke ranks this week as they cautioned that third-quarter results in luxury are likely to be “soft.” Spending on luxury items in Europe has only recovered to 41% of August 2019 levels, they said, with constraints around flight capacity and visas limiting tourist numbers and adding to local headwinds.

What’s more, technical analysts point to signals suggesting there is a risk that the descent for LVMH and its luxury peers could get worse.

“The underperformance of the sector has a high probability to continue in the coming months,” said DayByDay technical analyst Valerie Gastaldy. “Hermes will be key to the speed of the moves. It is holding up remarkably well, and it may buy some time for the rest of the sector. Yet, overall, risks remain to the downside, both in terms of absolute and relative performance, if we look into the end of the year.”

Analyst share-price projections still don’t reflect such concerns. Their aggregate price targets imply a 25% gain for LVMH over the next year, a 28% increase for Gucci-owner Kering and a 9.5% advance for Birkin-bag maker Hermes. By their estimates, the MSCI’s index for the sector offers a potential return of more than 12%.

“The stocks performed well this year, so it makes sense to take some profits,” Palatine Asset Management’s Vacossin said. “But I think it’s more a tactical move rather than a broad change in trend.”

"LVMH-Owned Thélios, Innovatek Save Safilo's Longarone Plant - WWD","Tue, 05 Sep 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3dkLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy1uZXdzL2J1c2luZXNzLWZlYXR1cmVzL2x2bWgtb3duZWQtdGhlbGlvcy1pbm5vdmF0ZWstc2FmaWxvLWxvbmdhcm9uZS1wbGFudC0xMjM1Nzg2MDE3L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"MILAN — Safilo’s employees at its Longarone plant have found two new employers.

The eyewear company said Tuesday that it has reached an agreement with trade unions whereby its 468 employees based at the storied Longarone site will relocate at Thélios, the LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton-owned eyewear manufacturer, and Innovatek, owned by entrepreneur Carlo Fulchir.

As part of Tuesday’s agreement, undersigned by the Veneto Region and its city counselor for employment Elena Donazzan, all employees will transition to the new companies, which will take over the industrial complex, in Italy’s Veneto region, one of the country’s key eyewear manufacturing hubs.

In particular about 250 Safilo workers will be relocated over several phases until 2025 at Thélios, while the remainder will join Innovatek, also in different phases.

The latter company emerged as a runner-up in the rescue process earlier this summer, squelching earlier speculation that Marcolin could chip into the deal. Innovatek submitted a 10-million-euro business plan pledging to hire more than 200 Safilo employees. It had a lukewarm reception from local trade unions and especially from Stefano Zanon, the Femca Cisl general secretary, who expressed doubts about Innovatek’s ability to fulfill its commitment.

“We are fully aware that Innovatek is not Thélios and that the road to putting in place their industrial plan, which we’re not enthusiastic about, may be paved with hurdles,” he said, adding that the union wished for Thélios to absorb the entire workforce.

Commenting on the agreement, Veneto Region president Luca Zaia expressed pride in the institutions’ role in fine-tuning and easing the deal. “News that Safilo is leaving Longarone is filled with nostalgia, but it doesn’t dent the satisfaction for closing a deal that was all but granted and which will allow manufacturing to stay put at the site,” he said in a note.

Over the past few years Safilo has been restructuring and realigning its industrial footprint to the new production scenario the company faced with the expected exit of the Dior, Fendi and Givenchy brands, following the decision in 2017 of LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton to create a venture with Marcolin, called Thélios, for the production and distribution of eyewear collections.

In 2021 LVMH took full control of that venture after agreeing to purchase Marcolin’s 49 percent stake in the business for an undisclosed sum. Separately, Marcolin bought back the 10 percent stake LVMH owned in that Italian company. Thélios’ state-of-the-art, 194,400-square-foot plant inaugurated in 2018 is also based in Longarone.

After the completion of the deal, Safilo relied on its two remaining production sites in Santa Maria di Sala and Bergamo, as well as a logistic center in Padua. In mid-2020 Safilo closed the process for the sale of the business branch of its Martignacco production site to iVision Tech, a local eyewear maker also launched and managed by the Fulchir family.

In the first six months of the year the resilience of the European market and a rebound of sales in Asia countered soft business in North America, as Safilo Group closed the period with revenues of 550.1 million euros, down 3.6 percent compared with 570.9 million euros in the same period last year.

In addition to proprietary brands including Smith, Carrera and Polaroid, Safilo produces eyewear collections under license for brands from David Beckham, Carolina Herrera and Chiara Ferragni to Isabel Marant, Jimmy Choo, Marc Jacobs, Missoni and Moschino, among some.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.999984622001648}",neutral,0.999984622001648,0
Are Luxury's Biggest Brands Inflating Away Their Emissions? - The Business of Fashion,"Tue, 26 Sep 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzb2ZmYXNoaW9uLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy9zdXN0YWluYWJpbGl0eS9rZXJpbmctbHZtaC1sdXh1cnktaW5mbGF0aW5nLWF3YXktZW1pc3Npb25zL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"In 2019, the emissions associated with making Louis Vuitton handbags, Moët champagne, Guerlain perfumes and other LVMH products amounted to 5.3 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent. Last year, that number had jumped to 6.1 million tonnes of CO2e, a 16 percent increase.

But in its annual environmental report, LVMH celebrated its success in bringing down the emissions associated with manufacturing, transporting and ultimately disposing of its products (so-called scope 3 emissions) by 15 percent compared to its 2019 baseline.

A casual reader would be forgiven for being confused. The company only reveals several pages deeper into the report that it’s referring to the intensity of its emissions, a metric that breaks down the amount of planet-warming gases released relative to each dollar of sales generated.

Over the same period, LVMH’s revenues grew by nearly 50 percent, buoyed in part by meaty price hikes. Those higher earnings have helped flatter the company’s emissions intensity even as its overall environmental footprint has increased, albeit at a slower pace.

It’s a trend reflected across the luxury sector, where many big brands have pursued a strategy of aggressive price increases in recent years. And it may be allowing companies to report emissions reductions that seem better than they are.

What’s Price Got to Do With Emissions?

Intensity-based carbon accounting was designed to allow companies to set emissions reduction ambitions and bank progress, while still making room for business to grow.

It’s a methodology commonly used by luxury companies, especially when setting targets for tricky-to-tackle scope 3 emissions that are out of their direct control, but typically account for the bulk of their impact.

The problem is that intensity-based metrics rely on economic value to act as a proxy for industrial activity and hence impact. But when rising revenue is disconnected from production and other polluting activities, for instance, when it’s buoyed by price hikes, it opens the way to distort calculations of environmental progress.

The Science Based Targets initiative, an organisation that has become an arbiter for corporate climate targets, does allow for this kind of accounting within certain parameters, but acknowledges the risks it presents. “Economic intensity indicators … are subject to a number of variables that can lead to apparent changes in a company’s carbon intensity that have nothing to do with its environmental performance,” it said in an explanation of its methods published in 2021.

At Gucci owner Kering, scope 3 emissions have grown 71 percent since 2015, the baseline year for the company’s emission reduction targets. Over that same period, the company’s sales grew a similar amount; the emissions intensity it reported halved.

LVMH said that a granular assessment of its impact reveals where progress is being made. For instance, emissions relating specifically to purchased goods, which largely covers manufacturing, were more-or-less flat between 2019 and 2022 — though this was offset increases elsewhere. Moreover, the company said several factors have gone into its revenue growth, including changes to product volumes and mix, as well as price. The company’s scope 3 emissions are calculated in accordance with the corporate carbon accounting standard, the GHG Protocol, and approved by statutory auditors, it said.

Kering did not comment. Earlier this year, the company announced a new absolute reduction target for its scope 3 emissions.

In theory, the potential distortions caused by pricing could work the opposite way too, leading to a precipitous spike in emissions intensity if there’s a drop-off in sales.

“It leads to gaming in either direction,” said Kenneth Pucker, a professor of practice at the Tufts Fletcher School.

What’s the Impact of Price Inflation?

Exactly how much luxury’s recent spate of price hikes is influencing brands’ emissions numbers is almost impossible to calculate. A range of different factors will affect a company’s intensity calculation, most of which aren’t disclosed and could well differ from company to company.

That’s true even of basic pricing data, which brands don’t release consistently or introduce in a uniform manner.

For instance, between October 2019 and this April, the price of a small Gucci GG Marmont Matelassé shoulder bag in France increased by 75 percent, according to an analysis by HSBC. On the other hand, if you’re looking at the brand’s women’s Ace sneaker embellished with a gold bee, it’s only 27 percent more expensive today than four years ago. The price of a Louis Vuitton Speedy Damier bag has risen 56 percent.

That said, the average US price of mens and womenswear products online was up roughly 40 percent at both Gucci and Louis Vuitton in July 2023 compared to July 2019, according to an analysis by Edited. That’s around double the rate of inflation in the US over that same period.

According to Bernstein analyst Luca Solca, price increases mean that volume growth may have been 20 percent below top-line growth at luxury brands, helping to keep a lid on emissions.

Is it Greenwashing?

Carbon accounting is a complicated and still maturing space, and intensity-based metrics remain in wide use — though companies should be careful to make it clear in their disclosures when reported reductions are relative.

ADVERTISEMENT

Scrutiny over how companies measure and disclose their emissions is mounting as the window to stave off the worst impacts of climate change narrows and climate reporting becomes more regulated. SBTi guidance written for the apparel and footwear industry notes that because of factors that include the volatility of financial metrics, economic-intensity-based target-setting is considered less robust than other methods.

“It’s a really confusing approach,” said sustainability strategy consultant Michael Sadowski, who helped write the SBTi guidelines for the fashion industry. “When people ask me, I’m like, ‘Don’t do that; just set an absolute target.’”

In March, Kering became the first among Europe’s luxury giants to set an absolute scope 3 reduction target, committing to reduce absolute emissions across its supply chain 40 percent by 2035.

For the group, elevated pricing is an explicit part of its sustainability strategy, with a “value over volume” approach theoretically allowing it to sell fewer goods at higher prices, powering top line growth without adding any costs to the planet.

“Everyone wants to grow,” said Sadowski. “If you’re making higher quality products and fewer of them and charging more, then isn’t that better than making a lot of crappy products?”

Tiffany Collabs With Fellow LVMH-Owned Rimowa - National Jeweler,"Wed, 20 Sep 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vbmF0aW9uYWxqZXdlbGVyLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy8xMjI5NC10aWZmYW55LWNvbGxhYnMtd2l0aC1mZWxsb3ctbHZtaC1vd25lZC1yaW1vd2HSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"New York—It’s a match made in LVMH heaven.

Tiffany & Co. has joined forces with German luggage brand Rimowa on a capsule collection of cases.

LVMH owns both luxury companies.

Rimowa was founded in 1898 and debuted its signature aviation-inspired aluminum suitcases in 1937. In 2000, it innovated the luggage industry once again with a polycarbonate suitcase.

LVMH acquired the brand in 2017, helping it launch a collection of bags for daily use, called “Never Still,” in 2020.





There are three items in the Tiffany and Rimowa collaboration: a suitcase, a jewelry case, and a smaller jewelry case called the “jewelry personal.”

The “Rimowa x Tiffany & Co. Rock Cut Cabin” suitcase adapts the luggagemaker’s signature grooved aluminum surface to resemble a diamond’s facets. The geometric pattern incorporates Tiffany’s “T” motif throughout.

The handles, luggage tag, and wheels are crafted in Tiffany Blue, as is the interior.

The “Rimowa x Tiffany & Co. Jewelry Case” features the same “rock cut” design as the suitcase. Designed for jewelry storage, while on the go or at home, the case has three levels and a mirror.

The top sealed tray has five compartments for rings and other jewelry items. The middle tray is intended for necklaces and bracelets, while the lowest tray has three large compartments.





The jewelry case’s interior is rendered in Tiffany Blue.

The “Rimowa x Tiffany & Co. Jewelry Personal,” takes Tiffany Blue to the next level, however, with the polycarbonate exterior crafted entirely in the shade.

The smallest item of the three-piece assortment, it has six jewelry compartments for safekeeping during travel.



The Rimowa x Tiffany & Co. jewelry personal case





“We are proud to join forces with Tiffany & Co., another legendary brand with the finest craftsmanship,” said Rimowa CEO Hugues Bonnet-Masimbert.

“The creation of such purposeful and one-of-kind pieces represents the centuries of expertise behind both brands and the mastery of engineering that we bring to the table.

Tiffany & Co. Executive Vice President of Product and Communication, Alexandre Arnault, added, “We are thrilled to debut the Rimowa x Tiffany collection, bringing together two maisons with unmatched craftsmanship and innovative designs.

“This one-of-a-kind collaboration unifies two icons in one, both of which are incredibly personal to me and represent the highest caliber of craftsmanship.”

The suitcase will retail for €2,900, or approximately $3,097 per current exchange rates. The jewelry case will retail for €3,900 ($4,165), and the jewelry personal case for €1,800 ($1,922).","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.999995231628418}",neutral,0.999995231628418,0

Reuters Published

Sep 23, 2011

PARIS, Sept 22 (Reuters) - An executive and director at the world's biggest luxury goods maker LVMH was placed under investigation on Thursday in an inquiry into alleged kickbacks paid to politicians from arms sales to Pakistan.

Nicolas Bazire, also a personal friend of President Nicolas Sarkozy and a past government aide, was arrested on Wednesday over allegations that he took delivery of kickbacks in the so-called ""Karachi Affair"".

His involvement was further sign of how closely the worlds of French business and politics intersect, with its government and financial elites often rubbing shoulders at the same top schools and then later jumping between public and private sectors.

The case involves alleged commissions linked to submarine sales to Pakistan that prosecutors believe helped finance the presidential campaign of former prime minister Edouard Balladur in 1995, when Bazire was his chief of staff.

Bazire, who was a witness to Sarkozy's wedding with Carla Bruni in 2008, is also a longtime lieutenant of LVMH boss Bernard Arnault. He runs the luxury tycoon's private holding company Groupe Arnault and sits on the executive board of LVMH, in charge of development and acquisitions.

Arnault, France's wealthiest man and also regarded as a friend of Sarkozy, has many friends in the world of politics. Patrick Ouart, a former French magistrate and justice advisor to Balladur, is a member of LVMH's executive committee as advisor to Arnault.

LVMH on Thursday distanced itself from the affair.

""This matter has strictly no link and no relation to the functions M. Bazire holds at LVMH,"" a spokesman for LVMH said, adding that Bazire was under no travel restrictions from French investigators.

NOT INVOLVED

Shares in the owner of brands including clothing and leather goods maker Louis Vuitton and champagne maker Moet & Chandon were down 6.3 percent, though analysts blamed a wider rout in luxury goods stocks.

Bazire's lawyer Jean-Yves Lienard said his client would be able to explain himself soon.

""A hearing shortly will show that he (Bazire) is absolutely not involved, whether in the conception or in the implementation of these contracts, at whatever level,"" Lienard said.

He added that at no point was the name of Nicolas Sarkozy mentioned by anybody.

Another friend of the French president, Thierry Gaubert, was placed under investigation on Wednesday on suspicion that he carried cash kickbacks from the submarine sales back to France in suitcases.

Bazire, a graduate from the prestigious ENA school, the French establishment alma mater, built up a powerful address book within both political and business circles.

After his time as head of cabinet of Balladur between 1993 and 1995, Bazir joined the bank Rothschild & Cie in charge of mergers and acquisitions. Bazire also sits on the board of French retailer Carrefour as a non-independent director. Groupe Arnault and Colony together own 14 percent of Carrefour.

Bernard Arnault gives 10 million euros ($10.7 million) to Restos du Coeur

Bernard Arnault, the billionaire head of luxury conglomerate LVMH (LVMHF), revealed earlier this week that his family is donating 10 million euros ($10.7 million) to Restos du Coeur, a French food bank. Translating to “Restaurants of the Heart,” the charity provides 35 percent of France’s food aid.

“Through this act of solidarity, the Arnault family wishes to actively contribute to helping a magnificent general interest association that has been working continuously for nearly 40 years to assist the most vulnerable,” said Arnault and his family in a statement. Restos du Coeur has reportedly been forced to cut back its services in recent months amid budgetary issues stemming from inflation. The donation was made shortly after Arnault learned of the non-profit’s “significant financial difficulties.”

This isn’t the first time Arnault, the world’s second richest person (with an estimated net worth of $196 billion) has centered his philanthropic efforts in France. He previously pledged $226 million toward the reconstruction of Notre Dame Cathedral, one-upping the $112 million pledge made by Francois Pinault, founder of luxury conglomerate Kering, LVMH’s primary rival. Arnault additionally made a multi-million dollar donation toward French hospitals during the Covid-19 pandemic, and earlier this year funded France’s $47 million acquisition of a Gustave Caillebotte painting. His other philanthropic contributions have included an $11 million gift in 2019 toward organizations fighting Amazon (AMZN) wildfires.

Jeff Bezos pledges $22.8 million to locally led land restoration in Africa

The Bezos Earth Fund, launched by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos in 2020, recently announced its plans to funnel $22.8 million toward locally led restoration efforts in the Greater Rift Valley in Kenya and the Lake Kivu and Rusizi River Basin in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Rwanda and Burundi.

Focused on 600,000 hectares of land, the restoration efforts could sequester 42 million metric tons of carbon dioxide by 2050, which would be equivalent to removing 9.3 million gas-powered vehicles from the streets, according to the Bezos Earth Fund. The grants will aid community and grassroots-led groups, supporting research into native tree seed supply, monitoring of land change and restoration and fundraising and investment related to restoration projects.

The gift represents the second major donation from Bezos, the world’s third richest man with a fortune of $161 billion, in recent weeks. In mid-August, Bezos and his fiancee Lauren Sanchez pledged $100 million to aid relief efforts for the Hawaii wildfires, launching a Maui fund.

Meanwhile, the Bezos Earth Fund, which aims to give out $10 billion by 2030, made a $12 million grant to the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute in July to help the Panama-based facility further its goal of preserving tropical ecosystems. The gift follows Bezos’ $200 million donation to the Smithsonian in 2021—the largest donation to the institution since the 1846 founding gift from James Smithson.

Jennifer and Dan Gilbert contribute $375 million to neurofibromatosis research and treatment

In Detroit, a staggering pledge from Dan Gilbert, the founder of mortgage lender Rocket Companies, will establish two new health facilities. The Gilbert Family Foundation, founded by Dan and his wife Jennifer, is contributing nearly $375 million to the creation of a 72-bed inpatient rehabilitation center and a research institute dedicated to neurofibromatosis (NF), a genetic disease that causes tumors to grow on nerve pathways.

Gilbert’s donation will cover the majority of the projects’ $439 million construction and operational costs over the next decade. The rehabilitation center, managed by Shirley Ryan AbilityLab, will become part of healthcare provider Henry Ford Health’s upcoming expansion, while the NF institute will be built in partnership with both Henry Ford Health and Michigan State University.

Both institutes are personal for Gilbert, who suffered a stroke in 2019 and was formerly a patient of Shirley Ryan AbilityLab. The NF center will be named after his son Nick, who died earlier this year from complications of the disease. “While our family has faced severe health crises, we have been fortunate to receive some of the best medical and rehabilitative care in the country,” said Gilbert in a statement, adding that he hopes his investments can “enhance access to that same top-notch care for all Detroiters in times of need.”

Gilbert, who has pledged to give away the majority of his $21.3 billion fortune, largely directs his charitable giving toward NF research and fighting inequity in Detroit. His previous donations have included a 10-year, $500 million pledge to reduce poverty and improve neglected areas of the city, a $20 million fund for local home repairs and a $30 million gift to Michigan’s Cranbrook Academy of Arts.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999788999557495}",neutral,0.9999788999557495,0

Discover SCENE

Bernard Arnault, CEO of luxury super-conglomerate LVMH and the second-richest man on Earth, has a choice to make.

According to a profile published Thursday by The New York Times, the 74-year-old corporate titan—who controls 75 top luxury brands including Louis Vuitton, Dior, Dom Pérignon, TAG Heuer, and Tiffany & Co.—is currently evaluating which of his five children he might select to inherit his business empire.

The decision is a consequential one, which will likely shape the trajectory of the world’s most powerful luxury player for decades to come. The choice also stands to have a sizable impact on the centrality of emerging technologies—particularly, the blockchain—to the strategy and image of the dozens of leading luxury brands under LVMH’s thumb.

Two of Arnault’s sons—Alexandre, 31, executive vice president of product and communications at Tiffany, and Frédéric, 28, CEO of TAG Heuer—are credited with encouraging their father to embrace blockchain technology and NFTs. They’ve convinced him to push related innovations through LVMH portfolio companies including Louis Vuitton, Tiffany, TAG, and, most recently, Dior.

If either Alexandre or Frédéric were to succeed their father and assume personal control of LVMH, blockchain and other cutting-edge technologies, including artificial intelligence, would all but certainly take on a more central role at LVMH-owned companies, which also include Bulgari, Givenchy, Dom Pérignon, Veuve Clicquot, and Hennessy.

Given LVMH’s size and stature, such decisions would also likely influence, if not outright guide strategy and trends in the broader luxury and fashion industries. But Alexandre and Frédéric aren’t the only heirs jockeying for the crown—Arnault’s other three children all work in leadership positions at LVMH companies, and were also groomed for those roles from a young age.

Delphine, 48, Arnault’s eldest child and only daughter, serves as chairwoman and CEO of Dior; Antoine, 46, guides LVMH’s image while running fashion brands Berluti and Loro Piana; Jean, 24, heads Louis Vuitton’s watch division.

According to the Times, Arnault gathers his five progeny for lunch every month at the top floor of LVMH’s headquarters in Paris, for what the children understand to be an unspoken evaluation of their readiness to one day take the top job.

AD

That day may be a ways away—Arnault recently convinced the LVMH board to raise the mandatory retirement age for his CEO position from 75 to 80—but when it comes, it would appear the businessman is positioning a blood disciple to succeed him. Last year, he reshaped the corporate structure of LVMH to guarantee that each of his children has a 20% stake in the company, and that none could sell any shares for 30 years without unanimous board approval.

Arnault’s children insist that their rapport is decidedly amicable, despite the frequent comparisons made in recent years between them and the ill-fated Roys of the acclaimed HBO series ""Succession.""

But just as with the premise of that show, there can only be one. Which Arnault heir, if any, ends up taking the reins at LVMH will certainly be a decision that impacts not only the fashion and luxury industries, but also the mainstream adoption of crypto at culture’s highest level.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999990463256836}",neutral,0.9999990463256836,0

The Jio World Plaza, which an industry source said is likely to open this year, is located inside Reliance's $1 billion business and cultural hub in Mumbai's business district.



Reliance has yet to disclose details about the tenants, but lease documents provided by real estate analytics firm CRE Matrix showed that Group as well as several brands owned by , and have agreed to rent shops in the mall, and also share between 4% and 12% of their monthly net revenue with Reliance.

The brands include jewellers Cartier and , fashion houses Louis Vuitton, and Gucci, watch brand Schaffhausen and luxury luggage maker Rimowa, which will open its first outlet in India.



Reliance, Burberry, LVMH, Kering and Richemont did not respond to a request for comment.

""Luxury brands have always struggled for quality retail spaces in India and many were forced to open their first outlets in luxury hotels,"" said Anuj Kejriwal, CEO of India's Anarock Retail. ""These brands are now looking for meaningful presence.""



At almost 700 square metres (7,500 square feet), Louis Vuitton's Jio World Plaza store will be the most spacious of its four outlets in India. Cartier's store will be its second in the country and for Dior, it will be the third.



To ensure the mall retains its luxury appeal, some lease agreements like that of Dior include a clause that entitles it to a 25% rent reduction if at least four of 10 luxury brands including Gucci, Cartier, Bulgari and Tiffany don't open their own outlets in the mall within six months.

Thélios, the LVMH group’s manufacturer of optical and sunglass frames, is embarking on external growth. On Tuesday, it announced the acquisition of the Vuarnet eyewear brand.

Thélios’ acquisition of Vuarnet, the legendary brand of high-end mountain and snow eyewear, marks the company’s first acquisition since its creation in 2017. The amount paid to the current owner, investment fund NEO Investment Partners, was not disclosed.

A summit meeting and synergies in sight

As announced in the official press release, this transaction marks an important step in the development of Thélios, strengthening its presence across the entire eyewear value chain. Thanks to its unique positioning at the crossroads of outdoor and fashion, Vuarnet will perfectly complement the portfolio of LVMH brands under license.

Alessandro Zanardo, CEO of Thélios, welcomed the acquisition, making Vuarnet “the first brand owner” of this subsidiary of the LVMH group.

Behind the House’s remarkable history, Alessandro Zanardo praised its “iconic design, unrivalled expertise […] and recognized values of innovation, performance and elegance” which “perfectly match our philosophy and positioning.”

Joining Thélios will guarantee Vuarnet access to its resources, particularly in terms of research and development and technical expertise. In addition, the eyewear brand will be able to benefit from the international presence of the LVMH subsidiary, promoting the brand’s growth and global expansion.

An iconic brand for extreme situations

An iconic brand specializing in high-end eyewear for high altitudes, Vuarnet has a rich heritage spanning more than six decades and is a pioneer in the production of mineral lenses.

The adventure began in the French Alps in 1957 with Roger Pouilloux, an avant-garde optician determined to create lenses “capable of enhancing visual acuity and accentuating relief on snow”. This was to be the Skilynx™ ski-specific lens.

It wasn’t long before the brand enjoyed unrivalled popularity thanks to French skier Jean Vuarnet, who equipped with the famous bi-graded lenses, model 02, won the gold medal in the downhill at the Olympic Games in Squaw Valley, California, near Lake Tahoe. It was a seminal victory that marked the union of optician and sportsman through a licensing agreement.

This marked the beginning of a golden age for the brand, which was chosen as official partner of the 1984 Los Angeles Olympic Games. By the 1990s, the brand was generating sales of nearly $100 million and selling 1.5 million pairs a year.

Since then, Vuarnet has accompanied countless outdoor enthusiasts, including celebrities immortalized on the silver screen, such as Alain Delon in La Piscine (1969), Jeff Bridges in The Big Lebowski (1998) and Daniel Craig in James Bond – Spectre (2015).

But the brand has also succeeded in establishing itself in the eyewear sector thanks to its expertise in combining innovation, performance and timeless style.

Behind its timeless success lies a rare process: the in-house manufacture of mineral lenses.

Novo Nordisk's market capitalization was $421 billion including unlisted stock at 9:43 a.m. London time, according to Refinitiv data cited by Reuters, versus LVMH's $420.97 billion.

LVMH regained the top spot it previously held for two-and-a-half years by 11 a.m. London time, Refinitiv data showed, but the drugmaker remains on its heels.

Novo Nordisk produces drugs Ozempic and Wegovy, which have generated massive hype over the past year over their potential weight loss uses.

In August, the company released clinical trial results indicating that Wegovy reduced the risk of serious heart problems and heart-related death by 20%. Its share price has more than tripled over the last three years, and has gained 66% over the last 12 months.

Denmark on Thursday revised up its GDP annual growth forecast to 1.2% from 0.6%, citing a boost from the pharmaceutical industry as a key factor.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9966377019882202}",positive,0.9966377019882202,1
"Bernard Arnault, world's second-richest man, probed for money-laundering - New York Post","Fri, 29 Sep 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vbnlwb3N0LmNvbS8yMDIzLzA5LzI5L2Jlcm5hcmQtYXJuYXVsdC0ybmQtcmljaGVzdC1wcm9iZWQtZm9yLW1vbmV5LWxhdW5kZXJpbmcv0gFaaHR0cHM6Ly9ueXBvc3QuY29tLzIwMjMvMDkvMjkvYmVybmFyZC1hcm5hdWx0LTJuZC1yaWNoZXN0LXByb2JlZC1mb3ItbW9uZXktbGF1bmRlcmluZy9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Bernard Arnault, the LVMH luxury magnate who is second on the list of world’s richest people, is under investigation by authorities in his native France over suspicions that he laundered money by buying real estate through a Russian oligarch.

The Paris public prosecutor’s office confirmed to Reuters a report in the French-language daily Le Monde which stated that a preliminary investigation had been launched last year into transactions involving Arnault and Nikolai Sarkisov.

In the French legal system, a preliminary investigation does not necessarily imply wrongdoing.

Le Monde, citing the French finance ministry’s financial intelligence unit Tracfin, reported on Thursday that Sarkisov had acquired real estate at a luxury Alpine resort via a complex transaction in which Arnault, through one of his companies, had provided a loan.

According to the report, Sarkisov purchased several properties in 2018 in Courchevel, the exclusive ski resort where hotel stays can cost visitors thousands of dollars per night.

Arnault is alleged to have loaned Sarkisov $21.2 million so that the oligarch, who helps his brother Sergei run Russian insurance giant RESO-Garantiya, could purchase the properties under his name.

An unidentified Tracfin official told Le Monde the transactions involving Arnault and Sarkisov, who both acted through a complex web of legal entities, could have been aimed at concealing the origins of the funds used.

Le Monde cited a person close to Arnault as saying that the arrangement with Sarkisov was legal under French law.

The Post has sought comment from LVMH and Sarkisov.

Arnault and his family are said to be worth $164 billion on the strength of their stake in the luxury empire whose portfolio includes world-famous brand names such as Louis Vuitton, Dior, Givenchy, Bulgari, Dom Pérignon, Sephora, and Fendi.

As of Friday, LVMH boasted a market capitalization of $393 billion.

The 74-year-old Arnault has delayed retirement while at the same time grooming his five children to run different aspects of the family business.

Arnault is father to Christian Dior head Delphine Arnault, 48, and Dior Vice Chairman Antoine Arnault, 46, who are Bernard’s two oldest from his first marriage; Alexandre Arnault, 31, executive vice president of Tiffany & Co.; Frédéric Arnault, 28, who manages the TAG Heuer watch brand; and Jean Arnault, 25, the head marketing and development officer at the company’s watches division.

Business observers are eager to see which one of the children Bernard Arnault picks to run his empire once he retires.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999172687530518}",neutral,0.9999172687530518,0
Morgan Stanley says luxury industry heading for downturn - InvestmentNews,"Tue, 26 Sep 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmludmVzdG1lbnRuZXdzLmNvbS9pbmR1c3RyeS1uZXdzL25ld3MvbW9yZ2FuLXN0YW5sZXktc2F5cy1sdXh1cnktaW5kdXN0cnktaGVhZGluZy1mb3ItZG93bnR1cm4tMjQzODQy0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"European luxury stocks fell again on Tuesday as Morgan Stanley joined the chorus of analysts warning that demand for expensive handbags and jewelry in China and Europe is likely to slow.

Shares in French luxury giant LVMH fell as much as 2.3%, extending their drop from the year’s high to about 22%. Cartier owner Richemont dropped as much as 3.3% while Gucci parent Kering and Burberry Group Plc were also lower.

Morgan Stanley analysts led by Edouard Aubin lowered their organic growth forecasts for most luxury companies for the second half of the year, and also trimmed their 2024 profit forecasts, saying that their checks indicate that demand in China softened over the summer and Europe was also weaker.

While recent share-price declines have left the luxury sector approaching so-called value territory, Aubin said it isn’t time to buy the dip. “We expect a weak exit rate to the quarter to intensify the debate around demand normalization,” he wrote.

Morgan Stanley’s comments echo other analysts who have been bearish on the sector recently. Earlier this month, Barclays analyst Carole Madjo reduced her recommendation on LVMH and the firm lowered its view on the sector to neutral from positive. Deutsche Bank’s European equity strategists also downgraded the consumer products sector because of luxury companies’ exposure to China, while analysts at Jefferies and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. see choppy times ahead.

Morgan Stanley’s Aubin downgraded Richemont to equal-weight from overweight today and upgraded Prada to overweight from equal-weight. The analyst lowered his price targets for LVMH, Kering, Moncler SpA and several other luxury stocks.","{'label': 'Negative', 'score': 0.9986364245414734}",negative,0.9986364245414734,-1

LVMH regained the lead later in the day, when its worth reached around $435 billion while Novo fell to around $426 billon.

Obesity in Europe



The trend may signal that Europeans care as much about losing weight as they do about having luxury goods. Around 59% of adults and almost 1 in 3 children in Europe are overweight or living with obesity, according to a recent report by the World Health Organization (WHO). The prevalence of obesity in Europe is higher than any other WHO region except the Americas.

Novo stated that its drug Wegovy may reduce the risk of a heart attack or stroke by 20% in overweight or obese people with a history of heart disease. Ozempic lowers blood sugar and is in demand as a highly effective diabetes and weight-loss drug that is now in short supply around the world.

The weight loss drug market is expected to reach $100 billion in annual sales within the next 10 years.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.957321047782898}",neutral,0.957321047782898,0

The probe concerns their activities in Courchevel, a ski resort in the French Alps known for being a playground for the ultra-rich, they said late Thursday.

The French economy ministry's financial intelligence unit is leading the investigation, but has yet to determine whether any crime had been committed, a source close to the investigation told AFP.

French daily Le Monde, citing the Tracfin financial intelligence unit, reported that the 55-year old Russian billionaire had acquired 14 housing units from a single seller in 2018 for 16 million euros ($17 million at current rates) in a complex deal involving companies based in France, Luxembourg and Cyprus.

Although he is believed to be the buyer, Sarkisov's name appears nowhere on the books of the company carrying out the purchase.

The company, called La Fleche, is believed to have bought three more real estate units from a second company which, it turns out, also belonged to Sarkisov.

The sale of the real estate to himself allowed the Russian to pocket a capital gain of 1.2 million euros, according to the paper.

Arnault – who runs luxury empire LVMH and is the world's second-richest person after Elon Musk according to Forbes – is suspected of lending 18.3 million euros to Sarkisov for the deal.

He is then believed to have acquired La Fleche, effectively becoming the owner of the real estate portfolio.

The ownership change could have been designed ""to hide the exact origin of the funds"", Le Monde quoted a Tracfin document as saying, as well as the identity of the ""ultimate beneficiary"".

Investigators believe Sarkisov made two million euros from the operation, but they were still in the dark how much he had paid for the loan.

Contacted by AFP, LVMH declined to comment.

Le Monde, however, quoted a spokesman as saying that the operation had been ""carried out with the strictest observance of the law"".

The paper also cited people close to Sarkisov as saying that the capital gain was ""just a few hundred of thousands of euros"", and that the Russian had not been involved personally.

Le Monde said that according to ""family lore"", Arnault has a special connection to Courchevel because he learned to ski there as a child and where he owns a mansion and a luxury hotel.

Hotel prices in the resort can reach several tens of thousands of euros per night, the paper noted.

Transactions involving French billionaire Bernard Arnault investigated over suspected money laundering - CNN,"Fri, 29 Sep 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vMjAyMy8wOS8yOS9idXNpbmVzcy9iZXJuYXJkLWFybmF1bHQtaW52ZXN0aWdhdGlvbi1ydXNzaWFuLWJ1c2luZXNzbWFuL2luZGV4Lmh0bWzSAV1odHRwczovL2FtcC5jbm4uY29tL2Nubi8yMDIzLzA5LzI5L2J1c2luZXNzL2Jlcm5hcmQtYXJuYXVsdC1pbnZlc3RpZ2F0aW9uLXJ1c3NpYW4tYnVzaW5lc3NtYW4?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Paris CNN —

French billionaire Bernard Arnault and Russian Oligarch Nikolai Sarkisov are under “preliminary investigation” for their alleged involvement in “transactions likely to constitute money-laundering offences,” the Paris Public Prosecutor’s Office told CNN.

The Prosecutor’s Office confirmed earlier reporting from French publication Le Monde.

As the subject of a preliminary investigation, Arnault is not suspected and has not been accused of wrongdoing.

The prosecutor’s office said they added a memo from the French economy ministry’s financial intelligence watchdog (Tracfin) related to real estate transactions involving both Arnault and Sarkisov to an ongoing preliminary investigation into the Russian oligarch’s operations in France, which started in 2022.

Le Monde, which said it had access to the memo, said the memo was sent by Tracfin to the Public Prosecutor’s Office in Lyon in December 2022. The newspaper says the case was “quickly” transferred to the Paris prosecutor’s office, which asked the national-level anti-money-laundering watchdog, to look into it.

Le Monde reports that per that memo, companies belonging to Sarkisov acquired fourteen properties in the luxury Alpine resort of Courchevel in the Fall of 2018 for 16 million euros ($17 million). They achieved this via a complex set-up of companies in France, Luxembourg and Cyprus, according to Le Monde.

Citing the memo, Le Monde said that Sarkisov’s name did not appear on the books of the company which carried out the purchase, called SNC La Fleche, although the oligarch was described by Tracfin as its effective owner through a network of holding companies.

Within the same period, Le Monde said SNC La Fleche acquired three other properties in the same neighborhood from a company called SNC Croix Realty, for 2.2 million euros. Sarkisov also owned SNC Croix Realty at the time, according to Le Monde. Le Monde, citing the memo, says SNC Croix Realty made a 1.2 million Euro profit upon the sale of the units they had bought a year earlier.

Tracfin also believes French billionaire Bernard Arnault loaned 18.3 million euros ($19.4 million) to Sarkisov for the deal through his private holding company, per Le Monde. According to the French newspaper, the LVMH chairman then bought La Fleche in December 2018.

According to Le Monde, the Tracfin memo explains Arnault first loaned the amount to one of Sarkisov’s companies, before acquiring the company that owned these assets. Le Monde adds the investigation will have to “determine the reason for this apparent incongruity,” as well as “explain the need for Mr. Arnault to call on Mr. Sarkisov as an intermediary in these transactions.”

“The change in the final beneficial owner of the real estate acquisitions (…) tends to conceal the exact origin of the funds, to complicate the transactions and the identification of the real purchaser, and to reflect a desire to conceal the actual beneficiary of all these transactions, i.e. Bernard Arnault,” Tracfin investigators wrote in the memo, fuelling their suspicions of “money laundering.”

CNN cannot independently verify the content of the Tracfin documents.

Le Monde cited a person close to Arnault who said the transaction had been “carried out in strict compliance with the law,” adding that “as with any real estate transaction” there were legal parties involved “responsible for ensuring compliance with all existing regulations.”

Sarkisov’s team told Le Monde that the Russian businessman was “not at all personally involved” in these transactions and that at the time “there were no known business links between the two men.”

Sarkisov is not on the European Union’s list of individuals sanctioned in response to Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February last year.

CNN has reached out to Tracfin and LVMH for comment and is reaching out to Nikolai Sarkisov.

Europe’s richest man

According to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, Arnault’s net wealth of $164 billion makes him the world’s second-richest person behind only Elon Musk.

LVMH is one of Europe’s biggest companies, encompassing luxury fashion and drinks brands such as Louis Vuitton and Moet & Chandon. It did not immediately respond to a CNN request for comment.

Arnault bought a controlling stake in LVMH in 1989, two years after the group was formed by the merger of Louis Vuitton and Moët Hennessy. He has been chairman and CEO of the company ever since.

Over the past three decades, Arnault has turned LVMH into a luxury goods powerhouse with 75 labels selling wine, spirits, fashion, leather goods, perfumes, cosmetics, watches, jewelery, luxury travel and hotel stays.

Novo Nordisk is known for developing the weight-loss drug Wegovy, which it launched in 2021.

Earlier this year, LVMH, the conglomerate behind luxury brands like Louis Vuitton and Tiffany, became the first European company to surpass a market value of $500 billion.

Novo Nordisk, founded in Denmark in 1923, is a pharmaceutical company known for several leading drugs used in diabetes treatment, benefiting over 36 million people worldwide. The company's flagship diabetes treatment for type 2 diabetes, Ozempic, received approval for use in 2017, with its annual sales reaching $8.5 billion in 2022.

Novo Nordisk's weight loss drug, Wegovy, which is based on Ozempic and administered by injection, has demonstrated an average weight loss rate of 17% in clinical trials during its third phase. The drug received approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 2021 and has since faced continuous supply shortages. The company is actively seeking approval for an oral version of Wegovy, which could be available as early as 2024.

Novo Nordisk's value has surged fourfold since 2018, primarily due to Wegovy. In August, the company reached a peak valuation of $423 billion after releasing trial data showing that the weight loss drug reduced the likelihood of severe heart events, such as heart attacks, by 20%. However, at that same time, LVMH had a higher valuation.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9965499639511108}",positive,0.9965499639511108,1

Source: Adobe / Florence Piot

The luxury conglomerate LVMH, headed by CEO Bernard Arnault, is facing a pivotal moment in its history as the business magnate decides which of his five children will inherit his vast empire.

This decision could significantly impact the adoption of crypto and blockchain technology within the luxury industry, crypto news outlet Decrypt reported on Friday.

Two of Arnault’s sons, Alexandre, and Frédéric, have been instrumental in pushing blockchain technology and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) within LVMH’s portfolio companies.

If either of them assumes control of LVMH, it is likely that blockchain and other cutting-edge technologies, such as artificial intelligence (AI), will play a more central role in the group’s strategy.

This shift could affect luxury brands like Louis Vuitton, Tiffany, TAG Heuer, and Dior, which are all under the LVMH umbrella.

Already, Louis Vuitton has dipped its toe in crypto with a non-fungible token (NFT) trunk project announced in June this year, while Dior has unveiled a new line of men’s sneakers that leverages Ethereum to offer a matching NFT.

Meanwhile, in January last year, Arnault suggested that LVMH had more plans for NFTs and the metaverse, saying during an earnings call that:

“We have to see what will be the applications of the metaverse and NFTs. It can undoubtedly have a positive impact — if it is well done — on the activity of the brands, but it is not our objective to sell virtual sneakers at €10. We are not interested in that.”

The decision regarding Arnault’s successor is not only significant for the conglomerate but also for the broader luxury and fashion industries, given LVMH’s position as an industry leader with considerable influence.

Children prepared to take over

Arnault’s five children, all actively involved in leadership positions within LVMH-owned companies, have from an early age been prepared for taking on senior leadership roles within the conglomerate.

Their father is said to regularly meet with his children to evaluate their readiness for top positions within the conglomerate.

While Bernard Arnault recently raised the mandatory retirement age for his CEO position from 75 to 80, indicating his intention to remain involved, his children’s future involvement remains a topic of discussion.

Arnault’s succession plan aims to ensure that each of his children holds a 20% stake in the company and cannot sell any shares for 30 years without unanimous board approval.

And with crypto advocates like Alexandre and Frédéric among the heirs, it’s clear that the strategy of LVMH-owned luxury brands could become more blockchain-focused, potentially blurring the line further between crypto and the traditional luxury industry.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9991095662117004}",neutral,0.9991095662117004,0

French authorities are looking into billionaire Bernard Arnault's dealings with a Russian businessman.

Nikolai Sarkisov bought properties in 2018 through intermediary companies, but the buyer was Arnault, reports said.

Officials alleged that Arnault paid Sarkisov about €20 million to own the assets.

The Paris public prosecutor's office said Friday that it is investigating billionaire LVMH CEO Bernard Arnault's dealings with Russian businessman Nikolai Sarkisov, according to multiple media reports.

French daily newspaper Le Monde reported that officials are looking specifically into real estate transactions between the two individuals in the ski resort of Courchevel.

Prosecutors said the investigation into the LVMH chief started last year, per Bloomberg.

In 2018, Le Monde said, Sarkisov purchased multiple properties in Courchevel using intermediary companies. Yet the end-buyer in those transactions turned out to be Arnault — and he is alleged to have paid Sarkisov roughly €20 million to own the assets.

Sarkisov, in turn, allegedly turned a €2 million profit on the deals.

Investigators told Le Monde that the transactions look like they masked the origin of the funds, and who the ultimate buyer actually was. Le Monde's report cited people familiar with Arnault as saying the deals were legal.

Arnault runs the world's largest luxury goods company and is the second-richest person in the world after Elon Musk. He has a net worth of about $212 billion, and his expansive conglomerate controls top brands across fashion, alcohol, and jewelry.

"Richemont launches new beauty division, doubling down on high-end fragrance - Jing Daily","Tue, 12 Sep 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vamluZ2RhaWx5LmNvbS9wb3N0cy9yaWNoZW1vbnQtbGF1bmNoZXMtbmV3LWJlYXV0eS1kaXZpc2lvbi1oaWdoLWVuZC1mcmFncmFuY2XSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"What happened

Following French luxury conglomerate Kering, which formed the Kering Beauté department and acquired niche high-end fragrance Creed earlier this year, Richemont is the latest to venture into the burgeoning luxury fragrance market.

The Swiss group’s new division — Laboratoire de Haute Parfumerie et Beauté — is headed by fragrance veteran Boet Brinkgreve, former president of ingredients and procurement at fragrance manufacturer DSM-Firmenich. Brinkgreve boasts three decades of industry experience and is knowledgeable about the Chinese market. Between 2015 and 2017, he helmed DSM-Firmenich’s China ingredients division.

Brinkgreve took up the role on September 1, reporting directly to Richemont Group chairman Johann Rupert. He is tasked with scaling up the fragrance business across six brands — Montblanc, Van Cleef & Arpels, Cartier, Dunhill, Alaïa, and Chloé — to reach “critical mass in this highly competitive field, where scale is crucial,” said Rupert .

The news sent Interparfums’ shares down 9.4 percent. The fragrance manufacturer produces scents for Richemont’s Dunhill, Van Cleef, and Montblanc. The last two contributed 30 percent of Interparfums’ sales last year. Coty, which makes perfumes for Chloé, is also under threat.

However, according to insiders quoted by BeautyMatter , the creation of the new division does not mean Richemont will bring the fragrance business in-house, but it will maximize the portfolio’s potential.

The Jing Take

The world’s three largest luxury giants, LVMH, Richemont, and Kering, have all established independent beauty and fragrance departments.

In April this year, LVMH Group appointed Stephane Rinderknech, former CEO of L’Oréal Group China, as CEO of its perfume and cosmetics department and announced Veronique Courtois as Dior perfume’s CEO, and the former head of Make Up For Ever, Gabrielle Saint-Genis Rodriguez took over the role of CEO at Guerlain.

Following the reshuffle, LVMH Group perfume and cosmetics department sales reached an outstanding 4.3 billion (31.4 billion RMB) in the first half of this year, a 13 percent year-on-year increase. The revenue contribution of Asia (excluding Japan) reached 34 percent, significantly exceeding that of Europe and North America.

The global beauty and personal care market will grow to 547 billion (4 trillion RMB) in 2027, with the Asia-Pacific region, where China is the main driving force. Image: Weibo screenshot

In June this year, Kering Group announced that Kering Beauté had signed an agreement to acquire high-end niche perfume Creed. According to Reuters, the all-cash transaction could be worth as much as 2.1 billion (15.7 billion RMB).

The French and Swiss behemoths are set on taking a bigger bite of the luxury beauty market. According to Euromonitor International, the global beauty and personal care market will grow to 547 billion (4 trillion RMB) in 2027, with the Asia-Pacific region, where China is the main market, accounting for 67 percent of total growth.

Wine for Putin and tennis with Federer: the life of Bernard Arnault (almost) the world's richest man - The Telegraph,"Fri, 29 Sep 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRlbGVncmFwaC5jby51ay93b3JsZC1uZXdzLzIwMjMvMDkvMjkvbGlmZS1vZi1iZXJuYXJkLWFybmF1bHQtd29ybGRzLXJpY2hlc3QtbWFuLW93bmVyLWx2bWgv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Since then, he has gone on to build the largest luxury goods company in the world, with a market capitalisation of €407 billion. Its portfolio of companies encompasses luxury fashion house Louis Vuitton, jewellery brand Tiffany’s, suitcase line Rimowa and champagne maker Moet & Chandon. In all, LVMH has 75 fashion and cosmetics brands.

That has seen him earn the moniker “the pope of fashion”. But he has other nicknames, notably “the Terminator” for his ruthless habit of mounting raids on companies and ousting their previous owners. It has mostly worked, though he failed in his bid to take over rival family fashion firm Hermès.

Mr Arnault’s holding company Agache backs venture capital firm Aglaé Ventures, which has investments in businesses such as Netflix and TikTok parent company ByteDance.

His huge financial clout has seen him brush shoulders with countless politicians, notably Donald Trump and Emmanuel Macron, who invited him to the banquet for the King and Queen last week at Versailles.

“I’ve personally known every American president since Reagan,” he once said.

He has equally long and strategic relationships with Chinese and Russian leaders.

Case of different vintages

There is a long history between Mr Arnault and Vladimir Putin. Back in 2003, the Russian president was welcomed with great pomp at the Château Cheval-Blanc vineyard in Saint-Emilion, then owned by Mr Arnault and Belgian billionaire Albert Frère.

Putin left with a case of wine of different vintages corresponding to key dates in his life: his birth in 1952, his marriage in 1983, the birth of his children in 1985 and 1986, and finally 2000, the year of his ascension to the Kremlin.

“We need to talk to the Russians,” Mr Arnault told French magazine Paris Match in April 2017.

”The ties between our two countries go beyond political situations. They are historic, eternal.”

Since the start of the war in Ukraine, Mr Arnault has spoken little about the conflict and “temporarily” ceased all LVMH operations in Russia.

But in 2022, he told The Telegraph he believed “the French president is right to keep talking to the Russian president because even in periods like this you have got to keep talking”.

Since then Mr Macron has all but cut off relations with Putin.

Married twice, Mr Arnault is said to have wooed his second wife, Helene Mercier, a Canadian concert pianist, by playing Chopin and other classical composers on the piano.

The tycoon has five children who all hold senior positions at LVMH; in July 2022, he proposed a reorganisation of his holding company Agache to give them equal stakes.

Rather like the Murdoch family, there has been much speculation about who will succeed him.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999239444732666}",neutral,0.9999239444732666,0
