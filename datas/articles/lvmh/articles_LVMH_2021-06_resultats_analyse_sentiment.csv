LVMH Takes Full Control of Italian Fashion House Emilio Pucci - WWD,"Fri, 18 Jun 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3dkLmNvbS9mZWF0dXJlL2x2bWgtcHVjY2ktYWNxdWlyZXMtc2hhcmVzLW93bnMxMjM0ODQ5MDk4LTEyMzQ4NDkwOTgv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton said Friday it now owns 100 percent of Florentine fashion house Emilio Pucci, having bought the 33 percent stake still held by the founding family.

Financial terms were not disclosed.

In tandem with the transaction, Laudomia Pucci will relinquish her role as vice president and image director after more than 20 years in that capacity.

She is to dedicate herself to the archives and promoting the heritage of her late father, Emilio Pucci, who founded the brand in 1947, initially designing skiwear out of jersey fabrics.

“I would like to thank the Pucci family, and Laudomia in particular, for their friendship and collaboration over the years,” Toni Belloni, LVMH’s group managing director, said in a statement. “Laudomia has been a precious guardian of the brand, bringing insight, passion and energy to the teams. We look forward to supporting her work on archives and heritage in the future.”

“I started in 1985, so I’ve been in this business for 36 years, bringing forward my father’s legacy, and with LVMH we’ve had a 21-year run. It’s been a beautiful experience and I am glad I consolidated the company and gave it a future,” she told WWD on Friday. “It’s been fantastic, a long, long ride, but now I want to focus on the more cultural and historical part of the Emilio Pucci brand.”

LVMH took a 67 percent stake in Emilio Pucci SRL in 2000 amid a luxury acquisition spree in Europe. At the time, the Italian company had annual sales of about $10.5 million.

Considered one of Italy’s fashion pioneers in outfitting the jet-set, Emilio Pucci’s colorful, graphic motifs on silk jersey quickly became the signature of the house and were originally derived from Renaissance and local Italian art.

LVMH said recently Pucci would return to its roots as a resort-focused brand after experimenting with a range of creative configurations.

The brand recently took the guest-designer route, inviting Christelle Kocher of France and Japan’s Tomo Koizumi for a season. Earlier this month, Pucci revealed a Supreme collaboration that splashed its bold prints on windbreakers, track pants, hoodies and camp shirts.

There have been a variety of permanent Pucci designers over the years, including Julio Espada, Christian Lacroix, Matthew Williamson, Peter Dundas and MSGM’s Massimo Giorgetti, as well as studio configurations.

While boutiques in New York, Milan and Paris were recently shuttered, it is understood that sales at Pucci boutiques in resort locations have been roaring ahead. These include Saint-Tropez in France, Palm Beach and Miami in the U.S., and Portofino and Capri in Italy. The brand is also popular in Russia and the Middle East, where it boasts boutiques in Dubai and Doha, Qatar.

LVMH opens $894 million luxury shopping destination in Paris - CNN,"Tue, 22 Jun 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vc3R5bGUvYXJ0aWNsZS9sYS1zYW1hcml0YWluZS1sdm1oLW9wZW5pbmcvaW5kZXguaHRtbNIBQWh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLmNubi5jb20vY25uL3N0eWxlL2FydGljbGUvbGEtc2FtYXJpdGFpbmUtbHZtaC1vcGVuaW5n?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Paris CNN —

A historic 19th century landmark, forced to fade into the background along the banks of the river Seine in Paris for 16 years, has been brought out of hibernation and resurrected as a new all-in-one shopping, dining and tourist destination.

Part luxury department store, part hotel and promising to feature over a dozen eateries, the €750 million ($894 million) restoration of La Samaritaine, by French luxury conglomerate LVMH, is one of the most anticipated openings of the year in the French capital: On Monday, French President Emmanuel Macron inaugurated the building, calling it a “wonderful French treasure.”

When Samaritaine Paris Pont-Neuf opens its doors on Wednesday for the first time since closing in 2005 for safety reasons, it will become the newest luxury department store on the Parisian landscape. While Galeries Lafayette is best known for its theatrical balconies and Neo-byzantine glass dome, and Le Bon Marché bills itself as the world’s oldest continually operating department store, Samaritaine Paris Pont-Neuf’s big draw will be its location.

Set in the geographic center of Paris on the Right Bank, across from the oldest stone bridge in the city, Pont Neuf, the heritage building holds prime real estate along the Seine, with the Louvre museum a short five-minute walk away to the west, the Notre Dame Cathedral within walking distance to the east, and the recently opened contemporary art museum Bourse de Commerce-Pinault Collection five minutes straight north.

Speaking at the opening, Eleonore de Boysson, a regional director for DFS Group, the LVMH-owned luxury retail operator for the store, said the neighborhood “will become a very hyped, born again district.”

Meanwhile, the accompanying five-star hotel, Cheval Blanc Paris, along with its four restaurants and Dior spa, will open later on September 7. All 72 rooms and suites offer views overlooking the Seine, for a price – rates start at 1,500 euros ($1,790).

To restore the landmark to its former glory, LVMH and DFS enlisted top international designs firms including Yabu Pushelberg for the interiors; local agency Malherbe Paris for the basement beauty department, billed as the largest of its kind in Europe at 36,600 square feet; and Japanese firm Sanaa for the somewhat controversial undulating glass façade on Rue de Rivoli, which was slammed by critics for resembling a “shower curtain” when plans were first unveiled in 2011.

But, according to architectural historian Jean-François Cabestan, La Samaritaine has always courted controversy and provoked strong reactions.

“La Samaritaine has always been scandalous,” the co-author of the 2015 book “La Samaritaine, Paris” said during a phone interview.

“From the very beginning, the building was flashy with its colorful enamel paneling and use of glass and iron instead of traditional stone.”

Indeed, in striking contrast to the uniformity of nearby Haussmanian buildings, the signs on the façade of the main entrance at Rue de la Monnaie, designed by Frantz Jourdain and completed in 1910, evoke a Paris of the Art Nouveau era, with classic floral motifs and a vintage color scheme of golden yellow, muted blue-greys, greens and golds.

The façade facing the Seine, meanwhile, is a classic example of Art Deco, designed by Henri Sauvage and completed in 1928. The building is classified as a historic monument in France for being an iconic example of both Art Nouveau and Art Deco design, an architectural rarity, said lead historical monument architect Jean-François Lagneau, who worked on the restoration project over the last 11 years.

“It is truly the most representative building of this confrontation of two styles in Paris, which are normally incompatible,” he told CNN.

But it’s upon entering the main hall, flanked by luxury retail brands Fendi and Balenciaga, that the building’s architectural grandeur reveals itself to visitors: a grand, monumental staircase and five central landing rails in “horizon blue” wrought-iron, lead the eye up to unobstructed views of the soaring glass roof. A trip to the top floor’s Voyager restaurant also rewards visitors with 4,575 square feet of masterfully restored peacock frescoes – a classic Art Nouveau motif – originally painted by Jourdain’s son Francis.

Overall, the result is a bright, airy, luminous space that replicates a clear sky. Or, as Cabestan described it, “a cathedral of color, glass and natural light.”

French writer Émile Zola used similar language to describe the fictional department store setting he invented for his 1883 book “The Ladies’ Paradise” with the help of his writer and architect friend Jourdain who provided conceptual sketches. The department store was a bazaar that replaced churches, he wrote, and became the Parisian woman’s new religion.

Neither Zola nor Jourdain knew at the time that, a few years following the book’s publication, businessman Ernest Cognacq would ask Jourdain to help him expand the retail store he had opened in 1870 at Pont Neuf, called La Samaritaine, into the city’s biggest shopping destination.

In its early 20th century heyday, the department store spanned four stores and took up an entire city block to become the biggest in Paris at 538,200 square feet, attracting a working and middle class clientele for its affordable prices and variety of goods. Today, the restoration of the main department store overlooking the Seine is the smallest and, perhaps most selective among its competition, with a floor space of 215,280 square feet. Overall, the store is home to 600 brands, 50 of which will be exclusive to Samaritaine Paris Pont-Neuf.

“I’m proud that we were able to restore the building as Ernest Cognacq and his architect Frantz Jourdain knew it, and I think they’d recognize their building if they saw it now,” Lagneau said.

Though Cabestan applauds the painstaking restoration efforts and the mixed-use concept – the project also includes social housing, offices and a daycare – he points out that the remake stands in stark contrast to the store’s original heritage as a retailer for the average Parisian: it was a place to go for affordable goods and even to be entertained with in-store theatrical and musical performances.

“In a way, it was an opera house for the poor,” he said. “But this is not a shop for the lower class anymore. This will be for tourists and for people with means.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999983310699463}",neutral,0.9999983310699463,0
Could LVMH’s Delphine Arnault become the world’s next richest woman? - Style,"Fri, 25 Jun 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjbXAuY29tL21hZ2F6aW5lcy9zdHlsZS9jZWxlYnJpdHkvYXJ0aWNsZS8zMTM4NTk3L3dpbGwtZGVscGhpbmUtYXJuYXVsdC1pbmhlcml0LWx2bWgtYmlsbGlvbmFpcmUtZGFk0gFxaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAuc2NtcC5jb20vbWFnYXppbmVzL3N0eWxlL2NlbGVicml0eS9hcnRpY2xlLzMxMzg1OTcvd2lsbC1kZWxwaGluZS1hcm5hdWx0LWluaGVyaXQtbHZtaC1iaWxsaW9uYWlyZS1kYWQ?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"While the multibillion-dollar conglomerate is still helmed by Bernard, he gets plenty of help from his family, among them daughter Delphine Arnault, who currently sits on the executive committee of LVMH and is one of two heirs-apparent (the other being her younger brother Antoine) to LVMH.

When it comes to the fashion industry, no family is as powerful as the Arnaults, whose patriarch, Bernard Arnault , is the second wealthiest man in the world after Jeff Bezos , as per Forbes’ Real-Time Billionaires List at the time of writing. The family controls Louis Vuitton Moët Hennessy (LVMH), a luxury goods conglomerate present in the fashion, perfumes and cosmetics, wines and spirits, and watches and jewellery industries, among others.

So what do we know about the luxury heiress?

She was a consultant for McKinsey & Co and worked for John Galliano

Delphine, 46, graduated from the prominent EDHEC Business School in Lille, France, and the London School of Economics. Before taking on a role in the family business, she worked for two years at international consulting firm McKinsey & Co in Paris.

On joining LVMH she took on a development director role under designer John Galliano. After one year, she was appointed as deputy managing director of Christian Dior Couture.

She has a knack for spotting talent

In the industry, Delphine is seen as a nurturer of new talent, with a knack for discovering and recruiting designers. Many of those she’s discovered have gone on to become big names themselves, including Raf Simmons (now co-creative director of Prada) and Nicolas Ghesquière (artistic director of Louis Vuitton).

It was also Delphine who was responsible for the discovery of Marine Serre, the up-and-coming designer now popular among celebrities such as Beyoncé, Adele, Kylie Jenner and Blackpink

She started the LVMH Prize for Young Fashion Designers

In 2014, Delphine launched the LVMH Prize for Young Fashion Designers, a competition with a 300,000 euro (US$211,000) prize and the chance to get mentored by a dedicated LVMH team for one year.

“We had been thinking about doing it for a long time. We think that as the leader of our industry it’s our responsibility to find young talents and to help them grow. That’s the spirit of the prize … It’s something only LVMH can do, to have all these amazing designers who work for LVMH give their opinion and their point of view on the future designers,” she told Surface.

She was once married; she now has a daughter with Xavier Niel

In 2005, Delphine married Italian wine heir Alessandro Vallarino Gancia in one of Europe’s most lavish weddings. The couple reportedly spent US$7 million on their wedding, which was held at the Cathédrale Saint-Jean-Baptiste de Bazas, a French national monument and Unesco World Heritage Site. The reception was held at the Chateau d’Yquem vineyard in Bordeaux, decorated with over 5,000 white roses.

Unfortunately, the marriage did not last and the couple divorced in 2010.

Did LVMH Make or Break Tiffany By Turning It Yellow? - Jing Daily,"Sun, 20 Jun 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiOWh0dHBzOi8vamluZ2RhaWx5LmNvbS9wb3N0cy9sdm1oLXRpZmZhbnlzLXllbGxvdy1icmFuZGluZ9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"According to a UBS survey, China’s local shoppers already see Tiffany & Co. as a “go-to” jewelry store, second only to Cartier. During the Christmas holidays alone, the jewelry brand experienced an over-50-percent sales growth in the local market while online sales soared more than 80 percent.

When the jewelry house unveiled its bold new Acqua Di Parma yellow packaging on Instagram, the internet went into meltdown. A month later, it opened a yellow-themed popup in Beverly Hills without any sign of the brand’s beloved blue.

LVMH is planning to focus more on precious gemstone and gold categories while revamping the 320 worldwide Tiffany boutiques.

When it comes to Tiffany & Co., two things spring to mind: Audrey Hepburn’s leading lady in the film Breakfast at Tiffany's and, of course, the brand’s iconic robin egg blue packaging. Rather than having a signature product, the jeweler relies on its exclusive trademark color as its brand identity. Therefore, LVMH’s recent overhaul of this shade — into a vibrant yellow for April Fool’s Day — was an unexpected jolt.

When the jewelry house unveiled its bold new Acqua Di Parma packaging on Instagram, the internet went into meltdown mode. Then, a month later, it opened a pop-up store in Beverly Hills without any sign of the brand’s beloved blue. Instead, everything — from furniture to shopping bags — was resplendent in yellow.

But that is only one of many transformations Tiffany has undergone since LVMH bought it. In the C-Suite, former CEO Boglioli was replaced by Louis Vuitton executive Anthony Ledru. Meanwhile, Alexandre Arnault — the former CEO of Rimowa and 28-year-old son of LVMH President Bernard Arnault — was appointed executive vice president of communications and products.

Also of note, the brand announced it had made endorsement deals with notorious celebrities like Korean star Rosé, the Chinese actor and singer Jackson Yee, and the British actress Anya Taylor-Joy (for its younger T Collection). Plus, it plans to revamp its 320 Tiffany boutiques worldwide and add more exclusive locations to its portfolio across Asia and Europe.

Tiffany recently joined the LVMH Watches and Jewelry Division, where its stablemates now include Bvlgari, Chaumet, Zenith, Fred, and Tag Heuer. The luxury leader certainly waved its magic wand over the Italian jeweler Bvlgari (acquired by the French conglomerate in 2011), doubling its revenue over the last decade. Now Jing Daily asks, is Tiffany on track to get the same results?

In an era when anything could happen, from cross collaborations to high-tech installations, young spenders are constantly chasing the unexpected. The sudden change of brand identity offers excitement to Tiffany fans, and this transformation is earning impressive online traction. While some local netizens are questioning the new shade, the move has helped the brand look “cool” among Gen Zers. For instance, on Weibo, @mingqixiao commented that “the yellow they used is very fancy.” Indeed, it is well known that Gen Zers appreciate change.

However, Sally Maier Yip, managing director for the Chinese PR & Marketing agency 11K Consulting points out that any branding changes must be considered first. “It's not a wise decision to dilute that iconic heritage image of Tiffany, as this is what Tiffany is known for, and that is why people are buying it,” she told Jing Daily. Therefore, a complete transformation of the logo color would be highly risky for the brand.

Any reshaping period is when a brand’s identity is at its weakest, and currently, this is where Tiffany now precariously sits. As such, ambiguous communication can easily mislead consumers. Jenny Zhang, strategy director at the cross-cultural marketing agency TONG digital, asks: “The problem is, during this transition time, what value will Tiffany hold in the market?”

“If it is a departure from the old, it must balance modernity and heritage,” she adds. Indeed, one of the biggest advantages of Western brands is their legacy — something few local players have. And as much as Gen Z loves change, they are also nostalgic for the past and have a deep respect for traditions, culture, and heritage. The choice of yellow has a story to tell: the LA pop-up store features the historic 130-carat Tiffany Yellow Diamond purchased by founder Charles Lewis Tiffany in 1878. Hence, the bold and fresh lemon-colored pop-up perfectly combines legacy with newness to cater to young spenders.

Either way, given what is at stake, board executives will have a clear vision of what Tiffany & Co. will look like, so they can fully support and market that message. A temporary change may well have exceptional outcomes when it comes to attracting a new demographic.

The jeweler’s merger with the world's biggest luxury conglomerate is expected to accelerate its presence in the China market. According to a UBS survey, local shoppers there already see Tiffany as a go-to jeweler — second only to Cartier. Given its solid fanbase, Tiffany has a proven reputation in the market. During the Christmas period, for example, the brand experienced a 50 percent sales growth in the domestic market (online sales soared by more than 80 percent).

To further boost these sales, Andrea De Santis, associate partner at McKinsey & Co, says that one of LVMH's priorities should be “to redesign price points and assortments to get closer to new customers’ exigencies.” Tiffany’s entry-level silver line (with a price point starting at 150) has helped attract lower-wealth customers. But as Chinese consumers become more sophisticated, Tiffany will need to develop higher offerings and retain its aura of exclusivity to attract local high net worth consumers because, in the long term, cheaper products might harm the brand’s prestigious positioning.

HSBC has found that China will more than double its number of millionaires over the next five years and boost the size of the middle class by almost half — increasing what should be Tiffany’s target consumer base. But the label will need to up its game to cater to this growing cohort of wealthy people. One way LVMH hopes to capture them is by focusing more on the precious gemstone and gold categories these demographics tend to favor. And, with access to the LVMH’s expertise and global supply chain, we should expect Tiffany to expand into new categories like Bvlgari and Cartier did with leather goods or via Arnault’s favorite offering: cross-brand collaborations.

These strategies will take time to implement and may not bring immediate growth, but visible results are expected over the next five years, at least. The conglomerate undoubtedly has the patience and resources to obtain its vision. In a video message to employees, chairman & CEO of LVMH, Bernard Arnault, confirmed this when he said: “We will [also] prioritize Tiffany’s long-term desirability over short-term constraints.”

Undoubtedly, Tiffany has the potential to grow in China, thanks to LVMH’s local market partners and expertise. But to keep staying relevant in the China Mainland, Zhang suggests it must be a forerunner in China, like how “Cartier was one the first luxury jewelry brands to livestream on Taobao.”

The local market has many shopping festivals and channels, but brands do not necessarily need to be present at them all. But Tiffany could gain more by celebrating unconventional days while still aligning with their own brand identity, which would put the luxury Maison in an interesting spot.

And although the color change is expected to be temporary, a brand’s packaging should never be more eye-catching than the product. More worrying is how Tiffany lacks a statement product that is as recognizable as its blue box. These “go-to pieces” are especially needed to acquire new buyers, as a hero product can tap more demographics and increase brand recognition.

Still, the creation of iconic pieces is a time-consuming procedure and needs consistency, and impressive marketing efforts are required. A good example is Burberry's “Bojie” project, which saw it collaborate with young artists to create online art installations related to its Olympia bag.

The LVMH/Tiffany alliance is a clear win-win scenario for both parties. LVMH has further strengthened its supremacy in the 285.1 billion luxury sector, while Tiffany is now predicted to dominate its closest rival, Cartier. “I have no doubt they will succeed, as they know the spaces and the partnership,” states Zhang. Indeed, if LVMH can provide Tiffany with the resources and expertise to accelerate its growth, the French conglomerate may pose a significant threat to its jewelry counterpart.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9998453855514526}",neutral,0.9998453855514526,0
The LVMH game plan for La Samaritaine - Vogue Business,"Mon, 21 Jun 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZvZ3VlYnVzaW5lc3MuY29tL2NvbnN1bWVycy90aGUtbHZtaC1nYW1lLXBsYW4tZm9yLWxhLXNhbWFyaXRhaW5l0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"For Samaritaine, targeting locals has always been at the heart of the plan, says de Boysson — even before international travel stagnated during the pandemic. “One could say it’s difficult to draw tourists and Parisians alike,” she says. “But it’s quite the opposite: they are complementary. It’s important for us that Parisians come back to this place that is so special to them, that they first come out of curiosity and return because they find the experience amazing. This is also what will make the tourists come [to] an iconic and authentic place where Parisians go.”

The variety of restaurants is a key differentiator, as well as a selection of edgy brands in the multi-brand spaces on the rue de Rivoli side of the store, according to the executives. De Boysson also believes the new-look store reflects the innovative, ebullient spirit and tone of voice of its founders Ernest Cognacq and Marie-Louise Jay — as she puts it, a spirit that is “playful, joyful, generous and inclusive”.

“La Samaritaine is also the place where we used to go to buy screws when I was a kid,” recalls Nicolas Bos, chief executive of Richemont-owned Van Cleef & Arpels, which is among the brands at La Samaritaine. “So I think a lot of Parisians will want to go back. The place is incredible. I think the Parisians want these magnificent buildings on the Seine back.”

La Samaritaine is swimming against an industry trend, firstly by opening a department store at a time when physical retail is in limbo, and secondly by preferring a wholesale model over concessions. “Nowadays, luxury brands want to control the distribution, and therefore they are focused on their own physical and online retail and on selected physical and digital concessions,” says Mario Ortelli, managing director of Ortelli & Co. “This is a challenge for a wholesaler like La Samaritaine to attract brands and to be perceived by consumers as unique.”

La Samaritaine can still win out, he notes, thanks to its status, location and prized position within the LVMH universe, enabling it to attract established brands and to be a “selection master”.

“I think that unique landmark locations can work under the department store model,” Bernstein analyst Luca Solca says. “I am thinking of Harrods as an example.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9998584985733032}",neutral,0.9998584985733032,0
LVMH Forges Partnership With Google Cloud to Bolster Digital Arsenal - WWD,"Wed, 16 Jun 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3dkLmNvbS9mZWF0dXJlL2x2bWgtc3RyaWtlcy1kZWFsLWdvb2dsZS1jbG91ZC10by1yYW1wLXVwLWFpLWVmZm9ydHMtMTIzNDg0NjIwNC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS — LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton has forged a strategic partnership with Google Cloud centered on artificial intelligence, throwing down the gauntlet as the luxury industry races to shore up its digital arsenal for a post-pandemic era.

Aimed at speeding up the development of cloud-based AI solutions to scale up LVMH brands, the deal covers issues ranging from demand forecasting to personalizing offers for clients, and includes the launch of a “Data and AI Academy” to share expertise.

“This new, unprecedented and significant partnership with Google Cloud is the reflection of our high ambitions in this area,” said Toni Belloni, group managing director of LVMH, in a joint statement. “By combining our best-in-class approaches in our respective industries, it will take us a step forward in the use of data and AI,” he added.

“Together we can help drive the future of customer experience in the luxury industry,” said Thomas Kurian, chief executive officer of Google Cloud.

LVMH will also draw on the partnership to update its IT infrastructure with a view to “fostering the agility, security, cost efficiency and performance at scale required to support its business ambitions,” according to the statement.

While LVMH has been working on subjects related to data and AI for the past three or four years — particularly in the realm of client relations, but also related to supply chains and production — the pandemic has sped up the issue, noted Franck Le Moal, IT director for LVMH.

“For the past 14 months, something happened that we didn’t expect — it’s true,” said Le Moal, speaking to WWD through Zoom.

The executive recalled that the luxury industry was faced with a challenge it hadn’t seen before — shifting to an omnichannel format from one day to the next. This called for daily interaction between sales people and clients, as well as drawing up extra services using data, he explained.

“We understood that we could go even further with better use of client data,” he said.

Le Moal cited Sephora, Louis Vuitton and Dior as leaders in the group in some areas, with Vuitton and Sephora employing machine learning to improve the efficiency of sales previsions, adjust production and improve merchandising.

“We thought that if we are able to do such things with these three labels, we must be capable of doing something through a significant investment at the group level, with the technological means, talent, a center of expertise, global data computing, we can offer these services and accelerators in the other houses,” the executive said.

Asked why the group chose to work with Google Cloud, Le Moal cited the possibility of codeveloping algorithms and components of artificial intelligence and machine learning directly with the company’s labs in Mountain View, Calif.

The partnership includes a training and education program centered on data, for executives working on issues like merchandising, client relations and omnichannel services, for example, according to the executive.

“We want to help our managers understand data, the use of artificial intelligence and machine learning more quickly,” he said. Such programs will be available virtually, as well as physically, perhaps at Station F.

The number of employees working on issues related to the digital realm at LVMH has grown significantly in five years — with a notable acceleration over the past two — noted the executive.

Asked to highlight some key areas where the partnership could make a difference, Le Moal cited increased personalization when it comes to offering the right product or look; merchandising with an eye to drawing up the right product assortments for a store; improving the accuracy of sales forecasts, and managing production.

“Our production system is very sophisticated and complicated, we use high-quality materials so the more accurate we are with sales forecasts, the better we will be able to adapt the materials we need,” he added, drawing a link to improving the environmental impact of the process.

The same goes for distribution, he noted.

“We are increasingly vigilant when it comes to the environment, we are increasingly vigilant when it comes to supply chains, transport — of course, we will use data to be as pertinent as possible — why send merchandise to a region where it won’t sell?”

“The power of data to help us adjust our commercial potential and distribution potential to make sure we have the right product in the right store and minimize returns and transfers — we think this can have a direct impact, and it’s starting to have a direct impact on some of our brands,” the executive explained.

Asked about sharing data between the brands, each label is in charge of its client data, the only sharing between houses would be anonymous data, like what kind of client likes a certain type of product, for example — no names or addresses, the executive stressed.

“We don’t want a client of Louis Vuitton, from one day to the next, to become a client of Dior Couture — the brands remain in a silo,” he said.

When it comes to the design process, marketing and design teams have access to data as “complementary information,” he said, like what worked well and what didn’t, why something worked well and what kind of client purchased a certain type of product.

LVMH Reopens a Parisian Landmark - Beverly Hills Courier,"Thu, 24 Jun 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vYmV2ZXJseWhpbGxzY291cmllci5jb20vMjAyMS8wNi8yNC9sdm1oLXJlb3BlbnMtYS1wYXJpc2lhbi1sYW5kbWFyay_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Cheval Blanc Beverly Hills is a few years away yet. But an advance look at the five-star hotel experience from luxury conglomerate LVMH is available at the Cheval Blanc Paris this fall. The property is but one of the showstoppers of the revitalized Samaritaine Paris Pont-Neuf project unveiled in the City of Light on June 21.

La Samaritaine, the legendary 100-plus-year-old Paris department store, is the centerpiece, as well as namesake of the project. Snuggled on the banks of the Seine, near Notre-Dame Cathedral and the Louvre, it is renowned, among other things, for its 1920s-era Art Deco façade, imposing iron and glass roof and gold leaf-adorned central staircase. It is an historic monument in France, a testament to both Art Nouveau and Art Deco design. Inside lies 215,000 square feet of shopping space, plus a window into day-to-day Parisian life. Closed since 2005 for safety reasons, it has been sorely missed by residents and visitors alike.

LVMH has spent the last seven years on a grand makeover, transforming Samaritaine from a classic department store to the anchor of a mixed-use urban experience. An undulating glass façade now greets visitors on the Rue de Rivoli, designed by Japanese firm Sanaa. The Pritzker Prize-winning firm is also responsible for 343 exterior screen-printed glass panels. The reimagined Samaritaine Paris Pont-Neuf department store will feature 600 brands, new concept stores “Loulou” and “Rivoli,” 12 restaurants, the “Voyage” space combining gastronomy, art and “memorable experiences,” L’Appartement, a private shopping experience amidst artwork, plus the largest beauty space on the Continent.

The timing of the June 21 unveiling was auspicious, coming shortly after Europe lifted the ban on non-essential travel by foreigners. Tourism in France – and elsewhere – is still in need of a jump start. And retail as a whole was already suffering globally, even before the pandemic. The bold new Samaritaine complex, with its hotel, restaurants, office space and more, is expected to become a destination in and of itself.

It is no surprise then, that no less than French President Emmanuel Macron attended the inaugural ceremony, along with Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo and Bernard Arnault, chairman and chief executive officer of LVMH. LVMH already owns upscale Parisian department store Le Bon Marche, as well as a majority stake in luxury travel retailer DFS Group, which operates La Samaritaine.

“No other department store has such compelling links to the two faces of Paris, one engaged with the historic economic vitality of the recently renovated Les Halles and the other overlooking the Seine, offering the most beautiful view of the world’s most beautiful city. The completion of this project, which both creates jobs and promotes a unique Parisian art de vivre around the world, is also a great source of pride for our Group in France and in Paris. Many of our Maisons were founded in Paris, where we intend to make an active contribution to economic recovery, as well as the worldwide appeal of France,” said Arnault.

The entire Samaritaine Paris Pont-Neuf project is a model of forward-thinking mixed-use planning. In addition to the department store and hotel, structures include a nursery and 96 public housing units operated by Paris Habitat. A pedestrian square with access to the Pont Neuf will help with a hoped-for renaissance of the neighborhood between the Louvre and Les Halles.

In total, the development included some 753,000 square feet of renovated or newly built space. Cheval Blanc Paris is a key component. The first urban hotel from LVMH faces Quai du Louvre and will welcome guests on Sept. 7. Interiors of its 72 rooms and suites were created by American architect and designer Peter Marino, who has transformed an Art Deco building overlooking the Seine.

Marino also has the commission to design Cheval Blanc Beverly Hills for LVMH. The ultra-luxury hospitality, retail and dining project is expected to open on Rodeo Drive in 2025. Plans call for an innovative, yet classic 115-guestroom bespoke hotel, as well as ground-floor LVMH retail establishments and exclusive dining venues. Additional features include rooftop pools, a private club and expansive penthouse space.

During the June 21 Paris inaugural, executives noted that it may take one or two years for tourists to fully return to France. Once things get back to normal, La Samaritaine is expected to attract some 5 million visitors per year. With any luck, many of them will also make their way to Beverly Hills.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999982118606567}",neutral,0.9999982118606567,0
"Food is a tough business. So why are Dior, LVMH jumping in? - Vogue Business","Mon, 21 Jun 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZvZ3VlYnVzaW5lc3MuY29tL2NvbnN1bWVycy9mb29kLWlzLWEtdG91Z2gtYnVzaW5lc3Mtc28td2h5LWFyZS1kaW9yLWx2bWgtanVtcGluZy1pbtIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"To receive the Vogue Business newsletter, sign up here.

When Browns opened its new flagship store along London’s Brook Street in April, the fashion retailer also unveiled its very first branded restaurant. Native at Browns serves miso fish soup, fermented potato waffles and caramelised honey and seaweed truffles, among other dishes. It also serves up something more valuable to Browns: foot traffic.

After a year in which the pandemic forced everyone into isolation, “people want to talk more face to face”, says Paul Brennan, Browns’ managing director. The restaurant is designed to tap into that desire, with the expectation that visitors will also shop. Indeed, the restaurant has accounted for a third of visitors across the store in the first two months of opening.

Fashion retail is betting heavily on onsite restaurants to attract visitors who may be tired of shopping online or who are looking for more of an experience than simply making a purchase as the world reemerges from pandemic lockdowns. Restaurants will be a major component of the new La Samaritaine, the LVMH department store reopening in Paris after 15 years, including seafood restaurant Langosteria, located in the Cheval Blanc Paris hotel. In the UK, reformed planning restrictions have made it easier for restaurants to open in retail spaces, a move that’s emboldening retailers, says Addy Williams, senior retail portfolio manager at Shaftesbury PLC, the real estate investment trust that invests in London’s West End.

Food helps bring in extra revenue, as restaurants can operate outside of retail hours, says Williams. But food is low margin, trend based and, as any restaurant owner will tell you, fickle. Slapping a brand on the sign is never enough. Café Dior by Pierre Hermé in Tokyo closed in May 2020 after three years in business. Still, that isn’t stopping the brand from reinvesting in the restaurant industry. When Dior’s headquarters reopen in Paris following renovations, it will feature a restaurant helmed by chef Jean Imbert. Gucci is opening its third Osteria da Massimo Bottura on the fourth floor of a new Tokyo store later this year. In March, Louis Vuitton opened its second Le Café V, adding a fresh twist to its revamped Ginza Namiki store, also in Tokyo.

The openings show the resilience of these luxury brands, says Pippa Stephens, retail analyst at GlobalData. They send a message “that they are able to put that money into it which they wouldn’t be able to do if they were struggling”, she said, as the different nature of management and logistics make food a particular challenge for fashion retail to make work. It’s still worth the risk, she adds. “It will bring customers in who are expected to spend more on leisure and social activities. Experiential retail has been massive in stores in order to stop people from shifting completely to buying fashion online.” After a year that forced customers to shop online, stores see hospitality as a comeback play.



Melissa Xides, vice president of customer experience at Bergdorf Goodman, agrees. In October, the New York City retailer opened BG on Fifth, a 36-seat café along Fifth Avenue anchoring the flagship’s main entrance. While the café shares dishes with the seventh-floor BG Restaurant, including $24 duck dumplings and $41 lobster salad, it offers a much different experience because of its street-level location.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.999991774559021}",neutral,0.999991774559021,0

The startup last week said it closed a Series B funding round with an investment of $120 million from Salesforce Ventures and Blackstone. On Thursday, the firm announced that Arnault’s venture investment arm, Aglaé Ventures, was also part of the latest funding round, alongside US billionaire Howard Schultz, who served 14 years as CEO and chairman of Starbucks.

Arnault is the chair and CEO of LVMH, the world’s largest luxury goods business, and the chair of its holding company, Christian Dior SE.

According to Forbes Real-Time Billionaire’s List, Arnault held the title on Thursday of the world’s richest man, with a fortune estimated at $193 billion.

Wiz, founded in early 2020 by the team that previously led Microsoft Azure’s Cloud Security Group, has raised to date a total of $350 million and is valued at $1.7 billion, the statement said.

Laudomia Pucci, the company’s image director, will step down following the deal, the publication reports.

LVMH has held a majority stake in the brand, which is known for its bold, colourful prints since 2000, but the label remains one of the smallest in its portfolio. The luxury giant is assuming full control after a period in which it’s struggled to find a clear direction.

The house has been without a creative director since Massimo Giorgetti departed in 2017.

Previous designers at Pucci’s helm have included Matthew Williamson, Christian Lacroix and Peter Dundas. Meanwhile it’s undergone a broader executive reorganisation, with chief executive Mauro Grimaldi leaving the company in early 2019 after four years.

More recently, Pucci has experimented with guest collaborators, including Christelle Kocher and Tomotaka Koizumi, in a strategy reminiscent of Moncler’s Genius format. It has also reorganised its business to focus more on resort wear, a core category for the brand, steering its retail footprint towards boutiques in resort hotspots such as Saint Tropez in France, Capri in Italy and Dubai.

Earlier this month, it announced a collaboration with Supreme, featuring sports jerseys, shirts and accessories with prints from the maison’s archives.

Will Fosun Fashion Group Be China's LVMH? - Jing Daily,"Thu, 10 Jun 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vamluZ2RhaWx5LmNvbS9wb3N0cy9mb3N1bi1mYXNoaW9uLWdyb3VwLWNoaW5hLWFjcXVpc2l0aW9uLXNlcmdpby1yb3NzadIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"What happened

Fosun Fashion Group, a global luxury fashion platform based in China, has signed an agreement to acquire 100 percent of Sergio Rossi S.p.A. The transaction is expected to close during the summer and will not change the high-end shoemaker’s current leadership. This marks Fosun’s second Italian acquisition after Caruso and its first vertically integrated luxury accessories brand, adding to its robust portfolio that includes St. John, Wolford, and Lanvin.

The Jing Take

With just eight directly operated stores in mainland China and four in Hong Kong, Sergio Rossi has room to grow. In fact, the Italian fashion house, which was previously owned by Kering and then Investindustrial, only opened its first online store in China in April 2020. Now, by joining forces with Fosun, the footwear brand could see more resources to ramp up expansion in the market, from strengthening local teams, to reinforcing its digital business, to increasing marketing spend.

For Fosun, the takeover solidifies its status as “one of the first movers to create a global luxury fashion group in China.” According to the company , the acquisition “not only completes a more well-rounded strategic brand ecosystem for [Fosun], but also creates potential synergies between brands through Sergio Rossi's fully owned and state-of-the-art factory.” This comes after an alliance with e-commerce firm Baozun and marketing solutions provider Activation Group, which bolsters Fosun’s ability to help brands execute their China strategies. Given this mega partnership, it’s unlikely the Mamp;A crusade will end here.

That said, there’s still much to do before Fosun can go head-to-head with global luxury conglomerates like LVMH, which controls 75 prestigious brands across six categories, or Gucci’s parent Kering. But where Fosun shines is where others often struggle; as more players move in on what will be luxury’s largest market, the Shanghai-based company already has home field advantage, offering its brands a full spectrum of services to thrive locally.

LVMH Sets Up Employee Support Fund - WWD,"Tue, 08 Jun 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3dkLmNvbS9mZWF0dXJlL2x2bWgtY3JlYXRlcy1lbXBsb3llZS1zdXBwb3J0LWZ1bmQtc3RhcnRpbmctd2l0aC0zMC1taWxsaW9uLWV1cm9zLTEyMzQ4MzY5MzYv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS — LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton has put 30 million euros into a global support fund for employees facing difficulties, a move that comes as high-profile luxury companies double up efforts on social and environmental issues, which have gained increasing attention with the public — and consumers — since the arrival of the pandemic.

Open to all of the group’s 150,000 employees around the world, the “LVMH Heart Fund” seeks to offer help with urgent situations as well as daily issues, including a free, confidential hotline.

“This move is a good way to continue our long-term commitment — we have multiplied initiatives in the realm of social responsibility over the past 15 years, not because it’s fashionable to do so, but because we believe in the importance of having a company that is engaged — with society, with local and regional partners and employees. I believe this creates a virtuous cycle,” said Chantal Gaemperle, executive vice president, human resources and synergies at LVMH, in a Zoom call with WWD.

The executive explained that the idea was drawn up following a period of consultation last summer with employees about how they were faring during the pandemic. The exercise didn’t turn up urgent situations that needed to be addressed, but rather threw the spotlight on how much employees valued an employer that was involved in social matters.

“We conducted a survey with employees worldwide,” Gaemperle said. The “Pulse” survey was done in 14 languages over three weeks, with the goal of sending a “we care” signal to employees, the executive added.

“We would like to know how you are getting through this crisis, how you are doing,” she recalled asking.

“Learning happens during crises,” she said, noting that the group asked employees to relay to the group what had struck them at the time, and what they considered important.

“This survey showed us — once again— that subjects of social responsibility, of diversity and inclusion, and engagement in a larger sense — and the LVMH group had been exemplary early on, making hand sanitizer and masks, for example, showing a certain agility, too, taking part as a stakeholder during this crisis — employees confirmed they considered this essential and said they were proud to work for a group like LVMH,” she said. The executive added that this applied to the brand and group level.

LVMH jumped in to help the French government equip health care workers with surgical masks last year during initial stages of the coronavirus outbreak, drawing on its global distribution network to procure them.

The luxury goods group also repurposed perfume factories to produce hand sanitizer.

“The percentage of pride in being part of the LVMH group rose higher,” Gaemperle said. The executive added that the survey served as a concrete illustration that such engagement held meaning for employees and clients.

“This is the virtuous cycle that I mentioned — this is what encouraged us to launch the heart fund,” she said.

“The crisis also highlighted our fragility — it can hit anyone,” she said. Sometimes existing support is insufficient, she added, rattling off scenarios such as an emergency linked to the environment, a medical emergency or death, or psychological illness.

“We thought, how can we quickly help our employees — this was the idea behind the heart fund,” she said.

“We also think of LVMH being at the heart of the group,” Gaemperle added.

“The crisis — in a general sense, not just with LVMH — revealed the need for leadership with a caring approach,” she added, describing current times as a “soft-skills leadership era.”

“With Zoom calls, suddenly we were entering people’s homes,” she noted, adding there was exposure to personal and psychological considerations.

“I believe that the leaders who were followed during the crisis were ones that had an attitude that reflected interest in their employees, showing support and solidarity — this was very strong,” Gaemperle said.

“We discovered that employees had loads of things to tell us; we were told ‘involve us,’” she added.

Work methods changed dramatically during the pandemic, she noted.

“At the human resources level, we are also actors in this transformation in the way of working,” Gaemperle observed.

Asked if it could serve as a recruiting tool, she noted that beyond the realm of a group’s employees, consumers also pay attention to what companies do.

“It has to be an authentic approach — people won’t pardon you if it’s just corporate speech,” she said, ticking off a list of efforts at the group, like increasing the proportion of women employees in key positions from 23 percent to 44 percent.

“It’s important for our clients, for future talents of the group — people will look at the reputation of the employer, not just the reputation of the brand, but what is behind the brand, what are the values, the practices — human resources is very important,” she said.

The executive noted she has had hard questions from potential employees.

“I have often had senior executives asking me during an interview ‘There aren’t many of women on the executive committee, what are you doing about it?’ So it’s important for attracting talent, but it’s also important for keeping and motivating employees.

“The group counts 150,000 employees, if they’re all a bit more motivated and a bit more proud, it can have an important effect on performance,” she said, noting that stronger engagement from employees also adds to LVMH’s reputation outside the group.

“Luxury also means generosity, this is something that is personally important to me,” the executive added.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.999026894569397}",neutral,0.999026894569397,0
How LVMH Jewelry Brand FRED Conquered China - Jing Daily,"Wed, 09 Jun 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiN2h0dHBzOi8vamluZ2RhaWx5LmNvbS9wb3N0cy9sdm1oLWZyZWQtY2VvLWNoYXJsZXMtbGV1bmfSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"China has been a bright spot for FRED for quite a while, and it saw a significant increase in sales in the French, Italian, and Korean markets.

In 2020, China represented approximately 25 percent of FRED’s global sales, and its expansion has been very rapid.

FRED is one of the first LVMH-owned Maisons to have debuted a flagship store on Tmall. It serves as a powerful online shopping site but also a vibrant information platform that reaches a large youth audience in China.

There is a terrific portfolio of powerful jewelry brands under the auspices of LVMH, beginning with Bvlgari, Tiffany & Co., and Chaumet. But it all became part of LVMH after FRED — the first jewelry brand bought by the French luxury group when it grabbed total shares of the brand in 1996. And surprisingly, this popular jewelry brand managed to gain massive momentum in China last year when the pandemic was at its peak.

FRED did good business in 2020 simply because its luxury ownership decided to become fully involved in its branding. In fact, the brand sailed through the market storm of the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, achieving an astonishing figure of €100 million in sales globally.

In an exclusive interview with Jing Daily, we caught up with Charles Leung, the CEO of FRED Paris, to find out more about the brand's history, how it's catering to the taste of young Chinese consumers, and more.

With its roots and feel for the French Riviera spirit, the House is a bold, visionary jewelry brand that has made iconic and top-quality jewels since its founding in 1936. FRED always seeks to push the envelope of contemporary jewelry.

Today, the brand is represented by its three distinctive collections, each with its own stories that illustrate FRED’s philosophy and values while appealing to either sex. They are the Force 10 buckle , inspired by the sea and sailing, Chance Infinie , based on the number ‘8’ to embody good fortune and femininity, and Pretty Woman , which explores the unlimited facets of modern love. Women and men wear them for engagements and weddings but also to celebrate any occasion in life.

Last year, our focus was heavily on China, and we put most of our marketing investments into digital and social media platforms in China. Those were accompanied by the launch of our flagship store on Tmall Luxury Pavilion and a WeChat store in April of 2020 as the country was coming out its darkest time. This strategy allowed us to reach out to a larger target base through “friends of the brand” artists who share the same values as FRED. Our lines were also energized by some colorful and easy-to-wear novelties, including a special Force 10 buckle, which was sold exclusively online to benefit China’s Special Olympics Association . A new advertising campaign called “Live the Joy” was also launched shortly before summer in an attempt to reinforce FRED’s distinctiveness among other jewelry houses.

We’ve also been able to expand quickly into different cities, thanks to our initiative of directly opening stores last year in cities like Hangzhou, Shenyang, and Qingdao. Right before the onset of Chinese New Year 2021, we opened our third boutique in Beijing in the form of a completely new store concept, positioned as our national flagship store and featuring a special zone dedicated to men’s jewels. While many luxury brands were impacted by the pandemic, China remained a bright spot for FRED, and we even made a positive start in 2020 versus 2019 — an exceptional feat for the sector.

Overall, China represented approximately 25 percent of FRED’s global sales in 2020, and that expansion was very rapid. In terms of last year's e-commerce, we made a presence by launching exclusive e-commerce stores on large platforms like Tmall, which serve as powerful online shopping sites but also vibrant information platforms that reach out to huge young audiences. Tmall was one of our top five online stores in China last year and allowed us to recruit and learn so much about new clients in the country.

But we couldn't accelerate the pace of our physical stores opening in China as much as we would have liked as the search for appropriate projects takes time and care. We’re encountering a much stronger demand in China but we would never compromise what we believe in — top-quality products.

FRED has always been known for its pioneering designs of contemporary jewelry having a youthful and French-Riviera style. In China, we’ve stayed true to what the brand stands for, and that is how we’ve been able to attract first-time buyers in Tier-1 cities like Shanghai and Beijing since 2015. These two cities are strategically important for their young, well-traveled customers, who often look for top-quality French jewelry.

As part of our expansion, we’ve reached other Tier-1 and Tier-2 cities over the 12 months, like Guangzhou and Chengdu, at the best shopping malls, with more cities to be added later. As a market “latecomer,” we’ve been very impressed by the openness and warmth shown by Chinese customers, and working with a high-profile A-list star like Guan Xiaotong as our Pretty Woman collection ambassador has helped attract and recruit more fans.

We’ve just launched our “Pretty Woman” jewelry collection, which is dedicated to women who dare to love in their own ways, as well as a revisit of FRED’s high jewelry legacy, particularly for our heart-shaped stones. To promote that collection, we will stage private events and presentations in different cities, starting with the opening ceremony of our new flagship store in Beijing Wangfu Central and followed by a pop-up café crossover at Laduree in Tokyo Ba-Tsu Gallery in the Omotesando area and a themed party at the iconic Bar83 at Sydney Tower.

In 2021, we will add ten new retail stores to our growing network, six of which will be in China, with the other two in South Korea. We will also re-enter Singapore and unveil a new flagship boutique in Dubai. But as always, we are committed to curbing the energy consumption of all our stores — which are already among the lowest in the luxury industry — as part of our sustainability mission.

Although the convenience of e-shopping has become a successful trend, especially in China due to its sophisticated e-commerce platforms and payment systems, we do not believe that e-commerce can ever completely replace brick-and-mortar stores. We’re proud that our stores are praised for their inclusive and inviting environments.

Our founder, Fred Samuel, loved to befriend movie stars and artists throughout his life, including Pablo Picasso and Grace Kelly. They helped raise awareness and desirability of the brand the world over. Today, stars like Yang Mi, Fan Chengcheng, Olivia Wang, Orfila Wu, and Elvis Han have become more than just clients. They’re now “friends of the brand.” We also love to team up with athletes who have common values with FRED. Surfers, boxers, footballers, tennis players, and the former Olympic medalist in gymnastics Li Xiaopeng all own and wear Force 10 bracelets. And alongside Li, FRED works to raise public awareness and funding for mentally challenged athletes in China.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9999561309814453}",positive,0.9999561309814453,1
LVMH Partners with Eastman for Sustainable Cosmetics Packaging Solutions - ESG Today,"Tue, 01 Jun 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVzZ3RvZGF5LmNvbS9sdm1oLXBhcnRuZXJzLXdpdGgtZWFzdG1hbi1mb3Itc3VzdGFpbmFibGUtY29zbWV0aWNzLXBhY2thZ2luZy1zb2x1dGlvbnMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LVMH Perfumes & Cosmetics announced today a collaboration with specialty materials provider Eastman to develop sustainable packaging solutions for LVMH’s family of brands, based on Eastman’s molecular recycling technologies.

A division of leading luxury company LVMH, LVMH Perfumes & Cosmetics’ brands include Parfums Christian Dior, Parfums Givenchy, Guerlain, Benefit Cosmetics, Fresh and Make Up For Ever. According to the company, the new initiative aligns with LVMH Group’s sustainability commitments, which include eliminating fossil-based virgin plastic in packaging by 2026, with an interim 2023 goal to strengthen sustainable materials efforts.

Hélène Valade, LVMH Environmental Development Director, said:

“Eastman’s innovative molecular recycling technologies are playing a crucial role in helping LVMH achieve our sustainability targets. We are at the very beginning of our journey to meet our targets. With our first deadline in 2023, we need solutions that are available now and at a global scale, ensuring our customers experience these benefits immediately.”

Eastman’s recently introduced line of molecularly recycled technologies break down waste into its molecular building blocks so it can be reused, creating resins that are chemically indistinguishable from their legacy counterparts. The technologies divert waste plastic from landfills, give waste plastic new life, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions relative to traditional production.

According to LVMH, the collaboration will kick off with Eastman’s Cristal Renew copolyester, with 30% certified recycled content, being introduced on Dior Addict Lip Maximizer packaging this summer, and the company anticipates rolling out more sustainable packaging solutions across its brands over the next several months.

Livestream Shopping Start-up Bambuser Gets LVMH Innovation Prize - WWD,"Fri, 18 Jun 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiQFodHRwczovL3d3ZC5jb20vYnVzaW5lc3MtbmV3cy90ZWNobm9sb2d5L3ZpdmF0ZWNoLWJlcm5hcmQtYXJuYXVsdC1saXZlLXN0cmVhbS1zaG9wcGluZy1zdGFydHVwLWJhbWJ1c2VyLWx2bWgtaW5ub3ZhdGlvbi1wcml6ZS0xMjM0ODQ5OTUyL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS — Bambuser, a start-up that specializes in livestream shopping, has won the annual innovation award of LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton for 2021, signaling the channel is on the rise.

The luxury group took to the stage at Vivatech for its fifth annual awards ceremony — resuming the tradition after last year’s event was shifted online due to pandemic lockdowns.

Among changes to the show format was the master of ceremonies, with an actress picking up the role, accompanied by live cello music from the stage. She kicked off with a brief monologue evoking the personal trials and tribulations of start-up life — and the moment things take a new turn when “One day, LVMH steps in.”

LVMH stepped in, in more ways than one, reconfiguring its jury process by adding a layer of internal executives to form a selection committee to head the various prize categories. Officials at the group said the change was meant to ensure that winning start-ups are aligned with LVMH’s priorities, and that jury members would then act as internal mentors for the finalists.

The selection committee members, along with LVMH chairman and chief executive officer Bernard Arnault and group managing director Toni Belloni, chose the main winner.

Earlier stages of the selection process entail a vote from some 300 employees, venture capitalists and members of the press, who list their top 10 picks — this is how the pool of 850 applicants was whittled down to 28.

Executives presiding over each category, including the group’s environmental director Hélène Valade and chief omnichannel director Michael David, fanned across the stage, stepping forward to announce the finalists — winners of each category.

These included Data&Data, a start-up that analyzes volumes of transactions to help luxury companies sharpen marketing; Each One, which links refugees and migrants carrying work papers to multinational companies; game publisher Aglet that has sneaker fans competing for limited-edition virtual sneakers from top labels, reusable packaging specialist Hipli and Galy, which grows cotton from cells in bioreactors.

“Before the pandemic, we always said the more time we spend online the more premium in-person experiences become, it’s definitely the case, I think we’re all ready to get back to being together,” remarked Ian Rogers, the group’s former chief digital officer who presided over the ceremony in the past, but has since moved on to a startup himself — in the realm of crypto currencies.

In a brief, pre-recorded speech projected on a screen, Arnault apologized for not being there in person, and pledged to come next year. Scribbling on a piece of paper, he tucked it into a blue envelope and pushed it toward the camera, saying “here’s the winner.”

But not long after the awards ceremony finished, the executive popped up in real life to browse the group’s sprawling booth at the Vivatech fair. Accompanied by his son Alexandre Arnault, the luxury titan made several stops, checking out the fabric resale platform Nona Source, Hublot’s digital warranty certificate system, Dior’s virtual try-on application — which sticks a visor over a person’s image on the screen — and a connected watch at Tag Heuer and packaging at Hipli. He also exchanged with Bambuser chief commercial officer Sophie Abrahamsson, who offered him a demonstration before they posed together for a photo.

Bambuser helps retailers with live video shopping, a trend that started off in China around 2018, according to Abrahamsson. The start-up touts the channel as useful for building communities, allowing retailers to host shows with staff or external experts, while consumers can interact with comments and likes. Retailers can also use the medium to drive transactions through discounts, promotion codes and exclusive offers.

Asked what he was most excited about at this year’s edition, Arnault enthused, “The winner — it’s terrific.”

“See you Monday,” someone called out as he began heading away from the booth. Arnault paused.

“Monday — it’s the big day for La Samaritaine,” he answered, moving out into the maze of the fair, his entourage in tow.

LVMH inaugurates its La Samaritaine complex next week, the culmination of a 750-million-euro refurbishment project that has lasted over a decade.

Ott will report directly to the Consortium’s Board of Directors.

Ott spent 13 years of her career at Kering, latterly as CEO of the Tomas Maier fashion house and previously as director of strategy at its Gucci and Balenciaga brands. She also holds a doctorate in consumer behavior.

“I am thrilled to join Aura Blockchain Consortium, a visionary collaboration initiated by LVMH, Prada Group and Cartier, to drive change in the luxury industry by addressing the shared challenges of communicating authenticity, responsible sourcing and sustainability in a secure digital format,” said Daniela Ott.

Ott’s mission at Aura is to make blockchain accessible for all brands and push forward existing standards for traceability in the supply chain.

Potential future expansion of the Consortium is certainly within Ott’s vision. After recently being approached by a luxury furniture maker, Ott mentioned the possibility of broadening operations from leather goods, watches and jewelry to perfume, luxury wines, cars and yachts, talking to Women’s Wear Daily.

Initially developed in 2019 by LVMH , it was joined by fashion conglomerates Prada Group and Richemont’s Cartier to create the consortium earlier this year. The solution is a blockchain system that allows consumers to access product history and proof of authenticity of luxury goods. Since its founding, additional objectives of responsible sourcing and sustainability have been added as these are increasingly demanded by discerning consumers.

Bulgari, Cartier, Hublot, Louis Vuitton and Prada are already members of the consortium, with Ott revealing that two brands will be onboarded in the coming months.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9987161159515381}",neutral,0.9987161159515381,0
"Luxury's Brick-and-Mortar Comeback: Let's Get Physical, Physical - Jing Daily","Fri, 25 Jun 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vamluZ2RhaWx5LmNvbS9wb3N0cy9sdXh1cnktYnJpY2stYW5kLW1vcnRhci1yZXRhaWwtY29tZWJhY2vSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Consumers are going back to brick-and-mortar stores in impressive numbers, looking for meaning, looking for distractions, but more importantly, looking for a sense of belonging.

Luxury brands are benefiting greatly from this consumer comeback with top brands still outperforming and some pressure to properly innovate.

Counterintuitively, the rebound of brick-and-mortar does not seem to weigh on online sales — for now.

The basic reason I am optimistic about the future of luxury is the fact I believe you don’t bet against human nature. Luxury fulfills the need to fit in, to belong to a community, get recognized, and rise within the Maslow pyramid, from fulfilling your basic needs to reaching self-actualization. As Aristotle said, “Man is by nature a social animal,” he can’t survive in isolation. And man has been isolated unwillingly for quite a while now with this pandemic! That’s the basic reason why I believe you don’t bet against brick-and-mortar stores; that, and the reality that most luxury brands cater to first-time purchasers who want to look, feel, smell, and touch the product that is often considered as an investment.

One of the most visible stories in luxury this week has been the reopening of La Samaritaine in Paris after the iconic department store had been shut for 16 years. In normal times, this may have grabbed a headline or two. This week, the level of attention around this reopening has been close to dumbfounding. As images of the stunning revamp circulated online, French president Macron was filmed inaugurating the venue with an entire suite of top managers from LVMH (the group owns La Samaritaine and its travel retail arm DFS is running it) to cheers of hundreds of employees in a display of authentic joy and a sense of community. Observers may have been surprised that the French president had time for this the day after what seemed like a tough electoral evening for him, but the reopening will create jobs (up to 3,000 apparently) and certainly a message of hope in the French capital after a long period of COVID-19 related travel restrictions, curfews, and more.

Cynics will point to the fact that this new shopping mecca was planned to target tourists, notably mainland Chinese, and that they won’t come before a year from now. First, I would say who cares about a year when you’ve been waiting for 16 and you have the financial means and the long-term vision that LVMH and its CEO Bernard Arnault have? Second, and most importantly, local French and European traveling consumers are likely keen to discover the venue and all the retail innovations and exclusive offers La Samaritaine has to offer. To a certain extent, the department store can be a sort of innovation lab for luxury in months ahead. It will surely be one of my first stops when I visit Paris this summer.

As markets reopen and consumers look to engage, it looks like what was true at the height of the pandemic pain remains true today: the bigger brands are getting a disproportionate amount of attention. Judging by the difficulty to enter Chanel, Louis Vuitton, Dior and, in another segment, Nike flagship stores in Manhattan, the Buy Less, Buy Better attitude I described in previous columns is ongoing.

What will also likely motivate consumers to come back to brick-and-mortar is to have access to experiences they will never find online. That is where La Samaritaine’s reopening looks to offer some entertainment, such as with the first ever physical store from Champagne maison Ruinart, known to connoisseurs for its “Blanc de Blancs” cuvée, and visible more recently for its “second-skin” case made from 100% recyclable paper, which you’ll be able to personalize. Another example, both the men’s and women’s Dior stores on 57th Street in Manhattan are putting forward very lively product collaborations with shopping window displays and products that are definitely unexpected. Brick-and-mortar is back for sure, but you have to assume that consumers, who are finally getting out again, won’t settle for the “same, same” experience as before.

Online sales of luxury could have logically suffered as consumers go back to physical stores. It doesn’t seem to be the case and I think this is linked to two elements. First, a better online experience has enabled consumers living in cities without stores to start to buy products without having to travel. Second, for repeat purchasers of luxury who were maybe not very comfortable to purchase online pre-pandemic, they have developed the habit and those might be sticky. In a moment of rebound and enthusiasm, it’s not incompatible to see all channels doing well.

Arnault of LVMH partners with Google Cloud on AI project - The Drinks Business,"Mon, 21 Jun 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWRyaW5rc2J1c2luZXNzLmNvbS8yMDIxLzA2L2FybmF1bHQtb2YtbHZtaC1wYXJ0bmVycy13aXRoLWdvb2dsZS1jbG91ZC1vbi1haS1wcm9qZWN0L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"News

By db staff writer

Bernard Arnault, the 72-year-old chief executive of LVMH, has forged a strategic partnership with Google Cloud to use its artificial intelligence for the next five years.

The system will mine trillions of pieces of personal data gathered by the internet behemoth to enhance LVMH’s ability to manage functions from demand forecasting to personalising offers for clients. It includes the launch of a ‘Data and AI Academy’ to share expertise.

LVMH will draw on the partnership to update its IT infrastructure with a view to “fostering the agility, security, cost efficiency and performance at scale required to support its business ambitions,” according to the statement.

Billionaire entrepreneur, investor and art collector Arnault, who now ranks as the world’s richest man, aims to put LVMH at the forefront of the changing world of luxury commerce opening up in the post coronavirus world.

All companies say they monitor developing trends and drinks leaders such as Diageo and Pernod Ricard have derived competitive advantages from e-commerce and its associated market information, but Arnault’s latest move will give LVMH a treasure trove of data on which to plan its strategies.

The partnership gives Arnault similar advantages to those of Jeff Bezos, the head of Amazon, whose empire has been built on information and automation.

And it is Bezos who Arnault has just toppled from the summit of the world’s wealth league table, according to Fortune.

At the start of the pandemic LVMH’s shares slumped, cutting Arnault’s wealth to well below US$100 billion. But since the start of this year, they have soared by more than 30%, catapulting Arnault, who owns 47.5% of the group, to wealth estimated at US$196.8 billion — beating Bezos to become the richest person in the world.

As their company share prices fluctuated over the past few weeks Bezos and Arnault have been head-to-head in the wealth league table but last week Arnault’s entire family net worth put him a US$1.5 billion above Bezos.

By comparison Ukranian-born industrialist Sir Leonard Blavatnik, who heads this year’s Sunday Times Rich List, is sitting on a mere £23 billion (US$32 billion)

While much of the travel retail market on which luxury goods thrive has been shut for the past 16 months, those at the spending pinnacle supplied by the galaxy of houses owned by LVMH have not stopped buying, notably in its 5,000 stores worldwide.

Price is no problem so business has simply switched to LVMH’s prime retail outlets in places such as New York and Singapore, helping to drive a 32% rise in sales (up 30% on an organic basis) in the first quarter of this year compared to the same period in 2020.

Within that, sales of wines and spirits, which comprise 7% of the business, rose by 29% or by an impressive 36% on an organic basis. The largest division, fashion and leather goods, saw revenues jump by 45% in the quarter.

And those figures did not include a full contribution from jeweller Tiffany, which Arnault bought in January for US$16 billion.

That deal enhanced his ‘Terminator’ nickname, derived from his drive to slash costs and boost profits.

Originally he had offered to pay US$16.2 billion but demanded – and got – a reduction because of Tiffany’s alleged mismanagement in the interim.

While 45% of LVMH’s business comes from the US, a further 25% is derived in Asia, China especially, and it is those two regions that the deal with Google is designed to underpin and augment.

Nowhere will this become more evident than in Hainan, the giant new tax-free zone in southern China where LVMH brands have a significant presence.

The territory is in its infancy but duty free sales rocketed to US$736 million in February, up from US$568.5 million in January.

More than 825,000 shoppers visited the island’s duty free stores in the month, a quarter of them during the 11-17 February period of Chinese New Year.

The Chinese government plans that by turning Hainan into a holiday destination for its rich, much of the wealth spent by its citizens on tax-free goods will be diverted to it from places such as Seoul and Singapore where they have previously splashed the cash.

For Arnault, the next milestone will be LVMH’s half-year results at the end of July. Judging by the soaring share price over past weeks investors expect them to be buoyant. If they are, he could keep Bezos at bay on the wealth league table.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.8723418712615967}",neutral,0.8723418712615967,0

All photography by Matthieu Salvaing …

La Samaritaine, a historic Art Deco and Art Nouveau landmark that contrasts the uniform Haussmannian buildings typical of central Paris, closed in 2005 due to safety concerns after falling into disrepair. Seeking to bring the storied retail destination out of hibernation, the French luxury conglomerate LVMH partnered with luxury retailer DFS to spearhead a painstaking $894 million refurbishment that ushers the department store into the future while nodding to old-world Parisian glamour. After seven years of restoration, La Samaritaine has finally opened to the public with retail space, offices, restaurants, and even social housing. A five-star hotel, the 72-room Cheval Blanc Paris designed by Peter Marino, will follow in September with four restaurants and a Dior spa. “I’m both delighted and proud to see La Samaritaine, a true institution to which Parisians have always been deeply attached, restored to its magnificent beauty and iconic stature,” says LVMH chairman Bernard Arnault. “The long history of La Samaritaine has been shaped by bold vision, prosperity, and a sense of solidarity. With this new chapter, the story will continue into the future.”

LVMH enlisted a crop of world-class design talent to restore the retail destination to its former glory. Upon entering the main hall, Yabu Pushelberg’s masterful renovation of the building’s architectural grandeur comes into full view. A monumental staircase with 16,000 gold leaves and swirling “horizon blue” wrought-iron railings offers unobstructed views up through a soaring atrium, whose rectangular glass roof washes the five-level interior in natural light and emulates a stroll through the city. Other nods to Parisian boulevards, like an abstract floor pattern of cobblestones and colorful riffs on the city’s street lamps, take the alfresco ambience even further. Local architects Malherbe Paris spearheaded the basement beauty department, a 36,600-square-foot emporium billed as the largest of its kind in Europe. The Japanese firm SANAA, meanwhile, devised the structure’s undulating glass facade that faces the Seine and was once lampooned for resembling a “shower curtain.” “La Samaritaine has always been scandalous,” the architectural historian Jean-François Cabestan, who co-authored the 2015 book La Samaritaine, Paris, told CNN. “From the very beginning, the building was flashy with its colorful enamel paneling and use of glass and iron instead of traditional stone.” He also notes that it once offered affordable goods: “It was an opera house for the poor. But this is not a shop for the lower class anymore. This will be for tourists and for people with means.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999898672103882}",neutral,0.9999898672103882,0

The overall financial strength of LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE is 5 out of 10, which indicates that the financial strength of LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE is fair. This is the debt and cash of LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE over the past years:

It is less risky to invest in profitable companies, especially those with consistent profitability over long term. A company with high profit margins is usually a safer investment than those with low profit margins. LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE has been profitable 10 over the past 10 years.

Growth is probably one of the most important factors in the valuation of a company. GuruFocus’ research has found that growth is closely correlated with the long-term performance of a company’s stock.

Return on invested capital (ROIC) measures how well a company generates cash flow relative to the capital it has invested in its business. The weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is the rate that a company is expected to pay on average to all its security holders to finance its assets. If the ROIC is higher than the WACC, it indicates that the company is creating value for shareholders. Over the past 12 months, LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE’s ROIC was 6.46, while its WACC came in at 5.06.

"How to invest in Bernard Arnault, the man who got richer than Bezos and Musk - Yahoo Finance","Fri, 04 Jun 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9pbnZlc3QtYmVybmFyZC1hcm5hdWx0LW1hbi1nb3QtMjEwMDAwMzk5Lmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"How to invest in Bernard Arnault, the man who got richer than Bezos and Musk

Most of the world’s richest people are household names at this point: Jeff Bezos, Elon Musk, Warren Buffett, Bill Gates.

But recently, French tycoon Bernard Arnault, CEO of luxury brand conglomerate LVMH, overtook all of them to become the No. 1 world’s richest person.

And it left many Americans asking one question: “Who?”

Well, here’s how a man whose name you may not have known before last week and who's worth more than $180 billion can help inspire a winning investing strategy among those of us with slightly less cash on hand.

Who is Bernard Arnault?

Arnault is the face behind LVMH (Louis Vuitton Moët Hennessy), a luxury empire that includes not just the three iconic brands in the company’s name but also such revered fashion houses as Christian Dior, Fendi and Givenchy.

And just this past January, his company acquired Tiffany & Co. for $15.8 billion.

His father, Jean Arnault, made his fortune in construction, and the younger Arnault started his career working for him, eventually taking over as president in 1979.

Five years later, for $15 million, he bought up Boussac Saint-Frères, a company whose assets included Christian Dior. Then, in 1988, he maneuvered to take a majority stake in LVMH.

By the mid-’90s, LVMH’s value had multiplied 15 times over and sales and profits increased fivefold.

How did he become the world’s richest man?

Arnault made it into the top 10 of Forbes’ list of top billionaires back in 2005, then inched his way into the top five by 2018.

But by 2019, he was firmly in the top three with a $76 billion fortune.

Throughout the pandemic, luxury sales have soared, increasing LVMH’s stock price and Arnault’s personal fortune. As a result, he’s been tussling with Tesla’s Elon Musk and Bezos for the top position over the last year and a half.

In late May, LVMH’s stock rose 0.4% in the first hours of trading, adding $600 million to Arnault’s personal fortune and knocking Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos down to second-richest person in the world.

Story continues

Arnault and Bezos traded places three times over the next few days, but by June 1, Arnault was holding steady in the top spot.

How to follow in his footsteps

LVMH stock, which is currently listed at just under $160, isn’t traded on the major U.S. exchanges. But that doesn’t mean you can’t buy in.

One way to get shares is by way of the company’s unsponsored ADR, or American depositary receipt, which is a U.S.-bank-issued certificate that can be traded like regular stock.

The ADR is only available on the over the counter (OTC) market, though, which is more complicated to navigate than the markets you’re used to.

A much easier way to grab some LVMH stock is through any of the luxury-themed ETFs that include LVMH.

WIth modern investing smartphone apps, it’s incredibly easy to add any ETF to your portfolio. And, once your portfolio is set up, some apps will even automatically invest your “spare change” so your money is always growing in the background.

And if you want to spread out your risk by putting down a little on each of Arnault’s competitors for world’s richest person, you can always buy fractional shares of Amazon, Tesla or Berkshire Hathaway — shares worth $3,196, $599 and $439,615, respectively, as of this writing.

Where to go from there

If you’re keen to get into investing like a luxury tycoon, but there’s not much room in your budget right now, you have a few options to find some extra funds.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999852180480957}",neutral,0.9999852180480957,0

With a shocking net worth of $194.8 billion, Arnault has moved ahead of Bezos. Bezos is now listed at $193.4 billion, as of June 12, 2021.

Imagine if you’d noticed.

A vast majority of Jeff Bezos’ wealth is tied up in his Amazon shares — Bezos owns about 10 percent of the e-commerce giant — in addition to an estimated $19 billion worth of cash and investments, $500 million in real estate, plus aerospace company Blue Origin and the Washington Post.

Right now, it’s mainly a battle between Bernard Arnault, the CEO and Chairman of LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton SA (OTCPK:LVMHF) (OTCPK:LVMUY) and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) founder Jeff Bezos that has seen the two bounce back and forth several times between first and second places, which will probably continue to happen. Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO Elon Musk ranks third on the list, followed by Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg, and Warren Buffett.

La Samaritaine opened its doors on Wednesday, and owner, luxury goods group LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, has promised a retail emporium with a concept store feel. One of its major attractions is the biggest beauty area in Europe where some perfumes retail for €300,000.

The whole basement floor covering 3,400 square meters is dedicated to the category, and LVMH-owned travel retailer DFS Group, which is running the entire store, has selected 200 brands to fill it. Natural light filters down from the glass roof of the seven-story building, and from large skylights.

The mix is broad: on the Pont-Neuf side of the building you can find international luxury names like Dior, Chanel, and Guerlain in a Parisian setting designed by Hubert de Malherbe to reflect Samaritaine’s Art Nouveau origins; or go to the Rue de Rivoli side for trendy and unisex brands including Aesop, The Ordinary, and Le Labo in the Pure Beauty area, an urban setting conceived by Cigüe combining waxed concrete, metallic furniture, and natural materials like wood.

The 16-year project from LVMH establishes a new retail landmark in the heart of Paris in the first arrondissement. Billionaire CEO Bernard Arnault was prepared to throw a lot of money at the project—close to $1 billion according to CNN—to create a must-visit shopping destination for tourists.

They may be in short supply now due to the pandemic, but Arnault is playing a long game, confident that Samaritaine will eventually deliver on international footfall and spending. The store is also more conveniently and centrally located than LVMH’s other high-end Parisian store Le Bon Marché.

LVMH’s CFO Jean-Jacques Guiony said he expects the same level of sales per square meter as Le Bon Marché “at some future point,” possibly when tourist visits reach the five million mark that Eléonore de Boysson, DFS Group Region President for Europe and Middle East, predicts when travel returns fully.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999992847442627}",neutral,0.9999992847442627,0
'The new Parisian emotion' – LVMH and DFS set for landmark day with 23 June reopening of La Samaritaine - The Moodie Davitt Report,"Wed, 09 Jun 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigwFodHRwczovL21vb2RpZWRhdml0dHJlcG9ydC5jb20vdGhlLW5ldy1wYXJpc2lhbi1lbW90aW9uLWx2bWgtYW5kLWRmcy1zZXQtZm9yLWxhbmRtYXJrLWRheS13aXRoLTIzLWp1bmUtcmVvcGVuaW5nLW9mLWxhLXNhbWFyaXRhaW5lL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"FRANCE. ‘More than a store – the new Parisian destination.” So said LVMH as it revealed via Instagram the 23 June reopening of La Samaritaine department store in Paris.

The reopening will mark a huge day for DFS Group. As reported, the profoundly ambitious €750 million (US$817.9 million) renovation of the 70,000sq m historic building includes a T Galleria by DFS, offering what the travel retailer describes as “exceptional” collections from Parisian, French and international brands and artisans.

The duty and tax paid range will include beauty and fragrances, fashion and accessories, watches and jewellery, and food, wines and spirits. Eight restaurants, bars and cafes will complete the consumer experience.

La Samaritaine, a Parisian institution since its founding in 1870 by Ernest Cognacq and Marie-Louise Jaÿ, was acquired by LVMH in 2001. Four years later the building was closed for safety reasons, sparking more than a decade of controversy over its proposed design and redevelopment. With all the legal and regulatory challenges long overcome, the scene is set for the grand unveiling of what LVMH describes as “the new Parisian emotion”

The new-look La Samaritaine embraces a cluster of old and new buildings spread over two blocks between the Quai du Louvre and the Rue de Rivoli, adjacent to the Seine river. Besides the DFS store, the project includes a 5-star, 72-room Cheval Blanc hotel; 96 social housing units; offices and a crèche.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999972581863403}",neutral,0.9999972581863403,0
Nona Source: LVMH Debuts Online Resale Platform To Upcycle Luxury Textile Deadstock - Green Queen Media,"Mon, 07 Jun 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdyZWVucXVlZW4uY29tLmhrL25vbmEtc291cmNlLWx2bWgtZGVidXRzLW9ubGluZS1yZXNhbGUtcGxhdGZvcm0tdG8tdXBjeWNsZS1sdXh1cnktdGV4dGlsZS1kZWFkc3RvY2sv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"3 Mins Read

LVMH, the owner of leading fashion houses such as Stella McCartney, Givenchy and Christian Dior, has launched the company’s first online resale platform. Nona Source was created as part of the luxury giant’s efforts to “re-source” and reuse materials from the Group’s Fashion & Leather Goods Maisons by providing access to these fabrics at competitive prices to emerging designers and brands in Europe.

Paris-based Louis Vuitton Moët Hennessy, known more generally as LVMH, has unveiled Nona Source, a platform that was incubated by the DARE intrapreneurial program (Disrupt, Act, Risk to be an Entrepreneur) in order to support the fashion conglomerate’s environmental strategy to build a circular fashion economy that part of its LVMH Initiatives For the Environment (LIFE) 360 program.

Created by LVMH experts Marie Falguera, Romain Brabo, Anne Prieur du Perray, the platform uses deadstocks, the “sleeping beauties” that are lying in the warehouses of LVMH Fashion & Leather Goods Houses, Dior, Givenchy, Loewe, CELINE and several more to prevent this textile waste from unnecessarily ending up in landfills.

The online platform’s catalogue showcases materials from lace to leathers in different compositions, weights, colors and patterns, however, exclusive patterns or branded fabrics are not available. Initially, the platform has proposed 100,000 metres of 500 fabrics and 1,000 metres of leather all re-sourced from one Parisian couture house.

In an interview with Vogue Business, Romain Brabo, who previously worked with Givenchy and Kenzo as an expert in material purchasing and manufacturing, said: “I would go to warehouses, and I saw the multiplication of deadstocks. I thought: on one hand, there are young designers seeking beautiful fabrics to make their collections; on the other hand, couture houses are storing materials they have no use for. How to create a link between them?”

Carefully selected and re-valued with up to 70% off from the original price tag, the fabrics are presented through high-quality visuals, videos that replicate the “Touch & Feel” experience and mannequin displays. Professionals can buy rolls, skins or panels, without the need for cutting or sampling and can purchase quantities as low as two to twelves metres.

This solution derives its name from one of the three Parcae goddesses of Roman mythology with the youngest, Nona spinning the thread of life and Decima weaveing it with Morta cutting it and hence the platform is based on this principle of reusing materials without the need for the thread to be cut and instead upcycling it to provide high-quality products.

As stocks are located in Europe, the platform will only be delivering across Europe and to the U.K. to start with.

Going forward, the program will incorporate the use of sustainable designs, recycled materials and packaging with goals that will increase all the after every couple of years till 2030 experimenting with several rental and resale models.

According to Stephanie Benedetto, co-founder and CEO of Queen of Raw, deadstock textiles alone amount to an annual loss of over US$152 billion for the industry.

Following the successful launch of Fenty Beauty in September 2017, Rihanna has proceeded to build an empire spanning across the make-up, skincare, apparel and luxury goods markets. This case study takes a deep dive into the Fenty empire and identifies how the individual brands have each achieved such phenomenal growth in what is a short period of time.



Key Highlights

Fenty Beauty was the first brand within the empire to be launched and is undoubtedly the jewel in the crown, experiencing impressive growth since its launch just three years ago. The brand has not only gained a cult following but has also set new standards in the market through its commitment to inclusivity, initiating the so called 'Fenty Effect'. It has showcased a masterclass in marketing since its inception, which has been the main driver of its growth.

Rihanna's most recent endeavour is Fenty Skin, which was released in July 2020 . The decision to foray into the skincare market was a lucrative one, as the market has experienced similar growth rates to the make-up market historically. The inclusivity ethos is carried across to Fenty Skin, with the range aiming to cater to everyone, which was clearly visible in the release campaign. The range also claims to be clean, with no harsh ingredients, and ethical with refillable and recyclable packaging, incorporating two trends which are prominent.

In addition to the make-up and skincare markets, the Fenty brand has also established a presence in the apparel and luxury goods industries. Rihanna first launched Savage X Fenty, a lingerie brand which has already made significant strides, challenging the dominance of the longstanding market leader, Victoria's Secret. Following this, Rihanna established the Fenty fashion house, with the backing of luxury goods conglomerate LVMH, which has significantly benefited both parties.

A dedicated award ceremony took place on this the third day of the 2021 Viva Technology show in Paris, running from 16-19 June.

Bambuser was selected as the winner by LVMH Chairman and CEO, Bernard Arnault, and LVMH Group Managing Director, Toni Belloni, along with members of a selection committee.

For the past five years, the LVMH Innovation Award has been one of the highlights of the Viva Technology show, which has itself become a key event for the world’s innovation ecosystem and is considered to be Europe's biggest start-up and tech event.

For the 2021 Innovation Award, more than 850 entries were received from around the world. A total of 28 start-ups from 12 different countries were selected as finalists, notably reflecting their ability to enhance the customer experience.

Toni Belloni said: “Innovation is an absolute obsession at LVMH. It’s what lets us continually heighten the appeal and desirability of our maisons. We fuse luxury and technology together, and the finalists of the 2021 Innovation Award will bring us their capacity to nourish this encounter even more. Their entrepreneurial spirit joins and inspires our own.”

Bambuser helps brands host live shopping sessions online, with influencers or sales associates. The shows are hosted natively on the brands’ websites, enabling them to own the look and feel of the experience and manage conversations, data and check-out. The start-up’s clients include Parfums Christian Dior and Make Up For Ever.

Sophie Abrahamsson, Chief Commercial Officer at Bambuser, commented: “At Bambuser we are on a mission to change retail. We are so proud to contribute to do this with the LVMH Group. Any start-up needs more than just a mission to succeed. It takes a dedicated and highly skilled team that doesn’t take no for an answer, and that one important customer who believes in you and wants to trailblaze with you, and that is what LVMH is to us.”

Bambuser will have the opportunity to benefit from six months of personalised support as part of LVMH’s accelerator program, “La Maison des Startups,” which has been based at the Station F start-up campus in Paris since 2018.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.5569872260093689}",neutral,0.5569872260093689,0
"With an empire of handbags and cognac, Bernard Arnault elbows past tech titan Jeff Bezos to top world's rich list - Fortune","Tue, 15 Jun 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vZm9ydHVuZS5jb20vZXVyb3BlLzIwMjEvMDYvMTUvbHZtaC1oYW5kYmFncy1jb2duYWMtYmVybmFyZC1hcm5hdWx0LWplZmYtYmV6b3MtcmljaGVzdC1wZXJzb24v0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"French luxury mogul Bernard Arnault isn’t sending anybody into outer space, but his fortunes sure are taking off.

On Tuesday, Arnault’s net worth topped $196.8 billion—beating Amazon founder Jeff Bezos to become the richest person in the world.

One makes rockets, the other makes handbags. Bezos and Arnault have been knocking each other off the Forbes Real-Time Billionaires List for the past few weeks, and the two are head-to-head. Arnault’s entire family net worth puts him a mere $1.5 billion above Bezos.

Bernard Arnault is the chief executive of LVMH, the world’s biggest luxury goods group, in which he holds a 47.5% stake. Owning an arsenal of luxury names, LVMH is behind drink labels Moët & Chandon Champagne and Hennessy cognac, plus fashion brands Louis Vuitton, Loewe, Christian Dior, and Kenzo.

The company has come out of the pandemic in a flourish—recording surging revenues in the first quarter of 2021 and surpassing pre-pandemic numbers in key markets such as Asia and the U.S.

Shares in LVMH are up 31.1% so far this year as the sales outlook appears bright.

LVMH’s home European market will soon be brimming with shoppers again as vaccinations roll out and tourists flock to capital cities to buy up handbags and liquor that have collected dust during the pandemic.

Additionally, luxury goods aren’t likely to be plagued by inflationary pressures that are dogging some aspects of the post-COVID-19 economic recovery. As raw material and labor prices increase, companies with the pricing power to deal with cost pressures will be protected, according to analysis from Bank of America.

Both Arnault and Bezos sit comfortably above third place runner-up Elon Musk, who lags behind by $40 billion at $154.8 billion.

The competition between Bezos and Arnault has so far been a tight race. Bezos’s net worth has risen above and below the $200 billion mark as the Amazon share price ebbs and flows. He first broke the milestone in August 2020, and again less than a year later in April 2021.

And this is also not the first time Arnault has been crowned world’s richest. He briefly broke the record in December 2019 and again in January 2020, but when the COVID-19 pandemic first broke out in China—the company’s largest growth market—shares in the luxury goods group toppled.

But not to fret. Together, the two business moguls managed to amass $170 billion since the pandemic began in March 2020.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9996324777603149}",neutral,0.9996324777603149,0
Luxury with a heart: LVMH launches emergency fund for employees - GlobalCosmeticsNews,"Wed, 09 Jun 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmdsb2JhbGNvc21ldGljc25ld3MuY29tL2x1eHVyeS13aXRoLWEtaGVhcnQtbHZtaC1sYXVuY2hlcy1lbWVyZ2VuY3ktZnVuZC1mb3ItZW1wbG95ZWVzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"THE WHAT? LVMH is ramping up its CSR activity with the launch of an unprecedented fund aimed at supporting its staff across the globe. The LVMH Heart Fund is designed to help employees faced with a serious personal situation via emergency financial aid and dedicated social and psychological support.

THE DETAILS The global assistance program is open to the French luxury conglomerate’s 150,000 employees in more than 70 countries and will be endowed with an initial allocation of €30 million and a free, anonymous and confidential support hotline.

“At LVMH, our people make the difference every day and are at the very heart of the Group’s success. In return, it’s only fair that we support them and stand by them through the most difficult times that might occur in their lives. With this initiative – unprecedented in its scope – the Group has shown a new side of its deep social commitment to employees and put its core values into action by providing very concrete support to our employees faced with challenging circumstances.”, says Chantal Gaemperle, EVP Human Resources and Synergies, LVMH.

THE WHY? LVMH said that it has a responsibility to provide a safe, fulfilling work environment for its employees and its Heart Fund is the latest example of the attention it pays to each individual.

Cheval Blanc Paris: LVMH's much-awaited hotel to open in September - The National,"Tue, 22 Jun 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZW5hdGlvbmFsbmV3cy5jb20vbGlmZXN0eWxlL2x1eHVyeS9jaGV2YWwtYmxhbmMtcGFyaXMtbHZtaC1zLW11Y2gtYXdhaXRlZC1ob3RlbC10by1vcGVuLWluLXNlcHRlbWJlci0xLjEyNDYyNzbSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Cheval Blanc Paris, LVMH’s much-anticipated luxury hotel in the heart of the French capital, will open on September 7.

The first city hotel from the fashion behemoth, Cheval Blanc Paris is accepting reservations from Tuesday. Set in a prime location overlooking the Seine, with views of Notre-Dame and Sacre-Coeur, it will offer 72 rooms, including 46 suites and The Apartment.

The latter spans 10,780 square feet and has seven rooms, two reception areas, a swimming pool, hammam, sauna, treatment room, fitness suite and private projection room, as well as a private elevator and parking space.

Not content with dominating the fashion universe, LVMH has branched out into luxury hospitality in recent years, but this is its first “urban” hotel and its first property in the French capital.

The opening has added resonance because the hotel is located in the Art Deco wing of the historic La Samaritaine building, which was built in 1870 and was home to one of the city’s first department stores.

The building closed in 2005 due to safety concerns, and has since undergone a €500 million ($595m) renovation. The 20,000-square-metre department store element will reopen on Wednesday, as a symbol of LVMH's bullish hopes for Paris's retail landscape.

It will house about 650 luxury brands, as well as 12 restaurants, and is intended to re-energise the 1st arrondissement district of Paris.

The building's exterior was remodelled by architect Edouard Francois, while American designer Peter Marino was tasked with reimagining the interior of the hotel, transforming it into an ultra-luxe proposition while remaining mindful of its classification as a listed building.

The design draws on the styling of a traditional Parisian residence, combining Art Deco features and gilded bronze accents with bespoke furniture, artworks and a shimmering gold colour palette.

LVMH relied on traditional French craftsmanship to bring the design to life, working with creatives such as Sophie Mallebranche, who produces bespoke woven-metal materials, Atelier Lison de Caunes, which specialises in straw marquetry, and Charles Schambourg, an expert leather worker.

The hotel’s four restaurants will be helmed by Michelin-starred chefs, including Arnaud Donckele and pastry chef Maxime Frederic.

Le Tout-Paris is a brasserie and cocktail bar overlooking the Parisian skyline, Langosteria is the hotel's fine-dining venue, Limbar is a more casual all-day dining option and La Table de Partage is the place to celebrate special occasions.

Having already made his mark at sister property Cheval Blanc St-Tropez, Donckele has been tasked with “infusing his singular interpretation of the City of Light into a new culinary journey” that combines the best of Parisian tradition and modernity, according to LVMH.

The hotel will also be home to the Dior Spa Cheval Blanc Paris, which will offer bespoke treatments in six dedicated rooms, each designed to reflect a facet of the house of Dior.

The Bonheur Suite offers a relaxing escape for two, the New Look Suite was designed specifically for the spa's six-hand Couture Dream massage, and the Sauvage Suite features an alpha quartz-covered massage bed.

The spa will also be home to a swimming pool and state-of-the-art exercise facilities.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999995231628418}",neutral,0.9999995231628418,0

Diet Prada questions LVMH's 'neutral' political stance as they launch 'Keffiyeh' as a stole - PeepingMoon,"Wed, 02 Jun 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5wZWVwaW5nbW9vbi5jb20vbmV3cy1mYXNoaW9uL25ld3MvNTYyMDMvRGlldC1QcmFkYS1xdWVzdGlvbnMtTFZNSCdzLSduZXV0cmFsJy1wb2xpdGljYWwtc3RhbmNlLWFzLXRoZXktbGF1bmNoLSdLZWZmaXllaCctYXMtYS1zdG9sZS5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"One of the most famous fashion critics on Instagram, Diet Prada is back in the news and this time, their target for questioning is fashion giant LVMH. The luxury fashion house launched a scarf recently that looks oddly close to the Palestinian keffiyeh.

For the Israel and Palestine issue, the brand had maintained its 'politically neutral' stance. They refused to comment about the issue as well as distancing themselves from the political and personal opinions of their models.

Thus, it struck a little odd to see them launch a stole that is eerily similar to the cultural keffiyeh, a traditional Arab headdress that has become a symbol of Palestinian nationalism. The scarf is light blue in colour with the brand's logo emblazoned upon it. The official website lists the price of the stole at USD 705 which comes up to INR 51,601.

The description of the stole on the website says, ""The Monogram Keffieh stole is inspired by the classic Keffieh and enriched with House signatures. A jacquard weave technique is used to create the intricate Monogram patterns on its base of blended cotton, wool, and silk. Soft and lightweight with fringed edges, this timeless accessory creates an easygoing mood."" The luxury brand has not mentioned or given credit to the Arabian traditional headgear as inspiration for this design.

Diet Prada also highlighted that LVMH is not the first fashion brand to do this. To name a few, brands like Chanel and Fendi have also been a part of making keffiyeh a staple design in the past. Chanel's Resort 2015 collection was ""inspired"" by the keffiyeh pattern.

Another prominent brand to have been called out in the past is Cecilie Copenhagen, which has heavily depended upon the pattern for its designs.

Can this be considered as another form of 'cultural appropriation?'

"What lies behind Emilio Pucci, the new LVMH acquisition - Luxus Plus","Wed, 23 Jun 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vbHV4dXMtcGx1cy5jb20vZW4vd2hhdC1saWVzLWJlaGluZC1lbWlsaW8tcHVjY2ktdGhlLW5ldy1sdm1oLWFjcXVpc2l0aW9uL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The French luxury group LVMH has acquired the Italian brand Emilio Pucci. LVMH, which has owned 67% of the firm since 2002, now holds 100% of the shares.



The French group now becomes the sole owner of the brand, having bought out the last shares held by the family of the brand’s founder, notably Laudomia Pucci. The former vice-president and image director is leaving the family business. The cost of the transaction has not yet been disclosed.

Nevertheless, this takeover could mark a new turning point for the brand. Pucci, which has not had an artistic director since 2017, will therefore certainly be able to see its brand reborn, focused on future new goals.

Emilio Pucci: the mid-century wonder

Born in 1914 in Florence, Italy, Marquis Emilio Pucci caused a fashion sensation in the 1950s with the creation of a revolutionary ski suit. Later, by creating a line of cruisewear as simple as it was seductive, with a free-spirited look and bright colours, he became the adored designer of Marilyn Monroe, Madonna and Nicole Kidman.

His revolutionary approach to fashion won over many an international admirer of his daring and original creations. He has even been dubbed “The Prince of Prints“. “My father was a minimalist before the advent of minimalism, a jet setter before the first jets took flight, a scientist before fabric technology became a discipline in itself, a provocateur in his modernity and daring dress” , said his daughter, Laudomia Pucci.

Inspired by the natural landscapes of the Mediterranean and exotic cultures, Emilio Pucci has created a unique and personal style through his brand, characterised by bright and luminous colours.

Organic shapes, geometric patterns, vibrant colours: nothing is left out at Pucci, who tries to put his vision of the freedom of shapes and colours at the service of fashion. The artist is also inspired by the world around him: Sicilian mosaics, heraldic banners from the famous Palio horse race in Siena, batiks from Bali and African motifs.

This acquisition of the brand by LVMH was therefore possibly carried out with the aim of reviving Emilio Pucci’s artistic line during the 1950s, characterised by its pop prints, flashy colours and graphic motifs.

Founded in 1870 by French couple Ernest Cognacq and Louise Jaÿ, what started out as a small family boutique is now being relaunched as one of the most expensive department stores in the world. LVMH's superstore will cater to the ""super rich,"" the ultra-high net worth individuals eagerly awaiting the mall's opening.

La Samaritaine will include over 600 brands, a luxurious department store with the world's high-end brands, 96 social housing units, five-star restaurants, and a five-star Cheval Blanc hotel with 72 rooms that each cost $1,270 (P60,000) per night.

Other unique features include the duty free retailer DFS and a Christian Dior spa.

LVMH CEO Bernard Arnault, the most powerful man in fashion, acquired La Samaritaine in 2001, but the building was closed in 2005 due to failing to meet building safety codes. The palatial shopping mall has been in the works for years, but management issues and structural concerns have caused the project to stretch for almost two decades, spending over $1 billion in renovation costs.

CFO of LVMH and CEO of La Samaritaine, an LVMH subsidiary, Jean-Jeacques Guiony admitted that “the Samaritaine has no architectural unity, which isn’t to say it doesn’t have personality.”

In order to keep the building's unique architectural identity, the mall underwent a 30-month large-scale renovation schedule, updating structural elements for safety while also striving to keep the fine details of La Samaritaine.

Over 150 years since its inception, La Samaritaine still boasts its stunning tiles, Jourdain glass roof, and Art Nouveau design.

Revamped and refurbished, La Samaritaine is set to finally open on June 19. Take a look inside the fashion house's luxurious new department store, and no doubt one of the most opulent malls in the world.

London's Courtauld Gallery to reopen in November with new exhibition spaces and a commission by Cecily Brown - Art Newspaper,"Wed, 09 Jun 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilgFodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGVhcnRuZXdzcGFwZXIuY29tLzIwMjEvMDYvMDkvbG9uZG9ucy1jb3VydGF1bGQtZ2FsbGVyeS10by1yZW9wZW4taW4tbm92ZW1iZXItd2l0aC1uZXctZXhoaWJpdGlvbi1zcGFjZXMtYW5kLWEtY29tbWlzc2lvbi1ieS1jZWNpbHktYnJvd27SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The Courtauld Gallery of Art in London will reopen its prestigious gallery in November following a four-year refurbishment. The restored and expanded complex will house a plethora of new galleries and spaces with backing from major sponsors including the luxury conglomerate LVMH and the Ukrainian-born billionaire Leonard Blavatnik; other funders include the National Lottery Heritage Fund which has given £11m to the revamp.

A highlight of the project is the enlargement of the Great Room which has been renamed the LVMH Great Room after the French brand that helped fund the overhaul. The gallery will be dramatically expanded by removing “internal sub-divisions”, says the gallery's director Ernst Vegelin.

The new space will house founder Samuel Courtauld’s collection of Impressionist and Post-Impressionist paintings including Edouard Manet’s A Bar at the Folies-Bergère (1882) and Paul Gauguin’s Nevermore (1897). The historic room, which housed the summer exhibitions of the Royal Academy of Arts until 1837, is London’s earliest surviving purpose-built art gallery.

The renovations of the 18th-century building, by the London-based architects Witherford Watson Mann, will “preserve the gallery for decades to come”, said the Courtauld's director Deborah Swallow during an online briefing.

Meanwhile, a suite of six galleries across the second floor have been named the Blavatnik Fine Rooms after the businessman who has donated £10m to the initiative. Works dating from the Renaissance to the 18th century will go on display across this floor. “A major highlight will be Botticelli’s large-scale The Trinity With Saints (1491-94), the only altarpiece by the artist in the UK, unveiled after a three-year conservation project,” says a statement. A room will also be dedicated to works by Peter Paul Rubens.

A group show of drawings by artists such as Wassily Kandinsky and Cy Twombly assembled by the late collector Howard Karshan (Modern Drawings: the Karshan Gift) will inaugurate a set of new temporary exhibition galleries along with an exhibition of unseen images of Kurdistan from the 1940s. The works, donated by the late British photographer Anthony Kersting, chronicle the activities of the Yazidi community.

The UK artist Cecily Brown will also unveil a new work on the curved wall of the Courtauld’s 18th-century staircase. Meanwhile the vast painting, The Myth of Prometheus (1950), the largest work in the Courtauld’s collection, will go back on display in the Katja and Nicolai Tangen 20th-Century Gallery (the work was commissioned by Count Antoine Seilern for the ceiling of his London home).

The gallery overhaul is part of an ambitious redevelopment project known as Courtauld Connects which aims to transform teaching, learning and social spaces. The current overall cost for the project is £57m. ""This covers the costs of construction and fit-out of the gallery, learning centre, café, shop, collection study spaces, and the department of conservation, but also wider costs—for example, facilities for students and staff whilst the site has been closed for construction, as well as the innovative national partners loan programme, other public outreach and offsite art storage,"" a spokesman says. ""The Covid-19 pandemic has played a significant role in the cost increases.""","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999892711639404}",neutral,0.9999892711639404,0

Commissioned by the owners, French luxury goods company LVMH, the overhaul transformed the store on the banks of the River Seine following its closure in 2005 over safety concerns.

SANAA's design involved the restoration of many original art nouveau and art deco details, alongside a remodel and refurbishment of the buildings to bring them to modern-day standards.

""I am both delighted and proud to see La Samaritaine, a true institution to which Parisians have always been deeply attached, restored to its magnificent beauty and iconic stature,"" said LVMH chairman Bernard Arnault.

""The long history of La Samaritaine has been shaped by bold vision, prosperity and a sense of solidarity. With this new chapter, the story will now continue long into the future.""

La Samaritaine was established by Ernest and Marie-Louise Cognacq-Jaÿ in 1870. It comprises an ensemble of decorative buildings designed by architects Frantz Jourdain and Henri Sauvage.

Today, it is a mixed-used complex that contains 20,000 square metres of retail space over three floors, alongside a nursery, 96 social housing units and 15,000 square meters of office space.

Its revamp has been carried out by a team headed up by SANAA and including SRA Architectes, Édouard François and Jean-François Lagneau and FBAA.

It was originally expected to reopen in 2013, but construction has halted several times due to various court cases and campaigns opposing the new glass facade, which critics said resembled a shower curtain.

This glass facade now marks an entrance on the Rue de Rivoli and leads into the updated retail spaces, which extend across the lower levels of three of the site's four buildings.

The undulations of the facade are intended as a nod to the rhythm of the Haussmann-style windows of surrounding buildings while helping to soften the building it covers.

Related story SANAA designs cloud-like structure for Shenzhen Maritime Museum

SANAA has also introduced glass-domed courtyards between two of the buildings to help filter light in through the depths of the complex.

One of the biggest parts of the project was the restoration of the existing art nouveau and art deco building closest to the Seine, which is registered as a historical monument.

This included restoring its cast-iron signs, ceramic decorations, decorative pillars and the original multicoloured enamel tile facades that had been hidden under a stone-coloured wash.

Inside the same building, its staircase-filled atrium that is crowned by a rectangular glass roof built in 1905 has been restored to its former glory.

The roof structure, which had been covered to reduce light levels in the building, has been recreated with electrochromic glass that becomes tinted in sunlight.

Various firms have contributed to the retail interiors, including Yabu Pushelberg, Ciguë and Malherbe Paris. François collaborated with interior architect Peter Marino on the interiors of the new hotel, which occupies the other Seine-side building.

The social housing and nursery, overseen by FBAA, now occupy a group of 17th-century apartment blocks that link up to the undulating glass facade on the Rue de Rivoli.

SANAA was founded by architects Kazuyo Sejima and Ryue Nishizawa in Tokyo, Japan, in 1995. Elsewhere, it is currently designing a cloud-like structure for Shenzhen Maritime Museum.

La Samaritaine featured in our roundup of the most interesting architecture projects slated for completion in 2021. Other recently completed projects that featured on the list included Wormhole Library by MAD, Little Island by Heatherwick Studio and the Bourse de Commerce revamp by Tadao Ando.

Luxury goods group LVMH unveiled a fully revamped La Samaritaine this week, the 150-year-old department store designed to grab a greater slice of tourist spending once Covid travel curbs are lifted.

LVMH chief Bernard Arnault, left, and President Emmanuel Macron inaugurated the restored Samaritaine department store in Paris on Monday June 21, 2021.

After a seven-year makeover, the historic store reopens to the public this Wednesday to rival the likes of Galeries Lafayette, housing a hotel, restaurants and shops.

Its reopening, originally scheduled for last year, was delayed by the coronavirus pandemic.

With contagion rates falling across most of Europe, France began to lift restrictions in mid-May but foreign travellers, particularly non-Europeans, are still largely absent.

Spending by visitors to France remains a major source of income for high-end brands, even if Chinese shoppers - the industry's number one clientele - have been buying a lot more at home under Covid - a shift expected to outlast the health emergency.

LVMH, the brand behind fashion labels such as Louis Vuitton, makes 8 percent of its 45 billion euro sales in France alone, and already owns upmarket Parisian department store Le Bon Marché.

A la veille de la réouverture officielle au public de la #SamaritaineParis Pont Neuf, #LVMH a tenu à convier en avant-première les riverains pour venir redécouvrir ce lieu mythique au coeur de leur quartier. Merci d’avoir été à nos côtés !https://t.co/A9kKefdylO pic.twitter.com/jkKHaYUv7u — LVMH (@LVMH) June 22, 2021

Its latest venture, with 20,000m² of shopping space, sits on the banks of the Seine, close to tourist magnets like Notre-Dame Cathedral and the Louvre.

La Samaritaine is famed for its 1920-era building and gilded Art Deco facade but the revamped store will include a 100m airport-style moving walkway through a tunnel to nearby parking.

Facing competition from online retailers, department stores were seeking to reinvent themselves as day-trip destinations even before the Covid-19 pandemic.

The crisis has forced several prestigious U.S. names to file for bankruptcy.

LVMH reckons it may take up to two years for tourists to return en masse to France, but La Samaritaine expects to welcome around 5 million visitors a year when things go back to normal.

Taking on the rivals

The group hopes to rival peers like Qatari-controlled Printemps and family-owned Galeries Lafayette.

Some 37 million shoppers visit the latter's main store in Paris every year.

LVMH has spent 750 million euros on the iconic building's makeover, which includes a contemporary, undulating glass exterior designed by Japanese architectural duo SANAA.

The store had to shut its doors in 2005 as its original glass flooring was not sufficiently fire-resistant.

The complex will include a luxury rooftop hotel and be home to 96 flats under a social housing scheme.

LVMH Group launches financial aid fund - Employee Benefits,"Wed, 09 Jun 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vZW1wbG95ZWViZW5lZml0cy5jby51ay9sdm1oLWdyb3VwLWxhdW5jaGVzLWZpbmFuY2lhbC1haWQtZnVuZNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The Louis Vuitton Moet Hennessey Group (LVMH) has introduced a fund to provide its workforce with emergency financial aid, as well as social and psychological support.

The LVMH Heart Fund is a global assistance programme which was launched on 7 June and is available to the group’s 150,000 employees in more than 70 countries. It will receive an initial allocation of €30 million (£26m) in funding, with a free, anonymous and confidential support hotline for all staff.

According to the LVMH Group, the aim of the programme is to help workers deal with critical personal situations as well as day-to-day issues. It stated that the fund is an example of its engagement as an employer, the attention it pays to each member of staff and its desire to make a positive contribution to society.

Chantal Gaemperle, executive vice president of human resources and synergies at LVMH, explained that employees are at the very heart of the group’s success. Therefore, it is only fair that the group supports and stands by them through the most difficult times that might occur in their lives in return.

She said: “With this initiative – unprecedented in its scope – the group has shown a new side of its deep social commitment to employees and put its core values into action by providing very concrete support to our employees faced with challenging circumstances.”

Bernard Arnault, chairman and CEO at LVMH, added that the group’s corporate social responsibility policy has been “consistently ambitious” for the past 15 years, particularly in the areas of diversity and inclusion, gender equality, and disability. He said that the success of a company is not only measured by its financial results but also by its contribution to society and the support it is able to provide to its employees, with the launch of the fund an example of its commitment to its core values.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9834927320480347}",neutral,0.9834927320480347,0
The restoration of the historic Samaritaine department store in Paris - nss magazine,"Wed, 23 Jun 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5zc21hZy5jb20vZW4vYXJ0LWRlc2lnbi8yNjc4OS9zYW1hcml0YWluZS1wYXJpcy1sdm1oLWRlc2lnbtIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Today, in the heart of Paris, on the right bank of the Seine, La Samaritaine Paris Pont-Neuf, the historic department store owned by LVMH, will officially open. After a restoration that lasted 15 years and a reopening postponed for a year due to the pandemic, the curtain rises on the huge structure which in addition to a department store will also house a hotel, offices, residences and a nursery.

Closed in 2005 due to safety concerns, LVMH chose Pritzker Prize Sanaa for the renovation of the location, originally commissioned by King Henry IV in 1603 from Jean Lintlaër. After several restorations and reconstructions, the original structure was dismantled in 1813 to make room for a complex of public swimming pools. In 1870 Ernest Cognacq opened a shop on Rue du Pont-Neuf, calling it La Samaritaine, which soon becomes one of the most important examples of Art Nouveau in the French capital.

Over time, La Samaritaine has become one of the luxury shopping destinations in Paris, an ambition that comes back to life today thanks to the new building and a huge selection that ranges from haute couture to streetwear, to beauty and accessories.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999450445175171}",neutral,0.9999450445175171,0
Grande dame of Paris emporiums reopens after 16-year facelift - Times of Malta,"Tue, 22 Jun 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vdGltZXNvZm1hbHRhLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy92aWV3L2dyYW5kZS1kYW1lLW9mLXBhcmlzLWVtcG9yaXVtcy1yZW9wZW5zLWFmdGVyLTE2LXllYXItZmFjZWxpZnQuODgxMzM20gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Parisians will once again be able to stroll the gilded aisles of the Samaritaine department store starting Wednesday, after 16 years of painstaking work to restore the Art Deco and Art Nouveau landmark to its former glory.

Luxury conglomerate LVMH shut the 151-year-old emporium overlooking the Seine river in 2005, when safety inspectors discovered widespread risks including antiquated wiring.

Once a retail anchor for the historic core of the capital between the Louvre and Notre-Dame, by then it was losing money and customers no longer interested in its pitch: ""You can find everything at La Samaritaine.""

""It was dying,"" the store's chief Jean-Jacques Guiony told journalists on Monday, when President Emmanuel Macron visited for the restored site's inauguration.

Macron, touring alongside Bernard Arnault, LVMH's chief and one of the world's richest people, called it ""a stunning French cultural treasure"".

For the revamp, LVMH shrank the floor space in the flagship building, a classified monument, by a third and took its offerings firmly upmarket – applying the formula at Le Bon Marche, LVMH's other temple of luxe in Paris.

Gone is the hunting gear, housewares, tools and toys, despite the historic signs still on the facade.

Instead, think designer fashion labels, an entire floor dedicated to swank watches, two concept stores and a vast beauty and cosmetics department in the basement.

Restaurants, bars and food offerings like Street Caviar by Prunier are spread throughout, while a Cheval Blanc hotel opening in September will offer Seine views and a restaurant with Michelin-starred Arnaud Donckele at the helm.

Rooms start at 1,150 euros a night, and the two-storey rooftop penthouse will have its own pool, spa and cinema and a private elevator direct to the street. Price upon request.

""You'll no longer find everything at La Samaritaine, but you will find all of Paris at La Samaritaine,"" said Eleonore de Boysson, Europe director at LVMH's DFS retailing arm.

'Complicated'

Opened in 1870 by Ernest Cognac, a travelling salesman, and expanded with his wife Louise Jay, the four Samaritaine stores became a fixture of Paris culminating in a 1930s golden age.

He named it La Samaritaine after a pump on the nearby Pont Neuf bridge that depicted the Gospel story of the woman of Samaria offering water to Jesus.

It's the bridge Matt Damon's character spies on from the Samaritaine's roof in the 2002 thriller The Bourne Identity, though the huge lettered sign he stands behind won't be replaced.

The work was originally expected to last three to six years, but delays emerged as LVMH sought out hundreds of artisans across France capable of restoring mosaics and other artworks.

They also discovered that an elegant, golden-hued peacock fresco, an Art Nouveau masterpiece extending along the walls under the glass atrium roof, had been covered in white paint in the 1990s.

A court battle with residential and heritage groups angry over a new undulating glass facade on one section, designed by the Pritzker-winning Japanese firm Sanaa, also went to France's top court before LVMH was allowed to proceed.

Press reports say the budget climbed to 750 million euros, an amount executives have not officially confirmed but quietly concede is in the ballpark.

""Renovating is much more complicated to do than just rebuild,"" Guiony said.

'It's a rebirth'

As part of the project negotiated with City Hall, much of the store was converted into office space as well as 97 low-income housing units and a child daycare centre.

One building will be rented to Japanese fast-fashion specialist Uniqlo and other shops.

LVMH also carved out an esplanade complete with fountains where cars used to whiz past, making it easier to marvel at the ornate facades and hopefully drawing more Parisians as well as tourists.

The store and hotel alone will create 2,100 jobs, further revitalising a district that has seen a spate of recent projects, including the new Bourse de Commerce art museum by Arnault's luxury rival Francois Pinault.

But only a handful of the nearly 750 employees abruptly dismissed 16 years ago have been rehired – dozens were interviewed but LVMH requires sales staff to speak at least three languages.

""It's a rebirth,"" said Mourad Khati, 53, a manager once again on site. ""I first started when I was 21, having just arrived from Kabylia"" in Algeria.

""In those days it was more working-class,"" he said.
