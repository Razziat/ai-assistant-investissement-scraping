LVMH Employee Says She Was Told to 'Tolerate' Harassment - The Cut,"Wed, 24 Apr 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWN1dC5jb20vMjAxOS8wNC9sdm1oLWVtcGxveWVlLXNheXMtc2hlLXdhcy10b2xkLXRvLXRvbGVyYXRlLWhhcmFzc21lbnQuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Photo: Chris McGrath/Getty Images

Louis Vuitton Moët Hennessy, the fashion conglomerate that owns Dior, Sephora, and Marc Jacobs, is being sued for allegedly ignoring sexual-harassment complaints and trying to pass off harassment as “French culture.”

Andowah Newton, who is currently LVMH’s litigation counsel and vice-president of legal affairs, filed the complaint in New York on Tuesday. She claims that she was harassed by a senior employee between 2015 and 2018. When she alerted the company, she says a manager tried to convince her the harassment was “just a byproduct of being an attractive woman who works at a company with a French culture, and thus, should simply be tolerated.”

The suit claims that the unnamed harasser would “leer” at her, and once “lunged” across her, “thrusting his pelvis and genitals into her face.” He would also frequently allegedly attempt to kiss Newton either as a greeting or in celebration. The director of talent allegedly told Newton that the kissing was “what executives do in a French company.”

Newton says she alerted in-house counsel on multiple occasions between 2015 and 2018 before lodging an official complaint in May 2018. The company launched both an internal and a third-party investigation. LVMH says the investigations did not find any evidence of wrongdoing. However, Newton says the company only agreed to an investigation “reluctantly” and that the investigation was a “sham.” She also says she was slammed for “unjustifiably attacking” the man.

LVMH denied the allegations in a statement. “There is no merit whatsoever to the allegations in Ms. Newton’s suit. LVMH has clear policies prohibiting harassment and retaliation in the workplace and procedures to address any concerns raised.”

LVMH and Newton’s accounts differ on who was harassing her. LVMH’s statement says it was “a member of the company’s facilities staff,” while Newton describes him as, “a senior level management employee. ”"
LVMH Uses WeChat to Find Luxury Sales Stars of the Future - Jing Daily,"Mon, 22 Apr 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiLmh0dHBzOi8vamluZ2RhaWx5LmNvbS9wb3N0cy9pbnNpZGUtbHZtaC13ZWNoYXTSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"April 12 was not a usual Friday at the Lafayette Art & Design Center in Shanghai's Huangpu District. The Inside LVMH program culminated in a “discovery day” where 120 aspiring students gathered to interact with top LVMH executives, share fresh ideas for the future of retail, and hopefully find their dream career in one of the world’s top luxury companies.

After the first Inside LVMH in Paris in 2016, the fashion house decided to stage a second edition in China, where they invited Chinese youth to discover the depth and breadth of expertise the company had to offer. “This is to promote our engagement with Chinese youth,” said Andrew Wu, LVMH Group President Greater China. “As our group pioneered direct retail operation of international luxury brands in China from 1992-1993, we have literally been ‘growing up’ with this same young Chinese generation, which is an extraordinary connection.”

On March 4, the fashion house launched a WeChat Mini Program that invited Chinese youth to explore six major business lines like fashion & leather goods and watches & jewelry via the app. In the Mini Program, students were able to listen to LVMH employees talk about their experiences, as well as sign up for the event. “In China, everyone is engaged on WeChat,” explained Eliz Ho, HR Development Director at LVMH China. “Hence, it is very logical and easy for us to connect with our target audience, which is the university students in China.”

Within two weeks, LVMH’s WeChat Mini Program triggered 9,500 registrations, and over 1,500 students shared their writing or video submissions for the brand’s “Client Experience of Tomorrow” talent call. Out of those applications, 200 students from more than 50 universities were selected to join store tours within 20 of the group’s Maisons, including Louis Vuitton, Dior, Chaumet, and Sephora, in Shanghai and Beijing on April 1-3. 120 of those students were awarded tickets to the big day on April 12.

Those chosen were greeted with a special challenge. They were divided into 20 teams and coached by LVMH senior executives and HR to imagine an in-store experience that would surprise and delight luxury clients of today and tomorrow. “In China, the luxury consumers are getting younger and younger,” said Ho. “We want Chinese millennials to share with us their views on creating the client experience of tomorrow — how to design new experiences and excite customers differently. Because [the students] are also our customers, so their views are the most relevant to us.”

So what specifically is LVMH looking for with their “Client Experience of Tomorrow”? Andrew Wu used an interesting analogy to explain it. “Luxury retail is like a stage. You can find set-up, lighting, music, costumes and all kinds of cultural elements. When you are a customer, you see the ‘performance’ of products. When you work in retail, you create that performance to touch your audience. Our industry is about emotions, rather than reason.”

After rounds of pitches, a panel that included Wu would vote for the winners. And while LVMH hasn’t disclosed the four winning teams and their ideas yet, what we do know is that LVMH has promised the victors a breakfast session with Andrew Wu and internship opportunities with their desired brands. Those brands also conducted speed interviews during the event, which resulted in as many as 100 internships across 25 brands. These internships covered various functions, from marketing to digital strategies, but they all emphasized luxury retail.

“The LVMH Group has much to offer,” said Anne Laure Despeaux, Employer Branding Director at LVMH. “We welcome young people who are curious, have the entrepreneurial spirit, and dare to make an impact.” And she had a bit of advice for those who aspire to enter the luxury industry as well. “What people often see from the outside is the glamorous side of working in the luxury industry, be it a fashion show or rubbing shoulders with celebrities,” she said. “Inside, it is obviously about hard work. Every day we challenge ourselves, push the boundaries, and deliver extraordinary experiences for our clients.”"
LVMH earnings beat expectations—again - Vogue Business,"Fri, 12 Apr 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZvZ3VlYnVzaW5lc3MuY29tL2NvbXBhbmllcy9sdm1oLWZpcnN0LXF1YXJ0ZXItZWFybmluZ3MtcmVsZWFzZdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LVMH keeps marching ahead. The French luxury conglomerate’s Q1 2019 earnings, reported after the Paris Bourse closed on Wednesday, once again outperformed analyst expectations.

Here’s what you need to know:

Group revenue increased by 16 per cent to €12.5 billion year-on-year, surpassing HSBC’s forecast of 14 per cent. Every business line saw growth, with its fashion and leather segment notching an increase of 20 per cent.

Virgil Abloh’s first men’s collection for Louis Vuitton was well-received by shoppers. While ready-to-wear is only a small component of sales at LVMH’s marquee fashion brand, LVMH CFO Jean-Jacques Guiony said in an earnings call that both men’s and women’s expanded at “very high levels”.

Louis Vuitton’s Chinese customers are spending more at home as the government cuts taxes and cracks down on daigou. This isn’t occurring at the expense of Europe, but markets geographically closer to the Mainland such as Macau have taken a hit. This shouldn’t make much difference to LVMH since its margins are comparable in most markets.

Celine’s performance under Hedi Slimane’s creative direction is “too early to comment on”, Guiony said, adding that LVMH remains “extremely optimistic”. The first pieces designed by Phoebe Philo’s successor hit stores in February.

Makeup sales at Sephora in the US are under pressure, but the beauty retailer’s skincare business is expanding very quickly. LVMH foresees this continuing going forward.

Investors were pleased, with shares reaching an all-time high on Thursday.

LVMH's Louis Vuitton and Sephora Brands Are Locking In Teen Shoppers - Yahoo Finance,"Thu, 11 Apr 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9sdm1oLWFwb3MtbG91aXMtdnVpdHRvbi1zZXBob3JhLTE1MjYwMDMxMi5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Piper Jaffray recently released its semiannual ""Taking Stock With Teens"" survey for spring 2019, which polled 8,000 U.S. teens regarding their favorite brands. The average age of the respondents was 16.3, and the average household income was $67,700.

LVMH (NASDAQOTH: LVMUY), the world's largest luxury goods company, held leading positions in two major categories. Its flagship Louis Vuitton brand ranked third in the top handbags category with an 11% mindshare, compared with 7% last spring. Capri Holdings' (NYSE: CPRI) Michael Kors ranked first with a 28% share, followed by Tapestry's (NYSE: TPR) Kate Spade at 14%.

LVMH's Sephora stores ranked second in the beauty destinations category with a 31% mindshare, but that marked a drop from its 44% level last spring. Ulta Beauty (NASDAQ: ULTA), which overtook Sephora for the first time, led the teen market at 33%.

LVMH's strength in the teen market is impressive, since most of its 70 brands sell high-end luxury products geared toward older shoppers. Let's see how LVMH expanded beyond its core market of affluent adults to lock in a younger market.

How Louis Vuitton won over teen shoppers

Delphine Arnault, the daughter of LVMH CEO Bernard Arnault, became the executive VP of Louis Vuitton six years ago. The younger Arnault, who was 38 at the time, had been ""groomed since her teens"" to take on the role, according to Reuters.

Louis Vuitton subsequently launched teen-oriented campaigns in Teen Vogue, hired younger celebrities like Sophie Turner, Indya Moore, and Chloe Grace Moretz to star in its ads, and recently launched a ""School Teens"" campaign to promote its new brightly-colored, so-called Taïgarama leather products to younger shoppers.

The line includes head-turning products like glow-in-the-dark bags and phone cases, as well as pricey skateboard-themed products with streetwear designer Supreme. It also established a massive social media presence with more than 31 million followers on Instagram -- where over 26% of users are ages 24 and below .

Story continues

Simply put, Arnault refreshed Louis Vuitton for younger shoppers, and its growing mindshare among teens reflects that. That's also one of the main reasons that LVMH's fashion and leather revenues grew 15% last year on an organic basis and accounted for 39% of its top line.

Sephora is still strong...but it faces competition

Sephora, one of the main growth engines of LVMH's selective retailing group, generated 28% of the group's sales in 2018. Its revenue rose 6% on an organic basis during the year, with Sephora posting ""solid revenue growth"" and ""market share gains"" in North America and Asia.

The cosmetics store targets shoppers of all ages, and Piper Jaffray's survey indicates that it's still a top beauty destination for teens. Sephora often introduces its products in Teen Vogue, sells teen-oriented products in a ""best gifts for teenage girls"" section, and started offering free makeup classes for younger shoppers in 2016.

Sephora plans to expand its U.S. presence by opening 35 new brick-and-mortar stores this year. It currently operates more than 460 stores across the Americas, as well as 660 locations inside JCPenney's department stores.

Sephora is likely expanding its presence in response to the growth of Ulta Beauty, which offers salon services in its cosmetic and skincare product stores, as well as less-expensive, ""drug store"" beauty brands. Ulta finished 2018 with 1,174 locations across the U.S., and plans to open about 80 new stores in 2019. Piper's survey indicates that ongoing expansion is luring teen shoppers away from Sephora.

The key takeaways

I own shares of LVMH because it runs a well-diversified business, and its focus on high-end customers makes it a more recession-resistant play than Capri or Tapestry, which both generate a large percentage of their sales from mid-range customers.

The strength of LVMH's flagship LV brand among teens is yet another bullish catalyst for the stock. Sephora could face pressure from Ulta in the near term, but both retailers should retain significant leads against other beauty destinations for the foreseeable future, particularly as they work to gain the trust (and business) of younger consumers.

LVMH Revenues Soar With Virgil Abloh and Kim Jones Leading the Way - Complex,"Thu, 11 Apr 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNvbXBsZXguY29tL3N0eWxlL2EvaGFubmFoLWxpZnNodXR6L3ZpcmdpbC1hYmxvaC1hcnJpdmFsLWxvdWlzLXZ1aXR0b24taW1wYWN0ZWQtbHZtaC1yZXZlbnVlc9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Luxury fashion conglomerate LVMH announced Thursday that the company has seen expansive revenue growth this past quarter— a double-digit surge that coincides with the arrivals of creative directors Kim Jones at Dior Men and Virgil Abloh at Louis Vuitton Men's.

In comparison to the first quarter of 2018, LVMH saw a 16% increase during the first financial period of 2019, greatly surpassing initial estimates. Although the French luxury group doesn't reveal the monetary contributions of specific brands, the company cited Louis Vuitton's ""exceptional"" performance and noted that the brand's ""creativity"" is ""ever more striking and innovative, and its Men’s and Women’s Autumn-Winter fashion shows were universally acclaimed.""

Virgil Abloh's appointment to the creative helm of Louis Vuitton prompted many in the fashion industry to acknowledge the magnified influence of streetwear in luxury fashion. His rise to prominence within the industry as the creative director and founder of Off-White, secured the cult of personality he then brought to Louis Vuitton in 2018. Although his notoriety certainly bolstered the brand's creative pursuits, Abloh has also cited his disruptive approach to fashion as a tool for expansion.

""My premier position is just to translate brand into current culture. The brands that I choose to work with are usually best in category and they also have some heritage to them,"" the designer told CNBC last year. ""And my goal is to sort of articulate that heritage in a new refreshing way to a younger consumer.""

In Thursday's announcement, LVMH also applauded Christian Dior, whose men's collections are ideated by acclaimed designer Kim Jones, for performing ""exceptionally well."" Although the designer's transition from Louis Vuitton to Dior wasn't as scrutinized as Abloh's appointment, his integration of pop culture and street style into his designs has also made the brand more appealing to younger audiences. Most recently, the designer collaborated with Brooklyn-based artist KAWS for Dior Men's SS19, which only heightened the fanfare following his debut.

As noted by Bloomberg, the luxury fashion market is continuing to grow, and that expansion can be attributed to millennial and Gen Z customers' willingness to spend on high-end retail. Both Abloh and Jones have been known to stack their front-rows with celebrities from the worlds of music and design, likely bolstering their pop culture influence, and their appeal among younger fashion-enthusiasts."

Louis Vuitton Retains Star Aura As LVMH Powers Into 2019 - WWD,"Thu, 11 Apr 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vd3dkLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy1uZXdzL2ZpbmFuY2lhbC9sb3Vpcy12dWl0dG9uLXN0YXItYnJhbmQtYXMtbHZtaC1wb3N0cy1zdHJvbmctcGVyZm9ybWFuY2UtaW4tZmlyc3QtcXVhcnRlci0xMjAzMTAzOTA0L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS — New designers may be grabbing the headlines, but as LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton charges into 2019, the strong performance of its fashion and leather goods division is still all about one brand: Louis Vuitton.

In the last 12 months, the world’s largest luxury group has appointed new creative directors at Celine and Berluti, and in the men’s wear divisions at Vuitton and Dior.

As Hedi Slimane’s first women’s and men’s designs hit the shelves of revamped Celine stores worldwide, management remained tight-lipped about the label’s sales performance so far.

Speaking to analysts the day after LVMH published better-than-expected first-quarter results, chief financial officer Jean-Jacques Guiony said the group does not break down the performance of individual brands, but refuted one analyst’s suggestion that Slimane’s collections have received mixed reviews.

“We had a very, very good runway show in late February, early March and we got nothing in terms of mixed reviews for that. All the reviews were extremely positive so we remain extremely optimistic as far as Celine is concerned. But it’s too early to comment,” Guiony said on a conference call.

While Slimane’s debut collection in September was polarizing, with some critics regretting its youthful focus and similarity to his previous designs for Saint Laurent, his sophomore show on March 2 was lauded for crystallizing the trend for bourgeois elegance that is making a major comeback for fall.

Though LVMH chairman and chief executive officer Bernard Arnault is banking on the Slimane effect to double or triple revenues at Celine within five years, that implies massive investments in stores and communication, meaning that the group is relying for now on bigger brands to provide growth momentum.

Its labels — which include Fendi, Loewe, Berluti and Loro Piana — are thriving collectively, fueled by continued strong demand from Chinese shoppers, who account for a third of sales of high-end goods worldwide.

LVMH’s key fashion and leather goods division posted 15 percent growth in organic terms in the three months ending March 31, outperforming all other divisions. “Overall, we are extremely satisfied with the global performance of the portfolio,” said Guiony. “Some brands like Christian Dior and Vuitton did particularly well.”

He credited the strong performance of Vuitton, which last year sailed over 10 billion euros in revenues, to a combination of marketing, product and distribution strategy. The brand recently reopened boutiques in Florence, London, Monaco and Shanghai, and inaugurated a new leather goods workshop in Beaulieu-sur-Layon in France.

Guiony said that while Vuitton’s high level of in-house production had capped its growth in the past, the brand was moving swiftly to increase speed and capacity.

“The production and supply chain people at Vuitton have done a fantastic job in enabling us to develop the production and the number of items that they put into the stores in a tremendous way, first with the same levels of ateliers, and after that by opening up new ateliers,” he said, referring to its leather goods workshops.

“That enables us to grow at double-digit levels in volume terms, and it’s been going on for a while, which probably 10 years ago wouldn’t have been thinkable. I think we’ve done a very good job there and we will continue monitoring the production capabilities, adding new ateliers in France when we think it makes sense and where we think it makes sense,” the executive added.

Asia was by far the main driver of LVMH’s growth in the first quarter, defying concerns over an economic slowdown in China. Excluding Japan, the region posted a sales increase of 17 percent in organic terms. Japan, meanwhile, recorded a healthy 9 percent rise, followed by the United States with 8 percent, and Europe with 7 percent.

The fashion and leather goods division saw stable growth in Europe, increasing growth in China and a slowdown in the rest of Asia, as Chinese government measures to boost domestic consumption prompted its citizens to spend more at home.

Vuitton, along with other major luxury brands, dropped prices in China by 3 percent after a cut in value-added tax came into effect there on April 1.

“The Chinese customer for Vuitton in Q1 was up double digits, in line with what we’ve seen in preceding quarters,” said Guiony.

“Due to the fact that the price gaps between Asia and China have narrowed significantly, we see less growth and less business being done outside China,” he added. “It’s mainly done at the expense of markets surrounding China, and not European markets.”

He noted Chinese shoppers were spending less in Hong Kong and Macau, and had diverted some spending in Europe to the United Kingdom from France, where violent protests by the anti-government yellow vests movement have taken a toll on luxury retail in recent months.

LVMH is keeping up with the changes in tourist flows by relying increasingly on temporary stores. For example, a pop-up shop in Tokyo carrying Virgil Abloh’s debut men’s wear collection for Vuitton in January raked in 30 percent more in the first 48 hours than Vuitton’s collaborative collection with Supreme in 2018.

“That is something we have developed over the last couple of years. We shall do about 100 pop-up stores in 2018 after 80 last year, and this is the privileged way and the main way to drive innovation and newness from a pure retail viewpoint in front of the customer,” said Guiony.

“This trend of pop-up stores is extremely important and we will continue developing that, because it enables us to be talking in a different way to our clients in different places,” he explained. “It adds flexibility to a retail network which, by definition, is a bit rigid.”

And while Abloh is busy racking up accolades, Guiony was keen to point out that Nicolas Ghesquière’s women’s ready-to-wear for Vuitton has been selling equally well.

“We are very satisfied with both the women’s and the men’s business. They are of similar sizes altogether, but the growth rate is more or less the same at very high levels,” he said.

Luca Solca, managing director, luxury goods at Sanford C. Bernstein, estimated ready-to-wear accounts for less than 5 percent of revenues at Vuitton. But Guiony said the category has a halo effect.

“Last year, this business was already very good but it is particularly good this year. It’s not a major business altogether for us at Vuitton, but it’s worth pointing out as this is obviously a traffic generator for many stores and we are very happy that this business is doing particularly well,” said Guiony."

"Bernard Arnault Talks Hedi Slimane, Rihanna and Karl Lagerfeld at LVMH's Annual Shareholder Meeting - The Business of Fashion","Thu, 18 Apr 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5idXNpbmVzc29mZmFzaGlvbi5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvbHV4dXJ5L2Jlcm5hcmQtYXJuYXVsdC10YWxrcy1oZWRpLXNsaW1hbmUtcmloYW5uYS1hbmQta2FybC1sYWdlcmZlbGQtYXQtbHZtaHMtYW5udWFsLXNoYXJlaG9sZGVyLW1lZXRpbmcv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS, France — LVMH chairman and chief executive Bernard Arnault took a victory lap at the luxury group's annual meeting Thursday, for the first time touting the early success of Hedi Slimane's Celine and teasing high-profile projects to come.

During his presentation to more than 2,000 shareholders, the executive underscored the company's continued commitment to creating a desirable product that offers consumers ""meaning"" and ""a reason to buy."" In 2018, the company posted record results, generating global sales of €46 billion euros, with Rihanna's Fenty Beauty line generating nearly €500 million in revenue and Louis Vuitton posting more than €10 billion.

Shares jumped last week after the company reported strong sales for the first quarter of 2019, ending Thursday at €352.80, a record high and a 37 percent gain for the year. The company also announced a dividend of €6 per share for the 2018 fiscal year, up 20 percent from €5 per share a year earlier.

Hedi Slimane is an outstanding designer, who managed to achieve global success at Dior Homme

Arnault called out successes at smaller maisons including Loewe, as well as a strong performance at Dior, boosted by the arrival of menswear designer Kim Jones and chief executive Pietro Beccari. He also touted Celine creative director Hedi Slimane, whose first store concepts and collections have finally materialised, calling his polarising arrival a ""great success."" (On last week's first-quarter 2019 earnings call, chief financial officer Jean-Jacques Guiony said it was ""too early"" to discuss the collection's commercial success.)

""Hedi Slimane is an outstanding designer, who managed to achieve global success at Dior Homme and who is well on his way with women's and men's collections [at Celine],"" Arnault said, calling Slimane's Autumn/Winter 2019 show, which was much better received by critics than his debut, sensational.

“There already are waiting lists in stores to buy [his creations],” he added. “I just hope we’ll manage to manufacture sufficiently.”

The meeting, held at the Carrousel du Louvre on Thursday, featured a panel of LVMH executives fielding questions from a wide range of investors. Alongside the analysts, investors and family trust managers were representatives from People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, which bought stake in the group in 2017 in order to apply pressure regarding its use of exotic skins. At one point, an outspoken individual shareholder filed a poetic complaint regarding his seat in the auditorium, which was further back because he owned less than 10 shares of LVMH stock.

It was probably the longest collaboration ever between a designer and a house

Arnault gave a simple “next question” response to that particular grievance, but he addressed several more pressing points around the company’s strategy with at least a little more depth.

He also announced Fendi's plans to stage a Karl Lagerfeld tribute show in June, which will feature creations from his 54 years designing for the Italian furrier, followed by an exhibition.

“It was probably the longest collaboration ever between a designer and a house,” he noted. There was no further communication regarding who might succeed Lagerfeld at the house.

Arnault was tight-lipped regarding the upcoming launch of Rihanna's standalone apparel brand, dubbed Project Loud France, in which LVMH is thought to hold a 51 percent stake.

“I appreciate your interest in Rihanna. I am [interested] too, she's an extraordinary singer,” he said. “But we like surprises…. As it’s a surprise, I will not tell you more.”

On the acquisition of hotel group Belmond, which closed this week, the executive underscored the significance of “experience” to the overall business, noting that most properties would not be absorbed into the company’s Cheval Blanc hotel group.

“We will study on a case-by-case basis,” he said, but the intention is to keep the two groups as separate brands.

Arnault also bristled at criticisms regarding the group's €200 million donation to help rebuild the cathedral of Notre-Dame, which was ravaged by a fire on Monday.

“It’s appalling that in France you are criticised for doing work in the public interest,” he said, adding that the company had already hit the limit on tax deductions under the country’s patronage law because of its art museum, Fondation Louis Vuitton.

Our essential partner is nature

Arnault offered new details regarding LVMH’s approach to social responsibility and sustainability, areas where rival Kering speaks out publicly on a regular basis.

“Our essential partner is nature,” Arnault said, noting that the group has a “particular interest in ecology” and any process that can make product development more sustainable, such as tight regulation on supply chains and using new tools such as Edibox, a tool that helps make packaging that has a smaller impact on the environment.

It has also examined its leather use in certain businesses, with Arnault noting that the company is researching alternatives. He also mentioned that the company’s internal carbon fund, introduced in 2015, doubled in 2018.

LVMH has also demonstrated an interest in developing young brands with sustainable business models. Last year, the group invested in conscience-luxury label Gabriela Hearst through one of its investment arms, LVMH Luxury Ventures.

When pressed by Peta regarding LVMH's use of exotic animal skins, including crocodiles and ostriches, general counsel Bernard Kuhn said that the group has established a ""new and extremely constraining system"" for certifying and auditing breeders, noting that all farms supplying its Singapore-based tanneries would be certified by the end of 2020. Rival Chanel recently announced it would stop using exotic skins, although unlike LVMH and Hermès, it does not own crocodile farms.

Shareholders also voted on nominees to the board of directors, including activist-photographer Yann Arthus-Bertrand, who will serve as a board observer, advising the company regarding environmental initiatives, as well as Sophie Chassat, a philosopher, who will be a permanent board member.

Disclosure: LVMH is part of a group of investors who, together, hold a minority interest in The Business of Fashion. All investors have signed shareholders’ documentation guaranteeing BoF’s complete editorial independence.

France’s three wealthiest families are coming to the rescue of a national icon, spearheading a fundraising drive to rebuild Notre Dame that has topped $700 million.

The billionaires behind luxury giants LVMH Group, Kering and L’Oreal on Tuesday pledged a combined €500 million ($565 million) after a massive fire ripped through the Paris cathedral.

LVMH and its CEO Bernard Arnault have promised €200 million ($226 million). The donation has been matched by the Bettencourt Meyers family, which controls L’Oreal (LRLCF).

The Pinault family, which operates luxury conglomerate Kering (PPRUF), has pledged €100 million ($113 million).

The three fashion dynasties have invoked patriotism and shared cultural identity in explaining their generosity following the devastating fire.

Other French companies have also written big checks: The oil and gas company Total (TOT) has promised €100 million ($113 million), while tech and consulting firm Capgemini will give €1 million ($1.1 million).

Combined with other donations from companies including French bank Crédit Agricole, the total amount pledged by business and wealthy donors has reached $700 million.

Luxury giving

LVMH, which owns Louis Vuitton, Christian Dior and Givenchy, said in a statement that its donation showed “solidarity with this national tragedy” and that funds would be used to rebuild this “extraordinary cathedral.”

The fashion house went on to describe Notre Dame as a “symbol of French heritage and unity.” LVMH said it would make its creative and financial teams available to help with rebuilding and soliciting donations.

Arnault, its CEO, is the third richest person in the world, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. His net worth comes in at $90.4 billion, more than that of Warren Buffett or Mark Zuckerberg.

In addition to its fashion lines, LVMH controls high-end alcohol brands such as Dom Pérignon, Hennessy and Veuve Clicquot, as well as popular beauty retailer Sephora.

Kering, which is the home for brands including Gucci and Yves Saint Laurent, was first out of the gate Tuesday with its donation.

“This tragedy is striking all the French people, and beyond that, all those attached to spiritual values,” François-Henri Pinault, the CEO of Kering, said in a statement.

“Faced with this tragedy, everyone wishes to give life back to this jewel of our heritage as soon as possible,” added Pinault, who is the son of the billionaire businessman François Pinault.

The Pinault family is worth an estimated $37.3 billion, per Bloomberg.

François-Henri Pinault, who manages the family’s businesses, is married to actress Salma Hayek. Kering also owns fashion brands such as Alexander McQueen and Balenciaga.

The Bettencourt family owns a 33% stake in L’Oreal, which controls brands like Maybelline, Lancome, Garnier and Kiehl’s.

Francoise Bettencourt Meyers, the richest woman in the world, is worth $53.5 billion, according to Bloomberg.

She inherited the stake from her mother, Liliane Bettencourt, who died in 2017. Bettencourt Meyers is the granddaughter of the company’s founder, Eugene Schueller.

The rebuilding process

The blaze at Notre Dame on Monday devastated large parts of the 850-year-old church, including its iconic spire. The fire was extinguished after nine hours.

French President Emmanuel Macron has promised to rebuild the site, saying Monday that France will launch an international fundraising campaign to assist with the effort.

The process will be expensive and lengthy, and it could take time to begin in earnest. Immediate steps will need to be taken to prevent further damage, since the structure is now particularly vulnerable to water damage.

It’s tough to estimate the total time and cost of the restoration.

The Venice Opera House, which was gutted by a blaze in 1996, reportedly reopened eight years later after €60 million ($68 million) was spent.

When Windsor Castle, one of Britain’s royal residences, was severely damaged in a fire in 1992, it reopened nearly five years later at a cost of £36.5 million ($47.8 million).

is one of France’s most valuable conglomerates, and , its chairman, is Europe’s richest man, yet the luxury baron insisted on Thursday at the annual shareholders meeting that the behemoth of over 50 luxury marques is really just a family affair. Even as he expressed shock at internet attacks on LVMH’s decision to donate €200 million to the restoration of Notre Dame; and predicted that his group would soon have as many women executives as men managers.







The executive committee at the AGM of LVMH, April 18, 2019 in Paris





In both an address to some 2,000 shareholders and while answering questions inside the exhibition space, Arnault also predicted that Hennessy brandy would soon become the world’s best-selling spirit, “all categories included,” and he raved about the “renewal of design talent” at LVMH’s three largest French fashion and accessories houses: , Christian and .



Arnault also revealed that would stage a special commemorative show devoted to creations by the late this summer in Rome. The deceased German couturier was the creative director of the Roman fur and fashion house for over five decades.

“It was with great sadness that we bid farewell to Karl, who was the heart and soul of this label. It is without a doubt the longest relationship between a label and a designer. In July, by the way, we will organize a runway show in Rome in tribute to Karl, reprising all his creations chez Fendi.”



However, he played dumb when asked directly in questions from the floor by on his future plans for . As reported, LVMH’s fashion group has created a company called Loud, apparently named after the singer’s fifth studio album. LVMH has also injected €60 million into the company and even named a president, LVMH executive Jean-Baptiste Voisin. Project Loud’s office is in the same building on rue Jean Goujon that houses LVMH’s fashion division.



“Yes, we are interested in Rihanna. You too I imagine. She’s an extraordinary singer. But you have surprised me, and as it’s a surprise, I cannot say more,” said Arnault, with a barely concealed wink to the members of his board, who flanked him on the rostrum.



However, he did confirm a further FashionNetwork.com question that Christian Dior had indeed acquired a large retail space at 127 avenue des Champs-Elysées, “which will be a pop up. It’s a temporary space which we will use during the work on our flagship at avenue , which will undergo extensive renovation. I hope that when the work begins on our temporary space, that the problem of the yellow vest protests will be sorted out. If not, we will just have to wait a little.”



However, he denied recent reports that LVMH had discreetly approached possible buyers for Pucci, the colorful Florentine fashion house. “Oh, that doesn’t seem to be exactly right. The business is not for sale.”



And he declined requests that LVMH reveal the size of its stake in online agglomerator, Business of Fashion. BoF, as it is known, runs a disclaimer after all articles on LVMH, which reads: “Disclosure: LVMH is part of a group of investors who, together, hold a minority interest in The Business of Fashion. All investors have signed shareholders’ documentation guaranteeing BoF’s complete editorial independence.”



“Oh! That’s a tiny old investment which we made long ago,” said Arnault, flicking his hand, as if to brush some fluff off his lapel.



Even before Arnault spoke he was applauded. And he got an enormous burst of applause when one shareholder complimented him on the group’s donation of €200 million for the restoration of Notre-Dame.



“There has been a false polemic on the web about this. We don’t get any tax break from this. It’s a false polemic. But it’s quite disconcerting that in France, one gets criticized even when one does something to help something in the general interest. Unfortunately, this has been subject of criticism on some TV shows where pettiness reigns rather than the search for the common good. For me, Notre-Dame is a unique church and an eternal symbol of France,” he sighed.







Notre-Dame on fire, Monday, April 15, 2019





By any standards, LVMH’s 2018 results were impressive: sales of almost €47 billion; with over €25 billion alone in the second six months. Moreover, in the opening quarter of 2019, the group enjoyed 16% growth in sales to €12.53 billion.



In a financial presentation, its CFO Jean-Jacques Guiony noted that LVMH’s two key markets remain China and the USA, with 29% and 24% of total sales respectively. The two key divisions within LVMH, which includes a stable of some 50 luxury brands, are Fashion and Leather Goods, with €15.472 billion in turnover (up 21%) and Selective Distribution, led by beauty retailer , at €13.311 billion (up 29%).



Net profit also rose by 18% to €6.354 billion, while operating profit rose to €10.003 billion, meaning an increase of nearly €2 billion. That left LVMH with relatively modest levels of debt, just €5.487 billion, and able to boast €5.4 billion in cash flow, all the better to fund future acquisitions. The AGM also approved a dividend of €6 per share, which Guiony noted means “that each year we try share with shareholders half of our net profit.”



Taking the rostrum, Arnault, dressed in a navy blue suit, with his Legion of pin prominent on the lapel, raved about the “exceptional performance by Louis Vuitton.”



“For the first time, the brand has passed turnover of over €10 billion,” beamed Arnault, though coughing occasionally.



The executive lauded “the renewal at many of our fashion houses,” and several brands’ “exceptional shows,” along with the arrival of Virgil Abloh as the menswear designer of Vuitton.



“Nearly every product he has made have already largely sold. His products sell like bottles of Romanée Conti and with the quality of Vuitton. And within a few hours they are sold for much more on the web. That is not our goal, but it shows the success of this unique produce!” enthused Arnault.



After praising youth, in an aside, he praised the value of experience in his management team. “Personally, when I get on a plane I prefer the pilot to have white hair rather than have someone very young,” he joked, to much amusement.



Turning to Christian Dior, the luxury billionaire hailed a “very successful performance, adding that “Pietro understands our creative director well, as they are both Italians,” referring to CEO and women’s designer ; while also extolling the menswear designer Kim Jones as “working so well.”



In a playful mood, he chimed about the success of the Dior exhibition in the in London: “So many people wanted to see it, they had to extend it. Which made Pietro happy as the museum even asked to pay!” drawing a burst of laughter from the rather elderly audience.

“Another very important development was arrival of , under the management hands of . It has been a great success. He is an exceptional creator, who at Dior Homme achieved worldwide success. His latest men’s show in Place de la Concorde was sensational. There is already a waiting list for products. We hope we are able to produce enough,” laughed Arnault.



Finally, he lauded Jonathan Anderson, the designer of , for bringing “stunning growth with this brand.”



Elsewhere, he had warm words for the “dynamic development” of Dior Parfums; and the “beautiful performance and market share gains” of Italian jeweler . “Its ultra-flat watches are incredible and have won all the prizes for watches in Switzerland!” Brand eulogy followed brand eulogy; Sephora with “an incredible performance” having opened about 100 new stores and seeing huge success in China; or Bon Marché for “leading retailing in Paris.”



Turning to hotel chain Belmond, of which LVMH completed the acquisition last week for $3.2 billion, Arnault explained the diversification in the following manner.



“These hotels that you may know are magnificent – the Cipriani in Venice, the Splendido in Portofino or others in Sicily. Remarkable hotels that, yes, will need some investment. They are part of our goal to search for experiences that interest many of our clients today. They want not just the best quality products – but also experiences,” he argued.



Though his voice was warmest when speaking of the , thrilled that over 5 million people have visited the art space since it opened in 2014. Currently it is staging ‘The Courtauld Collection: A Vision for Impressionism.’ “More people are queuing to see the painting of Van Gogh with his jaw broken there than the Mona Lisa in the Louvre at the moment!” he crowed.



However, he became somewhat incensed when asked about black market sales of counterfeit luxury products.



“We worked hard on getting the police to stop this scourge, financed by badly frequented milieu, some of them practically terrorists. It’s a plague that hurts all French and European brands. We asked the state to stop these sales on the beaches of the South of France. They would arrest these people with backpacks pull of fakes, but then let them go after just four hours. But now we’ve got the state to seize the products – and these people never circulate anymore! But when we cross the border into Italy they still circulate freely, as we have not managed to convince the Italian government to do the same thing,” he snorted.



Looking ahead, Arnault announced his now-familiar warning about the need for “vigilance,” even as he predicted the continued growth of a new generation of consumers.



“The key word in our group is desire and ‘how do you create desire?’ I am very optimism in the long term – but we need to be aware that the almost euphoric growth worldwide might continue for at least another decade but it won’t last forever... We are investing continually in France – and we will always emphasize an extreme attention to quality. We could grow faster but must never pass the point where our products will suffer in quality… And, LVMH has again been voted the most attractive employer in France!” he opined.



“Our group has a family element – it is not managed by an anonymous group. But by a family, as indeed all these houses within LVMH started as a family. And, that’s the family spirit that we want to maintain,” said Arnault, three of whose children, Delphine (general director of Vuitton); Antoine (CEO of and president of Loro Piana) and Alexandre (CEO of Rimowa) all sat front row.



It has been estimated that the Arnault Family Group, the holding company of Bernard Arnault, controls some 47% of LVMH's stock and 63% of its voting rights.



And, one could also not help noticing that of the half-century of LVMH brands, the giant backdrop featured barely a dozen: a Vuitton dress worn by actress Alicia Vikander; Berluti shoes; a Rimowa suitcase; Dom Pérignon and Hennessy bottles; Dior bags; a Sephora store entrance; and the Fondation Louis Vuitton.



Only Delphine, however, sits on the LVMH Executive Committee, which duly took its place for the question session, sitting on plush armchairs. Rather oddly, only Arnault answered queries, even when they were addressed directly to several of his CEOs. Apart from Delphine, the board is all-male, except for Chantal Gaemperle, head of human resources.



Nonetheless, Arnault insisted: “Parity (within LVMH) between men and women managers will be reached soon!”

"Hedi Slimane's Debut Celine Wares Spawn Waiting Lists, as LVMH Says it Has Seen ""No Mixed Reviews"" - The Fashion Law","Fri, 19 Apr 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWZhc2hpb25sYXcuY29tL2hlZGktc2xpbWFuZXMtZGVidXQtY2VsaW5lLXdhcmVzLXNwYXduLXdhaXRpbmctbGlzdHMtYXMtbHZtaC1zYXlzLWl0LWhhcy1zZWVuLW5vLW1peGVkLXJldmlld3Mv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Hedi Slimane’s debut offerings for Celine have spawned waiting lists in stores, LVMH chairman Bernard Arnault revealed at the group’s annual shareholders meeting on Thursday. The 50-year old creative made his highly-anticipated debut at Celine in January with a collection of typical short-and-tight, rocker-inspired Slimane fare, which was met with over-arching praise for what would certainly be the cause for commercial success, and at the same time, no shortage of reviews soaked which skepticism due to the seeming lack of evolution in aesthetic compared to the nearly-identical wares he shown during his tenure at rival conglomerate Kering-owned Saint Laurent.

Less than a week prior, LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton’s chief financial officer Jean-Jacques Guiony set a slightly more cautious – but nonetheless “extremely optimistic” – tone about Celine in a call with investors, revealing that with Slimane’s debut Spring/Summer 2019 collection just hitting stores, “it’s just the beginning of it,” and “too early” the properly gauge commercial success.

When asked by Bernstein’s luxury segment analyst Luca Solca about the state of Celine, including the “mixed reviews” he says that the financial consultancy is getting “on our end from our contacts” about Slimane’s Celine, Guiony stated that LVMH has received no such thing.

“You mentioned that you got mixed report or reviews,” Guiony told Sola, but “actually we [did not].” The CFO continued, “We had a very, very good runway show in late February, early March and we got nothing in terms of mixed review for that. All the reviews were extremely positive. So we remain extremely optimistic that as far as Celine is concerned but it’s too early to comment.”

Elsewhere under the LVMH umbrella, Guiony announced that the Louis Vuitton brand will host 100 different pop-up events this year as part of a larger plan to maintain its spot atop the luxury fashion food chain. Guiony told analysts that the brand’s temporary outposts – such as the one staged in London’s Mayfair neighborhood in October in furtherance of its plan to slowly roll out menswear director Virgil Abloh’s debut offerings – are “extremely important … because [they] enable us to be talking in a different way to our clients and add flexibility with our network.”

In his view, Giony stated that in addition to demand throughout the world, including in China, largely for the brand’s leather goods, as distinct from men’s and women’s ready-to-wear, which is “not a major business” for Vuitton, the main drivers for the Paris-based conglomerate’s marquee brand are “obviously a combination of marketing products and distribution strategies.” Pop up shops fall neatly within that realm.

With revenues of over 10 billion euros ($11.27 billion), Louis Vuitton holds the title of the world’s biggest luxury brand by sales, “with privately-owned Chanel clipping at its heels, and Kering’s star brand Gucci on a mission to overtake it,” per Reuters."

According to the figures, the top 100 luxury goods companies accrued $247 billion USD in 2017, increasing $30 billion USD from the previous year’s $217 billion USD. The growth represents a hefty 10.8 percent lift, significantly outpacing the prior year’s gain of just one percent. Within the top ten alone, 48.2 percent of the total luxury sales were produced, marking a one percent increase over the previous year.

American cosmetics company Estée Lauder came in second, while Swiss jewelry label Richemont landed third.

How Luxury Fashion Learned to Love the Blockchain - The Business of Fashion,"Tue, 02 Apr 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzb2ZmYXNoaW9uLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy90ZWNobm9sb2d5L2hvdy1sdXh1cnktZmFzaGlvbi1sZWFybmVkLXRvLWxvdmUtdGhlLWJsb2NrY2hhaW4v0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS, France — Luxury brands were notoriously late to embrace e-commerce and social media. But some of the industry’s biggest players are determined to be ahead of the curve on blockchain.

LVMH, the world’s largest luxury conglomerate, is planning to use the technology to track luxury goods and prove their authenticity, blockchain news site CoinDesk reported last week. The platform, dubbed “Aura,” is expected to go live as soon as May with Louis Vuitton and Parfums Christian Dior, before being extended to the group’s other brands and competitors.

Meanwhile, Paris-based non-profit Arianee, which boasts advisors from LVMH rivals Richemont and Kering, is preparing to launch a similar database collectively managed by participating brands. Pilots are planned for later this quarter.

Arianee and LVMH are addressing the same problem: how to safeguard the authenticity of luxury goods in a market flooded with strikingly similar fakes. The global market for knock-offs is booming, with various estimates totalling annual sales of fakes in the hundreds of billions of dollars. The rise of online resale sites is creating a new market for counterfeits that has resisted traditional methods of policing.

Blockchain is the catch-all term for technology that permanently records transactions in a digital, tamper-proof database. Information is distributed across a network of computers rather than being controlled by a single entity, and is accessible to anyone in the network, but cannot be altered or deleted.

Blockchain’s highest-profile use is to enable Bitcoin and other crypto-currencies, but the technology is beginning to take hold in the global supply chains of large companies. Walmart will soon require suppliers of leafy greens to put their produce on the blockchain, making it easier to trace tainted vegetables back to their source.

<span>What the blockchain <i>can</i> do is form a database that many companies agree with the results of.</span>

In the opaque, highly competitive world of luxury fashion, blockchain’s main role is to connect brands and retailers that normally wouldn’t share information with rivals. For example, consignment sellers and even individual consumers could verify an item’s authenticity by comparing its digital signature to entries in a decentralised database. Brands could similarly track materials to ensure they were produced by ethical manufacturers.

“Many people apply blockchain to a project that a database could be used to do,” said Ken Seiff, venture capitalist and managing partner at Blockchange Ventures. “What the blockchain can do is form a database that many companies agree with the results of.”

In the diamond industry, big brands like De Beers and smaller start-ups like Taylor & Hart use blockchain to help trace their supply chains from mine to shop floor. De Beers led an industry effort , along with five other diamond manufacturers, to develop an open-source blockchain platform called Tracr, announced in May last year.

Taylor & Hart partnered with blockchain start-up Everledger. Currently, the jeweller is using the technology to authenticate the provenance of its diamonds. Chief executive Nikolay Piriankov said he hopes to introduce a “blockchain wallet,” where customers could keep appraisals of their jewellery. An easily accessed, un-forgeable appraisal would help with insurance proceedings, and give customers a greater sense of ownership for custom-made designs.

<span>Blockchain is kind of a buzzword, most people use it without exactly knowing what's behind it.</span>

Of course, a database is only as good as the information entered into it. A blockchain ledger won’t prevent a wholesaler from creating an entry for a counterfeit handbag, or a supplier of exotic skins falsely claiming to have sourced from ethical farms, or a brand’s warehouse manager from mistakenly listing 500 dresses instead of 50. And once in the blockchain, those lies and errors can’t be altered or removed.

LVMH’s use of blockchain to ensure its products’ authenticity partially side-steps that issue. Consumers and secondhand retailers would have little reason to doubt that each Louis Vuitton shoe or bag entered into LVMH’s database is authentic. However, trusting the brand’s third-party suppliers to accurately catalogue raw materials requires a greater leap of faith.

The company may also struggle to bring rivals on board. Though the data collected can’t be altered, LVMH would retain ultimate control over the technology itself, potentially dictating what would be tracked.

LVMH declined to comment.

IBM launched a similar service to track shipping containers with A.P. Møller Maersk, the world's biggest shipping line, as its partner. Other freight movers have been slow to sign on, however.

“Most clients didn’t want to jump on a platform because they felt IBM was going to be the one to dictate where the platform was going to move and what they logged onto the platform,” said Steven Zheng, head of research at The Block, a blockchain news site. “You’re basically removing the main selling point of a blockchain system of it being fully decentralised if you’re a centralised company managing the blockchain system.”

<span>The real disruption is actually not the technology itself, but the decentralisation of the governance.</span>

Vestiaire Collective , an online luxury consignment retailer, came up against this issue when it explored incorporating blockchain. The company decided not to move forward just yet, in part because of the difficulty involved in getting brands to coordinate and share data.

“We need the brands to evolve in order to build synergy in the way they work and expand data sharing,” chief executive Max Bittner said. “More recently we’re seeing that more brands are realising this, which opens up a possibility for the future.”

Paris-based Arianee is working on a digital product certification that would be jointly governed by the brands that sign on. The organisation is still in its infancy, but says it is in talks with big luxury brands and conglomerates. The organisation’s advisory board includes executives from Vacheron Constantin , a Richemont-owned watchmaker, as well as Balenciaga and the brand’s parent, Kering. Arianee’s first pilot projects are expected to roll out this quarter.

“Blockchain is kind of a buzzword, most people use it without exactly knowing what’s behind it,” said Pierre Nicolas Hurstel, chief executive and co-founder of Arianee. “The real disruption that comes with this technology is actually not the technology itself, but the decentralisation of the governance.”

Though some recent uses of blockchain may not pan out, the flurry of experimentation is important, Blockchange’s Seiff said.

“It’s just like in the early days of the internet … you didn’t understand it, and it was growing and transforming the world,” he said. “The act of simply dabbling ... is a stepping stone by which companies can begin to understand the transformative nature of this technology, and not get left behind.”

The deal includes the Belmond debt plus its 46-strong worldwide collection of old luxury hotels, Burmese cruise boats and exotic railway services.

In Peru, the collection includes the Machu Picchu Sanctuary Lodge, Hotel Monasterio and two other hotels in the Cusco area plus Las Casitas in the Colca Canyon and the Miraflores Park hotel in Lima.

Also in the package are the railway companies PeruRail and Ferrocarril Transandino, a duo that has been the Belmond group’s biggest money-maker worldwide, carrying passengers to and from Machu Picchu with revenues of $200mn per year, and providing mineral transport services centered on Arequipa, where one of its clients is the Cerro Verde copper mine, one of the world’s largest.

The LVMH- Belmond agreement was announced in December 2018, with shareholders approving the transaction in February this year. The closing was announced today.

Class A shareholders received $25 per share in cash, according to the LVMH announcement, and Class A common shares will no longer be quoted on the New York stock exchange.

LVMH owns the fashion brands of Louis Vuitton and Christian Dior, as well as several hotels.

LVMH Boss Bernard Arnault Touts Luxury With 'Meaning' - WWD,"Thu, 18 Apr 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3dkLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy1uZXdzL2ZpbmFuY2lhbC9iZXJuYXJkLWFybmF1bHQtdGFsa3MtcmloYW5uYS1rYXJsLWxhZ2VyZmVsZC1wdWNjaS0xMjAzMTEyNDg3L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS — Rihanna, Pucci, Karl Lagerfeld and biodynamic wines were just some of the topics luxury magnate Bernard Arnault broached with shareholders on Thursday at the annual general meeting of his LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton conglomerate, which provided a broad overview of the group’s 70 brands.

Coming just days after LVMH completed its $2.6 billion acquisition of hotel and leisure company Belmond, the meeting underscored the group’s newfound focus on experiences, with Arnault repeatedly emphasizing the importance of broader social and environmental concerns.

“Our values are creativity, quality, entrepreneurship and now I will add another one, which is the search for meaning, which we must analyze, think about and bring to our customers and our partners,” he said.

To that end, shareholders approved the nomination of photographer Yann Arthus-Bertrand as an advisory board member. The founder of the Good Planet foundation was previously associated with rival French luxury group Kering, which supported the release of his 2005 documentary film “Home.”

Share owners also greenlighted the appointment of Sophie Chassat, an expert in corporate philosophy and branding, and Iris Knobloch, president of Warner Bros. France, as new members of the board. Chassat is expected to contribute “her philosophical insight into societal changes,” LVMH stated.

The group has revved up its communications efforts in recent years to counter a perception that it was only interested in racking up profits — namely through its Journées Particulières open-doors event, which drew 180,000 visitors for its fourth edition in October.

Arnault noted LVMH was also addressing supply-chain issues, including tightening requirements for its suppliers of crocodile skins, and exploring the introduction of biodynamic methods in its wine-growing activities, beginning with the Clos des Lambrays vineyard in Burgundy.

In addition, LVMH pledged this week to donate 200 million euros towards rebuilding the fire-ravaged Notre-Dame Cathedral. Arnault refuted accusations that the gift was motivated by the prospect of a hefty tax deduction, saying LVMH and the Arnault family investment firm would not qualify for any tax breaks.

“It’s a baseless controversy. It’s quite deplorable to see that in France today, you get criticized even when you[…]do something in the common interest,” he said, calling on shareholders to share their dismay online if they are satisfied with the group’s donation. “In many other countries, we would be praised instead.”

Nonetheless, Arnault’s business savvy appeared intact as he underlined the success of the Louis Vuitton brand, whose revenues sailed over the 10-billion-euro mark in 2018, by describing its appeal on the resale market.

“When Louis Vuitton products are successful, which is generally the case, it’s like bottles of Romanée-Conti [wine] — in the space of a few hours, or a few days, you find them online at markedly higher prices. That is not the goal, but it goes to show the extraordinary desirability of this brand,” Arnault said.

He revealed that Fendi would stage a couture catwalk show in Rome this summer in homage to its late creative director Karl Lagerfeld, underlining the house’s “great sadness” over Lagerfeld’s death in February, two days before the Italian brand’s fall ready-to-wear show in Milan. Fendi confirmed the Rome show would take place on July 4.

Arnault went on to describe Hedi Slimane’s debut at Celine as a “great success,” touting strong demand for his debut spring rtw collection. “We already have waiting lists in store before the products have even arrived. I just hope we manage to produce enough,” he said.

He also highlighted the success of Fenty Beauty, a partnership between Rihanna and LVMH-controlled Kendo, noting that it will soon expand into skincare. Asked to comment on rumors — first reported by WWD on Jan. 17 — that LVMH and the singer are planning to launch a luxury house under her name, Arnault played coy.

“I appreciate that you’re interested in Rihanna — so am I. She’s an extraordinary singer, but we like surprises, so I have a surprise in store for you. And since it’s a surprise, I won’t say anything more,” he said.

Arnault was slightly more forthcoming about Christian Dior’s planned new store on Avenue des Champs-Elysées, due to open in the summer.

The three-story unit, carrying all product categories, will have a surface of 9,685 square feet and will feature an innovative retail concept that will be tested for the first time, according to a source familiar with the project.

“It’s a temporary store that will be used during renovations on the Avenue Montaigne [flagship], which we will totally renovate. So I hope that by the time this temporary store opens, the yellow-vests problem will be fixed. We hope it will, otherwise we will wait a little,” said Arnault.

LVMH’s caution is justified: protesters belonging to the antigovernment movement were filmed last November looting a recently opened Christian Dior Parfums store on the Champs-Elysées, prompting scores of luxury stores across Paris to stay shut on Saturdays in the run-up to the holiday season in December.

On a separate note, Arnault denied speculation that LVMH is looking to sell Italian label Pucci, which has been without a creative director since the departure of Massimo Giorgetti in 2017. “The company is not for sale,” he said, without elaborating."

NEW YORK, United States — Gabriela Hearst has no filter. ""I don't know if this is too much information but… for Valentine's Day, my mom showed me the place I was conceived,"" Hearst says one day in February, whipping out her phone. On the screen is a verdant riverside patch of Uruguay, the country where the designer was born and raised. ""I was made there.""

Hearst is the kind of person who really cares about where and how things are made. She goes on to explain the details — there was an overnight fishing trip — and why this revelation, no matter how funny or awkward on her mother’s part, was so meaningful to her. “I do really think that this is my soul,” she says, going on to suggest that her journey from Uruguay to New York has followed the Buddhist concept of dharma — or cosmic law and order — and that every step of the way allowed her to “crystallise the vision” of her namesake womenswear label more precisely.

From Buddhism to fashion. It’s a stretch. But, then again, her mother is a practising Buddhist and Hearst says she uses daily meditation for support as she builds her label. “The pressure that designers feel is a bit similar to the pressure of an athlete. It’s kind of a self-imposed torture; a competition with others but also a competition with yourself,” she says. “And when you’re a mother of three children it’s not like I can be downing wine bottles. So, I have to find alternative ways of not going completely freaking nuts.”

In an industry built on smoke and mirrors, Hearst's honesty is refreshing. Especially given the pressure she must be feeling. On a Monday in mid-January, the trajectory of Hearst's business changed forever. Around 8am New York time, a press release announced that LVMH — the French luxury conglomerate that owns more than 70 brands, including Louis Vuitton and Dior — was making a small, but significant, minority investment in the label through its LVMH Luxury Ventures arm.

The fund, which bets on “young luxury” companies, has also invested in French apothecary Officine Universelle Buly and sneaker reseller Stadium Goods, which has since been sold to Farfetch at a $250 million valuation. But LVMH’s interest in Hearst’s label was perhaps most significant not because of the sums involved — the company declined to reveal how much it had invested in the label, but the typical deal size at its Luxury Ventures arm is between €2 million and €15 million — but because of the founder herself.

Yes, Gabriela Hearst is the wife of Austin Hearst, the publishing heir, whom she married in 2013. But more importantly, she has developed her label — known for its feminine suiting, elegant knits and thoughtful handbags — in New York at a time when the very concept of “American luxury” can feel like an oxymoron, with many leading players prioritising quarterly results over quality.

Julie Bercovy, the executive who runs LVMH Luxury Ventures, said via email that the fund was interested in Hearst, whom she called a ""highly creative woman,"" because of her ""clear mission of creating luxurious, modern collections, while staying true to her values and pushing forward the causes she champions... she is involved in every aspect of the business, from driving sustainability through the supply chain to product mix, distribution and more.""

Meanwhile, the same morning the LVMH investment was announced, Meghan Markle, the American actress, turned British royal, turned money-making machine for fashion brands, was once again spotted carrying Hearst’s “Nina” bag, an origami leather ball folded up like a Kouign-amann pastry.

The most important lesson for me is nothing in this world happens without hard work, absolutely nothing

And while the queries came rolling in, Hearst did not sit for interviews or celebrate with a champagne lunch. Instead, she spent the day recycling hangers. “I was in our storage room, all day, organising,” she says with a certain breathless urgency, walking up to the Astro Gallery of Gems on Lower Fifth Avenue on an eerily warm winter afternoon. Hearst is apparently not the kind of person who can let herself enjoy unseasonably high temperatures induced by fearsome climate change, or the prestige that an injection of capital from the likes of LVMH can bring to a fledgling business like hers.

Hearst is serious and sincere about playing the long game. “The most important lesson for me is nothing in this world happens without hard work, absolutely nothing,” she said. “Take the humiliations, take the falls, take the snubbing, and know that, if you believe in it completely, one day it will happen. But when it happens, just continue on the same path, don’t get fooled by the glitter. Because at the end of the day it’s a job. I’m a worker.”

She founded her namesake label two years after her marriage, with significant seed investment from her husband, while phasing out Candela, a mid-market line that she started with two partners and just $700 in 2004, long before Austin was in the picture. (Candela still operates as a private-labelbusiness, but she is not involved.) She had moved to New York in 2000, and two years later began assisting the designer Kara Janx. When she launched Candela, she was running sales at a showroom, so she knew what buyers wanted.

But she also knew it was over for Candela the day Zara opened its doors in the retail space in her office building. ""I was like, 'This is impossible, I will never ever be able to compete with this,'"" she said, snapping a sesame-crusted breadstick in half during lunch at Sant Ambroeus in the West Village. For trend-driven contemporary brands like Candela, getting customers to pay more than fast-fashion prices for average quality was increasingly difficult. ""There was a point when I thought, 'How much more can I lower the quality?' My heart was breaking.""

In 2011, just as the bottom was falling out of the contemporary market, Hearst's father, a self-made Uruguayan rancher, passed away. She inherited one of his properties and, as Hearst put it, her ""worlds collided."" She knew that if she was going to keep doing fashion, she wanted to build something sustainable: something that could last. There was less price sensitivity in luxury goods, especially if their distribution was managed carefully. She knew that they could be made in a more responsible way, too. So, she called Julie Gilhart, a fashion consultant who has developed a reputation for working with brands to reduce their environmental footprints.

Hearst made this as a pillar of the house she would build. She would waste nothing. Every bit of fabric would be used, every hang-tag considered. She developed a fondness for recycled cashmere, believing her customer would be happy to wear leftovers as long as they were good. She obsessed over biodegradable materials. This, despite a lack of evidence that sustainability credentials drive sales.

My favourite thing about luxury is also the hardest thing about luxury

“People tell me, ‘Oh you shouldn’t talk so much about sustainability.’ But for me, personally, there’s no other pressing thing happening in the world,” she said, mentioning a February 2019 article in The Guardian detailing how the mass extinction of insects could result in the “collapse of nature.”

“I can’t justify what I do without having that as a core value,” she said.

Gabriela Hearst, the designer’s name by the time she started the line, would be about using the best materials, working with the best factories and creating a sense of specialness — especially around the bags — so that the business could sustain, in the truest sense of the word, for longer than a decade.

""My favourite thing about luxury is also the hardest thing about luxury,"" she said. ""In the contemporary market you design something and you send it to the factory. In luxury, every single trim is your decision. I am hands-on every single step of that garment. What are the buttons that we're choosing? What's the lining that we're choosing? How are we interlining the pockets? I'm much more of the philosophy — because of how I grew up in Uruguay, of having less but making it good.""

In just two years, the company crossed over into profitability. And three years in, 2018 revenues were just under $20 million, according to sources familiar with the company’s finances. Hearst said she could have grown more quickly, but she feared becoming too reliant on sales of handbags, which already make up 50 percent of the business. Currently, half of the revenue comes from direct-to-consumer sales — although that number is set to increase in 2019 — and half is made outside of the US, indicating that, with physical retail and further expansion into product categories beyond bags and ready-to-wear, including fine jewellery and home, there is still opportunity to grow.

“I tell my team all the time, we do not have to bullshit. These are my values. This is where I come from. This is what we’re doing,” she says. “There are materials where we cannot even do a price comparison. My head of sales comes to me to do a price comparison for a pleated dress that’s made of cashmere gauze; there’s nothing in the market where they’re doing a pleated dress of cashmere. Maybe there’s cotton, maybe there’s viscose but not a cashmere gauze. That type of thing makes it very special. That’s our level of differentiation.”

It also helps that her last name is recognised the world over. When the designer was establishing the company, she thought about using her maiden name, Perezutti, instead. But Hearst isn’t one to pretend that her privilege doesn’t exist — or to be embarrassed of it.

“When we were thinking of launching the brand and calling it Perezutti, my maiden name, I had a good friend who said to me, ‘I love you, and I love your maiden name, but come on. Nobody can pronounce it and they’re going to write it wrong,’” she says. “Gabriela Hearst was the most honest approach. I’m Gabriela, he’s the Hearst. He’s the investor. To honour the work that his family has done for all of these years, you can’t do something shitty.”

You can have the investment, but you have to deliver.

Austin, a television and film producer who has lately taken an interest in ventures that deal in the business of mindfulness, remains her primary investor. But this wasn't a free-for-all. ""I had a very set budget and the resources were limited,"" she says. ""This was a risk. If it didn't work on the first season, bye-bye my second chance."" But she also acknowledges that, for example, she could afford to hire an art director she respected, Peter Miles, to create a brand image that was in line with her vision.

“It’s a bit like Formula One driving or tennis,” she says. “You can have the investment, but you have to deliver. I am very grateful and very lucky, and I take even more responsibility because of it. I constantly have to prove myself.”

While Hearst’s privilege created an advantage, it certainly didn’t guarantee anything. Plenty of wealthy people start fashion lines resulting in nothing much. Hearst has earned respect by making clothes that sell. Her take on the suit — slim, but not too skinny, rendered in soft makeup shades of silk shantung or double-faced cashmere — hit just the right spot between corporate and costume, becoming a fashion editor favourite. “The first season, our sales rep at the showroom that we had at the time said, ‘Don’t bother doing suits,’” Hearst remembers. “Thank god I’m old enough now and I don’t listen to people.”

“The sensibility of the clothes is unique,” says Tiffany Hsu, fashion buying director at MyTheresa, the multi-brand luxury e-tailer owned by Neiman Marcus Group, who also served on the judging panel when Hearst won the International Woolmark Prize in 2017. “I’m seeing more and more customers who are happy to invest in a piece that feels more adult. It doesn’t matter what season it’s from if it’s beautiful.”

In 2018, Hearst hired her first chief executive, Giuseppe Giovannetti, whose time at Bottega Veneta and Tomas Maier made him a good fit to assist in developing a quiet luxury label. But she remains involved in every aspect of the business. ""It's been a goal of mine for over two decades to really develop myself creatively, executively and administratively,"" she said. ""I find that my brain needs all of these areas to work efficiently. I don't want it to work in silos, I want everything to talk to each other.""

Her first bricks-and-mortar store, which she opened in November 2018 adjacent to the Carlyle Hotel, was the beginning of what she hopes will be an extensive store network — starting with openings in London and Hong Kong in 2019 — where she can sell her entire collection, including handbags, which aren’t really sold at wholesale. (Bergdorf Goodman, where she recently opened a shop-in-shop, carries one exclusive style, for a limited time only.)

Hearst said that she decided to partner with LVMH because of the company’s deep expertise in every aspect of the business she is working to build. “It’s the knowledge,” she says. There is a lot of information that I lack and that I need to understand. I’m very clear on the vision and I’m very clear on the value system that we have, I just need to understand how to execute this thing.”

But Hearst is taking things slowly. She is quite vocal about her social and environmental consciousness, and yet her business model is remarkably traditional — a far cry from that of Bono and Alison Hewson’s label Edun, which was founded with the ethically minded mission of bringing attention, and work, to artisans and manufacturers in Africa, and attracted investment from LVMH before shuttering last year.

“Luxury, it needs time. You can’t build luxury really quickly, you just can’t. Even at the volume that we are, it’s still very constrained because we just do not have capacity,” she says. “I cannot just rush and hire a bunch of people. It’s already fast enough for me. I’m already like, borderline, ‘This is crazy.’ Any faster than this is nuts.”

Disclosure: LVMH is part of a group of investors who, together, hold a minority interest in The Business of Fashion. All investors have signed shareholders’ documentation guaranteeing BoF’s complete editorial independence.

LVMH acquires luxury hotel group and travel operator Belmond - Options The Edge,"Fri, 26 Apr 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm9wdGlvbnN0aGVlZGdlLmNvbS90b3BpYy90cmF2ZWwvbHZtaC1hY3F1aXJlcy1sdXh1cnktaG90ZWwtZ3JvdXAtYW5kLXRyYXZlbC1vcGVyYXRvci1iZWxtb25k0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"News of luxury hotel group and travel operator Belmond's acquisition by LVMH caused rejoicing among the well-heeled travel community recently. For those who have experienced Belmond's signature hospitality, it's a certainty that it can only flourish further under the LVMH umbrella. Although it operates in 24 countries, it's perhaps Peru where the Belmond magic truly comes alive. Boasting the most comprehensive network of luxury hotels and lodges in the South American country, guests can expect a seamless journey, from Lima to Cusco and through the Colca Canyon or perhaps even all the way to Lake Titicaca.





It's imperative that journeys begin at the Belmond Miraflores Park in Lima — primarily to decompress after the endless hours of flying across the globe and partly to enjoy the feeling of being as far from home as you could possibly be. After a good night's rest, wake up refreshed for desayuno, or 'breakfast' in Spanish, which is best enjoyed with sweeping views of Pacific Ocean's vastness. And Belmond's spread demands languorous nibbling, be it on western-style favourites or local treats like hot tamales and the sweetest little plums, just slightly bigger than one's thumbnail.

In the afternoon, catch your flight to Cusco, where your Andean adventure can truly begin. All of Lima's Spanish style melts away in the high altitudes of Los Andes and here, Belmond's two properties are unique, each offering a different experience of life in the city of the Incas. The Palacio Nazarenas is more modern and hacienda-like while the iconic Monasterio, a former monastery that is built upon the remains of ancient Inca walls itself. Our personal preference is for the former, as its modernity allows for the most necessary of amenities — pumped-in oxygen in the rooms. A boon in Cusco where the air is thin.

The best way to travel to the lost city rediscovered by Hiram Bingham is, naturally, on the luxury Belmond-operated train named in his honour

Meals in all of Belmond's Peruvian properties are an epicurean wonder, from mountain corn in a multitude of colours as well as more esoteric eats like guinea pig confit and alpaca fillets, all to be washed down with sips of Cusquena beer (the most popular local brew) or perhaps the brightly-coloured Inca Kola. Here, pass your days exploring a variety of sights, from the ruins of Pisaq and Ollantaytambo to, of course, the magic that is Machu Picchu.

The best way to travel to the lost city rediscovered by Hiram Bingham is, naturally, on the luxury Belmond-operated train named in his honour. From Cusco, it's a pleasant morning's trundle to Aguas Calientes, where you board a bus to finally arrive at the gates of the citadel. If you're fortunate enough to have scored a room at the Belmond Sanctuary Lodge, right outside Machu Picchu's gates, then you may enjoy the rare privilege of early exploring opportunities to Waynapicchu or perhaps Puente Inka, followed by a soothing massage in the hotel spa.

Inside the Pullman-style carriages of Hiram Bingham, you’ll be whisked into the glamour of a bygone world with fine fabrics and antique fittings

The stories that surround this country are mystical and endless, whether it's the modern buzz felt in downtown Lima and its wealth of world-class restaurants or in the thin air of Cusco and its unmissable sights. Whatever you discover or wherever you may journey to in this ancient land, amplify the power of Peru's spell with a little help from Belmond. Pachamama herself would approve.

Attorney sues French luxury brands company for sexual harassment and retaliation - ABA Journal,"Thu, 25 Apr 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFiYWpvdXJuYWwuY29tL25ld3MvYXJ0aWNsZS9hdHRvcm5leS1zdWVzLWZyZW5jaC1sdXh1cnktYnJhbmRzLWNvbXBhbnktb3Zlci1zZXh1YWwtaGFyYXNzbWVudC1hbmQtcmV0YWxpYXRpb27SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Home Daily News Attorney sues French luxury brands company…

Attorney sues French luxury brands company for sexual harassment and retaliation

A senior in-house attorney in the New York office of LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton sued the company Tuesday for sexual harassment and retaliation.

In her complaint, Andowah Newton, vice president of legal affairs and litigation counsel at LVMH, claims that she was sexually harassed by a male colleague who made suggestive comments, leered at her, tried to kiss her and, on one occasion, had lunged his body across hers, “thrusting his pelvis and genitals into her face,” while reaching for the phone in her office. The New York Law Journal and Reuters have coverage.

Newton, who has an accounting background, spent eight years in BigLaw. She was an associate at Hogan & Hartson, as well as Mintz, Levin, Cohn, Ferris, Glovsky and Popeo in New York before joining LVMH in 2015. LVMH is a French multinational, luxury goods conglomerate that owns the brands Dior, Fendi and Givenchy.

According to her complaint, filed in state court in New York City, Newton says she informally reported her male colleague’s behavior to LVMH personnel, including in-house employment counsel, who told her “he could not report the conduct further within LVMH because he worked for the legal department.”

The employment counsel suggested that Newton tell her male colleague via email to leave her alone in May 2018, the complaint says. She forwarded that email to the employment counsel, who then called her, enraged, because he had to make an official report about the behavior.

LVMH’s senior director of talent development met with Newton to discuss the email, the complaint says. After speaking with the employment counsel, general counsel and Newton’s male colleague, the senior director closed the inquiry.

“The director of talent described the harasser’s behavior as ‘mere flirting’ and told Ms. Newton that the incident in which he had attempted to kiss Ms. Newton was ‘what executives do in a French company,’ suggesting that Ms. Newton was unfamiliar with French culture and should simply tolerate the behavior,” according to the complaint. The senior director reprimanded Newton for her email and suggested that she apologize to her male colleague, the complaint says.

Newton filed a formal complaint with LVMH’s senior vice president of human resources, describing her male colleague’s behavior and the response of the legal counsel and talent director. The general counsel questioned why she filed the report but then asked whether she would “let things go” if an external investigator found no evidence of sexual harassment, the complaint says.

The third party’s investigation “turned out to be little more than a mediation aimed at persuading Ms. Newton to stop pursuing her claims,” the complaint says. In June 2018, during that investigation, Newton says she began to experience retaliation by the general counsel, who singled her out and suddenly treated her differently than other employees.

“Notwithstanding her previous glowing reviews of Ms. Newton, the general counsel has begun to chip away at Ms. Newton’s autonomy in the office and is actively trying to take control of Ms. Newton’s cases,” according to the complaint. “The general counsel has also made comments that she is ‘watching’ or ‘keeping an eye on’ Ms. Newton despite Ms. Newton’s years of working independently with positive results.”

LVMH said in a statement Tuesday that Newton’s allegations had “no merit whatsoever,” according to the New York Law Journal. The company said neither the internal investigation nor the external investigation found evidence to support her claims."
Exec sues LVMH over harassment characterized as 'French culture' - New York Post,"Tue, 23 Apr 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vbnlwb3N0LmNvbS8yMDE5LzA0LzIzL2V4ZWMtc3Vlcy1taGx2LW92ZXItaGFyYXNzbWVudC1jaGFyYWN0ZXJpemVkLWFzLWZyZW5jaC1jdWx0dXJlL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"An executive at Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton Inc. says she was harassed there for years by an ooh la louse — but higher-ups just chalked it up to French culture.

Plaintiff Andowah Newton, who worked out of the luxury goods brand’s New York office, says in a Manhattan Supreme Court lawsuit filed Tuesday that the firm convinced her “that the harassment was just a byproduct of being an attractive woman who works at a company with a French culture.”

She said company bigs asserted this despite the fact that “none of the individual actors in this matter is, in fact, French,” her suit says.

Newton claims her harasser — a “senior level management employee” whom she doesn’t name — frequently ogled her and once said, “You are so pretty. And that beautiful smile, I just can’t get enough of it,” according to court papers.

Another time, while talking with her in her office, he “lunged” across her desk to use her phone, “thrusting his pelvis and genitals into her face and pressing his body firmly against hers as he reached across her body for her phone,” the suit says.

Newton — who worked at the company for 16 years, eventually rising to vice president of Legal Affairs & Litigation Counsel — says she confronted the man in an email.

The company conducted a “sham” investigation, seeming more concerned with keeping its brand image safe than addressing the harassment, the court documents allege.

At one point, another company employee called the man’s behavior “mere flirting,” a “misunderstanding” or “miscommunication,” the papers state.

Company officials said an attempt by him to kiss her on the cheek as a greeting was “what executives do in a French company, suggesting that Ms. Newton was unfamiliar with French culture and should simply tolerate the behavior,” reads her the lawsuit.

But the suggestion that Newton doesn’t know French culture is “laughable” — since she worked and studied there for several years, the court documents say.

The company retaliated against Newton by promoting the man and suddenly giving her bogus bad work reviews, the court papers claim.

Newton’s lawyer, Carolynn Beck, said in a statement, “LVMH should be ashamed of itself for prioritizing its image above the safety of its employees.

“For years, my client, an exemplary, hardworking employee of LVMH, suffered unwanted sexual harassment and touching from another LVMH employee.”

Newton, who still works for the firm, is suing for unspecified damages and “hopes to promote change to the culture,” Beck said.

A rep with LVMH said the lawsuit has “no merit” and said when Newton raised the issue, the company “immediately conducted an internal investigation, as well as engaged a neutral, third party to conduct an external investigation” into the allegations.

“Neither of these investigations found any evidence to support Ms. Newton’s claims.”

The spokesperson also claimed the alleged harasser was just a staffer, not a senior-level employee."
French Titans' Pledges to Notre-Dame Pass €850 Million (Published 2019) - The New York Times,"Tue, 16 Apr 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMTkvMDQvMTYvZmFzaGlvbi9Eb25hdGlvbnMtbm90cmUtZGFtZS1maXJlLmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"In the aftermath of the fire at Notre-Dame, one of the great symbols of France, the luxury industry — another symbol of the country, thanks to names such as Dior, Louis Vuitton and Saint Laurent — has pledged hundreds of millions of euros to the cathedral’s restoration.

The donations were followed on Tuesday by other pledges that soon surpassed 850 million euros, or about $960 million, and included beauty, energy, technology and finance companies as well as private individuals.

On Monday, as Notre-Dame burned and flames lit the sky, the Pinault family — owners of Kering, the second-largest luxury group in France — was the first to publicly offer a significant contribution, pledging to donate €100 million to the rebuilding effort.

[Black churches destroyed by arson saw a surge in donations after the Notre-Dame fire.]

“The Notre-Dame tragedy strikes all French people, as well as all those with spiritual values,” said François-Henri Pinault, chairman of Artémis, the family holding company that controls Kering."
Hong Kong and Macau buoy DFS sales in first quarter as LVMH delivers double-digit revenue increase - The Moodie Davitt Report,"Wed, 10 Apr 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiggFodHRwczovL21vb2RpZWRhdml0dHJlcG9ydC5jb20vaG9uZy1rb25nLWFuZC1tYWNhdS1idW95LWRmcy1zYWxlcy1pbi1maXJzdC1xdWFydGVyLWFzLWx2bWgtZGVsaXZlcnMtZG91YmxlLWRpZ2l0LXJldmVudWUtaW5jcmVhc2Uv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"FRANCE/INTERNATIONAL. DFS Group sales grew “at a steady pace” in the first quarter, according to majority owner LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, which today declared a strong set of revenues for the period.

The Selective Retailing division, of which DFS is part, posted revenue growth of 13% (8% in organic terms) in the quarter to €3.5 billion. Of the DFS performance, LVMH said in a statement: “The Gallerias of Hong Kong and Macau performed particularly well. Momentum remained very strong at the Fondaco dei Tedeschi in Venice, the first European site for DFS. Its expansion in Europe will continue in 2020 with an opening in La Samaritaine in Paris.”

Overall, LVMH recorded revenue of €12.5 billion for the period, an increase of 16%. Organic growth was 11% compared to the same period in 2018. All geographic regions showed good growth, said the company.

The Wines & Spirits business group recorded 13% sales growth (9% organic) in the quarter. Champagne volumes were stable while prestige cuvées performed particularly well, notably in the USA and Japan. The business group also benefited from a firm pricing policy. Hennessy Cognac volumes increased by 11%, with the US and Chinese markets growing fast.

The Fashion & Leather Goods business group achieved the highest revenue growth by division of 20% (15% organic) in the period. Louis Vuitton turned in an “exceptional” performance, said LVMH.

The company noted: “The transformational upgrade of its distribution network continued with highly successful re-openings, including Florence, London’s Sloane Street, Monaco and Shanghai IFC. To meet growing demand and to limit stock shortages, a new leather workshop was opened in France on a site that will be able to accommodate 500 employees, and several other projects are underway.”

Christian Dior Couture performed “exceptionally” across all its product categories and regions. At Celine, the new ready-to-wear collections arrived in stores as a new concept is rolled out. Fendi, Loewe and Berluti are growing fast while Loro Piana’s vicuna and shoe collections performed well, added the group.

In Perfumes & Cosmetics, organic revenue increased 9% (reported 12%) in the period. Parfums Christian Dior had a strong quarter, benefiting from the recent launch of its new fragrance Joy. In makeup, the Rouge Dior and Diorskin lines did well. Guerlain experienced strong growth momentum, notably as a result of the sustained growth of Abeille Royale skincare and Rouge G lipstick. Parfums Givenchy performed well, while Fenty Beauty by Rihanna continued to grow rapidly.

The Watches & Jewelry business group recorded revenue growth of 9% (4% organic) in the first quarter. Bvlgari made strong progress in its own stores, driven by its lines Serpenti, Divas’Dream, Lvcea and its new Fiorever collection. Chaumet unveiled its new Liens Evidence creations in gold and diamonds."

They lost their wealthiest American clients due to the Wall Street Crash in 1929. All those tragic events, combined with the ready-to-wear revolution, led to the disappearance of many famous names such as House of Worth, Paul Poiret, Jean Patou, Madeleine Vionnet, Molyneux, Schiaparelli, Rochas, Doucet and Nina Ricci.

Ailing, once glamorous fashion houses that require an injection of cash from a wealthy entrepreneur to save them from bankruptcy and oblivion are often referred to as “sleeping beauty” brands.

The late Karl Lagerfeld provided the best example of how to revive one of fashion’s “sleeping beauties” when he saved Chanel from oblivion in 1983 and turned it into a legendary luxury brand with revenues of US9.62 billion for 2017.

Lagerfeld, who led the brand for 36 years, recalled, “Everybody said, ‘Don’t touch it, it’s dead, it will never come back.’ But I thought it was a challenge. Thirty-five years ago, old labels were old labels. Now everybody wants to revive a label.”

In September 2018, the LVMH group announced plans to relaunch the couture house Jean Patou, Chanel’s biggest rival after the first world war. Founded in the 1910s, Jean Patou was once a household name in fashion, popular for his chic silhouettes with comfortable style. The French couturier was also considered the godfather of sportswear. In 1921, French tennis diva Suzanne Lenglen caused a stir by wearing Jean Patou’s daring outfit at Wimbledon. Showing a brilliant business sense, Jean Patou also applied his own “JP” monogram to his sportswear designs that would become the first visible designer label in the world.

In 1929, the Frenchman also launched the perfume “Joy”, regarded as one of the greatest perfumes ever created and a landmark example of the floral genre in perfumery. Despite its expensive price and the depressed economic environment, it became a hit and was voted “Scent of the Century” by the public at the Fragrance Foundation FiFi Awards in 2000, beating its rival, Chanel No. 5. The house was closed in 1987.

In relaunching the brand, LVMH appointed Guillaume Henry as the creative director.

Investing in a young fashion designer is sometimes a high-risk, high-reward endeavor. In a fragile fashion landscape, are luxury groups shifting their investment strategies to heritage names?

“With a dormant fashion house, you have an inexhaustible reserve of storytelling to match, yet it comes with no liability, negative connotation or skeletons in the cupboard. There is no restructuring to be done and you can position the brand however you wish in terms of creativity, price points, and distribution channels. It is basically ‘carte blanche’ to devise a modern business model that comes with the benefits of aura and heritage”, says Pierre Mallevays, managing partner of Savigny Partners LLP, who is dubbed the “Grand Wizard” of M&A in the fashion and luxury industry.

Anglo-American couturier Charles James was acknowledged as the best dressmaker in the world by Cristóbal Balenciaga. Christian Dior called him the “greatest talent of my generation”. James’ greatest achievements included “The Swan”, a puffer jacket made in 1938, which was described by artist Salvador Dalí as “the first soft sculpture”.

In 2014, the now-disgraced movie tycoon Harvey Weinstein announced that The Weinstein Company would relaunch the iconic house. However, Weinstein’s revival plans were halted by Luvanis, a Luxembourg-based investment company that owned trademark rights in various jurisdictions. At the end of 2018, the investment company discreetly put Charles James up for sale.

Arnaud de Lummen, managing director of Luvanis, tells us, “Charles James is not only a household name in museums and fashion history books – it is a wonderful vehicle to create an old-new luxury brand, a fresh name carrying heritage. It offers a canvas for a quintessential luxury brand with the opportunity to build on the Swan jacket to create an alternative to Moncler or to rely on James’ rebellious punk attitude to bridge with streetwear.”

In 2011, Weinstein failed to revive the famous American fashion designer Halston’s brand.

Creativity is a key element in building brand equity. Regardless of the prestige of the name, investment requires knowledge of the fashion industry, which is difficult for a single entrepreneur – even one with deep pockets.

But, it is a straightforward exercise for international fashion groups.

In 2015, South Korean fashion group Shinsegae acquired one of the most important haute couture houses, Paul Poiret. In 2018, Chung Yoo-kyung, CEO of Shinsegae, appointed Belgian businesswoman Anne Chapelle as CEO of Paul Poiret. Chapelle was behind the rise of Ann Demeulemeester and Haider Ackermann.

After a 90-year hiatus, Chinese couturiere Yiqing Yin unveiled the new vision of Poiret in March 2018. Thanks to its heritage, Poiret successfully secured a good spot during the busy fashion week. Both collections of Poiret were warmly received by the international press. Last December, Poiret announced the departure of the Beijing-born Yin after just two seasons.

“Brands with an authentic heritage are important assets. The challenge is to revive them and make them relevant to today’s consumers,” says Luca Solca, managing director, Luxury Goods at Sanford C. Bernstein Schweiz.

The fashion industry is sometimes based on a dichotomy. A brand has to create sustainable value for the long term while taking creativity and cultural factors – which fluctuate every season – into account.

Chinese conglomerate Shandong Ruyi, acquired 51 percent of the Hong Kong company Trinity Ltd, which operates menswear brands Gieves & Hawkes, Cerruti 1881, Kent & Curwen and D’Urban, in 2017.

Over the years, the 200-year-old British tailoring house Gieves & Hawkes has evolved into a global menswear brand. In 2018, sales were boosted by Chinese shoppers in London during Golden Week. The Chinese market will account for half of the luxury sales by 2025, according to a new study by Bain & Company.

Chinese companies are aggressively acquiring European independent houses, boosting economic growth globally. Glamorous exhibitions of old fashion brands are on show in the world’s biggest museums. For wealthy private investors, injecting funds into a fashion house is like revamping a living masterpiece which might one day make a great return. Major luxury groups that acquire a fashion brand can estimate the risk of the investment, and they minimize the risk by strategically appointing a young, talented designer at the creative helm.

A successful renaissance of a label quite often calls for management knowledge, a unique business strategy, creativity, and cultural momentum.

“It requires vision and special abilities, including an uncommon sense for style. Independent entrepreneurs, conglomerates and Chinese groups could all fit the bill,” Solca says.

“Yet, fashion conglomerates have additional [leverage] such as established distribution networks, media buying, and media management skills, retail and consumer insight.”

Discover our favourites for the LVMH 2019 award - HIGHXTAR,"Wed, 24 Apr 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vaGlnaHh0YXIuY29tL2VuL21lZXQtb3VyLXRvcC1maW5hbGlzdHMtZm9yLXRoZS1sdm1oLTIwMTktcHJpemUv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"In an era in which emerging design is setting the parameters of a new paradigm in the fashion industry, through ideas in the showcase such as: sustainability, fur free, global consciousness, slow fashion, non-gender garments… new creative minds are arriving that inject the whole universe into this reality of social anxiety that we see through the screen.

Now, just a few weeks before the 2019 edition of the LVMH awards -which reward young talent- we put the radar on its eight finalists and select our favorites to present their profiles. Check this out.

KENNETH IZE

Kenneth Ize presents the freshest side of African fashion by reinterpreting examples of Nigerian craftsmanship through a very careful technique based on luxury. The firm, founded in 2013 in Nigeria, fuses manual -handmade- and local tradition with a contemporary aesthetic that enhances the growing artistic scene that is being configured in Lagos, his hometown.

Thus Kenneth experiments with fabrics and deconstruction, as well as with past-present-future to introduce vibrant color suits, fringes and multiple prints in the same creative line into the scene. It gives rise to pieces that Childish Gambino or Naomi Campbell have worn; those same pieces that have already crossed all borders, with a showroom in Paris for SS19 and distributors in Vienna, Switzerland and Nigeria.

The designer, after a long process of developing his own textiles, reinterprets through the weaver the classic tailor suit to give it a neo-African sense, with a very powerful cultural and ethical aesthetics through a sustainable approach in the process of design and production, obtaining local materials and promoting craftsmanship.

HED MAYNER

The Israeli creative director -aficando in Paris- focuses his design focus on men’s fashion, and is inspired by his origins in the Middle East. His highlight is ancient Jewish/orthodox tailoring bathed in urban and/or contemporary codes that connect with the ideas of vulnerability, spirituality, tradition and power with which he has grown up.

In this way, Mayner gives way to sacred collections that balance fluid and structured pieces in the same concept, which in turn represent the strength and weakness that we all possess. Here we find a range of oversized silk suits, draped t-shirts, reconstructed classic trenches, military-inspired garments and infinite shoulder pads added to the pieces that move, above all, under desert and/or neutral tones.

This entire imaginary is steeped in an elegant wardrobe built through natural fibers, which emphasizes comfort, self-expression and body language.

BETHANY WILLIAMS

Britain’s Bethany Williams vibrates with sustainability and social consciousness, and transports it to all those collections that have a message to say. It provides an alternative system based on eco-garments made in the UK from recycled materials, and aims to generate positive change through fashion.

Her brand focuses on streetwear and workwear codes, through illustrated garments, superimposition of infinite materials, abstraction, crochet, patchwork and very Mondrian colours. Williams has launched collections such as ‘Women for Change’ with which worked with women prisoners and with a drug addiction programme, or the ‘Breadline’ capsule in which helps find solutions to hidden hunger in the UK, in collaboration with Vauxhall Food Bank and Tesco.

In ‘Breadline’ we can find pieces such as cardboard woven jackets, the Tesco logo printed on tracksuits or embroidered on cowboy fabrics, which reflect the true meaning of the new man of 2019 who loves the planet. Thus, the designer has already won awards such as the ‘Queen Elizabeth The Second Award for Design’ for her ethical vision in the fashion industry. Because Bethany Williams isn’t just clothes, it’s conscience and future. And who are you staying with?"
Bernard Arnault Talks Rihanna Venture During Louis Vuitton Shareholder Meeting - The Root,"Sun, 21 Apr 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXJvb3QuY29tL2Jlcm5hcmQtYXJuYXVsdC1tYXktb3ItbWF5LW5vdC1oYXZlLWNvbmZpcm1lZC1zZWNyZXQtcmktMTgzNDE5NzcwNNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The Walking Dead & Other TV Shows Released in 2024 You Should Catch Up On CC Share Subtitles Off

Bernard Arnault, chairman and chief executive of Louis Vuitton Moët Hennessy (LVMH), loves Rihanna as much as the rest of us. He loves her ability to bring in boatloads of money even more.

As reported by Business of Fashion:

During his presentation to more than 2,000 shareholders, the executive underscored the company’s continued commitment to creating a desirable product that offers consumers “meaning” and “a reason to buy.” In 2018, the company posted record results, generating global sales of €46 billion euros, with Rihanna’s Fenty Beauty line generating nearly €500 million in revenue and Louis Vuitton posting more than €10 billion.

Still, Arnault wants to keep us in suspense regarding the upcoming launch of Rihanna’s standalone apparel brand, Project Loud France. The rumor is that LVMH has a 51 percent stake.

“I appreciate your interest in Rihanna. I am [interested] too, she’s an extraordinary singer,” he said. “But we like surprises….As it’s a surprise, I will not tell you more.”

Admitting a “surprise” is a confirmation, right?

Back in January, WWD reported that social media was buzzing over the possibility of a Fenty apparel or accessories line when paparazzi spotted Rih wearing sunglasses with the Fenty name splayed along the sides.

LVMH’s rumored new venture with Rihanna seems more likely than ever, but regardless, Rihanna is continuing her reign with stunning May covers for Vogue Australia, and Harper’s Bazaar US.

"The World's Most Well-Known Watchmakers Have a New Rival, a Jeweler Claiming Exclusive Rights in ""Red Gold"" - The Fashion Law","Thu, 11 Apr 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWZhc2hpb25sYXcuY29tL2x1eHVyeS13YXRjaC1jb21wYW5pZXMtaGF2ZS1hLW5ldy1yaXZhbC1hLWpld2VsZXItY2xhaW1pbmctZXhjbHVzaXZlLXJpZ2h0cy1pbi1yZWQtZ29sZC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Luxury watchmakers have long wrestled with one very prominent set of opponents – counterfeiters, the often-Chinese entities that actively saturate the market with “Rolex” watches with hands that tick instead of glide, lighter-than-usual “Audemars Piguets,” and improperly engraved “Patek Philippes.” Over the past decade or so, an assertive new foe has arisen: a jeweler to the stars claiming exclusive rights in the words “red gold,” and waging an increasingly aggressive war against nearly every major watchmaker – from Cartier and Piaget to Breitling and Rolex – in the process.

When jeweler Chris Aire opened the doors of his eponymous jewelry company 23 years ago in Beverly Hills, rose gold was far less popular than it is today. “You couldn’t give rose gold away before we started branding it,” he told Bloomberg years later. The branding that Aire is referring to included calling the pink-hued gold-copper alloy “Red Gold,” which he says is a more masculine way to describe it.

In the fall of 2003, on the heels of Aire and his intellectual property holding company Solid 21 Inc. filing to register the “Red Gold” name as a trademark for use on watches and jewelry with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, they were issued a registration.

While Aire has built up a client list that has included Jamie Foxx, Angelina Jolie, Eva Longoria, Halle Berry, Jay Z, and Clint Eastwood, the brand really started making headlines in 2010 when Solid 21 filed suit in a California federal court against Rolex, LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, Richemont, and Omega, among more than a dozen other companies. According to the complaint, nearly 20 different watch brands were using the words “Red Gold” in connection with their products without its authorization.

That suit – which was eventually split into a number of different cases – kicked off a lengthy and ever-growing chain of multi-million dollar trademark infringement cases that have dotted court dockets across the U.S., in which Solid 21 asserts that it has the exclusive right to use the “Red Gold” trademark. Solid 21 filed dozens of lawsuits between November 2010 and December 2013, alone, against the likes of Bulgari, Ulysee Nardin, Chopard, Pierre Kunz, and Franck Muller, among others. Even more would follow.

Of the many cases filed, one landed Hublot owner LVMH on the receiving end. With a fierce team of both in-house and outside counsel, LVMH sought to establish that the “Red Gold” term is generic when it is used in connection with jewelry and/or watches, and thus, it is not protectable as a trademark regardless of whether Solid 21 can show that consumers have come to associate the term with it and its products.

To bolster the argument that “Red Gold” is merely a generic term to describe rose gold, counsel for LVMH pointed to a dozen different patents that use the term “red gold” to describe the material of jewelry or watches, and more than 60 different articles that use the term “red gold” in a generic manner.

“To grant trademark status to a generic term essentially gives a single user a monopoly and prevents all other manufacturers from accurately identifying their products,” LVMH argued in a 2014 bid for interlocutory review. Ultimately, LVMH and Solid 21 resolved the matter and entered into a confidential settlement agreement in 2018, following more than 8 years of proceedings before federal courts in California.

The Solid 21, LVMH settlement came roughly 5 years after Aire and co. settled the virtually identical suit they filed against Breitling. While it appeared as though Solid 21 and Breitling had resolved their differences by way of a October 2013 settlement agreement, Solid 21 reignited the fight and filed a new suit against the Swiss luxury watchmaker last week in a federal court in Connecticut.

In something of a déjà vu filing, Solid 21 claims that Breitling’s use of the words “Red Gold” in its advertising constitutes trademark infringement and dilution, as well as false designation of origin. It turns out, the case that the two parties had settled was dismissed without prejudice, meaning that Solid 21 could bring the same claims against the same defendant again in the future. And that is precisely what it has done.

This repeat lawsuit tactic is hardly a novel one for Solid 21. Less than one year after entering into an out-of-court settlement with Cartier, Jaeger-LeCoultre, Officine Panerai, and Piaget’s parent company Richemont in 2011, Solid 21 filed suit against the Swiss conglomerate again for allegedly infringing its “Red Gold” trademark.

In that case, just as in the many others that preceded and have succeeded it, Solid 21 claims that Richemont’s “use of the ‘Red Gold’ mark in the design, manufacturing, marketing, advertising, and/or sale of their products is likely to cause confusion” amongst consumers as to whether “Solid 21 is somehow affiliated, connected, or associated with Richemont” and its products. As a result, Solid 21 argues that it “has suffered and will continue to suffer irreparable injury to its business, reputation, and goodwill, and will sustain loss of revenue and profits, while [Richemont] profits from such prohibited use.”

All the while, Solid 21 has routinely asserted – including by way of many strongly-worded press releases circulated by its public relations arm – that the “Red Gold” trademark is synonymous with Chris Aire and its upscale offerings. Yet, as the brand’s name continues to appear on complaints in courts across the country, Chris Aire and Solid 21 are arguably becoming far better known for their litigiousness than any type of jewelry offerings."
"Are Gucci, LVMH's donations to rebuild Notre-Dame part of a brand-building exercise? - The Economic Times","Mon, 22 Apr 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimAFodHRwczovL20uZWNvbm9taWN0aW1lcy5jb20vbWFnYXppbmVzL3BhbmFjaGUvYXJlLWd1Y2NpLWx2bWhzLWRvbmF0aW9ucy10by1yZWJ1aWxkLW5vdHJlLWRhbWUtcGFydC1vZi1hLWJyYW5kLWJ1aWxkaW5nLWV4ZXJjaXNlL2FydGljbGVzaG93LzY4OTkwMzY1LmNtc9IBnAFodHRwczovL20uZWNvbm9taWN0aW1lcy5jb20vbWFnYXppbmVzL3BhbmFjaGUvYXJlLWd1Y2NpLWx2bWhzLWRvbmF0aW9ucy10by1yZWJ1aWxkLW5vdHJlLWRhbWUtcGFydC1vZi1hLWJyYW5kLWJ1aWxkaW5nLWV4ZXJjaXNlL2FtcF9hcnRpY2xlc2hvdy82ODk5MDM2NS5jbXM?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Agencies In this file photo dated Monday, April 15, 2019, with the Eiffel Tower behind, left, flames and smoke rise from the blaze at Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris that destroyed its spire and its roof but spared its twin medieval bell towers, and prompted a frantic rescue effort to save its most precious artefacts.

If the fire at Notre Dame cathedral had happened 20 or 50 years ago, France’s luxury fashion houses would surely have rushed to support its reconstruction as quickly as they did in 2019.There is no doubting the sincerity of LVMH Kering SA and their founding families, who led the way with donations after the devastation earlier this week. The city of Paris, its streets and landmarks, have held a special role as the artistic center of the industry since its earliest days, so to restore what has been lost is to preserve its own history.But more than a century after Coco Chanel sold her first hat, the titans of luxury have even more reason to ensure Notre Dame recovers.And it is not just that they are among the wealthiest in France — LVMH’s Bernard Arnault is France’s richest man and Francois Pinault , who created Kering SA, ranks third. L’Oreal SA and its principal shareholder, the Bettencourt Meyers family, are also key donors.Fashion generates 2.7 percent of French gross domestic product. Luxury, including L’Oreal, represents 19.8 percent of the CAC 40 index. With such a sizable share of the nation’s business, it’s only natural that the leading producers of high-end goods would step up to preserve one of their country’s iconic locations.It’s important that they do, because selling high-end goods has changed over the past decade. The lines are blurring between fashion, art, travel and culture, and developing a brand depends on so much more than offering the latest It bag. Success means blending all these elements together, so there’s a drive to branch out.The big groups are already involved in art and restoration. LVMH opened the Fondation Louis Vuitton, a Frank Gehry-designed center for contemporary arts, on the western edge of Paris in 2016. Pinault, meanwhile, is building a museum to house his private art collection at the former Bourse de Commerce, in the center of Paris.Notre Dame is associated with heritage and beauty, values that resonate within the luxury industry. Preserving the cathedral burnishes donors’ position as a guardian of those characteristics, which in turn highlights the broader lifestyle they seek to promote.Landmark preservation fits well with this ethos.Fendi, part of the LVMH empire, contributed $2 million to the repair of the Trevi fountain in Rome. Sister brand Bulgari donated $1.7 million to overhaul the city’s Spanish Steps. Outside of the Arnault stable, Italian leather goods group Tod’s SpA has underwritten the $28 million restoration of the Colosseum in Rome.Their altruism works best on high-profile sites that appeal to tourists, as their donations also literally put their names on the map for the millions of visitors to key locations each year. Fendi even held a fashion show at the Trevi Fountain under the late Karl Lagerfeld. A restored Notre Dame will be no different (though fashion shows may not be allowed).The real prize for the French houses is to assure their connection to the Chinese, who are the number one buyers of luxury goods globally. LVMH and Kering each generate about a third of their sales from Asia excluding Japan.Paris is one of the main destinations for travelers from this region, and anything that affects visits can also impact sales of luxury goods. For example, the 2015 tourist attacks on the city, and the recent yellow vest protests, hurt demand. On the other hand, a weaker euro can lift sales. For these companies, there is a special urgency to ensure that Paris is preserved.When Notre Dame is finally rebuilt, donors will rightly be credited with rescuing a symbol of the city.They’ll also have created an even bigger draw for visitors. It makes good business sense for them to have taken part."
"How a Mall Is Bringing Everyone, Including Bernard Arnault, to Chengdu - Jing Daily","Fri, 19 Apr 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiJ2h0dHBzOi8vamluZ2RhaWx5LmNvbS9wb3N0cy9jaGVuZ2R1LWlmc9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"There must be something spectacular about Chengdu IFS if French billionaire and LVMH CEO Bernard Arnault decided to visit the luxury shopping mall earlier this month to learn why his brands are performing so well there.

Chengdu IFS opened in 2014 and is now the top luxury shopping destination in the city, as well as one of the most influential premium malls in China’s Midwest region. The 210,000-sqm, nine-floor shopping mall, which was developed by the Hong Kong property company The Wharf Holdings, is today the home to over 600 luxury, fashion, and lifestyle shops and services. 15 percent of those stores are ""ultra-luxury"" brands, 34 percent are premium fashion brands, 18 percent are affordable luxury brands, and the rest are dining, entertainment, and lifestyle services.

A number of high-profile luxury brands from Chanel and Moynat to Moncler and Tom Ford opened their first-ever flagship stores in the region at Chengdu IFS, while brands like Dior and Arnault's Louis Vuitton have their largest regional stores there. All of this indicates just how strategic Chengdu IFS is to luxury brands like LVMH wanting to shore up their retail networks in Chengdu, one of China's biggest tier-two cities that holds an enormous potential of luxury consumption.

“Since the opening, the mall has achieved double-digit growth in both sales and rentals each year,” said Christina Hau, Wharf China Estates Limited Assistant Director and General Manager (Retail Leasing & Operations), about the mall's success. “Many luxury brands are satisfied with their performance at Chengdu IFS, with a lot of them seeing their sales here entering the brand’s top three rankings in China.” This robust growth has continued even as China’s economic growth has experienced a downturn — something that usually dampens consumer confidence and affects retail performance. “Our business is still performing strongly based on the sales figures in the first quarter of this year, and the growth of many international top-tier luxury brands has not seen signs of a slowdown due to China’s macroeconomic environment,” said Hau.

The cozy and laid-back culture in Chengdu, where the locals also insist on living life to the fullest, makes it a unique place for luxury consumption. “People in Chengdu and the neighboring regions know how to enjoy life through shopping and eating… They are also less sensitive to prices compared to consumers in other Chinese cities,"" Hau explained. ""To them, shopping has to bring happiness and fulfillment. They are rarely fussy about prices.” That's why as the third-largest fashion capital in China (behind Beijing and Shanghai), Chengdu has yet to experience any economic impact on the city’s luxury purchasing power.

Chengdu IFS is located in one of the city's most vibrant economic areas, the commercial Chunxi Road region, right alongside other major shopping malls and department stores like Taikoo Li and Parkson. It's easy for consumers to travel there from all corners of Chengdu via public transportation or cabs for their shopping needs.

Its convenient location also makes Chengdu IFS a must-see for tourists. “The mall is a landmark of the city,” said Hau. “According to our client-profiling data, a great number of our customers are actually coming from outside of Chengdu and are here to travel or on business trips. For instance, they come from Guizhou, Tibet, Zhejiang, Beijing, and Shanghai. Many of them are even our gold card holders.”

But Chengdu IFS is even bigger than you think. It's not a standalone shopping mall, but instead is part of a large-scale commercial complex that includes three “Grade A” office buildings, one luxury hotel, and one high-end service apartment building. To an extent, Chengdu IFS’s commercial concept is similar to New York City’s new landmark Hudson Yards development, which offers everything from shopping and working to dining and entertainment in the hopes that they'll keep customers inside their economic zone for as long as possible.

The width of brand selection at Chengdu IFS meets the diverse needs of the city's luxury shoppers. Consumers who prefer a conventional luxury shopping experience can visit the floors 1-3, where boutique stores from well-known luxury brands are showcasing their newest collections. “Our mall has a deep diversity of luxury goods. Some items that you won’t be able to find in Hong Kong can be found here,” said Winnie Wong, Chengdu IFS Brand & Marketing Deputy General Manager.

But Chengdu IFS also didn't miss out on edgy or niche luxury fashion brands that have yet to gain a foothold in China but are already trending with the country’s forward-looking fashionistas. The first Lane Crawford store in China’s Midwest region is located in this part of Chengdu IFS (floors 3-4), which offers a slew of hot, young designer labels such as The Row, Thom Browne, Gabriela Hearst, and Sacai.

The quality of visitors to a mall is crucial in deciding its business performance. In this respect, Chinese supermodel Lv Yan, who is also the founder of contemporary womenswear brand Comme Moi , endorsed Chengdu IFS’s efforts to attract wealthy customers for their brands.

“Chengdu IFS has gathered a group of high-quality customers through hosting a lot of business, culture and art events, which is highly helpful,” said Lv. Her store debuted at the mall's Lane Crawford store in early 2015. After seeing steady sales growth, Comme Moi launched a pop-up store from August 14-27, 2017, where it scored around 119,200 (RMB 800,000) in sales. Today, the brand is operating as an independent boutique store at Chengdu IFS.

Aside from gaining new customers, the mall recognizes the importance of retaining their existing ones. Chengdu IFS has designed its own VIP program that hosts over 260,000 members thus far. It also extends their shopping experience to digital platforms like WeChat, where members can participate in online events, redeem points, and purchase products on its mini-program store. A highlight of its offerings to high-end VIP clients is a concierge delivery service that ships luxury goods home for them — an initiative that's been highly praised by the mall's luxury brands.

Like many successful shopping malls around the globe, Chengdu IFS is witnessing contemporary art become a steady influence on millennials and Generation Z, and it's actively following this trend as a way to embrace these art-lennials. Since its inception, art has been a vital part of the mall's DNA, with unique art installations punctuating the giant space to make it feel more like a tourist attraction. For example, Chengdu IFS’s gigantic and iconic panda sculpture, which hangs over its main entrance, is a commission created by artist Lawrence Argent. The sculpture has become the most Instagram-able place of the mall today, attracting hundreds and thousands of visitors to come and take pictures each day.

Occasionally, Chengdu IFS is used as the venue to host large-scale city events, such as the Parcours Art Festival in September, which was a joint initiative between the Chengdu government and the high-end Parisian neighborhood of Saint-Germain-des-Prés. With the mall's help, luxury brands Fendi, Chopard, and Loewe co-presented themed art exhibitions during the festival to reach Chinese customers via creative storytelling. Moynat, Longchamp, and Comme Moi even released exclusive products to celebrate it. And this April, Chengdu IFS is once again going celebrate Tibetan culture and art as a way to bridge the gap of understanding between Tibet and the rest of China.

So, is Chengdu IFS’s success replicable? Not all cities have access to Chengdu's desirable luxury customers (who care more about the shopping experience than price tags) but the way Chengdu IFS operates may offer some good lessons to struggling mall retailers. It has all the key ingredients: good location, high-quality client base, a solid retail network of strong brands, and most importantly, top-notch environment and services. With all of this at its disposal, it would be hard not to thrive."
LVMH-backed label to widen portfolio | The Standard - Hong Kong Standard,"Mon, 01 Apr 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXN0YW5kYXJkLmNvbS5oay9zZWN0aW9uLW5ld3MvZmMvMS8yMDY0ODIvTFZNSC1iYWNrZWQtbGFiZWwtdG8td2lkZW4tcG9ydGZvbGlv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Mainland fashion menswear brand GXG, backed by luxury goods giant LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE, refiled its Hong Kong initial public offering application under the new name of Mulsanne recently.

The Ningbo-based brand filed the initial application in March last year, aiming to raise up to US$300 million (HK$2.34 billion), according to Bloomberg.

Founded in 2007, Mulsanne's brand portfolio consists of GXG series, including GXG, gxg jeans and gxg.kids, as well as sportswear brands Yatlas and 2XU, targeting mid- to high-end customers. The company generated over 96 percent of revenue from the GXG series and over 66 percent from the GXG brand in the past 3 years.

L Catterton Asia and Crescent Point, two private equity firms backed by LVMH, bought a majority stake in GXG in 2016.

Mulsanne accounted for about 3.3 percent of the menswear market share and ranked second in mainland China in 2018 in terms of total retail revenue, according to industry consultant China Insights Consultancy.

Mulsanne operated 2,251 retail stores in China including 723 self-owned stores, 536 partnership stores and 992 distributor stores, as of March this year.

Its online distribution channels include major online platforms, such as Alibaba's Tmall and Taobao, as well as Tencent's (0700) WeChat mini program. Revenue generated from sales of apparel through online channels increased from 23.7 percent in 2016 to 34.5 percent in 2017, and further to 35.7 percent in 2018.

Mulsanne recorded 11.2 percent year-on-year decline in net profit for 2018 to 374.5 million yuan (HK$436.28 million). Gross profit margin also fell by 0.4 percentage points to 53.7 percent in 2018, mainly due to the increasing cost of purchases, while the product prices remained stable, as well as the change in revenue mix, the firm says.

The cost of apparel products grew by 9.08 percent year-on-year to 1.74 billion yuan in 2018.

Meanwhile, actual sales return rate continued to rise, up by 2.6 percentage points to 26.8 percent in 2017, and further to 35 percent in 2018.

The increase in actual sales return rate from 2017 to 2018 was primarily because its VIP distributors, who were allowed to return products during the period from 2017 to the first quarter of 2018, mostly returned the products in 2018, the company says.

Mulsanne typically achieves higher revenue from the sales of autumn and winter collections due to the higher average unit selling price. Also, it records higher sales typically before holiday seasons such as Chinese New Year and during major promotion periods such as Alibaba's Singles' Day, it says.

The sales and inventory could fluctuate due to extreme or unusual weather. Fast Retailing (9983), the owner of Uniqlo and GU, and Bossini (0592) posted a net profit drop and extended its loss respectively at the beginning this year as the unseasonably warm weather hit winter sales.

In September 2017, Mulsanne obtained a syndicated banking facility of up to US$226 million from 12 banks including Citibank Hong Kong and CMB International Finance through share pledging. The facility is scheduled to mature in September 2022.

All of the amounts had been drawn down under the facility, and US$22.6 million of the borrowing has been repaid as of March this year, the company says.

Mulsanne intends to use part of net proceeds of its flotation to repay debt and reduce financial expenses.

Another portion of the net proceeds will be deployed to expand the brand and product portfolio by pursuing brand acquisitions or strategic alliances, upgrade offline retail stores to smart stores, establish an advanced smart logistics center, and for working capital and other general corporate purposes."

Who is Bernard Arnault and why is Europe's richest man so keen to save Notre Dame

His luxury goods empire includes Louis Vuitton and Christian Dior, but now Bernard Arnault is stepping up to save Notre Dame.

And he's certainly not short of a bob or two. The 70-year-old is the richest man in Europe - with a luxury goods empire the envy of the world.

A lover of the arts, the iconic structure is in need of Mr Arnault's help. Huge parts of the 850-year-old building in Paris have been destroyed in the blaze last night, including the iconic spire and roof.

""In the wake of this national tragedy, the Arnault family and the LVMH Group pledge their support for #NotreDame. They will donate a total of 200 million euros to the fund for reconstruction of this architectural work, which is an integral part of the history of France,"" the official account of the LVMH Group Tweeted on Tuesday morning in the wake of the devastating fire that has destroyed so much of the 800-year-old cathedral.

But who is Bernard Arnault and how did his family build up its £70 billion fortune?

Starting out

Arnault was born in Roubaix, France – a couple of hours drive from Paris on the Belgian border – in 1949. He studied engineering, his dad owned a civil engineering firm, in the suburbs of Paris and graduated in 1971.

After university he joined his dad's firm – changing its focus to real estate and specialising in holiday accommodation. By 1979 he'd taken over as president.

Five years later he changed focus again, taking over Financière Agache, then selling everything the company owned except the Christian Dior brand and Le Bon Marché department store.

His move into luxury goods would be one that turned him from well off into one of the richest people alive.

Louis Vuitton Moët Hennesy

Arnault first got involved with Louis Vuitton Moët Hennesy (LVMH) in 1987 – shortly after the two firms merged.

The luxury group held rights to some of Dior's perfumes, and he mediated a dispute between the chief executive of Moët and Louis Vuitton's president.

In 1988 he teamed up with Guinness and put money into a firm that held 24% of LVMH's shares, in January 1989 he spent even more cash to take control of 43.5% of its shares and made himself important enough to block any plans to dismantle the group.

After this he was unanimously elected chairman of the firm.

Under his guidance LVMH saw its sales and profits soar 500% as it rose to be one of the biggest luxury brands on the planet while Arnault's personal wealth saw him listed as the richest man in France and the 4th richest man in 2019.

Interest in the arts

Arnault's move to provide funds and help to Notre Dame is entirely fitting with his interest in art and history, and long association with Paris.

His personal collection includes works by Picasso and French artist Yves Klein, as well as Any Warhol and Henry Moore.

He also started the Louis Vuitton Foundation – an art museum and cultural centre - building project and was instrumental in turning LVMH into a major supporter of art in France.

He's currently married to Canadian pianist Hélène Mercier – his second wife – and has one daughter and four sons."

The 105 metre luxury superyacht ‘Symphony’ is the first Feadship to cross 100m and it is now owned by the richest man in France, LVMH CEO Arnault

Apr 20, 2019 | By Angelyn Tan

Ranked 50 out of the world’s top 100 superyachts, the 101.5 metre six deck “Symphony” luxury super yacht with its “bones” by De Voogt Naval Architects and designed by Tim Heywood Design is the largest Feadship ever built in 2015 (a record since been broken by the 110 metre Feadship 1001). The Symphony is also the first Feadship to be fully compliant with the new Passenger Yacht Code regulations, allowing more than the usual twelve passengers.

First Feadship larger than 100 metres, “Symphony” luxury super yacht is Owned by LVMH CEO

The CEO of French multinational luxury goods conglomerate, LVMH, owns the largest Feadship to be ever built according to Yacht Habor. According to Forbes, Bernard Arnault with a net worth of US$93.5 billion, is one the world’s top ten billionaires and the richest man in France. Unsurprisingly, the man who has been shaping the luxury world for 35 years is bound to own a luxury mega yacht worth US$150 million.

Arnault’s previous yacht Amadeus was sold in 2016 for an asking price of US$50 million euros and has recently donated €200 million to the rebuilding fund for Notre Dame de Paris. The “Symphony” yacht is worthUS$150 million.

Designed by Tim Heywood and built by Feadship in the Netherlands as Project 808, Symphony has a gross tonnage of near 3,000GT. With an aluminium structure, the yacht can house 36 passengers and is an eco-friendly yacht, using 30 per cent less fuel than other similar yachts.

Symphony has a couple of luxury features such as a 6 metre glass-bottom swimming pool on main deck, an outdoor cinema on bridge deck, and a jacuzzi on the sundeck. While the owner’s deck is equipped with double bathrooms, dressing rooms and a sauna, a forward terrace with Jacuzzi, a private office and a study, a lounge and a spacious aft deck area for lounging with a dining table for 20.

Arnault interest for the yacht industry dates back to 2008 when Arnault ventured into the yacht industry by leading an acquisition of British yacht manufacturer, Princess Yachts which saw L Capital, a fund controlled by LVMH, gain a 70 per cent controlling stake in Princess Yachts. Feadship, the world leading brand of custom-built luxury mega-yachts, has been working with LVMH closely since 2008.

Plans have been unveiled for what could be the most expensive hotel ever built in London at a cost of £500million.

LMVH, the French company behind Moet and Chandon, Louis Vuitton and Hennessy, is bringing its exclusive Cheval Blanc hotel chain to Mayfair with plans for an 83-room facility.

The Royals, Jay Z, Beyonce and a whole host of A-listers have been known to stay at the Cheval Blanc hotels in Courchevel, the Maldives, Saint-Barthelemy and Saint Tropez.

The new hotel will see the existing office buildings in Grafton Street and Bruton Lane knocked down to make way for two linked seven and 11-storey buildings that will house its luxury facilities. Only a listed facade in Grafton Street is set to survive.

Proposals boast an underground spa, exclusive restaurants, including a Louis Vuitton cafe, and a roof terrace.

Planning documents submitted to Westminster Council talk of a 25-metre pool, two restaurants, including one run by a Michelin-star chef, a bar and six private apartments.

Developers claim the huge triangular site at the heart of the city will 'blend sensitively with the historic surrounding buildings and enhance the setting and ambiance of the Mayfair Conservation Area'.

Sir Norman Foster, who has been behind the Gherkin and the Millennium Bridge elsewhere in the capital, and his practice Foster and Partners, have been chosen by LMVH so it can branch out into the 'experience' industry, as well as fashion.

Helen Brocklebank, of luxury goods body Walpole, told the Evening Standard: 'LVMH's acquisition of British hospitality group, Belmond, at the end of last year clearly marked out the scale of their ambition in luxury experiences.'

She added: 'The plans for a new hotel right in the beating heart of luxury London is hugely exciting, complements the iconic Brown's and Claridge's nearby, and will be a real draw for affluent visitors.'

Louis Vuitton blockchain project “beginning of a new era” for luxury brands - Verdict,"Mon, 29 Apr 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiM2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZlcmRpY3QuY28udWsvbG91aXMtdnVpdHRvbi1ibG9ja2NoYWluL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The reported plans by Louis Vuitton owner LVMH to launch a major blockchain project will “set a new standard in the world of luxury” according to a newly published report by Certilogo.

First reported by Coindesk in March, the Louis Vuitton blockchain project has not yet been officially commented on by LVMH, but is likely to see luxury goods from both Louis Vuitton and Parfums Christian Dior paired with a blockchain-based digital twin. This will ensure traceability and guarantee the authenticity of the products, which are common targets for counterfeiting.

The report, Making Blockchain Real: LVMH and the Future of Authentic Luxury, found that appetite for technologies that could ensure the authenticity of luxury goods was extremely high, with the majority of consumers expressing concern about possible counterfeiting.

In a survey of 1,500 consumers conducted by Certilogo across the UK, the US, Italy, France and China, 83% said that they had been concerned that brand-name products they had purchased might be counterfeit.

This was even higher in China, one of the biggest consumers of luxury goods, where 95% of respondents expressed concern over the issue.

Louis Vuitton blockchain plans mark the start of an industry wide transformation

According to Certilogo, the Louis Vuitton blockchain project is likely to be the start of an industry wide change, as other brands seek to follow suit. Reports have also suggested LVMH is likely to offer the technology as a white-label solution to other luxury brands, making rapid proliferation plausible.

“When a big name with such a lot of respect, such as LVMH, decides that product authentication is a must for luxury customers, it’s time for every brand that’s in the high-end luxury and lifestyle market to pay attention,” said Michele Casucci, founder and CEO of Certilogo.

“This is the beginning of a new era for genuine luxury and its good news for everyone.”

However, the report acknowledges that blockchain has its own limits, saying that it will not on its own “cure the epidemic of counterfeit products in luxury”, however Certilogo argued that “it can be a useful building block in a comprehensive brand strategy to fight counterfeits”.

“The blockchain is one of the most exciting technologies of our generation to show consumers where a product comes from, who made it, what it is made of and whether it is genuine, but there are also some limits,” said Casucci.

The project, which is believed to be dubbed AURA, is reported to be launching in May or June of this year.

French Fashion Billionaires Offer Huge Donations To Restore Notre Dame - MinuteHack,"Tue, 16 Apr 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vbWludXRlaGFjay5jb20vbmV3cy9mcmVuY2gtZmFzaGlvbi1iaWxsaW9uYWlyZXMtb2ZmZXItaHVnZS1kb25hdGlvbnMtdG8tcmVzdG9yZS1ub3RyZS1kYW1l0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"French billionaire Francois-Henri Pinault has pledged to donate 100 million euro (£86 million) to rebuild Notre Dame as he called the cathedral a “symbol of spirituality and our common humanity”.

The businessman and fashion mogul, who is married to the Hollywood star Salma Hayek, has been joined by fellow fashion billionaire Bernard Arnault in offering large sums for the reconstruction of the fire-damaged Paris landmark.

Mr Arnault, the chief executive of LVMH, which owns fashion houses including Louis Vuitton, Christian Dior and Marc Jacobs, said his family and the LVMH Group will donate 200 million euros (£173 million) to the fund for the reconstruction.

Mr Pinault told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, that “it has to be a collective endeavour” to renovate the building, saying that “everyone with means and recourse should participate”.

He said it was a “shock” to see the building on fire on Monday night, adding: “We need to rebuild collectively this part of our history, of our culture, so it’s an urgent, urgent need to move forward, so I decided to unlock a very important amount of money to do that.”

Asked if others from around the world could also donate, he said: “Everyone is welcome, it goes beyond France, it’s a symbol of our culture, a symbol of spirituality and our common humanity.”

Mr Pinault, 56, the son of French mogul Francois Pinault, has been chairman and chief executive of Kering, formerly Pinault Distribution and PPR, since 2005.

Under his leadership the group sold off its retail assets including La Redoute and Printemps and merged with the Gucci Group, which oversees luxury brands including Gucci, Yves Saint Laurent and Alexander McQueen.

He has been president of his family’s investment firm, Groupe Artemis, since 2003, and said it is this group that will donate funds, adding it comes with no strings attached or “ownership” as to how it is used to repair Notre Dame.

Mr Arnault, 70, has led LVMH since it was created in 1987 following the merger of Louis Vuitton and Moet Hennessy, transforming it in to one of the biggest luxury groups in the world.

He has overseen the acquisition of high-end brands including Celine, Kenzo, Guerlain, Emilio Pucci and DKNY.

A statement from LVMH on Twitter said: “In the wake of this national tragedy, the Arnault family and the LVMH Group pledge their support for #NotreDame.

“They will donate a total of 200 million euros to the fund for reconstruction of this architectural work, which is an integral part of the history of France.”"

Franç​​ois-Henri Pinault, CEO of French luxury group Kering, which owns brands like Gucci, Yves Saint Laurent and Balenciaga, mentioned on Monday night that he and his family will be donating €100 million (RM467 million) to rebuild the cathedral.

Bernard Arnault, the chair of LVMH, doubled that donation on Tuesday morning. LVMH, the world’s largest luxury-goods company, includes brands Louis Vuitton and Christian Dior.



---

A raging fire yesterday evening tore through the revered Gothic cathedral, destroying its delicate spire in front of horrified onlookers and sending its art repository up in flames. The 850-year-old relic, whose name means Our Lady, is the seat of the archbishop of Paris, and home to various artefacts and artworks collected over the centuries.

Visited by over 14 million visitors a year, the symbol of beauty has witnessed much of French history, including the coronation of Henry VI as King of France and Napoleon as emperor. President Emmanuel Macron described the fire as a “terrible tragedy” on national TV, with the fire-engulfed still behind him.

“I’m telling you all tonight – we will rebuild this cathedral together. This is probably part of the French destiny. And we will do it in the next years. Starting tomorrow, a national donation scheme will be started that will extend beyond our borders.”

Emergency services said that most invaluable artefacts are salvaged, including The Crown of Thorns, said to have been worn by Jesus Christ before the crucifixion, and the tunic of St Louis. While the cause of the fire is still under investigation, Parisians and tourists have gathered outside the church, raising their voices in prayer.

Macron lamented the destruction of the awe-inspiring building, calling it a place where the French live their greatest moments, “from wars to pandemics to liberations”. Here are five more facts about this feat of architecture that sealed its status as a cultural symbol of France.



Paris’ point zero

A geographic marker, embedded in the concrete of the public square just outside of Notre-Dame Cathedral, is the central point from which all roads in France are measured. One of a number of “kilometre zeroes” around the world, the centre of Paris is marked by an octagonal brass plate, sparking a surprising number of local rituals, from spinning in a circle on one foot atop to gain your heart’s desire or kissing a loved one to ensure eternal devotion.

A forest top

There’s a reason the roof of Notre-Dame is called “the Forest”. Containing one of the oldest surviving wood-timbre frames in Paris, the cathedral is supported by wooden beams, each constructed from an individual tree. At least 52 acres of trees were cut down in the 12th century to support the medieval roof structure. (Ed: Reports have claimed that the wooden latticework inside the cathedral had fuelled the fire that consumed the iconic church).

The bells were once melted down for artillery

Interestingly, the bells of Notre-Dame bear names such as Emmanuel, Gabriel, Marcel, Etienne, Maurice, Jean-Marie, etc. However, the bells we now hear are not the same ones installed upon completion of the cathedral 600 years ago. Like other churches around France, it was transformed in the late 18th century from a Christian space to the new Cult of Reason. All 20 of its bells, except the enormous Emmanuel, were melted down to make cannons. The public remarked that the instruments were not as intricately made as the older versions as they make a dissonant chime but a new ensemble of bells were restored to its 17th-century sound in 2013.

A honeyed roof

The south side of the cathedral is home to a surprising group of residents – bees. On the building’s sacristy, a bee hive was installed in the spring of 2013 as part of a Parisian trend. The Buckfast bees, a strain developed by a monk named Brother Adam – are known for their gentleness. Their honey, made from the flowering plants from the city’s balconies and gardens, were given away to the poor.

Statues of biblical kings were beheaded

Twenty eight – that’s the number of statues that were pulled down with ropes and decapitated by a mob. During the Revolution, the people was so disgusted with the monarchy that they took down every symbol of royalty on the streets of Paris. However, the statues that were removed were not of French Kings, but representations of the kings of Judah. It wasn’t until 1977 that the heads of 21 of these kings were discovered during work on the basement of the French Bank of Foreign Trade. They can now be observed in the Musée du Moyen-Âge de Cluny (Middle-Ages Museum of Cluny) on the left bank."
"Bulgari, Armani, Versace: Why luxury fashion brands open hotels as more get into the game - TODAY","Thu, 18 Apr 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRvZGF5b25saW5lLmNvbS93b3JsZC9idWxnYXJpLWFybWFuaS12ZXJzYWNlLXdoeS1sdXh1cnktZmFzaGlvbi1icmFuZHMtb3Blbi1ob3RlbHMtbW9yZS1nZXQtZ2FtZdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"HONG KONG — Late last year LVMH made headlines when it announced it was acquiring travel and luxury hospitality group Belmond. While it was not the luxury conglomerate’s first foray into hospitality – it owns and operates its own brand of hotels called Cheval Blanc – it signalled a larger trend that has seen more fashion and lifestyle brands enter the hospitality sector.

“Fashion and hospitality are both aspirational, experiential and a reflection of one’s lifestyle, so there are plenty of synergies there,” says Ms Catherine Feliciano-Chon, managing partner of marketing agency CatchOn.

“Being able to have a physical space beyond a conventional retail store is immensely powerful in bringing that brand to life and opens them up to a lot of other product categories, like furniture.”

The fashion-branded hotel emerged in the early noughties when Versace opened its first Palazzo in Australia. Brands including Armani and Ferragamo followed (the latter built its own portfolio of hotels under the Lungarno Collection), while fashion designers started collaborating with hotel groups on interiors and other projects.

Today the market is dominated by several players including Bulgari, which currently boasts six hotels with three more planned to open in Moscow, Tokyo and Paris by the end of 2022.

“The hotel industry is a very different business from fashion, so not all the brands that started this venture were successful,” says Mr Silvio Ursini, vice-president of Bulgari Hotels and Resorts. “At the moment only a very few ‘fashion’ brands are still present in the hospitality scene.

Consistency with brand values and identity is the key for success in any diversification process, but in the hospitality sector it is particularly challenging and the reason why it is still a growing trend.”

Unlike their predecessors, the new generation of branded hotels are built around the idea of creating experiences and communities.

The luxury watchmaker Audemars Piguet, for example – which recently announced it would be opening its first hotel – did not choose a thriving capital like London or Zurich for its property, but the small village of Le Brassus in Switzerland’s Vallée de Joux, where its headquarters and manufacturing facilities are based.

Guests will be able to ski down the hotel’s zigzagging roof or visit the nearby Musée Atelier Audemars Piguet, which will feature over 1,300 timepieces.

“The real value of these type of operations, as well as the return on investment, lies in the possibility to tap into alternative marketing tools and create an experiential channel,” says Ms Cristiana Schiavolin, a management consultant working with direct-to-consumer brands and retail operators.

“Much of retail has lost its human touch, but hospitality still delivers analogue experiences people are longing for, such as access to a community sharing similar tastes and values.”

A similar proposition has influenced plans for the latest Cheval Blanc property in London. As well as opening the hotel in the city’s Mayfair district, the group will redevelop parts of the neighbourhood.

The hotel will be linked to restaurants, an underground spa, high-end retail outlets and the first-ever Louis Vuitton cafe, creating a hub rather than just a stand-alone hotel.

These new fashion hotels will continue to evolve as younger customers come to the fore. More mobile and worldly than the generation before, these travellers are more likely to pay for branded experiences versus a luxury product, making hotels the ideal place to spend their money while learning about the brand through a different channel.

Promoting a particular “culture” will also become increasingly important, as evidenced by cheaper brands like Shinola and Muji launching their own hotels.

“We live in a world of ‘tribes’ that have different preferences, inclinations to shopping and purchasing powers,” Ms Schiavolin says. “Most importantly, they each value their cultures. Adamantly, Shinola and Muji hotels talk to a customer who appreciates design and does not necessarily need a luxury environment. It’s about a service philosophy.”

But the long-term success of any hotel comes down to more than just branding. Operations require specific knowledge and expertise, which is why potential partnerships with other hotel groups could only drive this trend further.

“Simply put, fashion brands don’t know how to run hotels,” Ms Feliciano-Chon says. “So while they may lend their name or create a branded concept, they still rely on a hotel group to run it. Bulgari is a good example as it’s part of the Marriott group.

“With the case of LVMH, having Belmond as part of their portfolio strengthens the resources of Cheval Blanc. I’m betting that Belmond will be providing the operational and human resources to help Cheval Blanc grow.” SOUTH CHINA MORNING POST"
French fashion billionaires offer huge donations to restore Notre Dame - Guernsey Press,"Tue, 16 Apr 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vZ3Vlcm5zZXlwcmVzcy5jb20vbmV3cy91ay1uZXdzLzIwMTkvMDQvMTYvZnJlbmNoLWZhc2hpb24tYmlsbGlvbmFpcmVzLW9mZmVyLWh1Z2UtZG9uYXRpb25zLXRvLXJlc3RvcmUtbm90cmUtZGFtZS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"French billionaire Francois-Henri Pinault has pledged to donate 100 million euro (£86 million) to rebuild Notre Dame as he called the cathedral a “symbol of spirituality and our common humanity”.

The businessman and fashion mogul, who is married to the Hollywood star Salma Hayek, has been joined by fellow fashion billionaire Bernard Arnault in offering large sums for the reconstruction of the fire-damaged Paris landmark.

Mr Arnault, the chief executive of LVMH, which owns fashion houses including Louis Vuitton, Christian Dior and Marc Jacobs, said his family and the LVMH Group will donate 200 million euros (£173 million) to the fund for the reconstruction.

Mr Pinault told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, that “it has to be a collective endeavour” to renovate the building, saying that “everyone with means and recourse should participate”.

He said it was a “shock” to see the building on fire on Monday night, adding: “We need to rebuild collectively this part of our history, of our culture, so it’s an urgent, urgent need to move forward, so I decided to unlock a very important amount of money to do that.”

Asked if others from around the world could also donate, he said: “Everyone is welcome, it goes beyond France, it’s a symbol of our culture, a symbol of spirituality and our common humanity.”

Under his leadership the group sold off its retail assets including La Redoute and Printemps and merged with the Gucci Group, which oversees luxury brands including Gucci, Yves Saint Laurent and Alexander McQueen.

He has been president of his family’s investment firm, Groupe Artemis, since 2003, and said it is this group that will donate funds, adding it comes with no strings attached or “ownership” as to how it is used to repair Notre Dame.

Mr Arnault, 70, has led LVMH since it was created in 1987 following the merger of Louis Vuitton and Moet Hennessy, transforming it in to one of the biggest luxury groups in the world.

He has overseen the acquisition of high-end brands including Celine, Kenzo, Guerlain, Emilio Pucci and DKNY.

A statement from LVMH on Twitter said: “In the wake of this national tragedy, the Arnault family and the LVMH Group pledge their support for #NotreDame.

“They will donate a total of 200 million euros to the fund for reconstruction of this architectural work, which is an integral part of the history of France.”"
