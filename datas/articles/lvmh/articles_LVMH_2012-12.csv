In a statement announcing the surprise shake-up at the top of the world’s leading luxury fashion brand, LVMH said: “LVMH regrets to announce that Jordi Constans is leaving Louis Vuitton where he has been CEO.

“This sudden departure is due to the discovery of a significant health issue which requires that Mr Constans focus on this priority.”

In the press release, Bernard Arnault, Chairman and CEO of LVMH, said: “During his time with Louis Vuitton Jordi Constans has shown remarkable leadership which has earned him the respect of the entire team.

Europe’s richest man, LVMH boss Bernard Arnault, may see his application for Belgian nationality turned down. But there is better news for Gérard Depardieu. Chechen strongman Ramzan Kadyrov is “ready to welcome” after the film star announced he was giving up French citizenship in tax row.

Belgium’s immigration authority issued an unfavourable opinion on Arnault’s application three weeks ago, according to two Belgian papers, De Morgen andLa Libre Belgique, and De Morgen says it is likely to be refused.

Applicants for Belgian citizenship have to prove that their main home has been in the country for at least three years, which is not Arnault’s case.

Arnault, who is worth 31 billion euros according to Forbes magazine, has sued French daily Libération for “public insults” over a front page that invited him to “Clear off, rich loser” after he announced that he was moving to Belgium. The paper also lost 500,000 euros in advertising revenue when LVMH and other companies stopped advertising in the paper in protest at the headline, according to l’Express magazine. Arnault, who moved to the US for three years when a left-wing government was elected in 1981, insisted that he was not leaving France because of the Socialist government’s 75 per cent tax on incomes over one million euros a year, as Libération had assumed.

Depardieu, who makes no bones about the fact that he has moved to Belgium because of the supertax, recently said that he was sending back his French passport because Prime Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault described his decision as “pathetic”.

On Wednesday Chechen president Ramzan Kadyrov declared that he was “ready to welcome the great artist” in the republic, which is part of the Russian federation.

On Tuesday the website of Le Monde said that Depardieu had told friends that Russian President Vladimir Putin had “already sent me a passport” but Putin’s spokesperson Dmitry Peskov later said that “most likely he was joking”.

Kadyrov, a former Chechen separatist, has been accused of ruthless repression of his former comrades and corruption.

Depardieu in October attended a concert in the Chechen capital, Grozny, celebrating Kadyrov's birthday and spoke on stage in broken Russian, saying: ""Glory to Grozny! Glory to Chechnya! ... Glory to Kadyrov!""

However limited the roll call of famous Belgians, the country does not give away its citizenship to any old multibillionaire.

An application for Belgian citizenship by Europe’s wealthiest man, Bernard Arnault, the boss of the luxury goods giant Moët Hennessy-Louis Vuitton (LVMH), has been rebuffed by civil servants in Brussels. A final decision is expected in the spring but, according to the Belgian press, Mr Arnault’s application is likely to be rejected.

Mr Arnault – the world’s fourth-richest man, with an estimated worldwide fortune of $41bn – moved from Paris to Brussels a year ago. He insists that, unlike the actor Gérard Depardieu, he has not fled into exile from the high income and wealth taxes in France.

He merely wishes to become a Belgian. Under the existing rules, would-be new Belgians must have lived in the country for three years whether they are penniless Turks or French multibillionaires.

The national agency which deals with naturalisation requests, L’Office des Etrangers, has concluded that there is no reason to make an exception for Mr Arnault.

Belgium is notoriously fussy about the people it allows to become Belgians. Eight years ago, it rejected a naturalisation request from the veteran French rock star Johnny Hallyday, even though his father was a Belgian.

Last weekend, Mr Depardieu, France’s most celebrated actor, announced that he had given up his French citizenship after he was criticised by the government for moving into tax exile in Néchin, a village situated just north of the Franco-Belgian border. The Belgian government said yesterday, however, that it had received no naturalisation request from Mr Depardieu.

More than 500 French citizens – mostly very wealthy – are waiting to hear if they can become Belgians. Applications have increased by 10 per cent since the Socialist François Hollande won the French presidential election in May with, inter alia, a promise to increase income tax to 75 per cent on earnings of more than €1m.

It emerged today that another French billionaire, Alain Afflelou, the creator of a cut-price opticians’ chain, intends to move to London. He said this was to develop new business opportunities and not to avoid French taxes.

Mr Arnault and Mr Depardieu need not despair entirely. A new Belgian citizenship law takes effect next month. In future, ordinary mortals will have to live in Belgium for at least five years before they can apply for a passport. The waiting period will be waived for people with “exceptional merit” judged to have a bona fide link with Belgium.

Mr Arnault had hoped that the Belgian subsidiaries of his LVMH empire would weigh in his favour. Belgian newspapers pointed out yesterday, however, that a formal legal investigation has just begun into some of LVMH’s business dealings north of the French border.

Why Belgium?

Why the sudden French desire to be Belgian? It’s not just the beer, chocolate and moules frites: under existing tax agreements, French citizens who move north qualify for the less onerous Belgian tax regime whether they are Belgian or not. But Paris has indicated it wants to renegotiate this agreement, so a Belgian passport may rapidly become a valuable commodity.

The Belgian government suspects there may be an ulterior motive for wealthy French people’s new-found love of rain-drenched Belgium. Under a 1960s agreement, French residents of tax-free Monaco have to pay French taxes. Not so the Belgians..."
Louis Vuitton family launches wine for Chinese market - LUXUO,"Thu, 06 Dec 2012 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmx1eHVvLmNvbS9saWZlc3R5bGUvd2luZXMtc3Bpcml0cy94YXZpZXItbG91aXMtdnVpdHRvbi14bHYtd2luZXMuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Lifestyle / Alcohol

A fifth-generation family member of the Louis Vuitton dynasty has launched a wine in Hong Kong developed specifically to cater to the Asian palate.

A fifth-generation family member of the Louis Vuitton dynasty has launched a wine in Hong Kong developed specifically to cater to the Asian palate.



Winemaker Xavier-Louis Vuitton’s XLV, an exclusive private label, was developed with the Asian drinker in mind, a palate that favors fruit-driven notes and softer tannins in red wines, reports industry publication The Drinks Business.

While XLV has no connection with the Louis Vuitton brand LVMH, the family connection and name recognition is sure to sway consumers in brand-obsessed Hong Kong, notes the story.

Vuitton owns a wine estate near the village of Apt in southern France, which he manages with his son Quentin-Louis who acts as cellar master.

Only the Ventoux wine is made from Vuitton’s estate grapes, while others are made with grapes from the Bordeaux, Rhone, and Champagne regions.

The XLV brand is available through Hong Kong-based online retailer yeswine.com, with prices ranging from HK $360 (€36) for the XLV Ventoux 2010, to HK $2,450 for the XLV Pauillac 2007 or €242.

While Xavier-Louis may be developing a wine made with French grapes for Chinese drinkers, another brand within the LVMH family Moet Hennessy has set its sights on China as a wine-producing nation in its own right, snapping up estates in Shangri-La county in Yunnan Province.

Similarly, Chateau Lafite Rothschild has also begun work on a vineyard in the Penglai region of China’s eastern Shandong province to cater to the country’s growing thirst for premium luxury wines.

China is the fifth largest wine market by volume in the world, having recently knocked Britain into sixth place."
