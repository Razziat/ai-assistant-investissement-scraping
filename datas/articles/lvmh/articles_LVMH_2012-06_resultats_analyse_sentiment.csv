World largest luxury group LVMH inagurated last week its brand new hotel WHITE 1921 in Saint Tropez, which will be operated by LVMH Hotel Management.

Located in the heart of Saint-Tropez, on the well-known Place des Lices, the White 1921 opens its doors in the former Maison Blanche.

Designed by architect Jean-Michel Wilmotte, the bar set in the mansion’s garden invites you to a festive break. The 82-seat bar offers the finest champagnes by the glass, including a rare vintage of Moët & Chandon from 1921.





Eight rooms and suites decorated in a chic and modern style offer each a distinctive personality.

Open through Oct. 7, the hotel offers rooms from 270 euros, or $340, and suites from 650 euros, or $815 at current exchange rates.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999985694885254}",neutral,0.9999985694885254,0
Gucci Set To Open Southwest China Flagship In Chongqing - Jing Daily,"Tue, 05 Jun 2012 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vamluZ2RhaWx5LmNvbS9wb3N0cy9ndWNjaS1zZXQtdG8tb3Blbi1zb3V0aHdlc3QtY2hpbmEtZmxhZ3NoaXAtaW4tY2hvbmdxaW5n0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The mega-metropolis may have been in the news more for political controversy and intrigue than business over the past several months, but on June 18 the massive Chinese municipality of Chongqing -- larger than Taiwan and nearly as populous as Canada -- will see the opening of Gucci's southwest China flagship. Covering 800 square meters and two floors, the new location at Golden Eagle Shopping Center will stock the full Gucci collection of leathergoods, footwear, apparel, accessories and children's clothing for the ""Little Emperor.""

Coming just a year after Chongqing's much-hyped and ultimately ill-fated ""red revival,"" perhaps never before has the moniker ""Gucci Maoists "" been so apt.

Three years in the making, according to Chongqing media , the new location will be the centerpiece of the mall's new section, the remainder of which is still under construction and will open to the public by the end of the year. With 15,000 square meters of interior space, the new seven-floor section at Golden Eagle will include a new MUJI location in the basement, while a new Omega store and the two-story Gucci flagship will sit on the ground floor and a number of restaurants, bars and wine stores will fill the upper floors. Located near Chongqing’s Maison Mode shopping center, where Louis Vuitton opened a sprawling flagship last summer, Golden Eagle is also situated near the famous Jiefang Bei (解放碑) Pedestrian Street, likely a motivation for Gucci to build its second Chongqing location (after Starlight Place) there.

As major luxury brands have expanded into China's interior, tapping growing high-end spending among consumers in second-, third- and (increasingly) fourth-tier cities, Chongqing has become the de facto luxury hub of the country's southwest. As Xinmin (Chinese) put it last year:

As the only municipality in western China, Chongqing’s GDP is among the highest in the country. In terms of luxury consumption, Chongqing’s famous beauties are driving sales: revenue at Chongqing’s Armani boutique are the highest in the country; Burberry sales have surpassed Shanghai and Beijing; in addition, every year many Chongqingese fly to Europe or Hong Kong for shopping sprees.







According to recent rankings on retail investment attractiveness in Asia, Chongqing came out sixth. “As southwest China’s main city, Chongqing’s consumer behavior and purchasing power are very strong. Luxury goods are sure to see a breakthrough there,” said a representative from the Chongqing Economic Commission. Recently, the Asia-Pacific president of LVMH, the world’s largest luxury goods group, traveled to Chongqing to discuss a timeline for entering the market.







Chongqing residents spend thousands on limited-edition Tourbillon watches, they’re familiar with top brands, and they understand the meaning of “haute couture” and “made by hand.” What’s more, rapid economic development has given Chongqing a great amount of potential as a city of consumers. But Chongqing has unique characteristics: it’s trendy, but not trendsetting; occasionally provocative, but not extravagant; Chongqing residents go against the common wisdom of economists, remaining indifferent to conspicuous consumption. In Chongqing, the elegant and the vulgar coexist.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999603033065796}",neutral,0.9999603033065796,0

French luxury giant LVMH – Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton – Thursday said it bought fashion house Arnys, which makes clothes and accessories for men.

Arnys has been led by the Grimbert family since 1933 and most recently by Jean and Michel Grimbert, the third generation of the family to run and own the business.



This acquisition reflects Berluti’s strategy under Antoine Arnault to expand the activities of the celebrated shoe maker with the brand’s first men’s high end ready-to-wear collection.

Alessandro Sartori, Artistic Director and creator of the Fall/Winter 2012 collection will lead the brand’s made-to-measure activities.

Jean Grimbert will oversee the continuation of Arnys’ expertise and the boutique at 14, rue de Sevres in Paris, will become the flagship store for Berluti’s new activities.

This boutique will be one of the only places in France where it will be possible to order an entirely made-to-measure suit.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999821186065674}",neutral,0.9999821186065674,0
Luxury comes to Indonesia - Inside Retail Asia,"Sun, 24 Jun 2012 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vaW5zaWRlcmV0YWlsLmFzaWEvMjAxMi8wNi8yNC9sdXh1cnktY29tZXMtdG8taW5kb25lc2lhL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Indonesians will soon have access to more luxury brands as retailers gear up for openings.

Italian fashion label Prada will launch its first Indonesian store this fall at Plaza Indonesia Mall in Jakarta, making it the third luxury brand to operate directly in the country after Dior and Louis Vuitton. Also marking its debut is American fashion designer Michael Kors who is expected to open mono-brand stores in Indonesia via a franchise model.

Italian brands Fendi and Max Mara will also open their second stores in Jakarta at Senayan Plaza Mall by the end of this year. Their first stores are located at Plaza Indonesia Mall.

French department store Galleries Lafayette, through a local partner, will open by mid next year within Pacific Place mall.

Meanwhile, Mont Blanc, the German manufacturer of writing instruments, watches and accessories, which recently opened its largest concept store in Beijing, will expand its store at Senayan Plaza Mall this fall.

Not only foreign luxury retailers plan Jakarta openings. Indonesia’s luxury retailer The Time Place is also set to open its concept store at Senayan Plaza Mall that will feature top luxury brands including Hermes.

LVMH head for Southeast Asia, South Asia and Middle East, Ravi Thakran, believes Indonesia is under-penetrated by luxury brands and will become one of the biggest luxury markets in Southeast Asia region within a few years.
