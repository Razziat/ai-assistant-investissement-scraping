"Donna Karan Steps Down, in Major Shift for Fashion (Published 2015) - The New York Times","Tue, 30 Jun 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMTUvMDYvMzAvZmFzaGlvbi9kb25uYS1rYXJhbi1zdGVwcy1kb3duLmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"In a major shift for American fashion, Donna Karan, the 66-year-old founder and chief designer of Donna Karan International, a brand that defined the way American working women dressed for decades, announced on Tuesday that she was leaving the helm of the house that bears her name.

Ms. Karan will remain as an adviser to Donna Karan International, but devote more time to her Urban Zen line, which centers on wellness and artisanal goods, and its foundation.

LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, the French conglomerate that bought the house in 2001, said there were no immediate plans to replace her as a designer, and the main Donna Karan collection would be suspended. It will not hold a show at New York Fashion Week in September.

Instead, according to an announcement, the company will reorganize its teams and structure to “substantially increase its focus on the DKNY brand,” the company’s more accessible line, which is currently responsible for 80 percent of Donna Karan International revenue. It will also maintain its license business."
Donna Karan steps down as chief designer - The Guardian,"Tue, 30 Jun 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9mYXNoaW9uLzIwMTUvanVsLzAxL2Rvbm5hLWthcmFuLXN0ZXBzLWRvd24tY2hpZWYtZGVzaWduZXItdXJiYW4temVu0gFfaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAudGhlZ3VhcmRpYW4uY29tL2Zhc2hpb24vMjAxNS9qdWwvMDEvZG9ubmEta2FyYW4tc3RlcHMtZG93bi1jaGllZi1kZXNpZ25lci11cmJhbi16ZW4?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Donna Karan will step down from daily duties as chief designer at her namesake company, Donna Karan International, to devote more time to her philanthropic foundation.

She’ll remain a close adviser, according to a company statement released Tuesday.

Karan, 66, co-founded the company in 1984. It went public in 1996. And in 2001, LVMH Moet Hennessey Louis Vuitton invested and helped grow it globally. It now sells apparel, sportswear, accessories and shoes under the Donna Karan New York and DKNY brands.

The company said it will not immediately seek to replace Karan as designer, suspending runway shows and collections for a “period of time.”

Karan, known for helping women streamline their look through basic pieces, expressed gratitude and “my deepest feelings” to colleagues.

“Donna Karan New York is a part of me, past, present and future,” she said in the statement. “It has been an honour to speak woman to woman about seven easy pieces that forever changed the way women dress.”

Reaction was swift as insiders lauded Karan as a visionary, with the Council of Fashion Designers of America tweeting: “The end of an era! Donna Karan departs DKI.”

Karan said she made the decision after much “soul-searching,” adding: “I have arrived at a point in my life where I need to spend more time to pursue my Urban Zen commitment to its fullest potential.”

She was referring to Urban Zen Company and Foundation, a philanthropy that works around the world on health care and education. Urban Zen sells luxury goods in partnership with artisans, with proceeds benefiting projects.

Pierre-Yves Roussel, chairman and CEO of LVMH Fashion Group, called it a privilege to collaborate with Karan and said LVMH was committed to “staying true to the spirit and value Donna has championed” for more than three decades.

Early on, Karan’s seven easy pieces provided a modern system for women with the goal of simplifying their wardrobes without sacrificing elegance or sensuality. With a younger, urban customer in mind, she added DKNY five years after starting the company.

Among numerous accolades, the CFDA has honored her with its lifetime achievement award. Former President Bill Clinton presented her with the Clinton Global Citizen Award."

LVMH sells L'Avenue Shanghai stake - Inside Retail Asia,"Mon, 01 Jun 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vaW5zaWRlcmV0YWlsLmFzaWEvMjAxNS8wNi8wMS9sdm1oLXNlbGxzLWxhdmVudWUtc2hhbmdoYWktc3Rha2Uv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LVMH and Stanley Ho have reportedly sold their stakes in luxury Chinese shopping mall L’Avenue Shanghai to private equity investor Blackstone.

According to Chinese media reports over the weekend, Ho’s STDM business, which owned 50 per cent of the retail and office tower, was dissatisfied with the return on its two year old investment.

Shanghai-based online news service thepaper.cn last week reported the transaction cost exceeded RMB5 billion (US$806 million). The development commenced in 2009 with an estimated value of $500 million. It opened in 2013.

Ho, the Macau gambling tycoon, and L Real Estate, part of the Louis Vuitton Moet Hennessey Group, bought the land on which the development was built, selling it in 2007 and taking a joint interest in the complex.

Some 20 retail tenancies in the shopping part of the complex stock LVMH brands, including Louis Vuitton, Dior and Fendi. But the mainland luxury market has been affected by the government’s clampdown on graft and gift giving.

Neither Blackstone or LVMH Group have confirmed or denied the deal as yet."

Here, we celebrate a few of the many ways Karan shaped American fashion as we know it.

How Donna Karan Made A Difference

She Simplified Our Wardrobes

Donna Karan's signature bodysuits and Seven Easy Pieces concept—which emphasized hero items that could be mixed and matched—put her on the map as a designer in the 1980s and continue to influence minimalist style today.

She Redefined The Diffusion Line

When DKNY launched in 1989, it foreshadowed a huge movement towards fast (and flashy) fashion and a growing emphasis on urban style. Smaller, category-specific labels like DKNY Jeans and DKNY Underwear also thrived, painting a picture for the industry of what a true lifestyle brand could look like.

She Championed Sustainability & Philanthropy

Karan's focus on education, health care and supporting artisans all over the world through her Urban Zen line and foundation created a blueprint for brand philanthropy while also making an incredible difference in the lives of others. (Karan will be focusing on these initiatives full time in her next chapter.)

She Took Red Carpet Glamour To A New Place

When it came to drama on the red carpet, Donna had her own particular position on it. Her gowns were typically body conscious, bold in color and accented by a dramatic train, neckline or waist detail that truly wowed. The concept of Hollywood glamour as we know it was undoubtedly affected by her creations.

She Gave Office Clothes A Powerful Spin

Karen's emphasis on versatility and tailoring in fashion—as well as her laser focus on strong women and urban living—made her a national go-to for workwear clothes for more than three decades. If you're looking for a feminine take on the traditional blazer, pant or shift dress, chances are she's designed (or at least influenced) it.

KU DE TA is now CE LA VI - TODAY,"Thu, 04 Jun 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiO2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRvZGF5b25saW5lLmNvbS9saWZlc3R5bGUva3UtZGUtdGEtbm93LWNlLWxhLXZp0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"SINGAPORE — Say goodbye to KU DE TA and hello to CE LA VI.

L Capital Asia, the Asian private equity business sponsored by French luxury group LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton (LVMH), which owns the majority stake in KU DE TA Singapore, announced today (June 4) the creation of its new entertainment brand CE LA VI at Marina Bay Sands’ SkyPark.

The name is an abbreviation of the French phrase “C’est la vie,” meaning “This is life”.

Its other KU DE TA brands — in Bangkok, which opened in 2013, and in Hong Kong, which was slated to open next month — will also be carrying the CE LA VI name.

This move comes after the Courts of Appeal ruled last week that KU DE TA in Singapore had to stop using the name, which belonged to the eponymous beachfront club in Bali. It follows a court ruling last December, where it was revealed that Nine Squares, the licensor of the KU DE TA trademark in Singapore, did not own the trademark.

But CE LA VI’s chief executive officer Kirk Martin told TODAY plans for the name change had already been in the works even before last year’s court ruling. “When I came on board in April last year, we had already started raising questions such as ‘Who are we? What does our brand mean? Where do we want to take our business?’” he said. “We wanted to raise it to an international brand level, especially with L Capital investing.”

Martin added that the existence of another entity like KU DE TA Bali, which is operating in another location and has different goals, as well as talk of litigation and lawsuits had made it difficult to develop the brand name here.

“Sure, we could make a deal (with KU DE TA Bali) but we made a decision that the best way forward is to have our own name. To build a global brand, we have to own our own destiny. We’re still young enough to build a new brand platform. We were ready — we just had to accelerate the announcement of CE LA VI.”

L Capital Asia has plans for the brand to become “the international titan of lifestyle and sophisticated hedonism” through five core pillars: An iconic rooftop location with a great vista, a modern Asian menu, innovative cocktails, music by top DJs and architectural design inspired by Asia.

According to Martin, when it finally opens, CE LA VI Hong Kong will be the first to showcase the brand’s new architectural design, which will feature more “organic Asian elements” such as stone panels, Javanese pottery, and flora. Renovations for the Singapore branch will begin this month and are expected to be completed in September, in time for the Formula 1 season.

Other CE LA VI outlets are planned for Taipei and Dubai within the next couple of years. And the company has also set its sights at locations in Shanghai, Jakarta, Tokyo and Seoul."
L Capital Asia's Ku De Ta Changes Name to Ce La Vi - Popspoken,"Thu, 04 Jun 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vcG9wc3Bva2VuLmNvbS9ldmVudHMvMjAxNS8wNi9sLWNhcGl0YWwtYXNpYXMta3UtZGUtdGEtY2hhbmdlcy1uYW1lLXRvLWNlLWxhLXZp0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"L Capital Asia’s Ku De Ta, situated at the SkyPark of Singapore’s Marina Bay Sands, has now changed its name to Ce La Vi after a five-year long legal tussle with partners of the Bali beachfront club with the same name.

The iconic restaurant, bar and nightclub, which is owned by L Capital Asia, a private equity business sponsored by LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton (LVMH), had been given two weeks from a Singapore Court of Appeal ruling issued on May 25 to stop using the Ku De Ta name.

L Capital Asia has since changed Ku De Ta’s name to Ce La Vi, as well as announced plans develop it into a luxury lifestyle, dining, and entertainment brand.

Ce La Vi, which is abbreviated from the French phrase “C’est La Vie” (or “This is life”, in English), will also be undergoing a significant renovation this summer to “take customer experience to the next level to further cement its position as the region’s leading dining and entertainment venue.”

The reimagined brand name aims to become “the international titan of lifestyle and sophisticated hedonism” through its iconic rooftop location, organic architectural design, modern Asian culinary inspired dishes, Asian tailored cocktail mixology, as well as a wide range of entertainment from top local and international DJs with their nightly signature parties.

Said Ce La Vi’s Global Marketing Director, Sara Paz: “Ce La Vi will be as good as it gets, with the best of everything. Nothing less will do. Top locations, top cuisine, top mixology, top audio-visuals, top DJs and top entertainment. We define the art of cool, we raise the bar higher, and we will be an ongoing magnet for the jetset and international glitterati.”

The Asian private equity business which owns a sister venue on the rooftop of Sathorn Square in Bangkok, announced that a new outlet will be opened on the top three floors of Hong Kong’s California Tower in July.

They also revealed plans to expand to other key urban cities across the world over the next five years, of which Dubai and Taipei are already in the works.

Louis Vuitton rescues Jones the Grocer brand - Inside Retail Asia,"Mon, 29 Jun 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vaW5zaWRlcmV0YWlsLmFzaWEvMjAxNS8wNi8yOS9sb3Vpcy12dWl0dG9uLXJlc2N1ZXMtam9uZXMtdGhlLWdyb2Nlci1icmFuZC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Louis Vuitton’s private equity arm L Capital Asia has bought the remains of collapsed Singapore gourmet food retailer Jones the Grocer.

The upmarket grocery store was originally founded in Australia, but collapsed last year. It has retail outlets on Dempsey Hill and in Mandarin Gallery.

L Capital Asia had taken a 63 per cent stake in the Singapore arm of the business, Jones the Grocer International, (JTGI), three years ago, believing the brand and concept had strong potential in Asia. But it was placed under judicial management in December.

The Singapore Business Times reported the company had debts of $15 million and a bank balance of $61,000 at the time.

Fresh Bay Investments, a subsidiary of L Capital Asia, has paid S$2.75 million for the brand rights and other assets of the business, but not the debt, potentially angering some suppliers. Singapore news media report L Capital has already acquired the global brand rights from the Australian company which it also has a majority stake in.

Besides its original investment, and last week’s $2.75 million for the shell, Fresh Bay has reportedly ploughed a further $17 million into keeping the business afloat until now.

L Capital Asia managing partner Ravi Thakran told AsiaOne Business that his company knew the Jones the Grocer business best and was therefore the best choice to rebuild the brand."
