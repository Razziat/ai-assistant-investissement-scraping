Sorry Prime Members: Bernard Arnault Says LVMH Products Will Not Be Sold on Amazon - Robb Report,"Wed, 29 Jan 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vcm9iYnJlcG9ydC5jb20vc3R5bGUvZmFzaGlvbi9sdm1oLXdvbnQtYmUtam9pbmluZy1hbWF6b24tYW55dGltZS1zb29uLXNheXMtYmVybmFyZC1hcm5hdWx0LTI4OTU4Nzkv0gFvaHR0cHM6Ly9yb2JicmVwb3J0LmNvbS9zdHlsZS9mYXNoaW9uL2x2bWgtd29udC1iZS1qb2luaW5nLWFtYXpvbi1hbnl0aW1lLXNvb24tc2F5cy1iZXJuYXJkLWFybmF1bHQtMjg5NTg3OS9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"It doesn’t look like Bernard Arnault‘s LVMH will be joining the likes of Amazon any time soon.

During the luxury conglomerate’s annual results conference, the owner of brands ranging from Louis Vuitton to Givenchy confirmed to reporters that he has no intention of working with Amazon on its rumored luxury outfit, according to WWD. The e-commerce giant launched a flurry of headlines when reports leaked that it was working on a luxury concession model that would allow exclusive brands to access its sophisticated data-gathering and shipping technologies.

When it comes to online-only players, Arnault expressed his reservations. “They’re all losing money,” he said. “That’s not a great sign. And the bigger they get, the more money they lose. We’ve been asked several times to participate in these businesses, and I’ve always said no.” LVMH also operates an e-commerce business for its brands (and others) called 24S, which remains unprofitable but small enough so as not to hurt the company’s overall bottom line.

The economics of such an arrangement was not the only issue Arnault took with Amazon. “They use their database to connect customers to sellers and they take a percentage, which leads them…to sell counterfeit products and therefore in a certain way to be linked to organized crime, because the sites that sell counterfeit products are financed by organized crime or even by terrorism,” he said.

Counterfeit goods do indeed have a history of ties to international terrorism and some of the labels under the LVMH umbrella are amongst those most often illegally copied––Louis Vuitton chief among them. Before luxury brands took e-commerce seriously and created their own sites, counterfeiters used Amazon to sell their fakes. Large brands still struggle to keep lookalikes off the market.

WATCH

LVMH is officially the world’s largest luxury goods group and, depending on the day, Arnault’s estimated net worth makes him the world’s richest man—a position frequently held by Amazon’s Jeff Bezos. (As of publication, Arnault’s net worth stood at $107.5 billion while Bezos’ was a robust $115.9 billion.) Arnault’s latest acquisition, Tiffany & Co., is currently integrating into the LVMH fold and stands to pad his bank account for years to come, even more than it already has."
LVMH Names Head of Newly Created Hospitality Division - WWD,"Fri, 31 Jan 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vd3dkLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy1uZXdzL2h1bWFuLXJlc291cmNlcy9sdm1oLW5hbWVzLWFuZHJlYS1ndWVycmEtaGVhZC1vZi1uZXdseS1jcmVhdGVkLWhvc3BpdGFsaXR5LWRpdmlzaW9uLTEyMDM0NTc1ODUv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS — LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton is stepping up its push into experiential luxury by naming Andrea Guerra as chief executive officer of its newly created LVMH Hospitality Excellence division, it said on Friday.

Guerra, formerly ceo of eyewear group Luxottica, will take over on March 16 as head of the entity, which encompasses Hôtels Cheval Blanc and the Belmond Hotels & Luxury Trains. He will be a member of the luxury conglomerate’s executive committee, reporting to LVMH chairman and ceo Bernard Arnault.

Guerra joins LVMH from Italian high-end food emporium Eataly, where he was executive chairman since 2015. Prior to that, he was senior strategic adviser to former Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi.

“Hospitality is a fast-developing market for high-quality experiences, and a formidable opportunity for our group,” Arnault said in a statement. “Andrea’s leadership with large organizations and his expertise in the hospitality sector will allow us to bring our exceptional properties to the next level.”

Olivier Lefebvre will remain ceo of Hôtels Cheval Blanc, while Roeland Vos will stay as chairman and ceo of Belmond.

LVMH’s surprise $2.6 billion acquisition of Belmond last year was aimed at bulking up the group’s hospitality operations globally and position it as much of a leading player in experiential luxury as it is in fashion, leather goods and prestige wines and spirits.

“The future of luxury will be not only in luxury goods, as it’s been for many, many years, but also in luxury experiences, and we want to be in both segments,” Jean-Jacques Guiony, chief financial officer of LVMH, said at the time.

To wit, when the group’s La Samaritaine complex reopens this spring after a 15-year, 750-million-euro renovation, it will include a Cheval Blanc hotel overlooking the Seine river — the first urban location for the exclusive chain known for resort locations like Courchevel and St. Barths."
The risks and rewards of LVMH's renewed interest in sports - Vogue Business,"Fri, 24 Jan 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZvZ3VlYnVzaW5lc3MuY29tL2NvbXBhbmllcy9sdm1oLWludGVyZXN0LWluLXNwb3J0cy1zdGFycy1yaXNrcy1hbmQtcmV3YXJkc9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Athletes often have sponsors that may be partial competitors: Rapinoe, for instance, represents Loewe but is also signed for Nike. And without seeing a specific contract, it is hard to determine how those tensions are managed and what an ambassador is allowed to endorse. At times, however, this can be beneficial for both the brand and the athlete. “For star athletes, having an association with a fashionable luxury brand can also attract lucrative promotional deals with other brands... so there is a win-win relationship if projected in the right way,” says Collard.

Couttigane believes that a deal with Vuitton instead of, say, Nike, has the potential to be bigger in terms of customer awareness and acquisition. “A sports brand like Nike is a natural fit for the NBA, but that also means that brand familiarity for NBA shoppers is already high,” she says. “Conversion is likely to be higher among an audience that does not already organically engage with Louis Vuitton.”

Going mass

Louis Vuitton has a long history of producing trophy cases for events like the America’s Cup and the FIFA World Cup. But broader collaborations offer reach to the wider audience who buy more accessible categories like perfumes and accessories that drive most luxury house profits.

Basketball, by some measures the world’s second-favourite sport, is one of them. “One cannot ignore the huge audience derived from sports culture, nor the loyal following that many major league sports enjoy,” says Couttigane.

“Louis Vuitton is one of the world’s most iconic luxury brands and has been associated with some of the world’s most coveted sports trophies,” says Ralph Rivera, managing director of NBA Europe and Middle East. “This partnership provides fans around the world another unique way to connect with the NBA brand.”

Sportswear is also overtaking traditional fashion in some categories. The NPD Group forecasts that sports shoes will become the largest footwear category in the US by 2020, beating out “fashion” footwear, which includes shoes, boots, sandals and slippers.

“While basketball players no longer drive big sales of their on-the-court shoes, some have said that the trip from the bus to the locker room is the new runway,” says Matt Powell, senior industry advisor of sports at NPD, adding that luxury’s shift to sports presents an opportunity for brands to work with athletes in a different way. “Brands want to showcase their off-the-court styles.”

Political risks

Signing athletes like Rapinoe, who has become a progressive feminist icon, also comes with some risk. Evidence suggests that Western customers reward brands who have a positive message, but that may not be the case in China.

Louis Vuitton, for instance, will have to navigate political tensions between China and the NBA. While the NBA may have been the primary gateway to Chinese consumers for some of its sponsors, Louis Vuitton already has a large presence in the country. “If the Chinese consumer turns on the NBA, Western brands could be pulled into the fight,” says Powell.

“It’s a trade-off that Louis Vuitton may have to make,” says Couttigane. “While a number of Chinese companies have suspended their business deals with the NBA, we have not witnessed the Chinese government banning all brands associated with it. Furthermore... banning a cultural phenomenon often has the effect of making access to it feel more exclusive and desirable.”

So enter LVMH Watch Week. In Dubai.

The new event is set to be an early barometer of the watch industry’s mood as the new decade begins.

The Salon International de la Haute Horlogerie, best known as S.I.H.H., was held at this time of year in Geneva largely as a showcase for Richemont brands like Cartier, Jaeger-LeCoultre and IWC. But now it has been rebranded Watches & Wonders and scheduled to open April 25.

The change will affect not only those brands but also ones that piggybacked on the high-profile event, capitalizing on the gathering of the world’s watch retailers, press and collectors by scheduling their own presentations and launches. Among them were businesses owned by the French luxury giant LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, including TAG Heuer, Hublot and Zenith, which organized what they called Geneva Days, and the LVMH-owned jeweler Bulgari, which invested heavily in its watch division over the last decade."
"A Close Look At LVMH Moët Hennessy - Louis Vuitton, Société Européenne's (EPA:MC) 15% ROCE - Yahoo Finance","Mon, 13 Jan 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQmh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9jbG9zZS1sb29rLWx2bWgtbW8tdC0wNTA5NDY1NTguaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Today we'll evaluate LVMH Moët Hennessy - Louis Vuitton, Société Européenne (EPA:MC) to determine whether it could have potential as an investment idea. To be precise, we'll consider its Return On Capital Employed (ROCE), as that will inform our view of the quality of the business.

Firstly, we'll go over how we calculate ROCE. Next, we'll compare it to others in its industry. Last but not least, we'll look at what impact its current liabilities have on its ROCE.

What is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?

ROCE measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. In general, businesses with a higher ROCE are usually better quality. In brief, it is a useful tool, but it is not without drawbacks. Renowned investment researcher Michael Mauboussin has suggested that a high ROCE can indicate that 'one dollar invested in the company generates value of more than one dollar'.

How Do You Calculate Return On Capital Employed?

The formula for calculating the return on capital employed is:

Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)

Or for LVMH Moët Hennessy - Louis Vuitton Société Européenne:

0.15 = €11b ÷ (€91b - €21b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2019.)

Therefore, LVMH Moët Hennessy - Louis Vuitton Société Européenne has an ROCE of 15%.

Does LVMH Moët Hennessy - Louis Vuitton Société Européenne Have A Good ROCE?

When making comparisons between similar businesses, investors may find ROCE useful. In our analysis, LVMH Moët Hennessy - Louis Vuitton Société Européenne's ROCE is meaningfully higher than the 12% average in the Luxury industry. I think that's good to see, since it implies the company is better than other companies at making the most of its capital. Independently of how LVMH Moët Hennessy - Louis Vuitton Société Européenne compares to its industry, its ROCE in absolute terms appears decent, and the company may be worthy of closer investigation.

The image below shows how LVMH Moët Hennessy - Louis Vuitton Société Européenne's ROCE compares to its industry, and you can click it to see more detail on its past growth.

ENXTPA:MC Past Revenue and Net Income, January 14th 2020

It is important to remember that ROCE shows past performance, and is not necessarily predictive. Companies in cyclical industries can be difficult to understand using ROCE, as returns typically look high during boom times, and low during busts. This is because ROCE only looks at one year, instead of considering returns across a whole cycle. What happens in the future is pretty important for investors, so we have prepared a free report on analyst forecasts for LVMH Moët Hennessy - Louis Vuitton Société Européenne.

What Are Current Liabilities, And How Do They Affect LVMH Moët Hennessy - Louis Vuitton Société Européenne's ROCE?

Liabilities, such as supplier bills and bank overdrafts, are referred to as current liabilities if they need to be paid within 12 months. Due to the way the ROCE equation works, having large bills due in the near term can make it look as though a company has less capital employed, and thus a higher ROCE than usual. To counter this, investors can check if a company has high current liabilities relative to total assets.

LVMH Moët Hennessy - Louis Vuitton Société Européenne has total liabilities of €21b and total assets of €91b. As a result, its current liabilities are equal to approximately 23% of its total assets. A fairly low level of current liabilities is not influencing the ROCE too much.

Our Take On LVMH Moët Hennessy - Louis Vuitton Société Européenne's ROCE

This is good to see, and with a sound ROCE, LVMH Moët Hennessy - Louis Vuitton Société Européenne could be worth a closer look. LVMH Moët Hennessy - Louis Vuitton Société Européenne shapes up well under this analysis, but it is far from the only business delivering excellent numbers .

The fabled jeweler had approached Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A) last year when it was looking for a buyer, sources told The Financial Times this week. The billionaire confirmed to the newspaper that the talk had taken place. But he declined the offer, thinking it was a tad too high.

In late October, LVMH (LVMHF) announced that it had offered to acquire Tiffany in an all-cash deal worth $14.2 billion. Tiffany later pushed LVMH to raise the offer to $16.2 billion and sealed the deal in November. With the takeover, Tiffany will join LVMH’s extensive family of luxury brands including Louis Vuitton, Givenchy, Sephora, Moet & Chandon and others.

Luxury jewelers don’t typically fit Buffett’s bill when it comes to high-profile acquisitions, though his recent track record suggests a growing appetite for the upscale retail sector. (Last year, Berkshire Hathaway purchased $206 million shares of high-end furniture retailer RH, formerly Restoration Hardware.)

Berkshire Hathaway currently owns three jewelry sellers in its industrial- and finance-heavy portfolio: Seattle-based Ben Bridge Jeweler, Helzberg Diamonds and Borsheims Fine Jewelry, which is based in Buffett’s hometown of Omaha, Neb. All three were purchased between 1989 and 2000.

Buffetts owns a small stake in Tiffany as its creditor. In 2009, subsidiaries owned by Berkshire Hathaway bought $250 million worth of the jeweler’s debt.

As of the third quarter last year, Berkshire Hathaway had a record $128 billion of cash on its balance sheet. Industry observers are anxiously watching what Buffett plans to do with that money.

In November, Buffett backed out of a bidding war to acquire software and IT service distributor Tech Data Corp. His last major acquisition was Precision Castparts for $32 billion in 2015."
Bernard Arnault: France's 'wolf-in-cashmere' billionaire - FRANCE 24 English,"Wed, 22 Jan 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZyYW5jZTI0LmNvbS9lbi8yMDIwMDEyMi1iZXJuYXJkLWFybmF1bHQtZnJhbmNlLXMtd29sZi1pbi1jYXNobWVyZS1iaWxsaW9uYWlyZdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"On Friday, French luxury goods magnate Bernard Arnault briefly toppled Amazon’s Jeff Bezos to become the richest person in the world. Now relegated back to second wealthiest in the world, Arnault remains the richest person in Europe.

Arnault lasted just a couple of days at the top before Bezos recovered his regular position. But this was the second time in recent months that Arnault has borrowed the crown.

2019 was a good year for Arnault. The CEO of the LVMH group (Louis Vuitton Moet Hennessy) earned an estimated profit of €35.1 billion over the course of the year. This breaks down as €4,020,307 every hour, or €66,700 a minute. He is one of only three people ever to make it into the exclusive centi-billionaires club, along with Bezos and Bill Gates.

Arnault first dethroned Bezos on December 16, 2019. This triumph lasted even shorter, less than five hours, before Bezos returned to the top. It occurred after LVMH acquired luxury jewelry company Tiffany, causing their stocks to rise.

‘Fascination for Dior’

Arnault’s story is not exactly rags-to-riches, but it does reveal a man driven by ambition who built his own empire.

He was born Bernard Jean Étienne Arnault on March 5, 1949 in the French city of Roubaix, near the Belgian border.

His father Jean Léon Arnault was a manufacturer and the owner of the civil engineering company, Ferret-Savinel.

His mother Marie Josèphe Savinel made two major contributions to her son’s future. She made him take piano lessons and she had a “fascination for Dior”, according to her son in an interview with the Financial Times, who said she wore its Diorissimo scent. She could not have known that her son would eventually own Dior.

Arnault still plays the piano, which remains one of his major hobbies, along with tennis. Indeed, the piano played a central role in his second marriage. He is said to have wooed Canadian concert pianist Hélène Mercier with his own performance of etudes by composer Chopin.

He graduated in 1971 from the École Polytechnique, France’s most prestigious engineering school whose alumni include three Nobel laureates, Carlos Ghosn and former president Valéry Giscard d’Estaing. Having qualified as an engineer, he joined his father's company.

He married his first wife Anne Dewavrin in 1973 and they had two children, a daughter Delphine and a son Antoine. Delphine is widely considered to be her father’s natural successor and is currently executive vice president of Louis Vuitton.

Arnault proved his business acumen in 1976 when he persuaded his father to sell off the construction side of the business and focus instead on real estate. Arnault succeeded his father as president of this new company called Ferinel, specialising in holiday accommodation.

He moved his young family to America in 1981, in an open reaction to the rise of the French Socialists and their determination to tax the rich. He spent three years in the United States, growing his family’s property business.

‘The wolf in cashmere’

Upon his return to France in 1983, he made a crucial business move. He identified a golden opportunity to expand into the textile industry when the landmark firm Boussac went bankrupt.

The French government, under then president Mitterand, was looking for someone to rescue Boussac, an empire that comprised a number of floundering businesses, including Dior.

Arnault’s eye was firmly fixed on this couture prize. He wanted Dior. He proceeded to sell off much of the other operations under the Boussac name, keeping only a few including Dior. He now owns 96.5 percent of Dior.

By this time, top-end luxury goods brands Moet Hennessy and Louis Vuitton had merged to form LVMH. Arnault started investing in this golden egg in 1987. He soon became its biggest shareholder.

Then began one of the fiercest battles in French fashion as Arnault fought to oust first the former chairman Henry Racamier and then many of the top executives. He gained a reputation then for ruthlessness, along with the nickname ‘the wolf in cashmere’.

Having mercilessly filleted the company of many of its loyal servants – and acquiring many newly unemployed enemies in the north of France - Arnault proceeded to make a series of brilliant business decisions. He wanted to expand, but only with the best. He set about bringing some of the top labels in the world into the LVMH fold.

The company’s portfolio now features 75 brands, including fashion houses Christian Lacroix, Celine, Givenchy, Fendi, Marc Jacobs and Dior. It also involves wines and spirits, including champagne brand Dom Pérignon, cognac makers Hennessy, Glenmorangie Scottish whisky and New Zealand winemakers Cloudy Bay.

There is jewelry with Bulgari and watches with Tag Heuer, along with beauty chainstore Sephora.

The group extends to the famous Hotel Cipriani in Venice, a range of top hotels with Michelin starred restaurants called Cheval Blanc in Courchevel in the French Alps and the historic Paris department store Le Bon Marche.

Arnault himself own properties across the world and a private island in the Bahamas.

No sign of slowing down

With all this, 70-year old Arnault and his LVMH domain show no signs of slowing down. Their latest major acquisition was last November, when they agreed to buy luxury jeweler Tiffany for approximately €14.7 billion.

Forbes has described Arnault as ‘one of the world’s ultimate tastemakers’.

Arnault has not always been an entirely loyal servant to France. He controversially tried – and failed – to get Belgian nationality when France’s 2012 budget looked set to severely tax the wealthy.

The French government had changed hands, Nicholas Sarkozy was out and François Hollande was in. This resounded deeply as Arnault was part of Sarkozy’s inner circle; he had even been a witness at Sarkozy’s wedding in 1996. Arnault’s attempt to become Belgian did, however, serve to undermine his famously patriotic approach to business.

Along with being an incredibly successful businessman and investor, Arnault is also a passionate and savvy art collector. His first purchase at an art auction was an early 20th-century depiction of Charing Cross Bridge by Claude Monet. He now owns work by Jean-Michel Basquiat, Damien Hirst, Maurizio Cattelan, Andy Warhol and Pablo Picasso.

Arnault is also the visionary behind the Louis Vuitton Foundation. Designed by American architect Frank Gehry, this iconic contemporary art museum was described as a “cloud of glass” when it opened in 2014. It soon found a place in the elite global art landscape as one of the most important galleries in Europe.

The key to his business method is timing. As he said himself, “I think in business, you have to learn to be patient. Maybe I’m not very patient myself. But I think that I’ve learned the most is be able to wait for something and get it when it’s the right time.”

Ex-LVMH boss on why Buffett passed on Tiffany: 'They need to polish up the diamond' - Yahoo Finance,"Sat, 04 Jan 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9leC1sdm1ocy1wYXVsaW5lLWJyb3duLXRpZmZhbnktbmVlZHMtdG8tcG9saXNoLXVwLXRoZS1kaWFtb25kLTEzMDAxMjMzMy5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Warren Buffett isn’t looking to add something shiny to his portfolio.

The Oracle of Omaha reportedly turned down a chance to buy Tiffany & Co., (TIF), according to the Financial Times, after the luxury jeweler received a takeover bid from LVMH (LVMUY) for $16.2 billion in November.

Pauline Brown has an idea why Buffett passed on the chance. LVMH’s ex-chairman of North America recently told Yahoo Finance that Buffett’s decline says more about the legendary investor’s comfort zone than it does about LVMH.

Lauding the Oracle’s penchant for “very good, solid lasting brands,” Brown suggested on “YFi PM” in an interview this week that “Tiffany is not a classic Buffett investment, for one, because of its turnaround.”

The luxury company has “been underperforming for the last couple of years. There's a lot of new initiatives, some of which only time will tell if they're working,” Brown added.

Tiffany’s sales and profits have been struggling over the past few years as the luxury brand continues to struggle to appeal to the younger generations.

“Tiffany hasn't done enough to make it relevant and interesting in the last few years,” Brown stated. “I do expect, from a product design and development, that there'll be a lot of innovation that we haven't seen coming out of that company in a long time,” she said.

“It has lost its luster within the segment, which has otherwise been very healthy. The segment of luxury has been healthy. This is true. They need to polish up the diamond,” she said.

Meanwhile, Buffett took a pass because — as his investment history shows, “he looks for steadiness,” Brown continued. “He looks for a depth of company and, frankly, a global presence that I don't think represents Tiffany.”

LVMH’s all-cash acquisition of Tiffany, announced in November, is the biggest deal under the Louis Vuitton parent. Before accepting the $16.2 billion buyout, Tiffany declined a $14.5 billion from LVMH, arguing that deal significantly undermined the brand.

Story continues

Brown called the price LVMH’s is paying “healthy” given where Tiffany’s stock was trading.

“On the one hand, the premium over where it was trading before is significant. On the other hand, the premium over where it was trading just a year before that deal was announced, it was actually low,” she told Yahoo Finance.

“The offer price was below where it was trading a year ago. So the company had sunk pretty far,” she said. “And, again, I think the bigger issue for Buffett is the volatility than the actual price.”

In order for the high-end jeweler to reinvigorate its brand, LVMH may shake up the management team, Brown said — which will help the company “back to what made the brand great 10, 20, 30 years ago. So I would expect there'll be a lot of changes, but not so much in LVMH setting the strategy as in getting a team in place that can really rebuild what was.”

LVMH Appoints New Environmental Development Director - WWD,"Tue, 07 Jan 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiQFodHRwczovL3d3ZC5jb20vYnVzaW5lc3MtbmV3cy9odW1hbi1yZXNvdXJjZXMvbHZtaC1uYW1lcy1uZXctZW52aXJvbm1lbnRhbC1kZXZlbG9wbWVudC1kaXJlY3Rvci1oZWxlbmUtdmFsYWRlLWFudG9pbmUtYXJuYXVsdC0xMjAzNDE0MzM1L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS — In a sign that it is ramping up its commitment to sustainability, LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton has named Hélène Valade its new environmental development director, effective this week.

Valade reports to Antoine Arnault, who will now oversee the environmental department in addition to his roles as head of communications and image for the group, chief executive officer of Berluti and chairman of Loro Piana.

“Respect for the environment is an essential subject for the group. It’s one of our priorities for the coming years and it was important for a member of the family to be in this role and to represent that commitment,” Arnault told WWD.

Valade succeeds Sylvie Bénard, who served as LVMH environment director for 26 years and will retire later this year. In that role, she oversaw the creation in 1992 of LVMH’s environmental division, which until now has been overseen by group managing director Antonio Belloni.

Valade joins the luxury group from French water and waste group Suez, where she was director of sustainable development since 2014. Since 2018, the executive has also been president of the ORSE corporate social responsibility network, as well as a member of the board of directors of French environmental protection agency ADEME.

The two women will work together to ensure a smooth transition, LVMH said. One of Valade’s major objectives will be setting out the group’s “LIFE 2030” roadmap of environmental targets for the next decade.

The LVMH Initiatives for the Environment (LIFE) program, launched in 2012, covers every step from product design to retail operations and is now a required component in the strategic plans of all LVMH brands, which include Louis Vuitton, Dior, Fendi, Sephora, Guerlain, Bulgari and Dom Pérignon.

In his traditional New Year’s wishes to the group’s top executives and staff, Bernard Arnault, chairman and chief executive officer of LVMH, on Monday said the company was adding a fourth pillar to its fundamental values of creativity, excellence and entrepreneurial spirit: a commitment to solidarity, diversity and environmental excellence.

Antoine Arnault, the luxury titan’s son, was a pivotal figure in LVMH’s decision last year to buy a minority stake in Stella McCartney‘s namesake label and appoint the British designer, known for her environmental campaigning, as special adviser to Bernard Arnault and executive committee members.

The group also named Yann Arthus-Bertrand, a photographer and director known for raising public awareness of environmental issues, as an advisory board member, and engaged Ismaël Emelien, a former special adviser to French President Emmanuel Macron, as a consultant on green topics.

Antoine Arnault said the group was approaching its environmental ambitions with humility and determination.

“I don’t pretend to be a sort of big priest on the environment. I’m familiarizing myself with this world. I will endeavor to gather information and understand what is at stake for a big group like ours, so it’s going to take some time,” he said.

“I want us to continue to strive to be exemplary in this field. I know we’re not perfect, so it will require a bit of patience. But I’d rather take the time to understand the issues and then take action, rather than make announcements on actions that might be meaningless or so far-off that they can’t be quantified,” Arnault added.

At an event during Paris Fashion Week in September dubbed “Future Life,” LVMH said it was launching a raw materials sourcing charter for animal products such as fur and leather. But the event was overshadowed by Bernard Arnault’s comments criticizing climate activist Greta Thunberg for being too “pessimistic.”

At the time, Antoine Arnault explained why LVMH declined to sign the “Fashion Pact” spearheaded by rival French luxury group Kering at Macron’s request. He said it did not make sense for the group to be lumped together with fast-fashion and sportswear brands such as Inditex, H&M and Nike.

Speaking to WWD on Wednesday, he indicated LVMH would continue to move at its own pace. “Every decision we make has a domino effect on the environment, whether positive or negative. We can’t take this kind of decision lightly,” he said."
"A double hit for LVMH from virus, Hong Kong protests? Hold on - South China Morning Post","Wed, 29 Jan 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjbXAuY29tL2xpZmVzdHlsZS9mYXNoaW9uLWJlYXV0eS9hcnRpY2xlLzMwNDc5OTgvbHV4dXJ5LWdyb3VwLWx2bWhzLWhvbmcta29uZy1zYWxlcy1kcm9wLTQwLWNlbnQtZm91cnRo0gF0aHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAuc2NtcC5jb20vbGlmZXN0eWxlL2Zhc2hpb24tYmVhdXR5L2FydGljbGUvMzA0Nzk5OC9sdXh1cnktZ3JvdXAtbHZtaHMtaG9uZy1rb25nLXNhbGVzLWRyb3AtNDAtY2VudC1mb3VydGg?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LVMH posted record revenue and profit for the whole of 2019. It said in a statement that fourth quarter sales rose 12 per cent to €15.27 billion (US$16.94 billion).

The company, which owns labels including Louis Vuitton and Christian Dior, said the new coronavirus outbreak this month forced it to close some stores in the Chinese city of Wuhan, the epicentre of the outbreak but it believed the peak of the virus would pass in a few weeks, limiting the impact on sales.

Sales growth at luxury goods group LVMH slowed slightly in the fourth quarter, pushed down in part by a sharp drop in revenue in Hong Kong, where months of violent protests have scared away many high-end shoppers.

That marked an 8 per cent increase year-on-year on a like-for-like basis, which strips out currency swings and acquisitions, and compared with forecasts cited by analysts and Reuters estimates of closer to 9 per cent growth.

But it was less strong when set against like-for-like sales in the previous three months, which had grown 11 per cent.

Speaking after the results were announced, LVMH chief financial officer Jean-Jacques Guiony said that revenue in Hong Kong was down around 40 per cent in the fourth quarter.

If it dies out in two months or two months and a half, it’s not terrible. If it takes two years, that’s a different story Bernard Arnault, LVMH CEO, on the coronavirus outbreak

LVMH said, though, that it managed to offset some of the pain through a strong performance at its stores in mainland China.

Hong Kong is a key market for luxury firms. Some of them have had to close stores during street protests against the Beijing-backed government.

LVMH said the group’s sales growth would have kept pace in the fourth quarter were it not for one-off factors. It cited a tax hike in Japan which had led clients to bring forward purchases to the third quarter, and cognac stock shortages in the last three months of the year.

Investors are fretting about the impact of the new coronavirus on China, the world’s second-biggest economy, amid travel bans and a Lunar New Year holiday that has been extended by the authorities to try to limit the spread of infection.

Asked for his projections, LVMH boss Bernard Arnault said it was too early to say how the virus would evolve.

“The first reaction is: ‘Don’t panic, let’s calmly analyse the situation’,” he said.

Citing information passed to him from Chinese authorities, he said it seemed the peak of the virus should pass within weeks and it should peter out by the end of March. He also said the Chinese official response to the outbreak seemed robust.

“That’s the information we have,” Arnault said. “If it dies out in two months or two months and a half, it’s not terrible. If it takes two years, that’s a different story.”

In LVMH’s core fashion and handbags division, home to Louis Vuitton and other big brands such as Christian Dior, sales held up well in the quarter, expanding 15 per cent on a like-for-like basis. That was in line or a touch above some analysts’ forecasts."

Shandong Ruyi, the company touted as the potential LVMH of China, is in trouble.

In an effort to transform itself into a global fashion conglomerate, the company went on a three-year overseas spending spree starting in 2016. It acquired French group Sandro, Maje & Claudie Pierlot (SMCP), Swiss shoemaker Bally and British brands Aquascutum, TM Lewin and Gieves & Hawkes. Most recently, a deal to purchase the Lycra company for over $2 billion was completed in January 2019.

These purchases saddled the company with debt: As of June 2019, Shandong Ruyi’s debt load was RMB 34.1 billion (£3.6 billion), more than triple what it was in 2013. This growing burden has also restricted its cash flow — a pressing problem as the Chinese economy has slowed down, and liquidity becomes harder to come by. Defaults have become a regular occurrence in the Eastern Shandong region where Ruyi is based, and the credit arrangements of companies there are known to be closely interlocked. A missed payment by a corn oil and steel processor in the region in early December sparked fear of contagion and led to selloffs in Ruyi’s dollar bonds.

These factors culminated in December in debt rating agency Moody’s downgrading Shandong Ruyi’s corporate rating. The new rating reflects its “heightened refinancing risk, given its large upcoming debt maturities, continued weak liquidity and limited progress on its refinancing plans”, according to the firm. S&P also reduced its rating to CCC+, which indicates a high risk or “junk” bond, in mid-November, but Ruyi recently requested that the opinion be withdrawn.

Ruyi defied the expectations of some investors by managing to repay $357 million due last month on a maturing dollar bond. However, analysts remain concerned about a number of approaching debt repayment deadlines as the textiles firm looks for help to meet its obligations.

Moody’s says that Ruyi’s current cash reserves and cash flow, forecast to be RMB 10.6 billion over 2020, will not be enough to cover RMB 16.6 billion worth of obligations over the same period. The company made efforts to dispose of some of its assets in the runup to December’s debt repayment, with the backing of the group’s second-largest shareholder, local-government owned company Jining City Urban Construction Investment, also thought to be crucial in hitting the target."

The Dealmaking That Brought Tiffany to LVMH - WWD,"Wed, 29 Jan 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3dkLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy1uZXdzL2ZpbmFuY2lhbC90aWZmYW55LWx2bWgtYmVybmFyZC1hcm5hdWx0LWRlYWxtYWtpbmctMTYtMi1iaWxsaW9uLWdvbGRtYW4tc2FjaHMtMTIwMzQ1NTA2MS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"When Tiffany & Co. shareholders gather one last time on Tuesday to sign off on the company’s $16.2 billion sale to LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, it will be an ending, a beginning and, for some key executives, a very big pay day.

The 183-year-old New York retailer — which has its very own blue, has tried to own the concept of love through its engagement business and touts its star turn in “Breakfast at Tiffany’s” — will next week give up life as an independent company. But its port in the retail storm is a good one and under the umbrella of LVMH and the watchful eye of its chief Bernard Arnault, the American jeweler can start to craft a new and potentially much-higher profile image.

The acquisition — the largest luxury deal in Arnault’s long and storied career of luxury consolidation — is the result of a whirlwind six-week autumn courtship, details of which have been laid out in filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

It was a dance that included a high-powered working lunch, long weekends, an army of bankers, a call directly from Arnault to Tiffany’s banker, Goldman Sachs, and an effort to gin up competition from four other would-be buyers. According to sources and media reports, the list included luxury competitor Compagnie Financière Richemont and Berkshire Hathaway investing titan Warren Buffett.

LVMH repeatedly sought to press its advantage, noting, once word of the talks got out, that Tiffany’s newly elevated stock price would take a hit if news of weaker quarterly results were revealed. But the luxury giant raised its buying price as Tiffany chairman Roger Farah negotiated and the two sides found a deal they could both sign.

The result is a corporate transformation that could help the careers of many Tiffany employees since LVMH, which owns Bulgari, Hublot, Louis Vuitton, Rimowa and many more, is known for shifting executives between its various units.

More immediately, the deal will lead to big payouts to Tiffany’s top executives, who will see their stock and option awards, which were intended to vest over years, become payable all at once — and at the $135-a-share purchase price of the deal.

Chief executive officer Alessandro Bogliolo’s various stock options alone will result in a $35.7 million payment, while executive vice president and chief financial officer Mark Erceg’s option take will total $16.5 million and executive vice president-global sales Philippe Galtié will see $12.1 million.

And if they lost their job because of the acquisition, they would receive golden parachute cash payments as well (Bogliolo’s would be the largest at $8.4 million).

Meanwhile, while not named in the SEC filings, it is understood the brand’s chief artistic officer Reed Krakoff will receive a package commensurate with that of the highest-paid senior executives.

Sneaking in under the wire was Daniella Vitale, who was named chief brand officer on Nov. 20 — just four days before the deal was signed — and received a total of 25,170 restricted stock units, which will translate into a pay day of $3.4 million after just over two months on the job. Vitale joined Tiffany only weeks after a whirlwind tour of the globe trying to find a buyer for the bankrupt Barneys New York. But the efforts ultimately came up short as the retailer was sold to licensing specialty Authentic Brands Group.



But all of those millions — which will ultimately come from the coffers of LVMH — are hardly a rounding error in a deal that brings the luxury giant to the U.S. on a major new front and promises to remake the competitive landscape in jewelry.

Tiffany’s temporary flagship in New York. GEORGE CHINSEE

LVMH had been considering a possible run at Tiffany for some time, but the negotiations started finally on Oct. 15 and over lunch.

Antonio Belloni, group managing director of LVMH, invited Tiffany’s Bogliolo to lunch. And while Belloni did not lay out an agenda, he came prepared with a proposal to buy the jeweler at $120 a share, or about $14.5 billion. Afterward, Belloni reached out to Tiffany’s chairman, Farah, and informed him of the offer as well.

Tiffany’s stock closed that day at $91.04, but behind the scenes the wheels were in motion and LVMH had given the company eight days to respond.

The board met the next day and started the process to line up advisers, including Goldman Sachs and Centerview, and Francesco Trapani, a director at Tiffany who once served as a senior adviser to Arnault, recused himself from the proceedings. (Trapani also led LVMH’s watch and jewelry division as chairman and ceo from 2011 to 2014).

By the 18th, Farah replied to LVMH, letting the company know that the offer was being considered that he would be their point of contact.

That essentially put Farah, a well-respected fashion veteran and who was once a top executive at Ralph Lauren Corp., across the negotiating from Arnault.

The following days were filled with activity, the board’s finance committee met, Farah reached out to Goldman Sachs, LVMH agreed to keep the negotiations quiet, Sullivan & Cromwell was hired as legal counsel.

By the 26th, Farah told the board that LVMH was asking for “encouragement” of some kind or that it would withdraw the offer. The board asked management to put together a multiyear plan to get an up-to-date read on the company’s stand-alone prospects.

And the cat was out of the bag, as press reports revealed the deal.

On the 28th, nearly two weeks after the first approach, the two sides issued press releases confirming the talks, with Tiffany noting it was working with Goldman Sachs.

That prompted Arnault to step into the process himself that day.

“A representative of Goldman Sachs received a call from Mr. Arnault,” according to a Tiffany SEC filing. “Mr. Arnault indicated that he would be available to speak with representatives of the company at any point during the process, if appropriate.”

On Nov. 3, Tiffany’s management reported to the board and said its own projections for the company’s annual results were “less robust” than “assumed by Wall Street analyst consensus estimates,” which did not fully take into account protests in Hong Kong, worsening U.S.-China trade relations, the Yellow Vest movement in Paris and a slowdown in Chinese tourism.

That no doubt weakened the hand of Farah, but he contacted Belloni the next day and rejected LVMH’s $120 a share offer.

Over the next couple weeks, Farah “reached out informally in ordinary course investment banking coverage discussions to four potential alternative bidders that they believed were most likely to be interested in an acquisition of the company…. All four parties indicated that they did not have any interest in acquiring the company at this time for a price in excess of the price contemplated by the $120 proposal.”

During this time, Belloni offered $125 a share if LVMH could take a closer look at Tiffany’s books and was rebuffed by Farah.

“Mr. Belloni informed Mr. Farah that [LVMH] could be required to issue external communications regarding a proposal to acquire the company and that [LVMH] could delay further communication with the company about a potential acquisition…until after the company’s earnings release on Dec. 5, 2019, in anticipation of potential negative results being released on such date and the consequential impact on the company’s stock price,” the Tiffany filings said.

But a few days later, Belloni offered $130 a share and ultimately gained access to Tiffany’s books to conduct due diligence.

On the 20th, Bogliolo and Erceg made a presentation to LVMH detailing Tiffany’s “business, operations and financial information.”

Farah met with Belloni the next day.

Belloni said LVMH could withdraw its $130-per-share offer and “reevaluate at a later date, at which point the company’s stock price could have decreased from its then-current price,” the filing said.

Tiffany’s financial advisers at Centerview then met with bankers at Citi, representing LVMH, in a negotiating session where the per-share price went to $131 and then $133 and finally $135, but “only if Mr. Farah could assure [LVMH] that a deal would be agreed at that price.”

Farah said he was willing to advocate for a deal at $135 a share and would call a board meeting.

The vote was unanimous.

Now, Arnault’s big deal goes to Tiffany shareholders, who are expected to give it the thumb’s up."
Arnault Takes Shot at Amazon — and Others — Over Fakes - WWD,"Tue, 28 Jan 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3dkLmNvbS9mZWF0dXJlL2x2bWgtcG9pc2VkLXRvLXRhY2tsZS1hbWF6b24tYW5kLW90aGVyLW9ubGluZS1yZXRhaWxlcnMtb3Zlci1jb3VudGVyZmVpdC1nb29kcy0xMjAzNDU1MjU4L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS — Fresh off another year of record results for LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, Bernard Arnault said Tuesday he plans to step up the battle against the sale of counterfeit goods online, dealing a potential blow to Amazon’s ambitions in the luxury space.

The chairman and chief executive officer of the luxury conglomerate, who in recent weeks has several times briefly surpassed Amazon ceo Jeff Bezos as the world’s wealthiest man on Forbes’ real-time Billionaires List, expressed skepticism about online pure players and accused them of profiting from the sale of fakes.

“They’re all losing money. That’s not a great sign. And the bigger they get, the more money they lose. We’ve been asked several times to participate in these businesses, and I’ve always said no,” Arnault told reporters and analysts at LVMH’s annual results press conference here.

“We created a relatively small [e-commerce] site called 24S, which unfortunately is no exception to the rule. It’s also losing money, but it’s not losing a lot because it’s small. We’re growing it modestly. We hope to find a way to make it profitable, but for the time being, we haven’t. We shall see,” he continued.

Arnault added that online sales at beauty retailer Sephora, on the other hand, were “very profitable.”

But he indicated that LVMH would not allow its products to be carried on Amazon, which, according to industry sources is preparing to launch a luxury proposition in the first half, a digital shopping platform with big-name brands operating concessions similar to those in high-end specialty stores.

Arnault noted that Amazon’s profits are driven by marketplace sellers.

“They use their database to connect customers to sellers and they take a percentage, which leads them — and we’re going to try to fight this on their site and on others — to sell counterfeit products and therefore in a certain way to be linked to organized crime, because the sites that sell counterfeit products are financed by organized crime or even by terrorism,” he said.

“Is it normal for prestigious, highly successful global sites to make money by being associated with organized crime? I don’t know what you think, but it’s a bit shocking, so I think there is a lot to do in this domain if you want to limit the sale of counterfeit products,” Arnault added, without elaborating.

The executive made the comments after LVMH, the world’s biggest luxury group, reported that revenues broke through the symbolic barrier of 50 billion euros in 2019, rising 15 percent to 53.7 billion euros, with healthy growth in all regions, despite violent protests in Hong Kong in the second half of the year.

Profit from recurring operations totaled 11.50 billion euros, up 15 percent, setting a new record for the group. Net profit rose 13 percent to 7.17 billion euros, LVMH said in a statement published after the market close on Tuesday.

After rising 65 percent in 2019, LVMH shares have fallen 6.2 percent since Jan. 17, amid fears the coronavirus outbreak in China will hurt tourism and shopping. Arnault said it was impossible to predict its impact on sales, indicating that his teams in China have suggested the epidemic will peak in the next few weeks.

“If it’s resolved within the next two, two-and-a-half months, it won’t be terrible. If it lasts for two years, that’s another story,” he said.

Overall, he was bullish on prospects for 2020, despite his by-now customary warning that a major global economic crisis will occur within the next few years. “This year should remain positive on the macroeconomic front,” Arnault said. “The month of January got off to a very good start.”

Stock markets worldwide have tumbled on concerns that consumer spending in China will decline as more people stay home over the Lunar New Year due to the coronavirus. Chief financial officer Jean-Jacques Guiony said LVMH had closed its stores in Wuhan, where the outbreak started, and was waiting for further directives.

“The question is not whether it will have an impact, it’s how long it will last. We haven’t the slightest idea, but of course, it will have a bit of an impact in the short term,” he said.

“You’ve seen that a lot of things have been canceled in China. Obviously it’s not very good for the business, although a big chunk of the business we do with Chinese New Year is gifting, so gifting is less affected by the measures that have been implemented in China — but it’s way too early to discuss,” Guiony added.

LVMH reported sales rose 12 percent in the fourth quarter, boosted by another strong performance in its key fashion and leather goods division, despite a 40 percent drop in business in Hong Kong as tourism plummeted in response to eight months of violent antigovernment protests.

Guiony said reports that LVMH planned to shut one of its stores in Hong Kong were incorrect. “It was a negotiation. We threatened to close a store in order to obtain better terms and this leaked out. That’s all, but the intention has never been to close a store,” he said.

He was confident in the long-term prospects for Hong Kong, which he said accounted for 5 percent of LVMH’s overall revenues. “It’s a touristic destination for many people in the area and it will remain so. It is very cyclical for various reasons. We’ve seen worse situations in the past. It will come back,” Guiony said.

Group revenues in the three months ended Dec. 31 totaled 15.27 billion euros, up 8 percent on an organic basis, slightly below the 11 percent growth rate recorded in the third quarter. Analysts polled by Bloomberg had banked on an 8.7 percent increase in like-for-like sales.

LVMH blamed the slight decrease on one-off effects linked to a hike in Japan’s consumption tax, and variations in cognac inventories in the U.S. Stripped of these non-recurring events, organic growth would have been stable at 9.5 percent in the third and fourth quarters, Guiony said.

Sales were driven by the group’s largest business, fashion and leather goods, home to brands including Louis Vuitton, Dior, Fendi and Celine. The division posted revenues of 6.36 billion euros, up 15 percent on an organic basis, slightly below consensus estimates of a 15.5 percent increase.

Fashion and leather goods grew 17 percent in 2019 as a whole, on top of a high comparison base, with profit from recurring operations jumping 24 percent, Guiony noted.

Arnault touted another banner year for Vuitton, which has continued to diversify its product ranges. He pointed to the brand’s acquisition of a 1,758-carat diamond from Botswana as a signal of its ambitions, saying the stone would travel to Taiwan after being unveiled at Vuitton’s flagship on Place Vendôme during Paris Couture Week.

He said Dior had recorded “very substantial” growth, with the opening in July of its new temporary store on the Avenue des Champs-Elysées in Paris while its flagship on Avenue Montaigne undergoes renovations. Arnault also cited “remarkable” growth at Loewe and good performances at Berluti, Loro Piana and Rimowa.

He noted that while Rihanna’s fashion business was still “very small,” it was only just getting started. “She has lots of ideas. I’m sure we’re going to do very interesting things,” he said. Arnault also noted “improvements” at Celine and Marc Jacobs, though he declined to provide further details.

Meanwhile, he indicated LVMH has no plans to get rid of the John Galliano brand, even though it no longer produces collections and has closed its last store, located in the Marais district of Paris. “It’s not losing any money. We’re waiting to see how it evolves,” he said.

LVMH’s perfumes and cosmetics division clocked 12 percent growth on an organic basis to 1.92 billion euros in the fourth quarter. Profitability was hit by a depreciation of stocks at several smaller American brands during the quarter, Guiony said.

Arnault said Dior’s Sauvage was the number-one men’s fragrance worldwide, while Rouge Dior was the top lipstick, with one sold every second. He even promoted the benefits of Dior’s latest Capture serum. “I tried it myself. I can guarantee you that it’s very effective,” he said.

Wines and spirits posted 1.65 billion euros in sales in the fourth quarter, a 3 percent rise. Watches and jewelry, and selective retailing, which includes Sephora and duty-free stores DFS, both registered organic growth of 1 percent, to 1.14 billion euros and 4.23 billion euros, respectively.

Arnault indicated that Bulgari would provide a blueprint for LVMH’s $16.2 billion acquisition of Tiffany & Co., expected to close in the middle of 2020.

“Since we bought Bulgari, we have multiplied revenues by a little more than two and operating profit by a little more than five. So given that we will soon acquire Tiffany, that’s the target we’re setting for our Tiffany teams. It took us 10 years, so this won’t happen overnight. If we can do that, I think we’ll have made a good acquisition,” Arnault said of the deal, the biggest ever in the luxury sector.

The industry bellwether’s quarterly sales figures come before other luxury rivals Kering, due to publish figures on Feb. 12, and Hermès on Feb. 26. Compagnie Financière Richemont reports annual results on May 15.

Piral Dadhania, analyst at RBC Capital Markets, said it remained positive on the stock in the midterm. “We view LVMH as better insulated than other luxury peers given its lower-than-average exposure to the Chinese consumer, more diversified geographical mix and its nonluxury business units,” he said in a research note."
LVMH's 'hacks' for luxury innovation - Financial Times,"Tue, 07 Jan 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZ0LmNvbS9jb250ZW50LzY3NzM0MzhhLTIwYzgtMTFlYS05MmRhLWYwYzkyZTk1N2E5NtIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Print this page

In the pristine white reception of LVMH House in the chichi surroundings of London’s Mayfair, an assistant was on the phone urgently sourcing caviar.

Upstairs, the atmosphere was rather less intense, despite a competition taking place on various floors. Over the course of four days, 60 participants from across the luxury goods group — which includes fashion, cosmetics, wines and spirits companies, as well as travel — were divided into 12 teams to pitch their ideas to senior executives, for a chance to see their proposal made into reality.

Prior to the competition, these employees had never met, and came from the Middle East, Europe and Africa. And being a luxury goods group, platters of fruit were laid out for sustenance, as well as the option to have a massage.

This was the Disrupt, Act, Risk to be an Entrepreneur (Dare) initiative, a rolling programme launched in 2017 to find innovative ideas and uncover talent across the sprawling group. So far seven events have taken place — four in Europe, and one in Shanghai, Tokyo and New York. Two more are planned for this year.

The challenge for this latest competition was to “reinvent the customer experience for tomorrow”. Previous themes have included the future of luxury, sustainability and gender equality.

Chantal Gaemperle, who oversees human resources at LVMH and pioneered Dare, says since she joined 13 years ago, the workforce has grown from 60,000 to almost 160,000, across 75 houses. “In a group of [so many] people how do you find the talents? Sometimes the best are far away from you. People rise to the occasion [and] gain maturity through presenting their ideas . . . coached by CEOs.”

The skills required by LVMH have changed too, she says. Today she recruits not just from luxury sectors and retail but also entertainment and technology. In demand are those able to collaborate across the group.

Over time, she has also noticed an uptick in young people joining the workplace who want to have an impact quickly. “That is still a challenge,” she says and hopes the Dare programme can reinforce a sense of purpose in young employees’ work.

The London competition received 450 applications. These were whittled down to 60 and divided into 12 teams. The jury included Toni Belloni, LVMH’s group managing director, Serge Brunschwig, chairman and CEO of Fendi and Roeland Vos, president and CEO of Belmond, a hotel brand.

The winning projects — which the company says are being worked on but are confidential — looked at enhancing the travel experience, zero waste packaging in wines and spirits and eco-design.

Celia Roussin, a senior product innovation manager for champagne producer Veuve Clicquot, pitched to senior LVMH staff in the New York Dare in 2018. It was nerve-racking, she says but “you learn how to pitch your ideas, test your programmes and create something that is bigger than your original idea”.

Gustavo Marin, purchasing and new product development manager at Chandon Argentina, was one of last year’s winners with the “Gold in the Seeds” project — which recycles grape waste from wine to the cosmetics industry. He says: “We encouraged people to join us with different expertise. We learnt a lot from other people.”

Projects that have been developed through the competition include: My Fav, a social commerce platform (a kind of Shazam for shopping), and Canvas of the Future, which displays digital images on Louis Vuitton’s bags using digital screen technology.

Ms Gaemperle says LVMH wants “cross-generation transmission” where young people come with digital skills and learn the value of the “magic” of the luxury experience.

“At the end of the day it’s [about] beautifully crafted products, it’s a human-centric sector,” she adds.

Katia de Lasteyrie, high jewellery global marketing and product development group manager at Louis Vuitton, initially worked on someone else’s Dare project, but it spurred her to go back and pursue her own idea, which became Canvas of the Future. It is now being developed at Station F, a Parisian start-up campus. LVMH announced in 2018 that it was incubating 50 new businesses there each year.

Ms de Lasteyrie brought a team together that has more technical expertise than herself. “I had to challenge my own assumptions,” she says, “and think what leadership is. I learnt how to motivate people.”

While there have been “some low moments”, Station F, she adds, “kept the right energy and kept me focused on pursuing the idea”. The project was unveiled at VivaTech, an innovation fair in Paris, last June.

Jonathan Noel, Kenzo’s Asia retail excellence manager adds that winning the competition is tough going. “I’d never sweated more in my career,” he says of taking part in 2017.

His Nugget Club project, a retail experience, was a winner that has also joined Station F. “When you go to the office you feel you will change the world, it’s a super energy. This is the power of start-up culture.”"
Inside LVMH's Watch Week 2020 | BoF - The Business of Fashion,"Tue, 21 Jan 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzb2ZmYXNoaW9uLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy9sdXh1cnkvaW5zaWRlLWx2bWhzLXdhdGNoLXdlZWstMjAyMC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — As a line in the sand moment, LVMH Watch Week, held in Dubai this week, and hosted by Bulgari along with the LVMH Watch Division's three brands — Tag Heuer, Hublot and Zenith — couldn't have been clearer. The major Swiss watch fairs are running out of time. On Instagram yesterday, Bulgari Chief Executive Jean-Christophe Babin declared the event was ""making obsolete the 20th century Swiss Watch fairs which lost connection with commercial requirements and industry promotion.""

He was referring to Baselworld and the Richemont Group vehicle Watches & Wonders (formerly known as the Salon International de la Haute Horlogerie, or SIHH). Both, but particularly Baselworld, have been heavily criticised in recent years for being overpriced and failing to serve their exhibitors or their visitors in the digital age.

While the four LVMH brands still plan to exhibit at Baselworld this year alongside Rolex and Patek Philippe, many others have pulled out. Baselworld, which also covers jewellery, has lost around 1,500 exhibitors, or around 75 percent of the total, in a little over a decade, including Swatch Group (which owns Omega, Longines and Breguet among others), Breitling and Seiko. Audemars Piguet and Richard Mille, two of the most powerful names in luxury watches, withdrew from Watches & Wonders last year.

Outrageously Expensive and Crazy Timing

ADVERTISEMENT

This year, the two fairs have collaborated on dates in an attempt to attract more visitors, but that has meant moving the shows to the end of April. SIHH was previously in January; Baselworld in March. ""The fairs are outrageously expensive, and the timing of this year’s fairs is crazy for our clients, retailers and press,"" said Babin at a press conference to launch the three-day event on Monday.

The major Swiss watch fairs are running out of time.

Losing the LVMH brands would be a big blow for Baselworld’s beleaguered new management, which has been tasked with reviving an event founded over 100 years ago. Stéphane Bianchi, head of the LVMH Watch Division and Tag Heuer’s chief executive, said he would decide after Baselworld whether his brands would exhibit again in 2021. ""No decision has been taken to pull out,"" he said. ""Everything is open.""

Babin said the event, which was attended by 145 retailers and 200 members of the press from around the world, all as invited guests of LVMH, was ""much cheaper"" than taking four brands to Basel, although declined to say what the group had spent. Costs were split between the four brands.

""I believe in proximity and relationship,"" said Babin at the launch. ""Being together is something you cannot enjoy at a watch fair where you have so many brands.""

Getting Ahead of the Pack

Bulgari, Hublot and Zenith all used the event to launch new product, as much as 50 percent of their 2020 collections. Tag Heuer launched a single limited-edition piece timed with the company’s 160th anniversary. Consensus among the brands was that a January showcase gave them an opportunity to stimulate sales and interest early in the year.

Many visitors questioned Tag Heuer’s decision not to use the platform LVMH Watch Week created to launch a new collection. Spokespeople for Bianchi said this was because the company has a far bigger distribution footprint than Bulgari, Hublot and Zenith, and would not have been able to entertain its entire retailer network in Dubai.

A January showcase gave [brands] an opportunity to stimulate sales and interest early in the year.

Bianchi said he would be launching a new version of Tag Heuer’s Connected smartwatch in March but holding the rest of the company’s new collection back until Baselworld. He added that the collection, which will be led by Tag Heuer's best-selling Carrera model, would be immediately available on launch, borrowing the see-now/buy-now concept trialed by fashion brands in recent years. Typically, new watch collections can take months to come to market.

The move suggests Tag Heuer may yet commit to a major watch fair, assuming visitor numbers are high enough, even if Bulgari and other LVMH watch brands choose not to. Babin confirmed in an interview that while the four brands had joined forces for LVMH Watch Week, the group ""will never constrain any brand to act collectively.""

In the same interview, Babin continued his criticism of the Swiss watch fairs and their exhibitors, saying they ""want to sink with the ship."" Watches & Wonders, which is far smaller than Baselworld with only 31 exhibiting brands, is organised by the Fondation de la Haute Horlogerie and hugely reliant on Richemont brands such as Cartier, IWC and Panerai for its survival.

Many have suggested Baselworld, which says it will have around 600 exhibitors this year (up from 520 in 2019), will stay afloat as long as Rolex and Patek Philippe continue to exhibit. The two most powerful names in global watch retail continue to operate traditional distribution models, working predominantly with third party retailers, and still need a trade fair.

Baselworld’s Managing Director Michel Loris-Melikoff said at Dubai Watch Week in November that the fair will keep its B2B focus, while evolving a B2C concept alongside it. Thierry Stern, president of Patek Philippe, has said he has no plans to move away from Basel. Rolex has made no comment. Mr Loris-Melikoff has previously been quoted saying Baselworld lost money for the first time in 2019.

It’s a Woman’s World

Many of the new pieces unveiled during LVMH Watch Week were women's watches. Bulgari led with two high-end mechanical pieces. It said the Serpenti Seduttori Tourbillon was the smallest women’s tourbillon wristwatch on the market, and that the Divas’ Dream Minute Repeater Malachite was the thinnest women’s minute repeater (a watch that chimes the time on demand) ever made.

Zenith introduced 20 new references from 50 scheduled for the year, spearheaded by a first women’s version of its Defy collection called the Defy Midnight. Julien Tornare, the brand’s chief executive, said Zenith currently sold around 15 percent of its watches to women and that the Defy, a line inspired by a design from the company’s 1970s archive, was the company’s ""growth engine.""

Many of the new pieces unveiled during LVMH Watch Week were women's watches.

The new watches, all of which are set with diamonds, come on stainless steel bracelets and are sold with three additional straps. These are rubber based with either leather or satin inserts and can be switched using Zenith’s new strap-changing system. ""I wanted a contemporary watch for women,"" said Tornare. ""Women are much better at multi-tasking and we wanted a product they can use at different moments of the day, of the week.""

Ricardo Guadalupe, Hublot's chief executive, said in an interview that sales of women’s models accounted for 22 percent of his company’s turnover, but that he would like to grow that to 40 percent. Hublot introduced two new women’s watches in Dubai, but its collection focused around the Big Bang Integral, an update to the company’s flagship men’s watch with a specially designed integrated bracelet.

Guadalupe said that 95 percent of his sales had been on rubber straps and that he hoped to add new customers with the Big Bang’s first collection of bracelet watches. ""If we do 5 percent of our sales in bracelets [this year] it will be a success,"" he said. The new pieces are available in titanium, ceramic and Hublot’s high-performance King Gold. He also said this week’s releases would all be available before Baselworld.

The Future of Watch Fairs?

So, what happens next? Watches & Wonders opens on April 25; Baselworld follows on April 30. Before then, Swatch Group and Seiko will both hold events for international press and retailers. Breitling, which left Baselworld after this year’s dates were announced saying they were too late, has yet to announce its 2020 plans.

So far, Baselworld appears not to have convinced the LVMH brands it has done enough to encourage them to sign on beyond 2020. ""The world has changed,"" said Guadalupe. ""[Baselworld] said they’re going to do an evolution, but this year will be a repetition of last year. Stands don’t have to be cathedrals — we want to be more open, to give visitors an experience. The show has to be B2C as well as B2B, more than just watches in windows.""

LVMH in years to come will present an alternative to the traditional fairs.

Guadalupe also said, however, that the Swiss watch industry ""needs one big event."" But he pointed out that ""our growth in the future will be mainly because of China. Not just in China, but selling to Chinese [consumers] around the world.""

In the past, Loris-Melikoff of Baselworld has suggested he could either move his show to Hong Kong or create a satellite event there. Baselworld’s parent company MCH Group has an existing network in the territory, following the success of Art Basel, which this year will be held in March. Recent civil unrest makes that unlikely to happen in the near future, however.

Babin said he had three choices; Watches & Wonders, Baselworld or an LVMH event. He said he would like to see LVMH Watch Week grow and involve other brands from the LVMH portfolio.

LVMH brands Dior and Chaumet also make luxury watches, while the group’s recent $16.2 billion acquisition of Tiffany may yet see it look to revive the company’s flagging watch offering. ""We are the only watch and jewellery group with a hospitality division,"" Babin noted. ""LVMH in years to come will present an alternative to the traditional fairs.""

As an aside, when asked whether he would be moving to Tiffany, Babin said he was ""leading Bulgari and very happy here"" and that he would ""never trade my position back to mono-activity,"" referring to the five sectors Bulgari currently operates in. ""At 60, it would feel like downgrading,"" he added.

According to its organisers, LVMH Watch Week is the future. In that same Instagram post, Babin concluded: ""LVMH and Bulgari, Hublot, Zenith and Tag Heuer have clearly taken the lead and developed the vision for the category relevance in the 21st century.""

Louis Vuitton is reportedly opening its first-ever restaurant and cafe inside its new Osaka, Japan flagship store.

According to WWD, Le Café V will have pride of place on the top floor of the four-level store, and the menu has reportedly been designed by Japanese chef Yosuke Suga, the former executive chef of L'Atelier de Joël Robuchon in Tokyo. The adjacent restaurant, Sugalabo V, will serve dinner to an ultra-exclusive guest list—which reflects the M.O. of Suga's original Sugalabo location, which is apparently as difficult to find as it is to get in to.

WWD reports that artist and designer Tokujin Yoshioka created the visuals for the restaurant's charger plates, which will pay homage to that unmistakable LV monogram. (One of Yoshioka's previous projects was to design the rose-gold torch that will be used for this summer's Olympic games, which will be held in Tokyo, so a plate was probably a piece of cake… quite possibly an LV logo cake.)

The building itself was designed by Jun Aoki, whose portfolio also includes the Louis Vuitton stores in New York City and in Hong Kong. The retail floors of the Osaka location are scheduled to open on February 1, while Le Café V and Sugalabo will both debut on February 15.

In November, luxury conglomerate LVMH (Moët Hennessy - Louis Vuitton) paid a cool $16.2 billion to buy iconic 182-year-old jeweler Tiffany & Co. Earlier this week, Tiffany & Co. announced that it would soon be opening its first-ever European Blue Box Cafe.

The sure-to-be chic eatery will be in the ritzy London department store Harrods, and it will become the fourth Blue Box Cafe; Tiffany's other cafes are inside its own stores in Hong Kong, New York City, and Shanghai. (The New York location is currently closed while that Fifth Avenue flagship is being renovated.)

""We have a long-standing presence in London and by introducing The Tiffany Blue Box Cafe here, we offer our customers in this city yet another way to immerse themselves in the world of Tiffany,"" Richard Moore, Tiffany's divisional vice president for Global Store Design and Creative Visual Merchandising, said.

Guests can take that 'immerse themselves in Tiffany' part pretty literally: each cafe has been designed to make visitors feel like they're sitting inside one of the company's famous blue boxes.

The Telegraph reports that the breakfast menu in London will include smoked-salmon bagels, 'Manhattan waffles,' and avocado toast. Afternoon tea is based around British finger sandwiches and scones, while dinner will feature a Central Park salad, 57th Street Flatbread and 'Charles Lewis Tiffany' truffle-roasted chicken. Yes, all of those meals will be served on Tiffany-blue bone china which is, of course, available to purchase at Harrods.

The Blue Box Cafe is currently taking reservations, and is expected to serve its first Audrey Hepburn-inspired croissants in February."
LVMH Chief Bernard Arnault Ranks No. 2 on This List of the World's Top Brand Leaders - Yahoo Finance,"Thu, 23 Jan 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9sdm1oLWNoaWVmLWJlcm5hcmQtYXJuYXVsdC1yYW5rcy0yMTIxMzE3MzAuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Bernard Arnault, chairman and CEO of LVMH, was ranked No. 2 on Brand Finance’s 2020 Brand Guardianship Index.

Arnault narrowly missed the No. 1 spot with a score of 72.1 out of 100, just 0.1 behind the top-ranking world brand leader, Lockheed Martin head Marillyn Hewson. The annual index, revealed on Wednesday at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, ranks the CEOs of the world’s largest companies from 0 to 100, measuring how they perform as leaders and ambassadors for their brands. Last year, Arnaunt held the No. 3 spot, with a 68.4 ranking.

The fashion mogul’s improved ranking comes after a busy year for LVMH, which is the parent company of luxury labels including Louis Vuitton, Christian Dior, Celine and Givenchy. In April 2019, Arnault and LVMH pledged more than $220 million to assist with repairing Notre Dame after the cathedral was damaged by a fire. The following month, the firm announced the launch of Fenty, a luxury label helmed by Rihanna; LVMH also added Tiffany & Co., the U.S.-based jewelry brand, to its portfolio this November through a $16.2 billion deal.

Across the fashion, retail and athletic industries, Arnault was the only business leader in the top 10. François-Henri Pinault, chairman and CEO of Gucci parent Kering, was No. 12, while Chanel’s Alain Wertheimer ranked No. 24. Alibaba’s Daniel Zhang moved up from last year’s No. 54 spot to No. 19. Meanwhile, Jeff Bezos, head of Amazon, fell from the No. 1 ranking last year to No. 54.

NEW YORK, United States — The company behind Dior and Louis Vuitton's latest investment is a skincare line sold in…Target.

The luxury conglomerate, which this week reported record revenue of nearly $60 billion for 2019, is setting its sights on affordable, “clean” beauty via its investment arm, LVMH Luxury Ventures. In an unlikely pairing, the fund invested in Versed, a fast-growing mass label where most products are priced at or below $17.99, and some under $10. The brand recently closed an $11 million Series A, led by Sonoma Brands with participation from Greycroft and Marcy Venture Partners.

This marks the second time in three months that LVMH has invested in a young-skewing line. In October, the conglomerate's venture arm led a seed round for Madhappy, a direct-to-consumer LA-based streetwear line that sells $165 hoodies and promotes mental health. At just eight months old, Versed is the youngest and least ""luxe"" company in the fund's portfolio, which also includes sneaker reseller Stadium Goods, Gabriela Hearst's luxury label and French beauty brand l'Officine Universelle Buly.

The investment in Versed signals new priorities for LVMH: a desire to get into clean skincare, and, potentially, a new focus on mass-market beauty. The conglomerate owns Fenty Beauty parent Kendo and Sephora, which operates more than 2,600 doors globally, but both have clear prestige positioning. None of LVMH’s beauty labels — from Fenty to Guerlain — are clean. LVMH Luxury Ventures did not respond to a request for comment.

They were on the fringes until very recently, and now it's quickly becoming table stakes.

Price positioning is what separates Versed from dozens of clean beauty labels that launched over the past few years, including Cyan, 27 Rosiers, Alpyn Beauty, W3ll People and Marie Veronique. The leading retailers that specialise in clean beauty — from clean-only sellers like Credo Beauty and Follain to Sephora’s “Clean at Sephora” programme — sell higher-end products such as Goop, Drunk Elephant, Tata Harper or Tatcha.

Katherine Power, Versed’s chief executive, said her goal was to develop a clean skincare brand with the look, feel and formulas of a prestige brand, at mass-market prices.

“When we looked at the drugstore skincare aisle, [we saw] it really hadn’t changed in about 50 years,” she said.

Brands like Versed form a growing ""masstige"" category of affordable but luxe-feeling products, from moisturisers to masks and serums, that typically retail for under $20. Labels from Versed to The Ordinary embrace industry trends such as wellness, a hero ingredient focus, sustainability or cruelty-free, and clean products, which all originated in the luxury sector. While they may look similar, 27 Rosier's ""Ready Selfie Go"" mask retails for $48, almost five times more than Versed's ""Look Alive"" mask.

“Bringing the prestige aesthetic, playbook and sensibility to the mass setting to take on the legacy big brands… it’s not that difficult to say that but it’s difficult to do that,” said Kevin Murphy, managing director of Sonoma Brands.

So how did Versed do it?

Power secured massive distribution from day one, launching in more than 1,400 Target stores on the brand’s first day of business. Working with a big-box wholesale partner requires far more units: the label ordered 10 to 20 times more product than what a typical direct-to-consumer start-up might need. Target’s scale allowed Versed to leverage volume, even at the initial phases, to drive down manufacturing costs. By year’s end, Versed, which has 22 products, will be sold in 3,000 doors globally, including over 1,800 Target stores in the US.

Power is eschewing the direct-to-consumer model preferred by start-ups — which glorifies “cutting out the middleman” and spending big on customer acquisition — to focus on building a thriving wholesale business. Aligning with a retailer of Target’s size ensures that Power doesn’t have to pay for ads on social media to find customers.

“[Target] lets us have so much more cost efficiency to our supply chain that as a direct-to-consumer only brand you just don’t get,” Power said. “That really changes the cost-profile dramatically. Even most brands launching in Sephora, they might want to launch in 40 doors to start with.”

Instead of creating custom bottles, tubes and jars, which are among the biggest costs when starting a brand, Power also opted for stock packaging. The focus was on design: pastel colours and modern branding make Versed’s Stroke of Brilliance Brightening Serum or Dew Point Moisturizing Gel Cream look no different than any “clean” product sitting on Sephora or Credo Beauty’s shelves. Even the logo possesses the sans-serif millennial minimalism that propelled brands like Byredo to cult status.

When we looked at the drugstore skincare aisle, [we saw] it really hadn't changed in about 50 years.

Melanie Bender, general manager of Versed, said a refillable programme will begin in April, along with a host of other sustainability initiatives from sourcing 100 percent of paper from Forest Stewardship Council certified partners to using more efficient forms of transportation and prioritising domestic production to reduce greenhouse-gas impact.

“I’m interested in how quickly clean beauty has become the end all be all — and on the fashion side with sustainable fashion. They were on the fringes until very recently, and now it’s quickly becoming table stakes,” said Susan Lyne, president and partner at BBG Ventures. “It will be critically important for companies like LVMH to not just offer clean beauty brands, but to use that learning to make the majority of their brands clean beauty.”

But still, there’s no clear-cut definition for clean beauty. To date, the term has largely been defined in the US by what ingredients products are formulated without. Sephora’s “Clean at Sephora” programme, introduced in May of 2018, highlights labels the retailer believes to be clean, while Credo Beauty and Beautycounter have created extensive lists – “The Dirty List” and “The Never List” – comprised of ingredients products are free of.

For Bender, “clean” is anything that’s safe for one’s body or skin.

“We do look to leading research and leading regulatory bodies to help guide on what that is,” Bender explained, noting that she and Power formulate to EU standards, which are “much more comprehensive than the ones in the US. It’s a matter of 1,300 ingredients versus 11.”

“We have an open formula policy. This year we’ve identified a host of new ingredients that we want to raise the bar and formulate to,” Bender added. “That’s the mentality that you have to have because the information and the expectations are really changing quickly.”

LVMH Q4 Revenues Up 12% on Strong Fashion and Leather Goods Sales - WWD,"Tue, 28 Jan 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3dkLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy1uZXdzL2ZpbmFuY2lhbC9sdm1oLXE0LXJldmVudWVzLXVwLTEyLW9uLXN0cm9uZy1mYXNoaW9uLWFuZC1sZWF0aGVyLWdvb2RzLXNhbGVzLTEyMDM0NTQ2MzMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS — LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton said sales decelerated slightly in the fourth quarter, despite another strong performance in its key fashion and leather goods division.

Revenues in the three months ended Dec. 31 totaled 15.27 billion euros, up 12 percent in reported terms and 8 percent on an organic basis. Analysts polled by Bloomberg had banked on an 8.7 percent increase in like-for-like sales.

This compared with a rise of 17 percent in reported terms and 11 percent in organic terms in the third quarter. The French luxury conglomerate blamed the decrease on one-off effects linked to a hike in Japan’s consumption tax, and variations in cognac inventories in the U.S.

Global stock markets have taken a beating in recent sessions amid market fears the coronavirus outbreak in China will hurt tourism and shopping.

LVMH said sales in the fourth quarter were driven by its largest business, fashion and leather goods, home to brands including Louis Vuitton, Dior, Fendi and Celine. The division posted revenues of 6.36 billion euros, up 15 percent on an organic basis, slightly below consensus estimates of a 15.5 percent increase.

Profit from recurring operations amounted to 11.50 billion euros in 2019 as a whole, up 15 percent, setting a record for the group. The operating profit margin was stable at 21.4 percent. Net profit rose 13 percent to 7.17 billion euros, LVMH said in a statement published after the market close on Tuesday.

After rising 65 percent in 2019, briefly making chairman and chief executive officer Bernard Arnault the world’s richest person, LVMH’s shares have fallen 7.3 percent since Jan. 17, amid fears that consumer spending in China will decline as more people stay home over the Lunar New Year due to the coronavirus.

The industry bellwether’s quarterly sales figures come before other luxury rivals Kering, due to publish figures on Feb. 12, and Hermès on Feb. 26. Compagnie Financière Richemont reports annual results on May 15.

LVMH said its perfumes and cosmetics division clocked 12 percent growth on an organic basis, to 1.92 billion euros in the fourth quarter, while wines and spirits posted 1.65 billion euros in sales, a 3 percent rise.

Watches and jewelry and selective retailing, which includes the beauty retailer Sephora and duty-free stores DFS, both registered organic growth of 1 percent, to 1.14 billion euros and 4.23 billion euros, respectively."
"Asked About Amazon, LVMH Head Bernard Arnault Talks Counterfeits, ""Ties to Organized Crime"" - The Fashion Law","Wed, 29 Jan 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWZhc2hpb25sYXcuY29tL2Fza2VkLWFib3V0LWFtYXpvbi1sdm1oLWhlYWQtYmVybmFyZC1hcm5hdWx0LXRhbGtzLWNvdW50ZXJmZWl0cy10aWVzLXRvLW9yZ2FuaXplZC1jcmltZS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Several years after LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton chief financial officer Jean-Jacques Guiony told investors that there is “no way we can do business with [Amazon] for the time being,” stating that the “business of Amazon does not fit with LVMH full stop and it does not fit with our brands,” which include fashion houses like Louis Vuitton, Dior, Givenchy, Celine, and Fendi, among others, the Paris-based luxury conglomerate’s chairman drove that point home on Tuesday without mincing words about it. “If they change the business model, I don’t know, but with the existing business model, there is no way we can do business with them for the time being.”

In an earnings conference call on the heels of the release of LVMH’s “record” fourth quarter and full year results, LVMH chair Bernard Arnault said that it is “absolutely right” that his sweeping luxury goods venture will not be part of the high-end platform that Amazon is said to be readying, and pointed to the prevalence of “counterfeits” as a key part of the issue.

Speaking specifically to Amazon, which he called “an outstanding company,” Arnault asserted that where the $1 trillion e-commerce giant makes money is its vast third-party marketplace of products, in which “they don’t own the stock, [and] they don’t own the inventory.” Instead, “They use their database to provide customers to other merchants that take a commission, and that … is how they sell counterfeits.”

The sale of counterfeit goods – i.e., products that bear a trademark that is “identical with, or substantially indistinguishable from” another party’s registered trademark and which is used on the same type of goods as the rightsholder’s mark is registered – creates “a connection to organized crime,” Arnault went on to assert, “because when you have a site selling counterfeit products, this is always financed either by organized crime or it ends up the pockets of terrorism.”

“So, is it right that big websites should make money being associated with organized crime?,” he asks. “I don’t know what you think. I find this shocking. And so there’s – we have to do a lot if we want to avoid the sale of counterfeit product.”

Arnault’s strong comments are hardly the first time that Amazon has faced pushback over the saturation of its marketplace with counterfeit or otherwise infringing goods. Just this month, Peter Navarro, the Director of the National Trade Council at the White House, speaking on the heels of the signing of the first phase of the U.S.-China trade deal, stated that sites like “Amazon and eBay” are “making a bunch of money … selling this counterfeit stuff,” without “accepting [their] full responsibility” for such sales.

Even more recently, the U.S. government released its highly-anticipated report on the massive global trade in counterfeit goods. While it does not call out Amazon by name, the 54-page document drafted by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”)’s Office of Strategy, Policy, and Plans places significant blame on “online third-party marketplaces” that sell counterfeit goods “alongside authentic products,” and that “must take a more active role in monitoring, detecting, and preventing trafficking in counterfeit and pirated goods.”

As for whether there is any merit to speculation that LVMH – fresh from its acquisition agreement with Tiffany & Co. – might be looking to add Prada to its arsenal of brands, “as the Italian press seems to indicate,” as a reporter from French publication Le Monde asked on the call on Tuesday, Arnault revealed that “the Italian press lends me many ideas,” but failed to confirm such reports."
Gigi Hadid Joins the Panel of Experts for the LVMH Prize for Young Designers - Harper's BAZAAR,"Thu, 30 Jan 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhhcnBlcnNiYXphYXIuY29tL2Zhc2hpb24vbW9kZWxzL2EzMDcyMDE0NC9naWdpLWhhZGlkLWx2bWgtcHJpemUteW91bmctZmFzaGlvbi1kZXNpZ25lcnMtMjAyMC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Gigi Hadid has been through the ins and outs of the fashion industry. At just 24 years old, the model has closed and opened the biggest runway shows, fronted advertising campaign from Guess to Chanel, and helped design blockbuster collections with Tommy Hilfiger. Now, she’s adding a new credit to her CV—read: fashion expert.

For its 7th edition, the LVMH Prize for Young Designers announced nine new professionals that have been inducted to a panel of 59 judges. These luxury veterans are all established in media, retail, technology, and other fields that encompass the business of fashion. “They are witnesses and essential actors of fashion,” said Delphine Arnault, the Executive Vice President of Louis Vuitton, in a statement. “Their vision helps to discover the most promising talents. I would like to thank them warmly for their loyalty and commitment to our cause.”

Joining Hadid are Moda Operandi’s Lauren Santo Domingo, Matches Fashion’s Natalie Kingham, activist Sinéad Burk, and a number of journalists and stylists. Each, to be sure, will bring their experience to the table as they judge a pool of talented, burgeoning designers. And though much younger than the other inductees, Hadid is certainly not lacking in know-how. She has worked side by side with the best and brightest, presumably taking notes on how to design a collection and run a successful business. Moreover, she holds tremendous influence with social media platforms, and is able to really help nascent brands gain notoriety—which is a major factor in why the LVMH Prize for Young Designers is highly coveted.

“I am pleased to see how the LVMH Prize, imagined by the LVMH Group as a real support for young creatives, has grown since its launch in 2013,” added Arnault. “It is the responsibility of the LVMH Group, as the industry leader in fashion and luxury, to support and follow the great designers of tomorrow.”"

LVMH's Kenzo Joins Tmall Luxury Pavilion - Alizila,"Tue, 21 Jan 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFsaXppbGEuY29tL2x2bWhzLWtlbnpvLWpvaW5zLXRtYWxsLWx1eHVyeS1wYXZpbGlvbi_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"|

Luxury fashion house Kenzo, best known for its signature tiger embroidery, on Friday launched a flagship store on Tmall Luxury Pavilion. This marks the brand’s first partnership in China with an e-commerce provider.

This also makes Kenzo the first LVMH-owned fashion label to open a standalone store on Alibaba Group’s dedicated platform for luxury and premium brands. The luxury group has introduced a growing range of its beauty, accessories and wine subsidiaries on Tmall and the Pavilion, including Guerlain, Givenchy, Fresh, Benefit, Rimowa, Tag Heuer, Zenith and Mo√´t Hennessy.

Kenzo’s flagship store offers some of the most popular items from its ready-to-wear, footwear, bags and accessories collections. To celebrate the store opening, the brand debuted its kung fu-inspired Chinese New Year capsule collection on the Pavilion, including everything from T-shirts and jumpers to backpacks and trainers that feature Kenzo’s Kung Fu Rat character, a nod to the zodiac animal of the new lunar year. Two items from the new capsule – a red cap and a zipped card case – also made their global exclusive debut on the Pavilion.

To engage young shoppers, the brand also released a Kung Fu Rat-themed animation and interactive racing game inspired by 1950s comics and martial-arts movies from the 1970s. Pavilion users can play the game, featuring Kung Fu Rat and his Chinese-zodiac companions in a race across a hand-painted landscape, to win special perks and benefits. As part of the launch, Kenzo is also offering some of its first Pavilion customers special-edition boxes for purchases as well as interest-free, flexible payment options via Ant Financial’s consumer-lending service, Huabei.

Launched in 2017, Tmall Luxury Pavilion now offers over 150 brands with products ranging from apparel and beauty items to watches and luxury cars. Brands include Chanel, Cartier, Bottega Veneta, Valentino, Alexander McQueen, Burberry, Tod’s, Stella McCartney, Marni, Moschino, Michael Kors, MCM, Breitling and Maserati. In September, Richemont’s e-commerce platform, Net-a-Porter, also launched a flagship store on the Pavilion, offering the site’s shoppers a selection of items from designer and luxury brands such as Balmain, Jimmy Choo, ChloeÃÅ and Montblanc."
"As Gucci's sales slow, Bottega Veneta is emerging as Kering's new star - Glossy","Thu, 16 Jan 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmdsb3NzeS5jby9mYXNoaW9uL2FzLWd1Y2Npcy1zYWxlcy1zbG93LWJvdHRlZ2EtdmVuZXRhLWlzLWVtZXJnaW5nLWFzLWtlcmluZ3MtbmV3LXN0YXIv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Prior to ex-Celine designer Daniel Lee’s appointment as creative director at Bottega Veneta, the brand was a sore spot on Kering’s earnings sheet, with several years of declining sales. Now, less than two years since he joined, the brand is growing faster than its sister brands including Saint Laurent and even Kering’s crown jewel, Gucci.

After Gucci’s monumental growth in 2017 and 2018 slowed — with five consecutive quarters of declining growth starting in late 2018 — and the loss of Stella McCartney in March 2018. which went on to join with competitor LVMH, Kering is under pressure to establish a stable of high-performing brands to keep up with competitors. While LVMH’s Louis Vuitton dominates luxury market sales, LVMH has a more even spread of brand success than Kering, with brands like Dior, Fendi, Celine and others all performing well. In the past two years, new creative directors at key LVMH brands — Virgil Abloh at Louis Vuitton, Hedi Slimane at Celine and Kim Jones at Dior Homme — have made all of their respective brands a financial success.

Bottega Veneta, led by Lee, could be the beginning of a strong, diversified Kering portfolio.

Early signs show that Bottega is already on its way. While the end of 2018 marked the end of Gucci’s growth, it marked the beginning of Bottega’s turnaround. Sales have grown each quarter since, with a significant 7% jump in the second half of 2019 after the first batch of Lee’s designs went on sale.

In an interview with Vogue Business, multiple buyers from places like MatchesFashion and Harrods said that Bottega was high on their list for what they’d be stocking in 2020. Roopal Patel of Saks Fifth Avenue said that Bottega’s handbags and shoes were “bound to have global waitlists.”

Many of Lee’s designs have become massively popular and massively imitated. After his first collection, heavily featuring square-toed shoes, retail analytics company Edited found that there was a 1,550% increase year over year in square-toed shoes being sold at U.S. mass retailers in the fall 2019 season. Discounts on Bottega products also fell dramatically around November of last year, coinciding with Lee’s first collections and signaling that sell-through is likely higher.

According to the 2019 Lyst Index of the most popular fashion brands, Bottega Veneta entered the top 20 for the first time, driven by its padded sandals — the most popular womenswear product of the year based on sales and social media conversation, according to Lyst. Online searches for Bottega Veneta were up by 156% between September and October, thanks to buzz from influencers and a revamped Instagram advertisement plan that included an expanded number of ad formats, the brand put in place at the end of 2018. In the same time frame, they drove up the return on ad spend by more than 200%.

The brand’s social media strategy has shifted significantly, as well. According to data from Tribe Dynamics, between the third quarter of 2018 and third quarter of 2019, Bottega’s influencer posts grew from 30% to 46% of the brand’s total social media output, while promoted posts dropped from 26% to 6%. Tribe said that when a brand’s earned media value is dominated by influencers rather than sponsored posts, the growth tends to be more sustainable.

There were also rumors that Bottega had spent big on sending Pouch bags to many influencers throughout 2019, and the Pouch’s ubiquity among fashion influencers last year did not go unnoticed.

Bottega has also benefited from the changeover in designers at Celine. When Hedi Slimane took over from Phoebe Philo, people mourned the loss of her elegant, understated designs. When Daniel Lee took over Bottega, it wasn’t long before his style was heralded by fashion blogs and consumers as the second coming of Philo’s Celine. Lee’s tenure even inspired the creation of an Instagram account called @newbottega, a tribute to his designs that boasts over 100,000 followers, whose creator said she was inspired to create it specifically because of her nostalgia for the old Celine.

The company’s shift came about partially thanks to Lee’s designs but also out of a concerted effort on Kering’s part to transform the brand. Rather than cutting off resources to the brand when sales were down, Kering has spent the last two years investing more heavily in Bottega, opening its largest store in the world in Manhattan in February 2018 and a new flagship store in Tokyo in December 2018, and bringing in a new CEO, former Saint Laurent COO Leo Rongone, in June 2019. Following, Bottega saw its best results in years — almost 10% sales growth in the third quarter of fiscal year 2019.

“The timing of Daniel Lee’s appointment has been key to the resurgence at Bottega Veneta,” said Kayla Marci, market analyst at Edited. “Maximalism and logomania have dominated fashion for the last half of the decade, and we are now seeing the pendulum swing back toward a simpler aesthetic. Items like the brand’s Pouch [a popular handbag launched in 2019], and the padded sandals are hailed as timeless, and their popularity with influencers has propelled them to achieve cult status.”

But Kering may not be going far enough. LVMH made huge waves last year by launching Rihanna’s Fenty, a new luxury house and the first launched by a woman of color. Kering’s attempts at rejuvenation have so far focused on the same old brands, like Saint Laurent and Gucci, just with an exciting new creative director slotted in.

“Kering must diversify their investments into new emerging talent,” said Syama Meagher, CEO and founder of Scaling Retail. “The existing model of breathing new life into legacy brands through young, hot creative directors is effective short-term, but it doesn’t build the long-term portfolio. Who will be the Stella McCartneys of the future? Will the hot, emerging luxury brands want to be under the Kering umbrella? If Kering fails to show it can foster and support brands of the future, then the model of rotating out creative directors may get old, and brand relevancy will falter.”"

Supermodel ‎Natalia Vodianova Is Engaged to LVMH Heir Antoine Arnault - Yahoo Finance,"Thu, 02 Jan 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9zdXBlcm1vZGVsLW5hdGFsaWEtdm9kaWFub3ZhLWVuZ2FnZWQtbHZtaC0yMTI1NDMxMTIuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Natalia Vodianova and Antoine Arnault

This wedding is going to be super and luxe. Supermodel Natalia Vodianova announced Thursday, January 2, that she’s engaged to her longtime partner, Antoine Arnault.

The two are parents to their sons, Maxim, 5, and Roman, 3, and have been an item since 2011. “This year has been beautiful and very memorable,” the repeat Vogue cover girl wrote on Instagram against a loved-up snap with the businessman. “2020 here we come 💍♥️😍 Can’t wait to celebrate next year with our loved ones @antoinearnault.”

Vodianova added a series of wedding emojis ahead of her impending nuptials. Arnault proposed to the Russian model with an unconventional engagement ring: a pear-shape diamond on an east-west setting.

Arnault is the son of LVMH (Louis Vuitton Moët Hennessy) CEO and Chairman Bernard Arnault, whose company owns some of the highest-sought luxury brands in the world, ranging from Vuitton to Sephora. The French native is a member of the one of the richest luxury conglomerate families in the world. Currently, he is the CEO of the brand Berluti and has a minority stake in a Parisian restaurant.

Vodianova is one of the most recognizable supermodels of the ’00s, renowned for her versatility and beauty. Their love story is rapidly approaching a decade after they first met on the set of a Vuitton shoot back in 2008. “I remember seeing her and my jaw sort of dropped internally,” Arnault recalled to W Magazine. “I mean, of course she’s beautiful, but she has something undefinable. There’s an aura about her.”

LVMH revenues rise 15% in 2019 but uncertainty in Asia looms - Vogue Business,"Tue, 28 Jan 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZvZ3VlYnVzaW5lc3MuY29tL2NvbXBhbmllcy9sdm1oLWVhcm5pbmdzLWZpbmFuY2lhbHMtZnVsbC15ZWFyLTIwMTnSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"In recent weeks, the rapidly spreading coronavirus has roiled markets, stifling both domestic and international luxury spending for consumers in China, where travel restrictions have spread as the number of reported cases rises. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has expanded its travel warning to include all of mainland China, while Hong Kong has banned travellers from some regions of mainland China by suspending train service and cancelling flights. Prolonged protests in Hong Kong are also eroding sales in the region, which is a hub for luxury consumption.



“Let’s not panic; let’s analyse the situation calmly,” said LVMH chairman and chief executive Bernard Arnault in response to a question about the virus during a conference call to discuss the group’s 2019 performance. “It’s very early days… to know how long all this will last. The Chinese government has reacted very strongly.”



Luxury companies currently generate about one-third of revenues from Chinese shoppers, including domestic and overseas purchases, according to Cowen & Co. analysts. Travel restrictions will likely lead to sales declines in key markets around the globe, the analysts said. If the outbreak were to be contained by mid-2020, companies with a high exposure to Chinese consumers — including LVMH – could see a reduction in earnings-per-share in the low to mid single-digit range, according to Cowen.



LVMH reported that sales of luxury goods in Hong Kong continue to crater due to ongoing unrest. Revenues were down 40 per cent during the fourth quarter, according to chief financial officer Jean-Jacques Guiony, following a decline of 25 per cent during the third quarter. “Of course this has an impact,” he said.



DFS, the company’s travel retail arm, is particularly vulnerable to disruption in Hong Kong, Arnault said.



Despite the uncertainty, flagship brands Louis Vuitton and Christian Dior continued to shine, according to Arnault. A new set of Vuitton leather goods and accessories was a “considerable success”, while Dior attracted 600,000 people to its 2019 exhibit at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London, he said. The addition of Louis Vuitton facilities in the U.S. and France also served to increase production capacity over the past year.



The $16.2 billion acquisition of Tiffany & Co. announced in November is expected to close mid-2020 and bolster the group’s standing in the watches and jewellery segment. Growth for the category was stagnant in the fourth quarter, increasing 1 per cent in the same period last year, as the turnaround effort at TAG Heuer counteracts strength at Bulgari, Arnault said. LVMH continues to reduce inventory and cut ties with retailers who aren’t aligned with the company’s vision for the watchmaker, he said.



Arnault said the company doesn’t have plans at this juncture to significantly boost its online business, calling its e-commerce site an “almost insignificant” piece of the business. “I am somewhat sceptical… the online sites are losing money. We were asked to become involved, and I was never keen,” he said.



Arnault acknowledged the geopolitical challenges for the year ahead and the potential for global economic shock. “The climate is buoyant … [but] we’re not going to be able to escape a financial crisis at some point,” he told investors.

This wedding is going to be super and luxe. Supermodel Natalia Vodianova announced Thursday, January 2, that she’s engaged to her longtime partner, Antoine Arnault.

The two are parents to their sons, Maxim, 5, and Roman, 3, and have been an item since 2011. “This year has been beautiful and very memorable,” the repeat Vogue cover girl wrote on Instagram against a loved-up snap with the businessman. “2020 here we come 💍♥️😍 Can’t wait to celebrate next year with our loved ones @antoinearnault.”

Vodianova added a series of wedding emojis ahead of her impending nuptials. Arnault proposed to the Russian model with an unconventional engagement ring: a pear-shape diamond on an east-west setting.

Arnault is the son of LVMH (Louis Vuitton Moët Hennessy) CEO and Chairman Bernard Arnault, whose company owns some of the highest-sought luxury brands in the world, ranging from Vuitton to Sephora. The French native is a member of the one of the richest luxury conglomerate families in the world. Currently, he is the CEO of the brand Berluti and has a minority stake in a Parisian restaurant.

Vodianova is one of the most recognizable supermodels of the ’00s, renowned for her versatility and beauty. Their love story is rapidly approaching a decade after they first met on the set of a Vuitton shoot back in 2008. “I remember seeing her and my jaw sort of dropped internally,” Arnault recalled to W Magazine. “I mean, of course she’s beautiful, but she has something undefinable. There’s an aura about her.”

Jan 23, 2020

is introducing a “delivery promise” feature, designed to boost the omnichannel shopping experience for consumers, beginning with one of its brands. The company, which owns , Christian and now Tiffany, among others, is doing this via tech specialist OneStock’s agile order management technology “to offer a high-end service that aligns with customer expectations”.







LVMH and OneStock want to improve the shopping experience online



It means web shoppers will be able to view real time stock availability and choose a guaranteed delivery method based on the item selected. The options include ‘white glove’ same-day delivery, as well as collect-in-store within two hours. The customer is kept updated with an estimated delivery time.



And importantly it’s also using the tech company’s ship from store, click-and collect-and return in-store capabilities. This is being ever more widely used by fashion retailers, and companies across the price scale have reported a boost to online sales as a result of implementing such features.

LVMH has launched the tech with just one of its brands, without disclosing specifically which one, in the US, and Europe will see it rolled out for the same brand during the rest of this year.



“The personalisation of the customer experience and in-store experience are two areas that we want to make exceptional, and where we want to improve the e-commerce services we offer,” said Laetitia Roche-Grenet, Business Synergies Director at LVMH.



“The needs of the customer are paramount in the luxury sector, and brands often struggle to emulate the exclusive experience online they offer in-store,” OneStock’s CEO Romulus Grigoras added. “LVMH is a pioneer in a market undergoing digital transformation and fully understands what being omnichannel can mean for growth and profitability. It is adding fresh excitement to online and in-store purchasing, which will provide a genuine competitive advantage.”



OneStock and LVMH have been working closely together in recent periods with the former having been selected to join the luxury giant’s start-up accelerator for technology businesses, known as La Maison des Startups."
Louis Vuitton buys 2nd-largest diamond ever mined | Arkansas Democrat Gazette - Arkansas Online,"Sun, 26 Jan 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFya2Fuc2Fzb25saW5lLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMjAvamFuLzI2L2xvdWlzLXZ1aXR0b24tYnV5cy0ybmQtbGFyZ2VzdC1kaWFtb25kLS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The largest rough diamond discovered since 1905, the 1,758-carat Sewelo, was revealed with great fanfare in April, named in July and then largely disappeared from view. Now, it has resurfaced with a new owner -- and it's not a name you might expect.

It is not, for example, Jeff Bezos on the hunt for a trophy asset. It is not a royal family, searching for a centerpiece for a new tiara. It is not the De Beers Group, arguably the creator of the diamond market, which owns the Millennium Star diamond, a 770-carat pear-shaped stone.

It is not even diamond specialist Graff, owner of the Graff Lesedi La Rona, a 302.37-carat diamond that is the world's largest emerald-cut sparkler.

It is Louis Vuitton, the luxury brand better known for its logo-bedecked handbags than its mega-gems, which has been present on Place Vendôme, the heart of the high jewelry market, for less than a decade.

And it is the latest sign, after the $16.2 billion purchase of Tiffany by French behemoth LVMH (the parent company of Louis Vuitton) in November, that LVMH is out not just to compete but to utterly dominate the high jewelry market. Taken together, the double punch of purchasing (brand and stone) in less than two months is the luxury equivalent of shock and awe.

""There are less than 10 people in the world who would know what to do with a stone like that or how to cut it and be able to put the money on the table to buy it,"" said Marcel Pruwer, former president of the Antwerp Diamond Exchange and managing director of the International Economic Strategy advisory firm. ""To buy and then sell what could be a $50 million stone, you need the technical qualifications, as well as the power to write the check and take the risk.""

Michael Burke, chief executive of Louis Vuitton, declined to say how much the company had spent on the stone, though he acknowledged that it was in the ""millions"" and that ""some of my competitors, I believe, will be surprised"" that Vuitton was the buyer.

""Nobody expects us to put such an emphasis on high jewelry,"" Burke said. ""I think it will spice things up a bit. Wake up the industry.""

According to Jeffrey Post, curator in charge of gems and minerals at the Smithsonian Institution, ""if you buy a diamond like that, it gives you immediate credibility."" It is also, especially in the case of the Sewelo, more risky than you can imagine.

UNEARTHING A GEM

Discovered in April at the Karowe mine in Botswana (owned by Lucara Diamond Corp., a Canadian miner), the baseball-size Sewelo is the second-largest rough diamond ever mined.

The largest was the 3,106.75-carat Cullinan diamond, which was discovered in South Africa in 1905 and eventually yielded two enormous high-quality stones -- one of 530.4 carats and one 317.4, both now part of the British crown jewels, as well as many smaller stones.

The Sewelo is also the largest rough diamond ever found in Botswana (a country that has become an emblem for responsible mining) and the third very large diamond discovered in Karowe.

The mine also produced the 813-carat Constellation, uncovered in 2015 and sold for $63 million to Nemesis International in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, a diamond trading company (in partnership with Swiss jeweler de Grisogono) and the Lesedi La Rona, discovered in 2016 and sold to Graff for $53 million.

When Lucara held a competition to name the Sewelo, 22,000 Botswana citizens submitted entries. ""Sewelo"" means ""rare find"" in Setswana.

Unlike the Constellation and the Lesedi, however, it is covered in carbon (at the moment it looks like a big lump of coal), which makes exactly what kind of diamond material is inside a ""mystery,"" according to Ulrika D'Haenens-Johansson, a senior research scientist at the Gemological Institute of America.

It also makes ""the risk that much greater,"" Pruwer said. When the stone was unearthed, there was a fair amount of speculation that it may be worth significantly less than its not-quite-as-giant siblings.

IMPURITIES HAVE VALUE

The profitability of any large stone depends on its yield: how many gem-quality carats can be gotten out of it once cut to maximize the price, which is, in turn, a function of the impurities in the stone -- though, as D'Haenens-Johansson points out, even the impurities have value in a stone this size. They can reveal when the diamond was created and at what depth in the earth.

The mine, which has examined the diamond through a tiny ""window"" in the coal and scanned it with lasers, describes the stone as ""near gem quality,"" with ""domains of high-quality white gem."" There are 10,000 gradations of diamonds, ranging from D-flawless (the rarest) to industrial stones used in cutting and manufacturing.

""Is it D or D-flawless, and how big is the flawless part? I don't know,"" Burke said, acknowledging that the purchase ""took a little bit of guts and trust in our expertise."" (To be fair, LVMH can afford it. Its revenues in 2018 were 46.8 billion euros, or $52 billion.)

Still, Post said, ""You don't buy a stone like that unless you have some plan for what you are going to do with it and some belief that there is enough clear material that you can cut it and make a profit.""

Burke said when he showed the stone to Bernard Arnault, the majority owner and chief executive of LVMH, and ""he had it in his hand, he smiled."" A smile from Arnault, a famously taciturn executive, is the equivalent of a scream of triumph from another chief executive.

EMBRACING THE RISK

After all, along with the potential profits, LVMH also bought the less quantifiable, but nevertheless palpable, bragging rights to the diamond in an industry in which mythology and romance are part of the price.

Burke said that when his team suggested that Vuitton consider buying the Sewelo, his initial reaction was: ""What took you so long?""

""It's a big, unusual stone, which makes it right up our alley,"" he said. It is also the first time Vuitton has bought a rough stone without having presold it to a client. (According to Pruwer, most branded fine jewelers buy stones that are already cut and polished.)

""We are experimenting with a different way of bringing a stone to market,"" said Burke, who said Vuitton would not cut the stone until it had a buyer and that the company did not plan to hang on to the stone as a showpiece, the way Tiffany has kept its 128.54-carat namesake stone.

Vuitton's partners in Antwerp are building a scanner able to see through the stone's coating, though with the imaging already in place, including a CT scan, they have estimated it could yield a 904-carat cushion-cut diamond, an 891-carat oval or several stones of between 100 and 300 carats.

As for the fact that the acquisition happened around the same time as the Tiffany acquisition, Burke said it was a coincidence. Yet he acknowledged, with some understatement, that LVMH ""typically likes to become leaders in whatever field we go into.""

And if the Sewelo doesn't prove to be quite as lucrative as LVMH is betting? ""I'll go jump in a river,"" Burke said.

The 37-year-old model made the announcement on Instagram, sharing a seaside selfie with the Berluti CEO (whose father, Bernard Arnault, is the chairman and chief executive officer of luxury conglomerate LVMH).

“This year has been beautiful and very memorable ??2020 here we come ?♥️? Can’t wait to celebrate next year with our loved ones @antoinearnault ????” Vodianova captioned the post, putting her pear-shaped diamond ring which appears to be set horizontally on full display.

Her followers and friends in the fashion industry were quick to congratulate the happy couple — who have been together since 2011 and share two sons (Maxim, 5 and Roman, 3) — in the comment section.

“Happy New Decade! Such a special year ahead for you and @antoinearnault. Enjoy every second! ❤️⭐️❤️,” one social media user wrote. Another said, “?wish u a lot of love and happiness for 2020 !❤️”

In addition to his work at Berluti, Arnault is the chairman of the Italian clothing company Loro Piana and the head of communications and image at LVMH.

The stylish pair typically attend fashion shows together, but otherwise keep a low-profile. However, in March, Arnault posted a sweet photo with the Russian model after an annual gala benefiting her charity, Naked Heart Foundation.

LVMH to shut store amid HK protest - Asia Times,"Mon, 06 Jan 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQGh0dHA6Ly9hc2lhdGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjAvMDEvbHZtaC10by1zaHV0LXN0b3JlLWFtaWQtaGstcHJvdGVzdC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Luxury brand Louis Vuitton is closing a major store in a high-end Hong Kong shopping centre often targeted by democracy protesters, local media reported.

The international retailer plans to shut its shop in the financial hub’s Times Square mall after its landlord, Wharf Real Estate Investment Corporation, refused to lower the rent, according to the South China Morning Post.

The store in the commercial heartland of Causeway Bay – one of the brand’s eight shopfronts in the city – occupies 920 square meters of prime second-floor space in the mall.

Monthly rent reportedly costs an estimated HK$5 millio-n (US$642,000), according to industry consultants.

The news of the potential closure came after the Hong Kong government released its latest retail sales figures, posting its 10th consecutive monthly drop in November 2019 and striking a year-on-year decline of over 23%.

Jewellery, watches, clocks and luxury gifts formed the most seriously hit category, with a year-on-year plunge of 43.5%.

The government blamed violent protests for disrupting tourism and affected consumption sentiments.

The Times Square mall has been a popular target of “Shop With You” rallies when protesters would gather to chant slogans and march, hoping to force shops to close down and impose economic pressure on the government.

In the third quarter last year, LVMH, the parent group of Louis Vuitton, reported a better-than-expected overall performance but a sales revenue drop of 25% in Hong Kong.

Luxury brands in Hong Kong have been relying heavily on a large influx of mainland Chinese tourists, which on the other hand has been a problem complained by local residents for years.

According to the latest figures released by the Hong Kong Tourism Board, only 2.65 million people visited in November 2019, a decline of 56% from the same period last year.

Hong Kong has been battered by protests for seven months, which from time to time fell into violent clashes between protesters and riot police.

The demonstration was first triggered by a proposal to allow extraditions to mainland China. It has morphed into a larger revolt for democratic freedom and against China’s control over the semi-autonomous city.

French fashion house Louis Vuitton just bought the second biggest — and largest uncut — diamond in the world, signalling a new era for the luxury brand. The news comes just months after its parent company, LVMH, announced its intention to buy American jewelry retailer Tiffany & Co. for $16.2 billion, Business Insider previously reported.

The 1,758-carat diamond, known as the Sewelo, is the largest rough (or uncut) diamond to have been discovered since 1905, Vanessa Friedman of The New York Times reported. The diamond was revealed in April 2019, given its name in July, then ""disappeared"" until the announcement earlier this month that Louis Vuitton had acquired it.

""Nobody expects us to put such an emphasis on high jewelry,"" said Michael Burke, chief executive of Louis Vuitton, according to the New York Times. ""I think it will spice things up a bit. Wake up the industry.""

The dance of the diamonds

Burke declined to reveal exactly how much the company paid for the diamond, though he said it was in the ""millions,"" the Times reports. The diamond was discovered in Botswana in 2019 and is still covered in its carbon composite.

The Times reports that Vuitton and its partners in Antwerp, Belgium, have already predicted the diamond will yield a 904-carat cushion-cut, an 891-carat Oval, or ""several stones"" between 100 and 300 carats. But, as noted by Lauren Indvik of the Financial Times, it could be months until experts figure out how to properly cut the rough stone.

""A gamble is only as big as your ignorance,"" Burke told the Financial Times. ""The more talent you have on your team the less of a gamble it is, and I believe we have the most talented team in the world.""

The high-end jewelry competition is kicking off

Although Burke said it was only a coincidence that this announcement follows the news of LVMH's Tiffany acquisition, it does not come at a unique time in the industry, when other fashion brands are also making the foray into the high-end jewelry market. Milena Lazazzera from Business of Fashion reports that, as the middle class continues to grow in developing countries ""sales of entry-level jewelry pieces are expected to balloon.""

""The past few years, however, have shown that the opportunity lies in entry-price lines, not six-figure pieces,"" Lazazzera reported. ""Products above $100,000, while important, typically represent just 5% to 20% of established jewelers' overall sales.""

Pucci Is Looking to the Moncler Model.

Taking cues from the outerwear brand's successful Genius project, the LVMH-owned house said Thursday it is pursuing a new creative strategy focused around a series of guest collaborations. First up: Koché's Christelle Kocher.

In recent years, Pucci has lacked direction. Since the exit of former creative director Massimo Giorgetti in April 2017, an internal design team has created collections for the runway. Now, it is looking to open its archives to ""creative voices,"" rather than appointing a singular creative director for the house.

Luxury brands are increasingly betting on collaborations and guest designers to keep consumers hooked. While collaborations are not a new idea, Moncler helped pioneer the concept of a constant pipeline of guest design talent. After the outerwear brand's sales took off, labels ranging from Tod's to Calvin Klein have attempted to mimic its approach, to varying degrees of success.

This could be a way to bring new ideas to a brand that has ... failed to blossom — so far — and develop its potential.

The Italian resort brand, best known for its use of bold, colourful prints was founded in 1947 by Emilio Pucci. LVMH acquired a 67 percent stake in 2000, but the label remained largely dormant for much of the next decade. In 2009, Peter Dundas was hired to help push Pucci beyond kaftans and vacationwear, and Alessandra Carra was appointed chief executive in 2011 with a mission to kickstart global growth.

Carra departed in 2014, and Dundas left a year later. The brand remains one of the smallest in LVMH's portfolio, though earlier this week Bernard Arnault, the conglomerate's chairman and chief executive, said he wasn't interested in selling it or other niche labels.

Pucci needs to change, but its lack of momentum may hinder its ability to capitalise on fresh creative talent, analysts say.

“This could be a way to bring new ideas to a brand that has remained too close to its roots, and has failed to blossom — so far — and develop its potential,” said Bernstein analyst Luca Solca. “The big difference with Moncler is that Genius came to Moncler compounding strong forward momentum. Pucci is static instead.”

Kocher, a former LVMH prize finalist, is tasked with creating a collection that includes ready-to-wear and accessories. It will debut during Milan Fashion Week in February and arrive in stores in September. The designer told BoF that the tie-up is meant as a one-off collaboration. In a statement, Pucci said the brand was drawn to Kocher for “her unique blend of couture and street.”

Kocher founded her label in 2015 and won the Andam Grand Prize last year. She is best known for her haute-meets-urban aesthetic and generated revenue of €3.7 million in 2018. Last year, the brand inked a licensing deal with OTB. Alongside her brand, Kocher is also the artistic director of Maison Lemarié, a couture atelier specialising in flowers, feathers and pleats, owned by Chanel subsidiary Paraffection.

“It’s a collaboration, but with a very old fashion house with a strong identity … the print, the colours, the history, the story,” Kocher told BoF. “I find it very interesting to do an exercise on a very historic house where Koché could bring important creativity [and] freshness.”

She said her collection will introduce new fabrics and shapes to the Pucci identity.

It's a collaboration, but with a very old fashion house with a strong identity: the print, the colours, the history, the story.

Pucci’s new strategy has had a mixed track record within the fashion industry. For Moncler, enlisting a mix of buzzy guest designers to design limited-edition monthly collections has generated enormous buzz on social media and driven renewed interest in the brand’s other offerings.

While just 10 percent of Moncler’s sales come from Genius collections, the strategy has helped introduce the brand to a younger demographic: now, 40 percent of brand customers are of the Gen Z and millennial generations. In addition, 50 percent of Genius customers are first-time purchasers of the brand, while 40 percent also purchased the brand’s other products. In the first nine months of 2019, revenue rose to €995.3 million, up 14 percent from a year earlier.

But the model isn't a plug-and-play solution that will guarantee results for all brands. Dior, one of LVMH's biggest brands, employs different designers for its men's and women's collections who frequently collaborate with outside brands and designers, often to great success. However, a Genius-like initiative adopted by Tod's has failed to deliver significant returns. Calvin Klein's collaboration programme, announced in May 2019 as inCKubator, has yet to materialise.

Whether Pucci’s approach will work depends on its ability to deliver desirable products and execute an effective marketing strategy. Moncler’s Genius project also worked well because every collaboration was centred around creatively reinterpreting its bread-and-butter product: the puffer jacket.

Emilio Pucci is, at its core, a ready-to-wear brand that shows seasonal collections at fashion week. But while it doesn’t have a business-driving hero product, it does have a heritage and strong creative identity rooted in vibrant prints — the Emilio Pucci archive houses over 20,000 of them.

""If you want to be a fashion authority, you are more or less linked to the idea of a single creative director with his specific fashion-forward vision,"" said Mario Ortelli, managing partner at Ortelli&Co. ""If you are a brand that is high-end luxury but is more focused on a specific product or on heritage, the Genius model is better because you keep newness continuously on the core attribute of the brand.""

As part of the move, the entrepreneur has sold her ownership shares to Kendo, the LVMH beauty incubator that is also responsible for Marc Jacobs Beauty and Fenty Beauty.



Going forward, Kendo will have complete control of all operations and the company will reportedly be rebranded as KVD Vegan Beauty.

After more than 12 drama-riddled years at the brand, Von D said her decision was motivated by wanting to spend more time on her vegan shoe line and her singing career.

""This past year has been one of great change for me,"" she said in a statement. ""As many of you know, I gave birth to my beautiful baby boy, launched my vegan shoe line and am now busy prepping to release my long-awaited album in the spring, followed by an international tour! As much as I wish I could balance all of this, on top of continuing my makeup line, it has become clear to me that I just can't do everything at the maximum capacity.This was not an easy decision, but after careful consideration, I decided I wanted the makeup line to continue to thrive and grow, and Kendo is primed to do just that.""

Launched in 2008, Kat Von D Beauty acquired a cult status over the years for its cruelty-free products, most notably liquid eyeliner and long lasting lipsticks.

Despite a successful run with products sold across 36 countries, Von D's brand faced a lot of criticism for the makeup artist's widely public beef with Jeffree Star, her controversial stance on vaccines, and accusations of anti-semitism by another tattoo artist during her short reality TV stint on Miami Ink.

Although she eventually clarified her position on almost all of the above in a lengthy YouTube video, the string of controversies has continued to follow her throughout her career. Her departure signals a fresh start for the brand."

Louis Vuitton Is Opening a Restaurant - WWD,"Thu, 23 Jan 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3dkLmNvbS9leWUvbGlmZXN0eWxlL2xvdWlzLXZ1aXR0b24tdG8tb3Blbi1yZXN0YXVyYW50LTEyMDM0NDc2MjQv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Breakfast at Tiffany’s — and dinner at Louis Vuitton?

LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton keeps diving deeper into the hospitality business and will open its first Vuitton café and restaurant next month at its new flagship boutique in Osaka, Japan, WWD has learned.

Michael Burke, chairman and chief executive officer of Vuitton, confirmed the development, and hinted that eateries and even hotels could be a future expansion avenue for the mega brand, which on Tuesday night unveiled the Sewelô, a 1,748-carat stone billed as the second-largest rough diamond ever discovered.

Separately, architect Peter Marino, who designs stores for Vuitton, Dior and other luxury brands, told WWD he would design the first Paris branch of Langosteria, a high-end seafood restaurant in Milan popular with the fashion crowd. It will be located on the seventh floor of La Samaritaine, the landmark department store slated to reopen in April as a showcase for LVMH businesses, including the group’s Cheval Blanc hotel, also designed by Marino.

The twin developments come as consumers continue to splash out on fine dining, holidays and other luxury experiences — and LVMH is making sure it carves itself a healthy slice.

Its historic Dior flagship boutique on Avenue Montaigne is currently undergoing a major renovation and will reopen with a restaurant among its new features.

And headlining LVMH’s acquisitions in the last 18 months were Tiffany, which opened the Blue Box Cafe at its Fifth Avenue flagship in 2018, and Belmond Ltd., which operates a portfolio of 46 luxury hotel, restaurant, train and river cruise properties in 24 countries.

““We think the so-called experiential luxury is something that will be important in the future,” Jean-Jacques Guiony, chief financial officer of LVMH, said at the time of the Belmond acquisition.

According to the most recent Altagamma Worldwide Luxury Market Monitor by Bain & Co., spending on gourmet food and fine dining rose 6 percent in 2019 at constant exchange, outpacing personal luxury goods, which posted a four percent uptick. Spending on luxury cruises gained 9 percent, private jets and yachts 5 percent, and fine wines and spirits 5 percent, the report said.

Le Café V will be located on the top floor of Vuitton’s new four-level Osaka maison, with a menu by celebrated Japanese chef Yosuke Suga, an adjoining bar and a generously sized terrace. Next to the bar will be Sugalabo V, serving only dinner to a lucky few via an open kitchen mirroring the Tokyo branch of Sugalabo.

The boutique, in a new building by architect Jun Aoki, is to open on Feb. 1, while the restaurants are to start serving on Feb. 15.

Vuitton conscripted Tokujin Yoshioka, who designs for its Objets Nomades of home and travel objects, to create a charger plate inspired by its famous monogram, which inspired the restaurant’s tableware, according to Vuitton.

While food and beverage has become an important traffic driver and revenue stream for shopping malls and department stores in particular, it’s still relatively new and untapped territory for top-tier luxury brands.

Marino, whose firm designed his first restaurant, The Lobster Club, located in the Seagram Building in New York City, hadn’t realized that his second eatery is also based on shellfish until a reporter told him so.

“Perhaps I just like claws,” he said, extending a hand covered in lethal-looking silver rings that run the length of his fingers.

The architect is partial to full Tom of Finland-worthy leather regalia and punned: “The next one is going to be the Mussel Bar.”

Marino is deeply involved in the design of the Cheval Blanc hotel opening in La Samaritaine, and another in development on and around Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills, Calif.

Zenith Kicks Off LVMH Watch Week With Tantalizing New Ladies Models - Haute Time,"Mon, 13 Jan 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhhdXRldGltZS5jb20vemVuaXRoLWtpY2tzLW9mZi1sdm1oLXdhdGNoLXdlZWstd2l0aC10YW50YWxpemluZy1uZXctbGFkaWVzLW1vZGVscy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Today is the start of the first edition of the LVMH Watch Week, in which the top brands of this luxury conglomerate present their newest watches in Dubai. For Zenith, the perfect opportunity to launch a completely new ladies watch; the Defy Midnight.



With this new creation does Zenith find the perfect balance between elegance and sportiveness. The watch features a 36mm stainless steel case with either a plain bezel or one set with diamonds. These precious gemstones can also be found as hour markers on the stunning dial, which is a real eye-catcher. Zenith gave the watches a vertical gradient effect with a glossy finish. As they are available in either grey or deep blue, it is like you are staring into the night sky. This is all the more interesting because this also puts the Zenith logo in its natural place. The Zenith star is accompanied by other stars, of which some will glow in the night, to complete the image of the celestial sky. There is also a third version available, in which Zenith applied the gradient effect to mother-of-pearl. This creates the effect as if you are looking at the clouds in the sky.



An automatic Elite-caliber powers all the new Zenith Defy Midnight watches. These movements are made in-house by Zenith and have a power reserve of 50 hours. The caliber can be admired through a glass caseback, where you will also see the star-shaped oscillating weight. The Defy Midnight is available on a stainless steel bracelet, but also on a variety of different colored straps.



While the revamped Elite Moonphase is technically a unisex watch, we believe that many women will be drawn to them. The classic dial with a guilloche motif features not only a small running seconds hand at nine o’clock but also a moon phase indicator at six. It gives this watch a timeless elegance. The Elite Moonphase is not only available in two different metals; stainless steel and rose gold, but also in two sizes. The 36mm version will probably be mainly favored by women, while the 40.5mm large Elite Moonphase will have no problem tempting men as well."

Louis Vuitton to Close Down Hong Kong Store

Cartier Opens Flagship Store On Alibaba’s Tmall

Amazon to Launch Luxury Portal Internationally

Louis Vuitton decided to shut down its store in Hong Kong Times Square mall after its landlord, Wharf Real Estate Investment Corporation, refused to lower the rent. The brand still has 7 stores in Hong Kong. It's also planning to open a new store at the Hong Kong international airport in 2021. However, analysts stressed that the store closing would still have a negative impact, with parent group LVMH accounting for about 6% of its €46.8 billion in revenue in 2018 from greater China.

Cartier, of Swiss luxury goods group Richemont, debuted their flagship store on Tmall. Consumers can not only purchase the entire line of Cartier, including jewelry, watch and accessories, they can also pre-order two new items — the new Juste un Clou bracelets and Guirlande de Cartier chain handbag ahead of other global markets. As an add-on service, consumers can enjoy engraving service and shop with interest-free installments. This is a step forward into the joint venture set between Alibaba and Richemont. In addition to Richemont, many brands from major luxury groups like Kering and LVMH have entered Tmall.

The new platform will be launched first in the United States and then to international markets. Photo: Shutterstock.

E-commerce platform Amazon plans to launch its own luxury fashion portal in the first half of 2020. It will first roll out in the United States and then to international markets. Brands can pay a certain percentage of sales to run their own mini-shops online. According to WWD , brands can fully control the appearance of their online space on the new platform. They can also use Amazon's vast logistics network for product distribution services. About 12 brands have already signed on.

This is not Amazon’s first attempt to enter the luxury fashion sphere. In December 2018, Amazon Global Stores announced the launch of the ""Fashion +"" project in China, further assisting Chinese fashion sellers to explore overseas fashion businesses and build their own brands through cross-border e-commerce exports. If Amazon can successfully enter the luxury market, this will undoubtedly be an important change. The e-commerce giant said previously that it has never given up on the category of high-end fashion brands."

With a year of LVMH mentorship and a €150,000 ($165,000 USD) grant under his belt, Mayner’s latest range is an extension of the louche looks he’s crafted over the past several seasons, moving even further beyond the conventions of Western dress.

Firms are also grappling with turmoil in Hong Kong, a key market where some have had to close stores during street protests, though many including LVMH have until now managed to offset losses there in mainland China and other regions.

LVMH, which posted record revenues and profits for the whole of 2019, said in a statement that fourth quarter sales rose 12% to 15.27 billion euros (13 billion pounds).

That marked an increase of 8% increase on a like-for-like basis, which strips out currency swings and acquisitions, and compared with forecasts cited by analysts and Reuters estimates of closer to 9% growth.

Like-for-like sales had grown 11% in the previous three months.

LVMH said that fourth quarter sales would have expanded at a faster pace without one-off effects, including a shopping spurt in Japan ahead of a sales tax hike which had led clients to bring forward purchases to the third quarter.

The Hennessy manufacturer said cognac stock shortages in the last three months of the year, an issue it regularly faces in the United States, had also had an impact on sales.

In LVMH’s core fashion and handbags division, home to Vuitton and other big brands such as Christian Dior, sales held up well in the quarter, expanding 15% on a like-for-like basis.

That was in line or a touch above some analysts’ forecasts.

Louis Vuitton plans to shut its shop in the financial hub's Times Square mall

HONG KONG, China – Luxury brand Louis Vuitton is closing a major store in a high-end Hong Kong shopping center often targeted by democracy protesters, local media reported.

The international retailer plans to shut its shop in the financial hub’s Times Square mall after its landlord, Wharf Real Estate Investment Corporation, refused to lower the rent, according to the South China Morning Post’s report Friday, January 3.

The store in the commercial heartland of Causeway Bay – one of the brand’s 8 shopfronts in the city – occupies 10,000 square feet of prime second-floor space in the mall.

Monthly rent reportedly costs an estimated HK$5 million (US$642,000) according to industry consultants.

Louis Vuitton Hong Kong, Times Square and Wharf have not responded to enquiries from AFP.

The news of the potential closure came after the Hong Kong government released its latest retail sales figures, posting its tenth consecutive monthly drop in November 2019 and striking a year-on-year decline of over 23 percent.

Jewellery, watches, clocks and luxury gifts formed the most seriously hit category, with a year-on-year plunge of 43.5 percent.

The government blamed violent protests for disrupting tourism and affected consumption sentiments.

The Times Square mall has been a popular target of “Shop With You” rallies when protesters would gather to chant slogans and march, hoping to force shops to close down and impose economic pressure on the government.

In the third quarter last year, LVMH, the parent group of Louis Vuitton, reported a better-than-expected overall performance but a sales revenue drop of 25 percent in Hong Kong.

Luxury brands in Hong Kong have been relying heavily on a large influx of mainland Chinese tourists, which on the other hand has been a problem complained by local residents for years.

According to the latest figures released by the Hong Kong Tourism Board, only 2.65 million people visited in November 2019, a decline of 56 percent from the same period last year.

Hong Kong has been battered by protests for 7 months, which from time to time fell into violent clashes between protesters and riot police.

The demonstration was first triggered by a proposal to allow extraditions to mainland China. It has morphed into a larger revolt for democratic freedom and against China’s control over the semi-autonomous city. – Rappler.com"

He won the Karl Lagerfeld prize (formerly the Special Jury Prize, renamed to honor the iconic visionnaire Karl Lagerfeld who sadly passed away on February 19, 2019) at the LVMH awards which were founded in 2014. Each year, a young fashion designer is selected to win the award for their talent and creativity by a committee of industry professionals. This year, the LVMH prize was awarded to the South African designer Thebe Magugu.

Hed Mayner founded his brand in 2015

The 33 year old designer is by no means a newcomer in the world of fashion. Born in Amuka, Northern Israel, he began his studies at the Bezalel School of Fine Arts in Jerusalem, before flying to Paris where he studied and graduated from the French Institute of Fashion. There he was granted the opportunity to enhance his aesthetic, and reinforce his knowledge of body language. His unisex brand, founded in 2015, was inspired by his heritage, with a collection of pieces that are at once structured and fluid. Influenced by traditional orthodox Jewish tailoring, his collection juxtaposes military-style looks with an undeniably timeless, spiritual aura. After being awarded the Karl Lagerfeld prize, Hed Mayner spoke to Vogue Hommes: “I take very classic elements from the mens wardrobe and give them a new shape and a new life, kind of like a parallel reality”."
Louis Vuitton has bought the world's second-largest diamond - GQ India,"Wed, 22 Jan 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdxaW5kaWEuY29tL2dldC1zbWFydC9jb250ZW50L2xvdWlzLXZ1aXR0b24tYm91Z2h0LXRoZS13b3JsZHMtc2Vjb25kLWxhcmdlc3QtZGlhbW9uZC1pbi10aGUtd29ybGTSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Recently, Bernard Arnault, the CEO of LVMH became the third richest person in the world. And now, news has surfaced that Louis Vuitton has bought the Sewelô, the second-largest diamond in the world. It’s a 1,758-carat diamond, which is roughly the size of a tennis ball. And to put things in perspective, the Koh-i-Noor is a mere 105.6 carat diamond.

On Tuesday, the company announced its partnership with the Lucara Diamond Corporation and the HB Company of Antwerp to transform this extremely rare diamond.

Where did Louis Vuitton find the second-largest diamond in the world?

This 1,758-carat diamond was recovered last year at the Lucara Diamond Corporation-owned Karowe mine in Botswana. It has been named the Sewelô, which means a rare find in the Setswana language. However, the price the company paid to acquire this diamond remains unknown.

The Sewelô is the second largest rough diamond to have been discovered and the largest to come out of Botswana. The largest rough diamond in the world is the Cullinan, which is 3,106-carats and is a part of the British Crown Jewels and royal collection. The Sewelô is roughly the size of a tennis ball and measures 83mm x 62mm x 46mm. Weighing 352 grams, this diamond managed to remain unbroken thanks to Lucara’s high-tech XRT circuit that avoids crushing the diamond bearing rock.

This beautiful stone is covered with a thin layer of black carbon, under which it holds the 2-billion-year-old secrets hiding within it. But, the full extent of variations in colour and clarity of the diamond yield is still unknown. However, LV will now collaborate with master diamond cutters, which is none other than the HB Company from Antwerp to study the Sewelô and its intricacies.

What will Louis Vuitton do with the Sewelô diamond?

Once a complete analysis has been carried out, the Sewelô will be used for producing made-to-order Louis Vuitton Cut diamonds, in the shape of its emblematic monogram. According to the company, “In a characteristically barrier-breaking initiative of innovation and individuality, Louis Vuitton plans to use the extraordinary variety and abundance within the Sewelô to offer clients the opportunity to create bespoke, custom-cut diamonds.”

This means, that probably in a year or so, you could own a piece of jewellery made from a diamond found in Botswana and carefully crafted by one of the biggest fashion brands in the world. All you need is a lot of money!

Why Billionaire Investor Warren Buffett Passed on the Chance to Buy Tiffany & Co. - Robb Report,"Thu, 02 Jan 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vcm9iYnJlcG9ydC5jb20vc3R5bGUvamV3ZWxyeS93aHktd2FycmVuLWJ1ZmZldC1wYXNzZWQtb24tdGhlLWNoYW5jZS10by1idXktdGlmZmFueS1jby0yODkwNzM4L9IBamh0dHBzOi8vcm9iYnJlcG9ydC5jb20vc3R5bGUvamV3ZWxyeS93aHktd2FycmVuLWJ1ZmZldC1wYXNzZWQtb24tdGhlLWNoYW5jZS10by1idXktdGlmZmFueS1jby0yODkwNzM4L2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"When LVMH bought Tiffany & Co. for a staggering $16.2 billion late last year, it was widely reported that the famous American jewelry brand turned down the luxury group’s initial offer because it was deemed too low. But it turns out that delay may have been caused by none other than Warren Buffett.

In a new interview published in the Financial Times, the renowned business titan and fourth richest person on Earth revealed that he passed on the opportunity to take over Tiffany & Co. wholesale. Buffett has a history investing in the company but ultimately decided against buying the business in its entirety.

Buffett’s investment firm Berkshire Hathaway has a staggering $128.2 billion in cash on hand, and Buffett alone is worth just shy of $90 billion—so lack of funds was not the reason Buffett didn’t pull the trigger on this deal. Buffett bought $250 million worth of Tiffany’s bonds in 2009, in the midst of the financial crisis no less, so the company turned to him after Bernard Arnault’s LVMH made an initial offer. It was one he ultimately refused, causing the brand to circle back to LVMH which sealed the deal.

Turning the proposal down might seem surprising at first given Buffett’s clear interest in Tiffany & Co., but it is in keeping with the philosophy that has guided many of his investing decisions. In Berkshire Hathaway’s 2018 report, he wrote, “In recent years, the sensible course for us to follow has been clear: Many stocks have offered far more for our money than we could obtain by purchasing businesses in their entirety. The companies in which we invested offered excellent value, far exceeding that available in takeover transactions.”

Berkshire Hathaway remains a significant stakeholder in several large corporations, including Apple and Coca-Cola, but hasn’t made a bid for an entire business since it bought Precision Castparts in 2015. When a diverse portfolio not only creates greater financial security but also means not having to actually run a company, why bother?

WATCH

LVMH is moving ahead quickly with its plans to revamp Tiffany after a period of lukewarm growth, but we’ll always wonder what the brand would like if it was operated by the Oracle of Omaha."

For the first time ever, the LVMH Group has organised the exclusive event to complement the traditional Swiss watch industry shows happening at the end of April and beginning of May.

Together with LVMH Maisons Bvlgari, Hublot, TAG Heuer and Zenith, the LVMH Watch Week showcased new timepieces, while providing a platform for dialogue with the CEOs and other executives of the Maisons in a truly exceptional setting of the largest establishment in the Bvlgari hotel collection.

Here, we recap some of our favourite launches from each brand during the LVMH Watch Week from January 13 to 15.

Bvlgari Octo Finissimo Minute Repeater

The record-breaking collection once again rewrites the rules of contemporary watches with new innovative finishes for its five newest models, especially the Octo Finissimo Minute Repeater in rose gold.

Powered by the BVL 362 caliber, an ultra-thin 3.12mm Mechanical Manufacture Minute Repeater movement with manual winding, the follow-up to the 2016 debut in titanium is dressed in sandblasted rose gold via an impeccable feat of technical and aesthetic expertise: the hour markers and the seconds counter at 6 o’clock on the dial showcase an incised, cut-out design; the openings serve to amplify resonance inside the case, optimising the sound effect.

Honorary Mention:

Bvlgari Octo Finissimo Automatic in Black Sandblast-Polished Ceramic

This new rendition features a sandblast-polished ceramic case, dial and bracelet – a new signature monochromatic look, which alternates between the matte and brilliant surfaces, reflecting light. Bvlgari has also achieved the case’s extraordinary thinness in fine ceramic with the help of the Roman Jeweller’s daring and delicate touch.

Hublot Big Bang Integral

2020 marks the 15th anniversary of the Big Bang, and Hublot embraces the milestone by fitting the brand’s iconic timepiece with a tailored integrated bracelet that sits perfectly against the skin.

A visual harmony resulting from absolute proportions, the aesthetic signature of the bracelet is powerful enough for it to be instantly associated with that of the Big Bang: the sharp style of the one-central-two-lateral links adopts the codes of the case, with edges that not only echo the aesthetic of the pushers, but also the architecture of the middle with is cut-outs.

The Hublot Big Bang Integral consists of three models: 500-piece limited edition All Black version, dedicated to the “invisible visibility” concept introduced in 2006; 500-piece lightweight titanium, hard-wearing, scratch-proof ceramic; and King Gold, an exclusive-to-Hublot alloy of intensely red 18-carat gold from the catalyst of gold, copper and platinum.

Honorary Mention:

Hublot Spirit of Big Bang Rainbow

Like a modern alchemist, Hublot has enshrouded the beginning of 2020 with good omens with the Spirit of Big Bang Rainbow, in which the soft shade of the cases in King Gold takes on the colours of the rainbow, with a shimmering paving of round and baguette-cut gemstones.

Reigniting the success of the Spirit of Big Bang collection with a design directly inspired by the Big Bang with a barrel shape, the Spirit of Big Bang Rainbow comes in a unique case construction that enables an infinite number of combinations of materials and colours: the hour hand for the 42mm version clasps the chronograph skeleton movement like the claws of a precious setting; whereas the gemstone-covered dial of the 39mm model sparkles reflections from the sapphires, rubies, topazes, tsavorites and amethysts.

TAG Heuer Carrera 160 Years Silver Limited Edition

TAG Heuer turns 160 this year!

The Swiss luxury watchmaker has definitely come a long way since it was just known as Heuer in 1860, founded by Edouard Heuer in Saint-Imier, Switzerland. And leading the year-long tributes and celebrations is TAG Heuer’s most elegant chronographs that has carried the brand’s racing heritage and daring spirit through the decades: the TAG Heuer Carrera.

With a design from the 1960s, powered by a 21st century watchmaking innovation, the 160 Years Silver Limited Edition will be available worldwide from June onwards with only 1,860 pieces.

The new stainless-steel chronograph features many of the same design highlights as its predecessor, but in a 39mm case instead of the original 36mm alongside other design codes: the permanent second indicator is at 6 o’clock instead of at 9 o’clock, due to the difference in the construction of the Valjoux 72 from 1963, and today’s Heuer 02 movement; and the shape of the central hour and minute hands are now facetted and coated with beige SuperLuminova.

Zenith El Primero A384 Revival

After celebrating its 50th anniversary last year, Zenith has given the A384 – the first model to be equipped with the ground breaking movement in 1969 – a new and daring facelift.

The El Primero A384 Revival is fitted with a “ladder” bracelet of an unusual open design that boasts superior comfort, and a dressier look compared to other sporty steel bracelets of the time. (Zenith has sought the expertise of the famed Gay Frères specialist company to create an original and exclusive bracelet that would match the watch’s avant-garde design). Together with the grand return of the coveted Ladder bracelet, you could say that the A384 Revival is a truly “retro” timepiece in aesthetic and function.

Honorary Mention:

Zenith Pilot Type 20 Chronograph Rescue

A collection of timepieces that has been using a combination of aged case materials and textured coloured dials to emulate an early 20th century look, Zenith revisits its iconic Pilot’s Watch to offer the utility of a modern instrument with all the analogue charm of the past.

The Pilot Type 20 Chronograph Rescue carries a stainless steel case with a slate-grey sunray dial, showcasing the signature oversized Arabic numerals made entirely out of Super-LumiNova (a recurring colour in the world of aircrafts). The aged black calfskin leather strap recalls the classic shearling leather flight jacket, alongside a distinctive tab reminiscent of those seen on vintage pilot helmets."

Arriving soon in Berry and Glacier, the former dreams of the deep purple hills that run over Iceland’s Hvalfjörður fjord, while the latter draws from the Iceland’s crisp blue hues.

For fans of the new Berry colorway, your options are RIMOWA’s Essential Cabin, Essential Check-In L and Essential Trunk Plus models only. Or if you’re leaning towards Glacier instead, your options are the same three Essential models, and for the first time, the first alternate colorway for the Essential Lite range, including Essential Lite Cabin, Essential Lite Check-In L and Essential Lite Kids.

Essential Lite is RIMOWA’s lightest suitcase, weighing 30% less than Essential without compromising on the durability. The other notable difference between the two lies where the color runs throughout the exterior, handle, zipper, badge and wheel housing for Essential, it only runs throughout the exterior and badge for Essential Lite — see below for comparison.

In addition, the popular Saffron and Slate colorways from 2019 will be making a comeback to round off the upcoming drop.

The launch date in RIMOWA stores and online for this season’s colorways for both Essential and Essential Lite is January 23 for USA and Europe, while Singapore and Australia will see a later release in early February, with pricing as follows:

RIMOWA Essential

Cabin: $640 USD

William Belo dreamed of owning a house and building his own business when he was a kid. Forty years later, his company, Wilcon Depot is dominating the home improvement and construction supplies industry in the Philippines with 57 stores and plans to expand to 100. Belo, 72, started the business in 1977 with $1,945. Wilcon has made Belo a very wealthy man, but it is his side hustle that has caught the attention of luxury brands, including LVMH. Belo, after starting basically the Home Depot of the Philippines, decided to get into crocodile farming.

Belo wanted to have a farm with a small number of animals and fresh eggs for his family. One thing led to another and his chicken population got out of control and he had to find a way to deal with the chickens that were no longer able to lay eggs. In the mid-1990s he considered feeding them to tigers and then he heard about a crocodile conservation farm in the province of Palawan that was looking to sell some of its crocodiles. Belo bought 1,200 crocodiles.

Today, he breeds crocodiles and has 23,000 of them. He's also found better uses for his crocs than just having them eat the chickens. Their skins are sold to luxury brands including LVMH and their meat is in a number of food products, including Hungarian sausages and sisig, a popular Filipino dish. He sells the crocodile food products under the brand name Dundee, in tribute to the 1986 movie Crocodile Dundee.

Belo has two crocodile farms, a 24.7 acre one for breeding and one that is seven times larger. He now has about 800,000 chickens and 5,000 hogs and sells 2,000 to 3,000 crocodile skins annually for $200 to $250 each. That's $500,000 a year on the low end. The price of croc skin has actually dropped recently due to oversupply causing less demand for luxury products using the reptile skin. Chinese consumers make up half of the global demand for high-end handbags. Lately, there has been less demand for these bags.

Belo studied engineering at the University of Santo Tomas in Manila. In the evenings, he worked at a construction supply company of which his father was partial owner. He opened his first store in a tiny space in 1977. Today, Wilcon Depot is the leading retailer in the home improvement market in the Philippines. Belo handed the reigns of the company over to his daughter Lorraine in 2016, but he still goes to the office five days a week, overseeing the business as chairman emeritus. This gives him more time to relax and to pursue his crocodile farming business.

Between Wilcon and the crocodile farming Belo has become a billionaire with a net worth of $1 billion. Shares of Wilcon have risen 41% this year. Wilcon sells everything from plumbing fixtures to faucets, to tiles. It expects to have 65 stores next year and 100 by 2025."
