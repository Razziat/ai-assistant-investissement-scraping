LVMH Lands Deal to Create Rihanna Makeup - WWD,"Thu, 14 Apr 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiO2h0dHBzOi8vd3dkLmNvbS9mZWF0dXJlL2x2bWgtcmloYW5uYS1tYWtldXAtYnJhbmQtMTA0MDk2NzAv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The Kendo division of LVMH Moët Hennesy Louis Vuitton has landed a deal with Rihanna, one of the hottest-selling celebrities in the world of licensing, to do a complete makeup collection.

As one veteran cosmetics executive observed, “everything with her is off the charts.”

Estimates of what LVMH may have paid to make the deal run as high as $10 million.

Kendo, which functions as an incubator producing products that end up being retailed by LVMH’s Sephora perfumery chain and other outposts, will launch a Rihanna makeup range, called Fenty Beauty by Rihanna, in the fall of 2017.

While the company provided no other details, David Suliteanu, chief executive officer of Kendo, was in a celebratory mood. “Fenty Beauty by Rihanna is a beauty rocket ship that will appeal to a huge and diverse global audience,” he said. “We are aiming for the stars.”

That is exactly where the Rihanna brand tends to orbit. As an entertainer, the 28-year-old singer is the youngest solo artist to have 14 number-one singles on the Billboard Hot 100 and she has spent 58 weeks on the top of the chart. So far, Rihanna has sold more than 54 million albums and 215 million singles worldwide. Her tally of awards includes eight Grammys, 12 Billboard Music Awards and nine American Music Awards. Her latest album, “Anti,” was released in January to strong sales.

As far as image goes, Rihanna received a Fashion Icon Award from CFDA in 2014.

“Kendo is honored to work with Rihanna,” Suliteanu concluded.

She previously has collaborated in 2013 with MAC Cosmetics on a four-part, limited-edition RiRi Hearts MAC color cosmetics collection, and she also represented Viva Glam lipstick in 2014 to raise funds for AIDS research.

She has produced seven fragrances for Parlux Ltd. and the relationship continues. The latest one, RiRi, was launched in fall 2015. During a promotional appearance at Macy’s in Brooklyn, the star raised $46,000 in an afternoon. Although the celebrity fragrance category is decidedly on the wane, Rihanna’s star seems to burn brighter than ever. Industry sources estimate that Rihanna’s Parlux fragrances, as a group, generate about $75 million in wholesale net shipments. In addition to the U.S., her fragrance business is said to be particularly strong in the U.K. and Europe.

“Our Rihanna business continues to flourish,” said Diana Espino, global vice president of marketing and brand development. Adding that Rihanna remains on top of the celebrity heap, Espino said the reason is because “what she produces has the authenticity of a fashion icon and an entertainment trendsetter. She is really a developer,” she noted, that in an era of social media transparency, “the consumer knows it.”

The Rihanna makeup brand will be the third major color cosmetics project that Kendo has undertaken, following those by Kat Von D Beauty and Marc Jacobs Beauty.

Kendo has given Rihanna the opportunity to play a key role in the development of her brand and the longevity of a long-term relationship. The company also offers a deep bench of development talent and a global reach in distribution. In markets where there are no Sephora stores, other, suitable retailers will be found."
"LVMH Q1 sales miss; France struggles, Asia 'varied' - CNBC","Tue, 12 Apr 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tLzIwMTYvMDQvMTIvbHZtaC1xMS1zYWxlcy1taXNzLWZyYW5jZS1zdHJ1Z2dsZXMtYXNpYS12YXJpZWQuaHRtbNIBWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tL2FtcC8yMDE2LzA0LzEyL2x2bWgtcTEtc2FsZXMtbWlzcy1mcmFuY2Utc3RydWdnbGVzLWFzaWEtdmFyaWVkLmh0bWw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"A shopper looks at the window display of a Louis Vuitton store, operated by LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SA.

Rising champagne sales in Europe and demand for high-end perfume and watches help boost sales at LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton by 3.5 percent in the first quarter.

The luxury group, whose broad holdings include Kenzo and Givenchy fashion houses and Dior perfumes, on Monday reported 8.62 billion euros ($9.8 billion) in revenue for the period.

That was up from 8.3 billion euros in the first quarter of 2015, but slightly below an 8.73 billion euros forecast by analysts polled by financial information company FactSet.

While cosmetics and alcohol sales grew — especially U.S. sales of Hennessy cognac — fashion and leather revenue was flat. The company warned that Asian markets are ""varied"" and the home market France has struggled from a drop in tourism since deadly attacks last year."
LVMH boss hits back at 'extreme leftists' over depiction in film - The Guardian,"Thu, 14 Apr 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy8yMDE2L2Fwci8xNC9sdm1oLWJvc3MtY3JpdGljaXNlcy1leHRyZW1lLWxlZnQtb3Zlci1maWxt0gFcaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAudGhlZ3VhcmRpYW4uY29tL2J1c2luZXNzLzIwMTYvYXByLzE0L2x2bWgtYm9zcy1jcml0aWNpc2VzLWV4dHJlbWUtbGVmdC1vdmVyLWZpbG0?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"France’s richest man, Bernard Arnault, the chief executive of luxury goods conglomerate LVMH, has hit back at a blockbuster documentary in which the little guys take him on – and end up laughing all the way to the bank.

Merci Patron! (Thanks boss!) tells the story of an unemployed middle-aged couple in one of France’s poorest towns so desperately in debt that they consider burning their home. In the film, former textile workers Jocelyne and Serge Klur not only take on Arnault after he “ruined their lives” by delocalising their jobs to Poland – they also make him pay.

It has been playing to packed cinemas, with audiences cheering in the aisles. But Arnault has not, it seems, seen the funny side. “For many years now, for 20 years, we have been the object of criticism by groups from the extreme left. We are used to this kind of criticism,” Arnault told a shareholders meeting of the world’s biggest luxury goods company.

Asked by a shareholder to give his opinion on the film, Arnault said that was difficult because he hadn’t seen it. But he said: “LVMH is the illustration, the incarnation of the worst, according to these extreme-leftist observers, of what the market economy produces.”

Switching to irony, he said: “We have it all wrong. First of all we are a big company in the CAC 40 [stock market index], we have strong results and we’re making things worse for ourselves by hiring people. When I took over at the company we were 20,000 and now we are 120,000.”

LVMH’s annual shareholders meeting features in the film when the jobless couple threaten to disrupt the meeting with a “crack squad” of trade union militants if Arnault doesn’t give Serge Klur a job in a supermarket.

The film’s director, Francois Ruffin, attempted to disrupt the meeting in 2014 to bring attention to the couple’s plight, after buying shares in LVMH, and shareholders at last year’s annual meeting complained to Arnault of the heavy police presence, with riot police searching them at the entrance.

Protesters demonstrating against reforms of France’s labour laws have taken up the film’s title as a slogan on marches and sung its “Merci Patron!” theme song – a 1970s comic skit urging bosses and workers to swap places.

Until Thursday the billionaire had remained tightlipped about the affair, with nobody at LVMH – which owns Dior, Givenchy and Louis Vuitton – willing to comment to AFP.

Arnault sparked the wrath of the French left in 2012 when he applied for Belgian nationality after the government proposed higher taxes on the rich, prompting the Libération newspaper to run the front page headline: “Clear off, rich loser!”

Like its protagonists, the film faced an against-the-odds battle to get made, losing half of its tiny budget when state funding was withdrawn “without explanation” at the last minute.

Some 230,000 people have seen the film, which cost €40,000 to make, since it hit cinemas in February. French culture magazine Telerama said this put it on course to become the most profitable French film of the year.

Some cinemagoers felt Arnault did not actually come over too badly in the film.

“Arnault is the bad guy of course – and the sting is at his expense – but he doesn’t come out of it all bad. He clearly has some kind of a conscience,” said John Baxter, an American who saw the film in Paris.

“Most American business leaders would not give these people the time of day.”"
LVMH signs Rihanna to create “Fenty Beauty by Rihanna” - New York Daily News,"Thu, 14 Apr 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55ZGFpbHluZXdzLmNvbS8yMDE2LzA0LzE0L2x2bWgtc2lnbnMtcmloYW5uYS10by1jcmVhdGUtZmVudHktYmVhdXR5LWJ5LXJpaGFubmEv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Fresh off her collaboration with Puma shoes, Rihanna is ready to release a line of cosmetics called Fenty Beauty by Rihanna.

The new products come with the help of a major luxury conglomerate, Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton, or “LVMH.”

The only catch when it comes to the costmetics? You’ll have to wait until Fall 2017 to get your hands on them.

RIHANNA TALKS MANOLO BLAHNIK COLLECTION

The songstress has mentioned in the past her desire to dive into the beauty biz with her own line. And according to a Women’s Wear Daily report, the Kendo division of LVMH was lucky enough to seal the deal with her for what’s reportedly as much as $10 million.

The chief executive officer of Kendo, David Suliteanu, cheerfully boasted to WWD. He gave little detail but much praise, saying, “Fenty Beauty by Rihanna is a beauty rocket ship that will appeal to a huge and diverse global audience. We are aiming for the stars.”

The optimistic outlook isn’t without reason. Rihanna proved herself one of the globe’s biggest recording artists with the release of her latest album, “Anty,” in January to strong sales.

Fenty Beauty by Rihanna will be the third major color cosmetics project that Kendo has undertaken, following the successful Kat Von D Beauty and Marc Jacobs Beauty brands.

But her superstar reach extends way beyond music. In 2014 the Council of Fashion Designers of America awarded her a Fashion Icon Award, praising her trendsetting style. Her buzzworthy collaborations with Puma have been the talk of the town ever since being named brand ambassador and women’s creative director in 2014. Her latest Fenty x Puma furry slides, which are set to go on sale April 22 for $80, have been grabbing headlines for being the hottest funky fashion statement of the season.

This isn’t even Rihanna’s first time working on cosmetics. In 2013 she partnered with MAC for the limited-edition RiRi Hearts MAC collection featuring a variety of sultry shades for lips, shadowy eye palletes, and soft neutral face makeup that retailed between $16.50-$44. She currently continues to produce a number of successful fragrances for Parlux Ltd.,the latest being RiRi by Rihanna which costs up to $60, and boasts an especially strong presence overseas.

Fenty Beauty by Rihanna will be the third major color cosmetics project that Kendo has undertaken, following the successful Kat Von D Beauty and Marc Jacobs Beauty brands. Prices have yet to be announced, but fellow celebrity turned beauty favorite Kat von D’s line of cosmetics sells in Sephora locations for an estimated $10 to $70. So until announcements are made, one can only hope Rihanna’s line will share a similar, budget-friendly range.

Further details are expected to be announced on kendobrand.com.

First, Rimmel London signs Cara Delevingne and blogger Aimee Song scores a partnership with Laura Mercier, and now the biggest news yet drops. Rihanna has teamed up with LVMH to create her very own comprehensive makeup line, according to WWD.

While many details are still unknown, a few things are certain. The brand will be called Fenty Beauty, and it won’t launch until the fall of 2017. It’s safe to bet the next year and a half will be used wisely by Kendo — the company that produces products to be sold by LVMH’s Sephora and other stores — making sure every product and detail is perfect.

RiRi’s off-the-charts appeal is pretty universal, and she’s no stranger to beauty statements as bold as her fashion choices (which won her the CFDA Fashion Icon Award in 2014), making a makeup line a safe bet. Hopefully there’s some blue lipstick in there. The chameleonic singer also has collaborated with MAC Cosmetics in the past, representing Viva Glam in 2014, and even launched her own styling, hair and makeup agency, Fr8me, last year. As for her seven fragrances, WWD reported that, together, they generate about $75 million in wholesale net shipments.

David Suliteanu, CEO of Kendo, which also produces Marc Jacobs Beauty and Kat Von D’s makeup line, said, “Fenty Beauty by Rihanna is a beauty rocket ship that will appeal to a huge and diverse global audience. We’re aiming for the stars.” And, apparently, the superstar will play a key role in brand development in the long term. Next fall is a ways off, but surely Rihanna will drop some teasers along the way — she knows how to make it worth the wait."
Bernard Arnault on Smartwatches — and Why LVMH Is Reviled by the Far Left - WWD,"Thu, 14 Apr 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3dkLmNvbS9mYXNoaW9uLW5ld3MvZGVzaWduZXItbHV4dXJ5L2x2bWgtYmVybmFyZC1hcm5hdWx0LXZ1aXR0b24tZmVuZGktdGFnLWhldWVyLWZhci1sZWZ0LTEwNDEwMDc2L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS — Meet Bernard Arnault, the world’s most overqualified watch salesman.

Addressing shareholders at LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton’s annual general meeting here Thursday, the luxury giant’s chairman and chief executive officer flashed his Tag Heuer Connected model, developed in conjunction with Intel Corp. and Google and released last November.

Holding out his wrist, he boasted how it is outselling other, more hyped smartwatches — hint: the Apple iWatch, although he didn’t name names.

“What’s more, it actually looks like a watch,” he said, eliciting a round of chuckles from the hundreds gathered at the Carrousel du Louvre.

His pitch for Tag’s $1,500 timepiece — cited as an example of the group’s commitment to innovation — prompted additional queries about its functions, which France’s richest man gamely fielded, explaining how it is essentially an extension of his mobile phone, allowing him to discreetly glance at incoming messages, stock prices and other information. The importance of the product was exhibited by Arnault’s turning out for its worldwide launch in New York last November, where he beamed at the news that customers were already lining up at the Tag store down the street to buy it.

“You can also load your music on to it, and if you jog, you can run without carrying your telephone and listen to your music using Bluetooth-enabled headphones,” said Arnault in his sales spiel for the watch on Thursday, adding that the device also monitors vital functions like heart rate. “And the new version will be even stronger.”

In a lively, upbeat address, Arnault trumpeted the resilience of the family-controlled luxury group, characterizing its solid performance in 2015 as a logical consequence of its commitment to creating desirable, high-quality products loaded with “practical creativity.”

To wit: He divulged that Louis Vuitton would this summer introduce a new and “very innovative” suitcase “made with all the savoir faire of this maison.”

According to market sources, Marc Newson collaborated with Vuitton on the new travel item. The celebrated industrial designer created a backpack for the brand in 2014 as it marked its 160th anniversary with a series of pricey one-offs in its monogrammed canvas.

During the meeting, Arnault also broke his silence about a controversial and popular “Roger & Me”-style French documentary currently in theaters. Titled “Merci Patron,” or “Thanks, Boss,” in English, the film chronicles the struggles of a couple who lose their jobs at a Kenzo suit factory when production is moved to Eastern Europe. The filmmaker and journalist François Ruffin takes Arnault to task for their plight — despite the fact that the French group hired 27,000 people last year.

“Listen, it’s hard to give my opinion on the film, as I haven’t seen it,” Arnault mused before a rapt room. “But we’ve been the target of criticism from far-left parties for more than 20 years. It’s quite surprising; I’ve often wondered why. I think the answer is quite simple: The LVMH Group is the incarnation of — at least for these far-left observers — the worst that a liberal economy has produced.

“We have all the flaws. First, we are a big CAC 40 company — that’s very detrimental. On top of it, we have good results and that makes it worse. Thirdly, we hire staff — in France even, and long-term — and that’s appalling. When I first arrived at the head of this group, we had 20,000 employees and today we are at 120,000. That’s very bad, according to them. And, lastly, we illustrate globalization’s benefits for France, that’s the absolute catastrophe…and so that is the reason why, in my opinion, we have been the subject of this kind of criticism,” Arnault concluded dryly, rewarded with a burst of applause.

Flanked by giant images of Hollywood stars Johnny Depp and Alicia Vikander — the faces of Dior’s Sauvage fragrance and Louis Vuitton’s fashions, respectively — Arnault trumpeted how his group’s “unique and diversified” portfolio of brands — spanning liquors, beauty products, leather goods and even hotels — has proven a “considerable advantage” over rival luxury firms and given it stability against a volatile economic and geopolitical backdrop.

He touted Fendi’s revamped Rome flagship, set in a five-story palazzo with a boutique hotel and rooftop Zuma restaurant, as the most-visited store in the Eternal City; lauded the talent of 30-year-old Jonathan Anderson, creative director of Loewe and “a revelation among the new wave of designers,” and waxed poetic about the raw materials employed by Loro Piana, acquired by the group in 2013 for 1.99 billion euros.

“Quality is at the center of our preoccupations. It explains the success of our products,” he said, reprising a common theme of his annual address: “We are not a marketing-driven company.”

At the meeting, chief financial officer Jean-Jacques Guiony reviewed LVMH’s 2015 results, touting record revenue, cash flow and operating profits.

There was no mention — and no questions from the floor — about LVMH’s ho-hum results for the first quarter of 2016, when sales growth in the cash-cow fashion and leather goods division stalled due to discontinued collections at Donna Karan and Marc Jacobs, plus a steep decline in tourist flows to Paris in the wake of the terror attacks last November. Earlier in the week, Guiony said sales at Vuitton stores in the French capital had declined double-digits in the first three months of the year.

Yet Arnault was bullish on Vuitton’s legacy of leather goods savoir faire, and its reputation for made-in-France handbags. “Fashion at Louis Vuitton is an accessory,” he said.

He also let slip a few numbers, even though the group never breaks out the financial performance of individual brands.

Discussing Sephora, he boasted that the beauty chain would soon be the largest distributor of cosmetics in the U.S., whereas a decade ago, some luxury analysts and shareholders were calling for LVMH to dispose of the retailer.

“It develops, including online, with great success and the turnover is very important, between 500 million and one billion [euros], with excellent profitability, which is rare on the Internet,” he said.

Discussing Dior’s Sauvage, which he hailed as the number-one men’s scent in many markets, he asserted that Dior is “the most famous French name in the world” and that its fashion and fragrance businesses are now in the range of five billion euros, or $5.63 billion at current exchange.

The executive also highlighted the importance of digital innovation going forward, telegraphed this week when LVMH revealed it is a principle sponsor of Viva Technology Paris, a new trade event this summer that will spotlight 5,000 start-ups.

“We have high hopes — and in any case a strong will — for the digital orientation of the group,” Arnault said, trumpeting the recruitment last year of Ian Rogers from Apple to become LVMH’s first chief digital officer. “Digital is integral to the innovation that is increasingly driving companies around the world.”

He stopped short of saying sales associates would be replaced by robots, something a shareholder suggested during the question-and-answer period.

“I think that would disappoint our clientele. Human contact is absolutely fundamental to explain the quality, creativity and reliability of our products,” he said, characterizing digital technology as a service enhancement. “So the digital development potential for a group like ours is very important — and this without affecting the attractiveness of the product.”"
Vejas Kruszewski: The Youngest Competitor for the LVMH Prize - WWD,"Fri, 15 Apr 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vd3dkLmNvbS9mYXNoaW9uLW5ld3MvZGVzaWduZXItbHV4dXJ5L3ZlamFzLWtydXN6ZXdza2ktbHZtaC1wcml6ZS0xMDQwOTY1Ni_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The notion of “worlds apart” hardly exists in fashion.

Consider Vejas Kruszewski, a 19-year-old upstart eking out a hand-to-mouth existence in Toronto’s garment district one minute; hobnobbing with Karl Lagerfeld at the Paris headquarters of the planet’s biggest luxury group the next.

Naturally, Kruszewski was up to speed on the fact that Lagerfeld had recently visited the Canadian city for a condo lobby project. “He was nice,” the teen demurred, confessing he was most impressed to meet “the people in charge,” including Dior chief executive officer Sidney Toledano and Chloé honcho Geoffroy de la Bourdonnaye.

The aspiring designer will face Chanel’s couturier again in June as a finalist for the 2016 LVMH Prize, which seems to have the desired effect its creator, Delphine Arnault, intended: catapulting all contenders with media exposure and networking opportunities galore.

Before being named one of 23 semifinalists, Kruszewski had four accounts worldwide, one employee he struggled to pay and radio silence from local fashion media.

Flown in by the French group to be judged by its expert panel, who whittled down the field to eight finalists, the young designer also took orders on his fall collection (his third), more than doubling the number of accounts and tripling sales. He noted he’s working from a tiny base, but the boost was enough to encourage him to introduce his first collection — some of which he’ll present to the all-star jury — and to consider a runway show next season in New York or Paris.

The prize, he said, “positions you at another level, which is quite helpful,” lauding the exposure and the “leverage that you get.

“I think we can pretty well — I don’t know if monetize is the right word — let’s say maximize what we can extract from the experience.”

Self-taught, Kruszewski started making clothing in high school, mostly for himself, copying existing garments and experimenting with ways to improve them. An offbeat resource was Japanese magazines for housewives that included detailed clothing diagrams and foldout patterns. YouTube offered handy tutorials on how to attach a waistband or construct a welt pocket.

He had real-life insights, too: One of his summer jobs was at a Montreal factory that made everything from nurses’ uniforms to the collections of local fashion star Marie Saint Pierre.

His experimental streak is plain in his women’s wear — the amorphous shapes, organic textures and snap details lending a quirky allure to bomber jackets, circle skirts and wrap dresses. He also tapped transgender sensation Hari Nef as his look book model. “Taking something familiar and making it alien,” is how he describes his clothes “for a not-too-distant future.”

His fashion heroes are a disparate lot, spanning Nicolas Ghesquière, Helmut Lang, Miguel Adrover and Issey Miyake, the latter for exploring technical innovations that influence the clothes.

But right now his main priority is learning how to “scale sourcing and sampling so we don’t lose money in the process of growing.”

The seven other finalists vying for a cash prize of 300,000 euros, or $341,000, plus a year of coaching are Tuomas Merikoski of Aalto, Glenn Martens of Y/Project, Christelle Kocher of Koché, Hiromichi Ochiai of Facetasm, Matthew Williams of Alyx, Brandon Maxwell and Grace Wales Bonner of Wales Bonner.

Almost 1,000 young designers threw their hats into the ring for a prize that already has helped boost the careers of a string of designers. They include Thomas Tait and Marta Marques and Paulo Almeida, the Portuguese duo behind the Marques’ Almeida label — the first two winners of the grand prize — along with Hood by Air’s Shayne Oliver, Simon Porte Jacquemus, and Nikita and Tina Sutradhar for Miuniku, recipients of special prizes from LVMH, parent of fashion houses including Fendi, Givenchy, Berluti, Loro Piana and Kenzo.

Finalists are to gather June 16 at the Fondation Louis Vuitton in Paris to face a jury stacked with LVMH fashion stars including Givenchy’s couturier Riccardo Tisci; Louis Vuitton’s Ghesquière; Céline’s Phoebe Philo; Marc Jacobs; Loewe artistic director Jonathan Anderson; Kenzo designers Humberto Leon and Carol Lim; along with Arnault, second-in-command at Vuitton, and other LVMH executives.

Unique in its online-only application process, the LVMH Prize is open to anyone under age 40 who has produced and sold at least two women’s or men’s ready-to-wear collections.

To date, LVMH has hosted 55 young designers in Paris and handed out five awards."

Corporations are racing to comply with a law requiring 40 percent of women on French boards by next year.

Kering announced last week it would propose the nomination of three women to its board at its next annual general meeting on April 29, which would bring the proportion of women on its board to 64 percent.

L’Oréal is expected to reach 46 percent after its general meeting on April 20, up from 38 percent. Hermès International counts 40 percent and Prada stands at 25 percent, according to Ethics & Boards, an observatory of governance of listed companies developed by Paris-based consulting and executive search specialist Floriane de Saint Pierre.

“Overall, French fashion companies are in good shape to meet the quota,” said Juliette Li, a governance consultant for Ethics & Boards.

“Although there’s no mandatory requirement in the U.S., women at Michael Kors, Kate Spade and Estée Lauder account for over 40 percent of their board members,” said Li, who, however, noted discrepancies in fashion companies. “They are 20 percent at PVH; 18 at Ralph Lauren and 12 at Tommy Inc.”

If a company fails to comply with the French law in 2017, the nominations at its general meeting next year will be considered null and there will be no directors’ fees. In 2014, the average directors’ fee in European luxury and fashion firms was $63,700 annually.

Gaymard was chief executive officer of General Electric’s French arm until earlier this year. The wife of Hervé Gaymard, a former minister of finance, was also proposed by Danone and Bouygues, two other companies of the CAC 40, to be put on vote at their next AGM.

Valla, an economist, is currently deputy director of CEPII, a French economic think tank, leading its macroeconomic and international finance program. Other women at LVMH’s board include Delphine Arnault, the daughter of luxury titan Bernard Arnault and executive vice president of Louis Vuitton; Bernadette Chirac, former first lady of France, and Marie-Laure Sauty de Chalon, ceo of the Aufeminin.com group.

A female executive recently lamented that she was constantly chased by headhunters to be recruited to a flurry of boards, as companies get closer to the deadline. “There are few female executives in France. But there’s not just enough time [to sit on many companies’ boards],” she said."

These upgrades couldn't come fast enough: Kruszewski decided to show fall 2016 in Paris last month, and the buzzy young label almost tripled accounts with its Hari Nef-fronted collection of sculptural separates and minimalist accessories. Inspired by Noguchi lighting, Brâncuși heads, and objects by New Zealand artist Joe Sheehan, the new season’s highlights include the shaved goat fur jacket, a perfectly oversized tote, and sculptural knits aplenty. If Vejas wins the coveted LVMH award (a winner will be announced in Paris on June 16), the duo is eager to expand into new product categories, invest in better salaries, and improve infrastructure for the company with the 300,000 euro prize money. But even if it doesn’t, they have big plans for the coming months: “We have to present something new to the judges at the finals, and we’re getting our flights paid for again, so I’m going to do a resort collection,” Kruszewski reveals. “And afterwards, we’re going to do a sourcing trip to Italy and the North of France.” Circular knits (which are knitted in one piece and have no side seams) and footwear designs are also in the works, with aims to be introduced in June. Launching new product categories and embracing pre-collections are ambitious plans for any self-funded, emerging label, but if Vejas’ track record is any indication, we bet they'll find a way to make it happen — with or without LVMH."
Rihanna Signs A Deal With LVMH To Create Makeup Line - Refinery29,"Thu, 14 Apr 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJlZmluZXJ5MjkuY29tL2VuLWdiLzIwMTYvMDQvMTA4MzU4L3JpaGFubmEtbWFrZXVwLWJyYW5kLWx2bWjSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Rihanna never looks anything less than 100%. Not only does she exude effortless cool with her daily experimental ensembles (whether it's a Vetements hoodie or high octane glam), her hair is always flawless and her makeup, picture perfect. No amount of careful highlighter application and feline flicks can give us that face. Well, until now. It has just been announced that Rihanna has been signed up by the Kendo division of fashion and beauty conglomerate LVMH to create an entire makeup collection. The deal with the singer may be worth as much as $10 million, a clever move considering the success of the singer's seven fragrances which, reportedly, as a group, make around $75 million in wholesale net shipments. Rihanna sure knows how to make something work work work work work. Kendo will launch Rihanna's makeup collection, named Fenty Beauty by Rihanna, in autumn 2017 but this isn't the singer's first brush with beauty. In 2013, the superstar collaborated with MAC Cosmetics on a four-part, special-edition RiRi Hearts MAC colour cosmetics collection, and in 2104 she was the face of the Viva Glam lipstick, which raised money for AIDS research. While the rest of the details surrounding the exciting launch are few, David Suliteanu, Chief Executive Officer of Kendo revealed today: ""Fenty Beauty by Rihanna is a beauty rocket ship that will appeal to a huge and diverse global audience. We are aiming for the stars."" And if Rihanna's recent Puma collab is anything to go by, this makeup collection will be an instant sellout. Form an orderly queue at the beauty counter ladies."

The opening of the T Galleria in Siem Reap in Cambodia was recognised as the Group’s main highlight of the quarter.

The company also saw strong performance in the US market, with Europe remaining well positioned with the exception of France which has been affected by a fall in tourism. Asian markets are varied, but Japan continues to progress.

Across other areas of the business, its wines & spirits portfolio recorded organic revenue growth of 6% in the first quarter of 2016. Champagne experienced a strong start to the year especially in Europe where growth continued. Hennessy maintained its remarkable performance in the US. In China, the first quarter showed better momentum after the impact of destocking by distributors in 2015. Other spirits, Glenmorangie and Belvedere, continued to grow.

The fashion & leather goods business group was stable. Louis Vuitton maintained its momentum as shown by updates across all areas, notably in leather goods, watches and jewellery with its new Blossom collection. The leather line models achieved good success. Fendi enjoyed an excellent performance, driven by its leather and ready-to-wear lines. Céline and Kenzo experienced good starts to the year. Donna Karan and Marc Jacobs continue to work on the evolution of their product lines.

In perfumes and cosmetics, organic revenue growth was 9% during the period. Christian Dior recorded strong growth with the success of Sauvage and the vitality of its iconic perfumes J’adore and Miss Dior. The launch of the new perfume Poison Girl was also a highlight of the quarter. Building on the success of the perfume, Guerlain expanded La Petite Robe Noire into the world of make-up. Benefit continued its strong innovation in make-up, with Make Up For Ever and Kendo’s brand portfolio also expanding rapidly.

The watches & jewellery business group recorded organic revenue growth of 7% in the first quarter of 2016 outperforming the market. Bvlgari recorded an excellent performance driven by the success of its jewellery collections and innovations. TAG Heuer enjoyed a successful quarter, benefiting from its successful strategy of focussing on its core offering. A number of LVMH watch brand innovations were extremely well received at the recent Basel Watch fair.

LVMH said its main objective is to continue to focus its efforts on developing its brands, maintain a strict control over costs and will target its investments on the quality, the excellence and the innovation of its products and their distribution. The Group will rely on the talent and the motivation of its teams, the diversification of its businesses and the good geographical balance of its revenue to increase, once again in 2016, its global leadership position in luxury goods."

A few months ago, Rihanna cryptically alluded to the possibility of launching her own beauty line, and now WWD reports a plum deal has been reached. To the tune of $10 million, Rihanna is teaming up with luxury conglomerate LVMH to kick-start Fenty Beauty by Rihanna. This won’t mark Rihanna’s first venture into the beauty pond, of course. She previously aligned with M.A.C to produce three special-edition makeup collections and has more than half a dozen fragrances under her belt.

“Fenty Beauty by Rihanna is a beauty rocket ship that will appeal to a huge and diverse global audience,” David Suliteanu, chief executive officer of the LVMH division Kendo, said when reflecting on the deal. But Suliteanu and Rihanna Navy members will need to wait over a year to see the makeup line in action. Fenty Beauty by Rihanna won’t mark its store debut until fall 2017."

Rihanna recently signed a $10 million deal with LVMH to create her own beauty line. The line will be called Fenty Beauty by Rihanna and is due in late 2017. This will be the music mogul’s first beauty line. Rihanna already has multiple clothing lines and fragrances under her belt.

The line will be produced by Kendo Brands, a subsidiary of LVMH. According to Kendo Brands’s CEO David Suliteanu, “Fenty Beauty by Rihanna is a beauty rocket ship that will appeal to a huge and diverse global audience. We’re aiming for the stars.”

Rihanna is no stranger to running a successful business. In 2011 the “Work” singer released a fashion line in collaboration with Armani. In 2014 Rihanna was announced as the new face of Balmain. In the same year, Rihanna was named the creative director of Puma and has since partnered with the brand in a number of collaborations. The singer has also worked with brands such as Stance, Manolo Blahnik, and Dior. Her line is due in stores by fall 2017."
Cha Ling by LVMH Review - Luxurylaunches,"Mon, 18 Apr 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vbHV4dXJ5bGF1bmNoZXMuY29tL3Jldmlldy9jaGEtbGluZy1ob25nLWtvbmctcmV2aWV3LnBocNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"

I came across a rather interesting skin care line this week. Cha Ling, a skin care brand that specializes in products made from pure pu-er tea from the forests of Yunnan in southern China. And suprisingly enough it is developed by none other than the French luxury conglomerate, LVMH.





I checked out this Sino-French eco brand’s newly opened store in the Harbour City Mall (retail mecca of luxury brands in Hong Kong) and experienced their private spa treatment in a single treatment zone located in Viva section of Harbour City.

I walked into the restrained and delicately designed showroom of Cha Ling. I immediately felt strong authentic Chinese tea vibes and for a moment felt as if I have walked into a premium tea retailer. There is also some beautiful ceramic for tea ceremony at display for sale, placed along side the skincare line.



I was served a small cup of perfectly made Pu-er tea as I checked out the range. The current range comprises 40 skin, body, and face care items infused with top-grade pu-er tea grown in the forests of Xishuangbanna in Yunnan.

The highlight of the store design is a moving projection of Yunnan rain forests. I found the use of modern projection technology to showcase the heritage of Yunnan tea forests to be an interesting parallel to Cha Ling’s own identity.



After exploring the range, I took the elevator for the Vita section of the mall to proceed for the Cha Ling facial. I was pleasantly surprised to discover the Vita wing in Harbour city mall. Spread across multiple floors, the section is entirely devoted to spas and well being section of the luxury skincare brands.

As I walked in the Cha Ling spa, I got a peaceful and relaxed vibe. It was easy to forget that I was in a mall in the bustling city of Hong Kong. The prosaic and basic sensibility of the spa urged me to slow down, leave all the to-do lists behind and surrender to the authentic pu-er tea pampering experience.



My therapist, Joel tucked me in the massage bed and started the facial with gentle yet firm movements, what almost felt like Tai Chi for the face. Her each massage stroke aimed to balance the energies and penetrate the anti- oxidant agents of Pu-er tea deeper into the skin layers.

After the cleansing and scrubbing ritual, I was made to inhale the ‘steam tablet’ which helps in purifying pores. I moved back to the massage bed after the inhalation. A nourishing and relaxing massage and the Pu-er tea face mask followed. I was smelling and feeling great at the end of it. Before getting out of the bed, I was given another cup of Pu-er tea to drink.



The facial was one of the most soothing and nurturing experiences ever. It was impossible after this hypnotically mind calming experience to think of going to work (which was my original plan). Instead, I found myself making straight to the cab line for my way home. I wanted to stay in this beautiful stuporous for a little while more.



Cha Ling made a world wide launch with a pop-up store in Paris in January of this year, followed by the first flagship store in Hong Kong, Harbor City Mall. If authentic and eco-conscious luxury skin care is your thing, Cha Ling is the brand that you need to explore.

Why Fashion Brands Are Falling All Over Themselves to Work With Rihanna - Complex,"Tue, 26 Apr 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNvbXBsZXguY29tL3N0eWxlL2EvY2FtZXJvbi13b2xmL3JpaGFubmEtYnJhbmQtYW1iYXNzYWRvci1kaW9yLXB1bWEtc3RhbmNlLWx2bWjSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"If Rihanna’s career as a pop star ever goes south, she could go on to have an extremely lucrative life as a saleswoman for fashion brands. The singer and designer can set the Internet on fire by simply dropping a pair of slides with fur on them. Even with a price tag nearing $100, the singer’s Puma slides sold out almost immediately when they were released on Friday.

Rihanna has been a huge boon for Puma’s sales. She got a $10 million contract from LVMH to go into business on a makeup line together. She recently released a collection with Stance socks and was the first black woman to be the face of Dior. A 2015 study found that Rihanna is the most marketable celebrity in the world. Simply put, the BadGal is good at this.

But Rihanna doesn’t fit our cookie-cutter image of what a brand ambassador should look like. She is aggressively open about her weed use, routinely murders dudes in her video, and treats clothing like an annoying and unnecessary part of life—much to the delight of the Complex social staff. We can’t imagine her behavior sits well with America’s more conservative factions. However, Shanu Walpita, WGSN’s Youth Editor, argues that’s part of Rihanna’s power.

“There’s a level of controversy to her and to some people that’s scary, but to others it’s really appealing,” Walpita says. “The brands that are turning her down are probably brands that don’t really work with her image anyway. It makes sense that there are only certain brands that want to work with her and vice versa. So it only strengthens her branding.”

Walpita gets at the idea that if Rihanna is working with a brand, then she believes in that brand and its ideals. The singer’s status as a CFDA-certified fashion icon only amplifies her strength as a spokeswoman. “She’s so part of the fashion scene,” Walpita says. ""She’s always at fashion shows, at fashion weeks, she collaborated with different designers, she’s been the muse [to] different designers.""

Because Rihanna garnered this cred as a fashionable person, it helps consumers trust that she knows what's stylish and what's not. “If she says, 'This shoe is cool,' it’s going to sell out,” Walpita explains.

However, this whole thing falls apart without Rihanna’s secret weapon: her authenticity. Even if she’s in designer clothing, if she’s not authentic, consumers may not trust that she actually believes in what she’s wearing. “She’s stylish and that’s awesome,” Walpita says. “But I do think the strength of pop stars is that individuality… She’s not a malleable pop star who will just be dressed and told to wear certain things. That’s probably why she’s so popular in fashion—she really stands for something.”

It goes back to the idea that Rihanna's status as a controversial figure is actually a good thing. ""She’s very much, 'I am who I am,'"" Walpita says. ""And that’s what’s appealing about her and really reinforces that element of authenticity as a performer, but also as an individual."" Rihanna is strengthening her brand when she messages with a fan struggling to come out. Or when she takes a picture with someone dressed as a Rihanna-inspired meme. These instances make Rihanna a relatable human being. We trust her when she tells us to check something out in the same way we would trust a friend.

What makes Rihanna so powerful is that if she’s wearing something, she’s doing it because she thinks it’s cool, and that makes it cool in return. It’s why a massive range of companies, from multi-million dollar corporations like LVMH to smaller brands such as Stance Socks, all want a piece of Rihanna right now and for the foreseeable future. For Rihanna, being herself has turned out to be the best business move she could make."

Women's Wear Daily reports that RiRi has signed a deal with the Kendo division of LVMH Moët Hennesy Louis Vuitton to create her own makeup brand called Fenty Beauty by Rihanna. The 28-year-old singer is no doubt flawless so it only makes sense that she craft her own products.

Rihanna reportedly secured $10 million in the beauty deal. It's a safe bet though -- she has successfully launched several collaborations in the fashion industry within the past year. Among her partnerships include Parlux Ltd for a Rihanna-backed perfume and FENTY fashion line, as well as a shoe deal with heels king Manolo Blahnik.
