Everything We Know About Rihanna's Luxury Fashion Brand for LVMH - W Magazine,"Tue, 26 Feb 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndtYWdhemluZS5jb20vc3RvcnkvcmloYW5uYS1sdXh1cnktZmFzaGlvbi1icmFuZC1sdm1oLXByb2plY3QtbG91ZC1mcmFuY2XSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"With her many fashion collaborations, Rihanna has gone from a fashion muse to an actual designer—and a gifted one at that. That design savvy is one of the reasons LVMH is partnering with her on her first full-fledged luxury fashion brand, which was first the subject of speculation back in January. Now Rihanna’s LVMH luxury brand is official, and with that come the first details about it. One of the most interesting we’ve learned is that Rihanna has invested much of her own money into the venture and will be a 49.99 percent shareholder via her company Denim UK Holdings, as Business of Fashion reports.

According to financial filings obtained by the accounting firm Ledouble, Rihanna has invested 29,988,000 euros into her upcoming brand, while LVMH has injected 30 million euros into it. These investments are massive votes of confidence in the line, from both Rihanna and LVMH, which has not launched a new brand since it did so with Christian Lacroix in 1987. LVMH has worked with Rihanna before, as their beauty incubator program, Kendo, backed the wildly successful Fenty Beauty, which is estimated to hit the billion-dollar mark before the competing celebrity beauty line Kylie Cosmetics. (It made 500 million euros in 2018 alone, per BoF.)

With her first luxury fashion line, Rihanna is poised to shatter all kinds of new records. As much as her name alone can carry it, she’s also working with top talent to ensure its success. That includes hiring directly from Louis Vuitton and Celine, as WWD recently noted, and picking Jean-Baptiste Voisin, LVMH’s chief strategy officer, as her brand’s president.

As for the scope of Rihanna’s line, which has the working title Project Loud France—a nod to her 2010 album Loud—it will potentially include everything from women’s wear and men’s wear to clothing for kids, footwear, leather goods, athleisure, and eyewear, which she may have already offered a sneak peek of while out and about in New York City. Rihanna’s line will also reportedly include “goods linked to lifestyle,” high-tech products, office supplies, home decor, and garden products, so you can live a RiRi-approved life, from weed whacking to lounging in your living room. The only downside? There’s no release date yet.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9998399019241333}",neutral,0.9998399019241333,0
5 Simple Reasons I Bought LVMH Stock - The Motley Fool,"Fri, 08 Feb 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDE5LzAyLzA4LzUtc2ltcGxlLXJlYXNvbnMtaS1ib3VnaHQtbHZtaC1zdG9jay5hc3B40gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The luxury goods leader offers balanced growth without the trade war drama.

LVMH (LVMUY -1.91%) is the world's largest luxury company. Its sprawling portfolio of 70 brands includes fashion houses Louis Vuitton, Fendi, Christian Dior, Loewe, and Marc Jacobs; jewelry and watch brands like Bvlgari and Tag Heuer; retailers like Sephora and Le Bon Marche; and wine and spirit brands like Hennessy, Dom Perignon, and Moet & Chandon. It sells its products at 4,590 stores across 70 countries.

LVMH's stock nearly doubled over the past three years as demand for its luxury products rose in both developed and emerging markets. I think LVMH still has room to run after that multiyear rally, so I recently started a position in the stock. Here are my top five reasons for doing so.

1. Stable revenue growth across multiple markets

LVMH's revenue rose 10% to 46.8 billion euros ($53.1 billion) in 2018. On an organic basis, which excludes acquisitions and divestments, its revenue rose 11%. Here's how its core businesses fared.

Core Business Percentage of Revenue (2018) Growth* (YOY) Fashion & Leather 39% 15% Selective Retailing & Other 28% 6% Perfumes & Cosmetics 13% 14% Wines & Spirits 11% 5% Watches & Jewelry 9% 12%

2. Global growth without the trade war

Its growth was also well-balanced across all four of its main regions. LVMH noted that its sales in China, which are included in its Rest of Asia region, ""accelerated"" in the fourth quarter of the year.

Region Percentage of Revenue (2018) Growth* (YOY) Europe 29% 7% United States** 24% 8% Japan 7% 15% Rest of Asia 29% 15%

LVMH's growth in China defies the notion that its economic slowdown is impacting the consumption of luxury goods. Tiffany & Co. (TIF) also recently reported ""double-digit"" sales growth in China during the holidays.

LVMH, which is based in Paris, isn't exposed to the ongoing trade war between the US and China. This insulates it from tariffs and retaliatory boycotts of American products.

3. Expanding margins and rising earnings

LVMH's gross margin rose 200 basis points to 67% in 2018 as its operating profit (from recurring operations) expanded 190 basis points to 21.4%. Those figures are significantly higher than Tiffany's gross margin of 63.1% and operating margin of 16.7% in the first nine months of 2018.

LVMH keeps expanding its margins for two reasons: It never marks down its items, and its core brands only face a handful of meaningful competitors in the high-end market. LVMH's year-over-year operating margin expansion was also well-balanced across its five core businesses:

Operating Margin 2017 2018 Fashion & Leather 31.7% 32.2% Selective Retailing & Other 8.1% 10.1% Perfumes & Cosmetics 10.8% 11.1% Wines & Spirits 30.6% 31.7% Watches & Jewelry 13.5% 17.1%

LVMH's profit from recurring operations rose 21% to €10 billion ($11.3 billion) as its net profit climbed 20% to €7 billion ($7.9 billion). Those are solid growth rates for a stock that trades at about 23 times trailing earnings. LVMH's stock isn't cheap, but its steady sales growth and expanding margins justify that slight premium.

4. Free cash flow growth and shareholder-friendly moves

LVMH's free cash flow (FCF) rose 16% to €5.5 billion ($6.2 billion) in 2018. It spent about €3 billion on dividends and €800 million on buybacks and other operations during the year. It also reduced its net debt by 23% to €5.5 billion.

LVMH also raised its annual dividend 20% to €6 ($6.80) per share for 2018, which gives it a yield of 2.1%. It has hiked that dividend annually at an average rate of 14% over the past five years.

5. A recession-resistant stock

It might seem risky to invest in a luxury goods maker when the bears expect a recession within the next two years. However, the highest-end brands are generally more resistant to economic downturns than mid-range ""affordable luxury"" brands like Tapestry's (TPR -2.93%) Coach and Kate Spade. That's why we recently saw Tapestry's stock plunge after it reported less than 1% sales growth last quarter.

LVMH's stock will certainly drop during a marketwide downturn. However, it could also recover much faster than other stocks, as it did after the Great Recession.

A ""good start"" to 2019

LVMH declared that it got off to a ""good start"" in 2019, and remained ""cautiously confident"" about the rest of the year. Therefore I think it's a good idea to start a small position in this stock, then accumulate some more if a market downturn cuts its valuation to even cheaper levels.

Rihanna and LVMH Are Launching a Luxury Fashion House - Papermag,"Tue, 26 Feb 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiNGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBhcGVybWFnLmNvbS9yaWhhbm5hLWx2bWgtbHV4dXJ5LWZhc2hpb27SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Calling Rihanna's ventures into the worlds of beauty and lingerie 'successful' would be a vast understatement. The queen herself has proved that her creativity can not be bound to one medium or another, which makes her upcoming fashion partnership with LVMH that much more exciting. According to Business of Fashion, Rihanna's rumored deal with the luxury fashion conglomerate has finally taken flight, and insiders are referring to it as 'Project Loud France' — a title referencing her fifth studio album Loud.

The French accounting firm Ledouble obtained filings that illustrate the financial partnership between the singer and the fashion group. Rihanna has reportedly contributed €29,988,000 to the project, with Project Loud France, controlled by LVMH, securing majority shareholder status with a €30 million investment. According to documents secured by BoF, Antoine Arnault, one of two heirs presumptive to the LVMH empire, signed the deposit on behalf of LV Group. The cash flow indicates that Rihanna is a 49.9% shareholder via her company Denim UK Holdings.

LVMH has not debuted a brand from inception since launching Christian Lacroix in 1987. This new foray into ground-up partnerships will be quite expansive, given the scope of Project Loud is the ""conception, fabrication, distribution, commerce, importation and exportation"" of an ambitious array of products. The upcoming line will reportedly include womenswear, menswear, children's clothing, accessories, footwear, eyewear, tech products, office supplies (?) and more.

WWD reported in January that Louis Vuitton and Celine employees have already been appointed to work alongside the singer and entrepreneur. In addition, Jean-Baptiste Voisin, chief strategy officer at LVMH has been named the company's president.

Like any of Rihanna's projects, Project Loud France is likely to be a major success — bolstered by the singer's celebrity status and LVMH's signature expertise. According to luxury analyst Mario Ortelli, the venture's success will largely depend on execution. ""They have one of the best platforms in the world in terms of design, marketing, distribution, supply chain,"" he told Business of Fashion. ""That's why they'll make the bet. But whether it succeeds will depend on execution.""","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.5953876972198486}",neutral,0.5953876972198486,0

Luxury goods conglomerate LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton is introducing new requirements for its crocodilian leather sourcing, as the group continues its quest to be more transparent about animal welfare and other sustainability issues.

LVMH plans to have all the farms supplying its exotic leather tannery certified by its new standards by 2020. Affluents are expecting more transparency and public initiatives from luxury brands as they grow more aware of environmental issues.

""Affluent consumers increasingly care about sustainability and animal welfare,"" said Chris Ramey, president of Affluent Insights, Miami. ""Luxury brands lead by setting higher standards.""

Mr. Ramey is not affiliated with LVMH, but agreed to comment as an industry expert. LVMH was reached for comment.

Leather sourcing

In 2011, LVMH took its first steps to managing its full supply chain of crocodilian leather by acquiring a Singaporean exotic leather tannery, Heng Long.

In addition to supplying LVMH brands, Heng Long also works with other companies in the luxury business. The tannery was certified by the Leather Working Group in 2017 because of its high-quality working conditions and environmental practices.

Heng Long has also been working with scientists, veterinarians and partner farms to improve the conditions for breeding crocodiles. These years of research are the basis for LVMH’s new standards for livestock production.

The new guidelines also reflect input from the International Union for Conservation of Nature’s Crocodile Specialist Group and NSF International.

Although tannery traceability requirements were already in place, LVMH’s new standard has four primary tenets. These include environment protections, safe working conditions on farms, animal welfare across all life stages, species preservation and respect for local communities.

Animal welfare encompasses the handling, veterinary intervention on site, quality of living space and feeding of the crocodiles.

Three of Heng Long’s 20 farm suppliers have already been certified by NSF International as meeting these requirements. Farms in Australia, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Kenya, the Philippines and the United States currently supply the tannery.

Later this year, LVMH plans to share an updated global strategy for the total animal sourcing as part of its LVMH Initiatives For the Environment program.

In 2017, the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals purchased stock in LVMH to highlight its opposition to the conglomerate's use of exotic leathers.

PETA’s decision to buy stock in LVMH comes after the animal rights organization released a film exposé on the cruelty inflicted on crocodiles to harvest their skins for leather goods such as handbags and footwear. Through its stake holding, PETA hopes that it can push LVMH to end exotic-skin sales from within the corporation (see story).

As of now, LVMH is pushing a more conscientious strategy for its crocodilian leather sourcing without eliminating its production entirely. Other luxury labels, however, are moving towards a future without exotic leathers.

In late 2018, French fashion label Chanel publicly announced that it would discontinue use of exotic skins, as well as furs, and shift resources towards the development of alternative materials.

Sustainability is so profoundly consequential in luxury manufacturing today that the CEO of Kering's Bottega Veneta believes leather in the future will likely be completely synthesized. During the Condé Nast International Luxury Conference, Claus-Dietrich Lahrs stated that he believed in the far future, leather will no longer come from actual animals, in a more humane form of fashion (see story).

""It’s a sensitive issue as Chanel and other luxury brands are moving away from exotic animal pelts,"" Mr. Ramey said.

Sustainability push?

Luxury companies including LVMH must continue to address environmental challenges as climate change impacts the industry.

According to a report by the Business for Social Responsibility (BSR) and members of its Responsible Luxury Initiative, companies should protect resources by using less and recycling more, using business strategies and philanthropic efforts to positively benefit society and being transparent about their progress to engage more investors and consumers.

Luxury brands, particularly in fashion, are encouraged to invest in the protection and restoration of crucial ecosystems. This will help keep raw materials, such as leather, available for those same luxury retailers (see story).

The fashion and leather goods sector continues to be LVMH's biggest driver, with the category seeing a 20 percent increase in revenue for the third quarter of 2018.

LVMH's fashion and leather goods revenues totaled 13 billion euros, or $15 billion at current exchange, in the first nine months of 2018, compared to 10.8 billion euros, or $12.4 billion in 2017 (see story).

""Luxury brands win thoughtful affluent customers only if they demonstrate the highest level of responsibility to working conditions and animal welfare,"" Mr. Ramey said. ""A luxury brand’s benevolence has to be more compelling than detractors who believe meat shouldn’t be eaten, leather shouldn’t be worn and animals shouldn’t entertain.""","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.995306670665741}",neutral,0.995306670665741,0

LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton S.E.’s (EPA:MC) most recent earnings announcement in December 2018 confirmed that the company gained from a robust tailwind, eventuating to a double-digit earnings growth of 24%. Today I want to provide a brief commentary on how market analysts view LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton’s earnings growth trajectory over the next couple of years and whether the future looks even brighter than the past. I will be using net income excluding extraordinary items in order to exclude one-off volatility which I am not interested in.

View our latest analysis for LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton

Market analysts’ prospects for the upcoming year seems optimistic, with earnings expanding by a robust 12%. This growth seems to continue into the following year with rates reaching double digit 21% compared to today’s earnings, and finally hitting €8.2b by 2022.

Even though it is informative knowing the growth each year relative to today’s value, it may be more beneficial to evaluate the rate at which the earnings are rising or falling every year, on average. The pro of this method is that it ignores near term flucuations and accounts for the overarching direction of LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton’s earnings trajectory over time, which may be more relevant for long term investors. To calculate this rate, I’ve inserted a line of best fit through analyst consensus of forecasted earnings. The slope of this line is the rate of earnings growth, which in this case is 8.6%. This means that, we can expect LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton will grow its earnings by 8.6% every year for the next couple of years.

Moët Hennessy Is Planting Roots in China With Ao Yun Wines - Fortune,"Tue, 05 Feb 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vZm9ydHVuZS5jb20vMjAxOS8wMi8wNS9tb2V0LWhlbm5lc3N5LWFvLXl1bi1jaGluYS13aW5lL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Maxence Dulou—a native of Bordeaux who has worked at vineyards in Chile, South Africa, and France’s Burgundy region—wanted to take part in the creation of a new wine. In 2012, he found himself doing so—in China.

But while China is projected to soon become the world’s second largest market for wine, behind the United States, it is not known for being a major wine producer.

So why start a brand new winemaking operation—not just one producing mass market bottles, but wines priced at $300 a pop—in an untested region for wine production? “No one did it before,” Dulou replies simply. “It’s a country that is very interesting. No company was trying to make a luxury product there, in particular, a luxury wine.”

It became a complicated journey, both financially and geographically, as Dulou described it recently during a sit-down interview at Manhattan’s NeueHouse, a private work collaboration space for creative professionals, artists, and entrepreneurs.

Ao Yun

Enter Moët Hennessy, the wine and spirits half of the luxury goods conglomerate LVMH, headquartered in Paris. The parent company of iconic and even legendary houses such as Dom Pérignon, Ruinart, and Veuve Cliquot (founded in 1668, 1729, and 1772, respectively) had been scouting for a new wine region to pioneer following investments in expanding wine-producing regions from Argentina to Western Australia and New Zealand for the last few decades.

By 2008, China marked the next step in this direction for Moët Hennessy.

“To discover a new terroir, it is a dream for a winemaker,” Dulou says.

Ao Yun, which means “flying above the clouds,” in a nod to its home beneath the sacred Meili mountain, operates like a startup within Moët Hennessy, according to Olivier Gailly, brand manager for the prestige collection of estates and wines at Moët Hennessy.

“We’re building for the long term—for the ability to pass on that knowledge of winemaking and market perspective to the next generation,” Gailly says. “It’s tiny within the LVMH world, but it’s exciting and new.”

Getting into the wine business is a huge investment, and it takes a long time to get your money back—and the cost to make the wine is incredibly high, Dulou says. When you’re starting from actual scratch, the costs are exponentially greater. In the case of Ao Yun, Dulou estimates they’re investing at a rate of three times the cost of doing a first growth of Bordeaux in the grape’s native region.

Flying Above the Clouds

There are less than a handful of significant wine regions in China. Eventually, the winemaker found an area—a microterroir, if you will—which was not too big, not too small, with a climate just right in the Yunnan Province in southern China, not far from the Tibetan border.

Ao Yun’s vineyards span across nearly 500 acres. The area is surrounded by three large rivers, separated by mountain ranges climbing 22,000 feet. The vineyards are spread across four villages—Adong, Xidang, Sinong, and Shuori—and soils tended to and managed by more than 120 Tibetan farmers with the objective of producing a more complex wine.

Dulou stresses the key role that the Tibetan farmers play in the winemaking process and contributing to the terroir profile.

“Some [winemakers] just focus on the climate and soil,” Dulou explains. “But we like to add the people in. You can have the best climate and the best soil, but not make a good grape if you don’t have the right people taking care of it.”

Ao Yun/Moet Hennessy

And with the closest river at 4,000 feet and the villages between 6,000 and 8,000 feet in elevation, there’s also no machinery available at Ao Yun winery. There is simply no access available for it. The nearest airport is four hours away in Shangri-La City.

So this permits the winery to have soil that is less compact with roots that can go deeper. It also means there is no use of pesticides.

“We work four times harder because we do everything by hand,” Dulou says. “You mustn’t want to make money to come here. Passionate people with a lot of time can make money. But if you aim to make money, there are other ways to do it. You start from zero, and it takes time to build a brand.”

Suffice to say, the high-altitude also contributes to a unique, strong profile—but it also comes with its own challenges.

“If you don’t have sunscreen, you’ll burn quickly,” Dulou says with a laugh. On a more serious note, that also means more color in the wine, which makes the wine softer. “You feel the tannins of the wine. This is very specific to this altitude because the mountain is very steep.”

Ao Yun commenced on its first vintage in 2013. That bottle launched in 2017, followed by the 2014 vintage in 2018. The 2015 vintage is coming to white tablecloth restaurants, luxury hotels, and high-end wine shops in 2019.

Beyond Borders

Selling directly to the likes of Michelin-starred restaurants is key to Moët Hennessy’s strategy for not only promoting Ao Yun as a luxury winemaker but educating the wine community about the emergence of the Chinese province as a world-class producer.

“We don’t want to make a wine only for China. We’re thinking long-term. It would be simple, short-term, to only sell in China,” Dulou says, noting that only 20% of the company’s production is sold in China. The rest is distributed worldwide. Nevertheless, he acknowledges that Chinese demand will help Ao Yun to build its brand in the future.

Gregoire Machavoine

When asked where he might look for the next untapped terroir, Dulou kept his cards close, but he did hint at a few spots, naming nearby Nepal and India as potential regions ripe for deeper investment in winemaking.

Gailly says that the story of Ao Yun is already “extraordinary,” but he suggests that, regardless of the unique terroir and winemaking process at Ao Yun, there are some universal truths to wine appreciated worldwide that are the true tests of success: “At the end of the day, people want a great experience in the glass with good food and good company.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999914169311523}",neutral,0.9999914169311523,0

We now know the value of the Fenty Effect: 500 million euros.

That figure represents the sales generated by Rihanna's Fenty Beauty range in its first full year in business, LVMH reported last week. The brand, created in partnership with the French luxury conglomerate's Kendo Beauty division, launched in September 2017, and the ""Fenty Effect"" was born. Fenty Beauty's 40 shades of foundation (since expanded to 50) now act as a litmus test for the beauty industry; Morphe's foundation (60 shades) was celebrated on its launch last month, while debuts from Tarte and It Cosmetics last year featuring more limited ranges for women of colour were subject to online pile-ons.

The cultural impact has been well documented. Let’s take a closer look at what Fenty Beauty means for LVMH, and its globe-spanning beauty retail giant, Sephora. Rihanna’s cosmetics launched exclusively at Sephora and did a reported $100 million in sales in its first 40 days (by comparison, white-hot brands not fronted by an international pop star, like Huda Beauty and Anastasia Beverly Hills, needed years to hit that milestone).

Sephora needs a cash cow like Fenty Beauty more than ever. LVMH acknowledged that the chain’s growth slowed in the latter months of 2018 following a “tremendous” first half. Competition from rival Ulta Beauty and direct-to-consumer brands is heating up.

Speaking of competition, LVMH lifting the curtain a bit on Fenty Beauty’s financials will help distance the brand from its biggest rival, Kylie Cosmetics.

Kylie Jenner launched her beauty line a couple of years before Rihanna, in 2015, and as of November a selection of her lip products entered all of Ulta's approximately 1,200 locations, where it plays a similar role in driving both sales and buzz. Tara Simon, senior vice president of merchandising at Ulta Beauty, told BoF that the retailer expects to up Kylie Cosmetics' presence online and in-store with a broader selection this year.

By the numbers, Rihanna is a step ahead: its 2018 sales alone surpass the $420 million Kylie Cosmetics generated in its first 18 months, originally reported in a WWD article I wrote in August 2017, though Jenner’s sales figures predate her partnership with Ulta.

Rihanna is benefitting from what one venture capitalist described to me as “arbitrage 101” for LVMH, which owns both Sephora and the retailer’s best-performing products. Fenty Beauty can take Sephora’s sales data and use it to develop new products, which the beauty retailer can then give prime exposure online and in stores. Jenner, who started out selling her products via her own online store, can only dream of that sort of synergy.

According to the same WWD story, Jenner's biggest sales day to date was Nov. 21, 2016 when her e-commerce site did $18,926,657.29 million in sales. This is evidence that Jenner can equal Rihanna's hype, but perhaps hasn't built as sustainable a business – yet. The former relied on direct sales until entering Ulta, which still only carries an assortment of her product in the lip category, and doesn't have Sephora's global muscle behind her (Ulta has yet to expand beyond the US).

But LVMH’s ownership of Fenty Beauty could also prove to be golden handcuffs for the singer. While Sephora is, well, Sephora, there are limits to how much one can scale while staying exclusive to a single retailer. Another person who works in the financial space said it could become “challenging” if Rihanna ever wants to expand beyond Sephora’s shelves.

And while Rihanna’s sales may be better, Jenner is probably getting richer from her beauty line (even if calling her a billionaire may be a stretch). Jenner owns 100 percent of her brand, having managed to get it off the ground and even lining up a manufacturer, Colourpop parent Seed Beauty, without offering equity. Rihanna’s stake in Fenty Beauty hasn’t been publicly disclosed, but LVMH’s share is sizeable. It raises the question: is it better to own the entirety of a smaller company or a percentage of a larger one?

With Jenner’s wholesale distribution picking up, there could be a Kylie Cosmetics vs. Fenty Beauty style showdown between Sephora and Ulta. We’ll just have to wait and see.

Editor's Note: The previous edition of this newsletter, published 29 January, 2019, misstated that Drunk Elephant’s asking price for a sale is $1 billion. This is incorrect. Industry experts predict the company could sell for that amount; the company itself has not floated this figure with potential buyers.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez brought K-beauty to Congress. The hugely popular Democrat has become the first congressional member to put a cult beauty trend up for discussion by revealing her skincare routine (it's heavily influenced by Korean beauty regimens). K-beauty has been making its way into the American consciousness since about 2015. It involves exotic ingredients such as snail mucus and an emphasis on knowledge of active ingredients. The approach has infiltrated the mass market, giving rise to sheet masks, serums, essences and other skincare products.

Budget cosmetic brands are the next big thing. Thanks to low-price, premium-looking brands such as The Ordinary and Beauty Pie, it's now cool to talk about costs, profit margins and integrity. Transparency about pricing has become a significant factor for savvy consumers who've grown up expecting more for less, and any stigma attached to supermarket and own-label brands is fading. Sainsbury's relaunched its Boutique line last year with 109 products, priced from £2; while Boots has launched label CYO, which features 200 products including eyeshadows starting at £3.50.

Target's accelerator welcomes 10 new beauty startups. As Target continues to brush up on its beauty offerings, adding more lines from emerging startups is one path to drive consistent foot traffic, much as its new private label lines have been. For young brands, the opportunity to work with Target has the potential to get their product in front of thousands of mass merchandise shoppers. Past brands that have made the jump include Girl+Hair and YUNI Beauty. Oars + Alps, a natural skincare product line for men, will make its debut in February.

Beauty brands are serving food. Glossier, Benefit and L'Occitane are the latest brands to grow their audiences with pop-up cafes. For Benefit, it came in the form of a bright pink roller diner in Los Angeles, where items such as its popular brow products, new eyeliner launch and ""BeneBabe"" merch — a line of pink crop tops, tumblers and makeup bags — were sold. Glossier launched a pop-up shop inside San Francisco's Rhea's Cafe, while a L'Occitane cafe opened in Singapore after successful ones in Tokyo and London. It's all part of a wider trend where brands are using offline experiences to engage its existing digital community.

Malaysia's halal beauty market is growing swiftly. With two-thirds of the world's Muslim population in Asia-Pacific, the southeast Asian country wants to be a global halal hub. It's a lucrative business: In 2017, the local halal industry contributed approximately 7.5 percent to Malaysia's GDP. SimplySiti, founded by singer Siti Nurhaliza, offers cosmetic, fragrance and skincare products that are halal-certified. Mainstream firms such as Clara International, Johnson & Johnson, Silky Girl and Wipro Unza have also jumped on the halal bandwagon. Halal cosmetics must be free from alcohol, blood and parts or substances from animals that have not been slaughtered, according to Islamic practices.

The world-famous Irish brewery, Guinness, and Irish whiskey brand, Jameson, may soon be owned by the same company as Diageo participating with Louis Vuitton Moet Hennessy (LVMH) in buying Pernod Ricard. This is “a likely scenario” according to a luxury sector stock analyst, Zuzanna Pusz of Berenberg, the German-based investment bank.

Pernod Ricard, which has driven sales of Jameson to new heights, have been targeted for a hostile takeover by activist investor Elliott Management owned by billionaire Paul Singer.

Rather than allow that, a joint bid by luxury group LVMH and rival distiller Diageo, who own Guinness, is likely.

Singer wants to slash costs and overhaul corporate governance and reap even bigger immediate profits. Pernod Ricard does not want to sell to him.

LVMH CEO Bernard Arnault recently denied reports that LVMH was joining Singer in the hostile bid. ""We have nothing to do with any of that,"" Arnault said at the time.

""No one from our company knows Elliott. We have no contact with them. Secondly, Alexandre Ricard and our family are friends.""

Fears of a monopoly issue if the merger goes ahead may be unfounded Berenberg’s Ms. Pusz said.

""An efficient split of brands between LVMH and Diageo should overcome any regulatory hurdles that such a deal would face.""

PETA calls LVMH Louis Vuitton's crocodile farming policy 'tosh' - Daily Mail,"Tue, 19 Feb 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhaWx5bWFpbC5jby51ay9mZW1haWwvYXJ0aWNsZS02NzIxMjcxL1BFVEEtY2FsbHMtTFZNSC1Mb3Vpcy1WdWl0dG9ucy1jcm9jb2RpbGUtZmFybWluZy1wb2xpY3ktdG9zaC5odG1s0gF4aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZGFpbHltYWlsLmNvLnVrL2ZlbWFpbC9hcnRpY2xlLTY3MjEyNzEvYW1wL1BFVEEtY2FsbHMtTFZNSC1Mb3Vpcy1WdWl0dG9ucy1jcm9jb2RpbGUtZmFybWluZy1wb2xpY3ktdG9zaC5odG1s?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Animal rights group PETA has dismissed plans by fashion giant LVMH to implement new crocodile farming standards as 'tosh'.

The luxury retail group, which is the parent company of Louis Vuitton and sells exotic handbags for up to £31,000, announced this week it had devised a new set of standards for 'responsibly-supplied' crocodile skin and applied them to three farms that supply their leather tanneries.

According to WWD the guidelines, which have been approved by certification company NSF International, will eventually be applied to the 20 farms that supply crocodile leather to the company by 2020.

But PETA said the new policy amounted to 'pretty much nothing' and would continue to cause 'immeasurable suffering' to the animals.

A spokesperson told MailOnline: 'LVMH's assurances of ""responsibly-supplied"" crocodile skin are tosh, given that it will apparently take the company nearly two years to get around to ensuring pretty much nothing.

'Most importantly, the standard won't prevent the worst of the cruel practices: the method of slaughter, which consists of cutting the back of the crocodile's neck and thrusting a metal rod down the live animal's spine, causing unimaginable agony.

'Fashion houses and designers – such as Chanel and, most recently, Victoria Beckham – that have come to the conclusion that there's no way to turn an exotic animal into a fashion accessory without causing immeasurable suffering have dropped exotic skins from their collections, and PETA urges LVMH to do the same.'

LVMH - which stands for LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE - is the parent company of luxury brands including Louis Vuitton, Dior and Fendi.

Handbags made from 'precious' exotic leathers currently appear on Louis Vuitton's website for as much as £31,000.

There are some 20 crocodile farms that supply crocodile leather to Heng Long, LVMH's crocodile tannery, according to WWD.

Jean Baptiste Voisn, strategy director for the luxury conglomerate, said: 'LVMH has decided to set a new frame of reference by launching a new standard for the industry, whose regulations seemed inefficient to us.'

Chanel, Victoria Beckham, Vivienne Westwood and Diane von Furstenberg are among the labels that have banned exotic animal pelts from their collections in recent months amid mounting pressure from consumers and animal rights groups.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999632835388184}",neutral,0.9999632835388184,0
Diageo-LVMH bid tipped to land Pernod Ricard - Irish Independent,"Mon, 18 Feb 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmluZGVwZW5kZW50LmllL2J1c2luZXNzL2lyaXNoL2RpYWdlby1sdm1oLWJpZC10aXBwZWQtdG8tbGFuZC1wZXJub2QtcmljYXJkLzM3ODI3ODgxLmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Pernod Ricard, the French distiller being targeted by activist investor Elliott Management, could fall prey to a joint bid by luxury group LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton and rival distiller Diageo, according to analysts at Berenberg.

A consortium-led acquisition of Pernod by LVMH and Guinness-owner Diageo is ""a likely scenario"", luxury-sector analysts at Berenberg led by Zuzanna Pusz wrote in a report yesterday.

Paris-based LVMH ""could take the lead in a potential bid"", while such a transaction could put an end to a joint venture that LVMH and Diageo have had since 1987, she wrote.

Such a deal could unite irish drinks brands including Guinness and Jameson under a single corporate umbrella, but would face competition hurdles.

Elliott disclosed a stake in Paris-based Pernod Ricard, the world's second-largest distiller, in December.

The activist investor controlled by billionaire Paul Singer wants the company, whose products include Absolut vodka, to slash costs and overhaul corporate governance.

The co-founding Ricard family, which has expanded the business over almost half a century, wants it to stick to a strategy that produces consistent long-term shareholder returns. Elliott's involvement is a ""game changer"" and could potentially remove obstacles to an unsolicited approach, Berenberg said. Investors aren't buying the idea of a potential deal for now. Pernod stock was down 0.5pc at one stage in Paris yesterday, with LVMH shares little changed and Diageo trading 0.6pc lower in London.

Media representatives at LVMH didn't immediately respond to requests for comment. A spokesman for Pernod Ricard referred to comments made last week by CEO Alexandre Ricard, who said the French distiller ""will remain a consolidator"". A spokeswoman for London-based Diageo declined to comment. LVMH CEO Bernard Arnault brushed off speculation in January that he might have had a hand in pushing Elliott on the Pernod Ricard front. ""We have nothing to do with any of that,"" Mr Arnault said at the time. ""No one from our company knows Elliott, the activists, investment fund. We have no contact with them. Secondly, Alexandre Ricard and our family are friends.""

Berenberg estimates that LVMH has close to $40bn in resources for takeovers, so a joint purchase of Pernod would ""make sense"" for the luxury conglomerate, not only financially but also from a regulatory point of view, Ms Pusz said. ""An efficient split of brands between LVMH and Diageo should overcome any regulatory hurdles that such a deal would face"", enabling the owner of the Louis Vuitton brand to increase its presence in the attractive brown-spirits category, she wrote.

AFRICA: Louis Vuitton enforces purchasing criteria for crocodile skins - AFRIK 21,"Mon, 25 Feb 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFmcmlrMjEuYWZyaWNhL2VuL2FmcmljYS1sb3Vpcy12dWl0dG9uLWVuZm9yY2VzLXB1cmNoYXNpbmctY3JpdGVyaWEtZm9yLWNyb2NvZGlsZS1za2lucy_SAWhodHRwczovL3d3dy5hZnJpazIxLmFmcmljYS9lbi9hZnJpY2EtbG91aXMtdnVpdHRvbi1lbmZvcmNlcy1wdXJjaGFzaW5nLWNyaXRlcmlhLWZvci1jcm9jb2RpbGUtc2tpbnMvYW1wLw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"African crocodile farms, particularly those in Zambia, Zimbabwe and Kenya, will need to be more careful about environmental standards. One of their major customers, Louis Vuitton Moet Hennessey (LVMH), the world’s leading luxury goods company, has just tightened its criteria for supplying exotic leather. The conditions, announced by the group on February 20, 2019, specify that it is a matter of ensuring the preservation of the species, respect for local communities, animal welfare, working conditions for men and women on farms and the protection of the environment in general. In addition to this list, 100% of the skins already in place are traceable on farms.

This initiative is part of an initiative by the LVMH group to ensure that there are no networks of poachers and animal torture in its crocodile skin supply chain. This is because, according to PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals), an American animal welfare association, reptiles living on crocodile farms are often confined in tiny pits and sometimes tortured while they are still alive and struggling.

Towards stopping the sale of products made from animal skins?

The decision taken by LVMH is part of a global movement that began with the limitation and exclusion of furs. Under pressure from animal advocates and thanks to the arrival of very high quality synthetic furs, the claws have given up, one after the other, the use of natural fur, which does not represent a large turnover for these luxury brands either. With the exception of Fendi, who resisted, under the impetus of Karl Lagerfeld, who defended the use of the Italian fur and the historical trades of the Italian furrier to the very end. However, the old crocodile died on February 19, 2019, and the story on the move will never stop. Even if, the Chinese market remains a big consumer….

Another matter concerns reptile skins (snakes, crocodiles, lizards, stingrays, etc.), which are used in the manufacture of fashion items, such as bags, shoes and belts. It takes longer for consciences to wake up to save a crocodile than a baby seal and for the luxury industry, bags made of exotic skins are a highly profitable leather goods product that has grown rapidly in recent years, particularly in new emerging markets.

The decision taken on December 4, 2018 by the haute couture house Chanel thus sounds like a thunderclap heralding future upheavals. From May 2019, the brand will eliminate animal furs in its creations… as well as exotic skins. All this, in the name of ethics and the very trendy concept of “responsible fashion”, which has been acclaimed by many film stars, such as Emma Watson and Marion Cotillard.

Chanel’s press release put pressure on the entire luxury industry. It is in this context that it is important to understand LVMH’s announcement to apply responsible criteria to the purchase of reptile skins in the future, which the world leader in luxury does not seem to want to abandon, for the time being. However, a glimmer of hope is permitted, since the LVMH group now includes the PETA association among its shareholders. On January 13, 2017, the American Animal Rights Association purchased shares in Louis LVMH. Objective: to put pressure on the luxury group to stop selling products made from animal skins.
