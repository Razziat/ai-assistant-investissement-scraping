"LVMH Watch Division & TAG Heuer Now Headed By Newcomer, Biver Likely Still Calling Creative Shots - aBlogtoWatch","Fri, 21 Sep 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFibG9ndG93YXRjaC5jb20vbHZtaC13YXRjaC1kaXZpc2lvbi10YWctaGV1ZXItamVhbi1jbGF1ZGUtYml2ZXItc3RlcGhhbmUtYmlhbmNoaS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LVMH, owner of luxury watch brands including Hublot, TAG Heuer, Zenith, and Bulgari, among others, today officially announced what is really big news for the watch industry. Mr. Jean-Claude Biver, who has for the last several years been running TAG Heuer, as well as the overall LVMH Watch Division, will step down from his daily duties at LVMH. The reason for Mr. Biver’s stepping down is related to his health. Jean-Claude Biver has been recovering from a major operation in addition to other health matters which have prevented him from actively running the brands. Jean-Claude Biver is not retiring but rather taking the role of non-executive chairman of the LVMH Watchmaking Division.

LVMH was quick to point out that it (likely referring to LVMH Chairman and CEO Bernard Arnault) and Mr. Biver mutually agreed that he would be stepping down, signaling continued professional cooperation. His role as a non-executive chairman means that Mr. Biver’s advice, decisions, and direction will still be called upon, but he will not have acting duty to execute orders and lead projects. A result likely favorable to both parties.

On everyone’s mind is the question of who will be in charge next. Who will make the creative decisions? Who will stand in Mr. Biver’s legendary shoes? Replacing Jean-Claude Biver is Mr. Stéphane Bianchi (53 years old) who has just recently joined LVMH after a number of years in mainstream fashion and women’s cosmetics at Yves Rocher. Mr. Bianchi does not appear to have any watch industry experience. His primary expertise appears to be in consulting and management.

Stéphane Bianchi will not merely take over the CEO position at TAG Heuer, but will entirely take over Mr. Biver’s role as CEO of the LVMH Watchmaking Division. That means he will be responsible for overall group direction, spending, strategy, and creative decisions. It also means that the CEOs of both Hublot and Zenith will continue to report to him just as they did to Mr. Biver until recently.

LVMH included the news that group Chairman & CEO Bernard Arnault’s son Frederic Arnault has been given a promotion at TAG Heuer. Only 23 years old, until recently Frederic has been working as the Head of connected technologies at TAG Heuer. Frederic Arnault has now been appointed as the overall Strategy & Digital Director of TAG Heuer. No further information on planned direction or timelines in regard to the Watch Division were communicated by LVMH.

aBlogtoWatch Analysis Of Mr. Biver’s New Role & The Qualifications of Stéphane Bianchi For TAG Heuer Watches

For a lot of people in the watch industry, today is bitter news as it quite possibly marks the end of the professional career of one of the most innovative and decisive watch industry managers of our modern times. The LVMH announcement included mentioning Jean-Claude Biver’s over 40-year “career” in watchmaking. Adding such a statement likely signals a strong sentiment from Jean-Claude that he will not likely be returning to daily duty in the future. That does not, however, mean that Jean-Claude Biver is done. In fact, far from it.

My opinion is that LVMH is far too reliant on Jean-Claude Biver to let him retire this easily. At 69 years old, Jean-Claude Biver could reasonably retire now but reports having too much fun to do so. With that said, his health status might dictate his actions more than his spirit. With that said, Jean-Claude Biver’s position as a non-executive Chairman means that LVMH will be tapping him for knowledge and decisions on a very regular basis.

“Non-executive Chairman” is certainly a position of lower authority, but it is for the best interest of both the group and Mr. Biver. During his long post-surgery recovery process, Mr. Biver has clearly not been able to offer the type of in-person attention TAG Heuer or any of the other brands need. That a manager should step in to make sure these companies are actually being run is logical and important for LVMH to do. Jean-Claude Biver and Bernard Arnault are known for their friendly relations and no doubt discussed various options before coming to this conclusion. My takeaway is that Jean-Claude Biver will not only be able to make decisions on a regular basis, but will be able to still lead a lot of TAG Heuer brand direction for several years to come.

With that said, it will not be forever, and eventually a new breed of watch manager will need to take the helm at LVMH. A major problem in the watch industry right now is the shortage of good managers. And by “good” I mean managers who understand the product, the production process, the customer, the brand, the marketing needs, and the markets themselves. These people are extremely difficult to come by, which is compounded by the fact that there are no watch industry manager schools or educational programs around. Instead, the watch industry has been forced to hire managers of various aptitudes who usually feel crippled by complicated industry norms that are not echoed in their previous career’s experience. The watch industry is a special beast – and someone like Jean-Claude Biver had an extremely valuable education."
Michael Kors Hopes to Become an American Version of LVMH With $2B Versace Buyout - Observer,"Mon, 24 Sep 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQmh0dHBzOi8vb2JzZXJ2ZXIuY29tLzIwMTgvMDkvbWljaGFlbC1rb3JzLWJ1eXMtdmVyc2FjZS1sdm1oLWNvYWNoL9IBRmh0dHBzOi8vb2JzZXJ2ZXIuY29tLzIwMTgvMDkvbWljaGFlbC1rb3JzLWJ1eXMtdmVyc2FjZS1sdm1oLWNvYWNoL2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Italian fashion house Versace will soon have an American owner. U.S. handbag maker Michael Kors is nearing a deal to acquire the 40-year-old family-owned luxury brand for about $2 billion, Reuters first reported on Monday morning.

Versace chairman Santo Versace and his sister Donatella Versace, the company’s chief designer, are set to announce the buyout to employees at a meeting on Tuesday, two people familiar with the situation told Bloomberg.

Michael Kors will be buying shares from the Versace family, who own 80 percent of the company, and private equity giant Blackstone Group, which owns the remaining 20 percent.

Under the agreement, Blackstone will fully exit Versace, while Santo and Donatella will remain in their roles within the company. The duo have been running the 40-year-old brand since their sibling Gianni Versace, who founded Versace and served as its first creative director, was murdered by a spree killer in Miami, Florida in 1997.

If closed, the deal will mark a milestone in Michael Kors’ effort to become an American fashion conglomerate and join the ranks of European rivals like French luxury giant LVMH, which owns 70 top-tier luxury and beauty brands including Louis Vuitton, Dior, Fendi and Sephora, as well as domestic competitor Tapestry, which owns Coach and Kate Spade.

Last year, Michael Kors bought London-based luxury shoemaker Jimmy Choo for $1.2 billion.

Acquisitions like Versace and Jimmy Choo are crucial in maintaining Michael Kors’ relevancy in the global luxury market, with its namesake handbag and accessory brands gradually losing foothold in the space. Michael Kors is currently in the process of closing 100 to 125 stores.

To Versace, the sale came at a prime time, as the company just recently returned to profitability in 2017 after years of struggling sales. Women’s Wear Daily reported over the weekend that both Tapestry and LVMH, as well as French luxury group Kering SA, had considered the deal, but deemed the price too high.

“They didn’t feel the need to invest so much money into another Italian fashion brand. It was overpriced,” a person familiar with the deal told Reuters."
EXCLUSIVE: LVMH Taps Designer to Revive Jean Patou - WWD,"Mon, 24 Sep 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3dkLmNvbS9mZWF0dXJlL2V4Y2x1c2l2ZS1sdm1oLXRhcHMtZGVzaWduZXItdG8tcmV2aXZlLWplYW4tcGF0b3UtMTIwMjgxNjgwOC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS — LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton is applying its formidable finances and management might to revive the dormant Jean Patou fashion house, WWD has learned.

Sidney Toledano, chairman and chief executive officer of LVMH Fashion Group, is spearheading the project and has already selected and signed on a designer to lead it: Guillaume Henry.

Last March, Henry exited Nina Ricci and he is said to be passionate about the legacy of Patou, a French designer who brought modernity and buzz to fashion in the Twenties — and innovated in business with fragrances, logos and sport clothes.

LVMH is now in the throes of building teams around Henry with a view to launching the first collection of ready-to-wear and accessories in the second half of 2019.

It is understood the group views Patou as something of a niche, rarified name — and not its next megabrand. Consequently, LVMH will likely start with a single boutique, most likely in Paris, along with e-commerce and select wholesale partners.

The relaunch suggests the world’s largest luxury group is anticipating an easing of the streetwear craze, and a swing of the fashion pendulum back to sophisticated chic.

Toledano confirmed hiring Henry exclusively to WWD, but said it’s too soon to detail more of the strategy.

He is said to be zeroing in on an executive to lead the Patou house from within LVMH’s ranks.

The group quietly acquired majority control of Patou this year, though its first volley was hard to miss: Taking the name of the fashion house’s most famous fragrance, Joy, and stamping it on a new Dior scent fronted by “Hunger Games” and “Silver Linings Playbook” actress Jennifer Lawrence. (She also starred in the 2015 drama “Joy.”)

While Dior Parfums never explained how it wrangled the name in its press packet about the new scent, fragrance aficionados know Joy is a marvel. Created for Patou in 1929 as a reaction to the stock market crash that year, Joy was voted Scent of the Century by the public at the Fragrance Foundation FIFI Awards in 2000, edging out Chanel No. 5. Joy was often touted as one of the costliest perfumes in the world to produce, owing to its high concentration of natural flower essences. (One perfume bottle contained the essence of as many as 336 roses and 10,600 jasmine flowers, according to one report.)

LVMH acquired the Patou brand from London-based Designer Parfums, whose founder and ceo Dilesh Mehta was looking for a partner to revive the fashion house and approached LVMH. It is understood Mehta and LVMH forged a deal allowing LVMH to use the Joy name for Dior, while waking up another of fashion’s sleeping beauties.

Born in 1887, Patou is considered one of the great names of couture of the Twenties and Thirties, prized for the glamor and showmanship he brought to high fashion. He opened his house in 1914, served in the First World War, and resumed business in 1919 with a Paris shop called Parry.

More than a designer, Patou was a fashion trailblazer, one of the first to launch a diffusion line, promote sportswear and push accessories. He even installed a bar in his salon to serve alcohol to customers during fittings.

His fashions often made waves, as in 1929 when he proposed ankle-length skirts and natural waistlines. Patou is credited with pioneering the tennis skirt, knitted swimwear, men’s designer neckties and sunscreen.

He famously dressed Barbara Hutton for her 1933 wedding to Prince Alexis Mdivani, and in 1925 designed a dark daytime dress with an embroidered Eiffel Tower that was a precursor to today’s high-tech clothing: The landmark was topped by a tiny electric bulb operated by the wearer.

After Patou’s death in 1936, the house continued under his brother-in-law Raymond Barbas, who conscripted a series of resident designers, including Marc Bohan (who later took up the mantle at Christian Dior), Karl Lagerfeld, Jean Paul Gaultier, Angelo Tarlazzi and Christian Lacroix, whose stint from 1982 to 1986 attracted the attention of LVMH kingpin Bernard Arnault, who poached Lacroix and built a couture house in his name.

Patou has also passed through several owners. Procter & Gamble Co. purchased the brand from Jean Patou SA in 2001, flipping it to Designer Parfums in 2011.

To be sure, LVMH has deep experience cultivating and animating heritage fashion brands as diverse as Louis Vuitton, Givenchy, Loewe and Celine, the latter now under the stewardship of Hedi Slimane.

In Henry, Toledano found a young designer who breathes Parisian chic, and boasts experience at a number of fashion houses.

After graduating from the École Supérieure des Arts Appliqués Duperré, Henry completed a postgraduate program in design at the Institut Français de la Mode. He worked in the studios of Givenchy and Paule Ka before taking the creative helm of Carven in 2009.

Henry forged his reputation there by revving up Carven as a contemporary label with a bold, young — and accessible — approach to Parisian chic.

After an acclaimed five-year run at Carven, Henry left for Nina Ricci in 2015, exiting that brand in March after completing his initial three-year contract. His designs for Ricci proved popular with celebrities like Gigi Hadid, Rihanna and Queen Letizia of Spain."
LVMH’s head of watches calls time on his operational role - Style,"Fri, 21 Sep 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjbXAuY29tL21hZ2F6aW5lcy9zdHlsZS9uZXdzLXRyZW5kcy9hcnRpY2xlLzIxNjUxMzUvamVhbi1jbGF1ZGUtYml2ZXItbHZtaHMtaGVhZC13YXRjaGVzLWNhbGxzLXRpbWUtaGlz0gF0aHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAuc2NtcC5jb20vbWFnYXppbmVzL3N0eWxlL25ld3MtdHJlbmRzL2FydGljbGUvMjE2NTEzNS9qZWFuLWNsYXVkZS1iaXZlci1sdm1ocy1oZWFkLXdhdGNoZXMtY2FsbHMtdGltZS1oaXM?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"“I am giving up my operational responsibilities, but I’m staying as non-executive president of LVMH’s watch unit and its three watch brands, TAG Heuer, Zenith and Hublot,” Biver, 69, who was born in Luxembourg, said on Thursday.

Jean-Claude Biver has confirmed reports that he is to relinquish his operational responsibilities as the head of the watch division at the French multinational luxury goods conglomerate, LVMH.

“I’ll no longer be cutting the onions and crying in the kitchen early in the morning, I’ll just come later to see if they are ready,” Biver, who has been suffering from serious health problems in recent months, added.

He said he was doing better, but had not yet fully recovered.

Biver, one of the Swiss watch industry’s best-known and most successful managers, joined LVMH in 2008 when it acquired the Hublot brand he was leading at the time.

He was appointed president of LVMH’s watch business in 2014.

LVMH’s watch and jewellery division had sales of €3.8 billion (US$4.5 billion) in 2017, up 12 per cent on a like-for-like basis, which strips out currency swings and acquisitions.

LVMH’s watch and jewellery division had sales of €3.8 billion (US$4.5 billion) in 2017, up 12 per cent on a like-for-like basis, which strips out currency swings and acquisitions.

Jewellery is being managed separately and has not been part of Biver’s responsibilities.

He declined to comment on a media report published on Wednesday in French magazine Challenges that he would be replaced by Stephane Bianchi, a former CEO of French cosmetics group Yves Rocher.

Challenges also reported that Frederic Arnault, the 23-year-old son of Bernard Arnault, LVMH’s chairman and CEO, would take on more responsibilities at TAG Heuer, the conglomerate’s biggest watch brand, as head of strategy and digital.

LVMH, the world’s biggest luxury goods group, which is controlled by the Arnault family, declined to comment.

Frederic Arnault had already been working at Tag Heuer over the past year as head of connected technologies, dealing with its smartwatches.

LVMH Announces Revamp of Dormant Jean Patou Brand - The Fashion Law,"Mon, 24 Sep 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWZhc2hpb25sYXcuY29tL2FmdGVyLXF1aWV0bHktYWNxdWlyaW5nLWRvcm1hbnQtamVhbi1wYXRvdS1icmFuZC1sdm1oLWFubm91bmNlcy1hLXJldmFtcC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Jean Patou was one of most influential couturiers in Paris in the 1920’s. The late designer – who is known for eradicating the flapper look in the 1930s by lengthening the skirt, designing sportswear for women, inventing knitted swimwear and the tennis skirt – was so thoroughly in demand by the new post-World War I female consumer that his eponymous label rivaled the great Coco Chanel, who was also busy at the time, helping to embolden women and free them from traditional wares, such as binding corsets and lengthy skirts.

While Ms. Chanel’s name and her brand are still two of the most well-known in the fashion world even some 47 years after her death, Patou’s label has been dormant since 1987. After his death in 1936 at age 55, Patou’s brand was sustained, with big names, such as Marc Bohan, Karl Lagerfeld, Jean Paul Gaultier, and Christian Lacroix, respectively taking up the helm, but the storied house ultimately went quiet, save for a reintroduction of its perfume collection by a licensee in recent years.

Now, 31 years later, LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton is “applying its formidable finances and management,” per WWD, to revamp Patou’s celebrated house. The Paris-based luxury behemoth – which owns Louis Vuitton, Christian Dior, Givenchy, Celine, and Marc Jacobs, among other fashion and non-fashion brands – has tapped former Dior CEO and current Chairman and CEO of the LVMH Fashion Group Sidney Toledano and Guillaume Henry, the former creative director of Carven and Nina Ricci, to embark on an turnaround effort, one that is expected to debut next year.

Since this summer, Patou’s brand – i.e., the rights in its name and various other intellectual property, including its archive – has been quietly sitting under the expansive umbrella that is LVMH after what the press has called a “stealth” acquisition by the Bernard Arnault-chaired group. The assets of the almost entirely dormant brand – save for its fragrance arm – had been owned for the past 7 years by UK-based Designer Parfums, a premium fragrances and beauty licensee.

The acquisition comes after almost exactly one year after Toledano was appointed to the role of chairman of the Jean Patou board in September 2017, replacing Nikita Mehta, the 28-year-old daughter of Dilesh Mehta, the CEO and founder of Designer Perfumes. And still yet, the news follows from Dior’s very recent launch of a fragrance called JOY, the same name as a fragrance that Jean Patou first began selling in 1929. (It is worth noting that the Patou acquisition means that LVMH-owned Dior can sell the same-named fragrance without fear of trademark litigation).

Revamps in fashion are no small – or risk-less – task. You may recall the failed effort by The Weinstein Company, along with actress Sarah Jessica Parker, Jimmy Choo co-founder Tamara Melon, and celebrity stylist Rachel Zoe, to resurrect the Halston brand almost a decade ago. Weinstein then went on to try to revamp the Charles James brand, again without any luck. Or how about the much more recent attempts to bring Helmut Lang’s brand back to its 1990’s relevance?

LVMH has had quite a bit more success in this arena. For instance, Groupe Arnault, LVMH chairman Bernard Arnault’s holding company bought, Paris-based leather goods brand Moynat in 2010 and relaunched it a year later. And not for nothing, prior to LVMH’s acquisition of Celine, the Paris-based “it” brand was nearly dormant, as well. Even Christian Dior – which was brought into the fold in 1984 when Arnault acquired Agache-Willot-Boussac, a nearly bankrupt textile group that, at the time, owned the Christian Dior assets – was in need of a dire restructuring.

It will likely be able to work its magic with this one, too."

Frederic Arnault, the next gen of the world’s leading family-owned luxury products group, has been promoted as part of a restructure of leadership of the group’s wristwatch brands.

LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton announced Frederic was appointed to strategy and digital director at TAG Heuer when it confirmed Stephane Bianchi, a former chief executive of French cosmetics group Yves Rocher, would succeed Jean-Claude Biver (69), the renowned non-family executive credited for revitalising the group’s watch brands. Biver relinquished operational duties due to ill health, but will remain as the non-executive president of the unit.

Frederic is the 23-year-old son of Bernard Arnault, chairman and chief executive of LVMH, and worked on TAG Heuer smartwatches as the brand’s head of connected technologies for the past year.

Bernard has long positioned his heirs in pivotal roles within LVMH. His son Alexandre, Frederic’s brother, was appointed co-chief executive of German luggage maker Rimowa at the age of 24 in 2016. Delphine (43), Ferderic’s sister, is the director and executive vice president of Louis Vuitton, and was the youngest person to join the LVMH board in 2003. Antoine (41) is the chief executive of Berluti and chairman of Loro Piana, both part of LVMH.

LVMH reported in July the “good performance” of its portfolio of watch and jewellery brands, up 8% to €1.98 billion ($2.33 billion) in the first half of 2018 on the first half of 2017. The group posted revenue of €21.8 billion ($25.6 billion) in the first half of this year, an increase of 10%.

European anti-trust regulator probes family carmakers in ‘circle of five’

The European Commission has launched a probe into whether a group of European carmakers, including family-owned BMW and Volkswagen, colluded on the development of clean emissions technology.

The commission alleges the carmakers came together, in breach of European Union antitrust rules, to avoid competition on the development and roll-out of technology to clean the emissions of petrol and diesel passenger cars.

The investigation focuses on information indicating that BMW, Daimler, VW, Audi and Porsche, also called the “circle of five”, participated in meetings where they discussed the development and deployment of technologies to limit harmful car exhaust emissions.

The commission said at this stage there was no indication that the parties coordinated with each other on the use of illegal ""defeat devices"" to cheat regulatory testing.

According to media reports, Daimler acknowledged last October it had self-reported the issue to the authorities and applied for leniency. VW had alerted the commission to a possible issue in 2016 and BMW denied there was any wrongdoing.

BMW is 50% publicly floated, but its voting shares are controlled by German siblings Stefan Quandt and Susanne Klatten. The global group reported a 2017 net profit of €8.7 billion ($10.7 billion), up from $8.5 billion the year before. Revenue was $122 billion.

Volkswagen AG is controlled by the holding company of Germany’s Porsche and Piech families. VW enjoyed record sales in 2017, with a 143% year-on-year profit increase in 2017, to €3.3 billion ($4.1 billion).

Family-owned Lego’s consumer reputation beats Google and Amazon

The Danish family owned toy giant Lego has climbed two places and beaten PlayStation, Google, Netflix and Amazon in a new study into the most relevant brands in British consumers’ lives.

Lego was second only to Apple in the UK edition of the 2018 Prophet Brand Relevance Index. Marketing consultancy Prophet surveyed 11,500 UK consumers on more than 240 brands in 27 industries to measure ""customer obsession, ruthless pragmatism, pervasive innovation, and distinctive inspiration"".

The study said for Lego, Fitbit (in sixth place) and WhatsApp (22nd place) it was “no longer about treating customers as buyers, but more about developing an ever-growing user base that can be tapped into in innovative, creative and community-led ways.”

Rune Gustafson, EMEA president at Prophet, said besides being technology-led disruptive companies, what many of the top 10 brands had in common was “they’re fast earning consumer trust by leveraging data to enhance the brand experience and connect with consumers on a deeper and more personal level.”

Lego’s robust reputation in the UK may be a comfort to the company, owned by the Kirk Kristiansen family. While global consumer sales grew 1% in the first half of 2018, revenue was down 5% to DKK 14.3 billion ($2.2 billion) and net profit was 10% to DKK 3 billion ($474 million). The declines were driven mainly by the weakening of the US dollar, Lego Group said."
"Mo√´t Hennessy, Alibaba to Unbottle 'New Retail' Experiences - Alizila","Tue, 04 Sep 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFsaXppbGEuY29tL21vZXQtaGVubmVzc3ktYWxpYmFiYS10by11bmJvdHRsZS1uZXctcmV0YWlsLWV4cGVyaWVuY2VzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"|

Alibaba Group and LVMH-owned wine and spirits brand Mo√´t Hennessy are teaming up to explore more opportunities in New Retail, the companies said.

Mo√´t Hennessy will partner with the Chinese e-commerce giant to roll out online-to-offline initiatives in a push to draw more young consumers in its second-largest market after the U.S. The companies also will offer exclusive benefits and priority-purchase privileges for some of Mo√´t Hennessy’s newest products in China to users of Alibaba’s shopping channels, including the B2C shopping site Tmall, Tmall’s Luxury Pavilion and the New Retail-driven Hema (now also known as Freshippo) supermarket.

Last Friday, as part of its first Super Brand Day campaign, the brand debuted its V.S.O.P. Privil√®ge, which pays tribute to the 200th anniversary of Mo√´t Hennessy’s classic cognac blend, exclusively on Tmall.

Nearly all of the limited-edition spirit offered on Tmall sold out that day, setting a new sales record for the store in the first 15 hours.

“Mo√´t Hennessy has moved at a faster rate than any other Western spirit brands on our platform, both in New Retail initiatives and everyday operations,” said Wang Dan, head of the food division at Tmall.

Western spirits’ gross merchandise volume on Alibaba’s platforms are forecasted to rise by 50% this year, per an August report jointly released by Tmall and Mo√´t Hennessy. The GMV for the wine and spirits category exceeded RMB 60 billion ($8.79 billion) in 2017, and is expected to grow 20% this year.

Andrew Khan, vice president of marketing at Mo√´t Hennessy Diageo China, said there was “huge potential in the China market” for the company.

“Historically, the majority of our business comes from Southern cities. And partnering with Tmall is a great way for us to develop opportunities in other regions,” he said. “Tmall has a particularly strong foundation in Hangzhou and other cities in the eastern region, and can help us uncover deeper insights into consumer behaviors and preferences.”

Khan noted that the wider geographic coverage would bolster the brand’s customer-fulfillment capabilities, delivering wine and spirits to customers on-demand.

Mo√´t Hennessy first launched a flagship store on the e-commerce site in July last year, during which it sold a limited-edition Hennessy Beaut√© du Si√®cle cognac for RMB 1.5 million ($220,000)—setting a new record for the site’s highest-priced cognac transaction.

Last July, the brand also debuted the Mini Mo√´t, a 200-milliliter version of its popular Mo√´t & Chandon champagne, which consumers can consume in one sitting, straight from the bottle. The mini-bottle trend caught on, and the brand later expanded its offerings with Tmall-exclusives such as the 200ml version of its Hennessy Classivm and the 100ml Glenmorangie scotch whisky.

According to March report on China’s wine market by the Hong Kong Trade Development Council, about 73% of mainland Chinese respondents preferred the small-bottle format over the market standard of 750ml.

“Quality is the most important thing for us. We can certainly launch new products [in collaboration with Tmall], but it will need to be driven by strong reasons and a thorough understanding of the market,” said Khan.



And it won’t be the first time Mo√´t Hennessy developed new products for the booming spirits market. In 2011, the brand released the Hennessy Classivm cognac with Chinese millennials in mind. The carafe, also available in a 20ml bright-green bottle, aims at channels closest to China’s young consumers, such as karaoke bars and convenience stores.

ZURICH (Reuters) - Jean-Claude Biver is dropping his operational responsibilities as the head of LVMH's watch division, he told Reuters over the phone on Thursday, confirming media reports.

""I am giving up my operational responsibilities, but I'm staying as non-executive president of LVMH's watch unit and its three watch brands, TAG Heuer, Zenith and Hublot,"" said Biver, 69.

""I'll no longer be cutting the onions and crying in the kitchen early in the morning, I'll just come later to see if they are ready,"" said Biver, who has been suffering from serious health problems in recent months. He said he was doing better, but had not yet fully recovered.

Biver, one of the Swiss watch industry's best-known and most successful managers, joined LVMH in 2008 when the Hublot brand he was leading at the time was acquired by the French group. He was appointed head of LVMH's watch business in 2014.

LVMH's watch and jewelry division had sales of 3.8 billion euros ($4.5 billion) in 2017, up 12 percent on a like-for-like basis, which strips out currency swings and acquisitions. Jewelry is being managed separately and is not part of Biver's responsibilities.

Biver declined to comment on a media report published in French magazine Challenges on Wednesday that he would be replaced by Stephane Bianchi, a former CEO of French cosmetics group Yves Rocher.

Challenges also reported that Frederic Arnault, the 23-year-old son of LVMH's Chairman and CEO Bernard Arnault, would take on more responsibilities at TAG Heuer, LVMH's biggest watch brand, as head of strategy and digital.

LVMH - the world's biggest luxury goods group, which is controlled by the Arnault family - declined to comment.

Most investors favour these big stocks due to their strong balance sheet and high market liquidity, meaning there are an adundance of stock in the public market available for trading. In times of low liquidity in the market, these firms won’t be left high and dry. They are also relatively unaffected by increases in interest rates. Using the most recent data for MC, I will determine its financial status based on its solvency and liquidity, and assess whether the stock is a safe investment.

Check out our latest analysis for LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton

How does MC’s operating cash flow stack up against its debt?

MC’s debt levels have fallen from €13.09b to €12.37b over the last 12 months , which is made up of current and long term debt. With this reduction in debt, MC currently has €4.96b remaining in cash and short-term investments for investing into the business. Moreover, MC has produced cash from operations of €7.94b during the same period of time, leading to an operating cash to total debt ratio of 64.2%, indicating that MC’s debt is appropriately covered by operating cash. This ratio can also be a sign of operational efficiency as an alternative to return on assets. In MC’s case, it is able to generate 0.64x cash from its debt capital.

Can MC pay its short-term liabilities?

Looking at MC’s most recent €15.77b liabilities, it appears that the company has been able to meet these obligations given the level of current assets of €22.17b, with a current ratio of 1.41x. Generally, for Luxury companies, this is a reasonable ratio since there is a bit of a cash buffer without leaving too much capital in a low-return environment.

ENXTPA:MC Historical Debt September 21st 18

Can MC service its debt comfortably?

With a debt-to-equity ratio of 39.3%, MC’s debt level may be seen as prudent. MC is not taking on too much debt commitment, which can be restrictive and risky for equity-holders. We can test if MC’s debt levels are sustainable by measuring interest payments against earnings of a company. Preferably, earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) should be at least three times as large as net interest. For MC, the ratio of 221x suggests that interest is comfortably covered. It is considered a responsible and reassuring practice to maintain high interest coverage, which makes MC and other large-cap investments thought to be safe.

Story continues

Next Steps:

MC’s debt level is appropriate for a company its size, and it is also able to generate sufficient cash flow coverage, meaning it has been able to put its debt in good use. Furthermore, the company exhibits an ability to meet its near-term obligations, which isn’t a big surprise for a large-cap. Keep in mind I haven’t considered other factors such as how MC has been performing in the past.

Les Journées Particulières is an open house event that invites visitors to interact with world-renowned LVMH artisans around the world. Now, including Sephora Shanghai, this year’s Les Journées Particulières will reach 77 venues across five continents and 14 countries, making it a truly global celebration of luxury, art, and culture. “Each [LVMH] site was chosen for its innovative features and exceptional customer experience that capture the highest values of LVMH and Sephora,” said Lapuente.

Sephora’s Shanghai flagship store will offer fragrance, makeup, and skin care workshops to 180 guests this October 12 to 14. Interested participants can book online from September 22. Lapuente will also visit China in early September to inspect the site and review the ambitious program of new store openings.

Sephora will open its first concept store in Asia in Shanghai this month. The brand, with a presence in 34 countries worldwide and online, has recently appointed Chinese singer Huang Zitao , a new-generation singer with a bold makeup style, as the brand spokesperson for its latest campaign ""My Beauty Power.""

Sephora also just launched a mini-program store on WeChat. Through the mini store, Chinese beauty lovers can stay updated on global trends, book makeup services, and order the latest products. The Sephora x Marvel collection was launched at the mini store ""to inspire everyone to release their superpowers,"" according to the brand's press office.

I am really excited that Sephora will be participating [in the LVMH open house] for the first time, with eight sites across France, Spain, Italy, the United States, and China. In particular, the Shanghai flagship store has the honor to be the only Les Journées Particulières site in China.

The Shanghai flagship store is our biggest in China, with a spectacular range of beauty brands and exclusive services. The building, with its dramatic red staircase and Sephora’s signature black and white stripes appearing as flowing light ribbons on the façade, used to be the most famous children’s goods destination in Shanghai, so it evokes sweet memories for many locals.

By participating in this open house, I think we will increase awareness of our membership in the [LVMH] Group. It will also reinforce Sephora's standing in China as the ultimate beauty retailer, as we always aim to ""teach, inspire and play."" The timing is also right to boost our presence in China. We will open over 20 new stores each year in China over the next five years.

Our digital team is constantly looking at new developments in virtual reality and artificial intelligence. Our Virtual Artist app enables customers to try on makeup instantly and was named by Forbes magazine as one of the nine most powerful real-world applications of augmented reality. Cloud Shelf is another innovation that allows customers to navigate, search and order products via a voice-interactive and touchable in-store digital screen.

The Beauty Playhouse was a vibrant and quirky pop-up designed to celebrate Sephora's ten-year anniversary in Singapore. Visitors could slide down the colorful Cream Lip Slide, indulge in the life-sized Fenty Beauty’s new Moroccan Spice Eyeshadow Palette, sample products at Fresh Beauty Kitchen or enjoy a Benefit Cosmetics-inspired ice cream. Around 25,000 people came to join the fun, creating over 100,000 posts on Instagram. Shanghai is a playground for creative consumer experiences, and we look forward to bringing such special experiences to all of our flagship stores, including those in China.

Our goal is not merely on retail transactions, but to build a social community for beauty lovers in China, driven by Sephora’s unique perspectives on beauty and authentic user-generated content. We believe this will transform China’s beauty customers from the current transactional followers to much more international and sophisticated makers and lovers of trends."

Vlada Haggerty filed suit late last week in a California federal court accusing the multi-billion dollar Los Angeles-based brand of “illegally and intentionally misappropriating [her] Liquid Gold Lip Art photograph by incorporating the image into their clothing,” leaving her with “no choice but to file this lawsuit seeking damages that [her company] has suffered.”

According to the lawsuit suit, which was filed by Haggerty’s holding company Vladamua, LLC, she is “a Los Angeles-based makeup artist and photographer whose works of makeup art have been featured in fashion publications and art galleries all over all the world.” In particular, Haggerty “is especially well-known for her works of lip art, which feature close-up photographs of lips decorated with unique makeup designs,” including Liquid Gold, a photo of which Haggerty says she posted on her Instagram account on or about May 5, 2015.

Fast forward more than 3 years to August 2018 and Haggerty says that she sent Guess a cease and desist letter, alerting the brand to her rights in the Liquid Gold work and demanding that it cease its use of the image. Moreover, Haggerty sought monetary compensation in connection with Guess’ use of the image on its apparel.

Guess responded to Haggerty’s letter on September 13, according to the complaint, by “‘vigorously deny[ing]’ that the apparel infringes [Haggerty’s] copyright, despite it clearly being [Haggerty’s] photograph.” That same day, Haggerty “informed GUESS that [she] would file and litigate the dispute if GUESS did not agree to remedy the situation immediately.” However, “Despite knowledge that this suit would be filed, and ample time to remedy the situation, [Guess] has refused to cease their infringement or to pay [Haggerty] its rightful licensing fee.”

As a result of its “deliberate” infringement and its “willful disregard for [Haggerty’s] intellectual property rights,” Guess “must now answer for its infringing conduct, which will include an injunction barring all future use of any and all apparel or images incorporating [Haggerty’s] copyrights, statutory damages, attorneys’ fees, costs, and [Guess’] profits and [Haggerty’s] actual damages for the copyright infringements.”

Guess did not respond to a request for comment.

REUTERS/Gonzalo Fuentes

PARIS (Reuters) - Designer Hedi Slimane gave Celine a rock-and-roll makeover in his much-hyped debut collection at the brand during Paris Fashion Week, with biker jackers, ultra-thin suits and sexy mini-dresses galore in a blunt departure from the label's past incarnations.

LVMH, the world's biggest luxury group and owner of mega-brands such as Louis Vuitton, is pushing Celine as its next star performer under Slimane, as it rolls out a men's line and fragrances, and further develops online sales.

Celine's former creative director Phoebe Philo, who stepped down in December, had already added to its appeal among fashionistas with a quality of understated elegance, and the label was also sought after for its handbags.

With Slimane - a trendsetter credited with revolutionising menswear with the razor-thin silhouettes he introduced at LVMH's Christian Dior in the early 2000s - Celine is in for radical change, beyond the accented ""e"" he has already ditched from the brand name, to a mixed reaction on social media.

A star-studded catwalk show just outside the Invalides monument in Paris where Napoleon is buried - attended by singer Lady Gaga, actress Catherine Deneuve and fashion royalty including self-professed Slimane fan Karl Lagerfeld - gave a sense of the brand's ambitions.

Following a quite literal drum roll by members of a special French gendarmerie unit, a model emerged from a sea of mirrors in a black and white, polka-dotted oversized bow of a mini-dress, setting the tone for a largely monochrome collection.

Black suits for him followed sexy, sequinned black dresses for her, with occasional splashes of silver and gold outfits fit for the disco, and buckled biker boots for a rock-and-roll edge.

The collection put Celine firmly in the sexy, evening-wear territory staked out by Saint Laurent - the brand owned by LVMH rival Kering and where Slimane held the design reins from 2012 to 2016 - at a time when other labels are turning out more so-called streetwear, with sportier looks and sneakers.

LVMH boss Bernard Arnault has said the group aims to grow annual revenue at Celine to between 2 billion and 3 billion euros ($2.3 billion - $3.5 billion) within five years, from close to 1 billion euros now.

Other high-stakes designer debuts in the past month of spring and summer fashion shows in New York, London and Milan included ex-Givenchy star Riccardo Tisci's first collection for Britain's Burberry.

A Baselworld Interview with LVMH Watch Division President Jean-Claude Biver - Watchtime.com,"Thu, 20 Sep 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndhdGNodGltZS5jb20vd3Jpc3R3YXRjaC1pbmR1c3RyeS1uZXdzL3Blb3BsZS9qZWFuLWNsYXVkZS1iaXZlci1zdGVwcGluZy1kb3duL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Yesterday, news broke from the French publication Challenges that LVMH Watch Division President Jean-Claude Biver would be stepping down from his day-to-day role overseeing the conglomerate’s “operational responsibilities” due to health concerns. That article was later confirmed by Biver himself during a phone interview with Reuters.

In this exclusive interview from Baselworld that WatchTime first published in April, Chronos Editor-in-Chief and Ebner Publishing International Editorial Director Rüdiger Bucher talks with Biver about many things, including his potential retirement at age 70 (today is actually Biver’s 69th birthday) and which of his brands he is most proud of.

Fred Merz Jean-Claude Biver, president of LVMH Watch Divison

The watch industry has just experienced one or two years of crisis, but now there seems to be a feeling of optimism everywhere. What is the outlook for your brands?

It’s just like for most of the Swiss watch industry, which is very good. But if everything is going well for everybody it’s impossible to know who is successful because of their substance and strength, and who is successful only because of the general trend. It is easier for us to gain market shares in times of crisis. TAG Heuer gained a total 39.5 percent from 2015 to 2017. The industry lost 12% during this same period.

To what do you attribute this – that TAG Heuer got this share of the market and gained in strength?

Many brands lose their courage when things go bad. They start looking to save in development and in marketing. We do just the opposite. Our brand has suddenly become more dynamic. Earlier it would have been inconceivable at TAG Heuer to be working with young artists such as Alec Monopoly and Cara Delevingne, or to become involved in the world of soccer. It was similar at Zenith, where tradition had almost become like a prison. But now we have new concepts that link Zenith to the future. This has an effect on the products and also on communication and research and development.

Artist Alec Monopoly (above) has designed a special-edition TAG Heuer watch (below).

Over the course of your career you’ve enjoyed great success with a variety of different brands: Blancpain, Omega, Hublot, TAG Heuer. Which of these means the most to you?

I am most proud of Hublot. And it’s also been my greatest success.

Even more than Blancpain?

Yes. And the thing that makes the success even greater is the fact that Hublot continues to grow, even though I haven’t been the CEO for the past six years. I don’t have anything to do with the business operations. It’s remarkable what Ricardo Guadalupe and his team are doing. They are developing the brand in exactly the direction I would have taken. Here’s one example: the Big Bang Red Magic with its case made of this fantastic bright red ceramic. This color was impossible to achieve in ceramic before, but now Hublot has gotten it, after years of work. I’m very proud of that.

The Hublot Big Bang Red Magic (above, and on the wrist, below)

How do you view the development of Zenith?

I’m very happy about that, too! Zenith is back on its feet again. And I can step back there also since Julien Tornare has taken over the helm.

And TAG Heuer? How long do you intend to lead that brand?

Until I’m 70. So, another year and a half.

You founded the research and development institute at the LVMH watch division. Does it work for all three brands, Hublot, TAG Heuer, and Zenith?

Yes, in principle. But Hublot has its own development department. That’s why orders for the institute come almost exclusively from Zenith and TAG Heuer. Of course, it’s conceivable that Hublot might suddenly need a technology that the manufacture cannot develop itself. That was the case, for example, with the Big Bang Referee 2018, the smartwatch for the World Cup. Hublot relied on the experiences that TAG Heuer had made with its Connected watch. Basically, the institute develops things that are interesting for every brand, like a new hairspring. It includes the work of engineers, mathematicians, experts in metallurgy. We have invested resources for the institute [equaling] somewhere around eight to nine million Swiss francs. This is especially interesting for a small brand like Zenith, which cannot provide resources of this level on its own.

You’re collaborating with universities, too.

Yes, with the Harvard Business School and the Universities of Delft and Lausanne.

The Zenith Defy Lab introduced a groundbreaking new escapement into watchmaking in 2017.

In 2017 Zenith introduced a movement with a very innovative escapement. So far it has only been used in a ten-watch limited edition. How long will it be until that model, the Defy Lab, can be mass-produced?

It should be ready by the end of 2018.

What difficulties did you need to address?

We do not manufacture various components of this movement ourselves, like those made of silicon. They are created by CSEM, a research and development center in Neuchâtel [Switzerland]. I’ll give you an example: At the beginning, there were certain wheels in the movement that were made of steel, not silicon. But, to put it simply, the metal and silicon parts did not work smoothly together. So we had to make some of these parts, which were originally not made of silicon, out of the silicon material. This kind of change means that everything had to be recalculated. Plus, the scientists at CSEM are independent, they don’t work for us. This all costs time, which you have to take into account in developing a groundbreaking technology like this. Right now we’re trying to manufacture between 1,000 and 3,000 by the end of 2018.

Are you able to provide the new Zenith caliber with additional functions?

Yes. That was an important point for us in the development phase. It is possible to add functions like a moon-phase indication or a chronograph.

Zenith is celebrating the 50th anniversary of El Primero in 2019. Where does the idea of the future fit in now?

We’ll make a new El Primero 1969. So, new products. We’re introducing an El Primero Flyback now. This is an interesting and meaningful addition. A split-seconds chronograph would also make good sense."

The Continental Shock of the Kors-Versace Deal (Published 2018) - The New York Times,"Tue, 25 Sep 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMTgvMDkvMjUvZmFzaGlvbi9taWNoYWVsLWtvcnMtdmVyc2FjZS1pbXBsaWNhdGlvbnMuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS — It’s official: America has its first global luxury group. Michael Kors’s purchase of the Italian brand Versace for $2.1 billion vaults the company — to be renamed Capri Holdings, after the Italian island — into the ranks of fashion conglomerates, a rarefied world defined by Kering and LVMH Möet Hennessy Louis Vuitton.

Everyone is chattering about what the deal might or might not do for growth, for taking advantage of the Asian market, for back-room synergies and so forth. In his announcement on Tuesday, John D. Idol, chief executive of Kors, called it a “milestone.”

He was right, and not just in terms of Kors but in terms of the fashion and luxury industry itself.

There are implications that go beyond the purely financial to the root of luxury identity and the international fashion world. And they have the potential to be as disruptive, and formative, as any revenue stream. They speak to national pride, and to luxury’s sense of its own history.

And that is why, even as analysts muse over the stock price implications, consumers have taken to Donatella Versace’s Instagram feed to voice their fears and horror about what it could mean, with comments such as: “donatella why would you sell versace? it’s an iconic ITALIAN brand. i’m a pround italian, why would you sell it to an american brand?”"

This week, China's second-largest e-commerce platform JD.com expanded its luxury portfolio after adding Hermès-backed Chinese label Shang Xia and prestige Italian jewelry brand Buccellati to its high-end portal TopLife.

On JD's Shang Xia store, consumers can purchase about 80 items ranging from furniture, apparel and accessories, priced between 85 (RMB 580) and 11,679 (RMB 80,000). Buccellati, on the other hand, launched three signature collections--Macri, Opera and Ramage--on the platform.

Currently, there are over 30 high-end luxury brands that have established stores on TopLife, including Balenciaga, Saint Laurent, Tod's, Canali and Mulberry.

French luxury conglomerate LVMH has recently teamed up with Chinese silk producer Wensli (“万事利”) to collaborate on silk production and technology, the financial media publication National Business Daily reported on August 31. It is the first time for the luxury giant to reveal the details of their Chinese partner, the publication noted.

The two-year collaboration will allow LVMH to use Wensli's core silk-making techniques for the production of their designs. Wensli Group was founded in 1975, and has become the leading player in silk-production in China in recent years.

This week, an op-ed by Chinese media outlet Jiemian argues that Chongqing, a sprawling municipality in southwestern China, has become the center of the country's streetwear and hip-hop culture. The publication claims that the culture and atmosphere of Chongqing share the ""keep real"" essence of what the streetwear and hip-hop trend is really about.

Many brands are taking note. The op-ed listed a number of international streetwear players, such as Supreme, Off-White and JOYRICH, which have all established a presence in the city earlier this year."

Xuzhi’s textile innovation and construction techniques have earned him nominations for the LVMH and International Woolmark prizes in 2016.

After graduating from Central Saint Martins with a BA in Womenswear Design, Chen briefly worked at Craig Green and J.W. Anderson before founding his label Xu Zhi in 2014. His approach to simplicity while retaining craftsmanship techniques led to rapid success and his collection was showcased in London, Paris, Milan and China.

Julie Gilhart , a fashion consultant who helped launch the LVMH Prize for emerging talent, considers Xu Zhi “a classic example of Chinese craftsmanship heritage with Western influences.” She told BoF: “You won’t see this regard for textiles anywhere else, but you can really notice it in China. It’s a sophistication that we need to acknowledge; it’s really interesting and we aren’t used to seeing it.”

Xuzhi was also nominated for the H&M Design awards in 2015 and was named in Forbes’ 30 under 30 list in Asia in 2017."
LVMH to revive Jean Patou under Guillaume Henry - TheIndustry.fashion,"Mon, 24 Sep 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWluZHVzdHJ5LmZhc2hpb24vbHZtaC10by1yZXZpdmUtamVhbi1wYXRvdS11bmRlci1ndWlsbGF1bWUtaGVucnkv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Luxury conglomerate LVMH is set to revive the historic house of Jean Patou under creative director Guillaume Henry, who has made a career of breathing new life into slumbering Parisian brands.

The house of Jean Patou, which was established by the designer of the same name in the 1910s, has been dormant since 1987, although it continued to make and market its own perfume, most notably Joy, and that of other brands.

Following the designer's untimely death in 1936 at the age of just 55, Patou's house was continued by his sister Madeleine and her husband Raymond Barbas.

A strong of high profile designers took over at the head of the house including Marc Bohan, Karl Lagerfeld, Jean Paul Gaultier and Christian Lacroix. The last collection was produced in 1987 when Lacroix left to establish his own label.

Now Henry, who revived both Carven and Nina Ricci, will take over and present his first collection as early as the first half of next year. Henry was creative director at Carven from 2009 to 2014 and was widely praised for taking the brand out of its haute couture niche and into more youthful, relevant ready to wear market. He joined Nina Ricci in 2015 where again he was credited with finding a new generation of customer (although his collections were not always a critical success) and he left earlier this year.

Patou himself, along with contemporary Coco Chanel, was famed for elongating the female silhouette with his longer hemlines in the 1930s, shifting the aesthetic away from the 1920s flapper look. He is credited with popularising knitwear and in particular the long-line cardigan and the ""tennis skirt"".

The brand has launched an Instagram page to mark the appointment of Henry and so far it contains just three posts; an image of Patou from the 1930s, a quote from Patou (""I am French and I detest extravagances""), and a picture of Henry. The posts simply declare that the house is back and more is to come."
"Jonathan Anderson: ""Fashion is a competition"" - Vogue Business","Fri, 28 Sep 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZvZ3VlYnVzaW5lc3MuY29tL2NvbXBhbmllcy9sb2V3ZS1qb25hdGhhbi1hbmRlcnNvbi1pbnRlcnZpZXfSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Key takeaways:

Anderson spent a year reimagining Loewe’s vocabulary before designing his first ready-to-wear collection out of a sense of responsibility to the fashion house’s heritage.

He says he avoids micromanaging because it hampers employees creativity.

The designer sees fashion as a competition to sell products but also pushes finance managers to think creatively.

In five years, 35-year-old Jonathan Anderson has remade the very foundations of Loewe, LVMH’s oldest luxury fashion house. When he joined, Anderson spent a year revamping every element of the brand — from the logo down to the style of the press release — before he began work on his ready-to-wear debut.

“I did not want Loewe to be built overnight because it had been tackled before, and it still had inherent problems,” the designer says from Loewe's Paris studio, where he works two days per week. (He spends the other three at the JW Anderson office in London.) “At the same time, I wanted something that felt like it had always been there.”

The result is a brand that feels rooted in craft and tradition, but that is simultaneously modern. Its leather and woven bags are luxurious, functional and distinctive. Its fashion vocabulary is defined. A Loewe garment— grounded in classicism, but with a clean, contemporary shape — is unmistakable on a clothing rail.

On remaking Loewe

“What happens to a lot of historical brands is that they get so many layers of paint that they literally become baroque. Everything gets boiled down to a tourist idea. So for me, it was how do you start taking layers of paint off over a four-year period. By taking all that away, you go into the focus of the material, the nappa, the leather, the hand. Loewe didn’t really have a clothing vocabulary before; it was selling bags. Now fashion is a very serious component. You’re building a fashion language with the historical weight of leather goods.""

On this season's woman

“I am looking in this collection at the idea of the line between happiness and sadness, what that is. So there’s a kind of melancholic feel to her. I was listening to Verdi music and thinking about how you feel uplifted, and at the same time, you feel emotional. We’re so used to dressing strong people, but what happens to the vulnerability? What does vulnerability mean? I think you need that in clothing, I think there needs to be that vulnerable edge. Is it in the sunglasses, hiding part of yourself? We do that. Or is it satin where it becomes very sleepy, seductive, seducing through touch?”"

Set for a release date of October 1, the Virgil Abloh x Moët & Chandon collaboration will be available in a limited 3L jeroboam bottle along with a 750ml “ready-to-wear” bottle. There is no info just yet on how much the 3L bottle will sell for, but the 750ml will be set at $59.99 USD. Look for these to also sell online at Clos19 come October 15.

Article originally published on September 6, 2018: Fresh from appearing on the cover of Business of Fashion‘s “#BoF500” issue, artist-designer Virgil Abloh teased a new collaboration with anther member of the LVMH conglomerate: Moët & Chandon. Posting on Instagram, the Louis Vuitton design head revealed a custom bottle featuring a number of signature touches.

The phrase “Do Not Drop” appears on the bottle with Virgil’s trademark use of quotation marks, with the classic “c/o” branding also present. The accompanying white box features the words “For Display Only,” which unfortunately could mean that the collaborative Virgil Abloh x Moêt & Chandon bottle will never get a wider release.

Burberry & LVMH - Hargreaves Lansdown,"Fri, 28 Sep 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhsLmNvLnVrL2Z1bmRzL2hsLWZ1bmRzL2hsLXNlbGVjdC9tYW5hZ2Vycy1ibG9nL2J1cmJlcnJ5LWFuZC1sdm1o0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Steve Clayton - Fund Manager 28 September 2018

Checking Out

We have sold the bulk of our position in Burberry, realising significant profits for the fund. We originally bought in to Burberry when the fund launched back in December 2016 and our recent sales have been made at a gain of over 50%, plus dividends received along the way.

Travelling and arriving

Burberry are currently undertaking a major revamp, aimed at elevating the brand ever higher into the luxury spectrum. When the strategy was launched the shares reacted badly because the market expected it to hold sales and profit growth back in the near term. We said at the time that we were holding on, because if successful, the strategy could bring big rewards.

Burberry CEO, Marco Gobbetti, hired a new design chief, Riccardo Tisci, who he had worked successfully with at Givenchy. Mr Tisci has just unveiled his first new ranges, created with the move upmarket in mind.

Having initially fretted over the new approach at Burberry, the market has now become an enthusiastic cheerleader for it and the shares have moved sharply higher. Gucci has had a very successful revamp in recent years and perhaps investors are reading across, but failing to recognise the different starting points for the two luxury brands.

We think that risk and reward are no longer attractive. At the levels where we were selling, Burberry was trading on around 28x next year’s consensus earnings. That is above its average valuation of recent years and it looks to be pricing in a great deal of success for Messrs Tisci and Gobbetti’s efforts.

That may come, but we felt there was little margin for error left for the stock, so we have taken some profits and moved on.

Foreign Travels

Burberry may seem fully priced, but the luxury goods industry as a whole has much to recommend it. Customers are well-heeled and are typically purchasing with wealth, not income, which can make the luxury consumer resilient to economic ill winds.

The products are desirable and exclusive and their price points allow efficient producers to make attractive margins and generate strong cash flows. Their retail outlets tend to be in prime locations and while online sales of luxury goods are rising, we feel there will always be demand for physical stores because the service element is a big part of the luxury shopping experience.

So we have taken advantage of the flexibility in the fund’s mandate to invest in LVMH. This is the first time the fund has bought an overseas stock and such holdings will always be a minority exposure, limited to no more than 20% of the fund’s value.

Although listed in France, LVMH earns its profits in many different currencies around the world. In the long run we expect the performance of the business itself to be the most important driver of returns, but owning overseas stocks does create the potential for currency gains or losses, on top of the underlying movement in the share price.

High Flyer

LVMH stands for Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton. While the initials may be mixed up, the group’s focus on luxury brands is not. It owns an unparalleled stable of labels stretching from Christian Dior to Givenchy, Tag Heuer to Bulgari, in categories from fashion through leather goods and into jewellery, fine champagnes and cognacs.

Valued at around €150bn, LVMH dominates the luxury sector. The group has been built up over more than forty years by Bernard Arnault, whose family own just over half of the group. The business operates globally and many of its brands have over a century of tradition behind them. Fashion and Leather Goods is the biggest earner within the group.

Despite being the biggest player, LVMH has been outgrowing its smaller rivals and organic growth has averaged over 8% p.a. since 2010. The virtuous circle of strong margins delivering buoyant cash flow to reinvest back into growing the business has been playing out well at LVMH and we think this can continue for some time to come.

Financially the group is strong. Leverage is less than 1x earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation and even if we treat their store leases as debts and recalculate the ratio accordingly, it doesn’t reach 2x.

We like the group’s strategy of controlling its own distribution globally for key brands. This allows it to keep control over where its brands are seen, vital to retaining cachet and maintaining price discipline.

Ticket price

Best of all, LVMH is currently trading on a significantly lower valuation than Burberry, at 23x forward earnings. Still not in the bargain basement, but given the group’s strength and diversity we think it looks the better way to invest in the luxury sector currently.

We still have a residual position left in Burberry, for the stock dipped back away from our selling levels before we had sold out completely. At this stage we view the position as an option. If it retreats too much, we could rebuild, or reduce it further into any renewed rally. We are in the territory where we feel agnostic towards it.

As regular readers of these blogs will know, our basic setting is a reluctance to trade for trading’s sake, since this incurs costs for uncertain rewards. So we may be left with a little dash of Burberry check in the fund for a while longer.
