Rogers was the CEO of Beats Music and moved to Apple after the company acquired Beats for $3 billion (£1.95 billion) in 2014 before heading up the re-launch as Apple Music. Rogers focused specifically on Beats 1, the online radio station that has gained approval from listeners and the media alike.

Apple Music Exec Ian Rogers Heads to French Luxury Giant LVMH - Vox.com,"Tue, 01 Sep 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZveC5jb20vMjAxNS85LzEvMTE2MTgyMDAvYXBwbGUtbXVzaWMtZXhlYy1pYW4tcm9nZXJzLWhlYWRzLXRvLWZyZW5jaC1sdXh1cnktZ2lhbnQtbHZtaNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Now we know where Apple music executive Ian Rogers is heading: He’s going to run digital for LVMH, the giant French luxury company.

Last week news broke that Rogers, a longtime digital music veteran who had helped Apple launch its new Apple Music subscription service, was leaving the company. But we didn’t know where he was going, beyond the fact it was supposedly in Europe.

So here are the details: Rogers will leave California and move to Paris, where he will be chief digital officer at LVMH, the holding company behind iconic luxury brands like Louis Vuitton, Marc Jacobs and Bulgari.

Prior to the LVMH job, Rogers has spent his entire life working in digital music: He started out helping the Beastie Boys get online, ran Yahoo Music for a while and was CEO of Beats Music before Apple acquired the company in 2014. At Apple, he helped the company retool Beats Music into Apple Music, and focused in particular on the Beats1 online radio station.

There’s no obvious connection between Rogers’s resume and his new company, which makes everything from Dom Pérignon champagne to Thomas Pink shirts. Except that Rogers is quite proudly a guy from small-town Goshen, Indiana, who likes the idea that he has been able to do cool things like fly private with Kid Rock.

Update: Sorry, turns out that’s a protected link. As a make-good, here’s exclusive footage of Rogers leaving for France.

LVMH Names Ian Rogers From Apple as Chief Digital Officer - WWD,"Tue, 01 Sep 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3dkLmNvbS9mZWF0dXJlL2x2bWgtY2hpZWYtZGlnaXRhbC1vZmZpY2VyLWlhbi1yb2dlcnMtMTAyMDkxMjYv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS — Apple Inc. has repeatedly raided the luxury world for senior executives, and now it’s Bernard Arnault’s turn to raid Apple.

The business titan has tapped Ian Rogers — who briefly headed up the launch of Apple Music — as the new chief digital officer at LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, a newly created position. The appointment could foreshadow new business vectors for the luxury giant, which in recent years has diversified from fashion, beauty, liquors and retail by expanding its holdings into hotels, yacht building and media.

“I am happy to welcome Ian into our group to strengthen our digital ecosystem,” Arnault said, noting that Rogers would “build on the foundations laid by Thomas Romieu,” an LVMH executive specialized in digital, and “take the houses to the next level and explore new opportunities for the group in the digital sphere.

“Ian will bring his extensive experience in high-end digital ventures and his innovation-driven spirit to develop LVMH leadership in the digital luxury field,” Arnault added.

Rogers last year joined Apple’s iTunes team as its senior director, only to exit shortly after the launch of its new streaming and radio service, Apple Music.

Rogers became chief executive officer of Beats Music, a maker of high-end headphones, in 2013 following a five-year stint as ceo of Topspin Media. Prior to that he founded Mediacode, which was purchased by Yahoo, where he became vice president and general manager of music. Rogers has also served as a Web master for Nullsoft and Beastie Boys, according to LVMH.



It is understood Arnault recently spent several days in Silicon Valley meeting with executives and touring companies there — and with his twentysomething son Alexandre in tow. Formerly a DJ, the student and budding luxury executive already works in the digital area at LVMH.

Louis Vuitton, Fendi, Dior, Sephora and Le Bon Marché are among brands in the group that already boast substantial online businesses.

“There seems to be among investors the perception that LVMH is lagging some of its luxury peers in terms of digital strategy. We disagree,” said Thomas Chauvet, luxury analyst at Citi. “LVMH has been working on these issues for many years, in particular at Sephora. Mr. Arnault has also been one of the first investors in Internet and e-commerce in the late Nineties.”

Chauvet said he does not expect major changes to the group’s digital strategy other than a gradual shift to a more efficient, service focused omnichannel strategy through technological investments.

“LVMH has always put the product and the physical store experience at the forefront of its strategy, with the digital experience and e-commerce sites being mainly used as communication and information tools about the brand before a physical transaction happens in-store,” he added.

But Luca Solca, managing director sector head of global luxury goods at Exane BNP Paribas, said the hire suggests LVMH is escalating its involvement in digital.

“They are not first, but ahead of the average,” he said. “My sense is that they are planning to focus more resources on this, and bet on internal development and management of this strategic side of the business.”

Donald Marchand, a professor of strategy execution and information management at Lausanne-based business school IMD, said he would expect Rogers to usher in a period of “testing and learning and new partnerships in order to figure out what to do for their businesses” and to attract new generations of customers weaned on online commerce.

He noted he could envision LVMH transforming its business through acquisitions of “adjacent businesses” on the one hand, and innovation and digital technology on the other by leveraging Rogers’ network of contacts and in high-tech fields.

“Clearly they have the resources to do that,” he said. “They need to do some experimenting, testing and learning what’s appropriate. What products the customer wants is going to be the guessing game.”

Ashok Som, a professor of global strategy in the management department at ESSEC Business School, said he expects to “see more digital presence of LVMH brands that reinforces their omnichannel strategy while focusing on more innovation across the group in terms of digital media communication and reaching out to potential consumers across the globe.”

In addition, Som said he anticipates a “shift within the Millennial consumers using more and more digital media for making decisions on their purchase. To start, it may be for information gathering, following and knowing brands, knowing their story, knowing about the new products, testing new products.”

He forecast that entry-level and affordable luxury goods through e-commerce sites could reach as high as 20 percent of the revenues by 2020.

"LVMH poached a top Apple executive, proving luxury is finally getting serious about digital - Yahoo Finance","Tue, 01 Sep 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTWh0dHA6Ly9maW5hbmNlLnlhaG9vLmNvbS9uZXdzL2x2bWgtcG9hY2hlZC10b3AtYXBwbGUtZXhlY3V0aXZlLTE2NTU1NjQxNC5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Ian Rogers, who was CEO of Beats, left, and Dan Rookwood, U.S. Editor, MR PORTER, attend Digital Mavericks 2014 hosted by DETAILS and MR PORTER at 41 Ocean Club on Wednesday, April 16, 2014, in Santa Monica, Calif.

In the last few years, Apple has made a habit of pulling top talent from the fashion world. Now, the fashion world gets to return the favor.

Ian Rogers, a senior Apple executive who led the development of Apple’s Beats1 radio service and guided Apple’s online radio strategy, surprised everyone last week with news that he was leaving the company. At the time it was only known that he was moving to Europe to work in an unrelated industry. It’s now confirmed that he left Apple to take on the role of chief digital officer at LVMH, the luxury fashion group that owns brands such as Louis Vuitton, Céline, Dior, and Givenchy.

It’s one of the surest signs to date that LVMH, and luxury more broadly, is getting more serious about embracing digital. With a few exceptions—Burberry long ago jumped feet first into digital—luxury labels have been slow to go online, concerned that the sensory experience of their finely crafted, high-end wares would be diminished when digitized and shrunken to a two-dimensional, pixellated thumbnail. “Fashion is about clothing, and clothing you need to see, to feel, to understand,” Bruno Pavlovksy, president of fashion at Chanel, told Bloomberg.

Customers, however, are doing more of their shopping online, and luxury brands stand to miss out if they don’t pay attention.

A report by McKinsey (pdf) found that, while overall sales of luxury goods increased just 2% in 2013, online luxury sales jumped 20%. The consulting firm projects that online sales “will more than double to approximately €20 billion [$22.5 billion] in the next five years.”

A separate McKinsey report from earlier this year noted that “nearly half of luxury goods buying decisions are already influenced by what consumers hear or see online.” By 2018, it projected, global online sales of women’s luxury fashion will jump from 3% of the total market to 17%, totaling $12 billion.

Story continues

Rogers has worked his whole career in digital music. By securing the top music job at Apple, he seemed to have reached the pinnacle of the industry. His new task will be to help LVMH’s brands develop their e-commerce channels.

“I asked my wife the night of the Apple Music announcement: Was that the starting gun or the finish line for me in the digital music race?” Rogers told the New York Times on Sept 1. “I decided I’m ready for a new challenge both professionally and personally. I have more to learn and contribute.”

That LVMH tapped him shows the size and importance of that challenge. If other luxury brands don’t want to fall behind online, they’re going to have to start putting more muscle into digital as well.

Delphine Arnault – SURFACE - Surface Magazine,"Tue, 01 Sep 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiNWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN1cmZhY2VtYWcuY29tL2FydGljbGVzL2RlbHBoaW5lLWFybmF1bHQv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The executive vice president of LVMH has made it her mission to foster emerging designers under the umbrella of a brand that prizes quality about all.

The executive vice president of LVMH has made it her mission to foster emerging designers under the umbrella of a brand that prizes quality about all.

Surface recently met with Arnault at LVMH’s Paris headquarters to discuss the prize, the new Frank Gehry–designed Fondation Louis Vuitton building, and more.

It’s not all business for Arnault, though. Last year, she launched the LVMH Prize for Young Fashion Designers, creating the opportunity for international talents under 40 to pitch their brands directly to the company’s leaders. The competition, which recently wrapped its second iteration, features a panel that includes Simons, Ghesquière, Anderson, Riccardo Tisci (Givenchy), Karl Lagerfeld (Fendi), Marc Jacobs, Phoebe Philo (Céline), and Humberto Leon and Carol Lim (Kenzo), plus Arnault and LVMH executives Jean-Paul Claverie and Pierre-Yves Roussel. Each year, the winner receives a prize of 300,000 euros and a one-year mentorship from an internal team at LVMH. Last year’s winner was the brand of Canadian-born, London-based designer Thomas Tait; this year’s was another London-based label, Marques Almeida, run by Portuguese-born designers Marta Marques and Paulo Almeida.

Arnault has a keen eye for spotting new talent, not just with Simons, but also when she brought designer Nicolas Ghesquière on board as creative director of Louis Vuitton in 2013 (after his much discussed departure from Balenciaga). The same year, she was also instrumental in the hiring of J.W. Anderson to his post at Loewe and was closely involved with the purchase of British shoe designer Nicholas Kirkwood’s brand.

Since joining her family’s luxury goods conglomerate, LVMH, 15 years ago, Delphine Arnault has become a quiet force within both the company and the fashion industry at large. As the eldest child of Bernard Arnault, it may appear she has been groomed from the start—and that’s certainly true—but she has largely paved her own way, proving to be one of the savviest managers in fashion today. After a stint working for McKinsey & Company, she assumed the position of development director of the John Galliano fashion house in 2000. A year later, she became Dior’s managing director, where for a decade she ushered in strong growth and oversaw the hiring of Raf Simons as creative director. Now 40, she’s currently the executive vice president of Louis Vuitton, a position she has held for the past two years, and she sits on the boards of three brands under the LVMH umbrella: Céline, Loewe, and Emilio Pucci.

I wanted to discuss your current role at Louis Vuitton. I’m sure there’s no average day for you.

No. [Laughs]

Without oversimplifying it, how would you describe what you do?

Well, I’m in charge of the products. Not from the design perspective, of course, because Nicolas [Ghesquière] and Kim [Jones] are in charge of that. [My role] includes leather goods, the ready-to-wear, the shoes, and all the accessories. It means, in large part, also making certain that our vision and strategy are very clear and cohesive: where we want to go and what we want to develop. I work a lot with Nicolas and Kim on the products— again, not from a design perspective, but from a business one. I look at what markets need and want. I also work on the pricing and the margins, and on the merchandising until the products arrive in the shops.

What’s your relationship with the creative side? How do you work with Nicolas?

Nicolas is extremely talented with what he does—and what he has done—for Vuitton. He has a great vision, he’s very clear. Season after season, show after show, you have a clearer vision of the Louis Vuitton woman, what she looks like, who she is, what life she lives. I think that he’s not only a very gifted designer, but also very hard worker. He has a great team around him, composed of a lot of women. He likes to see different types of women, how they’re dressed and what they think, what bag they carry, what accessories they like. He’s very much inspired by the women he surrounds himself with, like Natasha Ramsay Levi or Camille Miceli. He’s working a lot on the different categories: ready-to-wear, of course, but also leather goods, accessories, and shoes. He’s also involved in communication and advertising. He has done an amazing job since he arrived in November 2013. Almost two years! I think it’s really an exciting moment for Vuitton.

It seems like you’re this bridge between the creative and business sides of the company. Are there any workplace mantras you follow? How do you balance the sort of right-brain/left-brain tension?

I’ve been in this industry since I was quite small. I started going into shops when I was 10. I’m used to going into shops on the weekend. Talking about the luxury environment, it’s been really part of my life for almost 30 years. As for the right brain/left brain, I think it’s really exciting to work at the same time with a creative director and an accountant or the CFO.

I don’t hear that it’s exciting to work with an accountant very often.

[Laughs] I know, but I find it very interesting to work with different personalities and people. To work at the same time with Nicolas, who’s extremely creative but also listens a lot—he wants the product to sell— along with someone from the atelier that has been working on the handbags at Vuitton for 30 years and has an amazing know-how of how you construct the bag, all this complexity really interests me.

Unlike a lot of people in positions similar to yours, you tend to shy away from the spotlight. Is this intentional?

I think it’s part of your personality, whether you like it or not. [Laughs] I don’t really like it.

Well, thank you for meeting with me, in that case.

I like meeting journalists. But it’s just that I prefer to work rather than to talk about work or myself.

Everything’s moving so quickly in fashion these days, but there are still products that are made and developed over longer periods of time that are meant to last. What’s the importance of this “slow design,” in a world where fast-fashion brands like Zara and H&M are producing products to fly off the shelves that won’t likely be wearable within a year?

At Louis Vuitton, there is no compromising quality. We produce our leather goods in our own ateliers. We have our own people who we’ve trained for years. Louis Vuitton is made in France. You’ll never see us do any markdowns. Everything that we sell is at the utmost quality. This has been our philosophy. It’s a mix of innovation, quality, and creativity. You were talking about products that take a long time to manufacture—for example, our trunks. They’re really the history of Vuitton and how we all started. The trunks sometimes take a lot of time to produce. Last year, we did a collaboration called Celebrating Monogram. Cindy Sherman did a trunk in a limited edition of 25 that was sold for 130,000 euros each. In our atelier, artisans who have been working with us for 30, 40 years made them. Some pieces are still being delivered, so it takes a lot of time to produce.

The Celebrating Monogram project involved a wide mix of collaborators, including Rei Kawakubo and Frank Gehry. How did that come to be? Frank Gehry is an obvious choice—he designed the new Fondation Louis Vuitton—but…

It was of the first projects I worked on when I arrived at Louis Vuitton, and it was great to work with them: Christian Louboutin, Frank Gehry, Cindy, Karl [Lagerfeld], Marc Newson, and Rei Kawakubo. It was really people who are “iconoclasts” and really in the moment—geniuses who are so relevant today. When you see the bag and the trunk of Karl, or the bag of Frank, or the backpack of Marc Newson, they’re each using our icon, the monogram. It’s had a great interest from our customers who were really interested in the product and also in the story around why we chose those designers and how they interpreted the brand and the monogram.

Louis Vuitton also has the ongoing Objets Nomades collection, which this year debuted new collaborations with three design studios—Raw Edges, Gwenaël Nicolas, and Damien Langlois-Meurinne—and has done pieces with the Campana Brothers, Patricia Urquiola, Barber and Osgerby, and others.

It’s very legitimate for Vuitton to collaborate with artists and to always invite geniuses or personalities who are outstanding to be a part of our brand and work together. Louis Vuitton is a brand that has a very big vocabulary.

When you were at Dior, the brand collaborated with the artist Anselm Reyle. How do you view the connection between art and fashion? Some people say fashion is art, which I think is absurd.

I don’t know if fashion is art, but at Vuitton there’s this history of collaborations with artists. It’s natural to invite personalities who are so relevant for a generation, or even for a century, to come and work on projects with us.

Let’s talk about the Fondation Louis Vuitton, which was largely your father’s project. What does it mean to you, both as his daughter and now that you’re in this top-level position at Louis Vuitton, to have a building like that and the art collection it houses?

Actually, it was very moving when it opened, because we had been hearing my father talk about it for 10 years. In France, things can take a lot of time. [Laughs] I think it’s something exceptional and spectacular. When I was there on the day of the inauguration, I was thinking of how important this building is, a beautiful gift for Paris because in 50 years it’s going to belong to the city.

I find the layout fascinating: You lose yourself in it. In a way, I think it’s a sort of metaphor for Louis Vuitton. The brand is so big, with so many facets and surprising collaborations around each corner. Both are also about fantasy. You’re losing yourself through the experience of exploring the museum or wearing something from the brand. These are obviously very separate worlds, but the idea of this dreamlike experience or mental escape could be where fashion and art connect. Do you agree?

What’s interesting about the Fondation is that each time you go, you discover something new, be it with art or even with the spaces. Each time I go there, I see something that I hadn’t noticed before. Frank Gehry said, I can’t wait for the Fondation to live, to have all these nationalities here, just filling the place up, and coming and visiting and having their own experiences. I could spend a lot of time there. The Fondation is a magical place.

In addition to being on the LVMH board, you serve on the boards of Emilio Pucci, Céline, and Loewe. You seem to have an affinity for the designs of Jonathan Anderson, Loewe’s creative director. When did you discover him?

Actually, it was Nicolas Ghesquière who discovered J.W. He said, “There’s someone you have to check out!” Nicolas was the first one who mentioned him, and then a lot of other people did.

Loewe’s been in the company’s portfolio since 1996, but under Jonathan Anderson it has changed drastically. Were you involved with that change? Where do you see Loewe going in terms of its business?

Well, Loewe is an extraordinary brand with a formidable heritage, especially as a leather goods company. The brand was founded in 1846, and it has been really important in the culture of the Spanish people. I think that Loewe needed a bit of modernity. Jonathan Anderson is really fascinated by this idea of heritage and modernity. He’s putting a lot of excitement into the brand. He’s been working really, really hard. He has both Loewe and his own [eponymous] brand to develop.

Loewe has a great retail network with a lot of stores and great locations in Asia. A little bit less in the U.S., but it’s in process. I think there’s a lot of potential for the brand.

What about Céline and Pucci?

At Pucci, there’s a new designer [Massimo Giorgetti], who just arrived. At Céline, Phoebe [Philo, its creative director] is fan – tastic. I’m a big fan of Phoebe. She really has a vision. When she took Céline in 2008, she completely transformed the brand. The vision for the brand is extremely clear. It’s really for a contemporary woman, for a young woman. Her work is anchored in a real and true vision of what a woman’s life is today. It’s perfect. I love the brand.

The use of Joan Didion in the ad campaign earlier this year was really smart—so unexpected but spot-on.

Everyone looks at what Phoebe does. She is so directional and influential.

Last year, you established the LVMH Prize. What was the impetus for starting it?

We had been thinking about doing it for a long time. We think that as the leader of our industry it’s our responsibility to find young talents and to help them grow. That’s the spirit of the prize. When I was first thinking of it, I was working at Dior—this was in 2013 — and I spoke a lot to Raf [Simons] about it. He helped me with finding the talents. For example, he had the idea to ask all the designers of the group to be part of the jury, and to have the best jury in the world. It’s something only LVMH can do, to have all these amazing designers who work for LVMH give their opinion and their point of view on the future designers.

During the deliberation, each finalist presents for 10 minutes in front of the jury. They each have two or three models wearing their clothes. We see the clothes on the models, and then they explain what their vision is, how they started, how they’re structured, and things they want to see for their brand. The jury then asks questions. After that, we have lunch with my father, and vote for the winner. For the votes, we discuss each candidate. We have little cards that we put in an envelope, so it’s kind of a secret vote. The lunch is a great moment because we’re all together and we can discuss and express our different points of view. The one who has the most votes wins.

And how do you choose the special runner-up honorees?

Also in the vote.

So whoever gets slightly fewer votes is a runner-up?

Yeah, exactly. So Marques Almeida won this year, and the special prize was given to [Simon Porte] Jacquemus.

Is there a dialogue between the judges and the presenting designer?

After their presentation, there are questions asked about the vision of their brand, or it can be about what department store they’re stocked at or anything about production. It’s really random questions.

For part of the selection process, LVMH works with a huge committee of editors and stylists from around the world. How did you put together that group of people, and what’s their role?

The prize is quite open, because each designer applies through the Internet. Anyone can have access to it, regardless of nationality. You have to be under 40 years old to apply, and your brand has to have at least two collections. This year we got more than 1,000 applicants. There’s an internal committee of people from LVMH and outside who look at all the applicants and reduce the list to around 25—this year, to 26. Next, we ask the opinions of a panel of around 40 what we call “experts,” such as Carine Roitfeld, Marie-Amelie Sauvé, Franca Sozzani, Patrick Demarchelier. This panel consists of editors, journalists, stylists, photographers, models, makeup artists, department stores’ executives, and buyers.

For the designers, even if they don’t win the prize, they get to meet all these people at once. During March Fashion Week, we organize an event where we invite all the experts, plus a lot of people from the industry, and each designer has a booth to show their clothes. The personalities come and look at what they do. It takes place at the LVMH headquarters on Avenue Montaigne. For two days, from 8 a.m. to 9 p.m., the 40 experts can come, take a moment in between the shows to look at the clothes and meet the designers. At the end of the two days, they have to vote for the eight designers they prefer out of the 25. This year we had seven finalists who went in front of the jury. Even if you’re not the finalist or don’t win the prize, you get a lot of exposure.

How long does it take from beginning to end?

We started the applications in January and closed them in late February. From there, we reduced the list to 26, and then in March everyone voted following the showroom viewing. A week later, we knew who the seven finalists were. In late May, we did the quick presentations to the judges, voted, and then announced the winner.

This year, the winner was Marques Almeida. What drew the jury to them over the rest? Why did they stand out?

I think that their work is full of energy and very creative. They have a very interesting and unconventional use of colors and materials; their work with denim, for example, is outstanding. They also have a very good selling track with retailers who carry their collection.

So these contestants need to be designers who can also create things that make sense in the marketplace.

Yes, it’s not only creativity; it’s also being able to have a consumer buy your clothes. There needs to be a commercial response to the creative process. That is, of course, taken into consideration in the process.

What made the 2014 winner, Thomas Tait, take the prize?

He’s extremely creative and draws very well. He had prepared a little book for the jury with a lot of drawings. At the time, he really needed the prize. When you’re the winner, you get 300,000 euros, and on top of that—a one-year coaching by LVMH professionals, which is, I think, the most important thing. They help the designers with decisions that they have to make for their business. You always have a ton of decisions to make when you’re a young designer: How should you price your clothes? Should you do leather goods and shoes, and if so, where should you produce them? Should you produce in Asia or somewhere in Italy? Where should you be stocked?

There’s all the press they get, too. The value of the press, just from winning the prize, is enormous.

Yes, in just one year, Thomas Tait multiplied his sales by two. We helped him find a good factory to produce his clothes and also on legal matters, like owning his trademark in different countries.

One of last year’s special prize honorees, Hood by Air, has become a rather large presence in fashion. Do you think the prize played a role in this?

Yes, but when [Shayne Oliver of Hood by Air] won the prize, he was already a very promising success. The prize helps you a lot, but you need to have the talent and the willingness to grow. Actually, after winning the prize, Hood by Air said they would come to Paris more often, and they did.

One of the main problems for young designers is the cash flow, because they need to pay for the fabrics and the production way before they’re paid, way before department stores receive their collections. They have a moment when the cash flow is negative, so they need the financial help. It’s really useful for them. A lot of the time, their company is a bit financially unstable because of that.

On rare occasions, LVMH has acquired a young brand. Nicholas Kirkwood and J.W. Anderson are two examples of that. Both were promising designers given an opportunity.

We’ve always done that, even with Marc Jacobs at a time. We’ve always been supporting talents.

Is there an in-house team constantly looking for new talent?

No, we have many teams looking for new talents.

How does that work internally?

Well, we have a dedicated team who is, for example, very involved with Nicholas Kirkwood and J.W. Anderson, and who is also coaching Marques Almeida and coached Thomas Tait and Hood by Air. This team is used to seeing smaller businesses and identifying areas where they need the most help and support.

They work within the companies, in order to help either the CEO or the designer when they have questions. In the case of Thomas Tait and Marques Almeida, they don’t have CEOs. It’s the designer who does everything. One of the important elements of the prize is the coaching part.

From your perspective, what responsibility does LVMH have, if any, to support emerging talent and help build the world of fashion outside of the brands it owns?

Well, we’ve always been extremely supportive of young talents and giving a chance to young people. So it’s really in the culture and in the philosophy of the group. It’s our responsibility to help young designers."
"Les Echos' Francis Morel Talks Deals, French Media and More - WWD","Mon, 07 Sep 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3dkLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy1uZXdzL21lZGlhL2xlcy1lY2hvcy1mcmFuY2lzLW1vcmVsLXRhbGtzLWRlYWxzLWZyZW5jaC1tZWRpYS1hbmQtbW9yZS0xMDIxMTA1NC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS — Francis Morel is an out-of-the-box thinker. The 67-year-old, who serves as chief executive officer of Les Echos Group, earlier this year spearheaded an unconventional media deal in France for his parent company, LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton.

LVMH said in May that it had acquired daily newspaper Le Parisien and its national counterpart, Aujourd’hui en France, from the French family-owned Groupe Amaury. The transaction, the terms of which were not disclosed, is expected to close in November.

At first glance, the mainstream tabloid Le Parisien’s culture seems to be worlds apart from the luxury universe of the LVMH brands, which include Dom Pérignon, Ruinart and Veuve Clicquot Champagne; Dior; Louis Vuitton and Berluti. The popular television show “Le Petit Journal,” the French equivalent of “The Daily Show with Jon Stewart,” played on the atypical juxtaposition in a skit showing fountains of pricey Ruinart bubbly replacing a cheap kettle at Le Parisien’s office.

As LVMH expands its empire to include other titles (Le Parisien and Aujourd’hui en France will be under Les Echos Group’s aegis), Morel is the media man of the moment.

LVMH purchased Les Echos in 2007 from the U.K.’s Pearson (which recently disposed of its other media holdings, The Financial Times and The Economist), and Morel was tapped in 2011 to lead it. He came from for Socpresse, owner of Le Figaro, where he was ceo for seven years. Les Echos Group also owns the financial weekly Investir, radio station Radio Classique and arts magazine Connaissance des Arts.

The French media landscape has been busy of late. In addition to LVMH’s deal, in late July billionaire Patrick Drahi teamed up with media entrepreneur Alain Weill to bid for NextRadioTV, a group that owns one of the country’s biggest news channels. Drahi’s media assets already include France’s Libération and L’Express.

The triumvirate involving Pierre Bergé, Xavier Niel and Matthieu Pigasse last year added French newsweekly Le Nouvel Observateur, which was renamed L’Obs, to their burgeoning media portfolio that already included Le Monde, the French Huffington Post and Télérama. Pigasse is the owner of Les Éditions Indépendantes, publisher of Les Inrockuptibles magazine and its Web site, and recently bought Radio Nova.

Meanwhile, French group Vivendi, the owner of Canal Plus, acquired an 80 percent stake in late June in the online video site Dailymotion, the French equivalent of YouTube.

WWD caught up with Morel in his office, a stone’s throw from Palais de la Bourse, in a Haussmannian building that served as Crédit Lyonnais’ former headquarters. Morel wore a tie, as is his tradition, and spoke about the purchase of Le Parisien, a new weekend magazine, and Swedish crime novels.

WWD: Some people think putting Les Echos and Le Parisien in the same group is like mixing oil and water. What are your thoughts?

Francis Morel: There’s no denying that the two brands editorially have nothing in common, but they are stronger together.

WWD: What is Les Echos Group’s bread and butter?

F.M.: Our main business is the financial daily Les Echos, whose paid circulation in France was 125,172 in 2014. We are the only French daily that grew in 2014, growing for the fourth year in a row, in the 2 percent range. In 2014, we logged the best circulation in the last 10 years. It shows that [the increases are] not a coup, but a long-term trend.

WWD: What are the growth drivers?

F.M.: It comes first of all from the quality of the editorial content and secondly from our digital development. Our digital growth has been 30 to 40 percent in the last three years. It more than makes up for the decrease in print [sales]. Today, digital subscribers represent 25 percent of our readership and it’s 80 percent if we add to the mix subscribers who [sign up] to both print and digital.

WWD: You are launching a new weekly magazine, which you consider to be a recruitment vehicle for new readers. How so?

F.M.: Monthly frequency is complicated for a supplement, so we struck our monthly business magazine Enjeux Les Echos and lifestyle weekend insert and replaced them with a freestanding weekly. The first issue comes out on Oct. 2. We are convinced we can attract new readers by offering a print subscription for the weekend only that comes with a digital subscription. We are also attracting a new type of advertiser because we are out of the daily paper [race].

WWD: The New York Times has T magazine; Le Monde, M, and L’Obs, O. Will you name your magazine E?

F.M.: No. [He laughed.] It will be Les Echos Week-end. Its cover has a white background [and] is different from M magazine and Figaro Magazine. We’ll never do a story on the François Hollande-Nicolas Sarkozy game. That isn’t for us. The magazine opens with an eight-page business story. We added to staff, hired a certain number of editorialists. Bénédicte Epinay will continue to oversee the lifestyle content. Fashion will play a large part. Fashion coverage will be different, simpler, less sophisticated than the one in Série Limitée, our high-end magazine. Série Limitée, which is the French answer to [The Financial Times’] How To Spend It, continues to exist. We have ideas to make it even more luxury-oriented. That’s set for early 2016.

WWD: What should fashion coverage consist of in a financial publication?

F.M.: For the weekly magazine, it’s all about stories, and for the daily it consists of covering the business of fashion. It’s a fascinating industry, with giants that dominate the market.

WWD: How do you see the recent acquisition of the FT Group by Japanese media corporation Nikkei Inc. from Pearson PLC for $1.32 billion? The amount is quite impressive.

F.M.: It is. It proves that newspaper brands are equities that are extremely valuable, even more so in the digital world. The Financial Times has remarkably achieved its digitalization. In the digital landscape where there’s an explosion of brands, credible brands are even more powerful. It’s what makes the FT worth $1.32 billion.

WWD: On the French market, on the other hand, newsweekly Le Nouvel Obs was sold last year for only 13.4 million euros [or $14.9 million at current exchange].

F.M.: That transaction doesn’t reflect the market. It wasn’t sold at market price. Bravo to those [Pierre Bergé, Xavier Niel and Matthieu Pigasse] who acquired it under such conditions. But that price is nonsense. What I see is the consolidation happening in the media sphere, in the U.S., in France. Isolated media cannot survive. You need two things — a strong brand and to be part of a group. So we need to continue to build our brands and support them with groups.

WWD: There is a wave of acquisitions on the French media landscape. Will Les Echos make more acquisitions?

F.M.: Le Monde group’s or Le Figaro’s [sales] are around 400 millions euros [$445 million at current exchange]. We will be around 400 [million euros], [so] we play in the same league. What the future will hold, we’ll see. What is fascinating is the speed of transformation happening in the digital sphere.

WWD: What is specific to the French media market?

F.M.: I am not sure there are specificities. What we see everywhere is: One, the digitalization of our brands, and two, the diversification. There are always activities to develop to complement the main business of media. We launched Les Echos Solutions in June with services ranging from crowdfunding to market studies and incubators for start-up companies. We are developing a publishing arm for companies with a separate staff. Services will represent one-third of the group sales in 2016. Down the road, they could be up to 45 percent of Les Echos’ business. We define ourselves as “the first media outlet for information and services,” which makes us stand out. On the services front, I think we are at the forefront.

WWD: What’s your paywall strategy?

F.M.: We were the first to erect a paywall in France. It was a very good decision that has allowed us to have digital subscribers. Now, readers have access to five free stories, plus three additional free ones when they sign up. We are constantly looking at evolving [the model].

WWD: In which direction?

F.M.: To have readers hit it sooner. I think as long as it works, we can aim at a smaller number of free stories.

WWD: What’s your digital strategy for Le Parisien?

F.M.: I don’t know. I am not there yet. Readership is extremely different, and Les Echos’ recipes for success probably don’t work for Le Parisien.

WWD: How do you work with your parent company LVMH?

F.M.: I present them with our projects, strategic plan and budget. It is a simple and direct relationship that is effective. In fact, each time we have been willing to make new developments, LVHM has supported us. The Parisien deal proves it.

WWD: It’s unusual for an industrial group to own a media outlet.

F.M.: If the shareholder plays its part, which is to allow its development, it doesn’t matter if the shareholder is a media or an industrial group, as long as the media keeps its editorial line. Les Echos group was severely hit by the 2008 crisis. LVMH kept supporting it through the shaky times through to our latest developments.

WWD: What’s your daily routine when it comes to newspapers?

F.M.: I read Les Echos, Le Figaro, Le Monde and Le Parisien. Now, I would put Le Parisien in second, or I’ll get slapped on my wrist. [He laughed.] I read Vanity Fair, both the American and French versions. I have been a reader of the American Vanity Fair for years. It’s a remarkable magazine. The feature on Caitlyn Jenner [in the July issue] was remarkable because of the human aspect.

WWD: Is language a limitation for French media?

F.M.: Circulation of the FT in the U.K. is about the same as Les Echos in France. But the FT circulation in its domestic market is very small compared to its global circulation. Our market is more limited. The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal and the Financial Times are the three global newspapers.

WWD: Let’s end our interview with an “Oprah’s Book Club” question: What were your summer reads?

F.M.: I like crime novels. I bought “Daisy Sisters” by Henning Mankell, a Swedish crime writer. The novel is set in the Forties. I had read his book “Italian Shoes,” which I strongly recommend [about] a man who lives on an island in Sweden. A young woman arrives and tells him she is his daughter and her mother is dying. That’s the pitch. Also, I keep buying “Réparer les vivants” by French author Maylis de Kerangal [to be released in February by Farrar, Straus and Giroux in English as “The Heart,” translated by Sam Taylor]. It’s about a young surfer who dies, and everyone is debating what to do with the organs; I keep buying it as gifts.

Flanked by Versace and Omega boutiques, the new Prada-owned, Roberto Baciocchi-designed, Pasticceria Marchesi outpost opened its doors just in time for fashion week, in the heart of the city’s glossiest shopping street: 9 Via Monte Napoleone.

Inside, upper-echelon Milanese perused the 38 vitrines displaying all manner of elevated tearoom fare, while, outside, tourists crammed together to ogle elaborate and pricey pink Sacher tortes.

Though food and fashion have not been the coziest of bedfellows (if you wanted the second, conventional wisdom said, you had to forgo the first), Prada is, in fact, not alone in uniting the two. Indeed, food — or at least pastry — has become the latest weapon in the luxury wars.

Footsteps away from Marchesi is the LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton-owned Cova Caffè (No.8), another legendary city haunt. The coffeehouse Sant’Ambroeus is around the corner on Corso Matteotti; rumors already have begun about luxury brands eyeing it as a potential acquisition. And Andrea Guerra, Luxottica’s former chief executive, is reportedly taking on the role of executive president of the Italian food emporium Eataly this year."

Five days after Givenchy’s triumphant 9/11 show on a pier in downtown New York, there we were again, this time in a tunnel under World Trade Center Plaza, for yet another collection from a brand owned by the French conglomerate LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton. Whoa! Déjà vu. We’re almost back where we began.

What’s that all about?

Officially, the debut DKNY show of Maxwell Osborne and Dao-Yi Chow, otherwise known as the men behind the hip label Public School, who were named back in April to design the contemporary brand that Donna Karan built.

Symbolically, about a whole lot more, because since after Mr. Osborne and Mr. Chow took the helm, Ms. Karan retired, LVMH “suspended” the Donna Karan main line, and DKNY became the de facto standard-bearer of the company.

To all intents and purposes, what happens at DKNY now defines the image of a house that once defined New York fashion."

What’s equally surprising is where he’s going: Re/code reports that he is joining French luxury giant LVMH.

Rogers will leave California and move to Paris, where he will be chief digital officer at LVMH, the holding company behind iconic luxury brands like Louis Vuitton, Marc Jacobs and Bvlgari.

This confirms earlier reports that he was joining a European company in an unrelated industry.

The fit is far from obvious. The former Beats Music CEO has spent his entire career in the music business, and while some had speculated that the move from CEO to senior exec might have been a difficult one, there’s as yet no suggestion that Rogers will be resuming a CEO role within LVMH.

The get is a bit of revenge for LMVH which has seen a number of execs leave for Apple ahead of the Apple Watch introduction.

It was hardly a stiff, formal ribbon-cutting ceremony when Hublot debuted its new manufacturing plant in Nyon yesterday.

The luxury Swiss watch line celebrated the building’s opening with what appears to have been the most fun inauguration of all time. Guests saw Lapo Elkann launching soccer balls into a wristwatch banner, Bar Refaeli strutting down a Formula 1TM style walkway in a gorgeous crimson pant suit, and Pelé posing next to a giant block of cheese—because it wouldn’t be Swiss without it.

The event conveniently synced up with the 10th anniversary of Hublot’s Big Bang collection—a collection that expanded the brand as much as the actual Big Bang expanded the universe.

Among the roughly 300 attendees were Jean-Claude Biver, Chairman of Hublot and President of the LVMH Group’s Watch Division, and Ricardo Guadalupe, CEO of Hublot, who joined the event’s A-list guests in what appeared to be a cheese toast.

Hublot’s new manufacturing building doubles the surface area of its production centre in Nyon, a press release said—an indication that the company hopes to continue growing. As long as Bar Refaeli and Pelé are hanging around, attracting customers should not be a major problem."
The gold in your cellar - Fortune India,"Sat, 05 Sep 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcnR1bmVpbmRpYS5jb20vaW52ZXN0aW5nL3RoZS1nb2xkLWluLXlvdXItY2VsbGFyLzEwMDM3NNIBU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcnR1bmVpbmRpYS5jb20vYW1wL3N0b3J5L2ludmVzdGluZyUyRnRoZS1nb2xkLWluLXlvdXItY2VsbGFyJTJGMTAwMzc0?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"THE IDEA OF FINE AND RARE WINES as an asset class has been around for more than a decade. Much like equity, it can yield handsome returns. But its appeal has been constrained by a limited market, opaque pricing, and hefty commissions and buyers’ premiums charged by wine merchants and auctioneers.



Things have begun changing now, with a clutch of investors worldwide buying into vintage spirits as a niche but credible asset class, similar to art or classic cars, which can generate 10% to 15% returns. There’s a growing secondary market, and fine wine exchanges have also come up, leading to better liquidity and price transparency.



Wine’s lack of correlation to other major asset classes also means less volatility. In fact, certain wines outperformed gold during the past decade due to limited supply of investment-grade wines and a surge in Asia-led demand. “The quantity of fine wine in the world is finite,” says Agarwal. “Also, fine wine producers turn in small quantities and haven’t increased their production at all for the past 100 years.” So prices can jump rapidly, bringing in huge returns. It’s quite possible that a case of Château Margaux priced at £5,000 (Rs 4.9 lakh) ends up being sold for £150,000.



Thanks to all these factors, the global fine wine market is now worth $4 billion (Rs 25,268 crore) according to the London International Vintners Exchange or Liv-ex, the world’s most influential fine wine exchange.



The exchange, set up in 2000 by former investment bankers James Miles and Justin Gibbs, has built a strong reputation and merchant base. It runs a number of indices and sub-indices, and its leading benchmark is the Liv-ex Fine Wine 100 Index, which tracks the price movement of the hundred highest-quality and most sought-after fine wines in the secondary market.



The market did see a steep fall post the financial crisis, and recovery did not begin until last year. Investors seem to have gotten only more experimental though, buying wine en primeur (while it is still in the barrel), investing in wine funds (which operate like mutual funds), and even channelling money into real estate investment trusts that deal in vineyard land.



But here’s the most disruptive trend: While Britain and the U.S. continue to be the top players on Liv-ex, much of the current growth in the business is driven by the emerging markets. China has been a game changer while India could be “the next big growth story”, given the strong “increase in [the number of] wealthy Indians”, says a report by British fine wine investment firm Cult Wines.



India imports around 500,000 cases of wine annually. Its consumption of wine is estimated to rise to 2.4 million cases by 2017, per studies by international wine exhibition Vinexpo—a growth of 73.5% compared to 2013."

The building is home to one of the largest foundations owned by a private company in Europe – the result of LVMH’s generous patronage policy – and reveals the company’s long history of supporting artists.Frank Gehry visited the site in 2002: “I imagined Marcel Proust, strolling around the Jardin d’Acclimatation in the 19th century. I never dreamed of anything other than a glass building, like the Grand Palais in Paris,” he recalls. He began sketching his first designs, imagining, on a scrap of paper, a cloud of glass. A pure folly, and one that would require perseverance and patience to achieve. The president of LVMH had to overcome a series of administrative, legal and, above all, technical obstacles before the building became reality, and over one hundred talented engineers were brought in to advise the architect, with help from Dassault Systèmes. Thirty patents for technological innovations were filed as part of the design process. The 12,500 sq.m. glass structure consists of 3,600 individual panels, each molded to measure – a revolutionary mechanical treatment in itself – and interspersed with large larch pillars, sourced from the Black Forest, crossed by steel structures and supported by panels of Ductal, a white concrete that’s as soft as skin. Strength, gentleness and light are three words that perfectly sum up this building. The project was launched in 2006, the first stone was laid in 2008 and the foundation opens its doors six years later. “I designed the building several years ago, so when I look at it now, there are some things I would change. But it’s too late now!” says Gehry mischievously. Sporting straight walls, ceilings at right angles, and natural light wells, the foundation’s twelve exhibition rooms, each a different size, provide artists with a “white cube” in which to display their work. The building is designed to be flexible and in constant motion, just like the contemporary art scene."
