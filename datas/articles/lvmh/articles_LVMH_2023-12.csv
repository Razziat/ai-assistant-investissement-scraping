LVMH and Miami Design District Unveil Sustainability Partnership - WWD,"Wed, 06 Dec 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3dkLmNvbS9mYXNoaW9uLW5ld3MvZmFzaGlvbi1zY29vcHMvbHZtaC1taWFtaS1kZXNpZ24tZGlzdHJpY3QtYW5ub3VuY2Utc3VzdGFpbmFiaWxpdHktcGFydG5lcnNoaXAtMTIzNjAyMjYzMC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton and the Miami Design District have unveiled a partnership in sustainability with the goal of achieving 100 percent renewable energy in stores.

The plan was outlined Tuesday evening during a panel discussion inside The Moore building at the Miami Design District, featuring Craig Robins, chief executive officer of Dacra Development, and Anish Melwani, chairman and CEO of LVMH Inc.

The agreement will see participation by LVMH’s 15 stores in the Design District, including Louis Vuitton, Dior, Fendi, Bulgari, Hublot, Tiffany & Co. and Berluti, and Miami Design District Associates, the neighborhood’s developer and operator, in Florida Power & Light Company’s FPL SolarTogether program.

The agreement includes a transition to 100 percent green electricity by 2025, a commitment to keep building water use 20 percent below the baseline calculation (Energy Policy Act of 1992), the creation of a centralized energy monitoring system, a stormwater management plan and a reduction in store lights after opening hours.

New LVMH stores will source most materials in Florida and 100 percent of wood will be FSC-certified by 2025; all paints, glues, and varnishes will be water based, and the stores will also commit to using rainwater in all new buildings for gardens, toilets and maintenance. Existing LVMH buildings will aim to keep power consumption below 28 kWh/ft2 (~300 kWh/m2), and will switch off store lights outside opening hours.

“Luxury is all about making excellent products in the traditional methods,” said Melwani during the panel. “And for us that means making fragrances with real flowers that we grow in fields. It means making Champagne with grapes that can only grow in the Champagne region. And so if we think about how many of our products come from nature that have to be and have been grown in the same place for centuries, those are directly affected by climate change.”

Melwani stressed the importance of having an energy partner to help achieve these sustainable goals, as LVMH doesn’t own most of its buildings, but is a tenant. Having an energy partner to work with the landlord is crucial.

“The master plan for the Miami Design District was based on the idea that a vibrant neighborhood at the crossroads of commerce and culture could prioritize sustainability, the health of our ecosystem and the resilience of our city,” said Robins. “LVMH shares that belief, and their global leadership in sustainability has set a benchmark for all consumer brands in the luxury sector and beyond.

“Our joint commitment aims to make a positive impact on residents of and visitors to our community. Florida Power & Light’s SolarTogether program offers us an easy-to-implement way to make an immediate difference. Additional brands will join the program, demonstrating a collective will to safeguard our environment. We encourage other developers to follow our example.”"
LVMH and UNESCO: a joint effort for biodiversity - UNESCO,"Sat, 16 Dec 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnVuZXNjby5vcmcvZW4vYXJ0aWNsZXMvbHZtaC1hbmQtdW5lc2NvLWpvaW50LWVmZm9ydC1iaW9kaXZlcnNpdHnSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Biodiversity and Indigenous Peoples

UNESCO was the venue for the announcement of a strategic partnership between LVMH and the Brazilian NGO FAS (fight against deforestation). The aim of this collaboration is to contribute to the regeneration of ecosystems, particularly in UNESCO biosphere reserves.

Biodiversity protection is at the heart of all the LVMH Group's activities, with the objective of regenerating 5 million hectares of wild habitats worldwide and limiting the impact of its activities on the environment.

This renewed commitment to biodiversity preservation reflects the importance of international cooperation in this field.

""A first objective guiding our action is to protect and restore biodiversity, but always involving local and indigenous communities. This is the essence of the work we are doing with LVMH in the Amazon, in Brazil, Bolivia, Ecuador and Peru. In particular, we are working with cocoa and coffee producers to promote more sustainable agriculture,"" said Audrey Azoulay, Director-General of UNESCO, in her opening message.

""Amazonium"" is an immersive art installation that highlights the importance of protecting natural areas."

Video Transcript

BRAD SMITH: Well, for the first time in six years Morgan Stanley is downgrading the world's largest luxury group to equal weight. That's down from overweight of the analyst, lowering LVMH'S price target from about $936 to $860 and citing weak demand and industry-wide-- industry-wide deterioration from the downgrade but noted that he still sees shares rallying 12% over the next 12 months. This comes after LVMH saw slow growth in its Q3 earnings report back in October here.

And there's been more of a reckoning, I would say, around some of the luxury names out here. It's not just LVMH and the Morgan Stanley analysts note that came out here looking at some of the downgrade on the luxury goods giant here. It's actually been a little bit more broad-based. And we got a couple other calls. LVMH also saw a downgrade recently within the past few days to neutral by UBS as well here.

But I think the mood here, if you're checking the mood ring on some of the larger luxury houses here, especially within Europe, higher interest rates and inflation, really pressuring some of the consumer wallets there. And that's really leading to some of these calls that we're seeing come through.

SEANA SMITH: Yeah. It is. This is all about demand and demand deteriorating during this quarter, the very crucial holiday quarter here for retailers. And then when you look ahead at least in this Morgan Stanley note, saying that 2020 for the first part of it at least could be a bit rocky, it could be a bit volatile here for a lot of these luxury players. Now when it comes to LVMH, and this is what Morgan Stanley pointed out here in their note.

Story continues

One of the greatest risks to LVMH in this broader macro slowdown that we've been talking about is their dependency on China. The fact that that recovery has been much slower than people had initially anticipated, it has really hurt the likes of LVMH in that story or that headwind, I should say, isn't going anywhere anytime soon. So that is expected to weigh on sales here, looking ahead to 2024. You mentioned the fact that so many on the street have been a little bit more bearish.

And I think you're spot on with that because take a look at the commentary that we're getting from HSBC recently. UBS also downgraded LVMH, talking about the fact that they don't really see that outperformance or this catalyst anytime soon. Because I mean, people don't have 2,000, 3,000, 4,000 extra bucks to spend on handbags, to spend on shoes that maybe they were buying during the pandemic. We certainly have seen a shift maybe in the luxury consumer in the fraction that was pretty resilient up until this point. So the fact that we are seeing a bit of a pullback here is a bit of a cause for concern.

BRAD SMITH: I mean, and that's why LVMH has really put together this very broad portfolio of some of those luxury goods where if you did see perhaps a trade down or a trade off of some of those more expensive items, sure, that'd be a near-term headwind for them. But then where do you tap into some of the other elements of the business, because, look, at the end of the day, if people are going to have some sorrows, they might just drink those sorrows away. And Hennessy, that's a good counterbalance in a kind of weighted portfolio at the end of the day that LVMH might lean into here.

Look, I'm not-- I'm just saying that some of the consumers out there might prefer that. But I mean, it's not my preference at the end of the day."
"LVMH, Chanel Link on Sustainability - WWD","Fri, 15 Dec 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3dkLmNvbS9zdXN0YWluYWJpbGl0eS9idXNpbmVzcy9sdm1oLWNoYW5lbC1saW5rLW9uLXN1c3RhaW5hYmlsaXR5LTEyMzYwNzc1NDcv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS — The luxury world is recognizing that when it comes to sustainability, cooperation is better than competition.

In a groundbreaking tie-up of two of the world’s largest luxury groups, LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton on Thursday revealed it will cooperate with Chanel to harmonize corporate and social responsibility reporting and audit schedules at the supplier level. It will also directly support its suppliers through a partnership program titled Life 360 Business Partners, and will launch LVMH Circularity, which will reuse unsold products from across group houses in new projects, among other initiatives.

The initiatives were revealed as LVMH held a full-circle day of sustainability under its Life 360 banner, bringing together brand presidents and creative directors at the UNESCO headquarters in Paris, hosted by the group’s head of image and environment, Antoine Arnault.

LVMH chief Bernard Arnault also acknowledged LVMH and Chanel working together. “The environmental challenge redefines the usual rules of competition,” the chairman and chief executive officer said. Arnault said that competition should be on design and creativity, and businesses can share information.

“I believe it is our duty to know how to rise above the usual patterns. This is why we have chosen to invite certain competitors today,” he added. “Progress of any kind is crucial. We must join forces.”

During the day, the French luxury group discussed its wins, such as meeting its 10 percent energy reduction target at its stores, and where it is facing challenges such as removing fossil fuel-based plastic from its packaging.

The partnership program with suppliers will include financial support and coinvestment, as well as education and other initiatives to bring the suppliers on board as partners, hopefully making any mandatory changes positive rather than penalizing.

“The name of the game from now on for us is going to be Scope 3,” Arnault told WWD, about extending its sustainability reach further afield. Scope 3 is the supplier level.

“It’s the part of our mission that we control the least by definition; however, we are going to try to help our suppliers and our partners be more active on this topic — to train them, and to invest with them in their transition,” he said. Antoine Arnault acknowledged that companies at this level often face big financial challenges to overhaul their businesses.

“However, we cannot compromise,” he added.

Compliance mechanisms will be stringent but supported with training. “It’s quite tough, but we hope they see it as something helpful and that will help them in their transition,” he added, using the example of vintners trying to transition away from pesticides and herbicides but grappling with lower yields at harvest. “We are going to help them transition also financially and find ways to be more helpful toward our common suppliers,” he said.

Competitors to Cooperate

To that end, LVMH will be cooperating with Chanel at the supplier level.

Antoine Arnault said the two groups have the same vision of luxury and “strongly believe that we will need to work together to move faster.”

Mindful of regulatory and antitrust constraints, the groups will coordinate as much as possible on things like sourcing and vetting of suppliers. While the agreement is in its early days, they have several ideas on the table. Audits are one example Arnault shared. The groups hope to create a collective audit system so that suppliers do not have to repeat their work multiple times.

“We basically just started addressing it, but I know that it is really going to be helpful to have partners we work with.”

Chanel SAS president Bruno Pavlovsky spoke on video about building the alliance between the groups that often source from the same suppliers.

“These are collective challenges as all luxury brands are supplied with leather, cotton, silk and cashmere. Only defined alliances will allow us to help the upstream transform,” he said. Businesses and brands will continue to work within their own creative ecosystems.

“There is also an economic challenge. Right now, cotton from regenerative agriculture which meets all the correct criteria will cost more than bottom-of-the-range cotton, so collectively we need to accept that that is the case. I believe that it is clearly by creating alliances and working together on a defined subject that we will be able to make progress,” he added.

Onstage, Chanel supply chain and ecological transition director Eric Dupont said the privately held luxury house came to the decision to work together with LVMH due to the urgency of the climate crisis. “The stakes are higher than one brand or group,” he said. The alliance will see the groups work together on best practices, particularly on leather, and how to define standards for the suppliers.

At the end of the day, LVMH chief Bernard Arnault took to the stage to reiterate the company’s conviction that climate can be a business decision.

“Action for climate and biodiversity will only be effective if it is seen as a real industrial strategy. The reduction in greenhouse gas emissions cannot be improvised. The protection of biodiversity cannot be improvised. The shift in the agricultural model means that regenerative agriculture cannot be improvised. All these objectives can only be achieved through thoughtful, documented strategies,” he said.

Bernard Arnault also acknowledged LVMH and Chanel working together. “The environmental challenge redefines the usual rules of competition,” he said. Arnault said that competition should be on design and creativity, and businesses can share information.

“I believe it is our duty to know how to rise above the usual patterns. This is why we have chosen to invite certain competitors today,” he added. “Progress of any kind is crucial. We must join forces.”

Much of the day was focused on how luxury players can work together, even from sectors as diverse as spirits to fashion.

The French Fédération de la Haute Couture et de la Mode executive president Pascal Morand said the organization has been working intensively behind the scenes to foster collaboration between the houses.

“The main problem of the fashion industry itself is a volumetric problem,” he said, highlighting that the garment industry turns out about 130 billion pieces a year. Morand has also been working with the European Parliament on crafting some rules that will regulate the fashion industry, including the Eco-design for Sustainable Products Regulation.

Morand said the current proposals are focused on durability and functionality and ignore other factors, including fabric composition, as well as brand value. As a result, there is a paradox in the industry where sometimes luxury products are poorly rated on that scale, or vice versa, he said. “It’s not a case of bad intentions, but it’s a complex system,” of the hard metrics that are proposed.

Changing this system for the long term requires a combination of global governance and legislative solutions, alongside the private sector. At this stage, cooperation is needed to get accurate data and granularity needed to transform the industry.

“This is why we do work with each other…in search of rigor,” he said.

Stella McCartney and Antoine Arnault

If the day was a music festival, the rock star was of course a McCartney, with Stella taking the stage in conversation with Arnault. The designer and animal advocate started her line in 2001.

“I’m the grandma of sustainability here,” she joked of her 20-year-plus advocacy of sustainability. McCartney has never used animal products in her designs, even when she was an outlier in the industry.

Things have changed. “The next generation of people we’re all going to employ, they will want to work in businesses like this,” she said.

“The biggest impact we have in a positive way on the environment is not using animal products. Agriculture is massively damaging to the planet,” she said, adding that working with animals as products can also be damaging to the people that handle the labor. “It can be very harmful to human welfare. I think that should be in the conversation also.”

McCartney discussed her work with LVMH’s Veuve Clicquot to create grape leather and cork soles for shoes, as well as her championing of Mirim, a plastic-free mushroom-based leather, which is poised to scale up.

“Scalability is the only real answer, because everyone in here — we have businesses to run, right? It’s the only way to swap out bad business. Innovation is really exciting,” she said.

McCartney had also been present at COP28 in Dubai. “You can lose a little bit of hope in that room; here I have a little more hope,” she said about bringing the various stakeholders together at the daylong conference. She encouraged the LVMH employees to be innovative to tackle issues from new positions. “You have to cooperate to solve this problem. Every day at work you need to think outside of the box.”

Creative Directors Taking Steps

One example was creating new hangers, said Patou artistic director Guillaume Henry.

He took to the stage with Dior Men’s and Fendi women’s creative director Kim Jones and Dior perfume creation director Francis Kurkdjian to discuss the various efforts at each of their houses.

Henry said when he realized that getting a garment from factory to store took three hangers, the brand reduced it to one with a new design. He also noted that the brand’s core line of white shirts and black blazers, called Essentiels, is still its bestseller.

Jones discussed Dior Men’s collaboration with Parley for the Oceans that has resulted in two collections that are made from recovered ocean plastic as another example. Its denim capsule collection released in September is made with 100 percent regenerative cotton.

He’s taking on other collections and incorporating alternative materials as much as possible. “With 22 collections a year it is a challenge, but we are getting to the point where we can do that,” he said.

Kurkdjian said one of the biggest challenges for the industry is going to be changing consumers’ perceptions that quantity, heft and volume equals luxury. Kurkdjian noted the industry has spent decades telling the customer one thing, and now has to work to change that perception.

“Nowadays the challenge is to help the client discover that light and sustainable is precious, more than just big and gigantic. It’s a mindset,” he said.

Many of the brand executives acknowledged that transportation is one of their biggest carbon challenges, and they are working to find solutions including more shipping by ocean or rail instead of air freight or trucks.

Packaging is another challenge, both at the brand and the group level, with eliminating plastic a major roadblock. The group will also examine its advertising and media practices, including how photo shoots are conducted.

Antoine Arnault

Speaking from the stage, Arnault was direct: “Things are not getting better, and businesses cannot continue to thrive in a world overheating,” he said.

Arnault added the group is willing to acknowledge that while it is making progress on its goals, there is still a long way to go. “But what I can tell you is that everybody inside LVMH is mobilized that we are conscious that we have a huge responsibility as the leader of the sector, and that we’re taking this into our hands,” he said. “Let’s also be at the same time realistic and honest, our goal is still to continue to grow. And we will continue within that constraint in a way to produce in the best possible way.”"
"Natalie Portman Talks, Kevin Germanier Shows New Collection at LVMH - WWD","Fri, 15 Dec 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3dkLmNvbS9mYXNoaW9uLW5ld3MvZmFzaGlvbi1zY29vcHMvbmF0YWxpZS1wb3J0bWFuLWtldmluLWdlcm1hbmllci1sdm1oLTEyMzYwNzk0Mzgv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS — Natalie Portman and Kevin Germanier added a dose of glamour to LVMH’s Life 360 conference, closing out the daylong conference Thursday night.

Germanier showed Prélude, the first collection made from 100 percent upcycled materials from LVMH houses, in an example of what the group hopes to do with its new LVMH Circularity initiative that intends to repurpose unsold goods.

Models walked among the UNESCO delegates’ desks in the General Assembly. Germanier presented a wide swathe of looks, ranging from a bright pink suit to sporty outerwear with gently sloping, rounded shoulders as well as a dress using small loops to create a bouncy fringe. Pencil skirts were crisp yet pleats cleverly circled up at the waist for an added dimension, and that trick was taken even further to create a wrap top on a sunshine yellow dress.

A woven bomber that was created from seven previous pieces had a luxurious texture and subtle sheen.

The 15-item collection stayed away from the mix-and-match, patchwork territory often associated with upcycled works. It looked polished and not pieced together.

“It was to showcase the innovation, but also the heritage,” he said of creating a collection up to the standards of an LVMH brand. “We wanted to make it to the highest level. When people think about upcycling, they think of Frankenstein or boho chic. We wanted to show the future of upcycling and what is possible.”

Instead of repurposing a jacket into another jacket, he broke down each piece completely. As a result the collection was as much about design as it was about textile innovation and reimagining materials, Germanier said.

He worked with seven houses in the LVMH stable to source fabrics — some selected, some given and all a new challenge. Many had visible logos, and he took care to use unique techniques such as disassembling the fabrics to re-weave them into new textiles.

He also used T-shirts to create a new material that resembled fur and ground down offcuts into a powder mixed with resin to create buttons and other hardware. In the production process, he reused patterns to cut down on sample waste.

Prélude hints at a beginning and Germanier hopes that this collection might not be the last under the new moniker.

“When we started this project there was one rule — it was that we would show it if it was beautiful and desirable — and it happened,” said LVMH head of image and environment Antoine Arnault.

Kevin Germanier’s Prélude collection for LVMH presented at UNESCO.

Arnault was joined on stage by Dior ambassador Natalie Portman, clad in a black cape dress from the brand, for a conversation that centered on the effects of animal agriculture.

The dedicated vegan discussed the common causes of animal welfare, environmental and social justice, as slaughterhouse workers are often undocumented migrants and refugees who are damaged by the emotional, environmental and physical effects of the work.

“You have this real intersection of people doing really unsavory and dangerous jobs…you have these vulnerable immigrant populations at the core of this meat processing, and you see how it affects the outlying communities,” she said. “The social issues are very intersectional with the environmental issues.”

Portman said she is “absolutely not a policy expert,” but that governments have a role in regulating, incentivizing environmental standards and creating economic consequences for those that don’t clean up their business practices.

Portman noted that she backs up her beliefs by investing in startups. She is an investor in MycoWorks, which makes a mushroom-based leather alternative, and La Vie foods, the French start-up behind a bacon alternative.

Arnault pointed out that LVMH is working with mushroom leather Mirim, under the Stella McCartney label, and that the technology is improving with every collection.

“I think it’s really motivating to consumers when they don’t have a difference in the quality of the material…at the luxury price,” Portman agreed. “That’s the dream.”

Natalie Portman

Asked what advice she would give to employees at LVMH who are thinking of ways to improve the environment, Portman suggested cutting back on the consumption of animals. “I think we forget about it and we forget about it within companies, and it’s a lot of waste and consumption that we contribute to when eating animal products,” she said. “It’s not often paid attention to in terms of these conversations but it’s a big thing everyone can do themselves three times a day.”

Portman was the second speaker of the day to raise the animal welfare issue, notably following Stella McCartney who also addressed the link between animal products, agriculture, environmental and labor issues from the main stage at UNESCO during the conference for a company that is one of the top leather goods producers in the world."
LVMH Métiers d'Art Acquires Italian Metalworking Specialist - WWD,"Tue, 19 Dec 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vd3dkLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy1uZXdzL21lcmdlcnMtYWNxdWlzaXRpb25zL2x2bWgtbWV0aWVycy1hcnQtYWNxdWlzaXRpb24taXRhbGlhbi1tZXRhbHdvcmtpbmctbWFudWZhY3R1cmVyLTEyMzYwODgyNzEv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"MILAN — LVMH Métiers d’Art, the French luxury group’s specialist crafts division, continues to expand its savoir-faire, and has acquired the entirety of Renato Menegatti, a benchmark specialist in the metal sector since 1980.

Based in Villaverla, in the province of Vicenza, Renato Menegatti will be renamed M.On.De Metal-on-Demand.

“Metalworking is an ancient art that requires unique skills and craftsmanship,” said Jean Baptiste Voisin, chief strategy officer of LVMH and president of LVMH Métiers d’Art. “We are aware of the importance of preserving and enhancing this tradition, and we are excited to be able to do so through this acquisition.”

The acquisition follows that of Grupo Verdeveleno, a Spanish tannery that is a leader in the processing and finishing of exotic leathers, and a partnership inked last month with Hosoo, a storied Japanese silk specialist since 1688.

LVMH Métiers d’Art is led by chief executive officer Matteo De Rosa, who has helped grow the company and expanded its list of international partners.

Matteo De Rosa

“We are grateful for the opportunity to collaborate with a group of highly skilled professionals in achieving new milestones in the metalworking industry,” said De Rosa. “Determined to carry forward the legacy of this excellence with passion and innovation, we are confident that this acquisition will allow us to continue offering our customers extraordinary luxury products and solidify our position as a reference point in the industry.”

M.On.De. is known for applying processes typical of the world of jewelry to the production of small metal parts for accessories, from logos and chains to buckles and zippers, developing the entire process in-house, from 3D design and prototyping, to production, galvanization with gold or palladium, anodization, satin finishing and polishing. Under the LVMH Métiers d’Art umbrella and in the metal sector, M.On.De. joins the Taiwan-based GBJM, founded in 2012, and the Portugal and France-based Jade Group.

Set up in 2015 to help the conglomerate’s houses build and maintain strong sourcing of rare materials, as well as education and training for the industry, LVMH Métiers d’Art acquired a stake in Spanish tannery Riba-Guixà the same year, in Italian tannery Masoni in 2019 and, last year, a majority stake in Heng Long Italy and a minority stake in leather and suede artisanal ready-to-wear manufacturer Robans.

In May, the group acquired a majority stake in Italian tannery Nuti Ivo S.p.A., established in 1955 in Santa Croce sull’Arno, a historic leather-working and tanning area in Italy’s Tuscany region, reinforcing its presence in the leather, exotic skins and metal sectors.

Also, the LVMH Métiers d’Art in September revealed it was partnering with the Ohio State University College of Veterinary Medicine to sanction the next generation of scientists and craft leaders.

The college’s One Welfare and Sustainability Center (or OWSC) is a leader on animal population health, welfare and sustainability, with a focus on conservation-based systems and species management. The OWSC will develop a comprehensive training program for animal health specialists such as professional veterinary students, graduate students and veterinary clinical residents with support from LVMH Métiers d’Art. The division spans a variety of manufacturing facilities and skilled craftspeople working in leather, exotic leathers and high-quality metal hardware globally.

Italian fashion groups and entrepreneurs have also been investing in cultivating strategic suppliers as well as manufacturers to strengthen their supply chain, such as Prada and the Ermenegildo Zegna Group partnering to buy a majority stake in cashmere firm Filati Biagioli Modesto or Brunello Cucinelli and Chanel investing in cashmere company Cariaggi.

Gruppo Florence was established in October 2020 to develop a platform to supply high-quality Made in Italy products to major luxury fashion brands, while safeguarding the technical and cultural know-how of small and medium-sized family-owned Italian companies. Matteo Marzotto has invested in Minerva Hub, established last year to protect a number of Italian manufacturers in the country’s supply chain that help create garments and accessories."

LVMH and the Miami Design District Tie the Knot With a New Climate Initiative - Cultured Magazine,"Fri, 08 Dec 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmN1bHR1cmVkbWFnLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlLzIwMjMvMTIvMDgvbHZtaC1taWFtaS1kZXNpZ24tZGlzdHJpY3QtY2xpbWF0ZS1hZ3JlZW1lbnTSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Craig Robins and Anish Melwani signing the climate agreement between LVMH and the Miami Design District.

Earth Month is not until April, but the winter season has long given rise to its fair share of climate discourse. As extreme temperatures become the norm, putting civil infrastructure to the test in the face of unanticipated weather events around the world, the annual United Nations Climate Change Conferences—better known as COP—marks the urgency of the moment. (With a few exceptions, the yearly convention has been held in November or December since 1995.)

This year’s COP landed in Dubai, where environmental, economic, and governmental leaders will meet until Dec. 12. On the occasion of the annual conference, luxury juggernaut LVMH renewed its commitment to the climate—officialized three years ago with the launch of its LIFE 360 environmental program—with a trio of initiatives.

Pam Rauch and Anish Melwani

A new agreement to fight deforestation was inked with the Foundation For Amazon Sustainability. Designer and lifelong animal rights activist Stella McCartney, who left Kering for LVMH in 2019, will receive continued support from the latter for her “Sustainable Market” project, which bolsters the creation of eco-responsible materials. Lastly, the luxury group has promised to continue its collaboration with shopping centers and real estate companies to reduce its stores’ carbon footprints.

Craig Robins

Seven thousand miles away, in Miami’s bustling Design District where 15 of its maisons are tenants, LVMH concretized steps toward that promise this Tuesday. Amid the whirlwind of Miami Art Week, CEO Anish Melwani signed an agreement with MDD mastermind Craig Robins to take collective action against the climate crisis. Highlights of the partnership include a transition to 100 percent sustainably sourced electricity by 2025, the establishment of a comprehensive stormwater management plan, and the sourcing of a majority of materials for any new MDD LVMH stores from local industries.

Pam Rauch, Craig Robins, Anish Melwani, and Jane Wooldridge

In a wide-ranging conversation at the MDD’s Moore building with Florida Power & Light Company Vice President of External Affairs and Economic Development Pam Rauch, and Miami Herald veteran journalist Jane Wooldridge, Robins and Melwani discussed the climate responsibility at the core of both of the MDD and LVMH’s futures, the vertical integration and unexpected benefits of sustainability measures, and the influence their agreement has already had on other groups. (Kering has also pledged that its MDD stores will abide by the partnership’s guiding principles.) An evergreen note to end the year on."

“This is more pressure than COP. And you know why? Because this is truly where changes happen. COP is amazing, but you could lose a little bit of hope. Here I have a little more hope,” said Stella McCartney, as she took to the stage alongside Antoine Arnault during a gathering of LVMH leaders and partners on Thursday.

The group brought together 500 people —including McCartney, in whose namesake brand LVMH has a stake — at the Paris headquarters of United Nations agency Unesco to announce the first results of its Life 360 sustainability plan, launched in May 2021. “We have taken our sustainability policy to another level in less than three years,” said Arnault, who is LVMH’s head of image and environment. “This strategy sets out quantified targets for 2023, 2026 and 2030 in order to address our key challenges in the areas of creative circularity, biodiversity, traceability and climate…2023 is the first milestone in this programme, and an opportunity for an initial review.”

The company claimed achievements in each of those four areas, including having met its 2023 target to offer new circular services by establishing a “repair-and-care task force” in several of the group’s maisons; reducing its Scopes 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions; helping to regenerate 1.37 million hectares to support its biodiversity targets; and for traceability, knowing the countries of origin for key raw materials diamonds, wool and leather in upwards of 95 per cent of products. Details are relatively scarce, though, making it difficult to evaluate the true benefits and impact of these initiatives.

Arnault noted new alliances with external partners, addressing issues like regenerative agriculture and the “successful” launch of Nona Source, a platform that repurposes high end fabrics. “Hundreds of thousands of products are now being repaired, upcycled, and refurbished,” he added.

On LVMH’s carbon footprint, he said emissions are dropping “even as our sales figures rise”, but this is referring to emissions intensity — how efficiently individual products are made, essentially — rather than absolute, or total, emissions, which in terms of climate impacts is the number that matters most. (LVMH clarified that Scopes 1 and 2 emissions are reducing in absolute terms, but these represent a fraction of a company’s total footprint. The rest is Scope 3, which refers to emissions from the supply chain not directly owned by the company.)"
Former LVMH VP Sues Luxury Group Again for Sexual Harassment - The Fashion Law,"Wed, 13 Dec 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWZhc2hpb25sYXcuY29tL2Zvcm1lci1sdm1oLWxlZ2FsLXZwLXN1ZXMtbHV4dXJ5LWdvb2RzLWdyb3VwLWFnYWluLWZvci1zZXh1YWwtaGFyYXNzbWVudC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"A long-running legal clash between LVMH Moet Hennessey Louis Vuitton (“LVMH”) and its former Vice President of Legal Affairs has made its way to federal court. After filing a lawsuit against LVMH in a New York state court in April 2019, Andowah Newton has lodged a new complaint against the luxury goods giant with the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, alleging that she “suffered sexual harassment and an incident of assault” while on the job and when she complained about the incident was subjected to a “retaliatory hostile work environment” that escalated during tenure and ultimately resulted in her being “publicly and humiliatingly fired.”

Setting the stage in the 79-page complaint that she filed on December 11, Newton asserts that she “suffered sexual harassment and … assault at the hands of [LVMH’s] Director of Property and Facility Operations, Lloyd Doran.” When “repeated informal reports and requests for help to [LVMH’s] in-house employment counsel fell on deaf ears,” Newton said that she sent an email to Doran asking him to stop harassing her “pursuant to the instructions” of LVMH’s employment counsel. The result, according to Newton, was that Doran reported her to LVMH by “immediately forwarding the email to his supervisor,” which prompted “immediate retaliation” by LVMH.

Mirroring some of the claims in her earlier suit, Newton alleges that LVMH “did everything it could to intimidate [her] into not pursuing her claims and convince [her] that the harassment was just a byproduct of being an ‘attractive woman’ who works at a company with a French culture, and thus should simply be tolerated.” Newton further asserts that she filed a formal complaint with LVMH’s Human Resources and requested that they hire an external third party to conduct an investigation. LVMH “eventually and reluctantly agreed, but the truncated investigation was merely an extension of [its] campaign to intimidate Newton into silence amidst allegations that might tarnish its public image,” the plaintiff alleges, noting that she “had no other choice but to engage in the protected activity of filing a lawsuit” in New York state court in April 2019.

In that case, which ultimately ended up in arbitration (after LVMH won a motion to compel), Newton alleged that LVMH had engaged in sexual harassment, assault, and retaliation in violation of the New York State and City Human Rights Laws.

In response to her lawsuit, Newton claims that LVMH “ramped up the retaliatory hostile work environment against her [when its] CEO made the unprecedented and outrageous step of sending an email to all employees essentially calling Newton a liar and directing them to ‘continue business as usual…” Newton alleges that her “‘fall from grace’ lasted throughout the rest of her employment at [LVMH, where] she was increasingly outcast and othered from her team.”

Specifically, Newton maintains that “her coworkers and [former LVMH] General Counsel [Louise] Firestone continued to retaliate against her and harass her, creating an intolerable, ongoing retaliatory hostile work environment,” including by “denying her reasonable accommodation request to work remotely … to accommodate her PTSD,” giving her a negative performance review (despite previously receiving “nothing but outstanding, stellar reviews”), lowering her annual compensation increase,excluding her from work-related events, and “intentionally mislead[ing] the press to smear [her name and reputation],” among other things.

She further contends that LVMH subjected her to “a worsened ongoing retaliatory hostile work environment” after she was subpoenaed by Congress in November 2021 to testify in support of the Ending Forced Arbitration of Sexual Assault and Sexual Harassment Act of 2021, a since-enacted federal law that bans forced arbitration for survivors of sexual assault and harassment.

Taken together, Newton – who was ultimately “publicly and humiliatingly fired” in December 2022, effective as of January 1, 2023 – asserts that “it was clear that [LVMH], aware that it would be unlawful to fire her, instead hoped to pressure her into quitting.”

As a result of “the sexual harassment and retaliation she suffered at [LVMH],” Newton alleges that she “has experienced severe distress and anxiety” and “continues to suffer from PTSD and recently has had panic attacks and suffered sleep issues due to their continued retaliation.” Moreover, she claims that in 2021 and 2022, she “began suffering from two additional physical medical conditions/injuries, likely caused or exacerbated by [LVMH’s] retaliation and hostile work environment, conditions and injuries for which she continues to be treated to this day.”

With the foregoing in mind, Newton sets out claims of retaliation in violation of Title VII against LVMH and retaliation in violation of the New York State Human Rights Law and the New York City Human Rights Law against LVMH General Counsel Rodney Pratt, and is seeking monetary damages, including (but not limited to) all lost wages and benefits resulting from the defendants’ “unlawful discrimination and conduct” and compensatory damages for “mental and emotional injury, distress, pain, suffering, and injury to [her] reputation in an amount to be proven.”

In the wake of the Ending Forced Arbitration of Sexual Assault and Sexual Harassment Act (“EFASASHA”) coming into force, Newton’s case very well may have a different outcome than the one she waged in New York state court. Enacted in March 2022, the EFASASHA amends the Federal Arbitration Act to enable victims of sexual assault or harassment to pursue claims in court even if they are bound by an arbitration agreement that states otherwise, thereby, forcing employers to remove sexual harassment and sexual assault disputes from the list of claims that employees must arbitrate by way of mandatory arbitration.

A representative for LVMH North America told TFL, “Ms. Newton is once again pursuing entirely baseless claims following those she initially made in 2018, which were found to be without merit after being investigated at the time internally, as well as independently by a retired Judge. As to her newest claim, her departure was part of a restructuring of the North America legal department, which affected a number of employees, late last year by our recently appointed North America Chief Legal Officer. Given this, we will continue to vigorously defend our position against these meritless and frivolous claims.”

The case is Newton v. LVMH Moet Hennessey Louis Vuitton, et al., 1:23-cv-10753 (SDNY)."
LVMH-Backed Investor Eyes £1B Stake In Bicester Village Owner - Bisnow,"Thu, 07 Dec 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJpc25vdy5jb20vbG9uZG9uL25ld3MvcmV0YWlsL2x2bWgtYW5kLWFybmF1bHQtYmFja2VkLWludmVzdG9yLWV5ZS1zdGFrZS1pbi1iaWNlc3Rlci12aWxsYWdlLW93bmVyLTEyMTk2M9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Prada's Bicester outlet

A private equity firm backed by LVMH and the family office of its founder is in conversations about buying a stake in the company that owns Bicester Village.

L Catterton has held talks with Hammerson, which is selling a 40% stake in Value Retail for £1B to £1.2B, React News reported.

There is no certainty of a deal being done, and talks have been on and off, with L Catterton offering less than the £1.2B Hammerson is looking for, according to React.

Any deal would see an investor backed by one of the world’s biggest luxury retail owners take a stake in a business that has built its fortune on discounted high-end fashion sales, with a strong focus on tourist shoppers. The family office of LVMH founder Bernard Arnault is also a backer of L Catterton.

Bicester Village in Oxfordshire is focused on upscale and luxury retail and is often cited as achieving the highest sales per SF of any retail scheme internationally. Retailers have tended not to open other designer outlet stores in the south of England.

The 245K SF outlet centre 65 miles north-west of London is estimated to be visited by up to 80% of the roughly 350,000 Chinese visitors to the UK every year. The platform at Marylebone station, from which trains to the nearest town depart, has signs and announcements in Mandarin, and Bicester Village employs about 150 Mandarin speakers.

It receives 7 million visits annually, attracting shoppers from Middle Eastern royals to the average bargain hunter.

Value Retail also has locations in Shanghai and Suzhou in China that are branded under the Bicester Village name. It also has centres in cities like Barcelona, Frankfurt, Madrid and Milan.

Belmont Park Village in New York is scheduled to open next summer.

Hammerson upped its stake in Value Retail in February 2018 with a £76M investment as it focused on growing its premium outlet business, but earlier this year, CEO Rita-Rose Gagné said that investment was no longer envisaged as a long-term hold.

Value Retail’s other shareholders include founder Scott Malkin, U.S. retail giant Simon Property Group and Dutch pension fund APG, none of whom are bidding for Hammerson’s stake, React reported."

Edouard Aubin downgraded the luxury-goods giant to equal-weight on Friday on concern over weakening demand in the sector, having had an overweight recommendation since January 2018. At the same time, he tempered his price target to €790 from €860. The shares fell as much as 1.9 percent in Paris before paring some losses.

While Aubin’s new target still sees LVMH’s shares rallying 12 percent over the next 12 months, it is far below the consensus target of €842, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. LVMH has 27 buy ratings, nine holds and no sell ratings.

“We expect the shares to move sideways in the coming months given likely further industry-wide deterioration in overall demand in the fourth quarter, as well as a likely difficult start to 2024 for LVMH,” Aubin wrote in a note. He added that he sees an increased risk for both the company and the wider industry from their greater dependence on spending by Chinese nationals.

The mood is souring on Europe’s luxury goods makers as higher interest rates and inflation have put pressure on consumer wallets. LVMH, the world’s biggest luxury group, reported softer sales growth in the third-quarter, a similar story seen at peers including Gucci-owner Kering SA and upmarket watch maker Richemont.

The cloudier outlook is giving analysts pause. Earlier in the week, HSBC Holdings Plc cut price targets across the sector, saying that European luxury stocks aren’t recession-proof, while UBS recently downgraded LVMH to neutral on the prospect that its outperformance will ease.

This caution has been reflected in the shares, with LVMH down 23 percent from April’s record, and up only 2.5 percent on the year.

Why Some Luxury Groups Are Doing Better Than Others

LVMH and Kering felt the pinch in 2023—but a new type of luxury is gaining a share of consumers' wallets - Fortune,"Mon, 25 Dec 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vZm9ydHVuZS5jb20vZXVyb3BlLzIwMjMvMTIvMjUvbHV4dXJ5LW1hcmtldC1zbG93ZG93bi1sdm1oLWJ1cmJlcnJ5LWd1Y2NpLWxvb2thaGVhZC0yMDI0L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Luxury goods once seemed immune to economic woes, but the luster may be fading. During the pandemic, the luxury market thrived as the affluent—unfazed by price hikes—indulged in Birkin bags and rare watches. Yet signs now point to a slowdown in the “Roaring Twenties” luxury boom.

Take China, for instance, where the post-COVID sales surge early in 2023 didn’t last. The nation’s slower economic rebound and global uncertainties have contributed to a pullback in luxury spending. According to Claudia D’Arpizio of Bain & Co., a leading expert in the field, despite initial resilience, luxury markets face challenges due to geopolitical shifts and subdued consumer confidence.

This turbulence has impacted major players like LVMH, the conglomerate behind Dior and Louis Vuitton. Its Q3 revenue growth slowed compared to the previous year, setting a tone echoed by rivals such as Gucci-owner Kering and Burberry. Richemont’s half-year sales, although up 6%, fell short of expectations, and secondary market prices for Rolex and Patek Philippe have taken a hit.

While some outliers, like Hermès, defy the downturn with strong Q3 sales, the overall luxury sector is navigating uncertainties.

However, niche segments, such as luxury cruises, are thriving with a 116% YoY growth in constant currency terms.

The complexity of the luxury market’s current landscape leaves us questioning the true trajectory amid conflicting reports of gains and spending ease. So what is really unfolding in the world of opulence?

COVID-fueled boom leading to readjustment

The pandemic marked luxury’s heyday. Accumulated savings from stimulus checks and furlough schemes bolstered shoppers’ spending power but left them with fewer avenues to indulge amid travel bans and lockdowns. That’s when many turned to luxury goods as they bought more Champagne and designer bags than they did before.

“You had huge excess savings or purchasing power that was released by the fact that people were staying at home, especially white-collar workers,” said Javier Gonzalez Lastra, luxury-focused portfolio manager at Tema ETFs.

The extent of growth across the luxury category during the pandemic is reflected in Deloitte data, which shows that the top 100 luxury companies became bigger and more profitable than ever in FY 2022.

But then, as interest rates and inflation went up, Lastra says, consumers began to pull purse strings tight and be more watchful of where they spent money.

Monstrous pandemic-era spending did wonders for the profit margins of luxury companies, but it was never meant to be the new normal. If anything, that was the anomaly, and the easing growth we’re seeing today reflects a gradual readjustment in what used to be the standard before COVID-19.

“Fundamentally, it’s not sustainable, nor should it be,” according to Flavio Cereda, investment manager at Zurich-based asset management firm GAM, referring to the high growth rates seen in the luxury segment. “I think what you see this year is this deceleration, which is a process toward normalization. It looks worse than it is because it comes from a very high level.”

Luxury company executives have also pointed out that the seeming downturn is merely a shift back to how things used to be rather than a total doomsday scenario for luxury goods on the whole. Richemont chairman Johann Rupert noted in the company’s half-year earnings release last month that a “broad-based normalization of market growth expectations across the industry” was underway.

Data supports that too. Across all luxury categories globally, luxury industry consumption for 2023 is estimated to be about €1.5 trillion ($1.62 trillion), according to Bain & Co.’s November industry report Long Live Luxury.

That’s roughly 70% higher than 2019 levels in constant currency terms despite an estimated price increase of 29% across the industry for that period to keep up with rising production costs, retail data firm EDITED found.

The performance of different luxury brands can also depend on the type of consumers they target, said Natalia Lechmanova, Mastercard’s chief economist for Europe.

The entry-level “aspirational” consumer might have been more impacted by macroeconomic factors and their effects on his or her wallet, compared to the über-wealthy.

“We need to appreciate that luxury consumers exist on a spectrum from prosperous upper-middle classes to billionaires. The former has become more price sensitive: Investment banks’ bonuses have moderated, the tech sector has shed jobs, the crypto bubble burst, and many well-to-do professionals have had to increasingly prioritize higher interest payments on their mortgages rather than expensive holidays or handbags,” Lechmanova said in an email to Fortune.

A new type of luxury gaining ground

The drop in spending across some segments of luxury reflects the ebb and flow of shoppers’ preferences and appetite for discretionary goods given the current economic environment.

But as Tema ETFs’ Lastra sees it, consumers are merely splurging on a different type of luxury than they did in recent years.

“What we’ve seen in terms of slowdown is mostly driven by the fact that people are now spending on other things,” Lastra said. “So it’s a matter of share of wallet at the moment, more than job losses or necessarily the pinch of interest rates which is having an impact.”

More specifically, the spending is being directed to luxury experiences, Bain & Co. found.

D’Arpizio, who coauthored the November luxury market report, noted that the bounce-back from COVID-19 and the resurgence of travel has seen more people indulge in experiential luxury during 2023—a trend that is expected to continue into next year.

“What we’ve observed in 2023 is a rebalancing of customer appetite toward experiences and experience-based goods over products, with unparalleled sense of urgency for social life and travels across geographies,” D’Arpizio said. “Spending on experiences is recovering historical highs, with consumers reapproaching luxury beyond products.”

This could mean a boost in categories like travel, hospitality, and cruises as tourist flow increases.

As a result of more tourism, luxury goods purchases could also benefit, albeit by less stratospheric degrees, Bain & Co. expects.

Some of these trends are beginning to reflect in company earnings: Europe’s largest hotel group, Accor, raised its annual profit target twice this year as it witnessed booming demand. British group Rocco Forte Hotels, which has properties across Europe, has also seen revenues rise.

“Experiences more than doubled their value since 2010,” D’Arpizio said. “This ‘new normal’ means luxury markets are blurring their boundaries, and brands have the opportunity to extend their reach beyond their core.”

2024 and ahead

With signs pointing in different directions, it’s clear the year ahead for luxury will mark a reshuffle that began in 2023.

HSBC warned in a late November note that as luxury is linked to consumer sentiment, tourism, and equity markets, what happens to it can have broader ripple effects.

The bank foresees a more modest pace of growth which, it says, “is nothing to be ashamed of, but slowing momentum is rarely supportive for stocks in this sector.”

With economies in key regions such as the U.S., Europe, and China still finding their footing, 2024 could continue to be “challenging” for luxury, Deutsche Bank wrote last week.

But on the bright side, the luxury industry is more resilient when compared to some other consumer sectors of the economy.

“One of the reasons you want to be invested in this sector is because there is the rising of the upper-middle class globally, and that’s a fantastic tailwind for all these [luxury] companies,” Lastra said."

Nonetheless, the luxury goods powerhouse will hold an “important minority shareholder” status in the business. The news came on Friday, December 8, pushing MC shares up by 3.3%.

A new joint venture, called Global Travel Retail Holdings, will be formed to manage the business.

LVMH boasts several luxury brands, including Louis Vuitton, Tiffany & Co., Dior, Givenchy, Séphora, and Moët & Chandon, among others.

LVMH Sells Majority Stake in Cruise Retail

LVMH’s cruise retail company is called Cruise Line Holdings Co. This parent company owns Starboard Cruise Services and Onboard Media businesses, offering handbags, jewellery, and beauty products on cruise ships. Notably, after the deal, LVMH’s products will also be offered on vacation retail locations on land. LVMH seldom mentions the Cruise Line Holdings’ business performance in its quarterly results. The pandemic-driven lockdowns have massively impacted the cruise line sector, and hence LVMH’s decision to offload its stake is no surprise.

The new investors hail from different areas of vacation retail space and are expected to bring about the much-required innovation and growth prospects for the new unit. LVMH said that Jim Gissy and associates will act as “strategic partners.” Gissy will be the chairman of the new company’s board, while Starboard’s current President & CEO, Lisa Bauer, will continue to lead the business.

What is the Future Price of LVMH Stock?

On Friday, Deutsche Bank analyst Francesca Di Pasquantonio cut the price target on MC stock to €790 (6.9% upside) from €805 while keeping a Hold rating.

Chinese Spending Buoys LVMH - Jing Daily,"Tue, 12 Dec 2023 01:39:17 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiN2h0dHBzOi8vamluZ2RhaWx5LmNvbS9wb3N0cy9jaGluZXNlLXNwZW5kaW5nLWJ1b3lzLWx2bWjSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LVMH Moët Hennessy • Louis Vuitton S.A ., the mighty global juggernaut, has had a bit of a rough year in the traditionally reliable markets of North America, Japan and Europe. Despite cutbacks in spending in these established markets, however, there have been bright areas for LVMH, namely in emerging markets like China and the other BRIC nations and pockets of Southeast Asia. In regions where LVMH has only operated for a few years, or a few decades at the most, newly rich consumers are opening their wallets and flaunting their wealth in a way never seen before -- and all of this translates to high hopes for luxury's standard bearer.

Earlier this year, China surpassed the United States as the world's second-largest luxury market, and the country has Japan, #1, firmly in its sights. Many analysts believe that China, given current growth figures, should overtake Japan as the world's top luxury market within five years. So what does this all mean for luxury brands? Today, the Wall Street Journal's Matthew Curtin looks into LVMH's ""China Syndrome,"" and make the case that where LVMH goes, so goes the luxury industry:

Chinese customers, both at home and on holiday in the shopping malls around the world, have become the biggest buyers of Louis Vuitton clothes and handbags and Hennessy cognac ahead of the Japanese and overtaking Americans.















The French group's exposure to China helps explains why it is pulling out of the industry slump faster than expected. The number of Vuitton stores in China will increase by half to 30 by year-end while Sephora, LVMH's perfume retailer, will have 70 compared with 234 in home market France. Across the group, same store third-quarter sales fell 3% as robust Asian demand almost entirely offset falling sales of brandy, champagne, jewelry and watches -- still shrinking as a result of continued destocking.







Where LVMH goes, the rest of the luxury-goods industry looks set to follow."
LVMH's head of beauty R&D aims to reverse the 12 signs of aging - Glossy,"Thu, 28 Dec 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmdsb3NzeS5jby9iZWF1dHkvbHZtaHMtaGVhZC1vZi1iZWF1dHktcmQtYWltcy10by1yZXZlcnNlLXRoZS0xMi1zaWducy1vZi1hZ2luZy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"This story was originally part of the 2023 Glossy 50 feature. Click here to see all of this year’s honorees.

Bruno Bavouzet, evp of research and development at LVMH, says his two passions are innovation and people.

These two passions came together when Dior Beauty announced the creation of an International Reverse Aging Scientific Advisory Board in March. It’s comprised of 600 researchers and 18 experts, and led by Bavouzet from the LVMH side. The idea is to better understand the 12 signs of aging, including genomic instability, epigenetic changes, stem cell fatigue and chronic inflammation. Weaving that knowledge into skin-care product innovations to reverse these signs is the next step, said Bavouzet.

Bavouzet has been at LVMH for 10 years, having previously worked at L’Oréal Group. He oversees all beauty R&D for LVMH brands including Givenchy, Fresh and Benefit Cosmetics. A scientist by training, Bavouzet has a Ph.D. in physical chemistry.

“Sometimes you can create new bridges between one domain and another,” he said, describing how breakthroughs in science regularly occur. “This is often the way to inspire innovation: through [exposure to] a new approach or a different way of thinking,”.

As a result of Board discussions, Dior is already set to debut new product technology as early as 2025. In the meantime, the Board will collate the hallmarks of aging and its own research approach into a paper that can then be submitted to an academic journal.

Bavouzet said it is important that he be both ambitious in his goals and humble in his approach. In addition, he hopes that Dior’s advisory board will inspire younger people to consider a career in scientific research."
"Antoine Arnault on LVMH's COP28 Engagement, Signs Mall Energy Deal - WWD","Tue, 05 Dec 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3dkLmNvbS9zdXN0YWluYWJpbGl0eS9idXNpbmVzcy9sdm1oLWVuZXJneS11YWUtbWFsbC1kZXZlbG9wZXJzLTEyMzU5ODQ4ODgv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS — With the world watching COP28, LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton signed two new agreements at the annual climate conference convened by the United Nations, including a partnership with Middle Eastern mall developers that will set clear impact reduction targets, and an agreement to support biodiversity projects in Brazil.

Since 2020, the luxury group has sought to become a bigger voice at the annual convention, and making COP an engagement on its agenda. LVMH head of image and environment Antoine Arnault joined diplomats and leaders on the ground in Dubai, inking the milestone initiatives for the luxury group.

The first agreement builds on its existing approach of partnering with shopping centers on environmental targets, this time enlisting four of the top real estate developers in the United Arab Emirates including Chalhoub Group, Emaar Malls, Majid Al Futtaim and Aldar Properties.

The agreement was signed with the regional retail players stepping up their commitments to new sustainability targets in water use, energy efficiency, waste management, air conditioning and use of clean energy, and eco-design and construction practices.

While this marks the first partnership of its kind in the region, it isn’t the first for LVMH, which pioneered this type of tenant and landlord agreement last year through an energy reduction pact with China’s Hang Lung Properties. That agreement covered 100 group stores.

“Our stores are the showcase of our excellence. Improving this footprint means setting an example, influencing behavior and making our stores and products more desirable. It also means improving the environmental footprint of our partners, because our stores are the landlords’ Scope 3,” Arnault told WWD.

“That’s why the five of us have put a lot of heart into defining the actions of this partnership, which concern energy, eco-design, water and waste management, defining the duties and responsibilities of each party. This kind of agreement will continue in other parts of the world,” he added.

Chalhoub also emphasized the need to work together, particularly in the fast-changing retail landscape of the Middle East.

“There are a lot of challenges in this part of the world from local infrastructure to lack of regulatory frameworks. The UAE is a new country, so it takes time and it’s developing. But when we look at how we will act on waste management and water management, using renewable energy, we have to do it collectively in our malls, the industry,” Chalhoub Group president Patrick Chalhoub told WWD. “This is why this partnership is so important. When we can collectively address the issue, it helps companies be more responsible.”

Under the moniker “Unity for Change,” the companies are coming together to reduce the environmental and carbon footprints of the retail sector. The signing was a kickoff for a more granular agreement on “clear objectives” that will govern common spaces, as well as individual retail stores. The group will also do further research into use of green concrete and recycling objectives.

Arnault noted that Berluti, where he currently serves as chief executive officer through the end of the year, became the first luxury store in the world to hit the Full Project certification from the Forest Stewardship Council at its Mall of Emirates location. That mall is owned by Majid al-Futtaim, one of the key partners in the new agreement.

“It shows our commitment to sustainable materials in our value chain and the importance of biodiversity, as well as climate, in our environmental targets,” Arnault said of putting targets in practice with the Berluti store. The group noted it’s an example of eco-design with architects to artisans being involved in the build, as well as the mall developers.

In a second big signing, LVMH invested 1 million euros in a partnership with the Brazilian NGO Foundation for Amazon Sustainability to fight deforestation. It’s part of the group’s longstanding relationship with UNESCO’s “Man and the Biosphere” project, with an overarching goal of protecting 5 million hectares of wildlife habitat.

The partnership will study and monitor wildlife in the Rio Negro region, develop biodiversity management education at local schools, and invest in production infrastructure of existing local supply chains.

It was signed by Arnault, LVMH environmental development director Hélène Valade and FAS chief executive officer Virgilio Viana.

“Deforestation and hydric stress are among the main threats to ecosystems in the Amazon region,” he said. This project “respects local cultural contexts,” Arnault said, adding the project addresses the intertwined issues of environment and economic need. “LVMH’s overall objective is to regenerate 5 million hectares of wildlife habitat worldwide, and to limit the environmental impact of its activities. The idea being to support people in moving from an informal economy to a formal economy and to fight against deforestation for economic reasons.”

Arnault said this agreement, as well as the group’s continued support of the Circular Bioeconomy Alliance and programs in the water scarce region of Chad, demonstrate its commitment to regenerative agriculture.

At COP27 last year, LVMH signed another biodiversity partnership, with the Circular Bioeconomy Alliance. This year it revealed the initial results of that program, which trains farmers and preserves land, are on track to produce its first harvest of regenerative cotton in 2024. LVMH anticipates integrating this material into its supply chain.

The partnerships are designed to have long-tail effects across the regions. “What’s going on is way beyond fashion, all industries are concerned,” he said.

COP28 convened Nov. 30 under a cloud of skepticism since the host country Dubai is a major oil-producing nation. The conference’s president Sultan Al Jaber also holds the position of CEO of the state oil company.

Arnault emphasized that it is important to remain engaged.

“We believe we need to act collectively, joining forces with our partners, find solutions together,” he said.

It’s the third COP for LVMH, and the group’s presence “is continuing its policy of testimony and dialogue with stakeholders” with its activations at the convention. The group also brought designer Stella McCartney to COP and supported her “sustainable market” pavilion, which showcased innovative materials. McCartney formally launched her work with cork from LVMH-owned Veuve Clicquot.

Arnault said the group’s philosophy focuses on partnerships across industries.

“We usually are where things happen,” he said of the group’s presence at environmental conventions. “We believe that private players must support the public sector and provide solutions to the climate challenge. It’s also important to testify of our progress, and as a leader, to set up an example — act on climate, but also on biodiversity, both being linked.”

While COP28 has seen some controversy over remarks Al Jaber made that there is “no science” behind the phase-out of fossil fuels, Arnault said that those present were continuing to work on moving forward.

“What I have seen on the ground is a very strong mobilization of stakeholders to find solutions and move forward together, as illustrated by our partnership on stores with Chalhoub and three other main landlords in the region,” he added. COP28 will conclude Dec. 12.

LVMH, which set a target to reduce its energy use by 10 percent within the last year, said it has reached that goal. It has also set the goal of “full traceability” by 2026. Arnault was affirmative that the group is on the path to achieving that target, as well as its emissions reductions targets that encompass a 50 percent reduction in Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 2026, and a 55 percent reduction in Scope 3 emissions by 2030.

“The certification rates of LVMH’s main supply chains according to the most robust standards have increased significantly over the past two years, providing reasonable assurance that the 2026 target will be met,” he said. “LVMH has set ambitions, identified levers for action to achieve them and will make additional announcements on the achievement of these results.”

The group’s report will be unveiled on Dec. 14 at a conference in Paris.

Could Napa Valley Become a Fashion Destination? - WWD,"Sat, 02 Dec 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3dkLmNvbS9leWUvbGlmZXN0eWxlL25hcGEtdmFsbGV5LWNvdWxkLWJlY29tZS1hLWZhc2hpb24tZGVzdGluYXRpb24tMTIzNTkyNTUwNC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"“Stun-ning,” says Mimi DeBlasio, a former wardrobe stylist who is the co-owner of the cult Scarecrow Wine, watching her friend emerge from the dressing room in a $4,500 Valentino cocktail dress at Elyse Walker‘s new store in the Napa Valley’s St. Helena, Calif.

Walker is hosting a cocktail party to celebrate the brand’s Black Tie eveningwear collection — which popped up at only one other store in the country, Bergdorf Goodman — then having a dinner at her home with an appropriately Valentino red table-scape and food by “Hell’s Kitchen” winner Christina Machamer.

Stylish women, some who flew in for the event, are snapping up minidresses and bags for the many occasions that happen in the California wine region 50 miles northeast of San Francisco that has some of the world’s most luxurious hospitality, food and beverage offerings but has been “starved for fashion,” as Colgin Cellars doyenne Ann Colgin puts it.

“Elyse has figured out that even though this is an agricultural market, we’re all businesswomen, we travel a lot, and we don’t always have time to put together outfits. She has a Valentino if you need it, but if you need an up-to-date jean, sweater and boot, and maybe you aren’t sure how to put it together, they are experts at it,” says Leslie Frank, a broadcast journalist turned founder of Frank Family Vineyards, wearing a Valentino Iconographe cape.

Luxury groups LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton and Chanel have been investing in Napa Valley vineyards since the 1970s. And while you won’t find Dioriviera or Chanel pop-ups attached to tasting rooms — at least not yet — waning wine sales, particularly among Millennials, are forcing the area of 400-plus wineries to look at broadening offerings to attract tourists.

Walker is one of a number of pandemic-era transplants bringing new ideas to the destination — comprised of small towns Napa, Yountville, St. Helena and Calistoga — which has a lot in common with secondary markets that have become retail magnets in recent years, such as Aspen, Montecito and the Hamptons.

All of which begs the question: Could Napa Valley become a fashion destination?

“I’ve talked many times about Dolce & Gabbana doing Alta Moda in the Napa Valley. Their Asian clients could get there easily and there are so many locations that are a fit for a backdrop,” says Alexis Swanson Traina, who for many years served as creative director of her family’s Swanson Vineyards in St. Helena before launching HiNote, an app that helps people create personalized digital communications.

In September, Traina’s sister Veronica Swanson Beard took over Elyse Walker’s temporary space just off Main Street in St. Helena. “The Veronica Beard uniform is a blazer and jeans…you can wear that with flats if you’re a marketing executive or a winemaker in Napa Valley, then throw on your heels to go to dinner at French Laundry,” the designer says of the offerings in Veronica Beard’s sixth California store.

Napa Valley has long been a luxury travel destination, with numerous high-end hotels including the classic Meadowood, now fully restored after the devastating 2020 Glass Fire; a Four Seasons, and three Auberge properties. The newest is Auberge Stanly Ranch on the southern edge of the valley, which opened in April 2022 with a new focus on retail: a Fifth Avenue Club offering personal shopping from Saks Fifth Avenue, including same-day delivery for those who might prefer to shop from afar than visit troubled downtown San Francisco.

Veronica Beard opened its sixth California store in the Napa Valley.

“San Francisco is trying to find its footing so a lot of people are also using day tripping as a great opportunity,” says Traina, who in 2017 published the guidebook “From Napa With Love.”

“There are so many things going on. The Slanted Door, which is Charles Pham’s extraordinary French Vietnamese restaurant from San Francisco, just opened in Napa….Capo from Santa Monica is coming. Elyse’s store was eye-opening to me, she put such care into it. I’m desperate to see Kemo Sabe show up,” she says of the high-end Western wear retailer based in Aspen that has five stores in resort towns.

“Napa Valley survived two massive fires and the pandemic, and it’s taken time to reignite a way of living. But at the same time new people are coming in, bringing fresh ideas. Main Street in downtown Napa was dead and now there’s hardly any space not under construction and ready to open,” she says of the momentum, while cautioning that Napa Valley is just 26 miles long and 3 miles wide, and is an agricultural preserve with many use restrictions.

Walker, who owns six stores in California and New York, never thought she’d find a business opportunity when she started spending time at her home in St. Helena during the pandemic, only to move to the area permanently. She now commutes to her office in Los Angeles twice a month.

Elyse Walker Napa hosted the Valentino Black Tie collection installation in October.

“It’s farmland, I was coming here to relax,” she says, adding that when she began doing some styling and shopping for local friends during the height of COVID-19, it solidified that there was an untapped market. “It reminded me of the Pacific Palisades when I started there,” she says of the small town community in L.A. where she started 24 years ago.

The retailer has brought Celine bags, Rosetta Getty blazers and Saint Laurent blouses to a historic 1800s building on St. Helena’s Main Street, where shopping has until now leaned more toward the low-key and traditional, as evidenced by the 100-plus-year-old Model Bakery, Mario’s from Seattle for men’s haberdashery, and Sportago for Patagonia fleece.

Luxury brands have taken notice; Bottega Veneta approached Walker for an exclusive art installation, then Valentino came calling. “I was surprised to see a lot of people flew in for the event but also locals who shop Valentino with Elyse. It was good to see we have clientele here that we weren’t necessarily aware of,” says Karoline Auger, brand manager for Valentino.

Other European luxury players have long invested in the local wine industry, but not brought fashion with them per se.

In 1973, LVMH’s Moët Hennessy opened Chandon, the first French-owned sparkling wine producer in Napa Valley, which has just renovated its Yountville Estate for the 50th anniversary with a contemporary and sustainable design with soothing earth tones, a new restaurant and stunning outdoor venues with private patios, nooks and cabanas, creating a day club atmosphere.

Chandon’s 50th anniversary renovation creates a day-club-like atmosphere on the grounds.

The restaurant at Chandon launched Napa Valley’s fine dining scene, opening in 1977, and it was the first winery to receive a Michelin star.

“There was a moment in time when it became a frat house, we acknowledged the reality…the piece on wine education got lost, and now we’ve rebalanced that experience,” says Chandon’s marketing manager Mitalee Gupte of updating the experience, touting the new chef’s garden and culinary journeys.

Chandon will soon debut a new retail concept on-site with tableware and home and hearth accessories selected by sustainable marketplace Powered by People, but no LVMH fashion merchandise.

You won’t find any at the three other Moët Hennessy-owned vineyards, either.

“If anything they are bringing us some of their private clients, but we don’t talk a lot about being owned by them. It’s out there but when you come here, you don’t see any Louis Vuitton,” says Elizabeth Phelps Neuman, Senior Director of DTC, Marketing and Business Development for Joseph Phelps Vineyards. The St. Helena winery with a tasting terrace that has a postcard view of the valley was acquired by LVMH in 2022.

“This is the original building my grandfather built in 1974 and when the chief executive officer of Moët Hennessy Philippe Schaus came the day the acquisition closed, he said, ‘I think we could do a little modernizing and put some comfortable furniture in.’ And he’s made some great changes,'” she says during a tour of the indoor space that reopened in September after a renovation by Nobu go-to Montalba Architects.

“We need more brand awareness and amplification and they know how to do that,” she says of selling to LVMH. “I’m proud that they came to us.”

The vineyard produces one of the most iconic American wines, Insignia, California’s first proprietary Bordeaux blend, which has been served for decades to presidents and heads of states, including former U.S. President Barack Obama and French President Emmanuel Macron.

On the subject of fashion, Neuman says her grandfather was a bon vivant in his day. “He got his pajamas from Harrods and had them pressed every day,” she remembers, adding that he wore them out to dinner, too. “That’s Napa style, if you want to go glam you go glam, if you want to wear pajamas, you wear pajamas.”

In 2015, Chanel owners Alain and Gerard Wertheimer purchased the sustainable St. Supéry Estate Vineyards and Winery in St. Helena, adding to their two properties in Bordeaux. At the property’s historic Queen Anne Atkinson House, built in 1882 and now on the National Historical Register, a tome about Chanel sits on the coffee table next to Napa Valley history books.

“We have done the remodel of part of the Atkinson house and a lot of investment in the cellar, and they’ve been hugely supportive of us doing more each year,” says Emma Swain, St. Supéry’s CEO, of the relationship with the brand. She’s wearing Chanel boots during a tour of the French-style gardens and winery which produces Estate-grown, certified Napa Green wines, including a terrific 2022 Dollarhide Sauvignon Blanc fermented in cold concrete.

“We work together on our global strategy, particularly improving quality, improving experience, our giving and philanthropy. And we share a lot of ideas on sustainability with each other. They are very involved on a global level and we are on a local level,” says Swain, adding that St. Supéry also collaborates with Chanel on raising money for the area, for clients’ causes, and hosting employee events.

Chanel’s nearest boutique is in San Francisco, however.

St. Supéry chief executive officer Emma Swain.

“I think there is a desire to have more activities other than wine. We have the Agricultural Preserve and we can’t develop other activities within that,” she says of the first and only zoning legislation of its kind in the U.S., passed in 1968. “But where we can do more things in town, it’s great. You can’t drink wine all day.”

Napa Valley impresario Jean-Charles Boisset is one of a new generation trying to create more experiences while celebrating the area’s history. The native of France moved to the Bay Area in 1991 to lead his family’s wine import business and acquired several vineyards, including California’s oldest, Buena Vista, in 2011 and Elizabeth Spencer in 2021, which now houses the Kathleen Thomas Hill Kitchen Memories collection of culinary relics.

Married to Gina Gallo, the third-generation face of the family behind the world’s largest wine producer by volume, E & J Gallo, Boisset has a flair for branding and has produced jewelry with Swarovski, crystal with Baccarat, fragrance with Ex Nihilo and hosted events with Neiman Marcus. His De Lalisse Champère sparkling wine has been featured in Netflix’s “Emily in Paris.”

Boisset has several F&B and hospitality projects in his portfolio, including the historic Oakville Grocery with its Napa Wine History Museum, and the Calistoga Depot, where in February he’s opening a distillery with its own collection of spirits, and creating an “adult beverage experience” across 2 acres and six vintage train cars offering everything from whiskey blending to tequila and wine tasting, Champagne and caviar pairing and wine-infused chocolate.

He’s also setting up a wellness boutique, tapping into Calistoga’s heritage of hot springs and health, and is bullish on the future of the town, which has 800 hotel rooms, including a Rosewood coming in, and connects to the walking and biking Vine Trail currently under construction to connect the entire Napa Valley.

Calistoga Depot Dylan Elliott

The region now has a lot of activities beyond wine and food, Boisset says. “BottleRock Napa Valley is an incredible event in May. We are very active with Festival Napa Valley in July, which is bringing the best classical music singers like [Andrea] Bocelli up here….It’s wine and food, music, art and a younger generation who want to come and play and make wine,” he says, adding a plug for another project that will let people purchase a few rows of one of his vineyards.

The ultimate experience could well be a luxury brand fashion show in one of those vineyards, of course.

“I see it coming,” he says.

“There is no shortage of taste,” says Traina.

“So many people have moved here over the last 25 years from other areas, and while most of them travel a lot, go to art exhibitions in other places, and shop around the world, they want their community to be elevated,” says Colgin, the art collector, philanthropist and founder of top-tier Colgin Cellars who sold a 60 percent stake in her business to LVMH titan Bernard Arnault after bonding with him over modern art.

“Luxury branding, I’m not sure St. Helena is really ready, but this mix of what Elyse has is a niche for this area,” she adds.

What about a Dior runway show among the vines at Colgin? “Well,” she says, “that would be fantastic.”"
LVMH partners with Miami Design District to power stores by solar energy - Dezeen,"Fri, 08 Dec 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlemVlbi5jb20vMjAyMy8xMi8wOC9sdm1oLW1pYW1pLWRlc2lnbi1kaXN0cmljdC1zdXN0YWluYWJpbGl0eS1hZ3JlZW1lbnQv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Luxury goods company LVMH, which owns brands including Louis Vuitton, Dior and Fendi, has signed an agreement with Miami Design District to improve the environmental performance of its stores in the district.

Unveiled this week during Miami art week, the agreement will see the stores from the company's 15 brands in the district powered by solar from 2025. It also includes commitments on water and power use as well as material choices.

The agreement will allow the stores to be powered by renewable sources, even though LVMH does not own the properties.

""In most of our retail we don't own the premises, we're tenants, so we don't pay for the power or utilities, we pay our ledger,"" said CEO of LVMH North America Anish Melwani who signed the agreement with Craig Robins, CEO of Dacra, which co-owns Miami Design District.

""So even if you want to find renewable power there isn't a way to do it,"" he continued. ""So that is the problem-solving that was required.""

The Miami Design District is a neighbourhood in Miami, which has been developed since the early 2000s by Dacra and includes numerous luxury fashion stores, design shops and art institutions including the Institute for Contemporary Art.

It is home to 15 LVMH brands including Marc Jacobs, Givenchy, Fendi, Dior, Sephora, Bulgari, Hublot, Tiffany & Co, Berluti and Louis Vuitton, which is located in a store designed by Dutch studio Marcel Wanders.

The agreement also saw LVMH commit to targets on rainwater and power use – as well as waste. It will see a centralised energy monitoring system put in place in the district, along with a comprehensive stormwater management plan.

With its new stores and renovations of existing stores, LVMH will source the majority of materials from within Florida and 100 per cent of wood will be FSC-certified by 2025.

""As luxury brands, we have to create extraordinary environments for our customers. How do we do that with materials that can be sourced locally?"" said Melwani.

""That's also part of the commitment that our stores are making, we're still going to export some things from exotic parts of the world, but we are going to do less of that – we'll take advantage of the extraordinary things that are available here.""

LVMH signed the agreement as part of its ongoing strategy to improve the sustainability of its 5,600 global stores. Speaking at the event to mark the agreement, Melwani explained that focusing on sustainability was ""existential"" to the business.

""Luxury is all about making excellent products in the traditional methods,"" he said. ""And for us means making, for example, fragrances with real flowers that are grown in fields, that means growing Champagne grapes that can only grow in the Champagne region.""

""And so when you think about how many of our products come from natural things that have been grown in the same place for centuries, those coming under threat from climate change is existential,"" he continued.

""It's truly about protecting our business, our ability to do things the way they've always done.""

The company aims to start replicating the partnership with its other landlords in the US and has begun similar initiatives in China and the Middle East.

The announcement follows British fashion designer Stella McCartney and LVMH presentation of a market of sustainable material innovations at climate conference COP28. The market presented 15 innovators that provided plant-based alternatives to plastic, animal leather and fur as well as regenerative alternatives to traditional fibres.

""The fashion industry accounts for eight per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions,"" McCartney said. ""We need to get creative and innovative with alternatives, moving beyond the limited materials that the industry has been working with traditionally.""

LVMH Signs Deal to Sell Majority of Cruise Retail Business - WWD,"Fri, 08 Dec 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3dkLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy1uZXdzL2ZpbmFuY2lhbC9sdm1oLXNlbGxpbmctY3J1aXNlLXJldGFpbC1idXNpbmVzcy1qaW0tZ2lzc3ktaW52ZXN0b3JzLTEyMzYwMjkxMzcv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"It’s anchors away for the LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton cruise retail business.

The luxury giant said it cut a deal to sell a majority stake of Cruise Line Holdings Co. — parent to the Starboard and Onboard Cruise Services businesses — to a group of private investors led by Jim Gissy. The transaction is expected to close in the next few days.

LVMH said, “The new investors are strategic partners in the vacation retail space with a culture of innovation and a growth mindset.”

Starboard has worked to make the cruise ship a shopping destination in its own right with more than 700 duty-free shops offering indulgences from fine jewelry and Swiss watches to leather accessories and beauty products.

Lisa Bauer, the travel industry veteran who became chief executive officer of Starboard in 2019, will continue to lead the company along with her executive team.

“They will be charged with accelerating the strong post-COVID[-19] pandemic business momentum and developing new cruise retail opportunities, as well as land-based vacation retail,” the luxury group said. “LVMH will continue as an important minority shareholder in this new company.”

Bauer said: “We are so energized with the new opportunities that will open up to us. The entire leadership team is focused on taking the tremendous progress we have made and directing that toward continuing success in 2024 and beyond.”

At sea, the retail business involves familiar brand names but the presentation, context and experience can be very different. Starboard operated 82 cruise ships as of the end of last year.

In an interview with the National Retail Federation this year, Bauer noted that at least 50 percent of the guests on board are celebrating some kind of a milestone.

“To commemorate the occasion, we suggest private retail appointments or a concierge for store outings,” she said. “Experiential retail would also be things that are exclusive, like a local artist from Barcelona that comes aboard and hand-paints on silk scarves.

“One of the funniest things we do is on the Royal Caribbean ships, called the Rising Tide Watch and Scotch event, where guests learn about luxury Swiss timepieces paired with premium scotch as they ascend deck levels,” Bauer said. “Five ships in the Oasis-class series have something called the Rising Tide Bar that goes from Deck Five to the top. On Deck Five we have entry-level watches paired with reasonably priced scotch. On Deck Six, it’s higher-price-point watches and scotch, all the way to the top. It feels like it’s part of the experience, not just retail.”"

LVMH strikes deal to sell majority stake in cruise retail business - The Moodie Davitt Report,"Fri, 08 Dec 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vbW9vZGllZGF2aXR0cmVwb3J0LmNvbS9sdm1oLXN0cmlrZXMtZGVhbC10by1zZWxsLW1ham9yaXR5LXN0YWtlLWluLWNydWlzZS1yZXRhaWwtYnVzaW5lc3Mv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"US/INTERNATIONAL. LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton has struck an agreement to sell a majority stake in its cruise retail business, which includes Starboard Cruise Services and Onboard Media, to a group of investors. These are led by Jim Gissy, Executive Vice President of Westgate Resorts, with LVMH remaining “an important minority shareholder”, believed to be close to 20% according to reliable Moodie Davitt sources in France.

A new joint-venture company, Global Travel Retail Holdings, has been created to manage the business.

“The new investors are strategic partners in the vacation retail space with a culture of innovation and a growth mindset,” LVMH said.

The agreement to sell a majority stake in Cruise Line Holdings Co, the parent company of the Starboard & Onboard Cruise Services businesses, should be concluded in the coming days.

Starboard President & Chief Executive Officer Lisa Bauer will continue to lead the business, whose remit will extend from cruise ships to vacation retail locations on land.

Starboard said in a statement on LinkedIn: “Capping off an incredible year for Starboard and Onboard Media, we are thrilled to announce the formation of Global Travel Retail Holdings, welcoming four new investors who will take ownership positions in Starboard and Onboard together with LVMH.

“Joining LVMH in the new ownership group are new Board Chair Jim Gissy, Board Vice Chair Marcia Rowley along with her husband John Rowley, the family office of Central Florida-based billionaire David Siegel, and Hannaford Investments, LLC, co-owned by Michael and Crisa Marder. Lisa Bauer, CEO of Starboard and Onboard Media will serve on the company’s board of directors.”

Bauer said: “I’ve known and worked with Jim, Marcia, John, and David for nearly 20 years. Having worked alongside them driving profitable growth and excellent customer experience, I knew they were the perfect partners to help take Starboard and Onboard Media forward.

“Our entire company is excited for this next phase of expansion. We have been very fortunate to be a Maison within the LVMH Group since 2000, and we are appreciative of LVMH’s continued and important participation in the venture going forward.”"
Matthew Williams to Exit Givenchy | BoF - The Business of Fashion,"Fri, 01 Dec 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzb2ZmYXNoaW9uLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy9sdXh1cnkvbWF0dGhldy13aWxsaWFtcy10by1leGl0LWdpdmVuY2h5L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Matthew Williams is set to exit Givenchy after three and a half years as its creative director, the Paris-based fashion house said in a short statement.

The American designer rose to prominence designing for performers like Kanye West before founding his own label, 1017 Alyx 9SM, in 2015. Known for a haute streetwear aesthetic blending sleek tailoring with utility-inspired metallic accents, Williams recently secured a new investor for Alyx, Hong Kong-based entrepreneur Adrien Cheng. (The label was originally backed by Slam Jam founder Luca Benini).

At LVMH-owned Givenchy, Williams’ vision got off to a rocky start during the pandemic, which limited exposure for his first shows. Following mixed reviews for his early collections, the designer found steadier footing after settling on a concept that straddled his penchant for punkish streetwear with the history of the house, aided by stylist Carine Roitfeld.

Still, the brand’s fashion message remained somewhat fuzzy: after teetering from the gothic couture-meets-streetwear aesthetic of Riccardo Tisci to Clare Waight Keller’s back-to-the-archives, classic vision, Givenchy likely needed a clearer, more captivating take on fashion as well as heftier investments from its parent company in order to keep up with stablemates like Celine and Loewe, mega-brands in the making which have enjoyed rapid growth in recent cycles.

While LVMH doesn’t communicate sales for individual brands, analysts believe the brand continues to underperform. “I don’t believe Givenchy is on the front foot and may well be below the pre-pandemic revenue level,” analyst Luca Solca said, pointing out that the brand was not mentioned in the group’s third-quarter results presentation.

Succession plans have yet to be announced Some industry insiders see Sarah Burton, the celebrated successor to late designer Alexander McQueen, as a shoe-in for the role since her departure from the UK-based label was announced in September. But Burton isn’t the sector’s only free agent: the fashion industry is bracing for news on where designers such as Alessandro Michele and Riccardo Tisci will stage their next acts.

Until a new creative director is announced Givenchy’s collections will be designed by its studio team.

AI Startup Backed By Bernard Arnault's LVMH Uses AI To Tell You If That Louis Vuitton Bag Is Real Or Fake - Benzinga,"Tue, 26 Dec 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5iZW56aW5nYS5jb20vbmV3cy8yMy8xMi8zNjM4MTYzMC9haS1zdGFydHVwLWJhY2tlZC1ieS1iZXJuYXJkLWFybmF1bHRzLWx2bWgtdXNlcy1haS10by10ZWxsLXlvdS1pZi10aGF0LWxvdWlzLXZ1aXR0b24tYmFnLWlzLXJlYWwtb3LSAS1odHRwczovL3d3dy5iZW56aW5nYS5jb20vYW1wL2NvbnRlbnQvMzYzODE2MzA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"A startup backed by the world's second richest person, Bernard Arnault, can detect if that Louis Vuitton bag you have your eyes on is fake or real.

What Happened: Entrupy, backed by LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE LVMHF, claims that it can detect whether that pre-owned luxury bag you're checking out is fake or real, with an accuracy rate of 99.1%.

Arnault, the CEO of Louis Vuitton, is currently the second richest person in the world with a net worth of $179 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.

This year, AI's sharp rise in popularity has also led to some consumer-facing solutions being launched, like AI-powered Google Maps that solves a real-world problem for users, showing that this technology is not limited to things used only by a limited set of users or has a novel use case.

Besides, not everyone has the eye to spot fakes regarding luxury items. This is what Entrupy claims to be solving.

""The whole point of doing this is to add trust and make it verifiable as a third party,"" Vidyuth Srinivasan, Entrupy's co-founder, told Elle in an interview.

""It’s the consumer having the certainty that this is not just [one] person saying that it’s authentic, there’s also a third party that’s not invested in the transaction, certifying it,"" he added.

For now, Entrupy's solutions are only available to resellers. Its AI tool requires the reseller to capture images of the bag or other luxury items from all angles by inserting a phone into a hardware device from the company.

Entrupy then uses these images to verify the product’s authenticity using AI and an image database of the authentic ones.

The company also issues a certificate based on the results of its tests – resellers can display this along with the product to show customers that the authenticity has been tested.

Why It Matters: This AI solution solves a real-world problem regarding the authenticity of high-value luxury items.

Counterfeit products also hurt the economy. According to a report by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, counterfeit products cost the global economy over $500 billion a year.

However, Entrupy currently only works with select brands, so if you buy a product that the company has not yet covered, you will have to rely on traditional methods and your discretion.

LVMH holds LIFE 360 Summit and launches supplier initiative - International Leather Maker,"Fri, 15 Dec 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vaW50ZXJuYXRpb25hbGxlYXRoZXJtYWtlci5jb20vbHZtaC1ob2xkcy1saWZlLTM2MC1zdW1taXQtYW5kLWxhdW5jaGVzLXN1cHBsaWVyLWluaXRpYXRpdmUv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LIFE (LVMH Initiatives For the Environment) 360 launched in 2021 with a deadline of 2023 for a series of environmental actions and further deadlines of 2026 and 2030 for others.

The 2023 achievements include establishing a repair-and-care task force at several of its brands. For example, Louis Vuitton repairs 600,000 products per year, while 79% of Berluti’s leather products are repairable. The company has also created LVMH Circularity, to bring together reuse and recycling efforts across the group and its partners.

Meanwhile, after having helped regenerate 1.37 million hectares by the end of 2022, LVMH has a target of regenerating five million hectares by the end of 2030. Additionally, the group reduced Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 11% in absolute terms per unit of added value between 2019 and 2022, plus a 15% drop for Scope 3 emissions.

Additionally, LVMH has a target of pinpointing the countries of origin of its strategic raw materials by 2023, which is ongoing but reportedly on track to being achieved. The company now knows more than 95% of the countries of origin for its diamonds, wool and leather. “Complete traceability” is the target for 2026.

LVMH is now confident in reaching its 2026 and 2030 LIFE 360 targets, with the possible exception of its 2026 target of zero virgin fossil-based plastics.

The group has also launched LIFE 360 Business Partners, an initiative to support emissions reductions and other impacts across its suppliers. Several brands under the LVMH umbrella have initiated transition plans for their suppliers and, from 2024, the group will organise Sustainability Business Partners Days to work with suppliers on these targets.

Hélène Valade, Environment Development Director at LVMH, said: “Scope 3 emissions account for more than 90% of our environmental footprint and arise mainly from the impact of raw materials and transport. This encompasses emissions from the upstream and downstream of our value chain, not assets that we own or control.

“This is why these emissions are the most challenging to reduce. To achieve our ambitious Scope 3 targets, both in terms of carbon emissions and impact on water and biodiversity, the mobilization of suppliers is essential. LVMH is committed to supporting them with the LIFE 360 Business Partners program.”

(Big thank you to Line Sheet stars Gwyneth Paltrow and Mickey Drexler for contributing.) Like everything we do here, this guide is smart, entertaining, often funny, and useful. Enjoy. In today’s private email, I’ve got some delightful deal gossip from the beauty world, the latest legal filings against Estée Lauder and LVMH, and a dive into the past, present, and future of Mansur Gavriel, the brand that made the It-bag to end all It-bags. One more thing: If you know me—which I guess you do now, right?—you know I love to plan ahead, so I’m currently prepping a mailbag issue for the end of the year. Send through any and all questions related to the fashion and beauty industries! Can’t wait to hear from you. Coverage requests are also welcome. Mentioned in this issue: Rachel Mansur and Floriana Gavriel, Gucci Westman, David Neville, DFS Group, Andowah Newton, LVMH, Estée Lauder, Tanya and Zhenya Posternak, Shira Sue Carmi, Farfetch, Maria Borromeo, Byron Trott, and many more… A MESSAGE FROM GLAMSQUAD Glamsquad brings salon-quality hair, makeup, and nail services straight to your home, office, or hotel suite. And their top-tier beauty pros are at the center of it all. We sat down with Glamsquad makeup artist, Jeanette Aguirre, to get an inside look at the on-demand glam experience. “Every day with Glamsquad is different,” says Jeanette, “I’ll work with a runway model in the morning and a busy mom in the afternoon — and each of them has their own distinct style. It’s exciting for me because I get to exercise my full potential and create a range of looks. When we asked if she has a favorite client, Jeanette jokes, “I’ll never tell.” She goes on to explain that she’s close to many of her repeat bookers. “But even the clients who book me over and over are all so different. I love the variety, it keeps me sharp.” Book now for a fresh, holiday glow. Monday Thoughts… A new development in the Estée Lauder saga : Last Thursday, investors filed a class-action lawsuit against the Estée Lauder Companies, claiming that the group misled shareholders about what was really going on with its supply chain and inventory management in the U.S. and Asia. C.E.O. Fabrizio Freda and C.F.O. Tracey T . Travis are both named in the suit, which accuses the execs of making “overwhelmingly positive” statements during the period between August 2022 and May 2023, thus inflating the stock price. The plaintiffs are claiming that Freda and Travis, in particular, weren’t honest about the supply chain being messed up and inventory levels being too high during calls with investors. Investor lawsuits materialize for all sorts of reasons, and this one sure does come at an inconvenient time for Freda, whose unprecedented run of making a lot of money for Estée shareholders ended this year as the stock slid following missed projections. (Shares are down more than 60 percent from their pandemic peak in December 2021.) But while there may be a constituency on the company’s board that wants Freda out, as a recent Wall Street Journal article posited , it’s unlikely this suit would prompt his departure—especially if the S.E.C. doesn’t bother taking a hard look at the plaintiffs’ claims. As I wrote last month, this is going to be a tough period for the group, with succession and big-picture strategy questions looming on top of operational issues. Disgruntled shareholders aren’t the half of it. A rep for Estée Lauder declined to comment.

: Last Thursday, investors filed a against the Estée Lauder Companies, claiming that the group misled shareholders about what was going on with its supply chain and inventory management in the U.S. and Asia. Gucci Westman might sell… maybe, someday: The beauty industry gossip this week is that makeup artist Gucci Westman was exploring a potential sale of her cosmetics line, Westman Atelier, beloved by women who buy violet eyeshadow at Violet Grey and wear violet High Sport kick flares, to a strategic investor or private equity firm. There was even talk of flirtation with our friends at the Estée Lauder Companies. (ELC had no comment on that.) Upon further investigation, I learned from sources close to the company that it’s not happening, not this year, not next year… maybe in 2025. (A Westman Atelier spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment.) What I know is that there have been no formal conversations about a sale, and a process has not been started. Anyway, the brand hasn’t yet reached $100 million in annual revenue, and there’s just a lot of potential upside for current investors, including Andrew Rosen and Imaginary Ventures, if they wait until it’s bigger. But this is certainly the beauty brand to watch, IMO. It checks so many consumer boxes. One industry insider called Westman’s line “The Row of the beauty business”—a reference to its minimalist packaging; emphasis on enhancement, not augmentation; and, more recently, influencer-level front person. It’s an interesting opportunity for investors looking to bet on the customer who wants to look like Gwyneth Paltrow—or Westman, who is gorgeous—not the filler crowd. (And really, it would be an excellent pickup for Estée, which needs a stronger luxury bench. Remember, beauty is all about the high-low right now.) Westman, who runs the business with her husband, Rag & Bone co-founder David Neville, is smart to hold out a while longer. After all, $100 million a year in sales is actually pretty small for a beauty brand, and she could probably double that pretty quickly with increased distribution and a bit more paid marketing. A former LVMH lawyer is suing LVMH: Andowah Newton, the former vice president of legal affairs in the U.S. for LVMH, filed a claim in a New York Federal Court today accusing the company of a bunch of things, but mostly that she was fired years after reporting sexual harassment by Lloyd Doran, the former director of property and facility operations for LVMH in the U.S. (He retired in 2020.) In the claim, Newton says that LVMH “did everything it could to intimidate Ms. Newton into not pursuing her claims and convince Ms. Newton that the harassment was just a byproduct of being an ‘attractive woman’ who works at a company with a French culture, and thus should simply be tolerated.” After Newton sent Doran an email complaining about the alleged harassment, she says that management “chastised” her and said that she should apologize to Doran, who was eventually promoted. Newton is suing the group under a new federal law that prohibits employers from “enforcing pre-dispute arbitration agreements in cases involving sexual harassment and sexual assault without the employee’s consent.” (Meaning that the accuser should be able to take a claim to court instead of using an arbitrator to settle the dispute.) She testified in front of the House of Representatives to help get the bill passed, and you can watch her here . In response to the new filing, a representative for LVMH North America said, “Ms. Newton is once again pursuing entirely baseless claims following those she initially made in 2018, which were found to be without merit after being investigated at the time internally as well as independently by a retired judge. As to her newest claim, her departure was part of a restructuring of the North America legal department, which affected a number of employees, late last year by our recently appointed North America Chief Legal Officer. Given this, we will continue to vigorously defend our position against these meritless and frivolous claims.” And now, my piece on Mansur Gavriel’s revival-ish… Life After The Bucket Bag Mansur Gavriel has experienced all the feels of our capricious industry in just a decade: a once-in-a-lifetime product, investor frenzy, a humbling, some misses, an executive shuffle, and more. And yet, they’ve lived to tell the tale, and with optimism. LAUREN SHERMAN About six months ago, Rachel Mansur and Floriana Gavriel, the co-founders of Mansur Gavriel, invited me to lunch. Of course I said yes: I happened to be heading to New York, I like them, and I was also curious to know what in the world was going on with their company, which had felt all the feels of this capricious business in about a decade: a swift and unprecedented rise, life under investor rule, management headaches, a humbling, and then, it seemed, something of a revival. The story of the brand is both well-trodden and legendary unto itself. The designers, both art-school kids, met at a concert in Los Angeles, where Mansur was living and Gavriel was visiting from Berlin. They developed a friendship over email, and developed the concept for the line over email, too. The intention was never to only do bags, but they started there, and it took them two years to develop those first styles. They each contributed $35,000 to fund the first round of production of two bags, the bucket and a tote, in just a few color combinations. What happened next never happens to designers: They walked into independent boutiques and the store owners placed orders for their patented bucket bag on the spot. They cold-emailed Net-a-Porter images of the line, and an order was immediately made. Mansur and Gavriel weren’t people who secretly had fashion-world connections. Instead, the product was selling because it looked good. What made the bags so wanted? The price—expensive, originally at $495, but not exorbitantly so—was key. As was the provenance—Italy, not China, but with China prices. And that lacquered lining—initially, two makeup shades of red and pink—was so alluring. I’ve known Rachel and Floriana for a decade. I first interviewed them in 2013, about a month after the then-blogger Garance Doré published a photograph of the black bucket bag with the cherry-coated lacquer interior, which made the fashion world go wild. In 2013, the market for luxury handbags was no longer ruled by one, most-popular style each season, and yet they had managed to create a once-in-a-lifetime frenzy. If you were there, you remember what it was like to see Mansur Gavriel fly. If you weren’t, I would liken it to the Cabbage Patch phenomenon of 1983 or three straight years of PlayStation 5 mayhem (2020-2023). I had never witnessed anything like that before in fashion. The designers were obviously inspired by Phoebe Philo, who started her epic run at Céline just a few years earlier, but nothing they did looked like a copy. And the imagery—which they shot themselves before hiring novice twin-sister photographers Tanya and Zhenya Posternak—was as spot-on as the product, itself. (The Ukraine-born Posternaks, who often capture bodies in the abstract, have since done campaigns for Jacquemus, Loewe, and Calvin Klein.) It also looked incredibly beautiful on Instagram, which was, at the time, just becoming fashion’s primary marketing channel—and you could still have plenty of success on there without paying for it. At each step along the way, from the brand concept to the product, their success came down to attention to detail. Rachel and Floriana are very serious and studious: They were meticulous not only about what the bags looked like, but how they were presented and distributed, from the marketing to the packaging (rendered in Millennial pink long before that color even had a name). Most fashion concepts, or lines, or labels, or whatever you want to call them, never become realized enough to be considered a brand. Mansur Gavriel was a brand from the beginning. And because of a lucky factory setup in Italy, the designers also had a fairly easy time turning around product. But things were moving so fast that orders would sell out instantly. Stores set up waitlists, and on the brand’s own site, $3 million worth of bags would clear in a couple of hours. (It would take about three months to restock.) The high demand allowed Mansur and Gavriel to ask for more upfront from retailers: Instead of waiting to be paid for 30 or 60 days after the goods were shipped, they’d require that stores give them a 30, 40, 50 percent down payment, which funded their production in those first few years. “We had no financial advisers at the time,” Mansur said. “Doing it all ourselves—keeping the money very tight.” A MESSAGE FROM GLAMSQUAD Glamsquad brings salon-quality hair, makeup, and nail services straight to your home, office, or hotel suite. And their top-tier beauty pros are at the center of it all. We sat down with Glamsquad makeup artist, Jeanette Aguirre, to get an inside look at the on-demand glam experience. “Every day with Glamsquad is different,” says Jeanette, “I’ll work with a runway model in the morning and a busy mom in the afternoon — and each of them has their own distinct style. It’s exciting for me because I get to exercise my full potential and create a range of looks. When we asked if she has a favorite client, Jeanette jokes, “I’ll never tell.” She goes on to explain that she’s close to many of her repeat bookers. “But even the clients who book me over and over are all so different. I love the variety, it keeps me sharp.” Book now for a fresh, holiday glow. The Backlash A stable cash stream offered Mansur and Gavriel a remarkable advantage. It allowed them to introduce new categories quickly, stage elaborate fashion-week productions, and open stores in New York and Los Angeles. But this is where things started to get tricky. Investors were circling. (I remember seeing Andrew Rosen and Pierre-Yves Roussel, then the head of the LVMH fashion group, at one of their early presentations.) They hit $35 million in annual revenue by the fourth year, but the majority of sales were coming from the bucket bag. The frenzy would die down at some point, they knew that, but they believed everything they had built around the bag was strong enough to stand without it. Then, the backlash started. New bag shapes were taking off, but not with the same dog-in-heat energy. When they first launched shoes, they received criticism online that they looked too similar to styles created by another designer, Maryam Nassir Zadeh, who sold her vintage-inspired sandals and pumps out of her influential Lower East Side boutique, and it damaged their industry reputation. And while they won CFDA Awards two years in a row, in 2015 and 2016, you could feel their apprehension and discomfort onstage. “All that CFDA stuff was hard, having to talk onstage twice,” Mansur told me a few weeks ago. “We are definitely shy.” Unlike many designers, they are not interested in the spotlight. They kept moving forward, though, hiring Shira Sue Carmi, who advised early-stage fashion brands, as their first president in 2017. Carmi was there to manage the tail end of the Maryam Nassir Zadeh incident, which cut so deep because they really related to her: They saw themselves as creative directors of a niche brand, not overseers of a commercial one. Carmi thought they were singular talents. “They can look at a shade of color and say, ‘This is not us,’” she recalled to me recently. They went ahead and launched a whole range of clothes, which was admirable, but harder to sell than bags and shoes: The prices of the ready-to-wear were higher than the accessories. By the end of 2018, they started looking for a financial backer in earnest. About a year in, they landed on Gary Fuhrman, whose GF Capital Management had backed Oscar de la Renta and Mark Cross, another handbag line, and been an investor in Tommy Hilfiger when he sold his company to PVH for $3 billion in 2010. But by 2019, when GF Capital invested in Mansur Gavriel, the brand was vulnerable. For better or worse, they gave up a majority stake in the business, and Carmi was quickly replaced by Isabelle Fevrier, who spent most of her career at DFS Group, a Hong Kong-based duty-free retailer owned by LVMH. (Carmi is now the C.E.O. of Altuzarra.) Blame the pandemic, blame a mismatch between Fevrier and the designers, blame time, but the last four years have been, on the face of it, a fairly obvious disaster for Mansur Gavriel. The product began to look and feel more generic, chasing trends rather than making them. It’s the classic private-equity fashion story: These firms see businesses like Mansur Gavriel as on the rise, and think they can grow super fast with a cash injection. The problem is, when a company is still very much founder-driven, with a singular vision, growth is often much slower. A fashion company typically needs to be north of $100 million in annual sales to truly stand on its own, without its founder. And even then, it’s not easy to maintain. The elegant strangeness of the line that had made it so distinct—the vegetable-tanned leather, the fuzzy photography, the logo—had been wiped away. The distribution became wider, too, more reliant on major department stores rather than niche boutiques. And along with that broadened distribution came an extreme reliance on discounting. They were forced to close the stores, and to stop making clothes, too. Mansur and Gavriel declined to comment on their relationship with Fevrier, but did confirm that, during her time at the company, they were relieved of all direct reports—a bizarre and disenchanting organizational decision that left them as founders and creative directors amid a rump state of bean counters. “We were floating in a corner,” Gavriel said. They were witnessing their vision dissolve before their eyes. This scenario isn’t altogether uncommon: Capital gets invited into a business, takes a controlling position, and has its way. And it almost never ends well. The problem for everyone involved is that the bucket bag was a once-in-a-lifetime success. And while there’s a path forward for a brand like that, it’s an extremely difficult one. The Turnaround By the time I met Mansur and Gavriel for lunch last summer at La Mercerie, the French-blue Parisian restaurant in Soho, they were spent but hopeful. After Fevrier left the business, in 2022, Mansur and Gavriel, along with their investors, spent months looking for the right replacement. Gayle Dizon, who produced their fashion shows, recommended Maria Borromeo, the former business partner of designer and editor Thakoon Panichgul. (She’d been with him through multiple iterations of his namesake brand, and was now working on her own line.) Borromeo’s assessment was that the previous team had focused too much on topline revenue, and not enough on profitability. “The brand had sort of recessed into this place of irrelevance,” she told me. The way to bring it forward, in her mind, would be to put Mansur and Gavriel back in creative control. “What I didn’t know before being introduced to them was how special they are,” she said. “We don’t have to reinvent the brand DNA; it’s all just there.” It’s been about six months since Borromeo joined, and since then, things have started to turn around. Annual sales are still in the vicinity of $35 million, but her focus is on introducing products that people want to buy at full price, which means giving Mansur and Gavriel the freedom to be as particular as they want to be. They are, for instance, shrinking the logo, and once again shooting much of the brand imagery themselves. They’ve also started to reintroduce apparel: a shaggy faux-fur jacket to start. (Next year, they’ll reissue a knit from 2018, the “Cloud” sweater, which is currently going on resale site Vestiaire for more than $700.) October was the first month of no promotions in years, and the company managed to surpass its sales goals anyway, and again in November. Will Mansur Gavriel ever really climb out from under its It-bag baggage? It’s hard to turn around anything these days, given the ever-multiplying competition and insatiable consumer desire for newness. There are also fewer exit options for investors like GF Capital: I.P.O.s are anemic, and firms like LVMH and Kering aren’t interested in brands under $1 billion. The best outcome would be to get it to $200 million, $300 million in sales and sell to another private equity firm, or one of the smaller strategic groups. But I do think Mansur Gavriel has a few things going for it. For one, it’s still a small business, which means its distribution didn’t get entirely out of hand. It’s also been 10 years since the bucket bag was first introduced, and seven or so since it reached its height of ubiquity. Give it a couple more before people are yearning for it again. Finally, it has Mansur and Gavriel. Oftentimes, founders get in their own way, and they’ve certainly made plenty of very naive, public mistakes over the years. But they’ve freed themselves of the pressure to re-create that initial success, instead choosing to focus on being uncompromising when it comes to what the brand should be. “I guess maybe one thing I learned during this is that we are so clear on what we want,” Mansur said. “All these tiny, little, subtle things are what come together to make a brand have a feeling.” What I’m Reading… Saks (the e-commerce site, not the stores) sent a note out to brands letting them know that everything is going to be okay and that they have enough cash.

Hermès heir plans to adopt 51-year-old gardener to pass on $11 billion fortune - Fortune,"Thu, 07 Dec 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vZm9ydHVuZS5jb20vZXVyb3BlLzIwMjMvMTIvMDcvaGVybWVzLWhlaXItcGxhbm5pbmctYWRvcHQtNTEteWVhci1vbGQtZm9ybWVyLWdhcmRlbmVyLXNoYXJlLTExLWJpbGxpb24tZm9ydHVuZS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The billionaire grandson of the founder of fashion giant Hermès is reportedly planning to adopt his 51-year-old gardener as part of an audacious and acrimonious succession plan.

In a plot reminiscent of the movie Annie with a highly unusual twist, 80-year-old Nicolas Puech is in the process of making his “former gardener and handyman” from a “modest Moroccan family” his legal child, Swiss publication Tribune de Genève reported last week.

The Frenchman, who is unmarried and childless, is a fifth-generation heir of Thierry Hermès, who founded the luxury fashion house in 1837 by opening a workshop in Paris.

The brand has since grown to a valuation of $220 billion and is now the third-largest publicly listed company in France.

Puech—who reportedly owns around 5% or 6% of the company—is worth between 9 billion and 10 billion Swiss francs (between $10.3 billion and $11.4 billion), according to Swiss outlet Bilan magazine, putting him among the richest people in Switzerland.

The billionaire is already in the process of passing on that wealth to his former gardener and has hired a legal team to take him through the process, Tribune de Genève reported. He is also reportedly in the process of rearranging the benefactors of his estate.

The gardener, whose identity is unknown, is reported to be married to a Spanish woman with whom he has two children. Tribune de Genève reports that he could inherit half of Puech’s wealth.

Italian outlet Sky TG24 reported that Puech had already handed the 51-year-old the keys to a property in Marrakesh, Morocco, and a villa in Montreux, Switzerland, worth a combined total of €5.5 million ($5.9 million).

A representative for Hermès didn’t reply to Fortune’s request for comment.

An unusual heir

Looking at Puech’s history with the company his grandfather founded, it becomes slightly clearer why he is looking to an unconventional subject to pass on his wealth.

In 2014 the Hermès heir quit the company’s supervisory board in acrimonious circumstances after fashion rival LVMH acquired 23% of Hermès as part of a hostile takeover bid, largely by stealth.

Puech’s other family members set up a holding company with their shares to block a takeover by LVMH, though Puech held on to his stake.

LVMH and founder Bernard Arnault later agreed to divest their shares in the company and agreed not to buy any more for five years. However, the feud appears to have caused unmendable wounds between Puech and his other family members.

“He resigned because he has felt for several years beleaguered by members of his family, who have attacked him on several fronts, not only regarding LVMH,” a spokesperson for Puech said at the time, Fashion Network reported via AFP.

“He has had some very bad experiences and felt very badly and felt harshly criticized on numerous occasions, even while he is very attached to Hermès.”

Great wealth transfer

Puech makes up a wider pool of billionaires planning to pass on $5.2 trillion of wealth in the coming decades as part of the great wealth transfer, according to a study by Swiss bank UBS.

Those billionaires typically split their wealth between their offspring and philanthropic causes, while many make arrangements to hand over control of their lucrative companies to family members.

Puech, though, appears to be the first to have thrown out that convention in favor of someone who seemingly made quite the impression on his life.

There are obstacles to Puech’s audacious plans to hand over his fortune to a former gardener via adoption. While not an anomaly, the adoption of an adult is extremely rare, and the requirements for doing so in Switzerland, where Puech resides, are complex.

An adult can adopt another adult if they lived with them for at least a year when the adoptee was still a minor, according to ch.ch.

The billionaire heir also has to overcome a philanthropic commitment. Puech is understood to have previously pledged his fortune as part of a succession pact to Isocrates, a foundation created by him in 2011 that is dedicated to tackling misinformation.

In order to walk back his pledge to Isocrates, Puech may face a brutal fight akin to that which he had with his family members a decade ago.

In a statement shared with Fortune, a representative for Isocrates said the foundation has opposed the cancellation of Puech’s contract.

“From a legal point of view, an abrupt and unilateral cancellation of the contract of inheritance seems void and unfounded,” the statement read.

The group said it was not its place to comment on Puech’s reported plans to adopt his gardener.

Sky TG24 reports that the adoption is seen as a legal workaround to stop the foundation from contesting parts of Puech’s will."
LVMH cedes control of Starboard; sells majority stake - GlobalCosmeticsNews,"Wed, 13 Dec 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmdsb2JhbGNvc21ldGljc25ld3MuY29tL2x2bWgtY2VkZXMtY29udHJvbC1vZi1zdGFyYm9hcmQtc2VsbHMtbWFqb3JpdHktc3Rha2Uv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"THE WHAT? LVMH has sold a majority stake in Cruise Line Holdings Co, owner of Miami-based Starboard, to a group of investors headed up by Jim Gissy. Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed.

THE DETAILS According to a report published by Reuters, the luxury conglomerate will retain a minority share. Starboard CEO, Lisa Bauer will remain in situ.

THE WHY? While LVMH does not provide a breakdown of its Selective Retail division by business, presumably, it is existing the cruise retail space in a bid to focus on more profitable brands. LVMH said in a statement, per Reuters, “The new investors are strategic partners in the vacation retail space with a culture of innovation and a growth mindset.”"
"""Average customer doesn't care terribly much about sustainability"" says LVMH US head - Dezeen","Thu, 14 Dec 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlemVlbi5jb20vMjAyMy8xMi8xNC9hbmlzaC1tZWx3YW5pLWludGVydmlldy1sdm1oLXVzLWhlYWQv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Louis Vitton, Dior and Tiffany & Co owner LVMH is aiming to become more sustainable – but not because customers are demanding it, explains the CEO of the luxury goods company's North America arm, Anish Melwani, in this exclusive interview.

""Sustainability is something we do not because we think our customers care – we do it because it is existential to our business, on top of being the right thing to do for society,"" Melwani told Dezeen.

""We know that today the average customer doesn't care terribly much about sustainability,"" he continued. ""They say they do, but when you actually get down to the brass tacks, we don't have people walking into our stores today and asking us, 'Hey, is this done sustainably?' – well, at least not many.""

Climate change an ""existential"" threat

The world's largest luxury conglomerate, Paris-based LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton (LVMH) owns 75 brands including many of the world's biggest names in the fashion, alcohol and watches and jewellery industries.

Melwani explained that although sustainability is not currently a driver for sales, he believes that attitudes are changing and that it will become a concern for a growing number customers of LVMH brands.

""We believe that over time, more and more of our customers, as generations progress, will care more about this – they will ask questions, be it in the stores or through online channels – they'll start demanding it,"" he said.

""And we think that'll be good for us. But we're going to do it anyway.""

LVMH is aiming to improve the sustainability of both its stores and supply chain, with fashion reportedly responsible for eight per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions.

According to Melwani, climate change poses an ""existential"" threat to LVMH, as many of the products created by its brands rely on natural materials. He cited the impact of the growing number of wildfires on its wine businesses.

""[We want to] future proof in many ways,"" said Melwani. ""It's future proofing from a customer perspective, but also future proofing from a practical perspective.""

""From a manufacturing perspective, we're vertically integrated,"" he continued. ""If we don't grow grapes in Champagne, we can't make any more Champagne. The French government is not about to expand the limits of the region of Champagne.""

""One of the challenges is that we are renters""

Melwani was speaking to Dezeen following the launch of a partnership between the company and Miami Design District that is aiming to reduce the environmental impact of its stores within the district, as part of an ongoing strategy to improve the sustainability of its 5,600 global stores.

The initiative will see its stores in Miami powered by solar by 2025. Melwani said that ""all the pieces [had] come together"" on the project, but that LVMH faces challenges at the majority of its stores, where the properties are rented.

""One of the challenges is that we are renters – we are tenants in most of our stores – we don't actually purchase our energy directly,"" he said. ""We've been purchasing green energy in the parts of the world where we own the building, and we are able to purchase right from utility.""

""We've been doing that for a while,"" he continued, ""But in the vast majority of our stores we are tenants and so it requires this coordination and commitment by the landlord, as well as frankly, having a utility provider that has the right programmes to make this all work.""

The company aims to start replicating the Miami partnership with its other landlords in the US and has begun similar initiatives in China and the Middle East.

Melwani added that sustainability was becoming part of the company's messaging, although its brands are not pushing the agenda on their customers.

""The first thing is we believe that attitudes will change over time, and secondly, much the way that we have beautiful art and design in our stores, it's an element of storytelling that becomes part of the brand,"" he explained.

""Some customers care about the art that they see and ask questions about it and we're able to talk about that – why is that particular art or that artist in that store?"" he continued.

""If people ask us about our sustainability methods, we will be able to tell them that this is what we do. But you know, luxury is kind of a fun retail experience. And no one wants to be lectured. No one finds a lecture to be fun.""

Earlier this month, British fashion designer Stella McCartney and LVMH presented a market of sustainable material innovations at climate conference COP28. The market showcased 15 innovators that provide plant-based alternatives to plastic, animal leather and fur, as well as regenerative alternatives to traditional fibres.

""The fashion industry accounts for eight per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions,"" McCartney said. ""We need to get creative and innovative with alternatives, moving beyond the limited materials that the industry has been working with traditionally.""

""If we can work collaboratively with these goals, we can actually begin doing business in a way that regenerates our planet instead of only taking from it.""

The heralded departure of Matthew M. Williams, who has been in charge of style at since 2020, has fuelled a fresh spate of wild rumours about his succession. And about the creative director positions at other labels. Is a new round of musical chairs on the cards at the French luxury giant? Other labels besides Givenchy might indeed find themselves with a new creative director in the coming months, among them.





Matthew M. Williams’s departure from Givenchy has unleashed a spate of speculations - © Launchmetrics



The first delicate task awaiting LVMH in early 2024 is to find a designer capable of rejuvenating a venerable house like Givenchy. According to analysts, the Parisian label has not yet climbed back to pre-Covid revenue levels. Since the end of the era, which lasted for 12 years, from 2006 to 2017, during which the label boosted its menswear and went big on streetwear, Givenchy has never managed to gain widespread popularity. The three-year interlude under the aegis of British designer Clare Waight-Keller, when Givenchy returned to a soft, ultra-feminine style, and the subsequent injection of streetwear administered for nearly four years by Williams, have merely succeeded in blurring the image of this historic house, renowned for its couture-chic heritage.



The question is whether LVMH Fashion Group CEO will opt for a celebrity designer, for the reassuring profile of an experienced stylist who has earned her or his stripes at another major label, or whether he will go for a trending name. The designer most frequently mentioned in conjunction with Givenchy is now . She brilliantly steered , a brand owned by rival , which she left in September after fourteen years. Above all, she has the stature and talent to rise to such a challenge.

Among French designers, why not , who has always been comfortable with a street couture aesthetic, and has a wealth of experience in luxury? According to some rumours, ’s creative director Julien Dossena might also be considered for the role. His name has been circulating ubiquitously for several months, every time a creative director position has opened. But it seems an unlikely possibility, and the same goes for the return of Riccardo Tisci, who was dismissed by in 2022. From London, thriving young designers like and could also stake a claim for the Givenchy role.



Not to mention the highly popular , whose name had already done the rounds a few months ago, specifically for Givenchy, and whose potential candidacy is now back in favour. LVMH is extremely interested in Porte Jacquemus’s flourishing ready-to-wear label, and could draw closer to the designer by offering him the Givenchy role. But Porte Jacquemus is keen to remain independent, and previous talks have apparently led nowhere.

The creative director slot now vacant at Givenchy might also prompt LVMH to make changes at some of its other labels. Notably at Fendi, where the experiment with Kim Jones has not been a triumph. Jones, who has successfully managed Homme for five years, and in 2020 also took charge of Fendi’s womenswear and haute couture collections, has failed to impress so far.



Finding a successor is a matter of urgency. , heiress of the Fendi family and the creative director of Fendi’s menswear and women’s accessories, having taken over for two seasons after ’s death, could be back in the running. She worked alongside Lagerfeld for 27 years, and her women’s collections, presented in September 2019 and February 2020, were highly appreciated. A representative of Fendi’s third generation, she is best placed to claim this role.





Alessandro Michele to return?





Nevertheless, in recent months, rumours have been rife about another name, that of , the iconic creative director who relaunched between 2015 and 2022. Exactly one year has passed since he was dismissed by Gucci and, from the end of November, Michele is no longer bound by a non-competition clause.



Between the end of 1990 and 2002, Michele worked in Fendi’s accessories department, alongside Lagerfeld and Silvia Venturini Fendi, just before joining Gucci. Several sources close to Fendi and Michele have confirmed that he and the Roman label might link up again. Others are saying he might join , another LVMH-owned brand, also based in Rome. Michele would like to stay in Italy’s capital, where he worked during his time at Gucci, even if at some point it also seemed he was heading for Givenchy.



Although, Paris could be the uber-creative designer’s new destination. Another rather surprising theory circulated last month. Michele could take the place of as creative director of Christian Dior's womenswear collections, while Chiuri could be dispatched to bolster Fendi. Nothing is suggesting that such a striking change could occur at Dior, whose success has continued unabated since 2016, when Chiuri took charge of style. The theory has not been confirmed by other sources.

Meanwhile, the creative directors of other LVMH labels could take advantage of the situation to explore new avenues. Jonathan Anderson, who has just won the coveted Designer of the Year award at the London Fashion Awards, is in charge of, besides his own label, Spanish label . Since Anderson took charge in 2013, Loewe, another LVMH-owned brand, has grown considerably, becoming a highly prized name. After 10 years, the Irish designer could legitimately aspire to a new, more prestigious position.



At , for example, the creative director post seems secure, but behind closed doors the situation could be less settled. took charge of menswear in February, while the contract of , who has been firmly at the helm of Vuitton’s women’s collections for 10 years, was renewed last month. However, there are whispers that the French designer is less than happy about the shadow cast by his new colleague. The US rap star has had no qualms about straying onto Ghesquière’s turf, unveiling women’s looks in his first show and choosing a woman, popular singer , to front his first ad campaign.



’s vast empire is constantly in search of fresh creative energy. Even some of its smaller, less directional labels are likely to pick household names as creative directors. since Flemish designer left menswear label in April 2021, after being at the helm for three years, following a decade overseeing Dior Homme, the label has been left with no one in charge of style. Similarly, thriving Italian label Loro Piana does not have a creative director. The name of , who used to spearhead , was floated in March, but Loro Piana blatantly denied it. Plenty of surprise twists are expected at LVMH in 2024.

LVMH is taking action to combat global warming right across its value chain (scope 3), by supporting ecosystem and soil preservation initiatives, to increase soil carbon storage capacity.







Continuing its partnership with UNESCO’s “Man and the Biosphere” (MAB) program, at COP 28 LVMH is launching a new project with the Foundation for Amazon Sustainability (FAS).







The aim of this new project is to combat deforestation, one of the main threats to ecosystems in the Amazon region. LVMH is investing one million euros in its partnership with FAS to balance environmental protection with sustainable development that respects local cultural contexts.







LVMH’s overall objective is to regenerate five million hectares of wildlife habitat worldwide and limit the environmental impact of its activities.







This project focuses on three main areas: biodiversity and ecosystem conservation, as LVMH is committed to developing a report on biodiversity in the Rio Negro region; Education and capacity building providing support for operating schools and educational materials focused on sustainable biodiversity management; and sustainable supply chains on the ground through a series of investments in production infrastructure in existing local supply chains and in distribution channels for local supply chains.







The Circular Bioeconomy Alliance’s results

LVMH’s partnership with the Circular Bioeconomy Alliance (CBA), formalized at COP 27 in 2022 in Egypt, brought a series of results, like, for instance, the start of a regenerative cotton agriculture and agroforestry program in the Lake Chad region, introducing sustainable and regenerative cotton production methods and promoting biodiversity as well as economic opportunities for the local population.







This project is part of the Great Green Wall project, which aims to curb desertification with a target of replanting 500,000 trees and regenerating 5,000 hectares by 2026.







Can new commercial property agreements help lower the impact?

While LVMH has supported Stella McCartney’s “Sustainable Market” pavilion during COP28, it also continues partnership programs with shopping centers to minimize the environmental impact of stores.







LVMH is committed to a strategy based on the science of decarbonizing its value chain. LVMH’s ambition is to reduce its scope 3 GHG (greenhouse gas) emissions per unit of added value by 55% by 2030 and by 50% of those related to energy consumption by 2026 (based on 2019).







Special attention is being paid to improving the energy footprint of its stores, which must showcase the group’s exemplary environmental credentials, especially as they represent scope 3 for commercial property owners around the world.







One of the highlights of this commitment in 2022 was the signature by LVMH of its first partnership with a leading shopping center owner in China, Hang Lung Properties. The first concrete results were rewarded at the 2023 Green Point Awards.







Two new partnerships with the UAE and Miami Design District

Following on from this agreement, the Group is launching two new partnerships with commercial landlords at COP 28.







The first partnership is between the top five local real estate developers in the United Arab Emirates. This new alliance between Chalhoub Group, EMAAR Malls Management (LLC), Majid Al Futtaim Properties LLC, Aldar Properties PJSC and LVMH demonstrates that some key players in selective distribution in the UAE share a commitment to sustainability.







Among the targets set for the shopping malls are ambitious and innovative environmental practices covering water consumption, air conditioning efficiency, the use of clean energy, and responsible design and construction practices.







The partnership was signed on Saturday, December 2, with Antoine Arnault (Image and Environment, LVMH), Patrick Chalhoub (CEO, Chalhoub Group), Mohamed Al Matrooshi (Head of Dubai Mall, EMAAR Malls Management (LLC), Ahmed El Shamy (CEO, Majid Al Futtaim Properties LLC), and Faisal Falaknaz (Finance and Sustainability Director, Aldar Properties PJSC).







LVMH will also sign an agreement with Miami Design District (MDD), the iconic neighborhood dedicated to innovative fashion, design, art, architecture and dining.







The partnership between the Group and MDD will involve the 15 LVMH Maisons that rent commercial premises in Miami Design District, namely Louis Vuitton, Dior, Fendi, Berluti, Tiffany & Co., Bulgari and Hublot.







The agreement focuses on tangible and measurable initiatives to achieve 100% renewable energy in these boutiques and involves a local developer and operator in solar energy. Other tenants of boutiques at MDD are encouraged to join this agreement.







“In keeping with the ambitious sustainability goals set by LVMH as part of our LIFE 360 roadmap, the LIFE in Stores initiative is key to optimizing our stores’ environmental performance and reducing their footprint,” said Antoine Arnault, Image & Environment, LVMH.







The group aims to improve the environmental performance of its over 5,600 store network worldwide and encourage other industry players to join them, according to Arnault.







Berluti discloses its first FSC-certified store

The group’s involvement in biodiversity commitment will see Berluti become the first luxury Maison to offer a store with “Full Project FSC certification,” with its Berluti store at the Mall of Emirates, owned by Majid al-Futtaim Properties.







“Thanks to its commitment, the LVMH Group is doing its bit to help conserve forests, through an innovative, brand-new project in the luxury sector. Ensuring the wood materials used in construction or development projects are responsibly sourced is essential to supporting the eco-responsible approach of managers of certified forests. At a time when forests are facing so many crises (climate change, biodiversity loss), they can also provide solutions. We will continue to support the LVMH Group and its Maisons in developing what we hope will be new, ever more ambitious projects,” said Aurélien Sautière, Executive Director, FSC France.

"China’s Wine Has Gotten Really, Really Good - Robb Report","Sun, 03 Dec 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vcm9iYnJlcG9ydC5jb20vZm9vZC1kcmluay93aW5lL2NoaW5hLWZpbmUtd2luZS1uZXctZXJhLTEyMzU0MzIwMTAv0gFOaHR0cHM6Ly9yb2JicmVwb3J0LmNvbS9mb29kLWRyaW5rL3dpbmUvY2hpbmEtZmluZS13aW5lLW5ldy1lcmEtMTIzNTQzMjAxMC9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"This story is from an installment of The Oeno Files, our weekly insider newsletter to the world of fine wine. Sign up here.

In the pursuit of learning as much as we can about wine so we can share that knowledge with others, we have been to every country in the world that produces it in any significant quantity. People are often surprised to discover that we have visited multiple wine regions and too many wineries to count in China, and their response to finding this out is often along the lines of, “Well the wine’s not very good, is it?” Considering China’s size (it has roughly the same land mass as the United States), varied climates, and the fact that wine has been made there for around 2,000 years, it’s hard to believe that anyone would just dismiss the entire country, but here we are.

One only need look at the outside investment in Chinese wine projects to realize that the $42 billion annual business of winemaking there should be taken seriously. There are almost 500 wineries scattered across 12 main regions, but the fact that Louis Vuitton-Moët Hennessy, Domaine Baron de Rothschild (D.B.R.) Lafite, and Penfolds are in on the action makes even the most hardened snob sit up and take notice. This is not to say that the wineries without international partners are not producing world-class wine, but the majority of those at the high end are selling within their own domestic market and are not even seeking global distribution.

The LVMH project Ao Yun, which translates to “flying above the clouds,” was the first of the three to come to market, with the release of the 2013 vintage. This boutique winery high in the foothills of the Himalayas within the Diqing Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture has 68 acres of vineyards tucked into bends in the Mekong River at soaring altitudes of 7,200 to 8,500 feet above sea level. Estate director and winemaker Maxence Dulou, a Bordeaux native, divided the vineyards into 314 blocks and 900 sub-blocks based on differences in soil type, terroir, drainage, and sun exposure. Plots are worked completely by hand, vinified separately, and then blended to create a sumptuous wine that would be described as a Bordeaux-style blend—except for a bit of Syrah in the mix. Dulou is as meticulous at the blending table as he is in the vineyard, and the result is a delectable wine that consistently earns high scores from critics. He describes his wine as having “freshness and ripeness in the nose and acidity and density in the mouth,” with “very ripe” tannins that “create a soft, gentle texture.” The U.S. is a small market for Ao Yun, with only 10 percent of its output exported here, but bottles are relatively easy to come by. Half of the wine is sold in China, with another 20 percent shipped throughout Asia.

WATCH

The Long Dai winery is known as Chinese Lafite. Long Dai

Much farther northeast and only slightly closer to sea level, D.B.R. Lafite planted its terraced vineyards in Shandong Province in 2008. The first vintage of Long Dai, which is known in China simply as the Chinese Lafite, is the 2017; it was released in 2019. Technical director Olivier Tregoat (who holds the same role at Château L’Évangile in Pomerol and at Château Rieussec in Sauternes), tells us, “The priority of the Domaine de Long Dai is to learn from the terroir and develop expertise in soils and grape varieties, led by a strong local team, in order to find the best expression of this Shandong terroir and create a unique Chinese wine with a French touch.” Long Dai is not a typical Bordeaux blend; it is made with 50 percent Cabernet Sauvignon and 25 percent Cabernet Franc along with 25 percent Marselan, a cross between Grenache and Cabernet Sauvignon that is widely grown in China. Marselan contributes touches of baking spice and floral notes to the wine’s dark-berry flavors and polished tannins. Even though we were told by a spokesperson for the importer that it “is predominantly sold in mainland China with a strong distribution among wine collectors and wine lovers,” it’s possible to find Long Dai online at a handful of reliable retailers at prices close to its suggested $699 retail price.

The other project that we took note of is Penfolds, which released its Penfolds 2021 Chinese Winemaking Trial 521 Cabernet Sauvignon Marselan, or Penfolds CWT 521 for short, this past summer. The numerals 5-2-1 refer to five regions from which the grapes are sourced and the vintage year of the wine. “CWT represents an expression of Penfolds house style through a Chinese lens,” Penfolds winemaker Matt Woo says. “The wine speaks to both Penfolds varietal characters and is expressive of regions from which it was sourced.”

Unless you’re traveling to China or Australia, it will be hard to get your hands on a bottle of Penfolds CWT 51. As for the other Chinese wines we’ve mentioned, they are drinking well now and will continue to age beautifully at home for at least 10 more years. That said, they have not reached the status of investment wine. “While we have seen some top Chinese wineries come to the sales room at auction, this has been relatively rare,” Nick Pegna, Sotheby’s global head of wine and spirits tells us. “Underpinning this is the fact that most of these wineries are relatively young, so we are not seeing substantial increase in values yet. While there is a following for the new releases for Long Dai and especially for Ao Yun and the quality level is excellent, they have not yet become seen as collectable.” That’s okay with us, because as we’ve mentioned before, wine is for drinking, not squirreling away to sell at a profit.

Champs-Élysées is a luxury address LVMH cannot do without - The Times,"Fri, 08 Dec 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXRpbWVzLmNvLnVrL2FydGljbGUvY2hhbXBzLWVseXNlZXMtaXMtYS1sdXh1cnktYWRkcmVzcy1sdm1oLWNhbm5vdC1kby13aXRob3V0LWdyY2YwcW5idtIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Selling the world’s most expensive and desirable goods can be anything but a luxury these days, as the sector struggles amid global economic worries and cost of living pressures, but that hasn’t stopped LVMH splashing out nearly €1 billion on another block on the Champs-Élysées.

Commercial property agents in Paris said Bernard Arnault’s luxury goods conglomerate had paid about €950 million for 150 Avenue de Champs-Élysées, a record price for a building located on the “the most beautiful avenue in the whole world”.

LVMH has bought the site from Brookfield, the Canadian private equity firm, which will have made a healthy profit on the sale after buying it only 18 months ago for what is thought to have been €750 million.

The deal for the building, 100 metres from the Arc de Triomphe, appears to have been struck last Friday, according to CFNews Immo, a French property website. Agents said LVMH — which boasts a stable of luxury brands that include Louis Vuitton, Moët Hennessy, Tiffany & Co., Christian Dior and Givenchy — had been prepared to pay such a high price because of rumours that Kering, a rival, was also pursuing a deal."
LVMH Life 360 Summit Act II: a new milestone in the Group's environmental policy - Luxus Plus,"Fri, 15 Dec 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vbHV4dXMtcGx1cy5jb20vZW4vbHZtaC1saWZlLTM2MC1zdW1taXQtYWN0LWlpLWEtbmV3LW1pbGVzdG9uZS1pbi10aGUtZ3JvdXBzLWVudmlyb25tZW50YWwtcG9saWN5L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"On December 14, the LVMH Group celebrated a first milestone in its Life 360 program at UNESCO headquarters. This was an opportunity for the world’s number one luxury brand to review its performance in terms of the circular economy, biodiversity protection, carbon emissions reduction, traceability and transparency. But also to unveil an unprecedented support program for its suppliers.

On December 14, LVMH brought together over 500 executives – including some of its competitors – and key partners.This first LVMH Life360 Summit was an opportunity for one of French luxury’s best ambassadors in the world to present its various environmental initiatives to date.

Since 2021, the Life360 program (LVMH Initiative For Environment) has served as a compass for the luxury group’s environmental efforts, with a clear roadmap, a quantified target and announced deadlines.

The group is committed to keeping its stakeholders informed of the progress of its ecological transition every 3 years. After 2023, the next deadlines – 2026 and 2030 – are already known. More than “paper promises”, the Group is delighted with the commitments it has kept, which have enabled it to meet the various challenges scheduled for 2023 with flying colors.

LVMH is now embarking on a far more complex stage: taking action on its scope 3 (external to its own energy expenditure), with the aim of having, in particular, 100% of the group’s employees trained in sustainable development by 2026.

The exceptional presence of Christophe Béchu, the French Minister for Ecological Transition and Territorial Cohesion, Virginijus Sinkevičius, the European Commissioner for the Environment, Oceans and Fisheries, and Hollywood actress Natalie Portman, alongside Bernard Arnault, Chairman and CEO of LVMH, and Antoine Arnault, LVMH’s Head of Image & Environment, attested to the seriousness of the Group’s commitment.

Having chosen the headquarters of UNESCO (United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization) as the venue for the day, the group announced the renewal of their partnership in the fight against deforestation. The two entities share the same values, those of “protecting and promoting living heritage, whether cultural, social or environmental”, as Bernard Arnault, the Group’s Chairman, reminded us.

Horizon 2023: promises kept

“Transparency and pragmatism” are LVMH’s watchwords when it comes to the environment. As Antoine Arnault reminded the press conference, “we prefer to under promise and over deliver, rather than the other way around.”

The first French group to take environmental protection into account since the close of the Rio Earth Summit in 1992, the LVMH group was keen to explain the challenges it has taken up in its Life 360 program.

Launched in 2021, the program is built on four pillars: circular economy, protection of biodiversity, reduction of carbon emissions, traceability and transparency.

In terms of creative circularity, LVMH has achieved its 2023 objective of offering new circular services, bolstered by the creation of a repair and care task force in several of the Group’s Houses.

Louis Vuitton repairs 600,000 products a year, while 79% of Berluti’s leather goods are now repairable, and Rimowa guarantees its luggage for life.

At the Life 360 Summit, the group announced the creation of LVMH Circularity, an ecosystem that brings together all the expertise of the group and its partners in the field of reuse (Nona Source, the CEDRE platform, weturn, the Agence du Don en Nature). Alongside them, LVMH is also committed to recycling fabric and leather scraps, unused raw materials and unsold products.

At the closing plenary session, the group demonstrated that it was possible to produce a fashion show using 90% recycled materials, a first in the luxury goods industry. Entitled Prélude, the entirely upcycled collection was created by Artistic Director Kevin Germanier using unsold products from leading fashion houses and fabric scraps from Nona Source (a platform created thanks to an international LVMH intrapreneurship program) and Weturn (a start-up that won an LVMH Innovation Award last year).

The Group is also continuing its drive to preserve biodiversity. After contributing to the regeneration of 1.37 million hectares by the end of 2022, LVMH is now aiming for the target of 5 million by the end of 2030. This ambition is made possible by the launch of various regenerative agriculture programs, notably in Turkey (cotton), Australia (merino wool), South Africa (mohair), Indonesia (palm oil) and France (Moët Hennessy vineyards).

Complementing its initiatives already sealed with Reforest’Action (reforestation actions) and the Circular Biodiversity Alliance (sustainable cotton production), the group announced a strategic partnership with the Brazilian NGO FAS (fight against deforestation) as well as the renewal of its partnership with UNESCO’s “Man & Biosphere” program, in favor of biosphere reserves.

In line with these actions, the Group has set up a water sobriety plan to reduce its overall water consumption footprint by 30% by 2030.

Hermès created Europe's biggest family fortune after spurning 'revolting' LVMH - The Australian Financial Review,"Wed, 27 Dec 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5hZnIuY29tL2NvbXBhbmllcy9tYW51ZmFjdHVyaW5nL2hlcm0tcy1jcmVhdGVkLWV1cm9wZS1zLWJpZ2dlc3QtZmFtaWx5LWZvcnR1bmUtYWZ0ZXItc3B1cm5pbmctcmV2b2x0aW5nLWx2bWgtMjAyMzEyMjctcDVldHYy0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Hermès is “in a league of their own”, Thomas Chauvet, an analyst at Citigroup, said after its strong third-quarter growth, including in China. A focus on craftsmanship, a finely calibrated perception of exclusivity and a mastery of scarcity – real or managed – have converged into a winning strategy.

“We are proud of our model, but remain modest; it’s the result of the commitment and talent of our teams across the world,” executive chairman Axel Dumas, 53, a sixth-generation scion, says in an emailed response to a request for an interview. He declines to say more.

Hermès is by far the luxury sector’s best performer in 2023, with a 35 per cent gain in its shares, compared with a 5.3 per cent rise for LVMH and a 15 per cent slump at Gucci-owner Kering.

Most industry analysts still rate Hermès a “buy”, “hold” or “neutral”. But with the stock trading at a multiple more than double that of its peers, the market slump may eventually catch up with it, says Jelena Sokolova, an analyst at Morningstar. “I wouldn’t say that deceleration is completely unthinkable for Hermès,” she says.

Morningstar has one of the few “sell” ratings on the stock because it’s considered expensive relative to future earnings.

Hermès seems unperturbed by a potential slowdown, and is determined to keep to the family’s well-trodden path.

“During tough financial times, there’s a flight to quality,” Dumas told analysts in July when asked how Hermès had managed to clock up a 20.5 per cent jump in sales in the second quarter in the Americas when rivals took hits. Its performance was similar in the most recent period.

The crown jewel of the €362 billion global personal luxury goods industry, Hermès has thrived in large part due to its controlling family’s penchant for doing things in quaint ways that hark back to its nearly two-century heritage. Its top leather bags, which can go for anywhere from $US8000 to well in the tens of thousands of dollars for a model with exotic skin such as crocodile, are all handmade in ateliers dotting France.

Also, unlike competitors, the maison eschews the bling of famous models and social media influencers, like Kendall Jenner at Gucci or actress Kristen Stewart for Chanel. When stars wear creations from Christian Dior or Balenciaga at red carpet events, the brands are quick to publicise it. Not Hermès.

In a world of celebrity excess, Hermès’ advertising is conspicuously free of recognisable faces – something that’s spared them the turmoil when such personalities fall out of favour. Yet customers have been known to wait months – and sometimes years – for its Birkin and Kelly bags, which are nevertheless named after famous actresses.

“We don’t look too much at the competition because we might be influenced,” Dumas quipped during the July results presentation. When he listed the firm’s four core values, “independence” came first.

Created in 1837 by harness-maker Thierry Hermès – a Protestant in mostly Catholic France – the company has always been independent, run for the most part by family members. Known across Europe from its early days for the exquisite craftsmanship of its creations, Hermès was passed down from son to son as it expanded from harnesses to saddles and other leather goods, sumptuous silk scarves and watches.

In 1951, Robert Dumas, a son-in-law of the third-generation Émile Hermès, who only had daughters, took the helm. He is credited with many of the company’s successes, including the Kelly bag - created almost 100 years ago, but made famous after Grace Kelly was shown carrying it in a photo on the cover of Life magazine.

Robert’s son, Jean-Louis Dumas, followed him in 1978, and was the creator of the Birkin bag, inspired by the late British actress and singer Jane Birkin, who sat next to him on a flight and complained that she couldn’t find a handbag she liked. By then the company’s horse-drawn-carriage logo and signature orange boxes had become emblems of high fashion and class.

At the onset of the battle with Arnault, the Dumas, Guerrand and Puech branches of the family – descended from the daughters of Émile – held about 73 per cent of the company.

As a a limited joint stock partnership that gives a shareholder with even a relatively small stake huge sway, Hermès was already well protected against predators. But LVMH had managed to stealthily accumulate about 23 per cent of the company’s shares. LVMH, which now owns just under 2 per cent of Hermès, declined to comment on the episode.

When LVMH CEO Bernard Arnault amassed Hermès shares in 2010, the heirs to the brand banded together to fight off any chance of a takeover. Getty

Just weeks after Arnault’s phone call, about 50 Hermès descendants got together and unanimously agreed on the creation of an even tighter ring-fence. To protect against heirs who might be tempted to sell their stake to a potential raider, they created a holding structure that now has around 54.3 per cent of Hermes’ shares and the right of first refusal to buy from an additional block of shares that family members own.

That fortification put in place over a decade ago is still led by Julie Guerrand, the sixth-generation director who abandoned a banking career at Rothschild & Co in 2011 to help mount the defence against Arnault.

At the end of 2022, the clan owned nearly 67 per cent of Hermès, according to its annual report. Their grasp appears ironclad and the company’s lofty market capitalisation – nearly twice that of plane maker Airbus, a symbol of European engineering prowess – makes a hostile takeover remote.

“The Hermès family is a fantastic case study in the potential pitfalls of succession,” says Irina Curbelo, co-founder of family business consultant Percheron Advisory. “They were lucky to have been able to come together; many don’t.”

While the Hermès descendants came out on the winning side, the lessons learned from the fight continue to reverberate. Late last year, the heirs took a further step to unify their swelling fortunes by bringing together eight family offices and investment vehicles from various branches into a single entity called Krefeld Invest; it is charged with investing the personal wealth of its constituents.

The family declined to provide any information about the strategy of Krefeld. But a company representative commenting on calculations of the clan’s wealth says the constraints on the family’s ability to sell shares means any estimate of its fortune needs to factor in a discount of about 30 per cent.

The fight with Arnault also jump-started the grooming of the next generation to run the company, with the executive committee now counting three heirs. Faced with an intruder, the clan was quick to join forces, but family members have sometimes clashed over what they have seen as the dominance of some.

With the two top jobs at the company – executive chairman and chief creative director – going to the Dumas branch, there have been jealousies at times from the other two branches, a person familiar with the matter says. In a bid to fend off criticism, Pierre-Alexis Dumas at first shared the artistic director role with cousin Pascale Mussard from the Guerrand lineage before she was edged out, according to the person.

But the group’s success and its generous dividends – €852 million in 2022 – have largely kept the family united. Under Axel Dumas, the nephew of Jean-Louis who’s been at the helm for a decade, sales have tripled and the share price has risen seven-fold.

A former banker who has said he reluctantly joined the company, Dumas has cemented Hermès’ reach abroad. In 2022, the company opened a new Maison Hermès on Madison Avenue in New York.

Dumas has stuck close to the company’s heritage of quiet luxury rooted in artisanship rather than logos and monograms plastered all over products – like Louis Vuitton or Chanel. The only logo on most of the company’s handbags is a discreet “Hermès Paris” on the clasp.

While Louis Vuitton has signed music superstar Pharrell Williams as a menswear designer, the creators of Hermès products tend not to be household names, and many of them have been at the luxury house for decades – Véronique Nichanian has been its menswear designer for 35 years.

“Others have been dependent on changes of CEOs, designers; in the case of Hermès, its signature on products, communications and people has always been consistent,” says Stefania Saviolo, a lecturer in fashion and luxury management at Bocconi University in Milan.

The company stubbornly indulges in practices that sometimes raise eyebrows. In a nod to its origins, last spring the main window display of Hermès’ flagship store on Paris’ fashionable rue du Faubourg Saint-Honoré included some horse dung. It wasn’t just any manure, Dumas told an audience at the equestrian competition Saut Hermès. It came from horses in la Garde Républicaine, an elite unit of mounted police officers who often protect dignitaries at official ceremonies.

The eccentricities don’t end there. The company’s earnings presentations are in French, an oddity in the world of high finance and at big companies, where English dominates – that’s even though Dumas, who attended an executive program at Harvard University, speaks English.

Attempting to perpetuate the myth of the company’s above-the-fray ways, Dumas told business school students in 2019 that Hermès doesn’t “do marketing”. Never mind that the company, like others in the industry, advertises and promotes products. Profitability could be vastly increased if changes were made in the way the company was run, but that’s not the Hermès way, Dumas said.

During the fight against Arnault, the family warned that if Hermès were part of LVMH, pressure for profits would undermine the craftsmanship and traditions that have defined the brand. Over the years, Arnault has changed the face of Louis Vuitton, bringing in the likes of Marc Jacobs, a young designer who updated the products with quirky designs, and pushing to produce more as demand soared.

At Hermès, each bag is still made by a single artisan who can spend up to 20 hours on one Kelly model, folding and sewing together pieces of calf or crocodile skin. People familiar with the firm say the clan’s Protestant culture permeates the strategy, infusing a sense of individual responsibility for, say, a bag that will make the artisan proud.

Unlike many rivals, Hermès regularly updates investors on its manufacturing capacity. Its stated goal is to boost the output of its leather goods by about 7 per cent a year – with the opening of one plant a year in France. That’s even though demand has created a backlog of orders for some sought-after purses that far outstrip this increase.

The company’s ability to boost production is capped by the need for the right skills and savoir-faire, Dumas said during the opening of an atelier in the town of Louviers in Normandy, in north-western France, in April.

“Training takes time,” he said. “Our best artisans become trainers, so they’re no longer in production.” That’s why one opening a year is “optimal to not disrupt what we do while still growing.”

The group doesn’t reveal how many bags or scarves it makes each year, and shortages haven’t prompted it to hike prices as much as it could. That in turn has spawned a juicy resale market for Birkin, Kelly and Constance models, consistently drawing rich mark-ups.

“Clients will pay a premium for these pieces as the handbags stand the test of time,” says Rachel Koffsky, the international head of handbags and accessories at the auction house Christie’s. “These pieces are considered classic, not trendy,” and have become “investment-worthy”.

Two years ago, a Hermès bag broke a record at auction to become the most expensive handbag ever sold. The hammer came down at more than $US500,000 for a diamond-encrusted Himalaya Kelly, a crocodile-skin handbag in mother-of-pearl white. At a Christie’s bag auction last month, 60 per cent of the lots were sold above the highest estimates, with the auction house singling out the performance of Hermès, a sign of the brand’s following.

On a recent afternoon in front of the company’s flagship boutique in Paris, Kiki Liu described herself as a loyal customer, one who over the past decade has bought a number of Hermès bags, including Birkin and Kelly models. The Chicago resident on a family vacation was pleased about landing an appointment with a Hermès sales person to inquire about a purse.

“I have many different bags from various brands but I feel like the Hermès ones keep their value and are timeless,” Liu said, as she left the store with her children. “They’re a good investment and I feel like I can pass them on to my girls.”

A t this year’s holiday soirées luxury bosses may be stingier than usual with the champagne. It has not been a sparkling six months for the industry, as well-heeled consumers from East to West have tempered the excesses of recent years. The S & P global luxury index, which tracks the industry’s performance, is down by 9% since the middle of the year. Still, the purveyors of splendour need not forgo the merrymaking altogether. The global market for personal luxury goods, from handbags to haute couture and horology, grew by 4% this year, reckons Bain, a consultancy. That is disappointing compared with 20% last year—but nothing to scoff at amid fears of a slowing global economy.

The past two decades have been remarkable for the industry. Global sales have tripled to nearly $400bn, thanks largely to a swelling of the ranks of crazy rich Asians. The biggest beneficiaries of the boom have been European companies. These account for around two-thirds of luxury-goods sales, according to Deloitte, another consultancy, and nine of the world’s ten most valuable luxury brands, according to Kantar, a market-research firm. Bernard Arnault of LVMH , a European luxury goliath, is the world’s second-richest man. The industry remains a rare bright spot for Europe at a time when the continent seems at risk of fading into economic and technological irrelevance. Why has it been so immune to foreign competition?

Heritage is one explanation. Europe’s luxury firms have ridden high on the world’s continuing fascination with the old continent. It is home to seven of the ten most visited countries in the world. Tourists flock to Europe’s historic cities to ogle its artworks, taste its local delicacies and drink its fine wines; the rich and famous gather in the summer for lavish parties on the Riviera. In his book, “Selling Europe to the World”, Pierre Yves Donzé, a business historian, argues that the ascendancy of European luxury is thanks to “the powerful attraction of an idealised way of life, combining elegance, tradition and hedonism”.

In an interview with the New York Times in 1996 Tom Ford, a famed American designer, gushed that Europeans, unlike his compatriots, “appreciate style”. American fashion labels have struggled to break into the most exclusive end of the industry. Even America’s pricier brands like Ralph Lauren concentrate on what insiders contemptuously call “accessible luxury”. In Asia home-grown rivals have thrived mostly in categories like jewellery (China’s Chow Tai Fook or India’s Titan) and cosmetics (Japan’s Shiseido) where local tastes are more pronounced.

Europe, meanwhile, has entrenched itself as the centre of design and craftsmanship in the luxury business. Three of the “big four” fashion weeks take place in European capitals. New York, the exception, has valiantly tried to build a cluster of high-end fashion talent, with design schools to rival those of Milan or Paris. Yet it has lost top designers to European capitals much as Europe has lost techies to Silicon Valley. As Mr Ford saw it, “If I was ever going to become a good designer, I had to leave America.”

Hobnobbing with other fashionistas is not the only advantage on offer in Europe. The continent is dotted with artisanal workshops that have for decades catered to the exacting standards of the luxury industry. Hermès handbags, some of which sell for upwards of $10,000, are produced by experienced craftsmen who can spend 20 hours or more on one bag. Over decades the continent has developed specialised clusters of production, from watchmaking in the Jura Arc of Switzerland to shoemaking in the Veneto region of Italy, where techniques are handed down over generations through specialist schools and coveted apprenticeships.

Europe’s luxury champions deserve credit, too, for pursuing strategies that have reinforced their dominance of the industry. They have been steadily buying stakes in their suppliers, giving them a competitive edge through greater control of production, notes Thomai Serdari of New York University’s Stern Business School. In May Chanel and Brunello Cucinelli, two luxury houses, bought a joint 49% stake in Cariaggi Lanificio, an Italian cashmere supplier. Vertical integration in the industry has stretched all the way back to alligator farms in Louisiana and sheep stations in Australia. It has also extended in the other direction, into distribution, with luxury firms increasingly opting to sell directly to shoppers through their own swanky stores, rather than entrusting the customer experience to others.

All that has required plenty of capital, which helps explain the parallel trend towards horizontal integration in the industry. LVMH now houses 75 luxury brands. Although these mostly operate autonomously, the model provides economies of scale in areas like marketing and back-office functions. It also gives the group the financial firepower to invest in prime real estate. In July LVMH bought the building on the Champs Elysées that houses its Louis Vuitton flagship store. Swatch, which owns watch brands from Blancpain to Omega, controls a portfolio of component suppliers, too. The conglomerate model also helps to lure in top talent by offering opportunities for designers and craftsmen to move between brands, notes Stefania Saviolo of Bocconi University.

Continental drift

Enthusiasm for horizontal integration among European luxury firms has not been universal. Early in the 2010s Hermès fended off a takeover attempt by LVMH. It has done just fine on its own—its shares have outperformed LVMH ’s by more than half over the past five years. Other independent luxury brands, however, have struggled to keep up. That is especially so for Italian firms, which account for 23% of luxury’s 100 largest businesses but only 8% of their combined sales, according to Deloitte. Many of these are multigenerational family businesses that have balked at joining forces with old rivals. If they are to maintain their position at the ritziest end of luxury, they may need to swallow their pride. ■

In a statement obtained by TRBusiness, LVMH confirms it has concluded a transaction to sell a majority position in Cruise Line Holdings Co. to a group of four investors spearheaded by Florida-based businessman Jim Gissy.

It describes the four investors as ‘strategic partners in the vacation retail space with a culture of innovation and a growth mindset’.

The transaction is expected to conclude in the coming days subject to customary conditions.

“LVMH will continue as an important minority shareholder in this new company,” it continued.

Land-based vacation retail opportunities

No financial terms for the transaction have been disclosed.

Starboard Cruise Services President and CEO Lisa Bauer will helm the new company alongside her executive team and will be tasked with accelerating strong post-Covid business momentum while developing new cruise retail opportunities in addition to land-based vacation retail.

Chris de Lapuente, Chairman and CEO of the Selective Retailing Division of LVMH, said: “We are very pleased with this strategic alliance that will enable Starboard and Onboard to further develop their activities and accelerate our strong post-Covid momentum.” Bauer added: “We are so energised with the new opportunities that will open up to us. The entire leadership team is focused on taking the tremendous progress we have made and directing that toward continuing success in 2024 and beyond.”

A statement issued yesterday via Starboard Cruise Services’ and Onboard Media’s LinkedIn accounts confirmed that Bauer will also serve on the board of Global Travel Retail Holdings.

Board Chair Gissy, Vice President of Orlando-headquartered timeshare and resort developer Westgate Resorts, is joined by Board Vice Chair Marcia Rowley and her husband John Rowley, the family office of Central Florida-based billionaire David Siegel, and Hannaford Investments, LLC, co-owned by Michael and Crisa Marder.

“I’ve known and worked with Jim, Marcia, John, and David for nearly 20 years,” said Bauer in the LinkedIn statement.

“Having worked alongside them driving profitable growth and excellent customer experience, I knew they were the perfect partners to help take Onboard Media and Starboard forward.

“Our entire company is excited for this next phase of expansion. We have been very fortunate to be a Maison within the LVMH Group since 2000, and we are appreciative of LVMH’s continued and important participation in the venture going forward.”

How Hermes became Europe’s biggest family fortune after spurning LVMH’s ‘wolf in cashmere’ - Sydney Morning Herald,"Mon, 25 Dec 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5zbWguY29tLmF1L2J1c2luZXNzL2NvbXBhbmllcy9ob3ctaGVybWVzLWJlY2FtZS1ldXJvcGUtcy1iaWdnZXN0LWZhbWlseS1mb3J0dW5lLWFmdGVyLXNwdXJuaW5nLWx2bWgtcy13b2xmLWluLWNhc2htZXJlLTIwMjMxMjA4LXA1ZXE1aC5odG1s0gGXAWh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLnNtaC5jb20uYXUvYnVzaW5lc3MvY29tcGFuaWVzL2hvdy1oZXJtZXMtYmVjYW1lLWV1cm9wZS1zLWJpZ2dlc3QtZmFtaWx5LWZvcnR1bmUtYWZ0ZXItc3B1cm5pbmctbHZtaC1zLXdvbGYtaW4tY2FzaG1lcmUtMjAyMzEyMDgtcDVlcTVoLmh0bWw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"But Hermes — which can’t keep up with demand for some of its coveted handbags — has been largely spared so far. Its revenue has been growing in the double digits, unlike LVMH, where it has slowed to single digits. Hermes is “in a league of their own”, Thomas Chauvet, an analyst at Citigroup, said after its strong third-quarter growth, including in China. A focus on craftsmanship, a finely calibrated perception of exclusivity and a mastery of scarcity — real or managed — have converged into a winning strategy for Hermes. “We are proud of our model, but remain modest”: Hermes executive chairman Axel Dumas. Credit: Antoine Doyen “We are proud of our model, but remain modest; it’s the result of the commitment and talent of our teams across the world,” executive chairman Axel Dumas, 53, a sixth-generation scion, said in an emailed response to a request for an interview. He declined to say more. Hermes is by far the luxury sector’s best performer this year, with a 35 per cent gain in its shares, compared with a 5.3 per cent rise for LVMH and a 15 per cent slump at Gucci-owner Kering. Most industry analysts still rate Hermes a “buy”, “hold” or “neutral”. But with the stock trading at a multiple more than double that of its peers, the market slump may eventually catch up with it, said Jelena Sokolova, an analyst at Morningstar. “I wouldn’t say that deceleration is completely unthinkable for Hermes,” she said. Morningstar has one of the few “sell” ratings on the stock because it’s considered expensive relative to future earnings. Hermes seems unperturbed by a potential slowdown, and is determined to keep to the family’s well-trodden path.

“During tough financial times, there’s a flight to quality,” Dumas told analysts in July when asked how Hermds had managed to clock in a 20.5 per cent jump in sales in the second quarter in the Americas when rivals took hits. Its performance was similar in the most recent period. The crown jewel of the €362 billion global personal luxury goods industry, Hermes has thrived in large part due to its controlling family’s penchant for doing things in quaint ways that hark back to its nearly two-century-old heritage. Its top leather bags, which can go for anywhere between about $US8000 to well in the tens of thousands of dollars for a model with exotic skin like crocodile, are all handmade in ateliers dotting France. Hermes has thrived in large part due to its controlling family’s penchant for doing things in quaint ways that hark back to its nearly two-century-old heritage. Also, unlike competitors, the maison eschews the bling of famous models and social media influencers, like Kendall Jenner at Gucci or actress Kristen Stewart for Chanel. When stars wear creations from Christian Dior or Balenciaga at red carpet events, the brands are quick to publicise it. Not Hermes. In a world of celebrity excess, Hermes’ advertising is conspicuously free of recognisable faces — something that’s spared them the turmoil when such personalities fall out of favour. Yet customers have been known to wait months — and sometimes years — for its Birkin and Kelly bags, which are nevertheless named after famous actresses. “We don’t look too much at the competition because we might be influenced,” Dumas quipped during the July results presentation. When he listed the firm’s four core values, “independence” came first.

Created in 1837 by harness-maker Thierry Hermes — a Protestant in mostly Catholic France — the company has always been independent, run for the most part by family members. Known across Europe from its very early days for the exquisite craftsmanship of its creations, Hermès was passed down from son to son as it expanded from harnesses to saddles and other leather goods, sumptuous silk scarves and watches. In 1951, Robert Dumas, a son-in-law of the third-generation Émile Hermès — who only had daughters — took the helm, and is credited with many of the company’s successes, including the Kelly bag — created almost 100 years ago, but made famous after Grace Kelly was shown carrying it in a photo on the cover of Life magazine. Robert’s son, Jean-Louis Dumas, followed him in 1978, and was the creator of the Birkin bag, inspired by the late British actress and singer Jane Birkin, who sat next to him on a flight and complained that she couldn’t find a handbag she liked. By then the company’s horse-drawn-carriage logo and signature orange boxes had become emblems of high fashion and class. Shares in Bernard Arnault’s LVMH have been slumping as the luxury secotr faces headwinds. Credit: Bloomberg At the onset of the battle with Arnault, the Dumas, Guerrand and Puech branches of the family — descended from the daughters of Emile — held about 73 per cent of the company. As a Société en Commandite par Actions, or SCA — a limited joint stock partnership that gives a shareholder with even a relatively small stake huge sway — Hermes was already well protected against predators. But LVMH had managed to stealthily accumulate about 23 per cent of the company’s shares. LVMH, which now owns just under 2 per cent of Hermes, declined to comment on the episode. Just weeks after Arnault’s phone call, about 50 Hermes descendants got together and unanimously agreed on the creation of an even tighter ring-fence. To protect against heirs who might be tempted to sell their stake to a potential raider, they created a holding structure that now has around 54.3 per cent of Hermes’ shares and the right of first refusal to buy from an additional block of shares that family members own.

That fortification put in place over a decade ago is still led by Julie Guerrand, the sixth-generation director who abandoned a banking career at Rothschild & Co in 2011 to help mount the defence against Arnault. At the end of 2022, the clan owned nearly 67 per cent of Hermes, according to its annual report. Their grasp appears ironclad and the company’s lofty market capitalisation — nearly twice that of plane maker Airbus, a symbol of European engineering prowess — makes a hostile takeover remote. “The Hermes family is a fantastic case study in the potential pitfalls of succession,” said Irina Curbelo, co-founder of family business consultant Percheron Advisory. “They were lucky to have been able to come together; many don’t.” Loading While the Hermes descendants came out on the winning side, the lessons learned from the fight continue to reverberate. Late last year, the heirs took a further step to unify their swelling fortunes by bringing together eight family offices and investment vehicles from various branches into a single entity called Krefeld Invest. Named for the village in western Germany where founder Thierry Hermes was born, it is charged with investing the personal wealth of its constituents. The family declined to provide any information about the strategy of Krefeld. But a company representative commenting on Bloomberg calculations of the clan’s wealth said the constraints on the family’s ability to sell shares means any estimate of its fortune needs to factor in a discount of about 30 per cent.

The fight with Arnault also jump-started the grooming of the next generation to run the company, with the executive committee now counting three heirs. Faced with an intruder, the clan was quick to join forces, but family members have sometimes clashed over what they have seen as the dominance of some. With the two top jobs at the company — that of the executive chairman and the chief creative director — both going to the Dumas branch, there have been jealousies at times from the other two branches, a person familiar with the matter said. In a bid to fend off criticism, Pierre-Alexis Dumas at first shared the artistic director role with cousin Pascale Mussard from the Guerrand lineage before she was edged out, according to the person. The Hermes Kelly bag. Credit: But the group’s success and its generous dividends — €852 million in 2022 — have largely kept the family united. Under Axel Dumas, the nephew of Jean-Louis who’s been at the helm for a decade, sales have tripled and the share price has risen seven-fold. A former banker who has said he reluctantly joined the company, Dumas has cemented Hermes’ reach abroad — last year, the company opened a new Maison Hermes on Madison Avenue in New York. Dumas has stuck close to the company’s heritage of quiet luxury rooted in artisanship rather than logos and monograms plastered all over products — like Louis Vuitton or Chanel. The only logo on most of the company’s handbags is a discreet “Hermes Paris” on the clasp. While Louis Vuitton has signed music superstar Pharrell Williams as a menswear designer, the creators of Hermes products tend not to be household names, and many of them have been at the luxury house for decades — Veronique Nichanian has been its menswear designer for 35 years.

“Others have been dependent on changes of CEOs, designers; in the case of Hermes, its signature on products, communications and people has always been consistent,” said Stefania Saviolo, a lecturer in fashion and luxury management at Bocconi University in Milan. The company stubbornly indulges in practices that sometimes raise eyebrows. In a nod to its origins, this spring the main window display of Hermes’ flagship store on Paris’ fashionable rue du Faubourg Saint-Honore included some horse dung. It wasn’t just any manure, Dumas told an audience at the equestrian competition Saut Hermes. It came from horses in la Garde Republicaine, an elite unit of mounted police officers who often protect dignitaries at official ceremonies. The eccentricities don’t end there. The company’s earnings presentations are in French, an oddity in the world of high finance and at big companies, where English dominates — that’s even though Dumas, who attended an executive program at Harvard University, speaks English. Attempting to perpetuate the myth of the company’s above-the-fray ways, Dumas told business school students in 2019 that Hermes doesn’t “do marketing”. Never mind that the company, like others in the industry, advertises and promotes products. Profitability could be vastly increased if changes were made in the way the company is run, but that’s not the Hermes way, Dumas said. During the fight against Arnault, the family warned that if Hermes were part of LVMH, pressure for profits would undermine the craftsmanship and traditions that have defined the brand. Over the years, Arnault has changed the face of Louis Vuitton, bringing in the likes of Marc Jacobs, a young designer who updated the products with quirky designs, and pushing to produce more as demand soared.

At Hermes, each bag is still made by a single artisan who can spend up to 20 hours on one Kelly model, folding and sewing together pieces of calf or crocodile skin. People familiar with the firm say the clan’s Protestant culture permeates the strategy, infusing a sense of individual responsibility for, say, a bag that will make the artisan proud. Loading Unlike many rivals, Hermes regularly updates investors on its manufacturing capacity. Its stated goal is to boost the output of its leather goods by around 7 per cent annually — with the opening of one plant a year in France. That’s even though demand has created a backlog of orders for some sought-after purses that far outstrip this increase. The company’s ability to boost production is capped by the need for the right skills and savoir-faire, Dumas said during the opening of an atelier in the town of Louviers in Normandy, in northwestern France, in April. “Training takes time,” he said. “Our best artisans become trainers so they’re no longer in production.” That’s why one opening a year is “optimal to not disrupt what we do while still growing”.

The group doesn’t reveal how many bags or scarves it makes each year, and shortages haven’t prompted it to hike up prices as much as it could. That in turn has spawned a juicy resale market for Birkin, Kelly and Constance models, consistently drawing rich mark-ups. “Clients will pay a premium for these pieces as the handbags stand the test of time,” said Rachel Koffsky, the international head of handbags and accessories at the auction house Christie’s. “These pieces are considered classic, not trendy,” and have become “investment-worthy”, she said. Two years ago, a Hermes bag broke a record at auction to become the most expensive handbag ever sold. The hammer came down at more than $US500,000 for a diamond-encrusted Himalaya Kelly, a crocodile-skin handbag in mother-of-pearl white. At a Christie’s bag auction last month, 60 per cent of the lots were sold above the highest estimates, with the auction house singling out the performance of Hermes, a sign of the brand’s client-following. On a recent afternoon in front of the company’s flagship boutique in Paris, Kiki Liu described herself as a loyal customer, one who over the past decade has bought a number of Hermes bags, including Birkin and Kelly models. The Chicago resident on a family vacation was pleased about landing an appointment with a Hermes sales person to inquire about a purse. “I have many different bags from various brands but I feel like the Hermes ones keep their value and are timeless,” Liu said, as she left the store with her children. “They’re a good investment and I feel like I can pass them on to my girls.”"

"From a failed takeover by LVMH to its policy of never using celebrity brand ambassadors, here are some lesser-known ... - Luxurylaunches","Thu, 28 Dec 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vbHV4dXJ5bGF1bmNoZXMuY29tL2Zhc2hpb24vbGVzc2VyLWtub3duLWZhY3RzLWFib3V0LWhlcm1lcy5waHDSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"

Hermès, a family-owned luxury goods business, epitomizes a blend of creativity, craftsmanship, and a rich history marked by unmistakable authenticity. With a legacy spanning 187 years, this French luxury brand still reigns supreme as a $224 billion enterprise. Much of its success is attributed to its unique approach to business, famously known as ‘the Hermès way,’ which once led to the dismissal of Bernard Arnault, founder of luxury giant LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE, who attempted to infiltrate this family fortress over a decade ago.





The founding family collectively owns more than two-thirds of the luxury goods maker. Operating 311 stores globally, with 223 directly owned and operated, Hermès’ range from sought-after scarves to best-selling Birkins and the iconic Kelly bags has solidified more than just a renowned name. Hermès is not just a status symbol; it is a pinnacle of aspiration, underlined by several fascinating facts about what makes the world adore its signature candy-colored orange boxes-

A father and son duo gave the Kelly and Birkin bags to the world

Can a product overshadow its brand? Certainly, since 1951, Robert Dumas, a son-in-law of third-generation Émile Hermès, introduced the Kelly bag to the world. The gorgeous Grace Kelly sported the leather accessory, and it has been immortalized ever since. becoming an entity of its own.



Robert’s son, Jean-Louis Dumas, created the evergreen Birkini bag in 1978, inspired by the late British actress Jane Birkin and her quest for the perfect handbag. She whined to him on a flight about not finding a handbag she liked. Similarly, the Hermès “carré introduced in 1937 with its hand-rolled edges became an icon of luxury fashion, sported by royalty, celebrities, and fashion icons over the decades. The Hermès’ brand philosophy, per former CEO Jean-Louis Dumas, is “We don’t have a policy of image, we have a policy of product.”

Celebrity-Free Chic: Hermès’ Unique Appeal in a World Obsessed with Stardom –

In stark contrast to its rivals, Hermès stands out by not leveraging the glamour of high-profile models or social media celebrities for its promotions. This distinct approach is evident in its advertising, which notably lacks the presence of widely recognized personalities. While other luxury brands often capitalize on the visibility offered by celebrities at high-profile events, Hermès maintains a low-key profile. This strategy has proven effective, as evidenced by the enduring demand for its iconic Birkin and Kelly bags. Customers are willing to endure extensive wait times, often spanning months or years, for these coveted items, underscoring the brand’s unique appeal in a world often dominated by celebrity endorsement.



Hermès distances itself from the Kardashians and social media influencers of the world, opting instead for a unique approach. The brand made waves by using manure sourced not from just any ordinary stud farm but exclusively from the elite horses of the French Republican Guard. This distinctive choice was for its barn-themed window display at the flagship Paris store.

LVMH’s takeover attempt of Hermes brought the heirs even closer

When LVMH boss Bernard Arnault disclosed his amassed company shares for a possible takeover to Bertrand Puech 13 years ago, it spurred the Hermès family to form an even stronger alliance. In no time, 50 Hermès descendants got together and unanimously agreed on the creation of an even tighter ring fence, per Bloomberg. Subsequently, a holding structure was established, controlling around 54.3% of Hermès’ shares and first refusal rights to additional family-owned shares. More than a decade later, in 2022, the Hermès heirs owned nearly 67% of the company, per its annual report. Hermès’ market value of an impressive $216 billion is about 60% of LVMH’s, with roughly one-seventh of the revenue.

No celebrities at the helm of creation-

Contrary to luxury labels, which often enlist celebrities to lead their collections, such as music superstar Pharrell Williams or Virgil Abloh as creative directors for Louis Vuitton, Kanye West’s Yeezy line for Adidas, Rihanna was the creative director for Puma’s women’s line, Hermès takes a different approach. While Hermès’ designers may not be celebrities, they are exceptionally talented. For example, Véronique Nichanian has been a distinguished menswear designer at the luxury house for over 35 years. Nadège Vanhee-Cybulski has served as the Artistic Director for Hermès’ women’s ready-to-wear collection for nearly a decade. Additionally, Pierre-Alexis Dumas, a member of the sixth generation of the Hermès family, holds the position of Artistic Director at Hermès

Earnings calls in French-

Rooted in tradition, the family, worth $56 billion and ranked as the world’s third-richest, adheres to its heritage even in financial communications. The company’s earnings presentations are given in French, a rarity in high finance and fashion, though English translations are provided for the global audience, investors, and stakeholders.

A single artisan behind the magic and the masterpiece-

Hermès handbags, particularly iconic models like the Birkin and Kelly, are exceptionally sought-after. Despite the crazy demand, Hermès has not resorted to mass producing to cater to the ever-increasing demand. Each bag, particularly the Birkin and Kelly, is handcrafted by a single artisan, taking over 25 hours for a Birkin and around 20 hours for a Kelly. This commitment to craftsmanship makes each bag not just a product but a creation imbued with individual responsibility and pride. With so much thought and quality poured into each product, it is no wonder that the handbags cost up to six figures. Celebrities, royalty, and head honchos of the business world are drawn to the bags, making it their million-dollar arm candy strutted with pride. According to Pierre-Alexis Dumas, “I think Hermès objects are desirable because they reconnect people to their humanity… Our customer feels the presence of the person who crafted the object, while at the same time the object brings him back to his own sensitivity, because it gives him pleasure through his senses”."

"We won't sacrifice growth for environmental concerns, says billionaire Louis Vuitton heir - The Telegraph","Wed, 20 Dec 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRlbGVncmFwaC5jby51ay9idXNpbmVzcy8yMDIzLzEyLzIwL3dvbnQtc2FjcmlmaWNlLWdyb3d0aC1mb3ItZW52aXJvbm1lbnQtbG91aXMtdnVpdHRvbi_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Louis Vuitton owner LVMH will not sacrifice growth to accommodate environmental concerns, the eldest son of billionaire Bernard Arnault has said.

Antoine Arnault, who heads up LVMH’s environmental initiatives, said the luxury giant will prioritise expansion over climate targets.

Between 2019 and 2022, LVMH cut back emissions by reducing how much energy it uses in its stores.

However, its supply chain emissions – known as ‘Scope 3’ emissions – rose by 16pc.

Over the three years, sales were up 48pc – with scope 3 emissions now accounting for most of LVMH’s carbon footprint.

LVMH has recently unveiled plans to help its suppliers reduce their emissions, although Mr Arnualt said bosses of the world’s biggest luxury group were “champions of continued growth and certainly not of decline”.

In an interview with the Financial Times, he defended how LVMH sets its eco-friendly targets: “We have always done things a little differently.

“It doesn’t bother us because we own the decisions we make and above all, we believe in data, science and the reality of things, not in some sort of incantations that we could make to clear our conscience.

“Not everyone likes it, but that’s how it is. And so we will continue to set objectives like those you’ve seen.”

It comes as luxury companies grapple with pressure to improve their environmental practices.

Rival Kering, which makes Gucci and Yves Saint Laurent products, earlier this year unveiled plans to reduce its absolute greenhouse gas emissions by 40pc by 2035.

Kering’s chief sustainability and institutional affairs officer Marie-Claire Daveu at the time said the challenge was cutting emissions while also trying to sell more products.

However, Mr Arnault pushed back on suggestions that cutting emissions could mean encouraging customers to buy less.

He said: “Becoming a sort of example of lower consumption, that’s not at all our objective and I don’t think that’s what our customers want either.”

Despite this, Mr Arnault hinted that LVMH could cut ties with suppliers if they failed to hit climate targets."
"Spies, Surveillance and a ‘State Within the State’: How France’s Richest Man Built His Luxury Empire - Novara Media","Mon, 11 Dec 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigwFodHRwczovL25vdmFyYW1lZGlhLmNvbS8yMDIzLzEyLzExL3NwaWVzLXN1cnZlaWxsYW5jZS1hbmQtYS1zdGF0ZS13aXRoaW4tdGhlLXN0YXRlLWhvdy1mcmFuY2VzLXJpY2hlc3QtbWFuLWJ1aWx0LWhpcy1sdXh1cnktZW1waXJlL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"When a young Bernard Arnault visited New York in 1971 he asked a taxi driver if he had heard of the French president Georges Pompidou. The driver replied, “no, but I know Christian Dior”.

This is supposedly the moment that set Arnault on the path to building Louis Vuitton Moet Hennessy (LVMH) – the internationally renowned luxury goods empire that has seen him go from being part of a family of small business owners, to becoming one of the world’s richest men. (He overtook Elon Musk in the Forbes and Bloomberg rankings in December 2022, though Musk regained the top spot in July of this year.)

50 years later, the distinction between the power of the president and a seemingly innocuous luxury goods firm is no longer as stark, with LVMH standing accused of operating a “state within the state”, in a scandal which is exposing the symbiotic relationship between France’s ultra-rich and its neoliberal political class.

An exposé by the newspaper Le Monde at the end of August accused Arnault of having regular direct access to the president and exercising pressure over government ministers, shedding new light on his proximity to power. It also shed light on the revolving door between the government and LVMH, with a consistent exchange of personnel between LVMH and president Macron’s ruling party, Renaissance.

According to Politico, Arnault even lobbied Macron to have prime minister Elisabeth Borne replaced with interior minister Gerald Darmanin, an economic liberal with whom Arnault has a personal relationship. Although he was unsuccessful, that Arnault can engage in such off the record lobbying of the president demonstrates his influence.

For their part, Macron and his allies see LVMH as a useful arm of French soft power. In a telling anecdote, Le Monde described how, at a state dinner, president Macron’s wife Brigitte introduced Bernard Arnault’s wife Delphine, to Chinese president Xi Jingping. Xi is said to have “rhapsodised” about LVMH.

The close relationship between Arnault and Macron’s government can partly account for a number of new laws that favour the ultra-wealthy.

In 2017, Macron ended the Solidarity Wealth Tax (ISF), an annual tax that targeted all wealth above €1.3 million including shares, investments and physical assets, of which Arnault had made clear his disapproval.

The Solidarity Wealth Tax was replaced by the Real Estate Wealth Tax – targeting property – and the flat tax of 30% on capital gains. The cut, brought in under Macron, a president he personally endorsed and supported through the newspapers that he owns, saves him several million euros each year, according to newspaper Liberation.

“The flat tax is a one-time tax on capital that means that the wealthiest effectively pay a considerably smaller percentage of their fortune in tax than before Macron”, Nicholas Framont, author of Parasites, a book on France’s ultra-rich, told Novara Media.

Arnault, “is someone that benefits from all the French laws and all the French public aid, and benefits from them constantly,” he said. “For me that is a specificity of French capitalism, that the French bourgeoisie… do everything to receive as much public money as possible, contrary to the image people often have of the bourgeoisie as entrepreneurial and independent of the state. In fact, they are served enormously by the state.”

Arnault’s close relationship with the state does not appear to have been damaged by repeated allegations against his conduct.

The story of how LVMH became one of the biggest luxury brands in the world – owning such household names as Veuve Clicquot Champagne, Tiffany and co. jewellers and the fashion brand Fendi – can be traced back to the acquisition of Christian Dior in 1984. This marked the beginning of the pivot of the family company away from civil engineering and manufacturing towards textiles and luxury goods. From then, Arnault began methodically building his empire, quietly acquiring shares in luxury brands until he was the majority shareholder, at which point the hostile takeover and merger into his company would begin.

In an interview with CNBC, Arnault said that the story of the LVMH behemoth is one of “creativity and organisation” as well as the vision to see the possibilities for a major luxury brand. What this leaves out is the ruthless attitude that earned him the nickname “the wolf in cashmere”.

This was evident in the way that he bought struggling companies like the textile manufacturer Boussac in 1984: He promised to turn the company around, then promptly fired the workforce and sold the company for parts.

This ruthlessness has even extended to alleged dirty tricks, like espionage and what his critics call “parasitism” on the French public purse.

Arnault has often faced accusations of foul play. In 2021, Forbes revealed that Arnault had over $1.6 billion stashed in Luxembourg, a tax haven. Arnault did not comment on the investigation.

His name also appeared several times in the Paradise papers, which revealed that several of Arnault’s assets, including a London property and a yacht, were owned via tax havens. When Le Monde reported on the contents of the Paradise Papers leaks, Arnault responded by threatening to pull ads from the newspaper and calling the article a “journalistic operation designed to create a sensation” and called into question the methods of the authors, saying that he had not broken any laws and that the article had neglected to mention this.

In 2022 the Guardian revealed that Uber had asked Arnault to assist in lobbying efforts to ease their entry into the French market. Arnault invested $5 million personally in Uber, though it is unclear if he lobbied on its behalf. Arnault did not respond to the revelations.

In March this year the New Yorker reported that Arnault’s name featured among a hacked list of clients of the Swiss private intelligence firm Alp that was also responsible for running smear campaigns on behalf of the UAE. Once again Arnault declined to comment.

In September, Le Monde alleged that Arnault may have been involved in laundering money through real estate transactions to Russian businessman, Nikolai Sarkisov. Arnault is the subject of an inquiry by the Paris prosecutor’s office over the transactions, though he called the allegations of money laundering “absurd and groundless”.

Perhaps most controversial of all, Arnault has a long history of alleged spying on his rivals. In 1988 as he manoeuvred to acquire LVMH, he hired private investigations firm Kroll Associates to spy on Henry Racamier, then head of the business, believing that Racamier was embezzling (he was later cleared). Fashion designer Tom Ford alleged that Arnault had private investigators sit in cars outside his apartment watching his movements. Kroll would reappear in Arnault’s story ten years later when Arnault fought bitterly (and failed) to acquire Gucci into the LVMH stable.

LVMH were not the first company to use these tactics, Airy Routier wrote in his book Exterminating Angel: The True Life of Bernard Arnault, but it did it with, “a systematic spirit and precision, which was the mark of true professionalism”.

This professionalism would be ramped up even further as the entanglement of LVMH with the French state grew under President Nicholas Sarkozy.

In 2013, Francois Ruffin, then a filmmaker, now MP for left populist party La France Insoumise, was making a film called “Merci Patron!” (Thanks Boss!). The film centres on Arnault and how he had allegedly mistreated workers who were left unemployed when he moved their factory to Poland. It was later revealed by investigative news outlet Mediapart that Arnault, outraged by the news of this film, had enlisted the services of former spy chief Bernard Squarcini to spy on Ruffin and his satirical journal/activist group Fakir between 2013 and 2016. Squarcini enlisted judges and policemen to spy on Ruffin and Fakir.

Cyril Porcréaux, an employee of Fakir, told Novara Media, “Over three years they spied on Fakir. Someone who was volunteering turned out to be a mole who was paid by Squarcini. They also brought in a private surveillance firm.”

When Fakir volunteers turned up to the general assembly of investors at LVMH to interrogate Arnault, they were kettled by riot police.

“When Francois and members of Fakir were going to be at the meeting for shareholders of LVMH, the mole… told Squarcini directly that it would happen”, said Porcréaux.

“It’s a complete reversal of the role of the state to serve private power,” he said.

Although Squarcini is currently being interrogated by the French justice system over his role in the affair, Arnault has escaped relatively unscathed. In December 2021, he was ordered to pay a fine of €10 million, after a Paris Judge ordered them to settle. The money “is nothing to him”, Porcréaux told Novara Media. At the time of the settlement Ruffin addressed the judge asking “can justice be bought so cheaply?”

Arnault’s brief period holding the title of world’s richest man has garnered him more attention. Equally, as his alarming proximity to the Macron government has become apparent, his activities are being subjected to public scrutiny like never before and yet his power remains broadly unchanged.

“In France Bernard Arnault is untouchable,” said Porcréaux.

While Hermes (RMS) stock price is hovering near its all-time high, others like LVMH, Kering, and Richemont are crawling back. LVMH stock was trading at €746, up from the November low of €650.

LVMH vs Kering vs Richemont vs Hermes stocks

Crypto and stock price rally

Copy link to section

The first reason I’m buying these stocks is that global stocks are doing modestly well. In New York, key indices like the Dow Jones, Nasdaq 100, and S&P 500 have entered a strong bull run. The tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 index is up by more than 40% this year while the small-cap Russel 2000 index has regained momentum.

In Europe, the German DAX and French CAC 40 indices are hovering near their all-time highs. Elsewhere in Japan, the Nikkei 225 and Topix indices have jumped to their mult-decade highs.

Meanwhile, the crypto bull run is here with us. Bitcoin has surged to $43,000 while the total market cap of all coins has jumped to over $1.6 trillion. Other newer tokens like ORDI and Bonk have continued soaring.

The implication of all this is that many people who have seen their portfolios grow this year will likely spend more on luxury goods. We saw this situation happen during the pandemic when these sales surged.

Central bank pivot

Copy link to section

Further, key central banks have hit their pivot as they declare victory on inflation. In the United States, the Federal Reserve hinted that it will start cutting rates in 2024. It predicted about three rate cuts while analysts believe that these cuts will be more.

In Europe, the ECB, SNB, and Bank of England left rates unchanged and maintained a somewhat hawkish tone. Nonetheless, economists believe that they too will start pivoting in 2024. Goldman Sachs economists see the BoE delivering three to four rate cuts in 2024. In a note, ING said this about the ECB:

“We think that it would require a sharper economic downturn and/or inflation sustainably falling below 2% to see the central bank cutting rates by as much as the currently priced in 150bp.”

The actions of central banks have an automatic impact on luxury brands since it leads to more spending. Also, it is a sign that inflation is falling and nearing the central banks target. Luxury brands can, therefore, spend less in production while maintaining higher prices.

China growth is continuing

Copy link to section

LVMH, Kering, Richemont, and Hermes have a common denominator in that China is their biggest market. In most cases, these companies tend to do well when the economy is thriving, which explains why they pulled back mid this year.

Now, there are signs that the economy is doing well. Data published on Friday revealed that the country’s industrial production and retail sales jumped sharply in November. Industrial production expanded by 6.6%, the fastest increase in two years.

Retail sales rose by 7.2%. These numbers mean that the Chinese economy is bottoming, which is a good thing for luxury groups."

The appetite for luxury goods and experience continued to grow in 2023, as the sector rebuffed the headwinds that constrained other parts of the economy. Diamonds shone brightly at auction, artwork painted a brighter picture as the year went on; unlikely partnerships were made while old gastronomic favourites parted ways. This was the shape of luxury in 2023.

Billion-pound hotels arrive in London

The Peninsula was unveiled in spectacular fashion in September this year

A luxury-hotel boom defined the hospitality scene in London in 2023. The Peninsula London’s arrival in Grosvenor Place in October topped a year dominated by five star, $1 billion-pound hotels where nightly rates rarely dip below £1,000, the biggest surge in openings since the 2012 Olympics, according to property information company CoStar.

Other high-profile launches included the £1.5 billion Raffles London at The OWO, the spectacular reimagining of the Old War Offices building in Whitehall, which opened after an eight-year development. Sanjay Hinduja told Spear’s the London outpost represented an important ‘legacy’ project for the family, saying: ‘We wanted to create a legacy in London. That was the dream of my father and his brothers – to leave a legacy behind.’

G.P. Hinduja & Family won the Entrepreneur of the Year award at the Spear’s Awards 2023, and were represented on the night by Shalini Hinduja.

The $1 billion hotel trend is set to continue into 2024 and beyond. Six Senses at The Whiteley in Queensway is due to launch next summer, while the doors of the prestigious Mandarin Oriental Mayfair on Hanover Square are slated to open in early 2024. The Chancery Rosewood on the former site of the US Embassy in Grosvenor Square is to open in 2025, as is the Waldorf Astoria Admiralty Arch.

Meanwhile, not to be outdone, London grandes dames Claridge’s and the Dorchester had extensive makeovers, ready to vie with the slew of sparkling new openings. The Coalin Finn-helmed Claridge’s Restaurant opened its doors in September, bringing a menu of refined British classics. It was last known as Claridge’s Restaurant more than 20 years ago.

The Dorchester had its biggest refurb in three decades with the iconic London hotel given a glamourous refresh by French interior designer Pierre-Yves Rochon and his studio PYR. Public spaces, including the spectacle Promenade, were reinvented with a blend of 21st-century luxury that retained the hotel’s ‘British spirit’. The rooms’ interiors were inspired by an English garden, adorned pale leaf green and rose fog pink, and heather blue and lemon yellow. The makeover followed the opening of its spa in April and the refurb continues, with penthouses and suites slated for later in 2024.

Why London and why now? Many of these ultra-luxe hotels were in the pipeline pre-2020 but the pandemic has accelerated the pivot to high-end travel.

Fflur Roberts, Head of Luxury Goods at Euromonitor says: ‘The pandemic has left many consumers yearning for real-life experiences and normalised routines. The trend transcends industries particularly those manifesting in luxury travel and hospitality. This is giving further opportunity for luxury fashion brands in the UK and in London in particular to side-step into this area by venturing into luxury hospitality with branded cafés, restaurants, food and wine pop-ups and of course luxury hotels, spas, wellness and residents.

‘This also comes at a time where marked increased spending on experiences and the “experiential” luxury category has been noted, with the likes of travel and hospitality being of particular note as more brands move towards the “lifestyle” sector.’

Global luxury experts at Virtuoso forecast travellers will be more interested in visiting far-flung destinations and having once-in-a-lifetime experiences than ever before in 2024, with ‘exclusive-use experiences,’ like private jets, yachts, and villas top of the list.

Art market’s (semi) revival and London clings onto to its crown

Le bassin aux nymphéas, Claude Monet, circa 1917-1919 has estimate of £65m

The art market had a subdued start to the year thanks largely to high interest rates that put the market into reverse: auction sales by Christie’s, Sotheby’s and Phillips were down 18.2 per cent in the first half of the year, according to Anders Petterson, founder of analysis firm to ArtTactic.

Collector confidence appeared to pick up in the second half of this year with Christie’s New York pulling in $864 million during its Fall Marquee Week with its highlight, Monet’s Le basin aux nymphéas (1917-19), selling for $74 million. In a blockbuster auction, Picasso’s Femme à la montre (1932) sold at Sotheby’s New York in November for $139 million.

But these sales may have disguised a market where ‘average values have moved little since 2016’, as one expert said.

‘The auction season’s spring sales are the first measure of market confidence and recent results suggest growth is already starting to slow,’ says AMR’s Sebastian Duthy. ‘While it’s tempting to connect the fortunes of the art market with current external events, big changes to the way auctioneers do business is equally important to factor in.’

Despite a patchy market, data suggests artworks are continuing to drive solid investment returns for UHNWs and investors as increasingly turning to art as an alternative asset class.

Art topped Knight Frank Luxury Investment Index (KFLII) in Q2 with 12-month growth of 30 per cent. It also outpaced other luxury investments as being seen to be more secure than traditional asset classes like stocks and bonds, according to research from London law firm Fladgate.

There was a growing split between New York and Europe, with the Big Apple’s autumn evening sales outperforming London. But the UK’s capital did bounce back and held off Paris in the long-running rivalry to be Europe’s art hub. Since Brexit, London has not been seen as the attractive opportunity it once was, particularly for those based in Europe but auction sales in London jumped 40 per cent in Q3 2023, ArtTactic analysis found, showing it was too early to draw any conclusions.

Bovet’s 19Thirty OWO Special Edition (left) has just 10 lucky owners. Right, Chopard has been producing ‘Race Edition’ Mille Miglia chronographs since 1988

Watch partnerships gained more momentum in 2023 with top-tier Swiss brand House of Bovet partnering with Raffles London at The OWO, to design limited edition wristwatches. The watches are engraved with details found throughout the OWO buildings and a quote from Winston Churchill: ‘We shape our dwellings, and afterwards our dwellings shape us.’

In an exhilarating partnership, luxury watchmaking brand, Richard Mille, teamed up with SP80, a racing sailboat designed to break the world record for wind-powered vessels. The partnership began through an introduction by NTPT, a company that supplies durable carbon to both Richard Mille (for its handmade watches) and SP80 (for the structure of the boat).

Panerai offer a ‘Special Operations Experience’ to buyers of its Submersible Chrono Navy SEALs

Its prototype was on display for the first time at the 2023 Monaco Yacht Show where it drew a large crowd.

Vacheron Constantin’s ongoing ‘Masterpiece on the Wrist’ project with the Louvre in Paris includes a private tour of the gallery and a one-off watch in which an artwork of the client’s choice is reproduced on the dial in grande feu enamel.

Audemars Piguet’s somewhat controversial tie-up with Marvel resulted in Royal Oak tourbillon watches with micro-sculpted versions of Black Panther and Spider-Man on the dial. And these collaborations don’t appear to be a flash in the pan: the Black Panther watch, launched in 2021 with a price of around £118,000, currently changes hands online for around £380,000.

Panerai’s Submersible Chrono Navy SEALs also launched this year. Limited to 50 pieces, this all-action boys’ toy of a watch is sold with an invitation to an immersive Special Operations Experience.

In other watch news, Audemars Piguet took home the coveted top prize at prestigious ‘Aiguille d’Or’ prize at the 2023 Grand Prix d’Horlogerie (GPHG) awards ceremony. The ‘Oscars of watchmaking’ recognise craftsmanship, innovation and artistry.

And who says sports watches can’t be bling? Not Patek Philippe, who launched ultra-opulent women’s sport watches in 2023, including the spectacular gem-set Aquanaut Luce Rainbow Minute Repeater, Reference 5260 that is set with 52 rainbow-coloured baguette-cut sapphires (3.19 ct), 112 baguette-cut diamonds (7.31 ct) and 160 brilliant-cut diamonds.

The brand also announced three spectacular versions of its classic sports-luxe watch, the Nautilus, emblazoned with all-over snow-set diamonds, and decorative elements – bezel, dial markers and bracelet centre links – in either blue sapphires, rubies or emeralds.

Car market stalls but some sectors overtake expectations

High interest rates and government sanctions on UHNW Russians put the brakes on UK sales of new supercars, research published in November suggested.



Sales of supercars in the UK slowed significantly, with just 621 cars registered in the UK in the year to March 2023. This was down from the 1,906 added in the 12 months to March 2022 and the 1,099 in 2021, according to the research compiled by national accountancy group UHY Hacker Young using DVLA figures.

Worldwide, the luxury car market was projected to reach US$20,650m in 2023, but with sales concentrated in the US.

Not all sales were stuck in the slow lane. The most expensive Ferrari ever sold at auction, a 1962 330 LM/250 GTO, was bought for $51.7 million in a sale hosted by RM Sotheby’s at Sotheby’s New York in November.

John Mayhead, UK editor of Hagerty Price Guide, told Spear‘s at the time, the sale was proof classic car collectors were still keen to buy, despite external factors subduing the market.

‘Pandemics, wars, fluctuating interest rates and a rise in the cost of living have created uncertainty and, in certain areas of the market, dissuaded investment in cars,’ he explained. ‘But for those who are wealthy enough, this can be a time of great opportunity, but they will only buy the very best.’

And they don’t get much better than the Rolls-Royce $30 million La Rose Noire Droptail which was unveiled in September. The first completed car in the third project from Rolls-Royce’s ultra-exclusive Coachbuild division, the La Rose Noire became the world’s most expensive car. The client’s identity has been kept confidential but they are rumoured to be a billionaire French family.

Royal bleu diamond is the year's most expensive jewel

The exceptionally rare bleu royal diamond is on sale for the first time in 50 years

The Bleu Royal, one of the rarest diamonds in the world, became the most expensive jewel to sell at auction in 2023. The 17.6-carat diamond ring was sold at Christie’s Geneva for slightly over $44 million, just shy of the $50 million upper estimate set prior to the auction.

Max Fawcett, head of jewellery at Christie’s Geneva said the sale reflected a wider trend for interest in coloured stones. Driven by collector demand and an increasingly limited supply, prices for top-quality coloured diamonds have increased exponentially in recent years.

Fawcett said the diamond was unique because of its deep rich blue colour and its unmodified pear shape. ‘It really ticked all the boxes, which is why we managed to excite collectors all around the world, all the way from the Far East, also to America,’ he said at the time. ‘We're extremely delighted with the result.’

It was only the fourth time in Christie’s 250 years that a fancy vivid blue diamond over 10 carats has been on sale.

LVMH reshuffle sparks Arnault family succession rumours

HBO’s super-rich saga Succession might have been TV’s big draw in 2023 but for some, the real drama lay with who will inherit the business empire of the world’s second richest man, Bernard Arnault.

The 74-year-old – one of the billionaire winners of 2023 and a 2023 Spear's Power List inductee – has spent years preparing his five children to step up to take control of LVMH, his luxury and fashion conglomerate but has kept any succession plans underwraps.

In November, a reshuffle at LVMH sparked succession rumours when it was announced eldest son Antoine, 46, will step back from the day-to-day management of upmarket menswear label Berluti as of 1 January. Was he being lined up for the top job?

[See also: Brace yourself, 2024 could be a wild ride*]

It’s by no means a given; all five of Arnault's children manage one of LVMH's brands: Delphine Arnault, 48, is CEO of Dior; Alexandre Arnault, 31, former CEO of luggage brand Rimowa, is now a Tiffany & Co. executive; Frédéric Arnault, 28, is CEO of watch brand Tag Heuer; and Jean Arnault, 25, is marketing and product development director of watches for Louis Vuitton.

Despite the re-positioning, LVMH lifted the age limit for its CEO in 2022, allowing Bernard Arnault to stay at the helm until he’s 80 so he might not be relinquishing the reins just yet.

The shine comes off whisky

Whisky prices have fallen despite some high profile sales

Purchases of rare whisky bottles, which have been the strongest performer over the past 10 years in the Knight Frank index, were the only luxury asset class to see a fall this year.

The results were compiled for Knight Frank by Rare Whisky 101, an intelligence and insight firm which tracks interest in fine whiskies. ‘Bottles of rare whisky have had a far more sedate time from a performance perspective over the past three years,’ said Rare Whisky 101’s Andy Simpson of industry consultant Simpson Reserved.

[See also: How to secure the latest edition of Diageo’s ‘rare’ Prima & Ultima whisky collection]

‘Higher value (over £5,000) bottles have re-traced recently due to a myriad of geo-political, social and economic reasons. Certain brands have still performed well, while the market leader (from a sheer volume of market perspective), Macallan, has seen particularly punishing losses with its index re-tracing almost 12 per cent over the past twelve months.’

Mayfair manoeuvres

In August chef patron Michel Roux Jr announced he would be closing Mayfair stalwart Le Gavroche in January (the last day of service will be Saturday 13 January 2024 – but good luck getting a table).

The restaurant was started by his late father, Albert, and uncle, Michel Sr, in 1967. In a heartfelt statement, Roux Jr said he needed to step down to find a better work/life balance, spend more time with his family and on his other business ventures.

But as W1 said goodbye to one legendary Mayfair venue, another rises from the ashes as Richard Caring’s 90s’ society favourite Le Caprice is about to be relaunched by Jeremy King as Arlington.

Arlington is one of three slated King openings as he resurrects a new empire after losing control of the Wolseley along with the rest of his portfolio when he was ousted from Corbin and King in 2022. The Park, a ‘21st-century grand café’ in Marylebone, is slated for a spring 2024 opening, while the regeneration of Simpson’s in the Strand looks set to reimagine this bastion of English dining that will still draw on tradition.

"Chalhoub, LVMH, Emaar Mall, MAF and Aldar Properties unite to promote sustainability - The National","Sat, 02 Dec 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilgFodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGVuYXRpb25hbG5ld3MuY29tL2NsaW1hdGUvcm9hZC10by1uZXQtemVyby8yMDIzLzEyLzAyL2NoYWxob3ViLWx2bWgtZW1hYXItbWFsbC1tYWYtYW5kLWFsZGFyLXByb3BlcnRpZXMtdW5pdGUtdG8tcHJvbW90ZS1zdXN0YWluYWJpbGl0eS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Luxury retailer Chalhoub Group, luxury goods company LVMH, Emaar Malls Management, Majid Al Futtaim Properties and Abu Dhabi’s biggest listed developer Aldar Properties have partnered to accelerate sustainability targets in the UAE’s retail sector.

They have formed a joint taskforce, called Unity For Change, that aims to negotiate and execute an agreement by the end of 2024 on collaborative sustainability key performance indicators, according to a statement from the stakeholders on Saturday.

Key areas of co-operation include energy efficiency, clean energy, eco-design, water and waste management.

Objectives involve enhancing energy management, developing eco-design checklists, increasing clean energy adoption, improving water and air conditioning efficiency, researching greener alternatives for cement and recycling operational waste, the statement said.

“The aim of this partnership is collective action to reduce carbon footprint,” Patrick Chalhoub, group president of Chalhoub Group, said.

“We will focus on how to act on waste and water management, both in our own stores and in our retailers, use eco designs and green cement, how to reduce electricity needs and use renewable energy.

“We will fix certain KPIs to make it happen.”

In 2021, the UAE unveiled its Net Zero 2050 Strategic Initiative, a Dh600 billion ($163.4 billion) plan to invest in clean and renewable energy sources over the next three decades.

It was the first Gulf country to commit to net-zero emissions by 2050.

The strategic initiative aligns with the Paris Agreement, agreed in 2015 and signed by 195 countries including the UAE, which aims to limit the global temperature increase to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels.

The Unity For Change announcement comes as the UAE hosts the Cop28 climate summit in Dubai.

Under the initiative, after the KPIs have been defined and agreed upon by the end of 2024, each party will designate a co-ordinator who will evaluate sustainability progress and report to the parties, the statement said.

The co-operation aims to enhance management of energy consumption across the entities’ properties, tenant stores, and landlords’ common areas, while developing an eco-design checklist, pooling resources for clean-energy purchases to optimise consumption, and co-operating on chilled water management and air conditioning to enhance efficiency.

Additionally, there will be concerted efforts to research green concrete usage to achieve recycling objectives, the statement outlined.

Challenges include the infrastructure, developing a regulatory framework and possible resistance from other retailers and suppliers, according to Mr Chalhoub.

“When a business is growing double digits, it’s easy to set sustainability targets, but when the ride gets bumpy because of macroeconomic or geopolitical turmoil, sustainability tends to be pushed to the back of the pile,” said Antoine Arnault, head of image and environment at LVMH.

“However, we don’t see things that way and want to do the right sustainable actions even when things are not going as planned.”

LVMH signed a similar partnership with developer Hang Lung in China in 2022 and is already building stores that are better designed, more sustainable and consume less energy, he added.

“As a developer, we provide for a resilient future for our communities through sustainable design, resource efficiency, a green finance framework and cross-sector collaboration,” said Faisal Falaknaz, chief financial and sustainability officer at Aldar.

“The UAE will take a leading role to make sure that regulations are adapted in a way that will allow the private sector to be responsible going forward.”

Aldar Properties has introduced green clauses in all new leases requiring tenants to report their energy consumption and waste output. This encourages landlord-tenant collaboration and the developer helps by retrofitting retail units to make them more sustainable, he added.

Aldar spent Dh150 million last year on retrofitting properties that it owns or manages.

“The conclusion was that sustainability is actually good for business,” Mr Falaknaz said.

The developer also partnered with the Ministry of Climate Change and Environment in March to launch the Real Estate Climate Pledge, in which more than 60 companies will announce their decarbonisation plans by the end of this year.

In 2022, Mall of the Emirates became the biggest mall in the world to achieve the Leeds Platinum certification for operations and maintenance, said Ahmed El Shamy, chief executive of Majid Al Futtaim Properties.

“The mall has reduced water consumption by using low-flow fixtures, optimised irrigation systems, proper wastewater treatment and using grey water for our cooling systems,” he added.

“It used less energy in 2022 than in 2018 by nearly 20 megawatts, which is almost enough to power 2,000 homes for a whole year. We also use non-toxic materials to improve indoor air quality.”

The shopping mall is trying to reduce single-use plastic by more than 60 per cent and almost 75 per cent of mall workers use public transport, Mr El Shamy explained.

An Emaar Malls spokesperson said the company is focusing on the importance of energy efficiency, eco-responsible design and responsible use of resources."

2023 seems to be but the precipice of business investments as the world prepares for a global shift in luxury for 2024

Dec 26, 2023 | By Florence Sutton

From the Richemont Group’s rejection of an LVMH acquisition to Kering acquiring perfume house Creed and Rolex acquiring Bucherer, 2023 is the year of powerful mergers and acquisitions in the world of luxury.

L’Oréal’s Acquisition of Aesop for US$2.5 Billion

April saw Australia’s largest luxury acquirement. L’Oréal announced it was making plans to acquire Aesop, the Melbourne-based luxury skincare company, from Natura & Co. for a proposed transactional value of more than USD 2.5 billion. The deal was finalised in 30 August 2023 with Chief Executive Officer of L’Oréal Groupe, Nicolas Hieronimus commenting “On behalf of L’Oréal, I am very excited to welcome Aesop to the L’Oréal Groupe family.”

Richemont Rejects LVMH Acquisition

Since the start of the year, there have been rumours about a potential acquisition by the world’s largest luxury group LVMH of its fellow rival Richemont Group. The “whispers” were first reported by the Swiss newspaper Finanz und Wartscaft in February this year and has since gathered momentum. After LVMH’s successful turnover at Tiffany & Co., those in the luxury M&A space are speculating what the group’s next moves would be and many pointed towards Richemont’s crown jewel: Cartier. However, Chairman of Richemont Group Johann Rupert put to rest the acquisition rumours and said that the company was not for sale.

Kering Vs LVMH

In July, Kering and LVMH went head-to-head with their own conglomerate strategy dynamics — from a Kering acquisition to an LVMH sponsorship deal of Olympic proportions. Here’s what happened: The Kering Group made an acquisition bid towards Valentino, announcing that it bought a 30 percent stake in the Italian Maison for Euro 1.7 billion in cash. The move is part of a broader strategic partnership with Qatari investment fund Mayhoola as Gucci — another house under the Kering umbrella — navigates its way during a transitional year towards growth. LVMH on the other hand was gearing up for a different kind of takeover altogether. LVMH’s Bernard Arnault will be sponsoring the 2024 Summer Olympics in a first-of-its-kind deal that comes with a US$166 million (or approx. €150 million) payout and will include Chaumet medals and Moet Hennessy wine.

Twitter Became X

2023 was the year Twitter unveiled its new logo, from the recognisable blue bird to an “interim X” design. While the shake-up was met with dissension online, the choice of logo follows the likes of some of Musk’s other six companies including “SpaceX” and “xAi”; an alphabet he has a longstanding affinity with. Love him or hate him, this Twitter’s rebranding cemented Elon Musk’s legacy as one of the most influential tech magnates of All time.

Tapestry Took on Kering & LVMH

When it comes to the pantheon of luxury conglomerates, Kering and LVMH reign supreme as they each hold a sizeable portion of the luxury fashion and goods market. However, August 2023 saw Tapestry, the New-York based parent company of Coach, Stuart Weitzman and Kate Spade New York throw its hat in the ring after making plans to buy Capri, the owner of founder-led labels which include Jimmy Choo, Michael Kors and Versace. The US 8.5 Billion dollar deal was a strategic move by Tapestry to create a “new powerful global luxury house”.

Rolex Acquired Bucherer

Rolex and Bucherer both are no strangers to going against the grain since their inception, significantly so in an industry that is so tightly surveilled by its own craftsmen and consumers alike. However, Rolex’s acquisition of the world’s largest watch dealer Bucherer was described by Rolex as being driven by “a desire to perpetuate the success of Bucherer and preserve the close partnership ties that have linked both companies since 1924,” a strategic takeover which takes into account both the relationships Bucherer enjoys with existing watch and jewellery partners as well as the welfare of all the staff under its employment.

Kering Acquires Creed

In July, Kering Beauté made its first major acquisition as it procured luxury fragrance house Creed from BlackRock Long Term Private Capital Europe and its chairman, Javier Ferrán in a strategic move that aims to see the company’s future growth in the beauty industry. The ambitious takeover was helmed by former Estee Lauder executive Raffaella Cornaggia who was appointed the role of CEO of Kering‘s beauty division in February. The all-cash transaction merges Creed’s potential across categories and geographies alongside Kering’s plans for expansion. As LUXUO reported earlier this year, the addition of Creed into the Kering family further reinstates the brand as the “largest global independent player in the high-end fragrance market” while for Kering, the maneuver lifts the group’s financial profile while simultaneously adding another notch to the company’s beauty portfolio (which already includes a perfume lineup of Alexander McQueen, Balenciaga, Bottega Veneta, Pomellato and Qeelin).

The World's 500 Wealthiest People Got $1.5 Trillion Richer This Year - Yahoo Canada Shine On,"Fri, 29 Dec 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vY2Euc3R5bGUueWFob28uY29tL3dvcmxkLTUwMC13ZWFsdGhpZXN0LXBlb3BsZS1nb3QtMTgwMDAwMTAxLmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The world’s richest people may be sad to hear that 2023 is coming to a close, given how lucrative the year was for them.

In total, the 500 wealthiest people saw their net worth jump an eye-popping $1.5 trillion, Bloomberg reported on Friday. That’s a massive turnaround from 2022, when that same group lost almost $2 trillion. The growth was largely due to the stellar performance of tech stocks, which helped billionaires in that field gain a whopping $658 billion, or a 48 percent surge in their wealth.

More from Robb Report

Unsurprisingly, Elon Musk led the pack, with an additional $95.4 billion boosting his net worth to $232 billion and easily making him the wealthiest person in the world. In comparison, the Tesla and SpaceX founder saw a $138 billion dip in 2022. After his impressive 2023, though, the mercurial Musk regained his position on top from LVMH CEO Bernard Arnault, who is now virtually tied with Jeff Bezos for the title of the second-wealthiest person on the planet. (Arnault has a $179 billion fortune, while Bezos clocks in at $178 billion, after gaining $71.3 billion this year.)

Other notable names from 2023 include Mark Zuckerberg, who added $84 billion to his bank account throughout the year. The Meta founder is now worth $130 billion in total. And while she may not be a household name, the L’Oréal heir Françoise Bettencourt Meyers is now the wealthiest woman on the planet and the first woman to amass a $100 billion fortune.

While it’s impossible to tell whether 2024 will follow the favorable headwinds of 2023 or the downward dip of 2022, Bloomberg identified a handful of billionaires to watch in the new year. Several of them are related to the ever-growing world of sports: Miriam Adelson, worth $34.3 billion, just bought a majority stake in the Dallas Mavericks. That was thanks to Mark Cuban, worth $6.8 billion, who sold his stake in the team for a cool $3.5 to $4 billion. And Steve Cohen, with a net worth of $13.9 billion, owns the New York Mets and is working to make the team a baseball powerhouse. If their bets on sports go poorly, though, Adelson is behind the casino operator Las Vegas Sands, and Cohen is teaming up with Hard Rock International in a bid to nab one of New York’s lucrative new casino licenses.

Everyone’s surely hoping for a favorable hand in 2024, too.

Revenue hit €79.2bn (£69.6bn) for the full year to 31 December 2022 and profits reached €21.1bn (£18.5bn), both up 23%.

In October, this success continued as for the third calendar quarter to 30 September 2023, the luxury conglomerate’s fashion and leather goods business division sales increased by 9% year on year to €9.75bn (£8.4bn). Despite the challenges faced by many other luxury retailers and brands, LVMH attributed the revenue increase to ""remarkable growth in all product categories"" delivered by French fashion house Dior, ""the success of the latest new leather goods designs"" at Loewe under creative director Jonathan Anderson, Fendi's retail network expansion, and ""excellent performance"" delivered by labels Rimowa, Marc Jacobs and Berluti.

In July, LVMH announced it would become a premium partner of the Paris 2024 Olympic and Paralympic games. In June it also unveiled Japanese designer Satoshi Kuwata as the winner of the LVMH Prize for Young Fashion Designers – the 10th edition of the prize set up by the conglomerate in 2013.

LVMH owns luxury fashion and leather goods brands including Berluti, Celine, Dior, Emilio Pucci, Fendi, Givenchy, Kenzo, Loewe, Loro Piana, Louis Vuitton, Marc Jacobs, Moynat, Patou and Rimowa. It also holds minority stakes in Phoebe Philo, JW Anderson and Aimé Leon Dore."

LVMH took stock of its green progress to date and launched a new supplier-focused environmental impact reduction programme. Bernard and Antoine Arnault presented the group’s plan of action at a special event entitled “Life 360 Summit”, organised at the Paris headquarters of UNESCO on 14 December 2023 (pictured). The occasion served to underline the group’s desire to focus increasingly on the impact caused upstream and downstream of the supply chain. The new programme, among other points illustrated, includes a partnership with Chanel and potentially other groups with which LVMH shares suppliers, in order to work together to simplify audits.

LVMH’s green goals

LVMH has placed great emphasis on the supply chain. This is why it has defined “Life 360 Business Partners” (this is the name of the new plan) as “the group’s new compass to support its suppliers, particularly in the areas of raw materials and transport”, the holding company explained in an official note. “So, we will reduce with them not only Scope 3 emissions, which represent 95% of the group’s carbon footprint, but also the impact on water and biodiversity”. Starting in 2024, LVMH will organise special days to listen to suppliers’ needs and expectations in terms of environmental ambitions. For this purpose, it will create a portal to share solutions, expertise, regulatory monitoring, knowledge and environmental training programmes.

Financial and co-investment aid

“We will try to help our suppliers and partners to be more active on this topic by training them and investing with them in their transition”, said Antoine Arnault, acknowledging that supplier companies often face major financial challenges to renew their businesses. Indeed, the new partnership programme will include financial support and co-investment, as well as training and other initiatives “to engage suppliers as partners, in the hope of making any mandatory changes positive rather than penalising”, the manager explained.

The collaboration with Chanel

One way to optimise supplier performance will be through alliances with other luxury groups. LVMH wants to work together with them to define best practices and shared standards for its suppliers. First among them, LVMH will collaborate with Chanel, with whom it shares “the same vision of luxury”, as stated by Antoine Arnault. Working together is seen as a necessity “to move faster”.

Aware of regulatory and antitrust constraints, the groups will coordinate as much as possible on aspects such as sourcing and supplier control. Although the agreement is in its infancy, they have several ideas on the table. “These are collective challenges as all luxury brands are supplied with leather, cotton, silk and cashmere”, commented Bruno Pavlovsky, President of Chanel. “Only defined alliances will allow us to help the transformation upstream. Companies and brands will continue to work within their own creative ecosystems”.

Simplifying audits

The two groups hope to create a collective audit system, so that suppliers do not have to repeat their work several times. This partnership fully involves the leather supply chain. The announced objective is precisely to simplify audits and harmonise corporate and social responsibility reporting, as well as to reduce the Scope 3 impact. In its official press release, LVMH announces this initiative as “Stronger Together”, a way of joining forces (also with competitors) to achieve a further reduction in emissions.

New standards in environmental, social and governance (ESG) practices within the Middle East

Clear objectives for malls and retail operations, focusing on water consumption, air conditioning efficiency, use of clean energy, design and construction practices.

Dubai, United Arab Emirates: Chalhoub Group, LVMH, EMAAR Malls Management (L.L.C), Majid Al Futtaim Properties LLC, and Aldar Properties PJSC join forces to create “Unity For Change - أفــــــــــــــــق” (pronounced UFQ in Arabic, meaning horizon and symbolizing the future), a pionneering partnership among prominent retailers and real estate developers in the Emirates. This alliance is dedicated to defining and achieving sustainability targets.

The first partnership of its kind in the Middle East retail sector, between the five leading industry players, focuses on energy efficiency, clean energy, eco-design, water, and waste management, demonstrating a strong commitment to environmental responsibility and achieving each of the parties’ Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) goals.



This initiative reflects how to reduce the carbon and biodiversity footprints of the retail sector, with all entities intending to negotiate and execute a formal agreement within the next year.

The cooperation specifically aims to enhance understanding and management of energy consumption across the entities’ properties, tenant stores, and landlords’ common areas, while also developing a comprehensive eco-design checklist, polling resources for clean energy purchases to optimize energy consumption, cooperating in chilled water management and air conditioning to enhance efficiency, as well as other initiatives. Additionally, there will be concerted efforts to research green concrete usage to achieve recycling objectives.

Patrick Chalhoub, Group President at Chalhoub Group, commented: “In 2022, the Science Based Target Initiative (SBTi) validated our short-term carbon reduction goals. Achieving these targets requires collaborative efforts and I firmly believe in the power of collective action towards a common goal. We are pleased to collaborate with our partners to enhance our sustainability impact, setting clear objectives for both malls and retail operations. This first of its kind agreement marks the beginning of future partnerships aimed at ensuring a sustainable and resilient future for all.”

Antoine Arnault, LVMH Image & Environment, said: “Our 5,600 stores around the world create experiences for our customers that we strive to make as exceptional and as unforgettable as possible. The excellence of our stores extends to their environmental performance. To do so, we need to collaborate with landlords. After having signed a first partnership with Hang Lung in China in 2022, LVMH is proud to sign this second agreement with local partners in the United Arab Emirates. In the context of COP28, this agreement highlights our strong commitment to fighting climate change.”

An Emaar Malls Management spokesperson said: ""Our participation in this sustainability taskforce further demonstrates our unwavering commitment to environmental and social responsibility in the retail sector. We are focusing on fostering sustainable practices, emphasising the importance of energy efficiency, eco-responsible design, and responsible use of resources. This collaboration is another component of our strategic plan to seamlessly integrate sustainable solutions into our business operations, demonstrating our commitment to cultivating a sustainable future for our communities and stakeholders.""

Ahmed El Shamy, Chief Executive Officer Majid Al Futtaim Properties, said: “This partnership enhances and accelerates our existing efforts to reach our ambitious target to produce more energy and water than we consume, reaching Net Positive by 2040. We are proud to be a part of this shared commitment, aiming to set a new global standard in sustainable practices and achievements as it relates to retail landlord and tenant collaboration.”

Faisal Falaknaz, Chief Financial and Sustainability Officer at Aldar, said: “A key part of Aldar’s science-aligned net zero plan is to decarbonize our retail spaces and other commercial assets. This involves us actively engaging our supply chain and tenants to support their own transition to net zero. The partnership we have announced today provides a framework for Aldar to work closely with an important group of fellow industry leaders who share our commitment to creating environmentally friendly retail spaces that benefit developers, tenants, and our customers.”

The joint sectoral partnership between the five parties highlights their commitment to working as a collective unit towards their ambitious goals, and marks a testament to each of their commitments to enhancing their sustainable practices and set a new standard for environmental stewardship in the Middle East’s retail sector.

That’s according to bankers at JP Morgan, who have warned investors to stay clear of the likes of Burberry, LVMH and Kering.

‘Too early to chase luxury, stick with sport,’ the investment bank told clients, just weeks after HSBC published a gloomy report warning that three years of stellar growth for the sector was coming to an end.

While analysts remain bullish over long-term prospects, they warned of little growth in 2024 due to economic uncertainty in China, Europe and the US, which is heading into its election year.

JP Morgan downgraded its rating on Burberry, sending the shares down 1.3 per cent, or 19.5p, to 1493.5p, amid concerns the fashion house will struggle in the short term as consumer appetite cools next year.

LVMH, the French owner of Louis Vutton, Dior and Fendi, and Gucci owner Kering were also in the firing line.

Kering fell 0.4 per cent, or €1.45, to €409 but LVMH inched up 0.1 per cent, or €0.9, to €734.5.

The FTSE 100 rose 0.08 per cent, or 5.67 points, to 7548.44 and the FTSE 250 was up 0.18 per cent, or 33.64 points, to 18,695.76.

Recession fears mounted in the UK after the economy unexpectedly shrunk in October.

Across the Atlantic, the US Fed kept interest rates at 5.5 per cent.

Back in London, B&M fell 6.3 per cent, or 37.6p, to 562.8p after one of the discount retailer’s top shareholders reduced its stake.

SSA Investments raised £162million by selling 27.8m shares but will still own around 3.4 per cent of B&M.

Stock Watch - Tandem Tandem plunged after it warned its annual profits would get wiped out as customers cut back. The Birmingham firm – which sells bikes, toys and swing sets – flagged up lower demand due to the cost of living crisis. This year’s results are dependent on how many orders are shipped in December. The group, which had expected to break even, is likely to make a loss of between £900,000 and £1.3million for 2023.

Aston Martin skidded off course amid concerns over the luxury car maker’s ability to smoothly roll out new sports cars.

The FTSE 250 firm is gearing up for the launch and ramp-up of various models.

But HSBC said it faces an ‘uphill task’ to earn back trust following recent issues with the delivery of its new DB12 sports car.

Analysts at the bank described the company as a ‘mixed bag with significant potential’ that ‘needs to rebuild confidence having struggled with delivering on promised targets’.

HSBC said that the luxury car maker is at risk of missing its forecasts for the year and downgraded its rating on the stock. Aston fell 8.9 per cent, or 20.4p, to 208.6p.

Extraction fan maker Volution was up 3.5 per cent, or 13.8p, to 412p after raising its annual forecasts following a strong start to its new financial year as revenue rose 8 per cent to £121million in the four months to the end of November.

Petra Diamonds is closing in on the sale of one of its mines – Koffiefontein – in South Africa.

The group has explored the possibility of winding the site down since April last year and will decommission it if the sale falls through.

Its shares rose by 1 per cent, or 0.5p, to 50.5p yesterday.

Government contractor Capita signed a ten-year contract worth £34million with Ireland’s National Transport Authority.

The group, which also runs the London congestion charge and collects the BBC licence fee, will provide customer contact and information services for commuters. It rose 3 per cent, or 0.6p, to 20.74p.

Chapel Down marched ahead after its founder Frazer Thompson, who led Britain’s biggest wine maker for two decades until September 2021, snapped up a 4 per cent stake, after it last week made its debut on AIM, having been previously listed on the Aquis Stock Exchange.

Shares surged 19.2 per cent, or 12.5p, to 77.5p."
