LVMH buys Burgundy grand cru vineyard - Decanter.com,"Mon, 14 Apr 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlY2FudGVyLmNvbS93aW5lLW5ld3MvbHZtaC1idXlzLWJ1cmd1bmR5LWdyYW5kLWNydS12aW5leWFyZC0xMzUyMi_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"French luxury goods group LVMH has acquired the vast majority of one of Burgundy's oldest grand cru vineyards, Clos des Lambrays, for an undisclosed fee.

LVMH owner Bernard Arnault has added 8.66 hectares of Clos des Lambrays (pictured) to his fine wine empire, which already includes Krug and Dom Perignon Champagne, plus Chateau d’Yquem and Cheval Blanc in Bordeaux.

Clos des Lambrays, located near the village of Morey Saint-Denis, is one of the largest grand cru vineyards in Burgundy’s Cote de Nuits region and references to its name have been traced back to 1365.

LVMH did not disclose the fee paid to the vineyard’s owner, Societe du Domaine des Lambrays. But, French agency Safer, which tracks agricultural land deals, last year estimated the price of Burgundy grand cru vineyards at around €3.8m per hectare.

Arnault’s purchase comes amid strong consumer demand for top-end Burgundy wine.

Last year’s Hospices de Beaune auction achieved a record sales total of €6.3m, while several Burgundian producers, including DRC, Henri Jayer and Rousseau have become regular names at wine auctions across Europe, the US and Asia.

Societe du Domaine des Lambrays also produces Morey Saint-Denis Premier Cru, Puligny Montrachet Premier Cru Clos du Cailleret and Premier Cru Les Folatières white wines. Thierry Brouin, chief winemaker at the domaine for the past 35 years, will remain in place, LVMH said.

It is believed that Burgundian producer Taupenot-Merme has retained its ownership of a tiny portion of Clos des Lambrays vines, thought to be less than 0.5ha.

CNBC 25: Bernard Arnault - CNBC,"Tue, 29 Apr 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiN2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tLzIwMTQvMDQvMjkvMjUtYmVybmFyZC1hcm5hdWx0Lmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Arnault set about expanding LVMH via acquisition, adding ready-to-wear fashion house Céline in 1988, shoemaker Berluti and Japanese fashion brand Kenzo in 1993, and the perfumer Guerlain in 1994. He followed up with Spanish leatherwear maker Loewe in 1996, and New York fashion brand Marc Jacobs and cosmetics retailer Sephora in 1997. He bought Thomas Pink in 1999, Italian fashion house Emilio Pucci in 2000, and two more fashion houses, Fendi and DKNY, as well as the French department store La Samaritaine in 2001. He took a stake in Hermès, the silk scarf and saddle maker, in 2010 and a controlling interest in Italian jeweler Bulgari the following year. His most recent purchase was textiles maker Loro Piana in 2013.



The one that got away? Gucci. The Italian luxury leather accessories house rebuffed Arnault's overtures in 1999.

Though he sits at the center of this galaxy of brands, Arnault runs a decentralized group and gives each LVMH company considerable autonomy. The 64-year-old shows no sign of slowing down but has said he expects a family member to succeed him. Two of his five children appear as the most likely candidates: son Antoine, who has been tasked with turning Berluti into a major menswear brand, and daughter Delphine, an executive at Louis Vuitton."

Now the bulldozers are rumbling towards the former department store to destroy the last remaining parts of its historic facade, as campaigners make a last-ditch legal challenge to stop the demolition.

On Friday, judges postponed ruling on an appeal by locals and historians to revoke the building permit given to the luxury goods group LVMH – owned by France's richest man, Bernard Arnault. The group, whose brands include Louis Vuitton and Moët, is redeveloping the site.

The Paris administrative tribunal said the case needed to be decided by a larger college of judges, and it would announce its decision at the end of the month.

LVMH's €460m (£380m) plan for the site includes a luxury hotel, duty-free shop, designer stores and offices, as well as local authority apartments, a day centre and creche.

Three of the four facades were knocked down in February, reportedly immediately after judges said they would accept the opposition campaigners' legal case but failed to order a halt to demolitions. The fourth is scheduled for the same fate. LVMH said after Friday's decision: ""For the moment, the work continues.""

The company insists the facades have to go. A number of buildings forming part of the store and dating back to the 17th century have already been pulled down. The scheme has been backed by the new mayor of Paris, Anne Hidalgo.

Under designs drawn up by Japanese architects, the facades will be replaced with ""a set of etched glass waves"". Opponents say the new structure will look like a shower curtain.

Even before the store was closed in 2005 – apparently for safety reasons – it had seen better days.

In 1870 an ambitious travelling salesman, Ernest Cognacq, who had been hawking his wares from under an arch of Pont Neuf near the former site of the city's first mechanised pump, the Pompe de la Samaritaine or pump of the Samaritan, opened a small shop.

With the help of his wife, Marie-Louise, and her 20,000-franc dowry, Cognacq expanded the business, acquiring neighbouring properties with the aim of building his ideal department store.

By 1925, La Samaritaine – by then four separate stores known somewhat unimaginatively as Magasins 1, 2, 3 and 4 – had been transformed by the art nouveau architect Frantz Jourdain and was reporting annual sales of more than 1bn francs.

In 1933, the store was given another makeover, by the architect Henri Sauvage, who reshaped it according to art deco principles. But the shop went into decline in the late 1970s and 1980s, and was bought by LVMH in 2001.

The company leased off two of the magasin buildings and in 2005 decided to shut the other two.

Julien Lacaze, of the Society for the Protection of the Landscape and Beauty of France, said Friday's legal development was ""overall, good news"", adding: ""All the judges of the administrative tribunal will be asked to decide … they can completely rejudge this affair that doesn't just concern La Samaritaine but the future of building in Paris.""

Marie-Line Antonios, director general of La Samaritaine and in charge of the renovation project, insisted the new glass facade would ""fit in with the landscape"". She said it was about creating a ""la nouvelle Samaritaine"".

LVMH says its project will create 2,100 jobs, and the new store will open in 2016. A spokesperson told Le Monde the project had been ""entirely studied and approved"" by the relevant government authorities."

One of Burgundy’s most famous vineyards was returned to French hands last night as billionaire Bernard Arnault’s luxury goods giant LVMH bought the 14th century Clos des Lambrays from its German owners.

Some in the region have been dismayed to see its prestigious producers being sold to wealthy foreigners, most notably the takeover in 2012 of a famous chateau, Le Chateau de Gevrey-Chambertin by a Chinese casino magnate.

Local growers have even warned of a “foreign invasion” of mainly Asian investors into the region.In Bordeaux, at least 20 chateaux have been taken over by Chinese buyers in recent years.

LVMH, whose name stands for Louis Vuitton Moet Hennessy, owns some of the world’s most famous luxury brands. So analysts said Clos Des Lambrays’ fine wines like the Puligny Montrachet Premier Cru “Clos du Cailleret” make a good fit. While LVMH has been buying fine wines in recent years to add to its famous names like Chateau D’Yquem and Chateau Cheval Blanc, yesterday’s deal was its first in Burgundy.

Locals had not been overly concerned by Clos de Lambrays’ German ownership since 1996, as Gunter and Ruth Freund were knowledgable about Burgundies and invested in restoring the chateau and improving the vineyards, while retaining the services of Thierry Brouin, its chief winemaker for the last 35 years. He will remain in charge under LVMH. Ms Freund began looking for a buyer following Mr Freund’s death in 2010."

In addition to emphasizing that its major luxury goods would continue to not be sold online, he commented on the promise of the Marc Jacobs brand:

“Marc Jacobs wasn’t even a $10 million company when we invested in it. Now it’s making a billion euros a year in revenue. There are other designers we’ve invested in who haven’t matched that type of performance. Perhaps they weren’t as talented…. Marc Jacobs is the most emblematic designer in the United States. [An IPO could mean] that over the next five to 10 years one company could equal a third of the value of the group. You can see the kind of promise all of this holds.”

The meeting was also marked by Arnault reiterating the group’s commitment to bolstering the French economy with new jobs and taxes, of which LVMH paid one billion euros last year."
LVMH Acquires Clos des Lambrays Vineyard in Burgundy - The Business of Fashion,"Mon, 14 Apr 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzb2ZmYXNoaW9uLmNvbS9uZXdzL25ld3MtYW5hbHlzaXMvbHZtaC1hY3F1aXJlcy1jbG9zLWRlcy1sYW1icmF5cy12aW5leWFyZC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS, France — LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SA, the world's largest luxury goods company, bought the Clos des Lambrays vineyard to expand into Burgundy, adding to its holdings in Bordeaux, Champagne and the New World.

The acquisition, for which no price was disclosed, is for an 8.66 hectare (21.4 acre) vineyard which produces Clos des Lambrays Grand Cru red wine, a ranking classifying it among the top wines of Burgundy, as well as Morey-Saint-Denis Premier Cru and white wines Clos du Cailleret and Les Folatieres from Puligny-Montrachet, LVMH said in an e-mailed statement.

The purchase comes after first-quarter sales of wines and spirits at Paris-based LVMH fell 3 percent on an organic basis, partly reflecting lower Chinese demand for cognac due to a clampdown by President Xi Jinping's government on spending on banqueting and gifts. LVMH's founder and chief executive officer is Bernard Arnault, France's richest person with a net worth of $34 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

“For a wine that has a sense of place and individuality, I’ve always really loved it,” said Joss Fowler, director of fine wines at London broker Fine+Rare, noting that Clos des Lambrays’ wines generally sell for a lower price than those of its neighbor Clos de Tart.

Fourteenth Century

The Clos des Lambrays vineyard, in Morey-Saint-Denis in Burgundy’s Cote de Nuits region between Dijon and Beaune, traces its winemaking history back to 1365, when it was cited in the deeds of Citeaux Abbey, according to the vineyard’s website. The property was broken up during the 1789 French revolution and put back together again in 1868.

LVMH has acquired it from Ruth Freund, who bought the vineyard with her German husband, Guenter, in 1996. Her decision to sell follows his death in 2010. LVMH will retain Thierry Brouin, the estate’s chief winemaker, who has produced its past 35 vintages.

The estate makes about 35,000 bottles a year with an average retail price of 120 euros ($165) each, according to LVMH.

Fine+Rare lists the 2012 Clos des Lambrays at 1,550 pounds a case and the 2010 vintage at 1,453 pounds a case, according to its website. That compares with 3,186 pounds a case for the Clos de Tart 2012 and 2,845 pounds for its 2010.

Bordeaux Estates

Outside Burgundy, LVMH already has a stake in Chateau Cheval Blanc, one of the top four wine estates in Bordeaux’s Saint-Emilion region, according to its 2012 classification, and owns top-ranked Sauternes estate Chateau d’Yquem, a producer of sweet white wines.

LVMH also controls Champagne brands including Moet & Chandon, Dom Perignon, Veuve Clicquot Ponsardin, Krug, Ruinart and Mercier, and through its Estates & Wines division owns vineyards across the New World.

Principal holdings include Cloudy Bay in New Zealand’s Marlborough region, Cape Mentelle in the Margaret River area of Western Australia, Newton Vineyard in California’s Napa Valley, Terrazas de los Andes in Argentina and Numanthia in Spain’s Toro region, as well as Chandon sparkling-wine estates in Argentina, Brazil, California and Australia.

LVMH wine and spirits sales fell 8 percent to 888 million euros in the first quarter of this year, according to an e- mailed statement April 9. While the decline reflected pressure on cognac sales in China amid destocking by retailers, the company said Champagne had a good start to the year, with prestige vintages posting strong growth.

When people talk about the fashion industry as a teeny-tiny, insular world, they aren’t being glib. Although fashion plays a major role on the world stage, both culturally and financially (last year, luxury sales reportedly exceeded $318 billion worldwide), just a handful of companies dominate the industry. Although a select number of high-end labels (like Chanel) are privately owned and some others (like Michael Kors) are publicly traded, more and more of the world’s best known brands belong to major conglomerates, like LVMH (which is doing its best to acquire remaining holdouts, like Hermès).

In the graphic above, you can see how just six large companies control over forty of the world’s top luxury fashion brands. To see an expanded version, click here.

Rolex Watches Appoints Jean-Frederic Dufour As New CEO - aBlogtoWatch,"Mon, 14 Apr 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFibG9ndG93YXRjaC5jb20vcm9sZXgtd2F0Y2hlcy1hcHBvaW50cy1qZWFuLWZyZWRlcmljLWR1Zm91ci1uZXctY2VvL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"aBlogtoWatch received a note from Rolex today on the appointment of a new brand CEO. The news release from Rolex was a scant, one line document on official letterhead that explained Jean-Frederic Dufour would be appointed as the CEO of Rolex SA in Geneva. Mr. Dufour would be replacing Gian Riccardo Marini.

Many in the watch industry are familiar with Jean-Frederic Dufour as the CEO of Zenith watches, a position he will now be leaving. Zenith is part of LVMH, and after a successful time there since 2009, he is making the ultimate trip up the ladder to being in a top leadership position at Rolex.

Advertising Message

Mr. Dufour is a known friend and protegé of the famed Jean-Claude Biver, former CEO of Hublot, who continues to retain a position of influence at the brand and who now has a more senior role guiding the watch brand divisions of LVMH (which also includes Zenith and TAG Heuer, among others). Mr. Biver greatly assisted Mr. Dufour when he started at Zenith and most agree that their combined work has turned Zenith into a brand which has recaptured and in many ways exceeded much of its former glory.

Rolex is known for having relatively long-standing CEOs and the stepping down of Gian Riccardo Marini is unique since he was appointed in 2011. The release from Rolex suggests that the stepping down of Mr. Marini and the appointment of Mr. Dufour was “in agreement” with Mr. Marini.

Ironically, I just posted an article on Forbes regarding Rolex’s position as the number 1 most reputable consumer products company in the world. The company is in very good shape as Jean-Frederic steps in–so it will be his job to continue and maintain that success. Rolex is known for being relatively secretive so it is unclear what type of role Mr. Dufour will now have in dealing with the media as the CEO of Rolex. In the past, aBlogtoWatch has sat down with Mr. Dufour to talk product and the watch business. He is a very capable fellow and of course we wish him success in his new position leading Rolex. rolex.com"

TA Associates owns 65% of the company, while the eponymous founder owns 23%, and management the remainder.

MUMBAI: The Anil Ambani-led Reliance Group is all set to pick up a significant minority stake in Nashik Vintners, the parent of India’s largest winemaker Sula.Ambani is teaming up with Singapore-based wine investor Ravi Vishwanathan to buy existing financial investor Everstone Private Equity’s 30% stake for Rs 200 crore, said multiple sources involved in the ongoing negotiations on condition of anonymity.Since last year, the company has been looking to rope in new investors and allow Everstone an exit, having mandated investment bank Avendus to launch a formal search.Several strategic and financial investors, including family offices, had participated in the process that ended recently, said one of the people mentioned above. The Ambani-Vishwanathan combine trumped aggressive offers from PremjiInvest and Analjit Singh’s family office, the people said.Global luxury giants such as LVMH’s investment wing L Capital and Thai Beverage were also reportedly in the fray to pick up a stake.Sula founder and Stanford alumnus Rajeev Samant and his family will continue as the largest shareholders with a 45% stake. Samant will remain CEO of the 15-year-old venture that he started after quitting his Silicon Valley job. He didn’t respond to queries on the latest development.Another existing financial investor, the Belgian Verlinvest family office, will also remain invested with a 25% stake.When contacted, a Reliance Capital spokesperson declined comment. Sources said the stake purchase will be a purely financial investment for Ambani. It is still not clear which arm of Reliance Capital will conclude the transaction, but it is unlikely to be the PE division.“It has great long-term prospects and the growth potential is huge. India is still among the lowest wine-consuming markets, but changing lifestyle habits are seeing a boom in the industry,” said an executive aware of the development on condition of anonymity as talks are still in the private domain.Sula controls 50% of the premium wine sales in the country and sells more than 500,000 cases. In FY13, it clocked around Rs 180 crore in revenue and an EBITDA margin of 15%. The proposed new investment would value the company at around Rs 666 crore.India is the 11th biggest wineconsuming country in the Asia-Pacific. Wine consumption in India is set to increase to 2.1 million cases by 2017, and that of red wine is seen growing 71.6% in the next three years. The share of imported wine is also set to increase to 480,000 cases in 2017 from 280,000 cases in 2013.Vishwanathan had led a small group of investors to emerge as the key shareholders of another local winemaker, Grover Zampa, in 2012. Reliance Capital had teamed up with him at that time as well.Vishwanathan, a wine aesthete himself, owns a large cellar in Burgundy, France, and has been a serial investor in several wine ventures. He hit the headlines in 2012 when he picked up a $40,000 bottle of champagne at an auction.Nashik, 180 km northeast of Mumbai, is now India’s largest grape-growing region.After quitting his Silicon Valley job in 1993, Stanford-trained engineer Samant investigated its agricultural prospects and found the region was on par with wine-growing regions in Spain, California and Australia. He teamed up with California winemaker Kerry Damskey to start a winery on Samant’s 30-acre family estate."
