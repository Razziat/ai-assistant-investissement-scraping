"LVMH Equity Unit Plows $175M into Rising E-tailer Secoo, Shaking Industry - Jing Daily","Tue, 10 Jul 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiJmh0dHBzOi8vamluZ2RhaWx5LmNvbS9wb3N0cy9sdm1oLXNlY29v0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The announcement of a powerhouse partnership between LVMH’s private equity arm L. Catterton, JD.com and Secoo threatens to remake the e-commerce world. The 175 million dollar investment will not only plow money into Secoo, but also strengthen the company's bond with luxury goods conglomerate LVMH - posing a threat to e-commerce competitors.

Within LVMH's portfolio of 70 of the world's most prestigious luxury brands, many of the merchants are already listed on Secoo's site. This includes fashion brands Celine, Dior, Fendi, Givenchy, Kenzo and Loewe, watchmakers Hublot, Zenith and Tag Heuer, spirit brand Hennessy, and cosmetics brands Guerlain and Fresh.

Secoo’s spokesperson told Jing Daily that the partnership with LVMH will allow Secoo to leverage the conglomerate’s strength in fashion and retail to further expand in the luxury market.

“Simply put, L Catterton portfolio companies will have a closer relationship with Secoo, Secoo will gain authorization from LVMH’s brands. LVMH will utilize its rich experiences in the luxury industry, human resources and brands to help Secoo better develop. ”

Although Secoo is a lesser-known name compared to e-commerce giants Alibaba and JD.com, since its establishment in 2008, it has quickly grabbed a dominant slice of the market thanks to its claim to offer authentic luxury goods. It now boasts 18 million members and more than 3,000 brands. In addition, Secoo’s fast-paced attempt to bridge the online-to-offline retail gap is another area attracting the attention of premium brands.

Secoo

Secoo’s new investor JD.com, launched its own high-end platform Toplife in October 2017, bringing into question how this new deal will shape the competition between the two.

In response, the spokesperson from JD.com said: “Secco is specifically for discounted luxury products, so it’s a very different segment of the market.”

However, Secoo has not openly positioned itself as selling only discounted goods, but as a luxury platform that offers more than just high-end fashion products. During April this year, Secoo rebranded itself to enter the lifestyle business, providing food, drink, and customized travel solutions as part of its strategy to connect with the upgraded consumption needs of Secoo’s existing high-end consumer segment.

Secoo agrees that they are not competitors and this deal makes it a win-win situation for both: “JD can benefit from our rich operational experience in the luxury industry, while Secoo can make full use of JD’s warehousing logistics, large membership base, and traffic.”

“From JD's perspective, having an investment stake in Secoo is going to be a good thing regardless of the fact that they already have the Toplife platform, ” commented Benjamin Cavender, Principal of China Market Research Group.

“At this stage, JD is still trying to strengthen its capabilities in the fashion and beauty categories, as well as continue establishing that JD and its partners can be seen to be offering more premium products and services than rival Alibaba.”

For JD, the fashion sector is not the strongest aspect of its business—they’re better known for gadgets—but they’ve clearly taken an interest in it. In the past year, JD has been expanding its fashion reach by forming new ties with British luxury shopping site Farfetch and discounted luxury e-commerce Vipshop, whose sales are primarily from female consumers, a demographic that JD.com has shown interest in reaching. The joint partnership between JD, Secoo, and L Catterton could offer JD an opportunity to broaden its product offering and consumer demographic, working with brands that Alibaba may not be able to access. Alibaba declined to comment on this issue.

“It seems that the market is preparing for a consolidated multi-brand digital luxury retail scenario,” said Luca Solca, sector head of luxury goods from French investment bank Exane BNP Paribas.

“One can think of a few high profile deals, such as Richemont recently taking over Yoox Net-A-Porter Group; JD securing a strategic investment in Farfetch, and now L Catterton investing in Secoo. I presume the expectation behind this is that digital distribution will be less fragmented than physical distribution – which can create a competitive advantage for those players in a position to control the few winning platforms.”

“It is early days to anticipate how all this will play out in the end, but it is a fascinating strategic development.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9934437274932861}",neutral,0.9934437274932861,0
Why LVMH scion won’t be wearing Virgil Abloh’s Louis Vuitton - South China Morning Post,"Tue, 24 Jul 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjbXAuY29tL2xpZmVzdHlsZS9mYXNoaW9uLWJlYXV0eS9hcnRpY2xlLzIxNTY2MTIvbHZtaC1zY2lvbi1jZWxlYnJhdGVzLWhpcy1hbnRpLXN0cmVldHdlYXItbGFiZWxzLWFuZC10YWxrc9IBeGh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLnNjbXAuY29tL2xpZmVzdHlsZS9mYXNoaW9uLWJlYXV0eS9hcnRpY2xlLzIxNTY2MTIvbHZtaC1zY2lvbi1jZWxlYnJhdGVzLWhpcy1hbnRpLXN0cmVldHdlYXItbGFiZWxzLWFuZC10YWxrcw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Arnault is the CEO of Berluti and chairman of Loro Piana and also the son of LVMH owner Bernard Arnault, France’s richest person. Last month Arnault – who has been working at LVMH since his early 20s, and is often rumoured, along with sister Delphine, as a possible heir to the throne – was named head of communication and image, a newly created role that will significantly increase his scope of responsibilities at the luxury conglomerate that his father has built.

In a menswear market where streetwear and casual attire are the flavour of the day, even at LVMH-owned brands such as Louis Vuitton and Dior, Antoine Arnault still believes in the power of a beautifully made suit from menswear brand Berluti or an expensive cashmere sweater from Italian clothier Loro Piana.

“The business at Loro Piana is doing very well and it’s so different [to] what is popular right now that I think it may be linked,” Arnault says when we meet in Paris during the couture shows in early July. “It’s the opposite of brands like Gucci and Off-White, not to disparage them, but perhaps at one point people say that this is enough and that they want something made with the best material – and that’s timeless and beautiful.

“It reassures me to see the sales figures of Loro Piana because it shows that it’s not just cynicism and making fun of your clients with delivery-boy T-shirts and things like that. It’s not my view of luxury or fashion, even if they do well.”

While Arnault’s new title at the company will have him deal with every maison under the LVMH umbrella, from Fendi to Sephora and Moet Chandon, his duties at Berluti and Loro Piana remain unchanged.

My father was called ‘the wolf in the cashmere coat’. It was the opposite of reality so we decided to act and I said, why not open our doors? Antoine Arnault

“I like to respect my customers. It takes eight to nine months for a Berluti client to get a pair of custom-made shoes and it’s fine. I was always against see now/buy now, as I don’t think it’s relevant to what we do and is not a good image of luxury.

“If I know how long it takes for the artisans to make those products, I will appreciate it more. [The see-now-buy-now trend] is counter-nature to what luxury is. People understand when they come and see why it takes long. For a luxury brand to show one day and sell one hour later, what is that?”

When challenged about the streetwear-heavy menswear offerings at LVMH brands Louis Vuitton and Dior, whose creative directors are, respectively, Virgil Abloh of Off-White and Kim Jones, Arnault is quick to point out that “not every brand is for everybody”.

“Dior is not going to be for a 60-year-old gentleman who wants to look like someone from Mad Men, and I think it’s fine, as we can’t cater to everyone. Virgil understands that, too, and his collection for Louis Vuitton isn’t going to be for everyone. I won’t be able to wear it, for instance,” he says.

“I don’t know if it’s going to alienate customers, because at Vuitton the accessories are very strong and more mainstream, and that aspect will last for very long. But that little sparkle at the top of the iceberg makes things cool and you’ll still sell briefcases with the Louis Vuitton monogram. But have that cool factor coming from Virgil, even if you don’t wear Virgil.

“In terms of ready-to-wear, yes, I don’t think that my father will wear Kim Jones’ suits, but he’ll come to Berluti now,” Arnault says.

A factor that certainly played a role in Arnault’s recent promotion is his active role in shaking up the image of the company with a series of outreach projects, such as Les Journées Particulières, a weekend of events and demonstrations open to the public.

From Italy to New Zealand, France to Argentina, 77 LVMH workshops and factories open their doors and people from all walks of life get to see how luxury products are made and interact with the artisans behind them (the fourth edition will take place from October 12 to 14).

The Chaumet headquarters on Place Vendome in Paris will be thrown open to the public one weekend in October, as part of LVMH Les Journées Particulières.

“It came out of a bad place,” Arnault says matter-of-factly. “Usually bad things come out of bad places but this time a good thing came out of a bad situation.”

As Arnault sees it, LVMH was being unfairly portrayed in the media, especially after the attempted takeover of Hermès in 2014, which generated lots of negative coverage and significantly impacted the image of the company.

The Louis Vuitton fragrance-making facility in the South of France will be open to the public for a weekend in October.

“It was our responsibility, not the media’s fault,” Arnault explains, “but everyone talking about LVMH was very negative, saying that we were hyper capitalists and only cared about profits and not about the long-term view of our brands, and that we just wanted to milk brands.

It reassures me to see the sales figures of Loro Piana because it shows that it’s not just cynicism and making fun of your clients with delivery-boy T-shirts and things like that. It’s not my view of luxury or fashion, even if they do well Antoine Arnault

“It was the Hermès deal and they did a great job brainwashing the market, and during those six months all these negative articles came out.”

Since acquiring a textile company that owned Christian Dior in 1984, Bernard Arnault has built what is now LVMH into the largest luxury group in the world (and the one with the highest market capitalisation on the French stock market). Arnault went on a “shopping spree”, acquiring a number of previously family-owned private companies such as Fendi, Bulgari, Givenchy and Dom Perignon, as well as retail chains such as DFS and Sephora.

“My father was called ‘the wolf in the cashmere coat’,” says Antoine. “It was the opposite of reality so we decided to act and I said, why not open our doors? In many competitive worlds like luxury, things are done behind closed doors and with secrecy, so one day I had a eureka moment: for one weekend we show everything, full transparency, forget about business or commerce and showcase our work.”

Backstage at the Louis Vuitton spring/summer 2019 by Virgil Abloh of Off-White. Of Loro Piana, another brand in the LVMH stable, Arnault says: “It’s the opposite of brands like Gucci and Off-White, not to disparage them.”

While he admits that, in an era of social-media frenzies and clickbait, he’s become more guarded when speaking publicly, Arnault does not mince words when talking about matters he feels strongly about. Besides the backlash against LVMH’s expansion, another issue he cares deeply about is the plight of models in the industry (he is famously attached to Russian supermodel Natalia Vodianova, with whom he has two children).

Last year, in an unprecedented move, LVMH and arch-rival luxury group Kering partnered to release a model safety charter in response to reported episodes of mistreatment and abuse.

“It was before #MeToo and it was the elephant in the room,” says Arnault. “Everybody knew that things were happening and that at one point someone had to take a stand. Then a few events happened and triggered our decision to start doing something officially, saying that if something bad happens it’s also damaging for us as a company, not just models.

… That’s what we offer to our customers, not just because market research says that this year the Chinese will love this colour or something Antoine Arnault

“At the same time, I heard that Kering was also writing a charter and I thought that this was a moment when we could work together. It really changed things because, whether it’s model agencies or casting directors, they don’t want to lose their biggest clients, so they’re treating girls much differently and it’s going in the right direction.”

He’s also blunt when talking about the rising power of Asian consumers, who are now being courted by luxury brands left, right and centre, and is at pains to emphasise that LVMH never does things specifically to target a particular market.

“It’s not how we think of luxury,” he says. “We trust our designers to envision the future of fashion and of course we make adjustments, but in the end that’s what we offer to our customers, not just because market research says that this year the Chinese will love this colour or something. We don’t do marketing it that sense and we don’t follow market studies but only offer our products.”

While Arnault won’t share much about succession plans at the group, he’s adamant that his father and siblings are in it for the long run.

“It’s more of a family company than ever,” he says. “My father will be there for at least another good 15 years and then you have my sister and me and my three brothers. It doesn’t get more family than that.

“We’re very interested and involved in the business and in a way we’re lucky because we have different types of personalities, the five of us, and I think that everybody can find their domain of competency to bring to the group and to my father.

“This is how we feel, how we need it and want it to remain.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999805688858032}",neutral,0.9999805688858032,0

Accoridng to LVMH, highlights of the first half of 2018 include “strong growth in Asia and the United States,” “outstanding momentum at Louis Vuitton, where profitability remains at an exceptional level,” “success of new products at Christian Dior across all product lines,” and “Sephora’s strong revenue growth in stores and online.”","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9999998807907104}",positive,0.9999998807907104,1

is close to acquiring a new perfume brand, , for its portfolio and has done it very much on the quiet.







Founder Jean Patou - Image: Jean Patou





The giant French conglomerate took management control of Patou last year without any fanfare from Designer Parfums, a UK group based in Watford north of London, which is owned by Mehta business family.



Already on September 6, 2017, the board of Jean Patou appointed to be its new chairman, replacing Mehta, the 28-year-old daughter of Dilesh Mehta, the CEO and founder of Designer Parfums.

A LVMH board member, Toledano was at the time the CEO of Christian . In January he became the President of LVMH Fashion Group, which controls a series of important fashion houses including , , , Pucci, and .



Moreover, Jean Patou’s headquarters are now listed at 24 rue Jean Goujon, also the location of LVMH’s Fashion Group main headquarters. While Nikita Mehta is now listed on her LinkedIn page as a Assistant Manager for LVMH.



Spokespeople for LVMH and its Fashion Group both declined to comment on the acquisition. While Toledano did not respond to repeated calls.



However, Dilesh Mehta confirmed to that Designer Parfums is close to inking a strategic partnership with LVMH, to split the ownership of the famed perfume house.



“I have signed an NDA and cannot say anything more. This should be completed in September. We believe that it’s vital for the future growth of Patou that we develop a fashion department, and nobody is really better at that than LVMH,” said Mehta.

The attractions of a brand like Patou are multiple to , the chairman and controlling shareholder of LVMH, whose perfume and beauty division already includes Christian Dior, , , ; the perfume businesses of its designer houses Givenchy, , and Kenzo, as well as the giant scent and beauty retailer .



A legendary perfume brand dating back to 1912, when founder Jean Patou opened his fashion house, before closing it during World War I, and reopening it after he returned from the front.



A true dandy who is credited with creating the first designer ties, Patou launched his perfume business with three scents in 1925. A noted innovator, his Huile de Chaldée is often referred to as the first suntan lotion. However, the best-known perfume of Patou, who died in 1936, is Joy, a rose and floral scent that was at one stage the costliest perfume in the world.



Moreover, Patou is a famous French label which has not been sullied by over-expansion in grey markets; and boasts a brilliant reputation. In 2000, the FIFI Awards, the Oscars of perfume, named Joy the “Scent of the Century,” beating out rival No. 5. The house of Patou also has a very credible fashion DNA, since such noted designers as , Jean-Paul Gaultier and were all at different stages its designer.



Designer Parfums, which acquired Patou from in 2011, still controls a stable of perfumes including Frédéric Fekkai, Naomi Campbell, , Parfums Scherrer, , , Ghost and .



Back in 2013, Patou’s previous president Bruno Cottard revealed plans to reintroduce fashion, but this did not happen. Expect that to change pretty rapidly when the LVMH deal is completed.



This partnership will also complete a circle. Patou exited fashion when its then-couturier Christian Lacroix quit the brand to found his own house in 1987. The name of his backer? Bernard Arnault.

The New York-based designer subverting masculine stereotypes - Dazed,"Wed, 11 Jul 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhemVkZGlnaXRhbC5jb20vZmFzaGlvbi9hcnRpY2xlLzQwNjU1LzEvbmVpbC1ncm90emluZ2VyLW5paGwtbmV3LXlvcmstbWVuc3dlYXItbHZtaC1tYXNjdWxpbml0edIBcmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhemVkZGlnaXRhbC5jb20vZmFzaGlvbi9hcnRpY2xlLzQwNjU1LzEvbmVpbC1ncm90emluZ2VyLW5paGwtbmV3LXlvcmstbWVuc3dlYXItbHZtaC1tYXNjdWxpbml0eT9hbXA9MQ?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Neil Grotzinger’s label Nihl takes traditional tropes and throws sequins at them

Over the past few years, the menswear fashion schedule has quickly moved away from the stuffy, suited aesthetic that it became known for: particularly in London, where labels like Charles Jeffrey’s Loverboy and Art School are redefining what menswear can be. In New York, the name at the forefront of this new school of design is Nihl, which was founded and designed by Neil Grotzinger. Shaped by his childhood growing up in Colorado (“It’s a very religious and militant part of the world,” he tells us) Grotzinger’s label looks to put forward a different idea of masculinity. “It’s really just about subversion of masculine stereotypes,” he says. “I utilise that framework and set it up for every collection but just establish different stereotypes each time.” This manifests in the form of intricate embellishments on items of clothing that have typically masculine connotations. Think wrestling singlets and shirting covered in a rainbow of sequins, as well as the frequent use of jockstraps as decoration rather than for athletic function. While the brand is still fairly new, Grotzinger found himself one of the semi-finalists of the 2018 LVMH Prize, along with the likes of Eckhaus Latta, GmbH, and Dazed 100er Ludovic de Saint Sernin. For SS19, it also saw him invited by the CFDA to present on it’s NYFWM schedule, in what was the designer’s first show since his graduate collection. “I wanted to start doing shows again to bring this idea of performance and grandness. I want it to become understood as something that’s constantly progressing this dialogue forward,” Grotzinger continues. Here, we speak to the designer following his SS19 collection.

What was you path into the fashion industry? Neil Grotzinger: I used to work for Marc Jacobs and Diane von Furstenberg as a technical embroidery designer. I would always design beadwork and embellishment for different designers, so that’s where I honed in on that skill, within the industry. I was always working as a womenswear designer and I wanted to do menswear, but I got to learn that skillset really well as a part of all these womenswear teams. After a while, I felt like ‘okay, I understand this practice now and I want to apply to it what I want to do.’ I didn’t want to just keep working on dresses that I had no real relationship towards. Your label explores ideas of masculinity. Why is that important to you? Neil Grotzinger: It was one of those things that subconsciously I always had something to say about, but maybe it didn’t necessarily come to the tip of my tongue up until the point I was actually back in school. The fact that I was a womenswear designer helped me to understand that in a big way, because I couldn’t understand why I didn’t feel as attached to what I was doing. It got to a certain point where I was always thinking about clothes for myself outside of work, and I always got a lot of gratification from that because I wasn’t just making something I could buy in a store. It was always about making something that I knew that I would never have access to. “I was always thinking about clothes for myself outside of work, because I wasn’t just making something I could buy in a store. It was always about making something that I knew that I would never have access to” – Neil Grotzinger

What does the masculinity you’re creating mean to you? Is it aspirational? Neil Grotzinger: I definitely think it’s aspirational. It’s about constructing the argument as well. I think moving forward it’s going to be more about how far into the gender neutral grey area we can go while still maintaining a sense of masculinity. At the beginning it was really all about just constructing the argument first so that people could understand this is what is required to get everyone to see masculinity as something else. Do you think heterosexual men would be interested in what you’re proposing? Neil Grotzinger: I think there are certain sized straight men who would be interested and certain sized straight men who do wear it – it’s not that it’s intended to be only for the queer-identifying person. I think a lot of queer-identifying people immediately latched onto my work just based on having that same suspicion of like ‘I feel like no one is making this right now but I’ve always wanted to see it.’ That’s who is in my head when I'm designing, but if other people want to wear it that’s fine and I’m happier for it. Like, women wear my clothes all the time and they always look incredible – it has a broader outreach.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.999997615814209}",neutral,0.999997615814209,0

Buoyed by strong demand in Asia and the United States, the company’s organic revenue grew 12 percent from the year before, reaching a total of 21.8 billion euros (25.5 billion). In the second quarter alone, its revenue increased by 11 percent compared to the same period of 2017. The strong performance is in line with the trends of the beginning of the year.

LVMH’s core business group “Fashion & Leather Goods” grew by 15 percent, with Louis Vuitton performing exceptionally well. The arrival of two star menswear creative talents Virgil Abloh and Kim Jones for Louis Vuitton and Christian Dior, respectively, is projected to bring new momentum to brands, the press release stated . The massive demand in China, in particular, benefited the performance of the “Wine & Spirits” and the “Watches & Jewelry” businesses.

Ahead of the earnings release, many financial analysts signaled the concern of a slowing Chinese demand caused by the ongoing trade disputes between China and the United. So far, the tariffs imposed by the U.S. government on China has led the Chinese currency to fall to a one-year low and dragged down the country’s stock market into a bear.

In the conference call with financial analysts and reporters, Jean-Jacques Guiony, chief financial officer (CFO) of LVMH said, “I understand the threat is there but I don’t think it has materialized in any way [yet],” pointing out demand from China in Q2 actually slightly improved compared to that of Q1 for LVMH.

Many of the questions from financial analysts during the call concern the Chinese economy as the company is heavily exposed to it.

Later last week, another French luxury powerhouse Hermès also expressed an optimistic outlook on the impact of the trade war on its business. The brand’s CEO Axel Dumas said he saw no immediate impact on Hermès.

To combat monetary and geopolitical uncertainties, LVMH said it will continue focusing on product innovation and geographic expansion in promising markets.

Meanwhile, recognizing the company’s sophisticated development on the digital front, Guiony stressed the importance of forming an omnichannel retail network to meet the needs of consumers.

“Most consumers start a journey with a brand on the website, and continue in the store, and then maybe end up again online with delivery. That’s a behavior of most customers,” he said.

In Europe, the share of LVMH rose 2.75 percent during the trading time to end at 301.10 euros (351.7) today.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9999992847442627}",positive,0.9999992847442627,1

The United States, Asia and Europe experienced good growth.

Watches & Jewelry

The Watches & Jewelry business group recorded organic revenue growth of 16%. Profit from recurring operations was up 46%. Bvlgari had an excellent first half and continued to gain market share. This performance was especially notable in jewelry and in the Chinese and American markets. The iconic lines Serpenti, B-Zero 1, Diva and Octo made strong progress.

Chaumet unveiled its new high-end jewelry collection.

The momentum at TAG Heuer was reflected in the innovations of its flagship collections Carrera, Aquaracer and Formula 1, and a smaller version of its smart watch was launched.

DFS experiences 'rebound of profitability' in H1 2018 - DFNIonline.com,"Tue, 24 Jul 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRmbmlvbmxpbmUuY29tL2xlYWQtc3Rvcmllcy9kZnMtbHZtaC1yZXN1bHRzLWZvci1oMS0yMDE4LTI0LTA3LTIwMTgv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The luxury giant, which is active as a retailer via the DFS brand, posted its results for the first half of 2018 this afternoon. The figures show a 39% increase in revenue for LVMH’s selective retailing business, which includes DFS. Profits in the sector are up to €612m from €441m in the same period last year.

The report details strong performance for DFS in Hong Kong and Macao, while its T Gallerias in Cambodia and Italy made “good progress”. The T Galleria in Sydney has also experienced a positive performance since it reopened.

Late last year DFS lost the concessions contract at Hong Kong International Airport, which the company reports was making a loss. No longer holding the Hong Kong contract has contributed to the growth in the first half of 2018; selective retailing posting organic growth of 9% during the period, but that increases to 15% if the closure of concessions at Hong Kong is excluded.

A report accompanying the figures said: “[The strong performance of selective retailing] was driven by DFS, which was favorably impacted by the expiry, at the end of 2017, of the concessions at the Hong Kong International Airport and by the increase of Chinese tourists to regions where DFS operates.”

It continued: “DFS continued to benefit from the upturn in its markets. Two key shopping periods in Asia – the New Year and Japan’s ‘Golden Week’ – saw particularly strong results. With steadily rising tourist numbers and offerings in keeping with the spirit of each destination, the recently opened stores in Venice and at Siem Reap in Cambodia achieved excellent results.

“Highlights of the first half of the year included the reopening of the T Galleria in Sydney’s business district and the inauguration of two new stores devoted to beauty products in Macau. DFS expanded its digital initiatives to better serve travellers and streamline their shopping experience. Sales made to Loyal T rewards programme members reached record levels.”

The cruise market is also supporting LVMH’s ongoing growth, the company stated: “Starboard Cruise Services strengthened its position as the premier retailer of luxury brands in the cruise industry by expanding its presence in Asia. The company further enhanced the attractiveness of its stores while improving the quality of its product offerings and the experiences created for its customers.”

To maintain its strong results DFS is carrying out renovations of its flagship stores in Canton Road, Hong Kong and San Francisco International Airport. It is also set to develop its digital marketing and enhance customer relations.

Strong performance

The strong retail results are part of an impressive performance for LVMH during the period. Revenue for the company as a whole hit €21.8 billion, which marks an increase of 10% year-on-year.

LVMH Chairman and CEO Bernard Arnault said: “The excellent results of the first half of the year attest to the strong desirability of our brands and the effectiveness of our strategy. The performance of the first half is even more remarkable given the unfavorable currency environment.

“The standards of quality and creativity required from our Maisons, which combine both modernity and tradition, are key to LVMH’s success, always driven by a long-term vision. Despite buoyant global demand, monetary and geopolitical uncertainties remain. In this context, we will stay vigilant and rely on the talent of our teams and the shared entrepreneurial passion to further increase our leadership in the world of high-quality products in 2018.”

The company experienced good growth in Asia and the United States and there was strong performance from Louis Vuitton, Christian Dior, Bvlgari and across the wine and spirits categories.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 1.0}",positive,1.0,1
Bono and Ali’s fashion label Edun winds down - IrishCentral,"Thu, 05 Jul 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmlyaXNoY2VudHJhbC5jb20vbmV3cy9pcmlzaHZvaWNlL2Jvbm8tYWxpLWhld3Nvbi1mYXNoaW9uLWVkdW7SAU1odHRwczovL3d3dy5pcmlzaGNlbnRyYWwuY29tL25ld3MvaXJpc2h2b2ljZS9ib25vLWFsaS1oZXdzb24tZmFzaGlvbi1lZHVuLmFtcA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Ethical fashion label Edun, founded by Bono and his wife, Ali Hewson, in 2004, is winding down operations.

Looks like Bono’s foray into the world of high fashion has come to an end. Edun, the label he co-founded with his wife Ali Hewson in 2004 as a way to showcase African talent and materials – all ethically produced – was cut loose by its parent company LVMH last month and is in the process of winding down its operations.

LVMH – makers of Louis Vuitton, Moet-Hennessey and several other luxury brands – returned its 49 percent stake to Bono and Ali, and Edun issued a statement confirming the change.

“In light of a joint review of the business, Edun is restructuring its operations in preparation for its next chapter and LVMH will transfer its shares back to the founders,” a representative for Edun told website Business of Fashion.

“The founders remain committed to Edun’s mission for sustainable fashion and thank LVMH for its support and dedication during this journey together.”

What's the buzz with Edun? Makes us wonder how the other celebrity brands are doing out there. #sustainablefashion #ecofashion https://t.co/AfcQQqBEUz

Edun’s financial operations are based in Ireland, and its lost money for several years now. Its only storefront in Manhattan shut in May, and its spring/summer 2018 collection is apparently Edun’s final one, for now anyway.

“Edun received early attention -- and accolades -- for its support of sustainable development in Africa, from agriculture to manufacturing. For instance, it worked for six years with 8,000 farmers in Northwest Uganda on growing cotton,” the website Business of Fashion reported.

“However, Edun failed to establish a coherent visual identity and pricing strategy. And as with many of its mission-driven peers … the challenges of producing consistent product in developing regions created back-end bottlenecks. Today, the industry as a whole is investing more in African manufacturing and production, partially thanks to Edun’s efforts. In many ways, the company suffered from the disadvantages of being a first-mover.”

"Arnault: LVMH to Open Design Houses, Roll Out the Red Carpet for Chinese Guests - Jing Daily","Tue, 03 Jul 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiLmh0dHBzOi8vamluZ2RhaWx5LmNvbS9wb3N0cy9sdm1oLWRlc2lnbi1ob3VzZXPSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"From its modest beginnings in the construction industry, Antoine Arnault’s father Bernard Arnault has built LVMH into the world’s largest luxury empire. However, the group that owns Louis Vuitton, Christian Dior and dozens of other prestigious brands can be perceived as a distant giant. As a representative of the giant’s younger generation, Antoine, recently appointed to lead ‪global communication‬ for LVMH, feels responsible to change that dated perception. Sitting down with Jing Daily at a recent interview in Paris, he noted: “When I visit workshops, I am always touched by the genuine passion, vibrant energy and a strong sense of belonging and pride of our artisans. They are truly the soul of LVMH.”

So why not open the doors of Maisons and let these “backstage heroes” share their stories? In 2011, Antoine initiated Les Journées Particulières, a now-famous event that invited the public to step inside the design houses for the first time and interact with the artisans. Over 100,000 visitors turned up over two days. “I was happy to see people who are not our usual customers,” he says. “Some students came very early in the morning and waited for three hours to get in.”

This year, the fourth edition of Les Journées Particulières will take place from October 12 to 14‬. It’s going global, with 76 venues across four continents—and this time around features a particular marketing push towards Chinese consumers, who are making up an expanding slice of LVMH’s business. In the first quarter of 2018, LVMH reported a 13 percent rise in sales over the year-earlier quarter and specifically cited Chinese demand as the reason for the faster-than-expected growth.

At the recent launch event in Paris, we caught up with Antoine, who continues his roles as Chairman of Italian knitwear brand Loro Piana and CEO of menswear house Berluti, to understand why the event is special and in particular how it is targeting Chinese who are keen to savor luxury and culture.

For our Chinese guests, it will be a perfect opportunity to see who, where and how our products are made. “Event in event” surprises await them too, such as live performances, film screenings, and even unexpected encounters. Imagine when they are at the perfume workshop of Maison Francis Kurkdjian and suddenly the master perfumer comes in. Wouldn’t it be nice to hear him talk about his inspirations and approach to perfume making? And how about having a drink with our artisans?

We will facilitate Chinese visitors to enjoy Les Journées Particulières, with the event app in Chinese and Chinese-speaking guides at some key sites. A series of podcasts including candid conversations and sound tours with our artisans will also be released, to enrich the experience.

A keyhole metaphor is used to entice the public to peek into LVMH world of art and craftsmanship. Courtesy photo

Everyone is welcome and there is absolutely no barrier to entry. I want to emphasize again that it is not for clients or VIPs.

Interested visitors can create an online profile from September 13 on and register between ‪September 24 and 30 to reserve a fast pass. Last time, tickets for Louis Vuitton and Christian Dior visits got snapped up in less than one minute. Of course, they could also come spontaneously but maybe queue for a few hours. We expect over 150,000 visitors this year.

Whichever brands they enjoy, they can go visit and experience luxury and culture on a whole new level. For example, on Friday morning they can go to Givenchy’s Haute Couture salon in Paris and then take the train to visit the Champagne vineyards in the afternoon. Since many Chinese will travel abroad near the Golden Week, they should not miss this golden opportunity!

Speaking from my heart, I would suggest Berluti. At Berluti’s bespoke shoes workshop, Chinese guests could explore the art of patina (coloring and bleaching leather techniques that give each Berluti shoe a distinctive identity) and meet our master shoemakers. I know them personally and some have been working there for over 30 years. Once they even created “Shanghai night” style Berluti.

If someone orders a pair of Berluti shoes today, he has to wait over a year to receive it. But people don’t mind and our bookings are always full. I am against this “see now, buy now” shopping model. For me, it kills luxury. At Berluti, we let the craftsmen take the time and patience to craft each pair to the finest quality. I hope through this visit, people will appreciate that true craftsmanship takes time.

Many people think we only sell in China and there is nothing to see, but we do have some intriguing places such as a Chandon winery in Ningxia, northwestern China. Long daylight hours, well-irrigated soil and a protected environment make it ideal for growing grapes. Since 2013, we have been blending age-old French savoir-faire with Chinese modernity to make sparkling wine that is slightly sweet and a good partner with Chinese cuisine. However, there are some concerns such as the long travel distance from major cities to Ningxia. So we are still assessing the best possibilities.

We don’t do marketing the way people think. There are no market or trends studies. We don’t think “okay, Chinese like red. Let’s do something red.” We trust our designers to create products that connect with our customers and we give them that creative freedom. What we do is to place products beautifully in the stores and plan some campaigns around what they create.

In mid-June, we chose Shanghai to host our first “DARE” initiative outside Europe. The internal call for ideas went to nearly 6000 employees in the Asia-Pacific region and eventually, 60 were selected to turn the ideas into business plans. Three winning ideas are going to be implemented, including customizing luxury goods in a sustainable way.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9996592998504639}",neutral,0.9996592998504639,0

PARIS, France — Whether Marie Antoinette's sartorial splendour at the court of Versailles, La Belle Époque's poised perfectionism or Coco Chanel's corset-less courage post-World War I, the city of lights sits undisputed as fashion's capital.

The city is home to the industry's most respected and accomplished savoir-faire maisons, like Lesage and Lemarié, traditional pleaters like Lognon, and button-makers and milliners such as Gossens and Maison Michel. Within Paris also reside the luxury industry's most successful and profitable conglomerates, with LVMH as the largest, led by Bernard Arnault. The group includes cash-cow Louis Vuitton, which analysts estimate generates almost $12 billion in revenue and $5 billion in operating profit, as well as Christian Dior, which generates over $2 billion in revenues, Fendi, Givenchy, Céline, Loewe, Kenzo and Marc Jacobs.

Kering, led by François-Henri Pinault, has controlling stakes in Alexander McQueen, Bottega Veneta and Brioni, among others. ""Kering is the natural challenger. Not only does it harbour multi-category ambitions, it is pushing forward on its newly found successes with Gucci, Saint Laurent and Balenciaga,"" writes Luca Solca, head of luxury at BNP Paribas. This year, Kering's Gucci aims to reach $10 billion euros in annual sales, hoping to usurp LVMH's Louis Vuitton as the luxury brand with the highest global sales.

Paris is also home to fashion’s most impressive independent maisons like Hermès and Chanel, the latter nestled in the now iconic Rue Cambon since 1910, acting as the jewel in fashion’s crown in terms of brand desirability. Chanel also revealed its financial reports for the first time in June, showing its annual sales in 2017 as $9.6 billion – just behind Louis Vuitton. Chanel’s chief financial officer Philippe Blondiaux assured the publishing of results was not preceding a stock market listing and placated any suspicions the privately-owned company would be sold soon.

However, the city of lights and love is no longer exclusively orientated around traditional luxury houses. The once slightly staid if chic capital has a new energy, with design movements emerging around streetwear sensibilities thanks to the likes of Pigalle, Avoc, Magenta, Etudes Studio and Drole de Monsieur. Meanwhile new names in ready-to-wear such as Marine Serre, Y/Projects, Koche and Jacquemus continue to grow in standing on the international stage.

How Louis Vuitton Upped Its Digital Game in China - Jing Daily,"Thu, 26 Jul 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiN2h0dHBzOi8vamluZ2RhaWx5LmNvbS9wb3N0cy9sb3Vpcy12dWl0dG9uLWRpZ2l0YWwtY2hpbmHSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"From cutting prices on the mainland to extending its e-commerce reach across China, French powerhouse Louis Vuitton has been aggressively upgrading its offerings for Chinese consumers in recent weeks. As the strongest performer among the LVMH group, Louis Vuitton ranked No. 2 of 91 luxury brands across fashion and watches & jewelry sectors in the latest Digital IQ Index: China Luxury Report, by digital intelligence company Gartner L2. This far exceeded its previous rankings: No. 9 in 2017 and No. 10 in 2016.

With information provided by the brand, here Jing Daily highlights its online growth, and the top three reasons why Louis Vuitton has overtaken others in China's digital race.

Louis Vuitton was the first luxury brand to open a WeChat service account in 2012, realizing the intimate nature of this one-on-one message tool, and creating a customer-centric WeChat strategy.

According to the Garner L2 report, Louis Vuitton boasts the most sophisticated brand zone feature on WeChat. Brand zone is a WeChat function that allows labels the opportunity to have a ‘micro-homepage’ with a comprehensive listing of information and content. When searching Louis Vuitton on WeChat, the brand zone homepage will be the first result to appear, linking to commerce, account, live chat customer service, and even seasonal features like Chinese New Year Stickers. This clear structure allows consumers to access brand content easily and keep up to date accordingly.

Even though Louis Vuitton's .cn website doesn’t have a live chat option, the customer can send direct messages to Louis Vuitton’s WeChat account to receive answers from the in-house client servicing team. In order to receive geographically tailored content, customers who use the official WeChat account are asked to agree to share their current location with Louis Vuitton.

Since the launch of its Chinese site in the early 1990's, Louis Vuitton has given customers the ability to place orders online and pick them up in store. This in-person touch point allows the customer to experience the kind of high-level service they might expect from a luxury brand, and ask any questions to sales associates.

However, since adding an e-commerce function last year, the brand has seen a 14 percent rise in visitors to its Chinese site, becoming the highest retail sales channel for Louis Vuitton China. The brand puts incentives in place to encourage online shopping, and even in traditional offline stores sales associates gain commission if the customer places an order using an in-store iPad.

Notably, the average customer age on Louis Vuitton's .cn site is five years younger than Louis Vuitton’s other flagship sites worldwide. The Chinese website is thus a useful gateway to entice young consumers, with the brand's omnichannel selling strategy working to attract these customers into stores.

Louis Vuitton has long been an early adopter of investing in SEO and social search strategies, deploying targeted ad posts on Weibo as early as 2014. Shortly after, the brand experimented with WeChat moment ads. From April 2017 to April 2018, Louis Vuitton was the number one brand most likely to appear at the top of non-specific fashion searches on Baidu mobile.

As a highlight of the brand's smart search strategy, Louis Vuitton worked with Baidu Artificial Intelligence lab, using facial recognition technology to create a 'fragrance diagnosis tool."" This system targeted consumers who had searched Louis Vuitton/competitor/industry related keywords with a relevant advertisement. To participate, a customer would upload a profile picture. Then, according to their own facial features, the system would match the user with a similar celebrity face - in turn matching them with one of the seven Louis Vuitton perfumes.

Below is Louis Vuitton's digital milestone from 2009 to 2018:","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9964045286178589}",positive,0.9964045286178589,1

It's a lifestyle place, where as a customer, you can get inspiration on the art of hosting.” A quick browse on Clos19.com today, for example, might see a customer come away with a set of hand-blown glass Campbell-Rey straws produced on the island of Murano in the Venetian lagoon (dishwasher friendly!) and a one-of-a-kind trip to the Veuve Clicquot and Moët & Chandon maisons during the harvest time, when they are usually on total lock down.

“We're not just selling you a bottle. We're not just telling you a beautiful story,” she continues. ""If you want to really live it, we take care of everything to make you live a beautiful moment. It's a modern type of luxury.” Her cousin, Alexandre Arnault, the 25-year-old LVMH protégé, has also placed this experiential economy at the core of his revamp of Rimowa. ""The next generation is seeking a more intense life than the last one, so we must service this,"" he told the CNI Luxury Conference in April of his peers wish to spend their money on experiences they can share on social media. “Social networks have redefined the balance of desirability…Snapping and sharing images makes them valuable.”

Watine Arnault conceived the idea of Clos19 when working in the innovation group of Moët Hennessy. “I realised that nobody was talking to me or my generation, it was all for connoisseurs,” she recalls. “The technical aspects – the right temperature, the right glass, the right pairing for champagne – can be a bit boring. But, if you look at it from a lifestyle perspective, where you can set a scene, it can become very playful.” Accordingly, the name is inspired by the democratisation of Champagne in the 19th Century, hence the “19”. And she doesn’t categorise her customers, because she doesn’t feel it’s relevant: “I think it is really more about people who just want to enjoy life.""

Before Moët Hennessy, she racked up stints at Marc Jacobs and Louis Vuitton, scooping up a business degree from INSEAD (European Institute of Business Administration) along the way. ""I never really planned to end up where I am,"" she concedes. A book she discovered owned by Madame Clicquot, where the ""Grande Dame of champagne"" kept personal notes on all her customers, spurred Watine Arnault on to make her love for customer communication and personalisation a business proposition. And she loves hosting a party.

""It's really about the people you bring together,” she says of orchestrating the perfect occasion. “What I find today is that people lose the personal link through smartphones and things like that. Put people together that are going to take something out of the moment.” No iPhones, but plenty of Krug, Ruinart, Dom Perignon or Möet. Now that is a lifestyle the Arnaults know plenty will buy into.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999707937240601}",neutral,0.9999707937240601,0

Second-quarter sales rose 11 percent, the Paris-based owner of Louis Vuitton handbags and Sephora cosmetics said in a statement late Tuesday, beating analysts’ expectations. The world’s largest luxury company reported double-digit percentage growth in sectors from fashion to jewelry and cosmetics. The shares rose as much as 2.6 percent early yesterday in Paris.

LVMH has so far thrived despite the opening rounds of a global trade war, as the Chinese consumer’s appetite for French luxury goods surged during the quarter. But because of the threat of higher tariffs and other economic uncertainties, “the current trends cannot realistically be extrapolated to the second half of the year,” Chief Financial Officer Jean-Jacques Guiony said on a call.

“Management sounded quite confident, despite ongoing concerns about Chinese demand and tougher comps,” Raymond James analyst Hermine de Bentzmann wrote, adding that the result augured well for Kering.

Chinese consumers account for roughly a third of luxury purchases, according to consulting firm BCG – and as much as 70 percent of the sector’s growth. LVMH sales in Asia surged 17 percent last year, and traveling Chinese shoppers lifted other markets. Now, investors are watching carefully to see how long the boom can last for luxury’s leader, especially as U.S. President Donald Trump’s trade moves risk shaking confidence in the industry’s biggest client base.

“The threats are there but I don’t think they have materialized yet in any way,” Guiony said.

Shanghai’s CSI 300 stock index has fallen 11 percent this year, fueling fears that high-end shoppers could tighten their belts. China moved to bolster consumption by lowering import duties on many products earlier this month, and luxury brands including Louis Vuitton and Hermes have cut prices to pass the benefit on to consumers.

The company said its coming product launches include new perfumes from Christian Dior, endorsed by Jennifer Lawrence, and Givenchy, promoted by Rooney Mara. A Guerlain skin serum and a Chinese launch of the Kenzo World line are among the other debuts.

The plans come as LVMH’s competitors have thrown down the gauntlet in recent months. Gucci set a midterm sales target that would rival estimates for Louis Vuitton, long the world’s largest luxury brand with more than 9 billion euros in annual sales. Chanel released its yearly financials for the first time in 108 years – at the same time as Vuitton’s most recent fashion show – to reveal that its sales of quilted leather handbags and No. 5 perfume had already bested Vuitton by some measures.

In a bid to keep its edge, LVMH has reshuffled the creative leadership at its biggest fashion brands in recent months. Designer Hedi Slimane, who set the menswear agenda for more than a decade with skinny jeans and suits at Dior Homme and Kering’s Saint Laurent, has been tapped to add menswear and haute couture at LVMH’s womenswear brand Celine, with his first shows this fall. New menswear chiefs at Vuitton and Christian Dior both made their debuts in June.

LVMH’s first-half profit was boosted by rapid growth at Vuitton and the exit of a duty-free concession at the Hong Kong airport. Sales in the second quarter totaled 10.9 billion euros (USD12.7 billion), above analysts’ prediction of 10.79 billion euros.
