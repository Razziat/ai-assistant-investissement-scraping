Hermès to LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton: Sell Your Shares - The Fashion Law,"Mon, 31 Mar 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiPmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWZhc2hpb25sYXcuY29tL2hlcm1lcy10by1sdm1oLXNlbGwteW91ci1zaGFyZXMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"In a demonstration of the fact that the family behind Paris-based design house, Hermès, are tightening the reigns, Axel Dumas, a sixth generation member of the Hermès family, officially stepped in as CEO last month, succeeding Patrick Thomas, the first and only outsider to ever run the company. According to a recent piece by the Wall Street Journal, “Mr. Dumas and his cousins have stepped into the breach in response to LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton building up a 23% stake. The family pooled 50% of the company’s capital in a trust to keep it out of the hands of the luxury juggernaut. But LVMH hasn’t signaled any intention of backing down.” And Hermès certainly is not pleased.

You may recall that in July 2012, the house filed a criminal complaint against LVMH in a Paris court, accusing the luxury conglomerate of insider trading, collusion and manipulating stock prices; to this, LVMH filed a complaint against Hermès for “blackmail, slander and unfair competition.” Add to the mix an investigation by the French financial services watchdog Autorité des marches financiers’s Sanctions Committee, which resulted in LVMH being slapped with a $10.4 million fine, and yet another increase in LVMH’s stake in Hermès, and you have an idea of the state of the relationship between the luxury rivals.

In the wake of ongoing drama between the luxury rivals, the Wall Street Journal’s Christina Passariello sat down with Dumas, who spoke about family unity and why price isn’t an indicator of exclusivity, but maybe most interestingly, how he plans to deal with the company’s unwanted shareholder. He initially told Passariello: “We are fighting to keep Hermès independent. It will be the fight of our generation”, certainly a nod to what has been largely characterized by as a takeover plan by LVMH. Although, LVMH Chairman Bernard Arnault has held that LVMH is a legitimate shareholder in Hermès and not planning a takeover.

Here is an excerpt from the interview …

WSJ: Was LVMH’s entry into your capital due to the family being complacent?

Mr. Dumas: It surprised everyone. We are fighting to keep Hermès independent. It will be the fight of our generation. We are a company with 177 years of history. So we’ve seen struggle from time to time. We invested all our money in 1928 to open a store in New York, just before the Great Depression. It was 10 years of trauma for the family thanks to that.

WSJ: Now that you are the public face of the family, what kind of relationship will you have with LVMH?

Mr. Dumas: As a CEO, my role is to grow the company as much as possible, taking into account the global interest of all the shareholders.

WSJ: Including LVMH.

Mr. Dumas: The best benefit they can have is by realizing the capital gain on their shares.

WSJ: So you are encouraging them to sell?

Mr. Dumas: It would create great results that will increase their profit.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9985989928245544}",neutral,0.9985989928245544,0

LVMH has announced the finalists for its 2014 Prize for Young Designers — a new award for big-time designers to shower money on an up-and-comer — and they are the following: Atto, CG, Gabriele Colangelo, Hood by Air, Jacquemus, Miuniku, Simone Rocha, Suno, Thomas Tait, Tillmann Lauterbach, Tim Coppens, and Vika Gazinskaya.

The judges include Karl Lagerfeld, Phoebe Philo, Marc Jacobs, Riccardo Tisci, and Nicolas Ghesquière, among others. They were apparently asked to vote for their ten favorite candidates, but because there were so many good options and it was so hard to choose, they bumped the number of finalists up to 12. Though the prize is the brainchild of Delphine Arnault, Bernard Arnault was, according to WWD, “so impressed with the field of designers that he joined the expert panel and cast his vote for his top 10” as well.

The winner, which will be announced May 28, gets a grant of 300,000 euro plus a “year of coaching,” so it really is like Project Runway and Hunger Games wrapped into one — with Arnault as President Coriolanus Snow and Jacobs, of course, as Cinna.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9998620748519897}",neutral,0.9998620748519897,0
LVMH shakes up watches and jewellery product-mix and strategy - Financial Times,"Wed, 26 Mar 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZ0LmNvbS9jb250ZW50LzJjNjVkNTVhLThlODktMTFlMy05OGM2LTAwMTQ0ZmVhYjdkZdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Print this page

When it comes to managing its brands, France’s LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton likes to take a laisser-faire approach. Autonomy and independence rank highly on its list of priorities. So when in January the group, controlled by Bernard Arnault, the French billionaire, announced a reshuffle of top management overseeing its watches and jewellery division, the luxury industry took note.

Starting this month, Antonio Belloni, the group’s managing director, took on responsibility for the division with an eye to bolstering the jewellery business centred on Bulgari , Chaumet , Fred and De Beers .

As part of the change, Jean-Claude Biver, current chief executive at Hublot , has taken charge of watches, dominated by TAG Heuer but also including Zenith and Hublot.

The changes have taken place at a critical moment. LVMH’s acquisition of Bulgari in 2011 for €3.7bn significantly boosted the luxury group’s watches and jewellery division and accounted for more than a quarter of its roughly €2.8bn annual revenue last year.

But some analysts say the Paris-based group has yet to make the most of the purchase, arguing that the product mix is too thin – and too expensive – while the retail strategy needs a serious overhaul.

Luca Solca, a luxury analyst at Exane BNP Paribas, says, “The Bulgari stores are too big and the sales per square foot are disappointing.”

As for brand positioning, John Guy, an analyst at Berenberg Bank, says that Bulgari was missing its target. “For a long time, there was a sense that the advertising strategy was not aligned with the brand’s heritage,” he says.

LVMH’s watch brands also face challenging times. With about 10 per cent of the Swiss watch market in value terms, the group’s main brands have the scale necessary to compete effectively.

But competitors such as Swatch Group , the market leader with brands including Longines , Breguet and Omega, have more muscle and influence over independent retailers in Asia because they can offer a wider choice of brands, making LVMH’s expansion in Asia more difficult. Meanwhile, manufacturers are investing heavily in their own abilities to produce watch movements following changes in Switzerland’s competition laws, under which the Swatch Group is phasing out supplying rivals.

That poses obvious challenges, says Jon Cox, head of Swiss equities at Kepler Cheuvreux.

“If you want to set up a factory that builds movements, it is very expensive and it puts your margins under pressure,” he says. It is, he adds, also complicated.

“There are 150 or 200 different components, all small and difficult to put together. It is not like Meccano.”

Overall, LVMH’s watches and jewellery division accounts for almost 10 per cent of group revenue but only 6 per cent of operating profit. Most analysts agree that the division has the potential to account for closer to 15 per cent of operating profit.

So what do Mr Belloni and Mr Biver have in mind? Mr Solca says that the plan is to bring Mr Belloni’s organisational skills to bear on Bulgari’s retail operations. Operating profit margins have already improved at the Italian jewellery maker from about 7 per cent of sales in 2007 to about 12 per cent today.

Much of that has come from the obvious synergies of centralising advertising and promotion, as well as LVMH’s muscle when it comes to securing prime retail real estate. But the group has said that it wants to take margins at Bulgari to 20 per cent.

Its revamped store on New York’s Fifth Avenue could be the way forward. Unlike the past when there was a confusing mix of products there is now a clear delineation between watches and jewellery.

Moreover, people with knowledge of the store’s performance say that it had already achieved its full-year 2013 target by mid-November – before the traditionally higher sales during the Christmas period. In an interview with the Financial Times, Mr Biver says that his goal at LVMH’s watches is to outperform the market: “If the industry does three, then I want us to do four or more. If we beat the market, we are successful.”

To achieve that, divisions must develop their presence with single-brand stores using LVMH’s experience in getting real estate. “In multi-brand stores, you can only show the product,” he says. “In our stores, we can show the history, the emotion and the dreams of the brand.”

He insists that investing in watch-movement facilities is critical given the changing industry – to acquire independence from suppliers and rivals and to “give a deeper industrial substance to our brands . . . I believe in the DNA of every brand”. Hublot, for example, is now only 35 per cent dependent on movement suppliers compared with almost 100 per cent a few years ago. “That trend is not going to stop,” he says.

He adds that having your own manufacturing facility is an essential part of the creative process. “How can you create a new alloy if you don’t have a metallurgy department?” he asks. “How can you develop a new screw if you don’t have a screw department?”

Put all of the changes together, and Thomas Chauvet, an analyst at Citigroup, is optimistic about the coming years. “The performance of LVMH’s watch and jewellery brands has not been as consistent as some of its peers, but things are starting to go in the right direction,” he says.

Turnround specialists: Jean-Claude Biver and Antonio Belloni

When the proliferation of cheap quartz movements in the 1970s and 1980s began to threaten the Swiss watch industry, Jean-Claude Biver took a stand.

“Since 1735 there has never been a quartz Blancpain watch,” read the advertising campaign he launched, while head of the Swiss company that he revived. “And there never will be,” it concluded.

The slogan caught on, not only reviving Blancpain’s fortunes – he bought the name in 1981 for SFr22,000 after the manufacturer had gone out of business and sold it 10 years later for SFr60m – but also marking a turning point for the entire industry.

Special agent: product placements in James Bond films boosted Omega

Little wonder that LVMH, the French luxury goods group, this month appointed him head of its watches division where he will be responsible for developing the group’s Hublot , Zenith and Tag Heuer brands.

Mr Biver, who was born in Luxembourg but moved to Switzerland with his family when he was 10, fell in love with Swiss watches in 1975. That was the year he caught sight of a skeleton watch belonging to Jacques Piguet of the Frederic Piguet movement factory.

“It looked like a steam engine to me. I was totally amazed,” he says. “Then I said to myself, ‘if you loved steam engines as a boy, why wouldn’t you love watches as an adult?’.”

Within a few days, he had found a job at Audemars Piguet where he learnt all aspects of the business – from how to design and make watches to how to distribute and sell them.

The 64-year-old Mr Biver, who has his own cheese label that only supplies friends and restaurants he likes, has spent most of his career as a turnround specialist. His successful revival of the Blancpain brand opened doors at the Swatch Group, which offered him a seat on the board and the mission to rescue the group’s Omega brand.

Thanks to uncanny marketing skills, including celebrity sponsorship and product placement in the James Bond films, profits at the division grew almost 300 per cent.

At Hublot, his next project, profits grew so fast after he joined in 2004 that LVMH bought it in 2008.

His latest role is, therefore, something of a departure. As he says, “I have been used to turning brands into a success. Now for the first time in my life I have to manage three successful brands.”

There are few people as central to LVMH as Antonio Belloni, the group’s managing director. Known to many just as Toni, he has acquired a reputation over his career as a supreme organiser.

But that is hardly surprising – Mr Belloni cut his teeth at Procter & Gamble , joining the US consumer products company when he was just 24. During the following 22 years, he occupied a range of positions in Europe and the US and finally became chairman of P&G Europe in 1999.

At LVMH, which he joined in 2001, he has become the right-hand man of Bernard Arnault, the group’s founder and largest shareholder. Analysts say that his greatest contribution has been in perfumes, cosmetics and selective retailing. Return on net assets – which is used to measure a company’s financial performance – in selective retailing has risen from less than 4 per cent in 2004 to 14 per cent last year, for example.

“Procter & Gamble is a marketing school that teaches you how to relentlessly win market share from competitors,” says Luca Solca of Exane BNP Paribas. “Belloni learned the lesson very well.”

Analysts say that Mr Belloni’s role at the watches and jewellery division is likely to be one of the overarching strategist rather than as a day-to-day manager. LVMH has a reputation for allowing the heads of each of its 60-odd luxury brands to operate fairly independently.

Mr Belloni, who is Italian and studied economics at Pavia University, has a reputation for “ruthlessness in ensuring that the section he oversees runs well”, as one analyst put it.

Perhaps that skill helps explain why he was France’s highest-paid executive in 2009 with a salary of €5.4m, according to local media.

In spite of that, the 59 year old remains intensely private. He is married with four children, played competitive basketball in his younger days and enjoys skiing, golf and scuba diving in his spare time.

One person who knows him describes him as highly personable and always making jokes. He is also refreshingly independent: he sometimes wears suits made by Brioni, which is owned by Paris rival luxury group Kering. He is also said to wear a Rolex.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9988089799880981}",neutral,0.9988089799880981,0

Château d’Yquem Profile:

As wine-related soap operas go, there are few to beat the battle between the Lur-Saluces family of Yquem and the LVMH luxury goods group. In 1996, Bernard Arnault’s company first made its move, exploiting the knowledge that among the 50 or so shareholders of the great first growth, many were ready to cash in their shares. Moreover, some accused Comte Alexandre de Lur-Saluces, the director of Yquem, of high-handedness. Without a united resistance to the takeover, defeat seemed inevitable, and in 1999 LVMH (Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton) became the majority shareholder. Assurances were sought, and given, that Yquem’s impeccably high standards would be maintained.

Pierre Lurton, already at the helm of Arnault’s other first growth, Cheval Blanc, now found himself running a second one. Immediately, changes were made. Under Lur-Saluces, Yquem had never been offered en primeur. Lurton offered the 1999 vintage at a relatively modest price to kick-start interest in Yquem as a whole, as it was said that there were considerable stocks of unsold bottles in the cellars. When the superb 2001 vintage came along, the opening price more than doubled.

But Lurton wisely made no changes to the Yquem team. Francis Mayeur, technical director since 1983, remained in place, as did Dr Sandrine Garbay, cellarmaster since 1998. However, he did appoint Denis Dubourdieu, professor of oenology at the University of Bordeaux and the owner of secondgrowth Sauternes estate Doisy-Daëne, as consultant.

With the team unaltered, there were to be no dramatic changes in farming or winemaking, although there was inevitably some fine-tuning. Under Lur-Saluces the aim at harvest had been to pick bunches or grapes with a potential alcohol of 21%, so as to deliver the balance of alcohol and residual sugar typical of Yquem. ‘Today,’ says Mayeur, ‘we have a range of must weights from 18% to 24%, as we find having a wider range gives us different aromas and levels of concentration, and thus more complexity. We also end up with more parcel selections for blending; in some years there can be as many as 40.’

The balance of the blend will determine the final residual sugar in each vintage. Mayeur aims for between 120 and 140 grams per litre, rather higher than 20 years ago when 80 to 120g/l was the norm, but that reflects the richness and ripeness of most recent vintages. But even so, Yquem is not the richest and weightiest Sauternes – many others have higher residual sugar.

There have been changes to the pressing regime too, with pneumatic presses used for the first two pressings, and the third done in a modern vertical press and kept aside. It is then assessed to decide whether to incorporate it into the final blend.

Lur-Saluces had always aged Yquem for at least 36 months in new oak, but Lurton feared oxidation could affect certain lots, so the time was reduced to no more than 30 months. ‘The other advantage of this,’ explains Garbay, ‘is we need fewer rackings and thus less sulphur dioxide. All this helps retain more fruit in the wine.’ About 10 months after the harvest a preliminary blend is assembled, leaving 10% to 20% of the lots to be assessed later. The final blend is made soon before bottling.

Changing styles

Like any botrytised wine, Sauternes is dependent on vintage conditions. So it should have come as no surprise when Yquem decided not to release any wine from the poor 2012 vintage. There was some indignation when this was announced, but this has long been the policy. There is no Yquem from 1964 or 1972 and from many earlier vintages. Lurton observed: ‘High sugars aren’t enough. You need aroma and texture too.’ Garbay agreed: ‘Yquem has to be intense, complex. But 2012 was just too light. It’s not what our customers expect from an Yquem. There’s no interest in our releasing a Petit Yquem.’

Although Lurton downplays the importance of Dubourdieu’s appointment (‘He keeps us on our toes, but it was never our intention for Denis to put his own stamp on the wines’) he concedes that Dubourdieu did a play a role in altering the style of Ygrec, the estate’s dry wine. Under Lur-Saluces, it was produced from very ripe but insufficiently botrytised grapes and vinified to near dryness. On the nose, it was easily taken for a Sauternes, but one sip made the taster realise it was nothing of the sort.

Lurton never liked Ygrec: ‘In the past it showed a lot of botrytis, and was made in an oxidative style and could be petrolly. It wasn’t modern. This is where Denis was helpful, advising us to pick specific parcels and to pick earlier.’ Since 2005 the style has changed – it’s essentially dry, with 7g/l or 8g/l residual sugar balanced by the acidity, and enough fruit richness to deliver 15% alcohol. It’s like a super-charged white Graves, but I can imagine there are some who regret the passing of the occasionally clumsy but distinctive old-style Ygrec.

Alexandre de Lur-Saluces used to say that Yquem was like a protected monument – everyone admired it but nobody drank it. Lurton would never say it in public, but I suspect the LVMH team is encountering the same problem. Average production is some 100,000 bottles, but the market for great Sauternes is not exactly buoyant, so Lurton hopes by changing the patterns of consumption, sales may increase.

‘We need to alter the perception that Yquem has to be aged 50 years before it can be drunk. I know Brits love really old Sauternes, but there’s a lot of pleasure to be had from consuming it young. The 2007 and 2008 are drinking well now. You have to chill it more than an old wine and you may lose a bit of the aroma, but it has a freshness and accessibility that are marvellous. This move towards freshness and finesse has earned us some criticism, from writers who find our wines less rich than some other Sauternes. But our aim has never been to produce monstrous wines with huge sugar levels. That’s not what Yquem is about.

Attracting the drinkers

‘A more subtle task is to demystify what has become a mythic wine,’ continues Lurton. ‘We must stop being timid about communicating its exceptional character. We’ve taken on a young man who was at Cheval Blanc to assist precisely in this work. Of course I do a lot of the ambassadorial work myself, but we need someone to work on packaging, events, and other matters. It’s his job to get closer to the consumers and to unite Yquem lovers.

‘We also need to ensure that people drink the wine, not just collect it. Yquem may seem very expensive, but when you consider the costs and risks of production and the tiny volumes, it really isn’t. We just need to work harder promoting Yquem. It’s not hard – we just need to get wine lovers to put their nose in the glass! Fortunately, there’s lots of interest and curiosity in Asia, especially matching Yquem with their cuisines. But I admit it’s not easy.’

Nothing in recent vintages suggests there have been any compromises in the production of Yquem. In the vineyard and the winery, the old team is as committed as ever to maintaining standards, and changes introduced since the LVMH takeover seem sensible and justifiable. The Lur-Saluces family, with its centuries of custodianship, may have taken a relaxed view of the bottom line – until some shareholders decided otherwise.

LVMH is unlikely to be sentimental about this feather in its Bordeaux cap. A great Sauternes property soaks up money – the low yields (perhaps a quarter of those from a top Médoc property), the immense costs of harvesting, the cost of new oak, the campaign to build the profile of the property in new Asian markets, and so on. Arnault can’t have been unaware of this. Let’s hope this historic monument of the wine world will attract drinkers as well as admirers, and continue to thrive for centuries to come.

Why are Prada and LVMH so interested in patronising Milanese patisseries?

BY Ellie Pithers | 19 March 2014

Fashion is often criticised for its 'Let them eat cake' attitude. Now, not even its staunchest defenders can quibble with that reductive view of the industry: Prada has bought the historic Milanese pastry shop Pasticceria Marchesi.

This wasn't a spur-of-the-moment purchase. Nor was it a cakewalk. Prada was engaged in a battle with the French luxury conglomerate LVMH over the acquisition of a controlling stake in another historic Milanese pastry shop, Cova, in June last year. LVMH won out, despite Prada contending it was engaged in talks with Cova's former owners, the Faccioli family, over rights to the brand. The Italians were riled. They're inured to the French luxury behemoths - LVMH and Kering - buying up Italian brands including Bulgari and Gucci, but filching a pastry institution from under their noses? That really took the biscotti.

Panettone has happily been returned to Italian hands with Prada's purchase of 80 per cent of Marchesi. But the acquisition shouldn't be reduced to a mere case of 'keep off our patch' one-upmanship. For while it would seem a non sequitur for fashion - purveyor of clothes for the pastry-shunning elite - to acquire a sweet tooth, buying up cake shops is just another example of luxury's love of (branded) philanthropy.

Rising rents mean that a number of independent shops and coffee houses in Milan are being pushed off their prime spots on high-end shopping thoroughfares. In buying authentic Milanese institutions - fashion to the rescue! - brands appear patriotic. This explains why, elsewhere in Italy, Fendi is funding the restoration of the Trevi Fountain - snappily named Fendi For Fountain - and Diego Della Valle, the CEO of Tod's, is contributing £21 million to a major clean-up of the Colosseum. Next up for a revamp: Pompeii, where several walls collapsed last week prompting Italy's new prime minister, Matteo Renzi, to appeal to the private sector for help. ""Italy is the land of culture, and so I challenge entrepreneurs: What are you waiting for?"" he said. Pucci would be a good alliterative fit, if it can stump up the cash.

But back to the cake: Why are Prada and LVMH so interested in patronising patisseries, specifically? For LVMH it could be nothing simpler than good business. Their food and drink brands, which include Moët & Chandon and Veuve Cliquot, contributed to a growth of 1 per cent last year, while revenue from fashion and leather goods decreased 0.4 per cent. Prada's managing director Patrizio Bertelli clearly has his eyes on those figures. He said of the Marchesi acquisition: ""Our goal is to collaborate in an effective manner in its development and in full respect of its tradition."" Profit is part of that development.



The Pasticceria Marchesi in Milan

A more flippant interpretation is that Miuccia Prada, Bertelli's wife and the creative director, is about to colonise the kitchen. After all, she revealed in the Schiaparelli and Prada: Impossible Conversations exhibition at the Met in 2012 that she loves aprons. ""The apron is a recurring theme in my work because it is symbolic of women's sufferance... It's an emblem of women's despair, their poverty, their passions,"" she said.

So, a line of aprons in the works, or a weakness for cannoli? You decide.

Jointly led by LVMH and SMU, and operated through SMU’s Centre for Marketing Excellence, the LVMH-SMU Asia Luxury Brand Research Initiative is expected to benefit SMU, LVMH and Singapore.



In particular, the Initiative aims to produce independent and high quality academic research through the involvement of a panel of faculty experts and students in a range of activities including case studies, research projects, publications and executive education. It will promote collaborative research interactions by bringing together researchers, practitioners and students through academic and practitioner seminars, conferences and visiting professorship. The joint research initiative will also develop a pool of talents by giving students the opportunity to develop strong working knowledge of the luxury industry and to engage in authentic research experiences, as well as by providing internships and career opportunities within the luxury sector.

We are proud to partner with LVMH through the LVMH-SMU Asia Luxury Brand Research Initiative. The partnership is important for both SMU and Singapore. I’m deeply convinced that we can learn much from the joint research – not only will the first-hand research data help us better understand the strategic aspects of luxury markets and consumers in Asia, the knowledge gained from this research can also benefit Singapore’s retail sector.”



The research collaboration with SMU is LVMH Group’s first such partnership with a local university in Asia. It illustrates the Group’s long term commitment to Singapore and exemplifies the growing importance of the Asia-Pacific region as a region of quality and great potential.



Mrs Chantal Gaemperle, Group Executive Vice President of Human Resources and Synergies, LVMH said: “As a Group, we are constantly striving for collaborations and on the lookout for great talent. With SMU’s international reach, recognition for its world-class research and distinguished teaching, we believe that SMU is the perfect partner to produce and deliver high quality academic research dedicated to the luxury sector and the Asian market. This Agreement also exemplifies the growing importance of Singapore and our strong commitment in developing a pool of talent in this region.”

Perfume manufacturers must cope with the scarcity of precious supplies - The Guardian,"Tue, 04 Mar 2014 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy8yMDE0L21hci8wNC9jaGFuZWwtcGVyZnVtZS1sZWdpc2xhdGlvbi1ndWVybGFpbi1sb3JlYWzSAVtodHRwczovL2FtcC50aGVndWFyZGlhbi5jb20vYnVzaW5lc3MvMjAxNC9tYXIvMDQvY2hhbmVsLXBlcmZ1bWUtbGVnaXNsYXRpb24tZ3VlcmxhaW4tbG9yZWFs?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The perfume industry is facing a major problem: maintaining constant levels of quality is crucial, but it is increasingly difficult to obtain a regular supply of all the necessary natural ingredients. Essential oils such as jasmine, rose, vetiver, ilang-ilang, iris, vanilla, sandalwood or lavender cannot be synthesised in the laboratory. But supplies are dwindling and need to be protected, in some cases by the perfume industry itself.

In 1987, for example, Chanel made an agreement to buy all the jasmine flowers produced by the Mul family, which has been the main source of the flowers in France for five generations. Jacques Polge, Chanel's top ""nose"" since 1978, made the decision when developers started trying to buy up land around Grasse, where the Muls cultivate three hectares of the precious plant.

The crop of fragrant white flowers – between 10 and 15 tonnes a year – is almost entirely used in Chanel No 5, the perfume created by Ernest Beaux in 1921 and now the world's biggest-selling fragrance. The smallest bottle (30ml) contains the equivalent of 1,000 buds. They are hand-picked in the morning to retain as much fragrance as possible, from August to October – and processed the same day.

The partnership between Chanel and the Mul family has since been extended to include Provence rose, iris, tuberose and an old variety of geranium. The factory located nearby is both a laboratory and a processing plant.

At Guerlain, a subsidiary of LVMH, the head perfumier Thierry Wasser was also responsible for starting jasmine production again in Calabria, Italy. ""I spend about a quarter of my time in the fields, talking to growers,"" he says. His quest for new fragrances has taken him as far as the mountains near Kashan, Iran, in search of the Damascus rose, still grown there using traditional methods. It features in a new eau de parfum.

His work takes him to Tunisia too, to supervise the harvest of orange blossom, of which Guerlain distils 100 tonnes a year for its own use. Here too he sources bergamot, a favourite ingredient in his preparations.

Wasser has set aside a bottle of rose oil, which he considers the most remarkable of last year's harvest. It is the result of a perfect balance between dew and sunlight. Much as with the best wines, the raw materials of perfume are always changing, affected by the soil, sunlight, rainfall and temperature. Their price varies too, depending on crop yields.

None of the big three – Chanel, Guerlain and L'Oréal – have any immediate plans to invest more extensively in growing. They see raising the trees and flowers on which they depend for essential oils as a separate business.

But François Demachy, the nose at Christian Dior Parfums and head of the perfumes division at LVMH, reckons diversification into primary production as a likely move for the industry to make. He says he is ""considering [investing] further upstream"" in the long term. He is certainly concerned about ""availability problems"" for certain ingredients, which has prompted him to increase the range of sources for some flowers and even to seal an agreement with a Sri Lankan producer of sandalwood – a rare species protected by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (Cites).

""What was Jean-Paul [Guerlain] thinking of when he put so much sandalwood in Samsara?"" his successor Wasser jokes. The price of the essential oil has rocketed since 1989 when the perfume was launched.

Each bottle of perfume is made from raw materials whose quality and cost are sensitive to changes in agriculture, politics, natural disasters, climate and disease. All of which can be a major headache for perfumers.

""Rural flight has substantially reduced these micromarkets all over the world. Farmers are tempted to switch to cereals or oil-producing plants, which often pay much better than flowers. The growers who work for the perfume industry and their pickers do not earn a great deal,"" says Jean-Pierre Coutauchaud, head of speciality raw materials purchasing at L'Oréal. In the perfumes produced by L'Oréal (Trésor, Lancôme, Armani), natural materials only account for 20% of ingredients, the rest being artificial.

""In Indonesia, the Chinese who used to farm the patchouli fields have been persecuted, forcing them to give up their crops, which in turn led to an incredible price rise,"" Wasser explains. For several months after the earthquake that devastated Haiti in January 2010 vetiver exports stopped, he adds. On the other hand, the Arab spring in 2011 did not affect the supply of jasmine, despite it being mainly sourced from Tunisia and Egypt.

Nearer to home, the lavender fields of Provence have been severely damaged in recent years by insect-borne bacteria.

""We now keep reserves of strategic raw materials – such as vetiver, vanilla and lavender – selected on the basis of three criteria: they can't be synthesised, only come from a single geographical source and are needed in large quantities,"" says a spokesperson at Givaudan, which manufactures perfume for several brands.

Givaudan, based in Vernier, Switzerland, is taking steps to mitigate shortages. It has launched schemes to protect and sustain sources of endangered raw materials. It has helped tonka bean growers in Venezuela, restarted sandalwood production in Australia, and helped to improve the quality of benzoin resin in Laos and ilang-ilang in the Comoros islands.

Haiti produces half the world's supply of vetiver. Its roots yield an essential oil with a mysterious dry fragrance akin to smoked wood, which Haitians call the ""essence of tranquillity"". In 2012 Givaudan started working with Agri Supply, the main producer of the oil. Its refurbished vetiver distillery is now the largest in the world. Some 160 farmers in three villages in the Cayes district have formed a co-operative and negotiated a guaranteed minimum price. They also receive technical support from the Swiss firm.

Hermes shrugs off China worries as profits rise - Yahoo Finance,"Thu, 20 Mar 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTGh0dHA6Ly9maW5hbmNlLnlhaG9vLmNvbS9uZXdzL2hlcm1lcy1zaHJ1Z3Mtb2ZmLWNoaW5hLXdvcnJpZXMtMTcyMTQzMTU4Lmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"By Pascale Denis

PARIS (Reuters) - French luxury goods maker Hermes (PAR:RMS) saw good demand over the Chinese New Year, it said on Thursday, underscoring its resilience to a crackdown on illicit gift-giving in the industry's biggest market that has hit some rivals hard.

Posting a 9 percent rise in 2013 operating profit, the maker of Birkin handbags and printed silk scarves also shrugged off the impact of the crisis in Ukraine on Russian shoppers.

""If they don't travel anymore, they'll still shop in Moscow,"" Chief Executive Axel Dumas told reporters on Thursday.

An anti-corruption drive in China has dented sales of luxury goods from high-end watches to the logo-printed products sold by the likes of LVMH's (PAR:MC) Louis Vuitton and Kering's (PAR:PP) Gucci.

However, Hermes has proved resilient, reporting last month that its 2013 sales rose 13 percent at constant exchange rates, including a 16 percent increase in Asia.

The family-controlled group believes it is helped by an understated style.

Its iconic Kelly and Birkin leather handbags, which cost between 7,000 and 30,000 euros, can take months to obtain in certain colours or types of leather, creating scarcity and a reputation for exclusivity.

Dumas said sales over the Chinese New Year - an important trading period for luxury firms - had gone ""rather well"" and that Hermes was pressing ahead with expansion in Asia.

The group, which has 315 stores worldwide, plans to open three more stores in China this year, including a flagship one in Shanghai. Three other stores are due to open in Asia - in Thailand, Malaysia and South Korea.

Hermes' operating profit rose 8.9 percent to 1.22 billion euros $1.7 billion (1 billion pounds) last year and its operating margin hit a new high of 32.4 percent, from 32.1 percent in 2012.

The group said this was partly due to currency hedging gains against the yen, which lost over 20 percent in 2013, and analysts said the hedging gain was likely to be lower this year. The yen has sharply weakened over the past year and a half, on the back of Japan's economic stimulus measures.

Story continues

Dumas told Reuters in February that Hermes had hiked the price of its luxury goods in Japan by 10 percent over the month to counter the currency's weakness.

UBS analysts forecast like-for-like sales growth of 11 percent this year for Hermes and a small decline in its operating margin to 32.2 percent.

Net profit rose 6.8 percent to 790 million euros last year and the company said it planned to pay a dividend of 2.70 euros a share for 2013, from 2.50 euros for 2012.

""We're hoping for good results in 2014. We're very confident but one should always be cautious,"" Dumas said.

Shares in Hermes were down 0.4 percent to 236.55 euros at 1605 GMT, and are down around 10 percent so far this year.

With a market capitalisation of nearly 25 billion euros, or 27 times forecast 2014 earnings, Hermes commands one of the highest ratings among European luxury stocks, in part due to past speculation that LVMH, its largest external shareholder with a 23.1 percent stake, could make a takeover bid.

POSCO said Tuesday it has named the new CEOs for five of its affiliates.

The steelmaker's Vice President Hwang Eun-yeon was promoted to lead POSCO Energy.

Hwang Tae-hyun was named as CEO of POSCO Engineering & Construction (E&C); Shin Young-kwan for POSCO Processing & Service (P&S); Suh Young-sea for POSCO Specialty Steel; and Cho Noi-ha for POSCO Engineering.

""The reshuffle is based on the evaluation of the candidates' work performance and expertise,"" the firm said in a press release.

Hwang Tae-hyun served as the chief finance executive at POSCO E&C.

Shin worked as a sales executive at POSCO and its trading arm, Daewoo International.

Luxury leather goods store Louis Vuitton is to close, the company said yesterday.

The iconic fashion store will shut its doors for the last time at the end of next month, with the loss of up to four jobs.

Greg Tolaram, director of owners Atlantic Luggage Co Ltd, which owns the store in partnership with Louis Vuitton, said his firm had pledged to help staff find jobs elsewhere.

He added: “We are looking to reposition people in terms of jobs — there will be a few jobs lost, but we’re doing our best to reposition them as soon as possible and assist them in that regard.”

A spokeswoman for Louis Vuitton’s New York HQ confirmed: “It has been a pleasure for Louis Vuitton to serve the Bermuda community.

“Unfortunately, the market opportunity in Bermuda does not support maintaining our store presence once our lease expires at the end of April.”

Mr Tolaram declined to say whether falling sales had contributed to the decision by Louis Vuitton, part of the giant luxury goods company LVMH, to pull out of Bermuda.

But he said: “We have had a wonderful experience — you can’t run a business of this calibre without having good partners. We have had wonderful partners in Louis Vuitton.”

The store opened 16 years ago and underwent a total refit less than three years ago.

The revamp meant the shop could display a larger range of Louis Vuitton goods, which includes handbags, luggage and accessories, including ties, jewellery and sunglasses.

Louis Vuitton vice-president for Canada and Bermuda Jean-Philippe Hecquet said then that the company had invested in the store because it was “doing extremely well”.

He added that the store sold mostly to an Island-based clientele, rather than tourists.

The decision by the global luxury brand — famed for its monogrammed handbags and one of the few global names to have a presence on the Island — is a fresh blow to a retail sector already reeling from recession and will leave another gap on once-thriving Front Street.

Bermuda Chamber of Commerce president Ronnie Viera said: “It is very disappointing to hear of the closure of Louis Vuitton and the associated job losses.

“While the restaurant and the real estate industries may have seen an improvement in 2013 over 2012, the retail market in Bermuda has yet to show any meaningful signs of recovery.”

He added: “In general, luxury brands do well, even in a recessionary market.

“The Hamilton and St George’s retailers are both feeling the effects of not having a regular cruise ship in port, the result being fewer visitors and a corresponding drop in sales.

But Mr Viera said: “Nevertheless, we remain hopeful that the measures taken by Government in the form of extending the payroll tax concessions will lessen the burden on the retailers until the industry improves. “

Education and Economic Development Minister Grant Gibbons was yesterday off the Island and unavailable for comment.

LVMH also owns upmarket brands like champagne houses Dom Perignon and Moet & Chandon, as well as cognac firm Hennessy and a list of other luxury jewellery, watch and clothing firms.

Louis Vuitton, which has hundreds of stores around the globe, is the world’s most valuable luxury brand, worth more than $26 billion.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9991427659988403}",neutral,0.9991427659988403,0
