Tapestry wants to build a luxury powerhouse to rival Europe’s LVMH - Digital Commerce 360,"Thu, 23 Aug 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRpZ2l0YWxjb21tZXJjZTM2MC5jb20vMjAxOC8wOC8yMy90YXBlc3RyeS13YW50cy10by1idWlsZC1hLWx1eHVyeS1wb3dlcmhvdXNlLXRvLXJpdmFsLWV1cm9wZXMtbHZtaC_SAXRodHRwczovL3d3dy5kaWdpdGFsY29tbWVyY2UzNjAuY29tLzIwMTgvMDgvMjMvdGFwZXN0cnktd2FudHMtdG8tYnVpbGQtYS1sdXh1cnktcG93ZXJob3VzZS10by1yaXZhbC1ldXJvcGVzLWx2bWgvYW1wLw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"(Bloomberg)—The new 700,000-square-foot headquarters of Coach is a state-of-the-art campus in one of New York’s newest skyscrapers. Showrooms along a 15-story atrium look out over tourists walking the High Line, the elevated railroad track-turned-park, and terraces on the 23rd floor poke out from a dine-in cafe that offers sushi and sandwiches. There’s even a special chicken wing bar for staffers who don’t want the usual lunch fare.

A lot of work remains to be done, though. The building occupies the southeast corner of the city’s new $20 billion Hudson Yards complex, and cranes have loomed around the 52-story glass tower since the brand moved in two years ago. Even now, the buzz of jackhammers and welding machines greet Coach’s 1,200 or so employees each morning as they enter their pristine new office.

Inside, a similarly radical restructuring is underway. Sales at Coach are just starting to recover after a disastrous three-year stretch from 2012 to 2015, when the label shed $928 million, or more than 18%, of its annual revenue.

To restore the fading fashion house, the plan is to turn it into America’s answer to European luxury conglomerates such as Kering and LVMH, which run wide-ranging portfolios of brands. LVMH, No. 131 in the Internet Retailer 2018 Top 1000 and the world’s largest luxury company at nearly $50 billion in annual revenue, owns everything from Louis Vuitton clothing and Veuve Cliquot Champagne to Guerlain perfumes, TAG Heuer watches, and Sephora cosmetics.

The man steering this strategy, perched in a corner office high above the Hudson River, is taking a page out of his former boss’s playbook. Victor Luis, a 52-year-old executive, ran two divisions at LVMH before joining Coach: fashion label Givenchy in Japan and Baccarat crystal glassware in the U.S. An immigrant from São Miguel, a little Portuguese island in the Atlantic, he has a master’s degree in international economics and, from the looks of it, a Ph.D. in swagger.

Since his promotion to the top job in January 2014, Luis has announced two acquisitions: a $574 million deal for women’s shoemaker Stuart Weitzman and, last July, $2.4 billion for Kate Spade, one of the brand’s nemeses. He announced layoffs, culled about a third of his domestic store fleet, and hired replacements for several high-level executives, including former brand chiefs Craig Leavitt and Wendy Kahn. He eliminated the Jack Spade menswear business. He has also severely cut down on promotional activity, such as flash sales and discounted merchandise, purposely hurting sales in the hope that it would wean customers off lower-priced fare.

Perhaps the most controversial announcement, at least for the millions of shoppers who buy Coach’s bags and wallets, occurred last fall, when Luis gave the 77-year-old fashion house a new corporate name: Tapestry Inc., No. 179 in the Top 1000. The move signals that Luis is looking to reposition the company as an American LVMH, one that has evolved beyond “core fashion.”

Coach, Tapestry’s biggest business at more than $4 billion, is coming off a strong 12-month run, with same-store sales, a key metric for the retail industry, turning positive over the holiday season last year. “The biggest question mark for us—and for me—was how much time do these things take?” Luis says. “Anxiousness? Short-term concern? Absolutely.”

A brief history of American luxury

It wasn’t always like this. Coach was known as an originator of what’s called “affordable luxury.” The company began in 1941 as a leather goods workshop in New York that sold only men’s goods: bags, wallets, flask-holders. It didn’t sell women’s handbags until Lillian and Miles Cahn bought the factory 20 years later. Some of the label’s oldest pieces are still stored in its archive, deep in the labyrinth of its headquarters. They’re relics that designers now use to jog their creativity.

Many of those bags were designed by Bonnie Cashin, who was hired in 1962 and is considered a pioneer of women’s sportswear. In her 12 years there, she transformed Coach from leather shop to fashion house. Her shoulder bags with interchangeable straps, bucket bags and clutches became mainstays, and her signature brass turn lock, which was inspired by the toggles on the roof of her convertible, is still used on many of the brand’s styles today.

In 1985, the Cahns sold the company to the Sara Lee Corp., a now-defunct consumer goods conglomerate, and Coach expanded quickly. It hit $100 million in sales by 1989 and made longtime executive Lew Frankfort its president. Appointed CEO in 1995, he spent the next 19 years turning Coach into a multibillion-dollar global luxury powerhouse. Head designer Reed Krakoff became a fashion superstar, thanks to runway-worthy leather goods that could also be sold to the masses—at much lower prices than European peers could offer. When Sara Lee spun off its leather goods business in 2000, Coach had just surpassed the half-billion mark in annual revenue.

Krakoff’s most lasting contribution came in 2001, when the label released a line of bags covered in interlocking Cs, a design that coincided with the very beginning of fashion’s logo craze: Abercrombie & Fitch Co. (No. 69) had its logo tees, Gap Inc. (No. 20) had its logo sweatshirts, and Coach had its logo bags. The print was applied to premium leather satchels, as well as to its cheap nylon tote bags. In a little over a decade, Coach would grow into one of the world’s largest handbag labels, peaking at nearly $5.1 billion.

Frankfort and Krakoff left Coach in 2014. The company said that the CEO’s departure was part of a long-term succession plan and that it didn’t require an interim chief for the transition. Frankfort took a role as an executive-in-residence at private-equity firm Sycamore Partners. Krakoff, too, left before Coach had found a replacement. (He is now the creative head of U.S. jeweler Tiffany & Co.)

Luis spent eight years under their leadership and watched the empire they built come crashing, in a very literal sense. Coach’s old industrial building, at 516 West 34th St, has since been taken down. One executive kept a brick as a souvenir.

Six months after Luis became CEO, executives held an investor day to reveal their turnaround plans. It would get worse before it gets better, they said. A 2014 company-wide memo asked not to panic, even though sales would be down more than 20% for the quarter. “That’s not a pretty number,” says Luis. “Even if you know it’s coming, it never feels good.”

In search of ‘elevation’

On the bottom floor of Tapestry’s new headquarters, seamstresses and leatherworkers sit at sewing machines, churning out sample clutches and hobo bags among spools of bonded leather and rubber fleece. Upstairs, a squad of designers sketch at high desks, surrounded by sheets of fabric. Pin-up boards line the merchandising floor, a vast menu of styles for a brand that sells thousands of different products.

On the 19th floor is the glossy C-suite. Senior management has experienced near-total turnover under Luis, and new faces now run the company’s global supply chain, finance, international business development, and technology. All three of Tapestry’s labels have new top executives, each recruited from outside the company. Kate Spade is run by fashion veteran Anna Bakst, who came over from Michael Kors in late March. In April, Stuart Weitzman announced that its new boss was Eraldo Poletto, the former head of Italian fashion house Salvatore Ferragamo.

Coach CEO Joshua Schulman, who joined from Neiman Marcus Group last June, is the company’s longest-tenured brand chief. The former president of posh department store Bergdorf Goodman speaks conceptually about Coach’s “brand DNA” (a label’s most distinctive attributes), the impact of “omnichannel commerce” (selling seamlessly both online and in stores), and where each new handbag line fits into his theoretical product “pyramid” (higher margin items with a smaller market at the top; lower ones with a bigger market at the bottom).

Coach has begun to diversify its offerings beyond handbags. It started selling ready-to-wear apparel, and it plans to expand into new product categories and grow its menswear selection, which accounts for about 20% of the business. Its merchandise now includes outerwear, jewelry, watches, scarves, and fragrances. Schulman is open to expanding into home decor and other segments, when the time comes.

“Elevate” is a word that Coach executives use on a near-constant basis, whether it’s elevated product, elevated price points, or an elevated brand. The average price of a Coach handbag was once under $300. Now, according to Schulman, the sweet spot for price is from $300 to $500. The Rogue, at $795, is Coach’s most expensive line of handbags. Made from glove-tanned pebble leather, it has detachable straps and suede lining and can also come in bold patterns and embellishments. It was designed with die-cut snakeskin tea roses and priced at an elevated $1,500 in the recent season.

In February, the brand welcomed celebrities and influencers to a runway show for Coach 1941, an upscale offshoot of its main brand, designed by creative head Stuart Vevers. “He’s taken the brand in directions that it had never been,” says Schulman. The catwalk itself was more abstract art than clothing showcase, presented as an eerie forest full of video monitors gone haywire. As the show closed, lights dimmed and strobes pulsed as the models hurried through the set. You couldn’t see the clothes at all—not that it mattered. This was about artistic credibility.

“Maybe a shopper who buys a Fendi or a Dior might come in and buy Coach apparel or Coach footwear, because it does now have a luxury point of view,” says Erinn Murphy, an analyst at Piper Jaffray. “That customer would have never bought a logo-oriented Coach tote from seven or eight years ago.”

More brands, more problems?

Tapestry’s other brands remain in recovery from a variety of ailments. Stuart Weitzman’s business largely relies on two styles: an over-the-knee, super-tall boot called the “5050” and a line of minimalist “Nudist” sandals with a delicate ankle strap. But if consumers aren’t wooed with compelling versions of those franchises for one season, it can mean disaster. Earlier this year, the shoemaker ran into production delays with new styles, forcing the company to admit that the issue will persist through next winter. On top of that, Tapestry ousted Stuart Weitzman’s creative director, Giovanni Morelli, in May, citing issues with his “behavior.”

With $1.4 billion in annual revenue when it was acquired, Kate Spade had different problems, primarily that it had torpedoed its own brand with constant online flash sales. As a more youthful, less serious brand, it sells sneakers covered in rose gold glitter, jacquard dresses in multi-color daisies, and giant, heart-shaped hoop earrings. But the label’s whimsical items were often too strange for luxury shoppers unwilling to shell out $300 on bags that looked, for example, like a giant cat’s head. Weak traffic at its outlet stores forced the brand to offer deeper discounts. Even worse, several seasons of inventory missteps hindered stores that failed to stock enough of the merchandise that people actually wanted.

Sales at Kate Spade fell 3% in the last period—its sixth-straight negative quarter—but that qualified as good news since it still beat analysts’ estimates, sending the stock up as much as 11%. In June, fashion designer Kate Valentine, better known as Kate Spade and co-founder of the label, died in an apparent suicide at her Manhattan apartment. Grieving fans had an “immediate heartfelt response” to the news, executives said, and shoppers bought up products bearing her name.

At first, Tapestry estimated it would see from $30 to $35 million in savings from the Kate Spade integration. Next year, it expects to hit from $100 to $115 million. Analysts see Kate Spade’s growth potential as an attractive opportunity, if its new owner is willing to shrink first and keep enduring months of bad results as it reduces flash sales. “If they have the discipline to see this through, then the reality is they’ll emerge better off at the end of the tunnel,” says Simeon Siegel, an analyst at Nomura’s Instinet. “It’s important to understand what was the healthy sales versus what was the extra dollar that management wanted to grab.”

But if the company is to fulfill the promise of becoming an American luxury conglomerate, Tapestry will eventually have to spend billions more to acquire additional brands. Luis insists that the company must first fix Kate Spade before resuming the hunt. When it’s time, though, the company will be looking for labels in accessories, footwear, apparel, and outerwear to add to its offerings.

And he has no plans to stop at things you wear. “We’re very focused on our planning horizon, which tends to be three to five years, but that doesn’t mean there’s no opportunity for Tapestry, as a house of brands, to evolve well beyond the core fashion categories,” he says. “The opportunities are endless.”

In analysts’ and media reports during the past year, numerous brand names have been mentioned as potential acquisition targets: Burberry (No. 457), Britain’s largest luxury label, as well as Barbour, Mulberry, and Longchamp, the French accessories brand. Italy has its share of attractive targets, too, such as Furla handbags and Canali tailoring. PVH Corp. (No. 63), owner of Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein, is the closest thing to an existing American fashion multi-brand house, and it could potentially be in the mix as a buyer. But PVH is considered more a mid-range apparel seller than a glitzy luxury group.

Tapestry’s American competition won’t be so easily left behind. Last November, Michael Kors Holdings Ltd. (No. 295) bought shoe label Jimmy Choo for $1.2 billion, its first foray outside its legacy brand. Famous for its Sex and the City stilettos that Sarah Jessica Parker loved so much, the pumps can cost $600 to $1,200 or more, making Choo higher-end than its new owner is. The addition gives Kors a strong foothold in footwear as the handbag war spills into shoes and clothing. At the time, Michael Kors CEO John Idol said the acquisition signaled the start of new strategy: to build an international group of luxury brands.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999991655349731}",neutral,0.9999991655349731,0

How French luxury group LVMH ‘opens up’ to Chinese consumers - Style,"Sat, 04 Aug 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjbXAuY29tL21hZ2F6aW5lcy9zdHlsZS9mYXNoaW9uLWJlYXV0eS9hcnRpY2xlLzIxNTgwODIvaG93LWZyZW5jaC1sdXh1cnktZ3JvdXAtbHZtaC1vcGVucy1pdHMtd29ybGQtYXJ0LWFuZNIBeGh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLnNjbXAuY29tL21hZ2F6aW5lcy9zdHlsZS9mYXNoaW9uLWJlYXV0eS9hcnRpY2xlLzIxNTgwODIvaG93LWZyZW5jaC1sdXh1cnktZ3JvdXAtbHZtaC1vcGVucy1pdHMtd29ybGQtYXJ0LWFuZA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"However, the French multinational luxury goods conglomerate that owns Louis Vuitton, Christian Dior and dozens of other prestigious brands can be perceived as a distant giant.

From its modest beginnings in the construction industry, Antoine Arnault’s father Bernard Arnault has built LVMH into the world’s largest luxury empire.

This article was written by Lin Wang and originally published in Jing Daily

When I visit workshops, I am always touched by the genuine passion, vibrant energy and a strong sense of belonging and pride of our artisans. They are truly the soul of LVMH Antoine Arnault, head of global communications, LVMH

As a representative of the group’s younger generation, Antoine – recently appointed to lead ‪global communications‬ for LVMH – feels responsible to change that dated perception.

During a recent interview with Jing Daily in Paris, he said: “When I visit workshops, I am always touched by the genuine passion, vibrant energy and a strong sense of belonging and pride of our artisans. They are truly the soul of LVMH.”

So why not open the doors of the maisons and let these “backstage heroes” share their stories?

In 2011, Antoine initiated Les Journées Particulières, a now-famous event that – for the first time – invited the public to step inside the design houses and interact with the artisans.

More than 100,000 visitors turned up over the two-day initiative.

“I was happy to see people who are not our usual customers,” he says. “Some students came very early in the morning and waited for three hours to get in.”

This year, the fourth edition of Les Journées Particulières will take place from October 12 to 14.

However, this time it is going global, with 76 venues across four continents – and this time it features a particular marketing push towards Chinese consumers, who form an expanding slice of LVMH’s business.

In the first quarter of 2018, LVMH reported a 13 per cent rise in sales compared with the same period the year before and specifically cited Chinese demand for its products as the reason for the faster-than-expected growth.

For our Chinese guests, it will be a perfect opportunity to see who, where and how our products are made. ‘Event in event’ surprises await them, too, such as live performances, film screenings, and even unexpected encounters Antoine Arnault

We spoke to Antoine – who continues his roles as chairman of the Italian knitwear brand Loro Piana and CEO of the menswear house Berluti – at this year’s Les Journées Particulières launch event to find out why it is special and, in particular, how it is targeting new Chinese customers who are keen to savour luxury and culture.

1. What can Chinese visitors expect from Les Journées Particulières 2018?

For our Chinese guests, it will be a perfect opportunity to see who, where and how our products are made.

“Event in event” surprises await them, too, such as live performances, film screenings, and even unexpected encounters.

Last time, tickets for Louis Vuitton and Christian Dior visits got snapped up in less than one minute. Of course, they could also come spontaneously, but maybe queue for a few hours. We expect more than 150,000 visitors this year Antoine Arnault

Imagine when they are at the perfume workshop of Maison Francis Kurkdjian and suddenly the master perfumer comes in.

Wouldn’t it be nice to hear him talk about his inspirations and approach to perfume making?

And how about having a drink with our artisans?

2. How are you reaching out, in particular, to accommodate your Chinese guests?

We will facilitate Chinese visitors to enjoy Les Journées Particulières, with the event app in Chinese and Chinese-speaking guides at some key sites.

A series of podcasts including candid conversations and sound tours with our artisans will also be released, to enrich the experience.

3. How can they participate?

Everyone is welcome and there is absolutely no barrier to entry.

I want to emphasise again that it is not for clients or VIPs.

Interested visitors can create an online profile from September 13 onwards and register between September 24 and 30 to reserve a fast pass.

Last time, tickets for Louis Vuitton and Christian Dior visits got snapped up in less than one minute.

Of course, they could also come spontaneously, but maybe queue for a few hours. We expect more than 150,000 visitors this year.

4. The many visitor options range from iconic sites such as Christian Dior’s Parisian maison to a floating palace in Venice and vineyards in Argentina. Which ones do you recommend?

Whichever brands they enjoy, they can go and visit and experience luxury and culture on a whole new level.

For example, on Friday morning they can go to Givenchy’s Haute Couture salon in Paris and then take the train to visit the Champagne vineyards in the afternoon.

Since many Chinese will travel abroad near the Golden Week, they should not miss this golden opportunity!

Speaking from my heart, I would suggest Berluti. At Berluti’s bespoke shoes workshop, Chinese guests could explore the art of patina [colouring and bleaching leather techniques that give each Berluti shoes a distinctive identity] and meet our master shoemakers.

I know them personally and some have been working there for over 30 years. Once they even created “Shanghai night”-style Berluti.

If someone orders a pair of Berluti shoes today, he has to wait over a year to receive it. But people don’t mind and our bookings are always full. I am against this ‘see now, buy now’ shopping model Antoine Arnault

If someone orders a pair of Berluti shoes today, he has to wait over a year to receive it.

But people don’t mind and our bookings are always full. I am against this “see now, buy now” shopping model.

For me, it kills luxury. At Berluti, we let the craftsmen take the time and patience to craft each pair to the finest quality.

I hope through this visit, people will appreciate that true craftsmanship takes time.

5. Do you plan to open up venues in China?

Many people think we only sell in China and there is nothing to see, but we do have some intriguing places such as a Chandon winery in Ningxia, northwestern China.

Long daylight hours, well-irrigated soil and a protected environment make it ideal for growing grapes.

We don’t do marketing the way people think. There are no market or trends studies.

We don’t think: ‘OK, Chinese like red. Let’s do something red.’ We trust our designers to create products that connect with our customers and we give them that creative freedom Antoine Arnault

Since 2013, we have been blending age-old French savoir faire with Chinese modernity to make sparkling wine that is slightly sweet and a good partner with Chinese cuisine.

However, there are some concerns such as the long travel distance from major cities to Ningxia. So we are still assessing the best possibilities.

6. What is LVMH’s specific approach to marketing in China?

We don’t do marketing the way people think. There are no market or trends studies.

We don’t think: “OK, Chinese like red. Let’s do something red.”

We trust our designers to create products that connect with our customers and we give them that creative freedom.

What we do is to place products beautifully in the stores and plan some campaigns around what they create.

In mid-June, we chose Shanghai to host our first “DARE” initiative outside Europe.

The internal call for ideas went to nearly 6,000 employees in the Asia-Pacific region and eventually 60 were selected to turn the ideas into business plans.

Three winning ideas are going to be implemented, including customising luxury goods in a sustainable way.

Exclusive: LVMH-owned Hennessy Signs New Deal with Alibaba - Jing Daily,"Fri, 31 Aug 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiLGh0dHBzOi8vamluZ2RhaWx5LmNvbS9wb3N0cy9oZW5uZXNzeS1hbGliYWJh0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LVMH-owned wine and spirits maison Moët Hennessy today signed a strategic partnership with Tmall, the business-to-consumer marketplace owned by China’s largest e-commerce platform, Alibaba. The collaboration is a part of Moët Hennessy’s efforts to step up its offerings in the fast-growing market as consumers’ demand for luxury liquors is picking up.

The new partnership, the first online in China for Moët Hennessy, seeks to “upgrade the customer experience,” the company explains, and will also strengthen the data collaboration between two parties, allowing Moët Hennessy to access Alibaba’s massive database to gain better insights into Chinese consumer behaviors. It includes plans for Moët Hennessy and Tmall to partner in areas including “new retail” initiatives, marketing and communication, and intellectual property.

""When brands sign [partnerships] with Tmall, they are able to collaborate with us on a deeper level and tap into benefits from across Alibaba’s powerful ecosystem,"" said a spokesperson at Alibaba. Others players in the wine & spirits sector including American winery E&J Gallo and Vinexpo have signed such memorandums of understanding with the e-tailer previously.

The partnership is being announced and signed on Tmall Super Brand Day August 31, when content from Chinese celebrities and key opinion leaders (KOLs) is featured, and Hennessy V.S.O.P 200th anniversary special edition is being made available for sales exclusively on its Tmall store, priced at 100 (RMB 688).

“[We] will work with Alibaba to share more data-powered customer profiles and consumer behaviors,” said Andrew Khan, the Vice President of Marketing at Moët Hennessy Diageo China, “which will allow us to have more creative online initiatives for occasions such as a new product launch and brand event in the future.”

Moët Hennessy Diageo China is a joint venture between the French luxury conglomerate LVMH and the global spirits group Diageo. Establishing an official presence in the mainland market since 2005, the brand has set up official stores on both Alibaba’s Tmall and JD.com in the last two years to cash in on the shifting purchasing habits of luxury liquor buyers in China.

According to a whitepaper co-released by Alibaba and Hennessy this month, the liquor consumption market through online platforms in China reached 8.8 billion (RMB 60 billion) in 2017 and is expected to grow by 20 percent in 2018. Notably, cognac, Moët Hennessy’s core product, is projected--at least by the company itself--to account for 40 percent of the total online liquor sales this year.

Earlier this year, Hennessy embarked on an elaborate and highly creative campaign of offline marketing and rebranding initiatives with its “Hennessy & Meal,” launching a number of food-related pop-up events in major Chinese cities like Guangzhou, Xiamen, Shantou, Shunde, etc.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.8836888074874878}",positive,0.8836888074874878,1

The position is vacant since the beginning of the year, as Simon Whitehouse left the business after three years spearheading the company. Now, J.W. Anderson seeks to incorporate a manager from LVMH.

To replace Galimberti in front of the Louis Vuitton communication department, LVMH is considering several names. The one that sounds with more options is Stefano Cantino, former director of strategic marketing at Prada Group.

J.W. Anderson focuses its distribution in the wholesale channel, in department store chains like Barneys, Opening Ceremony, Selfridges or Harrods, among others. LVMH acquired a stake in the British firm in September 2013, months before Anderson’s appointment as creative director of Loewe.

For the first time, it will stretch to the United States, Latin America, Australia and New Zealand, with a total of 13 participating countries, versus six in 2016.

Among the 39 sites that will open to the public for the first time are a Louis Vuitton prototype workshop in Paris; the restored Château de la Colle Noire, formerly owned by Christian Dior; the Caffè Cova pastry shop in Milan, and Newton Vineyard in Napa Valley, Calif.

The conglomerate headed by Bernard Arnault, France’s wealthiest man, launched the biennial initiative in 2011 to counter a perception that it was only interested in making money.

“I think it’s important to balance this image of the group, centered on profit and performance, with the reality,” said his son Antoine Arnault, who is head of communication and image of LVMH and chief executive officer of Berluti. “We don’t design our collections or make decisions in terms of profit or performance targets, but rather in terms of creativity and desirability for our customers.”

For Anthony Delos, a master bootmaker at Berluti, the event is a rare opportunity to explain what he does. Considered one of the finest practitioners of his trade, Delos spent eight years traveling across France to complete his training under a centuries-old apprenticeship system known as Les Compagnons du Devoir.

“Mastering the different stages of boot making requires at least 10 years. To be good at everything, you need a minimum of 20 years. I’m 42, and I’m not good at everything,” he said during a recent visit to the Berluti workshop in central Paris.

His C.V. suggests otherwise. Since his independent workshop was acquired by Berluti in 2012, Delos has traveled across Asia to conduct fittings with clients. He believes in designing each shoe by hand, eschewing computers for the personal touch — something he also applies to his encounters with members of the public.

“It’s always a pleasure to explain my trade, especially as it’s a traditional trade, and nobody talks about those. The Journées Particulières event is an exceptional opportunity to expose the general public to French traditional professions,” he said, noting that artisanal career paths are trickling back into favor.

“There was a time when the French education system discouraged people from sending their children to learn shoemaking. The same is true of Italy, which is why there are practically no young people in shoemaking there. Nowadays, they are coming back with a vengeance. We have a lot of young people who get a degree and then return to study in our training system,” he noted.

LVMH runs its own vocational training program, the Institut des Métiers d’Excellence, which has partnerships with top French schools in areas including jewelry, dressmaking, winemaking, leather goods, client advisory and retail design. The initiative, which launched in 2014, took in 300 students this year.

French luxury goods trade association Comité Colbert, meanwhile, has worked with the French government to distinguish artisans with the title of Knight of the Order of Arts and Letters in order to highlight exceptional skills and encourage young people to follow in their footsteps.

“It’s not just about prestige,” cautioned Delos. “When you do manual work, it’s always nice to produce a new piece and to grow. For young people, it’s great. Some trades aren’t linked to luxury and are less prestigious, but it’s the same principle: you’re learning a traditional skill.”

Some 3,000 employees from a total of 56 LVMH houses will take part in this year’s edition of Les Journées Particulières, which is expected to draw more than 150,000 visitors. Arnault said free entry tickets for Louis Vuitton and Christian Dior visits usually get snapped up online in less than one minute.

Having appeared in the documentary “Dior and I,” Florence Chehet is used to being in the spotlight. During a recent visit to the workshops of the Paris couture house off Avenue Montaigne, the head of the atelier flou expertly peeled open a floral gown designed by Maria Grazia Chiuri to expose its corseted underpinnings.

“You can turn our dresses inside out: they are as perfectly finished on the inside as they are on the outside. You could, if you wanted to, wear them inside out,” said Chehet, who heads a team of 32 people. It’s the type of detail that typically surprises visitors, she said.

“It’s hard for us to imagine how little people know about what we do. They have no idea what goes on in here,” she remarked. “It’s always surprising, because to us it’s so obvious. For example, when you look at this dress, you would never think there is all this bustier and boning inside it. That’s a lot of work.”

Eric Leroux, maker of leather goods and trunks at Louis Vuitton, takes similar pride in his creations. On a recent July afternoon at the company’s workshop in Asnières, on the outskirts of Paris, he was cutting a black crocodile hide to cover a custom-made trunk designed to be used for Japanese tea ceremonies.

Leroux, who was named a Knight of the Order of Arts and Letters in 2014, said it was only the second time in his 35-year career that he had handled such a large crocodile skin. Nearby sat his own trunk, customized with dozens of gleaming metallic badges.

“They were going to destroy it, and I asked if I could salvage it to turn it into a tool kit,” he said. “Now it’s become a bit of an obsession: I designed my initials on the lid using 1,500 nails.”

Thierry de Longevialle, director of the Louis Vuitton museum and adjoining family house, said the venue was used to welcoming guests, but he expects to greet upwards of 1,000 people a day, divided into groups of 10 to 15, during the Journées Particulières.

“We entertain a lot of press and customers here,” he noted. “However, we do want it to remain a fairly exclusive experience, so we don’t want people standing in line in the street. We want to keep a sense of intimacy.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999747276306152}",neutral,0.9999747276306152,0
'Red Gold' Rush: Celebrity Watch Brand Takes on Luxury Giant LVMH in Multi-Million Dollar Case - TheWrap,"Mon, 20 Aug 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXdyYXAuY29tL3JlZC1nb2xkLWx2bWgtbGF3c3VpdC10cmFkZW1hcmstaW5mcmluZ2VtZW50L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"A boutique watchmaker is gearing up to take on luxury giant LVMH for trademark infringement, over the former’s longtime clever marketing strategy to sell men’s “rose gold” timepieces — by calling it “red gold.”

Justin Timberlake, 50 Cent, Will Smith, LeBron James and Jamie Foxx have all worn the wares of Chris Aire, the watchmaker in question whose brand Solid 21 has been selling high-end timepieces since the late 1980s.

“Men were not interested in pink gold or rose gold watches, they were too feminine,” Aire told TheWrap. “But we had a lot of male clients. We figured that red denotes masculinity.”

The concept also occurred to watchmaker Hublot, a subdivision of LVMH (which owns brands like Louis Vuitton and Christian Dior), who began using “red gold” in advertisements in 2005 — two years after Aire trademarked the phrase — Aire said in his lawsuit. Reps for LVMH did not respond to TheWrap’s request for comment.

Big business is at stake, Aire said. His cheapest red gold model goes for $24,000 and can run as high as $275,000 (which will buy you a full diamond case, diamond dials and a diamond-encrusted bracelet). Lawyers for Aire say Hublot has profited in the tens of millions through its infringement of the “red gold” mark.

“This brand is his livelihood. People are confused and the industry is taking advantage of a brand that he built up,” said Aire’s attorney David Hecht, partner at Pierce Bainbridge Beck Price & Hecht LLP.

“He worked for years to build up the brand and then to face multiple companies who have been turned on to it and stole it is not right, that’s not fair,” Hecht said.

In a 2015 motion for summary judgment, Hublot argued that the term “red gold” had been used for years within the industry to describe a gold-and-copper mix. But Aire appealed, saying that before Hublot’s company spent millions to market the tinted colored gold under the name “Red Gold,” Hublot and other big watch conglomerates used the terms “rose gold” and “pink gold.”

Aire is seeking damages for the trademark infringement, as well as a financial settlement to launch a “corrective” ad campaign to assure consumers who owns red gold.

“I feel like they have basically reaped where they have not sown,” Aire said. “We’re looking forward to the American people listening to our story and right this wrong.”

A trial is set for October 23, and true to form, will also be a celebrity affair — as Aire’s witnesses include rapper Shaggy and former NBA point guard Gary Payton.

"LVMH, Kering and Chanel Slash Print Advertising as Digital Reigns Supreme - The Fashion Law","Fri, 10 Aug 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWZhc2hpb25sYXcuY29tL2x2bWgta2VyaW5nLWFuZC1jaGFuZWwtc2xhc2gtcHJpbnQtYWR2ZXJ0aXNpbmctYXMtZGlnaXRhbC1yZWlnbnMtc3VwcmVtZS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"image: Chanel

Ad spending in print magazines dropped by a whopping $400 million last year. According to the Association of Magazine Media’s annual report, spending by the top 50 marketers fell from $6.5 billion in 2016 to $6.1 billion last year, as an increasing number of companies, particularly in the fashion and luxury sectors, continue to boost spending on digital campaigns, including tapping big-name influencers to help them find favor amongst millennial and Gen-Z consumers.

According to WWD, notable decreases is print ad spending came from LVMH Möet Hennessy Louis Vuitton. The Paris-based luxury goods conglomerate – which owns Louis Vuitton, Christian Dior, Celine, Loewe, and Givenchy, among other fashion and non-fashion brands, such beauty retailer Sephora and Rihanna’s Fenty Beauty collection – cut spending by $15.2 million to $216.3 million. Rival Kering – parent to Gucci, Saint Laurent, and Yves Saint Laurent – cut by $7.5 million from 2016 for spending that amounted to $97.2 million for 2017.

Chanel, which revealed in June that it made $9.62 billion in 2017 (its first-ever public-facing revenue report), similarly chopped its print ad spending by $7.8 million to $67.4 million, and American e-commerce giant Amazon cut its print efforts almost by half – $37.6 million – down to $44.3 million.

Such scaled back print spending is in line with reports that fashion brands are looking online for both sales and influence. Online sales have become the fashion industry’s most important and promising engine of growth. McKinsey & Company predicts that online sales of luxury goods will top $81 billion by 2025, and even before that, is slated to amount for between 18 to 20 percent of brands’ total revenue.

With this in mind, brands are ramping up their digital ad spending. As of last fall, a 91 percent of luxury brands were using influencers in connection with their marketing efforts, according to L2 Digital. Even more fashion, luxury and cosmetics brands, a whopping 98 percent, are actively lending samples or gifting products to influencers in hopes of boosting digital visibility (i.e., appearing on their Instagram accounts) and thereby, boosting sales.

As for the tangible return-on-investment for such digital spending, the jury is still out, due, in part, to the fact that influencer marketing does not always result in direct sales conversions (and instead, tend to give rise to an increase in brand awareness), conversion metrics are more complicated. Add to this, the rampant presence of bots on social media, which has given rise to theories of engagement fraud, and you can see some of the difficulties that brands are currently grappling with in the midst of the large-scale shift from print to the web.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.990827739238739}",neutral,0.990827739238739,0

What Happened

(ADR) (OTC: HEINY), BMW, Nintendo Ltd/Adr (OTC: NTDOY) and adidas AG (ADR) (OTC: ADDYY) will be added in what Robinhood said is the biggest addition of new securities since the app launched three years ago.

What's Next

In the coming months, French ADRs will be added to Robinhood, including UBISOFT Entmt S/ADR (OTC: UBSFY), LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SA Unsponsored ADR (OTC: LVMUY) and Michelin COMPAG/ADR (OTC: MGDDY).

Spectacular visibility: JCDecaux and LVMH embrace giant new digital platform at Hong Kong Airport - The Moodie Davitt Report,"Fri, 24 Aug 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigAFodHRwczovL21vb2RpZWRhdml0dHJlcG9ydC5jb20vc3BlY3RhY3VsYXItdmlzaWJpbGl0eS1qY2RlY2F1eC1hbmQtbHZtaC1lbWJyYWNlLWdpYW50LW5ldy1kaWdpdGFsLXBsYXRmb3JtLWF0LWhvbmcta29uZy1haXJwb3J0L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"HONG KONG. JCDecaux has partnered with LVMH Group brands to exploit the largest interior digital media format ever seen at Hong Kong International Airport (HKIA).

Appropriately dubbed Spectacular Digital, the new platform launched in April in arrivals hall A and last month in arrivals hall B.

Spectacular Digital is a giant digital LED, measuring nearly 72 metres by 40.8 metres (nearly 3,000sq m). It displays pixels of 3mm quality, creating what the advertising concessionaire described as “an iconic communication space”.

International luxury powerhouse LVMH Group has taken the lead in embracing the format. Fashion brand Dior showcased its designer eyewear when Spectacular Digital was launched in Arrivals Hall B this May. The group’s Hennessy Cognac brand is currently promoting its savoir faire campaign ‘Find What Matters’.

Besides its fashion, wines and spirits brands, the LVMH Group will continue to leverage Spectacular Digital to digitally promote its other brands’ bespoke messages, JCDecaux noted.

“Impactful brand communication has become a digital reality through the brand-new Spectacular Digital in Hong Kong International Airport, a leading international aviation hub in the Asia Pacific region, which handled 73 million air passengers traffic in 2017,” said JCDecaux Transport Managing Director Shirley Chan. “JCDecaux Transport is very honoured to have partnered with the LVMH Group to inaugurate this centric digital media.”

Note: The Moodie Davitt Report is the only international B2B media to cover all airport consumer services, revenue-generating and otherwise.

"Francois Nars, Steven Klein Slapped with $6 Million-Plus Lawsuit Over Collaboration Imagery ""Fraud"" - The Fashion Law","Thu, 16 Aug 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWZhc2hpb25sYXcuY29tL2ZyYW5jb2lzLW5hcnMtc3RldmVuLWtsZWluLXNsYXBwZWQtd2l0aC0xMC1taWxsaW9uLXN1aXQtb3Zlci1mcmF1ZHVsZW50LWNvbGxhYm9yYXRpb24v0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"image via W Magazine

Fresh on the heels of settling the $10 million lawsuit that he filed in April against LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, renowned makeup artist Sammy Mourabit is taking photographer Steven Klein and makeup guru Francois Nars to court in a separate multi-million dollar lawsuit, claiming that they used his work from a 2013 W magazine photoshoot for the packaging and promotion of for their collaboration collection without his permission, a move that Mourabit calls “blatant and mendacious deception of the public and theft.”

According to Mourabit’s suit, which was filed in New York state court on Tuesday, “With breathtaking chutzpah, Steven Klein – a well-known fashion photographer, and Francois Nars – a well-known makeup artist – launched a line of makeup named after themselves.” The problem, according to Mourabit? The packaging and promotional materials for the collection “promoted another artist’s – Sammy Mourabit’s – work” without compensating him or giving him credit for his work, and instead, “fraudulently” presenting it as their own.

Mourabit – who is known for his work with Rihanna, Katy Perry, Madonna, Britney Spears, major magazines like Vogue and Harper’s Bazaar, and designers such as Rick Owens – takes issue with one photograph in particular, one that Klein took during a December 2013 photo shoot for W magazine.

While Klein, as the photographer of the imagery, has exclusive rights in the photos in accordance with copyright law, Mourabit claims that he also has rights in the image since he was responsible for the makeup design. Mourabit points to a federal copyright registration for the “Juliette Lewis Woman Scorcese” photo from the W magazine spread – which depicts actress Juliette Lewis with a glitter-covered face, bold eyebrows, and bold red glittered lips – as evidence of his rights in the image.

While the bar for copyright protection is notoriously low (and according to at least some experts, may be getting a bit more rigorous as of late), it is certainly worth pondering whether bold eyebrows, a glitter-covered face, and red lips meet the requisite level of originality.

image: Nars x Steven Klein

Mourabit goes on to claim that “both Nars and Klein knew they were intentionally deceiving the public in promoting their new products.” In particular he alleges, “Mr. Klein knew Mr. Nars was not responsible for the artistry he knew to be central to the promotion, and Mr. Nars certainly knew the work he was pushing as his own was not his.” He also claims that their “conduct was materially deceptive and misleading,” especially since “99.99% of makeup purchasers would have believed that Mr. Mourabit’s work was Mr. Nars’ and, critically, that the make up being sold was used in Mr. Mourabit’s work: which it obviously was not.”

The makeup artists further alleges that “it is easy to understand Klein’s and Nars’s decision to fob Mr. Mourabit’s work off as Mr. Nars’ – both Mr. Klein and Mr. Nars knew that Mr. Mourabit was an infinitely superior makeup artist,” but asserts that such an “understanding does not excuse their conduct.”

For those wondering about the protectability of makeup designs: Much like how copyright law provides exclusive rights – such as the rights of reproduction, adaptation, and public display – to authors, painters, musicians, and choreographers, etc., for their original works, copyright law provides protection for original makeup design. You may recall the Southern District of New York’s decision in Carell v. Shubert, in which it held that the stage makeup featured in the Broadway musical Cats was sufficiently original and expressive to be protectable under copyright law.

As a result, Mourabit claims that just as Klein has rights in the images, he does, too. As a result, and in connection with his claims of copyright infringement and unfair competition, he is seeking damages of upwards of $6 million, as Nars and Klein have been “enriched by their use of [his] artistry to promote and build their collection” and he “was not compensated at all for the use of his work.”

Hennessy's Strategy to Lure Cognac Drinkers Back to the Table - Jing Daily,"Tue, 21 Aug 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiNGh0dHBzOi8vamluZ2RhaWx5LmNvbS9wb3N0cy9oZW5uZXNzeS1jb2duYWMtZHJpbmtlcnPSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"This past May at Shanghai’s swanky mall-cum-museum space K11, lab-coated hosts handed out mysterious glass funnels and test tubes while whispering secret formulas to well-heeled guests. No, this wasn’t a military experiment or a movie production, it was the latest promotional event for the 254-year-old French cognac brand Hennessy.

The pop-up event was part of Hennessy’s marketing campaign ""Hennessy & Meal,"" a key part of the brand’s strategy to rebuild itself, after an industry-wide slump throughout Asia a few years ago, into a modern wine-and-dine icon in China. Over the past two years, Hennessy has held different events in Guangzhou, Xiamen, Shantou, Shunde and other provinces and has promoted their brand by collaborating with more than 150 local Chinese restaurants.

At the Shanghai party, ""I was delighted to learn so much about food and drink pairing at this event,” said Chinese millennial and Shanghai resident Ting Ting, “and what's better is that there are all kinds of props ready to make the experience Instagram worthy!""

The campaign, which originated in 2014, has shown positive early returns this year, as has the cognac market as a whole, after its serious slide. In LVMH’s first half 2018 financial result, (Hennessy is an LVMH brand) cognac and spirits delivered 9 percent organic revenue growth, reaching revenue of 1.552 billion (1.368 billion euros), and there was strong momentum seen in the China market.

By and large, Chinese are free-spenders on luxury liquors. But compared to domestic drinks like baijiu, the imported spirit market share in China is still fairly small. Categories like brandy/cognac and whiskey/bourbon have one of the higher penetration rates but also lower drinking frequencies, although cognac received the most penetration among imported spirits, according to a 2017 Mintel Import Spirit China Report .

In fact, the value of cognac imports in China peaked at 7.8 billion in 2012 only to crash by 36 percent three years after the country’s state­-sponsored clampdown on conspicuous consumption and gift­-giving in 2014. Despite that setback, which Hennessy and its competitors are scrambling to reverse, China is still considered one of the most important export markets for cognac in terms of volume and value.

Hennessy shared their plan with Jing Daily, which involved establishing their brand in the south (in Southern China, drinking spirits with meals is quite common to the region and its cuisine was the obvious first place to start marketing), then gaining more of a share in the greater Shanghai region, and then moving on to northern cities like Beijing and western cities like Chengdu. The goal is to add more cities every year.

“We are very ambitious in China, but we also realize that China is a complex market, when it comes to changing habit,” said Andrew Khan, the VP of Marketing of Moët Hennessy Diageo China. “It will take some time, it’s not going to happen overnight.”

For the 'Hennessy & Meal"" campaign, the brand selected three core products, Hennessy VSOP, XO and Paradis to test the market with a price range of 60 to 875 (400 RMB to 6,000 RMB). In the past two years, Hennessy X.O and Hennessy VSOP, two products that fall in the “more affordable” range, exceeded their target volume by over 30 percent. The brand also plans to add the variety of products with higher price points.

Moving forward, the market's—and the campaign’s future—will be determined by whichever brands best establish a drinking habit for diverse groups in China.

Hennessy is not the only spirit brand with an eye on the dining table. Hennessy’s competitor, Pernod Ricard Martell, saw its China market share reach 44 percent by volume in 2017. Martell introduced their own wine-and-dine concept in 2013 and worked closely with the Michelin-rated Chinese restaurant Da Dong to come up with new ways to pair Chinese meals with their French cognac. The brand even produced a documentary on Da Dong’s well-known chef this year as a way to inspire the consumers to create their very own Martell-paired dishes.

Hennessy’s approach was different: they placed their cognac within local contexts. By 2018, their campaign had expanded to 19 different cities and reached a target audience of over 30 million with 300 million views through online and traditional TV channels.

In the financial report published in June , the rival cognac brand Remy Cointreau said they expected more profit growth this year, helped by strong demand for its premium cognacs in China and its efforts to sell higher-priced spirits to boost margins. But regardless of price point, the key to winning the cognac market seems to rest on increasing the spirit’s drinking frequency and fans.

Along those lines, Hennessy told us that the marketing results of their K11 event were incredibly valuable—and unexpected. “One thing that really surprised us about the K11 event was how most of the attendees were really young consumers—all post-90s,” said Kahn. “We also found a higher engagement from female consumers. As you know, spirit sales are typically pretty much male-driven, so those new initiatives show diversity in gender. It's really good for us. ”

Khan is optimistic about the future. “The idea is we have a variety of products to meet the wide combination of Chinese dishes,” said Khan, “We are a French brand, but the object is to always be closer and culturally relevant.”","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.7342290878295898}",positive,0.7342290878295898,1
